<text>The Mansi (Mansi: Мāньси / Мāньси мāхум, &quot;Māńsi / Māńsi māhum&quot;, ) are an Ob-Ugric Indigenous people living in Khanty–Mansia, an autonomous okrug within Tyumen Oblast in Russia. In Khanty–Mansia, the Khanty and Mansi languages have co-official status with Russian. The Mansi language is one of the postulated Ugric languages of the Uralic family. The Mansi people were formerly known as the Voguls.

Together with the Khanty people, the Mansi are politically represented by the Association to Save Yugra, an organisation founded during Perestroika in the late 1980s. This organisation was among the first regional indigenous associations in Russia.

==Demographics==

According to the 2021 census, there were 12,228 Mansi in Russia.

==History==

The ancestors of the Mansi people populated the areas west of the Urals. Mansi findings have been unearthed in the vicinity of Perm. In the first millennium BC, they expanded to Western Siberia, where they assimilated with the native inhabitants. Other researchers say that the Khanty people originated in the south Ural steppe and moved northwards into their current location in about 500 AD.

As per the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, Uleb Ragnvaldsson, the &quot;posadnik&quot; of Novgorod, led a war party to conquer Yugra, the historical homeland of the Khanty (Ostyaks) and Mansi (Voguls). Ragnvaldsson was defeated near Syktyvkar, as the Mansi still inhabited large areas west of the Urals. This is one of the first records of Novgorod and later the unified Russian state claiming dominance over a land where they had no or negligible presence. 

Some Russian historians claim that Yugra were subjugated during the 12th century, but historical records show that Russian power was only established in the middle of the 18th century. Most likely, the Khanty people were not initially aware they had been claimed as subjects of Novgorod or Russia, and their &quot;new&quot; masters were not aware of who their subordinates were.

During the Middle Ages, it is possible that the Mansi considered the eastern territories of the Novgorod Republic and the Grand Principality of Moscow as their own. Russian folklore identifies the people of Yugra as being bloodthirsty, as natives of Yugra may have made raids into areas controlled by Novgorod or Moscow. The 15th to 17th centuries were the height of the Mansi conducting war parties on Russian lands. The Mansi principalities&#x27; leaders had sworn allegiance to the Russian tsar; however they did interpret this differently from the Russians. Mansi lords used these sworn allegiances to convince local Mansi populations that they were direct subjects of the Russian supreme leader, and hence had full right to punish Russian nobility for their wrongdoings. Raids and war parties against Russian nobility created confusion in the regions near the Ural Mountains. As a result, they were also popular with Russian peasants, as they gave them freedom to improve their lives by stealing with a &quot;permit&quot; from the tsar whatever they wished from the nobility.

During the 15th and 17th centuries, there were many conflicts among natives of Yugra in which sometimes Moscow was involved, but from the 17th century, Russia became the dominant power. There were many conflicts where the Mansi fought against the Khanty, Nenets, Tatars or Russians, changing allies as fit their needs.

The Mansi people were divided into principalities such as Kondia. In the 15th and 16th century, these were divided into three categories: central, southern and northern. The central principalities were partially included in the Grand Principality of Moscow, while some southern principalities were subjects of the Siberian Khanate, and the northern principalities were independent as knowledge of them was limited outside of the region. At the end of the 16th century, Russia made the decision to conquer the principalities. The push came under the Russian Cossack Yermak, and its influence reached the natives in the Obi River region, starting a time of troubles lasting until the reign of Peter the Great in the 18th century. It took until the end of the 17th century for the Russians to reach every corner of their claimed areas. This resulted in number of wars between Mansi principalities and the Russians.

Kondia was the most powerful principality in Yugra in the 17th century, as it was still &quot;de facto&quot; independent at the beginning of the 18th century. During that period, there was an attempt to Christianize the Mansi and others living in the same region. Kondia raised an army of several hundred men and drove the missionaries out from their lands. Kondia was also unique in that it did not pay the &quot;yasak&quot; tax until 1620, when Russia started demanding it from them. 

In 1609, the leadership of Kondia planned to push Russia out from Siberia and attacked Beryozovo. To increase their chances of success, alliances with other principalities, including Khanty principalities, were considered. Finally with the Obdorski, Belogorje and Sosva principalities, an attack was made on Beryozovo. The alliance with Khanty-run Obdorski may have been influenced by the fact that Obdorski destroyed a Russian war party in the tundra in 1600. The war was not successful and the Russians pushed for a change of leadership in Kondia. The noblewoman Anna stepped down but continued to rule behind the scenes through her son and grandson. As a result, the Russian &quot;yasak&quot; was not paid until 1620, when Russia started demanding it specifically. Peace did not last long, as the Khanty nobility formed another alliance with Khanty nobleman Mamruk to drive the Russians away. Another conflict began in 1611–1612, when Kondia started another war to drive the Russians out, unsuccessfully.

Kinema and Sueta, rulers of the Bardak principality, whose area is located in the present-day town of Surgut, attacked the village of Surgut in 1691. They stole the funds of the local administration and panic broke out in Surgut. The funds stolen had come from taxing the Nenets, as local Mansi were either excluded from paying taxes or chose to ignore taxes. The Russians responded to this offence by liquidating the principality and enforcing taxes on all the residents.

The last conflict between the Mansi and the Russian state was the Kazym rebellion in 1931–1934, where natives of Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug rebelled. The rebellion was crushed by the Red Army. This was the last known conflict between Russia and any of the Siberian tribes.

=== Relationship with historical Magyar conquerors ===
The Mansi are one of the closest linguistic relatives of modern Hungarians. Genetic data by Maroti et al. revealed high genetic affinity between Magyar conquerors and modern day Bashkirs, with both being modeled as ~50% Mansi-like, ~35% Sarmatian-like, and ~15% Hun/Xiongnu-like. The admixture event is suggested to have taken place in the Southern Ural region in 643–431 BC.

== Culture ==

The Mansi share many similarities with the Khanty people and together they are called the Ob-Ugric peoples. Their languages are closely related but clearly distinct from each other.

=== Traditional livelihood ===
The Mansi were semi-nomadic hunters and fishermen. Some Mansi also raised reindeer. A few Mansi engaged in agriculture (cultivating barley) and raised cattle and horses.

During the winter, the Mansi lived in stationary huts made out of earth and branches at permanent villages. During the spring, the Mansi moved towards hunting and fishing grounds, where they constructed temporary rectangular-shaped shelters out of birch bark and poles.

Weapons used by the Mansi were advanced for the period and included longbows, arrows, spears. They also wore iron helmets and chain mail.

=== Folk culture ===
A notable part of the traditional Mansi religion is the bear cult. A bear celebration is held in connection with the bear hunt (a similar concept to the Finnish &quot;peijaiset&quot;); it lasts for several days and involves songs, dances and plays. Mansi folklore also includes mythical and heroic stories and fate songs, which are biographical poems.

An example of the traditional material culture of Ob-Ugric peoples is ornamenting leather clothing and birch bark objects with mosaics.

== Genetics ==

=== Uniparental lineages ===
The majority of Mansi men carry haplogroup N, which is commonly found among Uralic-speaking peoples. 60 percent of them carry its subclade N1b-P43 and 16 percent belong to subclade N1c.

The maternal lineages among Mansi are more heterogeneous. The most common mitochondrial DNA haplogroup for Mansi is U, as about one in four has it. Most of them (16.6%) belong to its subgroup U4. Other haplogroups include C (18.6%), H (15.1%), J (13.1%) and D (12.6%).

=== Autosomal DNA ===
According to a 2019 study, in addition to having a high level of East Eurasian-like ancestry, the Mansi have also West Eurasian admixture. Their admixture can be modelled to be about 60% Bronze Age Baikal Lake-like and 40% Srubnaya-like, or about 54% Nganasan-like and about 38% Srubnaya-like, with additional ANE-related admixture.

In a 2018 study, Mansi samples showed variation in the amounts of West and East Eurasian admixtures. Some of them clustered with the Khanty, while outlier samples had additional West Eurasian admixture, making them closer to Uralic-speakers from the Volga-Ural region.

<doc id="581041" wikidata="Q2460003" url="?curid=581041" title="A Nation Once Again">
<text>&quot;A Nation Once Again&quot; is a song written in the early to mid-1840s by Thomas Osborne Davis (1814–1845). Davis was a founder of Young Ireland, an Irish movement whose aim was for Ireland to gain independence from Britain.

Davis believed that songs could have a strong emotional impact on people. He wrote that &quot;a song is worth a thousand harangues&quot;. He felt that music could have a particularly strong influence on Irish people at that time. He wrote: &quot;Music is the first faculty of the Irish... we will endeavour to teach the people to sing the songs of their country that they may keep alive in their minds the love of the fatherland.&quot;

&quot;A Nation Once Again&quot; was first published in &quot;The Nation&quot; on 13 July 1844 and quickly became a rallying call for the growing Irish nationalist movement at that time.

The song is a prime example of the &quot;Irish rebel music&quot; subgenre. The song&#x27;s narrator dreams of a time when Ireland will be, as the title suggests, a free land, with &quot;our fetters rent in twain&quot;. The lyrics exhort Irish people to stand up and fight for their land: &quot;And righteous men must make our land a nation once again&quot;.

It has been recorded by many Irish singers and groups, notably John McCormack, The Clancy Brothers, The Dubliners, The Wolfe Tones (a group with republican leanings) in 1972, the Poxy Boggards, and The Irish Tenors (John McDermott, Ronan Tynan, Anthony Kearns) and Sean Conway for a 2007 single. In the Beatles&#x27; movie &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, Paul McCartney&#x27;s Irish grandfather begins singing the song at the Metropolitan Police after they arrest him for peddling autographed pictures of the band members.

In 2002, after an orchestrated e-mail campaign, the Wolfe Tones&#x27; 1972 rendition of &quot;A Nation Once Again&quot; was voted the world&#x27;s most popular song according to a BBC World Service global poll of listeners, ahead of &quot;Vande Mataram&quot;, the national song of India.

Davis copied the melody for &quot;A Nation Once Again&quot; from Mozart&#x27;s Clarinet Concerto. Famously, British prime minister Winston Churchill used this phrase in an attempt to get Ireland to join forces with the British during World War II. In a telegram sent to the Irish prime minister Éamon de Valera on 8 December 1941, Churchill said: &quot;Now is your chance. Now or never. &#x27;A nation once again&#x27;. Am very ready to meet you at any time.&quot; This has been interpreted to propose that if Ireland joined forces with Britain in the war then a united Ireland would be the reward. However, on the following day, Churchill&#x27;s secretary of state for dominion affairs Lord Cranborn informed Lord Maffey, Britain&#x27;s representative to Ireland at the time, that Churchill&#x27;s use of the phrase &quot;certainly contemplated no deal over partition&quot; and was actually intended to mean that &quot;by coming into the war Ireland would regain her soul&quot;. In any case, the Irish prime minister Éamon de Valera did not respond to Churchill&#x27;s telegram, and Ireland officially remained neutral for the entire duration of the war.

==Lyrics==

The lyrics use a simple ABABCDCD rhyme scheme, with verses of eight lines, and alternating lines of iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter. Davis describes how he learned of ancient fighters for freedom as a boy — the three hundred Spartans who fought at the Battle of Thermopylae. The &quot;three men&quot; may refer to Horatius Cocles and his two companions who defended the Sublician Bridge, a legend recounted in Macaulay&#x27;s poem &quot;Horatius, published as part of the Lays of Ancient Rome, in 1842, or alternatively to the three assassins of Julius Caesar (Brutus, Gaius Cassius Longinus and Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus) who aimed to preserve the Roman Republic from tyranny. He relates this to his own hopes that Ireland may yet be freed, and be no longer a British &quot;province&quot; but a nation of its own. The use of the term &quot;once again&quot; refers to Gaelic Ireland, the pre-modern island of Gaelic culture largely independent of foreign control. Davis mentions his belief that only moral, religious men could set Ireland free, and his own aims to make himself worthy of such a task.

<text>In Greek mythology, Queen Arete (; means &quot;she who is prayed for&quot;) of Scheria was the wife of Alcinous and mother of Nausicaa and Laodamas.

== Biography ==
Arete was the daughter of Rhexenor. She was a descendant of Poseidon, who, making love to Periboea, begot Nausithous, who in turn had two sons, Rhexenor, her father and Alcinous, her uncle and later on, her husband. Her name appears to be associated with the Ionic noun ἀρητή, meaning &quot;sacred&quot;, &quot;cursed&quot; or &quot;prayed.&quot; Some sources claim that it means &quot;righteous&quot;, while others connect it with Ares, the Greek god of war.

== Mythology ==
=== Argonautica ===
Arete was also depicted as an intelligent and generous hostess by Apollonius in Book 4 of the &quot;Argonautica&quot;, where he recounts the story of Jason and Medea.

When the Argonauts arrived at the island, Arete and her husband received them and Medea hospitably. The Colchians arrived soon after in pursuit of Medea and demanded to take her back to face punishment for the death of her father, Aeëtes. Medea appealed to Arete, and Arete in turn appealed to her husband to grant mercy to Medea. When Alcinous compromised with the declaration, &quot;If she be yet a maid I decree that they carry her back to her father; but if she shares a husband&#x27;s bed, I will not separate her from her lord; nor, if she bear a child beneath her breast, will I give it up to an enemy,&quot; Arete went to Jason and Medea in the night and told them what to do so that Medea&#x27;s life would be spared. Through her efforts, the two were wed and the Colchians were forced to return to their homeland without Medea.

=== Odyssey ===
In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Arete appears as a noble and active superintendent of the household of her husband. When Odysseus arrived in Scheria, he appealed first to Arete for reception and protection, and she treated him hospitably. He did so on Nausicaa and Athena&#x27;s instructions, the goddess having described Arete thus:

Her Alcinous made his wife, and honored her as no other woman on earth is honored, of all those who in these days direct their households in subjection to their husbands; so heartily is she honored, and has ever been, by her children and by Alcinous himself and by the people, who look upon her as upon a goddess, and greet her as she goes through the city. For she of herself is no wise lacking in good understanding, and for the women to whom she has good will she makes an end of strife even among their husbands.

<doc id="581051" wikidata="Q1051694" url="?curid=581051" title="Midtown Madness">
<text>Midtown Madness (also known as Midtown Madness: Chicago Edition) is a 1999 racing game developed by Angel Studios and published by Microsoft for Microsoft Windows. The demo version was released in April 1999. Two sequels followed, with &quot;Midtown Madness 2&quot; released in September 2000 and &quot;Midtown Madness 3&quot; released in June 2003 for the Xbox. The game is set in Chicago; the object is for the player to win street races and obtain new cars.

Unlike racing games that restrict the player to a race track, &quot;Midtown Madness&quot; offers an open world recreation of Chicago. This setting was said to provide &quot;an unprecedented degree of freedom to drive around in a virtual city&quot;. Players can explore the city using one of several modes and can determine the weather and traffic conditions for each race. The game supports multiplayer races over a local area network or the Internet. The game received generally positive reviews from gaming websites. Angel Studios developed another video game featuring open-world recreations of cities, &quot;Midnight Club: Street Racing&quot;.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Midtown Madness&quot; features four single-player modes: Blitz, Circuit, Checkpoint, and Cruise. In Blitz mode, the player must swing through three checkpoints and drive to the finish line within a time limit. Circuit mode curtains off most of the city to resemble race tracks and pits the player against other cars. Checkpoint mode combines the features of Blitz and Circuit modes and has the player race against other cars to a destination—but also adds the complication of other traffic, such as police cars and pedestrians. In Cruise mode, the player can simply explore the city at their own pace. Each mode except Cruise is divided into missions—completing one unlocks the next. Environmental conditions found in each mode include: weather (sunny, rainy, cloudy, and snowy), time of day (sunrise, afternoon, sunset, and night-time), and the density of pedestrians, traffic, and police vehicles. The heads-up display includes information about the race and a detailed map, but this display can be turned off.

Players start off with five vehicles; five more are unlockable. The available vehicles range from a Volkswagen New Beetle and a Ford F-350 to a city bus and a Freightliner Century truck. Unlocking vehicles requires completing goals such as placing within the top three in any two races. If the player has previously won a race mission, they can change the race&#x27;s duration and the weather when replaying it. The Checkpoint mode allows players to set the frequency of traffic, police cars, and pedestrians. Vehicles can accrue damage from collisions, and can be disabled if excessive damage is accrued, resulting in premature failure of Blitz or Checkpoint races, or several seconds of time lost before the vehicle is immediately restored in Circuit races and Cruise.

The game&#x27;s city environment is modeled after Chicago, including many of its landmarks, such as the &#x27;L&#x27;, the Willis Tower (then known as the &quot;Sears Tower&quot;), Wrigley Field, and Soldier Field. The streets feature a number of objects the player can crash into including trash bins, parking meters, mailboxes and traffic lights. In Checkpoint mode other vehicles move in accordance with traffic lights, but the player is under no obligation to obey them.

&quot;Midtown Madness&quot; supports multiplayer games on a local area network, the Internet, or by serial cable connection. The Multiplayer mode was originally supported by Microsoft&#x27;s MSN Gaming Zone, but this service was retired on June 19, 2006. It is now supported by similar services such as GameSpy Arcade and XFire, via DirectPlay. The Multiplayer mode includes a Cops and Robbers mode, a capture the flag-style game in which players form two teams and each team tries to steal the opposing team&#x27;s cache of gold and return it to their own hideout.

== Development ==
&quot;Midtown Madness&quot; was one of the first games that Angel Studios developed for the PC. Microsoft planned to publish sequels to racing computer games with the word &quot;Madness&quot; in the title, including &quot;Motocross Madness&quot; and &quot;Monster Truck Madness&quot;. According to project director Clinton Keith, the concept behind the game came to two Microsoft employees during an attempt to cross a crowded Paris street. They proposed their idea to Angel Studios, which had tried to sell Microsoft a 3D vehicle simulator. Initially, Angel Studios was hesitant to accept Microsoft&#x27;s offer given the magnitude of the proposed undertaking. They ultimately agreed and decided to use Chicago for the setting because the city was featured in several famous car chases in films, including &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;. The development team asked Chicago residents to playtest the game to ensure that the city was recreated faithfully. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; reported that the re-creation was mostly accurate, although certain landmarks were moved to enhance gameplay. 8 to 15 people were working on the game at any one time.

Angel Studios and Microsoft included regular cars in addition to the &quot;overpowered Italian sports cars&quot; often seen in racing games. The developers obtained permission from manufacturers to use the likenesses of selected vehicles. Microsoft received authorization from Volkswagen for the New Beetle, and Ford, for the Mustang and the F-350 Super Duty. The decision to make only half the cars available at the outset was intended to promote a sense of competition. The audio team affixed microphones to cars and had Kiki Wolfkill, one of the few developers with track racing experience, drive around the track while they recorded.

Microsoft staff asked Angel Studios employees to prevent players from hitting pedestrians. Angel Studios (after deciding against rendering pedestrians in two dimensions) developed 3D pedestrian models that could run and jump out of the way. &quot;Midtown Madness&quot; included an option to remove pedestrians, as they do not alter gameplay but may affect system performance when in a group; consequently, the game does not require a 3D graphics card.

Microsoft&#x27;s marketing team expressed interest in including Taco Bell restaurants in the game to run promotions that would involve giving away free burritos, according to project director Clinton Keith, but the feature was requested too late in development for Angel Studios to make the change.

A demo version was released for download on May 1, 1999. It featured three vehicles (a Mustang, a Panoz Roadster, and a bus), and all driving modes except Circuit. The demo also included features that were scrapped in the full version, such as the ability to send billboards flying. In December 1999, Angel Studios reported that they were considering a race designer for players, but ultimately this feature was not added. The finished game was released to retailers on May 18, with full distribution completed by May 27.

&quot;Midtown Madness&quot; is distinct from other racing games of its time, especially those influenced by the &quot;Need for Speed&quot; series, in providing an open environment rather than a closed circuit. Project director Clinton Keith said that an open world makes the gameplay more diverse and adds &quot;element[s] of discovery&quot; such as finding shortcuts. Gary Whitta described the game as open world racing: &quot;[Y]ou still have checkpoints to hit, [but] you don&#x27;t have to follow the A-B-C-D standard to do it&quot;.

== Reception ==

The game received favorable reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. The &quot;IGN&quot; review noted that the game &quot;doesn&#x27;t rely heavily on driving authenticity; this game&#x27;s all about fun.&quot; The review also praised the simplicity whereby players can &quot;pick a real-world car and go.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s reviewer wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s fun to be able to drive like a maniac [...] because you know you can&#x27;t in real life.&quot; &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;″ review remarked on the game&#x27;s humor, provided by other drivers, police, and competitors (described as maniacs), praising the &quot;carnage that unfolds before your windscreen.&quot; &quot;PC Zone&quot;″s Steve Hill recommended the game, calling it highly refreshing; &quot;Total Video Games&quot; reviewer said the game seemed a good choice, but suggested that it would be outdone by GT Interactive&#x27;s &quot;Driver&quot;, released soon after. The &quot;AllGame&quot; reviewer called it a &quot;must-buy for the driving game enthusiast&quot; and said that it would also appeal to players who are not necessarily fans of the racing car genre. &quot;Next Generation Magazine&quot; concluded its review by stating that &quot;Midtown Madness&quot; was not innovative, but that &quot;it&#x27;ll stay on your hard drive for a while and keep you playing.&quot;

&quot;IGN&quot;″s Tal Blevins gave high marks to the game&#x27;s graphics, saying that &quot;the downtown portion of Chicago is portrayed very accurately&quot; even though other parts of the city looked more generic. &quot;Next Generation Magazine&quot;″s reviewer said the graphics were impressive and praised the &quot;thoroughly detailed&quot; random occurrences of &quot;cars hurtling in front of you&quot; and &quot;cringing pedestrians when you lurch onto the sidewalks&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s reviewer approved of the variety in third-person, the first-person dashboard, and the widescreen driving views. However, they complained of the game suffering from &quot;choppy frame rates&quot; and unconvincing visual effects.
&quot;PC Zone&quot;″&#x27;s Hill praised Angel Studios for avoiding gimmicks, instead presenting &quot;accurately modeled cars and a meticulously recreated city&quot; to the player. &quot;AllGame&quot;″s review said &quot;Midtown Madness&quot; &quot;possesses superb, immersive graphics&quot;, using the different times of day and weather as an example. Conversely, it complained that cars not controlled by the player were lacking in detail. Randell said that as well as being &quot;structurally and visually consistent&quot;, the Chicago setting in &quot;Midtown Madness&quot; was &quot;brought to life&quot;—for instance, a &quot;city bus legitimately pulling out at a four-way junction&quot; can end the race for a player by destroying their car. Total Video Games&#x27; review called the game&#x27;s presentation &quot;far from optimal&quot; even with the recommended system requirements. Reviewer Noel Brady pointed out &quot;a serious lack of detail&quot; and called the screen &quot;blocky&quot;, especially without a graphics card. He was critical of the AI, declaring that cars often drive &quot;without noticing [the player] at all&quot;. In his book &quot;AI Game Engine Programming&quot;, Brian Schwab described &quot;Midtown Madness&quot;″ gameplay as &quot;arcade style&quot; and &quot;fast and loose&quot;, and said the in-game traffic was satisfactory.

&quot;IGN&quot;″s review described the in-game narration as &quot;a nice touch&quot;, but noted some glitches among the otherwise &quot;distinctive engine and horn sounds&quot;. Calling the game&#x27;s sounds exceptional, &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s review praised the variety of car noises such as the back-up beeper for the bus. &quot;PC Zone&quot;″s Hill praised the in-game radio system and the support for external media players. &quot;AllGame&quot;″s review said players &quot;get a dose of reality&quot; with other drivers and pedestrians &quot;hurling insults and exclamations your way&quot;.

The game sold 100,805 copies in the U.S. by April 2000.

The staff of &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; nominated the game for their 1999 Best Racing Game award, which ultimately went to &quot;Re-Volt&quot;. They wrote that the game &quot;lays down a racing milestone by creating a living, breathing 3D city — and then letting you trash it&quot;. It was also a nominee for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s Racing Game of the Year award, and for &quot;CNET Gamecenter&quot;″s &quot;Best Racing Game&quot; award, but lost both of them to &quot;Need for Speed: High Stakes&quot;.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Midtown Madness&quot; spawned a three-title series of the same name, the second entry of which, &quot;Midtown Madness 2&quot;, was developed by Angel Studios and released in September 2000. Another sequel, &quot;Midtown Madness 3&quot;, was developed by Digital Illusions CE for the Xbox and published in June 2003. The games&#x27; most-acclaimed elements were the detailed open-world environment, distinct visual presentation and sophisticated artificial intelligence.

In 2000, Angel Studios and Rockstar Games created &quot;Midnight Club: Street Racing&quot;, a PlayStation 2 video game also featuring open world recreations of urban cities. Its critical and commercial success spawned the &quot;Midnight Club&quot; series of street racing-themed games.

According to PC Gamer the game is abandoned.

<text>A drill instructor is a non-commissioned officer in the armed forces, fire department, or police forces with specific duties that vary by country. Foot drill, military step, and marching are typically taught by drill instructors.

==Australia==

===Australian Army===
In the Australian Army, the staff responsible for training recruits are known as recruit instructors. They teach recruits discipline, fieldcraft, marksmanship, service knowledge and drill.

Each recruit platoon is commanded by recruit instructors, usually consisting of a lieutenant, a sergeant, and up to four instructors of the corporal or bombardier rank. A recruit instructor can be identified by a 1st Recruit Training Battalion colour patch on his or her slouch hat and a small Recruit Instructor badge worn on the right breast pocket, if the position has been held long enough.

Members from all Corps in the Army are eligible to become recruit instructors, including females. Experience as a recruit instructor is often a prerequisite to senior non-commissioned appointments in the military.

===Royal Australian Navy===
In the Royal Australian Navy, there are instructors at HMAS &quot;Cerberus&quot;, where the Recruit School course is held, and HMAS Creswell, where the NEOC (New Entry Officer Course) is held, as well as at ADFA.

Each division is made up of one of the following:
* Divisional officer (a lieutenant)
* Divisional chief petty officer
* Divisional petty officer
* Divisional junior sailor (a leading seaman, who is the class instructor)
* Divisional able seaman (some large divisions may have a few able seamen serving as assistant instructors)

===Australian Federal Police===
In the Australian Federal Police, drill instructors are trained and accredited by the Recognition and Ceremonial team. Each accredited drill instructor wears an AFP pin with the wording &quot;DI&quot; positioned 5mm above their name plate or citations. Drill instructors are also issued with a black coloured Hellweg brand leather basket weave Sam Browne belt and strap. The AFP is the only police agency to formally train and accredit police drill instructors in Australia, with a number of New South Wales Police Force members attached to the NSW Police College holding that qualification.

The Australian Federal Police College at Barton has a non-commissioned officer of sergeant rank holding the position of college sergeant. The college sergeant carries a black pace stick as a badge of office at ceremonial functions and a swagger stick during normal duties.

===New South Wales Police Force===
The New South Wales Police Force has a drill sergeant and a drill constable attached to the NSW Police College at Goulburn. Drill staff are responsible for training recruits in drill. These personnel wear a blue cord to signify being a protocol officer. The senior protocol officer (formally known as protocol and discipline officer), which carries the rank of senior sergeant, is responsible for the coordination of the final week of drill, known as Attestation Week and holds the position of parade sergeant at all Attestation Parades. The senior protocol officer is responsible for dress, bearing and discipline and also is the guardian of NSWPF history, customs, traditions and symbols at the NSW Police College. The senior protocol officer carries a black pace stick with silver fittings and wears a black-coloured Hellweg Brand Sam Browne belt with strap as a badge of office.

===Western Australia Police===
The Western Australian Police Force has a drill sergeant of the rank of sergeant who trains recruits in drill, discipline and other matters. He is also the recruit training manager responsible for overseeing the recruits training, ceremonial graduations, police funerals and other events. He meets regularly with academy executive and is responsible for removing recruits who fail parts of the course. The sergeant carries a pace stick as a badge of office during parades.

==United Kingdom==

===British Army===

In the British Army, the appointment of drill sergeant (DSgt) is limited to the five Foot Guards regiments, the Honourable Artillery Company (HAC), Infantry Training Centre Catterick, London District, and the All-Arms Drill Wing (part of the Army School of Ceremonial, Catterick). Drill sergeants hold the rank of Warrant Officer Class 2. However, any senior NCO conducting drill can be colloquially referred to as a &quot;drill sergeant&quot;.

There are two drill sergeants per battalion (one in the HAC) and they have specific responsibilities for all duties, public or battalion (royal duties, barrack duties etc.). They support the garrison sergeant major (GSM) or regimental sergeant major (RSM) in the formation, practice and execution of these duties, typically running the duties roster, supervising rehearsals, and undertaking the guard mounts, both royal and barrack. They also deputise for the RSM in disciplinary matters.

The London District drill sergeant supports the GSM in the supervision of Trooping the Colour, the State Opening of Parliament, Beating the Retreat and any state visits. He also has responsibility under the GSM for the definition of British Army foot and arms drill.

They can be distinguished from other WO2s by their dress. They have the right to wear Sam Browne belts when in No.2 dress and carry swords (never drawn) on ceremonial duties.

They are the third most senior Warrant Officers within a regimental structure, after the RSM and the regimental quartermaster sergeant (RQMS). The HAC drill sergeant is thus the second most senior Army Reserve soldier in the regiment.

==United States==
Drill instructors in the United States armed forces have different titles in each branch of service. In the United States Air Force, they are known as &quot;Military Training Instructors&quot;, or MTIs. The United States Navy uses Marine Corps drill instructors at their Officer Candidate School, but only chief petty officers and petty officers (1st or 2nd Class) are called &quot;recruit division commanders&quot;, or RDCs at their recruit training. Within the United States Army, drill instructors are given the title of &quot;drill sergeant&quot;. The United States Coast Guard gives the title of &quot;Company Commander&quot; to their drill instructors. The United States Marine Corps is the only branch of the U.S. armed forces where drill instructors are titled as &quot;drill instructors&quot;, although the Marines were the first to call them drill sergeants but in 1971 changed to instructors. Drill instructors are referred to as &quot;sir&quot; or &quot;ma&#x27;am&quot; by recruits within the USAF, USMC, and USCG (for the first few weeks of basic training, until recruits are instructed to refer to their company commanders by their proper rank). Within the USN, recruits must refer to their RDCs by their proper ranks. Recruits in the United States Army must refer to their drill sergeants as &quot;drill sergeant&quot;.

The instruction and indoctrination given by the drill instructors of the various U.S. military branches includes instruction in customs and practices of military life, physical fitness, instruction in the proper execution of military drill, instilling discipline and willingness to immediately obey all lawful orders given by superiors, and oftentimes, basic armed and unarmed combat training.

Drill instructors are held responsible for the welfare, behavior, and military education of the recruits assigned to them on a 24-hour basis throughout the period of initial training, of which the most well known is Basic Training or boot camp. Their responsibilities include areas such as military discipline, physical fitness, and weapons training. The title of drill instructor is a billet independent of rank, to be held by non-commissioned officers who successfully complete the intense training program to earn that title.

The rank held by drill instructors varies by branch:
*&quot;Drill Sergeants&quot; in the United States Army are Sergeants (E-5), Staff Sergeants (E-6), and Sergeants First Class (E-7). Upon promotion to Master Sergeant (E-8), Drill Sergeants are &quot;de-hatted&quot; and removed from drill duty. 
*&quot;Drill instructors&quot; in the United States Marine Corps normally hold the rank of sergeant (E-5) through gunnery sergeant (E-7). Corporals (E-4) are no longer authorized to attend Drill Instructor School and therefore are not authorized to hold the billet of a drill instructor. Successful completion of Drill Instructor School grants the marine an additional MOS (Military Occupational Specialty) designation of 0911, drill instructor.
*&quot;Recruit division commanders&quot; (formerly &quot;Company Commanders&quot;) in the United States Navy are petty officer second class (E-5) through master chief petty officer (E-9).
*&quot;Military training instructors&quot; in the United States Air Force are generally staff sergeants with 2 years time in grade (E-5) through master sergeants (E-7).
*&quot;Company commanders&quot; in the United States Coast Guard are petty officer second class (E-5) through master chief petty officer (E-9).

The arduous nature of drill instructor duty means that such assignments are among the most prestigious carried out by enlisted personnel. Those who become drill instructors are eligible for a variety of military awards, such as the Marine Drill Instructor Ribbon, and the Army&#x27;s Drill Sergeant Identification Badge.

===U.S. Air Force===

Air Force MTIs are non-commissioned officers ranging from staff sergeant (E-5) through master sergeant (E-7). They are trained at the Military Training Instructor School at Lackland AFB in San Antonio, Texas. Course length has changed several times during the last decade, but generally includes a period of assignment to a senior instructor to observe training (called &quot;bird-dogging&quot;). MTIs initially conduct basic training at Lackland Air Force Base as part of the 737th Training Group, but a select few conduct military training at the Officer Training School at Maxwell AFB and at the Air Force Academy during basic cadet training.

Male MTIs are identified by the dark blue campaign hat and female MTIs by the dark blue Australian bush hat. Their usual duty uniform is the Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP), with blue service uniforms worn during certain drill practices and the graduation ceremony. Upon receiving their certification as an instructor, they receive the Air Education and Training Command Instructor badge for wear on the right side of the blue uniform.

MTIs usually begin their tours as &quot;team members&quot; - junior partners of a two-person team. Experienced MTIs becomes &quot;team chiefs&quot; and often work a basic training flight alone when manning shortages occur (especially during summer). MTIs refer to direct recruit training as being &quot;on the street&quot;. At the conclusion of a tour, some MTIs are offered the chance to work in essential support training roles in the basic training course. This includes the combat training portions of the course, classroom academic instruction, and the &quot;confidence&quot; obstacle course.

Unlike the Army, the Air Force uses a different specialist to continue military training during advanced individual or technical training. Military training leaders (MTLs) wear a blue aiguillette on the left shoulder and act in the same capacity as Army drill sergeants during technical training. The aiguillette in various colors is worn by students to indicate leadership roles - green for student flight leaders, yellow for student squadron leaders, and red for squadron student commanders. A white aiguillette is worn by chapel guides, a white and blue rope denotes they are in the Drum and Bugle Corps, and a teal rope is worn by student counselors. At some technical training centers a black aiguillette is worn by members of student honor guards or drill teams.

===U.S. Army===

Historically, the task of the drill sergeant has been intrinsic to good order and discipline and commands respect throughout the Army. Currently, soldiers of appropriate rank (usually staff sergeants and sergeants first class) may volunteer or be centrally selected by U.S. Army Human Resources Command to attend the Drill Sergeant Academy. Those centrally selected are known as &quot;DA Selected&quot; meaning Department of the Army selected. Drill Sergeant School is nine weeks long and consists of mostly the same activities as basic training; drill and ceremony, basic rifle marksmanship, obstacle/confidence courses, field training exercises, training management, and leadership. Certain aspects of the Basic Leader Course are included. Drill Sergeant Candidates are held to the highest standards while going through the school as preparation for their tours of duty. The Drill Sergeant Candidates are treated with a great deal of professionalism and not like recruits. Upon graduation, male drill sergeants wear the World War I campaign hat (nicknamed the &quot;Brown Round&quot;) and female drill sergeants wear the olive drab Australian bush cap.

An army drill sergeant&#x27;s normal tour of duty (called being &quot;on the trail&quot;) is two years with a possible one-year extension. Drill sergeants may be assigned to units that conduct Basic Combat Training (BCT), reception, One-Station Unit Training (OSUT), or Advanced Individual Training (AIT). From 2007 to 2018, drill sergeants were replaced at AIT by AIT platoon sergeants (PSGs); In 2018, the AIT PSG program was discontinued and drill sergeants returned to AIT. Remaining AIT PSGs were &quot;converted&quot;to drill sergeants, earning their campaign hat and Drill Sergeant Identification Badge via a 10-day conversion course. BCT drill sergeants train approximately 11 cycles during their two-year tours. OSUT drill sergeants train recruits for an equivalent of BCT plus an additional number of weeks depending on the Military Occupational Specialty, so their average number of cycles is less than that of a BCT drill sergeant. AIT drill sergeants will train as many cycles as their tour of duty consists of depending on the length of the training. A cycle of 16 weeks would only be about 5 total cycles. The breaks between cycles are extremely short, creating an incredibly demanding environment for drill sergeants. It is not unusual for a cycle to graduate on a Thursday or Friday with new recruits arriving the following Monday or Tuesday. From 2008 to 2018, Drill Sergeants in AIT were replaced with Platoon Sergeants.

Senior drill sergeants are the most senior NCO in a given training platoon, and are ultimately responsible for soldiers within or under their authority. The only NCO more senior to these individuals at the company level is the company&#x27;s first sergeant, the senior enlisted leader and advisor to the company commander.

Successful completion of drill sergeant duty greatly enhances opportunities for promotion. Many of the U.S. Army&#x27;s most senior noncommissioned officers are former drill sergeants.

The army has had a difficult time recruiting drill sergeant volunteers due to recent changes in doctrine and policy, with a recent study by the Department of Defense noting that fewer than 30% of drill sergeant candidates are volunteers. Past drill sergeants enjoyed much autonomy and latitude with which to train recruits and were reputed hands-on disciplinarians. Currently, the army&#x27;s Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) has sought to shift this authority away and has moved closer to what is known as &quot;Schofield&#x27;s Definition of Discipline.&quot; It is now a punishable offense to use demeaning or derogatory terms to refer to recruits or trainees, and terms such as &quot;warrior&quot; or &quot;soldier&quot; are preferable. Additionally, it is a serious offense to punish recruits or trainees with &quot;excessive&quot; physical exercise, now known as hazing.

The United States Drill Sergeant Academy is located in Fort Jackson, South Carolina. This is where all drill sergeants go to complete their drill sergeant training. The academy is led by the commandant and deputy commandant of the Drill Sergeant Academy. The instructors, known as drill sergeant leaders (DSLs) are previously trained and experienced drill sergeants. DSLs are selected very carefully by a panel of current senior drill sergeant leaders, along with the leadership from the academy. DSLs are held to the same high Army standards that new incoming drill sergeants are assessed on and must remain at those standards while instructing at the academy.

===U.S. Marine Corps===


It may be taken offensively by U.S. Marine Corps drill instructors to be referred to as &#x27;drill sergeants&#x27;, which is strictly an army term in the American military, just as marines may take offense to being called &quot;soldiers&quot;. This is considered to be a grievous insult if done intentionally. The only acceptable address of a drill instructor by a recruit is &quot;sir&quot;, &quot;ma&#x27;am&quot; or &quot;(senior) drill instructor (Rank) (last name)&quot;. At Officer Candidates School (OCS), candidates are instructed by drill instructors who have already served a tour at one of the Recruit Depots. Officer candidates address their instructors as &quot;sergeant instructor&quot; (and rank and last name), or &quot;platoon sergeant&quot; (and rank and last name). The OCS platoon sergeant is comparable to the senior drill instructor in an enlisted recruit platoon. In the initial phase of training, officer candidates are trained in almost the same manner, and by the same people, as enlisted Marines, with slight differences reflecting the difference between the responsibilities the candidates will have as second lieutenants and those the recruits will have as junior Marines.

In addition, drill instructors at either E-6 or E-7 also train naval officer candidates at the Navy&#x27;s Officer Candidate School at Officer Training Command Newport, Rhode Island, a holdover from the days when they trained prospective naval aviators at the former Aviation Officer Candidate School (AOCS) at Naval Aviation Schools Command, Pensacola, Florida. Class drill instructors train officer candidates alongside class chief petty officers who have experience training Navy recruits as recruit division commanders (RDCs). Like Marine Corps recruits, navy officer candidates must address drill instructors as &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Ma&#x27;am&quot;, even though the DI is not a commissioned officer.

In the U.S. Marine Corps, candidates for drill instructor school are both volunteers and designates. The Headquarters Marine Corps Special Duty Assignment Team creates a list known as the HSST List. This list has the names of Marines that have been slotted for the different B-Billets and Special Duty Assignments. Once a Marine&#x27;s name comes up on this list, they must either serve the duty or prove that they are unfit for the assignment. The tour of duty is three years and demands the highest moral character and strength. It is the job of the drill instructor to pass these characteristics on to the future of the Corps. This duty is referred to as &quot;Making Marines&quot;, and is one of the most important duties of a Marine&#x27;s career. A drill instructor is directly involved in shaping the future of the United States Marine Corps. Marines report to either Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island in South Carolina or to Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego in California, where they are assigned to Drill Instructor School. Upon graduation, they are assigned to one of the Recruit Training Battalions. Female Marines may now serve on both depots as drill instructors. Since spring 2016, Female drill instructors have begun serving in limited capacity on board Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego. This change took place in the Spring of 2016. Service as a drill instructor is considered a Special Duty Assignment in the Marine Corps (or &quot;B&quot; billet), which is factored into consideration of a Marine&#x27;s eligibility for promotion. A Marine assigned to DI School must have at least a rank of sergeant (E-5), or have been selected for promotion to sergeant.
The school requires DI School students to complete every task recruits are required to do. The typical training day begins around 4:00 a.m. or 0400 on the 24-hour clock (often referred to as &quot;military time&quot; in the US) and ends around 7:30 p.m. or 1930, many times with specific training evaluations and end-of-day cleanups that require even longer days. At the end of each day, DI School students have to practice effective time management in studying for exams, practicing drill, rehearsing the teaching of drill movements verbatim and preparing uniforms all while still making time for intense physical training. The school lasts approximately three months with four classes running throughout the year.

Physical training or &quot;PT&quot; as a unit is conducted at least three times a week, with each session lasting approximately two hours. In addition to warming up, stretching, and calisthenics, students complete the &quot;DI Playground&quot; a circuit course that focuses on enhancing upper body strength. Physical training also prepares the future drill instructors for the Marine Corps Physical Fitness Test which consists of pull-ups, abdominal crunches, and a 3-mile timed run. Since a drill instructor is often required to spend 20 hours a day or more on his or her feet and to move fast at all times, various running sessions are conducted to enhance speed and endurance. Students are led by their squad instructors in ability group runs based on speed, gradually increasing distance and speed throughout the course. Track workouts, formation runs, and fartlek runs are also a staple of the training. Drill and discipline are crucial parts of the Drill Instructor School curriculum.

Every student is continuously evaluated, corrected, and mentored, with special attention paid to the smallest of details, such as the placement of a finger within 1/4 inch of its required location along a trouser seam, angle of the weapon, and positioning of the student in relation to the unit. Required knowledge is constantly taught and evaluated in the form of written exams, practical applications, and inspections. Uniforms are inspected continually, with surprise inspections conducted randomly in addition to the scheduled inspections. The drill instructor is expected to convey the best possible Marine Corps image to recruits and to America and to conduct his/herself to the highest Marine Corps leadership and integrity standards as well as to impart these standards to every recruit they train. Drill instructors take a pledge which consists of the following words: &quot;These recruits are entrusted to my care. I will train them to the best of my ability. I will develop them into smartly disciplined, physically fit, basically trained Marines, thoroughly indoctrinated in love of Corps and country. I will demand of them, and demonstrate by my own example, the highest standards of personal conduct, morality and professional skill.&quot;

Upon completion of Drill Instructor School, drill instructors are assigned to Recruit Training Battalions as junior members (&quot;fourth hats&quot;, &quot;third hats&quot;, &quot;kill hats&quot;, &quot;bobby&quot;, or &quot;bulldogs&quot;) of drill instructor teams. His or her job consists of constant corrections, dispensing punitive &quot;Incentive Training&quot; (IT), and keeping unremitting pressure on recruits to pay attention to details. He or she also teaches and reinforces academic knowledge to recruits. It is his or her duty to command the recruit platoon for initial drill evaluation, in which, in addition to the platoon receiving a score, the drill instructor is evaluated as well. These new drill instructors bear the burden of responsibility for breaking down a recruit&#x27;s sense of self and selfishness, so that the more experienced drill instructors can focus the recruits on selflessness, obedience, and fraternity.

After completing a few 13-week cycles, the drill instructor is moved up to the position of &quot;experienced drill instructor&quot; (EDI), also called the &quot;heavy&quot;, &quot;drill hat&quot; or &quot;J Hat&quot;.

The next step in a drill instructor career is becoming a &quot;senior drill instructor&quot;. Senior drill instructors hold a respected position which is distinguished by the wearing of a black highly polished (patent leather) sword belt instead of a green duty belt. A senior drill instructor is ultimately accountable for the training of the platoon and for the efficiency of his or her assistant drill instructors. Although senior drill instructors are NCOs (sergeants) or staff NCOs, their position in the recruit training platoon is similar to that of a commissioned officer platoon commander in a line platoon. As such, they are further set apart from &quot;junior&quot; drill instructors.

After completing a number of cycles, drill instructors are often assigned to Support Battalion duties outside of recruit-training platoons. Such assignments are referred to as quotas, and include jobs as academic instructors, administrative duties at Recruit Processing (Receiving Barracks, also known as Receiving Company at MCRD San Diego), martial arts instructors, Medical Rehabilitation Platoon (MRP), Physical Conditioning Platoon (PCP), Combat Water Survival Instructors, Field Training Instructors (a.k.a. Black Shirts) [MCRD Parris Island only], and Instructional Training Company Instructors (ITC DI) [MCRD San Diego only].

Some drill instructors choose to do a second tour of duty on the drill field. These volunteers still report to Drill Instructor School, but are referred to as course challengers, and are only required to complete a short refresher course. Multiple tour drill instructors, based on rank and experience, are usually assigned as senior drill instructors, series chief drill instructors (MCRD San Diego) or series gunnery sergeants (MCRD Parris Island), DI school instructors, company first sergeants, or battalion sergeants major.

While in drill instructor status, both male and female DIs wear a World War I campaign hat with their service and utility uniforms.

For their successful service, Marine drill instructors are awarded the Drill Instructor Ribbon. This ribbon is also awarded to other enlisted marines and officers assigned to the recruit training environment, although these billets are recognized as being less directly involved in actually training recruits such as series and company commander/ XO, battalion executive officer, S-3, and commander, and various levels of sergeants major at each depot. At OCS, the ribbon is also awarded to officer candidate company first sergeants, company gunnery sergeants, and platoon commanders.

===U.S. Navy===
In the United States Navy, recruit training is conducted by recruit division commanders (RDCs, formerly company commanders or CCs) at Recruit Training Command Great Lakes, located at Naval Station Great Lakes, in North Chicago, Illinois. RDCs are usually E-6 (petty officer first class), but may be up to a master chief (E-9) and have at least six years time in service and above, who are volunteers that serve a three-year tour at RTC Great Lakes.

After submitting an approved package containing an endorsement from a commanding officer, prospective RDCs attend RDC &quot;C&quot; School located at RTC Great Lakes and are identified by the blue aiguillettes (ropes) they wear on the left shoulder of either their service, dress, or working uniforms. RDC School students typically spend thirteen weeks learning about the duties they will perform as RDCs, including drill and ceremony, classroom instruction, and uniform and compartment maintenance. They undergo routine uniform inspections, where RDC school staff (experienced RDCs) meticulously check for any deficiencies in a student&#x27;s uniform. In addition, RDC School students spend three days a week undergoing physical training. Because of the intense workout periods, some RDC students find themselves unprepared; however, they must be ready to keep up with the recruits, some of them who are much younger or more athletic than they are. According to RDC &quot;C&quot; School staff, PT is the number one reason why some students drop out of the course.

Towards the end of RDC &quot;C&quot; School, RDC students shadow actual RDCs currently commanding a division. At the end of thirteen weeks, they receive their red ropes and badges which set them apart as RDCs. Following graduation and entering their first divisions, senior RDCs mentor these new junior RDCs, who then go on to gain experience with every new division (commonly referred to as a &quot;push&quot;).

In the second year of their three-year tour, RDCs take a break from training divisions and perform other duties on base, including drill evaluations, practical training instruction, teaching classes at RDC &quot;C&quot; School, or Battle Stations 21.

RDC duty is considered a highly prestigious one as it is associated with higher levels of accession into the higher petty officer rates, including chief petty officer. RDC duty also allows Sailors an opportunity to earn the Master Training Specialist designator. At the end of the three-year tour, eligible RDCs receive the Recruit Training Service Ribbon, along with a choice of coast for their next duty stations.

In addition to training recruits at RTC Great Lakes, RDCs at E-7 (chief petty officer) or above who have experience leading recruit divisions train students at Officer Training Command in Newport, Rhode Island, either training prospective naval officers at Officer Candidate School (OCS) as class chief petty officers, alongside Marine Corps drill instructors, or newly commissioned junior officers in the Navy&#x27;s Staff Corps (i.e. JAG, Medical Corps, Nurse Corps, etc.) at the Officer Development School (ODS).

===U.S. Coast Guard===

In the U.S. Coast Guard, company commanders are usually E-5 to E-8 and are special duty volunteers. Candidates attend Company Commander School in Cape May, New Jersey, which is collocated with recruit basic training. Upon completion, candidates then go in front of a board for final approval. Upon becoming a company commander (CC), the Coast Guardsman earns the right to wear the Company Commander Badge.

Coast Guard recruit companies average two or three CCs per, with the newer CCs serving as Assistants to the more experienced Lead CC.

During recent years, Coast Guard company commanders have gone to the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London, CT to train outgoing third class cadets during a week-long evolution called &quot;100th Week&quot;, in which they are once again treated as incoming fourth class cadets by the CCs. The rationale behind this is to remind these cadets of their experiences coming into the academy, and to reinforce the mantra that they must do the things they will eventually demand of incoming Swabs. Later in the week, CCs begin teaching the cadets lessons on leadership. The experience provides third class cadets with invaluable experience they will need in training the new incoming fourth class cadets during Swab Summer.

===Canadian Armed Forces===

The appointment of drill sergeant major (DSM) (French: Sergent-major instructeur (SMI)), is usually held by the most senior master warrant officer of an infantry regiment; an exception being with the Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, where that position is known as the quartermaster sergeant instructor or QMSI

In Basic Military Qualification, the course staff member that is teaching drill for a particular drill class is the &quot;drill instructor&quot; for that class.

==Cultural depiction==
Drill instructors have a reputation as unforgiving s and they are often portrayed as such in popular culture, with two notable examples being Full Metal Jacket, and Forrest Gump.

<doc id="581057" wikidata="Q381044" url="?curid=581057" title="Michael Sandel">
<text>Michael Joseph Sandel (; born March 5, 1953) is an American political philosopher and the Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professor of Government at Harvard University, where his course &quot;Justice&quot; was the university&#x27;s first course to be made freely available online and on television. It has been viewed by tens of millions of people around the world, including in China, where Sandel was named the 2011&#x27;s &quot;most influential foreign figure of the year&quot; (&quot;China Newsweek&quot;). 

He is also known for his critique of John Rawls&#x27; &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; in his first book, &quot;Liberalism and the Limits of Justice&quot; (1982). He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2002.

==Early life and education==
Sandel was born in 1953 into a Jewish family, which moved to Los Angeles when he was thirteen. He was president of his senior class at Palisades High School and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Brandeis University with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in politics in 1975. He received his doctorate from Balliol College, Oxford, in 1985, as a Rhodes Scholar, where he studied under philosopher Charles Taylor.

==Philosophical views==
Sandel subscribes to a certain version of communitarianism (although he is uncomfortable with the label), and in this vein he is perhaps best known for his critique of John Rawls&#x27;s &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;. Rawls&#x27;s argument depends on the assumption of the veil of ignorance, which Sandel argues commits Rawls to a view of people as &quot;unencumbered selves&quot;. Sandel&#x27;s view is that we are by nature encumbered to an extent that makes it impossible even hypothetically to have such a veil.

Some examples of such ties are those with our families, which we do not make by conscious choice but are born with, already attached. Because they are not consciously acquired, it is impossible to separate oneself from such ties. Sandel believes that only a less-restrictive, looser version of the veil of ignorance should be postulated. Criticism such as Sandel&#x27;s inspired Rawls to subsequently argue that his theory of justice was not a &quot;metaphysical&quot; theory but a &quot;political&quot; one, a basis on which an overriding consensus could be formed among individuals and groups with many different moral and political views.

==Teaching==

===Justice===
Sandel joined the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University in 1981. He has taught the Justice course at Harvard University for two decades. More than 15,000 students have taken the course, making it one of the most highly attended in Harvard&#x27;s history. The fall 2007 class was the largest ever at Harvard, with a total of 1,115 students. The fall 2005 course was recorded, and is offered online for students through the Harvard Extension School.

An abridged form of this recording is now a 12-episode TV series, &quot;Justice: What&#x27;s the Right Thing to Do?&quot;, in a co-production of WGBH and Harvard University. Episodes are available on the Justice with Michael Sandel website. There is also an accompanying book, &quot;&quot; and the sourcebook of readings &quot;Justice: A Reader&quot;.

The popularity of the show is attributed to the discussion-oriented format (the Socratic method)—rather than recitation and memorization of facts—and to Sandel&#x27;s engaging style, incorporating context into discussion; for example, he starts one lecture with a discussion of the ethics of ticket scalping.

The BBC broadcast eight 30-minute segments from the series on BBC Four starting on 25 January 2011.

In April 2012, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a three-part series and later podcast presented by Sandel titled &quot;The Public Philosopher&quot;. These followed a format similar to the Justice lectures, this time recorded in front of an audience at the London School of Economics. Across three programs, Sandel debates with the audience whether universities should give preference to students from poorer backgrounds, whether a nurse should be paid more than a banker, and whether it is right to bribe people to be healthy.

=== edX ===
As of 2025, Sandel continues teaching his Justice course on edX.
On April 29, 2013, the philosophy department faculty of San Jose State University addressed an open letter to Sandel protesting the use of MOOCs (massively open online courses) such as his Justice course. Sandel publicly responded: &quot;The worry that the widespread use of online courses will damage departments in public universities facing budgetary pressures is a legitimate concern that deserves serious debate, at edX and throughout higher education. The last thing I want is for my online lectures to be used to undermine faculty colleagues at other institutions.&quot;

=== Other teaching ===
Sandel also co-teaches, with Douglas Melton, the seminar &quot;Ethics and Biotechnology&quot;, which considers the ethical implications of a variety of biotechnological procedures and possibilities.

==Politics==

Sandel&#x27;s politics are &quot;squarely on the left&quot; according to the UK left-leaning newspaper The Guardian in 2020. According to an interviewer: &quot;In 2012, he added intellectual lustre to Ed Miliband’s renewal project for the Labour Party (UK), speaking to that year’s party conference on the moral limits of markets... helped inspire Miliband’s critique of “predatory capitalism”&quot;.

==Authorship==
Sandel is the author of several publications, including &quot;Democracy&#x27;s Discontent&quot; and &quot;Public Philosophy&quot;. In the former, Sandel writes that the discontent takes &quot;the form of inchoate anxieties—a growing sense that we were losing control of the forces that govern our lives, and that the moral fabric of community was unraveling. As the global economy mattered more, the nation-state, traditionally the site of self-government, mattered less. The scale of economic life was exceeding the reach of democratic control&quot;. &quot;Public Philosophy&quot; is a collection of his own previously published essays examining the role of morality and justice in American political life. He offers a commentary on the roles of moral values and civic community in the American electoral process—a much-debated aspect of the 2004 US election cycle and of current political discussion.

Sandel gave the 2009 Reith Lectures on &quot;A New Citizenship&quot; on BBC Radio, addressing the &quot;prospect for a new politics of the common good&quot;. The lectures were delivered in London on May 18, Oxford on May 21, Newcastle upon Tyne on May 26, and Washington, DC, in early June, 2009.

He is also the author of the book &quot;What Money Can&#x27;t Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets&quot; (2012), which argues some desirable things—such as body organs and the right to kill endangered species—should not be traded for cash. In the book, Sandel argues that stimulating a market-oriented approach in people may lead to relaxation or even corruption of their moral values.

In his 2020 book &quot;The Tyranny of Merit&quot; Sandel makes a case for overhauling western neo-liberalism, citing Michael Young&#x27;s work as a precedent (Young popularized the term &quot;meritocracy&quot;), and developing a line of thought shared with Daniel Markovits&#x27;s &quot;The Meritocracy Trap&quot;. Elite institutions including the Ivy League and Wall Street have corrupted our virtue, according to Sandel, and our sense of who deserves power. Ongoing stalled social mobility and increasing inequality are laying bare the crass delusion of the American Dream, and the promise &quot;you can make it if you want and try&quot;. The latter, according to Sandel, is the main culprit of the anger and frustration which brought some Western countries towards populism.

In various reviews of the 2020 book: the Evening Standard headline was: &quot;&quot;Diagnosis but no cure for the ills of an unfair society&quot;, in Kirkus Reviews &quot;Sandel’s proposals for change are less convincing than his deeply considered analysis.&quot;; in the British Education Studies Association: &quot;We must abandon the elitism of the university degree. .. Of course, higher education is a good thing, even ‘a common good’. But the university should return to its role of defining and creating knowledge, not credits&quot;. &quot; 

In the Harvard Magazine review: &quot;&quot;But even if equality of opportunity were attainable, which Sandel doubts, he thinks meritocracy would be neither desirable nor sustainable: even a perfect meritocracy has multiple flaws that make it unjust&quot;.&quot;; The Wall Street Journal headlines: &quot;Review: The Cream Also Rises: The meritocratic ideal makes elites arrogant and threatens communal solidarity. Identity-based policies make the problem worse.&quot;

In 2009, Sandel criticized economist Gary Becker, winner of the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in honor of Alfred Nobel for his market immigration proposal. 

==Personal life==

Sandel is married to fellow Harvard professor Kiku Adatto.

==Public service==
Sandel served on the George W. Bush administration&#x27;s President&#x27;s Council on Bioethics.

<text>The Dodge Daytona is an automobile which was produced by the Chrysler Corporation under their Dodge division from 1984 until 1993. It was a front-wheel drive hatchback based on the Chrysler G platform, which was derived from the Chrysler K platform. The Chrysler Laser was an upscale rebadged version of the Daytona. The Daytona was restyled for 1987, and again for 1992. It replaced the Mitsubishi Galant-based Challenger, and slotted between the Charger and the Conquest. The Daytona was replaced by the 1995 Dodge Avenger, which was built by Mitsubishi Motors. The Daytona derives its name mainly from the Dodge Charger Daytona, which itself was named after the Daytona 500 race in Daytona Beach, Florida.

==History==
The Daytona originally used the 2.2 L Chrysler K engine in naturally aspirated or turbocharged form. Power outputs are respectively. The , 2.5-litre K engine was added for 1986. In 1985, the 2.2-L Turbo I engine&#x27;s horsepower was increased to . The 1984 Daytona was available in three trim lines: standard, Turbo and Turbo Z. Total production was 49,347. The Daytona Turbo was on &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s 10Best list for 1984. Both the Daytona and Chrysler Laser were available with the Chrysler electronic voice alert system through 1987. A performance oriented &quot;Shelby&quot; version of the Daytona was introduced in 1987.

===1984===
The Daytona debuted with a 142 hp Turbo I motor. Many Turbo Z models were produced and were more luxurious than other years due to their use of Mark Cross leather, light up speakers, and rear amplifier switches. These options were dropped after 1984.

===1985===
Changes were minimal for the Daytona&#x27;s second year of production. The Turbo Z model was no longer listed as a package but was now a model in its own right. The wraparound spoiler, formerly exclusive to the Turbo Z model, was now offered on all three models. But the biggest change was under the hood: the 2.2 Turbo was given four more hp to 146 hp (109 kW), and a new shift linkage was added. Optional &quot;Swiss cheese&quot; wheels were replaced with new optional &quot;pizza&quot; wheels. All wheels now had five lug nuts (instead of four). Total production was 47,519.

===1986===

There were several changes for the 1986 Daytona. The middle &quot;Turbo&quot; model was dropped, leaving only two models, the base and Turbo Z. Engine changes were also made, including a new 2.5 L 100 hp (75 kW) four-cylinder engine for the base model. A new T-roof package was added to the option list, and 5,984 Daytona owners chose this option. The biggest addition was the C/S (Carroll Shelby) suspension package, available only as an option on the Turbo Z. This consisted of front and rear anti-sway bars, performance tuned struts, and 225/50VR15 Goodyear Eagle Gatorback tires. This package would foreshadow the Daytona Shelby of 1987 and beyond. Some 7,704 owners added this handling package to their Daytonas. Total production this year was 44,366.

===1987–1988===
For 1987, the Daytona was restyled externally, and featured pop-up headlights. New in 1987 was a &quot;Shelby Z&quot; trim level with an available Chrysler developed Turbo II intercooled version of the 2.2 L Chrysler K engine, as well as a heavy-duty A555 transaxle with Getrag gears. The engine produces and of torque. The Shelby Z also featured numerous suspension upgrades, including a larger diameter front sway bar and disc brakes on all four wheels. This version was sold in Europe under the name &quot;Chrysler GS Turbo II&quot;. A more luxury-oriented &quot;Pacifica&quot; trim line was also added to replace the Chrysler Laser, which was dropped in mid-year 1986. Among the optional equipment was a leather interior, eight-way power enthusiast driver&#x27;s seat (with mechanical thigh and lumbar controls), digital-instrument cluster, and a twelve-button trip computer (with instant fuel ratings as well as trip averages and estimated-travel times). In 1988, the C/S package was revived. However, this time the C/S was only available on the base-model Daytona. In order to reduce weight and produce a lighter Daytona, the C/S came without the ground effects and other features that were on the Shelby. The AGB model C/S had a Turbo I 2.2 L engine, which was available with either an automatic or manual transmission.

====Decepzione====
Following the Chrysler takeover of Lamborghini, product programs general manager Jack Stavana introduced a program to fit a Lamborghini Jalpa V8 into a Daytona. The motor was linked to an all-wheel drive (AWD) system designed by Lotus UK and the car was called the &quot;Decepzione&quot;. Despite its performance and media buzz generated by articles in &quot;Automobile&quot; magazine, the project was discontinued because of the engine&#x27;s oil pan having just of ground clearance, necessitated by the comparatively tall engine block.

===1989–1991===

For the 1989 model year, the ES model was introduced. The ES model was an appearance package/equipment group offered on base models in order to attract the &quot;average&quot; Daytona buyer’s eye without a major price hike. It featured silver contrasting ground effects, along with &quot;snowflake&quot; patterned alloy wheels. The 2.2 L Turbo I was replaced with the 2.5 L Turbo I, rated at 150 hp and 180 ft. lbs. of torque. Also introduced in 1989 was the AGS C/S Competition model, which was featured along with the regular AGB model. This new C/S model featured an intercooled 2.2 L Turbo II engine, along with many other features that were also on the Shelby. However, this model was only available with a manual transmission. The AGS C/S package would remain in availability until 1991. The AGB C/S Performance model had the 2.5 L non-intercooled Turbo I engine available with five-speed manual or three-speed automatic. A driver&#x27;s side airbag was standard on the US-market models, optional on Canadian-market models. 

For 1990, all Daytonas received an interior restyling, featuring a modernized cockpit-style wraparound dashboard. A variable nozzle turbocharger (&quot;VNT Turbo IV&quot;), borrowed from the 1989 Shelby CSX VNT, was offered in the Shelby model producing the same as the Turbo II but eliminated turbo lag and improved drivability. Also for 1990, a 3.0 L SOHC Mitsubishi V6 was made available. 

For 1991, the 2.2 L turbocharged engine was dropped in favor of the new 2.5 L &quot;high torque&quot; turbocharged engine. Although sporting a lesser power output of 152 hp, this engine offered 210 ft. lbs. of torque, exceeding that of the Turbo II. Also new was the addition of an &quot;IROC&quot; model with either the 3.0 L V6 or turbocharged 2.5 L engine. Visually, IROC models differed from lesser models, having a ground effects kit and alloy wheels, among other differences. The IROC decals where added in halfway through 1991 even though all Shelby Daytonas from 1991 were considered to be IROCs. There is no difference between a 1991 Shelby and an IROC besides the decals and the letter &quot;J&quot; in the VIN sequence; on 1991 Daytona Shelbys, the VIN has the sequence &quot;G74J&quot; and IROC models have the sequence &quot;G743&quot;.

===1992–1993===

For the 1992 model year, production was moved from the St. Louis, Missouri plant to the Sterling Heights, Michigan plant. The Daytona also received a thorough facelift, which was previewed by the Dodge Daytona R/T concept introduced two years earlier in 1990. The facelift replaced the pop-up headlights with flush-mounted rounded ones and added a new grille and rear fascia. Window surround moldings on the doors were also new, and rounder than the sharp angles of the moldings on 1984 to 1991 models. The 1992 model also displayed the new Dodge &quot;ram head&quot; emblem on the hood and below the taillights. While the 3.0 L V6 became an option on lower end models, it was the standard engine on IROC models. Optional on the 1992 IROC was the 2.5 L &quot;High Torque&quot; Turbo, available as a very rare option (less than 230 produced). Also available on the IROC was the new &quot;R/T&quot; performance package, which featured a &quot;Turbo III&quot; version of the 2.2 L four-cylinder, but with a Lotus designed DOHC cylinder head and direct ignition system instead of a distributor-type ignition system; this engine was shared with the Dodge Spirit R/T. Although the Shelby trim was discontinued after 1991 (due to the end of Carroll Shelby&#x27;s involvement with Chrysler), a small number of 1992 Daytona IROCs were produced bearing the Shelby name. These IROCs featured &quot;Shelby&quot; decals which were added at the dealership or later to help boost sales. All were 2.5 Turbo cars as they featured the Shelby Performance Package sales code. These were superseded by the IROC package. Shelby versions were mainly &quot;Chrysler&quot; branded Daytonas which were sold overseas and were part of an early run of IROCs. These were the last production vehicles produced by Chrysler to bear the Shelby name. Production of the Daytona ended on February 26, 1993 without an immediate replacement. The 1995 Dodge Avenger eventually took the Daytona&#x27;s place.

Production Figures:
== Chrysler Laser ==
The Chrysler Laser was billed as the Chrysler brand&#x27;s first sports car, while the 1950s and 1960s Chrysler 300 letter series coupes and convertibles were very powerful and fast at the time. The Laser was a virtual clone of the Dodge Daytona, but came only in the upscale trim version. It was produced from 1984 to 1986. The Laser emphasized European luxury, and was intended to be an &quot;executive personal luxury coupe&quot;. The Laser was sleek, low-slung, and aerodynamic, with a drag coefficient of 0.35. The car had a large rear hatchback, with a rear deck-lid spoiler. The 1984 Laser was available in two trim lines: standard and XE. In mid-1985, the XT trim was added as the top-of-the-line version. The standard, XE and XT trim lines would continue until the Laser’s demise in mid-1986. After 1986, the Daytona was exported to Canada as the &quot;Chrysler Daytona&quot;, officially ending Canadian Daytona sales under the Dodge marque. The turbo version of the Laser could be recognized by its use of black hood louvers. The 2.2 L Turbo I engine was available as standard equipment in the XE and XT trim lines and optional on the standard model. The Laser was replaced by the Mitsubishi built Chrysler Conquest, a rear-wheel drive vehicle which competed directly against the Toyota Celica Supra. The Laser name was silently terminated after the first half of 1986 model year, then resurrected for the 1990 model year as the Plymouth Laser, built by Diamond Star Motors, a joint venture between Chrysler and Mitsubishi. The rebranded Laser shared its body and chassis with the Eagle Talon and Mitsubishi Eclipse.

In 1987, the Chrysler LeBaron coupe was restyled as a more proper sports car, removing Chrysler&#x27;s need for the Laser. However, the Laser’s luxury performance image would be carried over into the 1987 Dodge Daytona Pacifica as well as the Lancer Pacifica and other Dodge vehicles styled by Chrysler&#x27;s Pacifica Studios.

The Laser was specified to have an estimated city/ highway fuel mileage. Chrysler offered a five-year or warranty, or a protection plan with outer body rust-through protection, based on United States Automobile Club tests. Mark Cross leather seats and a six-way power option were available as options.

Notable features of the Chrysler Laser XE included: 
*A dashboard with digital readouts for the speedometer, tachometer, odometer, temperature, oil pressure, voltage, and fuel
*An electronic monitoring system situated near the top of the center console. This monitoring system checked 22 separate functions on the car, such as an open door, low fuel, or a blown taillight, and would give a digital readout of the situation, along with an audio message produced by a synthesized voice.
*An electronic navigator, which would give information on fuel mileage, miles traveled, distance to destination, and elapsed driving time

===Production numbers===
*1984 - 59,858 (Laser- 33,976/Laser XE- 25,882)
*1985 - 50,866 (Laser- 29,221/Laser XE- 18,193/Laser XT- 3,452)
*1986 - 36,672 (Laser- 14,134/Laser XE- 15,549/Laser XT- 6,989)

<doc id="581060" wikidata="Q519930" url="?curid=581060" title="Chia Pet">
<text>Chia Pets are American styled terracotta figurines used to sprout chia, where the chia sprouts grow within a couple of weeks to resemble the animal&#x27;s fur or hair. Moistened chia seeds (&quot;Salvia hispanica&quot;) are applied to a grooved terracotta figurine.

The Chia Pet was marketed and popularized by Joseph Pedott. Pedott first learned about &quot;something called the Chia Pet&quot; being imported from Oaxaca, Mexico, when he attended a housewares show in Chicago in 1977. Negotiating the rights from importer Walter Houston, Pedott began marketing Chia Pets in the US. 

The first Chia Pet was created on September 8, 1977. A trademark registration was filed on Monday, October 17, 1977. They were produced by Pedott&#x27;s San Francisco-based company, Joseph Enterprises, Inc., which was purchased by National Entertainment Collectibles Association in 2018. They achieved popularity in the 1980s following the 1982 release of a ram, the first widely distributed Chia Pet. Originally made in Mexico, Chia Pets are now produced in China.

The catchphrase sung in the TV commercial as the plant grows in time lapse is &quot;Ch-ch-ch-chia!&quot; This catchphrase originated at an agency brainstorming meeting, where one of the individuals present pretended to stutter the product name. As of 2019, approximately 15 million Chia Pets were sold annually with most sales during the holiday season. In 2000, a Chia Pet was included inside a New York Times time capsule to be opened in the year 3000.

A range of generic animals has been produced, including a turtle, pig, puppy, kitten, frog, and hippopotamus. Cartoon characters have also been licensed, including Garfield, Scooby-Doo, Looney Tunes, Shrek, The Simpsons, and SpongeBob. Additionally, there are Chia Pets depicting real people, including Barack Obama and Bob Ross.

<text>The Engine Alliance (EA) is an American aircraft engine manufacturer based in East Hartford, Connecticut. The company is a 50/50 joint venture between GE Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney, a subsidiary of RTX. Engine Alliance was established in August 1996 to develop, manufacture, sell, and support a family of aircraft engines for new high-capacity, long-range aircraft.

The main application for such an engine, the GP7100, was originally for the Boeing 747-500/600X projects, before these were cancelled due to lack of demand from airlines.

Instead, the GP7000 has been re-optimized for use on the Airbus A380 superjumbo. In that market it competed with the Rolls-Royce Trent 900, the launch engine for the aircraft. The two EA variants are the GP7270 and the GP7277.

On September 30, 2017, an Engine Alliance GP7270 engine suffered from an uncontained failure during the passenger flight of Air France Flight 66.

<doc id="581065" wikidata="Q6123576" url="?curid=581065" title="Kelley School of Business">
<text>The Kelley School of Business (KSB) is an undergraduate and graduate business school for Indiana University Bloomington and Indiana University Indianapolis. As of 2022, approximately 13,538 full-time undergraduate and graduate students are enrolled on its Bloomington campus, as well as 1,596 students at the Indianapolis campus. In addition, more than 800 students study for graduate degrees through the school&#x27;s online MBA and MS programs through &quot;Kelley Direct&quot;. 

As of 2025, Kelley School of Business has more than 133,000 alumni worldwide across 105 countries and on five continents. 

== History ==
The school was established as &quot;School of Commerce and Finance&quot; of Indiana University in 1920. It was subsequently renamed &quot;School of Business Administration&quot; in 1933 and &quot;School of Business&quot; in 1938. In 1997, it was named &quot;Kelley School of Business&quot; after its alumnus E.W. Kelley, chairman of the Steak &#x27;n Shake Company, who had given a donation of $23 million.

Initially, it was housed in the Commerce Building constructed in 1923 (William A. Rawles Hall since 1971), moving to the Business and Economics Building in 1940 (called Woodburn Hall since 1971), and finally to today&#x27;s Business School building in 1966.

Although classes had been held in Indianapolis since 1961, it wasn&#x27;t until the fall of 1974 that the Kelley School of Business officially expanded to Indianapolis. It resides in the Business/Spea building on the IUI campus. During the expansion, it was said that the Kelley School of Business is &quot;one school, one faculty, one curriculum in two locations&quot;. Therefore, rankings which apply to the school&#x27;s Bloomington campus, also apply to its Indianapolis campus (for the programs they both share). The dean&#x27;s office is located on the Bloomington campus, but two positions, Executive Associate Dean - Indianapolis and Associate Dean of Indianapolis Research and Programs, were created to lead the Kelley School of Business curriculum, faculty and programs at IUPUI.

===21st century===
Completed in 2003, the $33 million Graduate and Executive Education Center provides facilities to the Kelley School&#x27;s graduate and executive education students.

In 2003, the Kelley School partnered with the Scotts Miracle-Gro Company to launch Bloomington Brands, a unique brand management work-study program for both undergraduates and MBA students. Participating students manage the Osmocote Plant Food brand under contract from Scotts. Bob Stohler, a former Scotts executive, instructs and oversees the students. Students manage all marketing variables for the Osmocote brand, including the selection of product formulas, sizes, packages, and pricing, as well as the development of marketing strategy, advertising, media purchase and selection, promotional activities, and consumer research. Brands students work closely with multiple business functions at Scotts.

In the summer of 2005, interim Dean Dan Smith was appointed to be the new dean of the school, replacing Dean Dan Dalton who stepped down in 2004.
On March 30, 2012, the Kelley School renamed its Undergraduate Building Hodge Hall in honor of James R. Hodge who had given $15 million to help renovate and expand the facility. The $60 million expansion and renovation of Hodge Hall broke ground in May 2012 and opened in the fall of 2014. The Eli Lilly Foundation donated a substantial amount as well.

In June 2012, Dan Smith stepped down as dean of the school after serving as dean for seven years to take a new position as president and CEO of the Indiana University Foundation. On May 9, 2013, interim dean Idalene Kesner was announced as the new dean of the school. Kesner is the first woman to serve as dean

In February 2025, it was announced that Kelley accounting department faculty member, accounting professor, and current vice dean Patrick E. Hopkins would be taking over from Ash Soni as the dean of the Kelley School of Business, effective March 17, 2025.

===Partnerships===
The Kelley School has partnered with National Football League Players Association, Women&#x27;s National Basketball Players Association, MLS Players Association, Major League Baseball Players Association and United States Rugby Players Association to pursue master&#x27;s program for professional athletes.

<text>Nintendo Selects (and its predecessor, Player&#x27;s Choice) was a marketing label previously used by Nintendo to promote best-selling video games on Nintendo game consoles. &quot;Nintendo Selects&quot; titles were sold at a lower price point (usually $19.99 instead of $49.99) than new releases. The program paralleled other budget range software by Sega (Sega All Stars), Sony (the Greatest Hits and Essentials), and Microsoft (Platinum Hits and Xbox Classics) to promote best-selling games on their consoles as well. In Japan, the discount label was introduced in 2015 for various Nintendo 3DS titles as the Happy Price Selection, although South Korea adopted the Nintendo Selects name at an earlier period. The most recent Nintendo Selects titles were released for the Wii U and 3DS and, as of January 2025, no Nintendo Switch games have been rebranded as Nintendo Selects.

== History ==
=== 1996–2010: Player&#x27;s Choice ===
In North America and Europe, Nintendo introduced the label on May 20, 1996, as &quot;Player&#x27;s Choice&quot; both for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and for the Game Boy to distinguish titles that had sold over one million copies. Super NES games had the &quot;Super Nintendo Entertainment System&quot; wordmark written in gold (instead of the usual red) on the box, along with a &quot;Player&#x27;s Choice&quot; seal. European SNES and Game Boy releases were labeled differently in various markets (such as Mario Classics in Spain, Nintendo Classics in UK and Netherlands, and (Super) Classic Series Germany and France), comparing closer to the European version of the Classic Series label for the NES games, featuring the same Mario medal. Furthermore, all boxes were overhauled in red except Disney games, which received blue boxes. North American NTSC &quot;Player&#x27;s Choice&quot; games can be identified on the Nintendo 64 by the yellow background of the N64 logo in the upper right corner of the game box. On the GameCube and Game Boy Advance, games are marked in a yellow box on the top of the case. PAL region Player&#x27;s Choice games have boxes that are colored silver or platinum with Player&#x27;s Choice markings on the right hand side of a Nintendo 64 box or on the top of a GameCube box.

The Player&#x27;s Choice line was introduced for GameCube titles in January 2003. However, the sales barrier for games was decreased from 1 million, down to 450,000 by June 2003 and eventually only 250,000. The first titles were &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, &quot;Pikmin&quot;, and &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot;, and they each retailed for US$29.99. Later in the year, when six new titles were added, Nintendo split the pricing for different sets of GameCube games, so that some titles would enter in or stay at US$29.99 while others would be reduced immediately to US$19.99.
In April 2006, the &quot;Player&#x27;s Choice&quot; label was applied to Game Boy Advance games, which sell for $19.99 in the United States.

=== 2011–2016: Nintendo Selects ===
The Player&#x27;s Choice label was renamed Nintendo Selects in May 2011. The first Wii games added were &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess&quot;, &quot;Animal Crossing: City Folk&quot;, &quot;Mario Super Sluggers&quot; and &quot;Wii Sports&quot;. The New Play Control! version of &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; debuted in North America as a Nintendo Selects title, alongside New Play Control! &quot;Mario Power Tennis&quot;. &quot;Mario Party 8&quot; and &quot;Wii Sports Resort&quot; were added to Nintendo Selects line in 2013 in UK. These launches coincided with the Wii Mini launch, on March 22. &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;, &quot;Mario Kart Wii&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess&quot; and &quot;Wii Sports + Wii Sports Resort&quot; were added to the new Nintendo Selects Australian line, priced at AU$49.95 and NZ$59.95 with the release date of November 7, 2013.

As of 2014, recommended retail prices are £19.99 in the United Kingdom, US$19.99 in the United States, CDN$19.99 in Canada, A$49.95 in Australia and €29.99 throughout the Eurozone.

In 2015, Nintendo of Europe began to release Nintendo Selects range of games for the Nintendo 3DS. The label was then expanded to the Wii U alongside select Wii and Nintendo 3DS titles in Canada, released on March 11, 2016, priced at CA$29.99. A range of Nintendo Selects titles was launched the following month in Europe.

<text>The Engine Alliance GP7000 is a turbofan jet engine manufactured by Engine Alliance, a joint venture between General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney. It is one of the powerplant options available for the Airbus A380, along with the Rolls-Royce Trent 900.

==Design and development==

Originally intended to power Boeing Commercial Airplanes&#x27; cancelled 747-500X/-600X, the engine has since been pushed for Airbus&#x27; A380-800 superjumbo. It is built around an 0.72 scale of the GE90-110B/115B core and contains a Pratt &amp; Whitney fan and low-pressure system design.

The competing Rolls-Royce Trent 900 was named as the lead engine for the then-named A3XX in 1996 and was initially selected by almost all A380 customers. However, the GE/PW engine increased its share of the A380 engine market to the point where, as of September 2007, it will power 47% of the super-jumbo fleet. This disparity in sales was resolved in a single transaction, with Emirates&#x27; order of 55 GP7000-powered A380-800s, comprising over one quarter of A380 sales (as of September 2007). Emirates has traditionally been a Rolls-Royce customer. A380 aircraft powered by the GP7000s will have A380-86X model numbers as 6 is the code for Engine Alliance engines. The engine powers an estimated 60% of Airbus A380 in service as reported in 2017.

Ground testing of the engine began in April 2004 and was first flight tested as the number two engine on GE&#x27;s 747 flying testbed over Victorville, CA in December 2004. 
The American Federal Aviation Administration certified the engine for commercial operation on January 4, 2006.
The engine was ground run for the first time on an A380 on August 14, 2006, in Toulouse.
On August 25, 2006, the same aircraft, A380-861 test aircraft (MSN 009), made the first flight of an Engine Alliance powered A380. The flight began and ended at Toulouse and lasted about four hours. Tests were performed on the engines&#x27; flight envelope, cruise speed, and handling. A day earlier, the same aircraft performed rejected takeoff tests on the engines.

The Engine Alliance offered the GP7200 for the Airbus A380 passenger and freighter configurations. The GP7270 is rated at of thrust whilst the GP7277 is rated at . The engine is offered with two ratings appropriate for the various A380 configurations and take-off weights: GP7270 for the 560-tonne variant, and GP7277 for the 590 tonne A380-800 freighter (which was subsequently cancelled by Airbus).
In mid-2011 an upgrade was announced which will lead to a cut in weight for each engine by . The new components come from Volvo Aero.

MTU Aero Engines is a major partner of the programme, with 22.5% share. The German company produces the high-pressure turbine, the low-pressure turbine and the turbine center frame. Safran with 17.5% designs and produces the low-pressure compressor. MDS Aero Support Corporation, a Canadian company, is working hand in hand with MTU to develop next-generation test beds.

MDS in joint cooperation is building the facility to test the next version of this engine in France.

==Variants==
*GP7270 with of thrust. In use by A380-861 of Air France, Etihad Airways, Korean Air, and Qatar Airways, as well as 90 of the 123 A380s ordered by Emirates.
*GP7277 with of thrust. Originally for use on the now-cancelled A380F freighter.

==Applications==
* Airbus A380

==Notable incidents==
On 30 September 2017, Air France Flight 66, an Airbus A380 with registration F-HPJE, suffered an uncontained engine failure during flight where the entire fan module (blades and disc) and nose cowl on its number-four GP7270 engine separated from the engine. The aircraft was flying from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport to Los Angeles International Airport. The aircraft was safely diverted to CFB Goose Bay, Canada. To repatriate the stranded jet, the damaged engine would be replaced and sent back to GE&#x27;s workshop at Cardiff; a replacement engine had to be placed in the same position to balance the weight for takeoff but not operable. The French accident investigation agency BEA, which is conducting the investigation into the incident, released photos of the first engine fan, fan hub and cowling parts being recovered in Greenland.

<text>In mathematics, the plus construction is a method for simplifying the fundamental group of a space without changing its homology and cohomology groups. 

Explicitly, if formula_1 is a based connected CW complex and formula_2 is a perfect normal subgroup of formula_3 then a map formula_4 is called a +-construction relative to formula_2 if formula_6 induces an isomorphism on homology, and formula_2 is the kernel of formula_8.

The plus construction was introduced by , and was used by Daniel Quillen to define algebraic K-theory. Given a perfect normal subgroup of the fundamental group of a connected CW complex formula_1, attach two-cells along loops in formula_1 whose images in the fundamental group generate the subgroup. This operation generally changes the homology of the space, but these changes can be reversed by the addition of three-cells.

The most common application of the plus construction is in algebraic K-theory. If formula_11 is a unital ring, we denote by formula_12 the group of invertible formula_13-by-formula_13 matrices with elements in formula_11. formula_12 embeds in formula_17 by attaching a formula_18 along the diagonal and formula_19s elsewhere. The direct limit of these groups via these maps is denoted formula_20 and its classifying space is denoted formula_21. The plus construction may then be applied to the perfect normal subgroup formula_22 of formula_23, generated by matrices which only differ from the identity matrix in one off-diagonal entry. For formula_24, the formula_13-th homotopy group of the resulting space, formula_26, is isomorphic to the formula_13-th formula_28-group of formula_11, that is, 
: formula_30

<doc id="581077" wikidata="Q3508667" url="?curid=581077" title="Genital piercing">
<text>Genital piercing is a form of body piercing that involves piercing a part of the genitalia, thus creating a suitable place for wearing different types of jewellery. Nevertheless, the term may also be used &quot;pars pro toto&quot; to indicate all body piercings in the area of the anus, perineum, penis, scrotum, and vulva, including piercings such as anal, guiche, and pubic that do not involve perforation of genitalia. Genital piercings can be done regardless of sex, with various forms of piercings available. The main motive is beautification and individualization; in addition, some piercings enhance sexual pleasure by increasing stimulation. Pre-modern genital piercings is most culturally widespread in Southeast Asia, where it has been part of traditional practice since ancient times. Records of genital piercing are found in the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot;.

==History==

The traditional prehistoric and historic practice of genital piercing is most culturally widespread in Southeast Asia (particularly in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, and Myanmar), where the insertion of various kinds of implants into the penis were common until modern times, in addition to other ancient body modifications like tattooing, supercision or circumcision, pearling, ear piercings and ear plugs, gold teeth fillings, teeth filing, teeth blackening, and artificial cranial deformation. The primary purpose of such inserts were to enhance pleasure. The practice also spread to neighboring regions, where scattered references to genital piercings exist, like the South Asian &quot;apadravya&quot;, a male genital piercing that passes vertically through the glans (unlike most Southeast Asian piercings which are inserted horizontally), in the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; (2nd century AD). Other smaller traditions of genital piercings also arose independently in other cultures (like in Central America).

In the Philippines, penile piercings were widely documented by European explorers among the Visayan people. Visayan penile piercings consists of a rod or bar (usually made from gold, brass, tin, or ivory; and often ornamented) called the &quot;tugbuk&quot; or &quot;tudruk&quot; that is inserted horizontally through the glans of the penis. Its ends are attached to the &quot;sakra&quot; (also transcribed as &quot;sacra&quot; or &quot;sagra&quot;), a wheel or half-ring (made from the same material as the &quot;tugbuk&quot;) that goes around the head of the penis, similar to a cock ring. The &quot;sakra&quot; comes in many variants, but is usually ornamented with blunt knobs around the circumference. The ends of the &quot;tugbuk&quot; are then secured to the &quot;sakra&quot; with plugs (also often ornamented). The Italian explorer Antonio Pigafetta who accompanied Ferdinand Magellan in the first circumnavigation of the globe describes the practice as such:

The anonymously-written &quot;Boxer Codex&quot; () also has a similar description:

These piercings were done to boys at an early age. They were meant to enhance sensation and pleasure during sexual activity for both men and women. Notably, Pigafetta describes that it was the women who controlled how the penis with the &quot;sakra&quot; is inserted. Men without penile piercings were reported to be derided by women as &quot;asog&quot; (&quot;impotent&quot; or &quot;effeminate&quot;). The practice was heavily suppressed by the Spanish clergy and eventually lost during the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines, as it was considered by the Spanish clergy to be a &quot;sin of the flesh.&quot;

The &quot;ampallang&quot;, a similar piercing (which also passes horizontally through the glans, but differs in that it is not attached to a ring), is found in different tribes throughout Sarawak and Sabah on the island of Borneo. Genital piercings became first introduced in western countries by ethnographic report, done by explorers such as in the 19th century. The Dutch explorer Anton Willem Nieuwenhuis described in his ethnographic record &quot;In Centraal Borneo: reis van Pontianak naar Samarinda&quot; – documenting his travel through Borneo in 1897 – the procedure of an ampallang piercing:


Piercing the genitals became a short-lived trend at the end of the 19th century, in particular for upper classes of the society: &quot;It was during the Victorian era that the practice of body piercing in the Western world reemerged. Many men and women of the Victorian royalty chose to receive nipple and genital piercings.″

However, the popularity diminished again, with genital piercings becoming rather uncommon in the western world until the second half of the 20th century. In the 1970s, they were introduced to the emerging body modification community by the early piercings pioneers like Jim Ward and Doug Malloy, many of them associated with the legendary piercing studio The Gauntlet in Los Angeles. With the advent of Piercing Fans International Quarterly in 1977, information about genital piercings became available to a wider community. Genital piercings were later sported by the modern primitives movement that developed during the 1980s in the San Francisco Bay Area. Still, only until the 21st century, genital piercing was confined to a body modification subculture.

Just like nipple piercings, genital piercings became increasingly more popular and part of mainstream culture in the second decade of the 21st century, with ″nice and normal″ people endorsing them. Many celebrities such as Christina Aguilera, Fantasia Barrino, Pete Doherty, Janet Jackson, Lenny Kravitz, Katarina Waters, or Pete Wentz, stated that they had or planned to have genital piercings. Genital piercings nowadays have a growing demand, especially in a young adult, college-aged population.

With regard to (female) genital piercings, Marilyn W. Edmunds, adjunct clinical professor at the Johns Hopkins University, stated, &quot;Women with genital piercings are no longer on the social fringe or part of the &#x27;punk&#x27; culture who are experimenting with behaviors that are &#x27;socially provocative.&#x27; Over the past 30 years, genital piercing has become mainstream, and women engage in it for a variety of reasons.&quot;

However, according to Chelsea Bunz, professional piercer from UK, the clearly existing rise in popularity might as well be an effect of more people openly talking about their genital piercings: &quot;I think genital piercing has always been popular – it&#x27;s just discussed more openly these days, which makes it increasingly acceptable to the mainstream. People from all classes and professions have them (...).&quot;

==Motives==

Like body piercings at large, genital piercings are often done for aesthetic reasons and as an expression of personal style. In addition, some (but not all) types of genital piercing increase sensitivity and provide additional stimulation during sexual intercourse or stimulation. According to an Association of Professional Piercers expert report by Elayne Angel, body piercing pioneer, former member of The Gauntlet and inventor of several genital piercings such as the fourchette and the lorum, individual motives and preferences are quite diverse:

=== Aesthetic reasons ===
Motivation can be restricted purely to aesthetic taste. Like all other types of body piercing, genital piercings are decorative, appealing to the people wearing them. Violet Fenn of &quot;Metro&quot; stated, &quot;For me personally, it was sheer aesthetics – I just like how it looks. Even if I was the only person who ever saw my piercing, I’d like it in the same way that I like having painted toenails – something pretty for my own personal pleasure.″

=== Culture and life style ===
==== Traditional cultures ====
In many traditional cultures, these piercings are done as a rite of passage during adolescence and, symbolically and literally, mark the admittance to the adult world and serve as a marker of cultural identity. Similar to religiously motivated circumcision, it may be regarded as a &quot;purification of the flesh&quot; and a common bodily sign to members of the same faith. These traditional meanings of modifying the body were revived in contemporary western society by the modern primitive. Inspired by ethnographic accounts of tribal practices, this subculture adopted genital piercings as a matter of individuation and spirituality.

==== Contemporary western society ====
For most people that seek genital piercings nowaday, a sense of uniqueness and non-conformism prevails. A 2015 study that evaluated a qualitative dataset of 484 self-reports and characteristics of men and women with genital piercings came to the conclusion that:
=== Enhanced pleasure and sensation ===
Additionally, genital piercings can enhance sexual pleasure during masturbation, foreplay and intercourse. While female genital piercings do this only to the women wearing them, male genital piercings can enhance stimulation for both the person wearing the jewelry and their partner by stimulating both the glans of the wearer and the vaginal wall or the anus of the penetrated partner. Due to genital physiology, women seem to gain more sexual pleasure from both, their own as well as her partner&#x27;s genital piercings. 

==== For the sexual partner ====
This effect is in particular reported for piercings passing through the glans penis: the ampallang and apadravya piercing. Women of the Dayak in Sarawak, Borneo prefer men with an ampallang, claiming that intercourse without would be dull:

Paolo Mantegazza stated, &quot;The Dayak women have a right to insist upon the ampallang and if the man does not consent they may seek separation. They say that the embrace without this contrivance is plain rice; with it is rice with salt.&quot;
On another account by the anthropologist Tom Harrisson, who spent much of his life in Borneo and interviewed natives about the traditional ampallang; he stated, &quot;the function of this device is, superficially, to add to the sexual pleasure of the women by stimulating and extending the inner walls of the vagina. It is, in this, in my experience, decidedly successful.&quot;

==== For the pierced person ====
For men, piercings that stimulate the sensitive urethra, either during masturbation or sexual intercourse, increase sensation.
Female genital piercings that are reported to enhance pleasure are the piercings that pass through or close to the clitoris, i.e. the clitoris piercing and the clitoral hood piercing. In an empirical study at the University of South Alabama, the authors reported a positive relationship between vertical clitoral hood piercings and desire, frequency of intercourse, and sexual arousal. However, this might depend on many factors such as placement, jewelry shape, and the individual. The triangle piercing is known to be quite pleasurable by providing stimulation of the underside of the clitoral glans, an area that is usually not stimulated at all.

== Potential health risks ==
Comparable to other piercings, improper hygiene during the piercings process carries the risk of transmitting blood borne diseases and during the healing process it might lead to infection.

Some physicians believe that male genital piercings increase the risk of STI transmission by making safer sex barriers (condoms) less effective. Most professional piercers and body art enthusiasts believe these risks are over-stated or nonexistent. In two surveys, 5%–18% of men with genital piercings reported unspecified &quot;problems using condoms&quot; though it is unclear how many of these men used condoms regularly. There is no conclusive evidence that wearers of genital piercings are more likely to contract sexually transmitted infections.

== Aftercare ==
The time to fully heal a genital piercing varies tremendously, depending on piercing site and individual characteristics: it can range from a week up to six months. Until fully healed, preparations should be made against possible causes of infection, such as proper cleaning on a daily basis. People with fresh piercings should abstain from sexual activity for the first few days and also then should use physical protection barriers such as condoms until the piercing is fully healed.

== Legal considerations ==
Laws in other countries vary. In many European countries, minors are required to bring a signed consent form from or to be escorted by a legal guardian. Even in countries that have no laws regulating genital piercing in minors, many piercers refrain from doing them (since physiological development is not completed in minors). In the United States, it is prohibited to pierce the genitals of persons younger than 18 years.

==Types of genital piercings==

===Male genital piercings===

Possible piercing sites on the male genitalia include the glans, the skin of the penis shaft, the scrotum or the perineum.

====Glans penis====

Piercings through the glans of the penis include the ampallang, which passes horizontally, and the apadravya, that passes vertically through the glans. The Prince Albert piercing is situated on the ventral side (underside) of the penis immediately behind the glans, while the reverse Prince Albert piercing passes through the dorsal (top) side of the glans. The dydoe pierces through the coronal rim of the glans. With the exception of the dydoe, all these piercings traditionally pass through the urethra. This is preferred because healing time and incidence of infection are reduced by the flow of sterile urine.

These piercings provide increased stimulation during intercourse to the male (who is carrying the piercing) as well as to the partner. Piercings through the head, or the glans, are the genital piercings with the best-documented historical evidence.
====Skin of the penis shaft and scrotum====

Foreskin piercing passes through the penile prepuce on the dorsal, ventral or lateral side. It is required that the male is not circumcised. The frenum piercing passes through the penile frenum, a small skin bridge that connects the glans with the shaft skin. This anatomical part is also often missing in circumcised men. The hafada piercing is situated on the skin of the scrotum while a transscrotal piercing travels through it. As an intermediate version between frenulum and hafada, the lorum piercing (&quot;lo&quot;w fren&quot;um&quot;) sits at the point where penis and scrotum connect. The Jacob&#x27;s Ladder is a ladder from frenum to scrotum. The guiche piercing is a body piercing on the perineum. These piercings play a lesser role in adding stimulation and more or less fulfill only a decorative purpose.
===Female genital piercings===
In female individuals as well, various anatomical parts can be suitable for piercings. These include the mons pubis, the clitoral hood, the outer, inner labia and the vulval vestibule (which is the area surrounding the vaginal opening).

====Clitoris and clitoral hood====

The glans of the clitoris itself can be pierced. Since this anatomical part is too small in many cases and is susceptible to nerve damage, this piercing is not very common. In contrast, the clitoral hood piercing is the most common genital piercing for women. It can be applied horizontally and vertically. The deep hood piercing is a variation of the clitoral hood piercing that pass deeper through the clitoral hood. The Isabella piercing passes vertically through the clitoral shaft and is rather complicated to pierce.
====Labia and vulval vestibule====

Labia piercing can be applied to the labia majora or the labia minora. The triangle piercing is located at the ventral end of the labia minora, at the point of transition between labia and clitoral hood. It runs horizontally, partly under the clitoral shaft. The fourchette piercing passes through the dorsal rim of the vulval vestibule. A less common version of the fourchette piercing is the suitcase piercing which can be considered as a deeper version of the fourchette because it enters through the perineum. Also rather uncommon is the Princess Albertina piercing, the female version of the Prince Albert piercing, that passes through the ventral (lower) wall of the urethra.
====Mons pubis====

The Christina piercing is a surface piercing, situated on the upper part of the mons pubis where the outer labia meet. It is similar to the Nefertiti piercing, that can be seen as a combination between vertical clitoral hood piercing and Christina piercing.
===Unisex genital piercings===
Body piercings that do not involve perforation of genitalia but referred to as &quot;genital piercings&quot; by convention can be worn by both males and females. These include the pubic piercing, which is situated above the penis in males and on the mons pubis in females (comparable to the Christina piercing, but horizontally). The guiche piercing passes horizontally through the perineum while the anal piercing passes through the anus.

<doc id="581086" wikidata="Q265823" url="?curid=581086" title="Arete">
<text> () is a concept in ancient Greek thought that refers to &quot;excellence&quot; of any kind—especially a person or thing&#x27;s &quot;full realization of potential or inherent function.&quot; The term may also refer to excellence in &quot;moral virtue.&quot;

The concept was also occasionally personified as a minor goddess, Arete (not to be confused with the mythological Queen Arete), who, together with sister Homonoia, formed the (&quot;Exacters of Justice&quot;).

In its earliest appearance in Greek, this notion of excellence was bound up with the notion of the fulfillment of purpose or function: living up to one&#x27;s potential. A person of is of the highest effectiveness; such a person uses all of their faculties—strength, bravery, and wit—to achieve real results. In the Homeric world, involves all of the abilities and potentialities available to humans. Though particularly associated with &quot;manly&quot; qualities, the Homeric usage of the term was not necessarily gender-specific, as Homer applied the term to both the Greek and Trojan heroes as well as major female figures, such as Penelope, the wife of Greek hero Odysseus. In the Homeric poems, is frequently associated with bravery, but more often with effectiveness.

In some contexts, is explicitly linked with human knowledge, where the expressions &quot;virtue is knowledge&quot; and &quot; is knowledge&quot; are used interchangeably. In this sense, the highest human potential is knowledge, and all other human abilities derive from this central capacity. If is knowledge, the highest human knowledge is &quot;knowledge about knowledge itself&quot;. In this light, the theoretical study of human knowledge, which Aristotle called &quot;contemplation&quot;, is the highest human ability and happiness.

==History==
The ancient Greeks applied the term () to anything: for example, the excellence of a chimney, the excellence of a bull for breeding, and the excellence of a man. The meaning of the word changes depending on what it describes since everything has its own excellence; the of a man is different from the of a horse. This way of thinking originates from Plato, where it can be seen in the Allegory of the Cave. In particular, the aristocratic class was presumed, essentially by definition, to be exemplary of :The root of the word is the same as , the word which shows superlative ability and superiority, and was constantly used in the plural to denote the nobility.By , as applied to men had developed to include quieter virtues, such as (justice) and (self-restraint). Though Plato tried to produce a moral philosophy that incorporated this new usage, it was in the Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle that the doctrine of found its fullest flowering. Aristotle&#x27;s Doctrine of the Mean is a paradigm example of his thinking.

Aristotle deliberated on the various goals of education: including practical skills, , and theory. Educating towards means boys would be educated towards things that are useful in life. However, there is no agreement about what constitutes , which leads to disagreement about how to train students for . To say that has a common definition of excellence or fulfillment may be an overstatement simply because it was very difficult to pinpoint , much less the proper ways to go about obtaining it.

=== Homer ===
In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;, mainly describes heroes and nobles and their mobile dexterity, with special reference to strength and courage, though it is not limited to this. For instance, the excellence of the gods generally included their power, but, in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; (13.42), Odysseus asked the gods to grant the Phaeacians , which here is generally translated as prosperity. Penelope&#x27;s , as another example, relates to co-operation, for which she is praised by Agamemnon. Though associated with &quot;manly&quot; qualities, the Homeric usage of the term was not necessarily gender-specific, as Homer applied the term to major female figures as well as the Greek and Trojan heroes.

The &quot;Odyssey&quot; states that &quot;far-sounding Zeus takes away half the arete of a man, when the day of slavery takes hold of him.&quot;

In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the way Homer describes Achilles is an example of . is associated with the goodness and prowess of a warrior. Debra Hawhee points out that the norms and practices of Athenian virtuosity &quot;operate within the politics of reputation, whose normative poles are honor and shame.&quot; Dying in battle or securing a victory in the Olympic Games were considered (&quot;good&quot;) and, hence, deserving of (&quot;honor&quot;). So, not only is Achilles a brave and brilliant warrior but also, from the outset, he is destined to die in battle at Troy with the utmost glory—a guarantor of .

According to Bernard Knox&#x27;s notes in the Robert Fagles&#x27; translation of &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, &quot;&quot; is also associated with , the Greek word for &quot;pray&quot;.

==Personification==

Arete was occasionally personified as a goddess, the sister of Homonoia (goddess of concord, unanimity, and oneness of mind), and the daughter of Praxidike (goddess of justice). Arete and Homonoia were known jointly as the (&quot;Exacters of Justice&quot;). As with many minor Greek deities, there is little or no real mythical background to Arete, who is used at most as a personification of virtue.

The only surviving story involving Arete was told in by the sophist Prodicus. Known as &quot;Hercules at the crossroads&quot;, it concerns the early life of the hero Heracles. At a crossroads, Arete appeared to Heracles as a young maiden and offered him glory and a life of struggle against evil; her counterpart Kakia () offered him wealth and pleasure. Heracles chose to follow the path of Arete.

This story was later used by Christian writers, such as Methodius of Olympus, Justin Martyr, Clement of Alexandria, and Basil of Caesarea.

==Examples of usage==
* In Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;, Book 2, chapter 6: &quot;Virtue (), then, is a habit or trained faculty of choice, the characteristic of which lies in moderation or observance of the mean relatively to the persons concerned, as determined by reason, i.e., by the reason by which the prudent man would determine it.&quot;
* In the Admonition of Paul in : &quot;Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is pleasing, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence () and if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.&quot;
* Robert Pirsig uses &quot;&quot; as a synonym for &quot;quality&quot; in his book &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;, which includes an extensive discussion of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedrus&quot; and the historical contrast between Dialectic and Rhetoric: &quot;And what is good, Phaedrus, And what is not good—Need we ask anyone to tell us these things?&quot; Pirsig&#x27;s line plays off a line in the Platonic dialogue &quot;The Phaedrus&quot; which reads: &quot;And what is well and what is badly—need we ask Lysias, or any other poet or orator, who ever wrote or will write either a political or any other work, in metre or out of metre, poet or prose writer, to teach us this?&quot;
* In a Pindarian ode inscribed on the base of an Olympian victor&#x27;s statue for the boxer Diagoras of Rhodes: &quot;O father Zeus, give honor to this hymn for a victor at Olympia, and to his now famous in boxing.&quot;
* Arete is the name of a key protagonist in &quot;The Philosopher Kings&quot;, the second book of Jo Walton&#x27;s &quot;Thessaly trilogy&quot; in which a group of people gathered by the time-traveling goddess Athena work to achieve the ideal society as described in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;. She is a precocious teenager who also appears in the sequel. Arete&#x27;s name and its meaning (&quot;excellence&quot;) is a small but important plot point in the book—as well as a general theme of the series as a whole.

=== Athletics ===
 was also used by Plato in his discussion of athletic training and the education of young boys. It was commonly believed that the mind, body, and soul each had to be developed for a man to live a life of . This led to the thought that athletics had to be present in order to obtain . Athletics did not need to occupy one&#x27;s life, but could be used to exercise the body into the right condition for , just as the mind and soul would be exercised by other means.

=== Paideia ===
 is a significant part of the of ancient Greeks: the training of the boy to manhood. This training in included physical training, for which the Greeks developed the ; mental training, which included oratory, rhetoric, and basic sciences; and spiritual training, which included music and what is called virtue.

<text>The Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL), known in its final two seasons as the Major Soccer League, was an indoor soccer league in the United States that played matches from fall 1978 to spring 1992.

==History==
The MISL was founded by businessmen Ed Tepper and Earl Foreman in October 1977.

The league fielded six teams for its inaugural 1978–79 season. Before folding after 14 seasons of competition, at the conclusion of the 1991–92 season, a total of 24 franchises – under 31 team names (seven teams changed city/name) – had played in the MISL.

Over its life, MISL teams were based in 27 different cities – with two different teams, at different times, playing in Cleveland, Ohio; East Rutherford, New Jersey; St. Louis, Missouri; and Uniondale, New York.

The Houston Summit (1978–80)/Baltimore Blast (1980–92) franchise was the only one to compete for the entire 14 seasons of the MISL&#x27;s existence. The next longest-lived franchise, and the longest in a single city, was the Wichita Wings team, which played for 13 seasons and missed only the inaugural 1978–79 season. The third longest-lived franchise was the Detroit Lightning (1979–80)/San Francisco Fog (1980–81)/Kansas City Comets (1981–91) franchise, which played for 12 seasons, missing only the first and last seasons.

The San Diego Sockers was the most successful franchise, winning eight of the MISL&#x27;s 14 overall championships during the team&#x27;s nine seasons in the league. The New York Arrows won the MISL&#x27;s first four championships, then folded after the league&#x27;s sixth season.

The most successful player in the MISL is arguably Steve Zungul, a Yugoslav American striker who was MISL Most Valuable Player six times, was the Scoring Champion six times, the Pass Master (most assists) four times, played on eight championship-winning teams (and one runner-up), and won Championship Series Most Valuable Player four times. Zungul is the MISL&#x27;s all-time leader in goals (652, nearly 200 ahead of the second highest scorer), assists (471, nearly 100 ahead of second) and points (1,123, nearly 300 ahead of second).

Despite ongoing financial hardships, the MISL had some success. The league averaged a respectable 7,644 fans per game over its 14 regular seasons, and averaged 9,049 fans per game over its 14 playoff runs.

The league changed its name to the Major Soccer League (MSL) in 1990, and then folded in 1992. Four of the league&#x27;s seven franchises continued to operate: Cleveland Crunch and Wichita Wings joined the National Professional Soccer League; Dallas Sidekicks and San Diego Sockers helped found the Continental Indoor Soccer League.

===Arena football inspiration===
The concept was initially so popular that in 1981, it helped pave the way for the creation of another indoor sports league, the Arena Football League, and subsequently the entire sport of indoor &quot;gridiron&quot; football. During the MISL All-Star Game at Madison Square Garden, National Football League promotions director Jim Foster sketched a design of what a football field would look like on the back of a 9x12 manila envelope. That inspiration gave birth to the concept now known as arena football (also indoor football) and the AFL was born six years later. Foster credits the MISL for the inspiration.

==Teams==
*Three North American Soccer League (NASL) teams temporarily joined the MISL for the 1982–83 season, as the NASL did not play indoors for that season. As the NASL was folding in 1985, four of its former teams (Chicago, Minnesota, New York and San Diego) joined the MISL in late 1984.

The &quot;Denver Avalanche&quot; had declared bankruptcy and ceased operations after the 1981–82 season, but the franchise still existed and was purchased out of bankruptcy and moved to Tacoma after a dormant season. The MISL, however, considered the Stars a new franchise and, thus, team records did not transfer to Tacoma.

In June 1987, the MISL granted a conditional franchise to NBA Denver Nuggets owner Sidney Shlenker, to commence play in the 1988–89 season. When the tentative &quot;Denver Desperados&quot; attracted deposits on 400 season tickets, rather than the required 5,000 within four months, the franchise was revoked in November 1987.

==Television and radio coverage==
The MISL made inroads on national television in 1982–83. While the spring would see the end of the league&#x27;s two-year deal with the USA Network, CBS would broadcast a playoff game live from Cleveland on May 7 that drew an estimated four million viewers. One game during the 1983–84 season was televised on CBS (Game 3 of the championship series on June 2) as well.

1984–85 would be the final year the MISL would have games aired on network television, CBS broadcast Game 4 of the championship series live on May 25.

<doc id="581091" wikidata="Q779054" url="?curid=581091" title="Auscultation">
<text>Auscultation (based on the Latin verb &quot;auscultare&quot; &quot;to listen&quot;) is listening to the internal sounds of the body, usually using a stethoscope. Auscultation is performed for the purposes of examining the circulatory and respiratory systems (heart and breath sounds), as well as the alimentary canal.

The term was introduced by René Laennec. The act of listening to body sounds for diagnostic purposes has its origin further back in history, possibly as early as Ancient Egypt. Auscultation and palpation go together in physical examination and are alike in that both have ancient roots, both require skill, and both are still important today. Laënnec&#x27;s contributions were refining the procedure, linking sounds with specific pathological changes in the chest, and inventing a suitable instrument (the stethoscope) to mediate between the patient&#x27;s body and the clinician&#x27;s ear.

Auscultation is a skill that requires substantial clinical experience, a fine stethoscope and good listening skills. Health professionals (doctors, nurses, etc.) listen to three main organs and organ systems during auscultation: the heart, the lungs, and the gastrointestinal system. When auscultating the heart, doctors listen for abnormal sounds, including heart murmurs, gallops, and other extra sounds coinciding with heartbeats. Heart rate is also noted. When listening to lungs, breath sounds such as wheezes, crepitations and crackles are identified. The gastrointestinal system is auscultated to note the presence of bowel sounds.

Electronic stethoscopes can be recording devices, and can provide noise reduction and signal enhancement. This is helpful for purposes of telemedicine (remote diagnosis) and teaching. This opened the field to computer-aided auscultation. Ultrasonography (US) inherently provides capability for computer-aided auscultation, and portable US, especially portable echocardiography, replaces some stethoscope auscultation (especially in cardiology), although not nearly all of it (stethoscopes are still essential in basic checkups, listening to bowel sounds, and other primary care contexts).

== Auscultogram ==
The sounds of auscultation can be depicted using symbols to produce an auscultogram. It is used in cardiology training.


== Mediate and immediate auscultation ==
Mediate auscultation is an antiquated medical term for listening (auscultation) to the internal sounds of the body using an instrument (mediate), usually a stethoscope. It is opposed to immediate auscultation, directly placing the ear on the body.

== Doppler auscultation ==

It was demonstrated in the 2000s that Doppler auscultation using a handheld ultrasound transducer enables the auscultation of valvular movements and blood flow sounds that are undetected during cardiac examination with a stethoscope. The Doppler auscultation presented a sensitivity of 84% for the detection of aortic regurgitations, while classic stethoscope auscultation presented a sensitivity of 58%. Moreover, Doppler auscultation was superior in the detection of impaired ventricular relaxation. Since the physics of Doppler auscultation and classic auscultation are different, it has been suggested that both methods could complement each other.

<text>Schweppes ( , ) is a soft drink brand founded in the Republic of Geneva in 1783 by Johann Jacob Schweppe; it is now made, bottled, and distributed worldwide by multiple international conglomerates, depending on licensing and region, that manufacture and sell soft drinks. Schweppes was one of the earliest forms of a soft drink, originally being regular soda water created in 1783. Today, various drinks other than soda water bear the Schweppes brand name, including various types of lemonade and ginger ales.

The company has held the British royal warrant since 1836 and was the official sponsor of Prince Albert&#x27;s Great Exhibition in Hyde Park, London in 1851.

==History==

In the late 18th century, German-Genevan scientist Johann Jacob Schweppe developed a process to manufacture bottled carbonated mineral water based on the discoveries of English chemist Joseph Priestley. Schweppe founded the Schweppes Company in Geneva in 1783 to sell carbonated water. In 1792, he moved to London to develop the business there. Schweppes had offices in Bristol and were selling carbonated Hotwells water in 1820. In 1843, Schweppes commercialised Malvern Water at the Holywell Spring in the Malvern Hills, which was to become a favourite of the British Royal Family until parent company Coca-Cola closed the historic plant in 2010 to local outcry.

In 1969, the Schweppes Company merged with Cadbury to become Cadbury Schweppes. After acquiring many other brands in the ensuing years, the company was split in 2008, with its US beverage unit becoming Keurig Dr Pepper and separated from its global confectionery business (now part of Mondelez International). Keurig Dr Pepper is the current owner of the Schweppes trademark in Canada and United States.

The Coca-Cola Company owns the Schweppes brand in several territories, including 21 European countries. In a further 22 European countries, the brand is owned by Schweppes International Limited (a subsidiary of Suntory).

In China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, Swire&#x27;s subsidiary Swire Coca-Cola produces Schweppes branded beverages.

The Japanese Asahi Group bought Schweppes Australia in 2008 from Cadbury, and owns the trademark in Australia.

Mainstay Schweppes products include ginger ale (1870), bitter lemon (1957), and tonic water (the first carbonated tonic – 1871).

==Marketing==

During the 1920s and 1930s, the artist William Barribal created a range of posters for Schweppes. In 1945, the advertising agency S.T.Garland Advertising Service Ltd., London coined the word &quot;Schweppervescence&quot;, which was first used the following year. Thereafter it was used extensively in advertisements produced by Garlands, who sold copyright of this word to the Schweppes Company for £150 five years later when they relinquished the account.

An ad campaign in the 1950s and 1960s featured a real-life veteran British naval officer named Commander Whitehead, who described the product&#x27;s bubbly flavour (effervescence) as &quot;Schweppervescence&quot;. Comedian Benny Hill also appeared in a series of Schweppes TV commercials in the 1960s.

Another campaign in the 1950s and 1960s, &quot;Schweppeshire&quot;, was written by Stephen Potter, the inventor of gamesmanship.

Another campaign, voiced by British actor William Franklyn, made use of onomatopoeia in their commercials: &quot;Schhh… You know who.&quot; after the sound of the gas escaping as one opens the bottle.

<text>Hardwar (sometimes stylized HardW[a]r or given the full name Hardwar: The Future Is Greedy) is a 1998 science fiction flight simulation computer game developed by The Software Refinery and published by Gremlin Interactive. In the US, the game was distributed by Interplay under license. The box artwork and styling for game was created by The Designers Republic, who also worked on the &quot;Wipeout&quot; series. The soundtrack was provided by artists signed to the Warp Records label. Funbox Media digitally re-released Hardwar via ZOOM-Platform.com on September 17, 2021. Funbox Media and Jordan Freeman Group, the aforementioned ZOOM-Platform.com, would team up again to release a Steam (service) version on February 15, 2023. The Steam (service) edition remained DRM-Free.

The game&#x27;s plot involves warring power groups on Titan, and the player character&#x27;s eventual escape. The world is set inside craters on the moon&#x27;s surface, joined together by a network of tunnels.

==Story==
&quot;Hardwar&quot; places the player in the role of a freelance &quot;Moth&quot; pilot in the city of Misplaced Optimism, a space colony located on Saturn&#x27;s moon, Titan. The colony was once a profitable mining outpost, but the major corporations backed out, leaving the inhabitants without the capability of space travel and a slowly but steadily crumbling infrastructure. During two hundred years of isolation, the remaining corporations became effectively organised crime gangs, with the corrupt and inefficient police force maintaining little law and order.

Things change when an unidentified, apparently alien, ship crash lands in the defunct Port district, causing the two largest corporations - Klamp-G and Lazarus - to rush to take advantage. The player finds themself thrust in to the situation, eventually managing to outrace both corporations to help the aliens repair their ship in return for passage off Titan, to an uncertain, but hopefully better, future.

==Gameplay==
It is at the discretion of the players as to how they will earn their living on Titan. They can trade honestly, having to be wary of pirates. They can choose to hunt Titan&#x27;s outlaws, collecting bounties from the various police stations. Players may also be lowly scavengers like many artificial intelligence (AI) moths, picking at the dropped cargo of panicked traders, or players can become pirates themselves.

Many AI moths flit about with valuable cargo, should the players decide to take this path; however, stolen cargo in the players&#x27; hands can be confiscated by the police, or they could become the target of other outlaws now that they are carrying valuable cargo. Players may attract the unwelcome attention of one of the main factions in the game due to their piracy.

Players are able to buy many of the available hangars around Titan, making storage of goods and repairs much simpler. This also allows them to store extra &quot;Moths&quot; safely in one location, to set up trade facilities in different craters, and purchase and install Clones, to ensure the players&#x27; continuance should they meet an untimely demise in the skies.

Alternatively, players can use a public hangar, such as one of the various businesses around the city to trade and repair their moths.

Players are able to trade goods from their hangar(s), and based on market forces such as supply and demand, as well as distance to the supply, players can set their own prices. Based on how good a deal the players make, AI moths will line up in droves to purchase goods, or fly on by for a better deal elsewhere.

Players can set up manufacturing facilities in their hangars with the purchase of relevant equipment, to turn scrap metal into ship parts, to turn water and chemicals into alcohol, or any number of other products.

==Development==
&quot;Hardwar&quot; was originally scheduled for a 1996 release. &quot;Hardwar&quot; was developed by The Software Refinery and published in 1998 by Gremlin Interactive. In the US, the game was distributed by Interplay. The box artwork and styling for game was created by The Designers Republic, who also worked on the &quot;Wipeout&quot; series. The music was provided by artists signed to Warp Records. Gremlin&#x27;s Mark Mattocks said that it was not a coincidence that Gremlin, Warp, and The Designer&#x27;s Republic were all companies based in Sheffield: &quot;The angle is that this is a collaboration between Sheffield, U.K. companies that are at the top of their industries. We&#x27;ve wanted to work with Warp for a long time, so we looked at two or three projects and picked &quot;Hardwar&quot;.&quot;

Software Refinery was located in the north of England at Leeds, and several locations in the game were named after actual buildings near the company&#x27;s offices. Hardwar&#x27;s designer and producer, Ade Carless, plays the Police &quot;uber-clerk&quot; in several FMV clips, with the GMTV presenter Ben Shephard playing the important role of &quot;Syd&quot;.

In reference to the movie &quot;Hackers&quot;, four of the pilots on the police wanted list are called &quot;Zero Cool&quot;, &quot;Acid Burn&quot;, &quot;Lord Nikon&quot; and &quot;Crash Override&quot;.

As &quot;The Software Refinery&quot; went into voluntary liquidation in 2002, &quot;Hardwar&quot; is no longer officially supported by its developers and the game has not been officially patched or modified since. However, Ian Martin, one of the game&#x27;s developers, did release a series of unofficial patches to the fan community to add additional features and bug fixes not present in the final official release.

==Reception==

Ed Lomas of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; summarized: &quot;Hardwar has a brilliant atmosphere, lots to do, and a great sense of freedom. Just make sure you can put up with the first few slow hours.&quot;

Paul Presley of &quot;PC Zone&quot; said: &quot;In many ways, &quot;Hardwar&quot; is half a game. Or to be precise, half of another, much larger game. If this were the engine driving the ground-based sections of something like, for want of a more recent example, &quot;Elite&quot;, then we&#x27;d probably be looking at the ultimate game here.&quot;

<doc id="581110" wikidata="Q1016574" url="?curid=581110" title="Timaru">
<text>Timaru (; ) is a port city in the southern Canterbury Region of New Zealand, located southwest of Christchurch and about northeast of Dunedin on the eastern Pacific coast of the South Island. The Timaru urban area is home to people, and is the largest urban area in South Canterbury, and the third-largest in the Canterbury Region overall, after Christchurch and Rolleston. The town is the seat of the Timaru District, which includes the surrounding rural area and the towns of Geraldine, Pleasant Point and Temuka, which combined have a total population of .

Caroline Bay beach is a popular recreational area located close to Timaru&#x27;s main centre, just to the north of the substantial port facilities. Beyond Caroline Bay, the industrial suburb of Washdyke is at a major junction with State Highway 8, the main route into the Mackenzie Country. This provides a road link to Pleasant Point, Fairlie, Twizel, Lake Tekapo, Aoraki / Mount Cook and Queenstown.

Timaru has been built on rolling hills created from the lava flows of the extinct Mt Horrible volcano, which last erupted thousands of years ago. The result is that most of the main streets are undulating, a clear contrast with the flat landscape of the Canterbury Plains to the north. This volcanic rock is used for the construction of local &quot;bluestone&quot; buildings.

== History ==
=== Māori settlement ===
The origin of the name &#x27;Timaru&#x27; is disputed. Some believe that it derives from Māori &quot;Te Maru&quot;, which can mean a &#x27;place of shelter&#x27;. However, other authorities allege that Timaru originates from a literal translation of the combination of &quot;tī&quot;, a cabbage tree and &quot;maru&quot;, meaning &#x27;shady&#x27;.

Māori waka seem to have employed the site of Timaru as a place to rest on journeys up and down the eastern coastline for many years before the arrival of the first Europeans in the 19th century. The area includes over 500 sites with traces of Māori rock art, particularly in the rock overhangs and caves of the Opuha and Ōpihi River valleys, to the west of modern-day Timaru. Archaeologists have suggested that Māori iwi (tribes) were permanently settled in the district before 1400 AD. During the 17th or 18th century the resident Ngāti Mamoe were driven southwards into Fiordland by an invasion of the Ngāi Tahu, who came from the North Island.

Te Runanga o Arowhenua is the hapū (subtribe) for Aoraki (Timaru District). Their marae is located just outside Temuka.

== 19th century onwards ==
European settlement began with the construction of a whaling station in 1839 by the Weller brothers of Otago at Patiti Point, close to the present town centre. A supply ship, &quot;The Caroline&quot;, provided the name for a local bay. Later a sheep station, known as &quot;The Levels&quot;, was set up on land obtained by the Rhodes brothers, and run by George Rhodes. One of the earliest settlers was Captain Henry Cain, who set up a store in 1857 on behalf of Henry Le Cren of Lyttelton, and Le Cren himself moved to Timaru in the following year.

Few lived in Timaru until 1859 when the ship SS &quot;Strathallan&quot; arrived from England, carrying a party of 120 immigrants. Persistent land disputes arose between the Rhodes brothers and local government officials with the result that two townships were established in the port area, Government Town and Rhodestown. These eventually merged into a single community in 1868. Given this division, until recently none of the main north-south streets lined up. Stafford Street, which became the main thoroughfare, was formed along the early bullock wagon trail.

Following the loss of a number of vessels off the coast, the breakwater design by Engineer John Goodall was adopted and work started on the redevelopment of the artificial port in 1877, which eventually caused sand washed south down the Pacific shoreline to build up against the northern mole. This was the beginning of the extensive land reclamation around the Caroline Bay district, an area which is still growing today.

Timaru continued to expand during the 20th century, with much of the development taking the form of wooden colonial style bungalows set in individual sections of land. Sacred Heart Basilica was opened in 1911.

<doc id="581124" wikidata="Q1138810" url="?curid=581124" title="Cramér–Rao bound">
<text>In estimation theory and statistics, the Cramér–Rao bound (CRB) relates to estimation of a deterministic (fixed, though unknown) parameter. The result is named in honor of Harald Cramér and Calyampudi Radhakrishna Rao, but has also been derived independently by Maurice Fréchet, Georges Darmois, and by Alexander Aitken and Harold Silverstone. It is also known as Fréchet-Cramér–Rao or Fréchet-Darmois-Cramér-Rao lower bound. It states that the precision of any unbiased estimator is at most the Fisher information; or (equivalently) the reciprocal of the Fisher information is a lower bound on its variance.

An unbiased estimator that achieves this bound is said to be (fully) &quot;efficient&quot;. Such a solution achieves the lowest possible mean squared error among all unbiased methods, and is, therefore, the minimum variance unbiased (MVU) estimator. However, in some cases, no unbiased technique exists which achieves the bound. This may occur either if for any unbiased estimator, there exists another with a strictly smaller variance, or if an MVU estimator exists, but its variance is strictly greater than the inverse of the Fisher information.

The Cramér–Rao bound can also be used to bound the variance of estimators of given bias. In some cases, a biased approach can result in both a variance and a mean squared error that are the unbiased Cramér–Rao lower bound; see estimator bias.

Significant progress over the Cramér–Rao lower bound was proposed by Anil Kumar Bhattacharyya through a series of works, called Bhattacharyya bound.

== Statement ==

The Cramér–Rao bound is stated in this section for several increasingly general cases, beginning with the case in which the parameter is a scalar and its estimator is unbiased. All versions of the bound require certain regularity conditions, which hold for most well-behaved distributions. These conditions are listed later in this section.

=== Scalar unbiased case ===
Suppose formula_1 is an unknown deterministic parameter that is to be estimated from formula_2 independent observations (measurements) of formula_3, each from a distribution according to some probability density function formula_4. The variance of any &quot;unbiased&quot; estimator formula_5 of formula_1 is then bounded by the reciprocal of the Fisher information formula_7:
:formula_8
where the Fisher information formula_7 is defined by
:formula_10

and formula_11 is the natural logarithm of the likelihood function for a single sample formula_3 and formula_13 denotes the expected value with respect to the density formula_4 of formula_15. If not indicated, in what follows, the expectation is taken with respect to formula_15.

If formula_17 is twice differentiable and certain regularity conditions hold, then the Fisher information can also be defined as follows: 

:formula_18

The efficiency of an unbiased estimator formula_5 measures how close this estimator&#x27;s variance comes to this lower bound; estimator efficiency is defined as

:formula_20

or the minimum possible variance for an unbiased estimator divided by its actual variance.
The Cramér–Rao lower bound thus gives
:formula_21.

=== General scalar case ===
A more general form of the bound can be obtained by considering a biased estimator formula_22, whose expectation is not formula_1 but a function of this parameter, say, formula_24. Hence formula_25 is not generally equal to 0. In this case, the bound is given by
:formula_26
where formula_27 is the derivative of formula_24 (by formula_1), and formula_7 is the Fisher information defined above.

=== Bound on the variance of biased estimators ===
Apart from being a bound on estimators of functions of the parameter, this approach can be used to derive a bound on the variance of biased estimators with a given bias, as follows. Consider an estimator formula_5 with bias formula_32, and let formula_33. By the result above, any unbiased estimator whose expectation is formula_24 has variance greater than or equal to formula_35. Thus, any estimator formula_5 whose bias is given by a function formula_37 satisfies
:formula_38
The unbiased version of the bound is a special case of this result, with formula_39.

It&#x27;s trivial to have a small variance − an &quot;estimator&quot; that is constant has a variance of zero. But from the above equation, we find that the mean squared error of a biased estimator is bounded by

:formula_40

using the standard decomposition of the MSE. Note, however, that if formula_41 this bound might be less than the unbiased Cramér–Rao bound formula_42. For instance, in the example of estimating variance below, formula_43.

=== Multivariate case ===
Extending the Cramér–Rao bound to multiple parameters, define a parameter column vector
:formula_44
with probability density function formula_45 which satisfies the two regularity conditions below.

The Fisher information matrix is a formula_46 matrix with element formula_47 defined as
: formula_48

Let formula_49 be an estimator of any vector function of parameters, formula_50, and denote its expectation vector formula_51 by formula_52. The Cramér–Rao bound then states that the covariance matrix of formula_49 satisfies
:formula_54,
:formula_55
where
* The matrix inequality formula_56 is understood to mean that the matrix formula_57 is positive semidefinite, and
* formula_58 is the Jacobian matrix whose formula_59 element is given by formula_60.

If formula_49 is an unbiased estimator of formula_62 (i.e., formula_63), then the Cramér–Rao bound reduces to
: formula_64

If it is inconvenient to compute the inverse of the Fisher information matrix,
then one can simply take the reciprocal of the corresponding diagonal element
to find a (possibly loose) lower bound.

: formula_65

=== Regularity conditions ===
The bound relies on two weak regularity conditions on the probability density function, formula_66, and the estimator formula_22:
* The Fisher information is always defined; equivalently, for all formula_3 such that formula_69, formula_70 exists, and is finite.
* The operations of integration with respect to formula_3 and differentiation with respect to formula_1 can be interchanged in the expectation of formula_73; that is, formula_74 whenever the right-hand side is finite. This condition can often be confirmed by using the fact that integration and differentiation can be swapped when either of the following cases hold:
*# The function formula_4 has bounded support in formula_3, and the bounds do not depend on formula_1;
*# The function formula_4 has infinite support, is continuously differentiable, and the integral converges uniformly for all formula_1.

== Proof ==

=== Proof for the general case based on the Chapman–Robbins bound ===
Proof based on.

=== A standalone proof for the general scalar case ===
For the general scalar case:

Assume that formula_80 is an estimator with expectation formula_24 (based on the observations formula_15), i.e. that formula_83. The goal is to prove that, for all formula_1,
:formula_85

Let formula_15 be a random variable with probability density function formula_66.
Here formula_88 is a statistic, which is used as an estimator for formula_89. Define formula_90 as the score:

:formula_91

where the chain rule is used in the final equality above. Then the expectation of formula_90, written formula_93, is zero. This is because:

: formula_94

where the integral and partial derivative have been interchanged (justified by the second regularity condition).
If we consider the covariance formula_95 of formula_90 and formula_73, we have formula_98, because formula_99. Expanding this expression we have

:formula_100

again because the integration and differentiation operations commute (second condition).

The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality shows that

:formula_101

therefore

:formula_102
which proves the proposition.

== Examples ==

=== Multivariate normal distribution ===
For the case of a &quot;d&quot;-variate normal distribution
: formula_103
the Fisher information matrix has elements
:formula_104
where &quot;tr&quot; is the trace.

For example, let formula_105 be a sample of formula_2 independent observations with unknown mean formula_1 and known variance formula_108 .
:formula_109
Then the Fisher information is a scalar given by

:formula_110

and so the Cramér–Rao bound is

:formula_111

=== Normal variance with known mean ===
Suppose &quot;X&quot; is a normally distributed random variable with known mean formula_112 and unknown variance formula_108. Consider the following statistic:

:formula_114

Then &quot;T&quot; is unbiased for formula_108, as formula_116. What is the variance of &quot;T&quot;?

:formula_117

(the second equality follows directly from the definition of variance). The first term is the fourth moment about the mean and has value formula_118; the second is the square of the variance, or formula_119.
Thus

:formula_120

Now, what is the Fisher information in the sample? Recall that the score formula_90 is defined as

:formula_122

where formula_123 is the likelihood function. Thus in this case,

:formula_124

:formula_125

where the second equality is from elementary calculus. Thus, the information in a single observation is just minus the expectation of the derivative of formula_90, or

:formula_127

Thus the information in a sample of formula_2 independent observations is just formula_2 times this, or formula_130

The Cramér–Rao bound states that

:formula_131

In this case, the inequality is saturated (equality is achieved), showing that the estimator is efficient.

However, we can achieve a lower mean squared error using a biased estimator. The estimator

:formula_132

obviously has a smaller variance, which is in fact

:formula_133

Its bias is

:formula_134

so its mean squared error is

:formula_135

which is less than what unbiased estimators can achieve according to the Cramér–Rao bound.

When the mean is not known, the minimum mean squared error estimate of the variance of a sample from Gaussian distribution is achieved by dividing by formula_136, rather than formula_137 or formula_138.

<text>Catholic higher education includes universities, colleges, and other institutions of higher education privately run by the Catholic Church, typically by religious institutes. Those tied to the Holy See are specifically called pontifical universities.

By definition, Catholic canon law states that &quot;A Catholic school is understood to be one which is under control of the competent ecclesiastical authority or of a public ecclesiastical juridical person, or one which in a written document is acknowledged as Catholic by the ecclesiastical authority&quot; (Can. 803). Although some schools are deemed &quot;Catholic&quot; because of their identity and a great number of students enrolled are Catholics, it is also stipulated in canon law that &quot;no school, even if it is in fact Catholic, may bear the title &#x27;Catholic school&#x27; except by the consent of the competent ecclesiastical authority&quot; (Can. 803 §3).

The Dominican Order was &quot;the first order instituted by the Church with an academic mission&quot;, founding in every convent of the order, and &quot;studia generalia&quot; at the early European universities such as the University of Bologna and the University of Paris. In Europe, most universities with medieval history were founded as Catholic. Many of them were rescinded to government authorities in the Modern era. Some, however, remained Catholic, while new ones were established alongside the public ones. The Catholic Church is the largest non-governmental provider of higher education in the world. Many of them are internationally competitive. According to the census of the Vatican&#x27;s Congregation for Catholic Education, the total number of Catholic universities and higher education institutions around the world is 1,358. On the other hand, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) counts it at 1,861. The Catholic religious order with the highest number of universities around the world today is the Society of Jesus with 114.

Like other private schools, Catholic universities and colleges are generally nondenominational, in that they accept anyone regardless of religious affiliation, nationality, ethnicity, or civil status, provided the admission or enrollment requirements and legal documents are submitted, and rules and regulations are obeyed for a fruitful life on campus. However, non-Catholics, whether Christian or not, may or may not participate in otherwise required campus activities, particularly those of a religious nature.An example of Catholic college in India, SB College Changanasserry, built in 1922 with the help of Holy See of Catholic Church, has produced three Cardinals of Catholic Church which is the highest in any college in India.
==History==
The International Federation of Catholic Universities has its origins in collaboration in 1924 between the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan and the Catholic university of Nijmegen in the Netherlands. In 2023, it had 226 members universities in the world.

<text>Charles John Mahoney (June 20, 1940 – February 4, 2018) was an English-American actor. He played retired police officer Martin Crane on the NBC sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot; from 1993 to 2004, receiving nominations for two Golden Globe Awards and two Primetime Emmy Awards.

After moving from England to the United States, Mahoney began his career in Chicago as a member of the Steppenwolf Theatre Company. He earned the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play for his performance in the 1986 Broadway revival of John Guare&#x27;s &quot;The House of Blue Leaves&quot;, and went on to achieve wider recognition for his roles in the films &quot;Suspect&quot; and &quot;Moonstruck&quot; (both 1987). Other credits included &quot;Tin Men&quot; (1987), &quot;Frantic&quot;, &quot;Eight Men Out&quot; (both 1988), &quot;Say Anything...&quot; (1989), &quot;Barton Fink&quot; (1991), &quot;Striking Distance&quot;, &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot; (both 1993), &quot;Reality Bites&quot; (1994), &quot;The American President&quot; (1995), &quot;Primal Fear&quot; (1996), and &quot;The Broken Hearts Club&quot; (2000). He also voiced roles in animated films such as &quot;Antz&quot; (1998), &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; (1999), and &quot;&quot; (2001).

== Early life and education ==
Charles John Mahoney was born in Blackpool, England, on June 20, 1940, the seventh of eight children. His father, Reg, was a baker who played classical piano, and his mother, Margaret (née Watson), was a housewife who loved reading. His paternal grandfather was Irish. The family had been evacuated to Blackpool from their home city of Manchester when it was heavily bombed during World War II. Mahoney started school at St Joseph&#x27;s College. After the war, the family moved back to Manchester, where Mahoney grew up in the suburb of Withington and discovered acting at the Stretford Children&#x27;s Theatre. His parents&#x27; marriage was not happy. They would not speak to each other for long periods of time—and when they did, it often led to heated arguments. The family situation, combined with the war, fueled Mahoney&#x27;s interest in acting and he vowed to leave Manchester.

Mahoney moved to the United States aged 18 in 1959 when his older sister Vera (a war bride living in rural Illinois, where he had visited in 1951) agreed to sponsor him. He studied at Quincy University before joining the United States Army. After graduating from Quincy, he lived in Macomb, Illinois, and earned his master&#x27;s degree in English from Western Illinois University, where he went on to teach English in the late 1960s before settling in Forest Park, Illinois, and later in Oak Park, Illinois. He became a U.S. citizen in 1971 and served as an associate editor of the &quot;Quality Review Bulletin&quot; medical journal through much of the late 1970s.

Mahoney made a concerted effort to lose his English accent after joining the U.S. Army, not wanting to &quot;stand out&quot; in his new adopted country. He spoke with an American accent for the rest of his life.

==Career==
=== 1977–1992: Rise to prominence ===
Dissatisfied with his career, Mahoney took acting classes at St. Nicholas Theatre, which inspired him to resign from his day job and pursue acting full-time. After a stage production in Chicago in 1977, John Malkovich encouraged him to join the Steppenwolf Theatre. He did so and went on to win the Clarence Derwent Award as Most Promising Male Newcomer in 1986. Steppenwolf founder Gary Sinise said in an interview for &quot;Bomb Magazine&quot; that Lyle Kessler&#x27;s play &quot;Orphans&quot; in 1985 &quot;kicked John Mahoney, Kevin Anderson and Terry Kinney off into the movie business&quot; after their Steppenwolf performance of the play for which he won the Derwent Award and the Theatre World Award. Mahoney won Broadway&#x27;s Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play in 1986 for his performance in John Guare&#x27;s &quot;The House of Blue Leaves&quot;.

Mahoney&#x27;s first major film roles both came in 1987, in Barry Levinson&#x27;s &quot;Tin Men&quot; and in Peter Yates&#x27; &quot;Suspect&quot;, a courtroom drama/mystery starring Cher, Dennis Quaid, and Liam Neeson. In the next decade, he had prominent roles in many acclaimed films including the John Patrick Shanley romantic comedy film &quot;Moonstruck&quot; (1987) starring Nicolas Cage and Cher. In 1988, Mahoney portrayed Kid Gleason in the sports drama &quot;Eight Men Out&quot;, and the following year portrayed the protective father in the Cameron Crowe teen coming of age film &quot;Say Anything...&quot; (1989). He portrayed Secret Service Director Sam Campagna in the Wolfgang Petersen directed drama &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot; (1993), Grant Gubler in Ben Stiller&#x27;s romance film &quot;Reality Bites&quot; (1994), environmental lobbyist Leo Solomon in Rob Reiner&#x27;s political romance film &quot;The American President&quot; (1995) and John Shaughnessy in the legal mystery thriller &quot;Primal Fear&quot; (1996). He also is known for his collaboration with the Coen brothers in films such as the period black comedy&quot; Barton Fink&quot; and the screwball comedy &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot;. Mahoney also played a pivotal gay role in Greg Berlanti&#x27;s 2000 GLAAD Media Award-winning film &quot;The Broken Hearts Club: A Romantic Comedy&quot;.

===1993–2004: Breakthrough in &quot;Frasier&quot;===
Mahoney appeared in &quot;Frasier&quot; from its debut in 1993 until the final episode in 2004. He received two Emmy nominations and two Golden Globe nominations for the role of Martin Crane, the father of Frasier Crane and Niles Crane. NBC executives held Mahoney in such high esteem that Warren Littlefield declared he was pre-approved when the &quot;Frasier&quot; creative team suggested casting him as the father. Before appearing on the series, Mahoney had appeared in the episode &quot;Do Not Forsake Me, O&#x27; My Postman&quot; of &quot;Cheers&quot; – from which &quot;Frasier&quot; was a spinoff – as Sy Flembeck, an inept jingle writer who has a brief conversation with Frasier. Mahoney also appeared as a priest in &quot;Becker&quot;, which starred &quot;Cheers&quot; star Ted Danson.
Mahoney&#x27;s first voice job was in W. B. Yeats&#x27;s &quot;The Words upon the Window-Pane&quot; for the award-winning National Radio Theater of Chicago. He provided the voices for several characters in &quot;Antz&quot; (1998), Preston Whitmore in &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, General Rogard in &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; (1999), and Papi in &quot;Kronk&#x27;s New Groove&quot; (but was succeeded by Jeff Bennett in &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New School&quot; for an unknown reason). In 2007, Mahoney provided the voice of Dr. Robert Terwilliger, Sr. (Sideshow Bob&#x27;s father) in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Funeral for a Fiend&quot;. This reunited him with his &quot;Frasier&quot; co-stars Kelsey Grammer (Sideshow Bob) and David Hyde Pierce (Cecil, Sideshow Bob&#x27;s brother).

===2005–2018: Post-&quot;Frasier&quot; ===
Mahoney co-starred as the Old Man in the Broadway revival of &quot;Prelude to a Kiss&quot; at the American Airlines Theater in a limited-run engagement running from previews on February 17, 2007, through to April 29, 2007. He appeared as an elderly drag queen in the &quot;ER&quot; season 13 episode &quot;Somebody to Love,&quot; and co-starred with Steve Carell (himself a veteran of Chicago theater) as the father of Carell&#x27;s character in &quot;Dan in Real Life&quot;. In March 2008, he opened in the world premiere of &quot;Better Late&quot; at the Northlight Theatre. He was also the narrator for Midwest Airlines commercials. Mahoney also made two appearances on USA Network&#x27;s &quot;Burn Notice&quot; in the second (2009) and third (2010) season finales. His character, referred to only as &quot;Management,&quot; is a senior intelligence agency official who is the apparent main mover of the conspiracy which blacklisted Michael Westen.

Mahoney joined the cast of &quot;In Treatment&quot; for the series&#x27; second season (2009) as a frenetic CEO who is overwhelmed by his personal and professional responsibilities and experiences chronic physical anxiety attacks. In 2010, he made a guest appearance on &quot;$#*! My Dad Says&quot; as homophobic retired naval officer Lt. Commander Wally Durham.

Beginning in April 2011, Mahoney began rehearsing &quot;The Outgoing Tide&quot;, a new play by Bruce Graham at Northlight Theatre in Skokie, Illinois (suburban Chicago). The play also stars fellow &quot;Chicago&quot; actors Rondi Reed and Thom Cox. In 2011, he had two guest appearances on &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; as Roy, a waiter and a love interest for Betty White&#x27;s character Elka. This reunited him with his &quot;Frasier&quot; co-star Jane Leeves, as well as Wendie Malick whose character he eventually married in &quot;Frasier&quot; and his co-star in the movie &quot;The American President&quot;. Mahoney was a featured ensemble cast member in &quot;The Birthday Party&quot;, playing in Chicago&#x27;s Steppenwolf Theatre from January 24 to April 28, 2013. His last role was in the play &quot;The Rembrandt&quot;, which ran from September to November 2017.

Despite the numerous successes throughout his career, Mahoney maintained that his early work in the play &quot;Orphans&quot; has &quot;affected people more than any other play I&#x27;ve ever done. I still get mail from it, I still get people stopping me on the street, and it&#x27;s 20 years later.&quot;

==Personal life==
Mahoney lived in Oak Park, Illinois, and suffered from colon cancer in the mid-1980s. After being successfully treated for cancer again in 2014, he credited his love of acting and desire to continue it for giving him enough determination to survive both bouts, saying in October 2017: &quot;I refused to yield to it because I love what I&#x27;m doing so much.&quot;

Mahoney rarely spoke publicly about his private life, and he died without marrying or having any children. In 2002, he said, &quot;I was never very mature in my relationships with women. First sign of conflict, I was gone. Wouldn&#x27;t discuss it, because I was afraid it would lead to an argument.&quot; This stemmed from a fear of having an unhappy marriage like the one his parents had, though Mahoney did previously have &quot;several long-term relationships&quot;.

He was a Catholic who called Christianity &quot;probably the most important facet of my life&quot;: before each of his performances, he would pray &quot;Most glorious blessed spirit, I thank you for all the gifts and talents that you&#x27;ve given me. Please help me to use all these gifts and talents to their fullest. And please accept this performance as a prayer of praise and thanks to you&quot;. Mahoney would also say prayers upon waking up and before going to sleep daily, and would repeatedly pray &quot;Dear God, please help me to treat everybody – including myself – with love, respect, and dignity.&quot;

==Death==
Mahoney died in a Chicago hospice on February 4, 2018, due to complications from throat cancer, originally diagnosed in 2014. He was 77 years old. According to his friend Anna D. Shapiro, &quot;He was fragile and he was supposed to be having a routine procedure. But having just beat Stage 3 throat cancer, I think he was just too weak ... By the time he did &quot;The Rembrandt&quot; he was clean of cancer ... But other health issues came up and he was just too fragile.&quot;

<doc id="581135" wikidata="Q3137082" url="?curid=581135" title="History of Georgia (U.S. state)">
<text>The history of Georgia in the United States of America spans pre-Columbian time to the present-day U.S. state of Georgia. The area was inhabited by Native American tribes for thousands of years. A modest Spanish presence was established in the late 16th century, mostly centered on Catholic missions. The Spanish had largely withdrawn from the territory by the early 18th century, although they had settlements in nearby Florida. They had little influence historically in what would become Georgia. (Most Spanish place names in Georgia date from the 19th century, not from the age of colonization.)

Georgia was founded by James Oglethorpe in 1732. Oglethorpe envisioned the new colony as a refuge for the debtors who crowded London prisons; however, no such prisoners were among the initial settlers. Military concerns were a far more motivating force for the British government, which wanted Georgia (named for King George II) as a buffer zone to protect South Carolina and its other southern colonies against incursions from Florida by the Spanish, Britain’s greatest rival for North American territory. As a result, a series of fortifications was built along the coast, and on several occasions, most notably the Battle of Bloody Marsh on St. Simons Island, British troops that were commanded and financed by Oglethorpe kept the Spanish at bay.

European Americans began to settle in Georgia, although it was territory of both the Creek and the Cherokee nations. They pressured state and the federal government to remove the Indians. After Indian Removal in the 1830s, under President Jackson, the pace of settlement by European Americans increased rapidly. The new cotton gin, invented at the end of the 18th century, enabled the profitable processing of short-staple cotton, which could now be grown in the inland and upcountry regions. This change stimulated the cotton boom in Georgia and much of the Deep South, resulting in cotton being a main economic driver, cultivated on slave labor. Based on enslaved labor, planters cleared and developed large cotton plantations. Many became immensely wealthy, but most of the yeomen whites did not own slaves and worked family subsistence farms.

On January 19, 1861, Georgia seceded from the Union and on February 8, 1861, joined other Southern states, all slave societies, to form the Confederate States of America. Georgia contributed nearly one hundred twenty thousand soldiers to the Confederacy, with about five thousand Georgians (both black and white) joining the Union Army. The first major battle in the state was the Battle of Chickamauga, a Confederate victory, and the last major Confederate victory in the west. In 1864, Union General William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s armies invaded Georgia as part of the Atlanta Campaign. The burning of Atlanta (which was a commercially vital railroad hub but not yet the state capital) was followed by Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea, which laid waste to a wide swath of the state from Atlanta to Savannah in late 1864. These events became iconic in the state&#x27;s memory and dealt a devastating economic blow to the entire Confederacy.

After the war, Georgians endured a period of economic hardship. Reconstruction was a period of military occupation. With enfranchisement of freedmen, who allied with the Republican Party, a biracial legislature was elected. It established public education and welfare institutions for the first time in the state, and initiated economic programs. Reconstruction ended in 1875 after white Democrats regained political control of the state, through violence and intimidation at elections. They passed new laws and constitutional amendments that disenfranchised blacks and many poor whites near the turn of the century. In the Jim Crow era from the late 19th century to 1964, blacks were suppressed as second-class citizens, nearly excluded from politics. Thousands of blacks migrated North to escape these conditions and associated violence. The state was predominately rural, with an agricultural economy based on cotton into the 20th century. All residents of the state suffered in the Great Depression of the 1930s.

The many training bases and munitions plants established in World War II stimulated the economy, and provided some new opportunities for blacks. During the broad-based activism of the Civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s, Atlanta, Georgia was the base of African-American leader, minister Martin Luther King Jr. The state integrated public facilities. After 1950 the economy grew and became more diverse, with cotton receding in importance. Atlanta became a major regional city and transportation hub, expanding into neighboring communities through its fast-growing suburbs. Politically, Georgia was part of the Solid South until 1964, when it first voted for a Republican candidate for president. Democratic candidates continued to receive majority-white support in state and local elections until the 1990s, when the realignment of conservative whites shifted to the Republican Party. Atlanta was the host of the 1996 Summer Olympics, which marked the 100th anniversary of the modern Olympic Games. Georgia would grow rapidly both population wise and economically in the late 20th to early 21st century. In 2014, Georgia&#x27;s population topped 10 million people, and was the fourth fastest growing U.S. state from 2013 to 2014.

==Pre-colonial era==

Before European contact, Native American cultures are divided under archaeological criteria into four lengthy periods of culture: Paleo, Archaic, Woodland, and Mississippian. Their cultures were identified by characteristics of artefacts and other archaeological evidence, including earthwork mounds that survive to the present and are visible aboveground.

The human occupation of Georgia can be dated to at least 13,250 years ago. This was one of the most dramatic periods of climate change in recent earth history, toward the end of the Ice Age, in the Late Pleistocene epoch. Sea levels were more than lower than present levels. The Atlantic Ocean shoreline was 100 or more miles seaward of its current boundary. A 2003 research project undertaken by University of Georgia researchers Ervan G. Garrison, Sherri L. Littman, and Megan Mitchell, looked at and reported on fossils and artefacts associated with Gray&#x27;s Reef National Marine Sanctuary, which is located more than beyond today&#x27;s shoreline, and 60 to (18 to 21 m) below the Atlantic Ocean. As recently as 8,000 years ago, Gray&#x27;s Reef was dry ground, attached to the mainland. The researchers uncovered artefacts from a period of occupation by Clovis culture and Paleoindian hunters dating back more than 10,000 years. A 2005 study published by Texas A&amp;M University suggested that Burke County may also have been a major center of Clovis culture. It possesses a particularly high number of Clovis and Dalton points, likely due to the large areas of exposed chert for making stone tools. In general, most Paleoindian projectile points in the state were found in a large strip of land running from southwest to northeast, crossing both the Piedmont and the Atlantic Plain.

The South Appalachian Mississippian culture, the last of many mound building Native American cultures, lasted from 800 to 1500 AD. This culture developed urban societies distinguished by their construction of truncated earthworks pyramids, or platform mounds; as well as their hierarchical chiefdoms; intensive village-based maize horticulture, which enabled the development of more dense populations; and creation of ornate copper, shell and mica paraphernalia adorned with a series of motifs known as the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC). The largest sites surviving in present-day Georgia are Kolomoki in Early County, Etowah in Bartow County, Nacoochee Mound in White County, and Ocmulgee National Monument in Macon.

==European exploration==

At the time of European colonization of the Americas, the historic Iroquoian-speaking Cherokee and Muskogean-speaking Yamasee and Hitchiti peoples lived throughout Georgia.

The coastal regions were occupied by groups of small, Muskogean-speaking tribes with a loosely shared heritage, consisting mostly of the Guale-associated groups to the east and the Timucua group to the south. This group of 35 tribes had lands that extended into central Florida; they were bordered by the Hitchiti and their territory to the west.

The Muskogean peoples were related by language to the three large Muskogean nations that occupied territories between the Mississippi River and the Cherokee: the Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Coushatta. There were also a few other small Muskogean tribes along the Florida-Alabama Gulf Coast region. Archaeology shows that these historic peoples were in this region, at the very least, from the 12th century to colonial times. The name for Appalachia came from the Timucuan language, and a specific group from northern Florida called the Apalachee.

Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León may have sailed along the coast during his exploration of Florida. In 1526, Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón attempted to establish a colony on an island, possibly near St. Catherines Island. At San Miguel de Gualdape, the first Catholic Mass took place in the boundaries of what are today the United States.

From 1539 to 1542 Hernando de Soto, a Spanish &quot;conquistador&quot;, led the first European expedition deep into the territory of the modern-day southern United States, searching for gold and a passage to China. A vast undertaking, de Soto&#x27;s North American expedition ranged across parts of the modern states of Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. His expedition traversed much of the state of Georgia from south to north, and it recorded encountering many native groups along the way. These have largely been identified as part of the Mississippian culture and its chiefdoms.

An expedition of French Protestants founded the colonial settlement of Charlesfort in 1562 on Parris Island off the coast of South Carolina. Jean Ribault and his party of French Huguenots settled an area in the Port Royal Sound area of present-day South Carolina. Within a year the colony failed. Most of the colonists followed René Goulaine de Laudonnière south and founded a new outpost called Fort Caroline in present-day Florida.

Over the next few decades, a number of Spanish explorers from Florida visited the inland region of present-day Georgia. The Mississippian culture way of life, described by de Soto in 1540, had completely disappeared by the mid-1600s. The people may have suffered from new infectious diseases carried by the Europeans. Remaining peoples are believed to have coalesced as the documented historic tribes.

English fur traders from the Province of Carolina first encountered the Creek people in 1690. The English established a fort at Ocmulgee. There they traded iron tools, guns, cloth, and rum for deerskins and Indian slaves, captured by warring tribes in regular raids.

==British colony==

The conflict between Spain and England over control of Georgia began in earnest in about 1670, when the English colony of South Carolina was founded just north of the missionary provinces of Guale and Mocama, part of Spanish Florida. Guale and Mocama, today part of Georgia, lay between Carolina&#x27;s capital, Charles Town, and Spanish Florida&#x27;s capital, &quot;San Agustín&quot;. They were subjected to repeated military invasions by English and Spanish colonists.

The English destroyed the Spanish mission system in Georgia by 1704. The coast of future Georgia was occupied by British-allied Yamasee American Indians until they were decimated in the Yamasee War of 1715–1717, by South Carolina colonists and Indian allies. The surviving Yamasee fled to Spanish Florida, leaving the coast of Georgia depopulated. This enabled formation of a new British colony. A few defeated Yamasee remained and later became known as the Yamacraw.

English settlement began in the early 1730s after James Oglethorpe, a Member of Parliament, proposed that the area be colonized with the &quot;worthy poor&quot; of England, to provide an alternative to the overcrowded debtors&#x27; prisons of the period. Oglethorpe and other English philanthropists secured a royal charter as the Trustees of the colony of Georgia on June 9, 1732. The misconception of Georgia&#x27;s having been founded as a debtor or penal colony persists because numerous English convicts were later sentenced to transportation to Georgia as punishment, with the idea that they would provide labor. With the motto, &quot;Not for ourselves, but for others,&quot; the Trustees selected colonists for Georgia.

Oglethorpe and the Trustees formulated a contract, multi-tiered plan for the settlement of Georgia (see the Oglethorpe Plan). The plan framed a system of &quot;agrarian equality&quot; designed to support and perpetuate an economy based on family farming and to prevent the social disintegration they associated with unregulated urbanization. Land ownership was limited to , a grant that included a town lot, a garden plot near town, and a farm. Self-supporting colonists were able to obtain larger grants, but such grants were structured in increments tied to &quot;headrights&quot;, that is, the number of indentured servants for whom the grantee paid transportation to the colony. Survivors who completed their term of indenture (to pay for the transportation and associated costs), would be granted a parcel of land of their own. No person was permitted to acquire additional land through purchase or inheritance.

On February 12, 1733, the first settlers arrived in the ship &quot;Anne&quot;, at what was to become the city of Savannah. From 1735 to 1743, Georgia garrisoned Fort Okfuskee at the Creek town of Okfuskee to compete with French trade with the Creeks at Fort Toulouse. In 1742, the colony was invaded by Spanish forces during the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear. Oglethorpe mobilized local forces and defeated the Spanish at the Battle of Bloody Marsh. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which ended the war, confirmed the English position in Georgia.

From 1735 to 1750, the trustees of Georgia, unique among Britain&#x27;s American colonies, prohibited African slavery as a matter of public policy. However, as the growing wealth of the slave-based plantation economy in neighboring South Carolina demonstrated, slaves were more profitable than other forms of labor available to colonists. In addition, improving economic conditions in Europe meant that fewer whites were willing to immigrate as indentured servants. In addition, many of the whites suffered high mortality rates from the climate, tropical diseases and other hardships of the Lowcountry.

In 1749, the state overturned its ban on slavery. From 1750 to 1775, planters so rapidly imported slaves that the enslaved population grew from less than 500 to approximately 18,000 — a majority of people in the colony. Until 1766, the free colonists imported slaves from other British colonies; thereafter planters imported slaves chiefly from the rice-growing regions of present-day Sierra Leone, the Gambia and Angola. Some historians have suggested that the Lowcountry&#x27;s elaborate earthwork system for rice and indigo cultivation originated in the sophisticated knowledge and material techniques of the newly-imported African slaves. Others argue that rice cultivation had become a settled system before any persons enslaved in risicultural regions arrived at the colony. Later planters developed the infrastructure to grow sugar cane as a cash crop as well.

A scarcity of horses proved to be a constant problem as the colonists tried to develop production of the industry of range cattle. Planters were occasionally able to arrange roundups of wild horses, believed to have escaped from Indian traders or from Spanish Florida.
In 1752, Georgia became a royal colony. Planters from South Carolina, wealthier than the original settlers of Georgia, migrated south and soon dominated the colony. They replicated the customs and institutions of the South Carolina Lowcountry. Planters had higher rates of absenteeism from their large plantations in the Lowcountry and the Sea Islands than did those in the Upper South. They often took their families to the hills during the summer, the &quot;sick season&quot;, when the Lowcountry had high rates of disease carried by mosquitoes, such as malaria and yellow fever. The decade after the end of Trustee rule was a decade of significant growth. Georgia began to grow after the treaty of 1748 ended fear of further attacks from Spain.

By the 1750s, British settlers lived as far south as Cumberland Island. This violated the boundaries set by their own government and Spain, which claimed the territory. British settlers living south of the Altamaha River frequently engaged in trade with Spanish Florida, which was also illegal according to both governments. Such a ban was essentially unenforceable.

Because of the development of large plantations and commodity crops that required numerous slaves for cultivation and processing, the society of the Georgia coast was more like that of such British colonies as Barbados and Jamaica, than of Virginia. The large plantations were worked by numerous African-born slaves. Many of these Africans, although of different languages and tribes, came from closely related geographic areas of West Africa. The slaves of the &#x27;Rice Coast&#x27; of South Carolina and Georgia developed the unique Gullah or Geechee culture (the latter term was more common in Georgia), in which important parts of West African linguistic, religious and cultural heritage were preserved and creolized. This multi-ethnic culture developed throughout the Lowcountry and Sea Islands, where enslaved African Americans later worked at cotton plantations. African-American influences, which also absorbed elements of Native American and European-American culture, was strong on the cuisine and music that became integral parts of southern culture.

Georgia was largely untouched by war during much of Britain&#x27;s involvement in the Seven Years&#x27; War. In North America, hostilities took place along a front in the North, along the border with New France and their allied Native American tribes. Americans later called it the French and Indian War. In 1762 Georgia feared a potential Spanish invasion from Florida, although this did not occur by the time peace was signed at the 1763 Treaty of Paris. During this period the Anglo-Cherokee War began.

Governor James Wright wrote in 1766, thirty-two years after its founding, that Georgia had

No manufactures of the least consequence: a trifling quantity of coarse homespun cloth, wool [sic] and cotton mixed; among the poorer sort of people, for their own use, a few cotton and yarn stockings; shoes for our Negroes; and some occasional blacksmith&#x27;s work. But all our supplies of silk, linens, wool, shoes, stockings, nails, locks, hinges, and tools of every sort ... are all imported from and through Great Britain.

==Capitals of Georgia==
Georgia has had five different capitals in its history. The first was Savannah, the seat of government during British colonial rule, followed by Augusta, Louisville, Milledgeville, and Atlanta, the capital city from 1868 to the present day. The state legislature has gathered for official meetings in other places, most often in Macon and especially during the American Civil War.

==American revolution==
Royal governor James Wright was popular, but all of the 13 colonies developed the same strong position defending the traditional rights of Englishmen which they feared London was violating. Georgia and the others moved rapidly toward republicanism which rejected monarchy, aristocracy and corruption, and demanded government based on the will of the people. In particular, they demanded &quot;No taxation without representation&quot; and rejected the Stamp Act in 1765 and all subsequent royal taxes. More fearsome was the British punishment of Boston after the Boston Tea Party. Georgians knew their remote coastal location made them vulnerable.

In August 1774 at a general meeting in Savannah, the people proclaimed, &quot;Protection and allegiance are reciprocal, and under the British Constitution correlative terms; ... the Constitution admits of no taxation without representation.&quot; Georgia had few grievances of its own but ideologically supported the patriot cause and expelled the British.

Angered by the news of the battle of Concord, on the eleventh of May 1775, the patriots stormed the royal magazine at Savannah and carried off its ammunition. The customary celebration of the King&#x27;s birthday on June 4 was turned into a wild demonstration against the King; a liberty pole was erected. Within a month the patriots completely defied royal authority and set up their own government. In June and July, assemblies at Savannah chose a Council of Safety and a Provincial Congress to take control of the government and cooperate with the other colonies. They started raising troops and prepared for war. &quot;In short my lord,&quot; wrote Wright to Lord Dartmouth on September 16, 1775, &quot;the whole Executive Power is Assumed by them, and the King&#x27;s Governor remains little Else than Nominally so.&quot;

In February 1776, Wright fled to a British warship and the patriots controlled all of Georgia. The new Congress adopted &quot;Rules and Regulations&quot; on April 15, 1776, which can be considered the Constitution of 1776. (Along with the other American colonies, Georgia declared independence in 1776 when its delegates approved and signed the joint Declaration of Independence.) With that declaration, Georgia ceased to be a colony. It was a state with a weak chief executive, the &quot;President and Commander-in-Chief,&quot; who was elected by the state Congress for a term of only six months. Archibald Bulloch, President of the two previous Congresses, was elected first President. He bent his efforts to mobilizing and training the militia. The Constitution of 1777 put power in the hands of the elected House of Assembly, which chose the governor; there was no senate and the franchise was open to nearly all white men.

The new state&#x27;s exposed seaboard position made it a tempting target for the British Navy. Savannah was captured by British and Loyalist forces in 1778, along with some of its hinterland. Enslaved Africans and African Americans chose their independence by escaping to British lines, where they were promised freedom. About one-third of Georgia&#x27;s 15,000 slaves escaped during the Revolution.

The patriots moved to Augusta. At the Siege of Savannah in 1779, American and French troops (the latter including a company of free men of color from Saint-Domingue, who were mixed race) fought unsuccessfully to retake the city. During the final years of the American Revolution, Georgia had a functioning Loyalist colonial government along the coast. Together with New York City, it was the last Loyalist bastion.

An early historian reported:

For forty-two long months had she been a prey to rapine, oppression, fratricidal strife, and poverty. Fear, unrest, the brand, the sword, the tomahawk, had been her portion. In the abstraction [removal] of negro slaves, by the burning of dwellings, in the obliteration of plantations, by the destruction of agricultural implements, and by theft of domestic animals and personal effects, it is estimated that at least one half of the available property of the inhabitants had, during this period, been completely swept away. Real estate had depreciated in value. Agriculture was at a stand-still, and there was no money with which to repair these losses and inaugurate a new era of prosperity. The lamentation of widows and orphans, too, were heard in the land. These not only bemoaned their dead, but cried aloud for food. Amid the general depression there was, nevertheless, a deal of gladness in the hearts of the people, a radiant joy, an inspiring hope. Independence had been won.

The end of the war saw a new wave of migration to the state, particularly from the frontiers of Virginia and the Carolinas. George Mathews, soon to be governor of Georgia, was instrumental in this migration.

Georgia ratified the U.S. Constitution on January 2, 1788.

The original eight counties of Georgia were Burke, Camden, Chatham, Effingham, Glynn, Liberty, Richmond and Wilkes. Before these counties were created in 1777, Georgia had been divided into local government units called parishes. Each of these original eight counties is named after members of the British government who had supported the American cause during the revolution. As with South Carolina, most of the Loyalists in Georgia (Georgians who had fought for the British cause during the revolution) stayed in Georgia after the war ended. Leading Georgia patriots such as Archibald Bulloch, Stephen Heard, Lyman Hall, John Houstoun, Samuel Elbert, Edward Telfair and George Mathews were all instrumental in both encouraging the Loyalists to stay and in making sure that they were not mistreated during the peace that followed the war. Screven County had hundreds of first generation Scottish immigrants who had all stayed loyal to the crown during the war, Telfair and Mathews personally asked them to stay. In the city of Savannah, Archibald Bulloch, Stephen Heard, Lyman Hall and John Houstoun all made personal appeals to the loyalists to &quot;stay on&quot; after the war ended and make the best of their lives under the new republican form of government.

==Antebellum period==
During the 77 years of the Antebellum period, the area of Georgia was soon reduced by half from the Mississippi River back to the current state line by 1802. The ceded land was added into the Mississippi Territory by 1804, following the Louisiana Purchase, with the state of Alabama later created in 1819 to become the west Georgia state line. Also during this period, large cotton plantations dominated the inland areas, while rice farming was popular near the coast. The slave population increased to work the plantations, but the native Cherokee tribe was removed and resettled west in Oklahoma, in the final two decades before the Civil War, as explained further in the paragraphs below.

===Reduced state lines===

In 1787, the Treaty of Beaufort had established the eastern boundary of Georgia, from the Atlantic seashore up the Savannah River, at South Carolina, to modern day Tugalo Lake (construction to the Tugalo dam was started in 1917 and completed in 1923). Twelve to fourteen miles () of land (inhabited at the time by the Cherokee Nation) separate the lake from the southern boundary of North Carolina. South Carolina ceded its claim to this land (extending all the way to the Pacific Ocean) to the federal government.

Georgia maintained a claim on western land from 31° N to 35° N, the southern part of which overlapped with the Mississippi Territory created from part of Spanish Florida in 1798. Following a series of land scandals, Georgia ceded its claims in 1802, fixing its present western boundary. In 1804, the federal government added the cession to the Mississippi Territory.

The Treaty of 1816 fixed the present-day northern boundary between Georgia and South Carolina at the Chattooga River, proceeding northwest from the lake. The Mississippi Territory was split on December 10, 1817, to form the U.S. state of Mississippi and the Alabama Territory for 2 years; then in December 1819, the new state of Alabama became the western boundary of Georgia.

===Indian relocation===

After the Creek War (corresponding with the War of 1812), some Muscogee leaders signed treaties that ceded land to Georgia, including the 1814 signing of the Treaty of Fort Jackson. Under this treaty, General Andrew Jackson forced the Creek confederacy to surrender more than 21 million acres in what is now southern Georgia and central Alabama. On February 12, 1825, William McIntosh and other chiefs signed the Treaty of Indian Springs, which gave up most of the remaining Creek lands in Georgia. After the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty, McIntosh was assassinated on April 30, 1825, by Creeks led by Menawa.

In 1829, gold was discovered in the north Georgia mountains, resulting in the Georgia Gold Rush, the second gold rush in U.S. history. A federal mint was established in Dahlonega, Georgia, and continued to operate until 1861. During the early 1800s, Cherokee Indians owned their ancestral land, operated their own government with a written constitution, and did not recognize the authority of the state of Georgia. An influx of white settlers pressured the U.S. government to expel them. The dispute culminated in the Indian Removal Act of 1830, under which all eastern tribes were sent west to Indian reservations in present-day Oklahoma. In Worcester v. Georgia, the Supreme Court in 1832 ruled that states were not permitted to redraw the boundaries of Indian lands, but President Andrew Jackson and the state of Georgia ignored the ruling.

Escalating tensions with Creek tribes erupted into open war with the United States following the destruction of the village of Roanoke, Georgia, located along the Chattahoochee River on the boundary between Creek and American territory, in May 1836. During the so-called &quot;Creek War of 1836&quot; Secretary of War Lewis Cass dispatched General Winfield Scott to end the violence by forcibly removing the Creeks to the Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River.

In 1838, Andrew Jackson&#x27;s successor, President Martin van Buren dispatched federal troops to round up the Cherokee and deport them west of the Mississippi. This forced relocation, beginning in White County, became known as the Trail of Tears and led to the death of over 4,000 Cherokees.

=== Land allocations ===
In 1794, Eli Whitney, a Massachusetts-born artisan residing in Savannah, Georgia, had patented a cotton gin, mechanizing the separation of cotton fibres from their seeds. The Industrial Revolution had resulted in the mechanized spinning and weaving of cloth in the world&#x27;s first factories in the north of England. Fueled by the soaring demands of British textile manufacturers, King Cotton quickly came to dominate Georgia and the other southern states. Although Congress had banned the slave trade in 1808, Georgia&#x27;s slave population continued to grow with the importation of slaves from the plantations of the South Carolina Lowcountry and Chesapeake Tidewater, increasing from 149,656 in 1820 to 280,944 in 1840. A small population of free blacks developed, mostly working as artisans. The Georgia legislature unanimously passed a resolution in 1842 declaring that free blacks were not U.S. citizens. However, national citizenship is defined by federal statute. While an indication of sentiment, this state resolution did not have the power of law.

Slaves worked the fields in large cotton plantations, and the economy of the state became dependent on the institution of slavery. Requiring little cultivation, most efficiently grown on large plantations by large (slave) workforces, and easy to transport, cotton proved ideally suited to the inland frontier. The lower Piedmont or &#x27;Black Belt&#x27; counties – comprising the middle third of the state and initially named for the region&#x27;s distinctively dark and fertile soil – became the site of the largest and most productive cotton plantations. By 1860, the slave population in the Black Belt was three times greater than that of the coastal counties, where rice remained the principal crop. The upper Piedmont was settled mainly by white yeoman farmers of English descent. While there were also many smaller cotton plantations, the proportion of slaves was lower in north Georgia than in the coastal and Black Belt counties, but it still ranged up to 25% of the population. In the state as a whole, enslaved African Americans comprised 44% of the population of slightly more than one million.

===Education===
Until the 20th century, there were no public secondary schools, although there were several private and religious schools.

Post-secondary education was formalized in 1785, with the establishment of the University of Georgia, the first university in the U.S. to gain a state charter. Rural families often pooled their resources to hire itinerant teachers for a month or two at a time. Ten grammar schools were in operation by 1770, many taught by ministers. Most had some government funding, and many were free to both male and female white students. A study of women&#x27;s signatures indicates a high degree of literacy in areas with schools.

Georgia&#x27;s early promise in education faded after 1800. Public education was established by the Reconstruction era legislatures in the South, but after Democrats regained power, they hardly funded them. The entire rural South had limited public schooling until after 1900, and black schools were underfunded in the segregated society.

Wealthy Georgians took care of their own, sending their children to private academies. The Presbyterians were especially active in creating academies, including numerous schools for women. They included Georgia Female College, Rome Female College, Greensboro Female College, Griffin Synodical Female College, Thomasville/Young&#x27;s Female College, and the most enduring of all, Decatur Female Seminary, now Agnes Scott College.

==Civil War==
On January 19, 1861, Georgia seceded from the Union, keeping the name &quot;State of Georgia&quot; and joining the newly formed Confederacy in February. White solidarity was strong in 1861–63, as the planters in the Black Belt formed a common cause with upcountry yeomen farmers in defense of the Confederacy against the Union. Around 120,000 Georgians served in the Confederate Army. However disillusionment set in by 1863, with class tensions becoming more serious, including food riots, desertions, and growing Unionist activity in the northern mountain region. Approximately 5,000 Georgians (both black and white troops) served in the Union Army in units including the 1st Georgia Infantry Battalion, the 1st Alabama Cavalry Regiment, and a number of East Tennessean regiments. Governor Joseph E. Brown tried to divert attention by blaming the Confederate officials in Richmond, especially President Jefferson Davis, and insisting that many Georgia troops be kept at home. Brown was by the Augusta &quot;Chronicle and Sentinel,&quot; an influential weekly newspaper that repeatedly attacked the Davis administration, especially after the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus on February 15, 1864.

===Military history===

Georgia sent around one hundred twenty thousand soldiers to the Confederacy, mostly to the armies in Virginia. More than five thousand Georgians (both black and white) joined the Union Army, mostly in units raised in East Tennessee and Northern Alabama.

The first major battle in Georgia was a Confederate victory at the Battle of Chickamauga in 1863. It was the last major Confederate victory in the west. Following President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Emancipation Proclamation of January 1863, slaves began to leave plantations to join Union lines and gain freedom. In 1864, William T. Sherman&#x27;s armies invaded Georgia as part of the Atlanta Campaign. Confederate general Joseph E. Johnston fought a series of delaying battles, the largest being the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, as he tried to delay as long as possible retreating toward Atlanta. Johnston&#x27;s replacement, Gen. John Bell Hood attempted several unsuccessful counterattacks at the Battle of Peachtree Creek and the Battle of Atlanta, but Sherman captured the city on September 2, 1864.

In November Sherman stripped his army of non-essentials and began his famous Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea, living off the land and burning plantations, wrecking railroads, and killing the livestock. Thousands of escaped slaves followed his troops across the region as he entered Savannah on December 22. After the loss of Atlanta, the governor withdrew the state&#x27;s militia from the Confederate forces to harvest crops for the state and the army. They did not try to stop Sherman.

Sherman&#x27;s March was devastating to Georgia and the Confederacy in terms of economics and psychology. Sherman estimated that the campaign had inflicted $100 million (about $1.4 billion in 2010 dollars) in destruction, about one fifth of which &quot;inured to our advantage&quot; while the &quot;remainder is simple waste and destruction.&quot; His army wrecked of railroad and numerous bridges and miles of telegraph lines. It seized 5,000 horses, 4,000 mules, and 13,000 head of cattle. It confiscated 9.5 million pounds of corn and 10.5 million pounds of fodder, and destroyed uncounted cotton gins and mills.

Sherman&#x27;s campaign of total war extended to Georgia civilians. In July 1864, during the Atlanta campaign, General Sherman ordered approximately 400 Roswell mill workers, mostly women, arrested as traitors and shipped as prisoners to the North with their children. This was a common tactic of Sherman to economically disrupt the South. There is little evidence that more than a few of the women ever returned home.

The memory of Sherman&#x27;s March became iconic and central to the &quot;Myth of the Lost Cause.&quot; The crisis was the setting for Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s 1936 novel &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; and the subsequent 1939 film. Most important were many &quot;salvation stories&quot; that tell not what Union soldiers destroyed, but what was saved by the quick thinking and crafty women on the home front, loyal slaves, or was preserved due to appreciation of the beauty of homes and the charm of Southern women.

===Food shortages===
By summer 1861, the Union naval blockade virtually shut down the export of cotton and the import of manufactured goods. Food that formerly came overland was cut off. In response, the governor and legislature pleaded with planters to grow less cotton and more food. Most refused, some believing that the Yankees would not or could not fight. When cotton prices soared in Europe, expectations were that Europe would soon intervene to break the blockade. Neither proved true and the myth of omnipotent &quot;King Cotton&quot; died hard. The legislature imposed cotton quotas, making it a crime to grow an excess. But food shortages only worsened, especially in the towns. Poor white women raised more than two dozen riots when they raided stores and captured supply wagons to get such necessities as bacon, corn, flour, and cotton yarn. As the South lost control of more and more of its major ocean and river ports, it had to rely on a rickety railroad system and unimproved roads to move soldiers and supplies. Atlanta became the Confederacy&#x27;s chief rail center, thus making it a prime target for Sherman. Thinking the state was safe from invasion, the Confederates built small munitions factories throughout the state as well as soldier hospitals and prison camps.

===Andersonville prison===
In 1864, the government relocated Union prisoners of war from Richmond, Virginia, to the town of Andersonville, in remote southwest Georgia. It proved a death camp because of overcrowding and a severe lack of supplies, food, water, and medicine. During its 15 months of operation, the Andersonville prison camp held 45,000 Union soldiers; at least 13,000 died from disease, malnutrition, starvation, or exposure. At its peak, the death rate was more than 100 persons per day. After the war, the camp&#x27;s commanding officer, Captain Henry Wirz, was the only Confederate to be tried and executed as a war criminal.

==Reconstruction==

At war&#x27;s end the devastation and disruption in every part of the state was dramatic. Wartime damage, disruption to plantations, and miserable weather had a disastrous effect on agricultural production before the end of the war. Production of the state&#x27;s chief money crop, cotton, fell from a high of more than 700,000 bales in 1860 to less than 50,000 in 1865, while harvests of corn and wheat were also meager. After the war, the state subsidized construction of numerous new railroad lines to improve infrastructure and connections to markets. Use of commercial fertilizers increased cotton production in Georgia&#x27;s upcountry, but the coastal rice plantations never recovered from the war.

In January 1865, William T. Sherman issued Special Field Orders, No. 15 authorizing federal authorities to confiscate abandoned plantations in the Sea Islands and redistribute land in smaller plots to former slaves. Later that year, after succeeding Lincoln in the presidency after he was assassinated, Andrew Johnson revoked the order and returned the plantations to their former owners.

At the beginning of the period of Reconstruction, Georgia had more than 460,000 freedmen. Slaves made up 44% of the state&#x27;s population in 1860. After the Civil War, many former slaves moved from rural areas to Atlanta, where economic opportunities were better. Free from white supervision, they established their own communities. Other migrations involved blacks moving from plantations to adjacent small towns and communities. A new federal agency the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau helped blacks negotiate labor contracts, and set up schools and churches. The region&#x27;s planters struggled with the transition to paid labor and tried to control the movement of blacks through Black Codes.

Andrew Johnson&#x27;s decision to restore the former Confederate states to the Union, without requirements for political change, was criticized by Radical Republicans in Congress. In March 1867, Congress passed the First Reconstruction Act to place the South under military occupation and rule. Along with Alabama and Florida, Georgia was included in the Third Military District, under the command of General John Pope. Military rule lasted less than a year. It supervised the first elections in which black men could vote. The electoral roll in 1867 included 102,000 eligible white men, and 99,000 eligible black men. Radical Republicans in Congress required ex-Confederates to take an ironclad oath of loyalty or be prevented from holding office. The legislature was controlled by a biracial coalition of newly enfranchised freedmen, Northerners (carpetbaggers), and white Southerners (disparagingly called scalawags). The latter were mostly former Whigs who had opposed secession.

The voters elected delegates to write a new constitution in 1868; 20% of the delegates were black. In July 1868, the newly elected General Assembly ratified the Fourteenth Amendment; a Republican governor, Rufus Bullock, was inaugurated, and Georgia was readmitted to the Union. The state&#x27;s Democrats, including former Confederate leaders Robert Toombs and Howell Cobb, convened in Atlanta to denounce Reconstruction. Theirs was described as the largest mass rally held in Georgia. In September, white Republicans joined with the Democrats in expelling all thirty-two black legislators from the General Assembly. Refusing to give up social domination, some ex-Confederates organized insurgent paramilitary groups, especially chapters of the newly formed Ku Klux Klan. Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau agents reported 336 cases of murder or assault with intent to kill perpetrated against freedmen across the state from January 1 through November 15, 1868.

In 1868, under Reconstruction, Georgia became the first state in the South to implement the convict lease system. It generated revenue for the state by leasing out the prison population, many of whom were black, to work for private businesses and citizens. Prisoners did not receive income for their labor. In this manner, railroad companies, mines, turpentine distilleries and other manufacturers supplemented their workforce with unpaid convict labor. This helped to hasten Georgia&#x27;s transition to industrialization. Under the convict release system, employers were legally obliged to provide humane treatment to the laborers. But the system was easily abused and akin to slavery. One prominent beneficiary of this system was the Republican jurist and politician Joseph E. Brown, whose railroads, coal mines and iron works supplemented their workforce with convict labor.

The activity of political groups opposed to Reconstruction prompted Republicans and others to call for the return of Georgia to military rule. Georgia was one of only two ex-Confederate states to vote against Ulysses S. Grant in the presidential election of 1868. In March 1869, the state legislature defeated ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment.

That same month, the U.S. Congress, citing election fraud, barred Georgia&#x27;s representatives from taking their seats. This culminated in military rule being re-imposed in December 1869. In January 1870, Gen. Alfred H. Terry, the final commanding general of the Third District, purged the General Assembly of ex-Confederates. He replaced them with Republican runners-up and reinstated expelled black legislators. This militarily imposed General Assembly had a large Republican majority.

In February 1870, the newly constituted legislature ratified the Fifteenth Amendment and chose new Senators to send to Washington. On July 15, Georgia became the last former Confederate state readmitted into the Union. After military rule ended, Democrats won commanding majorities in both houses of the General Assembly, aided by election violence and fraud. Some Reconstruction-era black legislators held on to their seats through the legislature&#x27;s passage of laws disfranchising blacks, starting with a poll tax in 1877; the last black legislator served until 1907. In 1908 provisions of a new constitution completed black disfranchisement. Under threat of impeachment, Republican governor Rufus Bullock fled the state.

==Postbellum economic growth==

Under the Reconstruction government, the state capital was moved from Milledgeville to the inland rail terminus of Atlanta. Construction began on a new capitol building, which was completed by 1889. With the city a center of trade and government, the population of Atlanta increased rapidly.

Post-Reconstruction Georgia was dominated by the Bourbon Triumvirate of Joseph E. Brown, Major General John B. Gordon and Gen. Alfred H. Colquitt. Between 1872 and 1890, either Brown or Gordon held one of Georgia&#x27;s Senate seats, Colquitt held the other, and, in the major part of that period, either Colquitt or Gordon occupied the Governor&#x27;s office. Democrats effectively monopolized state politics. Colquitt represented the old planter class; Brown, head of Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad and one of the states first millionaires, represented the New South businessmen. Gordon was neither a planter nor a successful businessman, but the former Confederate General proved a most skilled politician.

Gordon was thought by some to be the titular leader of the 1st Ku Klux Klan in Georgia. He was the first former Confederate to serve in the U.S. Senate. He helped negotiate the Compromise of 1877 that ended Reconstruction and led to the end of federal enforcement of laws protecting blacks. A native of northwest Georgia, his popularity impeded the growth of the &#x27;mountain Republicanism,&#x27; which was prevalent elsewhere in Appalachian areas where slavery had been minor and resentment against the planter class widespread.

During the Gilded Age, Georgia slowly recovered from the devastation of the Civil War. One of the most enduring products came about in reaction to the age&#x27;s excesses. In 1885, when Atlanta and Fulton County enacted prohibition legislation against alcohol, a local pharmacist, John Pemberton invented a new soda drink. Two years later, after he sold the drink to Asa Candler who promoted it, Coca-Cola became the state&#x27;s most famous product.

Henry W. Grady, editor of the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot;, emerged as the leading spokesman of the &#x27;New South&#x27;. He promoted sectional reconciliation and the region&#x27;s place in a rapidly industrializing nation. The International Cotton Exposition of 1881 and the Cotton States and International Exposition of 1895 were staged to promote Georgia and the South as textile centers. They attracted mills from New England to build a new economic base in the post-war South by diversifying the region&#x27;s agrarian economies. Attracted by low labor costs and the proximity to raw materials, new textile businesses transformed Columbus and Atlanta, as well as Graniteville, on the Georgia-South Carolina border, into textile manufacturing centers.

Due to Georgia&#x27;s relatively untapped virgin forests, particularly in the thinly populated pine savanna of the Atlantic Coastal Plain, logging became a major industry. It supported other new industries, most notably paper mills and turpentine distilling, which, by 1900, made Georgia the leading producer of naval stores. Also important were coal, granite and kaolin mining, the latter used in the manufacture of paper, bricks and ceramic piping.

In the volatile 1880s and 1890s, political violence suppressed black voting as white Democrats imposed laws for Jim Crow and white supremacy. Whites increased their lynchings of blacks, reaching its height in 1899, when 27 Georgians were killed by lynch mobs. From 1890 to 1900, Georgia averaged more than one mob killing per month. More than 95% of the victims of the 450 lynchings documented between 1882 and 1930 were black.

This period also corresponded to Georgia&#x27;s disfranchisement of blacks and many poor whites through changes to its constitution and addition of such requirements as poll taxes (1877), literacy and comprehension tests, and residency requirements. In 1900 blacks comprised 46.7% of the population, but hardly any could register and vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;pop/perc&quot;&gt;Historical Census Browser, 1900 Federal Census, University of Virginia , accessed March 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The state instituted a white primary in 1908; as it was a one-party state by that time, this further excluded the chance of black political participation. This situation prevailed into the mid-20th century.

The Cotton States and International Exposition was the venue for Booker T. Washington&#x27;s speech promoting what became known as the Atlanta Compromise. He urged blacks to focus their efforts, not on demands for social equality, but to improve their own conditions by becoming proficient in skills for available jobs in agriculture, mechanics, and domestic service. He proposed building a broad base within existing conditions in the South. He urged whites to take responsibility to improve social and economic relations between the races.

Black leaders such as W. E. B. Du Bois, who supported classical academic standards for education, disagreed with Washington and said he was acquiescing to oppression. Born in Massachusetts, Du Bois had earned his doctorate in Germany and was one of the most highly educated black men in America; in 1897 he joined the faculty of Atlanta University and taught there for several years.

==Agrarian unrest and disfranchisement==
While Grady and other proponents of the New South insisted on Georgia&#x27;s urban future, the state&#x27;s economy remained overwhelmingly dependent on cotton. Much of the industrialization that did occur was as a subsidiary of cotton agriculture; many of the state&#x27;s new textile factories were devoted to the manufacture of simple cotton bags. The price per pound of cotton plummeted from $1 at the end of the Civil War to an average of 20 cents in the 1870s, nine cents in the 1880s, and seven cents in the 1890s. By 1898, it had fallen to five cents a pound -while costing seven cents to produce. Once-prosperous planters suffered significant hardship.

Thousands of freedmen became tenant farmers or sharecroppers rather than hire out to labor gangs. Through the lien system, small-county merchants assumed a central role in cotton production, monopolizing the supply of equipment, fertilizers, seeds and foodstuffs needed to make sharecropping possible. By the 1890s, as cotton prices plummeted below production costs, 80–90% of cotton growers, whether owner or tenant, were in debt to lien merchants.

Indebted Georgia cotton growers responded by embracing the &quot;agrarian radicalism&quot; manifested, successively, in the 1870s with the Granger movement, in the 1880s with the Farmers&#x27; Alliance, and in the 1890s with the Populist Party. In 1892, Congressman Tom Watson joined the Populists, becoming the most visible spokesman for their predominately Western Congressional delegation. Southern Populists denounced the convict lease system, while urging white and black small farmers to unite on the basis of shared economic self-interest. They generally refrained from advocating social equality.

In his essay &#x27;The Negro Question in the South,&#x27; Watson framed his appeal for a united front between black and white farmers declaring:

&quot;You are kept apart that you may be separately fleeced of your earnings. You are made to hate each other because upon that hatred is rested the keystone of the arch of financial despotism which enslaves you both. You are deceived and blinded that you may not see how this race antagonism perpetuates a monetary system which beggars both.&quot;

Southern Populists did not share their Western counterparts&#x27; emphasis on Free Silver and bitterly opposed their desire for fusion with the Democratic Party. They had faced death threats, mob violence and ballot-box stuffing to challenge the monopoly of their states&#x27; Bourbon Democrat political machines. The merger with the Democratic Party in the 1896 Presidential election dealt a fatal blow to Southern Populism. The Populists nominated Watson as William Jennings Bryan&#x27;s vice-president, but Bryan selected New England industrialist Arthur Sewall as a concession to Democratic leaders.

Watson was not reelected. As the Populist Party disintegrated, through his periodical &quot;The Jeffersonian&quot;, Watson crusaded as an anti-Catholic and (eventually) a white supremacist. He attacked the socialism, which had attracted many former Populists. He campaigned with little success for the party&#x27;s candidate for President in 1904 and 1908. Watson continued to exert influence in Georgia politics, and provided a key endorsement in the gubernatorial campaign of M. Hoke Smith.

===Disenfranchisement and court challenges===
A former cabinet member in Grover Cleveland&#x27;s administration, M. Hoke Smith broke with Cleveland because of his support for Bryan. Hoke Smith&#x27;s tenure as governor was noted for the passage of Jim Crow laws and the 1908 constitutional amendment that required a person to satisfy qualifications for literacy tests and property ownership for voting. Because a grandfather clause was used to waive those requirements for most whites, the legislation effectively secured the disenfranchisement of African Americans. Georgia&#x27;s amendment was made following 1898 and 1903 Supreme Court decisions that had upheld similar provisions in the constitutions of Mississippi and Alabama.

The new provisions were devastating for the African-American community and poor whites, as losing the ability to register to vote meant they were excluded from serving on juries or in local office, as well as losing all representation at local, state and Federal levels. In 1900 African Americans numbered 1,035,037 in Georgia, nearly 47% of the state&#x27;s population.

Litigation in Georgia and elsewhere brought some relief, as in the overturning of the grandfather clause in the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, &quot;Guinn v. United States&quot; (1915). White-dominated state legislatures and the state Democratic parties quickly responded by creating new barriers to an expanded franchise, such as white-only primaries.

The last black member of the General Assembly, W. H. Rogers, resigned in 1907 as the final representative of the Reconstruction-era coastal Georgia political machine.

==Progressive era==
The rapidly growing middle class of professionals, businessmen and educated, worked to bring the Progressive Era to Georgia in the early 20th century. The goal was to modernize the state, increase efficiency, apply scientific methods, promote education and eliminate waste and corruption. Key leaders were governors Joseph M. Terrell (1902–07) and Hoke Smith. Terrell pushed through important legislation covering judicial affairs, schools, food and drug regulation, taxation and labor measures. He failed to obtain necessary penal and railroad reforms.

 A representative local leader was newspaper editor Thomas Lee Bailey (1865–1945), who used his &quot;Cochran Journal&quot; to reach out to Bleckley County, from 1910 to 1925. The paper mirrored Bailey&#x27;s personality and philosophy for it was folksy, outspoken, and upbeat and covered a variety of local topics. Bailey was a strong advocate for diversified farming, quality education, civic and political reform, and controls on alcohol and gambling.

===Cotton===
In the early 1900s, Georgia experienced economic expansion in both the manufacturing and agricultural sectors. The cotton industry benefited from the depredations of the boll weevil further west. In 1911, Georgia produced a record 2.8 million bales of cotton. However, the boll weevil arrived in Georgia four years later. By 1921, infestation had reached such epidemic proportions that 45% of the state&#x27;s cotton crop was destroyed. Demand during World War I drove cotton prices to a high of $1 a pound. After 1919, however, cotton quickly fell to 10 cents per pound. Landowners ruined by the boll weevil and declining prices expelled their sharecroppers.

===African Americans===
Although blacks also participated in the Progressive movement, the state remained in the grip of Jim Crow. In 1934, Georgia&#x27;s poll tax, which also had excluded poor whites from voter rolls to reduce the Populist threat, was upheld in the Supreme Court case of &quot;Breedlove v. Suttles&quot; (1937). That challenge was brought by a poor white man seeking the ability to vote without paying a fee. By 1940 only 20,000 blacks in Georgia managed to register. In 1944 the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot; banned white primaries, and in 1945 Georgia repealed its poll tax. NAACP and other activists rapidly registered African Americans in cities such as Atlanta, but in rural areas they remained outside politics.

Starting around 1910, and increasing as jobs began to open up during World War I, tens of thousands of African Americans in the Great Migration moved to northern industrial cities out of the rural South for work, better education for their children, the right to vote and for escape from the violence of lynchings. From 1910 to 1940 and in a second wave from the 1940s to 1970, a total of more than 6.5 million African Americans left the South for northern and western industrial cities. They rapidly became urbanized, and many built successful middle-class lives as industrial workers. The demographics of the regions changed.

===Prohibition and Coca-Cola===
Prohibition was a central issue in local and state politics from the 1880s into the 1920s. Before World War I, it was widely believed that the solution to drunkenness was the religious revival, which would turn the sinner into a teetolaling Christian. The Drys were led by ministers and middle-class women of the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union, who succeeded in securing a local option law that dried up most of the rural counties. Atlanta and the other cities were wet strongholds.

By 1907, the much more effective Anti-Saloon League took over from the preachers and women and cut deals with the politicians, such as Hoke Smith. The League pushed through a prohibition law in 1907. However, the law had loopholes that allowed Georgians to import whiskey from other states through the mail, and provided for &quot;saloons&quot; that supposedly sold only non-alcoholic drinks. In 1915, the drys passed a state law that effectively closed nearly all the liquor traffic. Illegal distilling and bootlegging continued.
During this time, a non-alcoholic beverage, first introduced in 1886, gained in popularity. In 1886, when Atlanta and Fulton County passed prohibition legislation, pharmacist John Pemberton responded by developing Coca-Cola. It was essentially a non-alcoholic version of the popular French wine coca.
The first sales were at Jacob&#x27;s Pharmacy in Atlanta, on May 8, 1886. It was initially sold as a patent medicine for five cents a glass at soda fountains, which were popular in the United States at the time due to the belief that carbonated water was good for the health. In 1887, Asa Griggs Candler bought the cola company from Pemberton, and with aggressive regional, national and international marketing turned it into one of the largest and most profitable corporations in the New South. Candler was later elected Mayor of Atlanta, taking office immediately after the passage of Georgia&#x27;s state-wide prohibition law of 1915. He served from 1916 to 1919. Atlanta&#x27;s first airport, Candler Field was named in his honor. Candler Field was subsequently renamed Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.

===Social tension===
Georgia took the national spotlight, in 1915, with the lynching of Atlanta Jewish factory superintendent Leo Frank. Frank had been convicted, in 1913, of the murder of a white Irish Catholic employee, thirteen-year-old Mary Phagan. After Frank&#x27;s death sentence was commuted to life in prison by the outgoing Governor, an outraged lynch mob seized Frank from his jail cell and hanged him. Ringleaders calling themselves &#x27;The Knights of Mary Phagan&#x27; included prominent politicians, most notably former Governor Joseph Mackey Brown. Publisher Thomas E. Watson was accused of helping to instigate the violence, through inflammatory newspaper coverage.

The rising social tensions from new immigration, urban migration and rapid change contributed to revival of the Ku Klux Klan. On November 25, 1915, a group led by William J. Simmons burned a cross on top of Stone Mountain, inaugurating a revival of the 2nd Klan. The event was attended by 15 charter members and a few aging survivors of the original Klan. Atlanta was designated as its Imperial City. The Klan quickly grew to occupy a powerful role in both state and municipal politics. Governor Clifford Walker, who served from 1923 to 1927, was closely associated with the Klan. By the end of the decade, the organization suffered from a number of scandals, internal feuds, and voices raised in opposition. Klan membership in the state declined from a peak of 156,000 in 1925 to 1,400 in 1930.

===Women&#x27;s suffrage===

 Rebecca Latimer Felton (1835–1930) was the most prominent woman leader in Georgia. Born into a wealthy plantation family, she married an active politician, managed his career, and became a political expert. An outspoken feminist, she became a leader of the prohibition and woman&#x27;s suffrage movements, endorsed lynching, fought for reform of prisons, and filled leadership roles in many reform organizations. In 1922, she was appointed to the U.S. Senate. She was sworn in on November 21, 1922, and served one day. She was the first woman to serve in the Senate.

Although middle-class urban women were well-organized supporters of suffrage, the rural areas were hostile. The state legislature ignored efforts to let women vote in local elections, and not only refused to ratify the Federal Nineteenth Amendment, but took pride in being the first state to reject it. The Amendment passed nationally and Georgia women gained the right to vote in 1920. However, black women were largely excluded from voting by the state&#x27;s discriminatory devices until after the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 enforced their constitutional rights.

===Great Depression and Second World War===
The state was relatively prosperous in the 1910s. The price of cotton remained high, until the end of World War I. Lower wholesales prices in the 1920s had a negative impact on the rural economy, which, in turn, effected the entire state. By 1932, economic recession had deteriorated into a severe depression. Cotton prices decreased from a high of $1.00 a pound during World War I, to $. the late 1920s, to lows of 6 cents in 1931 and 1932. The Great Depression proved to be difficult, economically, for both rural and urban Georgia. Farmers and blue-collar workers were impacted the most. Georgia benefited from several New Deal programs, which raised cotton prices to $.11 or $.12 a pound, promoted rural electrification, and set up rural and urban work relief programs. Enacted during Roosevelt&#x27;s first 100 days in office, the Agricultural Adjustment Act paid farmers to plant less cotton, to reduce oversupply. Between 1933 and 1940, the New Deal injected $250 million into the Georgia economy. Franklin Delano Roosevelt visited Georgia on numerous occasions. He established his &#x27;Little White House&#x27; in Warm Springs, where the therapeutic waters offered treatment and relief for the President&#x27;s paralytic illness.

Roosevelt&#x27;s proposals were popular with many members of Georgia&#x27;s congressional delegation. The Civilian Conservation Corps put young men, formerly on relief, back to work. The Agricultural Adjustment Administration supported the price of cotton and peanuts. Work relief programs spread federal money across the state. However, the most powerful member of the Georgia delegation, Congressman Eugene Cox, often opposed legislation which favored labor and urban interests, particularly the National Industrial Recovery Act.

Georgia&#x27;s powerful governor Eugene Talmadge (1933–37) disliked Roosevelt and the New Deal. He was a former Agriculture Commissioner who promoted himself as a &#x27;real dirt farmer&#x27;, winning the support of his rural constituencies. Talmadge opposed many New Deal programs. Appealing to his white conservative base, Talmadge denounced New Deal programs that paid black workers wages equal to whites, and attacked what he described as the communist tendencies of the New Deal. The Roosevelt administration was often able to circumvent Talmadge&#x27;s opposition by working with pro-New Deal politicians, most notably Atlanta Mayor William B. Hartsfield. In the 1936 election, Talmadge unsuccessfully attempted to run for the Senate, but lost to pro-New Deal incumbent Richard Russell, Jr. The candidate he endorsed for Governor was also defeated. Under the pro-New Deal administration of State House speaker E.D. Rivers, by 1940 Georgia led the nation in the number of Rural Electrification Cooperatives and rural public housing projects. Between 1933 and the early 1940s the administration of Franklin D Roosevelt spent slightly over $250 million on projects in Georgia for projects such as malaria control, rural sanitation, hot lunches for school children, nursing services and art projects.

Re-elected Governor in 1940, Talmadge suffered a political setback when he fired a dean at the University of Georgia, on the grounds that the dean had advocated integration. When this action was opposed by the Georgia Board of Regents, Governor Talmadge reconfigured the board, appointing members more favorable to his views. This, in turn, led the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to withdraw accreditation from ten of the state&#x27;s colleges and universities. In 1942, Talmadge was defeated in his bid for reelection. However, he was reelected in 1946, but died before taking office. The death of the Governor-elect precipitated a political crisis known as the &quot;three governors controversy&quot;, which was only resolved after a legal ruling by the Georgia Supreme Court.

Factory production during World War II lifted Georgia&#x27;s economy out of recession. Marietta&#x27;s Bell Aircraft plant, the principal assembly site for the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber, employed nearly 28,000 people at its peak, Robins Air Field near Macon employed nearly 13,000 civilians; Fort Benning became the world&#x27;s largest infantry training school; and newly opened Fort Gordon became a major deployment center. Shipyards in Savannah and Brunswick built many of the Liberty Ships used to transport materiel to the European and Pacific Theaters. Following the cessation of hostilities, the state&#x27;s urban centers continued to thrive.

In 1946, Georgia became the first state to allow 18-year-olds to vote, and remained the only one to do so before passage of the 26th Amendment in 1971. (Three other states set the voting age at 19 or 20.) That same year, the Communicable Disease Center, later called the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was founded in Atlanta from staff of the former Malaria Control in War Areas offices.

From 1946 to 1955, some 500 new factories were constructed in the state. By 1950, more Georgians were employed in manufacturing than farming. At the same time, the mechanization of agriculture dramatically reduced the need for farm laborers. This precipitated another wave of urban migration, as former sharecroppers and tenant farmers moved chiefly to the urban Midwest, West and Northeast, as well as to Georgia&#x27;s own burgeoning urban centers.

During the war, Atlanta&#x27;s Candler Field was the nation&#x27;s busiest airport in terms of flight operations. Afterwards Mayor Hartsfield lobbied successfully to make the city Delta Air Lines&#x27; hub for commercial air travel, based on Atlanta&#x27;s strategic location in relation to the nation&#x27;s major population centers. The airport was subsequently renamed, in his honor.

==Civil rights movement==

African Americans who served in the segregated military during World War II returned to a still segregated nation and a South which still enforced Jim Crow laws. Many were motivated to participate in the NAACP and other groups to enforce their constitutional rights, especially the right to vote, and the right of their children to an equal education. Following the 1946 U.S. Supreme Court decision in &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot;, which overturned white primaries, NAACP activists worked to register voters. Statewide, 135,000 blacks registered to vote in 1946, and 85,000 did vote.

Atlanta, home to a number of traditional black colleges, sustained a large, educated, middle-class black community which produced leaders of the Civil Rights Movement. In the postwar period, the new movement for change was carried forward by several groups, with somewhat different agendas, but united in the goal of civil rights for African Americans. The voting rights campaign in Atlanta was spearheaded by the All Citizen&#x27;s Registration Committee.

The idea of change was not universally embraced. The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) was denounced by Governor Marvin Griffin, who pledged to keep Georgia&#x27;s schools segregated, &quot;come hell or high water&quot;.

In January 1956, Bobby Grier became the first black player to participate in the Sugar Bowl. He is also regarded as the first black player to compete at a bowl game in the Deep South, though others such as Wallace Triplett had played in games like the 1948 Cotton Bowl in Dallas. Grier&#x27;s team, the Pittsburgh Panthers, was set to play against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. However, Georgia&#x27;s Governor Marvin Griffin beseeched Georgia Tech&#x27;s president Blake Van Leer and its players to not participate in this racially integrated game. Griffin was widely criticized by news media leading up to the game, and protests were held at his mansion by Georgia Tech students. After delivering a commencement speech at the all-Black Morris Brown College, Van Leer was summoned by the board of regents where he was quoted Despite the governor&#x27;s objections, Georgia Tech upheld the contract and proceeded to compete in the bowl. In the game&#x27;s first quarter, a pass interference call against Grier ultimately resulted in Yellow Jackets&#x27; 7–0 victory. Grier stated that he has mostly positive memories about the experience, including the support from teammates and letters from all over the world.

In 1958 the state passed legislation to restrict voter registration by requiring illiterate candidates to answer 20 of 30 questions of comprehension posed by white registrars. In practice, it was used subjectively to disqualify blacks. In rural counties such as Terrell, black voting registration was repressed. After the legislation, although the county was 64% black in population, only 48 blacks managed to register to vote.

Atlanta-born minister, Martin Luther King Jr., emerged as a national leader in the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955 in Alabama. The son of a Baptist minister, King earned a doctorate from Boston University and was part of the educated middle class that had developed in Atlanta&#x27;s African-American community. The success of the Montgomery boycott led to King&#x27;s joining with others to form the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in Atlanta in 1957, to provide political leadership for the Civil Rights Movement across the South. Black churches had long been important centers of their communities. Ministers and their thousands of congregations throughout the South were at the forefront of the civil rights struggle.
The SCLC led a desegregation campaign in Albany, Georgia in 1961. This campaign, however, failed to rally significant support or to achieve any dramatic victories. Nonetheless the Albany campaign provided important lessons, which were put to use in the more successful Birmingham campaign of $6 Alabama. National opinion eventually turned in favor of the moral position of civil rights for all citizens. Before his assassination, President John F. Kennedy prepared and submitted a Civil Rights bill to Congress. Kennedy&#x27;s successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, made the legislation a priority in his administration. In 1964, President Johnson secured passage of the Civil Rights Act. The following year he secured passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

African Americans throughout the South registered to vote and began to re-enter the political process. By the 1960s, the proportion of African Americans in Georgia had declined to 28% of the state&#x27;s population, after waves of migration to the North and some in-migration by whites. With their voting power diminished, it took some years for African Americans to win a state-wide office. Julian Bond, a noted civil rights leader, was elected to the state House in 1965, and served multiple terms there and in the state senate.

Atlanta Mayor Ivan Allen, Jr. testified before Congress in support of the Civil Rights Act, and Governor Carl Sanders worked with the Kennedy administration to ensure the state&#x27;s compliance. Ralph McGill, editor and syndicated columnist at the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot;, earned both admiration and enmity by writing in support of the Civil Rights Movement. However, the majority of white Georgians continued to oppose integration.

In 1966, Lester Maddox was elected Governor of Georgia. Maddox, who opposed forced integration, had gained fame by threatening African-American civil rights demonstrators who tried to enter his restaurant. After taking office, Maddox appointed more African Americans to positions of responsibility than any governor since Reconstruction.

In 1969, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a successful lawsuit against Georgia, requiring the state to integrate public schools. In 1970, newly elected Governor Jimmy Carter declared in his inaugural address that the era of racial segregation had ended.
In 1972 Georgians elected Andrew Young to Congress as the first African American since Reconstruction.

==Late 20th century to present==

In 1980, construction was completed on an expansion of William B. Hartsfield International Airport. The busiest in the world, it was designed to accommodate up to 55 million passengers a year. The airport became a major engine for economic growth. With the advantages of cheap real estate, low taxes, right-to-work laws and a regulatory environment limiting government interference, the Atlanta metropolitan area became a national center of finance, insurance, and real estate companies, as well as the convention and trade show business. As a testament to the city&#x27;s growing international profile, in 1990 the International Olympic Committee selected Atlanta as the site of the 1996 Summer Olympics. Taking advantage of Atlanta&#x27;s status as a transportation hub, in 1991 UPS established its headquarters in a suburb. In 1992, construction finished on Bank of America Plaza, it was the tallest building in the U.S. outside New York or Chicago at the time of its completion.

Following national Democratic support for civil rights legislation, Georgia, along with the rest of the formerly Democratic Solid South, gradually shifted to support Republicans, first in presidential elections. Realignment was hastened by the turbulent one-term presidency of native-son Jimmy Carter, the popularity of Ronald Reagan, organizational efforts of the Republican Party, and the perception of a growing liberalism within the national Democratic Party. While Carter would prevail in the state in both his 1976 and 1980 campaigns, and another southern governor, Bill Clinton, would win the state in 1992, Republicans increasingly held the upper hand in presidential politics from the mid-1960s onward.

As the era of old south Democratic control, symbolized by iconic personalities Herman Talmadge and Georgia Speaker of the House Tom Murphy drew to an end, new Republican leaders took their place. Republican congressman Newt Gingrich, the acknowledged leader of the Republican Revolution, was elected Speaker of the House. His seat represented the northern suburbs of Atlanta. Bob Barr, another Georgia Republican congressman, was a leader of the campaign to impeach President Bill Clinton in 1998.

In this shifting political climate, many leading Georgia Democrats, most notably Governor Zell Miller (1990–99), drifted to the right. After being appointed to the U.S. Senate by his successor, Roy Barnes, following the death of early state GOP standard-bearer Paul Coverdell in 2000, Miller emerged as a prominent ally of George W. Bush on the war in Iraq, Social Security privatization, tax cuts, and other conservative-backed issues. He delivered a controversial keynote speech at the 2004 Republican convention where he endorsed Bush for reelection and denounced the liberalism of his Democratic Party colleagues. In a pattern common across the region, other white Democrats retired or switched parties as Democrats&#x27; fortunes declined with white voters, including future Republican governors Sonny Perdue and Nathan Deal.

In 2002, Georgia elected Perdue as the first Republican governor since Reconstruction, defeating Barnes. Shortly thereafter, Republicans gained control of both chambers of the state legislature and all state-wide elected offices. CNN reported that in 2008 presidential election exit polls, 39% of the voters identified as conservatives; 48% moderates and 13% liberals. 37% identified as &quot;White Evangelical/Born-Again,&quot; and they voted 89% for Republican John McCain, who carried the state&#x27;s electoral votes. The other 63% voted two-to-one for Democrat Barack Obama, the first African American to be elected as president. In 2012 and 2016, Republicans continued to prevail in Georgia, with nominees Mitt Romney and Donald Trump carrying the state in those elections; Romney lost nationally to Obama, while Trump won the electoral college vote and thus the presidency against former U.S. senator, secretary of state, and first lady Hillary Clinton.

Signs the Republicans might be losing their grip on the state began to appear in the state&#x27;s 2018 elections. While the governor&#x27;s office remained in Republican hands (Brian Kemp, then the state&#x27;s secretary of state, avoided a potential run-off against an African American woman, former state house minority party leader Stacey Abrams, by just 17,488 votes), in the state legislature they fared more poorly: Republicans lost eight seats in the Georgia House of Representatives (winning 106), while Democrats gained ten (winning 74); in the Georgia Senate, Republicans lost two seats (winning 35 seats), while Democrats gained two seats (winning 21). In congressional races that year, Democrats also posted a gain when five Democratic U.S. Representatives were elected with Republicans winning nine seats (one winning with just 419 votes over the Democratic challenger, and one seat being lost).

Democrats made a major breakthrough in 2020, when Georgians narrowly backed a Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, who was the first to prevail in the state since Bill Clinton in 1992. Biden won Georgia&#x27;s electoral college vote over incumbent GOP president Donald Trump by 12,670 votes, on his way to a national electoral college victory. Continuing the Democratic trend in early 2021, challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock successfully won run-off elections against Republican incumbents to become the first Democrats to represent the state in the U.S. Senate in 18 years.

<text>Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Limited (RRTM) is a joint venture between British aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce plc (UK) and French helicopter engine specialist Safran Helicopter Engines (formerly known as Turbomeca). It manufactured aero-engines and provided associated support services to end users.

The joint venture has been responsible for the development and production of two aero-engines, the Adour turbofan, and the RTM322 turboshaft powerplant. During 2013, Turbomeca bought out Rolls-Royce&#x27;s involvement in the RTM322 programme; accordingly, all manufacturing-related responsibility activities with this engine were transferred to Turbomeca solely during the mid-2010s.

==History==
During the definition phase of what became the SEPECAT Jaguar ground attack aircraft, a separate partnership was formed between British aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce and French helicopter engine specialist Turbomeca to develop the Adour, an afterburning turbofan engine, to power the aircraft. This engine would not only be adopted for the Jaguar, but also for aircraft such as the BAE Systems Hawk, the McDonnell Douglas T-45 Goshawk, and Mitsubishi T-2 trainer aircraft, as well as the Mitsubishi F-1 ground attack fighter. In excess of 2,800 Adour engines would eventually be produced, reportedly amassing a cumulative total of 7,000,000 flying hours.

During 1995, it was announced that the Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 turboshaft engine had been selected to power the British Army&#x27;s fleet of AgustaWestland Apache attack helicopters; accordingly, the RTM322 took the place of the standard General Electric T700 engine that powered all previous versions of the Apache. At the time, there were hopes that other Apache operators could opt to procure the engine over the T700 as well. The initial version of the RM322 was qualified for use by the British Ministry of Defence during 2003.

Over the following decades, the RTM322 engine was adopted by various operators to power a number of rotorcraft, including the NHIndustries NH90 and AgustaWestland AW101 medium-sized transport helicopters, as well as being used on the UK&#x27;s Apache helicopter fleet, and the Eurocopter X³, a high speed technology demonstrator. During 2003, it was announced that the joint venture was undertaking the development of an enhanced version of the RTM322, taking the powerplant from the current 2,400shp (1,800 kW) power range to beyond 2,500shp in the near term and potentially 3,300shp in the longer term after further improvements are finalised. Keith Reid, Rolls-Royce Turbomeca international marketing manager, noted that the RM322 had been originally designed with future growth in mind, and that operators had been placing an increasing emphasis upon hot and high flight capabilities, which necessitated more engine power is being available.

During 2013, responsibility for undertaking all activities related to the RTM322 engine, including manufacturing and maintenance/services, began to be transferred to Turbomeca following an agreement between Rolls-Royce and Turbomeca to buy out the former in exchange for around €293 million ($381 million). Over the following three years, Turbomeca progressively took on this work, the first 12 months were generally dedicated to taking on RM322 maintenance and repair activities, the following 12 months were spent on building up its testing capabilities, while the remainder were involved the realign of the engine&#x27;s supply chain with the French firm and internalise any manufacturing activities previously performed by Rolls-Royce.

<doc id="581146" wikidata="Q796803" url="?curid=581146" title="BMW Z8">
<text>The BMW Z8 is a roadster produced by German automotive manufacturer BMW from 1998 to 2003. The Z8 was developed under the codename &quot;E52&quot; between 1993 and 1999, through the efforts of a design team led by Chris Bangle from 1993 to 1995. The exterior was designed by Henrik Fisker and the interior by Scott Lempert.

The Z8 originally was designed as a styling exercise intended to evoke and celebrate the 1956–1959 BMW 507. Prototypes were spotted testing between 1996 and 1999. A concept was later developed to preview the Z8, called the Z07 and was showcased in October 1997 at the Tokyo Motor Show.

==Z07 Concept==
The Z07 Concept had been based on the concurrently running E52 development programme. As a result, practical and regulatory considerations necessitated very few changes for the production model. Comparatively, the windshield of the series production Z8 was more upward, and the car had a larger front airdam. The Z8 hardtop differed from the Z07 in being a double-bubble form with a tapering fairing versus a single dome with a truncated convex rear. The Z07&#x27;s exotic driver&#x27;s side helmet fairing was never intended for production, in order to allow easy operation of the power soft top.

The side turn signal repeaters were integrated into the side vents in a fashion that rendered them invisible until activated. The vintage simplicity of the interior was preserved by hiding the modern equipment under retracting panels. Complex compound curves were made through the use of an expensive MIG-welded aluminium space frame.
==Specifications and features==

The Z8 cost US$128,000, had an all-aluminium chassis and body, and used a V8 engine which has a power output of at 6,600 rpm and of torque at 3,800 rpm. This engine, known internally as the S62, was built by BMW Motorsport and was shared with the E39 M5 sports saloon. The engine is located behind the front axle in order to provide the car with a 50/50 weight distribution. The factory claimed a acceleration time of 4.7 seconds; &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine achieved in 4.2 seconds. &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; measured the car&#x27;s lateral grip at 0.92. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine also tested the car and found that it outperformed the contemporary benchmark Ferrari 360 Modena in three important performance categories: acceleration, handling, and braking. As with most BMW automobiles the top speed of the Z8 was electronically limited to with the delimited top speed amounting to an estimated .

The Z8 used neon exterior lighting, the tail lights and turn indicators are powered by neon tubes that offer quicker activation than standard lightbulbs and are expected to last for the life of the vehicle. Due to the quirk in the US FMVSS regulations, the turn signal indicators in the tail lights are entirely in red colour.

Every car was shipped with a colour-matching metal hardtop with a rear defroster. Unlike many contemporary hardtops, which are provided for practical rather than stylistic considerations, the hardtop of the Z8 was designed from the outset to complement the lines of the car&#x27;s styling.

In order to keep the interior uncluttered, a number of functions were integrated into multifunction controls. For example, the power windows and mirrors were controlled by a single instrument. Also, the centre-mounted instrument cluster was canted slightly toward the driver. The displacement of gauges to the middle of the dashboard was intended to offer an unimpeded view of the hood and the road ahead.

In order to promote the Z8 to collectors and reinforce media speculation about the car&#x27;s &quot;instant classic&quot; potential, BMW promised that a 50-year stockpile of spare parts would be maintained in order to support the Z8 fleet. Due to the limited volume of production, all elements of the car were constructed or finished by hand, thereby compounding the importance of ongoing manufacturer support for the type. The price and production process allowed BMW to offer customised options to interested buyers. A significant number of cars with bespoke paint and interior treatments were produced over the course of the four-year production run by BMW Individual, a division of BMW AG.

===Z8 Safety Car===
A safety car variant of the Z8 was produced for use in the 2001 season of MotoGP.
==Alpina Roadster V8==
With production of the Z8 completed by November 2002, the Z8 was replaced by the Alpina Roadster V8 in 2003. The Alpina was a departure from the hard-edged sporting focus of the original car, and elements of grand touring intent were evident throughout this final iteration. Instead of the original 6-speed manual and 4.9 L (S62) engine featured in original Z8, the Alpina came only with an automatic transmission, utilising a 5-speed BMW Steptronic transmission mated to a 4.8 L Alpina-tuned BMW M62 V8 engine from the Alpina E39 B10 V8 S. In order to complete the car&#x27;s transition from a sports car to a refined grand tourer, a softer suspension setting was used. The standard Z8&#x27;s run-flat tyres on wheels were discarded in favor of conventional tyres with softer sidewalls mounted on Alpina wheels. A new softer grade of Nappa leather replaced the Z8&#x27;s less supple specification, and special Alpina gauges were fitted on the dash board cluster. An Alpina steering wheel with three solid spokes replaced the original, which could not be retrofitted with shift paddles for the automatic transmission. Gear selection was displayed in an Alpina-specific display mounted in front of the steering wheel.

Performance and power output of the Alpina roadster V8 differed from that of the standard car in that the peak power was reduced to , while peak torque was raised to ; this torque was available at significantly lower rpm than the original in order to enable more relaxed cruising. Curiously, the electronically limited top speed was officially raised to .

Production of the Roadster V8 amounted to 555 units, 450 of which were exported to the U.S. market and only eight to the UK. In the United States, this special edition of the Z8 was sold directly through BMW dealerships, marking a first for Alpina, whose cars had never been sold through retail channels in the U.S.
==Bertone Birusa==

Unveiled at the 2003 Geneva Motor Show, the Birusa is a futuristically styled concept car conceived and developed by Bertone. Based on the Z8, it shares the 4.9 L V8 engine from the donor car generating mated to a 6-speed manual transmission and has carbon fibre gull-wing doors. It also has a variety of innovative technological features including a sunroof that filters UV light, multilingual voice control and a night vision system.

==Production==
The Z8&#x27;s spaceframe was produced in the Dingolfing Plant and the car was hand-finished in Munich. A total of 5,703 Z8s were built: 3,160 for the world market and 2,543 for the North American market.

==In popular culture==

The Z8 was showcased as James Bond&#x27;s car in the film &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; released in November 1999, from scenes shot in early April 1999. In the film, it is driven by Bond for his mission in Azerbaijan until it is sliced in half by a helicopter equipped with cutting saws. The vehicle is equipped with surface to air missiles that is mostly activated through the car&#x27;s steering wheel used as a targeting display, and can also be remote controlled through the use of the vehicle&#x27;s keychain. This was the final BMW car to appear in the James Bond franchise as its 3-year film deal with BMW expired. It later reappeared in the James Bond video games &quot;007 Racing&quot; and &quot;Agent Under Fire&quot;, the latter of which featured the car on the cover.

<text>Jugra (Jawi: جوڬرا, ) is a mukim, historical town and a former royal town in Kuala Langat District, Selangor, Malaysia. It is separated from Pulau Carey by the Langat River. The town is administered by the Zone 16 of the Kuala Langat Municipal Council.

==History==
Jugra was the royal capital of Selangor when the then ruling monarch, Sultan Abdul Samad, built Istana Jugra (Jugra Palace) and moved there in 1875. It was situated in a strategic location, not exactly at the river mouth but easily accessible from the Straits of Malacca, and protected by a hill, Bukit Jugra; which stands clearly out above the low-lying mangrove swamps. For centuries, it served as a familiar landmark to navigators of the Straits of Malacca. Chinese, Arab and European mariners marked it in their charts; Bukit Jugra was also known to many foreign navigators as Parcelar Hill, derived from the Arabic name for it, &quot;balasar&quot;.

It was during this time that Jugra also briefly became the centre of British administration in Selangor, although this was soon moved to Klang and, a decade later, to Kuala Lumpur. The Sultan continued to live at Jugra until he died in 1898, and the new Sultan, Sultan Alauddin Sulaiman Shah also known as Sultan Sulaiman was proclaimed there. This was the last important occasion in Jugra. Sultan Alauddin Sulaiman subsequently moved his official residence to the Istana Alam Shah in Klang further north in 1905, where he lived for the next 35 years.

After that, Jugra quickly shrank to become a backwater, as even the Kuala Langat constituency&#x27;s administration was relocated to Banting.

==Places of interest==

Among places of interest in this quaint town are royal palaces such as Istana Bandar, Makam Sultan Abdul Samad, a royal mausoleum, and mosques such as Masjid Alaeddin. The nearby Bukit Jugra is used for paragliding.

==Access==
===Car===
Federal Route 5 from Klang or Port Dickson, and SKVE from Kajang or Putrajaya.

===Public transportation===
Rail transit services are unavailable in Jugra, and rapidKL buses do not ply this area, but &quot;Smart Selangor&quot; buses (route BTG2), a free bus service subsidized by the Selangor state government, connects the nearby hamlet of Permatang Pasir (about 2 km east) to Banting town. From Banting town, passengers can then switch to another &quot;Smart Selangor&quot; route (route BTG1) which goes to KLIA 2 and ERL Salak Tinggi.

<text>The Michigan Militia is a paramilitary Michigan-based organization founded in 1994 by Norman Olson, a veteran of the U.S. Air Force. The group was formed in response to perceived encroachments by the federal government on the rights of citizens. It is part of the wider American militia movement.

== Organization ==
At its peak in the mid-1990s, the Michigan Militia Corps claimed to have 10,000 members, although its membership was estimated to be several hundred by 2010. The Militia&#x27;s main areas of focus are paramilitary training and emergency response. They are also involved in search and rescue, community preparedness and disaster relief. In some brigades, participating in paramilitary training is not a requirement for membership.

== History ==

=== Origin ===
The Michigan Militia Corps (MMC) were founded in 1994 by Norman &quot;Norm&quot; Olson, a former US Air Force non-commissioned officer from Alanson, Michigan.

The early meetings of the Michigan militia were attended by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols before they carried out the Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995, which drew media attention to the organization. Olson published a press release blaming the Japanese for the bombing, supposedly in retaliation for a clandestine US-sponsored gas attack in the Tokyo subway system. The leadership of the MMC forced Olson to resign one month after the bombing. On June 15, 1995, he testified before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism along with militia leaders from other states. Olson&#x27;s opening statement included the following words:Not only does the Constitution specifically allow the formation of a Federal Army, it also recognizes the inherent right of the people to form militia. Further, it recognizes that the citizen and his personal armaments are the foundation of the militia. 

=== Leadership conflicts ===
Following his resignation, Olson continued to be involved with the militia, although he increasingly criticized the group for being &quot;too moderate&quot;. Olson sought to regain his position as the leader of the MMC, but lost in July 1995 an electoral contest against Lynn Van Huizen, a US Army veteran who saw service in Vietnam. Following this defeat, Olson founded his own militia, the Northern Michigan Regional Militia, in order to &quot;resurrect and re-energize what the militia initially was&quot;. In response, Van Huizen distanced himself from Olson, stating that the group rejected his &quot;radical views&quot;.

On February 15, 1998 a dissident faction challenged the leadership of Van Huizen and Tom Wayne, the Chief of Staff for the Michigan Militia, mainly due to Van Huizen and Wayne&#x27;s project of expanding the powers of the state command. On March 15 the breakaway group elected Joe Pilchak, a draftsman from Genesee County, as their state commander. Van Huizen and Wayne continued to hold the constitutionalist faction of the MMC – named the Michigan Militia Wolverines – in the western part of Michigan, although Pilchak&#x27;s &quot;millennial&quot; wing has proven stronger in the eastern part of the state. In the years that followed the Oklahoma City bombing, however, the Michigan Militia&#x27;s Corps membership slowly declined.

== Views ==
Van Huizen, who served as the commander of the militia between 1996 and 1998, was considered a more moderate militia leader by the FBI&#x27;s 1999 report Project Megiddo: &quot;A number of militia leaders, such as Lynn Van Huizen of the Michigan Militia Corps – Wolverines, have gone to some effort to actively rid their ranks of radical members who are inclined to carry out acts of violence and/or terrorism.&quot;

According to scholar Mack Mariani, both Olson and Van Huizen – and leaders of the American militia movement in general – nonetheless share the view that &quot;the American Republic is in such a deep state of crisis that average citizens must join the militia movement in order to defend themselves against an increasingly tyrannical government and out-of-control government agents.&quot; The mythology of the American Revolution is also significant among militia leaders like Olson or Wayne, who viewed themselves as the last defenders of the true principles of the revolution.

<text>Sir Ben Golden Emuobowho Okri (born 15 March 1959) is a Nigerian-born British poet and novelist. Considered one of the foremost African authors in the postmodern and post-colonial traditions, Okri has been compared favourably to authors such as Salman Rushdie and Gabriel García Márquez. In 1991, his novel &quot;The Famished Road&quot; won the Booker Prize. Okri was knighted at the 2023 Birthday Honours for services to literature.

==Biography==
=== Early years and education ===
Ben Okri is a member of the Urhobo people; his father was Urhobo, and his mother was half-Igbo (&quot;from a royal family&quot;). He was born in Minna in west central Nigeria to Grace and Silver Okri in 1959. His father, Silver, moved his family to London when Okri was less than two years old so that he could study law. Okri thus spent his earliest years in London and attended primary school in Peckham. In 1966, Silver moved his family back to Nigeria, where he practised law in Lagos, providing free or discounted services for those who could not afford it. After attending schools in Ibadan and Ikenne, Okri began his secondary education at Urhobo College at Warri, in 1968, when he was the youngest in his class. His exposure to the Nigerian civil war and a culture in which his peers at the time claimed to have had visions of spirits provided inspiration for Okri&#x27;s fiction.

At the age of 14, after being rejected for admission to a short university programme in physics because of his youth and lack of qualifications, Okri experienced a revelation that poetry was his chosen calling. He began writing articles on social and political issues, but these never found a publisher. He then wrote short stories based on those articles, and some were published in women&#x27;s journals and evening papers. Okri has said that his criticism of the government in some of this early work led to his name being placed on a death list, and necessitated his departure from the country.

=== Move to England, 1978 ===
In 1978, he moved back to England and studied comparative literature at Essex University with a grant from the Nigerian government. But when funding for his scholarship fell through, Okri found himself homeless, sometimes living in parks and sometimes with friends. He has called this period &quot;very, very important&quot; to his work: &quot;I wrote and wrote in that period... If anything [the desire to write] actually intensified.&quot;

Okri&#x27;s success as a writer began when he published his debut novel, &quot;Flowers and Shadows&quot;, in 1980, at the age of 21. From 1983 to 1986, he served as poetry editor of &quot;West Africa&quot; magazine, and he regularly contributed to the BBC World Service between 1983 and 1985, continuing to publish throughout this period.

His reputation as an author was secured when his novel &quot;The Famished Road&quot; won the Booker Prize for Fiction in 1991, making him the prize&#x27;s youngest ever winner at 32. The novel was written during the time from 1988 that Okri lived in a Notting Hill flat that he rented from publisher friend Margaret Busby, and he has said: 
:&quot;Something about my writing changed round about that time. I acquired a kind of tranquillity. I had been striving for something in my tone of voice as a writer—it was there that it finally came together... That flat is also where I wrote the short stories that became [1988&#x27;s] &quot;Stars of the New Curfew&quot;.&quot;

In 1997, Okri was elected vice-president of the English Centre for International PEN and in 1999 was appointed a member of the board of the Royal National Theatre.

On 26 April 2012, he was appointed vice-president of the Caine Prize for African Writing, having been on the advisory committee and associated with the prize since it was established 13 years earlier.

Okri was appointed as a vice-president of the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in 2022.

==Literary career==

Since the 1980 publication of &quot;Flowers and Shadows&quot;, Okri has risen to international acclaim, and he often is described as one of Africa&#x27;s leading writers.

His best known work, &quot;The Famished Road&quot;, which won the 1991 Booker Prize, along with &quot;Songs of Enchantment&quot; (1993) and &quot;Infinite Riches&quot; (1998) make up a trilogy that follows Azaro, a spirit-child narrator, through the social and political turmoil of an African nation reminiscent of Okri&#x27;s remembrance of war-torn Nigeria.

Okri&#x27;s work is particularly difficult to categorise. It has been widely called postmodern, but some scholars have noted that the seeming realism with which he depicts the spirit-world challenges this categorisation. If Okri does attribute reality to a spiritual world, it is claimed, then his &quot;allegiances are not postmodern [because] he still believes that there is something ahistorical or transcendental conferring legitimacy on some, and not other, truth-claims.&quot; Alternative characterisations of Okri&#x27;s work suggest an allegiance to Yoruba folklore, New Ageism, spiritual realism, magical realism, visionary materialism, and existentialism.

Against these analyses, Okri has always rejected the categorisation of his work as magical realism, claiming that this categorisation is the result of laziness by critics and likening it to the observation that &quot;a horse ... has four legs and a tail. That doesn&#x27;t describe it.&quot; He has instead described his fiction as obeying a kind of &quot;dream logic&quot; and said that it is often preoccupied with the &quot;philosophical conundrum ... what is reality?&quot; insisting that:

:I grew up in a tradition where there are simply more dimensions to reality: legends and myths and ancestors and spirits and death ... Which brings the question: what is reality? Everyone&#x27;s reality is different. For different perceptions of reality we need a different language. We like to think that the world is rational and precise and exactly how we see it, but something erupts in our reality which makes us sense that there&#x27;s more to the fabric of life. I&#x27;m fascinated by the mysterious element that runs through our lives. Everyone is looking out of the world through their emotion and history. Nobody has an absolute reality.

Okri has noted the effect of personal choices: &quot;Beware of the stories you read or tell; subtly, at night, beneath the waters of consciousness, they are altering your world.&quot;

As well as novels, Okri&#x27;s published books include collections of poetry, essays and short stories. His short fiction has been described as more realistic and less fantastic than his novels, but it also depicts Africans in communion with spirits, while his poetry and nonfiction have a more overt political tone, focusing on the potential of Africa and the world to overcome the problems of modernity.

Okri has also written plays and film scripts, such as the text to Peter Krüger&#x27;s film &quot;N – The Madness of Reason&quot;, which won the 2015 Ensor Award for Best Film. In 2018, Okri adapted Albert Camus&#x27;s novella &quot;The Outsider&quot; as a play for the Print Room at The Coronet Theatre.

In April 2019, Okri gave the keynote address at the second Berlin African Book Festival, curated by Tsitsi Dangarembga.

Okri&#x27;s volume of collected poems, &quot;A Fire in My Head: Poems for the Dawn&quot;, was published in 2021, its title inspired by a line in Wole Soyinka&#x27;s poem &quot;Death in the Dawn&quot;: &quot;May you never walk / when the road waits, famished.&quot;

Alongside his writing, Okri has maintained an interest in visual art since his youth, and in 2023, he collaborated with colourist painter Rosemary Clunie in &quot;Firedreams&quot;, at the Bomb Factory, Marylebone, an exhiition of &quot;WordArt&quot; that featured large-scale paintings and sculptural obstructions. Okri and Clunie, his long-time friend, had previously brought together their paintings and stories in the 2017 book &quot;The Magic Lamp: Dreams of Our Age&quot;.

==Influences==

Okri has described his work as influenced as much by the philosophical texts on his father&#x27;s bookshelves as by literature, and cites the influence of Francis Bacon and Michel de Montaigne on his &quot;A Time for New Dreams&quot;. His literary influences include &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot;, &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;. Okri&#x27;s 1999 epic poem, &quot;Mental Fight&quot;, is named after a quotation from the poet William Blake&#x27;s &quot;And did those feet ...&quot;, and critics have noted a close relationship between Blake and Okri&#x27;s poetry.

Okri also was influenced by the oral tradition of his people and, particularly, by his mother&#x27;s storytelling: &quot;If my mother wanted to make a point, she wouldn&#x27;t correct me, she&#x27;d tell me a story.&quot; His firsthand experiences of civil war in Nigeria are said to have inspired many of his works.

On the final day of the 2021 COP26 climate meeting in Glasgow, Okri wrote about the existential threat posed by the climate crisis and how illequipped humans seem to confront the prospect of their self-inflicted extinction. Indeed, Okri says: &quot;We have to find a new art and a new psychology to penetrate the apathy and the denial that are preventing us making the changes that are inevitable if our world is to survive.&quot;

<text>BBC Worldwide Ltd. was the wholly owned commercial subsidiary of the BBC, formed out of a restructuring of its predecessor BBC Enterprises in January 1995. The company monetised BBC brands, selling BBC and other British programming for broadcast abroad with the aim of supplementing the income received by the BBC through the licence fee.

The company merged with BBC Studios on 1 April 2018, to form a new licensing, production, and distribution company under the BBC Studios name.

==History==
===Origins===
In addition to broadcasting, the BBC has for much of its life also produced additional materials for sale, the profits of which would be returned to the corporation to aid in the financing of these services. The highest profile of these early products was the listings magazine &quot;Radio Times&quot;, but the net revenue gained from this in 1928 (£93,686, 10s, 1d) only equated to 10% of total BBC income.

Prior to 1979, several BBC departments dealt with the exploitation and sale of BBC brands and programmes. BBC Publications, which produced magazines, books and other supplementary materials, had expanded rapidly in the late 1960s but still had difficulties with finances. In 1974, the division made a loss of £14,000. This was rectified however as the economic situation eased and by 1982, BBC Publications had a trading profit of £4.7 million. BBC Transcription Services licensed BBC Radio material to overseas broadcasters.

The selling of television programmes was at first handled in 1958 with the establishment of a business manager post. This gradually expanded until the establishment of the Television Promotions (later renamed Television Enterprises) department in 1960 under a general manager. In its first year, the department saw the sale of 550 programmes overseas with a turnover of £234,000, with a further 1,200 programmes sold the following year. Radio programmes were only exploited on the same level with the creation of the Radio Enterprises department in 1965. However, following the retirement of the Radio Enterprises general manager in 1969, the two departments were merged to form the BBC Enterprises department.

===BBC Enterprises===
On 15 May 1979, the department became BBC Enterprises Ltd., a subsidiary company wholly owned by the BBC. By 1982, the division were expanding with divisions responsible for home video (under the brand BBC Video), recorded audio (under the brands BBC Records and BBC Cassettes), film and merchanding. At this point the company had a turnover of £23 million. On 1 April 1986, all commercial activities of the corporation, including BBC Publications, was merged into BBC Enterprises Ltd.

In 1991, BBC World Service Television became the first commercially funded BBC broadcasting operation after the Foreign Office refused to pay for it. BBC Enterprises Ltd was subsequently reorganised on 1 January 1995 as BBC Worldwide Ltd. A review of the BBC&#x27;s commercial activities took place in 2004 and concluded that the sell off of BBC Worldwide&#x27;s assets would not be as advantageous as keeping the business and driving it harder. Instead, some changes to its remit, focus, structure and governance were made, e.g. that it would only publish titles in the UK linked to BBC programmes or key genres.

===Acquisitions and restructuring===
In 2004, BBC Video merged with Video Collection International to form 2 Entertain, which was 60% owned by BBC Worldwide; the following year the company sold &quot;Eve&quot; magazine to Haymarket Group and in 2006 the company sold a majority stake in BBC Books to publisher Random House.

In 2007, BBC Worldwide purchased a 75% stake in the travel guide publisher Lonely Planet, acquiring the final 25% of the company in 2011. The acquisition was part of the BBC&#x27;s strategy to grow its online portfolio and to increase its operations in Australia and the USA.

In January 2009, it was announced that Ofcom had put forward the recommendation that Channel 4 merge with either the commercial network Five or BBC Worldwide. Channel 4&#x27;s preferred option of a partnership with the latter was confirmed by chief executive Andy Duncan, who added: &quot;We&#x27;re in discussions with BBC Worldwide at the moment and they&#x27;re really very exciting.&quot; In the same year, the company was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Award for Enterprise in recognition of the companies growth and success.

In 2012, the company began to reorganise their divisions from a product based system to a location-based system, resulting in Jana Bennett leaving the company.

In 2013, BBC Worldwide sold Lonely Planet to Kentucky billionaire Brad Kelley&#x27;s NC2 Media for US$75 million (£51.5 million)— significantly less than the £130.2 million the BBC had paid for the company, at an £80 million loss.

In December 2016, BBC Worldwide and ITV plc announced BritBox, an international subscription streaming brand focusing on British television. The service was planned to launch first in the United States in 2017, with AMC Networks as a local partner.

In 2017, under revisions to the BBC Charter and subsequent BBC Trust approval, the broadcaster formed a second commercial subsidiary known as BBC Studios, to hold most of the broadcaster&#x27;s in-house production units (including Factual, Entertainment, Scripted, and Music &amp; Events). In return for the restructuring, which also allows the BBC to produce programmes for competing broadcasters to fund its public services, the BBC agreed to allow BBC Studios and third-parties to bid on tenders to produce its in-house non-news programmes over the next 11 years. On 29 November 2017, the BBC announced that BBC Worldwide would be merged into BBC Studios in April 2018, which gave the broadcaster an integrated division involved in both the production and sale of programming.

==Profit and sales (1995–2012)==

In 2013/14, BBC Worldwide generated headline profits of £157.4m and headline sales of £1,042.3m and returned £173.8m to the BBC.

In 2012/13, it made a profit of £156.3m on a turnover of £1,115.8m. The company had made a profit of £104m on a turnover of £1,085m in the previous financial year.

BBC Worldwide&#x27;s profit rate was 11.2% in 2011/2012, up slightly from 9.6% the previous year, down from a peak of 21.5% in 2002/2003, contrasting with 7.8% in 2003/2004.

==Operations==
In 2013, BBC Worldwide reorganised the company along geographical, rather than divisional, lines to better serve its audiences around the world and to position itself to take advantage of opportunities in high growth markets. The seven geographic markets are grouped into three regions: North America; UK, Australia and New Zealand; and Global Markets (Asia, CEMA, Latin America and Western Europe). The two global business areas – Content and Brands – set the strategic framework and parameters for activities within the regions and keep a close connection into BBC Worldwide&#x27;s parent, the BBC. Digital is embedded throughout the business.

BBC Worldwide was responsible for a wide range of commercial activities, primarily connected in some way with the output and public purposes of the main BBC. In the past, the business was divided into five operating businesses which covered the entire operations of the company: Channels; Content and Production; Brands, Consumers and New Ventures, Consumer Products and Sales and Distributions.

The Channels division was formed in 2005 and is the company&#x27;s largest generator of revenue and growth. It operates the broadcasting of several international channels and domestic networks:
* BBC America – 50.1% with AMC Networks owning 49.99%
* BBC Entertainment
* BBC First
* BBC Brit
* BBC Earth
* BBC HD
* BBC Lifestyle
* CBeebies
* CBBC
* British UKTV network of 10 channels (for a time owned 50/50 with Discovery, Inc.)
* BBC UKTV in Australia and New Zealand
* BBC Kids Australia

It was also involved with the now defunct:
* BBC Canada – 20% with Corus Entertainment owning 80%
* BBC Kids Canada – 20% with Knowledge Network Corporation owning 80%
* BBC Japan - JV with SKY PerfecTV!
* BBC Living
* BBC Knowledge

The Content and Production division was formed in 2006 and invests the company&#x27;s money into new productions by both the BBC and other independent productions. It also exploits the formats of BBC programmes and alters them to be suitable for an international audience – an example is the exploitation of the &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; brand to become &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; – maximising revenues by receiving a production fee from the local broadcaster as well as a sum from selling the initial re-versioning rights. The division works alongside the Sales and Distribution division, which sells the broadcasting rights to completed programmes made by the BBC and other producers – an example being the Red Production Company drama &quot;Mine All Mine&quot; for the ITV network in 2004. It includes the selling of individual clips through the BBC Motion Gallery to other broadcasters. In the financial year 2010/11, this division sold the rights to over 74,000 hours worth of television content.

The other two divisions of the company deal with the individual programme brands: Global Brands focuses on the international recognition of the brands while the Consumer Products division produces a variety of goods based around these brands. The work of the former includes expanding the brands into new areas – the Top Gear Live tour is a key example of this. The latter creates and sells a variety of consumer products, occasionally as a stake or partnership in another company, including VHS and DVD releases, spoken word and music audio products, CD-ROMs, video games, books and magazines.

==Assets and brands==
* Owned video publishing company 2 Entertain with products dual branded 2 Entertain and BBC.

These commercial activities allow BBC Worldwide to return profits and dividends to the BBC to re-invest in its broadcasting operations. In 2007/08 BBC Worldwide invested £75.1m in in-house and independent programmes commissioned by the BBC. However, the BBC has often been criticised for the amount of money it makes from BBC Worldwide. Some commercial rivals protest at the advantage the company has from being associated with and being able to exploit the programme catalogue and resources of the BBC to provide its goods and services.

<doc id="581175" wikidata="Q220997" url="?curid=581175" title="Vertex-transitive graph">
<text>In the mathematical field of graph theory, an automorphism is a permutation of the vertices such that edges are mapped to edges and non-edges are mapped to non-edges. A graph is a vertex-transitive graph if, given any two vertices and of , there is an automorphism such that
:formula_1

In other words, a graph is vertex-transitive if its automorphism group acts transitively on its vertices. A graph is vertex-transitive if and only if its graph complement is, since the group actions are identical.

Every symmetric graph without isolated vertices is vertex-transitive, and every vertex-transitive graph is regular. However, not all vertex-transitive graphs are symmetric (for example, the edges of the truncated tetrahedron), and not all regular graphs are vertex-transitive (for example, the Frucht graph and Tietze&#x27;s graph).

== Finite examples ==

Finite vertex-transitive graphs include the symmetric graphs (such as the Petersen graph, the Heawood graph and the vertices and edges of the Platonic solids). The finite Cayley graphs (such as cube-connected cycles) are also vertex-transitive, as are the vertices and edges of the Archimedean solids (though only two of these are symmetric). Potočnik, Spiga and Verret have constructed a census of all connected cubic vertex-transitive graphs on at most 1280 vertices.

Although every Cayley graph is vertex-transitive, there exist other vertex-transitive graphs that are not Cayley graphs. The most famous example is the Petersen graph, but others can be constructed including the line graphs of edge-transitive non-bipartite graphs with odd vertex degrees.

== Properties ==
The edge-connectivity of a connected vertex-transitive graph is equal to the degree &quot;d&quot;, while the vertex-connectivity will be at least 2(&quot;d&quot; + 1)/3.
If the degree is 4 or less, or the graph is also edge-transitive, or the graph is a minimal Cayley graph, then the vertex-connectivity will also be equal to &quot;d&quot;.

== Infinite examples ==
Infinite vertex-transitive graphs include:
* infinite paths (infinite in both directions)
* infinite regular trees, e.g. the Cayley graph of the free group
* graphs of uniform tessellations (see a complete list of planar tessellations), including all tilings by regular polygons
* infinite Cayley graphs
* the Rado graph

Two countable vertex-transitive graphs are called quasi-isometric if the ratio of their distance functions is bounded from below and from above. A well known conjecture stated that every infinite vertex-transitive graph is quasi-isometric to a Cayley graph. A counterexample was proposed by Diestel and Leader in 2001. In 2005, Eskin, Fisher, and Whyte confirmed the counterexample.

<text>Elephant Butte Reservoir is a reservoir on the southern part of the Rio Grande in the U.S. state of New Mexico, north of Truth or Consequences. The reservoir is the 84th largest man-made lake in the United States and the largest in New Mexico by total surface area and peak volume. It is the only place in New Mexico that one can find pelicans perched on or alongside the lake. There are also temporary US Coast Guard bases stationed at Elephant Butte. It is impounded by Elephant Butte Dam and is part of the largest state park in New Mexico, Elephant Butte Lake State Park.

The reservoir is part of the Rio Grande Project to provide power and irrigation to south-central New Mexico and western Texas. It began to be filled in 1915 and 1916 and at highstand was the largest man-made lake in the world.

The reservoir can hold of water from a drainage of 28,900 square miles (74,850 km2). It provides irrigation to 178,000 acres (720 km2) of land.

Fishing is a popular recreational activity on the reservoir, which contains striped bass, white bass, largemouth bass, crappie, walleye and catfish.

==Etymology==
The reservoir, dam, and surrounding area are named after a volcanic core, &quot;Elephant Butte,&quot; similarly to Devils Tower, in Wyoming. It is now an island in the lake when the water levels are high. The butte was said to have the shape of an elephant lying on its side.

==Dam construction and history==
The proposed dam featured in the 1906 Boundary Waters Convention between the United States and Mexico, which specified how much water should be delivered to Mexico after the dam&#x27;s completion.

Elephant Butte Dam was constructed between 1911 and 1916, with the reservoir fill starting in 1915. It was a major engineering feat in its day, and the enormous concrete dam is the major feature of the Elephant Butte National Register Historic District. New Mexico State Parks operates a visitor center, which contains information on the construction of the dam. It was the second-largest irrigation dam ever built at the time of its construction and was surpassed only in 1970 by the Aswan Dam in Egypt, and the reservoir was the largest man-made lake on earth.

A large construction community sprang up, which included two worker camps, railways, water tanks, cableway systems, and the former administration building of the Bureau of Reclamation. The &quot;camps&quot; housed American and Mexican workers throughout the dam&#x27;s construction. One of the former camps ended up under the reservoir itself; the other disappeared altogether. Moreover, many centuries-old communities and farming villages were &quot;obliterated&quot; by the filling of the reservoir and now lie at the bottom, including complete stone structures. Over 2,000 people were displaced by the filling of the reservoir.

When the reservoir started filling in 1915, irrigation use downstream was much more limited than today, which allowed the lake to remain relatively full. The lake experienced highstand for the first time in May 1942. That was the deepest highstand on record and stained the inundated landscape white with gypsum and other minerals and deposited sediments in the surrounding hills. In 1946, new irrigation infrastructure allowed heavy use of the water for farming downstream. By 1950, the &quot;full production&quot; use, coupled with intense drought in the upper basin, had caused the water levels to fall well below the initial 1915 levels. The lowest recorded storage level occurred on August 6, 1954. Another longer-lived highstand occurred in July 1985 and lasted with the spillway in use until 1988. Other highstands occurred in 1994 and 1995. Most of the photographs showing a full lake are from that relatively wet period. Drought has persisted since then, and as of February 2022, water levels have never recovered.

The former administration building of the Bureau of Reclamation still stands as a bed and breakfast facility. Along with other structures of the time, it is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. When the lake falls over 10 meters (30 feet) below maximum capacity, the ruins of the old machine shop and power plant are out of the water. Located near the southeastern shore, the 3000 square-foot concrete structure was once believed to be the remnants of the old field hospital that served the frequently-injured dam construction crew. That building is actually farther upstream in the aptly-named &quot;Hospital Canyon.&quot; Plans are underway to make the machine shop ruins a scuba destination in years with a high water level.

The American kidnapper and torturer David Parker Ray tortured his victims in his &quot;toy box&quot; trailer near the reservoir between 1957 and 1999. He is suspected of killing his victims and disposing of the bodies in the lake, but one survivor he had thought he killed was left near the American-Mexico border. Officials have conducted searches for his victims at the lake but have not found any human remains there or elsewhere that are related to Ray&#x27;s activities.

In 2014, a group celebrating a bachelor party on the exposed sediments of the lake discovered the head and tusks of a 3.2-million-year-old stegomastodon, a relative of true elephants, in excellent condition. That is one of the most complete finds of a stegomastodon in the area. The skull is on display at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science.

==Cast==
* Amitabh Bachchan as Yashvardhan &quot;Yash&quot; Raichand: Nandini&#x27;s husband, Rahul&#x27;s adoptive father and Rohan&#x27;s father. A Delhi-based business tycoon. Fiercely dominating, he insists on controlling the life of his wife and sons. Bachchan was Johar&#x27;s first choice for the portrayal of Yash. Johar added, &quot;As I wrote the film, I realised that Yash is the backbone of the film and I could only see one actor playing the role – Amitabh Bachchan.&quot; Bachchan, on his part, agreed to do the film without a script narration. Johar mentioned that he was initially scared to direct a star of the stature of Bachchan, but the latter &quot;soon became an actor instead of a superstar.&quot;
* Jaya Bachchan as Nandini Raichand: Yash&#x27;s wife, Rahul&#x27;s adoptive mother and Rohan&#x27;s mother. She shares a close bond with her sons but remains in the shadow of her husband. According to Johar, she was the &quot;obvious&quot; choice for the character of Nandini, and added that her &quot;acting prowess and stature&quot; were the other reasons for him preferring to cast her. The film also marked the return of Amitabh and Jaya together on screen after a gap of 18 years. Of her character, she said that Nandini was an extension of her own self. She elaborated, &quot;My personal feelings towards Shahrukh are similar to what I was supposed to portray in the film. There&#x27;s something about him that makes me want to mother him.&quot; She added that she modelled her character on Johar&#x27;s mother, Hiroo, who &quot;is a very emotional and sentimental person.&quot;
* Shah Rukh Khan as Rahul Raichand: Yash and Nandini&#x27;s adoptive son, Rohan&#x27;s adoptive elder brother, Anjali&#x27;s husband and Krish&#x27;s father. He feels indebted to Yash and Nandini and tries to fulfill all their wishes. However, he invites Yash&#x27;s wrath by falling in love with and marrying Anjali. When Johar offered the role to Khan, he immediately agreed to do it and accommodated his dates, despite having several other commitments. Khan described the character of Rahul by saying, &quot;I love the vulnerability and the honesty in his eyes. He has the appeal of a boy next door. Besides, his intensity and ability to convey emotions without words is amazing.&quot;
** Aryan Khan as child Rahul
* Kajol as Anjali Sharma Raichand: Pooja&#x27;s elder sister, Rahul&#x27;s wife and Krish&#x27;s mother. She is a fun-loving woman living in the Chandni Chowk area of Delhi. Belonging to a lower socio-economic group than the Raichand family, she is not accepted by Yash as his daughter-in-law. Karan Johar was initially hesitant to cast Kajol in the film, as he felt that she would refuse the offer. Had Kajol declined, Johar announced in his book &quot;An Unsuitable Boy&quot; that he was planning to offer the role to Aishwarya Rai Bachchan whom he had narrated the film to. Kajol however, was moved to tears during the script narration and agreed to do the film. In an interview to &quot;Filmfare&quot;, Kajol said, &quot;One tiny fact that Johar forgot to mention during his narration was just how much Punjabi my character spoke in the film. I nearly died when I saw the lines of dialogue on the first day of shooting.&quot; However, she learnt the right pronunciation and diction with the help of Yash Johar and the crew members.
* Hrithik Roshan as Rohan &quot;Laddu&quot; Raichand alias Yash: Yash and Nandini&#x27;s biological son, Rahul&#x27;s younger brother and Pooja&#x27;s husband.

Johar signed Roshan to play the character of Rohan after watching a rough cut of his debut film, &quot;Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai&quot; (2000). Roshan described his character as a &quot;buffer&quot; in a film that primarily focused on Bachchan and Shahrukh.
** Kavish Majumdar as child Rohan
* Kareena Kapoor as Pooja &quot;Poo&quot; Sharma Raichand: Anjali&#x27;s younger sister and Rohan&#x27;s wife. She is a sophisticated and glamorous girl, who helps Rohan in his plan to bring Rahul back to his home; in the process they fall in love. After spotting Kapoor at a party organised by &quot;Bombay Times&quot;, Johar decided to cast her immediately for the role of the glamorous diva, Poo. Kapoor stated that in her opinion, &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; was primarily Kajol&#x27;s film, and that her own character was a supporting one. In order to prepare for her role, she worked hard on her dancing skills, as she did not want audiences to know that she could not dance well.
** Malvika Raaj as child Pooja

She&#x27;s a socialite who loves and wants to marry Rahul, and Yash approves of her however backs out after learning Rahul&#x27;s feelings for Anjali. Following the success of Johar&#x27;s previous and debut film, &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; (1998), which starred Khan, Kajol and Mukerji, he wanted her presence in this film too. He thus cast Mukerji in a guest appearance.

==Production==
===Development===

After the success of Karan&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; (1998), he began work on a story dealing with the concept of &quot;generations&quot;. The idea initially revolved around two daughters-in-law. However, on the advice of his cousin, filmmaker Aditya Chopra, who thought that the male characters would be too weak, Karan decided to tweak the story-line to make it the story of two brothers.

The inspiration behind &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; came from Yash Chopra&#x27;s &quot;Kabhi Kabhie&quot; (1976). On being inspired by the classic, Karan quoted, &quot;What appealed to me was the fact that the love story stretched out across generations. It began with youth and went on as the people grew older. You could say that &quot;Kabhi Kabhie&quot; is the starting point for my new film, that I am inspired by it. But the film, I am sure, will be very different. It will look different, feel different.&quot; Similarly, Karan added an extra &quot;e&quot; to the second &quot;Kabhi&quot; in the title of his film, due to numerological reasons. In an interview with &quot;The Times of India&quot;, Karan dispelled comparisons with &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; and said that while his debut film was &quot;frothy and bubble-gummish&quot;, this one was &quot;more classy and sophisticated&quot;. He added that there would be &quot;plenty of drama&quot; in this film too, but handled more maturely.

Before principal photography could begin, Karan and the contracted costume designers (Manish Malhotra, Shabina Khan and Rocky S) shopped in several locations of the US, London, Milan, and New Delhi to get the right look for each of the cast members. Additionally, Karan had only one expectation from the contracted actors; to &quot;look good and do their job&quot;. He did not organise any rehearsals for them, except for a scene involving a climatic encounter between Amitabh Bachchan and Roshan. Additional production people hired included choreographer Farah Khan, production designer Sharmishta Roy and cinematographer Kiran Deohans.

===Filming===

The first schedule of the film began in Mumbai on 16 October 2000, with the picturisation of the song &quot;Bole Chudiyan&quot; involving Roshan, Kapoor, Khan and Kajol. Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan joined the schedule on 20 October. Due to the immense stress caused by the presence of these actors, Karan fainted on the sets. However, he continued directing the rest of the song while lying in bed. For the first half of &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot;, the production design team led by Sharmishtha Roy, recreated Chandni Chowk in a studio at Film City of Mumbai. In order to lend authenticity, the team took several pictures of the original area and also shopped in the various alleys of Chandni Chowk. Roy later won the Filmfare Award for Best Art Direction for her work in the film. The inside of a palatial mansion was developed from scratch in the same studio to double as the home of the Raichand family. In order to lend authenticity to the house of the multi-multimillionaires, several expensive paintings were hung from the walls. A total of 18–19 elaborate sets were constructed by Roy, as Karan wanted the look of the film to be &quot;larger-than-life&quot;.

The second half of the film was shot in the city of London. Karan chose to set the film there due to his fondness for the city. He added, &quot;I could have based my plot in New York City or anywhere else. But London is kind of close to my heart. I like to weave my films around London.&quot; Shooting locations include the Millennium Stadium, Bluewater in Kent, Blenheim Palace, St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and the banks of River Thames. The outdoor scenes of the Raichand family mansion were shot at Waddesdon Manor. The crew faced enormous difficulties while filming an emotional scene between Jaya Bachchan and Khan at the Bluewater Complex, as a massive crowd had gathered there to watch them at work. The situation, eventually, got worse and the complex officials asked them to wrap up the shoot within two hours. Another song sequence (&quot;Suraj Hua Maddham&quot;) involving Khan and Kajol was shot with the backdrop of the Pyramids of Giza in the city of Cairo in Egypt. Due to the lighting conditions, the crew could shoot only between 7 and 9 am. As a result, the song took several days to film. In addition, Kajol suffered from a minor injury while filming for the song, as she had experienced a bad fall.

British journalist, Fuad Omar, wrote extensively about the filming of the film in the United Kingdom, covering much of the shoot in a series of online articles and for regional press. Many of these were reprinted in an unedited format in his book, &quot;Bollywood: An Insider&#x27;s Guide&quot;.

==Themes==
Film critics and academics have analysed &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; in several ways. In the book, &quot;Encyclopedia of Religion and Film&quot;, Eric Mazur described several &quot;mythological subtexts&quot; in the film. While mentioning the opening scene of the film, which features the Raichand family worshipping &quot;Hindu deities during the annual Diwali holiday&quot;, he explained that the scene allowed the Hindu audiences to participate in the &quot;darshan&quot; along with the characters.

Author Rajani Mazumdar compared &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; to &quot;Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!&quot; (1994) and added that the film dealt with themes of family and moral values through a &quot;spectacular stage that moves across global locations&quot;. She further stated that the buildup to the story was juxtaposed with the backdrop of two contrasting places – the Raichand home and the interiors of Chandni Chowk. While the Raichand house is described as &quot;expensive, almost like a museum&quot;, Chandni Chowk is shown as a world of crowds, chaos and festivities. She also made a note of the use of frontal camera angles in order to ensure that the &quot;spectators eye travels throughout the interior expanse&quot;.

Writer Sangita Gopal analysed the &quot;intensification of the aesthetic effects of Hindi cinema&quot; in the narrative scheme of the film. During the confrontation scene between Yash and Rahul Raichand, a &quot;thundering background score&quot; coupled with &quot;360° panning shots&quot; were used to build up melodrama. She added that while such scenes simply began by reprising previous face-offs in several melodramatic Hindi films (such as &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; (2000)), they gradually shifted &quot;to a more realist register as the framework moves from a sociology to a psychology of the family&quot;. Mazur mentioned the use of &quot;dream sequences&quot; in the film as a means of escapism. He referred to the song &quot;Suraj Hua Maddham&quot; as an extradiegetic sequence that allowed Rahul and Anjali to be physically intimate &quot;in ways that they could not in the real world of the film.&quot; He added that the characters conveyed a plethora of emotions not through extensive dialogue but through the exchange of glances, which were demonstrated by extreme close-ups on their eyes.

Writing for the book &quot;Movie Blockbusters&quot;, Andrew Willis commented that the film was specifically written to appeal to the Indian diaspora. He explained that the film was aimed at invoking nostalgia among the large section of NRI&#x27;s in Canada, United Kingdom and North America. In the second half of the film, Rahul and Anjali move to London, where they enjoy an affluent lifestyle, among several non-Indian neighbours and friends. However, there is a perpetual dissatisfaction among them, especially Anjali, in living away from home. Additionally, she dresses up in a traditional sari and performs the duties of a loyal housemaker. She also frets about her son and younger sister being &quot;too influenced&quot; by Western culture. The film, thus tries to form an emotional connection with the expatriate Indian audiences.

According to Eckstein, several sequences convey a &quot;culturally conservative&quot; and &quot;idealistic image&quot; of India, while maintaining that the diaspora living in Britain lead a life of &quot;involuntary exile&quot;. Western ideology is equated with economic success, with emphasis on Western consumerism such as Starbucks and Burger King. Creekmur believes that Rohan was the only character in the film who could navigate multiple cultural spaces with ease. He seems totally at ease both at his ancestral home in India and in London. Though the tag-line for the film was &quot;It&#x27;s all about loving your parents&quot;, Creekmur was skeptical and suggested &quot;the film seems to actually admonish stern fathers to trust and love their children – mothers, aunties, and grandmothers, of course, love their children unconditionally even while respecting the idiotic wishes of vain patriarchs.&quot;

==Soundtrack==

The music of the film was composed by Jatin–Lalit, Sandesh Shandilya and Aadesh Shrivastava. The lyrics were provided by Sameer, except for &quot;Suraj Hua Maddham&quot; which was penned by Anil Pandey. A total of 11 tracks are present in the album, which was released by Sony Music on 26 October 2001. The film&#x27;s score has been composed by Babloo Chakravarty.

==Release==
Initially scheduled for a theatrical release during the Diwali celebrations of 2001, &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; released a month later on 14 December 2001. Due to the long duration of the film, theatres screened three shows daily, instead of four. Additionally, due to a massive rush in advance bookings, several theatres increased their ticket prices.

The use of &quot;Jana Gana Mana&quot; by Rabindranath Tagore during the film was met with criticism from a certain section of the audiences, and politicians of the Bharatiya Janata Party, for being &quot;out-of-context&quot; and &quot;insulting the national pride&quot;. Subsequently, a writ was issued against Dharma Productions in the Allahabad High Court by a petitioner based in Uttar Pradesh. However, the court did not entertain the complainant&#x27;s petition.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
====India====

In India, &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; met with mixed reviews from critics. It received praise for its visual richness and the performances of the cast, but criticism towards the lengthy run time, the script strength and inconsistencies. Khalid Mohamed of &quot;The Times of India&quot; applauded the film in a five-star review: &quot;&quot;K3G&quot; is the complete commercial banquet delivered with fabulous finesse by Karan Johar. So, go indulge yourself. Cry your heart out and surprisingly, you&#x27;ll feel life&#x27;s finally alive and kicking in Mumbai&#x27;s dream world.&quot; Taran Adarsh of &quot;Bollywood Hungama&quot; gave the film 4.5 out of 5 stars. He praised the emotional sequences, as well as the choreography, production design, costumes, and cinematography. He added that Karan Johar was the real star, for creating many memorable sequences. Rakesh Budhu of &quot;Planet Bollywood&quot; gave the film 8 out of 10 stars, saying &quot;Dharma Productions has kept its promise in giving us a lovable film to remember in coming times.&quot; He pointed out several flaws in the script, but added that the positive aspects of the film managed to outweigh the negative ones. He quoted, &quot;&quot;K3G&quot; is one heck of an entertainer and was worth the wait&quot;. In the film review section of his book &quot;Bollywood: An Insider&#x27;s Guide&quot;, Fuad Omar showered overwhelming praise on the film and called it a &quot;masterpiece from the first frame to the last&quot;. In summary he said, &quot;Overall &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; is without a doubt the most enthralling, entertaining, emotional and complete vision and definition of Hindi cinema I have ever seen. It is simply the perfect Hindi film.&quot;

Contrary to the positive reviews, Anjum N., writing for &quot;Rediff&quot;, said that despite an extraordinary cast and a big budget, &quot;Karan Johar disappoints.&quot; He praised Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan&#x27;s performance and noted Roshan for holding his own against the veteran actors. However, in summary he called the film &quot;a bad remix of &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; and &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot;&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Hindu&quot;, Ziya Us Salam praised Kajol&#x27;s performance and Karan&#x27;s ability to &quot;keep the viewer occupied&quot;. She commented, &quot;Watch &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; not because of the hype which preceded its release but because in these meagre times not many have come up with better fare. The film at least partially redeems the hope surrounding it. Again, just like its name. Some joy, some disappointment.&quot; Namrata Joshi of &quot;Outlook&quot; gave a mixed review and said that while the film &quot;makes you laugh and cry alternately&quot;, the shenanigans were nevertheless &quot;fake and affected&quot; and &quot;monochromatic despite the profusion of colours&quot;.

====Overseas====
 Shamaila Khan of BBC gave the film 9 out of 10 stars and praised the performances of Khan, Kajol and Kapoor. She summed up by saying, &quot;(&quot;K3G&quot; is) a well made film, with some magical moments (hilarious and weepy) and possibly the world&#x27;s best looking family!&quot;
Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; said that it &quot;is a highly enjoyable, often dazzlingly staged vehicle dragged down by a sluggish final half-hour&quot;. He also praised the cinematography, and the picturisation of the song, &quot;Say Shava Shava&quot;.

===Box office===

<doc id="581195" wikidata="Q905768" url="?curid=581195" title="Copyright status of works by the federal government of the United States">
<text>A work of the United States government is defined by the United States copyright law, as &quot;a work prepared by an officer or employee of the United States Government as part of that person&#x27;s official duties&quot;. Under section 105 of the Copyright Act of 1976, such works are not entitled to domestic copyright protection under U.S. law and are therefore in the public domain.

This act only applies to U.S. domestic copyright as that is the extent of U.S. &quot;federal&quot; law. The U.S. government asserts that it can still hold the copyright to those works in other countries.

Publication of an otherwise protected work by the U.S. government does not put that work in the public domain. For example, government publications may include works copyrighted by a contractor or grantee; copyrighted material assigned to the U.S. Government; or copyrighted information from other sources.
Further, the copyright status of works by subnational governments of the United States is governed by its own set of laws.

== History ==
The first Federal statute concerning copyright in government 
publications was the Printing Law enacted in 1895. Section 52 of that Act provided that copies of &quot;Government Publications&quot; could not be copyrighted.

Prior to 1895, no court decision had occasion to 
consider any claim of copyright on behalf of the Government itself.
Courts had, however, considered whether copyright could be asserted as to the text of laws, court decisions, governmental 
rules, etc., and concluded that such material were not subject to copyright as a matter of 
public policy. But other material prepared for State Governments 
by their employees, notably the headnotes, syllabi, annotations, 
etc. prepared by court reporters, had been held copyrightable on behalf of the States.

The Copyright Act of 1909 was the first copyright statute to address government publications. Section 7 of the Act (later codified as Section 8 of title 17 U.S.C.) provided that &quot;No copyright shall subsist... in any publication of the United States Government, or any reprint, in whole or in part, thereof&quot;.

===Copyright in government works prior to 1895===
Prior to the Printing Act of 1895, no statute governed copyright of U.S. government works. Court decisions had established that an employee of the Federal Government had no right to claim copyright in a work prepared by him for the Government. Other decisions had held that individuals could not have copyright in books consisting of the text of Federal or State court decisions, statutes, rules of judicial procedures, etc., i.e., governmental edicts and rulings. Copyright was denied on the grounds of public policy: such material as the laws and governmental rules and decisions must be freely available to the public and made known as widely as possible; hence there must be no restriction on the reproduction and dissemination of such documents.

While copyright was denied in the text of court decisions, material added by a court reporter on his own – such as leadnotes, syllabi, annotations, indexes, etc. – was deemed copyrightable by him, although he was employed by the government to take down and compile the court decisions. These cases may be said to have established the principle that material prepared by a government employee outside of the scope of the public policy rule was copyrightable; and that the employee who prepared such material on his own could secure copyright therein.

There appears to be no court decision before 1895 dealing directly with the question of whether the United States Government might obtain or hold copyright in material not within the public policy rule. But the question did arise with respect to State Governments. In the nineteenth century much of the public printing for the States was done under contract by private publishers. The publisher would not bear the expense of printing and publishing, however, unless he could be given exclusive rights. To enable the State to give exclusive rights to a publisher, a number of States enacted statutes providing that court reporters or other State officials who prepared copyrightable material in their official capacity should secure copyright in trust for or on behalf of the State. Such copyrights for the benefit of the State were sustained by the courts.

Two cases before 1895 may also be noted with regard to the question of the rights of individual authors (or their successors) in material prepared for, or acquired by, the United States Government. In &quot;Heine v. Appleton&quot;, an artist was held to have no right to secure copyright in drawings prepared by him as a member of Commodore Perry&#x27;s expedition, since the drawings belonged to the Government. In &quot;Folsom v. Marsh&quot;, where a collection of letters and other private writings of George Washington had been published and copyrighted by his successors, the purchase of the manuscripts by the United States Government was held not to affect the copyright. The contention of the defendant that the Government&#x27;s ownership of the manuscripts made them available for publication by anyone was denied.

===The Printing Law of 1895===

The Printing Law of 1895, which was designed to centralize in the Government Printing Office, the printing, binding, and distribution of Government documents, contained the first statutory prohibition of copyright in Government publications. Section 52 of that Law provides for the sale by the Public Printer of &quot;duplicate stereotype or electrotype plates from which any Government publication is printed&quot;, with the proviso &quot;that no publication reprinted from such stereotype or electrotype plates and no other Government publication shall be copyrighted&quot;.

The provision in the Printing Act concerning copyright of government works was probably the result of the &quot;Richardson Affair&quot;, which involved an effort in the late 1890s by Representative James D. Richardson (1843–1914) to privately copyright a government-published set of Presidential proclamations.

===The Copyright Act of 1909===
Section 7 of the Copyright Act of 1909 (later codified as Section 8 of title 17 U.S.C.) 
provided that &quot;No copyright shall subsist ... in any publication of the United States Government, or any reprint, in whole or in part, thereof ...&quot; Section 7 also contained a &quot;savings clause&quot;, which stated that &quot;The publication or republication by the Government, either separately or in a public document, of any material in which copyright is subsisting shall not be taken to cause any abridgment or annulment of the copyright or to authorize any use or appropriation of such copyright material without the consent of the copyright proprietor.&quot;
The committee report on the bill that became the Act of 1909 explains that the savings clause was inserted &quot;for the reason that the Government often desires to make use in its publications of copyrighted material, with the consent of the owner of the copyright, and it has been regarded heretofore as necessary to pass a special act every time this was done, providing that such use by the Government should not be taken 
to give to anyone the right to use the copyrighted material found in the Government publication&quot;.

===The Copyright Act of 1976===
The Sections of the Copyright Act that now govern U.S. Government work were enacted in 1976 as part of the Copyright Act of 1976. The House Report to the enacted legislation stated that &quot;the basic premise of section 105 of the bill is the same&quot; as section 8 of the former title 17.

====Derivative works consisting predominantly of government works====
Section 403 of the 1976 Act introduced a new provision concerning documents consisting preponderantly of one or more government works. In essence, such works would be denied copyright protection unless the required copyright notice included a statement specifically identifying those parts of the work that were &quot;not&quot; U.S. Government work, and therefore subject to copyright protection. According to the House Report, this provision was

aimed at a publishing practice that, while technically justified under the present law, has been the object of considerable criticism. In cases where a Government work is published or republished commercially, it has frequently been the practice to add some &quot;new matter&quot; in the form of an introduction, editing, illustrations, etc., and to include a general copyright notice in the name of the commercial publisher. This in no way suggests to the public that the bulk of the work is uncopyrightable and therefore free for use.
&quot;To make the notice meaningful rather than misleading&quot;, section 403 of the 1976 Act required that, when the copies consist preponderantly of one or more works of the United States Government&#x27;, the copyright notice (if any) identify those parts of the work in which copyright is claimed. A failure to meet this requirement would be treated as an omission of the notice&quot;, resulting, absent the application of some exception, in the loss of copyright protection.

===Derivative works after the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988===
The Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 amended the law to make the use of a copyright notice optional on copies of works published on and after March 1, 1989 and also revised Section 403. After the adoption of this act, a copyright notice was no longer necessary to secure copyright protection. Including the notice, however, does continue to confer certain benefits, notably in the challenging a defendant&#x27;s claim of innocent infringement, where the question of proper notice may be a factor in assessing damages in infringement actions. Under the revised Section 403, these benefits are denied to a work consisting predominantly U.S. Government works &quot;unless the notice of copyright appearing on the published copies or phonorecords to which a defendant in the copyright infringement suit had access includes a statement identifying, either affirmatively or negatively, those portions of the copies or phonorecords embodying any work or works protected under this title&quot;.

==Limitations==

=== Works produced by contractors ===

Unlike works of the U.S. government, works produced by contractors under government contracts are protected under U.S. copyright law. The holdership of the copyright depends on the terms of the contract and the type of work undertaken. Contract terms and conditions vary between agencies; contracts to NASA and the military may differ significantly from civilian agency contracts.

Civilian agencies and NASA are guided by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). There are a number of FAR provisions that can affect the ownership of the copyright. &quot;FAR Subpart 27.4—Rights in Data and Copyright&quot; provides copyright guidance for the civilian agencies and NASA. Additionally, some agencies may have their own FAR Supplements that they follow.

Under the FAR general data rights clause (FAR 52.227-14), the government has unlimited rights in all data first produced in performance of or delivered under a contract, unless the contractor asserts a claim to copyright or the contract provides otherwise. Unless provided otherwise by an Agency FAR Supplement, a contractor may assert claim to copyright in scientific and technical articles based on or containing data first produced in the performance of a contract and published in academic, technical or professional journals, symposia proceedings, or the like. The express written permission of the Contracting Officer is required before the contractor may assert or enforce the copyright in all other works first produced in the performance of a contract. However, if a contract includes Alternate IV of the clause, the Contracting Officer&#x27;s approval is not required to assert claim to copyright. Whenever the contractor asserts claim to copyright in works other than computer software, the government, and others acting on its behalf, are granted a license to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute, perform and display the copyrighted work. For computer software produced under FAR contract, the scope of the government&#x27;s license does not include the right to distribute to the public, but for &quot;commercial off the shelf software&quot;, the government typically obtains no better license than would any other customer.

===Transfers===
The federal government can hold copyrights that are transferred to it. Copyright law&#x27;s definition of work of the United States government does not include work that the government owns but did not create. For example, in 1837, the federal government purchased former U.S. President James Madison&#x27;s manuscripts from his widow, Dolley Madison, for $30,000. If this is construed as covering copyright as well as the physical papers, it would be an example of such a transfer.

===Exemptions===
Works by certain independent agencies, corporations and federal subsidiaries may not be considered &quot;government works&quot; and may, therefore, be copyrightable. For instance, material produced by the United States Postal Service are typically subject to normal copyright. Most USPS materials, artwork, and design and all postage stamps as of January 1, 1978, or after are subject to copyright laws. Works of the former United States Post Office Department are in the public domain (due to its former position as a cabinet department).

 authorizes U.S. Secretary of Commerce to secure copyright for works produced by the Department of Commerce under the Standard Reference Data Act. National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), FY2020, granted civilian members of the faculty at twelve federal government institutions the authority to retain and own copyright of works produced in the course of employment for publication by a scholarly press or journal.

===State, territorial, and local governments===

The lack of copyright protection for works of the United States government does not apply to works of U.S. subnational governments. Thus, works created by a state or local government may be subject to copyright. Some states have placed much of their work into the public domain by waiving some or all of their rights under copyright law. For example, the constitution and laws of Florida have placed its government&#x27;s works in the public domain. Unorganized territories (such as American Samoa and the former Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands) are treated, for copyright purposes, as the U.S. government. Their works therefore fall under § 105 and lack copyright protection.

===Other restrictions===
Certain works, particularly logos and emblems of government agencies, while not copyrightable, are still protected by other laws that are similar in effect to trademark laws. Such laws are intended to protect indicators of source or quality. For example, some uses of the Central Intelligence Agency logo, name, and initialism are regulated under the CIA Act of 1949 ().

==Edicts of government==

The United States Copyright Office considers &quot;edicts of government&quot;, such as judicial opinions, administrative rulings, legislative enactments, public ordinances, and similar official legal documents, not copyrightable for reasons of public policy. This applies to such works whether they are federal, state, or local as well as to those of foreign governments.

<doc id="581202" wikidata="Q3092274" url="?curid=581202" title="Holy Sponge">
<text>The Holy Sponge is one of the Instruments of the Passion of Jesus. It was dipped in vinegar (; in some translations sour wine), most likely posca, a regular beverage of Roman soldiers, and offered to Jesus to drink from during the Crucifixion, according to Matthew 27:48, Mark 15:36, and John 19:29.

==History==
===Jerusalem===
An object thought to be the Holy Sponge was venerated in the Holy Land, in the Upper Room of the Constantinian basilica, where Sophronius of Jerusalem spoke of it :

===Rome===
In the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano in Rome, a brown sponge is venerated. Other pieces of sponge are present at the following:
* the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore
* the Basilica di Santa Maria in Trastevere
* St. Mary in Campitelli

The Chapel of the Relics at Santa Croce in Gerusalemme houses another sponge:

===Constantinople and France===
In the 7th century, Nicetas took part in the conquest of Egypt from Phocas. He was famed for bringing items he claimed were the Holy Sponge and the Holy Lance (the &quot;Lance of Longinus&quot;) to Constantinople from Palestine in 612. From 619 to 628/9 he may anecdotally have been exarch of Africa.

This sponge remained in Constantinople until it was bought from the Latin emperor Baldwin II by Louis IX of France among the relics he needed for the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. Participants in the French Revolution dispersed these relics (including the Crown of Thorns and a bit of the True Cross). Some went briefly to the Bibliothèque Nationale. Later, however, they were restored to Notre-Dame de Paris.

===Other claimants===
Other parties also claiming access to the Holy Sponge include:
* the church of St. Jacques de Compiègne in France
* Aachen&#x27;s cathedral (Charlemagne&#x27;s sample)

<text>Acer micranthum, the small-leaved maple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sapindaceae in the snakebark maple group, native to Japan, on Honshū, Kyūshū and Shikoku. Its Japanese name is the Komine maple.

It is a small, sometimes shrubby tree growing tall, with slender, arching branches. The bark is smooth and striped at first, becoming rough and dull grey on mature trees. The shoots and winter buds are dark purple-red. The leaves are 4–10 cm long and 2–8 cm broad, palmately lobed, with five deeply toothed lobes with long acuminate tips and double-serrated margins, and with distinctive tufts of orange-red hairs in the main vein axils at the base of the leaf; the petiole is 2–5 cm long. The leaves emerge red in spring and turn shades of yellow, orange and red in autumn. The flowers are produced in early summer in racemes 4–10 cm long, each flower 4 mm diameter, with five yellow to greenish-yellow sepals and petals; it is dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate trees. The fruit is a paired samara with two rounded nutlets, each with a wing 1.5–2 cm long; the two wings spreading almost horizontally from each other.

It is most closely related to &quot;Acer tschonoskii&quot;, which replaces it further north and at higher altitudes in Japan; they have very similar leaf form.

&quot;Acer micranthum&quot; is cultivated as an ornamental tree in European and North American gardens, and has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. Though hardy down to , it requires a sheltered position in neutral or acid soil with sun or partial shade.

<text>Phaswane Mpe (10 September 1970 – 12 December 2004) was a South African poet and novelist. He was educated at the University of the Witwatersrand, where he was a lecturer in African literature. He did his master&#x27;s degree in publishing at Oxford Brookes University in 1998. His debut novel, &quot;Welcome to Our Hillbrow&quot;, was published in 2001. A collection of short stories and poems, &quot;Brooding Clouds&quot;, was published posthumously in 2008.

Mpe was born in the northern city of Polokwane in Tiragalong, and moved to Johannesburg at the age of 19 to attend university, and ended up living in the deprived inner city area of Hillbrow, a place where he later set his first novel. &quot;Welcome to Our Hillbrow&quot; was an important work as it was the first novel to deal with the changes of inner-city life in South Africa in the ten years since Nelson Mandela and F. W. de Klerk engineered apartheid&#x27;s demise. The book depicts the native black South Africans facing the challenges of poverty, unemployment, and HIV/AIDS. The novel is striking in that the problems created by apartheid are in the background; the central problems of black South Africans are those of their own making: xenophobia, mean-spirited gossip, witchcraft, and the inability to fully love each other or themselves.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, considering the prevalence of the disease in South Africa, HIV and AIDS were common themes in Mpe&#x27;s work. Before his death he embarked on doctorate studies on sexuality in post-apartheid South African literature with a particular focus on these two issues.

Mpe died suddenly at the age of 34, at a time when he was about to begin training as a traditional healer. The cause of death was unknown.

At the time of his death Mpe was teaching African literature and publishing studies in the school of literature and languages studies in the University of the Witwatersrand. His poems and short stories have been published in &quot;Imprint&quot; (1995), &quot;Staff Rider&quot; (1980). He also contributed short stories in &quot;Drum Magazine&quot;.

His book &quot;Welcome to Our Hillbrow&quot;, and short stories in &quot;Brooding Clouds&quot; have autobiographical information.

<text>Penikese Island is a island off the coast of Massachusetts, United States, in Buzzards Bay. It is one of the Elizabeth Islands, which make up the town of Gosnold, Massachusetts. Penikese is located near the west end of the Elizabeth island chain.

==History==

Penikese Island entered the historical record in 1602 AD when the English explorer Bartholomew Gosnold and some of his crew visited the island. Their visit frightened four visiting Wampanoag Indians into hiding, and the explorers stole their canoe.

Originally tree covered, at some later time the tree cover was lost, and the island was later used for pasturing sheep. To this day, it remains primarily grass covered. Ownership changed hands several times before the island was purchased by John Anderson, a businessman, who used it for vacationing.

In early 1873, Louis Agassiz, the famous Swiss-American naturalist, persuaded Anderson to give him the island and $50,000 to endow a school for natural history where students would study nature instead of books. The school opened in July 1873, initially headed by Louis Agassiz. Following his death in December, his son Alexander Agassiz ran the school. The school was closed following a fire in 1875, but some of the former students opened in 1888 the Marine Biological Laboratory, in nearby Woods Hole.

In 1904, following local opposition to two previously selected sites on the mainland, the state of Massachusetts purchased the island for $25,000 to use as a leprosy hospital to isolate and treat all Massachusetts residents with the disease. When opened, the Penikese Island Leper Hospital had five patients. After being open for 16 years, it was closed in 1921 and the thirteen patients were transferred to the federal leprosy hospital in Carville, Louisiana. At the closing of the hospital, the state burnt and then dynamited the buildings, and all that remains of it are stone gate posts and a small cemetery.

The island remains under the ownership of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is primarily a bird sanctuary. There is no permanent population on the island. A residential school for troubled boys operated on the island from 1973 until 2011. and now offered environmental education experiences. There may also be visitors and researchers on island from time to time, as the island is publicly owned and is still used at times for biological research. Beginning in 1990, the island was used as a test site for efforts to reintroduce the endangered American burying beetle, which appears to have succeeded; by 1997 the population had persisted for at least five generations since the last release.

== Penikese Island School ==

The Penikese Island School (PIS) was founded in 1973 as a non-profit 501(c)(3). PIS was a private rehabilitation school for teenage delinquent boys. The goal of the school was to teach by example, modeling responsible adult behavior in a spartan environment. Boys were exposed to life with earnest adults who enforced a code of behavior, as an alternative to incarceration. PIS aimed to provide an experience they hoped would help boys remanded to involuntary custody become productive citizens, instead of developing into adult criminals. The first student was from New Bedford and he had harpooned a policeman.

Having a school on the island is a benefit to the state and its efforts to protect endangered nesting birds, as the presence of staff on the island helps deter illegal hunters and campers.

During the mid 1990’s, the original founders of PIS were no longer in charge. New leadership continued the program to 2011, when funding from the state of Massachusetts was no longer available. In the fall of 2015, a long-term opioid-addiction treatment facility named Penikese began operation on the island. According to several newspapers, the treatment center shut down in 2017 after a lack of funding.

In 2019, PIS began offering programs with a new mission focused on environmental education. The new mission is to provide students with access to experiential, nature-based educational programs. PIS currently operates school trips during the academic year and a STEAM camp during the summer.

==In Popular culture==
* Lauren Wolk&#x27;s 2017 young adult novel &quot;Beyond the Bright Sea&quot; is set in the aftermath of the closure of the Penikese Island Leper Hospital, and the main characters frequently visit and explore the island.

<doc id="581217" wikidata="Q309989" url="?curid=581217" title="Tyrone Power">
<text>Tyrone Edmund Power III (May 5, 1914 – November 15, 1958) was an American actor. From the 1930s to the 1950s, Power appeared in dozens of films, often in swashbuckler roles or romantic leads. His better-known films include &quot;Jesse James&quot;, &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot;, &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot;, &quot;Blood and Sand&quot;, &quot;The Black Swan&quot;, &quot;Prince of Foxes&quot;, &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot;, &quot;The Black Rose&quot;, and &quot;Captain from Castile&quot;. Power&#x27;s own favorite film among those in which he starred was &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot;. 

Though largely a matinee idol in the 1930s and early 1940s and known for his striking good looks, Power starred in films in a number of genres, from drama to light comedy. In the 1950s he began placing limits on the number of films he would make in order to devote more time to theater productions. He received his biggest accolades as a stage actor in &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; and &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;. Power died from a heart attack at the age 

==Early life==
Power was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1914, the son of Helen Emma &quot;Patia&quot; (née Reaume) and the English-born American stage and screen actor Tyrone Power Sr., often known by his first name &quot;Fred&quot;. Power was descended from a long Irish theatrical line going back to his great-grandfather, the Irish actor and comedian Tyrone Power (1797–1841). Tyrone Power&#x27;s sister, Ann Power, was born in 1915, after the family moved to California. His mother was Roman Catholic, and her ancestry included the French-Canadian Reaume family and French from Alsace-Lorraine. Through his paternal great-grandmother, Anne Gilbert, Power was related to the actor Laurence Olivier; through his paternal grandmother, stage actress Ethel Lavenu, he was related by marriage to author Evelyn Waugh; and through his father&#x27;s first cousin, Norah Emily Gorman Power, he was related to the theatrical director Sir (William) Tyrone Guthrie, the first director of the Stratford Festival in Canada and the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Power went to Cincinnati-area Catholic schools and graduated from Purcell High School in 1931. Upon his graduation, he opted to join his father to learn what he could about acting from one of the stage&#x27;s most respected actors.

==Early career==

===1930s===
Power joined his father for the summer of 1931, after being separated from him for some years due to his parents&#x27; divorce. His father suffered a heart attack in December 1931, dying in his son&#x27;s arms, while preparing to perform in &quot;The Miracle Man&quot;. Tyrone Power Jr., as he was then known, decided to continue pursuing an acting career. He tried to find work as an actor, and, while many contacts knew his father well, they offered praise for his father but no work for his son. He appeared in a bit part in 1932 in &quot;Tom Brown of Culver&quot;, a movie starring actor Tom Brown. Power&#x27;s experience in that movie did not open any other doors, however, and, except for what amounted to little more than a job as an extra in &quot;Flirtation Walk&quot;, he found himself frozen out of the movies but making some appearances in community theater. Discouraged, he took the advice of a friend, Arthur Caesar, to go to New York to gain experience as a stage actor. Among the Broadway plays in which he was cast are &quot;Flowers of the Forest&quot;, &quot;Saint Joan&quot;, and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. 

Power went to Hollywood in 1936. The director Henry King was impressed with his looks and poise, and he insisted that Power be tested for the lead role in &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s of London&quot;, a role thought already to belong to Don Ameche. Despite his own reservations, Darryl F. Zanuck decided to give Power the role, once King and Fox film editor Barbara McLean convinced him that Power had a greater screen presence than Ameche. Power was billed fourth in the movie but he had by far the most screen time of any member of the cast. He walked into the premiere of the movie an unknown and he walked out a star, which he remained the rest of his career. 

Power racked up hit after hit from 1936 until 1943, when his career was interrupted by military service. In these years he starred in romantic comedies such as &quot;Thin Ice&quot; and &quot;Day-Time Wife&quot;, in dramas such as &quot;Suez&quot;, &quot;Blood and Sand&quot;, &quot;Son of Fury: The Story of Benjamin Blake&quot;, &quot;The Rains Came&quot; and &quot;In Old Chicago&quot;; in musicals &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;, &quot;Second Fiddle&quot;, and &quot;Rose of Washington Square&quot;; in the westerns &quot;Jesse James&quot; (1939) and &quot;Brigham Young&quot;; in the war films &quot;A Yank in the R.A.F.&quot; and &quot;This Above All&quot;; and the swashbucklers &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; and &quot;The Black Swan&quot;. &quot;Jesse James&quot; was a very big hit at the box office, but it did receive some criticism for fictionalizing and glamorizing the famous outlaw. The movie was shot in and around Pineville, Missouri, and was Power&#x27;s first location shoot and his first Technicolor movie. (Before his career was over, he had filmed a total of 16 movies in color, including the movie he was filming when he died.) He was loaned out once, to MGM for &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (1938). Darryl F. Zanuck was angry that MGM used Fox&#x27;s biggest star in what was, despite billing, a supporting role, and he vowed to never again loan him out, though Power&#x27;s services were requested for the roles of Ashley Wilkes in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, Joe Bonaparte in &quot;Golden Boy&quot;, and Parris in &quot;Kings Row&quot;; roles in several films produced by Harry Cohn; and the role of Monroe Stahr in a planned production by Norma Shearer of &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot;.

Power was named the second biggest box-office draw in 1939, surpassed only by Mickey Rooney. His box office numbers are some of the best of all time.

===1940–1943===

In 1940, the direction of Power&#x27;s career took a dramatic turn when his movie &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; was released. Power played the role of Don Diego Vega/Zorro, a fop by day, a bandit hero by night. The role had been performed by Douglas Fairbanks in the 1920 movie of the same title. The film was a hit, and 20th Century-Fox often cast Power in other swashbucklers in the years that followed. Power was a talented swordsman in real life, and the dueling scene in &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; is highly regarded. The great Hollywood swordsman, Basil Rathbone, who starred with him in &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot;, commented, &quot;Power was the most agile man with a sword I&#x27;ve ever faced before a camera. Tyrone could have fenced Errol Flynn into a cocked hat.&quot;

Power&#x27;s career was interrupted in 1943 by military service. He reported to the United States Marine Corps for training in late 1942, but was sent back, at the request of 20th Century-Fox, to complete one more film, &quot;Crash Dive&quot;, a patriotic war movie released in 1943. He was credited in the movie as Tyrone Power, U.S.M.C.R., and the movie served as a recruiting film.

==Military service==
In August 1942, Power enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. He attended boot camp at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, then Officer&#x27;s Candidate School at Marine Corps Base Quantico, where he was commissioned a second lieutenant on June 2, 1943. He had already logged 180 solo hours as a pilot before enlisting, so he was able to do a short, intense flight training program at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas. The pass earned him his wings and a promotion to first lieutenant. The Marine Corps considered Power over the age limit for active combat flying, so he volunteered for piloting cargo planes that he felt would get him into active combat zones.

In July 1944, Power was assigned to Marine Transport Squadron (VMR)-352 as a R5C (Navy version of Army Curtiss Commando C-46) transport co-pilot at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina. The squadron moved to Marine Corps Air Station El Centro in California in December 1944. Power was later reassigned to VMR-353, joining them on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands in February 1945. From there, he flew missions carrying cargo in and wounded Marines out during the Battles of Iwo Jima (February to March 1945) and Okinawa (April to June 1945). For his services in the Pacific War, Power was awarded the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with two bronze stars, and the World War II Victory Medal. Power returned to the United States in November 1945 and was released from active duty in January 1946. He was promoted to the rank of captain in the reserves on May 8, 1951. He remained in the reserves the rest of his life and reached the rank of major in 1957.

In the June 2001 &quot;Marine Air Transporter&quot; newsletter, Jerry Taylor, a retired Marine Corps flight instructor, recalled training Power as a Marine pilot, saying, &quot;He was an excellent student, never forgot a procedure I showed him or anything I told him.&quot; Others who served with him have also commented on how well Power was respected by those with whom he served. Following the war, 20th Century-Fox provided Power with a surplus DC-3 that he named &quot;The Geek&quot; that he frequently piloted. When Power died suddenly at age 44, he was buried with full military honors.

==Post-war career==
===Late 1940s===

Other than re-releases of his films, Power was not seen on screen again after his entry into the Marines until 1946, when he co-starred with Gene Tierney, John Payne and Anne Baxter in &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;, an adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s 1944 novel of the same title.

Next up for release was a movie that Power had to fight hard to make, the film noir &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot; (1947). Darryl F. Zanuck was reluctant for Power to make the movie because his handsome appearance and charming manner had been marketable assets for the studio for many years. Zanuck feared that the dark role might damage Power&#x27;s image. Zanuck eventually agreed, giving Power A-list production values for what normally would be a B film. The movie was directed by Edmund Goulding, and though it was a failure at the box-office, it was one of Power&#x27;s favorite roles for which he received some of the best reviews of his career. However, Zanuck continued to disapprove of his &quot;darling boy&quot; being seen in such a film with a downward spiral. So, he did not publicize it and removed it from release after only a few weeks insisting that it was a flop. The film was released on DVD in 2005 after years of legal issues. 

Zanuck quickly released another costume-clad movie, &quot;Captain from Castile&quot; (also 1947), directed by Henry King, who directed Power in eleven movies. After making a couple of light romantic comedies reuniting him with two actresses under contract to 20th Century-Fox, &quot;That Wonderful Urge&quot; with Gene Tierney and &quot;The Luck of the Irish&quot; (both 1948) with Anne Baxter. After these films, Power once again found himself in two swashbucklers, &quot;Prince of Foxes&quot; (1949) and &quot;The Black Rose&quot; (1950).

===1950s===
Power was becoming increasingly dissatisfied with his costume roles, and he struggled between being a star and becoming a great actor. He was forced to take on assignments he found unappealing, such movies as &quot;American Guerrilla in the Philippines&quot; (1950) and &quot;Pony Soldier&quot; (1952). In 1950, he traveled to England to play the title role in &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; on stage at the London Coliseum, bringing in sellout crowds for twenty-three weeks. 

Protesting being cast in one costume film after another, Power refused to star in &quot;Lydia Bailey&quot; with his role going to Dale Robertson; Power was placed under suspension. Power next appeared in &quot;Diplomatic Courier&quot; (1952), a Cold War spy drama directed by Henry Hathaway which received very modest reviews. 

Power&#x27;s movies had been highly profitable for Fox in the past, and as an enticement to renew his contract a third time, Fox offered him the lead role in &quot;The Robe&quot; (1953). He turned it down (Richard Burton was cast instead) and on 1 November 1952, he left on a ten-week national tour with &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot;, a three-person dramatic reading of Stephen Vincent Benét&#x27;s narrative poem, adapted and directed by Charles Laughton, featuring Power, Judith Anderson and Raymond Massey. The tour culminated in a run of 65 shows between February and April 1953 at the New Century Theatre on Broadway. A second national tour with the show began in October 1953, this time for four months, and with Raymond Massey and Anne Baxter. In the same year, Power filmed &quot;King of The Khyber Rifles&quot;, a depiction of India in 1857, with Terry Moore and Michael Rennie. 

Fox now gave Power permission to seek his own roles outside the studio, on the understanding that he would fulfill his fourteen-film commitment to them in between his other projects. He made &quot;The Mississippi Gambler&quot; (1953) for Universal-International, negotiating a deal entitling him to a percentage of the profits. He earned a million dollars from the movie. Also in 1953, actress and producer Katharine Cornell cast Power as her love interest in the play &quot;The Dark is Light Enough&quot;, a verse drama by British dramatist Christopher Fry set in Austria in 1848. Between November 1954 and April 1955, Power toured the United States and Canada in the role, ending with 12 weeks at the ANTA Theater, New York, and two weeks at the Colonial Theater, Boston. His performance in Julian Claman&#x27;s &quot;A Quiet Place&quot;, staged at the National Theater, Washington, at the end of 1955 was warmly received by the critics. 

&quot;Untamed&quot; (1955) was Tyrone Power&#x27;s last movie made under his contract with 20th Century-Fox. The same year saw the release of &quot;The Long Gray Line&quot;, a John Ford film for Columbia Pictures. In 1956, the year Columbia released &quot;The Eddy Duchin Story&quot;, another great success for the star, he returned to England to play the rake Dick Dudgeon in a revival of Shaw&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot; for one week at the Opera House in Manchester, and nineteen weeks at the Winter Garden, London. 

Darryl F. Zanuck persuaded him to play the lead role in &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; (1957), adapted from the Hemingway novel, with Ava Gardner and Errol Flynn. This was his final film with Fox. Released that same year were &quot;Seven Waves Away&quot; (US: &quot;Abandon Ship!&quot;), shot in Great Britain, and John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Rising of the Moon&quot; (narrator only), which was filmed in Ireland, both for Copa Productions.

For Power&#x27;s last completed film role he was cast against type as the accused murderer Leonard Vole in the first film version of Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; (1957), directed by Billy Wilder. The film was a critically well-received box-office success. Writing for the &quot;National Post&quot; in 2002, Robert Fulford commented on Power&#x27;s &quot;superb performance&quot; as &quot;the seedy, stop-at-nothing exploiter of women&quot;. Power returned to the stage in March 1958, to play the lead in Arnold Moss&#x27;s adaptation of Shaw&#x27;s 1921 play &quot;Back to Methuselah&quot;.

==Personal life==
Power was one of Hollywood&#x27;s most eligible bachelors until he married French actress Annabella (born Suzanne Georgette Charpentier) on July 14, 1939. Power and Annabella met on the 20th Century-Fox lot around the time they starred together in the movie &quot;Suez&quot;. Previously, he had involvements with Sonja Henie, Claire Trevor, Joan Woodbury, and Evie Abbott. In an A&amp;E biography, Annabella said that Zanuck &quot;could not stop Tyrone&#x27;s love for me, or my love for Tyrone.&quot; To move her out of Tyrone’s life, Zanuck offered Annabella films in Europe. She refused to leave. At this point, he blacklisted her.

J. Watson Webb, close friend and an editor at 20th Century-Fox, maintained in the &quot;A&amp;E Biography&quot; that one of the reasons the marriage fell apart was Annabella&#x27;s inability to give Power a son, yet, Webb said, there was no bitterness between the couple. In a March 1947 issue of &quot;Photoplay&quot;, Power was interviewed and said that he wanted a home and children, especially a son to carry on his acting legacy.

Annabella shed some light on the situation in an interview published in &quot;Movieland&quot; magazine in 1948. She said, &quot;Our troubles began because the war started earlier for me, a French-born woman, than it did for Americans.&quot; She explained that the war clouds over Europe made her unhappy and irritable, and to get her mind off her troubles, she began accepting stage work, which often took her away from home.

“It is always difficult to put one&#x27;s finger exactly on the place and time where a marriage starts to break up&quot;, she said &quot;but I think it began then. We were terribly sad about it, both of us, but we knew we were drifting apart. I didn&#x27;t think then—and I don&#x27;t think now—that it was his fault, or mine.” The couple tried to make their marriage work when Power returned from military service, but they were unable to do so. However, Power adopted Annabella&#x27;s daughter, Anne, before he left for the service. 

Following his separation from Annabella, Power entered into a love affair with Lana Turner that lasted for a couple of years. In her 1982 autobiography, Turner claimed that she became pregnant with Power&#x27;s child in 1948, but chose to have an abortion.

In 1946, Power and friend Cesar Romero, accompanied by former test pilot, James Denton, a 20th Century Fox executive, and fellow war veteran John Jefferies as navigator, embarked on a goodwill tour throughout South America where they met, among others, Juan and Evita Perón in Argentina. On September 1, 1947, Power set out on another goodwill trip around the world, piloting his own plane, &quot;The Geek&quot;. He flew with Bob Buck, another experienced pilot and war veteran. Buck stated in his autobiography that Power had a photographic mind, was an excellent pilot, and genuinely liked people.” They flew with a crew to various locations in Europe and South Africa, often mobbed by fans when they hit the ground. 

In 1948, when &quot;The Geek&quot; reached Rome, Power met and fell in love with Mexican actress Linda Christian. Turner claimed that the story of her dining out with Power&#x27;s friend Frank Sinatra was leaked to Power and that Power became very upset that she was &quot;dating&quot; another man in his absence. Turner also claimed that it could not have been a coincidence that Linda Christian was at the same hotel as Tyrone Power and implied that Christian had obtained Power&#x27;s itinerary from 20th Century-Fox.

Power and Christian were married in Rome on January 27, 1949, in the Church of Santa Francesca Romana, with an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 screaming fans outside. Christian miscarried three times before giving birth to a baby girl, Romina Francesca Power, on October 2, 1951. A second daughter, Taryn Stephanie Power, was born on September 13, 1953. Around the time of Taryn&#x27;s birth, the marriage was becoming rocky. In her autobiography, Christian blamed the breakup of her marriage on her husband&#x27;s extramarital affairs, including a long involvement with Anita Ekberg, but she acknowledged that she had an affair with Edmund Purdom, which created great tension between Christian and her husband. They divorced in 1955.

After his divorce from Christian, Power had a long-lasting love affair with Mai Zetterling, whom he had met on the set of &quot;Abandon Ship!&quot;. The two lived together, though Power vowed that he would never marry again, because he had been twice burned financially by his previous marriages. He also entered into an affair with a &quot;Vogue&quot; editor, Mary Roblee, and British actress Thelma Ruby. 

In 1957, he met the former Deborah Jean Smith (sometimes incorrectly referred to as Deborah Ann Montgomery), who went by her former married name, Debbie Minardos. They were married on May 7, 1958, and she became pregnant soon after with Tyrone Power Jr., the son he had always wanted.

==Death==

In September 1958, Power and his wife Deborah traveled to Madrid and Valdespartera, Spain, to film the epic &quot;Solomon and Sheba,&quot; directed by King Vidor and costarring Gina Lollobrigida. Probably affected by hereditary heart disease, and a chain smoker who smoked three to four packs a day, Power had filmed about 75% of his scenes when he was stricken by a massive heart attack while filming a dueling scene with his frequent costar and friend George Sanders. A doctor diagnosed the cause of Power&#x27;s death as &quot;fulminant angina pectoris&quot;. Power died while being transported to the hospital in Madrid on November 15, 1958, 

Power was interred at Hollywood Forever Cemetery (then known as Hollywood Cemetery) in a military service on Henry King flew over the service; almost 20 years before, Power had flown in King&#x27;s plane to the set of &quot;Jesse James&quot; in Missouri, Power&#x27;s first experience with flying. Aviation became an important part of Power&#x27;s life, both in the U.S. Marines and as a civilian. In the foreword to Dennis Belafonte&#x27;s &quot;The Films of Tyrone Power,&quot; King wrote: &quot;Knowing his love for flying and feeling that I had started it, I flew over his funeral procession and memorial park during his burial, and felt that he was with me.&quot; 

Power was interred beside a small lake. His grave is marked with a gravestone in the form of a marble bench containing the masks of comedy and tragedy with the inscription &quot;Good night, sweet prince.&quot; At Power&#x27;s grave, Laurence Olivier read the poem &quot;High Flight&quot;.

Power&#x27;s will, filed on December 8, 1958, contained a then-unusual provision that his eyes be donated to the Estelle Doheny Eye Foundation for corneal transplantation or retinal study. 

Deborah Power gave birth to a son on January 22, 1959, two months after her husband&#x27;s death. She remarried within the year to producer Arthur Loew Jr.

==Honours==
For Power&#x27;s contribution to motion pictures, he was honored in 1960 with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame that can be found at 6747 Hollywood Blvd. On the 50th anniversary of his death, Power was honored by American Cinematheque with a weekend of films and remembrances by co-stars and family as well as a memorabilia display at the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles from November 14–16, 2008. Also on display were the two known surviving panels from a large painted glass mural which Power and his wife had commissioned for their home, celebrating highlights of their lives and special moments in Power&#x27;s career, The December 2, 1952, issue of &quot;Look Magazine&quot; had also featured this mural in a four-page spread titled &quot;The Tyrone Powers Pose For Their Portraits&quot;.

Power is shown on the cover of The Beatles&#x27; album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; in the third row. In 2018, Power was ranked the 21st-most-popular male film star in history.

<text>The contraceptive sponge combines barrier and spermicidal methods to prevent conception. Sponges work in two ways. First, the sponge is inserted into the vagina, so it can cover the cervix and prevent any sperm from entering the uterus. Secondly, the sponge contains spermicide.

The sponges are inserted vaginally prior to intercourse and must be placed over the cervix to be effective.
Sponges provide no protection from sexually transmitted infections. Sponges can provide contraception for multiple acts of intercourse over a 24-hour period, but cannot be reused beyond that time or once removed.

==Effectiveness==
Sponge&#x27;s effectiveness is 91% if used perfectly by women who never gave birth, and 80% if used perfectly by women who have given at least one birth. Since it is hard to use the sponge perfectly every time having vaginal sex, its real effectiveness can be lower, and it is advised to combine sponges with other birth control methods, like withdrawal of penis before ejaculation or condoms.

==Use==
To use the sponge, wet the sponge and squeeze it, fold it and put it in the vagina covering the cervix. A sponge works for 24 hours once put in, during which the female can have sex multiple times. Once the sponge is pulled out, it should not be reused and should be trashed, not flushed. The sponge should be left in place for 6 hours after having sex. A sponge should not be in the vagina for more than 30 hours.

==Spermicide==
Sponges are a physical barrier, trapping sperm and preventing their passage through the cervix into the reproductive system. The spermicide is an important component of pregnancy prevention.

==Side effects==
People sensitive to Nonoxynol-9, an ingredient in the spermicide used in the sponge, may experience unpleasant irritation and may face increase risk of sexually transmitted infections. Sponge users may have a slightly higher risk of toxic shock syndrome.

==In popular culture==
*Shortly after they were taken off the U.S. market, the sponge was featured in an episode of the sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot; titled &quot;The Sponge&quot;. In the episode, Elaine Benes conserves her remaining sponges by choosing to not have intercourse unless she is certain her partner is &quot;sponge-worthy&quot;.

<doc id="581221" wikidata="Q4355542" url="?curid=581221" title="Martin Crane">
<text>Martin Crane (born ) is a fictional character from the American television show &quot;Frasier&quot;, and was played by John Mahoney. An army veteran and retired police detective, he is the father of Frasier and Niles Crane.

== Biography ==

Although Martin is first mentioned in an episode of the sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;, his life history is mainly expanded on in &quot;Frasier&quot;. In an eighth season &quot;Cheers&quot; episode, Frasier claims that his father is dead and had been a research scientist. These comments are explained on &quot;Frasier&quot; as being the result of estrangement between Martin and Frasier at the time. (Mahoney also appeared in &quot;Cheers&quot; as a piano player and jingle writer.)

The son of a police officer, Martin was born in Seattle in 1932 and is a lifelong resident of the city. His great-grandparents were Noah Crane and a scullery maid from Russia. At the age of 19, Martin joined the U.S. Army, and saw combat in the Korean War. After returning home Martin joined the Seattle Police Department, and would remain in this capacity until being forced to retire due to being shot in the hip in 1991, at age 59. He served in various roles including as a patrol officer as well as a mounted patrol officer and eventually attained the position of Homicide Detective. He was also assigned to a vice detail for a year. He was married to Hester Rose Crane, a forensic psychiatrist whom he met in 1952 at a murder scene (it would later be revealed that Hester would commemorate their anniversary every year by making gingerbread men in the shape of the corpse). They remained married until her death in 1987, some six years before Martin moves in with Frasier.

Hester rejected his first marriage proposal, but the two married when she became pregnant with Frasier. The marriage was mostly a happy and loving one, but there were numerous issues; in particular, Hester had an affair with a family friend following a particularly difficult period in the marriage. Martin blamed himself for his wife&#x27;s infidelity, which occurred about 30 years before the timeline of the show, and initially tells his sons that he had been the adulterer. The revelation brings Martin and Frasier closer together after Frasier confesses that his ex-wife Lilith also cheated on him.

Martin has a brother named Walt (who is married to a Greek woman named Zora), and one nephew, Walt and Zora&#x27;s son Nikos. Martin and Walt are estranged, thanks to Zora&#x27;s hostility toward Frasier&#x27;s meddling in Nikos&#x27; life (encouraging him to follow his dream of becoming a professional juggler, rather than the more reputable profession his domineering mother wanted for him). They eventually reconcile, however. There is a discrepancy in the storyline, as Martin states in an earlier episode that he never had a brother.

In 1991, Martin was looking forward to retirement when he was shot by a man named David Hicks in the line of duty after interrupting a robbery attempt in a convenience store. Niles visited him, but the two had drifted apart. Although he hoped to return to work in a few weeks, the injury left a bullet in his left hip, forcing him to walk with a cane, held in his right hand, for the rest of his life, and to retire from the police force.

His injury inhibits him from living alone, and forces him to accept Frasier&#x27;s invitation to live with him upon Frasier&#x27;s return to Seattle. Martin soon grows close to his physical therapist, Daphne Moon, and steadily becomes closer to both his sons, despite their different tastes and personalities. Because he and his sons have no hobbies or interests in common, he also grows to be close to Frasier&#x27;s producer, Roz Doyle. He invites her to his poker games on numerous occasions, and responds warmly to her laid-back, &quot;one of the guys&quot; personality. On one of his birthdays, she presents him with a six-pack of beers, and this turns out to be the only gift he seems to genuinely enjoy that day.

Despite already being handicapped and retired from the police force, one of Martin&#x27;s greatest achievements comes in his sixties when he solves the notorious &quot;Weeping Lotus&quot; murder, a cold case that had confounded himself and the rest of the police force for decades. The resolution brings a long-awaited measure of satisfaction and peace of mind to Martin, who had made a vow to the victim&#x27;s mother that he&#x27;d find and apprehend the killer, and was becoming concerned that she would die of old age before he did.

Romantically, Martin is reluctant to begin dating again, but while living with Frasier he has a number of relationships with various women. By the end of the show, Martin reacquaints himself with Ronee Lawrence, a woman who, as a teenager babysat Frasier and Niles. They become involved in a romance, which escalates into a marriage proposal. The ceremony takes place in the final episode of the series, establishing a new chapter in Martin&#x27;s life.
Martin died in his early 90s in 2023. The flag at the Washington state capitol was held at half-mast in his honor.

== Personality ==
Unlike his sons, Martin Crane is very down-to-earth and unpretentious. His tastes are generally simpler than those of his sons and reflect popular culture to a greater degree. Martin prefers drinking beer (specifically Ballantine Beer, a lager) to wine or spirits, for example, and prefers watching action movies and professional sports to the opera and theatre preferred by Frasier and Niles. While Martin occasionally visits Café Nervosa to see his sons, he dislikes its elaborate and expensive drinks and often visits a bar, McGinty&#x27;s, with his best friend, Duke. He is shown to be a big fan of the New York Yankees, Seattle Mariners, the Seattle SuperSonics, and the Seattle Seahawks. He often displays an autographed photo of Ken Griffey Jr., and always listens to Bulldog Briscoe&#x27;s &quot;Gonzo Sports Show&quot; on KACL. He likes the music of Frank Sinatra. In the earlier seasons especially, most of the comedy and drama of the series stems from the culture clashes between the refined sons and the blue-collar father (the sons frequently considering themselves superior in both taste and intellectual matters to their father, Niles once admitted that he often does not listen to Martin&#x27;s advice because he &quot;doesn&#x27;t have any credentials&quot;), and the struggles between Frasier and Martin in sharing an apartment.

One of the disputes between Frasier and Martin is a decades-old, well-worn recliner that Martin owns; Frasier is appalled by its appearance in his living room. Initially Frasier figures the perfect present for his father is to purchase him an expensive leather recliner that replaces Martin&#x27;s old one. This greatly upsets Martin when he explains the sentimental value of the chair to Frasier, who feels extreme guilt and proceeds to get the recliner back for his father and returns the new one. Later, Frasier accidentally destroys the chair, and to make amends has a replica built at great expense (remarking that, ironically, it was now the most expensive piece of furniture in his apartment). In one of the series&#x27; final episodes, Martin sits in the leather recliner Frasier originally picked and admits he likes it after all.

Martin has a complex and frequently difficult relationship with both his sons, both of whom take after their mother. They have little interest in the traditionally masculine pursuits that interest Martin, such as sports and outdoor activities, just as Martin himself finds little of interest in their pursuits, such as cooking, collecting antiques and opera. Martin also places little stock in (and is frequently and loudly dismissive of) psychiatry, something which—as both of his sons are psychiatrists—also undoubtedly contributed to the rift between them. On a few occasions, he actually exhibits genuine psychological know-how and intellect, surprising Frasier and Niles (although Martin usually waves off these situations and thinks nothing of it; he can, at times, attribute this to his listening to Frasier&#x27;s radio show). Martin also frequently clashed with and was vocally dismissive of both of his sons&#x27; romantic interests (in particular their wives, Maris and Lilith), which also added to the bad feeling between the men. Martin does not hesitate in telling his sons of their attitudes, on one occasion telling them that their mother never displayed snobbery.

Because they share similar blue collar, easygoing personalities, as well as an interest in sports, Martin gets along very well with Frasier&#x27;s close friend Sam Malone. When Sam visits Frasier, Sam and Martin bond over sports trivia. Martin was also a fan of Sam&#x27;s when Sam was a baseball player, and says he is &quot;the most important person to set foot in this apartment.&quot; Martin also bonds with Norm Peterson on a trip to Boston. (Martin: &quot;Wow, that&#x27;s some mug callus you&#x27;ve got there.&quot; Norm: &quot;Judging from your grip, I&#x27;d say you were a can man.&quot;)

A dramatic irony frequently shown in the series is that while Frasier and Niles may possess more intellectual knowledge and refinement than Martin, it is in fact Martin who is a wiser and more pragmatic individual. Certainly, Martin possesses greater reserves of common sense and experience than his two sons, and while his sons may be trained in psychiatry, it is frequently Martin&#x27;s advice in any scenario that is more sound. Much to Frasier&#x27;s consternation, Martin displays a native intelligence in playing chess, despite his lack of formal education, and he bests Frasier in all but one game. He is usually quick to foresee the catastrophes and crises that Frasier and Niles&#x27; various plans and actions will result in, and is capable of advising the best way to avoid this—however, their senses of superiority, stubbornness and neuroses frequently ensure that Frasier and Niles will disregard his advice and blunder into chaos anyway. This can lead to Martin at times taking an almost gleeful delight in the misfortunes and downfalls of his sons, and he is often quick to point out that he told them so. Martin is prone to letting his stubbornness get in the way of happiness, that Frasier often helps him solve, such as forcing Martin to acknowledge his feelings for one romantic partner, Sherry Dempsey.

Martin is a gruff and taciturn man who finds it difficult to express himself emotionally—in particular to his family and loved ones, with whom he can be quite withdrawn and remote. He often comes across as curmudgeonly and ungrateful to Frasier for taking care of him. In the episode &quot;Breaking the Ice&quot;, for example, he finds it easier to say the words &quot;I love you&quot; to both his dog Eddie and Duke than he does to either of his sons; when he finally does so, Martin has first heavily imbibed of alcohol, and cannot look Frasier or Niles in the eye as he does so. He is certainly less comfortable with emotional exchanges than either of his sons, who find it much easier to express themselves in such a fashion. His blunt, open manner can make him seem tactless and insensitive. He is quite stubborn, and is given to holding grudges. He has stated that he believes justice should be the same for everyone when he refused to help Niles take care of a legal problem for Maris; he has, nevertheless used his position as an ex-policeman for preferential treatment on occasion, such as when he flashed his badge to a border guard in order to alleviate his suspicions. Martin has also come to his sons and Daphne in need, when concerning police matters by advising them.

For all this, Martin is portrayed as an extremely likable and caring individual. He is usually enthusiastic about making new friends, and although he may find it difficult to express his feelings to his sons, he clearly loves them both, remaining proud of and devoted to them, and bitterly resenting any implication that this might not be the case. When Niles goes to a costume party as Martin and is asked to name his biggest disappointment in life, Niles&#x27; response (in character and slightly inebriated) turns this into a speech of his distaste for his and Frasier&#x27;s pretentiousness, snobbery, and lack of athleticism before finally saying &quot;if I had to choose my &quot;two&quot; biggest disappointments&quot;. Martin quickly cuts him off, angered at being portrayed &quot;as a drunken judgmental jackass&quot;, and tells Niles that, while he and Frasier were not what he was expecting, he has always been proud of them.

<text>Clarendon station is a side platformed Washington Metro station in the Clarendon neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia, United States. The station was opened on December 1, 1979, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). The station serves the Orange and Silver Lines. In 2017, over 4,000 commuters used Clarendon station every day.

==Location==
Clarendon is located in the Arlington district of the same name at the intersection of Highland Street, Clarendon Boulevard, and Wilson Boulevard. The station entrance itself lies in a park-like median between Clarendon and Wilson Boulevards. There is an underpass providing access to the Omsted Building on the south side of Clarendon Boulevard.

The presence of Clarendon station has transformed the surrounding district into an urban village. As a result, a number of residential and shopping complexes have opened. These include the residential buildings such as Station Square, Clarendon 1021, The Phoenix at Clarendon, and The Hartford along with the Market Common Clarendon shopping center.

==History==
The station was constructed by the Nello L. Teer Company, and opened on December 1, 1979. Its opening coincided with the completion of approximately of rail west of the Rosslyn station and the opening of the Court House, Virginia Square and Ballston stations.

From March 26, 2020 until June 28, 2020, this station was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Station layout ==
Similar to many of the stations opened at the same time, Clarendon uses a side platform setup with two tracks. Architecturally, as part of the first generation of underground stations, the &quot;waffle&quot; coffer style predominates at Clarendon.

Escalators bring passengers to the mezzanine level, which contains the faregates and ticket machines. Clarendon station is quite shallow, so much in fact that there is a staircase in between the two escalators that reach street level.

<text>Court House station is an island platformed Washington Metro station in the Courthouse neighborhood of Arlington County, Virginia. The station was opened on December 1, 1979, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Weekday ridership is approximately 7,000 passengers per day. The station serves the Orange and Silver Lines.

== Location ==
As the name implies, the station is located near the Arlington County government and court complex, with its main entrance at the intersection of Wilson Boulevard and Uhle Street.

==History==
The station opened on December 1, 1979. Its opening coincided with the completion of approximately of rail west of the Rosslyn station and the opening of the Clarendon, Virginia Square and Ballston stations. Presently, there are long-range plans to create a new entrance for the station at its western end. These plans envision an elevator that would connect the western end of the platform to a location near the corner of Clarendon Boulevard and Barton Street.

== Station layout ==
This station is the third deepest station on the Orange and Silver Lines behind L&#x27;Enfant Plaza and Rosslyn. Its platforms are located approximately below street level. Similar to most Red Line stations north of Cleveland Park, Court House contains an upper underpass mezzanine below the street level. A long bank of escalators connects the upper mezzanine to the lower mezzanine. The platforms are located below the mezzanine.

A knockout panel exists on the far end of the station vault to allow construction of a second mezzanine and series of exits in the future.

Court House is one of the few Washington Metro stations outside the Red Line that contain deep-bored, elliptical escalator banks. Unlike most Metro stations, Court House station has four exits.

<doc id="581246" wikidata="Q2141556" url="?curid=581246" title="Wobble base pair">
<text>A wobble base pair is a pairing between two nucleotides in RNA molecules that does not follow Watson-Crick base pair rules. The four main wobble base pairs are guanine-uracil (G-U), hypoxanthine-uracil (I-U), hypoxanthine-adenine (I-A), and hypoxanthine-cytosine (I-C). In order to maintain consistency of nucleic acid nomenclature, &quot;I&quot; is used for hypoxanthine because hypoxanthine is the nucleobase of inosine;
nomenclature otherwise follows the names of nucleobases and their corresponding nucleosides (e.g., &quot;G&quot; for both guanine and guanosine – as well as for deoxyguanosine). The thermodynamic stability of a wobble base pair is comparable to that of a Watson-Crick base pair. Wobble base pairs are fundamental in RNA secondary structure and are critical for the proper translation of the genetic code.

==Brief history==
In the genetic code, there are 43 = 64 possible codons (three-nucleotide sequences). For translation, each of these codons requires a tRNA molecule with an anticodon with which it can stably complement. If each tRNA molecule is paired with its complementary mRNA codon using canonical Watson-Crick base pairing, then 64 types of tRNA molecule would be required. In the standard genetic code, three of these 64 mRNA codons (UAA, UAG and UGA) are stop codons. These terminate translation by binding to release factors rather than tRNA molecules, so canonical pairing would require 61 species of tRNA. Since most organisms have fewer than 45 types of tRNA, ⁣ some tRNA types can pair with multiple, synonymous codons, all of which encode the same amino acid. In 1966, Francis Crick proposed the Wobble Hypothesis to account for this. He postulated that the 5&#x27; base on the anticodon, which binds to the 3&#x27; base on the mRNA, was not as spatially confined as the other two bases and could, thus, have non-standard base pairing. Crick creatively named it for the small amount of &quot;play&quot; or wobble that occurs at this third codon position. Movement (&quot;wobble&quot;) of the base in the 5&#x27; anticodon position is necessary for small conformational adjustments that affect the overall pairing geometry of anticodons of tRNA.

As an example, yeast tRNAPhe has the anticodon 5&#x27;-GmAA-3&#x27; and can recognize the codons 5&#x27;-UUC-3&#x27; and 5&#x27;-UUU-3&#x27;. It is, therefore, possible for non-Watson–Crick base pairing to occur at the third codon position, i.e., the 3&#x27; nucleotide of the mRNA codon and the 5&#x27; nucleotide of the tRNA anticodon.

===Wobble hypothesis===
These notions led Francis Crick to the creation of the wobble hypothesis, a set of four relationships explaining these naturally occurring attributes.
# The first two bases in the codon create the coding specificity, for they form strong Watson-Crick base pairs and bond strongly to the anticodon of the tRNA.
# When reading 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; the first nucleotide in the anticodon (which is on the tRNA and pairs with the last nucleotide of the codon on the mRNA) determines how many nucleotides the tRNA actually distinguishes. If the first nucleotide in the anticodon is a C or an A, pairing is specific and acknowledges original Watson-Crick pairing, that is: only one specific codon can be paired to that tRNA. If the first nucleotide is U or G, the pairing is less specific and in fact two bases can be interchangeably recognized by the tRNA. Inosine displays the true qualities of wobble, in that if that is the first nucleotide in the anticodon, any of three bases in the original codon can be matched with the tRNA.
# Due to the specificity inherent in the first two nucleotides of the codon, if one amino acid is coded for by multiple anticodons and those anticodons differ in either the second or third position (first or second position in the codon) then a different tRNA is required for that anticodon.
# The minimum requirement to satisfy all possible codons (61 excluding three stop codons) is 32 tRNAs. That is 31 tRNAs for the amino acids and one initiation codon.

===tRNA base pairing schemes===
Wobble pairing rules. Watson-Crick base pairs are shown in bold. Parentheses denote bindings that work but will be favoured less. A leading x denotes derivatives (in general) of the base that follows.
==Biological importance==
Aside from the necessity of wobble, that our cells have a limited amount of tRNAs and wobble allows for more flexibility, wobble base pairs have been shown to facilitate many biological functions, most clearly demonstrated in the bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, a model organism. In fact, in a study of &quot;E. coli&quot;″s tRNA for alanine there is a wobble base pair that determines whether the tRNA will be aminoacylated. When a tRNA reaches an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase, the job of the synthetase is to join the t-shaped RNA with its amino acid. These aminoacylated tRNAs go on to the translation of an mRNA transcript, and are the fundamental elements that connect to the codon of the amino acid. The necessity of the wobble base pair is illustrated through experimentation where the Guanine-Uracil pairing is changed to its natural Guanine-Cytosine pairing. Oligoribonucleotides were synthesized on a Gene Assembler Plus, and then spread across a DNA sequence known to code a tRNA for alanine, 2D-NMRs are then run on the products of these new tRNAs and compared to the wobble tRNAs. The results indicate that with that wobble base pair changed, structure is also changed and an alpha helix can no longer be formed. The alpha helix was the recognizable structure for the aminoacyl tRNA synthetase and thus the synthetase does not connect the amino acid alanine with the tRNA for alanine. This wobble base pairing is essential for the use of the amino acid alanine in &quot;E. coli&quot; and its significance here would imply significance in many related species. More information can be seen on aminoacyl tRNA synthetase and the genomes of &quot;E. coli&quot; tRNA at the External links, &quot;Information on Aminoacyl tRNA Synthetases&quot; and &quot;Genomic tRNA Database&quot;.

<doc id="581256" wikidata="Q1372674" url="?curid=581256" title="Es'kia Mphahlele">
<text>Es&#x27;kia Mphahlele (17 December 1919 – 27 October 2008) was a South African writer, educationist, artist and activist celebrated as the Father of African Humanism and one of the founding figures of modern African literature.

He was given the name Ezekiel Mphahlele at birth but changed his name to Es&#x27;kia in 1977. His journey from a childhood in the slums of Pretoria to a literary icon was an odyssey both intellectually and politically. As a writer, he brought his own experiences in and outside South Africa to bear on his short stories, fiction, autobiography and history, developing the concept of African humanism. He skilfully evoked the black experience under apartheid in &quot;Down Second Avenue&quot; (1959). It recounted his struggle to get an education and the setbacks he experienced in his teaching career.

Mphahlele wrote two autobiographies, more than 30 short stories, two verse plays and a number of poems. He is described as the &quot;Dean of African Letters&quot;.

He was the recipient of numerous international awards. In 1984, he was awarded the Order of the Palm by the French government for his contribution to French Language and Culture. He was the recipient of the 1998 World Economic Forum Crystal Award for Outstanding Service to the Arts and Education. In 1998, former President Nelson Mandela awarded Mphahlele the Order of the Southern Cross, then the highest recognition granted by the South African Government (equivalent today to the Order of Mapungubwe).

==Biography ==

===Family life===

Es&#x27;kia Mphahlele was born in Pretoria, in the Union of South Africa, in 1919. From the age of five, he lived with his paternal grandmother in Maupaneng Village, in GaMphahlele (now in Lepelle-Nkumpi Municipality), Limpopo Province, where he herded cattle and goats. His mother, Eva, took him and his two siblings to go live with her in Marabastad (2nd Avenue) when he was 12 years old.

He married Rebecca Nnana Mochedibane, whose family was a victim of forced removals in Vrededorp, in 1945 (the same year his mother died). A qualified social worker with a diploma from Jan Hofmeyer School, in Johannesburg, she and Mphahlele would have five children. When he went into exile from South Africa, he left behind his entire extended family, except for his wife and children, going for years without seeing them. While in Nigeria, he once tried taking advantage of a British passport before Nigerian independence. He applied for a visa through the consulate in Nairobi, in order to visit his younger brother Bassie (Solomon) who was ill with throat cancer, but his application was turned down.

====Rebecca Nnana Mochedibane (Mphahlele)====

Rebecca was born in Sophiatown. She first qualified as a teacher before pursuing a social work diploma. She remembered meeting &quot;Zeke&quot;, and being very impressed by him: &quot;The other young men were not readers and I could not relate to them. They could not relate to the outside world through literature.&quot; The couple met when Mphahlele was working at the Blind Institute, in Roodepoort. A group of teacher students had come to visit the institute where they read books to the elderly. Es&#x27;kia was impressed and requested to visit Rebecca in her hometown during the holidays. It was Rebecca&#x27;s final year at the training college. The couple decided on 29 August 1945 as their wedding date. Mphahlele&#x27;s mother had fallen sick, and died at the age of 45, just before the couple got married.

&quot;For her part, Rebecca, always busy with the kids, survived by her own ingenuity and native practical sense, by her outgoing temperament. She has always been able to bulldoze into a new community, let people know what her intentions are, openly tell them what she likes and what she doesn&#x27;t, without being either rude or patronising&quot; –Es&#x27;kia Mphahlele.

In Kenya, she worked as a social worker in the U.N. Freedom From Hunger Campaign, in charge of their educational programme.

She read for her MA in Social Work at the University of Denver.

===As a student ===

At the age of 15, Mphahlele began attending school regularly and enrolled at St Peters Secondary School, in Rosettenville (Johannesburg). He finished high school by private study. That became his learning method until his PhD qualification. He obtained a First-Class Pass (Junior Certificate). He received his Joint Matriculation Board Certificate from the University of South Africa in 1943. While teaching at Orlando High School, Mphahlele obtained his B.A. in 1949 from the University of South Africa, majoring in English, Psychology and African Administration. In 1955, he received his Honours degree in English from the same institution. While working at &quot;Drum&quot; magazine, Mphahlele made history by becoming the first person to graduate M.A. with distinction at UNISA, in 1957. His thesis was entitled &quot;The Non-European Character in South African English Fiction&quot;.

From 1966 to 1968, under the sponsorship of the Farfield Foundation, Mphahlele became a Teaching Fellow in the Department of English at the University of Denver, Colorado, where he earned his PhD in Creative Writing. In lieu of a thesis, he wrote a novel entitled &quot;The Wanderers&quot;. He was subsequently awarded First Prize for the best African novel (1968–69) by &quot;African Arts&quot; magazine at the University of California, Los Angeles.

===As an educator===

Mphahlele obtained his Teacher&#x27;s Certificate at Adams College in 1940. He served at Ezenzeleni Blind Institute as a teacher and a shorthand-typist from 1941 to 1945. He and his wife moved their family to Orlando East, near the historic Orlando High School, in Soweto as he joined the school in 1945 as an English and Afrikaans teacher. There, in the company of many freshly-minted from Fort Hare young teachers, he became active in the Transvaal African Teachers&#x27; Association (TATA). The 1949 Eislen Commission on Native Education, inspired by Dr. Hendrik Verwoerd, the recently elected National Party&#x27;s Minister of Native Affairs, had recommended a radically new system of Education for Africans. TATA, together with other teachers&#x27; organisations in the Cape, the Free State and Natal, took up the cudgels to oppose it. For his participation in that agitation, in December 1952 Mphahlele, Isaac Matlare and Zephania Mothopeng were dismissed from their posts. Mphahlele&#x27;s protest against the introduction of Bantu Education resulted in his teaching career being cut short.

He was banned from teaching anywhere in South Africa by the apartheid government. He left South Africa and went into exile. His first stop was Nigeria, where he taught in a high school for 15 months, then at the University of Ibadan, in their extension programme. He also worked at the C.M.S. Grammar School, in Lagos. He worked in the Department of Extra-Mural Studies at the University of Ibadan, travelling to various outlying districts to teach adults. While based in Paris, he became a visiting lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He also lectured in Sweden, France, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Senegal and Nigeria. Mphahlele believed that alternative education can pave the way for a transformative and humane educational system for all.

===Life in exile===

==== Nigeria (1957–61)====

Mphahlele spent 20 years in exile, of which he spent four years in Nigeria with his family. He wrote: &quot;It was a fruitful experience. The people of Nigeria were generous. The condition of being an outsider was not burdensome. I had time to write and engage in the arts.&quot; He was working with the best in Nigerian; playwright, poet and novelist Wole Soyinka; poets Gabriel Okara and Mabel Segun; novelist Amos Tutuola; sculptor Ben Enwonwu; and painters Demas Nwoko and Uche Okeke, and so on. His visits to Ghana became frequent as each trip added more literary giants to his list of networks and colleagues. The University of Ghana would invite him to conduct extramural writers&#x27; workshops. That is where he met Kofi Awoonor (then George Awoonor Williams), playwright Efua Sutherland, poet Frank Kobina Parkes, musicologist Professor Kwabena Nketia, historian Dr J. B. Danquah, poet G. Adali-Mortty and sculptor Vincent Kofi.

Mphahlele attended the first All-African Peoples&#x27; Conference organised by Kwame Nkrumah in Accra, Ghana, in December 1958. &quot;Ghana was the only African country that had been freed from the European colonialism that had swept over the continent in the 19th century. Most of the countries represented at Accra were still colonies.&quot; Mphahlele recalls meeting with the late Patrick Duncan and Jordan Ngubane, who were representing the South African liberal view. It was at this conference that Mphahlele met Kenneth Kaunda, and listened to Frantz Fanon deliver a fiery speech against colonialism. Rebecca, his wife, returned to South Africa towards the end of 1959, to give birth to their last-born, Chabi. They returned in February 1960. They were in Nigeria when they heard about the Sharpeville Massacre. Mphahlele said: &quot;Yes, Nigeria and Ghana gave Afrika back to me. We had just celebrated Ghana’s independence, and were three years away from Nigeria&#x27;s.&quot;

====France (1961–63)====

Mphahlele moved his family to France in August 1961, their second major move. He was appointed as the Director of the African Program of The Congress for Cultural Freedom and went to Paris. They lived on Boulevard du Montparnasse, just off St. Michel, a few blocks from the Le Select and La Coupole restaurants. Their apartment was soon to become a kind of crossroads for writers and artists: Ethiopian artist Skunder Boghossian; Wole Soyinka; Gambian poet Lenrie Peters; South African poet in exile Mazisi Kunene; Ghanaian poet and his beloved friend J. P. Clark; and Gerard Sekoto. It was during his stay in France when Mphahlele was invited by Ulli Beier and other Nigerian writers to help form the Mbari Writers and Artists Club in Ibadan. They raised money from Merrill Foundation in New York to finance Mbari Publications, a venture the club had undertaken. Work by Wole Soyinka, Lenrie Peters and others was first published by Mbari Publishers before finding its way to commercial houses. He edited and contributed to &quot;Black Orpheus&quot;, the Ibadan-based literary journal. He toured and worked in major African cities including Kampala, Brazzaville, Yaoundé, Accra, Abidjan, Freetown and Dakar. He also attended seminars connected with work in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, West Germany, Italy, and the US.

Mphahlele went on to set up an Mbari Centre in Enugu, Nigeria, under the directorship of John Enekwe. In 1962, at Makerere University, in Kampala, Uganda, they organised the first African Writers Conference, attended also by fellow South Africans Bob Leshoai, who was on tour, and Neville Rubin, who was editing a journal of political comment in South Africa. Two conferences, one in Dakar and another in Freetown were organised in 1963. Their aim was to throw into open debate the place of African literature in the university curriculum. They wanted to drum support up for the inclusion of African literature as a substantive area of study at university, where traditionally it was being pushed into extramural departments and institutes of African Studies. Mphahlele had only planned to stay in Paris for two years, after which he would return to teaching. Those experiences had made him yearn for the classroom again.

==== Kenya (1963–66)====

John Hunt, the executive director of the Congress for Cultural Freedom suggested that Mphahlele establish a centre like the Nigerian Mbari in Nairobi. Mphahlele arrived in Nairobi in August 1963, and December had been set for Kenya&#x27;s independence. By the time Rebecca and the children arrived, he had already bought a house. Prior to that, he had been housed by Elimo Njau, a Tanzanian painter. Njau suggested a name everyone liked – &quot;Chemchemi&quot;, Kiswahili for &quot;fountain&quot;. Within a few months, they had converted a warehouse into offices, a small auditorium for experimental theatre and intimate music performances, and an art gallery. Njau ran the art gallery on a voluntary basis. He mounted successful exhibitions of Ugandan artists Kyeyune and Msango, and of his own work. &quot;My soul was in the job. I was in charge of writing and theatre&quot; (Mphahlele, &quot;Africa My Music&quot;).

Their participants were from the townships and locations that were a colonial heritage. Mphahlele would travel to districts to outside districts to run writers&#x27; workshops in schools that invited him, accompanied by the centre&#x27;s drama group. Their travelling was well captured in &quot;Busara&quot;, edited by Ngugi wa Thiong&#x27;o and &quot;Zuka&quot;, edited by Kariara. When the Alliance High School for Girls (just outside Nairobi) asked him to write a play for its annual drama festival, in the place of the routine Shakespeare Mphahlele adapted Grace Ogot&#x27;s &quot;The Rain Came&quot;, a short story, and called it &quot;Oganda’s Journey&quot;. &quot;The most enchanting element in the play was the use of traditional musical idioms from a variety of ethnic groups on Kenya. A most refreshing performance, which exploited the girl’s natural and untutored acting,&quot; he said. After serving for two years, he felt he done what he had come for, as he had indicated before taking the job that he would not stay for more than two years. He turned down a lecturing post at the University College of Nairobi. They could only offer him a one-year contract, which he could not take.

====Colorado, US (1966–74)====

In May 1966 Mphahlele moved his family to Colorado, where he was joining the University of Denver&#x27;s English Department. Mphahlele was granted a tuition waiver by the university for the course work he had to do before he could be admitted for the PhD dissertation. He paid for the &quot;Afrikan Literature&quot; and &quot;Freshman Composition&quot; himself.

====Philadelphia (1974–77)====

The Mphahlele family arrived in Philadelphia in May 1974. Mphahlele was about to begin a lecturing career at the University of Pennsylvania in September of that year. They had bought a house in Wayne, some 24 kilometres from Philadelphia, on the Western Mainline.

Mphahlele spent his time in Philadelphia teaching, writing and never stopped thinking about going back home to South Africa. He recalled how since their days in Denver, he and Rebecca had longed to be in Africa again, and it had to be South Africa. They felt anything else would just be an adventure. They longed for community, a cultural milieu in which their work could be relevant. They were considered to have become British nationals, and had to approach the South African government through a single person in authority, Dr. C. N. Phatudi, the then Chief Minister of Lebowa, who had agreed to make representations on their behalf. As their application was being processed, which took more than five years, his books were still being banned in South Africa.

===As a novelist and short-story writer===

It was during his primary school days when he started rooting everywhere for newsprint to read. He recalled always looking for any old scrap of paper to read. He further recalled a small one-room tin shack the then municipality called a &quot;reading room&quot;, on the western edge of Marbastad. He remembered it being stacked with dilapidated books and journals, junked by some bored ladies in the suburbs. He dug out of the pile Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, and went through the whole lot like a termite, elated by the sense of discovery, recognition of the printed word and by the mere practice of the skill of reading. Cervantes stood out in his mind, although his imagination was also fired by the silent movies of the 1930s. He enjoyed a combination of Cervantes&#x27; Don Quixote and Sancho Panza together with Laurel and Hardy and Buster Keaton. Mphahlele would read the subtitles aloud to his friends who could not read well, amid the yells and foot stamping and bouncing on chairs to the rhythm of the action.

The 1959 publication of his autobiographical novel &quot;Down Second Avenue&quot; drew worldwide interest in Mphahlele as a writer, and focused a powerful spotlight on the internal dynamics of South Africa as it steadily drifted toward greater racial oppression and greater world isolation. Now a classic of African literature, &quot;Down Second Avenue&quot; had successful printings in English, French, German, Russian, Dutch and Japanese, reflecting the impact and international popularity of the book. Mphahlele&#x27;s second novel, &quot;The Wanderers&quot;, was a story chronicling the experience of exiles in Africa.

While in Paris, Mphahlele published &quot;The Living and the Dead&quot;, in 1961. Six years later, in East Africa, he published &quot;In Corner B&quot;. The contents of both collections of short stories are included in &quot;The Unbroken Song&quot; (1986), which also contains some of his poems.
As part of his Master&#x27;s thesis, in 1962 he published &quot;The African Image&quot;, which provides a historical perspective of South African literature. In 1967, he edited the anthology &quot;African Writing Today&quot;, which was published by Penguin. During his PhD, he produced &quot;The Wanderers&quot;, a novel of exile originally submitted as a dissertation for his PhD in creative writing. &quot;Down Second Avenue&quot; was doing so well such that it was translated into French and German in 1964. In December 1978, the Minister of Justice took Mphahlele&#x27;s name off the list of writers who may be quoted, and whose works may not be circulated in the country. Only &quot;Down Second Avenue&quot;, &quot;Voices in the Whirlwind&quot; and &quot;Modern African Stories&quot;, which he had co-edited, could then be read in the country. Other publications remained banned.

The first comprehensive collection of his critical writing was published under the title &quot;ES&#x27;KIA&quot; in 2002, the same year that the Es&#x27;kia Institute was founded. Mphahlele&#x27;s life and work is currently found in the efforts of a non-governmental, non-profit organisation based in Johannesburg.

===Return to South Africa===

Mphahlele set foot on South African soil on 3 July 1976, at the Jan Smuts Airport (now O. R. Tambo International Airport). He had been invited by the Black Studies Institute in Johannesburg to read a paper at its inaugural conference. He recalled: &quot;I was emerging on to the concourse when I was startled by a tremendous shout. And they were on top of me – some one hundred Africans, screaming and jostling to embrace me, kiss me. Relatives, friends and pressmen from my two home cities – Johannesburg and Pretoria. I was bounced hither and thither and would most probably not have noticed if an arm or legs were torn off of me, or my neck was being wrung. Such an overwhelming ecstasy of that reunion. The police had to come and disperse the crowd as it had now taken over the concourse.&quot;

Mphahlele returned to Philadelphia on 27 July 1976, after three stimulating weeks in South Africa. He and Rebecca wrote letter after letter, yearning to return home. Mphahlele believed there were armed with what was necessary to contribute towards building South Africa. He was certain that the social work and education knowledge and experience through their qualifications could be rewarding if they were part of a cultural matrix, and promoted the extension of culture, the growth of the people.

The Mphahleles officially returned to South Africa in 1977, on Rebecca&#x27;s birthday (17 August). &quot;When I came back, things were much worse. People were resisting what had become a more and more oppressive government. We came back at a dangerous time. It was a time when we knew we would not be alone, and that we would be among our people&quot; (Mphahlele, 2002). Mphahlele waited for six months for the then University of the North to inform him whether he would get the post of English professor which was still vacant. The answer was &quot;no&quot;. The government service of Lebowa offered him a job as an inspector of schools for English teaching. Rebecca had found a job as a social worker. In his autobiography &quot;Afrika My Music&quot;, he describes how the ten months of being an inspector were like. &quot;I had the opportunity to of travelling the length and breadth of the territory visiting schools and demonstrating aspects of English teaching. I saw for myself the damage of Bantu Education had wrought in our schooling system over the last twenty-five years. Some teachers could not even express themselves fluently or correctly in front of a class, and others spelled words wrongly on the blackboard.&quot;

In 1979, he joined the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits University) as a senior research fellow at the African Studies Institute. He founded the Council for Black Education and Research, an independent project for alternative education involving young adults. He founded the department of African literature at Wits University in 1983, a significant event in the evolution of literature teaching in South Africa at the time. He became the institution&#x27;s first black professor. He was permitted to honour an invitation from the then Institute for Study of English in Africa at Rhodes University. It was a two-month research fellowship where his proposal of finishing his memoir &quot;Afrika My Music&quot;, which he had begun in Philadelphia, was accepted.

After his retirement from Wits University in 1987, Mphahlele was appointed as the executive chairman of the board of directors at Funda Centre for Community Education. He continued visiting other universities as a visiting professor teaching mostly African Literature. He spent two months at Harvard University&#x27;s Graduate School of Education teaching a module on secondary-school education in South Africa. With the end of apartheid, he emerged as an eloquent proponent of the need to nurture the arts to feed a culture traumatized by colonization and oppression. The Es&#x27;kia Institute is named after him, honouring his life, teachings and philosophies. His return home and contribution towards the development of the country and continent&#x27;s literary development is still being celebrated in many forms, with some towns choosing to name significant streets after him.

<doc id="581260" wikidata="Q645289" url="?curid=581260" title="Boeing VC-25">
<text>The Boeing VC-25 is a military version of the Boeing 747 airliner, modified for presidential transport and commonly operated by the United States Air Force (USAF) as &quot;Air Force One&quot;, the call sign of any U.S. Air Force aircraft carrying the president of the United States.

Only two examples of this aircraft type are in service; they are highly modified Boeing 747-200Bs, designated VC-25A and having tail numbers 28000 and 29000. Although technically the &quot;Air Force One&quot; designation applies to the aircraft only while the president is on board, the term is commonly used to refer to the VC-25 in general. The two aircraft often operate in conjunction with &quot;Marine One&quot; helicopters, which ferry the president to airports whenever a vehicle motorcade would be inappropriate.

Two new aircraft, based on the Boeing 747-8I and designated VC-25B, have been ordered by the USAF to replace the aging VC-25As.

==Development==
By 1985, the pair of Boeing 707-based VC-137s used as the presidential aircraft had been in service for 23 and 13 years respectively, and the USAF began searching for an eventual replacement. The Request for Proposal issued stated that the aircraft to be selected should have at least three engines and an unrefueled range of at least . Both Boeing with its 747 and McDonnell Douglas with the DC-10 were in competition to be selected, with the Boeing entry the eventual winner. The fabrication of the current 747s began during the presidency of Ronald Reagan (1981–1989).

The VC-25s were completed in 1986 and first flew in 1987. The interior designs were created by First Lady Nancy Reagan, who used designs reminiscent of the American Southwest. Problems with interior wiring for communication systems delayed delivery of the two aircraft until 1990, during the administration of George H. W. Bush.

The Air Force reported that the operating cost for each VC-25A in 2014 was $210,877 (~$ in ) per hour.

==Design and configuration==


The VC-25 is capable of flying 7,800 miles (12,600 km)—roughly one-third the distance around the world—without refueling. The VC-25A can accommodate more than 70 passengers. Each VC-25A cost approximately $325 million. While the VC-25 has two main decks and a cargo area, like a regular Boeing 747, its 4,000 square feet (370 m2) of floor space has been reconfigured for presidential duties. Its lowest level is mostly cargo space, carrying luggage and the onboard food supply. The main passenger area is on the second floor or main deck. The upper deck contains the cockpit and the communications center.

Typically, the president boards and disembarks from the front, main deck entrance using a mobile stairway, while journalists and other passengers enter at the rear door of the main deck. However, the aircraft also has built-in airstairs that lead to the lower deck, typically used when security concerns make the use of a mobile stairway impractical.

===The &quot;White House&quot;===
The front section of the aircraft is informally called the &quot;White House&quot;, a reference to the president&#x27;s official residence in Washington, D.C. The president&#x27;s executive suite includes sleeping quarters with two couches that can be converted into beds, lavatory and shower, vanity, double sink, and a private office, or the president&#x27;s &quot;Oval Office aboard Air Force One&quot;. If necessary, the president can address the nation from the office. This capability was added after the September 11 attacks, during which the aircraft had to land at Barksdale Air Force Base for President George W. Bush to address the nation. These offices, including the president&#x27;s suite, are mostly located on the starboard (right) side, and a long corridor runs along the port (left) side. The aircraft also contains a conference room, originally designed as a situation room, but now used for meeting with staff while traveling. This room includes a 50-inch plasma screen television which can be used for teleconferencing. The aircraft has fully equipped office areas with telecommunication systems (including 87 telephones and 19 televisions).

On board the VC-25 is a medical annex, which includes a fold-out operating table, emergency medical supplies, and a well-stocked pharmacy. George W. Bush had a treadmill added to Air Force One during his term in office. Every flight is staffed by a doctor and nurse. The aircraft is self-sufficient, such as carrying all the food it will need. Meals are prepared in two galleys, which together are equipped to feed up to 100 people at a time. The president gets a personal menu. An area where guests sit is near the center of the aircraft, outside the &quot;White House&quot;.

There are separate quarters for guests, senior staff, Secret Service and Air Force security personnel assigned to the plane, and the news media located in the aft area of the main deck. Protocol states that one may wander aft of one&#x27;s assigned seat, but not forward of it. Communications equipment and the cockpit are on the upper deck. There are also secure and non-secure voice, fax and data communications facilities. While the aircraft&#x27;s luggage capacity is adequate to carry the belongings of the passengers, the logistics train of the president means that the aircraft must fly preceded by an aerial convoy of several cargo transports, which carry the helicopters, motorcade vehicles, and other equipment required by the presidential entourage.

==Operational history==

===VC-25A===
The VC-25A replaced the VC-137C (a military version of the Boeing 707) as the mainstay of the &quot;Air Force One&quot; fleet. On some occasions, the VC-25s serve as transport for the US vice president, for which service they use the &quot;Air Force Two&quot; call sign. The VC-25A aircraft are maintained and operated as military operations by the Presidential Airlift Group, part of Air Mobility Command&#x27;s 89th Airlift Wing, based at Joint Base Andrews in Camp Springs, Maryland.

The aircraft can also be operated as a military command center in the event of an incident such as a nuclear attack. Operational modifications include aerial refueling capability and countermeasures against anti-aircraft missiles. The electronics on board are connected with approximately 238 miles (383 km) of wiring, twice that of a regular 747. All wiring is covered with heavy shielding for protection from a nuclear electromagnetic pulse in the event of a nuclear attack. The aircraft also has electronic countermeasures (ECMs) (AN/ALQ-204 Matador) to jam enemy radar, flares to spoof heat-seeking missiles, and chaff to spoof radar-guided missiles. All small arms and ammunition stores not in the physical possession of the Secret Service and Air Force security personnel on board the VC-25s are stowed and secured in separate locked compartments, each with a different locking mechanism for added security. Many of the VC-25&#x27;s other capabilities are classified for security reasons.

There has been at least one instance of a VC-25A carrying the president of the United States without using the Air Force One call sign, when President George W. Bush went on a secret flight (with the &quot;Gulf Stream Five&quot; call sign) to meet with troops in Iraq on Thanksgiving, on 27 November 2003.

After a presidential inauguration resulting in a change in office, the outgoing president is provided transport on a VC-25 aircraft to their home destination. The aircraft for this flight does not use the Air Force One call sign because it is not carrying the president in office. For both Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, the flight was known as &quot;Special Air Mission 28000&quot;, where the number represents the aircraft&#x27;s tail number.

The VC-25As have also been used to transport deceased former presidents, as the guest area aft of &quot;the White House&quot; has chairs and tables that can be removed and the casket laid in their place. The bodies of Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush, and Jimmy Carter were transported to Washington for their state funerals, and then on to their final resting places. Colonel Mark Tillman, pilot for President George W. Bush, said, &quot;We&#x27;ll take care of the president from basically when he&#x27;s in office to when he lays in state.&quot; For the funeral of President Ronald Reagan in 2004, Tillman said that the crew converted the front of the aircraft to look the way it would have appeared when Reagan was president; President and Nancy Reagan&#x27;s Air Force One jackets were placed on the chairs to &quot;make them feel at home&quot;. A specially designed hydraulic lifter (similar to the type used by airline catering) with the presidential seal affixed to the sides lifts the casket up to the portside aft door to enter the VC-25A. The tradition of placing the caskets in the passenger cabin dates back to the assassination of John F. Kennedy, when the crew did not want the president&#x27;s body placed in the cargo hold, and again during the state funeral of Lyndon B. Johnson.

According to an April 2024 report, the two VC-25As are slated for retirement in fiscal year 2028 and 2029, respectively.

===VC-25B===
The VC-25A aircraft are aging and have become less cost-effective to operate. The USAF Air Mobility Command investigated possible replacements, with early press coverage suggesting that the USAF would consider the Boeing 747-8 and the Airbus A380. On 7 January 2009, Air Force Materiel Command issued a new Sources Sought notice for a replacement aircraft to enter service by 2017 with an additional two aircraft to follow in 2019 and 2021. On 28 January 2009, EADS North America representing EADS and its Airbus division confirmed it would not respond to the US Air Force notice, as assembling only three airplanes in the US would not make financial sense. This made Boeing the only aircraft manufacturer interested in supplying the replacement aircraft, and was reported to be exploring a 787 option also. On 28 January 2015, the Air Force announced the selection of the Boeing 747-8 to replace the aging VC-25A for presidential transport.

On 10 May 2016, the Air Force posted online an amendment to its Air Force One contract authorizing Boeing to begin preliminary design activities. This version of the contract synopsis confirmed that the government will buy two modified 747-8 aircraft. Boeing was awarded a contract in January 2016 to identify cost reduction opportunities in areas including maintenance, aerial refueling and communications. On 15 July 2016, Boeing received another contract for pre-engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) risk-reduction to address &quot;system specification, the environmental control system, the aircraft interior, the electrical and power system and sustainment and maintenance approaches&quot; to reduce development risks and life-cycle costs.
On 1 August 2017, &quot;Defense One&quot; reported that in an effort to pay less for the replacement program, the USAF entered into a contract to purchase two 747-8 Intercontinental (747-8I) jets from Boeing, which had originally been ordered in 2011 by Transaero, a Russian airline. Before they could be delivered, Transaero filed for bankruptcy and was closed down; the two aircraft were stored at Southern California Logistics Airport in the Mojave Desert to prevent corrosion. On 27 February 2018, the White House announced a US$3.9 billion (~$ in ) agreement with Boeing to modify the two unsold 747-8s to replace the VC-25As. The new aircraft is to be designated VC-25B. These aircraft are to be retrofitted with telecommunications and security equipment to bring them to the required security level for the presidential aircraft. In April 2022, Boeing&#x27;s CEO Dave Calhoun revealed that he expects the company to have a loss of $660 million on the VC-25B program, after the contract was renegotiated by President Trump.

In June 2019, President Trump announced his plans to revamp the VC-25&#x27;s livery from the traditional Robin egg blue (called &quot;luminous ultramarine&quot;) white and silver shades to one of red, white, and blue. This would have been the first deviation from the Raymond Loewy livery scheme since it was introduced in 1962 on the VC-137C which was first used as Air Force One during the Kennedy administration. The Biden administration abandoned the new design, citing &quot;additional engineering, as well as increased time and cost.&quot; A modified version of the traditional scheme was announced in March 2023.

The 747s began undergoing modification work at Boeing&#x27;s San Antonio facility in 2020. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, the development process has been hit by multiple &quot;production mishaps&quot;, including the discovery of empty tequila mini-bottles on one of the aircraft, and the use of jacks that were not rated to support the weight of the aircraft. While the jacking did not result in damage to the planes, &quot;the Pentagon&#x27;s contractor-management agency formally requested Boeing improve its operations.&quot;

While the initial delivery date was set to 2024, the Pentagon expects the jets to be two to three years late, with the Air Force projecting delivery of the first VC-25B in 2027, and the other in 2028, as of a 2023 press release. Once the new aircraft are delivered, the VC-25As will be retired and placed in museums.

<doc id="581262" wikidata="Q6237663" url="?curid=581262" title="John Hansen (footballer, born 1950)">
<text>John Angus McDonald Hansen (born 3 February 1950) is a Scottish former footballer who played professionally solely for Partick Thistle as a defender.

==Club career==
The older brother of the more noted player Alan Hansen (who also began his career with Partick Thistle), John played as a right-back or centre-half. He attended a rugby-playing school (Alloa Academy) and only began to play football as a teenager, joining local club Sauchie Juniors before being brought to Firhill.

Hansen was part of the Thistle team that was relegated in 1970, promoted as lower division winners in 1971 and then defeated Celtic 4–1 in the 1971 Scottish League Cup Final. Between 1967 and 1978 he played 213 league games, scoring 6 goals in the process. He played alongside his younger brother for four seasons, during which the club were relegated in a league restructure in 1975 but bounced back as second-tier champions again in 1976 and finished fifth in the 1976–77 Scottish Premier Division.

Persistent knee injuries dogged his career; with various operations on his cartilage and cruciate ligament ending the possibility of a move to Manchester United, whilst also robbing him of the chance to compete in Europe following the League Cup win—eventually forcing his retirement from playing, aged just 27.

==International career==
Hansen won two caps for Scotland under manager Tommy Docherty, playing against Belgium in a 1–0 victory in a European Championship Qualifier, and against Yugoslavia in a 2–2 draw in the Brazilian Independence Cup.

==Later life==
Following his retirement as a player, Hansen spent some time working for Partick Thistle as the club&#x27;s public relations officer. He is married to Sandra Ann and now lives in Surrey with his son Simon.

<text>Quincy David Epperly (March 3, 1913 – January 7, 2001) was an American race car builder. He was known for constructing roadsters in the &#x27;lay down&#x27; style first pioneered by George Salih.

== Biography ==

Epperly was born in Floyd, Virginia, to John Wesley and Iowa Texas Epperly. After completing a correspondence course in &quot;Theory of Aircraft Construction&quot;, Epperly moved to Southern California in 1940 to work for Lockheed and Pacific Airmotive. During the Second World War, he joined the Coast Guard Reserve to spend evenings after work on watch at the Wilmington Coast Guard Patrol Base. 

=== Indy car racing ===

In the late 1940s, Epperly went to work for Frank Kurtis building racing car bodies; this led to a lifelong career in the racing business.

During the mid-1950s Epperly opened his own shop in Lawndale, California, and in 1957 he assisted chassis designer George Salih in the construction of a radical approach in racing car design which placed a four-cylinder Offenhauser engine on its side, rather than in the upright position, as was the usual custom for the Indianapolis roadsters of that era. Called the &quot;lay down Offy,&quot; it allowed for better high-speed aerodynamics and oval-track weight distribution.

Salih had expended almost all of his finances in designing and constructing the chassis framework. In exchange for a large discount on fabricating the bodywork for Salih&#x27;s design, Epperly was allowed to construct and sell his own variants of the lay-down design. While Salih would only have two chassis built to his designs, Epperly&#x27;s lay-down chassis would be common at Indianapolis from 1958 onwards.

Epperly&#x27;s cars competed in five FIA World Championship races - the , , , and Indianapolis 500; he performed bodywork on the race winner in 1957 and 1958.

=== Drag racing ===

Epperly also built the body for the first &quot;Spirit of America&quot; land speed racer, out of his shop in Gardena, California. 

Epperly worked with Nye Frank and Craig Breedlove on the dragster &quot;Spirit II&quot; in 1964, and with Frank on the &quot;Flying Wedge&quot; streamliner dragster built for Don Prudhomme in 1971.

== Later work ==

A notable restoration by Epperly was the engine for the Cooper Type 54-Climax, which, in the hands of Jack Brabham, began the &quot;rear engine revolution&quot; at Indianapolis. The restoration earned the car the coveted Monterey Cup at the 1991 Monterey Historic races, when, driven again by Brabham, it performed perfectly. It later traveled to the Festival of Speed at Goodwood in 1993, to Australia in 1995 for the CART Surfer&#x27;s Paradise race, to Michigan International Raceway in 1996 for the U.S. 500 (where demonstration laps at around 140 mph were made), and to the California Speedway in 1997 for the Marlboro 500. 

His last major project was to complete the body restoration of his own &quot;Demler Special&quot; #99 in 1998. The Demler had finished second in the 1958 Indianapolis 500.

<doc id="581290" wikidata="Q7369892" url="?curid=581290" title="Rosslyn station">
<text>Rosslyn station is the westernmost station on the shared segment of the Blue, Orange, and Silver lines of the Washington Metro. It is located in the Rosslyn neighborhood of Arlington County, Virginia. Rosslyn is the first station in Virginia heading westward from Washington, D.C. on the Orange and Silver Lines and southward on the Blue Line. It is one of four interchange points on the Metrorail system west of the Potomac River and located in a growing business district.

Averaging 5,941 daily tapped entries in 2023, Rosslyn is the 11th-busiest station in the Metro system and the busiest station located outside of Washington, D.C. Rosslyn is the biggest choke point of the Metro system. Due to this, planners are considering adding another station in the Rosslyn neighborhood, possibly as part of an inner loop through Washington and Arlington.

== Station layout ==

The station has entrances on the west side of North Moore Street between Wilson Boulevard and 19th Street North and on the east side of Fort Myer Drive between Wilson Boulevard and 19th Street North. A bank of three high-speed street elevators to the mezzanine (upper) level of the station is on the east side of North Moore Street, across the street from the station entrance. The station was historically a stop for several express Metrobus lines, including the now-discontinued D.C.–Dulles Line (route 5A).

Rosslyn is one of two stations (the other being the Pentagon station) at which trains going one direction are boarded on a different station level than trains going the other direction, as a way to prevent an at-grade crossing. This is because the Orange/Silver and Blue lines split apart an extremely short distance from the station. This ensures that no trains traveling in opposite directions share a track. An indicator sign at the south end of the station flashes to inform passengers of the arriving train&#x27;s destination, showing Orange for , Blue for , and Silver for . This feature is only used at final transfer stations; another example being .

Rosslyn is the deepest station on the three lines servicing it. The mezzanine and upper platform are below the Fort Myer Drive street-level entrance; the lower platform is below the entrance. This is because its neighborhood is on a bluff over the Potomac River, while its shared rail line into Washington passes through a rock-bored tunnel up to beneath the river surface. The station&#x27;s depth also takes advantage of the strength and watertightness of the bedrock below the surface. An escalator ride between the street and mezzanine levels takes about three minutes.

It is one of nine stations on the Metro with platform-level fare gates and elevators (the other eight being the , Ballston–MU station, , , , (eastbound only), , and stations). The separate accessible entrance and general entrances are a relative rarity in the Washington Metro system; only and stations share this feature. The underground hallway to the new elevator bank contains a four-coffered arch like most underground stops on the Red Line that were opened after 1980. This is the only stop on the Blue, Orange, and Silver Lines with this arch. It is also the only stop in the system that contains both the waffle and four-coffer arch design.

==History==
The station opened on July 1, 1977.
