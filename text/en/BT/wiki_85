<text>In mathematics, singularity theory studies spaces that are almost manifolds, but not quite. A string can serve as an example of a one-dimensional manifold, if one neglects its thickness. A singularity can be made by balling it up, dropping it on the floor, and flattening it. In some places the flat string will cross itself in an approximate &quot;X&quot; shape. The points on the floor where it does this are one kind of singularity, the double point: one bit of the floor corresponds to more than one bit of string. Perhaps the string will also touch itself without crossing, like an underlined &quot;U&quot;. This is another kind of singularity. Unlike the double point, it is not &quot;stable&quot;, in the sense that a small push will lift the bottom of the &quot;U&quot; away from the &quot;underline&quot;.

Vladimir Arnold defines the main goal of singularity theory as describing how objects depend on parameters, particularly in cases where the properties undergo sudden change under a small variation of the parameters. These situations are called perestroika (), bifurcations or catastrophes. Classifying the types of changes and characterizing sets of parameters which give rise to these changes are some of the main mathematical goals. Singularities can occur in a wide range of mathematical objects, from matrices depending on parameters to wavefronts.

==How singularities may arise==
In singularity theory the general phenomenon of points and sets of singularities is studied, as part of the concept that manifolds (spaces without singularities) may acquire special, singular points by a number of routes. Projection is one way, very obvious in visual terms when three-dimensional objects are projected into two dimensions (for example in one of our eyes); in looking at classical statuary the folds of drapery are amongst the most obvious features. Singularities of this kind include caustics, very familiar as the light patterns at the bottom of a swimming pool.

Other ways in which singularities occur is by degeneration of manifold structure. The presence of symmetry can be good cause to consider orbifolds, which are manifolds that have acquired &quot;corners&quot; in a process of folding up, resembling the creasing of a table napkin.

==Singularities in algebraic geometry==
===Algebraic curve singularities===


Historically, singularities were first noticed in the study of algebraic curves. The &quot;double point&quot; at (0, 0) of the curve

:formula_1

and the cusp there of

:formula_2

are qualitatively different, as is seen just by sketching. Isaac Newton carried out a detailed study of all cubic curves, the general family to which these examples belong. It was noticed in the formulation of Bézout&#x27;s theorem that such &quot;singular points&quot; must be counted with multiplicity (2 for a double point, 3 for a cusp), in accounting for intersections of curves.

It was then a short step to define the general notion of a singular point of an algebraic variety; that is, to allow higher dimensions.

===The general position of singularities in algebraic geometry===
Such singularities in algebraic geometry are the easiest in principle to study, since they are defined by polynomial equations and therefore in terms of a coordinate system. One can say that the &quot;extrinsic&quot; meaning of a singular point isn&#x27;t in question; it is just that in &quot;intrinsic&quot; terms the coordinates in the ambient space don&#x27;t straightforwardly translate the geometry of the algebraic variety at the point. Intensive studies of such singularities led in the end to Heisuke Hironaka&#x27;s fundamental theorem on resolution of singularities (in birational geometry in characteristic 0). This means that the simple process of &quot;lifting&quot; a piece of string off itself, by the &quot;obvious&quot; use of the cross-over at a double point, is not essentially misleading: all the singularities of algebraic geometry can be recovered as some sort of very general &quot;collapse&quot; (through multiple processes). This result is often implicitly used to extend affine geometry to projective geometry: it is entirely typical for an affine variety to acquire singular points on the hyperplane at infinity, when its closure in projective space is taken. Resolution says that such singularities can be handled rather as a (complicated) sort of compactification, ending up with a &quot;compact&quot; manifold (for the strong topology, rather than the Zariski topology, that is).

==The smooth theory and catastrophes==
At about the same time as Hironaka&#x27;s work, the catastrophe theory of René Thom was receiving a great deal of attention. This is another branch of singularity theory, based on earlier work of Hassler Whitney on critical points. Roughly speaking, a &quot;critical point&quot; of a smooth function is where the level set develops a singular point in the geometric sense. This theory deals with differentiable functions in general, rather than just polynomials. To compensate, only the &quot;stable&quot; phenomena are considered. One can argue that in nature, anything destroyed by tiny changes is not going to be observed; the visible &quot;is&quot; the stable. Whitney had shown that in low numbers of variables the stable structure of critical points is very restricted, in local terms. Thom built on this, and his own earlier work, to create a &quot;catastrophe theory&quot; supposed to account for discontinuous change in nature.

===Arnold&#x27;s view===
While Thom was an eminent mathematician, the subsequent fashionable nature of elementary catastrophe theory as propagated by Christopher Zeeman caused a reaction, in particular on the part of Vladimir Arnold. He may have been largely responsible for applying the term singularity theory to the area including the input from algebraic geometry, as well as that flowing from the work of Whitney, Thom and other authors. He wrote in terms making clear his distaste for the too-publicised emphasis on a small part of the territory. The foundational work on smooth singularities is formulated as the construction of equivalence relations on singular points, and germs. Technically this involves group actions of Lie groups on spaces of jets; in less abstract terms Taylor series are examined up to change of variable, pinning down singularities with enough derivatives. Applications, according to Arnold, are to be seen in symplectic geometry, as the geometric form of classical mechanics.

===Duality===
An important reason why singularities cause problems in mathematics is that, with a failure of manifold structure, the invocation of Poincaré duality is also disallowed. A major advance was the introduction of intersection cohomology, which arose initially from attempts to restore duality by use of strata. Numerous connections and applications stemmed from the original idea, for example the concept of perverse sheaf in homological algebra.

==Other possible meanings==
The theory mentioned above does not directly relate to the concept of mathematical singularity as a value at which a function is not defined. For that, see for example isolated singularity, essential singularity, removable singularity. The monodromy theory of differential equations, in the complex domain, around singularities, does however come into relation with the geometric theory. Roughly speaking, &quot;monodromy&quot; studies the way a covering map can degenerate, while &quot;singularity theory&quot; studies the way a &quot;manifold&quot; can degenerate; and these fields are linked.

<text>Outokumpu Oyj is a group of international companies headquartered in Helsinki, Finland, with 10,600 employees in more than 30 countries. Outokumpu is the largest producer of stainless steel in Europe and the second largest producer in the Americas. Outokumpu also has a long history as a mining company, and still mines chromium ore in Keminmaa for use as ferrochrome in stainless steel.
The largest shareholder of Outokumpu is the Government of Finland, with 26.6% ownership, including the shares controlled by Solidium, The Social Insurance Institution of Finland, Finnish State Pension Fund and Municipality Pension Agency.

== Company history ==
In 1908, a large deposit of copper ore was discovered in Outokumpu, in Northern Karelia. Outokumpu was established to develop the now-exhausted mine. In the 1940s, Outokumpu developed the flash smelting process for smelting copper.

From 1986 to 1988 Outokumpu participated in a stainless steel cartel; it was caught in 1990, but not fined.
From 1988 to 2001 Outokumpu and the Swedish company Boliden participated in a cartel for copper tubing in the European market.

In 2001 &quot;Avesta Sheffield&quot;—which was formed from a 1991 merger of &quot;British Steel Stainless&quot; with the Swedish firm &quot;Avesta&quot; (as in Avesta Municipality)—merged with Outokumpu, forming the third-largest stainless steel producing company in the world at the time. The new company named &quot;AvestaPolarit&quot;, headquartered in Stockholm, was jointly owned by Outokumpu and the Corus Group of Swedish institutional investors.

In September 2001, Outokumpu&#x27;s plant construction branch Outokumpu Technology bought the German Lurgi Metallurgie in Frankfurt.
In December 2003 and September 2004, the EC fined Outokumpu €36.14 million for its copper tubing cartel activity. 
In 2004, Outokumpu bought the shares owned by Corus, so AvestaPolarit became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Outokumpu Group, delisted from the Helsinki and Stockholm stock exchanges, and only Outokumpu remained, headquartered in Espoo.

In 2005, Outokumpu sold its copper branch, Outokumpu Copper, except for the copper tube and brass division, which as of 2011, is a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Materials known as Luvata International, and Outokumpus zinc branch merged with the Swedish company Boliden. At the same time Outokumpu sold all Boliden shares. 
In June 2006, Outokumpu Technology was spun off as a separate company, renamed Outotec in April 2007.
On 31 March 2008, the cold rolling mill in Sheffield was closed in a company-wide 10% fixed cost reduction plan. The melt shop in Sheffield continues producing material for long steel products. In April 2008 OTK exited the copper business by selling its remaining copper tube and brass division to Cupori Group Oy.

On 31 January 2012, Outokumpu announced it would buy Inoxum, the stainless steel division of German ThyssenKrupp, for 2.7 billion euros. At the time, Finnish state capital controlled 40% of Outokumpu.

In November 2012, the European Commission found this acquisition would have created an EU market dominance for cold-rolled stainless steel flat products with Outokumpu market share above 50%. The EC cleared the merger on the condition that the Italian Inoxum subsidiary Acciai Speciali Terni (AST) was excluded from the deal, and OTK acquired Inoxum in December 2012. Through Inoxum, Outokumpu acquired stainless steel mills in China, Mexico, Bochum, Germany, Werdohl, Germany, and in Calvert, Alabama, USA.

On 30 November 2013, Outokumpu announced it would sell AST, certain service centers and the VDM Metals business to Thyssen Krupp, and in turn, ThyssenKrupp would sell its 29.9% shares in Outokumpu, and sever all other &quot;relevant links&quot; between the two companies. At the same time, on 30 November 2013, Thyssen Krupp announced the same: that it would reacquire AST and other so-called &#x27;remedy assets&#x27; as well as VDM (high-performance alloys) from Outokumpu, that it would sell its 29.9% shares in Outokumpu, and sever all other &quot;relevant links&quot; between the two companies.

In February 2014, the EC cleared the AST and VDM acquisition by ThyssenKrupp.

In July 2014, Outokumpu agreed to settle with Boliden and engineering group IMI, who had sued Outokumpu in 2012 to cover Boliden&#x27;s losses from the lawsuit over price-fixing of copper tubing.

In October 2015, Outokumpu announced the divestment of 55% shares in its Shanghai-based joint venture between Outokumpu (60%) and Baosteel (40%), Shanghai Krupp Stainless (SKS), to Chinese real-estate investment fund Lujiazui International Trust Co. Ltd. In a second step, Outokumpu divested the remaining 5% of its holdings in February 2016 to the same investor. In total Outokumpu recorded a non-recurring capital gain of EUR 389 million (net of taxes and debt repayment) for the sale of the entire 60% share in SKS. At the same time, the Board of Directors of SKS decided to stop the operations of SKS and release the workforce.

In March 2017, employing 100 people, the company opened its global service center in Vilnius, Lithuania.

In April 2020, Outokumpu named former Posti CEO Heikki Malinen as the next chief executive of the company.

In July 2024, Outokumpu appointed Kati ter Horst as the next president and chief executive of the company. Kati assumed office in October 2024.

== Production sites ==
=== Finland ===
Outokumpu&#x27;s largest production facilities are the integrated steel mills of the Tornio Works, in the small Finnish town Tornio on the coast of Gulf of Bothnia. Tornio Works produces hot rolled and cold rolled coils and sheets cut from coil, with an annual output of one million tonnes. The site consists of ferrochrome smelting, two steel-melting shops, a hot rolling mill and two cold rolling mills. The steel works were built in 1975–1976. The first stainless cast was made in May 1976, week 19, thus it has got the heat number 61901.The main marketing area is the EU. Up to 85% of the products are exported all around the world.

Kemi mine in Keminmaa near Tornio provides chromite, the raw material for chrome, needed to make stainless steel. In 2012, the quantity of chromite was estimated to a depth of one kilometer, totalling some 105 million tonnes.

=== Sweden ===
Avesta Sheffield was acquired 2001 and consists of a stainless steel mill with melting shop, hot rolling for heavy plates, hot rolling for 2000 mm width coils by Steckel mill and cold rolling mills. Avesta developed special stainless steel grades, high-alloy austenitic and duplex grades, optimized for good formability, weldability and high corrosion resistance.
Avesta has a long history in steelmaking, as does Sheffield in the UK where stainless steel was invented.

Thin Strip Nyby (see also Nyby bruk) produces cold rolled stainless steel, concentrating on special grades, part of the Special Coil business line. Nyby Ironworks in Torshälla was founded in 1829 by Adolf Zethelius, but ironworking on the site is first documented in the 15th century when the Bishop of nearby Strängnäs founded hammer forges by the waterfall near Nyby.

The Degerfors Long Products steelworks was owned in 2021 by the Outokumpu conglomerate.

=== United Kingdom ===
After the Avesta Sheffield acquisition, Outokumpu owned the Sheffield facility in the UK includes a melt shop, continuous casting, a bar finishing facility and rod mill which are part of Outokumpu&#x27;s Long Products business, also a stocking, processing and distribution center. Production includes stainless steel in coil, plate, sheet, coiled rod, bar and rebar forms; semi-finished products including slab, bloom, billet and ingot are also manufactured.

Outokumpu&#x27;s UK acquisitions derived from the works created in 1950 as a joint venture between Firth Vickers (see Firth and Vickers) and Samuel Fox and Company for cold rolling stainless steel, established at Shepcote Lane, Sheffield, originally manufactured under the Staybrite brand. In 1967 the industry was nationalized into the British Steel Corporation. Outokumpu&#x27;s original three sites in the UK were in Sheffield, Stocksbridge, and Blackburn.

In 2005 the cold rolling and finishing units, Coil Products Sheffield on Shepcote Lane were closed, with the loss of over 600 jobs. Production ceased in the first half of 2006. The company continued the melting shop, special strip cold rolling and finishing, bar rolling, and UK distribution. At the end of March 2008 the Stocksbridge site production ceased after 80 years, with work transferring to its Meadowhall site.

In 2023, Outokumpu divested its Long Products business, including the melting, rod and bar operations in Sheffield, UK, to Marcegaglia. Outokumpu retains service center and sales company in Sheffield.

=== Germany ===
As of 2018 there are production sites in Krefeld, Dillenburg and Dahlerbrück.

The Krefeld mill with 100 years of experience in stainless steel production, closed its melt shop in December 2012 and re-focused on cold rolling and R&amp;D. The nearby Benrath cold rolling mill in Düsseldorf was relocated and joined with Krefeld operations, to make a range of grades, dimensions and surface finishes. The Dahlerbrück cold rolling mill is located in Sauerland producing precision strip and looks back on a 300-year tradition of iron and steelmaking. The cold rolling mill in Dillenburg specializes on surface finishes for example in architecture, building and construction. The Bochum melt shop was closed in 2014.

=== U.S. and Mexico ===
Outokumpu has a melt shop and cold-rolling mill in Calvert, Alabama (purchased from ThyssenKrupp) and a cold rolling mill in San Luis Potosí (Mexico) which manufactures coil, strip, sheet, circles and plate.

== Organization ==
The company is led by a board of directors and a leadership team.

<doc id="581770" wikidata="Q2940504" url="?curid=581770" title="Distance transform">
<text>A distance transform, also known as distance map or distance field, is a derived representation of a digital image. The choice of the term depends on the point of view on the object in question: whether the initial image is transformed into another representation, or it is simply endowed with an additional map or field.

Distance fields can also be signed, in the case where it is important to distinguish whether the point is inside or outside of the shape.

The map labels each pixel of the image with the distance to the nearest &quot;obstacle pixel&quot;. A most common type of obstacle pixel is a &quot;boundary pixel&quot; in a binary image. See the image for an example of a Chebyshev distance transform on a binary image.

Usually the transform/map is qualified with the chosen metric. For example, one may speak of Manhattan distance transform, if the underlying metric is Manhattan distance. Common metrics are:
* Euclidean distance
* Taxicab geometry, also known as &quot;City block distance&quot; or &quot;Manhattan distance&quot;.
* Chebyshev distance

There are several algorithms to compute the distance transform for these different distance metrics, however the computation of the exact Euclidean distance transform (EEDT) needs special treatment if it is computed on the image grid. Recently, distance transform computation has also been proposed using a static Schrodinger&#x27;s equation. This particular approach has the benefit of obtaining an analytical closed-form solution to distance transforms, and of computing the average distance transform over a set of distance transforms, owing to the linearity of the Schrödinger equation. Further, this approach has also been leveraged to extend distance transforms to line-segments and curves.

Applications are digital image processing (e.g., blurring effects, skeletonizing), motion planning in robotics, medical-image analysis for prenatal genetic testing, and even pathfinding.

Uniformly-sampled signed distance fields have been used for GPU-accelerated font smoothing, for example by Valve researchers.

Signed distance fields can also be used for (3D) solid modelling. Rendering on typical GPU hardware requires conversion to polygon meshes, e.g. by the marching cubes algorithm.

<doc id="581773" wikidata="Q1002814" url="?curid=581773" title="Ford CVH engine">
<text>The Ford CVH engine is a straight-four automobile engine produced by the Ford Motor Company. The engine&#x27;s name is an acronym for either &quot;Compound Valve-angle Hemispherical&quot; or &quot;Canted Valve Hemispherical&quot;, where &quot;Hemispherical&quot; describes the shape of the combustion chamber. The CVH was introduced in 1980 in the third generation European Escort and in 1981 in the first generation North American Escort.

The CVH was produced in capacities from 1.1 to 2.0 L, with the smallest version offered exclusively in continental Europe, and the largest only in North America. Engines for North America were built in Ford&#x27;s Dearborn Engine plant, while engines for Europe and the UK were built in Ford&#x27;s then-new Bridgend Engine plant in Wales.

==History and Details==
The engine was originally conceived in 1974, and was a key plank of the &quot;Erika&quot; world car programme which spawned both the third-generation European Escort and the 1981 North American car of the same name. Although the European and North American Escorts ended up being substantially different from each other in execution, the CVH engine was the one major common part shared between them. The CVH largely replaced the overhead valve Kent (&quot;Crossflow&quot;) engine in Ford of Europe&#x27;s portfolio, although the &#x27;short block&#x27; Valencia version of the Kent remained in production for many decades (ironically outliving the CVH by two years) - positioned below the CVH as an entry level engine in the smallest capacity Fiesta and Escort models.

The CVH is a cam-in-head design, a type of overhead camshaft engine with a single camshaft mounted low in the head, operating two valves per cylinder via rocker arms. As indicated by the name, the valves in original versions are mounted at a compound angle in order to allow for a hemispherical combustion chamber, but without the need for dual camshafts (or an elaborate rocker system) which a &quot;hemi&quot; engine normally requires. The later &quot;lean burn&quot; versions of the engine launched in 1986 had reshaped combustion chambers to improve swirl, and were strictly speaking no longer hemi-headed at all. The CVH features hydraulic valve lifters, a first for a European Ford engine. In North America the engine was sold under different names, being called the &quot;1.9L SEFI&quot; from 1991 to 1996 in that market&#x27;s Ford Escort, the &quot;Split Port Induction 2000&quot; or SPI2000 from 1997 to 2002, while from 2000 to 2004 it was simply the &quot;Split Port&quot; when offered in the Ford Focus.

==1.1==
The 1.1 L CVH had the shortest production life of the different variants. Bore × stroke are , and displacement is . It debuted in the 1980 Escort MkIII for Continental Europe only, where it was offered as an alternative to the 1.1 L Valencia overhead valve (OHV) engine, which was the only 1.1 L engine offered in UK market Escorts. The 1.1 L CVH offered negligible improvements in economy or performance over the older Valencia unit, which was simpler and cheaper to manufacture, and hence was dropped in 1982.

Applications
* 1980–1981 Ford Escort Mk 3 (Continental Europe only)

==1.3==
The 1.3 L CVH was introduced in the 1980 European Escort and used in the Orion and Fiesta from 1983 to 1986. Bore and stroke are , for a displacement of . The 1.3 L was to be offered in the North American Escort, but testing found it to be unacceptably underpowered while Ford was unable to make it meet emissions requirements. US production plans were scrapped just months before full-scale production was scheduled to start.

For the facelifted fourth generation European Escort of 1986, this CVH was replaced by a 1.3 L Valencia engine in entry-level models, while higher trim level models used the 1.4 L CVH described below.

Applications
* 1980–1986 Ford Escort Mk 3
* 1983–1985 Ford Fiesta Mk 2
* 1983–1986 Ford Orion Mk 1

==1.4==

The 1.4 L CVH replaced the 1.3 L CVH in the Escort, Orion and Fiesta from early 1986. Bore and stroke are , and displacement is . In European trim, this engine produced .

Known as the &#x27;Lean Burn&#x27; engine, it was designed primarily for fuel economy and featured a different cylinder head than other CVH engines. The Ford variable venturi carburetor was replaced by a Weber 28/30 TLDM which used a manifold vacuum-actuated secondary choke instead of the more usual sequential linkage which opens the secondary butterfly at 3/4 to full throttle. The 1.4 L version is less responsive to power modification than other CVH engines, and some common tuning parts cannot be used.

In South Africa, the 1.4 L CVH was fitted to the Ford Laser and Meteor, which were rebadged Mazda Familias. It replaced the 1.3 L Mazda E engine used in these cars and was itself replaced by the 1.3 L Mazda B engine.

Applications
* 1986–1990 Ford Escort Mk 4
* 1990–2000 Ford Escort Mk 5
* 1986–1989 Ford Fiesta Mk 2
* 1989–1995 Ford Fiesta Mk 3
* 1986–1990 Ford Orion Mk 2
* 1990–1992 Ford Orion Mk 3

===CVH-PTE===
The CVH-PTE is a revised version of the 1.4 L CVH introduced on the European Ford Fiesta 1.4 Si and Ford Escort in 1994. It features multi-point injection and a thicker crankcase to reduce harshness at high revs. Through the 1990s it was gradually phased out in favour of the newer Zetec 16-valve unit.

==1.6==
The naturally aspirated (NA) 1.6 L CVH debuted in the 1980 European Escort and the 1981 North American Escort. Bore and stroke are and total displacement is .

=== European NA 1.6===
European versions produced with the Ford variable venturi carburetor, with the twin venturi 32/34 DFT Weber carburetor used in the Fiesta XR2 and the Escort XR3, with Bosch K-Jetronic injection, with KE-Jetronic mechanical fuel injection, and with electronic fuel injection (EFI) and a Ford EEC-IV engine control unit (ECU) as found in the XR3i or Orion GLSI. A version was offered in the Escort RS1600i, developed by Ford Motorsport Germany for FIA Group A homologation. This version featured a reworked cylinder head, solid cam followers and bronze bearings, and a host of other motorsport features.

European versions of the carbureted 1.6 L engine from the 1986 model year on were revised and, like the new 1.4 L, benefit from cylinder heads with a heart-shaped lean-burn combustion chambers and a slightly raised piston crown. The carburetor is a Weber twin venturi 28/32 TLDM unit. Power output is improved to with the benefit of improved torque and fuel economy. EFI versions used in the Escort XR3i, 1.6i and Fiesta XR2i retained hemispherical combustion chambers. From the 1989 model year all EFI variants are fitted with the Ford EEC-IV ECU.

Applications
* 1980–1986 Ford Escort Mk 3
* 1986–1990 Ford Escort Mk 4
* 1983–1989 Ford Fiesta Mk 2
* 1989–1992 Ford Fiesta Mk 3 (Replaced by Zetec from 1993 model year onward)
* 1988–1993 Ford Sierra
* 1983–1986 Ford Orion Mk 1
* 1986–1990 Ford Orion Mk 2
* 1990–1992 Ford Orion Mk 3
* 1990–1991 Ford Escort Mk 5 (Replaced by Zetec in 1992)
* 1989–1992 Ginetta G32
* 1982–1991 Morgan 4/4 1600

===Chinese NA 1.6===
Chery manufactured a 1.6 L CVH for use in their SEAT Toledo based vehicles. Chery purchased the production line for this engine in England, which was then transferred to Anhui. The first engines left the production line in May 1999. The engine is codenamed SQR480. Chery replaced the CVH with their own ACTECO engines.

Applications:
* 1999–2006 Chery A11

===North American NA 1.6===
Standard 1.6 L output started at and . The early North American engines are built with cast pistons and connecting rods, a low-flow version of the CVH head, flat hydraulic lifters, a 0.229&quot; lift camshaft, 32/32 Weber-licensed carburetor, cast exhaust manifold, and low-dome pistons. Over the years compression ratios ranged from 8.5:1–9.0:1, while power started at in 1981, rising to by 1985.

A 1.6 L High Output (HO) motor became available in late 1982 through 1985. Changes to it included a 4-2-1 header, higher-lift (0.240&quot;) camshaft, a 32/34 Weber carburetor, a dual-snorkel air-box, and high-dome pistons making 9.0:1–9.5:1 compression making in 1982 and in 1983–1985.

A 1.6 L EFI motor became an option in 1983 through 1985. It had all the features of the HO (Higher Output) motor but had a totally different intake system to allow for multi-point EFI running on Ford&#x27;s EEC-IV ECU. The 1.6 EFI shares the same head as the carbureted 1.6 found in North America but without a mechanical fuel pump. The 1.6 EFI engine was replaced by the 1.6 HO in all high-altitude regions, making the 1.6 EFI a rare model.

Applications
* 1981–1984 Ford Escort
* 1981–1984 Mercury Lynx
* 1982–1983 Mercury LN7
* 1982–1985 Ford EXP

==1.6 Turbo==

===European Turbo 1.6===
A turbocharged version of the 1.6 L was developed by Ford Europe for the RS Turbo Escort and the later Ford Fiesta RS Turbo. It makes at 6,000 rpm, and of torque at 3,000 rpm. The block is modified to provide an oil return from the turbocharger. Crankshaft and connecting rods are identical to the standard 1.6 L models, but the Mahle pistons are unique to the RS Turbo, and are manufactured using a pressure cast method which makes them considerably stronger and more expensive than the normal cast pistons. The compression ratio was reduced to 8.3:1, allowing the use of higher boost pressure. The engine only needs of boost to produce its quoted power output.

Applications
* 1980–1986 Ford Escort Mk 3
* 1986–1990 Ford Escort Mk 4
* 1989–1995 Ford Fiesta Mk 3

===North American Turbo 1.6===
The North American 1.6 turbocharged CVH was developed by Ford&#x27;s Special Vehicle Operations (SVO) with help from Jack Roush for 1984 and 1985 in the Ford EXP Turbo, Ford Escort GT Turbo, and Mercury Lynx RS Turbo. At , its output is 50% higher than the carbureted North American 1.6 L HO, making it the most powerful production CVH offered in North America while returning impressive fuel efficiency and without reducing the engine&#x27;s lifespan. The turbocharged engine featured a specially designed cam profile (0.240&quot;, comparable to the 1.6 HO and EFI camshafts), a Ford Performance/SVO modified head (comparable to European 1.6s), the EFI intake manifold, a unique cast exhaust manifold, low-dome pistons, and Ford&#x27;s top-of-the-line EFI and ECU. These engines only appeared in the 1984–1985 Ford Escort GT Turbo and 1984–1985 Ford EXP Turbo, of which only about 10,000 were made in total. The 1.6 turbocharged Fords came standard with a TRX package that included upgraded suspension and specialty Michelin tires.

Applications
* 1984–1985 Ford Escort
* 1984–1985 Mercury Lynx
* 1984–1985 Ford EXP

==1.8==
The 1.8 L CVH was only used in the European Ford Sierra. Bore is the same as the 1.6 L CVH, but a different crankshaft with a stroke of raises displacement to . The cylinder head is equipped with hydraulic roller camshaft followers to reduce noise.
Utilises an ESC Hybrid management system, and a Pierburg 2E3 carburettor or single point fuel injection on later models.

Applications
* 1989–1993 Ford Sierra (Replaced the Ford Pinto engine from 1989 model year onward)

==1.9==

The CVH was enlarged to 1.9 L for the 1986 model year North American Escort. Bore and stroke are . This stroke length was later used in the 2.0 L CVH engine, and again in the &quot;Zeta&quot; engine which replaced it. The long stroke necessitated a raised engine block deck, a design also shared with later units. All 1.9s from 1989 on are equipped with a roller camshaft and roller lifters. The camshaft and water pump are driven by the timing belt. This engine is a non-interference design. Output is and with a carburetor. In models with electronic single-point fuel injection (or throttle-body injection, called Central Fuel Injection (CFI) by Ford), an additional is produced, while torque is little changed.

Multi-point fuel injection and hemispherical combustion chambers are features of the 1986 Escort GT&#x27;s EFI HO engine, raising output to and .

The 1.9 L CFI engine of the late 1980s, particularly when equipped with either the four- or five-speed manual transaxle, was noted for delivering outstanding fuel economy. The four-speed Escort Pony models achieved better mileage than five-speed cars, with upwards of in city driving and on the highway not being uncommon.

The second generation American Escort received sequential electronic fuel injection (SEFI) for 1991–1996 (sharing the same head as the 1.9 CFI), but power and torque are little changed at and respectively.

Applications
* 1986–1996 Ford Escort
* 1985–1987 Mercury Lynx
* 1991–1996 Mercury Tracer
* 1986–1988 Ford EXP
* Gen 2 Spec Racer Ford

==2.0==
The 2.0 L was introduced in the 1997 North American Escort sedan and wagon as the SPI2000. Ford&#x27;s Split Port Induction (SPI) system is a form of variable-length intake manifold. In this system, the intake path to each intake valve is split into primary and secondary passages. The primary passage contains the injector for the cylinder, and introduces the air tangentially to the cylinder for maximum swirl. The secondary passage contains an intake manifold runner control (IMRC) deactivation valve which opens for high speed and wide-open throttle (WOT) situations to provide a minimally restricted path for additional air to maximize volumetric efficiency and power. With SPI this engine produces and . The additional displacement is achieved by boring the 1.9 L engine to . As with the 1.9, the water pump is driven by the timing belt. Like the 1.9 L, this engine is a non-interference design. It is the last CVH engine made, and production ended with the 2004 Ford Focus LX/SE sedan and wagons. These engines have &quot;2.0L Split Port&quot; in raised letters on the top of the valve cover.

Applications
* 1997–2002 Ford Escort
* 1997–1999 Mercury Tracer
* 2000–2004 Ford Focus Mk1 (North America)

==Common problems==
===Noise, vibration, harshness===
Throughout its 20-year production life, the CVH had a reputation for excessive noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH). Jeremy Clarkson said of the CVH-powered Escort that &quot;it was powered by engines so rough, even Moulinex wouldn&#x27;t use them&quot;. This harshness is mostly due to the cylinder head and valvetrain design. At at full lift, the valve springs in the CVH are considerably stiffer than is typical in other engines. The stiff springs are needed to overcome the weight of the rocker arms and hydraulic self-adjusting tappets used and thereby prevent valve float, which they do up to around 6700 rpm. The stiff valve springs add more friction and pressure to the already high-friction &quot;flat tappet&quot; design.

===Sludge===
The camshaft is oiled by small holes in the cylinder head casting next to the lifter bores. These holes are prone to blocking up with oil sludge if the engine is not serviced regularly, starving the camshaft of oil. The CVH is known for producing excessive sludge if the service schedule is ignored or if poor quality oil is used. The cause is the design of the crankcase ventilation circuit, which Ford revised several times over the engine&#x27;s lifetime but never completely cured. Due to this, camshaft and tappet wear problems are common. A worn camshaft can cause heavy clattering and ticking from the engine&#x27;s top end, especially at high engine speeds.

===Valve seat failure===
A common problem with later CVHs is their tendency to drop a valve seat, which happens most often in VIN number P engines. This can occur with no warning, even if the engine has been well maintained. In most cases, a seat drops on the number 4 cylinder, with the next most common being the number 2 cylinder. With the factory valve seats, the typical life of the 2.0 L SPI in a Focus is about , but a failure can happen as early as . When the valve seat drops out of the cylinder head, it falls into the cylinder and damages the cylinder wall, piston, and cylinder head. In some cases, the valve seat is drawn from its cylinder through the intake manifold into another cylinder, where it causes damage.

==Kits cars, limited production cars, tuners==
Apart from Ford&#x27;s own models, the CVH engine was used in a number of vehicles built by small volume manufacturers, and was offered as an option in some owner-assembled cars. Several companies also began supplying performance parts and complete engines for CVH owners in search of more power.

Small volume applications:
* 1984–1990 Reliant Scimitar SS1 — 1.3 L, 1.4 L, 1.6 L
* 1990–1992 Reliant Scimitar SST — 1.3 L, 1.4 L
* 1992–1993 Reliant Scimitar Sabre — 1.4 L
* 1982–1993 Morgan 4/4 — 1.6 L
* 1983–1989 Panther Kallista — 1.6 L

Kit car applications:
* Westfield Sportscars SE — 1.6 L
* Sylva Mojo and Mojo 2
* Stuart Taylor Mark 1.

Tuners:
* Burton Power.
* Specialised Engines.
* Ferriday Engineering.
* Norris Motorsport.

==Hybrid engines==
=== Schrick 16V ===
In 1982 the German company &quot;Dr. Schrick GmbH&quot;, later renamed &quot;AVL Schrick&quot;, developed a double overhead camshaft (DOHC) multi-valve cylinder head for the 1.6 L CVH block. Each of the two overhead camshafts is installed in a separate camshaft carrier that is attached to the main body of the cylinder head. Each carrier has its own cam cover. Fitted with an original RS1600i engine intake manifold, a tubular exhaust manifold, and modified ignition, prototype engines developed .

In contrast to cylinder head conversions produced for Ford by Cosworth, the Schrick cylinder head never went into series production. With the introduction of the multi-valve Zetec engine, Schrick stopped development.

=== ZVH/ZE-VH ===
The ZVH or ZE-VH engine mounts a CVH 8 valve cylinder head on a Zeta/Zetec engine block. This is possible because the cylinder bore spacing, locations of the water and oil passages, and the cylinder head bolts on these engines are identical. 

This combination of parts allowed the owner of a CVH-powered car to retain the cylinder head and associated parts from the original engine while substituting a stronger, large displacement engine block. Some builders have built ZVH engines that used the cylinder head, fuel injection system, ignition system, exhaust manifold, and turbocharger from the Escort RS combined with a Zetec block.

The engine&#x27;s name indicates a Zetec/CVH hybrid.

<text>National Novel Writing Month, often shortened to NaNoWriMo ( ), is a U.S.-based nonprofit organization that promotes creative writing around the world. Its flagship program is an annual, international creative writing event in which participants attempt to write a 50,000-word manuscript during the month of November. Well-known authors write &quot;pep-talks&quot; in order to motivate participants during the month. The website provides participants, called &quot;Wrimos&quot;, with tips for writer&#x27;s block, information on where local participants are meeting, and an online community of support. Focusing on the length of a work rather than the quality, writers are encouraged to finish their first draft quickly so it can be edited later at their discretion. The project started in July 1999 with 21 participants. In 2022, 413,295 people participated in the organization&#x27;s programs.

Writers wishing to participate first register on the project&#x27;s website, where they can post profiles and information about their novels, including synopses and excerpts. Regional volunteers called &quot;Municipal Liaisons&quot; help connect local writers, hold in-person and virtual writing events, and provide encouragement.

== History ==
Freelance writer Chris Baty started the project in July 1999 with 21 participants in the San Francisco Bay area. In 2000, it was moved to November &quot;to more fully take advantage of the miserable weather.&quot; and launched an official website, designed by a friend of Baty&#x27;s. That year 140 participants signed up for the event, including several from other countries. Baty launched a Yahoo! group to facilitate socialization between participants and, after the posters began asking about guidelines, he set most of the event&#x27;s basic ground rules: the novel must be new, cannot be co-authored, and must be submitted in time to be verified. Of the 140 participants, 29 completed the challenge as manually verified by Baty himself.

The following year, Baty expected similar numbers, but 5,000 participants registered, which he credits to news of the event being spread by bloggers and later being reported on by various news organizations including the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;Washington Post&quot;. Though Baty was happy with the large turnout and popularity of the event, it almost did not happen, as the website had a number of problems leading to participants being asked to post themselves as winners on an honor system; in the end, 700 people would do so.

2002 saw technical improvements and increased automation to the site, and media attention from National Public Radio and CBS Evening News drew increased attention and a participant count of 14,000. The next year, the NaNoWriMo team began the Municipal Liaison program where volunteers could act as moderators in the forums as well as send out the first set of pep talk emails. Municipal Liaisons also acted as leaders for a specific region under their jurisdiction - organizing fundraisers and calling meetings for NaNoWriMo participants residing in their region. Baty also began work on his debut book &quot;No Plot? No Problem!&quot; during the 2003 NaNoWriMo, writing the NaNoWriMo guide concurrent with his own novel.

In 2005, NaNoWriMo was registered as a nonprofit organization due to the event growing strongly every year, which became the Office of Letters and Light.

In 2011, the NaNoWriMo website was given a new layout and forums. Baty announced that he would be stepping down as executive director in January 2012 to pursue a full-time writing career. Grant Faulkner took his position as executive director. The redesigned website moved from being based on Drupal to Ruby-on-Rails. During the first month after launch, the new website supported over 1,000,000 visitors and more than 39,000,000 pageviews.

By 2015, 431,626 people participated (633 different regions) in NaNoWriMo. Of those participants, more than 40,000 won.

In 2017, NaNoWriMo launched fundraising efforts to redesign the website again, raising $57,320. The new website was delayed, launching in 2019.

2024 saw several staffing changes and the appointment of former board president Kilby Blades as interim director. That year, the organization posted to their website an entry titled &quot;What is NaNoWriMo&#x27;s position on Artificial Intelligence (AI)?&quot;, in which they deemed the use of AI to be acceptable and stated &quot;the categorical condemnation of Artificial Intelligence has classist and ableist undertones&quot;. This stance generated controversy in the online community, with many on social media stating they were withdrawing support of or participation in the NaNoWriMo event. Some noted that makers of AI writing tools, such as ProWritingAid, were now among the sponsors for the event. Author Daniel José Older resigned from NaNoWriMo&#x27;s Writers&#x27; Board, and author Maureen Johnson from the Writers&#x27; Board of the Young Writers Program in response to this statement. NaNoWriMo also lost a sponsor, the writing collaboration platform Ellipsus, and &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; noted that FreeWrite had been removed from the sponsor page.

In response to the controversy, NaNoWriMo stated that their &quot;commentary on ableism and classism was relevant to the bullying dynamics we were seeing across our social channels&quot;. They further clarified that the original statement posted was not a complete representation of their stance on the topic. These subsequent statements failed to allay criticism.

== Rules ==
Since NaNoWriMo is used to get people writing, the rules are kept broad and straightforward:
# Writing starts at 12:00:00 a.m. on November 1 and ends 11:59:59 p.m. on November 30, local time.
# No one is allowed to start early and the challenge finishes exactly 30 days from that start point.
# Novels must reach a minimum of 50,000 words before the end of November in order to win. These words can either be a complete novel of 50,000 words or the first 50,000 words of a novel to be completed later.
# Planning and extensive notes are permitted, but no material written before the November 1 start date can go into the body of the novel.
# Participants&#x27; novels can be on any theme, genre of fiction, and language. Everything from fanfiction, which uses characters or settings from the published work of others, to novels in poem format, and metafiction is allowed; according to the website&#x27;s FAQ, &quot;If you believe you&#x27;re writing a novel, we believe you&#x27;re writing a novel too.&quot;

&quot;Rebelling&quot; (the act of writing something besides a novel such as non-fiction, video games, scripts, or academic writing) is allowed, as NaNoWriMo is considered a &quot;self-challenge&quot;; rebels are allowed to validate and thus receive any prizes from sponsors.

== Winning and prizes ==
To win NaNoWriMo, participants must write an average of 1,667 words per day (69 per hour, 1.2 per minute) in November to reach the goal of 50,000 words written toward a novel. Organizers of the event say that the aim is to get people to start writing, using the deadline as an incentive to get the story going and to put words to paper. There is no fee to participate in NaNoWriMo; registration is only required for novel verification.

No official prizes are awarded for length, quality, or speed, though self-awarded badges are available on the site. Anyone who reaches the 50,000-word mark is declared a winner. Beginning November 20, participants can submit their novel to be automatically verified for length and receive a printable certificate, an icon they can display on the web, and inclusion on the list of winners. No precautions are taken to prevent cheating; since the reward for winning is the finished novel itself and the satisfaction of having written it, there is little incentive to cheat. Novels are verified for word count by software, and may be scrambled or otherwise encrypted before being submitted for verification, although the software does not keep any other record of text input. It is possible to win without anyone other than the author ever seeing or reading the novel. Verification ended with the website redesign in 2019. Winning is now achieved by simply entering a word count of more than 50,000 words.

In October 2007, the self-publishing company CreateSpace teamed up with NaNoWriMo to begin offering winners a single free, paperback proof copy of their manuscripts, with the option to use the proof to then sell the novel on Amazon.com. In 2011, CreateSpace offered winners five free, paperback proof copies of their manuscripts. In addition to CreateSpace, each year NaNoWriMo has a new list of sponsors that reward winners and participants with various discounts and prizes. 2015 was the last year that CreateSpace partnered with NaNoWriMo.

===Controversial sponsors===
In 2022, NaNoWriMo partnered with Inkitt and Manuscript Press to offer special NaNoWriMo publishing packages for winners. Inkitt had a history of shifty business practices and unfriendly contract terms, and Manuscripts Press was known to charge large fees, promising that writers will recoup those fees in sales while not delivering on those promises. Users who questioned these sponsors were initially temporarily banned from the NaNoWriMo forums. Ultimately, NaNoWriMo staff agreed to sever their partnerships with Inkitt and Manuscript Press and update their vetting processes to prevent it from happening again.

== Community ==

=== Forums ===
The official forums provide a place for advice, information, criticism, support, and an opportunity for &quot;collective procrastination.&quot; The forums are available from the beginning of October, when signups for the year begin, until late September the following year, when they are archived and the database is wiped in preparation for that year&#x27;s NaNoWriMo forums to start up again.

Most regions have one or more Municipal Liaisons (ML) assigned to them, who are volunteers that help with organizing local events and mediate regional forums. MLs are encouraged to coordinate at least two kinds of meet-ups; a kickoff party, and a &quot;Thank God It&#x27;s Over&quot; party to celebrate successes and share novels. Kickoff parties are often held the weekend before November to give local writers a chance to meet and get geared up, although some are held on Halloween night past midnight so writers start writing in a community setting. Other events may be scheduled, including weekend meet-ups or overnight write-ins.

In response to community concerns about inappropriate behaviour and moderation on the forums, the board launched an investigation and placed the forums into read-only mode. The Board of Directors found that the NaNoWriMo&#x27;s staff had a history of overpromising and underdelivering as well as a lack of transparency/community accountability and too few people trying to do too much. Subsequently, there have been several staffing changes and the replacement of Grant Faulkner by former board of directors president Kim &quot;Kilby&quot; Blades as an interim director. The forums remain closed as of May 2024.

=== The Night of Writing Dangerously ===
In November 2007, NaNoWriMo hosted a fundraising Write-a-thon event called &quot;The Night of Writing Dangerously&quot;, held in San Francisco. The first 250 participants to donate at least $200 to the NaNoWriMo website received reservations at this annual event, at which participants met the organization&#x27;s staff, listened to speeches, chatted, ate, participated in raffles, and competed to see who could write the most at the event. In 2015, this fundraiser raised over $56,000. By 2016, the required donation amount to attend the event had risen to $300. 2018 was the last year in which the event was held, as the cost to put on the event rose and the funds raised by the event decreased.

== Programs ==

=== Laptop Loaners ===
Starting in 2002, NaNoWriMo ran a Laptop Loaner program for those without regular access to a computer or word processor. Functional used laptops were donated by NaNoWriMo participants, and borrowers were required to send a $300 deposit with proof of identity and cover the cost of return shipping.

In 2008, AlphaSmart, Inc. donated 25 Neo word processors.

In 2009 the Laptop Loaner program ended before that year&#x27;s NaNoWriMo event.

=== Young Writers Program ===
In 2004, NaNoWriMo started the Young Writers Program (YWP), a writing workshop aimed to aid classrooms of kindergarten through 12th-grade students. The difference between the regular program and the YWP was that kids could choose how many words to try to write. The word count goal for a young writer can range from a few thousand words, to the adult-standard 50,000, and even higher in some cases; a typical standard is around 30,000. In its inaugural year, the program was used in 150 classrooms and involved 4000 students. Teachers register their classroom for participation and are sent a starter kit of materials to use in the class which includes reward items like stickers and pencils. Lesson plans and writing ideas are also offered as resources to teachers, while students can communicate through the program&#x27;s forums. The only age restriction on the YWP is that, in most circumstances, no one can be over 18. When a user turns 18, they are sent to the main site; however, high school seniors who turn 18 during their senior year can remain in the program until graduation. YWP has their own forums which anyone from 13-17 can be on.

=== The Office of Letters and Light ===
In September 2006, NaNoWriMo officially became a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization operating under the name &quot;The Office of Letters and Light.&quot;

In 2004, NaNoWriMo partnered with child literacy non-profit Room to Read, and continued that partnership for three years. Fifty percent of net proceeds from 2004 to 2006 were used to build libraries in Southeast Asia; three were built in Cambodia, seven in Laos, and seven in Vietnam. The program was retired in 2007 to refocus resources on NaNoWriMo and the Young Writers Program.

=== Camp NaNoWriMo ===
A summer version of NaNoWriMo, called Camp NaNoWriMo, launched in 2011. Two sessions were held, one in July and one in August; however, the months were switched to June and August for Camp NaNoWriMo 2012. The two months were then switched to April and July for 2013 and 2014, and have stayed the same since. The rules used for the main event in November also applied to each Camp NaNoWriMo session.

There used to be a Camp NaNoWriMo website, but it was merged into the main NaNoWriMo site. The cabins were now made by making groups on the site, each with its own message board visible only by members of that cabin. Camp NaNoWriMo participants may choose their word count goal, similar to the Young Writers Program.

=== The &quot;Now What?&quot; Months ===
In 2013, January and February were deemed NaNoWriMo&#x27;s &quot;Now What?&quot; Months, designed to help novelists during the editing and revision process. To participate, writers commit to revisit their novels, signing a contract via NaNoWriMo, then attend Internet seminars where publishing experts and NaNoWriMo novelists are available to advise writers on the next steps for their draft. After that, participants communicate on Twitter to compare editing notes and interact with agents and publishers. Participants stay updated with NaNoWriMo&#x27;s blog where encouragement and advice are offered by authors, editors, and agents.

== Published NaNoWriMo novels ==

<text>Ian Richard Moss (born 20 March 1955) is an Australian rock musician from Alice Springs. He is the founding mainstay guitarist and occasional singer of Cold Chisel. In that group&#x27;s initial eleven year phase from 1973 to 1984, Moss was recorded on all five studio albums, three of which reached number one on the national Kent Music Report Albums Chart. In August 1989 he released his debut solo album, &quot;Matchbook&quot;, which peaked at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart. It was preceded by his debut single, &quot;Tucker&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, which reached number two on the related ARIA Singles Chart in March. The track was co-written by Moss with Don Walker, also from Cold Chisel. Moss had another top ten hit with &quot;Telephone Booth&quot; in June 1989.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 1990 Moss won five categories: Album of the Year, Best Male Artist, Breakthrough Artist – Album, Single of the Year and Breakthrough Artist – Single. Since then his solo music career has been more low-key, his other top 50 albums are &quot;Worlds Away&quot; (November 1991), &quot;Let&#x27;s All Get Together&quot; (July 2007) and &quot;Soul on West 53rd&quot; (November 2009). In 1993 Cold Chisel, with Moss as a member, were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. Moss has participated with periodic Cold Chisel reunion tours or new studio albums in 1998, 2003 and from 2009 to 2012 (as from August 2013).

==Career==
===Early life===
Ian Richard Moss was born on 20 March 1955 in Alice Springs, Northern Territory, to Geoffery Moss (18 April 1911 – 1989) and Lorna (née Robinson) (born ca. 1922).[A] During World War II Geoffery survived the 1942 bombing of Darwin, he enlisted in the army and later worked for the Allied Works Council in Alice Springs. Lorna was a fellow employee at Allied Works Council when they married in September 1945.

Moss has an older brother, Peter Geoffrey Moss (born 8 October 1948), an older sister, Penny (born 30 July 1951), and a younger brother, Andrew (born July 13 1961). When Moss was four years old he performed for his family and friends and at nine, sang &quot;The Battle of New Orleans&quot; at a school concert. He later recalled &quot;I was always keen on music and singing. I used to do little vocal concerts for my parents&quot;. Moss initially took piano lessons but switched to guitar at age 11: &quot;My older sister was learning classical piano and my older brother was a good rhythm strummer and right into Bob Dylan. I started off with classical piano aged about 7 or 8, but unfortunately wasn&#x27;t into it enough&quot;.

In 1969 he joined a local band, Seen, which included drummer Rod Martin and two brothers, Robert and John Fortunaso. Moss played rhythm guitar by plugging an acoustic guitar into the bass player&#x27;s amplifier. Seen played at local centres and organised their own dances. Moss sang a couple of songs with the group and a year later, he bought an electric guitar to replace his acoustic. Moss recalled, &quot;I was with them for about a year and by that time I was starting to get my own band happening&quot;.

The following year he formed Hot Ice with Roger Harris – guitar, David Michel – drums, Wayne Sanderson – Bass and Paul Wiles – keyboards. The group debuted in front of the whole school at the Alice Springs High School regular Friday assembly which took place in the Alice Springs Youth Centre with cover versions of Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s &quot;Proud Mary&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;ll Stop the Rain&quot;. Thereafter they regularly played at the Youth Centre Saturday night dances. 
 In 1972, Moss relocated to Adelaide – where his older siblings had already moved. Moss had failed a year of high school and decided to repeat at Marion High School. In 1973 he started an Electronics course at Kilkenny Technical College but &quot;lasted one term there ... totally daydreaming the whole time&quot;, he left and worked in various factory jobs.

===1973–1984: Cold Chisel===

In September 1973 Ian Moss, on guitar and lead vocals, formed a rock group, Orange, in Adelaide with Don Walker, a songwriter and organist, and Leszek Kaczmarek on bass guitar. Within months the line-up included Steve Prestwich on drums and Jimmy Barnes on lead vocals, and they were renamed, Cold Chisel. The group&#x27;s early line-up was volatile with Barnes, Prestwich and Walker all leaving and returning at various times. In 1975 Kaczmarek was replaced on bass guitar by Phil Small.

Moss&#x27;s main role was as lead guitarist, although he would frequently take over lead vocals when Barnes was out of the band. After periods spent in Adelaide, Armidale and Melbourne, Cold Chisel eventually settled in Sydney in mid-1977 and signed a recording contract with WEA late that year. Early the following year they recorded their self-titled debut album, which appeared in April. Moss supplied lead vocals for two tracks, &quot;One Long Day&quot; and &quot;Rosaline&quot;.
Moss&#x27;s vocals feature on some of the band&#x27;s best known songs, including the singles &quot;My Baby&quot; (August 1980), &quot;When the War Is Over&quot; (1982), and &quot;Saturday Night&quot; (March 1984) and on &quot;Circus Animals&quot; (March 1982) album track, &quot;Bow River&quot;. Moss wrote &quot;Bow River&quot; about a cattle station in the Kimberley region of Western Australia where his brother, Peter, had once worked; it has since become Moss&#x27;s signature tune. It was also the B-side of &quot;Forever Now&quot;, which was released in the same month as the album.

Moss sang lead on the group&#x27;s version of &quot;Georgia On My Mind&quot; which became a staple of their live shows, although their only recording is on the 1984 live album, &quot;Barking Spiders Live: 1983&quot;. Their fifth studio album, &quot;Twentieth Century&quot;, was issued in April 1984 with two tracks, &quot;Saturday Night&quot; and &quot;Janelle&quot;, featuring Moss on lead vocals. However the group had disbanded as Barnes was keen to begin his solo career.

During Cold Chisel&#x27;s first phase, Moss gained status as a songwriter, contributing &quot;Never Before&quot; for &quot;East&quot; (June 1980), the track was the first one aired by national radio station Triple J when it switched from AM to FM in 1980. Another Moss-written track is &quot;No Good for You&quot; on &quot;Circus Animals&quot;. He also worked as a session musician for other artists, including playing a guitar solo on the track &quot;Skin&quot; from the album &quot;Icehouse&quot; (October 1980) by Sydney new wave band Flowers and an appearance on Richard Clapton&#x27;s &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (March 1982), which also featured Barnes.

===1985–1997: Solo career success===
After Cold Chisel disbanded, Ian Moss took a break from the music industry before launching his solo career in October 1986. His first backing band consisted of Andy Cowan on keyboards (ex-Madder Lake, Ayers Rock, Kevin Borich Express), Joe Imbroll on bass guitar (ex-Goanna) and John Watson on drums (ex-Kevin Borich Express, Australian Crawl). By April the following year the line-up was Watson, Joe Creighton on bass guitar (ex-Melissa, Billy T) and Peter Walker on guitar and synthesiser (ex-Bakery) – Walker had also produced Cold Chisel&#x27;s debut album in 1978.

During 1988 Moss worked in Los Angeles for nine months preparing material for his debut album, &quot;Matchbook&quot;. In November 1988, Moss released his debut single, &quot;Tucker&#x27;s Daughter&quot; which peaked at number two on the ARIA Singles Chart and number six on the New Zealand Singles Chart.

Moss&#x27;s second single, &quot;Telephone Booth&quot;, was issued in June-1989 and reached number seven on the ARIA Singles Chart, and top 30 in New Zealand. &quot;Matchbook&quot;, followed in August, which reached number one on the ARIA Albums Chart, it remained at the peak spot for three weeks and sold more than 200,000 copies. In New Zealand it reached the top 20 on the albums chart. &quot;Matchbook&quot; was produced by Moss and Lord-Alge; it was dedicated &quot;in loving memory of Geoff Moss 1911–1989&quot;. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, found the album displayed Moss&#x27;s &quot;exemplary, controlled guitar technique, but also highlighted his soulful voice ... [he] handled all lead vocals with considerable style and authority&quot;.

Two further singles, &quot;Out of the Fire&quot; and &quot;Mr. Rain&quot; were released from the album and both charted on the Australian top 100. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1990 Moss won five categories Album of the Year, Best Male Artist and Breakthrough Artist – Album for &quot;Matchbook&quot;; and Single of the Year and Breakthrough Artist – Single for &quot;Tucker&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. His touring band in support of &quot;Matchbook&quot; consisted of Ian Belton on bass guitar (ex-QED), Guy Le Claire on rhythm guitar(Mar-Sept 1989)(ex-Eurogliders), Randy Bulpin on rhythm guitar (ex-Mondo Rock), Danny D&#x27;Costa on keyboards, Steve Fearnley on drums and Mark Williams and Mary Azzopardi on backing vocals. 
In October 1991 Moss released his second album, &quot;Worlds Away&quot;, which featured &quot;songs largely co-written with Don Walker in the soul/R&amp;B vein&quot;. It reached the top 50 on both the ARIA and New Zealand charts. The album provided three singles, &quot;Slip Away&quot; (May), &quot;She&#x27;s a Star&quot; (September) and &quot;Never Give Up&quot; (November); both &quot;Slip Away&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s a Star&quot; reached the ARIA Top 100.

Also that year Moss played in Don Walker&#x27;s band Catfish, contributing guitar to their album, &quot;Ruby&quot;. Subsequently, he made guest appearances on albums by The Black Sorrows&#x27; &quot;Better Times&quot; (1992) on a track called &quot;Ain&#x27;t Love the Strangest Thing&quot;, Richard Clapton&#x27;s &quot;Distant Thunder&quot; (1993), on Barnes&#x27; solo album, &quot;Heat&quot; (1993), the first time he had worked with Barnes in ten years. In June 1994 he provided lead guitar on the title track of Don Walker&#x27;s solo album, &quot;We&#x27;re All Gunna Die&quot; (1995). In 1993 Cold Chisel, with Moss as a member, were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame.

Moss&#x27;s third solo album, &quot;Petrolhead&quot;, was released in August 1996, which was produced by Don Walker for TWA Records. For this album Moss used Walker on keyboards with Paul DeMarco on drums (ex-Rose Tattoo), the late Ian Rilen on bass guitar (from Rose Tattoo &amp; X), and Trent Williamson on harmonica. McFarlane declared it was &quot;his best-ever album ... [by] a down&#x27;n&#x27;dirty blues-rock outfit ... with gritty, hard-edged tracks ... [and] finely honed guitar work&quot;. Two singles were issued, &quot;All Alone on a Rock&quot; and &quot;Poor Boy&quot;, but neither charted. It was re-released the following year as &quot;Ian Moss Box Set&quot; with an additional live CD, &quot;Ian Moss Live&quot;, the live disc was issued separately in 1998. Those live tracks had been recorded during 1996 to 1997 on his national tour supporting &quot;Petrolhead&quot;, with Rilen replaced by Paul Wheeler on bass guitar mid-tour.

===1997–2004: Cold Chisel reunion===
From October 1997 to June 1998 Cold Chisel reunited to record a new studio album, &quot;The Last Wave of Summer&quot; (October 1998), and subsequently toured. In May 2003, another Cold Chisel tour, &quot;Ringside&quot;, resulted in a 2× CD live album of the same name in November.

===2005–present: Solo career continued===
In 2005 Moss released his fourth studio album, &quot;Six Strings&quot; on Liberation Music. it was an acoustic album and included material from his time with Cold Chisel, his solo releases and cover versions of Jimi Hendrix and Creedence Clearwater Revival tracks. To support the release Moss undertook an extensive joint tour of Australia co-headlining with Jon Stevens (ex-Noiseworks, INXS).

Moss&#x27;s next album, &quot;Let&#x27;s All Get Together&quot;, was released in July 2007 on his own label, Mosstrooper (distributed by Liberation). It contained acoustic cover versions of Cold Chisel tracks and material written by Moss and/or his former band mates Walker, Prestwich and Small. The album reached the top 50 on the ARIA Albums Chart in October. From February to April 2008 Moss appeared on the third series of Australian TV celebrity singing contest, &quot;It Takes Two&quot;, where he was partnered by actress, Virginia Gay – they finished in the top three.

Moss travelled to New York in August 2008 to record his next album, &quot;Soul on West 53rd&quot;, which is a collection of mainly soul songs from the 1960s and 1970s. It was produced by Danny Korthmar, and featured Steve Jordan, Neil Jason, Leon Pendarvis and Hugh McCracken. It was released in October 2009 and peaked in the top 40 in Australia. Amazon.com editorial reviewer declared that Moss provides an &quot;unforgettable sound – not only as a telling soloist on guitar but especially with his silken voice, ringing with clarity and resonating with pure soul&quot;. Antonios Sarhanis at Anagrammatically Correct felt it was a &quot;good collection of covers, but why bother when the better originals are so freely available?&quot;.

In December 2009 Cold Chisel reconvened for a gig at Stadium Australia. In October 2010 Cold Chisel appeared at the Deni ute muster. Alongside their old work they premiered new material and announced they were working on another studio album. Recording of Cold Chisel&#x27;s album, &quot;No Plans&quot;, was disrupted when Steven Prestwich was diagnosed with a brain tumour and died on 16 January 2011, aged 56. In October the group replaced Prestwich with former Divinyls drummer, Charley Drayton, and the album was issued in April 2012. Aside from lead guitar and backing vocals, Moss provided lead vocals on two tracks, &quot;Too Late&quot; and &quot;Summer Moon&quot;. Cold Chisel supported the release with a national tour and then, in June, with performances in London.

In 2012 he made a guest appearance on the TV soap opera, &quot;Neighbours&quot;, playing a gig at Charlie&#x27;s Bar. The episode was broadcast in the United Kingdom in October. In May that year &quot;Australian Guitar&quot; magazine listed Moss at number-three on their Definitive Top Ten Australian Guitarists of All Time. In January 2013 Moss, as a solo artist, joined the Red Hot Summer Tour, headlining that tour was Barnes. During June Cold Chisel announced they were in a recording studio. Moss followed with his own Australian tour starting in July.

In March 2018, Moss released &quot;Ian Moss&quot;, his first solo album of all original material in 22 years. The album peaked at number 11 on the ARIA Charts.

He performed at the 2021 NRL Grand Final, singing &quot;Flame Trees&quot; alongside Kate Miller-Heidke, before performing his solo hit &quot;Tucker&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

In July 2023, Moss released his eighth studio album &quot;Rivers Run Dry&quot;. The album will be supported by a national tour commencing in August 2023.

<text>Rambus Inc. is an American technology company that designs, develops and licenses chip interface technologies and architectures that are used in digital electronics products. The company, founded in 1990, is well known for inventing RDRAM and for its intellectual property-based litigation following the introduction of DDR-SDRAM memory.

== History ==
Rambus was founded in March 1990 by electrical and computer engineers, Mike Farmwald and Mark Horowitz. The company&#x27;s early investors included premier venture capital and investment banking firms such as Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, Merrill Lynch, Mohr Davidow Ventures, and Goldman Sachs.

Rambus was incorporated and founded as California company in 1990 and then re-incorporated in the state of Delaware before the company went public in 1997 on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol RMBS.

In the 1990s, Rambus was a high-speed interface technology development and marketing company that invented 600 MHz interface technology, which solved memory bottleneck issues faced by system designers. Rambus&#x27;s technology was based on a very high speed, chip-to-chip interface that was incorporated on dynamic random-access-memory (DRAM) components, processors and controllers, which achieved performance rates over ten times faster than conventional DRAMs. Rambus&#x27;s RDRAM transferred data at 600 MHz over a narrow byte-wide Rambus Channel to Rambus-compatible Integrated Circuits (ICs).

Rambus&#x27;s interface was an open standard, accessible to all semiconductor companies, such as Intel. Rambus provided companies who licensed its technology a full range of reference designs and engineering services. Rambus&#x27;s interface technology was broadly licensed to leading DRAM, ASIC and PC peripheral chipset suppliers in the 1990s. Licensees of Rambus&#x27;s RDRAM technology included companies such as Creative Labs, Intel, Microsoft, Nintendo, Silicon Graphics, Hitachi, Hyundai, IBM, Molex, Macronix and NEC.

Rambus RDRAM technology was integrated into products such as Nintendo 64, Microsoft&#x27;s Talisman 3D graphics chip set, Creative Labs Graphics Blaster 3D Graphics cards for PCs, workstations manufactured by Silicon Graphics and Intel&#x27;s system memory chipsets for PCs.

In 2003, Rambus Incorporated announced that Toshiba Corp. and Elpida Memory Inc. will produce its new memory technology, known as XDR DRAM. The memory technology is capable of running at 3.2 GHz and is said to be faster than any memory technology available in consumer entertainment devices and PCs at the time.

Rambus purchased Cryptography Research on June 6, 2011, for $342.5M. This will enable Rambus Inc. to develop its semiconductor licensing portfolio to include CRI&#x27;s content protection and security. According to Rambus CEO Harold Hughes, the CRI security technologies would be applied to a variety of products in the company&#x27;s IP portfolio.

Today, Rambus derives the majority of its annual revenue by licensing its technologies and patents for chip interfaces to its customers. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, history of Rambus has been &quot;marked by litigation, including patent battles with numerous chip makers&quot;.

In 2015, Rambus acquired Integrion Microelectronics, a small Toronto based IP provider of high-speed analog SerDes PHY for an undisclosed amount. Through this acquisition, Rambus opened its 1st Canadian office and boosted its high-speed serdes IP portfolio offering.

On August 17, 2015, Rambus announced the new R+ DDR4 server memory chips RB26 DDR4 RDIMM and RB26 DDR4 LRDIMM. The chipset includes a DDR4 Register Clock Driver and Data Buffer, and it&#x27;s fully-compliant with the JEDEC DDR4.

In 2016, Rambus acquired Semtech&#x27;s Snowbush IP for US$32.5 million. Snowbush IP provides analog and mixed-signal IP technologies, and will expand Rambus&#x27; product offerings.

In 2016, Rambus acquired Inphi Memory Interconnect Business, for US$90 million. The acquisition includes all assets of the Inphi Memory Interconnect Business, such as customer contracts, product inventory, supply chain agreements, and intellectual property.

On November 2, 2017, Rambus announced partnership with Interac Association and Samsung Canada to assist in enabling Samsung Pay in Canada.

In 2018, Rambus agreed to renew a patent license with Nvidia. Rambus would be sharing its patent portfolio, including those covering serial links and memory controllers, with Nvidia.

On December 11, 2019, Rambus HBM2 PHY and Memory Controller IP were announced to be used in Inflame Technology&#x27;s AI training chip.

In 2019, Rambus announced that it will move headquarters from Sunnyvale, California to North San Jose, California.

In 2021, Rambus announced that it started an expedited share buyback program with Deutsche Bank to buy up roughly $100 million in common stock. Rambus also acquired two companies, AnalogX and PLDA, which specialize in physical links for PCIe and CXL protocols.

In May 2022, it was announced Rambus had acquired the Montreal-headquartered electronic design company, Hardent.

In July 2023, Rambus sold its SerDes and memory interface PHY IP business to Cadence Design Systems for $110 million. In September 2023, it was announced the acquisition had been completed.

== Technology ==

An early version of RDRAM, base RDRAM, was used in the Nintendo 64 that was released in 1996.

Disadvantages of RDRAM technology include significantly increased latency, power dissipation as heat, manufacturing complexity, and cost. PC800 RDRAM operated with a minimum latency of 45 ns, compared to 15 ns for PC133 SDRAM. RDRAMs can also be told to increase their latencies in order to prevent the possibility of two or more chips transmitting at the same time and causing a collision. However, SDRAM latency depends on the current state of memory so its latency can vary widely depending on what happened earlier and the strategy used by the SDRAM controller, while RDRAM latency is constant once it has been established by the memory controller. RDRAM memory chips also put out significantly more heat than SDRAM chips, necessitating heatsinks on all RIMM devices.

Rambus also developed and licensed its XDR DRAM technology, notably used in the PlayStation 3, and more recently XDR2 DRAM.

== Lawsuits ==
In the early 1990s, Rambus was invited to join the JEDEC. Rambus had been trying to interest memory manufacturers in licensing their proprietary memory interface, and numerous companies had signed non-disclosure agreements to view Rambus&#x27; technical data. During the later &quot;Infineon v. Rambus&quot; trial, Infineon memos from a meeting with representatives of other manufacturers surfaced, including the line &quot;[O]ne day all computers will be built this way, but hopefully without the royalties going to Rambus&quot;, and continuing with a strategy discussion for reducing or eliminating royalties to be paid to Rambus. As Rambus continued its participation in JEDEC, it became apparent that they were not prepared to agree to JEDEC&#x27;s patent policy requiring owners of patents included in a standard to agree to license that technology under terms that are &quot;reasonable and non-discriminatory&quot;, and Rambus withdrew from the organization in 1995. Memos from Rambus at that time showed they were tailoring new patent applications to cover features of SDRAM being discussed, which were public knowledge (JEDEC meetings are not secret) and perfectly legal for patent owners who have patented underlying innovations, but were seen as evidence of bad faith by the jury in the first &quot;Infineon v. Rambus&quot; trial. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) rejected this theory of bad faith in its decision overturning the fraud conviction Infineon achieved in the first trial (see below).

=== Patent lawsuits ===
In 2000, Rambus began filing lawsuits against the largest memory manufacturers, claiming that they owned SDRAM and DDR technology. Seven manufacturers, including Samsung, quickly settled with Rambus and agreed to pay royalties on SDRAM and DDR memory. In May 2001, Rambus was found guilty of fraud for having claimed that it owned SDRAM and DDR technology, and all infringement claims against memory manufacturers were dismissed. In January 2003, the CAFC overturned the fraud verdict of the jury trial in Virginia under Judge Payne, issued a new claims construction, and remanded the case back to Virginia for re-trial on infringement. In October 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case. Thus, the case returned to Virginia per the CAFC ruling.

In January 2005, Rambus filed four more lawsuits against memory chip makers Hynix Semiconductor, Nanya Technology, Inotera Memories and Infineon Technology claiming that DDR2, GDDR2 and GDDR3 chips contain Rambus technology. In March 2005, Rambus had its claim for patent infringements against Infineon dismissed. When Rambus was accused of shredding key documents prior to court hearings, the judge agreed and dismissed Rambus&#x27;s case against Infineon. This led Rambus to negotiate a settlement with Infineon, which agreed to pay Rambus quarterly license fees of $5.9 million and in return, both companies ceased all litigation against each other. The agreement ran from November 2005 to November 2007. After this date, if Rambus had enough remaining agreements in place, Infineon may make extra payments up to $100 million. In June 2005, Rambus also sued one of its strongest proponents, Samsung, the world&#x27;s largest memory manufacturer, and terminated Samsung&#x27;s license. Samsung had promoted Rambus&#x27;s RDRAM and currently remains a licensee of Rambus&#x27;s XDR memory.

In February 2006, Micron Technology sued Rambus, alleging that Rambus had violated RICO and deliberately harmed Micron.

On April 29, 2008, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a ruling vacating the order of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, saying the case with Samsung should be dismissed, saying Judge Robert E. Payne&#x27;s findings critical of Rambus, were on a case that had already been settled, and thus had no legal standing.

On January 9, 2009, a Delaware federal judge ruled that Rambus could not enforce patents against Micron Technology Inc., stating that Rambus had a &quot;clear and convincing&quot; show of bad faith, and ruled that Rambus&#x27; destruction of key related documents (spoliation of evidence) nullified its right to enforce its patents against Micron.

In July 2009, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) rejected 8 claims by Rambus against Nvidia.

On November 24, 2009, the USPTO rejected all 17 claims in three Rambus patents that the company asserted against Nvidia in a complaint filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC). However the ITC has announced that out of five patents, Nvidia did violate three of them. Due to this ruling Nvidia faced a potential U.S. import ban on some of its chips used in the nForce, Quadro, GeForce, Tesla, and Tegra series graphics products—nearly every video card type manufactured by Nvidia.

On June 20, 2011, Rambus went to trial against Micron and Hynix in California, seeking as much as $12.9 billion in damages for &quot;a secret and unlawful conspiracy to kill a revolutionary technology, make billions of dollars and hang onto power&quot;, Rambus lawyer Bart Williams told jurors. Rambus lost on November 16, 2011, in the jury trial and its shares dropped drastically, from $14.04 to $4.00 per share.

On November 16, 2011, Rambus lost the antitrust case against Micron Technology and Hynix Semiconductor. The San Francisco County Superior Court jury ruled against Rambus in a 9–3 vote. In a statement posted on the company&#x27;s website, Rambus CEO Harold Hughes said: &quot;We are reviewing our options for appeal&quot;.

On January 24, 2012, a USPTO appeals board declared the third of three patents known as the &quot;Barth patents&quot; invalid. The first two had been declared invalid in September 2011. Rambus had used these patents to win infringement lawsuits against Nvidia Corp and Hewlett-Packard.

On June 28, 2013, The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the USPTO and the &#x27;109 Barth patent&#x27;s validity was reinstated:

&quot;In conclusion, the Board&#x27;s determination that all 25 claims of the &#x27;109 Patent are invalid as anticipated by Farmwald is not supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, this court reverses.&quot;

=== Federal Trade Commission antitrust suits ===
In May 2002, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed charges against Rambus for antitrust violations. Specifically, the FTC complaint asserted that through the use of patent continuations and divisionals, Rambus pursued a strategy of expanding the scope of its patent claims to encompass the emerging SDRAM standard. The FTC&#x27;s antitrust allegations against Rambus went to trial in the summer of 2003 after the organization formally accused Rambus of anti-competitive behavior the previous June, itself the result of an investigation launched in May 2002 at the behest of the memory manufacturers. The FTC&#x27;s chief administrative-law judge, Stephen J. McGuire, dismissed the antitrust claims against Rambus in 2006, saying that the memory industry had no reasonable alternatives to Rambus technology and was aware of the potential scope of Rambus patent rights, according to the company. Soon after, FTC investigators filed a brief to appeal against that ruling.

On August 2, 2006, the FTC overturned McGuire&#x27;s ruling, stating that Rambus illegally monopolized the memory industry under section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, and also practiced deception that violated section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.

February 5, 2007, the FTC issued a ruling that limits maximum royalties that Rambus may demand from manufacturers of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), which was set to 0.5% for DDR SDRAM for 3 years from the date the commission&#x27;s Order is issued and then going to 0; while SDRAM&#x27;s maximum royalty was set to 0.25%. The Commission claimed that halving the DDR SDRAM rate for SDRAM would reflect the fact that while DDR SDRAM utilizes four of the relevant Rambus technologies, SDRAM uses only two. In addition to collecting fees for DRAM chips, Rambus will also be able to receive 0.5% and 1.0% royalties for SDRAM and DDR SDRAM memory controllers or other non-memory chip components respectively. However, the ruling did not prohibit Rambus from collecting royalties on products based on DDR2 SDRAM, GDDR2, and other JEDEC post-DDR memory standards. Rambus has appealed the FTC Opinion/Remedy and awaits a court date for the appeal.

On March 26, 2008, the jury of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California determined that had Rambus acted properly while a member of the standard-setting organization JEDEC during its participating in the early 1990s, finding that the memory manufacturers did not meet their burden of proving antitrust and fraud claims.

On April 22, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned the FTC reversal of McGuire&#x27;s 2006 ruling, saying that the FTC had not established that Rambus had harmed the competition.

On February 23, 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the bids by the FTC to impose royalty sanctions on Rambus via antitrust penalties.

=== European Commission antitrust suit ===
July 30, 2007, the European Commission launched antitrust investigations against Rambus, taking the view that Rambus engaged in intentional deceptive conduct in the context of the standard-setting process for example by not disclosing the existence of the patents which it later claimed were relevant to the adopted standard. This type of behavior is known as a &quot;patent ambush&quot;. Against this background, the Commission provisionally considered that Rambus breached the EC Treaty&#x27;s rules on abuse of a dominant market position (Article 82 EC Treaty) by subsequently claiming unreasonable royalties for the use of those relevant patents. The commission&#x27;s preliminary view is that without its &quot;patent ambush&quot;, Rambus would not have been able to charge the royalty rates it currently does.

=== Recent settlements ===
In 2013 and 2014, Rambus settled and agreed on licensing terms with several of the companies involved in long-running disputes. On December 13, 2013, Rambus entered an agreement with Micron to let the latter use some of its patents, in exchange for $280 million worth of royalties over seven years. In June 2013, the company settled with SK Hynix, with Hynix paying $240 million to settle the disputes.

In March 2014, Rambus and Nanya signed a 5-year patent licensing agreement, settling earlier claims.

Rambus said these deals were part of a change in strategy to a less litigious, more collaborative approach, distancing themselves from accusations of patent trolling. Ronald Black, Rambus&#x27;s CEO, said, &quot;Somehow we got thrown into the patent troll bunch...This is just not the case.&quot;

<doc id="581793" wikidata="Q262779" url="?curid=581793" title="United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda">
<text>The United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) was established by United Nations Security Council Resolution 872 on 5 October 1993. It was intended to assist in the implementation of the Arusha Accords, signed on 4 August 1993, which was meant to end the Rwandan Civil War. The mission lasted from October 1993 to March 1996. Its activities were meant to aid the peace process between the Hutu-dominated Rwandese government and the Tutsi-dominated rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). The UNAMIR has received much attention for its role in failing, due to the limitations of its rules of engagement, to prevent the Rwandan genocide and outbreak of fighting. Its mandate extended past the RPF overthrow of the government and into the Great Lakes refugee crisis. The mission is thus regarded as a major failure.

== Background ==
In October 1990 the Rwandan Civil War began when the Rwandan Patriotic Front rebel group invaded across Uganda&#x27;s southern border into northern Rwanda. The RPF was composed of over 4,000 soldiers, mostly the children of Tutsi refugees who had fled anti-Tutsi purges in Rwanda between 1959 and 1963. It portrayed itself as a democratic, multi-ethnic movement and demanded an end to ethnic discrimination, to economic looting of the country by government elites and a stop to the security situation that continued to generate refugees. It was supported by the Ugandan government of Yoweri Museveni, who had come to power in the Ugandan Bush War with significant support from the Rwandan refugees in the country. However, the Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR) was saved by reinforcements from France and Zaire, who backed the government of Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana, who had been in power since 1973.

The French intervention of two parachute companies, explained as an attempt to protect its own nationals, actually blocked the RPF advance on the capital Kigali. In contrast, the government of Belgium, the former colonial power, cut all support to the Habyarimana regime, which viewed the action as abandonment. Thwarted by the French, the RPF suffered a humiliating retreat back into the Virunga Mountains along the border. After the demoralising death of Major-General Fred Rwigyema, the collapse of the RPF was prevented through the leadership of Paul Kagame.

The RPF thus managed to retain control of a sliver of land in the north, from which it continued to launch raids. Comparing the RPF and FAR as he saw them in 1993, Canadian Lieutenant-General Roméo Dallaire noted that the rebels &quot;had won all recent contests because of their superior leadership, training, experience, frugality, mobility, discipline and morale.&quot;

However, the RPF invasion, which displaced approximately 600,000 people into crowded internally displaced person camps, also radicalised the Hutu populace. The Tutsi civilians in Rwanda, roughly 14% of the population, were labelled &quot;ibyitso&quot; (&quot;accomplices&quot;) or &quot;inyenzi&quot; (&quot;cockroaches&quot;), who were accused of secretly aiding the RPF invaders. Anti-Tutsi propaganda was spread through the publication &quot;Kangura&quot;, a forerunner to the Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines, which was created immediately after the invasion. The first plans for mass murder of Tutsi were also developed toward the end of 1990, mostly in a series of secret meetings in Gisenyi prefecture of the &quot;Akazu&quot;, a network of associates based around Agathe Habyarimana, the First Lady.

A number of ceasefire agreements were signed by the RPF and government, including one signed on 22 July 1992 in Arusha, Tanzania that resulted in the Organization of African Unity (OAU) establishing a 50-member Neutral Military Observer Group (NMOG I) led by Nigerian General Ekundayo Opaleye.
The negotiations for a peace settlement continued in Arusha, interrupted by a massive RPF offensive in early February 1993. Rwanda continued to allege Ugandan support for the RPF, which both the RPF and Uganda duly denied, but resulting in both countries sending letters to President of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) requesting that military observers be deployed along the border to verify that military supplies were not crossing.

This resulted in the United Nations Observer Mission Uganda–Rwanda (UNOMUR) being approved by the UNSC on 22 June 1993 to deploy along the Ugandan side of the border. Seven days later, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali announced that Brigadier-General Dallaire was to be appointed the Chief Military Observer for UNOMUR, which reached its authorised strength of 81 observers by September. NMOG I was deployed inside Rwanda.

In the meantime, talks in Arusha had reconvened on 16 March 1993, resulting in the signing of the Arusha Accords, a comprehensive agreement to create a power-sharing government, on the fourth of August. Both the RPF and Rwandan government requested UN assistance in implementing the agreement. In early August, NMOG I was replaced by NMOG II, consisting of about 130 members, in preparation for a UN-led peacekeeping force.

== Establishment ==

===Mandate===
UNAMIR mandate was:

:(a) To contribute to the security of the city of Kigali inter alia with in a weapons-secure area established by the parties in and around the city;
:(b) To monitor observance of the cease-fire agreement, which calls for the establishment of cantonment and assembly zones and the demarcation of the new demilitarised zone and other demilitarisation procedures;
:(c) To monitor the security situation during the final period of the transitional government’s mandate, leading up to the elections;
:(d) To assist with mine clearance, primarily through training programmes;
:(e) To investigate at the request of the parties or on its own initiative instances of alleged non-compliance with the provisions of the Arusha Peace Agreement relating to the integration of the armed forces, and pursue any such instances with the parties responsible and report thereon as appropriate to the Secretary-General;
:(f) To monitor the process of repatriation of Rwandese refugees and resettlement of displaced persons to verify that it is carried out in a safe and orderly manner;
:(g) To assist in the coordination of humanitarian assistance activities in conjunction with relief operations;
:(h) To investigate and report on incidents regarding the activities of the gendarmerie and police.

Its authorised strength was 2,500 personnel, but it took some five months of piecemeal commitments for the mission to reach this level.

On 5 April 1994, the UN voted to extend the mandate of UNAMIR to 29 July 1994, after expressing &quot;deep concern at the delay in the establishment of the broad-based transitional Government and the Transitional National Assembly&quot; and &quot;concern at the deterioration in security in the country, particularly in Kigali.&quot;

On 21 April 1994, the Security Council voted to reduce the number of troops from 2,500 to 270 personnel in Resolution 912.

On 17 May 1994, the Security Council passed Resolution 918, which expanded UNAMIR’s mandate to include the following additional responsibilities: &quot;(a) To contribute to the security and protection of displaced persons, refugees and civilians at risk in Rwanda, including through the establishment and maintenance, where feasible, of secure humanitarian areas; (b) To provide security and support for the distribution of relief supplies and humanitarian relief operations&quot;.

===Composition of UNAMIR===
The Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG) or head of the mission, was Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh of Cameroon. At the beginning of July 1994, Booh-Booh was replaced by Shahryar Khan of Pakistan. The military head and Force Commander was Canadian Brigadier-General (promoted Major-General during the mission) Roméo Dallaire. In August 1994, Dallaire, suffering from severe stress, was replaced as Force Commander by Major-General Guy Tousignant, also from Canada. In December 1995, Tousignant was replaced by Brigadier General Shiva Kumar from India. The Deputy Force Commander was Brigadier-General (promoted Major-General after the mission) Henry Kwami Anyidoho from Ghana. 

Troop contributing countries were Belgium, Bangladesh, Ghana, and Tunisia. Around 400 of the troops in this early part of the mission were Belgian soldiers, despite the fact that Rwanda had been a Belgian colony, and normally the UN bans the former colonial power from serving in such peace-keeping roles.

Squabbling between interested parties delayed the UNAMIR goal of assisting the formation of the transitional government following the inauguration of President Habyarimana on 5 January 1994. The violent clashes that followed, including the assassinations of two major political leaders and the ambush of a UNAMIR-led convoy of RPF forces led the UNAMIR forces to move to a more defensive footing. UNAMIR thus contributed support to the military and civilian authorities in Rwanda, while the UN continued to place pressure on Habyarimana and the RPF to return to the ideas set forth in the Accords.

== Operations before the genocide ==

The United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) had been in Rwanda since October 1993, with a mandate to oversee the implementation of the Arusha Accords. UNAMIR commander Dallaire learned of the Hutu Power movement during the early phase of deployment; in January 1994, a government informant alerted Dallaire to a group who were rapidly arming militias and planning mass extermination of Tutsi, and led UNAMIR to a secret arms cache. Dallaire sent a cable to the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) in New York, requesting permission to raid the weapons caches; the UN refused Dallaire&#x27;s request to raid the arms, and rebuked him for exceeding his mandate. Dallaire&#x27;s cable also informed the DPKO of the information concerning the genocide; it said: &quot;Since UNAMIR mandate [the informant] has been ordered to register all Tutsi in Kigali. He suspects it is for their extermination. Example he gave was that in 20 minutes his personnel could kill up to 1000 Tutsis.&quot; Dallaire received little support from the administrative head of UNAMIR, Cameroonian Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh; the RPF accused Booh-Booh of partiality towards President Habyarimana and the Hutu elite. UNAMIR operated with very limited resources, and its efforts to install the transitional government were obstructed by President Habyarimana and the hardliners throughout early 1994. By April, the Security Council threatened to terminate UNAMIR&#x27;s mandate if it did not make progress.

== Genocide ==

On 6 April 1994, a plane carrying President Habyarimana and President Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi was shot down near Kigali. What followed was the collapse of the unstable peace in Rwanda and the Rwandan genocide, estimated to have claimed between 800,000 and 1,017,100 Tutsi and Hutu victims over 100 days.

Among the first targets of the genocide were Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana and ten Belgian members of 2nd Commando Battalion, the Paracommando Regiment operating as part of UNAMIR. These troops were murdered after handing over their weapons to Rwandan government troops. They were advised to do so by their battalion commander who was unclear on the legal issues with authorising them to defend themselves, even though they had already been under fire for approximately two hours.

Following the death of Habyarimana, Dallaire liaised repeatedly with both the Crisis Committee and the RPF, in an attempt to re-establish peace. He addressed the government forces during the night of 6 April, expressing regret at Habyarimana&#x27;s death but urging them to restrain the killings that had commenced; he also urged Kagame not to resume the civil war, to avoid escalating the violence and to give UNAMIR a chance to rein in the killings. Neither side was interested in a ceasefire, the government because it was controlled by the génocidaires, and the RPF because it considered it necessary to fight to stop the killings. UNAMIR&#x27;s Chapter VI mandate rendered it powerless to intervene militarily, and most of its Rwandan staff were killed in the early days of the genocide, severely limiting its ability to operate. UNAMIR was therefore largely reduced to a bystander role, and Dallaire later labelled it a &quot;failure&quot;. Its most significant contribution was to provide refuge for thousands of Tutsi and moderate Hutu at its headquarters in Amahoro Stadium, as well as other secure UN sites. UNAMIR also assisted with the evacuation of foreign nationals; a group of Belgian soldiers, who had been sheltering 2,000 Rwandans at the École Technique Officielle, were ordered to abandon their station to assist in the evacuation. After the Belgians left, Hutu militants entered and massacred everyone inside.

On 12 April, the Belgian government, which was one of the largest troop contributors to UNAMIR, and had lost ten soldiers protecting Prime Minister Uwilingiliyimana, announced that it was withdrawing. Belgium also favoured a complete withdrawal of UNAMIR, and lobbied for this in the UN. Dallaire protested, arguing that the force should be strengthened and given a new mandate to protect the thousands of refugees it was protecting, but the UN Security Council refused, telling Dallaire that UNAMIR would be effectively withdrawn unless the belligerents agreed to a ceasefire by early May. According to Philip Gourevitch, the United States, having recently suffered losses in the UN mission in Somalia, was particularly keen to &quot;get out of Rwanda&quot; and &quot;leave it to its fate&quot;. New Zealand, which held the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council, was the lone voice supporting reinforcement, and in late April, persuaded the council to postpone UNAMIR&#x27;s withdrawal, despite continuing reluctance from the United States and United Kingdom.

Though understaffed and abandoned, members of the UNAMIR forces did manage to save the lives of thousands of Tutsis in and around Kigali and the few areas of UN control. Dallaire requested the immediate insertion of approximately 5,000 troops, but his request was denied.

===UNAMIR II===

For the next six weeks, approximately, UNAMIR coordinated peace talks between the Hutu government and the RPF to little avail. Eventually, on 17 May 1994, the UN agreed to reinforcement, that would deliver nearly 5,500 troops and much needed personnel carriers and other equipment to UNAMIR, which would be henceforth known as UNAMIR II. The new soldiers did not start arriving until June, and following the end of the genocide in July, the role of UNAMIR II was largely confined to maintaining security and stability. UNAMIR withdrew from Rwanda in 1996, following the withdrawal of support by the RPF-led government.

UNAMIR II and subsequent resolutions were still unclear on the right to use force in stopping the genocide. In one of Dallaire&#x27;s parting cables, he said that &quot;the [UN] force has been prevented from having a modicum of self-respect and effectiveness on the ground&quot;.
Unfortunately, in the face of the mayhem in Rwanda and this diplomatic watering down of UNAMIR&#x27;s mandate, many UN member states delayed contributing personnel for some time, until the main wave of killings ceased.

== After the genocide ==

In July 1994, the RPF swept into Kigali and ended the genocide that had lasted 100 days, and RPF leader Paul Kagame (who became president several years later—and still is today—but effectively controlled the country from July 1994 through the present) reaffirmed his commitment to the Arusha Accords.

Following the end of the main killings the challenges for UNAMIR (and the many NGOs who arrived in the country) were to maintain the fragile peace, stabilise the government and, most importantly, care for the nearly 4 million displaced people in camps within Rwanda, Zaire, Tanzania, Burundi, and Uganda. The massive camps around Lake Kivu in the northwest of Rwanda were holding about 1.2 million people and this was creating enormous security, health, and ecological problems.

After the late arrival of the much-needed troop support, UNAMIR continued to carry out its mandate to the best of its abilities. In 1996, however, with assertion from the new Rwandese government that UNAMIR had failed in its priority mission, the UN withdrew the UNAMIR mandate on 8 March 1996. 
Despite the failure of UNAMIR in its main mission, its humanitarian services during the 1994 genocide are recognised to this day as having saved the lives of thousands or tens of thousands of Rwandan Tutsi and Hutu moderates who would have otherwise been killed. However, the actions of the UN in Rwanda (and particularly the Head of Peacekeeping Operations at the time, Kofi Annan) have been used by some as examples of the over-bureaucratic and dithering approach of the UN. (General Dallaire was particularly critical of Annan&#x27;s performance.)

Countries that contributed troops to UNAMIR throughout its existence were: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chad, Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Fiji, Germany, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, India, Jordan, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Netherlands, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russia, Senegal, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, Togo, Tunisia, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

==Casualties==
Twenty-seven members of UNAMIR – 22 soldiers, three military observers, one civilian police and one local staff – lost their lives during the mission. The genocide and the spectre of mission failure had a profound effect on Dallaire. On his return to Canada he was diagnosed with acute posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); he became suicidal. He was eventually released from the Canadian army service on medical grounds. Dallaire received the Aegis Trust Award (the first) for his acts of bravery. In 2004–2005, he was awarded a fellowship at the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, Harvard University, where he was studying and writing about different forms of conflict resolution. On 25 March 2005, he was appointed a Canadian senator, representing Québec as a member of the Liberal Party of Canada; he serves on the committee for Human Rights. He also speaks publicly about his experiences relating to genocide, PTSD and suicide. While Dallaire&#x27;s issues have been the focus of much attention, particularly in Canada, very little attention has been paid to the plight of the front line soldiers of the Canadian Contingent to UNAMIR who suffered from a rash of suicides, marital breakdowns and career ending diagnoses of PTSD following their return from Rwanda.

<text>Woolworths New Zealand Limited (formerly Progressive Enterprises) is the second largest grocery company in New Zealand (behind Foodstuffs), with revenue of NZ$6.2 billion for the year to June 2018. Alongside Foodstuffs, Woolworths NZ forms part of the New Zealand supermarket duopoly.

Progressive Enterprises Limited was once owned by the Western Australian Supermarket Group FAL – Foodland Associated Limited which operated Action Supermarkets, Supa Valu Supermarkets and Dewsons Supermarkets. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Australian Woolworths Group.

== History ==
* 1948: Progressive Enterprises Limited was established on 9 February 1949 by the Picot family.
* 1961: Progressive Enterprises became the parent company to Foodtown Supermarkets Limited.
* 1974: Albert Gubay opens the first 3Guys store. Progressive Enterprises purchased the chain in 1987, and rebranded or closed them throughout the 1990s with the store in Hillcrest, Hamilton being one of the last when it closed in January 1998.
* 1988: Progressive Enterprises became part of Australian business Coles Myer
* 1992: Coles Myer relaunched Progressive Enterprises onto the New Zealand stock exchange as a public company.

On 25 May 2005, it was announced that Woolworths Limited, one of Australia&#x27;s largest retailers, would be purchasing Progressive Enterprises along with 22 Action stores in Australia. The deal was worth approximately NZ$2.5 billion and culminated in the official transfer of assets on 24 November 2005.

In 2006, company workers at three distribution centres initiated industrial action in an attempt to win a collective employment agreement and pay rise.
The company responded by suspending grocery distribution centre operations and allowing suppliers to send stock directly to supermarkets.

Also in 2006, the company was awarded the Roger Award For The Worst Transnational Corporation Operating in New Zealand.

On 15 August 2007, Progressive Enterprises announced employees on youth rates or under the age of 18 would get paid adult rates, which in some cases can be up to an 80% pay increase. The average pay increased from $9.00 to $13.50.

In August 2011, Progressive Enterprises won a marketing award. On 22 June 2018, Progressive Enterprise Limited renamed to Woolworths New Zealand Limited.

In June 2022, Woolworths New Zealand established a wholesale business, New Zealand Grocery Wholesalers, following the release in March of a Commerce Commission report on competition in the New Zealand grocery sector. The government gave Woolworths and Foodstuffs one year to establish substantial wholesale agreements or face additional regulation.

In July 2023, Woolworths New Zealand announced the rebranding of all Countdown Supermarkets to Woolworths. The rebrand is expected to be completed in early 2024.

In September 2024, thousands of union-affiliated Woolworths supermarket workers went on a two-hour strike to demand better wages and working conditions. In mid-December 2024, Woolworths signed a new collective bargaining agreement with First Union, giving union-affiliated workers a 6.8 percent pay rise over a period of two years.

==Store brands==
Woolworths NZ runs the following grocery store chains:

* Woolworths New Zealand: 191 supermarket stores
* SuperValue: 40 stores – convenience supermarket stores, run as a franchise
* FreshChoice: 30 stores – Higher quality supermarket with a large range, run as a franchise

It operates online grocery shopping in the name of Woolworths (formerly Countdown).
==Former operations== 
* 3 Guys (also known as Gubays)
* Big Fresh
* Price Chopper
* Georgie Pie – A fast food chain, sold to McDonald&#x27;s New Zealand in 1996
* Foodtown – The Foodtown brand was phased out in early 2012. 
*Countdown – The name used in most locations until the 2023 rebrand.

==Product brands==
* Woolworths 
* Freefrom
* Macro
* Essentials
* The Odd Bunch

==Former product brands==
* Signature Range
* Naytura
* FreshZone
* Basics
* No Frills
* Woolworths Select
* Home Brand

<text>In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, a matching or independent edge set in an undirected graph is a set of edges without common vertices. In other words, a subset of the edges is a matching if each vertex appears in at most one edge of that matching. Finding a matching in a bipartite graph can be treated as a network flow problem.

== Definitions ==

Given a graph a matching &quot;M&quot; in &quot;G&quot; is a set of pairwise non-adjacent edges, none of which are loops; that is, no two edges share common vertices.

A vertex is matched (or saturated) if it is an endpoint of one of the edges in the matching. Otherwise the vertex is unmatched (or unsaturated).

A maximal matching is a matching &quot;M&quot; of a graph &quot;G&quot; that is not a subset of any other matching. A matching &quot;M&quot; of a graph &quot;G&quot; is maximal if every edge in &quot;G&quot; has a non-empty intersection with at least one edge in &quot;M&quot;. The following figure shows examples of maximal matchings (red) in three graphs.

A maximum matching (also known as maximum-cardinality matching) is a matching that contains the largest possible number of edges. There may be many maximum matchings. The matching number formula_1 of a graph is the size of a maximum matching. Every maximum matching is maximal, but not every maximal matching is a maximum matching. The following figure shows examples of maximum matchings in the same three graphs.

A perfect matching is a matching that matches all vertices of the graph. That is, a matching is perfect if every vertex of the graph is incident to an edge of the matching. A matching is perfect if formula_2. Every perfect matching is maximum and hence maximal. In some literature, the term complete matching is used. In the above figure, only part (b) shows a perfect matching. A perfect matching is also a minimum-size edge cover. Thus, the size of a maximum matching is no larger than the size of a minimum edge cover: . A graph can only contain a perfect matching when the graph has an even number of vertices.

A near-perfect matching is one in which exactly one vertex is unmatched. Clearly, a graph can only contain a near-perfect matching when the graph has an odd number of vertices, and near-perfect matchings are maximum matchings. In the above figure, part (c) shows a near-perfect matching. If every vertex is unmatched by some near-perfect matching, then the graph is called factor-critical.

Given a matching &quot;M&quot;, an alternating path is a path that begins with an unmatched vertex and whose edges belong alternately to the matching and not to the matching. An augmenting path is an alternating path that starts from and ends on free (unmatched) vertices. Berge&#x27;s lemma states that a matching &quot;M&quot; is maximum if and only if there is no augmenting path with respect to &quot;M&quot;.

An induced matching is a matching that is the edge set of an induced subgraph.

== Properties ==

In any graph without isolated vertices, the sum of the matching number and the edge covering number equals the number of vertices. If there is a perfect matching, then both the matching number and the edge cover number are .

If and are two maximal matchings, then and . To see this, observe that each edge in can be adjacent to at most two edges in because is a matching; moreover each edge in is adjacent to an edge in by maximality of , hence

:formula_3

Further we deduce that

:formula_4

In particular, this shows that any maximal matching is a 2-approximation of a maximum matching and also a 2-approximation of a minimum maximal matching. This inequality is tight: for example, if is a path with 3 edges and 4 vertices, the size of a minimum maximal matching is 1 and the size of a maximum matching is 2.

A spectral characterization of the matching number of a graph is given by Hassani Monfared and Mallik as follows: Let formula_5 be a graph on formula_6 vertices, and formula_7 be formula_8 distinct nonzero purely imaginary numbers where formula_9. Then the matching number of formula_5 is formula_8 if and only if (a) there is a real skew-symmetric matrix formula_12 with graph formula_5 and eigenvalues formula_14 and formula_15 zeros, and (b) all real skew-symmetric matrices with graph formula_5 have at most formula_17 nonzero eigenvalues. Note that the (simple) graph of a real symmetric or skew-symmetric matrix formula_12 of order formula_6 has formula_6 vertices and edges given by the nonozero off-diagonal entries of formula_12.

== Matching polynomials ==

A generating function of the number of &quot;k&quot;-edge matchings in a graph is called a matching polynomial. Let &quot;G&quot; be a graph and &quot;mk&quot; be the number of &quot;k&quot;-edge matchings. One matching polynomial of &quot;G&quot; is
:formula_22
Another definition gives the matching polynomial as
:formula_23
where &quot;n&quot; is the number of vertices in the graph. Each type has its uses; for more information see the article on matching polynomials.

== Algorithms and computational complexity ==

=== Maximum-cardinality matching ===

A fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization is finding a &quot;maximum matching&quot;. This problem has various algorithms for different classes of graphs.

In an &quot;unweighted bipartite graph&quot;, the optimization problem is to find a maximum cardinality matching. The problem is solved by the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm in time time, and there are more efficient randomized algorithms, approximation algorithms, and algorithms for special classes of graphs such as bipartite planar graphs, as described in the main article.

=== Maximum-weight matching ===

In a &quot;weighted&quot; &quot;bipartite graph,&quot; the optimization problem is to find a maximum-weight matching; a dual problem is to find a minimum-weight matching. This problem is often called maximum weighted bipartite matching, or the assignment problem. The Hungarian algorithm solves the assignment problem and it was one of the beginnings of combinatorial optimization algorithms. It uses a modified shortest path search in the augmenting path algorithm. If the Bellman–Ford algorithm is used for this step, the running time of the Hungarian algorithm becomes formula_24, or the edge cost can be shifted with a potential to achieve formula_25 running time with the Dijkstra algorithm and Fibonacci heap.

In a &quot;non-bipartite weighted graph&quot;, the problem of maximum weight matching can be solved in time formula_26 using Edmonds&#x27; blossom algorithm.

=== Maximal matchings ===

A maximal matching can be found with a simple greedy algorithm. A maximum matching is also a maximal matching, and hence it is possible to find a &quot;largest&quot; maximal matching in polynomial time. However, no polynomial-time algorithm is known for finding a minimum maximal matching, that is, a maximal matching that contains the &quot;smallest&quot; possible number of edges.

A maximal matching with &quot;k&quot; edges is an edge dominating set with &quot;k&quot; edges. Conversely, if we are given a minimum edge dominating set with &quot;k&quot; edges, we can construct a maximal matching with &quot;k&quot; edges in polynomial time. Therefore, the problem of finding a minimum maximal matching is essentially equal to the problem of finding a minimum edge dominating set. Both of these two optimization problems are known to be NP-hard; the decision versions of these problems are classical examples of NP-complete problems. Both problems can be approximated within factor 2 in polynomial time: simply find an arbitrary maximal matching &quot;M&quot;.

=== Counting problems ===

The number of matchings in a graph is known as the Hosoya index of the graph. It is #P-complete to compute this quantity, even for bipartite graphs. It is also #P-complete to count perfect matchings, even in bipartite graphs, because computing the permanent of an arbitrary 0–1 matrix (another #P-complete problem) is the same as computing the number of perfect matchings in the bipartite graph having the given matrix as its biadjacency matrix. However, there exists a fully polynomial time randomized approximation scheme for counting the number of bipartite matchings. A remarkable theorem of Kasteleyn states that the number of perfect matchings in a planar graph can be computed exactly in polynomial time via the FKT algorithm.

The number of perfect matchings in a complete graph &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot; (with &quot;n&quot; even) is given by the double factorial (&quot;n&quot; − 1)!!. The numbers of matchings in complete graphs, without constraining the matchings to be perfect, are given by the telephone numbers.

The number of perfect matchings in a graph is also known as the hafnian of its adjacency matrix.

=== Finding all maximally matchable edges ===

One of the basic problems in matching theory is to find in a given graph all edges that may be extended to a maximum matching in the graph (such edges are called maximally matchable edges, or allowed edges). Algorithms for this problem include:

* For general graphs, a deterministic algorithm in time formula_27 and a randomized algorithm in time formula_28.
* For bipartite graphs, if a single maximum matching is found, a deterministic algorithm runs in time formula_29.

=== Online bipartite matching ===
The problem of developing an online algorithm for matching was first considered by Richard M. Karp, Umesh Vazirani, and Vijay Vazirani in 1990. 

In the online setting, nodes on one side of the bipartite graph arrive one at a time and must either be immediately matched to the other side of the graph or discarded. This is a natural generalization of the secretary problem and has applications to online ad auctions. The best online algorithm, for the unweighted maximization case with a random arrival model, attains a competitive ratio of .

== Characterizations ==

Kőnig&#x27;s theorem states that, in bipartite graphs, the maximum matching is equal in size to the minimum vertex cover. Via this result, the minimum vertex cover, maximum independent set, and maximum vertex biclique problems may be solved in polynomial time for bipartite graphs.

Hall&#x27;s marriage theorem provides a characterization of bipartite graphs which have a perfect matching and the Tutte theorem provides a characterization for arbitrary graphs.

== Applications ==

=== Matching in general graphs ===
* A Kekulé structure of an aromatic compound consists of a perfect matching of its carbon skeleton, showing the locations of double bonds in the chemical structure. These structures are named after Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz, who showed that benzene (in graph theoretical terms, a 6-vertex cycle) can be given such a structure.
* The Hosoya index is the number of non-empty matchings plus one; it is used in computational chemistry and mathematical chemistry investigations for organic compounds.
* The Chinese postman problem involves finding a minimum-weight perfect matching as a subproblem.

=== Matching in bipartite graphs ===
* Graduation problem is about choosing minimum set of classes from given requirements for graduation.
* Hitchcock transport problem involves bipartite matching as sub-problem.
* Subtree isomorphism problem involves bipartite matching as sub-problem.

<text>Robert Scott (4 June 1874 – 21 February 1961), was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Born in Haslingden, Lancashire, Scott worked in a cotton mill in Haslingden until 1895 when he joined the Manchester Regiment, going with his regiment to South Africa after the outbreak of the Boer War.

He was a 25-year-old private in the 1st Battalion, Manchester Regiment, British Army, during the Second Boer War when the following deed took place in Natal for which he and Private James Pitts were awarded the VC:
He was invested with his VC by Lord Kitchener on 8 June 1902 at Pretoria, South Africa.

Still in the army during the First World War, Scott served as orderly sergeant at Ashton Barracks, Lancashire. After retiring in 1923, he worked with the Ulster Special Constabulary in Newtownards, Northern Ireland. He enlisted in the Royal Air Force in 1939 and undertook embarkation duties at Southampton Docks during Second World War. After the war he worked as a civil servant.

Scott died on 21 February 1961 aged 86 at Downpatrick, Co Down, and is buried at Christchurch Cemetery, Kilkeel, Co Down.

There are commemorative plaques to Scott on the house where he lived as a boy in Peel Street, Haslingden, and in Kilkeel.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Museum of the Manchester Regiment, Ashton-under-Lyne, England.

<doc id="581799" wikidata="Q16000091" url="?curid=581799" title="Environmental design">
<text>Environmental design is the process of addressing surrounding environmental parameters when devising plans, programs, policies, buildings, or products. It seeks to create spaces that will enhance the natural, social, cultural and physical environment of particular areas. Classical prudent design may have always considered environmental factors; however, the environmental movement beginning in the 1940s has made the concept more explicit.

Environmental design can also refer to the applied arts and sciences dealing with creating the human-designed environment. These fields include architecture, geography, urban planning, landscape architecture, and interior design. Environmental design can also encompass interdisciplinary areas such as historical preservation and lighting design. In terms of a larger scope, environmental design has implications for the industrial design of products: innovative automobiles, wind power generators, solar-powered equipment, and other kinds of equipment could serve as examples. Currently, the term has expanded to apply to ecological and sustainability issues.

== Core Principals ==
1. Sustainability - Minimizing the environmental impact of human activities through the use of renewable resources, energy-efficient technologies, and eco-friendly materials.

2. Functionality - Designing spaces that are practical, accessible, and tailored to the needs and behaviors of the people who will use them. 

3. Aesthetics - Incorporating elements of visual appeal, sensory experience, and emotional connection into the design.

4. Holistic Approach - Considering the interconnected social, economic, and ecological factors that shape the environment.

== Modern Uses ==
Today, environmental design is applied across a wide range of scales, from small-scale residential projects to large-scale urban planning initiatives. Key areas of focus include:

- Sustainable architecture and green building

- Landscape architecture and urban planning

- Transportation design and infrastructure

- Industrial design and product development

- Interior design and space planning

Environmental designers often collaborate with experts from disciplines such as engineering, ecology, sociology, and public policy to create holistic solutions that address the complex challenges of modern environments.

==History==
The first traceable concepts of environmental designs focused primarily on solar heating, which began in Ancient Greece around 500 BCE. At the time, most of Greece had exhausted its supply of wood for fuel, leading architects to design houses that would capture the solar energy of the sun. The Greeks understood that the position of the sun varies throughout the year. For a latitude of 40 degrees in summer the sun is high in the south, at an angle of 70 degrees at the zenith, while in winter, the sun travels a lower trajectory, with a zenith of 26 degrees. Greek houses were built with south-facing façades which received little to no sun in the summer but would receive full sun in the winter, warming the house. Additionally, the southern orientation also protected the house from the colder northern winds. This clever arrangement of buildings influenced the use of the grid pattern of ancient cities. With the north–south orientation of the houses, the streets of Greek cities mainly ran east–west.

The practice of solar architecture continued with the Romans, who similarly had deforested much of their native Italian Peninsula by the first century BCE. The Roman &quot;heliocaminus&quot;, literally &#x27;solar furnace&#x27;, functioned with the same aspects of the earlier Greek houses. The numerous public baths were oriented to the south. Roman architects added glass to windows to allow for the passage of light and to conserve interior heat as it could not escape. The Romans also used greenhouses to grow crops all year long and to cultivate the exotic plants coming from the far corners of the Empire. Pliny the Elder wrote of greenhouses that supplied the kitchen of the Emperor Tiberius during the year.

Along with the solar orientation of buildings and the use of glass as a solar heat collector, the ancients knew other ways of harnessing solar energy. The Greeks, Romans and Chinese developed curved mirrors that could concentrate the sun&#x27;s rays on an object with enough intensity to make it burn in seconds. The solar reflectors were often made of polished silver, copper or brass.

Early roots of modern environmental design began in the late 19th century with writer/designer William Morris, who rejected the use of industrialized materials and processes in wallpaper, fabrics and books his studio produced. He and others, such as John Ruskin felt that the industrial revolution would lead to harm done to nature and workers.

The narrative of Brian Danitz and Chris Zelov&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Ecological Design: Inventing the Future&quot; asserts that in the decades after World War II, &quot;The world was forced to confront the dark shadow of science and industry.&quot; From the middle of the twentieth century, thinkers like Buckminster Fuller have acted as catalysts for a broadening and deepening of the concerns of environmental designers. Nowadays, energy efficiency, appropriate technology, organic horticulture and agriculture, land restoration, New Urbanism, and ecologically sustainable energy and waste systems are recognized considerations or options and may each find application.

By integrating renewable energy sources such as solar photovoltaic, solar thermal, and even geothermal energy into structures, it is possible to create zero emission buildings, where energy consumption is self-generating and non-polluting. It is also possible to construct &quot;energy-plus buildings&quot; which generate more energy than they consume, and the excess could then be sold to the grid. In the United States, the LEED Green Building Rating System rates structures on their environmental sustainability.

==Environmental design and planning==
Environmental design and planning is the moniker used by several Ph.D. programs that take a multidisciplinary approach to the built environment. Typically environmental design and planning programs address architectural history or design (interior or exterior), city or regional planning, landscape architecture history or design, environmental planning, construction science, cultural geography, or historic preservation. Social science methods are frequently employed; aspects of sociology or psychology can be part of a research program.

The concept of &quot;environmental&quot; in these programs is quite broad and can encompass aspects of the natural, built, work, or social environments.

===Areas of research===

* Architecture
* Construction science
* Ecology
* Environmental impact design
* Environmental planning
* Environmental psychology
* Environmental sociology
* Historic preservation
* Landscape architecture
* Sociology of architecture
* Sustainability
* Urban planning
=== Academic programs ===
The following universities offer a Ph.D. in environmental design and planning:
*Clemson University, College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities (Now called &quot;Planning, Design, and the Built Environment&quot;)
*Arizona State University, College of Design
*Kansas State University
*University of Calgary (technically the Ph.D. is in &quot;environmental design,&quot; but encompasses the same scope as the other programs)

Virginia Tech until recently offered the degree program, but has since replaced it with programs in &quot;architecture and design research&quot; and &quot;planning, governance, and globalization&quot;.

Fanshawe College in London, Ontario Canada offers an honours bachelor&#x27;s degree called &quot;Environmental Design and planning.

=== Related programs ===
* University of Missouri, Columbia: Ph.D. in Human Environmental Sciences (PDF file) with emphasis in Architectural Studies. 
* Texas A &amp; M University offers a Ph.D. in architecture that emphasizes environmental design.

==Examples==
Examples of the environmental design process include use of roadway noise computer models in design of noise barriers and use of roadway air dispersion models in analyzing and designing urban highways.

Designers consciously working within this more recent framework of philosophy and practice seek a blending of nature and technology, regarding ecology as the basis for design. Some believe that strategies of conservation, stewardship, and regeneration can be applied at all levels of scale from the individual building to the community, with benefit to the human individual and local and planetary ecosystems.

Specific examples of large scale environmental design projects include:
*Boston Transportation Planning Review
*BART – Bay Area Rapid Transit System Daly City Turn-back project and airport extension.
*Metropolitan Portland, Oregon light rail system

<text>The Vectis National Party was a minor political party operating on the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s. Formed in 1967, the party sought Crown dependency status for the Isle of Wight, on a similar model to certain other islands including the Isle of Man. They were motivated by a belief that the sale of the Isle of Wight to the English crown in 1293 was unconstitutional.

The party contested the Isle of Wight constituency in the 1970 general election when candidate R. W. J. Cawdell, a councillor for Ryde, polled 1,607 votes (2.8% of the Wight vote). The party led it to undertake symbolic direct action, such as an intra-island postal service during the 1971 postal strike. That year it narrowly lost a local government election. It also led campaigns for the establishment of an Isle of Wight specific radio service (which eventually came into being in 1990) and for a regional television service. The party&#x27;s failure to convince the electorate to break from the traditional parties however led to disillusionment amongst members and by the mid 1970s the party had been wound up.

In 2006, Ray Stokes attempted to revive the VNP, emphasizing two aspects: an economically opportunistic deployment of islandness and a conservative, nostalgic impulse. The party was opposed to housing development that would lead to increased migration to the island, and to a fixed link to the island of Great Britain. The revived party did not contest any election.

<text>The Orbital Sciences X-34 was intended to be a low-cost testbed for demonstrating &quot;key technologies&quot; that could be integrated into the Reusable Launch Vehicle program. It was intended to be an autonomous pilotless craft powered by a &quot;Fastrac&quot; liquid-propellant rocket engine, capable of reaching Mach 8 and performing 25 test flights per year. 

The X-34 began as a program for a suborbital reusable-rocket technology demonstrator. In early 2001, the first flight vehicle was near completion, but the program was ended due to budget concerns. Up to this point, the project had encompassed spending of just under $112 million: $85.7M from the original contract with designer Orbital Sciences, $16M from NASA and various government agencies for testing, and an additional $10M for Orbital Sciences to adapt its L-1011 carrier aircraft to accommodate the X-34. The program was officially canceled by NASA on March 31, 2001. The unpowered prototype had been used only for towing and captive flight tests when the project was canceled.

The two demonstrators remained in storage at Edwards Air Force Base until they were temporarily moved to Mojave, California, in late 2010. This prompted some speculation that they might be restored to flight status. , the spaceplanes were lying in the yard of a crane company in nearby Lancaster, California.

<doc id="581805" wikidata="Q673837" url="?curid=581805" title="Hesse-Marburg">
<text>The Landgraviate of Hesse-Marburg () was a German landgraviate, and independent principality, within the Holy Roman Empire, that existed between 1458 and 1500, and between 1567 and 1604/1650.

It consisted of the city of Marburg and the surrounding towns of Gießen, Nidda and Eppstein, approximately what is today called Upper Hesse (&quot;&quot;).

The area had been a semi-independent county under the counts Giso or Gisonen since the 11th century, which at their extinction fell to the Landgraves of Thuringia in the 1130s.

When the daughter of St. Elizabeth of Hungary, Sophie of Brabant, was able to secure the Western parts of Thuringia for her son Henry the Child in 1265, therefore founding the state of Landgraviate of Hesse, the Marburg area became its core territory.

However, Hesse-Marburg, by its name, refers only to the subdivision around Marburg. Basically the old county. This became an independent principality due to inheritance, i.e. by a landgrave splitting his possessions among two or more sons.
* This was first the case in 1485, but as the landgrave died without issue, and the landgraviate reverted to the greater Hesse.
* This was again the case in 1567, Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse or &quot;Philip the Magnanimous&quot; split his large landgraviate into four parts, Hesse-Marburg being one of them.

When, in 1604 Louis IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Marburg died without male issue, he bequeathed equal shares of his territory to the landgraviates of Hesse-Kassel (Marburg) and Hesse-Darmstadt (), yet under the condition that both territories should remain Lutheran. Hesse-Kassel was Calvinist at that time.

As the two lines argued over the details of the division, Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel annexed the whole territory and introduced Calvinism. After a long dispute and armed conflict, Maurice — who had enemies at home as well — resigned in 1627 and left his part of the territory to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt.

However, in the Hessian War of 1645–48, which was a sub-conflict of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the two lines, which were on different sides, again fought over the territory. This war led to the loss of life of up to two-thirds of the civilian population, one of the highest death toll in any German region in history.

In the end, the territory was divided as stipulated in Louis IV&#x27;s will. Hesse-Kassel taking the northern and Hesse-Darmstadt the southern part.

All areas of Hesse-Marburg are today located within the German state of Hesse.

<doc id="581818" wikidata="Q205583" url="?curid=581818" title="John Paul Young">
<text>John Inglis Young, OAM (born 21 June 1950), known professionally as John Paul Young, is an Australian pop singer who is best known for having a worldwide hit with &quot;Love Is in the Air&quot; in 1978. His career was boosted by regular appearances as a performer and guest host on &quot;Countdown&quot;, a 1974–1987 TV series for Australia&#x27;s national broadcaster ABC.
Besides &quot;Love Is in the Air&quot;, Young had top ten chart success in Germany and the Netherlands with &quot;Standing in the Rain&quot; and four other top ten hits in South Africa, including No. 1 hits with &quot;I Hate the Music&quot; in 1976 and &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Hero&quot; in 1975.

On 27 August 2009, Young was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame.

==Career==
===1950–1974: Early life and early career===
Young was born John Inglis Young in Bridgeton, Glasgow, Scotland to James and Agnes (nee Inglis) Young. Together with his parents, two sisters and a brother, Young emigrated to Australia on board the , arriving in Sydney on Australia Day (26 January) 1962 when he was aged 11. His family lived at East Hills Hostel before moving to Liverpool. He attended school at Hammondville Public School, Liverpool Boys High School and Westfields Sports High School. After finishing school, he started an apprenticeship as a sheet metal worker. Initially performing as John Young, his first involvement in music began in late 1967 when he formed a band, Elm Tree, with schoolmates.

The other members included Robert (Slim) Barnett on bass guitar, Ollie Chojnacki on guitar, Philip Edwards (drums 1968–1971, 1972–1976), Andy Imlah on co-lead vocals, Dave Kaentek, Ron Mazurkiewicz on keyboards and Geoff Watts on drums. Elm Tree gained a moderate following around Sydney, and after being spotted by producer Martin Erdman, they cut one single for his Du Monde label, a cover of UK band Marmalade&#x27;s &quot;Rainbow&quot;, which was released through Festival in November 1970, but did not enter the top 50 Australian singles charts. In mid-1971 they entered the New South Wales heats of Hoadley&#x27;s Battle of the Sounds and got as far as the Sydney finals, but they didn&#x27;t make it through to the national final, and so never managed to break out of the Sydney suburban dance circuit.

At this point, Young&#x27;s manager Dal Myles got him a role in the Melbourne production of &quot;The Jesus Christ Revolution&quot;. The show opened and closed in six weeks. However, due to being seen in this production, Young received a telegram from Jim Sharman who wanted him to audition as Annas for Harry M. Miller&#x27;s original Australian production of the Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice rock musical &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. The show premiered in Sydney on 4 May 1972, and, as well as established theatrical performers, the cast featured leading pop-rock artists: Trevor White, Robin Ramsay, Jon English, Doug Parkinson, Stevie Wright (ex-The Easybeats), Marcia Hines and Reg Livermore. Young remained with the production until it closed in February 1974; the production broke theatrical attendance records in its two-year season, and whilst it provided him with a public profile, it left him at a loose end when it concluded.

For Young, a major break occurred at an Elm Tree performance when visiting producer and manager, Simon Napier-Bell, heard them in a pub in Newcastle in 1971. He persuaded Young to sign as a solo artist to Albert Productions—the company that had produced Australia&#x27;s top 1960s group The Easybeats. Napier-Bell then produced Young&#x27;s first hit single, &quot;Pasadena&quot;, at Armstrong Studios in Melbourne; it was co-written by George Young (also Scottish-born, but no relation) and Harry Vanda of The Easybeats, together with British actor David Hemmings who was a partner in Napier-Bell&#x27;s label, SNB Records. Vanda &amp; Young also produced AC/DC and other Albert Productions artists. All he had to do was sing over the demo tape Vanda/Young had sent from London. The single was released under the name, John Young, later releases used &quot;John Paul Young&quot; (Paul was his Catholic confirmation name) to avoid confusion with Johnny Young (no relation), the 1960s pop star and &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; (1971–1988 TV show) presenter. He performed the song on &quot;Happening 70&quot; on Channel Ten. &quot;Pasadena&quot; peaked at No. 16 in the Australian Singles charts in early 1972. It was followed by &quot;You Drive Me Crazy&quot; which was released in February 1973 but failed to chart.

Young renewed his association with Albert Productions, signing with them as a solo artist. Vanda &amp; Young had returned to Australia from UK in 1973. After his stint in &quot;Superstar&quot;, they took over as his producers and resumed writing songs for him. Young&#x27;s third single &quot;It&#x27;s Only Love&quot; was released in March 1974, but failed to chart in the top 50. The B side was a track called &quot;Bad Trip&quot;. Young said &quot;no one liked it. It was a disappointment. It was about suicide but they must&#x27;ve thought it was about drugs because of the title. It wasn&#x27;t banned or anything, they just didn&#x27;t play it.&quot; Young considered a part in the musical &quot;Godspell&quot; but decided against it, preferring to go back to sheet metal work. He left the job after a day and a half due to being hassled by the boss.

===1975–1977: Australian chart success===

In February 1975, Young released &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Hero&quot;, a song about the fleeting nature of pop stardom which drew on Vanda &amp; Young&#x27;s own experiences as former teen idols. The single shot into the national charts in April and gave Young his first top ten hit, reaching No. 8 on the Australian singles chart. The single sold strongly in the United States, where it reached No. 44 on the Cash Box Top 100 in February 1976. One of the key factors in the Australian success of &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Hero&quot; was the film clip made to promote it, which enabled the song to be given heavy exposure on &quot;Countdown&quot;, which had just switched to its new one-hour Sunday evening format, following the official start of colour TV broadcasting on 1 March 1975. Young&#x27;s debut performance on &quot;Countdown&quot; had him miming &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Hero&quot; while dressed in a sailor&#x27;s suit surrounded on an island stage with a studio audience of screaming teen girls. He was dragged off the stage three times by audience members and the microphone cord was ripped out but the song continued uninterrupted. ABC TV producer, Michael Shrimpton believes his show, &quot;Countdown&quot;, played a big part in making &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Hero&quot; and Young a teen pop success.

By mid-1975, &quot;Countdown&quot;″s talent co-ordinator, Ian &quot;Molly&quot; Meldrum, had started appearing on-screen with a weekly rock report. Young, as guest host, introduced Meldrum&#x27;s second report, &quot;Here&#x27;s boring old Molly with boring old humdrum&quot;.—&quot;Molly&quot; Meldrum&#x27;s &quot;Humdrum&quot; and &quot;Countdown&quot; continued until 1987, with Young often featured as a performer or guest host named &quot;Squeak&quot; or &quot;JPY&quot; by Meldrum. For touring purposes Young fronted John Paul Young and The All Stars, with members who had worked with Vanda and Young&#x27;s former bandmate Stevie Wright. The All Stars included, Warren Morgan (ex-Chain, Billy Thorpe &amp; the Aztecs) on piano and vocals, who co-wrote songs with Young. Other early members were, Kevin Borich (La De Da&#x27;s) on guitar, Johnny Dick (Max Merritt &amp; the Meteors, Billy Thorpe &amp; the Aztecs) on drums, Ronnie Peel (aka &quot;Rockwell T James&quot;, Missing Links, La De Da&#x27;s) on bass guitar and Ian Winter (Carson, Daddy Cool) on guitar. Billy Thorpe reportedly said they were the best rock band in Australia.

Throughout 1975, Young toured with Stevie Wright, Sherbet and Stylus, with the latter also being his backing band. Young headlined his first concert tour over the Christmas period of 1975–6, preferring to use local bands as their support acts.

Young&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Hero&quot; was released in October 1975 and peaked at No. 9 on the Australian Album charts. A string of top 10 hits, written and produced by Vanda &amp; Young, followed in Australia including &quot;The Love Game&quot; (peaked at No. 4 in September 1975), &quot;I Hate the Music&quot; (No. 2, April 1976) and &quot;I Wanna Do It with You&quot; (No. 7, May 1977). Young&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;J.P.Y.&quot; was released in August 1976 and also peaked at No. 9. In addition to his Australian success, Young achieved top 20 hit singles in Sweden, with &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Hero&quot; and &quot;I Hate the Music&quot;, and in South Africa where &quot;I Hate the Music&quot; and &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Hero&quot; were No. 1 hits, and &quot;Keep on Smilin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Do It with You&quot; were top ten hits. In May 1977, Young released his third studio album, &quot;Green&quot;, which peaked at No. 19.

In a 1976 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Young gives an insight into working with the Vanda/Young team: 

After I recorded &quot;Pasadena&quot; our relationship just developed. They play me their songs and say: &quot;See what you think of this.&quot; Usually I like it, sometimes I don&#x27;t. Sometimes I pick out something they&#x27;ve written and say &quot;I want to do this&quot;, like I did with &quot;Things to do&quot;. (For the &quot;JPY&quot; album), we worked out some of the songs on the road. Others are worked out in the studio and some, like &quot;Standing in the Rain&quot; are produced by the studio system. Harry and George work it out and I come in later to do the vocal.

In November 1977, Young&#x27;s first &#x27;best of&#x27; compilation was released, titled &quot;All the Best&quot;. It was preceded by the single &quot;Where the Action Is&quot; and both single and album peaked within the Australian top 40.

===1978–1980: International success and &quot;Love is In the Air&quot;===

Late in 1977, the European markets began playing &quot;Standing in the Rain&quot;, the B-Side for the song &quot;Keep on Smilin&#x27;&quot;. The song became a top 10 hit in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. selling over 400,000 copies.

Young&#x27;s next single, &quot;Love Is in the Air&quot;, became a worldwide hit during 1978, peaking at No. 3 on the Australian charts in May, No. 7 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and No. 5 in the UK singles chart.

The associated album, &quot;Love Is in the Air&quot; was released in October and reached the top 40 on the Australian albums chart. Subsequent singles, &quot;The Day That My Heart Caught Fire&quot; which peaked in the top 20, and &quot;Heaven Sent&quot; continued the disco style. Young was crowned &#x27;King of Pop&#x27; in October 1978. &quot;Love Is in the Air&quot; also won &#x27;Most Popular Australian Single&#x27; and Vanda &amp; Young won both &#x27;Best Australian Record Producer&#x27; and &#x27;Best Australian Songwriter&#x27; at the same awards.

Young&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Heaven Sent&quot; was released in November 1979 and peaked at number 95. By mid-1980 Young had left Albert Productions and ended his association with Vanda &amp; Young.

===1981–1990: Career decline and &quot;Classic Hits&quot;===

Young used session musicians for his 1960s&#x27; covers album, &quot;The Singer&quot; released in August 1981 but failed to reach the top 50. Young turned to a more contemporary electropop sound and adult oriented style. He signed to the Australian branch of German label I.C. Records in 1983 and flew to Germany with producer, composer and keyboard player John Capek (ex-Carson) to start recording a new album, with sessions at studios in Hanover, Munich, Los Angeles, Melbourne and Sydney. Most of the material was co-written by Capek and Canadian Marc Jordan. The resulting album, &quot;One Foot in Front&quot; was released in March 1984. The lead single, &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot;, peaked at No. 17 on the national singles chart, other singles &quot;War Games&quot;, &quot;L.A. Sunset&quot; and &quot;Call the Night&quot; (1984) all failed to chart into the top 50, &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; gained further prominence when it was picked as the theme song for the 1984 Summer Paralympics held in New York City, and also went on to be a hit in Germany.

On 25 January 1988 Young performed in the &#x27;Royal Command, New South Wales Bicentennial Concert&#x27; in front of the Prince and Princess of Wales at the Sydney Entertainment Centre. Televised across Australia, the event was viewed by over 10 million people and prompted an invitation to appear at World Expo 88 in Brisbane.

In late 1988, Young and his family moved to Lake Macquarie near Newcastle. Newcastle&#x27;s first FM radio station, New FM, was preparing to open in 1989 and Young was asked to head their All-Australian programme, &quot;Oz Made Mondays&quot;. The programme was successful with Young moving through the ranks of the station to Morning Announcer garnering four No. 1 rating spots for his &quot;Breakfast&quot; and &quot;Drive Time&quot; programmes along the way. A compilation album titled &quot;Classic Hits&quot; was released in 1988, including the new single &quot;Don&#x27;t Sing That Song&quot;, but failed to chart.

===1991–2003: Career revival, theatre, Olympic Games and Australian citizen===

In 1992, an Australian comedy film titled &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; was released. The film and associated soundtrack featured new versions of &quot;Love Is in the Air&quot; and &quot;Standing in the Rain&quot;, both of which were released as singles. &quot;Love Is in the Air&quot; peaked at No. 3 on the Australian Singles Charts and was a top 50 hit in the UK. In 1994 Young left 105.3 NEWFM in Newcastle and joined 2CH in Sydney, which only lasted six months.

On 4 November 1994, Young became a naturalised Australian citizen and received his papers from then Prime Minister, Paul Keating.

In 1996, Young released his eighth studio album and first since 1984. Titled &quot;Now&quot;, it is a covers album and includes a re-recording of &quot;Love Is in the Air&quot;. In 1997, Young made two trips to Germany following invitations to perform on a host of national and European television specials and to promote &quot;Now&quot;. Young returned to Germany in 1998 with The Allstar band for a month-long tour On returning to Australia Young joined the stage production of &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot; playing the role of Gus Sharkey (aka Phil Spector).

In 2000, he played to his largest audience as a featured performer at the closing ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics. Young was recorded on DVD for three songs at the &quot;Gimme Ted&quot; benefit concert held on 9 March 2001. From 8 August 2001, ABC-TV broadcast a six-part documentary, &quot;Long Way to the Top&quot; which chronicled 50 years of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll in Australia, Young featured in &quot;Episode 4: Berserk warriors 1973–1981&quot;. For the associated Long Way to the Top Tour in August–September 2002, Young re-formed the All-Star Band with Juan Gonzales on guitar, Warren Morgan on piano, Ronnie Peel on bass guitar, Greg Plimmer on drums and Michael Walker on synthesiser. From 12 October 2003, ABC broadcast, &quot;Love Is in the Air&quot;, a five-part documentary on Australian pop music with &quot;Episode 3: Strange Fruit&quot; describing &quot;Countdown&quot; and how Young was made into a pop star.

Young left the show in April, a spokesperson for the producers of &quot;Popstars Live&quot; denied that he had been sacked. In 2005 Young reprised his role as Gus Sharkey in the musical, &#x27;Leader of the Pack&#x27;.

Upon the announcement Young said, &quot;It&#x27;s an honour to be inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame, now point me to the lounge room, I wonder who&#x27;s in there.&quot; At the ceremony, Meldrum inducted Young who then performed, &quot;I Hate the Music&quot;, &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Hero&quot; and &quot;Love is in the Air&quot;.

<text>A Chinese writing brush () is a paintbrush used as a writing tool in Chinese calligraphy as well as in Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese which all have roots in Chinese calligraphy. They are also used in Chinese painting and other brush painting styles. The ink brush was invented in China around 300 B.C. Together with the inkstone, inkstick and Xuan paper, these four writing implements form the Four Treasures of the Study.

==Types==

Brushes differ greatly in terms of size, texture, material, and cost. The brush hair chosen depends on one&#x27;s needs at the moment; certain kinds of brushes are more suited to certain script styles and individuals than others. 
* Handle: usually of bamboo, exotic brushes may instead use such materials as gold, silver, jade, ivory, red sandalwood or spotted bamboo.
* Hair source: normally the brush is made from goat, Siberian weasel (, yellow-rat-wolf), pig, mouse, buffalo, wolf, or rabbit hair, while exotic ones can be made from tiger, fowl, deer, and even human hair (from a baby&#x27;s first haircut, said to bring good fortune while taking the imperial examinations).
* Hair texture: soft (), mixed (), or hard hair ().
*Hair size: generally classified as either big (, ), (, ), or small (, ); most calligraphy is written with a medium-sized brush. The smallest brushes are used for very small pieces and for fashioning designs for seals. While medium size brushes are the most widely used, wielded by a skilled artist a medium brush can produce a variety of thicknesses of line from very thin to fairly thick. The largest brushes are used only for very large pieces.
*Hair length: generally classified by hair length for thickness of handle as either long (), medium (), short (); most calligraphy is written with a medium-length hair brush. The long hair brush are more keep to hold an ink than the short hair brushes as their length. So, it used for continuous long or short stroke line scripting such as Japanese traditional &quot;hiragana&quot; style by &quot;renmen&quot; (). The hair of long hair brushes tend to be made by hard texture hair to keep their hair form, but there is a not one. Japanese very long and slender hair brushes called &quot;menso&quot;-burushes () are used for detail painting.

Synthetic hair is not traditionally used. Prices vary greatly depending on the quality of the brush; cheap brushes cost less than one US dollar while expensive brushes can cost more than a thousand dollars. Currently, the finest brushes are made in the town of Shanlian, in the Nanxun District, prefecture-level city of Huzhou, of Zhejiang province.

==History==
The earliest intact ink brush was found in 1954 in the tomb of a Chu citizen from the Warring States period (475–221 BCE) located in an archaeological dig site &quot;Zuo Gong Shan 15&quot; near Changsha (長沙). The early version of an ink brush found had a wooden stalk and a bamboo tube securing the bundle of hair to the stalk. Legend wrongly credits the invention of the ink brush to the later Qin general Meng Tian.

Traces of the writing brush, however, were discovered on the Shang jades, and were suggested to be the grounds of the oracle bone inscriptions.

The writing brush entered a new stage of development in the Han dynasty. First, it created the decoration craft of engraving and inlaying on the pen-holder. Second, some writings on the production of writing brush appeared. For example, the first monograph on the selection, production and function of writing brush was written by Cai Yong in the eastern Han dynasty . Third, the special form of &quot;hairpin white pen&quot; appeared. Officials in the Han dynasty often sharpened the end of the brush and stuck it in their hair or hat for their convenience. Worshipers also often put pen on their heads to show respect.

To The Yuan and Ming dynasty, Huzhou emerged a group of pen making experts to make it more convenient, such as Wu Yunhui, Feng Yingke, Lu Wenbao, Zhang Tianxi, etc. Huzhou has been the center of Chinese brush making since the Qing dynasty. At the same time, there was many famous brushes in other places, such as Ruyang Liu brush in Henan province, Li Dinghe brush in Shanghai, Wu Yunhui in Jiangxi province.

==Fudepen==
The fudepen, also known as a &quot;brush pen&quot;, is a modern Japanese invention analogous to a fountain pen. Today, Japanese companies such as Pentel and Sakura Color Products Corporation manufacture pens with tips resembling those of a small ink brush. These brush pens work almost identically to small ink brushes and can be used for most of the same purposes.

<text>Pierre d&#x27;Ailly (; ; 13519 August 1420) was a French theologian, astrologer and cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church.

==Academic career==
D&#x27;Ailly was born in Compiègne in 1350 or 1351 of a prosperous bourgeois family. He studied in Paris at the Collège de Navarre, receiving the licentiate in arts in 1367 and the master’s a year later, and was active in university affairs by 1372. D&#x27;Ailly taught the Bible in 1375 and the &quot;Sentences&quot; of Peter Lombard in 1376–1377, and received the licentiate and doctorate in theology in 1381. He was affiliated with the university, serving as rector in 1384; among his pupils were Jean Gerson and Nicholas of Clémanges.

The church&#x27;s Great Schism, between two popes, arose in 1378. In the spring of 1379, d&#x27;Ailly, in anticipation even of the decision of the University of Paris, had carried to the pope of Avignon, Clement VII, the &quot;role&quot; of the French nation. Notwithstanding this prompt adhesion, he was firm in his desire to put an end to the schism, and when, on 20 May 1381, the university decreed that the best means to this end was to gather together a general council, d&#x27;Ailly supported this motion before the king&#x27;s council in the presence of the Duke of Anjou. The dissatisfaction displayed shortly after by the government obliged the university to give up this scheme, and this was probably the cause of Pierre d&#x27;Ailly&#x27;s temporary retirement to Noyon, where he held a canonry. There he continued the struggle for his side in a humorous work, in which the partisans of the council are amusingly taken to task by the demon Leviathan.

D&#x27;Ailly returned to prominence by leading the university&#x27;s effort to secure removal of John Blanchard as chancellor, in which Blanchard was accused by d&#x27;Ailly before the Avignon antipope Clement VII of abuse of office. Subsequently, d&#x27;Ailly was twice entrusted with a mission to Clement VII in 1388 to defend the doctrines of the university, and especially those concerning the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin, against the preaching friar Jean de Montson, and in 1389 to petition in the name of the king for the canonization of the young cardinal Pierre de Luxembourg. The success which attended his efforts on these two occasions, and the eloquence which he displayed, perhaps contributed to his choice as the king&#x27;s almoner and confessor. At the same time, by means of an exchange, he obtained to the highest dignity in the university, becoming chancellor of Notre-Dame de Paris. This acceptability to many interests helps explain his advancement.

D&#x27;Ailly served as chancellor of the University from 1389 to 1395, and Gerson succeeded him. Both were involved in expelling the Dominican Order from the university for refusing to embrace the idea of the Immaculate Conception and in the effort mentioned above to end the Great Schism by means of an ecumenical council.

When Antipope Benedict XIII succeeded Clement VII at Avignon in 1394, d&#x27;Ailly was entrusted by the king with a mission of congratulation to the new pontiff. His obsequious language on this occasion, and the favours with which it was rewarded, formed a too violent contrast to the determined attitude of the university of Paris, which, tired of the schism, was even then demanding the resignation of the two pontiffs. D&#x27;Ailly himself had not long before taken part in the drawing up of a letter to the king in which the advantages of this double abdication were set forth, but since then his zeal had seemed to cool a little. Nevertheless, on his return from Avignon, he again in the presence of the king enlarged upon the advantages offered by the way which the university commended.

The suspicions aroused by his conduct found further confirmation when he caused himself—or allowed himself—to be nominated bishop of Le Puy by Benedict on 2 April 1395. The great number of benefices which he held left room for some doubt as to his disinterestedness. Henceforward he was under suspicion at the university, and was excluded from the assemblies where the union was discussed.

==Ecclesiastical career==

===Appointments===
D&#x27;Ailly&#x27;s ecclesiastical career prospered, however. After Le Puy, he was appointed Bishop of Noyon, and Bishop of Cambrai (1397). By virtue of this position, he became also a prince of the Holy Roman Empire. In order to take possession of his new episcopal see, he had to brave the wrath of Philip, Duke of Burgundy, override the resistance of the clergy and bourgeoisie, and even withstand an armed attack on the part of several lords; but his protector, the duke of Orleans, had his investiture performed by Wenceslaus, king of the Romans. The latter, though a partisan of the pope of Rome, took the opportunity of enjoining on d&#x27;Ailly to go in his name and argue with the pope of Avignon, a move which had as its object to persuade Benedict to an abdication, the necessity of which was becoming more and more evident. However, the language of d&#x27;Ailly seems on this occasion to have been lacking in decision; however that may be, it led to no felicitous result. From this point on, he spent most of his energy to addressing the schism. Although he was slow at first to embrace the conciliar solution to the Schism, he was participating in councils by 1409.

===Schismatic pressures===
France next tried to bring violent pressure to bear to conquer the obstinacy of Benedict XIII by threatening a formal withdrawal from his obedience. D&#x27;Ailly, who, in spite of his attachment to the pope, had been carried away by the example of the kingdom, was among the first who, in 1403, after experience of what had happened, counselled and celebrated the restoration of obedience. He was sent by Charles VI on an embassy to Benedict and seized this opportunity of lavishing on the pontiff friendly congratulations mingled with useful advice. Two years later, before the same pontiff, he preached in the city of Genoa a sermon which led to the general institution, in the countries of the obedience of Avignon, of the festival of the Holy Trinity.

At the ecclesiastical council which took place at Paris in 1406, d&#x27;Ailly made every effort to avert a new withdrawal from the obedience and, by order of the king, took the part of defender of Benedict XIII, a course which yet again exposed him to attacks from the university party. The following year he and his disciple Gerson formed part of the great embassy sent by the princes to the two pontiffs, and while in Italy he was occupied in praiseworthy but vain efforts to induce the pope of Rome to remove himself to a town on the Italian coast, in the neighbourhood of his rival, where it was hoped that the double abdication would take place. Discouraged by his failure to effect this, he returned to his diocese of Cambrai at the beginning of 1408. At this time he was still faithful to Benedict, and the disinclination he felt to joining the members of the French clergy who were on the point of ratifying the royal declaration of neutrality excited the anger of Charles VI&#x27;s government, and a mandate, which was however not executed, ordered the arrest of the bishop.

===Conciliar councils===
It was not until after the cardinals of the two colleges had led to the convocation of the Council of Pisa (1409) that d&#x27;Ailly renounced his support of Benedict XIII, and, for want of a better policy, again allied himself with the cause which he had championed in his youth. In the council lay now, to judge from his words, the only chance of salvation; and, in view of the requirements of the case, he began to argue that, in case of schism, a council could be convoked by any one of the faithful, and would have the right to judge and even to depose the rival pontiffs. This was, in fact, the procedure of the council of Pisa, in which d&#x27;Ailly took part. After the declaration of the deposition of the Roman pope Gregory XII and Benedict XIII, the council went on to elect Alexander V (26 June 1409). This pope reigned only ten months; his successor, John XXIII, raised d&#x27;Ailly to the rank of cardinal (6 June 1411), and further, to indemnify him for the loss of the bishopric of Cambrai, conferred upon him the administration of that of Limoges (3 November 1412), which was shortly after exchanged for the bishopric of Orange. He also nominated d&#x27;Ailly as his legate in Germany (18 March 1413).

Forgetting these benefits, d&#x27;Ailly was one of the most formidable adversaries of John XXIII at the Council of Constance (1414–1418); with Gerson, d&#x27;Ailly was one of the leading theologians at the council. Convinced as he was of the necessity for union and reform, he contributed more than anyone to the adoption of the principle that, since the schism had survived the Council of Pisa, it was necessary again to take up the work for a fundamental union, without considering the rights of John XXIII any more than they had those of Gregory XII and Benedict XIII. From this point of view d&#x27;Ailly, together with his compatriot Cardinal Fillastre, took the preponderating part during the first few months. Afterwards, seeing the trend of events, he showed some uneasiness and hesitation. He refused, however, to undertake the defence of John XXIII, and only appeared in the trial of this pope to make depositions against him, which were sometimes of an overwhelming character.

Other matters which claimed his attention at Constance included the condemnation of John Wycliffe and the trial of Jan Hus. The reading in public of his two treatises &quot;De Potestate ecclesiastica&quot; and &quot;De Reformatione Ecclesiae&quot; revealed, besides ideas very peculiar to himself on the reform and constitution of the church, his design of reducing the power of the English in the council by denying them the right of forming a separate nation (1 October1 November 1416). By this campaign, which exposed him to the worst retaliation of the English, he inaugurated his role of &quot;procurator and defender of the king of France.&quot;

When at last the question arose of giving the Christian world a new pope, this time sole and uncontested, d&#x27;Ailly defended the right of the cardinals, if not to keep the election entirely in their own hands, at any rate to share in the election, and he brought forward a system for reconciling the pretensions of the council with the rights of the College of Cardinals. In this way was elected Pope Martin V (11 November 1417), and the task of d&#x27;Ailly was at last finished.

==Retirement==
After the council, d&#x27;Ailly returned to Paris. When in France&#x27;s civil discord the Burgundian faction seized Paris in 1419, killing some professors in the process, he fled south and retired to Avignon. His former pupil Gerson settled nearby at a house of the Celestine Order. D&#x27;Ailly, known as the Cardinal of Cambrai, died in 1420 in Avignon.

==Writings==

D&#x27;Ailly wrote extensively on the Schism, reform, astrology and other topics. His ideas on the powers of the college of cardinals and the infallibility of the general council were very influential. D&#x27;Ailly&#x27;s &quot;Imago Mundi&quot; (1410), a work of cosmography, influenced Christopher Columbus in his estimates of the size of the world. Many questions in science and astrology, such as calendar reform, attracted his attention. His views on astrology, expressed in several works, attempted to balance divine omniscience and human free will. D&#x27;Ailly&#x27;s writings on the Schism put the crisis and the need for reform into an apocalyptic context. His astrology also was tied to the Schism, attempting to determine whether the division of the church was a sign of the coming of the Antichrist. His works began appearing in print before the end of the fifteenth century.

==Legacy==
In &quot;The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon&quot;, Karl Marx falsely claimed that d&#x27;Ailly had told advocates of ethical reform at the Council of Constance, &quot;Only the devil in person can still save the Catholic Church, and you ask for angels.&quot;

The crater Aliacensis on the Moon is named after him.

<text>The British and Foreign Bible Society, often known in England and Wales as simply the Bible Society, is a non-denominational Christian Bible society with charity status whose purpose is to make the Bible available throughout the world.

The Society was formed on 7 March 1804 by a group of people including William Wilberforce and Thomas Charles to encourage the &quot;wider circulation and use&quot; of the Scriptures.

Bibles published by the BFBS have on their front page as publisher&#x27;s name the BFBS&#x27;s name translated into the text&#x27;s language, e.g. &quot;Société biblique britannique et étrangère&quot; on Louis Segond&#x27;s French Bible or &quot;Brita kaj Alilanda Biblia Societo&quot; on the Esperanto bible compiled from L. L. Zamenhof&#x27;s papers after the latter&#x27;s death.

== History ==

The British and Foreign Bible Society dates back to 1804 when a group of Christians, associated with the Religious Tract Society, sought to address the problem of a lack of affordable Bibles in Welsh for Welsh-speaking Christians. Many young girls had walked long distances to Thomas Charles to get copies of the Bible. Later the story was told of one of them – a young girl called Mary Jones who walked over 20 miles to get a Bible in Bala, Gwynedd.

BFBS was not the first Bible Society in the world. The first organisation in Britain to be called &quot;The Bible Society&quot; was founded in 1779: it still exists and is called the Naval &amp; Military Bible Society.

The first BFBS translation project was the Gospel of John into Mohawk for Canada in 1804. In the British Isles BFBS reprinted Bibles in Welsh, Scots Gaelic and Manx Gaelic first produced by the SPCK. The first Romani translation was the Gospel of Luke into the Caló language of Iberia.

A report in the 13 November 1824 edition of the &quot;Buffalo Emporium and General Advertiser (NY)&quot;, stated that the BFBS &quot;since its establishment, has distributed 1,723,251 Bibles, and 2,529,114 Testamentsmaking a total of 4,252,365.&quot;

From the early days, the Society sought to be ecumenical and non-sectarian. The Controversy in 1825–26 about the Apocrypha and the Metrical Psalms resulted in the secession of the Glasgow and Edinburgh Bible Societies, which later formed what is now the Scottish Bible Society. This and another similar 1831 controversy about Unitarians holding significant Society offices resulted in a minority separating to form the Trinitarian Bible Society.

The Bible Society extended its work to England, India, Europe and beyond. Protestant communities in many European countries (such as Croatia and Albania) date back to the work of nineteenth-century BFBS Bible salesmen. Auxiliary branches were set up all over the world, which later became Bible Societies in their own right, and today operate in co-operation as part of the United Bible Societies. The Bible Society is a non-denominational Christian network which works to translate, revise, print, and distribute affordable Bibles in England and Wales.

A newspaper article in the 15 March 1879 edition of &quot;The Gazette (Montreal)&quot;, noted that the total circulation by the BFBS &quot;has been 82,000,000...during the last seventy-five years&quot; (since 1804). By 1909 it had issued 215,000,000 copies of the Bible.

During World War One the Bible Society distributed more than nine million copies of Scripture, in over 80 languages, to combatants and prisoners of war on all sides of the war. The Bible Society managed this despite immense challenges – supply shortages, rising paper costs, paper rationing, submarine blockades and the sinking of merchant shipping.

Even greater than these physical difficulties was the emotional toll – former colleagues suddenly found themselves fighting on opposing sides. Bible salesmen throughout Europe were conscripted or volunteered into their respective armies. The Bible Society responded to the challenge. They printed New Testaments bound in khaki, stamped with a cross, for distribution via the Red Cross among sick and wounded soldiers, sailors and prisoners of war.

On average between 6–7,000 volumes were sent out every working day for fighting men, the sick and wounded, the prisoners of war, exiles and refugees. That&#x27;s over four copies distributed each minute, day and night, for the duration of the war.

Translation work never stopped – between August 1914 and November 1918, the Bible Society printed Scriptures in 34 new languages and dialects. This meant on average there was one new version every seven weeks during the whole period of war.

For many years the headquarters of the society was in London; in 1972 its address was 146, Queen Victoria Street, E.C.4. By 1972 it had published or distributed whole Bibles or parts of the Bible in 1,431 languages. At that time it was distributing 173 million copies each year.

== The Society today ==
The Society is working to circulate the Scriptures across the world, in the church and through the culture.

The strategy of the Bible Society centres on Bible availability, accessibility and credibility - what it calls the &#x27;lifecycle&#x27; of the Bible. These strategic approaches encompass all of its activity: translation, production, distribution, literacy, engagement and advocacy.

*Translation: making the Bible available in languages without the Scriptures, and revising existing Bibles to bring the language up-to-date, so that everyone can experience the Scriptures in their mother tongue. Translation is into spoken and signed languages;
*Production: printing physical copies of the Bible and producing Scriptures in different formats such as print, audio, and digital forms in order to meet the demands of the millions around the world who want a Bible of their own;
*Distribution: taking the Bible to places where it might otherwise be hard to come by, in formats that people can use;
*Literacy: helping people to read and to read well, using the Bible as a resource
*Engagement: helping people grapple with the Bible, read and respond to it wisely;
*Advocacy: giving the wider culture a reason and opportunity to encounter the joys of the Bible.

To these aims the Society was the original publisher of translations the Bible into several contemporary languages, among which Louis Segond&#x27;s French Bible (1910) and L. L. Zamenhof&#x27;s Bible in Esperanto (1926).

The Bible Society has by far the largest collection of Bibles in the world, with about 39,000 items. It includes its Chinese Collection which is the largest collection of Chinese Scriptures anywhere in the world. Since the society&#x27;s move to Swindon in 1985 the library has been located in the library of the University of Cambridge.

== Where the Society works ==

The Society&#x27;s mission is global. Its work is organised into two categories: domestic and international.

The Society is part of an international fellowship of over 140 Bible Societies around the world, known as the United Bible Societies. Its entire international programme is delivered on the ground through the close relationship they have with each of their fellow Bible Societies.

<text>Prince Mikheil &quot;Mikhako&quot; G. Tsereteli also known as Michael von Zereteli () (December 23, 1878 – March 2, 1965) was a Georgian prince, historian, philologist, sociologist and public benefactor. At different times he was a Marxist, an anarchist, and a nationalist. He is recognized as National Hero of Georgia.

== Life ==
He was born in 1878, in a village Tskhrukveti (Imereti region of Western Georgia). His father was Prince Giorgi Tsereteli. His brother Vasil Tsereteli (1862–1938) was a famous Georgian physician, writer and public benefactor.

In 1911 Mikheil Tsereteli graduated from Heidelberg University (Germany), and received a PhD degree in history in 1913. From 1914 to 1918, he was associate professor at Berlin University and Chairman of the Committee of Independent Georgia. In 1916 Tsereteli was a representative of Georgia in the Union of Nations in Lausanne, and in 1918-1919 Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Georgia (DRG) in Sweden and Norway.

From 1919 to 1921, Tsereteli was a professor at the Tbilisi State University (TSU).

On February 25, 1921, Georgia was occupied by Soviet Russia, and the following month Mikheil Tsereteli went into exile to Western Europe.

From 1921 to 1933 Tsereteli was a professor at the University of Brussels (Belgium), and from 1933 to 1945 a professor at Berlin University. After 1945, he lived and worked in Munich.

In the 1930s and 1940s, he was a Chairman of the &quot;Georgian National Committee&quot; (Berlin-Paris).

Prince Tsereteli was a member of the editorial board of the journal &quot;Bedi Kartlisa – Revue de Kartvelologie&quot; (Paris).

Main fields of academic activity of Prof. Tsereteli were: Sumerology, history of Georgia and the Caucasus, history of Ibero-Caucasian civilization, Rustvelology (Shota Rustaveli was a great Georgian Poet of the 12th century), the rights of the Nations (Peoples), sociology, etc. He was author of more than 80 scientific-research works (among them about 10 monographs).

Mikheil Tsereteli died in 1965, in Munich. He is buried in Leuville-sur-Orge (France). In 2013, he was posthumously awarded the title and Order of National Hero of Georgia.

<doc id="581826" wikidata="Q6658540" url="?curid=581826" title="Liverpool Protestant Party">
<text>The Liverpool Protestant Party (LPP) was a minor political party operating in the city of Liverpool in northwest England.

==Origins and context==
The origins of the Liverpool Protestant Party lie in the increasing dissatisfaction with the Conservative and Unionist Party felt by many Orange Lodge members and other militant Protestants in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries.

This unease was caused by a number of issues:

# The use of the Conservative whip in Parliament to oppose the extension of factory inspection to convent laundries
# The Education Act 1902 making public money available to Catholic schools (&quot;Rome on the Rates&quot;)
# The failure to enact a new Church Discipline Act, or amend the old one, to provide for a more effective counter to extreme ritualism in the Church of England.

Large scale Irish migration, especially by Irish Catholics, to Liverpool had seen the city&#x27;s Roman Catholic population greatly increase. The Liverpool Protestant Party fiercely opposed the construction of a cathedral for the Catholic community of Liverpool. The first attempt to secure independent Protestant representation was made by John Kensit, leader of the Protestant Truth Society, who stood for election to the House of Commons in Brighton in 1898. In Ireland, this unease manifested itself in the creation of the Independent Orange Order in Belfast in Ulster in 1902.

==Formation==
There was disquiet due to the reluctance of the Conservative-controlled Liverpool Corporation to set aside areas of public open space specifically for outdoor meetings. George Wise, a prominent local Protestant leader, had been imprisoned for refusing to be bound over to keep the peace following disturbances at meetings held in public squares and gardens. On his release from Walton Gaol on 6 June he decided to pursue independent Protestant representation on the city council.

Support was centred among Wise&#x27;s adherents, including large numbers of members of the Orange Order and the congregation of the Protestant Reformers Church of which he was the Pastor. Traditionally the &quot;Orange vote&quot; would go to the Conservatives but in 1903, the LPP was formed as a distinct party by George Wise.

==1903 to 1919==
Four seats were contested and three won, including Kirkdale. Representation was also secured on the West Derby Board of Guardians, which supervised health care and poor relief in the North and East of the city. Some rapprochement with the Conservatives took place before World War I through co-operation to fight the Irish Home Rule Bill, although the Conservative leader in the city, Alderman Archibald Salvidge, was opposed to independent Protestant representation.

==1920–1930==
The support of the Conservative Party for the establishment of the Irish Free State renewed dissatisfaction with them amongst militant Protestants. In Liverpool this was manifested in a loss of membership in the Conservative Workingmen&#x27;s Association. The Liverpool Protestant Party believed the establishment of the Irish Free State was a mere stepping stone to an Irish republic.
The National Protestant Electoral Federation (NPEF) was formed at this time with four aims:-

# The promotion of the study of Protestantism 
# The maintenance of the Protestant succession to the throne (as established by the Act of Settlement 1701)
# To assist the return of robust Protestants, irrespective of party, as representatives on public bodies
# To protect the interests of Protestant workers in Trade unions

In Liverpool the policies of the NPEF were put into effect for the 1922 elections to the Boards of Guardians. The NPEF endorsed Protestant Party candidates and any other candidates who were willing to add the word Protestant to their party name. This resulted in two Protestant Party and two Protestant &amp; Unionist candidates being elected with 25,787 votes between them.

==1930 to 1945==
The Local Government Act 1929 abolished the Boards of Guardians and handed their responsibilities to local authorities. Liverpool Corporation took over three Boards – West Derby for the North and East of the city, Liverpool for the City Centre and Toxteth Park for the South. Some rationalisation of the various hospital and other facilities took place which meant that the Liverpool Board of Guardians facility at Brownlow Hill became redundant. The city council decided to sell the site to the Archdiocese of Liverpool in order for the archdiocese to build a Catholic cathedral. Sales of redundant land and property to Catholic interests had been blocked by Protestant representatives on the Boards, but under the council the sale went ahead with Conservative approval.

This led to the Protestant Party contesting the City Council elections of November 1930. Only the party leader Harry Dixon Longbottom was successful, in St Domingo, but in several wards the Protestant Party took enough votes from the Conservatives to cause them to lose them to Labour.

It opposed the emergent socialist politics of the Labour movement and called for curbs on immigration into Great Britain from Roman Catholic areas of Ireland. It also blamed Irish immigrants for unemployment, poor housing and high rates.

It primarily fought local government seats, but did stand the Reverend H. D. Longbottom in the Liverpool Kirkdale seat for Westminster elections from 1931 until 1945. In 1931, he took a quarter of the votes cast.

== 1945–1974 ==
For all but one year – 1963 – between 1945 and 1970, the Protestant Party was the third largest party on the council, in terms of seat share. The party tended to stand in the northern St. Domingo and Netherfield wards, unopposed by the Conservatives, and in return voted with them on most issues in the council chamber. The party also held one Aldermanic seat on the council from 1945 to 1957. It won its last seat in 1973, but activity was waning and, as the &quot;Orange vote&quot; subsided in influence, the LPP found it harder to continue.

Following the Local Government Act 1972, Liverpool City Council faced ward redistribution. In 1974, the Protestant Party was disbanded, with most of their members joining the Conservatives.

==Legacy==

The &quot;Orange vote&quot; has not totally died in Liverpool. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has looked into the possibility of establishing a branch in Liverpool, possibly considering standing local government candidates there as well. Former members of the LPP have been involved with this attempt.

<text>In the music of Ireland, Irish rebel songs are folk songs which are primarily about the various rebellions against British Crown rule. Songs about prior rebellions are a popular topic of choice among musicians which supported Irish nationalism and republicanism. 

When they discuss events during the 20th and 21st centuries, Irish rebel songs focus on physical force Irish republicanism in the context of the Easter Rising, the Irish War of Independence, the Anti-Treaty IRA during the Irish Civil War, and, more recently, the Troubles in Northern Ireland.

==History==
The tradition of rebel music in Ireland date back to the period of English (and later British) crown rule, and describe historical events in Irish history such as rebellions against the Crown and reinforcing a desire for self-determination among the Irish people and the Irish diaspora.

As well as a deep-rooted sense of tradition, rebel songs have nonetheless remained contemporary, and since the end of the Irish Civil War in 1923, the focus has moved onto the nationalist cause in Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State, including support for the Anti-Treaty IRA, the Provisional IRA, the INLA, and Sinn Féin. However, the subject matter is not confined to Irish history, and includes the exploits of the Connolly Column, who fought for the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War, and also those who participated in the American Civil War. There are also some songs that express sorrow over war (from a Republican perspective), such as &quot;Only our rivers run free&quot;, and some have been covered by bands that have tweaked lyrics to be explicitly anti-war, such as the cover of &quot;The Patriot Game&quot; by Scottish band The Bluebells.

Over the years, a number of bands have performed &quot;crossover&quot; music, that is, Irish rebel lyrics and instrumentation mixed with other, more pop styles. Damien Dempsey is known for his pop-influenced rebel ballads and bands like Beltaine&#x27;s Fire and Kneecap combine Rebel music with Political hip hop and other genres.

=== Contemporary music ===
Irish rebel music has occasionally gained international attention. The Wolfe Tones&#x27; version of &quot;A Nation Once Again&quot; was voted the number one song in the world by BBC World Service listeners in 2002. Many of the more popular acts recently such as , , Athenrye, Shebeen, and are from Glasgow. The Bog Savages of San Francisco are fronted by an escapee from Belfast&#x27;s Long Kesh prison who made his break in the September 1983 &quot;Great Escape&quot; by the IRA.

Music of this genre has often courted controversy with some of this music effectively banned from the airwaves in the Republic of Ireland in the 1980s. More recently, Derek Warfield&#x27;s music was banned from Aer Lingus flights, after the Ulster Unionist politician Roy Beggs Jr compared his songs to the speeches of Osama bin Laden. However, a central tenet of the justification for rebel music from its supporters is that it represents a long-standing tradition of freedom from tyranny.

Themes include &quot;Arbour Hill&quot;, about the place; &quot;Fergal O&#x27;Hanlon&quot;, about the man; &quot;Northern Gaels&quot;/&quot;Crumlin Jail&quot;, about the prison; &quot;The Ballad of Mairead Farrell&quot;, about the woman; &quot;Seán Treacy&quot;, about the man; and &quot;Pearse Jordan&quot;, about the man.

On the occasion of his being the first Irish actor to win the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role in 2024 for &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;, Cillian Murphy quipped &quot;It means a lot to me to be Irish. I don&#x27;t know what else to say – should I sing a rebel song?&quot;.

==Sunday Bloody Sunday (U2 song)==

The 1983 U2 album &quot;War&quot; includes the song &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;, a lament for the Northern Ireland troubles whose title alludes to the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting of Catholic demonstrators by British soldiers. In concert, Bono began introducing the song with the disclaimer &quot;this song is &quot;not&quot; a rebel song&quot;. These words are included in the version on &quot;Under a Blood Red Sky&quot;, the 1983 live album of the War Tour. The 1988 concert film &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; includes a performance hours after the 1987 Remembrance Day bombing in Enniskillen, which Bono condemns in a mid-song rant.
In response, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor released a song with the title &quot;This is a Rebel Song&quot;, as she explains in her live album &quot;How About I Be Me (And You Be You)?&quot;

==Satire==
* During the 1990s, Irish comedian Dermot Morgan lampooned both the Wolfe Tones and the clichés of Irish rebel songs by singing about the martyrdom of Fido, an Alsatian dog who saves his IRA master in the Irish War of Independence. During a search of the house by the Black and Tans, Fido hides his master&#x27;s hand grenade by eating it. When Fido farts and the grenade explodes, the British comment: &quot;Excuse me, mate, was there something your dog ate?!&quot; In a parody of Thomas Osborne Davis&#x27; famous rebel song &quot;A Nation Once Again&quot;, the song climaxes with the words: &quot;Another martyr for old Ireland, by Britannia cruelly slain! I hope that somewhere up there I hope he&#x27;ll be an Alsatian once again! An Alsatian once again! An Alsatian once again! That Fido who&#x27;s now in ribbons will be an Alsatian once again!&quot;
* Irish-American actor and comedian Denis Leary engaged in a similarly brutal mockery of rebel songs and their cliches in &quot;Traditional Irish Song&quot;.

<text>Edward Hincks (19 August 1792 – 3 December 1866) was an Irish clergyman, best remembered as an Assyriologist and one of the decipherers of Mesopotamian cuneiform. He was one of the three men known as the &quot;holy trinity of cuneiform&quot;, with Sir Henry Creswicke Rawlinson and Jules Oppert.

==Early life==
Edward Hincks was born in Cork on 19 August 1792. He was the eldest son of the Rev. Thomas Dix Hincks, a distinguished Protestant minister, orientalist and naturalist. Edward was an elder brother of Sir Francis Hincks, a prominent Canadian politician who was also sometime Governor of Barbados, and William Hincks, the first Professor of Natural History at Queen&#x27;s College, Cork, and afterwards University College, Toronto.

Edward Hincks was educated at home by his father and at Midleton College before entering Trinity College Dublin. He was elected a Scholar of the College in 1810, and in 1812 won the Gold Medal and Bishop Law&#x27;s Prize for Mathematics. Standing against Thomas Romney Robinson, he won through and was elected a Fellow of the College in 1813 and four years later took his M.A. In 1819, following the death of Thomas Meredith, he was presented to the Rectory of Ardtrea in County Tyrone. Though Ardtrea was a valuable and highly prized Rectory, it was also isolated for a young bachelor and he resigned the position in 1826, taking up the Rectory in Killyleagh, County Down – an office he was to hold for the remainder of his life.

The undemanding nature of his clerical duties left him with more than enough time to pursue his interest in ancient languages. His first love was for the hieroglyphic writing of ancient Egypt. By 1823 the Frenchman Jean-Francois Champollion had succeeded in deciphering this enigmatic script, but Hincks made a number of discoveries of his own which established him as an authority of ancient philology.

==Writing==
In the 1830s he turned his attention to Old Persian cuneiform, a form of writing that the Achaemenid emperors had used for monumental inscriptions in their own language. Working independently of the leading Orientalist of the day, Sir Henry Creswicke Rawlinson, Hincks deduced the essentially syllabic nature of this script and correctly deduced the values of the Persian vowels.

In 1835 he supervised the unrolling of the mummified body of Takabuti at the Belfast Natural History Society. Hincks deciphered the Egyptian hieroglyphs, which revealed that she was mistress of a great house.

In 1839 and 1846 he published on Egyptian Chronology, identifying Thutmose III, who Manetho called Memphres, with Menophres, who Theon of Alexandria had said reigned at the start of the Egyptian Great Year – a reference to what is known as the &quot;Era of Menophres&quot;.

==Achievements==
Hincks&#x27; greatest achievement was the decipherment of the ancient language and writing of Babylon and Assyria: Akkadian cuneiform but his attention might never have been drawn to the relatively new topic of Assyriology had it not been for a lucky find during 1842.

During that year the archaeologist Paul Émile Botta uncovered the remains of the ancient city of Nineveh, the capital of the Assyrian Empire. Among the treasures unearthed by Botta and his successors, including Austen Henry Layard, with whom Hincks exchanged many letters, was the famous Library of Assurbanipal, a royal archive containing tens of thousands of baked clay tablets. These tablets were inscribed in a strange illegible form of writing known as cuneiform. Three men were to play a decisive role in the decipherment of this script: Hincks, Rawlinson and a young German-born scholar called Jules Oppert.

Hincks deduced correctly that cuneiform writing had been invented by one of the earliest civilisations of Mesopotamia (a people later identified by Oppert as the Sumerians), who then bequeathed it to later states such as Babylon, Assyria and Elam. In 1848 he was awarded the Cunningham Medal of the Royal Irish Academy for his achievements.

By 1850 Hincks had come to a number of important conclusions regarding the nature of Assyro-Babylonian cuneiform. He believed that the script was essentially syllabic, comprising open syllables (e.g. &quot;ab&quot; or &quot;ki&quot;) as well as more complex closed syllables (e.g. &quot;mur&quot;). He also discovered that cuneiform characters were &quot;polyphonic,&quot; by which he meant that a single sign could have several different readings depending on the context in which it occurred.

By now Hincks had recognised a large number of determinatives and had correctly established their readings. But not everyone was convinced by the claims being made by the Irishman and his distinguished colleagues. Some philologists even suggested that they were simply inventing multiple readings of the signs to suit their own translations.

In 1857 the versatile English Orientalist William Henry Fox Talbot suggested that an undeciphered cuneiform text be given to several different Assyriologists to translate. If, working independently of one another, they came up with reasonably similar translations, it would surely dispel the doubts surrounding their claims.

As it happened, Talbot and the &quot;holy trinity of cuneiform&quot; – Hincks, Rawlinson and Oppert – were in London in 1857. Edwin Norris, secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society, gave each of them a copy of a recently discovered inscription from the reign of the Assyrian emperor Tiglath-Pileser I. A jury of experts was empanelled to examine the resulting translations and assess their accuracy.

In all essential points the translations produced by the four scholars were found to be in close agreement with one another. There were of course some slight discrepancies. The inexperienced Talbot had made a number of mistakes, and Oppert&#x27;s translation contained a few doubtful passages due to his unfamiliarity with the English language. But Hincks&#x27; and Rawlinson&#x27;s versions were virtually identical. The jury declared itself satisfied, and the decipherment of cuneiform was adjudged a &quot;fait accompli&quot;.

The Reverend Edward Hincks devoted the remaining years of his life to the study of cuneiform and made further significant contributions to its decipherment. He died at his rectory in Killyleagh on 3 December 1866 at the age of 74. He was survived by a wife and four daughters.

<text>The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket, written in 1838, is the only complete novel by the American writer Edgar Allan Poe. The work relates the tale of the young Arthur Gordon Pym, who stows away aboard a whaler called the &quot;Grampus&quot;. Various adventures and misadventures befall Pym, including shipwreck, mutiny, and cannibalism, before he is saved by the crew of the &quot;Jane Guy&quot;. Aboard this vessel, Pym and a sailor named Dirk Peters continue their adventures farther south. Docking on land, they encounter hostile, black-skinned natives before escaping back to the ocean. The novel ends abruptly as Pym and Peters continue toward the South Pole.

The story starts out as a fairly conventional adventure at sea, but it becomes increasingly strange and hard to classify. Poe, who intended to present a realistic story, was inspired by several real-life accounts of sea voyages, and drew heavily from J. N. Reynolds and referenced the Hollow Earth theory. He also drew from his own experiences at sea. Analyses of the novel often focus on possible autobiographical elements as well as its portrayal of race and the symbolism in the final lines of the work.

Difficulty in finding literary success early in his short story-writing career inspired Poe to pursue writing a longer work. A few serialized installments of &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot; were first published in the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot;, though never completed. The full novel was published in July 1838 in two volumes. Some critics responded negatively to the work for being too gruesome and for cribbing heavily from other works, while others praised its exciting adventures. Poe himself later called it &quot;a very silly book&quot;. The novel later influenced Herman Melville and Jules Verne.

==Plot summary==
The book comprises a preface, 25 chapters, and an afterword, with a total of around 72,000 words.

===On board the &quot;Ariel&quot; (Chapter I)===

Arthur Gordon Pym was born on the island of Nantucket, famous for its fishing harbor and whaling. His best friend, Augustus Barnard, is the son of the captain of a whaling ship. One night, the two boys become drunk and decide, on Augustus&#x27;s whim, to take advantage of the breeze and sail out on Pym&#x27;s sailboat, the &quot;Ariel&quot;. The breeze, however, turns out to be the beginnings of a violent storm. The situation gets critical when Augustus passes out drunk, and the inexperienced Pym must take control of the dinghy. The &quot;Ariel&quot; is overtaken by the &quot;Penguin&quot;, a returning whaling ship. Against the captain&#x27;s wishes, the crew of the &quot;Penguin&quot; turns back to search for and rescue both Augustus and Pym. After they are safely back on land, they decide to keep this episode a secret from their parents.

===On board the &quot;Grampus&quot; (Chapters II – XIII)===
His first ocean misadventure does not dissuade Pym from sailing again; rather, his imagination is ignited by the experience. His interest is further fueled by the tales of a sailor&#x27;s life that Augustus tells him. Pym decides to follow Augustus as a stowaway aboard the &quot;Grampus&quot;, a whaling vessel commanded by Augustus&#x27;s father that is bound for the southern seas. Augustus helps Pym by preparing a hideout in the hold for him and smuggling Tiger, Pym&#x27;s faithful dog, on board. Augustus promises to provide Pym with water and food until the ship is too far from shore to return, at which time Pym will reveal himself.

Due to the stuffy atmosphere and vapors in the dark and cramped hold, Pym becomes increasingly comatose and delirious over the days. He can&#x27;t communicate with Augustus, and the promised supplies fail to arrive, so Pym runs out of water. In the course of his ordeal, he discovers a letter written in blood attached to his dog Tiger, warning Pym to remain hidden, as his life depends on it.

Augustus finally sets Pym free, explaining the mysterious message, as well as his delay in retrieving his friend: a mutiny had erupted on the whaling ship. Part of the crew was slaughtered by the mutineers, while another group, including Augustus&#x27;s father, were set adrift in a small boat. Augustus survived because he had befriended one of the mutineers, Dirk Peters, who now regrets his part in the uprising.

Peters, Pym, and Augustus hatch a plan to seize control of the ship: Pym, whose presence is unknown to the mutineers, will wait for a storm and then dress in the clothes of a recently dead sailor, masquerading as a ghost. In the confusion sure to break out among the superstitious sailors, Peters and Augustus, helped by Tiger, will take over the ship again. Everything goes according to plan, and soon the three men are masters of the &quot;Grampus&quot;: all the mutineers are killed or thrown overboard except one, Richard Parker, whom they spare to help them run the vessel. (At this point, the dog Tiger disappears from the novel; his unknown fate is a loose end in the narrative.)
The storm increases in force, breaking the mast, tearing the sails and flooding the hold. All four manage to survive by lashing themselves to the hull. As the storm abates, they find themselves safe for the moment, but without provisions. Over the following days, the men face death by starvation and thirst.

They sight an erratically moving Dutch ship with a grinning red-capped seaman on deck, nodding in apparent greeting as they approach. Initially delighted with the prospect of deliverance, they quickly become horrified as they are overcome with an awful stench. They soon realize that the apparently cheerful sailor is, in fact, a corpse propped up in the ship&#x27;s rigging, his &quot;grin&quot; a result of his partially decomposed skull moving as a seagull feeds upon it. As the ship passes, it becomes clear that all its occupants are rotting corpses.

As time passes, with no sign of land or other ships, Parker suggests that one of them should be killed as food for the others. They draw straws, following the custom of the sea, and Parker is sacrificed. This gives the others a reprieve, but Augustus soon dies from wounds received when they reclaimed the &quot;Grampus&quot;, and several more storms batter the already badly damaged ship. Pym and Peters float on the upturned hull and are close to death when they are rescued by the &quot;Jane Guy&quot;, a ship out of Liverpool.

===On board the &quot;Jane Guy&quot; (Chapters XIV – XXII)===
On the &quot;Jane Guy&quot;, Pym and Peters become part of the crew and join the ship on its expedition to hunt sea calves and seals for fur, and to explore the southern oceans. Pym studies the islands around the Cape of Good Hope, becoming interested in the social structures of penguins, albatrosses, and other sea birds. Upon his urging, the captain agrees to sail farther south towards the unexplored Antarctic regions.

The ship crosses an ice barrier and arrives in open sea, close to the South Pole, albeit with a mild climate. Here the &quot;Jane Guy&quot; comes upon a mysterious island called Tsalal, inhabited by a tribe of black, apparently friendly natives led by a chief named Too-Wit. The color white is alien to the island&#x27;s inhabitants and unnerves them, because nothing of that color exists there. Even the natives&#x27; teeth are black. The island is also home to many undiscovered species of flora and fauna. Its water is also different from water elsewhere, being strangely thick and exhibiting multicolored veins.

The natives&#x27; relationship with the sailors is initially cordial, so Too-Wit and the captain begin trading. Their friendliness, however, turns out to be a ruse and on the eve of the ship&#x27;s proposed departure, the natives ambush the crew in a narrow gorge. Everyone except Pym and Peters is slaughtered, and the &quot;Jane Guy&quot; is overrun and burned by the malevolent tribe.

===Tsalal and farther south (Chapters XXIII – XXV)===
Pym and Peters hide in the mountains surrounding the site of the ambush. They discover a labyrinth of passages in the hills with strange marks on the walls, and disagree about whether these are the result of artificial or natural causes. Facing a shortage of food, they make a desperate run and steal a pirogue from the natives, narrowly escaping from the island and taking one of its inhabitants prisoner.

The small boat drifts farther south on a current of increasingly warm water, which has become milky white in color. After several days they encounter a rain of ashes and then observe a huge cataract of fog or mist, which splits open to accommodate their entrance upon approach. The native dies as a huge shrouded white figure appears before them.

Here the novel ends abruptly. A short post-scriptural note, ostensibly written by the book&#x27;s editors, explains that Pym was killed in an accident and speculates his final two or three chapters were lost with him, though assuring the public the chapters will be restored to the text if found. The note further explains that Peters is alive in Illinois but cannot be interviewed at present. The editors then compare the shapes of the labyrinth and the wall marks noted by Pym to Arabian and Egyptian letters and hieroglyphs with meanings of &quot;Shaded&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, and &quot;Region to the South&quot;.

==Sources==

In order to present the tale as an authentic exploration, Poe drew from contemporary travel journals. Poe&#x27;s most significant source was the explorer J. N. Reynolds, whose work &quot;Address on the Subject of a Surveying and Exploring Expedition to the Pacific Ocean and the South Seas&quot; was reviewed favorably by Poe in January 1837. Poe used about 700 words of Reynolds&#x27; address in Chapter XVI, almost half the length of the chapter. In 1843, Poe also praised Reynolds in a review of &quot;A Brief Account of the Discoveries and Results of the United States&#x27; Exploring Expedition&quot; printed in &quot;Graham&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. It is unknown whether Poe and Reynolds ever met. Shortly before Poe&#x27;s mysterious death, he is said to have called out the name &quot;Reynolds&quot; in his delirium. If true, this may have reflected the influence of J. N. Reynolds.

In a footnote to Chapter XIII, Poe refers to the &quot;Polly&quot;, a wreck which drifted for six months across the Atlantic Ocean in 1811–1812. Poe probably read this history in an 1836 book by R. Thomas, &quot;Remarkable Events and Remarkable Shipwrecks&quot;, from which he quotes verbatim.

In Chapter XVI, Poe recounts Captain James Cook&#x27;s circumnavigation of the globe aboard the &quot;Resolution&quot; that reached 70°10′ latitude. He also drew from &quot;A Narrative of Four Voyages&quot; (1832), an account by Benjamin Morrell that became a bestseller. &quot;A Narrative of Four Voyages&quot; may have given Poe the idea of the summarized title of his novel. Poe may have used these real-life accounts in an attempt to hoax his readers into believing the novel was an autobiographical narrative by Pym.

In addition to historical sources, Poe was influenced by fiction writers. &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; by Samuel Taylor Coleridge was a general influence, and scenes of Pym and Dirk Peters in a cave echo scenes in Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, which many reviewers noted at the time, including London publications such as the &quot;Court Gazette&quot; and the &quot;Torch&quot;. The ship of corpses recalls the legend of the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;, a ship which is cursed and unable to return home. The more gruesome and psychological elements may have been drawn from &quot;Logan&quot; by John Neal, whom Poe considered &quot;first, or at all events second, among our men of indisputable &quot;genius&quot;&quot;.

Poe also incorporated the theories of Reynolds and John Cleves Symmes Jr. on the Hollow Earth. The theory of these works was that a hole at the South Pole led to the interior of the planet, where undiscovered civilizations prospered. As Symmes wrote, the earth was &quot;hollow, habitable, and widely open about the poles&quot;. This theory, which he presented as early as 1818, was taken seriously throughout the nineteenth century. Symmes&#x27; theory had already served Poe when he wrote, in 1831, &quot;MS. Found in a Bottle&quot;, based partly on &quot;Symmes&#x27; Theory of the Concentric Spheres&quot;, published in 1826. &quot;MS. Found in a Bottle&quot; is similar to Poe&#x27;s novel in setting, characterization, and some elements of plot. Other writers who later fictionalized this theory include Edgar Rice Burroughs and L. Frank Baum.

In describing life on a long sea voyage, Poe also drew from personal experience. In 1815, a six-year-old Poe along with his foster-parents traveled from Norfolk, Virginia to Liverpool, England, a journey of 34 days. During the difficult trip, young Poe asked his foster father, John Allan, to include him in a letter he was writing. Allan wrote, &quot;Edgar says Pa say something for me, say I was not afraid of the sea.&quot; The family returned to the United States in 1820 aboard the &quot;Martha&quot; and docked in New York after 31 days. Closer to the time Poe wrote his novel, he had sailed during his military career, the longest trip being from Boston to Charleston, South Carolina.

==Analysis==
&quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot; has defied a universally accepted interpretation. Scholar Scott Peeples wrote that it is &quot;at once a mock nonfictional exploration narrative, adventure saga, bildungsroman, hoax, largely plagiarized travelogue, and spiritual allegory&quot; and &quot;one of the most elusive major texts of American literature.&quot; Biographer James M. Hutchisson writes that the plot both &quot;soars to new heights of fictional ingenuity and descends to new lows of silliness and absurdity&quot;.

One reason for the confusion comes from many continuity errors throughout the novel. For example, Pym notes that breaking a bottle while trapped in the hold saved his life because the sound alerted Augustus to his presence while searching. However, Pym notes that Augustus did not tell him this until &quot;many years elapsed&quot;, even though Augustus is dead eight chapters later. Nevertheless, much of the novel is carefully plotted. Novelist John Barth notes, for example, that the midway point of the novel occurs when Pym reaches the equator, the midway point of the globe.

Scholar Shawn Rosenheim believes that the use of hieroglyphs in the novel served as a precursor to Poe&#x27;s interest in cryptography. The pictographs themselves were likely inspired by &quot;The Kentuckian in New-York&quot; (1834) by William Alexander Caruthers, where similar writing is the work of a black slave. Unlike the previous sea-voyage tales that Poe had written, such as &quot;MS. Found in a Bottle&quot;, Pym is undertaking this trip on purpose. It has been suggested that the journey is about establishing a national American identity as well as discovering a personal identity.

Poe also presents the effects of alcohol in the novel. The opening episode, for example, shows that intoxicated people can sometimes seem entirely sober and then, suddenly, the effects of alcohol show through. Such a depiction is a small version of a larger focus in the novel on contradictions between chaos and order. Even nature seems unnatural. Water, for example, is very different at the end of the novel, appearing either colorful or &quot;unnaturally clear.&quot;

===Autobiographical elements===
Elements of the novel are often read as autobiographical. The novel begins with Arthur Gordon Pym, a name similar to Edgar Allan Poe, departing from Edgartown, Massachusetts, on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. Interpreted this way, the protagonist is actually sailing away from himself, or his ego. The middle name of &quot;Gordon&quot;, in replacing Poe&#x27;s connection to the Allan family, was turned into a reference to George Gordon Byron, a poet whom Poe deeply admired. The scene where Pym disguises himself from his grandfather while noting that he intends to inherit wealth from him also indicates a desire for Poe to free himself from family obligation and, specifically, scorning the patrimony of his foster-father John Allan.

Dates are also relevant to this autobiographical reading. According to the text, Pym arrives at the island of Tsalal on January 19—Poe&#x27;s birthday. Some scholars, including Burton R. Pollin and Richard Wilbur, suggest that the character of Augustus was based on Poe&#x27;s childhood friend Ebenezer Burling; others argue he represents Poe&#x27;s brother William Henry Leonard Poe, who served in South America and elsewhere as a sailor aboard the USS &quot;Macedonian&quot;. In the novel, the date of Augustus&#x27;s death corresponds to that of the death of Poe&#x27;s brother. The first chapter features Pym&#x27;s sloop named the &quot;Ariel&quot;, the name of a character once played by Poe&#x27;s mother Eliza Poe, and also the name of Percy Bysshe Shelley&#x27;s boat, on which he died, originally named &quot;Don Juan&quot; in honor of Lord Byron.

===Race===
One thread of critical analysis of this tale focuses on the possibly racist implications of Poe&#x27;s plot and imagery. One such plot element is the black cook who leads the mutiny on the &quot;Grampus&quot; and is its most bloodthirsty participant. Dirk Peters, a man of mixed white and Native American ancestry, is described as having a ferocious appearance, with long, protruding teeth, bowed legs, and a bald head like &quot;the head of most negroes.&quot; The brilliant whiteness of the final figure in the novel contrasts with the dark-skinned savages and such a contrast may call to mind the escalating racial tensions over the question of slavery in the United States as Poe was writing the novel.

Additionally, the novel drew from prevalent assumptions during the time that dark-skinned people were inherently inferior. One critic of the use of race in &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot; is Toni Morrison. In her 1992 book &quot;Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination&quot;, Morrison discusses how the Africanist presence in the novel is used as an &quot;Other&quot; against which the author defines &quot;white&quot;, &quot;free&quot;, and &quot;individual&quot;. In her explorations of the depiction of African characters in white American literature, Morrison writes that &quot;no early American writer is more important to the concept of American Africanism than Poe&quot; because of the focus on the symbolism of black and white in Poe&#x27;s novel. This possible racial symbolism is explored further in Mat Johnson&#x27;s satirical fantasy &quot;Pym&quot; (2011).

===Ending===

The novel ends abruptly with the sudden appearance of a bizarre enshrouded figure having skin hued &quot;of the perfect whiteness of the snow.&quot; Many readers were left unsatisfied by this ending because, as Poe relative and scholar Harry Lee Poe wrote, &quot;it didn&#x27;t match the kind of clear ending they expected from a novel.&quot; Poe may have purposely left the ending subject to speculation. Some scholars have suggested that the ending serves as a symbolic conclusion to Pym&#x27;s spiritual journey and others suggest that Pym has actually died in this scene, as though his tale is somehow being told posthumously. Alternatively, Pym may die in the retelling of the story at precisely the same point he &quot;should&quot; have died during the actual adventure. Like other characters in works by Poe, Pym seems to submit willingly to this fate, whatever it is. Kenneth Silverman notes that the figure radiates ambivalence and it is not clear if it is a symbol of destruction or of protection.

The chasms that open throughout the sea in the final moments of the book derive from the Hollow Earth theory. The area closest to the Pole is also, surprisingly, warm rather than cold, as Symmes believed. Symmes also believed there were civilizations inside this Hollow Earth and the enshrouded figure who appears at the end may indicate one such civilization near the Pole.

==Composition and publication history==

Poe had intended to collect a number of his early short stories into a volume titled &quot;Tales of the Folio Club&quot; in the 1830s. The collection would be unified as a series of tales presented by members of a literary association based on the Delphian Club, designed as burlesque of contemporary literary criticism. Poe had previously printed several of these stories in the Philadelphia &quot;Saturday Courier&quot; and the &quot;Baltimore Saturday Visiter&quot;.

An editor, James Kirke Paulding, tried to assist him in publishing this collection. However, Paulding reported back to Poe that the publishers at Harper &amp; Brothers declined the collection, saying that readers were looking for simple, long works like novels. They suggested, &quot;if he will lower himself a little to the ordinary comprehension of the generality of readers, and prepare... a single work... they will make such arrangements with him as will be liberal and satisfactory.&quot; They suggested &quot;if other engagements permit... undertake a Tale in a couple volumes, for that is the magical number.&quot; The response from Harper &amp; Brothers inspired Poe to begin a long work and began writing &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot;. Poe arranged with his boss at the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot; to publish his novel in several serialized installments at a pay rate of $3 per page.

However, Poe retired from his role at the &quot;Messenger&quot; on January 3, 1837, as the installments were being published; some scholars suggest he was fired and this led him to abandoning the novel. His split with the &quot;Messenger&quot; began a &quot;blank period&quot; where he did not publish much and suffered from unemployment, poverty, and no success in his literary pursuits. Poe soon realized writing a book-length narrative was a necessary career decision, partly because he had no steady job and the economy was suffering from the Panic of 1837. He also set part of the story as a quest to Antarctica to capitalize the public&#x27;s sudden interest in that topic.

After his marriage to Virginia Clemm, Poe spent the following winter and spring completing his manuscript for this novel in New York. He earned a small amount of money by taking in a boarder named William Gowans. During his fifteen months in New York, amidst the harsh economic climate, Poe published only two tales, &quot;Von Jung, the Mystific&quot; and &quot;Siope. A Fable&quot;. Harper &amp; Brothers announced Poe&#x27;s novel would be published in May 1837, but the Panic forced them to delay.

The novel was finally published in book form under the title &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot; in July 1838, although it did not include Poe&#x27;s name and was instead presented as an account by Pym himself. Poe excused the earlier serialized version by noting that the &quot;Messenger&quot; had mistakenly adapted it &quot;under the garb of fiction&quot;. As Harper &amp; Brothers recommended, it was printed in two volumes. Its full subtitle was:
The first overseas publication of &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot; appeared only a few months later when it was printed in London without Poe&#x27;s permission, although the final paragraph was omitted. This early publication of the novel initiated British interest in Poe.

==Literary significance and reception==
Contemporary reviews for &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot; were generally unfavorable. Fifteen months after its publication, it was reviewed by Lewis Gaylord Clark, a fellow author who carried on a substantial feud with Poe. His review printed in &quot;The Knickerbocker&quot; said the book was &quot;told in a loose and slip-shod style, seldom chequered by any of the more common graces of composition.&quot; Clark went on, &quot;This work is one of much interest, with all its defects, not the least of which is that it is too liberally stuffed with &#x27;horrid circumstances of blood and battle.

Many reviewers commented on the excess of violent scenes. In addition to noting the novel&#x27;s gruesome details, a review in &quot;Burton&#x27;s Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (possibly William Evans Burton himself) criticized its borrowed descriptions of geography and errors in nautical information. The reviewer considered it a literary hoax and called it an &quot;impudent attempt at humbugging the public&quot; and regretted &quot;Mr. Poe&#x27;s name in connexion with such a mass of ignorance and effrontery&quot;. Poe later wrote to Burton that he agreed with the review, saying it &quot;was essentially correct&quot; and the novel was &quot;a very silly book&quot;.

Other reviews condemned the attempt at presenting a true story. A reviewer for the &quot;Metropolitan Magazine&quot; noted that, though the story was good as fiction, &quot;when palmed upon the public as a true thing, it cannot appear in any other light than that of a bungling business—an impudent attempt at imposing on the credulity of the ignorant.&quot; Nevertheless, some readers believed portions of Poe&#x27;s novel were true, especially in England, and justified the absurdity of the book with an assumption that author Pym was exaggerating the truth. Publisher George Putnam later noted that &quot;whole columns of these new &#x27;discoveries&#x27;, including the hieroglyphics (sic) found on the rocks, were copied by many of the English country papers as sober historical truth.&quot;

In contrast, 20th-century Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, who admitted Poe as a strong influence, praised the novel as &quot;Poe&#x27;s greatest work&quot;. He later included one of the species invented for the story in his dictionary of fantastical creatures, the &quot;Book of Imaginary Beings&quot;, in a chapter titled &quot;an animal dreamt by Poe&quot;. H. G. Wells noted that &quot;&quot;Pym&quot; tells what a very intelligent mind could imagine about the south polar region a century ago&quot;. Even so, most scholars did not engage in much serious discussion or analysis of the novel until the 1950s, though many in France recognized the work much earlier. In 2013, &quot;The Guardian&quot; cited &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot; as one of the 100 best novels written in English, and noted its influence on later authors such as Henry James, Arthur Conan Doyle, B. Traven and David Morrell.

The financial and critical failure of &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot; was a turning point in Poe&#x27;s career. For one, he was driven to literary duties that would make him money, notably his controversial role as editor of &quot;The Conchologist&#x27;s First Book&quot; in April 1839. He also wrote a short series called &quot;Literary Small Talk&quot; for a new Baltimore-based magazine called &quot;American Museum of Science, Literature and the Arts&quot;.

In need of work, Poe accepted a job at the low salary of $10 per week as assistant editor for &quot;Burton&#x27;s Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, despite their negative review of his novel. He also returned to his focus on short stories rather than longer works of prose; Poe&#x27;s next published book after this, his only completed novel, was the collection &quot;Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque&quot; in 1840.

==Influence and legacy==
===19th century===
Scholars, including Patrick F. Quinn and John J. McAleer, have noted parallels between Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; and &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot; and other Poe works. Quinn noted that there were enough similarities that Melville must have studied Poe&#x27;s novel and, if not, it would be &quot;one of the most extraordinary accidents in literature&quot;. McAleer noted that Poe&#x27;s short story &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; inspired &quot;Ahab&#x27;s flawed character&quot; in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;. Scholar Jack Scherting also noted similarities between &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; and Poe&#x27;s &quot;MS. Found in a Bottle&quot;.

&quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot; became one of Poe&#x27;s most-translated works; by 1978, scholars had counted over 300 editions, adaptations, and translations. This novel has proven to be particularly influential in France. French poet and author Charles Baudelaire translated the novel in 1857 as &quot;Les Aventures d&#x27;Arthur Gordon Pym&quot;. Baudelaire was also inspired by Poe&#x27;s novel in his own poetry. &quot;Voyage to Cythera&quot; rewrites part of Poe&#x27;s scene where birds eat human flesh.

French author Jules Verne greatly admired Poe and wrote a study, &quot;Edgar Poe et ses œuvres&quot;, in 1864. Poe&#x27;s story &quot;Three Sundays in a Week&quot; may have inspired Verne&#x27;s novel &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot; (1873). In 1897, Verne published a sequel to &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot; called &quot;An Antarctic Mystery&quot;. Like Poe&#x27;s novel, Verne attempted to present an imaginative work of fiction as a believable story by including accurate factual details. The two-volume novel explores the adventures of the &quot;Halbrane&quot; as its crew searches for answers to what became of Pym. Translations of this text are sometimes titled &quot;The Sphinx of Ice&quot; or &quot;The Mystery of Arthur Gordon Pym&quot;.

An informal sequel to &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot; is the 1899 novel &quot;A Strange Discovery&quot; by Charles Romeyn Dake, where the narrator, Doctor Bainbridge, recounts the story his patient Dirk Peters told him of his journey with Gordon Pym in Antarctica, including a discussion of Poe&#x27;s poem &quot;The Raven&quot;.

===20th century===
Prince Amerigo in Henry James&#x27;s novel &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot; (1904) recalled &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot;: &quot;He remembered to have read as a boy a wonderful tale by Allan Poe ... which was a thing to show, by the way, what imagination Americans &quot;could&quot; have: the story of the shipwrecked Gordon Pym, who ... found ... a thickness of white air ... of the color of milk or of snow.&quot;

Poe&#x27;s novel was also an influence on H. P. Lovecraft, whose 1936 novel &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; follows similar thematic direction and borrows the cry &quot;tekeli-li&quot; or &quot;takkeli&quot; from the novel. Chaosium&#x27;s role-playing adventure &quot;Beyond the Mountains of Madness&quot; (1999), a sequel to Lovecraft&#x27;s novel, includes a &quot;missing ending&quot; of Poe&#x27;s novel, in which Pym encounters some of Lovecraft&#x27;s creatures at their Antarctic city.

René Magritte&#x27;s 1937 painting &quot;Not to Be Reproduced&quot; depicts an 1858 French edition of Poe&#x27;s book in the lower right of the work.

Another French sequel was &quot;La Conquête de l&#x27;Eternel&quot; (1947) by Dominique André.

Georges Perec&#x27;s 1969 novel &quot;A Void&quot;, notable for not containing a single letter &quot;e&quot;, contains an e-less rewriting of Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Raven&quot; that is attributed to Arthur Gordon Pym in order to avoid using the two &quot;e&quot;s found in Poe&#x27;s name.

On May 5, 1974, author and journalist Arthur Koestler published a letter from reader Nigel Parker in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; of a striking coincidence between a scene in Poe&#x27;s novel and an actual event that happened decades later: In 1884, the yacht &quot;Mignonette&quot; sank, with four men cast adrift. After weeks without food, they decided that one of them should be sacrificed as food for the other three, just as in Poe&#x27;s novel. The loser was a young cabin boy named Richard Parker, coincidentally the same name as Poe&#x27;s fictional character. Parker&#x27;s shipmates, Tom Dudley and Edwin Stephens, were later tried for murder in a precedent-setting English common law trial, the renowned &quot;R v Dudley and Stephens.&quot;

In Paul Theroux&#x27;s travelogue &quot;The Old Patagonian Express&quot; (1979), Theroux reads parts of &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot; to Jorge Luis Borges. Theroux describes it in this book as being the &quot;most terrifying&quot; story he had ever read.

In Paul Auster&#x27;s &quot;City of Glass&quot; (1985), the lead character Quinn has a revelation that makes him think of the discovery of the strange hieroglyphs at the end of Poe&#x27;s novel.

In a 1988 &quot;Young All-Stars&quot; comic book written by Roy and Dann Thomas, Arthur Gordon Pym is a 19th-century explorer who discovered the lost Arctic civilization of the alien Dyzan. Pym goes on to become Jules Verne&#x27;s Captain Nemo, eventually sinking the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. This story also uses elements of Edward Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s 1871 novel &quot;Vril&quot;.

===21st century===
Yann Martel named a character in his Booker Prize-winning novel &quot;Life of Pi&quot; (2001) after Poe&#x27;s fictional character, Richard Parker. Mat Johnson&#x27;s 2011 novel &quot;Pym&quot;, a satirical fantasy exploring racial politics in the United States, draws its inspiration from &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot;, and closely models the original.

Funeral doom band Ahab based their 2012 album &quot;The Giant&quot; on &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot;.

A character named Arthur Gordon Pym appears in the 2023 miniseries, &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;, as the attorney for the Usher family. Repeated references are made to his story of origin, said to have happened in his youth. It is stated that the character of Arthur Pym stops telling the story of his trip before his journey to the South Pole, alluding to the ending of the original novel. The character is played by Mark Hamill.

<doc id="581846" wikidata="Q5533240" url="?curid=581846" title="Genital tattooing">
<text>Genital tattooing is the practice of placing permanent marks under the skin of the genitals in the form of tattoos.

== Occurrence ==
, though tattoos in general have enjoyed an upsurge of popularity, particularly in the west and among younger people, genital tattoos are still relatively rare. There are several probable reasons for this: the genital area is sensitive, it is not often publicly visible, and is covered with hair unless intentionally removed. Also, some tattooists refuse to place tattoos in these (and other) areas for a variety of reasons.

Genital tattooing may have been decorative surgeries practiced during Paleolithic times and archaeological evidence has survived to this day. Evidence regarding explicit genital male representations were found in art made in Europe approximately 38,000 to 11,000 years ago. However, the primitive meaning of genital ornamentation is not clearly defined.

== Motivation ==
As any other forms of tattoos, the choice may be decorative and genital tattoo designs have been created to decoratively imitate pubic hair, to enhance the appearance of the genitals, or to create whimsical or other designs around the genital area. Some men have incorporated genital tattooing into the creation of a tattoo design in such a way that the penis becomes a part of the overall design motif (for example, as a &quot;nose&quot; in a tattooed face, or as the &quot;trunk&quot; of an elephant).

Women have created similar designs, incorporating their genitals into tattooed designs like faces and animals. This practice has long been a part of tattooing, and examples can be seen incorporating the nipples and other parts of the body into designs.

Some heavily tattooed people choose to have their genital and anal regions tattooed to complete the work they have over much of their bodies. Others have used genital tattooing in a BDSM context, for example to indicate &quot;ownership&quot; of a submissive by a dominant.

== Anatomical locations ==
Nearly the entire genital region can be tattooed, including the shaft and head of the penis, the skin of the scrotum, the pubic region and the outer labia.

<text>The Boeing X-40 Space Maneuver Vehicle is a test platform for the Boeing X-37 reusable spaceplane, built by Boeing Phantom Works. It sought to test the X-37&#x27;s systems in order to &quot;reduce the cost and risk of future reusable space launch vehicle system.&quot;

==History==
The uncrewed X-40A was a 80%-90% subscale version of the Boeing X-37 reusable spaceplane, but lacking in propulsion or thermal protection systems. Boeing built the X-40A originally for the Air Force as part of that service’s Space Maneuver Vehicle program.

The aircraft was built at Boeing Phantom Works at Seal Beach, California, in partnership with the Air Force Research Laboratory.

After the first drop test in August 1998 the vehicle was transferred to NASA, which modified it. Between April 4 and May 19, 2001, the vehicle successfully conducted seven free flights. In 2001 it successfully demonstrated the glide capabilities of the X-37&#x27;s fat-bodied, short-winged design and validated the proposed guidance system.

==Testing==
The first X-40A drop test occurred at Holloman AFB, New Mexico on August 11, 1998 at 06:59. It was released from an altitude of approximately and away from the end of Runway 04 by a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter (later tests used an Army CH-47D Chinook helicopter). The vehicle dove to the runway in an approach similar to the Space Shuttle&#x27;s, flared, and landed left of the runway centerline. Its drag chutes successfully deployed, and the vehicle tracked to within of the centerline and stopped at a distance of slightly more than .

The X-40A flew seven approach and landing test flights at NASA’s Dryden (now Armstrong) Flight Research Center in Edwards, California, in 2001 to reduce risk for the X-37 program, including in-flight evaluation of guidance, navigation and control software for its autonomous flight controls. One test flight the craft was towed by an Army CH-47D Chinook helicopter to an altitude of 15,000 feet, and then released to fly an autonomously controlled 75-second descent to a landing on the main runway at Edwards Air Force Base, where it then glided and guided itself.

<doc id="581857" wikidata="Q7251625" url="?curid=581857" title="Protestant Unionist Party">
<text>The Protestant Unionist Party (PUP) was a unionist political party operating in Northern Ireland from 1966 to 1971. It was the forerunner of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and emerged from the Ulster Protestant Action (UPA) movement. It was founded and led by Ian Paisley, who also founded and led the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster.

The UPA had two councillors elected to Belfast Corporation. In 1967, both were re-elected as PUP candidates. The PUP stood six candidates against the ruling Ulster Unionist Party of the Northern Ireland parliament in the January 1969 general election. They polled over 20,000 votes, but gained no seats, although Paisley was seen as coming close in the previously safe Bannside seat of the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland Terence O&#x27;Neill.

When Terence O&#x27;Neill (the then Northern Irish Prime Minister) stood down from Stormont in 1970 along with one of his colleagues, the PUP nominated candidates for the two vacant seats. Both were successful. Ian Paisley and fellow Free Presbyterian minister, the Rev. William Beattie, PUP leader and deputy respectively, were elected - Paisley for Bannside and Beattie for South Antrim. In that year&#x27;s Westminster general election, Paisley was elected to represent Antrim North in the British House of Commons.

The PUP campaigned for the retention of the Union and for total freedom for Orange parades. The PUP was wound up in 1971 and re-emerged as the DUP in October of that year.

The electoral label Protestant Unionist was subsequently used in the 1980s by Belfast City Council member George Seawright after he left the DUP.

<text>Bischofsheim is a municipality in Groß-Gerau district in Hesse, Germany with a population of more than 13,000.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
Bischofsheim lies south of the Main and east of the Rhine in the so-called &quot;Mainspitze&quot; triangle, a narrow piece of land between the Main and Rhine where the former empties into the latter.

=== Neighbouring municipalities ===
Bischofsheim borders in the north on the town of Hochheim (Main-Taunus-Kreis), in the east on the town of Rüsselsheim, and in the south and west on the municipality of Ginsheim-Gustavsburg.

=== Constituent communities ===
Bischofsheim has only one constituent community, nevertheless it has with &quot;An den Sportstätten&quot; and &quot;Dr.-Hans-Böckler-Siedlung two by train tracks / motorway divided additional parts.

== History ==
In the Middle Ages, Bischofsheim was ruled by the Archbishop of Mainz, but fell to Hesse-Darmstadt in 1579. In 1930 it was incorporated to the city of Mainz, remaining a constituent community of that city until 1945. Due to its infrastructure Bischofsheim was subject to air raids bombing of Mainz in World War II. Since the American and French occupying powers severed the links between Mainz and the so-called &quot;Rechtsrheinische Stadtteile von Mainz&quot; (Mainz constituent communities on the Rhine&#x27;s right bank) – the Rhine was the boundary between their two occupational zones – these six communities effectively ceased to be part of the city of Mainz. Whereas the three former constituent communities north of the Main were administered by Wiesbaden since then, Bischofsheim and neighbouring Ginsheim-Gustavsburg once again became independent municipalities in Groß-Gerau district.

== Politics ==

=== Coat of arms ===
Bischofsheim&#x27;s civic coat of arms might heraldically be described thus: Party per fess, above, a lion rampant striped alternately three times argent and three times gules, armed and crowned Or, langued gules, below, a pair of pince-nez eyeglasses with frame sable.

The lion is the lion of Hesse, seen in Hesse&#x27;s own arms, and many civic coats of arms throughout Hesse.

The eyeglasses are a mystery. It is not known how they became a symbol of Bischofsheim, but they first appeared in seals in the 16th century and afterwards on other things of civic importance, such as municipal limit markers. One suggestion is that they derive from the two-wheels-and-cross charge in Mainz&#x27;s coat of arms, seen here.

Leave to bear these arms was granted by the People&#x27;s State of Hesse (&quot;Volksstaat Hessen&quot;) on 27 October 1926.

=== Partnerships ===
* Dzierżoniów, Poland
* Crewe and Nantwich, United Kingdom

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Transport ===
Mainz-Bischofsheim station is the centre of a railway hub with a marshalling yard, called Mainz-Bischofsheim, as Bischofsheim was formerly part of Mainz. The hub itself is formed by a junction of the Mainz–Frankfurt and Wiesbaden–Darmstadt lines.

The community is directly reachable by Autobahnen A 60 and A 671.

Bischofsheim&#x27;s location near two important rivers affords waterborne transportation as well.

== Sightseeing ==
Things worth seeing are the Baroque Evangelical church, the early modern Roman Catholic Christ the King church (&quot;Christkönigskirche&quot;) by Dominikus Böhm and the historic half-timbered houses. In one of these, the Old Town Hall (&quot;Altes Rathaus&quot;), is housed the local history museum.

== Synonyms ==
Bischofsheim is sometimes also called:
*&quot;Bischofsheim (Kreis Groß-Gerau)&quot;, for instance, in the information given out by the Rhine-Main Transport Association (&quot;Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund&quot;);
*&quot;Mainz-Bischofsheim&quot;, for instance, in the information given out by Deutsche Bahn;
*&quot;Bischofsheim bei Rüsselsheim&quot;, for instance, in Deutsche Telekom AG&#x27;s directories.

<doc id="581859" wikidata="Q2905137" url="?curid=581859" title="Invertible sheaf">
<text>In mathematics, an invertible sheaf is a sheaf on a ringed space that has an inverse with respect to tensor product of sheaves of modules. It is the equivalent in algebraic geometry of the topological notion of a line bundle. Due to their interactions with Cartier divisors, they play a central role in the study of algebraic varieties. 

==Definition==
Let (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;O&quot;&quot;X&quot;) be a ringed space. Isomorphism classes of sheaves of &quot;O&quot;&quot;X&quot;-modules form a monoid under the operation of tensor product of &quot;O&quot;&quot;X&quot;-modules. The identity element for this operation is &quot;O&quot;&quot;X&quot; itself. Invertible sheaves are the invertible elements of this monoid. Specifically, if &quot;L&quot; is a sheaf of &quot;O&quot;&quot;X&quot;-modules, then &quot;L&quot; is called invertible if it satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions:
* There exists a sheaf &quot;M&quot; such that formula_1.
* The natural homomorphism formula_2 is an isomorphism, where formula_3 denotes the dual sheaf formula_4.
* The functor from &quot;O&quot;&quot;X&quot;-modules to &quot;O&quot;&quot;X&quot;-modules defined by formula_5 is an equivalence of categories.

Every locally free sheaf of rank one is invertible. If &quot;X&quot; is a locally ringed space, then &quot;L&quot; is invertible if and only if it is locally free of rank one. Because of this fact, invertible sheaves are closely related to line bundles, to the point where the two are sometimes conflated.

==Examples==
Let &quot;X&quot; be an affine scheme . Then an invertible sheaf on &quot;X&quot; is the sheaf associated to a rank one projective module over &quot;R&quot;. For example, this includes fractional ideals of algebraic number fields, since these are rank one projective modules over the rings of integers of the number field.

==The Picard group==

Quite generally, the isomorphism classes of invertible sheaves on &quot;X&quot; themselves form an abelian group under tensor product. This group generalises the ideal class group. In general it is written

:formula_6

with &quot;Pic&quot; the Picard functor. Since it also includes the theory of the Jacobian variety of an algebraic curve, the study of this functor is a major issue in algebraic geometry.

The direct construction of invertible sheaves by means of data on &quot;X&quot; leads to the concept of Cartier divisor.

<text>Pearling or genital beading is a form of body modification, the practice of permanently inserting small beads made of various materials beneath the skin of the genitals—of the labia, or of the shaft or foreskin of the penis. As well as being an aesthetic practice, this is usually intended to enhance the sexual pleasure of partners during vaginal or anal intercourse.
==Procedures==
There are two common procedures, one being very similar to a frenum piercing and the other being similar to inserting a subdermal implant, and requiring more medical knowledge and specialized tools. Either procedure is relatively safe with risks and healing much like a subdermal implant in any other part of the body, although, like many genital piercings, the generous blood flow to the genitals can reduce healing times considerably. Inflammation is very common, during and after healing, although careful healing can minimize this. Rejection is rare, but can occur.

==Jewelry==
A wide variety of inert implant materials can be used for this implant. Teflon, silicone, surgical steel or titanium are commonly used materials. Prior to the availability of modern materials, there is a long history of pearls being used in this implant, hence the name pearling. There is an alternative form of this implant, where short curved &quot;ribs&quot; are inserted, rather than pearls.

==History and culture==

The precise origin of pearling is unknown, but early documentation in China indicates that it had been imported from Southeast Asia no later than the early 1400s. Historical documents refer to the inserts as &quot;miǎnlíng&quot; (), literally translating to Burmese bells. In the Philippines, researchers have established that these were present in various forms from the Visayas to southern Luzon. In the Visayas, pins made of gold, ivory, or brass were inserted in young boys through their penis heads, according to research by the pre-eminent historian of pre-colonial Philippines, William Henry Scott. As the boys grew older, these pins would be decorated and they would later fasten bluntly spiked rings for the stimulation of their sex partners. In &quot;Barangay&quot;, his study of 16th century Philippine ethnography, Scott wrote, &quot;these ornaments required manipulation by the woman herself to insert and could not be withdrawn until the male organ was completely relaxed.&quot; Scott added that there were as many as 30 different kinds to &quot;cater to a lady&#x27;s choice.&quot;

The best-known historical use of pearling involves the yakuza organized crime syndicates of Japan, whose members perform several notable types of body modification, including large body irezumi tattoos and Yubitsume, the amputation of finger joints in penance to their superiors. Pearling is performed in prison by the yakuza, with each pearl supposedly symbolizing a year spent in prison.

Pearling, called &#x27;bolitas&#x27;, has become a common practice among Filipino sailors, especially among the older ones. Journalist Ryan Jacobs, writing in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, reported in 2013 that sailors use bolitas to differentiate themselves from other international sailors, especially to curry favor from prostitutes.

The practice comes from Pre-colonial period in the Philippines wherein instruments such as the Tudruck (Penis-pin) and Sakra (Penis-ring), often made up of gold or ivory, were inserted to the penises of young adults. Antonio Pigafetta, Italian chronicler of Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s circumnavigation, once wrote about this practice in his journals:

<text>Pier Gerlofs Donia ( – 28 October 1520) was a Frisian farmer, rebel leader, and pirate. He is best known by his West Frisian nickname &quot;Grutte Pier&quot; (&#x27;Big Pier&#x27;; in the pre-1980 West Frisian spelling written as &quot;Greate Pier&quot;), or by the Dutch translation &quot;Grote Pier&quot;, which referred to his legendary size, strength, and bravery.

His life is mostly shrouded in legend. Based upon a description now attributed to Pier&#x27;s contemporary Petrus Thaborita, the 19th-century Dutch historian Conrad Busken Huet wrote that Grutte Pier was 

==Early life and family==
Pier Gerlofs was born around 1480 in Kimswerd near the city of Harlingen, Wonseradeel (modern Friesland, Netherlands). Pier Gerlofs was one of at least four children born to Fokel Sybrants Bonga and Gerlof Piers. Pier&#x27;s mother Fokel was the daughter of the Schieringer noblemen Sybrant Doytsesz Bonga of Bongastate, Kimswerd.

Pier married Rintsje Syrtsema and they had two children, a son named Gerlof and a daughter named Wobbel, who were born around 1510. Pier died in 1520, and in 1525, Pier&#x27;s mother appointed in her will Pier&#x27;s brother, Sybren, as guardian of Pier&#x27;s children, who still were minors. Pier and his brother-in-law, Ane Pijbes (husband of Tijdt Gerlofs), were partners in the farming estate of Meyllemastate in Kimswerd.

Wijerd Jelckama often is described by 18th and 19th-century authors as the nephew of Grutte Pier. Contemporary Worp van Thabor identifies him simply as Weird van Bolsward. Modern authors such as J.J. Kalma doubt the nephew connection, and Brouwer in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Friesland&quot; states that Wijerd was not Grutte Pier&#x27;s nephew but instead his &quot;lieutenant&quot;.

==Rebellion==
Approximately to the north-east of Donia&#x27;s village of Kimswerd, in the city of Franeker, the Black Band, a Landsknecht regiment in the service of George, Duke of Saxony was quartered. The regiment was charged with suppressing the civil war between the Vetkopers, who opposed Burgundian and subsequently Habsburg rule, and the Schieringers. The Black Band were notorious as a violent military force; when their pay was insufficient or lacking, they would extract payments from local villagers. On 29 January 1515, the Black Band plundered Donia&#x27;s village, then allegedly raped and killed his wife, Rintze Syrtsema, burning to the ground both the village church and Donia&#x27;s estate. Seeking revenge, Pier started a guerrilla war campaign against the Habsburgs and allied himself with Charles of Egmond, Duke of Guelders (1492–1538).

==Peasant rebels==

===Arumer Zwarte Hoop===
Pier&#x27;s armed band, known as the Arumer Zwarte Hoop (English: Black Hope (or heap) of Arum), were pirates mainly active against the Hollanders and Burgundians at sea. He managed to capture many English and Dutch ships, mainly on the Zuider Zee (today&#x27;s ‘IJsselmeer’). Erasmus criticized Grutte Pier&#x27;s exploits.

===Pirating in the Zuiderzee===
Pier targeted ships that travelled the Zuiderzee and was very active in 1517, when he used his &quot;signal ships&quot; to attack ships in the region of the West Frisian coast, to which he also transported Geldrian forces, setting them ashore at Medemblik. Pier bore a personal enmity to Medemblik and its inhabitants as, in earlier years, soldiers from Medemblik had cooperated with the Holland army commanded by Duke Charles, the future Emperor. In March 1498, Medemblik was where representatives of the Schieringers met the Saxon ruler duke Albrecht to request Saxon protection from the Vetkopers—a request that resulted in the Saxon occupation of Friesland, Netherlands. On 24 June 1517, Grutte Pier and his Arumer Zwarte Hoop, consisting of some 4,000 soldiers from Frisia and Guelders, sailed to West Frisia, passing Enkhuizen, landing near Wervershoof and advancing to Medemblik. They swiftly captured Medemblik, killing many inhabitants and taking many others prisoner. Some were released on payment of a high ransom. Some of the town&#x27;s inhabitants fled and found safety at Kasteel Radboud. The castle&#x27;s governor, Joost van Buren, succeeded in keeping the aggressors outside the castle walls. Unable to take the castle, the Arumer Zwarte Hoop plundered the town and set it on fire. With most houses made of wood, the town, including the church, monastery and town hall, was razed. After this partial victory, Pier and his army stormed both Nieuwburg and Middleburg Castle near Alkmaar, plundered and set them on fire, leaving only ruins.

===Battles on land===
In 1517, the Arumer Zwarte Hoop captured the town of Asperen, slaughtering virtually all its inhabitants. They then used the heavily fortified city as a base until driven out by Holland&#x27;s Stadhouder. In response to the attacks on Medemblik and Alkmaar and the failure of the Captain General of Amstelland, Waterland and Gooiland to defend his territories, the Stadhouder of Holland agreed to outfit a war fleet in July 1517. The fleet came under the supreme command of Anthonius van den Houte, Lord of Vleteren, appropriately titled &quot;Admiral of the Zuiderzee&quot;. In the name of Charles V, van den Houte announced he would free the region of Frisian and Gelder piracy. Although van den Houte was initially successful, with some of the Frisian vessels being burnt near Bunschoten, Grutte Pier responded by seizing 11 of Holland&#x27;s ships in a battle off the coast near Hoorn in 1518.

Shortly after this victory, Pier defeated 300 Hollanders in Hindelopen. According to a legend, Pier forced his captives to repeat a shibboleth to distinguish Frisians from Holland and Lower German infiltrators:

Bûter, brea en griene tsiis: wa&#x27;t dat net sizze kin, is gjin oprjochte Fries.
(&quot;Butter, bread, and green cheese: if you can’t say that, you’re not a real Frisian.&quot;) 

==Later years and death==
Despite his successes, Pier could not turn the Burgundian/Habsburg tide and he retired, disillusioned, in 1519. Wijerd Jelckama took over the command of Pier&#x27;s forces. Pier died peacefully in his bed at Grootzand 12 in the Frisian city of Sneek on 28 October 1520. Pier is buried in Sneek in the 15th-century Groote Kerk (English: &quot;Great Church&quot;; also called the Martinikerk). His tomb is located at the north side of the church.

Pier&#x27;s son Gerloff died unmarried and left no descendants. His daughter Wobbel married three times, lastly to one Popta with whom she had children. Therefore, Donia left no descendants in the male line, but has many descendants through his daughter.

==Extreme strength and size==
In 1791, Jacobus Kok wrote that above the porticus of the New City Hall of Leeuwarden, two remarkably large swords were found which were said to have belonged to Grutte Pier and Wijerd Jelckama. Donia was noted for the ability to wield this great sword so efficiently that he could behead multiple people with it in a single blow.

Today, a great sword that is said to have belonged to Pier is on display at the Fries Museum in Leeuwarden. It measures in length and weighs . Pier was alleged to be so strong that he could bend coins using just his thumb, index, and middle finger. A huge helmet said to be Grutte Pier&#x27;s is kept in the town hall of Sneek.

==In popular culture==
===Gysbert Japicx===
The seventeenth century Friese poet Gysbert Japicx (1603–1666) wrote in his composition &quot;Tjesck Moars See Aengste&quot; (&quot;Grandmother&#x27;s Sea Anguish&quot;) the following verse in reference to Grote Pier (eng. trans., Large Peter):

===Fivefal===
Stories about Pier grew into legends that often share themes with stories of other strong men in Germanic heroic literature. For example, one story says Pier ploughed his land by pulling the plough himself instead of using horses. Another story states that Pier could lift a horse above his head. &quot;Fivefal&quot; is the name in Frisian of a Frisian legend. It tells the story of Pier beating five strong men who came to fight him: the place where he beat them is known as Fivefal, (Lit. Five fall) for all five of them fell to the ground.

===Television===
- In the 1970s, in the Dutch &quot;Floris&quot; series, Donia was a major character played by actor Hans Boskamp.

- In the 22nd episode of Season 9 of Forged in Fire, originally aired in October 2022, &quot;Supersized Swords&quot;, the final challenge was to have two contestants forge a replica of Grutte Pier&#x27;s great sword.

- The life of Pier is featured in an episode of &#x27;Dark Marvels&#x27; titled &quot;Blades of Fury&quot;, originally aired August 7, 2023.

===Sport===
The Greate Pier rugby club in Leeuwarden, which plays on a regional level, is named after Donia in Friesland. Many other clubs and several ships are named after him.

===2020 Omrop Fryslân study===
- In 2020, the Frisian-language broadcasting company Omrop Fryslân conducted a research study, which revealed that 70% of respondents in Friesland considered Donia to be one of the greatest Frisian historical heroes, but more than half of respondents erroneously connected his name to the Battle of Warns (1345), about two centuries before Donia&#x27;s time. A further 40% of respondents believed he had served in the army of Radbod of Frisia, which predated Donia by more than 700 years.

<text>Rhenish Hesse or Rhine Hesse (, ) is a region and a former government district () in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. It is made up of territories west of the Upper Rhine river that were part of the Grand Duchy of Hesse and its successor in the Weimar Republic, the People&#x27;s State of Hesse from 1816 to 1945. The hilly countryside is largely devoted to vineyards, comprising the Rheinhessen wine region.

==Geography==
Rhine Hesse stretches from the Upper Rhine Plain on the west bank of the Rhine up to the Nahe and Alsenz rivers in the west and down to the mouth of the Isenach in the south. The region borders on the Rhineland in the northwest, on the Palatinate in the southwest, and on South Hesse beyond the Rhine. The Rhenish-Hessian Hills along the Selz river, also called the &quot;land of the thousand hills&quot;, reach up to at the summit of the Kappelberg and about in Rhenish-Hessian Switzerland.

The Mainz Basin, a Cenozoic marine basin, covered the area about 38 to 12 million years ago. The landscape is characterised by large Loess and Marl deposits. Due to the favourable climatic conditions of Rhenish Hesse, agriculture covers most of the region. As the Hunsrück and Taunus ranges protect it from cold winds, wine and fruit production is practised on a large scale.

The region comprises the cities of Mainz – the Rhineland-Palatinate capital – and Worms, surrounded by the administrative districts of Mainz-Bingen and Alzey-Worms. Other towns include Bingen, Alzey, Nieder-Olm, Ingelheim, Nierstein, Oppenheim, and Osthofen. Many inhabitants commute to work in Mainz or Wiesbaden and Frankfurt in the neighbouring state of Hesse.

==History==
The importance of the Rhine Hessian lands increased when they were allotted to King Louis the German by the 843 Treaty of Verdun. The region was part of the core territory of Rhenish Franconia. It comprised the Imperial Cathedrals of Worms and Mainz which were erected in the High Middle Ages. The Worms Synagogue and the Jewish Cemetery count among the oldest in Europe. Devastated by the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the area became a patchwork of possessions of the Catholic Electorate of Mainz and the Prince-Bishopric of Worms as well as of the Protestant Electoral Palatinate.

Rhine Hesse was occupied by the First French Republic in 1792, during the War of the First Coalition. At the Congress of Vienna in 1814–15, Grand Duke Louis I of Hesse was obliged to give up his Westphalian territories. In compensation, he received the district on the left bank of the Rhine. Because of this addition, he amended his title to &quot;Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine&quot; and the name of the region was created. In Allied-occupied Germany, the Rhine Hessian lands were incorporated as a district into the newly established state of Rhineland-Palatinate in 1946.

==Cuisine==
Each region has developed its own cuisine dependent on geography, climate, soils, seasons and wealth. These vary from plain home cooking with simple dishes to culinary specialities for festive occasions. Rhine Hesse also has a large number of specialities, with Weck, Worscht un Woi, not least through the Mainz carnival, has achieved supra-regional fame.
* &quot;Backesbroode&quot; – a roast filled with potatoes and bacon
* &quot;Backesgrumbeere&quot; – spiced potato casserole with bacon, wine and sour cream
* &quot;Bremser&quot; or Bitzler – &quot;Federweißer&quot;
* &quot;Dibbehas&quot; – hare stew (&quot;Dibbe&quot;), with hare (wild hare, rabbit), spices and optionally with wine
* Asparagus (&quot;Gemüsespargel&quot;)
* &quot;Hackesweck&quot; – bread roll with highly spiced &quot;Mett&quot; (minced pork) and onions
* &quot;Handkäs&quot; with music – marinaded cheese, a &quot;Mainzer Roller&quot; marinaded in vinegar, oil and onions (&quot;music&quot; because of the subsequent flatulence)
* &quot;Kräppel&quot;, fried dough for Carnival
* &quot;Schales&quot;
* &quot;Spundekäs&quot; – consists of fresh cheese, paprika, onions and other spices
* &quot;Weck, Worscht un Woi&quot;, well known Rhine Hessian snack
* &quot;Weingelee&quot; (wine jelly)
* &quot;Weinsuppe&quot; (wine soup)
* &quot;Wingertsimbs&quot; – typical vineyard snack
* &quot;Wingertsknorze&quot; – rye bread roll with bacon and onions
* &quot;Woihinkelsche&quot;, originally from the Alsace (coq au vin à l’alsacienne), but must include chicken and white wine; not to be confused with the &quot;Weinhähnchen&quot;, an insect
* &quot;Zwiwwelkuche&quot; – Zwiebelkuchen

==Wine growing==

Rhine Hesse is the largest of 13 regions producing German wine. Outside Germany, it is best known as the home of Liebfraumilch. Most is made from white varieties such as Riesling, Silvaner, Müller-Thurgau, Kerner, and Scheurebe. The best-known white wine area is the Rhine Terrace near Oppenheim and Nierstein. Some red varieties are grown, particularly around Ingelheim and Gundersheim, including Pinot noir, Blauer Portugieser, Dornfelder, and the recently established Regent.

<doc id="581876" wikidata="Q217816" url="?curid=581876" title="Limbourg brothers">
<text>The Limbourg brothers (; fl. 1385 – 1416) were Dutch miniature painters (Herman, Paul, and Jean) from the city of Nijmegen. They were active in the early 15th century in France and Burgundy, working in the International Gothic style.

They painted the miniatures and decorated page margins for the best-known late medieval illuminated manuscript, the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, the Belles Heures of Jean de France, Duc de Berry, in both of which their work survives largely complete although, like many grand manuscript projects, the Très Riches Heures was not finished.

==Family background and early life==
A Johannes de Lymborgh appears in mid-14th century archives. He may have come from Limbourg on the Meuse to Nijmegen, then the capital of the duchy of Gelre, and appears to be the father of Arnold de Limbourch, a wood carver and sculptor whose name also appears in medieval archives. In 1385 Arnold married Mechteld Maelwael or Maloeul. She came from a family of craftsmen and painters. Her father and uncle were painters in the employ of the Duke of Guelders, as gilders and as painters of heraldic devices. It was as a heraldic painter that Mechteld&#x27;s brother Jean Malouel received a commission in Paris by Isabeau of Bavaria in 1396, regent regent to her husband Charles VI of France. Within the year Maloul accepted the position as &quot;valet de chambre&quot; and court painter to Charles&#x27;s uncle Philip the Bold, the Duke of Burgundy. 

Arnold and Mechteld had six children over the next decade: the three boys, Herman, Paul, and Jean were born between and ; two more boys in the early 1390s and a daughter in the mid-1390s. In the late 1390s (probably around 1398) Herman and Jean were sent to Paris, where records from 1399 document them as apprentices to a Parisian goldsmith, a position possibly organized by their uncle. That year the goldsmith sent the boys home to Guelders during an outbreak of disease in Paris. They were captured and imprisoned in Brussels, probably because of a conflict between Brabant and Guelders, with their ransom set at 55 &quot;écus&quot; plus prison expenses. The boys&#x27; father had died that year leaving their mother destitute, unable to secure their release. Local guild members in Brussels tried to raise the funds, but six months passed, the boys were still in captivity, when Philip the Bold paid the ransom in May of 1400.

==Philip the Bold==
In February 1402 Paul and Jean were contracted by Philip to work for four years exclusively on illuminating a bible (a &quot;très belle et notable Bible&quot;). It is their first documented commission and the work seems to have been executed in Paris. Art historians are divided as to whether the &quot;Bible Moralisée&quot; ( 166 in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris is the same manuscript as Philip&#x27;s commission;
although there is consensus that manuscript was executed by Jean and Pol Limbourg. 

A bible moralisée is a type of condensed and heavily illustrated bible that emerged in the 13th century. It followed a specific format in which bible passages were paired with commentary or moralizations and an image, with each page containing four pairs of images meant to dominate the page. Typically such a bible contained more than 5000 painted miniatures; the cost and labor involved in such a production was so great that only royalty commissioned them. Manuscript 166 in Paris is an almost verbatim copy of the bible moralisée commissioned by Philip&#x27;s father John II of France, known as 167, which contains 5122 miniatures.

The contract Philip executed with the brothers was quite specific: they were to provide miniatures (&quot;ystoires&quot;) as quickly as possible irrespective of holidays, to be paid a daily rate of 6 sous. Philip&#x27;s physician, Jean Durant, was to supervise the effort, for which he received 600 francs and periodic repayments for lapis lazuli used to produce Illuminated manuscripts. In 1404 the brothers are referred to as &quot;peintres et historieurs&quot;, whereas they were earlier referred to as painters (&quot;peintres&quot;) and illuminators (&quot;enlumineurs&quot;). They almost certainly painted the miniatures as well as the borders. They completed folios 1-24 and the underdrawings to folio 32.

The recorded documentation regarding specific commissions ends with Philip&#x27;s death in April 1404.

==Jean de Berry==

After Philip died the brothers were employed by his brother John, Duke of Berry – an extravagant collector of the arts and books. Their first assignment was to illuminate a book of hours, now known as the Belles Heures du Duc de Berry, now held in The Cloisters of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

Around this period they also painted some pages of the Très Belles Heures de Notre-Dame, a single page added to the Petites Heures de Jean de Berry (perhaps in 1412, now BnF, Paris), and other dispersed pages. 

Between the period of 1408 until their deaths in 1416, the brothers are referenced in 12 extant documents and inventories, recorded by Berry&#x27;s &quot;valet de chambre&quot;. These describe payments and exchanges of valuable gifts. Paul received two diamond rings and an emerald ring in the shape of a bear from the duke as New Year&#x27;s day gifts between 1408 and 1413; 100 ecus &quot;so he could clothe himself and be more honorable in the duke&#x27;s employ&quot;; and all the brothers received rings in 1414 and 1415. In return the brothers reciprocated with lavish gifts. By that time all three brothers had achieved the position of &quot;varlet de chambre&quot;. The duke gifted Paul with a large house in Bourges suitable to &quot;a nobleman of the noble blood&quot;. 

Paul was attracted to a young girl, Gillette la Mercière, but her parents disapproved. The duke had the girl confined, and released her only on the king&#x27;s command. In 1411 Paul and Gillette married anyway, but the marriage remained childless (the girl was 12, her husband 24 at the time).

The Belles Heures was finished in 1409 which was followed by &quot;Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry&quot;, widely regarded as the peak of late medieval book illumination, and possibly the most valuable book in the world. It is kept as 65 in the Musée Condé in Chantilly, France.

==Death==
In the first half of 1416, Jean de Berry and the three Limbourg brothers – all not yet 30 years old – died, possibly of the plague, leaving the &quot;Très Riches Heures&quot; unfinished. An unidentified artist (possibly Barthélemy van Eyck) completed the calendar miniatures in the 1440s when the book apparently was in the possession of René d&#x27;Anjou, and in 1485 Jean Colombe finished the work for the House of Savoy.

The work of the Limbourg brothers, being mostly inaccessible, became forgotten until the 19th century. Nevertheless, they set an example for the next generations of painters, which extended beyond miniature painting. They worked in a Northern European tradition, but display influences from Italian models. Among their own sources of artistic inspiration was the work of the Master of the Brussels Initials.

<text>In computer science, the number of concurrent users (sometimes abbreviated CCU) for a resource in a location, with the location being a computing network or a single computer, refers to the total number of people simultaneously accessing or using the resource. The resource can, for example, be a computer program, a file, or the computer as a whole.

Keeping track of concurrent users is important in several cases. First, some operating system models such as time-sharing operating systems allow several users to access a resource on the computer at the same time. As system performance may degrade due to the complexity of processing multiple jobs from multiple users at the same time, the capacity of such a system may be measured in terms of maximum concurrent users.

Second, commercial software vendors often license a software product by means of a concurrent users restriction. This allows a fixed number of users access to the product at a given time and contrasts with an unlimited user license. For example: Company X buys software and pays for 20 concurrent users. However, there are 100 logins created at implementation. Only 20 of those 100 can be in the system at the same time, this is known as floating licensing.

Concurrent user licensing allows firms to purchase computer systems and software at a lower cost because the maximum number of concurrent users expected to use the system or software at any given time (those users all logged in together) is only a portion of the total system users employed at a company. The concurrent licenses are global and shared by anyone who needs to use the system. This contrasts with &quot;named-seats&quot; licensing, in which one license must be purchased for each and every individual user, whether they are using the system or not.

If a company employs 400 system users in which 275 work during the day and 125 work at night, then they can opt to purchase only 275 concurrent user licenses since there will never be more than 275 users on the system during a normal work day. The night workers share 125 of the day users&#x27; licenses to use the system. For named-seat licenses, this same company would have to purchase 400 individual licenses, one for each user, and licenses would not be globally shared. The available options for licensing are entirely at the discretion of the vendor selling the product.

<doc id="581888" wikidata="Q107780" url="?curid=581888" title="Luminous flux">
<text>In photometry, luminous flux or luminous power is the measure of the perceived power of light. It differs from radiant flux, the measure of the total power of electromagnetic radiation (including infrared, ultraviolet, and visible light), in that luminous flux is adjusted to reflect the varying sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths of light.

==Units==
The SI unit of luminous flux is the lumen (lm). One lumen is defined as the luminous flux of light produced by a light source that emits one candela of luminous intensity over a solid angle of one steradian.

formula_1

In other systems of units, luminous flux may have units of power.

==Weighting==
The luminous flux accounts for the sensitivity of the eye by weighting the power at each wavelength with the luminosity function, which represents the eye&#x27;s response to different wavelengths. The luminous flux is a weighted sum of the power at all wavelengths in the visible band. Light outside the visible band does not contribute. The ratio of the total luminous flux to the radiant flux is called the luminous efficacy. This model of the human visual brightness perception, is standardized by the CIE and ISO.

==Context==
Luminous flux is often used as an objective measure of the useful light emitted by a light source, and is typically reported on the packaging for light bulbs, although it is not always prominent. Consumers commonly compare the luminous flux of different light bulbs since it provides an estimate of the apparent amount of light the bulb will produce, and a lightbulb with a higher ratio of luminous flux to consumed power is more efficient.

Luminous flux is not used to compare brightness, as this is a subjective perception which varies according to the distance from the light source and the angular spread of the light from the source.

==Measurement== 

Luminous flux of artificial light sources is typically measured using an integrating sphere, or a goniophotometer outfitted with a photometer or a spectroradiometer. 
=== Relationship to luminous intensity ===

Luminous flux (in lumens) is a measure of the total amount of light a lamp puts out. The luminous intensity (in candelas) is a measure of how bright the beam in a particular direction is. If a lamp has a 1 lumen bulb and the optics of the lamp are set up to focus the light evenly into a 1 steradian beam, then the beam would have a luminous intensity of 1 candela. If the optics were changed to concentrate the beam into 1/2 steradian then the source would have a luminous intensity of 2 candela. The resulting beam is narrower and brighter, however the luminous flux remains the same.

<text>Carcass Island () is the largest of the West Point Island Group of the Falkland Islands.

==Description==
It lies north-west of West Falkland and south-east of the Jason Islands. It is in length, has a maximum width of , and is in area. The highest points of the island are Stanley Hill and Mount Byng at . The north-eastern coast has cliffs and slopes while there are large sand bays and a tidal rocky point to the north-west. There are also stretches of duneland. Leopard Beach is often used as a landing point.

==History==
The island&#x27;s grim-sounding name comes from the ship HMS &quot;Carcass&quot;, which surveyed the island in 1766. Its accompanying vessel, HMS &quot;Jason&quot;, gave its name to the nearby Jason Islands, and its captain, John MacBride, gave his name to MacBride Head.

It has been run as a sheep farm for over a century and is owned by R. P. McGill. The island&#x27;s three heritage-listed buildings are a boathouse, shed and store. Its small settlement lying on Port Patterson on the southwest coast is also known for its gardens and has a small grocery shop.

Carcass Island was considered as one of the potential sites for a British amphibious landing during the Falklands War; however, the British landings took place on San Carlos Water in the west of East Falkland, on Falkland Sound. The plan would have been for a &quot;stone aircraft carrier&quot;. The main objections to this plan were threefold: 1) Carcass Island, being in the west of the archipelago, was nearest to continental Argentine bases; 2) its proximity to the airbase on Pebble Island; and 3) its remoteness from Stanley, as it was furthest from the main objectives, and West Falkland was ultimately bypassed in the war.

==Flora and fauna==
Though the island has been a sheep farm for more than a century, careful management has preserved its varied habitat and mature tussac grows in replanted coastal paddocks. The island contains one of the few substantial stands of trees in the Falklands. There is however, a true wood at Hill Cove. None of the species are endemic, but they include such exoticisms as Monterey cypress trees and New Zealand cabbage palms. The night herons nest within these trees. The gardens also include other introduced plants such as fuchsias, lupins and dog roses.

The island has no rats or cats, and as a result has a wide variety of birdlife including black-crowned night herons, known in the Falkland Islands as &quot;quarks&quot;, as well as seals and penguins. The several substantial freshwater ponds are important waterfowl sites.

The West Point Island group, which includes Carcass Island, has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). Birds for which the site is of conservation significance include Falkland steamer ducks, ruddy-headed geese, gentoo penguins, southern rockhopper penguins, Magellanic penguins, black-browed albatrosses, striated caracaras, blackish cinclodes, Cobb&#x27;s wrens and white-bridled finches.

<text>Ryde is a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Ryde is located 13 km north-west of the Sydney central business district and 8 km east of Parramatta. Ryde is the administrative centre of the local government area of the City of Ryde and part of the Northern Sydney region. It lies on the north bank of the Parramatta River. People from Ryde are colloquially known as Ryders, Rydiens or Rydemen.

North Ryde, West Ryde, and East Ryde are separate suburbs from Ryde.

==History==
Ryde was named after the town of Ryde on the Isle of Wight, perhaps by G. M. Pope, who came from Ryde on the Isle of Wight, who settled in the area and opened the &quot;Ryde Store&quot;.

Originally known by its Aboriginal name Wallumatta, it was named Eastern Farms when the first 10 land grants were made in 1792. Within a few years this had changed to Kissing Point. The road from Ryde to Parramatta was called Kissing Point Road until changed to Victoria Road in 1887. The name Ryde was used from the 1840s and adopted as the name of the municipality in 1870. The suburb contains the oldest settler&#x27;s cottage in Australia, Addington, on Victoria Road. Addington was built by the emancipist James Stewart, . James Shepherd bought the property in 1810 and added a six-room house to the original sandstone cottage. Addington House, also known as &quot;New Farm&quot;, is included on the NSW Heritage Register and the National Trust of NSW.

Other historic buildings in the area include the police station on Victoria Road and Willandra, Willandra Street. The police station, a simple sandstone structure, was designed by Colonial Architect Mortimer Lewis and built in 1837. Willandra is a two-storey Georgian home built by the Devlin family , and more recently used as an art gallery and headquarters for the Ryde and District Historical Society. Both Willandra and the police station are listed on the Register of the National Estate.

In 1892, the public school at 2 Tucker Street was opened. The building, which still survives, is the Infants Department, a two-storey, sandstone building which is heritage-listed.

The cottage Riversdale, in Wade Street, was the home of a well-known riverboat captain by the name of Robert Gascoigne, who lived in the area . In 1973 a Builders Labourers Federation organised a green ban to save Dunbar Park from becoming a rubbish tip.

As Ryde was located at the top of the hill it also became known as &#x27;Top Ryde&#x27;. Ryde Swimming Centre was demolished and rebuilt as Ryde Aquatic Leisure Centre, and hosted events of the 2000 Summer Olympics.

===Trams===

The majority of services operated from Fort Macquarie and Circular Quay down George Street to Broadway and Parramatta Road. In the peak hours and other busy periods, supplementary services operated from Railway Square.

Tram services to Drummoyne and Ryde were serviced by the Rozelle Tram Depot. The service, after departing the depot traveled along The Crescent and Commercial Road (now City West Link Road) in Glebe, turning left onto Victoria Road. It then crossed the Iron Cove Bridge and the former Gladesville Bridge before turning right onto Blaxland Road. It then wound its way along Blaxland Road, behind the site of the current council chambers, terminating near the intersection of Pope and Devlin Street in Ryde.

<text>In BDSM, a collar is a device of any material worn by a person to indicate their submissive or slave status in a BDSM relationship. A person wearing a collar to symbolize their relationship with another is said to be collared. Collars are used to signify ownership or connection within a dom/sub relationship. The collar may also be worn by the submissive as a visual indication to others.

Collars come in many forms, from practical leather straps to elegant metal chokers or chains. The choice of collar can reflect the personalities and tastes of the dominant and submissive, as well as the nature of their relationship. For many, wearing a collar is a deeply meaningful act that symbolizes commitment, trust, and the power dynamics between partners.

Some submissives may wear &quot;day-collars&quot;. These are typically items of jewellery (though can be any item of clothing) containing an O-ring. They are frequently used in scenarios in which it would be inappropriate for the submissive to be collared but their dominant wishes for them to be collared.

<doc id="581898" wikidata="Q1072126" url="?curid=581898" title="P-700 Granit">
<text>The P-700 &quot;Granit (; ) is a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Military of Russia|Russian naval]] [[anti-ship missile|anti-ship]] [[cruise missile]]. Its [[GRAU]] designation is3M45, its [[NATO reporting name]]SS-N-19 &quot;Shipwreck. It comes in surface-to-surface and submarine-launched variants, and can also be used against ground targets.

==Design and building==
The P-700 was designed in the 1970s to replace the P-70 Ametist and P-120 Malakhit, both effective missiles but with too short a range in the face of improving weapons of U.S. Navy carrier battle groups. The missile was partially derived from the P-500 Bazalt.

Built by Chelomei/NPO Mashinostroenia, the bulging 10 m missile has swept-back wings and tail, weighs around 7,000 kilograms and can be fitted with either a 750 kg HE warhead, a FAE warhead, or a 500 kt thermonuclear warhead. A stubby cylindrical solid-fuel rocket is fitted to the rear for launch; this booster stage is released when the missile enters sustained flight. For many years it was believed that this missile used a turbojet engine during the sustained flight; after Russian and Western media gained access to its performance characteristics, it was understood that its propulsion system was a ramjet.

The P-700 has a distinctive annular air intake in the nose. Maximum speed is believed to be between Mach 1.6 and Mach 2.5. Range has been estimated at 400 km, 500 km, and 550–625 km. The guidance system is mixed-mode, with inertial guidance, terminal active radar homing guidance and also anti-radar homing. Mid-course correction is probable.

It is widely claimed that the missile, when fired in a swarm (group of 4–8) has a unique guidance mode. One of the weapons climbs to a higher altitude and designates targets while the others attack. The missile responsible for target designation climbs in short pop-ups, so as to be harder to intercept. The missiles are linked by data connections, forming a network. If the designating missile is destroyed the next missile will rise to assume its purpose. Missiles are able to differentiate targets, detect groups and prioritize targets automatically using information gathered during flight and types of ships and battle formations pre-programmed in an onboard computer. They will attack targets in order of priority, highest to lowest: after destroying the first target, any remaining missiles will attack the next prioritized target. Such description received some doubts. The missile has a means of countering the attacking anti-missiles. Also, the on-board computer carries data designed to counter an enemy&#x27;s electronic warfare and to evade counter-measures.

The P-700 was derived from the P-500 Bazalt missile with a turbojet. The P-700 was in turn developed into the P-800 Oniks, which uses ramjet propulsion, and the BrahMos missile, a joint Indian/Russian modernization of the P-800.

==Deployment==

Initial deployment was aboard the cruiser &quot;Kirov&quot; (now the &quot;Admiral Ushakov&quot;) in 1980 and the missile entered service on 19 July 1983.

Unusually for an aircraft carrier, the &quot;Kuznetsov&quot;-class also carried 12 Granit launchers. This gave the &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot; an additional primary attack capability, but also had the political advantage of classing the vessel as an aircraft cruiser instead. Unconfirmed reports say that the missiles were removed in 2000, to provide more aircraft hangar space.

It is currently in service with the Russian Northern Fleet on the s &quot;Admiral Nakhimov&quot; and &quot;Pyotr Velikyi&quot;, and with the Russian Northern and Pacific fleets as the main weapon of the cruise missile submarines.

The &quot;Kursk&quot; carried 24 missiles when it sank following a torpedo explosion during an exercise on 12 August 2000. The Russian navy was extremely concerned about possible NATO attempts to recover a missile and guarded the site of the wreck throughout the recovery effort. The missiles were recovered intact following a $65 million salvage operation.

The size of the missile limits the platforms on which it can operate and be launched from. It has only been deployed from &quot;Oscar&quot;-class submarines, &quot;Kirov&quot;-class battlecruisers, and the &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot; aircraft carrier. Ships of all three types will have their Granit missiles replaced with new launch cells to carry smaller Oniks and Kalibr cruise missiles in greater numbers.

==P-1000 Vulkan deployment==
The P-1000 missile was partially derived from the P-500 and P-700. Its maximum speed is claimed to be between Mach 1.5 - Mach 2.5 depending on altitude, and its range is claimed to be between 700 and 1000 km (800). Warhead: 500 kg. Years of production 1985–1992. The body of the missile resembles that of the P-500, but it has the ability of the P-700 to overcome defensive countermeasures. Long range missile can achieve the target only at low altitudes (up to 25 meters or lower) approximation (in which case the maximum range is less than 500 km).

===Substitution in 2018===
Officially - are being replaced by the Zircon (missile).

<doc id="581899" wikidata="Q658388" url="?curid=581899" title="MOSIX">
<text>MOSIX is a proprietary distributed operating system. Although early versions were based on older UNIX systems, since 1999 it focuses on Linux clusters and grids. In a MOSIX cluster/grid there is no need to modify or to link applications with any library, to copy files or login to remote nodes, or even to assign processes to different nodes – it is all done automatically, like in an SMP.

== History ==
MOSIX has been researched and developed since 1977 at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem by the research team of Prof. Amnon Barak. So far, ten major versions have been developed. The first version, called MOS, for &quot;Multicomputer OS&quot;, (1981–83) was based on Bell Lab&#x27;s Seventh Edition Unix and ran on a cluster of PDP-11 computers. Later versions were based on Unix System V Release 2 (1987–89) and ran on a cluster of VAX and NS32332-based computers, followed by a BSD/OS-derived version (1991–93) for a cluster of 486/Pentium computers. Since 1999 MOSIX is tuned to Linux for x86 platforms.

=== MOSIX2 ===
The second version of MOSIX, called MOSIX2, compatible with Linux-2.6 and 3.0 kernels. MOSIX2 is implemented as an OS virtualization layer that provides users and applications with a single system image with the Linux run-time environment. It allows applications to run in remote nodes as if they run locally. Users run their regular (sequential and parallel) applications while MOSIX transparently and automatically seek resources and migrate processes among nodes to improve the overall performance.

MOSIX2 can manage a cluster and a multicluster (grid) as well as workstations and other shared resources. Flexible management of a grid allows owners of clusters to share their computational resources, while still preserving their autonomy over their own clusters and their ability to disconnect their nodes from the grid at any time, without disrupting already running programs.

A MOSIX grid can extend indefinitely as long as there is trust between its cluster owners. This must include guarantees that guest applications will not be modified while running in remote clusters and that no hostile computers can be connected to the local network. Nowadays these requirements are standard within clusters and organizational grids.

MOSIX2 can run in native mode or in a virtual machine (VM). In native mode, performance is better, but it requires modifications to the base Linux kernel, whereas a VM can run on top of any unmodified operating system that supports virtualization, including Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

MOSIX2 is most suitable for running compute intensive applications with low to moderate amount of input/output (I/O). Tests of MOSIX2 show that the performance of several such applications over a 1 Gbit/s campus grid is nearly identical to that of a single cluster.

==== Main features ====
* Provides aspects of a single-system image:
** Users can login on any node and do not need to know where their programs run.
** No need to modify or link applications with special libraries.
** No need to copy files to remote nodes.
* Automatic resource discovery and workload distribution by process migration:
** Load-balancing.
** Migrating processes from slower to faster nodes and from nodes that run out of free memory.
* Migratable sockets for direct communication between migrated processes.
* Secure run time environment (sandbox) for guest processes.
* Live queuing – queued jobs preserve their full generic Linux environment.
* Batch jobs.
* Checkpoint and recovery.
* Tools: automatic installation and configuration scripts, on-line monitors.

==== MOSIX for HPC ====
MOSIX is most suitable for running HPC applications with low to moderate amount of I/O. Tests of MOSIX show that the performance of several such applications over a 1 Gbit/s campus grid is nearly identical to that of a single cluster. It is particularly suitable for:

* Efficient utilization of grid-wide resources, by automatic resource discovery and load-balancing.
* Running applications with unpredictable resource requirements or run times.
* Running long processes, which are automatically sent to grid nodes and are migrated back when these nodes are disconnected from the grid.
* Combining nodes of different speeds, by migrating processes among nodes based on their respective speeds, current load, and available memory.

A few examples:

* Scientific applications – genomic, protein sequences, molecular dynamics, quantum dynamics, nano-technology and other parallel HPC applications.
* Engineering applications – CFD, weather forecasting, crash simulations, oil industry, ASIC design, pharmaceutical and other HPC applications.

=== MOSIX4 ===
MOSIX4 was released in July 2014. As of version 4, MOSIX doesn&#x27;t require kernel patching.

== openMosix ==
After MOSIX became proprietary software in late 2001, Moshe Bar forked the last free version and started the openMosix project on February 10, 2002.

On July 15, 2007, Bar decided to end the openMosix project effective March 1, 2008, claiming that &quot;the increasing power and availability of low cost multi-core processors is rapidly making single-system image (SSI) clustering less of a factor in computing&quot;. These plans were reconfirmed in March 2008. The LinuxPMI project is continuing development of the former openMosix code.

<doc id="581902" wikidata="Q4927358" url="?curid=581902" title="Blog for America">
<text>Blog for America was the title of the official Howard Dean campaign blog from March 2003 to March, 2004. It was previously known as the Dean Call To Action blog, the first presidential campaign weblog, founded by Mathew Gross on March 15, 2003, but became BFA when it was rebuilt using Movable Type by Marc Chadwick and Mathew Gross. It is widely recognized as the first effective campaign blog, and is credited (along with the Howard Dean Meetup) with enabling a new paradigm for grassroots campaigning. Using the blog, Dean campaign members were able to effectively communicate with supporters, posting frequent updates on the candidate, his supporters, his organization, his views, and his detractors. The comments section of Blog for America was noted for high activity and loyalty, and was an effective means of self-organization for Dean&#x27;s committed followers. The blog is also credited with powering the Dean campaign&#x27;s impressive fundraising abilities during the 2004 Democratic presidential primary.

However, the limits of the blog&#x27;s effectiveness as a campaign tool were seen in Iowa and New Hampshire, where despite a large financial, media, and organizational head start, Dean made a poor showing in voter support.

Technological issues often created havoc for the blog&#x27;s administrators and visitors. For example, a common device used by trolls was to spoof the usernames of existing members using a loophole in the member naming conventions. Although the bug in the blog software was never found, to the administrators&#x27; credit, these trolls were quickly blocked. In October 2006, new blog software was released which corrected the spoofing problems of the previous version.

Blog for America was transformed in March, 2004 into the house blog for the grassroots recruitment organization Democracy for America, paralleling the conversion of the campaign into a Democratic non-profit organization.

<doc id="581903" wikidata="Q5450226" url="?curid=581903" title="Finger cot">
<text>A finger cot (also finger frock or finger stall, informally finger condom) is used to cover one or more fingers in situations where a full glove seems unnecessary. Like medical and rubber gloves, finger cots may be made from a variety of water-tight materials including latex, nitrile rubber, and vinyl.

A toe protector or toe cap is very similar, but shorter and of greater diameter. The function is not so much to prevent contamination—toes are normally contained within footwear that protects them—but to protect an injured toe against further damage from friction and pressure by continual rubbing against other toes and shoes. They are consequently made partly or wholly of a soft material such as a mineral oil gel, and the end may be either open or closed.

==In medicine==
They are used in medicine to limit patient exposure to infection, and to protect health professionals from contact with bodily fluids that can transmit disease. Finger cots can be used in a wide scope of medical procedures and examinations, for example, when applying a topical medication or during digital rectal examination. Finger cots may be used when bandaging a finger to secure the dressing and keep it dry. The term &quot;fyngyr stalle&quot; was recorded in 1483; &quot;cot&quot; has been used since 1617. Early stalls were usually made of leather.

==In voting==
Finger cots have been used during the COVID-19 pandemic to limit contamination for voters using touch-screen voting systems in the 2020 U.S. elections.

==In the workplace==
Finger cots have applications in many workplaces, mainly to protect objects which can be damaged by exposure to the skin&#x27;s natural oils, skin particles, and dirt on hands. In electronics manufacturing, e.g., the manufacture of semiconductors, finger cots are used while handling such components. In watchmaking they are used to protect delicate watch parts. In art conservation and restoration they protect works of art from contamination which can have detrimental effects over time. In jobs that require labor with the hands, such as automobile repair or cooking, finger cots may be used to protect and isolate an injured finger.

Thimblettes (also known as rubber finger, banker&#x27;s friend, rubber thimbles and finger cones) are soft thimbles, made predominantly of rubber, used primarily for leafing through or counting documents, bank notes, tickets, or forms. They also protect against paper cuts as a secondary function.

== Other uses ==
Finger cots can be used as a protective barrier during sexual intercourse to decrease the risk of sexually transmitted infection.

Finger cots can also be used as a picking barrier for people with dermatillomania.

<doc id="581908" wikidata="Q2302908" url="?curid=581908" title="Mount Sibayak">
<text>Mount Sibayak () is a stratovolcano overlooking the town of Berastagi in northern Sumatra, Indonesia. Although its last eruption was more than a century ago, geothermal activity in the form of steam vents and hot springs remains high on and around the volcano. The vents produce crystalline sulfur, which was mined on a small scale in the past. Seepage of sulfurous gases has also caused acidic discolouration of the small crater lake.

Sibayak is a term from the Karo Batak language referring to a founding community. Mount Sibayak is relatively easy to climb and has been a tourist attraction since colonial times.

On July 11, 1979, a Fokker F28 operating under Garuda Indonesian Airways crashed into this mountain.

<doc id="581913" wikidata="Q764759" url="?curid=581913" title="Directional selection">
<text>In population genetics, directional selection is a type of [[natural selection]] in which one extreme phenotype is favored over both the other extreme and moderate phenotypes. This genetic selection causes the allele frequency to shift toward the chosen extreme over time as allele ratios change from generation to generation. The advantageous extreme allele will increase in frequency among the population as a consequence of survival and reproduction differences among the different present phenotypes in the population. The allele fluctuations as a result of directional selection can be independent of the dominance of the allele, and in some cases if the allele is recessive, it can eventually become fixed in the population.

Directional selection was first identified and described by naturalist Charles Darwin in his book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; published in 1859. He identified it as a type of natural selection along with stabilizing selection and disruptive selection. These types of selection also operate by favoring a specific allele and influencing the population&#x27;s future phenotypic ratio. Disruptive selection favors both extreme phenotypes while the moderate phenotype will be selected against. The frequency of both extreme alleles will increase while the frequency of the moderate allele will decrease, differing from the trend in directional selection in which only one extreme allele is favored. Stabilizing selection favors the moderate phenotype and will select against both extreme phenotypes. Directional selection can be observed in finch beak size, peppered moth color, African cichlid mouth types, and sockeye salmon migration periods.

If there is continuous allele frequency change as a result of directional selection generation from generation, there will be observable changes in the phenotypes of the entire population over time. Directional selection can change the genotypic and phenotypic variation of a population and cause a trend toward one specific phenotype. This selection is an important mechanism in the selection of complex and diversifying traits, and is also a primary force of speciation. Changes in a genotype and consequently a phenotype can either be advantageous, harmful, or neutral and depend on the environment in which the phenotypic shift is happening.

== Evidence ==
=== Detection methods ===
Directional selection most often occurs during environmental changes or population migrations to new areas with different environmental pressures. Directional selection allows for swift changes in allele frequency that can accompany rapidly changing environmental factors and plays a major role in speciation. Analysis on quantitative trait locus (QTL) effects has been used to examine the impact of directional selection in phenotypic diversification. QTL is a region of a gene that corresponds to a specific phenotypic trait, and the measuring the statistical frequencies of the traits can be helpful in analyzing phenotypic trends. In one study, the analysis showed that directional changes in QTLs affecting various traits were more common than expected by chance among diverse species. This was an indication that directional selection is a primary cause of the phenotypic diversification that can eventually result in speciation.

There are different statistical tests that can be run to test for the presence of directional selection in a population. A highly indicative test of changes in allele frequencies is the QTL sign test, and other tests include the Ka/Ks ratio test and the relative rate test. The QTL sign test compares the number of antagonistic QTL to a neutral model, and allows for testing of directional selection against genetic drift. The Ka/Ks ratio test compares the number of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions, and a ratio that is greater than 1 indicates directional selection. The relative ratio test looks at the accumulation of advantageous traits against a neutral model, but needs a phylogenetic tree for comparison. This can prove difficult if the full phylogenic history is not known or is not specific enough for the test comparison.

==Examples==
=== Finch beak size ===

Another example of directional selection is the beak size in a specific population of finches. Darwin first observed this in the publication of his book, &quot;On the Origin of Species,&quot; and he details how the size of the finches beak differs based on environmental factors. On the Galápagos Islands west of the coast of Ecuador, there were groups of finches displaying different beak phenotypes. In one group, the beaks ranged from large and tough to small and smooth. Throughout the wet years, small seeds were more common than large seeds, and because of the large supply of small seeds the finches rarely ate large seeds. During the dry years, neither the small or large seeds were in great abundance, and the birds trended towards eating larger seeds. The changes in diet of the finches based on the environmental wet and dry seasons affected the depth of the birds’ beaks in future generations. The beaks most beneficial to the more plentiful type of seed would be selected for because the birds were able to feed themselves and reproduce.
=== Peppered moths ===
A significant example of directional selection in populations is the fluctuations of light and dark phenotypes in peppered moths in the 1800s. During the industrial revolution, environmental conditions were rapidly changing with the newfound emission of dark, black smoke from factories that would change the color of trees, rocks, and other niches of moths. Before the industrial revolution, the most prominent phenotype in the peppered moth population was the lighter, speckled moths. They thrived on the light birch trees and their phenotype would provide them with better camouflage from predators. After the Industrial Revolution as the trees become darker with soot, the moths with the darker phenotype were able to blend in and avoid predators better than their white counterparts. As time went on, the darker moths were positively directionally selected for and the allele frequency began to shift due to the increase in the number of darker moths.

===African cichlids===
African cichlids are known to be a diverse fish species, with evidence indicating that they evolved extremely quickly. These fish evolved within the same habitat, but have a variety of morphologies, especially pertaining to the mouth and jaw. Experiments pertaining the cichlid jaw phenotypes was done by Albertson and others in 2003 by crossing two species of African cichlids with very different mouth morphologies. The cross between &quot;Labeotropheus fuelleborni&quot; (subterminal mouth for biting algae off rocks) and &quot;Metriaclima zebra&quot; (terminal mouth for suction feeding) allowed for mapping of QTLs affecting feeding morphology. Using the QTL sign test, definitive evidence was used to support the existence of directional selection in the oral jaw apparatus in African cichlids. However, this was not the case for the suspensorium or skull QTLs, suggesting genetic drift or stabilizing selection as mechanisms for the speciation. 

===Sockeye salmon===

Sockeye salmon are one of the many species of fish that are anadromous, in which individuals migrate to the same rivers in which they were born to reproduce. These migrations happen around the same time every year, but a 2007 study shows that sockeye salmon found in the waters of the Bristol Bay in Alaska have recently undergone directional selection on the timing of migration. In this study, two populations of sockeye salmon, Egegik and Ugashik, were observed. Data from 1969–2003 provided by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game were divided into five sets of seven years and plotted for average arrival to the fishery. After analyzing the data, it was determined that in both populations the average migration date was earlier and the populations were undergoing directional selection as a result of changing ecological conditions. The Egegik population experienced stronger selection and the migration date shifted four days. The paper suggests that fisheries can be a factor driving this selection because fishing occurs more often in the later periods of migration (especially in the Egegik district), preventing those fish from reproducing. This discovery also goes to show that in addition to environmental changes, human behaviors can also have massive effects on the selection of species around them. 

=== Bears hunting sockeye salmon ===

Studies carried out in Little Togiak Lake in Alaska, indicate that bear predation has a significant impact on sockeye salmon populations, especially in shallow streams. Bears often focus on larger male salmon and tend to prefer those that have just arrived at the spawning grounds, particularly in smaller streams where they can catch them more easily. This predation may accelerate the aging of salmon by favoring later arrivals. Additionally, the impact of predation varies among different salmon populations based on their habitat and density; it tends to be more selective in areas where fish are readily accessible. While high levels of bear predation can occur, healthy salmon populations usually maintain strong reproductive potential, although the effects are more pronounced when populations are low. Overall, these dynamics illustrate how bear predation affects salmon behavior and life cycles, influencing their evolutionary processes. 

=== Large Felids ===
This study examines the role of lineage-specific directional selection on body size evolution in felids, revealing that several species, including those in the &quot;Panthera&quot; genus (lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars, snow leopards), the cheetah, and the puma, exhibit evidence of directional selection favoring larger body mass. These larger body sizes are likely linked to hunting large prey and solitary hunting strategies, which favor physical strength and size. Conversely, the clouded leopard did not show evidence of directional selection for body size, suggesting different ecological pressures, and the jaguarundi showed no clear selection for smaller size despite being smaller than its relatives. These findings highlight that body size evolution in felids is not uniform and is strongly influenced by ecological factors such as prey size and hunting behavior. The study concludes that directional selection for increased body size is likely associated with the need for larger predators to capture large prey, and solitary hunting may accelerate this selection, although the evolutionary paths for different felid lineages can vary considerably.

=== Soapberry Bugs ===

Soapberry Bugs (&quot;Jadera haematoloma&quot;) primarily feed on seeds produced by plants of the Sapindaceae family. These soapberry bugs use their beaks to feed on the seeds within the fruits of these plants, so it is crucial that their beak size is long enough to reach the seeds from the exterior of the fruits. However, the distance from the exterior of the fruit to the seed can vary. Scott Carroll and Christin Boyd (1992) conducted an experiment where they would observe how three newly introduced plant species introduced to North America that were colonized by these soapberry bugs would affect the natural selection of the insect’s beak length. Each new plant species hosted fruits of different sizes compared to the native hosts. They found that there was indeed a close correlation between the radius of the fruit and the length of the beak. There was a positive directional selection for larger beaks when the radius of the fruit was larger, and there was a positive directional selection for smaller beaks when the radius of the fruit was smaller. To confirm that these differences were caused by genetic differences and not through phenotypic plasticity, Carroll raised young soapberry bugs from the populations based on the introduced plant species and found that their beak length was retained when they were developed on the alternative host. 

==Ecological impact==
Directional selection can quickly lead to vast changes in allele frequencies in a population because of the cumulative nature of reproduction of the fittest. Because the main cause for directional selection is different and changing environmental pressures, rapidly changing environments, such as those affected by climate change, can cause drastic changes within populations.

=== Diversity ===
Limiting the number of genotypes in a certain population can be deleterious to the ecosystem as a whole by shrink the potential genetic gene pool. Low amount of genetic variation can lead to mass extinctions and endangered species because of the large impact one mutation can have on the entire population if there are only a few specific genes present throughout.

=== Urban Influence ===
It is important to note the impact that humans have on genetic diversity as well, and be aware of the ways to reduce harmful impacts on natural environments. Major roads, waterway pollution, and urbanization all cause environmental selection and could potentially result in changes in allele frequencies. Hunting may also play a role in directional selection, albeit more so in smaller populations. 

==Timescale==
Typically directional selection acts strongly for short bursts and is not sustained over long periods of time. If it was sustained, a population might hit biological constraints such that it no longer responds to selection. However, it is possible for directional selection to take a very long time to find a local optimum on a fitness landscape. A possible example of long-term directional selection is the tendency of proteins to become more hydrophobic over time, and to have their hydrophobic amino acids more interspersed along the sequence.

<doc id="581914" wikidata="Q60934" url="?curid=581914" title="Roland Koch">
<text>Roland Koch (born 24 March 1958) is a German jurist and former conservative politician of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). He was the 7th Minister President of Hesse from 7 April 1999, immediately becoming the 53rd President of the Bundesrat, completing the term begun by his predecessor as Minister President, Hans Eichel, until his resignation on 31 August 2010. During his time in office, Koch was widely regarded as one of Chancellor Angela Merkel&#x27;s main rivals within the CDU.

==Early life and education==

Koch was born in Frankfurt am Main. He studied law and graduated in 1985. In 1979, Koch became the youngest person to hold the office of chairman of the CDU in Main-Taunus district.

==Political career==
From 1983 until 1987, Koch served as vice-chair of the federal youth organization of the CDU.

In the 1987 state elections, Koch was elected to the State Parliament of Hesse. From 1989 until 1997 he was also a member of the Main-Taunus district council and parliamentary leader of the local CDU group. In 1991 he became vice-chair of the CDU parliamentary group, and in 1993 its chair. Until then Koch had been a city council member in his hometown of Eschborn. 

From 1998 onward, Koch was chair of the CDU in Hesse.

===Minister-President of Hesse, 1999-2010===
In the state elections in 1999, the CDU began collecting signatures to document the resistance in the population to plans of the federal government to make dual citizenship easier for foreigners to obtain. Because some people viewed this as &quot;collecting signatures against foreigners&quot;, this campaign was portrayed as &quot;xenophobic&quot;. Koch won the election and displaced the incumbent, Hans Eichel. Under his leadership, the CDU achieved the best result for the party there in 60 years.

In 2003, Koch and Peer Steinbrück, the Social Democrat premier of North Rhine Westphalia, together drew up a plan to reduce tax breaks and subsidies, including those on coal by 12 percent over several years. The subsidies were a particularly sensitive issue in North Rhine-Westphalia, where most of the coal mines are located.

Ahead of the 2004 German presidential election, Koch publicly endorsed Wolfgang Schäuble as the Christian Democrats’s candidate to succeed incumbent President Johannes Rau. 

Under the leadership of party chairwoman Angela Merkel, Koch was elected vice-chairman of the CDU in November 2006, alongside Jürgen Rüttgers, Annette Schavan and Christian Wulff. By 2007, he and Rüttgers, his counterpart from the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, agreed on approving a merger of their respective state-owned banks, WestLB and Landesbank Hessen-Thüringen (Helaba). WestLB was eventually broken up in 2012 after years of losses and controversy.

Prior to the Hesse state election of 2008 Koch was once again accused of using xenophobic tactics by pledging to get tough on youth crime, which is concentrated among immigrant and minority groups. In the course of the election he lost his party&#x27;s majority in the Hessian Parliament, but remained acting Minister President as his SPD challenger Andrea Ypsilanti was unable to form a government.
Since none of the parties was able to build a majority coalition, they decided to give the voters another chance to produce a workable result.

In the January 2009 election the FDP made significant gains which allowed Koch to form a conservative-liberal coalition government, reelecting him as the Minister President of the State of Hesse. Ahead of the 2009 federal elections, he was tipped as a potential finance or economics minister in a coalition government of CDU/CSU and FDP.

In his capacity as Minister-President, Koch held various other positions, including the following:
* Fraport, Chairman of the Supervisory Board (1999-2003)
* ZDF, Member of the Board of Directors (2002-2011)
* Hessische Kulturstiftung, Chairman of the Board of Trustees

On 25 May 2010 Koch announced his withdrawal from the active politics. At the time, he said he had informed Merkel of his plan to leave politics more than a year before. He resigned as Minister-President of Hesse on 31 August 2010. He hinted that he was departing politics in order to become active in the business world.

===Political positions===
Koch was seen as a rhetorically gifted politician; critics have accused him of populism.
A sometimes polarizing figure on his party&#x27;s right, Koch proved to be one of the main defenders of business and financial interests within his party. In 2010, Koch and Merkel clashed over budget cuts, as Koch proposed cutbacks in education and research that Merkel opposed. He also suggested that a law passed to provide a guaranteed child-care facilities for children under 3 would have to be reconsidered. In his final years as Minister-President, he largely worked smoothly with Merkel. Ahead of the Christian Democrats’ leadership election in 2018, Koch publicly endorsed Friedrich Merz to succeed Angela Merkel as the party&#x27;s chair.

On foreign policy, Koch forged a friendship with the Dalai Lama and supported the self-determination of Tibet.

==Life after politics==
On 29 October 2010, Koch was announced as designated chief executive officer of Bilfinger Berger, Germany&#x27;s second-largest builder. In the following years, he orchestrated a reshuffle at the company away from civil engineering and construction in favor of higher-margin industrial services. During his tenure, Bilfinger Berger also agreed with the United States Department of Justice in 2013 to pay $32 million to resolve U.S. criminal charges that it bribed Nigerian officials to obtain contracts on a gas project in the African nation. In August 2014, he stepped down from the position on mutually agreed terms after he took responsibility for two profit warnings.

In 2015, Koch opened a law firm in Frankfurt. Since 2017, he has also been a Professor of Management Practice in Regulated Environments at the Frankfurt School of Finance &amp; Management.

Koch was a CDU delegate to the Federal Convention for the purpose of electing the President of Germany in 2017 in 2022.

==Other activities==
===Corporate boards===
* Dussmann Verwaltungs AG, Member of the Supervisory Board (since 2017)
* Vodafone Germany, Member of the Supervisory Board (since 2015)
* UBS Deutschland, Chairman of the Supervisory Board (2011–2021)
===Non-profit organizations===
* Ludwig Erhard Foundation, Chairman of the Board (since 2020)

* American Chamber of Commerce in Germany (AmCham Germany), Member of the Board of Directors
* German Tuberous Sclerosis Association, Patron (since 2010)
* Rheingau Musik Festival, Chairman of the Board of Trustees
* Senckenberg Nature Research Society, Member of the Board of Trustees
* Städel Museum, Member of the Board of Trustees

==Recognition==
* 2018 – Alfred Dregger Medal

==Controversy==
In February 2018, Bilfinger announced it would sue Koch and other former executives of the company for at least 100 million euros ($123 million) in damages for alleged breaches of duty in compliance and mergers.

==Personal life==
His father Karl-Heinz Koch was a politician in Hessen. Koch and his wife Anke have two sons. He is a Roman Catholic.

<doc id="581916" wikidata="Q507802" url="?curid=581916" title="Clements Markham">
<text>Sir Clements Robert Markham (20 July 1830 – 30 January 1916) was an English geographer, explorer and writer. He was secretary of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) between 1863 and 1888, and later served as the Society&#x27;s president for a further 12 years. In the latter capacity he was mainly responsible for organising the British National Antarctic Expedition of 1901–1904, and for launching the polar career of Robert Falcon Scott.

Markham began his career as a Royal Navy cadet and midshipman, during which time he went to the Arctic with in one of the many searches for Franklin&#x27;s lost expedition. Later, Markham served as a geographer to the India Office, and was responsible for the collection of cinchona plants from their native Peruvian forests, and their transplantation in India. By this means, the Indian government acquired a home source from which quinine could be extracted. Markham also served as geographer to Sir Robert Napier&#x27;s Abyssinian expeditionary force, and was present in 1868, at the fall of Magdala.

The main achievement of Markham&#x27;s RGS presidency was the revival at the end of the 19th century of British interest in Antarctic exploration, after a 50-year interval. He had strong and determined ideas about how the National Antarctic Expedition should be organised, and fought hard to ensure that it was run primarily as a naval enterprise, under Scott&#x27;s command. To do this he overcame hostility and opposition from much of the scientific community. In the years following the expedition he continued to champion Scott&#x27;s career, to the extent of disregarding or disparaging the achievements of other contemporary explorers.

All his life Markham was a constant traveller and a prolific writer, his works including histories, travel accounts and biographies. He authored many papers and reports for the RGS, and did much editing and translation work for the Hakluyt Society, of which he also became president in 1890. He received public and academic honours, and was recognised as a major influence on the discipline of geography, although it was acknowledged that much of his work was based on enthusiasm rather than scholarship. Among the geographical features bearing his name is Antarctica&#x27;s Mount Markham, named after him by Scott in 1902.

== Early life ==
Markham was born on 20 July 1830, at Stillingfleet, now in North Yorkshire, the second son of the Reverend David Frederick Markham, then vicar of Stillingfleet. The family were descendants of William Markham, former Archbishop of York and royal tutor; this Court connection led to David Markham&#x27;s appointment, in 1827, as an honorary canon of Windsor.
Markham&#x27;s mother Catherine, née Milner, was the daughter of Sir William Milner, 4th Baronet, of Nun Appleton Hall, Yorkshire.

In 1838, David Markham was appointed rector of Great Horkesley, near Colchester, Essex. A year later, Clements began his schooling, first at Cheam School, and later at Westminster School. Reportedly an apt pupil, he showed particular interest in geology and astronomy, and from an early age he wrote prolifically, an activity which filled much of his spare time. At Westminster, which he found &quot;a wonderful and delightful place&quot;, he developed a particular interest in boating, often acting as coxswain in races on the River Thames.

== Royal Navy ==

=== Naval cadet, 1844–1850 ===

In May 1844, Markham was introduced by his aunt, the Countess of Mansfield, to Rear Admiral Sir George Seymour, a Lord of the Admiralty. The boy made a favourable impression on the admiral, and the meeting led to the offer of a cadetship in the Royal Navy. Accordingly, on 28 June 1844, Markham travelled to Portsmouth to join Seymour&#x27;s flagship, . &quot;Collingwood&quot; was being fitted out for an extended voyage to the Pacific Ocean where Seymour was to assume command of the Pacific station. This tour of duty lasted for almost four years. The ship reached the Chilean port of Valparaíso, the headquarters of the Pacific station on 15 December 1844, after a cruise that incorporated visits to Rio de Janeiro and the Falkland Islands, and a stormy passage in the Southern Ocean. Markham&#x27;s social connections assured him of a relatively comfortable time; he was frequently invited to dine with the admiral, whose wife and daughters were on board.
After a few weeks&#x27; respite in Valparaiso, &quot;Collingwood&quot; sailed again, this time for Callao, the main port on the Peruvian coast, giving Markham his first experience of a country that would figure prominently in his later career. During the next two years &quot;Collingwood&quot; cruised in the Pacific, visiting the Sandwich Islands, Mexico, and Tahiti, where Markham attempted to assist the nationalist rebels against their French governor. On 25 June 1846, Markham passed the examination for midshipman, being placed third in a group of ten. The long periods spent in Chilean and Peruvian ports had also enabled him to learn Spanish.

Towards the end of the voyage, Markham experienced growing doubts about a conventional naval career; he now desired above all to be an explorer and a geographer. On arrival in Portsmouth in July 1848 he informed his father of his wish to leave the navy, but was persuaded to stay. After a brief period of service in the Mediterranean Markham experienced months of inactivity while based at Spithead and the Cove of Cork, which further diminished his interest in the service. However, early in 1850, he learned that a squadron of four ships was being assembled to undertake a new search for the lost Arctic expedition of Sir John Franklin. Markham used his family&#x27;s influence to secure a place in this venture, and in April 1850, was informed of his appointment to , one of the squadron&#x27;s two principal vessels.

=== First Arctic voyage, 1850–1851 ===

Sir John Franklin had left England in May 1845 with two ships, and , in search of the Northwest Passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The expedition was last seen on 29 July, by whalers in the northern waters of Baffin Bay, moored to an ice floe and waiting for the chance to sail westward.

The hunt for the missing ships began two years later. The relief squadron which Markham joined was commanded by Captain Horatio Austin in . Markham&#x27;s ship &quot;Assistance&quot; was captained by Erasmus Ommanney. Markham, as the youngest member of the expedition and its only midshipman, had a limited role, but carefully noted every detail of expedition life in his journal. The ships sailed on 4 May 1850.
After rounding the southernmost point of Greenland on 28 May, the squadron proceeded northwards until stopped by ice in Melville Bay on 25 June. They were held here until 18 August, when they were finally able to proceed west into Lancaster Sound, the known route taken by Franklin. Here the ships dispersed to search different areas for signs of the vanished expedition. On 23 August, Ommanney sighted a cairn, and discovered packing materials nearby which bore the name of &quot;Goldner&quot;, Franklin&#x27;s canned meat supplier. Together with other odds and ends of abandoned equipment, these fragments were the first traces of Franklin that anyone had found. A few days later, on Beechey Island, the party came across three graves, which proved to be those of members of Franklin&#x27;s crew who had died between January and April 1846.

Searches continued until the ships were laid up for the long Arctic winter. During this enforced rest there were lectures and classes for the crew, and various theatrical diversions in which Markham was able to display his &quot;great histrionic talent&quot;. He did much reading, mainly Arctic history and classical literature, and thought about a possible return visit to Peru, a country which had captivated him during the &quot;Collingwood&quot; voyage. When spring returned, a series of sledging expeditions was launched to search for further signs of the missing crews. Markham played a full part in these activities, which produced no further evidence of Franklin, but led to the mapping of hundreds of miles of previously uncharted coast. The expedition returned to England in early October 1851.

Immediately on his return to England, Markham informed his father of his determination to leave the navy. One of the reasons for his disaffection was the severity of the corporal punishment that was constantly administered for what in his view were trivial offences. He had been in trouble during his &quot;Collingwood&quot; service for attempting to prevent the flogging of a crewman. He had also become disenchanted by the idleness that had occupied long periods of his service. With some regret the elder Markham consented to his son&#x27;s request, and after taking and passing the gunnery part of the examination for the rank of lieutenant, Markham resigned from the service at the end of 1851.

== Peruvian journeys ==

=== First journey, 1852–1853 ===

In the summer of 1852, freed from his naval obligations, Markham made plans for an extended visit to Peru. Supported by a gift from his father of £500 (more than £40,000 at 2008 values) to cover expenses, Markham sailed from Liverpool on 20 August.

Markham travelled by a roundabout route, proceeding first to Halifax, Nova Scotia, then overland to Boston and New York, before taking a steamer to Panama. After crossing the isthmus of Panama, he sailed for Callao, finally arriving there on 16 October. He set out for the Peruvian interior on 7 December 1852, heading across the Andes towards his goal, the ancient Inca city of Cuzco. On the way, Markham paused for nearly a month in the town of Ayacucho, to study the local culture and increase his knowledge of the Quechua people. He then travelled on towards Cuzco, and after crossing a swinging bridge—the Apurimac Bridge—suspended above the raging Apurímac River, he and his party passed through fertile valleys which brought them finally to the city of Cuzco, on 20 March 1853.

Markham remained in the city for several weeks, researching Inca history, describing in his journal the many buildings and ruins that he visited. During the course of an excursion to nearby towns and ruins he reached the area of San Miguel, La Mar, Ayacucho, where he first learned of the properties of the cinchona plant, a source of quinine, cultivated in that vicinity. He finally left Cuzco on 18 May, accompanied by a party of six who, like him, were returning to Lima. Their journey took them southwards, descending the mountains to the city of Arequipa, a former Spanish colonial settlement with a mixture of native and European architecture. The city is overlooked by the conical volcano Mount Misti, which Markham likened to Mount Fuji in Japan. On 23 June, the party reached Lima, where Markham learned of the death of his father. He departed for England, where he arrived on 17 September.

=== Cinchona mission, 1859–1861 ===

The idea of introducing cinchona to India was first made in 1813, by W. Ainslie, and, years later, in 1839, John Forbes Royle suggested that it could be tried in the Nilgiris. The Indian government was spending £7000 a year around 1852 when Royle made a proposal to introduce cinchona to India. By coincidence Markham was a civil servant in the India Office, and in 1859 he made proposals to his employers for a scheme for collecting cinchona trees from the Peruvian and Bolivian Andes, and transplanting them to selected sites in India. Cinchona bark, a source of quinine, was the first known treatment for malaria and other tropical diseases. These plans were approved and Markham was placed in charge of the operation.

Markham and his team, which included the botanist Richard Spruce and his future brother-in-law, the New Zealander Charles Bowen, left England for Peru in December 1859, arriving in Lima late in January 1860. There was danger in their enterprise; Peru and Bolivia were on the verge of war, and Markham&#x27;s party soon experienced the hostility of Peruvian interests anxious to protect their control over the cinchona trade. This limited his sphere of operations, and prevented him from obtaining specimens of the best quality. Later Markham overcame bureaucratic obstruction to obtain the necessary export licences.

Markham returned briefly to England before sailing to India, to select suitable sites for cinchona plantations there and in Burma (now Myanmar) and Ceylon. Although many of the Indian plantations failed to flourish and were soon destroyed by insects, others survived, and were augmented by species obtained by Spruce which were more suited to Indian conditions. Twenty years after the first plantations the annual cinchona bark crop from India was estimated at . For his work in introducing cinchona to India, Markham received a grant of £3,000 (over £200,000 in 2008 terms) from the British Government.

== Civil servant, geographer, traveller ==

=== India Office, 1857–1867 ===
After the death of his father in 1853 Markham needed paid employment, and in December 1853 secured a junior clerkship in the Legacy Duty Office of the Inland Revenue at a salary of £90 per annum (around £6,000 in 2008). He found the work tedious, but after six months was able to transfer to the forerunner of what became, in 1857, the India Office. Here, the work was interesting and rewarding, with sufficient time to allow him to travel and pursue his geographical interests.

In April 1857, Markham married Minna Chichester, who accompanied him on the cinchona mission to Peru and India. Their only child, a daughter Mary Louise (known as May), was born in 1859. As part of his India Office duties Markham investigated and reported to the Indian government on the introduction of Peruvian cotton into the Madras Presidency, on the growth of ipecacuanha in Brazil and the possibilities for cultivating this medicinal plant in India, and on the future of the pearl industry at Tirunelveli in Southern India. He was also involved in an ambitious plan for the transplanting of Brazilian rubber trees, claiming that he would &quot;do for the india-rubber or caoutchouc-yielding trees what had already been done with such happy results for the cinchona trees.&quot; This scheme was not, however, successful.

=== Abyssinia, 1867–1868 ===

In 1867, Markham was selected to accompany Sir Robert Napier&#x27;s military expeditionary force to Abyssinia, as the expedition&#x27;s geographer. This force was despatched by the British government as a response to actions taken by the Abyssinian King Theodore. In 1862, the king had written to the British government requesting help to modernise his nation, and proposing the appointment of an ambassador, which the British had previously suggested. Unwilling to risk its monopoly of cotton in Egypt, the British government did not reply. The king reacted to this slight and other snubs by seizing and imprisoning the British consul and his staff, and ordered the arrest and whipping of a missionary who had insulted the king&#x27;s mother. A belated reply to the king&#x27;s letter resulted in the capture and incarceration of the deputation that brought it. After efforts at conciliation failed, the British decided to settle the matter by sending a military expedition. Because the geography of the country was so little known, it was decided that an experienced traveller with map-making skills should accompany the force, hence Markham&#x27;s appointment.

Napier&#x27;s troops arrived at Annesley Bay in the Red Sea, early in 1868. Markham was attached to the force&#x27;s headquarters staff, with responsibility for general survey work and in particular the selection of the route to Magdala, the king&#x27;s mountain stronghold. Markham also acted as the party&#x27;s naturalist, reporting on the species of wildlife encountered during the march southward from the coast. He accompanied Napier to the walls of Magdala, which was stormed on 10 April 1868. As the king&#x27;s forces charged down the mountain to meet Napier&#x27;s advancing troops Markham recorded: &quot;The Snider–Enfield rifles kept up a fire no Abyssinian troops could stand. They were mown down in lines ... the most heroic struggle could do nothing in the face of such vast inequality of arms.&quot; Markham added that although the king&#x27;s misdeeds had been numerous and his cruelties horrible, he had finally died as a hero.

On the orders of General Napier, Magdala was burnt to the ground, its native and foreign guns destroyed and the accumulated treasures in the fortress looted. The British troops then departed, and Markham was back in England in July 1868. For his services to this campaign Markham was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1871.

=== Second Arctic voyage, 1875–1876 ===

Markham had, through his various activities, come to know many influential people, and during the early 1870s used these connections to make the case for a Royal Naval Arctic expedition. Prime minister Benjamin Disraeli consented, in the &quot;spirit of maritime enterprise that has ever distinguished the English people&quot;. When the expedition was ready to sail, Markham was invited to accompany it as far as Greenland, on , one of the expedition&#x27;s three ships. Markham accepted, and left with the convoy on 29 March 1875. He was gone for three months, remaining with &quot;Alert&quot; as far as Disko Island in Baffin Bay.

He wrote of this journey: &quot;I never had a happier cruise ... a nobler set of fellows never sailed together.&quot; He returned to England on the support vessel , although the homeward voyage was delayed after &quot;Valorous&quot; struck a reef and required substantial repairs. Markham&#x27;s extended absence from his India Office duties, together with his increasing involvement in a range of other interests, caused his superiors to request his resignation. Markham retired from his post in 1877, his 22 years of service entitling him to a pension.

Meanwhile, the main expedition, under the command of Captain George Nares, had proceeded north with the two ships and . On 1 September 1875, they reached 82° 24&#x27;, the highest northern latitude reached by any ship up to that date. In the following spring a sledging party led by Markham&#x27;s cousin, Commander Albert Hastings Markham, achieved a record Farthest North at 83° 20&#x27;.

== Royal Geographical Society ==

=== Honorary secretary, 1863–1888 ===

In November 1854, Markham had been elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. The Society soon became the centre of his geographical interests, and in 1863 he was appointed its honorary secretary, a position he was to hold for 25 years.

In addition to his work in promoting the Nares Arctic expedition, Markham followed the work of other Arctic explorers, organising a reception in 1880, for the Swedish explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld after the latter&#x27;s successful navigation of the North-East Passage, and monitoring the progress of the American expeditions of Adolphus Greely and George W. DeLong. Release from the India Office provided Markham with more time for travel. He made regular trips to Europe, and in 1885, went to America, where he met with President Grover Cleveland in the White House. Throughout his secretaryship Markham was a prolific writer of travel books and biographies, and of many papers presented to the RGS and elsewhere.

He was the author of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (ninth edition) article entitled &quot;Progress of Geographical Discovery&quot;. He also wrote popular histories. Within the RGS Markham was responsible for the revision of the Society&#x27;s standard &quot;Hints to Travellers&quot;, and for relaunching the journal &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society&quot; in a much livelier format. Markham conducted the &quot;Geographical Magazine&quot; from 1872 to 1878, when it became merged in the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society&quot;.

In parallel with his RGS duties Markham served as secretary of the Hakluyt Society until 1886, subsequently becoming that society&#x27;s president. As part of his work for this body, Markham was responsible for many translations from Spanish into English of rare accounts of travel, in particular those relating to Peru. In time scholars would express doubts about the quality of some of these translations, finding them prepared in haste and lacking in rigour. Nevertheless, this work ran to 22 volumes in the society&#x27;s publications. In 1873, Markham had been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in subsequent years received several overseas honours, including the Portuguese Order of Christ and the Order of the Rose of Brazil. He briefly considered, but did not pursue, the idea of a parliamentary career.

Markham maintained his interest in the navy, particularly in the training of its officers. He often visited the merchant officer training vessels, and HMS &quot;Worcester&quot;, and became a member of the latter&#x27;s governing body. In early 1887 he accepted an invitation from his cousin Albert Markham, who now commanded the Royal Navy&#x27;s training squadron, to join the squadron at its station in the West Indies. Markham spent three months aboard the flagship , during which, on 1 March 1887, he had his first encounter with Robert Falcon Scott, who was serving as a midshipman aboard HMS &quot;Rover&quot;. Scott was victorious in a race between cutters, an event that was noted and remembered by Markham.

=== President, 1893–1905 ===

In May 1888, Markham resigned from his position as RGS Secretary, finding himself at odds with the Society&#x27;s new policies which appeared to favour education over exploration. On his retirement he was awarded the Society&#x27;s Founder&#x27;s Medal for what were described at the presentation ceremony as his &quot;incomparable services to the Society&quot;.

The next few years were filled with travel and writing. There were further cruises with the training squadron, and extended visits to the Baltic and the Mediterranean. In 1893, during the course of one of these journeys, Markham was elected &quot;in absentia&quot; president of the society. This unexpected elevation was the result of a dispute within the Society over the question of women members, about which Markham had kept silent. When in July 1893, the issue was put to a special general meeting, the proposal to admit women was narrowly defeated despite an overwhelming postal ballot in favour. In these circumstances the Society&#x27;s President, Sir M. E. Grant Duff, resigned his office. The 22 existing women members were allowed to remain, but no more were admitted until January 1913 when the RGS changed its policy.

Although Markham was not the first choice as a replacement for Grant Duff—other notable figures were approached—he had kept out of the women members controversy and was broadly acceptable to the membership. Shortly after his accession to the presidency, in recognition of his services to geography Markham was promoted Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, and became Sir Clements Markham.

In a letter written many years later, Markham said that on the assumption of the presidency he had felt the need, after the dispute over women, to &quot;restore the Society&#x27;s good name&quot; by the adoption of some great enterprise. He chose Antarctic exploration as the basis for this mission; there had been no significant Antarctic exploration by any country since Sir James Clark Ross&#x27;s expedition fifty years previously. A new impetus was provided through a lecture given to the RGS in 1893, by the oceanographer John Murray, calling for &quot;an expedition to resolve the outstanding questions still posed in the south.&quot; In response to Murray the RGS and the Royal Society formed a joint committee, to campaign for a British Antarctic expedition.

=== National Antarctic Expedition, 1895–1904 ===

Murray&#x27;s call for the resumption of Antarctic exploration was taken up again two years later, when the RGS acted as host to the sixth International Geographical Congress in August 1895. This Congress passed a unanimous resolution:

The joint committee organising the British response to this resolution contained a difference of view. Murray and the Royal Society argued for a largely civilian expedition, directed and staffed by scientists, while Markham and most of the RGS contingent saw a National Antarctic Expedition as a means of reviving naval glories, and wanted the expedition organised accordingly. Markham&#x27;s tenacity finally won the day when in 1900 he secured the appointment of his protégé Robert Falcon Scott, by then a torpedo lieutenant on , as the expedition&#x27;s overall commander. In doing so he thwarted an attempt to place the leadership in the hands of Professor John Walter Gregory of the British Museum.

In the view of Markham&#x27;s critics, this represented the subordination of scientific work to naval adventure, although the &quot;Instructions to the Commander&quot;, drawn up by Markham, give equal priorities to geographical and scientific work. The &quot;science versus adventure&quot; arguments were renewed when, after the return of the expedition, there was criticism over the accuracy and professionalism of some of its scientific results.
Markham faced further problems in securing funding for the expedition. In 1898, after three years&#x27; effort, only a fraction of what was required had been promised. Meanwhile, the Anglo-Norwegian explorer Carsten Borchgrevink had obtained a sum of £40,000 (over £3 million in 2008) from publisher George Newnes, to finance a private Antarctic venture. Markham was furious, believing that funds were being diverted from his own project, and denounced Borchgrevink as &quot;evasive, a liar and a fraud&quot;.

He was equally hostile to William Speirs Bruce, the Scottish explorer who had written to Markham asking to join the National Antarctic Expedition. On receiving no confirmation of an appointment, Bruce obtained finance from the Scottish Coats baronets family and organised his own Scottish National Antarctic Expedition. Markham accused Bruce of &quot;mischievous rivalry&quot;, and of attempting to &quot;cripple the National Expedition ... in order to get up a scheme for yourself&quot;. The Scottish expedition duly sailed, but Markham remained unforgiving towards it, and used his influence to ensure that its participants received no Polar Medals on their return.

A substantial private donation and a government grant finally allowed the National Antarctic Expedition to proceed. A new ship, the , was built, and a mainly naval crew of officers and crewmen appointed, along with a scientific staff which was later described as &quot;underpowered&quot;. &quot;Discovery&quot; sailed on 5 August 1901, after an inspection by King Edward VII, at which Markham was present to introduce Scott and the officers. The ship was gone for just over three years during which time, from a base in the Ross Sea area, significant explorations of this sector of Antarctica were carried out, along with an extensive scientific programme. Although it was reported by the &quot;Times&quot; as &quot;one of the most successful [expeditions] that ever ventured into the Polar regions, north or south,&quot; it was largely ignored by the government of the day. Markham was criticised in official quarters for privately sanctioning a second season in the Antarctic, contrary to the original plan, and then being unable to raise funds for the expedition&#x27;s relief in 1904. The cost for this had to be borne on His Majesty&#x27;s Treasury.

== Later life ==

=== Shackleton and Scott ===

A few months after the &quot;Discovery&quot;″s return, Markham announced his retirement from the RGS presidency. He was 75 years old; according to his biographer he felt that his active geographical life was now over. His 12 years in the presidency was the longest period on record. He remained a member of the RGS Council, a vice-president, and he kept an active interest in Antarctic exploration, particularly in the two British expeditions which set out in the five years following his retirement. These were led respectively by Ernest Shackleton and Scott.

Markham had agreed to Shackleton&#x27;s appointment as third officer on the &quot;Discovery&quot; following a recommendation from the expedition&#x27;s principal private donor. He had given sympathy and support after Shackleton&#x27;s early return from the expedition on grounds of ill health, and had backed the latter&#x27;s unsuccessful application for a Royal Navy commission. Later, after Shackleton had confided his intention to lead an expedition of his own, Markham supplied a generous testimonial, describing Shackleton as &quot;well-fitted to have charge of men in an enterprise involving hardship and peril&quot;, and &quot;admirably fitted for the leader[ship] of a Polar Expedition.&quot;

He expressed strong support for Shackleton&#x27;s 1907–1909 &quot;Nimrod&quot; expedition: &quot;... not only my most cordial wishes for your success will accompany you, but also a well-founded hope.&quot; When news of the expedition&#x27;s achievement of a new Farthest South latitude of 88°23&#x27; reached him, Markham publicly signified his intention to propose Shackleton for the RGS Patron&#x27;s Medal.
However, Markham had second thoughts, and was soon writing to the current RGS president, Leonard Darwin, to express disbelief about Shackleton&#x27;s claimed latitudes, repeating these doubts to Scott. Historians have surmised that Scott was Markham&#x27;s protégé, and that the old man resented polar glory going to someone else. Whatever his reason, Markham adopted a bitterness towards Shackleton which he retained for the rest of his life. He is said to have crossed out all favourable references to Shackleton in his own notes on the &quot;Discovery&quot; expedition, and to have virtually ignored Shackleton&#x27;s achievements in a 1912 address to the British Association. He was equally dismissive in his history of Antarctic exploration, &quot;The Lands of Silence&quot;, published posthumously in 1921.

By contrast, Markham remained on close personal terms with Scott and was godfather to the explorer&#x27;s son, born 14 September 1909 and named Peter Markham Scott in the old man&#x27;s honour. In his tribute to Scott in the preface to &quot;Scott&#x27;s Last Expedition&quot; (1913), Markham describes Scott as &quot;among the most remarkable men of our time&quot;, and talks of the &quot;beauty&quot; of his character. As Scott lay dying &quot;there was no thought for himself, only the earnest thought to give comfort and consolation to others.&quot; In one of the last letters written from his final camp, days from death, Scott wrote: &quot;Tell Sir Clements I thought much of him, and never regretted his putting me in command of the &#x27;Discovery&#x27;.&quot;

=== Retirement ===

After his retirement from the RGS presidency, Markham led an active life as a writer and traveller. He wrote biographies of the English kings Edward IV and Richard III, and of his old naval friend Admiral Sir Leopold McClintock; he also kept up his editing and translating work. He continued to produce papers for the RGS, and remained president of the Hakluyt Society until 1910. Markham continued to travel extensively in Europe, and in 1906 cruised with the Mediterranean squadron, where Scott was acting as flag captain to Rear Admiral George Egerton. When, in 1909, Scott announced his plans for a new Antarctic venture, the &quot;Terra Nova&quot; expedition, Markham assisted with fundraising and served on the expedition&#x27;s organising committee, arranging the deal which brought in Lieutenant &quot;Teddy&quot; Evans as second-in-command, in return for the abandonment of Evans&#x27;s own expedition plans.

Markham was awarded honorary degrees from the University of Cambridge and University of Leeds. In conferring this latter degree, the Chancellor referred to Markham as &quot;a veteran in the service of mankind&quot;, and recalled that he had been &quot;for sixty years the inspiration of English geographical science.&quot; However, Markham did not altogether avoid controversy. In 1912, when Roald Amundsen, conqueror of the South Pole, was invited by RGS president Leonard Darwin to dine with the Society, Markham resigned his council seat in protest.

The news of the death of Scott and his returning polar party reached Markham in February 1913, while he was staying in Estoril. He returned to England, and assisted with the preparation of Scott&#x27;s journals for publication. Scott&#x27;s death was a heavy blow, but Markham continued to lead a busy life of writing and travelling. In 1915, he was present at the service in St Peter&#x27;s Church, Binton, near Stratford-upon-Avon, where a window was dedicated to Scott and his companions; later that year he assisted at the unveiling of the Royal Navy&#x27;s statue of Scott, in Waterloo Place, London. Markham read his last paper for the RGS on 10 June 1915, its title being &quot;The History of the Gradual Development of the Groundwork of Geographical Science&quot;.

== Death and legacy ==

On 29 January 1916, while reading in bed by candlelight, Markham set fire to the bedclothes and was overcome by smoke. He died the following day. His last diary entry, a few days earlier, had recorded a visit from Peter Markham Scott.

The family received tributes from King George V, who acknowledged the debt the country owed to Markham&#x27;s life work of study and research; from the Royal Geographical Society and the other learned bodies with which Markham had been associated; from the Naval Commander-in-Chief at Devonport; and from Fridtjof Nansen, the Norwegian Arctic explorer. Other messages were received from France, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, the United States, and from Arequipa in Peru.

More critical assessments of Markham&#x27;s life and work were to follow. Hugh Robert Mill, Shackleton&#x27;s first biographer and for many years the RGS librarian, referred to the dictatorial manner in which Markham had run the Society. In time, questions would be raised about the accuracy of some of his Hakluyt translations, and about the evidence of haste in the preparation of other publications. On a personal level he had made enemies as well as friends; Frank Debenham, the geologist who served with both Scott and Shackleton, called Markham &quot;a dangerous old man&quot;, while William Speirs Bruce wrote of Markham&#x27;s &quot;malicious opposition to the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition&quot;.

Bruce&#x27;s colleague Robert Rudmose-Brown went further, calling Markham &quot;that old fool and humbug&quot;. These protestations reflected Markham&#x27;s protective attitude towards Scott; according to Bruce, &quot;Scott was Markham&#x27;s protégé, and Markham thought it necessary, in order to uphold Scott, that I should be obliterated&quot;. He added that &quot;Scott and I were always good friends, in spite of Markham.&quot; Markham&#x27;s writings on naval history have been criticised by modern scholars due to his nationalistic exaggeration of English sailors&#x27; achievements in the Age of Discoveries.

It has been suggested that Markham&#x27;s prejudices about polar travel, particularly his belief in the &quot;nobility&quot; of manhauling, had been passed to Scott, to the detriment of all future British expeditions. Mill&#x27;s measured opinion, that Markham was &quot;an enthusiast rather than a scholar&quot;, has been asserted as a fair summary of his strengths and weaknesses, and as the basis for his influence on the discipline of geography in the late-19th and early-20th centuries. He is commemorated by Mount Markham, , in the Transantarctic range, discovered and named by Scott on his southern march during the &quot;Discovery&quot; expedition in 1902.

The Markham River in Papua New Guinea was named after him; Carsten Borchgrevink discovered and named Markham Island in the Ross Sea during his 1900 expedition, a gesture that was not, however, acknowledged by Markham. The name lives on in Lima, Peru, through Markham College, a private co-educational school. Minna Bluff, a promontory extending into the Ross Ice Shelf, was named by Scott for Lady Markham. The plant genus &quot;Markhamia&quot; was named after Markham by the German botanist Berthold Carl Seemann in 1863.

Markham&#x27;s estate was valued for probate purposes at £7,740 (2008 equivalent £376,000). He was survived by his wife Minna, to whom Albert Hastings Markham&#x27;s 1917 biography of Sir Clements is dedicated. Markham&#x27;s only child, May, avoided public life and devoted herself to church work in the East End of London. According to the family&#x27;s entry in &quot;Burke&#x27;s Landed Gentry&quot; she died in 1926.

== Portrayal in media ==
Markham was portrayed by the character actor Geoffrey Chater in the BBC TV miniseries &quot;Shackleton&quot; in 1983, and by Alexander Knox in the Central Television serial &quot;The Last Place on Earth&quot; in 1985.

== Writings ==
Markham was a prolific writer and diarist; his first published work, an account of his voyage with HMS &quot;Assistance&quot; in search of Franklin, had appeared in 1853. After his retirement from the India office in 1877, writing became his chief source of income. In addition to papers and reports for the Royal Geographical Society and other learned bodies, Markham wrote histories, biographies and travel accounts, many as full-length books. He also translated many works from Spanish to English, and compiled a grammar and dictionary for the Quichua language of Peru.

<text>Conrad W. Baars, M.D., (January 2, 1919 – October 18, 1981) was a Catholic psychiatrist. His most prominent work is with Dr. Anna Terruwe in the study of the human emotional life. Their general idea is that many emotional disturbances in a human stem from a lack of experiencing unconditional love during his or her life. He and Terruwe are known for their model of Emotional Deprivation Disorder and a different approach to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.

Dr. Baars and Dr. Terruwe treated many priests and religious in their practices and presented important information to the bishops of the Catholic Church. 
&quot;The Role of the Church in the Causation, Treatment and Prevention of the Crisis in the Priesthood&quot;, was copyrighted and published by Franciscan Herald Press (Chicago, Illinois) in 1972 as part of their &quot;Synthesis Series&quot; as &#x27;How to treat and prevent The Crisis in the Priesthood&#x27;. Dr. Baars wrote numerous other articles and monographs.

==Biography==
Conrad (Koert) W. Baars was born in Rotterdam, Netherlands on January 2, 1919. He was the second of six children.

He began his studies in Chemical Engineering at the University of Amsterdam. Later, he decided to study medicine. During World War II, the Nazis bombed Rotterdam. The Dutch could no longer be neutral in the war; Baars was forced to flee the country. He joined the French underground resistance. During an organized escape to Spain over the Pyrenees mountains, his group got lost in a sudden snowstorm. Later, they were captured by the Nazis.

After being questioned by the Gestapo, Baars was sent to a concentration camp north of Paris. In the winter of 1943, he was transferred to the Buchenwald Concentration Camp. Because he was a medical student, he was put in charge of nursing the sick. Despite having better living conditions because of his position, he lost several teeth and suffered from a weakened heart due to malnutrition. He was freed on April 11, 1945; the day the American army arrived.

In 1946, Baars came to the United States on a student visa. He was an intern at a hospital in Mount Vernon, New York. Later, he moved to Chicago, Illinois, to complete a residency program. There, he met his wife, Mary Jean Kennedy. Because of their marriage, Conrad Baars was able to apply for citizenship. His citizenship was granted on January 15, 1951.

After his marriage, Baars went into a residency program for psychiatry at the Minneapolis General Hospital in Minnesota. He grew disillusioned with the current practice of psychotherapy (psychoanalysis) and considered leaving the profession. But, he encountered the works of Anna Terruwe. He was impressed by her practice of integrating psychology with spirituality. Eventually, he and Terruwe collaborated. They developed a model of practicing psychiatry based on the mediæval theologian Thomas Aquinas.

Conrad Baars held a private practice in San Antonio, Texas. He also wrote books on his ideas and lectured around the country in hopes of reforming the practice of psychiatry. He died on October 18, 1981. His daughter Suzanne Baars carries on his work.

<text>Berastagi (), is a town and district of Karo Regency situated on a crossroads on the main route linking the Karo highlands of Northern Sumatra to the coastal city of Medan. Berastagi town is located around south of Medan and about above sea level. The village rose to significance when Dutch settlers in Sumatra opened a boarding school there in the 1920s.

==Climate==
Located in the Barisan Mountains area, the mean annual temperature of the district is . During the day the temperature rises over but at night to early morning it could drop to as low as , it could also reach during the rainy season. The weather can be fair and sunny during the day but may become foggy around dusk to night.

==Administration==
===Villages===

The small towns of Barusjahe and Tigapanah are located to the east of Berastagi, while Simpang Empat, is located to the west, Deli Serdang Regency to the north, and Kabanjahe to the south of Berastagi.

There are 9 villages, called &quot;desa&quot;, in the Berastagi district. It is the smallest (), but most densely populated (1,582 persons/square kilometre in 2020) district of Karo Regency. The elevation is .

&quot;Desa&quot;s with population (2007):
*Gurusinga, 3,900
*Raya, 4,358
*Rumah Berastagi, 6,611
*Tambak Lau Mulgap I, 2,677
*Tambak Lau Mulgap II, 3,147
*Gundaling I, 8,388
*Gundaling II, 5130
*Sempajaya, 7,115
*Doulu, 2,011

== Demographics ==
The population of Berastagi district was 44,765 as of 2010 but increased to 48,244 in 2020. It is the second-most populous district in Karo Regency, after Kabanjahe.
Berastagi District has significantly more Muslims than most parts of Karo Regency, with 17,801 Muslims, 5,042 Catholics, 29,195 Protestants, 1,245 Hindus or Buddhists, and 54 others, Sempajaya has the highest percentage of Muslims among the &quot;desas&quot;, being 67% Muslim. There are 28 mosques, 29 churches, and 2 Buddhist temples in the district.

The town is ethnically diverse with many migrants from adjacent regions. Besides Karo Batak, who form the majority of the population, there is a substantial amount of Toba Batak, Javanese, and Chinese living in Berastagi.

97% of primary-age children attend school, but only 77% of high-school-age children. There are 26 primary schools, 8 intermediate schools, and 9 high schools within the district.

== Economy ==
===Agriculture===
Agriculture is much less important in Berastagi (and Kabanjahe) than in the rest of Karo Regency. Crops include scallions, common beans, peas, potatoes, cauliflower, cabbage, radish, Chinese cabbage, tomatoes, carrots, and chayote. Rice is not a significant crop. Fruit grown include oranges, passionfruit, kaki, and avocados. There is significantly more industry in the Berastagi district than in the rest of Karo Regency, aided by Berastagi&#x27;s 100% paved roads.

===Tourism===
Due to its close distance from Medan, Berastagi was developed initially as an upper-class hill station for the European population in the plantation district around Medan. Today, Berastagi attracts a large amount of local as well as national and international tourists. Many investors developed several tourism sites, hotels, and lodges to attract visitors from Medan and elsewhere. Places of interest include

<doc id="581931" wikidata="Q638774" url="?curid=581931" title="Cholecystectomy">
<text>Cholecystectomy is the surgical removal of the gallbladder. Cholecystectomy is a common treatment of symptomatic gallstones and other gallbladder conditions. In 2011, cholecystectomy was the eighth most common operating room procedure performed in hospitals in the United States. Cholecystectomy can be performed either laparoscopically, or via an open surgical technique.

The surgery is usually successful in relieving symptoms, but up to 10 percent of people may continue to experience similar symptoms after cholecystectomy, a condition called postcholecystectomy syndrome. Complications of cholecystectomy include bile duct injury, wound infection, bleeding, vasculobiliary injury, retained gallstones, liver abscess formation and stenosis (narrowing) of the bile duct.
==Medical use==

Pain and complications caused by gallstones are the most common reasons for removal of the gallbladder. The gallbladder can also be removed in order to treat biliary dyskinesia or gallbladder cancer.

Gallstones are very common but 50–80% of people with gallstones are asymptomatic and do not need surgery; their stones are noticed incidentally on imaging tests of the abdomen (such as ultrasound or CT) done for some other reason. The traditional risk factors for gallstones are the four “F&#x27;s: female, fat, forty, and fertile. Of the more than 20 million people in the US with gallstones, only about 30% will eventually require cholecystectomy to relieve symptoms (pain) or treat complications.

===Biliary colic===
Biliary colic, or pain caused by gallstones, occurs when a gallstone temporarily blocks the bile duct that drains the gallbladder. Typically, pain from biliary colic is felt in the right upper part of the abdomen, is moderate to severe, and goes away on its own after a few hours when the stone dislodges. Biliary colic usually occurs after meals when the gallbladder contracts to push bile out into the digestive tract. After a first attack of biliary colic, more than 90% of people will have a repeat attack in the next 10 years. Repeated attacks of biliary colic are the most common reason for removing the gallbladder, and lead to about 300,000 cholecystectomies in the US each year.

=== Acute cholecystitis ===
Cholecystitis, or inflammation of the gallbladder caused by interruption in the normal flow of bile, is another reason for cholecystectomy. It is the most common complication of gallstones; 90–95% of acute cholecystitis is caused by gallstones blocking drainage of the gallbladder. If the blockage is incomplete and the stone passes quickly, the person experiences biliary colic. If the gallbladder is completely blocked and remains so for a prolonged period, the person develops acute cholecystitis.

Pain in cholecystitis is similar to that of biliary colic, but lasts longer than six hours and occurs together with signs of infection such as fever, chills, or an elevated white blood cell count. People with cholecystitis will also usually have a positive Murphy sign on physical exam – meaning that when a doctor asks the patient to take a deep breath and then pushes down on the upper right side of their abdomen, the patient stops their inhalation due to pain from the pressure on their inflamed gallbladder.

Five to ten percent of acute cholecystitis occurs in people without gallstones, and for this reason, is called &quot;acalculous&quot; cholecystitis. It usually develops in people who have abnormal bile drainage secondary to a serious illness, such as people with multi-organ failure, serious trauma, recent major surgery, or following a long stay in the intensive care unit.

People with repeat episodes of acute cholecystitis can develop chronic cholecystitis from changes in the normal anatomy of the gallbladder. This can also be an indication for cholecystectomy if the person has ongoing pain.

=== Cholangitis and gallstone pancreatitis ===
Cholangitis and gallstone pancreatitis are rarer and more serious complications from gallstone disease. Both can occur if gallstones leave the gallbladder, pass through the cystic duct, and get stuck in the common bile duct. The common bile duct drains the liver and pancreas, and a blockage there can lead to inflammation and infection in both the pancreas and biliary system. While cholecystectomy is not usually the immediate treatment choice for either of these conditions, it is often recommended to prevent repeat episodes from additional gallstones getting stuck.

===Gallbladder cancer===
Gallbladder cancer (also called carcinoma of the gallbladder) is a rare indication for cholecystectomy. In cases where cancer is suspected, the open technique for cholecystectomy is usually performed.

===Liver transplantation===
In living donor liver transplantation between adults, a cholecystectomy is performed in the donor because the gallbladder interferes with removal of the right (lateral) lobe of the liver and to prevent the formation of gallstones in the recipient. The gallbladder is not removed in pediatric transplantations as the left lobe of the liver is used instead.

==Contraindications==
There are no specific contraindications for cholecystectomy, and in general it is considered a low-risk surgery. However, anyone who cannot tolerate surgery under general anesthesia should not undergo cholecystectomy. People can be split into high and low risk groups using a tool such as the ASA physical status classification system. In this system, people who are ASA categories III, IV, and V are considered high risk for cholecystectomy. Typically this includes very elderly people and people with co-existing illness, such as end-stage liver disease with portal hypertension and whose blood does not clot properly. Alternatives to surgery are briefly mentioned below.

==Risks==
All surgery carries risk of serious complications including damage to nearby structures, bleeding, infection, or even death. The operative death rate in cholecystectomy is about 0.1% in people under age 50 and about 0.5% in people over age 50. The greatest risk of death comes from co-existing illness like cardiac or pulmonary disease.

=== Biliary injury ===
A serious complication of cholecystectomy is biliary injury, or damage to the bile ducts. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has a higher risk of bile duct injury than the open approach, with injury to bile ducts occurring in 0.3% to 0.5% of laparoscopic cases and 0.1% to 0.2% of open cases. In laparoscopic cholecystectomy, approximately 25–30% of biliary injuries are identified during the operation; the rest become apparent in the early post-operative period.

Damage to the bile ducts is very serious because it causes leakage of bile into the abdomen. Signs and symptoms of a bile leak include abdominal pain, tenderness, fever and signs of sepsis several days following surgery, or through laboratory studies as rising total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Complications from a bile leak can follow a person for years and can lead to death. Bile leak should always be considered in any patient who is not recovering as expected after cholecystectomy. Most bile injuries require repair by a surgeon with special training in biliary reconstruction. If biliary injuries are properly treated and repaired, more than 90% of patients can have a long-term successful recovery.

Injury of the bile ducts can be prevented and treated by routinely using X-ray investigation of the bile ducts (intraoperative cholangiography (IOC)). This method was assessed by the Swedish SBU and routine use deemed to decrease risk of injury and morbidity following unaddressed injury while only increasing cancer rates due to radiation exposure by a lesser fraction.

=== Other complications ===
A review of safety data in laparoscopic cholecystectomy found the following complications to be most common:

The same study found the prevalence of bowel injury, sepsis, pancreatitis, and deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism to be around 0.15% each.

Leakage from the stump of the cystic duct is a complication that is more common with the laparoscopic approach than the open approach but is still rare, occurring in less than 1% of procedures; it is treated by drainage followed by insertion of a bile duct stent.

Another complication singular to the laparoscopic procedure is the phenomenon of the &quot;spilled gallstone&quot; which complicates 0.08–0.3% of cases. Here a stone escapes the resected gallbladder into the abdomen where it can become a focus for infection if it is not identified and removed. Some reports exist of spilled stones lying unnoticed for up to 20 years before eventually causing an abscess to form.

=== Conversion to open cholecystectomy ===
Experts agree that many biliary injuries in laparoscopic cases are caused by difficulties seeing and identifying the anatomy clearly. If the surgeon has problems identifying anatomical structures, they might need to convert from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy.

Peroperative Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreaticography (ERCP)/ Laparo-endoscopic rendezvous (LERV) technique

CBDS are found in 10–15% of patients during cholecystectomy when intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) is routinely performed.

There are several strategies to manage choledocholithiasis but the optimal method as well as the timing of treatment is still under debate.

In recent years the LERV technique, in which access to the common bile duct by ERCP is facilitated by an antegrade guidewire, which is intraoperatively introduced during fluoroscopy and is advanced through the cystic duct to the duodenum, has been established as an alternative to treat common bile duct stones discovered during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This technique was first described in 1993 by Deslandres et al.
and has, in several studies, been shown to have a high rate of CBD stones clearance and a reduced number of complications, particularly post-ERCP pancreatitis, in comparison with conventional ERCP.

This is probably due to the facilitated access to the common bile duct with a lesser degree of manipulation and trauma to the papilla Vateri. In a study by Swahn et al. the rendezvous method was shown to reduce the risk of PEP from 3.6 to 2.2% compared with conventional biliary cannulation.
The success rate of passing the transcystic guidewire into the duodenum has been reported to be over 80%.

==Procedure==


===Pre-operative preparation===
Before surgery, a complete blood count and liver function tests are usually obtained. Prophylactic treatment is given to prevent deep vein thrombosis. Use of prophylactic antibiotics is controversial; however, a dose may be given prior to surgery to prevent infection in certain people at high risk. Gas may be removed from the stomach with an OG or NG tube. A Foley catheter may be used to empty the patient&#x27;s bladder.

===Laparoscopic cholecystectomy===
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy uses several (usually 4) small incisions in the abdomen to allow the insertion of operating ports, small cylindrical tubes approximately 5 to 10 mm in diameter, through which surgical instruments are placed into the abdominal cavity. The laparoscope, an instrument with a video camera and light source at the end, illuminates the abdominal cavity and sends a magnified image from inside the abdomen to a video screen, giving the surgeon a clear view of the organs and tissues. The cystic duct and cystic artery are identified and dissected, then ligated with clips and cut in order to remove the gallbladder. The gallbladder is then removed through one of the ports.

As of 2008, 90% of cholecystectomies in the United States were done laparoscopically. Laparoscopic surgery is thought to have fewer complications, shorter hospital stay, and quicker recovery than open cholecystectomy.

==== Single incision ====
Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) or laparoendoscopic single site surgery (LESS) is a technique in which a single incision is made through the navel, instead of the 3-4 four small different incisions used in standard laparoscopy. There appears to be a cosmetic benefit over conventional four-hole laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and no advantage in postoperative pain and hospital stay compared with standard laparoscopic procedures. There is no scientific consensus regarding risk for bile duct injury with SILS versus traditional laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

====Natural orifice transluminal====
Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is an experimental technique where the laparoscope is inserted through natural orifices and internal incisions, rather than skin incisions, to access to the abdominal cavity. This offers the potential to eliminate visible scars. Since 2007, cholecystectomy by NOTES has been performed anecdotally via transgastric and transvaginal routes. As of 2009 the risk of gastrointestinal leak, difficulty visualizing the abdominal cavity and other technical limitations limited further adoption of NOTES for cholecystectomy.

===Open cholecystectomy===
In open cholecystectomy, a surgical incision of around 8 to 12 cm is made below the edge of the right rib cage and the gallbladder is removed through this large opening, typically using electrocautery. Open cholecystectomy is often done if difficulties arise during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, for example, the patient has unusual anatomy, the surgeon cannot see well enough through the camera, or the patient is found to have cancer. It can also be done if the patient has severe cholecystitis, emphysematous gallbladder, fistulization of gallbladder and gallstone ileus, cholangitis, cirrhosis or portal hypertension, and blood dyscrasias.

===Biopsy===
After removal, the gallbladder should be sent for pathological examination to confirm the diagnosis and look for any incidental cancer. Incidental cancer of the gallbladder is found in approximately 1% of cholecystectomies. If cancer is present in the gallbladder, it is usually necessary to re-operate to remove parts of the liver and lymph nodes and test them for additional cancer.

===Post-operative management===
After surgery, most patients are admitted to the hospital for routine monitoring. For uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomies, people may be discharged on the day of surgery after adequate control of pain and nausea. Patients who were high-risk, those who required emergency surgery, and/or those undergoing open cholecystectomy usually need to stay in the hospital several days after surgery.

=== Subtotal Cholecystectomy ===
Intra-operative decisions, with patient safety at the forefront, sometimes call for, what is known in surgical education as, &quot;bail-out&quot; procedures. This is usually due to the surgical team making a clinical decision in the operating room to not proceed with the intended cholecystectomy, due to issues such as adherent bowel or colon, inability to properly identify anatomical planes from previously formed scar-tissue. If there is an inability to safely isolate the structures needed to isolate for cholecystectomy (the cystic duct and the cystic artery) for whatever reason (many times patients have part of the small bowel or colon stuck to the gallbladder, which make it dangerous to pull off without making an accidental hole in the small bowel), the surgical team may elect to do a subtotal cholecystectomy; either a fenestrated or reconstituting type. Essentially, only part of the gallbladder is removed and a drain is left in place for several days. Complications include continued output from drain, which may result in the need for ERCP stent placement to stop drainage.

==Long-term prognosis==
In 95% of people undergoing cholecystectomy as treatment for simple biliary colic, removing the gallbladder completely resolves their symptoms.

Up to 10% of people who undergo cholecystectomy develop a condition called postcholecystectomy syndrome. Symptoms are typically similar to the pain and discomfort of biliary colic with persistent pain in the upper right abdomen and commonly include gastrointestinal distress (dyspepsia).

Some people following cholecystectomy may develop diarrhea. The cause is unclear, but is presumed to be due to disturbances in the biliary system that speed up enterohepatic recycling of bile salts. The terminal ileum, the portion of the intestine where these salts are normally reabsorbed, becomes overwhelmed, does not absorb everything, and the person develops diarrhea. Most cases resolve within weeks or a few months, though in rare cases the condition can last for years. It can be controlled with medication such as cholestyramine.

A systematic review and meta analysis of eighteen studies on the association between cholecystectomy and the risk of development of colorectal cancer concluded that cholecystecomy has no effect on the risk of colorectal cancer overall, but does have a harmful effect on the risk of right-sided colon cancer. A nationwide cohort study in Korea reported a significantly increased total cancer risk, including increased risk of several different specific types of cancer, after cholecystectomy.

==Considerations==

=== Pregnancy ===
It is generally safe for pregnant women to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy during any trimester of pregnancy. Early elective surgery is recommended for women with symptomatic gallstones to decrease the risk of spontaneous abortion and pre-term delivery. Without cholecystectomy, more than half of such women will have recurrent symptoms during their pregnancy, and nearly one in four will develop a complication, such as acute cholecystitis, that requires urgent surgery. Acute cholecystitis is the second most common cause of acute abdomen in pregnant women after appendectomy.

=== Porcelain gallbladder ===
Porcelain gallbladder (PGB), a condition where the gallbladder wall shows calcification on imaging tests, was previously considered a reason to remove the gallbladder because it was thought that people with this condition had a high risk of developing gallbladder cancer. However, recent studies have shown that there is no strong association between gallbladder cancer and porcelain gallbladder, and that PGB alone is not a strong enough indication for a prophylactic cholecystectomy.

==Alternatives to surgery==
There are several alternatives to cholecystectomy for people who do not want surgery, or in whom the benefits of surgery would not outweigh the risks.

=== Conservative management ===
Conservative management for biliary colic involves a &quot;watch and wait&quot; approach—treating symptoms as-needed with oral medications. Experts agree that this is the preferred treatment for people with gallstones but no symptoms. Conservative management may also be appropriate for people with mild biliary colic, as the pain from colic can be managed with pain medications like NSAIDs (ex: ketorolac) or opioids.

Conservative management for acute cholecystitis involves treating the infection without surgery. It is usually only considered in patients at very high risk for surgery or other interventions listed below. It consists of treatment with intravenous antibiotics and fluids.

=== ERCP ===
ERCP, short for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, is an endoscopic procedure that can remove gallstones or prevent blockages by widening parts of the bile duct where gallstones frequently get stuck. ERCP is often used to retrieve stones stuck in the common bile duct in patients with gallstone pancreatitis or cholangitis. In this procedure, an endoscope, or small, long thin tube with a camera on the end, is passed through the mouth and down the esophagus. The doctor advances the camera through the stomach and into the first part of the small intestine to reach the opening of the bile duct. The doctor can inject a special, radiopaque dye through the endoscope into the bile duct to see stones or other blockages on x-ray. ERCP does not require general anaesthesia and can be done outside of the operating room. While ERCP can be used to remove a specific stone that is causing a blockage to allow drainage, it cannot remove all stones in the gallbladder. Thus, it is not considered a definitive treatment and people with recurrent complications from stones will still likely need a cholecystectomy.

=== Cholecystostomy ===
Cholecystostomy is the drainage of the gallbladder via insertion of a small tube through the abdominal wall. This is usually done using guidance from imaging scans to find the right place to insert the tube. Cholecystostomy can be used for people who need immediate drainage of the gallbladder but have a high risk of complications from surgery under general anaesthesia, such as elderly people and those with co-existing illnesses. Draining pus and infected material through the tube reduces inflammation in and around the gallbladder. It can be a lifesaving procedure, without requiring that the person undergo emergency surgery.

The procedure does come with significant risks and complications—in one retrospective study of patients who received percutaneous cholecystostomy for acute cholecystitis, 44% developed choledocholithiasis (one or more stones stuck in the common bile duct), 27% had tube dislodgment, and 23% developed postoperative abscess.

For some people, drainage with cholecystostomy is enough and they do not need to have the gallbladder removed later. For others, percutaneous cholecystostomy allows them to improve enough in the short term that they can get surgery at a later time. There is no clear evidence one way or another to indicate that surgical removal after cholecystostomy is best for high-risk surgical patients with acute cholecystitis.

==Frequency of use==
About 600,000 people receive a cholecystectomy in the United States each year.

In a study of Medicaid-covered and uninsured U.S. hospital stays in 2012, cholecystectomy was the most common operating room procedure.

Gallstones affect approximately 10-15% of the global adult population, with the incidence rising with age and more commonly affecting women. As a result, cholecystectomy is one of the most common abdominal surgeries performed worldwide.

== History ==

Carl Langenbuch performed the first successful cholecystectomy at the Lazarus hospital in Berlin on July 15, 1882. Before this, surgical therapy for symptomatic gallstones was limited to cholecystostomy, or gallstone removal. Langenbuch&#x27;s rationale for developing the new technique stemmed from 17th century studies in dogs that demonstrated the gallbladder to be nonessential and medical opinion among his colleagues that gallstones formed in the gallbladder. Although the technique was initially controversial, cholecystectomy became established as a lower mortality procedure than cholecystostomy by the 20th century.

=== Laparoscopic technique ===
Erich Mühe performed the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy on September 12, 1985, in Böblingen, Germany. Mühe was inspired to develop a technique for laparoscopic cholecystectomy by the first laparoscopic appendectomy, performed by gynecologist Kurt Semm in 1980. He subsequently designed an optical laparoscope with a working channel large enough to fit a distended gallbladder. Mühe presented his technique to the Congress of the German Surgical Society in 1986, claiming reduced postoperative pain and shorter hospitalization. His work was met with strong resistance by the German surgical establishment and he had difficulty communicating it in English. It was consequently ignored. Mühe&#x27;s work was further disparaged in 1987, when he was charged with manslaughter for a postoperative patient death that was mistakenly attributed to his innovative technique. He was exonerated in 1990 after further investigation. His pioneering work was eventually recognized by the German Surgical Society Congress in 1992.

Philippe Mouret performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy on March 17, 1987, in Lyon, France. His technique was rapidly adopted and improved in France. It was subsequently introduced to the rest of the world over the next three years. Driven by popularity among patients, the laparoscopic technique became preferred over open surgery and noninvasive treatments for gallstones.

By 2013, laparoscopic cholecystectomy had replaced open cholecystectomy as the first-choice of treatment for people with uncomplicated gallstones and acute cholecystitis.

By 2014 laparoscopic cholecystectomy had become the gold standard for the treatment of symptomatic gallstones.

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be a challenging procedure and surgeons must be trained with advanced laparoscopic skills to complete the operation with safety and effectiveness.

<doc id="581933" wikidata="Q1326154" url="?curid=581933" title="First baseman">
<text>A first baseman, abbreviated 1B, is the player on a baseball or softball team who fields the area nearest first base, the first of four bases a baserunner must touch in succession to score a run. The first baseman is responsible for the majority of plays made at that base. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the first baseman is assigned the number 3.

Also called first sacker or cornerman, the first baseman is ideally a tall player who throws left-handed and possesses good flexibility and quick reflexes. Flexibility is needed because the first baseman receives throws from the other infielders, the catcher and the pitcher after they have fielded ground balls. In order for the runner to be called out, the first baseman must be able to &quot;stretch&quot; towards the throw and catch it before the runner reaches first base. First base is often referred to as &quot;the other hot corner&quot;—the &quot;hot corner&quot; being third base—and therefore, like the third baseman, he must have quick reflexes to field the hardest hit balls down the foul line, mainly by left-handed pull hitters and right-handed hitters hitting to the opposite field. 

== Fielding ==

Good defensive first basemen, according to baseball writer and historian Bill James, are capable of playing off first base so that they can field ground balls hit to the fair side of first base. The first baseman then relies upon the pitcher to cover first base to receive the ball to complete the out. Indications of a good defensive first baseman include a large number of assists and a low number of throwing errors by other infielders.

=== In general ===
The nature of play at first base often requires first basemen to stay close to the bag to hold runners or to reach the bag before the batter. First basemen are not typically expected to have the range required of a third baseman, shortstop, second baseman or an outfielder. As a result, first base is not usually perceived to be as physically demanding as other positions. However, it can also be a very hard position to play; a large amount of concentration and timing is required. Though many play at first base their entire career, occasionally veteran players move to first base to extend their careers or to accommodate other recently acquired players. Facing a possible trade or a considerable reduction in playing time, a player may opt to move to first base instead. Catchers and corner outfielders sometimes move to first base due to deteriorating health or if their fielding abilities at their original position are detrimental to the team.

=== Position ===
Unlike the pitcher and catcher, who must start every play in a designated area (the pitcher must be on the pitcher&#x27;s mound, with one foot in contact with the pitcher&#x27;s rubber, and the catcher must be behind home plate in the catcher&#x27;s box) the first baseman and the other fielders can vary their positioning in response to what they anticipate will be the actions of the batter and runner(s) once play begins.

When first base is not occupied by a baserunner, the first baseman usually stands behind first base and off the foul line. The distance he plays from the base and foul line is dependent on the current hitter and any runners on base. The exact position may also depend on the first baseman&#x27;s experience, preference, and fielding ability. For a known right-handed pull hitter, the first baseman might position himself further towards the second baseman&#x27;s normal fielding position. For a known left-handed pull hitter, the first baseman will position himself closer to the foul line to stop a ball hit down the line.

To protect against a bunt on the first base side of the infield, the first baseman will position himself in front of the base and move towards the hitter as the pitch is thrown. As soon as the pitcher commits to throwing towards home plate, the first baseman will charge towards the hitter to field the bunt. During these plays, it is the responsibility of the second baseman to cover first base.

With a base runner present at first base, the first baseman stands with their right foot touching the base to prepare for a pickoff attempt. Once the pitcher commits to throwing towards home plate, the first baseman comes off the bag in front of the runner and gets in a fielding position. If the bases are loaded, or if the runner on first base is not a base stealing threat, the first baseman will position himself behind the runner and appropriate for the current batter.

When waiting for a throw from another player, the first baseman stands with their off-glove foot touching the base, then stretches toward the throw. This stretch decreases the amount of time it takes the throw to get to first and encourages the umpire to call close plays in favor of the fielding team. Veteran first basemen are known to pull off the bag early on close plays to convince the umpire that the ball reached their glove before the runner reached first base. The first baseman also has the responsibility of cutting off throws from any of the three outfield positions on their way to home plate. Though highly situational, the first baseman usually only receives throws from the center or right fielder.

=== Double play ===
The first baseman is usually at the end of a double play, though he can be at the beginning and end of a double play. Unusual double plays involving the first baseman include the 3–6–3, 3–4–3, 3–2–3, or a 3–6–1 double play. In a 3–6–3 or 3–4–3 double play, the first baseman fields the ball, throws to second, where the shortstop (6) or second baseman (4) catches the ball to make the first out and then throws back to the first baseman who reaches first base in time to tag first base before the batter reaches first base. For a 3–2–3 double play, the bases must be loaded for the force-out at home plate or the catcher must tag the runner coming from third base out. With a force-out at home plate, the first baseman fields the ball, throws to the catcher, the catcher steps on home plate for the first out, then he throws it back to the first baseman to complete the double play. The 3–2–3 double play with a tag out at home plate is usually not attempted because of the possibility of the catcher not being able to tag the runner and/or block the plate. If the runner at third base is known as a good or fast baserunner, the first basemen will make considerable effort to make sure the third base runner does not advance to home plate for a run by &quot;looking&quot; him back to third base. The primary goal of the first baseman in this instance is to ensure the runner does not advance and that the team records at least one out, especially in a close game. A 3–6–1 double play is almost like a 3–6–3 or a 3–4–3 double play, but the first baseman is usually playing deep in the infield. Here, the first baseman throws the ball to the shortstop covering second, but the pitcher then has the responsibility of covering first base to receive the throw from the shortstop.

A first baseman can theoretically also make an unassisted double play. There are two ways to achieve this. The first is by catching a line drive and returning to first base to tag the base before a baserunner can return. This is rare because the first baseman is usually slower than most baserunners who generally return to their bases on line drives near any fielder. The second is by getting an infield hit to the right when there is a runner on first, tagging the runner and returning to the first base in time to get the man running towards him.

== Left-handed throwing first basemen ==

A left-handed throwing non-pitcher is often converted to or begins their career playing at first base. A left-handed throwing baseball player who is not particularly fast or has a weak arm (and therefore not well suited for playing in the outfield) will usually be relegated to playing first base. This is because the only other positions available to the player (catcher, third base, shortstop or second base) are overwhelmingly held by right-handed throwing players, who can make quicker throws to first base (or, in the case of catchers, third base).

The same advantages of being a right-handed throwing catcher, third basemen, shortstop or second basemen apply to the left-handed first baseman. These advantages surface in plays where the player is required to throw to another infielder after fielding a batted ball. In these instances, a right-hander will be required to turn more towards their target before throwing whereas a left-hander will usually already be positioned to make a throw. However, compared to the advantage for the right-handed throwing third baseman, shortstop, or second baseman, these advantages for the left-handed first baseman are minor because many balls hit to the first baseman are to their right, so that a right-handed first baseman fielding them backhanded does not need to turn after fielding a batted ball to throw it. In addition, a majority of plays only require the first baseman to receive a throw, not to field or throw himself. This is attributed to the overall majority of baseball players batting right-handed, and therefore, a majority of batted balls are hit to the left side of the infield and fielded by the third baseman or shortstop. Left-handed first basemen are also advantageous in attempting to pick off baserunners at first, as the left-hander can catch and tag in one motion, often doing both at the same time, while right-handed first baseman must sweep their glove across their body, costing them a crucial fraction of a second in applying the tag.

== First-baseman&#x27;s mitt ==

The first baseman&#x27;s mitt is similar to a catcher&#x27;s mitt in that it has extra padding and has no individual fingers. (In shape, it is closer to a mitten than a glove.) It is much larger than the other infielders&#x27; gloves; it is wide, very deep, and it is crescent-shaped at its edges, allowing the first-baseman to use the mitt like a scoop in catching errant throws from other players on the infield.

Since many throws to first base are made in great haste, the first baseman must be prepared to catch balls that are either high or low, as well as balls thrown quite a distance to either side, all while maintaining contact with the base (using one foot or the other). This requires a fair amount of agility and physical coordination. Among the most difficult plays a first baseman is normally required to make are the &quot;short hop&quot; and the &quot;tag play&quot;, both of which are far easier to execute when the fielder is wearing the first-baseman&#x27;s mitt rather than another type of glove.

===Short hop===
Every ground ball hit to an infielder becomes a race between the batter-runner and the team in the field; the fielder must catch the batted ball and throw it to first before the batter can reach the base. Consequently, part of the first baseman&#x27;s job is to step toward the incoming ball and stretch their body so that their catching hand makes contact with it as soon as physically possible. Compared to catching the ball while standing passively on the base, this shaves a fraction of a second from the time the runner has to reach base. When it is thrown too low and bounces before reaching the first baseman, catching the ball is difficult, especially while he is in a &quot;stretch position&quot;. A throw caught shortly after its bounce, that is, while the baseball&#x27;s path, rebounding from the turf, is sharply &quot;upward&quot;, is called a &quot;short hop&quot;. Since a ball that strikes the ground is always subject to the possibility of encountering a pebble or a rut or a spike-mark that sends it in a radically new direction, it is best that the first baseman catch the ball on the short hop by swiping or scooping the ball as close to the ground surface as possible. This technique also minimizes the amount of time required to make the putout.

===Tag play===
The second-most-difficult play for a first baseman is the &quot;tag play&quot;. Whenever an infielder&#x27;s throw is so far off the mark that the first baseman must abandon their base to catch it, the first baseman is left with only two options. To put the runner out, he must either lunge back to the base before the runner reaches it, &quot;or&quot; he must tag the runner before the runner reaches the base. A tag involves touching the runner with the ball (or with the gloved hand holding the ball) before the runner reaches the base. At first base, the typical tag play occurs when the infielder&#x27;s throw is &quot;high and to the left&quot; of the first baseman, causing him to jump and stretch their long mitt to catch the ball before it sails into the dugout or the grandstand. The tag is made, after the catch, by swiping the mitt downward, toward the in-coming runner&#x27;s head or shoulder, often in one fluid motion that is integrated with the act of catching the ball. Performed properly, the tag play can be spectacular to see.

==As a career move==
First basemen are typically not the most talented defensive players on a major-league team. Someone who has the agility, throwing arm, and raw speed to play another fielding position usually plays somewhere other than first base. Great-hitting catchers may play some games at first base so that they can hit in some games without having to absorb the rigor of catching every game.

According to Bill James, aside from pitchers and catchers, the most difficult defensive position to play is shortstop, followed by second base, center field, third base, left or right field (depending upon the ballpark), and finally first base as the easiest position. Anyone who can play another position on the field can play first base.

Lou Gehrig is an example of a player who played first base because he was not as strong a fielder as hitter. At or near the ends of their careers, good hitters are often moved to first base as their speed and throwing arms deteriorate, a more talented position player was acquired, or their teams become concerned with the likelihood of injury. Such players include Hall of Famers George Brett, Paul Molitor, Mike Schmidt and Jim Thome (third basemen), Ernie Banks (shortstop), Rod Carew (second baseman), Al Kaline (right fielder), Mickey Mantle (center fielder), Johnny Bench, Joe Mauer, and Mike Piazza (catchers), Stan Musial and Willie Stargell (left fielders). In 2023, Philadelphia Phillies all-star Bryce Harper moved from outfield to first base after undergoing Tommy John surgery; this enabled Harper to return to the field quicker than expected while also lessening the stress of throwing with his surgically repaired right arm. Only rarely does a player begin his major-league career at first base and go elsewhere, as with Jackie Robinson, a natural second baseman who was played at first base in his rookie season so that he would avoid the risk of malicious slides at second base. Hank Greenberg, a natural first baseman for the Detroit Tigers, moved to left field in his 11th major league season (1940) after his team acquired Rudy York, another slugging first baseman who was ill-suited to play anywhere else.

<text>Ian Vine (born 3 January 1974 in Portsmouth, England) is a British composer. Vine grew up in Libya and Hong Kong. He studied composition at the Royal Northern College of Music with Anthony Gilbert and privately with Simon Holt.

There are traces Near and Far Eastern modalities as well as gestural and formal elements in his music. &quot;SIRI&quot; (1997), for solo percussion with electronics, uses a rhythmic and structural language found in the highly ritualised percussion music of Japan and Korea.

&quot;writing on water&quot; (1999-), commissioned by Matthew Herbert and released on the Accidental label, is an expanding collection of short (sometimes only 20 seconds long) works using recorded acoustic instruments; and &quot;shadow grounds&quot; (1999), commissioned by the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival for the ensemble recherche as part of their &quot;In Nomine Broken Consort Book&quot;, a three-minute non-miniature of suspended sound.

His &quot;three black moons&quot; (1999), commissioned by the London Sinfonietta, was described by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &#x27;...the most striking piece takes its title from an Alexander Calder mobile - its magical floating sonorities had a Feldmanesque beauty.&#x27;

&quot;The Guardian&quot; has written of him that &quot;Vine&#x27;s music, clearly influenced by Morton Feldman, is beautifully imagined and precisely focused&quot;.

Vine is the artistic director of new music ensemble Radius.

<doc id="581938" wikidata="Q150249" url="?curid=581938" title="2867 Šteins">
<text>2867 Šteins (provisional designation ) is an irregular, diamond-shaped background asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 4 November 1969 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Chernykh at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory in Nauchnij on the Crimean peninsula. In September 2008, ESA&#x27;s spacecraft &quot;Rosetta&quot; flew by Šteins, making it one of few minor planets ever visited by a spacecraft. The bright E-type asteroid features 23 named craters and has a rotation period of 6.05 hours. It was named for Soviet Latvian astronomer Kārlis Šteins.

== Orbit and classification ==
Šteins is a non-family asteroid from the main belt&#x27;s background population. It orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 2.0–2.7 AU once every 3 years and 8 months (1,327 days; semi-major axis of 2.36 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.15 and an inclination of 10° with respect to the ecliptic. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins with a precovery, taken at the Palomar Observatory in November 1951, or 18 years prior to its official discovery observation.

== Naming ==
This minor planet was named in memory of Kārlis Šteins (1911–1983), a Latvian and Soviet astronomer. He was a long-time observatory director at the University of Latvia in Riga and designed astronomical instruments. Šteins is known for his work on cometary cosmogony and the study of Earth&#x27;s rotation. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 18 September 1986 ().

=== Features on Šteins ===
On 11 May 2012, IAU&#x27;s Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature announced a naming system for geographical features on Šteins. Inspired by the asteroid&#x27;s gem-like shape, its crater are given the English-language names of precious stones, with the largest being named Diamond crater &quot;(see below)&quot;.

Except for the montes of Mercury and the lunar maria (and proposed for 2 Pallas and 7 Iris), the craters of Šteins are the only features in the Solar System whose names are not derived from proper nouns. In addition, a distinct region on the asteroid has been named Chernykh Regio after the discoverer, Nikolai Chernykh.

== Physical characteristics ==
A study published in 2006 by astronomers at the European Southern Observatory showed that Šteins is an E-type asteroid with a diameter of approximately 4.6 kilometers. After the Rosetta flyby, the ESA described Šteins as a &quot;diamond in the sky&quot;, as it has a wide body that tapers into a point. The wide section is dominated by the large Diamond crater with a diameter of 2.1 kilometers, which surprised scientists, who were at first amazed the asteroid survived such an impact, while later it turned out that the crater-to-body diameter ratio of 0.79 is in fact not abnormally large as it follows an already established trend. Besides its irregular in shape, it does not have any moons.

=== Diameter and albedo ===
According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope, Šteins measures 5.16 and 4.92 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.30 and 0.34, respectively. Its overall Bond albedo is 0.24 ± 0.01. In 2012, the photographs of Šteins taken by &quot;Rosetta&quot; using stereophotoclinometry allowed scientists to determine that the asteroid&#x27;s dimensions are kilometers, which equates to a mean diameter in volume of 5.26 km. (Asteroid was later named for the scientist using this 3D-method.) The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; adopts an albedo of 0.34 and a diameter of 4.9 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 13.36.

=== Lightcurves and poles ===
Studying the asteroid with Rosetta space probe onboard OSIRIS cameras shortly before its flyby showed via a lightcurve analysis that Šteins has a rotation period of hours. The results of the rotational lightcurve agree with ground-based photometric observations of Šteins with a period of 6.049 hours and a brightness amplitude between 0.18 and 0.31 magnitude ().

A lightcurve inversion also modeled a concurring sidereal period of 6.04681 hours and determined a spin axis at (250.0°, −89.0°) in ecliptic coordinates (λ, β). The modeling was done by compiling a set of 26 previously obtained visible lightcurves.

== Exploration ==

=== &quot;Rosetta&quot; flyby ===
On 5 September 2008, the Rosetta space probe flew by Šteins at a distance of 800 km and a relatively slow speed of 8.6 km/s. Despite the short duration of this encounter (approximately 7 minutes in total), a great amount of data was obtained by the 15 scientific instruments operating on board the Rosetta spacecraft. This was the first of two planned asteroid flybys performed by the probe, the second being to the much larger 21 Lutetia in 2010. The timing of the fly-by meant that the asteroid was illuminated by the sun from the perspective of the spacecraft, making the transmitted images clear. The European Space Operations Centre streamed a press conference on Šteins later that day.

<text>Saale-Unstrut is a region (&quot;Anbaugebiet&quot;) for quality wine in Germany, and takes its name from the rivers Saale and Unstrut. The region is located on various hill slopes around these rivers. Most of the region&#x27;s under vine in 2008 is situated in the federal state of Saxony-Anhalt, with around in the state of Thuringia.

== Geography and climate ==

Saale-Unstrut is the northernmost of Germany&#x27;s wine regions, and is therefore one of Europe&#x27;s northernmost traditional wine regions. The wines from the Memleben Abbey were mentioned in the literature already in the year 998 AD. Because of the cooler climate Spätlese or Auslese can be produced only in exceptionally warm years and yields are generally low.

The region in the district Burgenlandkreis has a wine route which was opened in 1993.

== Grape varieties ==

The most common grape varieties are the white varieties Müller-Thurgau, at and 18.4% of the vineyard surface in 2008 and Weißburgunder (Pinot blanc) at 12.1%. White grape varieties make up 74% of Saale-Unstrut&#x27;s plantations. Varieties such as Müller-Thurgau and Silvaner, which elsewhere are considered to produce wines of more mediocre quality, are sometimes considered to give better wines in the cold climate such as Saale-Unstrut&#x27;s. The wines are labelled varietally, as most German wines, and are generally vinified dry with a refreshing acidity, resulting from the cool growing conditions.

The most cultivated grape varieties, by area in 2008, were:

<text>JanSport is an American brand of backpacks and collegiate apparel, now owned by VF Corporation, one of the world&#x27;s largest apparel companies. JanSport is the world&#x27;s largest backpack maker. Nearly half of all small backpacks sold in the United States are produced by JanSport and its sister brand The North Face, also owned by VF Corporation.

==History==
Murray Pletz (who changed his name to Murray McCrory in the early 1980s), an industrial design student, designed a backpack that used aluminum in its flexible frame. In January of 1966, Murray Pletz bought his girlfriend, Jan Lewis, a $180 sewing machine to sew the backpack. Pletz entered the finished backpack project in a design contest sponsored by the Aluminum Company of America and won the prize.&lt;ref name=&quot;oregonphotos/JanSport-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the contest award money, JanSport was founded in 1967 in Seattle, Washington, United States by Murray Pletz, his future wife (they married two years later) Janis &quot;Jan&quot; Lewis (for whom the company is named), and his father Norman Pletz. JanSport innovated with a panel-loading daypack, unlike traditional top-loading packs.

In 1975, JanSport introduced the first convertible travel pack, as well as its signature daypack. The latter was a popular product at the bookstore at the University of Washington, where Murray McCrory (née Pletz) had been a student and met his future wife, and was originally known as the University Bookstore Rucksack. Before long, it was being sold on college campuses across the U.S. It was the precursor to JanSport&#x27;s SuperBreak backpack, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;iconic&quot;.

In 1972, the founders began inviting their friends to join their climb on Mount Rainier to what is now known as the longest consecutive group climb. To this day, Jansport still holds the record of the most consecutive annual group climbs. In 2018, was their 46th annual Jansport Mount Rainier climb consisting of a team of 16 employees, retailers, international distributors, non-profit partners and media. 

In 1986, VF purchased JanSport&#x27;s then parent, Blue Bell.

JanSport&#x27;s corporate headquarters is in Denver Colorado, at VF Outdoor headquarters, where it shares offices with divisional siblings The North Face, Smartwool, Altra Running, Icebreaker, and Eastpak. A distribution facility in Everett, Washington, which had opened in 1971, closed in March 2012. JanSport&#x27;s collegiate apparel warehouse in Appleton, Wisconsin closed in 2017.
JanSport started by developing the external frame backpack which used a metal frame with a cloth packsack attached to it. The products made include technical day packs and internal frame backpacks. Up until the early 1990s all JanSport packs were made in the United States.

<text>Rose Is Rose is a syndicated comic strip, written by Pat Brady since its launch on April 16, 1984, and drawn since March 2004 by Don Wimmer. The strip revolves around Rose and Jimbo Gumbo, their son Pasquale, and the family cat Peekaboo. Rose and Jimbo are deeply in love with each other, sometimes exchanging love notes or kissing under the stars, and they dote fondly on Pasquale.

&quot;Rose Is Rose&quot; is unusual, especially in modern comic strips, in that it has a generally positive and cheerful outlook on life and deals heavily with the emotional states of its characters, especially Rose and Pasquale. Rose and sometimes Jimbo are drawn as little children to emphasize &quot;inner child&quot; experiences. Rose is sometimes shown leaning against her &quot;let it be&quot; tree when dealing with heavy burdens. The strip also features highly daring &quot;camera angles&quot; and perspectives, often giving the illusion through frames of real motion.

The strip often shows an alternate point of view based on the characters&#x27; fantasies. Rose often sees herself as Vicki, a biker chick, when faced with a conflict between selfish desire and social obligations, or when confronted with challenges to her usually mild-mannered personality. On the rare occasions when she and Jimbo are fighting, she usually sees herself locked away as a prisoner in a &quot;dungeon of resentment.&quot; Jimbo, who would like his wife to gain weight, sometimes fantasizes about her being plump and round-faced. Pasquale&#x27;s &quot;dream ship&quot; sequences get much play, as does his relationship with his beloved guardian angel or the bathtub&#x27;s dreaded drain monster. Even Peekaboo has elaborate fantasies.

From the comic&#x27;s debut in 1984 until the strip published on 9 August 1991, Pasquale spoke only in a &#x27;phonetic baby talk.&#x27; Since then, all of the characters (save for Mimi) have been portrayed as speaking coherent English.

The comic is distributed by United Features Syndicate. As of 2005, Pat Brady has been nominated eight times for a Reuben Award by the National Cartoonists Society for Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year. He won the 2004 award in that category for the first time. The strip has also won the Religious Public Relations Council&#x27;s Wilbur Award for Editorial Cartoon/Comic Strips.

==Characters==
*Rose Gumbo - Wife and mother. Rather shy in public situations, she makes the lifestyle of an everyday housewife appear adventurous and highly glamorous. She is witty, well read, sews sweet costumes for her son, bakes brownies, takes in a sunset almost daily, and teases her husband with her strawberry shampoo. She can hold a pleasant conversation with anyone, from her next-door neighbor to the birds living in the tree in her front yard. She is always there with a huge hug to comfort her husband and son, and never misses a night to tuck her little Pasquale in bed. Like Jimbo has to spiders, Rose has a deep fear of dust mites, derived from when she once saw a magnified image of one, and in her vivid imagination they tend to take on rather exaggerated proportions.
*Jimbo Gumbo - Husband and father. From the way he dresses, apparently works at a blue collar job. Enjoys placing love notes all around the house and especially in his wife&#x27;s tea cabinet. He&#x27;s an all around handyman, takes out the garbage when asked, loves baseball, but fear prevents him from coaxing a spider out of the shower. Despite such admirable qualities, he needs a little advice from time to time, which he seeks from The Amazing Perplexin - an occasionally recurring character in the comic strip. Jimbo also finds women sexier if they are a bit on the heavy side and occasionally tries to get Rose to gain weight - much to Rose&#x27;s dismay.
*Vicki the Biker - Rose&#x27;s alter-ego. The adventurous biker chick, with a leather miniskirt and a rose tattoo on the outer thigh of each leg, who lives on the edge and takes all those risks that one can not quite get away with as a housewife. She loves jalapeños and rattlesnake chili. Most likely to be seen riding her Harley into the sunset.
*Pasquale Gumbo - Rose and Jimbo&#x27;s son. Dreads having Jimbo cut his hair, as he occasionally instead cuts his ears. Loves to sit atop his cushy bed and look through his 3-D glasses at his comic books. Quite an inspiring Play-Doh artist, as well as an exemplary young student who loves school and getting homework, to the disdain of classmates. He and his cousin Clem become glued to the television set when &quot;Ranger Rory&quot; is on. He is timid about the bathtub drain monster and about playing baseball for his dad, but not so when it comes to sledding down the hill, doing cartwheels or catching fireflies. He is the only child of the Gumbo family and embodies the innocence that we only find in youth. Most of Pasquale&#x27;s adventures take place with his guardian angel, his cousin Clem, or while he is fast asleep, flying about in his dreamship. And as with most young boys, his dad is his greatest hero. (In an interview, Pat Brady has stated that &quot;Pasquale&quot; was a childhood nickname given to him by a family priest, after the name of a character in the 1940s radio program &quot;Life with Luigi&quot;.)
*Peekaboo - The family cat. Aloof and good-naturedly disdainful of the humans in her life. Like most cats, she spends her days on the quest for belly rubs and the perfect sunny spot to snooze the day away in. She is also a sucker for &quot;minty-fresh breath&quot;, craning her ever-extendable neck to capture the scent from her humans, and has an extraordinary ability to extend everything else in order to claim a favoured spot. Jimbo can not sit anywhere without Peekaboo getting in his lap. However, she also provides a more humorous side to the difficulties that cats and cat owners go through. She has a habit of getting her claws snagged on various objects, an incident referred to as a &quot;claw snag&quot;.
*Clem - Pasquale&#x27;s selfish cousin. Loves to tease Pasquale and play practical jokes on him, often engaging in one-upmanship with him; every toy he owns is always twice as spectacular as Pasquale&#x27;s toys. His alter ego is the &quot;Toweled Crusader&quot;. A running gag has Clem throwing water balloons or snowballs (depending on the season) at Pasquale on a semi-regular basis.
*Fanny - Rose&#x27;s sister, Clem&#x27;s mother. It appears that Clem gets his selfishness from his mother (as seen in a few strips where Rose goes back to her childhood).
*Mimi - The next door neighbors&#x27; baby girl who speaks in phonetics (though in early strips she only spoke in tiny peeps). Mimi spreads happiness and joy to those around her in that unique way that only toddlers can.
*Corky and Abby - Mimi&#x27;s parents. 
*Pasquale&#x27;s guardian angel - Usually depicted as a ghostly copy of Pasquale with fairy wings and a robe who becomes a gigantic and fearsome warrior when any kind of disturbance appears. From time to time will go overboard, and will subsequently receive an admonishing call from &quot;headquarters&quot;.
*Rose&#x27;s Mother - Rose&#x27;s mom, Pasquale&#x27;s grandma (aka &quot;Meemaw&quot;). She turns up now and again via phone calls and visits in her RV. She is a large woman, which makes Jimbo wish Rose would become more like her mother. She also has her own biker-chick alter-ego.
*Ms. Harris - Pasquale&#x27;s teacher, young, blonde and always happy.
*Murphy - One of several squirrels.

<text>Mont Albert is an inner eastern suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 12 kilometres east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Cities of Boroondara and Whitehorse local government areas. Mont Albert recorded a population of 4,948 at the 2021 census.

The main shopping centre of Mont Albert is Hamilton Street, a small street lined with shops. The suburb had its own railway station before being demolished as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project.

==History==
A residential subdivision south of the railway line, containing the current shopping centre, was put up for sale in 1887. The subdivision was planned in expectation of further land investment, which was delayed by the 1890s slump. Despite this, a local advancement association obtained the establishment of a railway station in 1891. The Surrey Hills golf club (1892-1907) utilized the ground on the north side of the railway line until residences appeared in any number.

The local shopping centre, located just south of the railway station, began construction in 1913. In 1915, a tram service along Whitehorse Road to the suburb&#x27;s north-eastern corner was established. Houses between tram and railway lines are distinguished by Edwardian, English Domestic Revival, and Arts and Crafts styles.

Mont Albert was an upper middle-class neighbourhood, and its strong brick three-story elementary school (1917) boasts many outstanding students, including MPs, scholars, and a university vice-chancellor. Houses are generously proportioned and sit on large lots. In 2014, Mont Albert Primary School had 691 students.

The Mont Albert businesses have kept a wider variety of retail establishments than is typical for a small town, however several were lost when the Salvation Army&#x27;s southern headquarters were established there. The eastern edge of Mont Albert is Elgar Road, which has been home to a gas factory, a technical college, and the Elgar campus of Box Hill TAFE. The Kingsley Gardens public reserve is right next door.

<text>Ashburton is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, southeast of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Boroondara local government area. Ashburton recorded a population of 7,952 at the .

Ashburton is known for the Ashburton Village shopping strip, the Ashburton Community Centre and the Ashburton Library on High Street. Nearby Warner Avenue hosts the Ashburton Pool and Recreation Centre and the Ashburton Seniors Centre. It is in close proximity to the Holmesglen Institute of TAFE, Monash University (Caulfield and Clayton campuses), Deakin University (Burwood campus) and Swinburne University (Hawthorn campus).

In 2021, Ashburton residents were found to have the longest lifespan of any residents in Victoria.

==History==
Ashburton is located on Wurundjeri land.

The Outer Circle Railway, originally from Oakleigh to Melbourne via Fairfield, was abbreviated to spur lines from Camberwell within a few years, northwards to Deepdene and southwards to Norwood Station by 1891. Norwood was changed to Ashburton, at the suggestion of a former local councillor, E. Dillon who had lived in Ashburton Terrace, Cork, Ireland. The area took its name from the station.

An unrealised objective of the railway line was to stimulate residential development, but at the time the locality was best known for the Ashburton Forest, overlooking Gardiners Creek, as a site for picnics. The &#x27;Ashy Dasher&#x27;, a dedicated steam train, brought day-trippers to the Forest.

In the 1920s Ashburton had a few shops, orchards and market gardens, supporting sufficient population for a primary school to be opened in 1928 (549 pupils, 2014). There was a public hall in High Street Road near Johnston Street where Catholic and Presbyterian church services were held in the late 1920s. By the end of the decade, sub-divisions on the north side of High Street began to urbanise the area. Ashburton Primary School on Fakenham Road opened in 1928.

In 1948 the railway line was extended by one station to Alamein Station to accommodation the residents of the housing built by the Victorian Government&#x27;s Housing Commission. In honour of returned servicemen and women who occupied much of the new estate, the streets of the new area were named after World War II sites in the Pacific and Western Desert campaigns, and war-time aircraft and flying boats. Street names include Victory Boulevard, Benghazi Avenue, Tobruk Road, Ambon Street, Huon Grove, Lancaster Street, and Liberator Street. The Solway school opened in 1950 with the name Darling East. It was renamed Solway in 1956 after the Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department opened in Solway post office near Solway Street.
The rail line was electrified in 1924, and the Ashburton Post Office opened on 15 December 1927. Another office was opened at Solway (in the south-west of the suburb) and operated from 1954 until 1978.

==Transport==
Ashburton has two stations, Ashburton and Alamein, both located on the Alamein railway line. The 734 bus service runs down High Street.

<text>Ashwood is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 14 km south east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Monash local government area. Ashwood recorded a population of 7,154 at the 2021 census.

Ashwood was named after the suburbs of Burwood and Ashburton, because it is located between the two. It has the postcode of 3147, which it shares with the neighbouring suburb of Ashburton.

Ashwood is bounded by Huntingdale Road to the east, the Glen Waverley railway line to the south, Warrigal Road to the west and a wandering alignment to the north that approximately follows Carlyle Street, Zodiac Street, Gardiners Creek, Ashwood Drive, Montpellier Road and Arthur Street.

==History==

Until the early 1950s, when residential development commenced in the area, Warrigal Road formed the boundary of suburban development, with market gardens, poultry farms and unmade roads to the east. The new dwellings constructed at this time were typically double-fronted cream brick houses. By 1951 the population of Ashwood had risen to an estimated 1500 persons.

The Post Office opened on 3 October 1949, but was known as Ashburton East until 1951. Jordanville Post Office in the suburb opened in 1953. Stocksville Post Office, on Cleveland Road, was open from 1955 until 1993.

<doc id="581967" wikidata="Q4853147" url="?curid=581967" title="Balwyn">
<text>Balwyn () is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 10 km east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Boroondara local government area. Balwyn recorded a population of 13,495 at the 2021 census.

The suburb&#x27;s post-European settlement character was initially agricultural with several large estates built around a small village centre. Since the early 20th century, farms and mansions gave way to suburban development as the population of Melbourne rapidly grew. Today Balwyn is almost entirely residential and one of Victoria&#x27;s most exclusive and affluent suburbs, regularly ranking in the state&#x27;s top 10 most expensive suburbs.

==History==
===Etymology===
In the late 1850s Andrew Murray, commercial editor and political writer for The Argus newspaper, bought land on the hill overlooking Canterbury Gardens. He named his house Balwyn from the Gaelic &quot;bal&quot; and the Saxon &quot;wyn&quot;, meaning &#x27;the home of the vine&#x27;. Balwyn Road and the district were named after it. The house was located on the site that is now part of Fintona Girls&#x27; School.

===Pre-European settlement===
The formally recognised traditional owners for the area in which Balwyn is located are the Wurundjeri People, who lived on the land for at least 14,000 years. The Wurundjeri People are represented by the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung Cultural Heritage Aboriginal Corporation.

===19th century===
Following the Foundation of Melbourne, Balwyn was part of Henry Elgar&#x27;s Special Survey of in 1841, which was subdivided into small farms and grazing runs.

In 1868 Balwyn Primary School was opened in Balwyn Road about 100 metres north of Whitehorse Road. It was moved to its present site, south of Whitehorse Road, in 1880, opposite Murray&#x27;s property. Balwyn&#x27;s first town centre was near the intersection of Balwyn and Whitehorse Roads, containing a few shops, a blacksmith and the athenaeum or mechanics&#x27; institute. Anglican services began in 1868 and the St. Barnabas church, Balwyn Road, was opened in 1872.

Balwyn Post Office first opened on 26 August 1874, in a rural area, closed in 1894, then reopened in 1920. It faced a second closure on 11 February 2011 but due to a campaign by local residents and the intervention of the Federal Member, Josh Frydenberg, the service was reopened.

The Outer Circle railway line, with a station at Deepdene, opened in 1891, was closed in 1893, re-opened in 1900 then finally closed to passenger traffic in 1927.

===20th century===

The electric tram system was extended along Cotham Road to terminate at Burke Road, Deepdene, on 30 May 1913. The line was extended along Whitehorse Road, through Balwyn to terminate at Union Road, Mont Albert, on 30 September 1916.
The Balwyn Cinema, currently operated by Palace Cinemas, first opened as a single screen theatre in 1930. It was later converted into a 5-screen multiplex in the 1990s, but the foyer was restored in 2010, uncovering the original 1930s tiled floor. Until 2016 it also served as the head office of Palace Cinemas. The cinema&#x27;s second major restoration in less than a decade saw the former office space converted into 6 extra screens, bringing the total number to 11.

A considerable number of local churches, such as the Deepdene Methodist Church, were constructed during the post-World War II boom of suburban development in the area.

Balwyn&#x27;s status as an affluent suburb has seen middle to upper-middle-class families from suburbs such as Kew and Brighton transfer to the area to take advantage of the suburb&#x27;s relatively large block sizes and proximity to some of Victoria&#x27;s best private schools including those in the neighbouring suburbs of Canterbury and Kew. Some of the initial development of the suburb occurred along the Whitehorse Road tramline, along which the Wade handbag and the Jarvis Walker fishing rod factories were once located. 

The south western part of Balwyn was excised as the suburb of Deepdene in 2010. 

===21st century===

Balwyn is consistently ranked as one of Melbourne&#x27;s 5 most exclusive suburbs. The heritage-protected Reid Estate is especially noted as an area of Balwyn between Mont Albert Road and Whitehorse Road containing many architecturally significant Interwar mansions. 

The suburb has been immortalised by the Skyhooks single named after the suburb, &#x27;Balwyn Calling&#x27;, while The Age newspaper once described the suburb as &quot;arguably Melbourne&#x27;s most loved&quot;.
In the 12-month period to January 2020 Balwyn reported a median house price of A$1.6 million for a three bedroom house.

<text>Balwyn North, also known as North Balwyn, is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 10 km east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Cities of Boroondara and Whitehorse local government areas. Balwyn North recorded a population of 21,302 at the 2021 census. It contains the localities of Greythorn and Bellevue.

Following European settlement of Melbourne, development in Balwyn North was slow and largely as agricultural land. The suburban expansion after the Second World War reached the area in the 1940s and 1950s and thousands of single dwelling houses were built across the area. Today it retains its largely residential character with small areas of retail and parkland.

==History==
===Etymology===
The suburb shares its name with Balwyn to the south. It is named for the estate of Andrew Murray from the Gaelic &quot;bal&quot; and the Saxon &quot;wyn&quot;, meaning &#x27;the home of the vine&#x27;. Balwyn Road and the district were named after it.

===Pre-European settlement===
The formally recognised traditional owners for the area in which Balwyn North is located are the Wurundjeri people. The Wurundjeri people are represented by the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung Cultural Heritage Aboriginal Corporation.

===20th century===
Balwyn North was one of the first Melbourne suburbs to be developed according to the pattern of postwar suburbia, with expansive, quiet residential areas designed as family homes and relatively few business districts. The original route of Bulleen Road began at the present-day corner of Kilby Road and Burke Road, but by the 1900s, its route had changed to its present-day alignment. This was a result of Elgar&#x27;s Special Survey, which dragged the alignment of Burke Road further west, resulting in the surrounding road network being forced to adjust.

A Balwyn North Post Office opened on 1 April 1937. This was renamed Burke Road in 1941, when a new Balwyn North office opened at its current location. The Greythorn Post Office opened in 1951. The suburb was lampooned in the 1974 song by Australian band Skyhooks, Balwyn Calling.

===21st century===
Consistently among Melbourne&#x27;s top 20 most exclusive postcodes, Balwyn North&#x27;s status as an affluent suburb has seen middle to upper-middle-class families from surrounding localities transfer to the area to take advantage of the suburb&#x27;s relatively large block sizes and proximity to some of Victoria&#x27;s best private schools including those in the neighbouring suburbs.

In the 12-month period to January 2020 Balwyn North reported a median house price of A$1.46 million for a three bedroom house.

==Geography==
The north-western part of the suburb is known as Bellevue and the eastern part as Greythorn.

===Localities===
====Greythorn====
Greythorn was developed later than North Balwyn, but has had residents living there since the 1830s, when the Maughan and Towt families bought large tracts of land in the area. Present-day Greythorn Road was formerly known as &quot;Towt&#x27;s Road&quot; but renamed to &quot;Whitethorn Road&quot;, after the many whitethorn hedges that had been planted along it. To avoid confusion with Whitehorse Road, the name was changed again to &quot;Greythorn&quot; some time in the 1920s. 

The area around Greythorn Park was a wildlife sanctuary from 1938 until 1954, when the area between the park and Greythorn Road was subdivided and sold for housing. 

Greythorn Primary School was opened in 1953 and occupies a site covering approximately two hectares.

===Parks and gardens===
Balwyn North is host to a large number of parks and reserves, which are used for both passive and active recreation. A line of parks through which Glass Creek formerly ran at surface level lies at the heart of the suburb, stretching from Jacka Street Reserve in the east, through Gordon Barnard Reserve and Hislop Park in the centre, ending with Macleay Park in the west. Other parks in the suburb include Greythorn Park, Leigh Park and Koonung Creek Reserve.

==Transport==
Bicycle tracks connect with the Main Yarra Trail, along the Yarra River and the Eastern Freeway. Tram route 48 passes through Balwyn North, running along Doncaster Road and terminating at the intersection with Balwyn Road. A number of bus routes connect Balwyn North with suburbs such as Box Hill, Camberwell, Doncaster and Templestowe. A number of freeway bus services have stops at the entrance of the Eastern Freeway, on the northern edge of the suburb.

In recent times, there have been numerous calls from both residents and local councils for the extension of the route 48 tram from its present terminus to either the Doncaster Park + Ride facility or further along Doncaster Road to Westfield Doncaster.

==Education==
Located in Balwyn North are several primary schools, such as Greythorn, Balwyn North, St Bedes, Boroondara Park and Bellevue. Balwyn High School is located on Buchanan Avenue, and is so highly sought after, particularly by Asian families, that property prices within its student catchment area sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars more than nearby properties not located in the area.

==Shopping==
The main shopping strip is located at the intersection of Doncaster and Bulleen Roads, known as &quot;The Village&quot;. There are a number of other local shopping strips, such as Greythorn Village, located further east along Doncaster Road, the East Balwyn Shopping Centre and Belmore Heights Shopping Centre.

<doc id="581973" wikidata="Q4996743" url="?curid=581973" title="Bulleen, Victoria">
<text>Bulleen ( ) is an eastern suburb in Melbourne, Australia, 13 km north-east of the Melbourne central business district, located within the City of Manningham local government area. Bulleen recorded a population of 11,219 at the 2021 census.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Bulleen&quot; originates from the nearby Bolin Bolin Billabong. &quot;Buln-Buln&quot; translates to lyrebird, which is generally accepted to be the suburb&#x27;s name meaning.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Temperatures in Bulleen are known to fluctuate. During the 2009 southeastern Australia heat wave the suburb was reportedly around one degree cooler (at ) than in the city, but during a heat wave just the next month it peaked at a record , on 7 February – compared to in the city.

==History==


===Pre-European settlement===
The Bulleen billabongs were an important territory for the Manna Gum people for approximately 5,000 years. Generations had lived on the river flats when wild fish and ducks were abundant. &quot;Bolin&quot; was the largest lake/billabong in the area and was a significant ritual meeting place for the Aboriginal people, where numerous corroborees were held either by the billabong or on the hills.

===Post-European settlement===
In 1841, Frederic Unwin, a Sydney solicitor, purchased 5,120 acres – or eight square miles – of land, including all of the present suburb of Bulleen. The land was purchased from the Crown for one pound an acre under the terms of the short-lived Special Survey regulations. The area was sometimes known as Unwin&#x27;s Special Survey.

The first Bulleen Post Office opened on 1 April 1952, was renamed Bulleen West in 1960 and closed in 1976. Bulleen South office opened in 1959, was renamed Bulleen in 1960 and again named Bulleen South in 1969 when the current Bulleen office opened.

Public transport in Bulleen is limited to bus services, many of them running to the Melbourne CBD via dedicated bus lanes on the Eastern Freeway and Hoddle Street. Bus routes in Bulleen are operated by Kinetic Melbourne and operate primarily on main roads, though Templestowe Road in the north of the suburb is a notable exception of proper bus services.

Throughout the 1970s the Doncaster railway line was planned by the State Government to run down the middle of the Eastern Freeway and serve the suburb. Land was acquired for the line but was sold in the 1980s. Various plans have also been made for extension of the tram route 48 north to Doncaster.

<doc id="581974" wikidata="Q1131652" url="?curid=581974" title="Coq (software)">
<text>Coq is an interactive theorem prover first released in 1989. It allows for expressing mathematical assertions, mechanically checks proofs of these assertions, helps find formal proofs, and extracts a certified program from the constructive proof of its formal specification. Coq works within the theory of the &quot;calculus of inductive constructions&quot;, a derivative of the &quot;calculus of constructions&quot;. Coq is not an automated theorem prover but includes automatic theorem proving tactics (procedures) and various decision procedures.

The Association for Computing Machinery awarded Thierry Coquand, Gérard Huet, Christine Paulin-Mohring, Bruno Barras, Jean-Christophe Filliâtre, Hugo Herbelin, Chetan Murthy, Yves Bertot, and Pierre Castéran with the 2013 ACM Software System Award for Coq.

The name &quot;Coq&quot; is a wordplay on the name of Thierry Coquand, &quot;calculus of constructions&quot; or &quot;CoC&quot; and follows the French computer science tradition of naming software after animals (&quot;coq&quot; in French meaning rooster). On October 11, 2023, the development team announced that Coq will be renamed &quot;The Rocq Prover&quot; in coming months, and began updating the code base, website, and associated tools.

== Overview ==
When viewed as a programming language, Coq implements a dependently typed functional programming model; when viewed as a logical system, it implements a higher-order type theory. The development of Coq has been supported since 1984 by French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA), now in collaboration with École Polytechnique, University of Paris-Sud, Paris Diderot University, and French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS). In the 1990s, École normale supérieure de Lyon (ENS Lyon) was also part of the project. The development of Coq was initiated by Gérard Huet and Thierry Coquand, and more than 40 people, mainly researchers, have contributed features to the core system since its inception. The implementation team has successively been coordinated by Gérard Huet, Christine Paulin-Mohring, Hugo Herbelin, and Matthieu Sozeau. Coq is mainly implemented in OCaml with a bit of C. The core system can be extended by way of a plug-in mechanism.

The name means &#x27;rooster&#x27; in French and stems from a French tradition of naming research development tools after animals. Up until 1991, Coquand was implementing a language called the &quot;calculus of constructions&quot; and it was simply called &quot;CoC&quot; then. In 1991, a new implementation based on the extended &quot;calculus of inductive constructions&quot; was begun and the name changed from CoC to Coq in an indirect reference to Coquand, who developed the &quot;calculus of constructions&quot; along with Gérard Huet and contributed to the &quot;calculus of inductive constructions&quot; with Christine Paulin-Mohring.

Coq provides a specification language called Gallina (&quot;hen&quot; in Latin, Spanish, Italian and Catalan).
Programs written in Gallina have the weak normalization property, implying that they always terminate.
This is a distinctive property of the language, since infinite loops (non-terminating programs) are common in other programming languages,
and is one way to avoid the halting problem.

As an example, consider a proof of a lemma that taking the successor of a natural number flips its parity. The fold-unfold tactic introduced by Danvy is used to help keep the proof simple.
Ltac fold_unfold_tactic name := intros; unfold name; fold name; reflexivity.

Require Import Arith Nat Bool.

Fixpoint is_even (n : nat) : bool :=
 match n with
 | 0 =&gt;
 true
 | S n&#x27; =&gt;
 eqb (is_even n&#x27;) false
 end.

Lemma fold_unfold_is_even_0:
 is_even 0 = true.

Proof.
 fold_unfold_tactic is_even.
Qed.

Lemma fold_unfold_is_even_S:
 forall n&#x27; : nat,
 is_even (S n&#x27;) = eqb (is_even n&#x27;) false.

Proof.
 fold_unfold_tactic is_even.
Qed.

Lemma successor_flips_evenness:
 forall n : nat,
 is_even n = negb (is_even (S n)).

Proof.
 intro n.
 rewrite -&gt; (fold_unfold_is_even_S n).
 destruct (is_even n).

 * simpl.
 reflexivity.

 * simpl.
 reflexivity.
Qed.

==Notable uses==
===Four color theorem and SSReflect extension===
Georges Gonthier of Microsoft Research in Cambridge, England and Benjamin Werner of INRIA used Coq to create a surveyable proof of the four color theorem, which was completed in 2002. Their work led to the development of the SSReflect (&quot;Small Scale Reflection&quot;) package, which was a significant extension to Coq. Despite its name, most of the features added to Coq by SSReflect are general-purpose features and are not limited to the computational reflective programming style of proof. These features include:

* Added convenient notations for irrefutable and refutable pattern matching, on inductive types with one or two constructors
* Implicit arguments for functions applied to zero arguments, which is useful when programming with higher-order functions
* Concise anonymous arguments
* An improved codice_1 tactic with more powerful matching
* Support for reflection

SSReflect 1.11 is freely available, dual-licensed under the open source CeCILL-B or CeCILL-2.0 license, and compatible with Coq 8.11.

==Other applications==

*CompCert: an optimizing compiler for almost all of the C programming language which is largely programmed and proven correct in Coq.
*Disjoint-set data structure: correctness proof in Coq was published in 2007.
*Feit–Thompson theorem: formal proof using Coq was completed in September 2012.
*Busy beaver: The value of the 5-state winning busy beaver was discovered by Heiner Marxen and Jürgen Buntrock in 1989, but only proved to be the winning fifth busy beaver — stylized as BB(5) — in 2024 using a proof in Coq.

==Tactic language==

In addition to constructing Gallina terms explicitly, Coq supports the use of &quot;tactics&quot; written in the built-in language Ltac or in OCaml. These tactics automate the construction of proofs, carrying out trivial or obvious steps in proofs. Several tactics implement decision procedures for various theories. For example, the &quot;ring&quot; tactic decides the theory of equality modulo ring or semiring axioms via associative-commutative rewriting. For example, the following proof establishes a complex equality in the ring of integers in just one line of proof:
Require Import ZArith.
Open Scope Z_scope.
Goal forall a b c:Z,
 (a + b + c) ^ 2 =
 a * a + b ^ 2 + c * c + 2 * a * b + 2 * a * c + 2 * b * c.
 intros; ring.
Qed.
Built-in decision procedures are also available for the empty theory (&quot;congruence&quot;), propositional logic (&quot;tauto&quot;), quantifier-free linear integer arithmetic (&quot;lia&quot;), and linear rational/real arithmetic (&quot;lra&quot;). Further decision procedures have been developed as libraries, including one for Kleene algebras and another for certain geometric goals.

<doc id="581979" wikidata="Q1033731" url="?curid=581979" title="Canterbury, Victoria">
<text>Canterbury is an eastern suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 10 km from Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Boroondara local government area. Canterbury recorded a population of 7,800 at the 2021 census.

Famed for its leafy green boulevards and substantial, opulent historic residences, Canterbury is one of Melbourne&#x27;s most expensive and exclusive suburbs.

==Geography==
Canterbury extends as far as Mont Albert Road in the north, Burke Road in the west, Chatham and Highfield Roads in the east and Riversdale Road to the south. The main thoroughfare through Canterbury is Canterbury Road, which runs east–west and roughly bisects the suburb.

Canterbury is the home to many of Victoria&#x27;s oldest and most prestigious private schools, including Camberwell Grammar School, Camberwell Girls Grammar School and Strathcona Baptist Girls Grammar School. Other schools include Camberwell High School, Canterbury Girls&#x27; Secondary College and Canterbury Primary School. Canterbury contains various parks and gardens and is home to the Camberwell Hockey Club in Matlock Street. The Canterbury Sports Ground, home of cricket and Australian football, is in Chatham Road.

The main shopping area in Canterbury is around the railway station and includes shops in Canterbury Road, as well as Maling Road. Larger shopping centres nearby include Burke Road in Camberwell and Whitehorse Road in Balwyn.

Canterbury is serviced by the Canterbury and East Camberwell stations, on the Lilydale and Belgrave train lines. It is also serviced by tram routes 72 and 109.

==History==
The railway station is in many ways responsible for the suburb&#x27;s existence: before the opening of the railway to the City in 1882, the area was a semi-rural area. Even then, it was occupied by the well to do. Many of these early residents and in some cases, their properties, are remembered in the street names of the suburb, notably Logan Street and Monomeath Avenue.

Canterbury Post Office opened on 22 November 1870 (it was closed between 1887 and 1892). It has since been turned into a café.

The first subdivision in the area came in 1885, when Michael Logan created the &#x27;Claremont Park Estate&#x27; within the area of Canterbury Road, Bryson Street, Prospect Hill Road and Logan Street.

At around this time, Edward Snowden settled on 7 hectares in the area centred on a manor he named Monomeath. In 1900 Snowden&#x27;s estate was subdivided and sold off to form what is now Monomeath Avenue and residents such as notable architect Percey Kernot and prominent citizen George Coghill moved in. The road was paved in 1911 and lined with oak trees. Over time it has gained much cachet in Australian society, famed for its wealthy and sometimes eccentric residents.

==Population==
In the 2016 Census, there were 8,056 people in Canterbury. 67.2% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were China 7.9%, England 3.7%, Malaysia 1.7%, New Zealand 1.6% and India 1.3%. 73.4% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 9.9%, Cantonese 2.4% and Italian 1.3%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 37.7%, Catholic 20.1% and Anglican 12.8%.

==Culture==
Canterbury is regarded as one of Melbourne&#x27;s most exclusive suburbs, particularly the &quot;Golden Mile&quot; – a term referring to a part of Mont Albert Road, running west from Balwyn Road and the avenues that connect it to Canterbury Road, specifically Monomeath Avenue, which is lined by large, century old oak trees and grand ornate mansions and is home to many notable politicians and leaders of business and industry.

Other blue-chip locales along this stretch include Alexandra Avenue, Hopetoun Avenue, Victoria Avenue and The Ridge. It consistently ranks in the top three suburbs for average house prices in Melbourne.

===Notable residents===
Present and past residents of Canterbury include or have included:
* Sir Macfarlane Burnet virologist best known for his contributions to immunology. He won a Nobel Prize in 1960 for predicting acquired immune tolerance and was best known for developing the theory of clonal selection. He was the first ever Australian of the Year and the Burnet Institute is named in his honour
* Frank Cheshire, bookseller and publisher who founded the F. W. Cheshire Pty. Ltd. publishing house
* Frank Cicuttoformer CEO of National Australia Bank
* Sir Rupert Hamerformer Premier of Victoria
* Billy Harvey , Australian Rules footballer who during World War I won the Military Cross and was killed during the Battle of Passchendaele
* Alfred Mellorstockbroker and financier
* Kylie and Dannii Minogue&#x27;s family
* Andrew Peacockformer federal leader of the Liberal Party of Australia
* Tom Schiefferformer US Ambassador to Australia, and to Japan

==Sport==
The suburb has an Australian rules football team called the Canterbury Cobras with senior and junior teams for women and men and boys and girls. The club founded in 1881 is one of the oldest local clubs still in existence. The club originally played on a ground where Strathcona is now situated, before moving in the late 1890s to an oval built by William Malone behind his Canterbury Club Hotel in between Maling and Wattle Valley Roads. This ground was the home of the cricket and football clubs. The club moved to its current location at the Canterbury Sportsground in the early 1900&#x27;s.

It has worn its distinctive red, gold (originally yellow) and black colours since 1915. This was chosen by locals to respect the memory of the Anzacs sacrifice in Flanders Fields, Belgium. The club won its first senior premiership in 1920 when it defeated Mitcham by a point. The club has also won senior mens premierships in 1923, 1956, 1969,1972, 1991,2003,2015,2024. The club briefly changed its colours to Green with a gold vee at the end of World War 2 when it feared its jumper looked too much like the postwar new German flag. The club reverted back to its old colors in 1949 and worn them since.(Canterbury Football Club-Berries to Cobras-A History 1881-2013-James Nicolas: Vivid Publishing 2013)

Well known names in footy such as Hawthorn Captain Bob Williams, Port Adelaide superstar Jack Abley, Hawthorn Captain John Peck, Hawthorn presidents Trevor Coote and Brian Coleman, Hawthorn&#x27;s Peter Curran, Fitzroy players Dale Fleming and Darren Kappler amongst many to have worn the Canterbury jumper. South Melbourne legend Bob Pratt who was a longtime local and administrator of the club. Gold Coast star Matty Rowell played his junior footy with the Cobras.

The club has successfully launched a womens senior team in the 2000s and they won the 2017 Reserves premiership.

==Schools==

Canterbury has a number of primary and secondary schools in its vicinity. These include Canterbury Primary School, Camberwell Grammar School, Camberwell High School, Strathcona Baptist Girls&#x27; Grammar School, and Canterbury Girls&#x27; Secondary College.

==Places of worship==
* Canterbury Christadelphians
* Canterbury Presbyterian Church
* Canterbury Baptist Church

<doc id="581980" wikidata="Q40427" url="?curid=581980" title="Sher Ali Khan">
<text>Sher Ali Khan (Persian and ; c. 1825 – 21 February 1879) was Amir of Afghanistan from 1863 to 1866 and from 1868 until his death in 1879. He was one of the sons of Dost Mohammed Khan, founder of the Barakzai dynasty in Afghanistan.

==Life==
Sher Ali Khan was born into a Barakzai Pashtun family. Initially he seized power after his father died, but was quickly ousted by his older brother, Mohammad Afzal Khan. Afghan Civil War (1863-1869) followed and ended after Sher Ali Khan defeated his brother and regained the title of Amir. 

=== Reforms ===
Sher Ali Khan&#x27;s reign as Amir is often remembered for his attempts at reforming Barakzai rule in Afghanistan. Changes brought during his rule included the creation of government posts, military reform, the introduction of the first postal service in Afghanistan and the first attempts by an Afghan leader at promoting the Pashto language. 

Sher Ali Khan tried to limit the power of the Barakzai sardars. He didn&#x27;t allow his sons to administer provinces and instead appointed governors loyal to him. He also had a council of 12 members to advise him on matters of state. He created various ministerial offices like Prime Minister (Sadr-i Azam/صدر اعظم), minister of finance, minister of the interior, minister of war, minister of foreign affairs, and minister of the treasury. 

Under Sher Ali Khan&#x27;s reign, Afghanistan was divided into 5 provinces: Kabul, Herat, Afghan Turkestan, Kandahar, and Farah. Formerly Farah had been subject to Herat, but instead he made it a separate province and gave it to his cousin, Sardar Mohammad Afzal (not to be confused with Mohammad Afzal Khan).

During his reign, Sher Ali Khan embarked on a project to modernise his armed forces, standardising uniforms and equipment. After being gifted a battery of mountain guns and several howitzers by the British in 1868, Sher Ali realised the potential of breech-loading artillery and was determined to modernise Afghanistan&#x27;s arsenal. Whilst his early attempts failed, Sher Ali&#x27;s craftsmen had soon established new workshops at the Bala Hissar Arsenal and began to produce four to five modern breechloaders each month. Despite his successes in producing relatively modern weapons and equipment, poor discipline and a lack of competent officers meant the new cannons were quickly captured by the British during the Second Anglo-Afghan War. British forces captured more than 250 guns from the Afghans during their campaign.

Sher Ali&#x27;s rule was hindered by pressure from both the British Empire and the Russian Empire, though he attempted to keep Afghanistan neutral during their conflict. His neutrality resulted in Afghanistan being invaded by the British which started the Second Anglo-Afghan War. This war resulted in a British victory and a devastating loss to Afghanistan as Sher Ali Khan was forced to give away a large amount of territory to British India including the city of Quetta. In 1878, the fragile neutrality fell apart with Sher Ali Khan&#x27;s resisting of British demands for Afghanistan to accept a permanent envoy in Kabul. The British viewing this as confirmation of Sher Ali Khan&#x27;s inclination towards Russia, gathered their forces and marched on Kabul. Sher Ali Khan opted to leave Kabul in order to seek political and military aid from the Russian Empire. He died in Mazar-e Sharif trying to reach the Russian border, leaving the throne to his son Mohammad Yaqub Khan.

<doc id="581983" wikidata="Q158518" url="?curid=581983" title="9969 Braille">
<text>9969 Braille, provisional designation , is an eccentric, rare-type and elongated asteroid from the innermost regions of the asteroid belt, classified as Mars-crosser and slow rotator, approximately 1–2 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered in 1992, by astronomers at Palomar Observatory and later named after Louis Braille, the inventor of the writing system for the blind. It was photographed in closeup by the spacecraft Deep Space 1 in 1999, but a malfunction resulted in indistinct images.

== Discovery and naming ==

Discovered on May 27, 1992, by E. F. Helin and K. J. Lawrence working at the Palomar observatory as part of NASA&#x27;s Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey, it was given the provisional designation . Later, it was named Braille in honour of Louis Braille as suggested by Kennedy Space Center software engineer Kerry Babcock in The Planetary Society&#x27;s contest titled &quot;Name That Asteroid&quot;. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 28 July 1999 ().

== Orbit ==

Braille has an unusually inclined orbit, and belongs to the somewhat rare class of asteroids known as Mars-crossing asteroids. Simulations of its orbit by scientists of the Deep Space 1 project predict that it will evolve into an Earth-crossing orbit in about 4000 years. Although its closest approach to the Sun is closer than Mars orbit, its highly elliptical orbit takes it almost half-way to Jupiter at its apoapsis, and as such its semi-major axis is too large for it to be classified as an Amor asteroid.

== Physical characteristics ==

Braille is a Q-type asteroid, composed mostly of olivine and pyroxene. Early ground-based observations had suggested that it could have been a V-type asteroid with similarities of composition between it and the much larger 4 Vesta. The asteroid is irregularly shaped, measuring approximately 2.1 km × 1 km × 1 km.

== Exploration ==
Detailed information about Braille comes primarily from the Deep Space 1 probe, which passed within 26 km of the asteroid on July 29, 1999, and from extensive ground based observations done in conjunction with the mission. By the time Deep Space 1 reached Braille, its ultraviolet spectrometer had failed, but it did return two CCD images of medium resolution and three infrared spectra during the encounter. However, although the probe came within 26 km of Braille, the images and spectra were taken from an approximate distance of 14 000 km, due to problems with the tracking system.

The main purpose of the Deep Space 1 mission was technology testing, but the encounter with Braille was of strong scientific value. No lone asteroid as small as Braille had previously been observed from such a short distance.

<text>Hawthorn is an inner suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, east of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the City of Boroondara local government area. Hawthorn recorded a population of 22,322 at the 2021 census.

== History ==
===Etymology===
The name Hawthorn, gazetted in 1840 as &quot;Hawthorne&quot;, is thought to have originated from a conversation involving Charles La Trobe, who commented that the native shrubs looked like flowering Hawthorn bushes. Alternatively, the name may originate from the bluestone house—so named and built by James Denham Pinnock in Denham Street—which stands to this day.

===19th century===
The mansion named Invergowrie – originally Burwood or Burwood Hill - was built by James Frederick Palmer in 1850 and the original source of the name of the current Burwood Road. Mayor of Melbourne in 1846, he established the first punt to cross the eastern Yarra around the current Bridge Road area in 1842. The cost was said to be around the equivalent of 45 cents (expensive for the time) but it was very successful and assisted the development and sale of the original Hawthorn allotments. The house was sold after Palmers death in 1871 and subdivided by entrepreneur George Coppin to create the landmark Saint James Estate.

&#x27;The Hawthorns&#x27; is one of Hawthorn&#x27;s oldest houses, built of bluestone in 1845 for James Denham Pinnock (1810–1875), Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court, before there was a bridge across the river. His property stretched from Church Street to the river, between Denham Street and Lawes Street and was subdivided circa 1850. The homestead block, west of Calvin Street was acquired by pioneer squatter Henry Creswick, whose family remained there for 70 years. Its view was altered by the subsequent development along Creswick Street and Osbourne Court. In the 1856 electoral roll, Creswick&#x27;s address was given as Hawthorne House. Both Pinnock and Creswick were leading members of the Anglican Church.

Tay Creggan, 30 Yarra Street on the banks of the Yarra River, was built in 1892 and was perhaps intended by architect Guyon Purchas to be his own home. However, it was tenanted during the 1890s depression, then the McKean family before World War I and then by the Mortell family. Later, it was owned by the Roman Catholic Church and occupied by the &quot;Ladies of the Grail&quot; from 1939 until 1969. Now owned by Strathcona Baptist Girls Grammar School, it is used as a Year 9 campus. The roof and detailed chimneys were restored in 1993 and boatsheds built near the river. It is frequently rented out by the school to use the original hall for functions.

The house &quot;Kawarau&quot; was built as &quot;Warrington&quot; for Robert Robinson in 1891 and 1892. It had 12 rooms and 22 acres of land in 1893. Frederick John Cato (of Moran &amp; Cato fame) bought the house and moved in with his family in 1895. The name &quot;Kawarau&quot; comes from the name of a New Zealand river. Much later it became &quot;Stephanie’s Restaurant&quot; for some years. It is now occupied by Alia College. Frederick Cato&#x27;s daughter wrote a book about the family. She contacted the historical society about names of Hawthorn streets. With the possibility of a brickworks on the north part of the original Tooronga estate, her father bought the property. It was partly subdivided as Tooronga Heights before World War I, with street names for family, friends and New Zealand place names, beginning with &quot;B&quot; for streets lying east and west and &quot;L&quot; for those lying north and south. In 1934, the present Cato Park was donated to Hawthorn.

==Geography==
===Urban structure===
Hawthorn expanded rapidly during the 1880s land boom when grand Victorian houses built in subdivisions like the Grace Park Estate spoke of an upper class suburb. High rates of home ownership, a plethora of noteworthy independent schools (including, from 1916, Scotch College), grand churches, and prominent sporting clubs such as the Grace Park Tennis Club, consolidated Hawthorn&#x27;s status as an affluent area. Yet the outstanding opulence of residences like John Beswicke&#x27;s Rotha in Harcourt Street was still the preserve of a minority. By the 1880s working-class families lived in single-fronted, wood-blocked cottages on low-lying subdivisions like those forming Melville, Smart, Barton and Connell streets. Many worked in Hawthorn&#x27;s clay brickworks found principally in Auburn, east of the village and around the lower parts of Gardiners Creek. Hawthorn bricks referred to as &#x27;pinks&#x27;, &#x27;blacks&#x27; and &#x27;browns&#x27; adorned the polychromatic façades of many local houses. During the depression, residential sections of Hawthorn were equally as run-down as those in determinedly working-class Richmond across the Yarra River.

====Grace Park Estate====
Grace Park Estate, Hawthorn is located on a gently-sloping site in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne and contains a residential subdivision to the north and public gardens and sporting facilities to the south. The residential portion of the estate contains three curved crescents, intersecting streets and Mary Street as the northern boundary. Streets are tree-lined and contain a fine collection of Victorian and Edwardian houses. A curved portion of open land runs through the estate, once the site of the Kew railway line.

Grace Park Estate, Hawthorn, consists of the roadways and public open space within the boundaries of Glenferrie Road, the Melbourne-Lilydale railway reserve, Power Street and the laneway between Mary Street and Kinkora Road; excluding land associated with the Glenferrie Oval Grandstand which is already listed in the Victorian Heritage Register as H0890. This site is part of the traditional land of the Kulin nation.

One of the most significant properties in Hawthorn, the original Grace Park house was constructed by Michael Lynch in 1858 on a massive parcel of 38 hectares (95 acres) bounded by Power Street to the west, Barkers Road to the north, Glenferrie Road to the east and down to Burwood Road in the south (where the original entrance drive was located). The house originally comprised 8 rooms but had grown to 18 by 1870 and after Lynch&#x27;s death was occupied by Mrs Robert Colvin Clark&#x27;s Ladies College in 1874. The Estate was subdivided in 1884 into the magnificent Grace Park Estate and lots were sold into the early twentieth century giving rise to its superb Victorian and Edwardian character.

The 1884 Grace Park subdivision, which forms the boundaries of this nomination, was not completely realised. Instead areas to the south were unsold and acquired by the Hawthorn City Council and developed for public purposes in the twentieth century. The residential section to the north of the precinct retains the main pattern of gently curving crescents and perpendicular roads. Bluestone laneways remain largely intact and street trees have generally been replanted from the 1920s onwards. The bisecting of the residential estate by the Kew railway line had a large impact on development, necessitating the insertion of a cutting and the construction of bridges to enable the continuation of the crescents. The subsequent removal of this has left a wide reserve and altered the crescent pattern with the continuation of Hilda Crescent along the former railway reserve.

===Demographics===
In the 2021 Census, Hawthorn recorded a population of 22,322 people, 51.7% female and 48.3% male. The median age recorded during this census period was 34, 4 years below the national median of 38. 67.9% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were India 3.5%, England 3.1%, China (excludes SARs and Taiwan) 3.1%, New Zealand 1.7% and Malaysia 1.6%. 75.3% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were Mandarin 4.2%, Greek 1.6%, Vietnamese 1.3%, Cantonese 1.4% and Spanish 1.0%.

===Localities===
====Glenferrie====
Glenferrie ( ) is a part of Hawthorn centred around the Glenferrie shopping strip and civic precinct. It was formerly known as Upper Hawthorn but eventually took its new name from Glenferrie Road.

===Landmarks===
====Hawthorn Arts Centre====
The Hawthorn Town Hall building was designed by John Beswicke, and opened with a grand ball in October 1889. In 1911, architect John Koch designed extensions and renovations, with a balcony in the hall, new decorations and a clock in the tower. In 1930 Stuart Calder designed additions–a new Council chamber, new upper foyer and entrance portico. Weekly dances (Saturday nights), debutante balls, concerts, wedding receptions, soup kitchens, immunisation programmes and more recently craft markets are just some of the activities which have taken place in the beautiful ballroom of Hawthorn Town Hall. Over 2012–2013 the Hawthorn Town Hall underwent a $17.9 million refurbishment as a key Boroondara Arts and Cultural facility, with new amenities, including meeting rooms, new art galleries, a gallery commercial area, exhibition and workshop spaces and a café. It was reopened in late 2013 as the Hawthorn Arts Centre.

====Governor Hotham Hotel====
One of Hawthorn&#x27;s first hotels, it was constructed in 1855 and has been continuously operating for 157 years. Operated and owned by John Conran, the hotel was the site for many significant meetings that were instrumental in the development of Hawthorn. Important organisations such as the Boroondara District Road Board used it as a meeting place as they were responsible for the development of roads in an area of 5180 hectares (20 square miles). Now known as &quot;The Hawthorn&quot;.

===Parks and gardens===
The suburb has a number of public recreation areas and the suburb is noted for the number, size and quality of its parks, many of which still retain layouts that were first made in the 19th century. Hawthorn was originally a brick-making area and many of its parks are on the sites of former quarries, which were filled-in by them becoming tips and then parkland.

==Economy==
Glenferrie Road is a major shopping strip, with two supermarkets, major banks and many chain and specialty stores. There are also shopping centres at the corner of Burwood Road and Power Street, in Church Street, along Auburn Road (the western side of which is within the Hawthorn postcode, while the eastern side is in Hawthorn East), the corner of Glenferrie Road and Riversdale Road, and the corner of Auburn Road and Riversdale Road.

Hawthorn is particularly noted for the number, range and quality of its restaurants, many of which reflect the strong ethnic diversity of the region. There are also many nightclubs and hotels in the suburb.

Although mainly referred to as a residential region, there is some industry in the area, particularly in Burwood Road, between Power Street and Auburn Road.

Amcor and Orora are among the companies based in Hawthorn.

==Education==

Hawthorn is home to Swinburne University of Technology, which offers university and TAFE courses.

The suburb is also home to a number of private schools such as Erasmus Primary School, Saint Joseph&#x27;s Primary School, Rossbourne School and Scotch College.

The area falls within the zones of multiple private schools in Camberwell, Malvern and Hawthorn East, including Alia College, De La Salle College and Bialik College, as well as those in Kew and Canterbury, such as Xavier College, Carey Baptist Grammar School, Methodist Ladies&#x27; College, Ruyton Girls&#x27; School, Genazzano FCJ College, Camberwell Grammar School, Camberwell Girls Grammar School and Trinity Grammar School.

The suburb also contains several state-run schools, including Glenferrie Primary School, Hawthorn West Primary School and Auburn High School. The area also gives access to state schools in nearby Hawthorn East: Hawthorn Secondary College, Auburn Primary School and Auburn South Primary School.

In the 12-month period to January 2020 Hawthorn reported a median house price of A$1.76 million for a three bedroom house.

==Government==
The City of Boroondara retains offices in the former Hawthorn Town Hall, in Burwood Road (near the corner of Glenferrie Road). This building is noted as a good example of late 19th Century public-building architecture. Boroondara City Council, Swinburne University and many other organisations maintain many important facilities within the city. 

==Transport==
Hawthorn is serviced by two railway stations: Hawthorn and Glenferrie. It is also served by tram routes 16, 48, 70, 72, 75 and 109.

The former Kew railway line originally cut through the Grace Park Estate in 1887 and the Barker railway station was on the northern boundary. The old train route is still easily discernible by the tract of parkland that gently curves through the streets.

==Sport==

The suburb is the spiritual home of the Hawthorn Football Club of the AFL. It is also home to the Hawthorn Citizens, a junior Australian rules football team who compete in the Yarra Junior Football League.

Old Scotch Soccer Club are located at HA Smith Reserve and compete in the Victorian State League Division 2.

There is a Cricket Club, the Hawthorn Cricket Club and as well as a Hockey Club, the Hawthorn Hockey Club in the suburb.

The suburb also contains two tennis clubs, the Grace Park Tennis Club and the Hawthorn Tennis Club.

Fritsch Holzer Park is a large open space, popular for recreational activities and named after Augustus Fritsch and the Holzer brothers, who formed the Upper Hawthorn Brick Company on this site in 1883. The former Hawthorn Council purchased the site in 1972 and used it as a landfill site until 1986, then a temporary waste transfer station until 1989. In 1995 a project was launched to reconstruct this area into a park. Anderson Park is another significant park in the area and offers panoramic views of the Melbourne CBD. Other parks of note include Cato Park (part of the original property of Frederick Cato) and Victoria Road Reserve.

The head office of Coles (one of Australia&#x27;s biggest companies &amp; second largest supermarket) is located in Hawthorn East, adjacent to Toorak Rd. The Coles Myer group which was acquired by Western Australia conglomerate Wesfarmers in 2007 (site opened in 1987) was the original purpose for the site, which was the former Toorak Drive-In Theatre.

<text>Kew () is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, found 5 km east from Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District. Kew is located within the City of Boroondara local government area. Kew recorded a population of 24,499 at the 2021 census.

A city in its own right from 1860 to 1994, Kew was amalgamated with the cities of Hawthorn and Camberwell to form the City of Boroondara. The suburb borders the Yarra River to the west and northwest, with Kew East to the northeast, Hawthorn and Hawthorn East to its south, and with Balwyn, Balwyn North and Deepdene to the east.

==History==

Prior to the establishment of Melbourne, the area was inhabited by the Wurundjeri peoples. In the 1840s European settlers named it the Parish of &quot;Boroondara&quot; – meaning &quot;a place of shade&quot; in the Woiwurrung language. In 1838 Dight travelled down the Yarra from Heidelberg and decided to locate a water-powered mill on a site adjacent to Dights Falls; the impressive three-storey mill opened in 1840.

John Hodgson established a squatters run at Studley Park, on the eastern bank of the Yarra River, in 1840. &quot;Studley House&quot;, also known as &quot;Burke Hall&quot;, built in 1857, was named after Hodgson&#x27;s birthplace of Studley, Yorkshire and the house is now on the Register of the National Estate. The house was built in the Victorian Period Italianate Revival style. Modifications were made to the house in 1875 and 1919. The house was also owned by former bookmaker, ALP lobbyist, influential Irish-Catholic and millionaire, John Wren and was donated to Xavier College by the land developer, Thomas Burke. It illustrates the importance of a residence in indicating success and status in nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Melbourne society. The nearby &quot;Villa Alba&quot;, built before 1863, is open to the public.

In 1851, Crown land sales occurred in the area. One of the purchasers, Nicholas Fenwick, subdivided his land (which was just further out from the centre of the colony of Melbourne than the area known as Richmond) and named the region Kew, based on the thought that Kew in England was near Richmond. He also notably named its streets after British statesmen. The area quickly became a sought-after suburb for the well-to-do in Melbourne. Access to Kew was originally via Bridge Road in Richmond, crossing the Hawthorn Bridge to Burwood Road, until the privately owned Studley Park Bridge (nicknamed the &quot;Penny Bridge&quot;) opened in 1857, connecting Church Street Richmond with Studley Park.

The commercial precinct known as Kew Junction began to take shape in the 1850s. The first store was opened by Mr. J. J. French in August 1853 and the first post office on 6 October 1856, however, it was not till towards the end of the decade that many shops appeared in High Street. The Kew Hotel opened in 1855, the Prospect Hill Hotel (now the Dan Murphy&#x27;s liquor store) in 1857, the Council Hotel about 1860, the Clifton (now Hotel Kew) in 1869 and the Greyhound (now the Skinny Dog Hotel) in 1874. The block of civic buildings comprising the former post office, the former court house and the former police station were built in 1888 as was the National Bank, at the corner of Walpole and High Streets.

In 1856, a site was reserved for a mental asylum next to the river. By 1871 Kew Lunatic Asylum, now known as Willsmere Estate, was completed. The Kew Cottages for children were added in 1887. The hospital was built despite objections by residents and the Kew Borough Council and provides an historical example of nimbyism. Kew Cottages and Willsmere Hospital are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.

Various churches opened in the 1850s, with the first school opened by the Anglican Church in 1856. In 1875 Sacred Heart Primary School was opened. More private schools were opened in 1878, including Ruyton Girls&#x27; School (non-denominational) and Xavier College (Catholic in Jesuit order). Other private schools soon followed, including Methodist Ladies&#x27; College (Uniting Church in Australia) in 1882, Genazzano FCJ College in 1889, Trinity Grammar School (Anglican) in 1903, and Carey Baptist Grammar School (Baptist) in 1923. Preshil, The Margaret Lyttle Memorial School, was opened in the early 1930s. In 1960 it was said: &quot;it would be difficult to find any locality so richly endowed with so many and such large educational institutions as are to be found in Kew.&quot;

A railway branch line to Kew from Hawthorn Station opened on 19 December 1887 and was officially closed on 13 May 1957. Kew was proclaimed a town on 8 December 1910, and a city on 10 March 1921. The population of the area tripled between 1910 and World War II.

A former house in Kew was the birthplace of the 21st Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam. As of 2016, due to its demolition, the house no longer exists.

===Raheen===
Raheen is a historic 19th-century Italianate mansion, located at 92 Studley Park Road. It was built in the 1870s, and its name means &quot;little fort&quot; in Irish.

Raheen was once the residence of Daniel Mannix, the former Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne and was purchased by the Catholic Church in 1917 with support from John Wren.

It was purchased in 1980 by the Australian businessman Richard Pratt and his family and is not currently open to the public. Pratt extensively renovated the house and gardens, including the addition of a new wing, designed by Glen Murcutt.

===Today===
Kew has grown steadily since the early Bridge Road crossing development and is cited as one of the most prestigious suburbs in Melbourne. As a consequence, many of these residences now attract some of the highest residential resale values in Melbourne.

Streets in the Sackville Ward (bounded by Barkers, Burke, Cotham and Glenferrie Roads), such as Alfred, Rowland, Wellington, Grange and Sackville, have some exceptional examples of Edwardian, Victorian and contemporary architecture.

The suburb has been home to numerous Scout Groups since 1st Kew was formed in 1909. Today, only 1st Kew and 4th Kew are in operation.

Kew has convenient access to public facilities and transport. The 109, 16 and 72 along with tram route 48 (North Balwyn – Victoria Harbour Docklands) tram routes pass through the suburb and the City/Lilydale/Belgrave train line is easily accessed at Hawthorn and Glenferrie Stations. Kew Station and the associated railway branch was last served by passenger trains in 1952, with the station site now the headquarters of VicRoads.

<text>Kew East, also known as East Kew, is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, east from the Melbourne central business district, located within the City of Boroondara local government area. Kew East recorded a population of 6,620 at the 2021 census.

The suburb was developed as a series of small farming estates and communities. It expanded rapidly with the development of tramways and railways, including the now-closed Outer Circle railway line which had a station in Kew East. Today it is a mostly residential suburb with some small remnants of its agricultural past.

==History==
===Pre-European settlement===
The formally recognised traditional owners for the area in which Balwyn North is located are the Wurundjeri people. They are represented by the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung Cultural Heritage Aboriginal Corporation.

===19th century===
A number of farming properties were established along the Yarra River following government land auctions, between 1845 and 1847.

The Wills family established &quot;Willsmere Estate&quot;, a grazing and dairying property, with the name now reflected in Willsmere Road and Willsmere Park.

William Wade established a farm, named &quot;Belford&quot;, next door. A flood in December 1863 devastated the property, which later became the Kew Golf Course.

The Harp of Erin Hotel, on the corner of Harp Road and High Street, was established in 1854, by Edward Glynn. It was a centre for race meetings and gave its name to Harp Road, which was part of a route to Lilydale, used by Cobb &amp; Co.

===20th century===
Kew East Post Office opened around 1924.

The East Kew Maternal and Child Health Centre, in Strathalbyn Street, Kew East, is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. Opened in December 1925, it is the earliest purpose-built and intact baby health centre in the state. 

===21st century===
The notorious 2020 Eastern Freeway truck crash, which received national news coverage, occurred in the suburb.

===Street names===
Windella Road was originally named Balfour Road, after Kew resident and politician James Balfour. It was renamed to Windella Avenue, after Balfour&#x27;s residence Windella, due to the similarity of the former name to that of nearby Belford Road. Longstaff, Leason, McCubbin, Newbury, Frater and Lister Streets are all named after Australian painters.

==Geography==
The suburb is bounded to the east by Burke Road, to the north by the Yarra River and to the west by the Yarra River, parts of Kilby and Willsmere Roads and the property boundaries between Willsmere Road and Rattan Avenue. The southern boundary follows Carnegie Avenue, Park Crescent, Earl Street, Asquith Street, property boundaries near Belford Road (south), High Street and Harp Road. The Eastern Freeway runs across the centre of the suburb from east to west.

===Demographics===
As of 2016, 68.2% of residents were born in Australia, 4.3% were born in China, 2.4% in England, 2.1% in Italy and 23% were born elsewhere.

==Economy==
The main shopping area, &quot;Harp Village&quot;, is located on High Street, near the intersection with Harp Road. A small local centre, Belford Court Shopping Centre, is located on Belford Road.

==Transport==

===Road===
The Eastern Freeway is accessible via the Chandler Highway or Burke Road. The Main Yarra Trail, a shared bicycle and pedestrian path, runs along the north side of the freeway. Belford Road bridges the freeway, providing a link to the northern part of the suburb. 

===Public transport===
The suburb has a tram line along High Street, which is served by route 48. There are also a number of CDC Melbourne and Kinetic Melbourne bus routes which connect the suburb to surrounding areas.

==Education==
===Schools===
There are two co-educational government schools located in Kew East — Kew High School, a secondary college located on Burke Road and Kew East Primary School on Kitchener Street. St Annes Catholic School is located on Beresford Street.

==Sports==

Kew Golf Club and Green Acres Golf Club on Elm Grove are located in the north of the suburb. Parks in Kew East include Willsmere-Chandler Park, home of one of the suburb&#x27;s three soccer clubs, East Kew United Soccer club, and the adjacent Kew Billabong, Hays Paddock on Glass Creek, is home to the Old Xaverians Soccer Club, and Kew Deaf Soccer Club. Hyde Park, Harrison Park and Stradbroke Park are located in the south-east of the suburb.

==Places of worship==
Places of worship include:
*St Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church, located on the corner of Windella Avenue and Hale Street.
*East Kew Uniting Church, Normanby Road.
*MWP Centre, Westbrook Street.
*St Anne&#x27;s Catholic Church, Windellla Avenue.

<doc id="581997" wikidata="Q485796" url="?curid=581997" title="Pilaf">
<text>Pilaf (), pilav or pilau () is a rice dish, or in some regions, a wheat dish, whose recipe usually involves cooking in stock or broth, adding spices, and other ingredients such as vegetables or meat, and employing some technique for achieving cooked grains that do not adhere.

At the time of the Abbasid Caliphate, such methods of cooking rice at first spread through a vast territory from South Asia to Spain, and eventually to a wider world. The Spanish &quot;paella&quot;, and the South Asian &quot;pilau&quot; or &quot;pulao&quot;, and &quot;biryani&quot;, evolved from such dishes.

Pilaf and similar dishes are common to Middle Eastern, West Asian, Balkan, Caribbean, South Caucasian, Central Asian, East African, Eastern European, Latin American, Maritime Southeast Asia, and South Asian cuisines; in these areas, they are regarded as staple dishes.

==Etymology==
According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, Third Edition (2006) the English word &quot;pilaf&quot;, which is the later and North American English form, is a borrowing from Turkish, its etymon, or linguistic ancestor, the Turkish , whose etymon is the Persian ; &quot;pilaf&quot; is found more commonly in North American dictionaries than &quot;pilau&quot;, all from the Persian .

The British and Commonwealth English spelling, &quot;pilau&quot;, has etymon Persian (in form &quot;palāv&quot;, &quot;pilāv&quot;, or &quot;pulāv&quot; in the 16th century) and Urdu (&quot;dish of rice and meat&quot;), from Persian &quot;pulāv&quot; (&quot;Side dishes, spices, meat, vegetables, even plain rice &quot;), the Tamil Pulukku (&quot;Dravidian (compare Tamil puḷukku (adjective) simmered, (noun) boiled or parboiled food, &quot;puḷukkal&quot; cooked rice); in turn probably from Sanskrit (&quot;ball of rice&quot;).

==History==

Although the cultivation of rice had spread much earlier from India to Central and West Asia, it was at the time of the Abbasid Caliphate that methods of cooking rice which approximate modern styles of cooking pilaf at first spread through a vast territory from Spain to Afghanistan, and eventually to a wider world. The Spanish &quot;paella&quot;, and the South Asian &quot;pilau&quot; or &quot;pulao&quot;, and &quot;biryani&quot;, evolved from such dishes.

According to author K. T. Achaya, the Indian epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot; mentions an instance of rice and meat cooked together. Also, according to Achaya, &quot;pulao&quot; or &quot;pallao&quot; is used to refer to a rice dish in ancient Sanskrit works such as the &quot;Yājñavalkya Smṛti&quot;. However, according to food writers Colleen Taylor Sen and Charles Perry, and social theorist Ashis Nandy, these references do not substantially correlate to the commonly used meaning and history implied in pilafs, which appear in Indian accounts after the medieval Central Asian conquests.

Similarly Alexander the Great and his army, many centuries earlier, in the 4th century BCE, have been reported to be so impressed with Bactrian and Sogdian &quot;pilavs&quot; that his soldiers brought the recipes back to Macedonia when they returned. Similar stories exist of Alexander introducing pilaf to Samarkand; however, they are considered apocryphal by art historian John Boardman. Similarly, it has been reported that pilaf was consumed in the Byzantine Empire and in the Republic of Venice.

The earliest documented recipe for pilaf comes from the tenth-century Persian scholar Avicenna (Ibn Sīnā), who in his books on medical sciences dedicated a whole section to preparing various dishes, including several types of pilaf. In doing so, he described the advantages and disadvantages of every item used for preparing the dish. Accordingly, Persians consider Ibn Sina to be the &quot;father&quot; of modern pilaf. Thirteenth-century Arab texts describe the consistency of pilaf that the grains should be plump and somewhat firm to resemble peppercorns with no mushiness, and each grain should be separate with no clumping.

Another primary source for pilaf dishes comes from the 17th-century Iranian philosopher Molla Sadra.

Pilau became standard fare in the Middle East and Transcaucasia over the years with variations and innovations by the Persians, Arabs, Turks, and Armenians.

During the period of the Soviet Union, the Central Asian versions of the dish spread throughout all Soviet republics, becoming a part of the common Soviet cuisine.

==Preparation==
Some cooks prefer to use basmati rice because it is easier to prepare a pilaf where the grains stay &quot;light, fluffy and separate&quot; with this type of rice. However, other types of long-grain rice are also used. The rice is rinsed thoroughly before use to remove the surface starch. Pilaf can be cooked in water or stock. Common additions include fried onions and fragrant spices like cardamom, bay leaves and cinnamon.

Pilaf is usually made with meat or vegetables, but it can also be made plain which is called &quot;sade pilav&quot; in Turkish, &quot;chelo&quot; in Persian and &quot;ruzz mufalfal&quot; in Arabic. On special occasions saffron may be used to give the rice a yellow color. Pilaf is often made by adding the rice to hot fat and stirring briefly before adding the cooking liquid. The fat used varies from recipe to recipe. Cooking methods vary with respect to details such as pre-soaking the rice and steaming after boiling.

==Local varieties==
There are thousands of variations of pilaf made with rice or other grains like bulgur. In Central Asia there are &quot;plov&quot;, &quot;pulao&quot; on the Indian subcontinent, and variations from Turkmenistan and Turkey. Some include different combinations of meats, fruits or vegetables, while others are simple and served plain. Central Asian, South Asian cuisine, Turkish cuisine, Iranian and Caribbean cuisine are some with distinctive styles of making pilaf.

=== Afghanistan ===
In Afghan cuisine, &quot;Kabuli palaw&quot; (Persian : کابلی پلو) is made by cooking basmati with mutton, lamb, beef or chicken, and oil. Kabuli palaw is cooked in large shallow and thick dishes. Fried sliced carrots and raisins are added. Chopped nuts like pistachios, walnuts, or almonds may be added as well. The meat is covered by the rice or buried in the middle of the dish. Kabuli palaw rice with carrots and raisins is very popular in Saudi Arabia, where it is known as &quot;roz Bukhari&quot; (Arabic: رز بخاري), meaning &#x27;Bukharan rice&#x27;.

=== Albania ===

In Albanian cuisine, pilaf is a very common dish. It is typically accompanied by yogurt and eaten with bean stew, meat soup or baked meats such as chicken and lamb. Medium-long grain rice is used, and it is cooked plainly with butter, resulting in a soft yet non-sticky texture.

There are various rice dishes in Albania, which are all commonly referred to as pilaf.

Albania ranks among the top three countries in Europe for rice consumption.
===Armenia===

Armenians use a lot of &quot;bulgur&quot; (&quot;cracked wheat&quot;) in their pilaf dishes. Armenian recipes may combine vermicelli or orzo with rice cooked in stock seasoned with mint, parsley and allspice. One traditional Armenian pilaf is made with the same noodle rice mixture cooked in stock with raisins, almonds and allspice.

Armenian kinds of rice are discussed by Rose Baboian in her cookbook from 1964 which includes recipes for different pilafs, most rooted in her birthplace of Antep in Turkey. Baboian recommends that the noodles be stir-fried first in chicken fat before being added to the pilaf. Another Armenian cookbook written by Vağinag Pürad recommends to render poultry fat in the oven with red pepper until the fat mixture turns a red color before using the strained fat to prepare pilaf.

&quot;Lapa&quot; is an Armenian word with several meanings one of which is a &quot;watery boiled rice, thick rice soup, mush&quot; and &quot;lepe&quot; which refers to various rice dishes differing by region. Antranig Azhderian describes Armenian pilaf as a &quot;dish resembling porridge&quot;.

=== Azerbaijan ===
Azerbaijani cuisine includes more than 40 different plov recipes. One of the most reputed dishes is plov from saffron-covered rice, served with various herbs and greens, a combination distinctive from Uzbek plovs. Traditional Azerbaijani plov consists of three distinct components, served simultaneously but on separate platters: rice (warm, never hot), &quot;gara&quot; (fried beef or chicken pieces with onion, chestnut and dried fruits prepared as an accompaniment to rice), and aromatic herbs. Gara is put on the rice when eating plov, but it is never mixed with rice and the other components. Pilaf is usually called aş in Azerbaijani cuisine.
=== Bangladesh ===
In Bangladesh, &quot;pulao&quot; (), &quot;fulao&quot;, or &quot;holao&quot;, is a popular ceremonial dish cooked only with aromatic rice. Bangladesh cultivates many varieties of aromatic rice which can be found only in this country and some surrounding Indian states with predominantly Bengali populations. Historically, there were many varieties of aromatic rice. These included short grained rice with buttery and other fragrances depending on the variety. Over a long span of time many recipes were lost and then reinvented.

Since the 1970s in Bangladesh &quot;pulao&quot; has referred to aromatic rice () &quot;Bashonti polao&quot;, first fried either in oil or clarified butter with onions, fresh ginger and whole aromatic spices such as cardamom, cinnamon, black pepper and more depending on each household and region. This is then cooked in stock or water, first boiled and then steamed. It is finished off with a bit more clarified butter, and fragrant essences such as rose water or kewra water. For presentation, beresta (fried onions) are sprinkled on top. Chicken &quot;pulao&quot;, (&quot;morog pulao&quot;), is a traditional ceremonial dish among the Bangladeshi Muslim community. There are several different types of &quot;morog pulao&quot; found only in particular regions or communities.

In Sylhet and Chittagong, a popular ceremonial dish called &quot;akhni pulao&quot;. &quot;Aqni&quot; being the rich stock in which mutton is cooked and then used to cook the rice. Another very spicy &quot;biryani&quot; dish very popular and unique to Bangladesh is called &quot;tehari&quot;. It is very different in taste to the &quot;teharis&quot; found in some parts of neighboring India. They are most popularly eaten with beef and &quot;chevon&quot; (goat meat) but are also paired with chicken. Young small potatoes, mustard oil (which is alternated with clarified butter or oil depending on individual taste), and a unique spice blend found in &quot;teharis&quot; distinguish them from other meat &quot;pulaos&quot;. The most famous &quot;tehari&quot; in the capital city of Dhaka is called &quot;Hajir biryani&quot;. Although here the name &quot;biryani&quot; is a misnomer, in usage among the urban young population it differentiates the popular dish mutton &quot;biryanis&quot; (goat meat).

=== Brazil ===
A significantly modified version of the recipe, often seen as influenced by what is called there, is known in Brazil as or (, &quot;shredded chicken rice&quot;; , &quot;chicken risotto&quot;). Rice lightly fried (and optionally seasoned), salted and cooked until soft (but neither soupy nor sticky) in either water or chicken stock is added to chicken stock, onions and sometimes cubed bell peppers (cooked in the stock), shredded chicken breast, green peas, tomato sauce, shoyu, and optionally vegetables (e.g. canned sweet corn, cooked carrot cubes, courgette cubes, broccolini flowers, chopped broccoli or broccolini stalks or leaves fried in garlic seasoning) or herbs (e.g., mint, like in ) to form a distantly risotto-like dish – but it is generally fluffy (depending on the texture of the rice being added), as generally, once all ingredients are mixed, it is not left to cook longer than five minutes. In the case shredded chicken breast is not added, with the rice being instead served alongside chicken and , it is known as (, &quot;chicken supreme rice&quot;).

=== Caribbean ===

In the Eastern Caribbean and other Caribbean territories there are variations of &quot;pelau&quot; which include a wide range of ingredients such as pigeon peas, green peas, green beans, corn, carrots, pumpkin, and meat such as beef or chicken, or cured pig tail. The seasoned meat is usually cooked in a stew, with the rice and other vegetables added afterwards. Coconut milk and spices are also key additions in some islands.

Trinidad is recognized for its &quot;pelau&quot;, a layered rice with meats and vegetables. It is a mix of traditional African cuisine and &quot;New World&quot; ingredients like ketchup. The process of browning the meat (usually chicken, but also stew beef or lamb) in sugar is an African technique.

In Tobago, &quot;pelau&quot; is commonly made with crab.

=== Central Asia ===
Central Asian, e.g. Uzbek, Kyrgyz and Tajik (, , ) Kazakh, Turkmen, Karakalpak () or &quot;osh&quot; differs from other preparations in that rice is not steamed, but instead simmered in a rich stew of meat and vegetables called &quot;zirvak&quot; (), until all the liquid is absorbed into the rice. A limited degree of steaming is commonly achieved by covering the pot. It is usually cooked in a &quot;kazon&quot; (or &quot;deghi&quot;) over an open fire. The cooking tradition includes many regional and occasional variations. Commonly, it is prepared with lamb or beef, browned in lamb fat or oil, and then stewed with fried onions, garlic and carrots. Chicken palov is rare but found in traditional recipes originating in Bukhara. Some regional varieties use distinct types of oil to cook the meat. For example, Samarkand-style plov commonly uses &quot;zig&#x27;ir&quot; oil, a mix of melon seed, cottonseed, sesame seed, and flaxseed oils. Plov is usually simply spiced with salt, peppercorns, and cumin, but coriander, barberries, red pepper, or marigold may be added according to regional variation or the chef&#x27;s preference. Heads of garlic and chickpeas are sometimes buried into the rice during cooking. Sweet variations with dried apricots, cranberries and raisins are prepared on special occasions.

Although often prepared at home, plov is made on special occasions by an &quot;oshpaz&quot; or &quot;ashpoz&quot; (osh/ash master chef), who cooks it over an open flame, sometimes serving up to 1,000 people from a single cauldron on holidays or occasions such as weddings. &quot;Oshi nahor&quot;, or &quot;morning palov&quot;, is served in the early morning (between 6 and 9 am) to large gatherings of guests, typically as part of an ongoing wedding celebration.

Uzbek-style plov is found in the post-Soviet countries and Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. In Xinjiang, where the dish is known as polu, it is often served with pickled vegetables, including carrots, onion and tomato.
=== Greece ===

In Greek cuisine, &quot;piláfi&quot; (πιλάφι) is fluffy and soft, but neither soupy nor sticky, rice that has been boiled in a meat stock or bouillon broth. In Northern Greece, it is considered improper to prepare &quot;piláfi&quot; on a stovetop; the pot is properly placed in the oven. &quot;Gamopílafo&quot; (&quot;wedding pilaf&quot;) is the prized pilaf served traditionally at weddings and major celebrations in Crete: rice is boiled in lamb or goat broth, then finished with lemon juice. Although it bears the name, &quot;Gamopílafo&quot; is not a pilaf but rather a kind of risotto, with a creamy and not fluffy texture.

=== India ===
&quot;Pulao&quot; is usually a mixture of either lentils or vegetables, mainly including peas, potatoes, green beans, carrots or meat, mainly chicken, fish, lamb, goat, pork or prawn with rice. A typical Bengali style pulao is prepared using vegetarian ingredients like Long grain rice or aromatic rice, cashewnut, raisin, saffron, ghee and various spices like nutmeg, bay leaf, cinnamon, cardamom, cumin, clove and mace. There are also a few very elaborate &quot;pulaos&quot; with Persian names like &quot;hazar pasand&quot; (&quot;a thousand delights&quot;). It is usually served on special occasions and weddings, though it is not uncommon to eat it for a regular lunch or dinner meal. It is considered very high in food energy and fat. A pulao is often complemented with either spiced yogurt or &quot;raita&quot;.
=== Iran ===

Persian culinary terms referring to rice preparation are numerous and have found their way into the neighbouring languages: &quot;polow&quot; (rice cooked in broth while the grains remain separate, straining the half cooked rice before adding the broth and then &quot;brewing&quot;), &quot;chelow&quot; (white rice with separate grains), &quot;kateh&quot; (sticky rice) and &quot;tahchin&quot; (slow cooked rice, vegetables, and meat cooked in a specially designed dish). There are also varieties of different rice dishes with vegetables and herbs which are very popular among Iranians.

There are four primary methods of cooking rice in Iran:
* &quot;Chelow&quot;: rice that is carefully prepared through soaking and parboiling, at which point the water is drained and the rice is steamed. This method results in an exceptionally fluffy rice with the grains separated and not sticky; it also results in a golden rice crust at the bottom of the pot called &quot;tahdig&quot; (literally &quot;bottom of the pot&quot;).
* &quot;Polow&quot;: rice that is cooked exactly the same as &quot;chelo&quot;, with the exception that after draining the rice, other ingredients are layered with the rice, and they are then steamed together.
* &quot;Kateh&quot;: rice that is boiled until the water is absorbed. This is the traditional dish of Northern Iran.
* &quot;Damy&quot;: cooked almost the same as &quot;kateh&quot;, except that the heat is reduced just before boiling and a towel is placed between the lid and the pot to prevent steam from escaping. &quot;Damy&quot; literally means &quot;simmered&quot;.

=== Pakistan ===
In Pakistan, &quot;pulao&quot; (), also romanized as &#x27;,&quot;&#x27; is a popular dish made with fragrant basmati rice cooked in a seasoned meat or bone broth. Typically non-spicy, it features tender pieces of meat, such as chicken, lamb, or beef, though vegetarian variations are also popular. As with Afghan cuisine, &quot;Kabuli pulav&quot; is a staple dish in Pakistan, especially in the western regions. This variation of pulav is often adorned with sliced carrots, almonds, and raisins fried in a sweet syrup, adding a unique touch of sweetness and texture to the dish.
Bannu Beef Pulao, also known as Bannu Gosht Pulao, is a traditional and popular variation of pulav recipe hailing from the Bannu district of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan. The dish is made with beef, basmati rice, and a blend of local spices, resulting in a flavor profile characteristic of the region. The beef is first cooked in a separate preparation known as Beef Yakhni, made using a combination of salt, ginger, garlic, onions, and garam masala. This broth enhances the flavor and ensures the meat is tender. The rice is then combined with the cooked beef, allowing the flavors to meld together. This delicacy is often served during special occasions and family dinners and is a staple of the Pashtun culinary tradition.

Pulao is popular in all parts of Pakistan, but the cooking style can vary slightly in other parts of the country. It is prepared by Sindhi people of Pakistan in their marriage ceremonies, condolence meetings, and other occasions.

===Romania===
Romanian style &quot;pilaf&quot; is often more watery in consistency, more akin to congee, and uses chicken breast meat along with chopped red peppers, onion, and carrot.

===Levant===
Traditional Levantine cooking includes a variety of Pilaf known as &quot;Maqlubeh&quot;, known across the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean. The rice pilaf which is traditionally cooked with meats, eggplants, tomatoes, potatoes, and cauliflower also has a fish variety known as &quot;Sayyadiyeh&quot;, or the Fishermen&#x27;s Dish.

===Turkey===

Historically, mutton stock was the most common cooking liquid for Turkish pilafs.

Turkish cuisine contains many different pilaf types. Some of these variations are &quot;pirinç&quot; (rice) pilaf, &quot;bulgur&quot; pilaf, and &quot;arpa şehriye&quot; (orzo) pilaf. Using mainly these three types, Turkish people make many dishes such as &quot;perdeli pilav&quot;, and &quot;etli pilav&quot; (rice cooked with cubed beef). Unlike Chinese rice, if Turkish rice is sticky, it is considered unsuccessful. To make the best rice according to Turkish people, one must rinse the rice, cook in butter, then add the water and let it sit until it soaks all the water. This results in a pilaf that is not sticky and every single rice grain falls off of the spoon separately.

===Baltics===
Lithuanian pilaf is often referred to as &quot;plovas&quot;. It tends to consist of rice and vegetables; depending on the region the vegetables can be tomatoes, carrots, cabbage, and/or mushrooms. It often contains chicken pieces or cut-up pieces of pork, usually the meat around the neck or the stomach; seasonings can be heavy or light, and some &quot;plovas&quot; might be made with rice that is very soft, unlike other variants.

Latvian pilaf is often referred to as &quot;plovs&quot; or &quot;plov&quot;. It tends to contain the same ingredients as the Lithuanian &quot;plovas&quot; and can vary from county to county.

The Greek Orthodox Pontian minority had their own methods of preparing pilav. Pontians along the Black Sea coast might make pilav with anchovies (called ) or mussels (called ). Other varieties of Pontian pilav could include chicken, lamb, and vegetables. Typical seasonings are anise, dill, parsley, salt, pepper, and saffron. Some Pontians cooked pine nuts, peanuts, or almonds into their pilav. While pilav was usually made from rice, it could also be made with buckwheat.

===Crimea===

Traditional Crimean Tatar pilyav (pilâv) is prepared from rice; meat, onions, or raisins can be added.
