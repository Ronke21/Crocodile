<text>Synchronized skating, often called synchro, is an ice skating sport where between 8 and 20 skaters perform together as a team. They move as a flowing unit at high speed over the ice, while performing elements and footwork.

This complex sport originated in 1956 and was initially called &quot;precision skating&quot; due to its emphasis on the maintenance of intricate and precise formations and the requirement of precise timing from all members of the group. Synchronized skating is now well-established as an organized sport in several European countries with several of them having produced teams who frequently win championships at the international level. As of 2022, there are more than 600 synchro teams in United States alone.

==Details==
Synchronized skating currently uses a judging format similar to singles, pairs and ice dancing. The discipline is primarily judged on skating skills, transitions, performance, composition, interpretation and difficulty of elements.

A synchronized skating free skate program consists of elements that are executed in various shapes and formations both connected and disconnected, such as blocks, triangles, circles, lines, or wheels, done while intersecting, traveling across the ice, and rotating. Teams are required to perform turns and step sequences, ranging in difficulty with each level.

There are many different levels including Pre-Preliminary, Preliminary, Beginner, Pre-juvenile, Open juvenile, Intermediate, Novice, Junior, Senior, and Adult. In the highest-ranking levels, Junior and Senior division teams are required to perform a short program in addition to the free skate. The short program is more technical in nature, whereas the free skating program is longer and provides an opportunity to showcase expression, emotion and interpretation.

Junior level teams compete in the Junior World Synchronized Skating Championships. At the senior level, teams compete at the World Synchronized Skating Championship. All member nations of the ISU are allocated one entry for each level, countries that placed in the top five of the previous championship are awarded two team entries.

The required elements must be performed in specific ways, as described by published communications by the ISU, unless otherwise specified. The ISU publishes violations and their points values yearly. Situations warranting deductions in synchronized skating include elements where one-quarter of the team or more fails to execute a maneuver in congruence with the majority of the team, falls, interruptions, illegal maneuvers (such as cartwheels), and violations of the rules concerning time, music, and clothing.

== History ==
In 1956, the first synchronized skating team was formed by Dr. Richard Porter. The &#x27;Hockettes&#x27; skated out of Ann Arbor, Michigan and entertained spectators during intermissions of the University of Michigan Wolverines hockey team. In the early days, precision skating (as it was then called) resembled a drill team routine, or a precision dance company such as The Rockettes. In 1974, the ISU published the first judges&#x27; handbook for synchronized skating.

During the 1970s, the interest for this new sport grew and developed. Teams developed more creative and innovative routines incorporating stronger basic skating skills, new maneuvers and more sophisticated transitions with greater speed, style and agility. Due to the increased interest in the sport in North America, the first official international competition was held between Canadian and American teams in Michigan in March 1976. With the internationalization of the sport, it has evolved, with increasing emphasis on speed and skating skills, and &quot;highlight&quot; elements such as jumps, spirals, spins, and lifts that originally were not permitted in competition.

== Elements and formations ==
Competition programs include a variety of elements utilizing various shapes or formations. Scoring of each element is determined by their base value (BV) and grade of execution (GOE), together this determines the teams technical element score (TES). In competition the technical panel identifies elements as each element is performed, elements are then assigned a level of difficulty ranging from B (basic) to Level 4 (most difficult). Element shapes are a set of distinct configurations that are easily identifiable, these shapes are used as the basis of most synchronized skating elements.

=== Formations ===
Certain elements are composed of specific distinctive shapes or formations, occasionally transitioning from one shape to a different shape for a higher level of difficulty.

==== Block ====
Identifiable by skaters lined up in at least three separate lines forming a polygonal shape, characterized as block, pyramid or diamond shapes in straight even spaced lines. The shapes can be closed or open formation, with open formations maintaining distinct empty space in the middle of the formation.

==== Circle ====

Characterized by rotating around a common center with even distance from the midpoint and spacing from teammates, circles can be connected or disconnected. different circle configurations include multiple circles, circle within a circle, and interlocking. To increase the level of difficulty a circle can include changes of place, or configuration, step sequences, weaving, interlocking, and changes of rotational direction.

==== Line ====

Lines are integral to many elements and transitions as they demonstrate the team&#x27;s collective skating skills and serve as building blocks for both blocks and wheel formations. Lines can be connected and disconnected.

==== Wheel ====

A wheel is characterized by every skater rotating around a common center point in connected lines. Different formations that teams can form including a two to five spoke or a parallel wheel. Each spoke (line) of the wheel should be straight and the team should be leaning into the center of the wheel. The difficulty of the wheel can be increased by adding footwork, changing the rotational direction of the wheel, configuration of the wheel.

=== Elements ===
Programs incorporate a set number of specific elements that is announced at the beginning of each season. Currently junior and senior teams both complete 5 elements in the short program, in the free skate junior teams attempt 8 elements, and senior teams attempt 10.

==== Artistic Element ====
Done in ether a circle/wheel formation, or a line/block formation, this element should be used to emphasize the music or theme of the program with no requirements for steps or changes of place.

==== Creative Element ====
Selected each season, the creative element is intended to be a unique interpretation of the other defined elements or formations (e.g.: creative wheel, creative lift)

==== Group Lift Element ====

Incorporating all members of the team, skaters form different groups with each lifted skater supported by two or more teammates at any height. Group lifts can be classified as being ether gliding or rotational, with rotational lifts starting gliding then having the supporting skaters switch between forwards and backwards gliding to rotate the lifted skater.

==== Intersection Element ====

An intersection, is when the skaters proceed towards each other in lines and intersect. The intersection can consist of two to four lines, with three and four line intersections forming a triangle or box shape before and after intersecting. The entry to the intersection can be made more difficult by executing various free skating or pair movements while forming the lines, or intersecting from an angle or a whip. The moment when the lines intersect is known as the point of intersection, here skaters do rotational turns or free skating movements to increase the level of difficulty.

==== Mixed Element ====
Consisting of at least two separate element formations occurring simultaneously and interacting with each other. Some examples would be a circle within a wheel or line intersecting a block.

==== Move Element ====
This element is a sequence of movements that must include free skating moves such as spirals, biellmanns, or 180&#x27;s. The team can be split into units to execute additional features for levels of difficulty, such as ducking under each other&#x27;s legs, changing edge, or transitioning from one position to another.

==== No Hold Element ====

Done in a block formation, the skaters are disconnected but maintain even spacing while executing step sequences and changes of configuration.

==== Pair Element ====

Incorporating all members of the team, skaters are paired to execute pairs moves, free skating moves, and or step sequences.

==== Pivoting and Linear Elements ====
Done in block, or line formations, programs can include both pivoting and linear elements though they would be done in separate shapes. Pivoting elements rotate around a common center point and must remain connected for the majority of the element while maintaining shape and even spacing. Linear elements need to progress across the ice, and can utilize changes of placement and configuration.

==== Synchronized Spin Element ====
Characterized by all members of the team, in ether a solo or pairs spin. Positioned on the ice in any identifiable shape, with all skaters maintaining the same spin position simultaneously, and moving from one position to another as a team.

==== Traveling and Rotating Elements ====
Done in circle, or wheel formation, rotation is necessary in both elements. Programs can include both traveling and rotating elements though they would be done in separate shapes, if a program only includes one element both wheel and circle formations can be used as a change of formation for difficulty. Traveling elements are characterized by ice coverage during the element with the circle or wheel required to continually move a certain distance along a set path while rotating. Rotating elements remain stationary. Both elements can utilize changes of position, rotation, and configuration for higher levels of difficulty.

==== Twizzle Element ====
Highlighting the twizzle turn, the team executes two to three twizzles, this element can be done in any identifiable formation. The skaters must execute their twizzles while maintaining the chosen shape or transitioning from one configuration to another, and rotating simultaneously. For added levels of difficulty teams can attempt the aforementioned change of place or configuration, different rotational directions for each twizzle, and certain difficult arm and free leg positions.

==Competitions==

===International===
There are international synchronized skating competitions at the Senior, Junior, and Novice levels (with Senior being the most elite). The International Skating Union held the first official World Synchronized Skating Championships (WSSC) in 2000 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. The top Junior teams from around the world competed from 2001 to 2012 at the ISU Junior World Challenge Cup (JWCC), held in a different location every year. The JWCC were accompanied in 2013 by the ISU World Junior Synchronized Skating Championships, to be held biannually in odd-numbered years with the JWCC in even-numbered years. Other long-running, major international events attracting elite teams at different levels include the French Cup, Spring Cup, Neuchâtel Trophy, Cup of Berlin, Zagreb Snowflakes Trophy, Leon Lurje Trophy and Prague Cup.

====ISU World Synchronized Skating Championships====
The ISU World Synchronized Skating Championships (WSSC) are the world championships for synchronized skating. Held since 2000, the WSSC is an annual international event organized by the International Skating Union. The top positions have been dominated by Finland, with three different World Champions (Marigold IceUnity, Rockettes and Team Unique) and 19 medals, and Sweden with the team (Team Surprise) with most World titles and medals for a single team (12 medals). Other major countries include Canada with five gold, four silvers and six bronzes (for NEXXICE, Les Suprêmes and the now-discontinued Black Ice), as well as the United States with two silvers and five bronzes (for Miami University and Haydenettes).

====ISU World Junior Synchronized Skating Championships====

====ISU Junior World Challenge Cup====
The Junior World Challenge Cup was held bi-annually starting in 2013 alternating with the newly introduced World Junior Championships until being discontinued after the 2015-16 season. 
===Finland===
The Finnish member of ISU, the Finnish Figure Skating Association, holds the Finnish Synchronized Skating Championships at the Novice, Junior and Senior levels. Also, it holds two Finnish Championships Qualifiers before the nationals. Since the late 1990s, the senior-level battle for the qualifier wins and Finnish Championship—and the ensuing ISU World Synchronized Skating Championships (WSSC) entries—has mainly been fought between three teams from Helsinki, Marigold IceUnity, Rockettes and Team Unique, while a fourth and sometimes a fifth Senior team has competed along in the intervening years.

====Finnish Senior Championships medalists====
====Finnish qualifications for the ISU WSSC====
Throughout the years, the Finnish senior teams qualifying for the World Championships have been selected based on their performance at the two qualifiers and the national championships. In the season 2012–13, the teams were selected as follows: the Finnish Champion qualified automatically as Team Finland 1 for the WSSC. Team Finland 2 at the WSSC was the team which earned the fewest points from the first qualifier, the second qualifier and the Finnish Championships. The points equaled the sum of the positions at the three competitions with growing coefficients: the coefficient was 0,3 for the first competition result, 0,5 for the second and 1 for the last.

===United States===
In the United States, there are several other recognized age and skill levels. Sanctioned by the US Figure Skating Association, the divisions include Beginner, Pre-Juvenile, Preliminary, Open Juvenile, Open Collegiate, and Open Adult (the non-qualifying divisions/ the divisions that do not go to Nationals) and Juvenile, Intermediate, Novice, Junior, Senior, Collegiate, Adult, and Masters (qualifying levels).

ISI (Ice Skating Institute) is another governing body which focuses on a more recreational form of competition and does not have the same divisions as those of the USFSA. Teams can compete in the Tot Jr. Youth, Youth Sr. Youth, Teen, Collegiate, Adult, or Master age groups, in any of five categories: Formation, Advanced Formation, Skating, Open Skating, and Dance.

While most skaters participating in synchronized skating are female, the rules allow mixed-gender teams.

====US Figure Skating Senior Championship====

The Senior team level consists of 16 skaters. Skaters must be at least 15 years old and have passed the Novice Moves in the Field test.

====USFSA Collegiate Championship====
The Collegiate team level consists of teams with 12-20 Figure skaters who must be enrolled in a college or degree program as full-time students. Skaters must also have passed the Juvenile Moves in the Field test. It is a Varsity Sport at colleges such as Miami University and Adrian College. Many more have developed club-level collegiate teams without varsity status such as the team at The University of Delaware and the University of Michigan. The Miami University Synchronized Skating Team has been a trailblazer in collegiate synchronized skating, fielding the first completely funded varsity synchronized skating program in the United States, as well as working towards gaining &quot;Synchro&quot; NCAA status in the United States.

===Canada===
The Canadian Synchronized Skating Championships were annual synchronized skating events, sanctioned by the Skate Canada, held to determine the national champions of Canada. They were first held in 1983. Since 2000, it is during these events that the senior teams can qualify for the ISU World Synchronized Skating Championships. Since 2023, the Junior and Senior level teams are competing in the combined synchronized and figure skating championships, held as a single event known as the Canadian National Skating Championships.

==Present day==

=== Why not Synchro Petition ===
Although not currently an Olympic sport, it has already been reviewed for Olympic eligibility. In 2007 synchronized skating was selected to be part of the Universiade or World University Games as a demonstration sport. Teams from several countries competed in Turin, Italy with Sweden, Finland, and Russia coming out on top.

&quot;Why Not Synchro&quot; is an ongoing campaign on social media through the hashtag #whynotsynchro and #whynotsynchro2018 on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. This was popularized at the Mozart Cup, held in Austria in January 2014. During the medal ceremonies, teams gathered on the ice and created the shape of the Olympic rings. This image was then shared over social media as skaters petitioned to raise awareness of the sport. A petition to the International Olympic Committee was posted on change.org calling for 15,000 signatures and asking the IOC &quot;Synchronized Figure Skating: Make it an Olympic Event.&quot; The petition states &quot;The time has come to add this incredible event to the pinnacle of the sport of figure skating.&quot;

=== Effects of COVID-19 ===
Due to the abrupt appearance of COVID-19, the 2019–2020 season was cut short to ensure safety of all teams. Elite US teams like the Haydenettes,Skyliners and Miami university were not able to compete internationally due to travel restrictions set in place in late March and early April. The US Figure Skating Association is responsible for the health and well-being of the athletes and members.

==Judging==
=== International IJS System ===
The competitive levels of synchronized skating, like those in other disciplines of Figure skating, are now judged using the ISU Judging System that was introduced in 2004. Each element is assigned a difficulty level by the technical panel made up of a technical specialist, assistant technical specialist and a technical controller. Each level of difficulty for a particular element corresponds to a pre-determined base value. The base value is the number of points that are awarded for an executed element before the grade of execution or any deductions are applied. Judges assign a grade of execution from -3 to +3 to each of the elements. Each grade of execution, or GOE, corresponds to a point value. For each element, the highest and lowest GOE values are dropped and the rest are averaged then added to the base value. The sum of all the scores of the elements comprises the Technical Elements score.

==== Program Component Score ====
The judges will award points on a scale from 0.25 to 10 (in increments of 0.25) for three program components to grade overall presentation. As with Grade of Execution (GOEs), the highest and lowest scores for each component are thrown out, and the remaining scores are averaged. The final program components scores are then multiplied by a set factor to ensure the technical score and program components score are balanced.

The five program components are:

* Skating Skills - The ability of the skater to execute the skating repertoire of steps, turns and skating movements with blade and body control.
* Performance - The demonstration of engagement, commitment and involvement based on an understanding of the music and composition.
* Composition - The intentional, developed and/or original arrangement of the repertoire and all types of movements into a meaningful whole according to the principles of proportion, unity, space, pattern, and musical structure.

==== Technical Score ====
Each element of the program is assigned a base value, which gives skaters credit for every element they perform. Some elements, such as spins and step sequences, have levels of difficulty on which the base values are established. Judges grade the quality of each element using a grade of execution score within a range of −5 to +5, which is added to or deducted from the base value. GOEs are proportional to the base value of each element. The highest and lowest scores for each element are thrown out, and the remaining scores are averaged to determine the final GOE for each element. The GOE is then added to or subtracted from the base value for each element, and the sum of the scores for all elements forms the technical score.

==== Segment Score ====
The technical score is added to the program components score to determine the segment score (short program/rhythm dance or free skate/dance). The scores for each segment are then added together to determine the competition score. The skater with the highest competition score is declared the winner. In the event of a tie, the team with the highest free program score wins the competition. The IJS is used at events in the national qualifying structure including the U.S. Championships as well as many local competitions at the juvenile through senior levels, including Excel.

=== 6.0 System ===
In the United States, the introductory levels of Aspire Beginner, Aspire Pre-Preliminary, Aspire Preliminary, Open Junior, Open Collegiate, Open Adult, and Open Masters are still judged under the 6.0 judging system. These levels can compete at the regional level but cannot qualify for the national championships. The basic principle of the 6.0 system is a &quot;majority&quot; system. Each event is judged by an odd number of judges, and the winner of the event is the team placed highest by a majority of these judges.

=== Differences in Judging Systems ===
The IJS is based on cumulative points rather than the 6.0 standard of marks and placement. The IJS focuses on the skaters and not the judges. Judges do not have to use their memory to compare all aspects of every skater and figure out where to place them, but simply evaluate the qualities of each performance.

<text>Lipotropic compounds are those that help catalyse the breakdown of fat during metabolism in the body. A lipotropic nutrient promotes or encourages the export of fat from the liver. Lipotropics are necessary for maintenance of a healthy liver, and for burning the exported fat for additional energy. Without lipotropics, such as choline and inositol, fats and bile can become trapped in the liver, causing severe problems such as cirrhosis and blocking fat metabolism.

Choline is the major lipotrope in mammals and other known lipotropes are important only insofar as they contribute to the synthesis of choline. Choline is essential for fat metabolism. Choline functions as a methyl donor and it is required for proper liver function. Though choline can be synthesized from methionine or serine, mammals don&#x27;t produce a sufficient amount on their own. Liver, eggs, wheat bran, meat, and broccoli are dietary sources of choline.

Inositol exerts lipotropic effects as well. Oranges and cantaloupe are high in inositol.

Methionine, an essential amino acid, is a major lipotropic compound in humans. When estrogen levels are high, the body requires more methionine. Estrogens reduce bile flow through the liver and increase bile cholesterol levels. Methionine helps deactivate estrogens. Egg whites are high in methionine.

Methionine levels also affect the amount of sulfur-containing compounds, such as glutathione, in the liver. Glutathione and other sulfur-containing peptides play a critical role in defending against toxic compounds. Supplementation with vitamin C, vitamin D, and NAC can increase glutathione levels.

Betaine hydrochloride is a lipotropic and increases gastric acid. Betaine itself (in a non-hydrochloric form, also known as TMG or Trimethylglycine) also has a lipotropic effect. Quinoa is high in betaine.

<doc id="579061" wikidata="Q1579914" url="?curid=579061" title="Monad (functional programming)">
<text>In functional programming, monads are a way to structure computations as a sequence of steps, where each step not only produces a value but also some extra information about the computation, such as a potential failure, non-determinism, or side effect. More formally, a monad is a type constructor M equipped with two operations, which lifts a value into the monadic context, and which chains monadic computations. In simpler terms, monads can be thought of as interfaces implemented on type constructors, that allow for functions to abstract over various type constructor variants that implement monad (e.g. , , etc.).

Both the concept of a monad and the term originally come from category theory, where a monad is defined as an endofunctor with additional structure. Research beginning in the late 1980s and early 1990s established that monads could bring seemingly disparate computer-science problems under a unified, functional model. Category theory also provides a few formal requirements, known as the [[#Definition|monad laws]], which should be satisfied by any monad and can be used to verify monadic code.

Since monads make semantics explicit for a kind of computation, they can also be used to implement convenient language features. Some languages, such as Haskell, even offer pre-built definitions in their core libraries for the general monad structure and common instances.

== Overview ==
&quot;For a monad codice_1, a value of type codice_2 represents having access to a value of type codice_3 within the context of the monad.&quot; —C. A. McCann

More exactly, a monad can be used where unrestricted access to a value is inappropriate for reasons specific to the scenario. In the case of the Maybe monad, it is because the value may not exist. In the case of the IO monad, it is because the value may not be known yet, such as when the monad represents user input that will only be provided after a prompt is displayed. In all cases the scenarios in which access makes sense are captured by the bind operation defined for the monad; for the Maybe monad a value is bound only if it exists, and for the IO monad a value is bound only after the previous operations in the sequence have been performed.

A monad can be created by defining a type constructor &quot;M&quot; and two operations:

* codice_4 (often also called &quot;unit&quot;), which receives a value of type codice_3 and wraps it into a &quot;monadic value&quot; of type codice_6, and
* codice_7 (typically represented as codice_8), which receives a monadic value of type codice_6 and a function codice_10 that accepts values of the base type codice_3. Bind unwraps codice_3, applies codice_10 to it, and can process the result of codice_10 as a monadic value codice_15.

(An alternative but equivalent construct using the codice_16 function instead of the codice_17 operator can be found in the later section &quot;&quot;.)

With these elements, the programmer composes a sequence of function calls (a &quot;pipeline&quot;) with several &quot;bind&quot; operators chained together in an expression. Each function call transforms its input plain-type value, and the bind operator handles the returned monadic value, which is fed into the next step in the sequence.

Typically, the bind operator codice_8 may contain code unique to the monad that performs additional computation steps not available in the function received as a parameter. Between each pair of composed function calls, the bind operator can inject into the monadic value codice_2 some additional information that is not accessible within the function codice_10, and pass it along down the pipeline. It can also exert finer control of the flow of execution, for example by calling the function only under some conditions, or executing the function calls in a particular order.

=== An example: Maybe ===

One example of a monad is the codice_21 type. Undefined null results are one particular pain point that many procedural languages don&#x27;t provide specific tools for dealing with, requiring use of the null object pattern or checks to test for invalid values at each operation to handle undefined values. This causes bugs and makes it harder to build robust software that gracefully handles errors. The codice_21 type forces the programmer to deal with these potentially undefined results by explicitly defining the two states of a result: codice_23, or codice_24. For example the programmer might be constructing a parser, which is to return an intermediate result, or else signal a condition which the parser has detected, and which the programmer must also handle. With just a little extra functional spice on top, this codice_21 type transforms into a fully-featured monad.

In most languages, the Maybe monad is also known as an option type, which is just a type that marks whether or not it contains a value. Typically they are expressed as some kind of enumerated type. In this Rust example we will call it codice_26 and variants of this type can either be a value of generic type codice_27, or the empty variant: codice_24.
// The &lt;T&gt; represents a generic type &quot;T&quot;
enum Maybe&lt;T&gt; {
 Just(T),
 Nothing,


codice_26 can also be understood as a &quot;wrapping&quot; type, and this is where its connection to monads comes in. In languages with some form of the codice_21 type, there are functions that aid in their use such as composing monadic functions with each other and testing if a codice_21 contains a value.

In the following hard-coded example, a codice_21 type is used as a result of functions that may fail, in this case the type returns nothing if there is a divide-by-zero.
fn divide(x: Decimal, y: Decimal) -&gt; Maybe&lt;Decimal&gt; {
 if y == 0 { return Nothing }
 else { return Just(x / y) }
// divide(1.0, 4.0) -&gt; returns Just(0.25)
// divide(3.0, 0.0) -&gt; returns Nothing
One such way to test whether or not a codice_21 contains a value is to use codice_34 statements.
let m_x = divide(3.14, 0.0); // see divide function above
// The if statement extracts x from m_x if m_x is the Just variant of Maybe
if let Just(x) = m_x {
 println!(&quot;answer: &quot;, x)
} else {
 println!(&quot;division failed, divide by zero error...&quot;)
Other languages may have pattern matching
let result = divide(3.0, 2.0);
match result {
 Just(x) =&gt; println!(&quot;Answer: &quot;, x),
 Nothing =&gt; println!(&quot;division failed; we&#x27;ll get &#x27;em next time.&quot;),
Monads can compose functions that return codice_21, putting them together. A concrete example might have one function take in several codice_21 parameters, and return a single codice_21 whose value is codice_24 when any of the parameters are codice_24, as in the following:
fn chainable_division(maybe_x: Maybe&lt;Decimal&gt;, maybe_y: Maybe&lt;Decimal&gt;) -&gt; Maybe&lt;Decimal&gt; {
 match (maybe_x, maybe_y) {
 (Just(x), Just(y)) =&gt; { // If both inputs are Just, check for division by zero and divide accordingly
 if y == 0 { return Nothing }
 else { return Just(x / y) }
 _ =&gt; return Nothing // Otherwise return Nothing
}
chainable_division(chainable_division(Just(2.0), Just(0.0)), Just(1.0)); // inside chainable_division fails, outside chainable_division returns Nothing
Instead of repeating codice_40 expressions, we can use something called a &quot;bind&quot; operator. (also known as &quot;map&quot;, &quot;flatmap&quot;, or &quot;shove&quot;). This operation takes a monad and a function that returns a monad and runs the function on the inner value of the passed monad, returning the monad from the function.
// Rust example using &quot;.map&quot;. maybe_x is passed through 2 functions that return Maybe&lt;Decimal&gt; and Maybe&lt;String&gt; respectively.
// As with normal function composition the inputs and outputs of functions feeding into each other should match wrapped types. (i.e. the add_one function should return a Maybe&lt;Decimal&gt; which then can be unwrapped to a Decimal for the decimal_to_string function)
let maybe_x: Maybe&lt;Decimal&gt; = Just(1.0)
let maybe_result = maybe_x.map(add_one).map(decimal_to_string)
In Haskell, there is an operator &quot;bind&quot;, or (codice_8) that allows for this monadic composition in a more elegant form similar to function composition.
halve :: Int -&gt; Maybe Int
halve x
 | even x = Just (x `div` 2)
 | odd x = Nothing
 -- This code halves x twice. it evaluates to Nothing if x is not a multiple of 4
halve x »= halve 
With codice_8 available, codice_43 can be expressed much more succinctly with the help of anonymous functions (i.e. lambdas). Notice in the expression below how the two nested lambdas each operate on the wrapped value in the passed codice_21 monad using the bind operator.
 chainable_division(mx,my) = mx »= ( λx -&gt; my »= (λy -&gt; Just (x / y)) )
What has been shown so far is basically a monad, but to be more concise, the following is a strict list of qualities necessary for a monad as defined by the following section.

;&quot;Monadic Type&quot;
:A type (codice_21)
;&quot;Unit operation&quot;
:A type converter (codice_46)
;&quot;Bind operation&quot;
:A combinator for monadic functions ( codice_8 or codice_48)

These are the 3 things necessary to form a monad. Other monads may embody different logical processes, and some may have additional properties, but all of them will have these three similar components.

=== Definition ===
The more common definition for a monad in functional programming, used in the above example, is actually based on a Kleisli triple ⟨T, η, μ⟩ rather than category theory&#x27;s standard definition. The two constructs turn out to be mathematically equivalent, however, so either definition will yield a valid monad. Given any well-defined basic types and , a monad consists of three parts:
* A type constructor that builds up a monadic type 
* A type converter, often called unit or return, that embeds an object in the monad:
* A combinator, typically called bind (as in binding a variable) and represented with an infix operator codice_8 or a method called flatMap, that unwraps a monadic variable, then inserts it into a monadic function/expression, resulting in a new monadic value:
To fully qualify as a monad though, these three parts must also respect a few laws:
* is a left-identity for :
* is also a right-identity for :
* is essentially associative:

Algebraically, this means any monad both gives rise to a category (called the Kleisli category) &quot;and&quot; a monoid in the category of functors (from values to computations), with monadic composition as a binary operator in the monoid and as identity in the monoid.

=== Usage ===
The value of the monad pattern goes beyond merely condensing code and providing a link to mathematical reasoning.
Whatever language or default programming paradigm a developer uses, following the monad pattern brings many of the benefits of purely functional programming.
By reifying a specific kind of computation, a monad not only encapsulates the tedious details of that computational pattern, but it does so in a declarative way, improving the code&#x27;s clarity.
As monadic values explicitly represent not only computed values, but computed &quot;effects&quot;, a monadic expression can be replaced with its value in referentially transparent positions, much like pure expressions can be, allowing for many techniques and optimizations based on rewriting.

Typically, programmers will use to chain monadic functions into a sequence, which has led some to describe monads as &quot;programmable semicolons&quot;, a reference to how many imperative languages use semicolons to separate statements.
However, monads do not actually order computations; even in languages that use them as central features, simpler function composition can arrange steps within a program.
A monad&#x27;s general utility rather lies in simplifying a program&#x27;s structure and improving separation of concerns through abstraction.

The monad structure can also be seen as a uniquely mathematical and compile time variation on the decorator pattern.
Some monads can pass along extra data that is inaccessible to functions, and some even exert finer control over execution, for example only calling a function under certain conditions.
Because they let application programmers implement domain logic while offloading boilerplate code onto pre-developed modules, monads can even be considered a tool for aspect-oriented programming.

One other noteworthy use for monads is isolating side-effects, like input/output or mutable state, in otherwise purely functional code.
Even purely functional languages &quot;can&quot; still implement these &quot;impure&quot; computations without monads, via an intricate mix of function composition and continuation-passing style (CPS) in particular.
With monads though, much of this scaffolding can be abstracted away, essentially by taking each recurring pattern in CPS code and bundling it into a distinct monad.

If a language does not support monads by default, it is still possible to implement the pattern, often without much difficulty.
When translated from category-theory to programming terms, the monad structure is a generic concept and can be defined directly in any language that supports an equivalent feature for bounded polymorphism.
A concept&#x27;s ability to remain agnostic about operational details while working on underlying types is powerful, but the unique features and stringent behavior of monads set them apart from other concepts.

== Applications ==
Discussions of specific monads will typically focus on solving a narrow implementation problem since a given monad represents a specific computational form.
In some situations though, an application can even meet its high-level goals by using appropriate monads within its core logic.

Here are just a few applications that have monads at the heart of their designs:
* The Parsec parser library uses monads to combine simpler parsing rules into more complex ones, and is particularly useful for smaller domain-specific languages.
* xmonad is a tiling window manager centered on the zipper data structure, which itself can be treated monadically as a specific case of delimited continuations.
* LINQ by Microsoft provides a query language for the .NET Framework that is heavily influenced by functional programming concepts, including core operators for composing queries monadically.
* ZipperFS is a simple, experimental file system that also uses the zipper structure primarily to implement its features.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1007/978-3-540-74255-5_22&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Reactive extensions framework essentially provides a (co)monadic interface to data streams that realizes the observer pattern.

==History==
The term &quot;monad&quot; in programming dates to the APL and J programming languages, which do tend toward being purely functional. However, in those languages, &quot;monad&quot; is only shorthand for a function taking one parameter (a function with two parameters being a &quot;dyad&quot;, and so on).

The mathematician Roger Godement was the first to formulate the concept of a monad (dubbing it a &quot;standard construction&quot;) in the late 1950s, though the term &quot;monad&quot; that came to dominate was popularized by category-theorist Saunders Mac Lane. The form defined above using , however, was originally described in 1965 by mathematician Heinrich Kleisli in order to prove that any monad could be characterized as an adjunction between two (covariant) functors.

Starting in the 1980s, a vague notion of the monad pattern began to surface in the computer science community.
According to programming language researcher Philip Wadler, computer scientist John C. Reynolds anticipated several facets of it in the 1970s and early 1980s, when he discussed the value of continuation-passing style, of category theory as a rich source for formal semantics, and of the type distinction between values and computations.
The research language Opal, which was actively designed up until 1990, also effectively based I/O on a monadic type, but the connection was not realized at the time.

The computer scientist Eugenio Moggi was the first to explicitly link the monad of category theory to functional programming, in a conference paper in 1989, followed by a more refined journal submission in 1991. In earlier work, several computer scientists had advanced using category theory to provide semantics for the lambda calculus. Moggi&#x27;s key insight was that a real-world program is not just a function from values to other values, but rather a transformation that forms &quot;computations&quot; on those values. When formalized in category-theoretic terms, this leads to the conclusion that monads are the structure to represent these computations.

Several others popularized and built on this idea, including Philip Wadler and Simon Peyton Jones, both of whom were involved in the specification of Haskell. In particular, Haskell used a problematic &quot;lazy stream&quot; model up through v1.2 to reconcile I/O with lazy evaluation, until switching over to a more flexible monadic interface. The Haskell community would go on to apply monads to many problems in functional programming, and in the 2010s, researchers working with Haskell eventually recognized that monads are applicative functors; and that both monads and arrows are monoids.

At first, programming with monads was largely confined to Haskell and its derivatives, but as functional programming has influenced other paradigms, many languages have incorporated a monad pattern (in spirit if not in name). Formulations now exist in Scheme, Perl, Python, Racket, Clojure, Scala, F#, and have also been considered for a new ML standard.

== Analysis ==
One benefit of the monad pattern is bringing mathematical precision on the composition of computations.
Not only can the monad laws be used to check an instance&#x27;s validity, but features from related structures (like functors) can be used through subtyping.

=== Verifying the monad laws ===
Returning to the codice_21 example, its components were declared to make up a monad, but no proof was given that it satisfies the monad laws.

This can be rectified by plugging the specifics of codice_21 into one side of the general laws, then algebraically building a chain of equalities to reach the other side:
 Law 1: eta(a) »= f(x) ⇔ (Just a) »= f(x) ⇔ f(a)

 Law 2: ma »= eta(x) ⇔ ma
 if ma is (Just a) then
 eta(a) ⇔ Just a
 else or
 Nothing ⇔ Nothing
 end if

 Law 3: (ma »= f(x)) »= g(y) ⇔ ma »= (f(x) »= g(y))
 if (ma »= f(x)) is (Just b) then if ma is (Just a) then
 g(ma »= f(x)) (f(x) »= g(y)) a
 else else
 Nothing Nothing
 end if end if
 ⇔ if ma is (Just a) and f(a) is (Just b) then 
 (g ∘ f) a
 else if ma is (Just a) and f(a) is Nothing then
 Nothing
 else
 Nothing
 end if

=== Derivation from functors ===
Though rarer in computer science, one can use category theory directly, which defines a monad as a functor with two additional natural transformations.
So to begin, a structure requires a higher-order function (or &quot;functional&quot;) named map to qualify as a functor:

This is not always a major issue, however, especially when a monad is derived from a pre-existing functor, whereupon the monad inherits automatically. (For historical reasons, this codice_52 is instead called codice_53 in Haskell.)

A monad&#x27;s first transformation is actually the same from the Kleisli triple, but following the hierarchy of structures closely, it turns out characterizes an applicative functor, an intermediate structure between a monad and a basic functor. In the applicative context, is sometimes referred to as pure but is still the same function. What does differ in this construction is the law must satisfy; as is not defined, the constraint is given in terms of instead:

The final leap from applicative functor to monad comes with the second transformation, the join function (in category theory this is a natural transformation usually called ), which &quot;flattens&quot; nested applications of the monad:
As the characteristic function, must also satisfy three variations on the monad laws:
 
Regardless of whether a developer defines a direct monad or a Kleisli triple, the underlying structure will be the same, and the forms can be derived from each other easily:


=== Another example: List ===

The List monad naturally demonstrates how deriving a monad from a simpler functor can come in handy.
In many languages, a list structure comes pre-defined along with some basic features, so a codice_54 type constructor and operator (represented with codice_55 for infix notation) are assumed as already given here.

Embedding a plain value in a list is also trivial in most languages:
 unit(x) = [x]

From here, applying a function iteratively with a list comprehension may seem like an easy choice for and converting lists to a full monad.
The difficulty with this approach is that expects monadic functions, which in this case will output lists themselves;
as more functions are applied, layers of nested lists will accumulate, requiring more than a basic comprehension.

However, a procedure to apply any &quot;simple&quot; function over the whole list, in other words , is straightforward:
 (map φ) xlist = [ φ(x1), φ(x2), ..., φ(xn) ]

Now, these two procedures already promote codice_54 to an applicative functor.
To fully qualify as a monad, only a correct notion of to flatten repeated structure is needed, but for lists, that just means unwrapping an outer list to append the inner ones that contain values:
 join(xlistlist) = join([xlist1, xlist2, ..., xlistn])
 = xlist1 ++ xlist2 ++ ... ++ xlistn

The resulting monad is not only a list, but one that automatically resizes and condenses itself as functions are applied.
 can now also be derived with just a formula, then used to feed codice_54 values through a pipeline of monadic functions:

 (xlist »= f) = join ∘ (map f) xlist

One application for this monadic list is representing nondeterministic computation.
codice_54 can hold results for all execution paths in an algorithm, then condense itself at each step to &quot;forget&quot; which paths led to which results (a sometimes important distinction from deterministic, exhaustive algorithms).
Another benefit is that checks can be embedded in the monad; specific paths can be pruned transparently at their first point of failure, with no need to rewrite functions in the pipeline.

A second situation where codice_54 shines is composing multivalued functions.
For instance, the th complex root of a number should yield distinct complex numbers, but if another th root is then taken of those results, the final values should be identical to the output of the th root.
codice_54 completely automates this issue away, condensing the results from each step into a flat, mathematically correct list.

== Techniques ==
Monads present opportunities for interesting techniques beyond just organizing program logic. Monads can lay the groundwork for useful syntactic features while their high-level and mathematical nature enable significant abstraction.

=== Syntactic sugar ===
Although using openly often makes sense, many programmers prefer a syntax that mimics imperative statements
(called &quot;do-notation&quot; in Haskell, &quot;perform-notation&quot; in OCaml, &quot;computation expressions&quot; in F#, and &quot;for comprehension&quot; in Scala). This is only syntactic sugar that disguises a monadic pipeline as a code block; the compiler will then quietly translate these expressions into underlying functional code.

Translating the codice_61 function from the codice_21 into Haskell can show this feature in action. A non-monadic version of codice_61 in Haskell looks like this:

add mx my =
 case mx of
 Nothing -&gt; Nothing
 Just x -&gt; case my of
 Nothing -&gt; Nothing
 Just y -&gt; Just (x + y)
In monadic Haskell, codice_64 is the standard name for , plus lambda expressions must be handled explicitly, but even with these technicalities, the codice_21 monad makes for a cleaner definition:

add mx my =
 mx »= (\x -&gt;
 my »= (\y -&gt;
 return (x + y)))
With do-notation though, this can be distilled even further into a very intuitive sequence:

add mx my = do
 x &lt;- mx
 y &lt;- my
 return (x + y)
A second example shows how codice_21 can be used in an entirely different language: F#.
With computation expressions, a &quot;safe division&quot; function that returns codice_67 for an undefined operand &quot;or&quot; division by zero can be written as:

let readNum () =
 let s = Console.ReadLine()
 let succ,v = Int32.TryParse(s)
 if (succ) then Some(v) else None

let secure_div = 
 maybe { 
 let! x = readNum()
 let! y = readNum()
 if (y = 0) 
 then None
 else return (x / y)


At build-time, the compiler will internally &quot;de-sugar&quot; this function into a denser chain of calls:

maybe.Delay(fun () -&gt;
 maybe.Bind(readNum(), fun x -&gt;
 maybe.Bind(readNum(), fun y -&gt;
 if (y=0) then None else maybe.Return(x / y))))
For a last example, even the general monad laws themselves can be expressed in do-notation:

do { x &lt;- return v; f x } == do { f v }
do { x &lt;- m; return x } == do { m }
do { y &lt;- do { x &lt;- m; f x }; g y } == do { x &lt;- m; y &lt;- f x; g y }
=== General interface ===
Every monad needs a specific implementation that meets the monad laws, but other aspects like the relation to other structures or standard idioms within a language are shared by all monads.
As a result, a language or library may provide a general codice_68 interface with function prototypes, subtyping relationships, and other general facts.
Besides providing a head-start to development and guaranteeing a new monad inherits features from a supertype (such as functors), checking a monad&#x27;s design against the interface adds another layer of quality control.

=== Operators ===
Monadic code can often be simplified even further through the judicious use of operators.
The functional can be especially helpful since it works on more than just ad-hoc monadic functions; so long as a monadic function should work analogously to a predefined operator, can be used to instantly &quot;lift&quot; the simpler operator into a monadic one.
With this technique, the definition of codice_61 from the codice_21 example could be distilled into:
 add(mx,my) = map (+)

The process could be taken even one step further by defining codice_61 not just for codice_21, but for the whole codice_68 interface.
By doing this, any new monad that matches the structure interface and implements its own will immediately inherit a lifted version of codice_61 too.
The only change to the function needed is generalizing the type signature:
 add : (Monad Number, Monad Number) → Monad Number

Another monadic operator that is also useful for analysis is monadic composition (represented as infix codice_75 here), which allows chaining monadic functions in a more mathematical style:
 (f &gt;=&gt; g)(x) = f(x) »= g

With this operator, the monad laws can be written in terms of functions alone, highlighting the correspondence to associativity and existence of an identity:
 (unit &gt;=&gt; g) ↔ g
 (f &gt;=&gt; unit) ↔ f
 (f &gt;=&gt; g) &gt;=&gt; h ↔ f &gt;=&gt; (g &gt;=&gt; h)

In turn, the above shows the meaning of the &quot;do&quot; block in Haskell:

 do
 _p &lt;- f(x)
 _q &lt;- g(_p)
 h(_q) ↔ ( f &gt;=&gt; g &gt;=&gt; h )(x)

== More examples ==
=== Identity monad ===
The simplest monad is the Identity monad, which just annotates plain values and functions to satisfy the monad laws:
 newtype Id T = T
 unit(x) = x
 (x »= f) = f(x)

codice_76 does actually have valid uses though, such as providing a base case for recursive monad transformers.
It can also be used to perform basic variable assignment within an imperative-style block.

=== Collections ===
Any collection with a proper is already a monoid, but it turns out that codice_54 is not the only collection that also has a well-defined and qualifies as a monad.
One can even mutate codice_54 into these other monadic collections by simply imposing special properties on :
=== IO monad (Haskell) ===
As already mentioned, pure code should not have unmanaged side effects, but that does not preclude a program from &quot;explicitly&quot; describing and managing effects.
This idea is central to Haskell&#x27;s IO monad, where an object of type codice_79 can be seen as describing an action to be performed in the world, optionally providing information about the world of type codice_3. An action that provides no information about the world has the type codice_81, &quot;providing&quot; the dummy value codice_82.
When a programmer binds an codice_83 value to a function, the function computes the next action to be performed based on the information about the world provided by the previous action (input from users, files, etc.). Most significantly, because the value of the IO monad can only be bound to a function that computes another IO monad, the bind function imposes a discipline of a sequence of actions where the result of an action can only be provided to a function that will compute the next action to perform. This means that actions which do not need to be performed never are, and actions that do need to be performed have a well defined sequence, solving the problem of (IO) actions not being referentially transparent.

For example, Haskell has several functions for acting on the wider file system, including one that checks whether a file exists and another that deletes a file.
Their two type signatures are:

doesFileExist :: FilePath -&gt; IO Bool
removeFile :: FilePath -&gt; IO ()
The first is interested in whether a given file really exists, and as a result, outputs a Boolean value within the codice_83 monad.
The second function, on the other hand, is only concerned with acting on the file system so the codice_83 container it outputs is empty.

codice_83 is not limited just to file I/O though; it even allows for user I/O, and along with imperative syntax sugar, can mimic a typical &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program:

main :: IO ()
main = do
 putStrLn &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
 putStrLn &quot;What is your name, user?&quot;
 name &lt;- getLine
 putStrLn (&quot;Nice to meet you, &quot; ++ name ++ &quot;!&quot;)
Desugared, this translates into the following monadic pipeline (codice_87 in Haskell is just a variant of for when only monadic effects matter and the underlying result can be discarded):

main :: IO ()
main =
 putStrLn &quot;Hello, world!&quot; »
 putStrLn &quot;What is your name, user?&quot; » 
 getLine »= (\name -&gt;
 putStrLn (&quot;Nice to meet you, &quot; ++ name ++ &quot;!&quot;))
=== Writer monad (JavaScript) ===
Another common situation is keeping a log file or otherwise reporting a program&#x27;s progress.
Sometimes, a programmer may want to log even more specific, technical data for later profiling or debugging.
The Writer monad can handle these tasks by generating auxiliary output that accumulates step-by-step.

To show how the monad pattern is not restricted to primarily functional languages, this example implements a codice_88 monad in JavaScript.
First, an array (with nested tails) allows constructing the codice_88 type as a linked list.
The underlying output value will live in position 0 of the array, and position 1 will implicitly hold a chain of auxiliary notes:
const writer = value =&gt; [value, []];

Defining is also very simple:
const unit = value =&gt; [value, []];

Only is needed to define simple functions that output codice_88 objects with debugging notes:

const squared = x =&gt; [x * x, [`${x} was squared.`]];
const halved = x =&gt; [x / 2, [`${x} was halved.`]];
A true monad still requires , but for codice_88, this amounts simply to concatenating a function&#x27;s output to the monad&#x27;s linked list:

const bind = (writer, transform) =&gt; {
 const [value, log] = writer;
 const [result, updates] = transform(value);
 return [result, log.concat(updates)];


The sample functions can now be chained together using , but defining a version of monadic composition (called codice_92 here) allows applying these functions even more succinctly:

const pipelog = (writer, ...transforms) =&gt;
 transforms.reduce(bind, writer);
The final result is a clean separation of concerns between stepping through computations and logging them to audit later: 

pipelog(unit(4), squared, halved);
// Resulting writer object = [8, [&#x27;4 was squared.&#x27;, &#x27;16 was halved.&#x27;]]
===Environment monad===

An environment monad (also called a &quot;reader monad&quot; and a &quot;function monad&quot;) allows a computation to depend on values from a shared environment. The monad type constructor maps a type to functions of type , where is the type of the shared environment. The monad functions are:
formula_1

The following monadic operations are useful:
formula_2

The operation is used to retrieve the current context, while executes a computation in a modified subcontext. As in a state monad, computations in the environment monad may be invoked by simply providing an environment value and applying it to an instance of the monad.

Formally, a value in an environment monad is equivalent to a function with an additional, anonymous argument; and are equivalent to the and combinators, respectively, in the SKI combinator calculus.

===State monads===

A state monad allows a programmer to attach state information of any type to a calculation. Given any value type, the corresponding type in the state monad is a function which accepts a state, then outputs a new state (of type codice_93) along with a return value (of type codice_94). This is similar to an environment monad, except that it also returns a new state, and thus allows modeling a &quot;mutable&quot; environment.
type State s t = s -&gt; (t, s)
Note that this monad takes a type parameter, the type of the state information. The monad operations are defined as follows:
-- &quot;return&quot; produces the given value without changing the state.
return x = \s -&gt; (x, s)
-- &quot;bind&quot; modifies m so that it applies f to its result.
m »= f = \r -&gt; let (x, s) = m r in (f x) s
Useful state operations include:

get = \s -&gt; (s, s) -- Examine the state at this point in the computation.
put s = \_ -&gt; ((), s) -- Replace the state.
modify f = \s -&gt; ((), f s) -- Update the state
Another operation applies a state monad to a given initial state:

runState :: State s a -&gt; s -&gt; (a, s)
runState t s = t s
do-blocks in a state monad are sequences of operations that can examine and update the state data.

Informally, a state monad of state type maps the type of return values into functions of type formula_3, where is the underlying state. The and function are:
:formula_4.

From the category theory point of view, a state monad is derived from the adjunction between the product functor and the exponential functor, which exists in any cartesian closed category by definition.

===Continuation monad===
A continuation monad with return type maps type into functions of type formula_5. It is used to model continuation-passing style. The return and bind functions are as follows:

:formula_6

The call-with-current-continuation function is defined as follows:

:formula_7

=== Program logging ===

The following code is pseudocode. Suppose we have two functions codice_95 and codice_96, with types 

foo : int -&gt; int
bar : int -&gt; int
That is, both functions take in an integer and return another integer. Then we can apply the functions in succession like so:

foo (bar x)
Where the result is the result of codice_95 applied to the result of codice_96 applied to codice_99.

But suppose we are debugging our program, and we would like to add logging messages to codice_95 and codice_96.
So we change the types as so:

foo : int -&gt; int * string
bar : int -&gt; int * string
So that both functions return a tuple, with the result of the application as the integer, 
and a logging message with information about the applied function and all the previously applied functions as the string.

Unfortunately, this means we can no longer compose codice_95 and codice_96, as their input type codice_104 is not compatible with their output type codice_105. And although we can again gain composability by modifying the types of each function to be codice_106, this would require us to add boilerplate code to each function to extract the integer from the tuple, which would get tedious as the number of such functions increases.
Instead, let us define a helper function to abstract away this boilerplate for us:

bind : int * string -&gt; (int -&gt; int * string) -&gt; int * string
codice_17 takes in an integer and string tuple, then takes in a function (like codice_95) that maps from an integer to an integer and string tuple. Its output is an integer and string tuple, which is the result of applying the input function to the integer within the input integer and string tuple. 
In this way, we only need to write boilerplate code to extract the integer from the tuple once, in codice_17.

Now we have regained some composability. For example:

bind (bind (x,s) bar) foo
Where codice_110 is an integer and string tuple.

To make the benefits even clearer, let us define an infix operator as an alias for codice_17:

(»=) : int * string -&gt; (int -&gt; int * string) -&gt; int * string
So that codice_112 is the same as codice_113.

Then the above example becomes:

((x,s) »= bar) »= foo
Finally, we define a new function to avoid writing codice_114 every time we wish to create an empty logging message, where codice_115 is the empty string.

return : int -&gt; int * string
Which wraps codice_99 in the tuple described above.

The result is a pipeline for logging messages:

((return x) »= bar) »= foo
That allows us to more easily log the effects of codice_96 and codice_95 on codice_99.

codice_105 denotes a pseudo-coded monadic value. codice_17 and codice_64 are analogous to the corresponding functions of the same name.
In fact, codice_105, codice_17, and codice_64 form a monad.

=== Additive monads ===
An additive monad is a monad endowed with an additional closed, associative, binary operator mplus and an identity element under , called mzero.
The codice_21 monad can be considered additive, with codice_24 as and a variation on the OR operator as .
codice_54 is also an additive monad, with the empty list codice_129 acting as and the concatenation operator codice_55 as .

Intuitively, represents a monadic wrapper with no value from an underlying type, but is also considered a &quot;zero&quot; (rather than a &quot;one&quot;) since it acts as an absorber for , returning whenever bound to a monadic function.
This property is two-sided, and will also return when any value is bound to a monadic zero function.

In category-theoretic terms, an additive monad qualifies once as a monoid over monadic functions with (as all monads do), and again over monadic values via .

=== Free monads ===
Sometimes, the general outline of a monad may be useful, but no simple pattern recommends one monad or another.
This is where a free monad comes in; as a free object in the category of monads, it can represent monadic structure without any specific constraints beyond the monad laws themselves.
Just as a free monoid concatenates elements without evaluation, a free monad allows chaining computations with markers to satisfy the type system, but otherwise imposes no deeper semantics itself.

For example, by working entirely through the codice_40 and codice_24 markers, the codice_21 monad is in fact a free monad.
The codice_54 monad, on the other hand, is not a free monad since it brings extra, specific facts about lists (like ) into its definition.
One last example is an abstract free monad:

data Free f a
 = Pure a
 | Free (f (Free f a))

unit :: a -&gt; Free f a
unit x = Pure x

bind :: Functor f =&gt; Free f a -&gt; (a -&gt; Free f b) -&gt; Free f b
bind (Pure x) f = f x
bind (Free x) f = Free (fmap (\y -&gt; bind y f) x)

Free monads, however, are &quot;not&quot; restricted to a linked-list like in this example, and can be built around other structures like trees.

Using free monads intentionally may seem impractical at first, but their formal nature is particularly well-suited for syntactic problems.
A free monad can be used to track syntax and type while leaving semantics for later, and has found use in parsers and interpreters as a result.
Others have applied them to more dynamic, operational problems too, such as providing iteratees within a language.

=== Comonads ===
Besides generating monads with extra properties, for any given monad, one can also define a comonad.
Conceptually, if monads represent computations built up from underlying values, then comonads can be seen as reductions back down to values.
Monadic code, in a sense, cannot be fully &quot;unpacked&quot;; once a value is wrapped within a monad, it remains quarantined there along with any side-effects (a good thing in purely functional programming).
Sometimes though, a problem is more about consuming contextual data, which comonads can model explicitly.

Technically, a comonad is the categorical dual of a monad, which loosely means that it will have the same required components, only with the direction of the type signatures &quot;reversed&quot;.
Starting from the -centric monad definition, a comonad consists of:
* A type constructor that marks the higher-order type 
* The dual of , called counit here, extracts the underlying value from the comonad:
 counit(wa) : W T → T
* A reversal of (also represented with codice_135) that extends a chain of reducing functions:
 (wa =» f) : (W U, W U → T) → W T

 and must also satisfy duals of the monad laws:
 counit ∘ ( (wa =» f) → wb ) ↔ f(wa) → b
 wa =» counit ↔ wa
 wa ( (=» f(wx = wa)) → wb (=» g(wy = wb)) → wc ) ↔ ( wa (=» f(wx = wa)) → wb ) (=» g(wy = wb)) → wc

Analogous to monads, comonads can also be derived from functors using a dual of :
* duplicate takes an already comonadic value and wraps it in another layer of comonadic structure:
 duplicate(wa) : W T → W (W T)

While operations like are reversed, however, a comonad does &quot;not&quot; reverse functions it acts on, and consequently, comonads are still functors with , not cofunctors.
The alternate definition with , , and must also respect its own comonad laws:
 ((map duplicate) ∘ duplicate) wa ↔ (duplicate ∘ duplicate) wa ↔ wwwa
 ((map counit) ∘ duplicate) wa ↔ (counit ∘ duplicate) wa ↔ wa
 ((map map φ) ∘ duplicate) wa ↔ (duplicate ∘ (map φ)) wa ↔ wwb

And as with monads, the two forms can be converted automatically:
 (map φ) wa ↔ wa =» (φ ∘ counit) wx
 duplicate wa ↔ wa =» wx

 wa =» f(wx) ↔ ((map f) ∘ duplicate) wa

A simple example is the Product comonad, which outputs values based on an input value and shared environment data.
In fact, the codice_136 comonad is just the dual of the codice_88 monad and effectively the same as the codice_138 monad (both discussed below).
codice_136 and codice_138 differ only in which function signatures they accept, and how they complement those functions by wrapping or unwrapping values.

A less trivial example is the Stream comonad, which can be used to represent data streams and attach filters to the incoming signals with .
In fact, while not as popular as monads, researchers have found comonads particularly useful for stream processing and modeling dataflow programming.

Due to their strict definitions, however, one cannot simply move objects back and forth between monads and comonads.
As an even higher abstraction, arrows can subsume both structures, but finding more granular ways to combine monadic and comonadic code is an active area of research.

<text>Virginia Square–GMU station is a Washington Metro station in the Virginia Square neighborhood of Arlington County, Virginia, United States. The side platformed station opened on December 1, 1979, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). The station serves the Orange and Silver Lines. The station serves the Virginia Square neighborhood as well as the Arlington campus of George Mason University (GMU). The station entrance is located at the intersection of Fairfax Drive and North Monroe Street.

==History==
Originally to be called Ballston, the station was renamed Virginia Square by the Metro board in March 1977. Its name was changed due to its location at the since-demolished Virginia Square Shopping Center. After several years of construction, the station opened on December 1, 1979. Its opening coincided with the completion of approximately of rail west of the Rosslyn station and the opening of the , and stations.

Known originally as simply Virginia Square, in July 1985, the Metro board voted unanimously to rename the station Virginia Square–GMU, with the &quot;GMU&quot; standing for the adjacent, Arlington campus of George Mason University. Arlington County paid the $50,000 required for the change.

This station was closed from March 26, 2020, until June 28, 2020, due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.

<doc id="579066" wikidata="Q328197" url="?curid=579066" title="Thomas Sumter">
<text>Thomas Sumter (August 14, 1734June 1, 1832) was an American military officer, planter, and politician who served in the Continental Army as a brigadier-general during the Revolutionary War. After the war, Sumter was elected to the House of Representatives and to the Senate, where he served from 1801 to 1810, when he retired. Sumter was nicknamed the &quot;Fighting Gamecock&quot; for his military tactics during the Revolutionary War.

==Early life==
Thomas Sumter was born in Hanover County in the Colony of Virginia. His father, William Sumpter, was a miller and former indentured servant, while his mother, Elizabeth, was a midwife. His father was born in England, and Sumter was of English and Welsh descent. Most of Thomas Sumter&#x27;s early years were spent tending livestock and helping his father at the mill, not in school. Given just a rudimentary education on the frontier, the young Sumter served in the Virginia militia, where he was present for Edward Braddock&#x27;s defeat.

===Timberlake Expedition===


At the end of the Anglo-Cherokee War, in 1761, Sumter was invited to join what was to become known as the &quot;Timberlake Expedition&quot;, organized by Colonel Adam Stephen and led by Henry Timberlake, who had volunteered for the assignment. The purpose of the expedition was to visit the Overhill Cherokee towns and renew alliances with the Cherokee following the war. The small expeditionary party consisted of Sumter (who was partially financing the venture with borrowed money), Timberlake, an interpreter named John McCormack, and a servant.

According to Timberlake&#x27;s journal, at one point early in the nearly year and a half long journey, Sumter swam nearly a half-mile in the icy waters to retrieve their canoe, which had drifted away while they were exploring a cave. The party arrived in the Overhill town of Tomotley on December 20, where they were greeted by the town&#x27;s head man, Ostenaco (or &quot;Mankiller&quot;) and soon found themselves participants in a peace pipe ceremony. In the following weeks, Sumter and the group attended peace ceremonies in several Overhill towns, such as Chota, Citico, and Chilhowee.

The party returned to Williamsburg, Virginia, accompanied by several Beloved Men of the Cherokee, arriving on the James River in early April 1762.

While in Williamsburg, Ostenaco professed a desire to meet the king of England, and in May 1762, Sumter traveled to England with Timberlake and three distinguished Cherokee leaders, including Ostenaco. Arriving in London in early June, the Indians were an immediate attraction, drawing crowds all over the city. The three Cherokee then accompanied Sumter back to America, landing in South Carolina on or about August 25, 1762.

===Imprisonment for debt===
Sumter became stranded in South Carolina due to financial difficulties. He petitioned the Virginia Colony for reimbursement of his travel expenses, but was denied. Subsequently, Sumter was imprisoned for debt in Virginia. When his friend and fellow soldier, Joseph Martin, arrived in Staunton, Martin asked to spend the night with Sumter in jail. Martin gave Sumter ten guineas and a tomahawk. Sumter used the money to buy his way out of jail in 1766. When Martin and Sumter were reunited some thirty years later, Sumter repaid the money.

===Family life and business===

Sumter settled in Stateburg, South Carolina, in the Claremont District (later the Sumter District) in the High Hills of Santee. He married Mary Jameson in 1767. Together, they opened several small businesses and eventually became members of the planter class, acquiring ownership over slave plantations.

==American Revolutionary War==
Sumter raised a local militia group in Stateburg. In February 1776, Sumter was elected lieutenant colonel of the Second Regiment of the South Carolina Line of which he was later appointed colonel. in 1780 he was appointed brigadier general, a post he held until the end of the war. He participated in several battles in the early months of the war, including the campaign to prevent an invasion of Georgia. Perhaps his greatest military achievement was his partisan campaigning, which contributed to Lord Cornwallis&#x27; decision to abandon the Carolinas for Virginia.

During fighting in August 1780, he defeated a combined force of Loyalists and British Army regulars at Hanging Rock, and intercepted and defeated an enemy convoy. Later, however, his regiment was almost annihilated by forces led by Banastre Tarleton. He recruited a new force, defeated Major James Wemyss in November, and repulsed an attack by Tarleton, in which he was wounded. Sumter was carried into the Blackstock house, where his surgeon, Dr. Nathaniel Abney, probed for and extracted the ball from under his left shoulder.

In 1781, in response to a low number of recruits, Sumter publicly implemented a bounty for Continental Army recruiters, which stipulated that anyone who managed to recruit a certain number of volunteers for the South Carolina Line would receive Loyalist-owned slaves as a reward. Sumter acquired the nickname &quot;Carolina Gamecock&quot; during the American Revolution, for his fierce fighting tactics. After the Battle of Blackstock&#x27;s Farm, British Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton commented that Sumter &quot;fought like a gamecock&quot;, and Cornwallis described the Gamecock as his &quot;greatest plague&quot;.

==Political career==
After the Revolutionary War, Sumter was elected to the United States House of Representatives, serving from March 4, 1789, to March 3, 1793, and from March 4, 1797, to December 15, 1801.
He later served in the United States Senate, having been selected by the legislature to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Senator Charles Pinckney. Sumter resigned from his seat in the Senate on December 16, 1810.

==Family==

Thomas&#x27; son, Thomas Sumter Jr., served in Rio de Janeiro from 1810 to 1819 as the United States Ambassador to the Portuguese Court during its exile to Brazil. Thomas Jr.&#x27;s wife, Natalie De Lage Sumter (&quot;&quot; Nathalie de Lage de Volude), was a daughter of French nobility, sent by her parents to America for her safety during the French Revolution. She was raised in New York City from 1794 to 1801 by Vice President Aaron Burr as his ward, alongside his own daughter Theodosia. His grandson, Colonel Thomas De Lage Sumter, served in the U.S. Army during the Second Seminole War, and later represented South Carolina in the United States House of Representatives.

Sumter&#x27;s older brother, William Sumter, was a captain in the Revolutionary War.

==Death==
Sumter died on June 1, 1832, at his slave plantation &quot;South Mount&quot;, which was located near Stateburg, South Carolina, at the age of 97. Sumter was the last surviving American general of the Revolutionary War. He is buried at the Thomas Sumter Memorial Park in Sumter County, South Carolina.

==Namesakes==
The city of Sumter, South Carolina, originally incorporated as Sumterville in 1845, was named for Thomas Sumter. The city has erected a memorial to him, and has been dubbed &quot;The Gamecock City&quot; after his nickname.

Prior to being renamed Sumter County in 1868, Sumter District was commonly referred to as the &quot;Old Gamecock District&quot;. The use of this nickname continued after the name change, with the county thereafter being called the &quot;Old Gamecock County&quot;.

Counties in four states are named for Sumter. These are South Carolina, Florida, Alabama, and Georgia The unincorporated community of Sumterville, Florida is the former seat of Sumter County, Florida. Both are named for Thomas Sumter.

Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, a fort planned after the War of 1812, was named in his honor. The fort is best known as the site upon which the shots initiating the American Civil War were fired, at the Battle of Fort Sumter.

Sumter&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Fighting Gamecock&quot;, has become one of several traditional nicknames for a native of South Carolina. For example, the University of South Carolina&#x27;s official nickname is the &quot;Gamecocks&quot;. Since 1903, the college&#x27;s teams have been simply known as the &quot;South Carolina Gamecocks&quot;. The costumed mascot of the University is referred to as Cocky, short for &quot;Gamecock&quot;.

Other schools within South Carolina have been named after Sumter or utilize a Gamecock as their mascot. 
*The mascot of Sumter High School is a &quot;Gamecock&quot; and the school&#x27;s sports teams refer to themselves as the &quot;Sumter High Gamecocks&quot; in honor of Sumter. 
*Thomas Sumter Academy, a private school within Sumter County, was founded in 1964. Their mascot is known as &quot;the General&quot; but does not visually resemble Thomas Sumter and is typically depicted as wearing a Civil War era uniform.

== Legacy ==
Dr. Anne King Gregorie published the first biography of General Sumter in 1931.

Thomas Sumter and his actions served as one of the models for the fictional character of Benjamin Martin in The Patriot, a motion picture released in 2000.

<text>Angelic Upstarts are an English punk rock / Oi! band formed in South Shields in 1977. AllMusic calls them &quot;one of the period&#x27;s most politically charged and thought-provoking groups&quot;. The band espouse an anti-fascist and socialist working class philosophy, and have been associated with the punk and skinhead subcultures.

The band released eight studio albums in their first decade. After a brief split they reformed in 1988, and a number of times subsequently, with new albums appearing in 1992, 2002, 2011, and 2016. More than two decades after its release, their debut single, &quot;The Murder of Liddle Towers&quot;, was included in &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the best punk rock singles of all time.

==Biography==
Inspired by The Clash, Angelic Upstarts formed in Brockley Whins, South Shields, South Tyneside in 1977. The following year they self-released their debut single, &quot;The Murder of Liddle Towers/Police Oppression&quot;, and recorded the first of three Peel Sessions. In 1979, aided by Jimmy Pursey, they signed to major label Warner Bros. Records for two albums: &quot;Teenage Warning&quot; (produced by Pursey) and &quot;We Gotta Get Out of This Place&quot;; the first and its title track were both Top 30 hits. The same year, the band made tabloid headlines following a gig in HM Prison Acklington, and also played on Rock Against Racism&#x27;s &#x27;Militant Entertainment&#x27; tour.

Two Upstarts tracks including 1980 single &quot;Last Night Another Soldier&quot; were included on the same year&#x27;s various artists compilation &quot;Oi! The Album&quot;, beginning the band&#x27;s association with the Oi! subgenre, a label which singer Mensi later rejected. In 1981 the band signed to EMI&#x27;s revived Zonophone imprint for three further albums: &quot;2,000,000 Voices&quot; and &quot;Angelic Upstarts Live&quot; in 1981 - top 40/Top 30 hits respectively - and &quot;Still from the Heart&quot; in 1982. According to Louder Than War, &quot;2,000,000 Voices&quot; is &quot;full of variety while giving up none of their energy, drive and honesty.. it was the perfect record for the Upstarts and the era. Still retaining the Punk might, but working in Reggae and Folk influences, presenting a band perfectly in tune with the turbulent times of 1981&quot;. &quot;Still From The Heart&quot; saw the group embrace &quot;a larger sonic palette. Tentative new wave influences, inflections of dub, and expressive horn sections are all over the album&quot;.

In 1983 the band released the first in a series of independent albums, &quot;Reason Why?&quot;, &quot;the strongest Angelic Upstarts record&quot;, which included the &quot;Woman in Disguise&quot; single, described by Allmusic as &quot;perfect pop&quot;. &quot;Last Tango in Moscow&quot; followed in 1984, described by the Sunderland Echo as &quot;another strong album&quot;, by which time Mensi was the band&#x27;s only original member. Angelic Upstarts&#x27; next album &quot;Power of the Press&quot; (1986) was re-released in the US the following year, renamed for the inclusion of 1985&#x27;s &quot;Brighton Bomb&quot; single. The &quot;Blood on the Terraces&quot; album followed in 1987.

Due to their anti-fascist stance and subsequent support of Anti-Fascist Action, the band were targeted by the neo-nazi Blood &amp; Honour group, and their set at 1988 concert &#x27;Oi! The Main Event&#x27; had to be abandoned due to crowd violence, although songs were included on the eponymous tie-in live album on Link Records as well as later Upstarts compilation &quot;Lost and Found&quot;. Despite far-right claims to the contrary, Angelic Upstarts were gigging in London again within a year.

&quot;Bombed Out&quot; (1992) was the band&#x27;s last album for a decade, featuring original guitarist Mond and hailed as a return to form. Mensi formed a new Upstarts line-up for 2002&#x27;s &quot;Sons of Spartacus&quot; with members of Red Alert, Red London and Leatherface. In 2006-7 Mensi briefly left the band, with Chris Wright of Crashed Out taking over vocal duties, although the return of Decca Wade on drums meant that the band retained an original member; in 2011 the band released a split album with Crashed Out, &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;. 2016 saw a new Angelic Upstarts line-up release what was to become their final studio album, &quot;Bullingdon Bastards&quot;.

==Lineups==
The band&#x27;s original members were Thomas Mensforth (Mensi) on vocals, Ray Cowie (Mond) on guitar, Steve Forsten on bass guitar, and Derek &quot;Decca&quot; Wade on drums. Keith Bell was the manager until 1980, when he was jailed for four and a half years for arson.

Other former members include guitarist Ronnie Rocker and bassists Ronnie Wooden, Glyn Warren and Tony &#x27;Feedback&#x27; Morrison (Long Tall Shorty and Kiria&#x27;s live band). Drummers have included Keith &quot;Sticks&quot; Warrington (who later joined Cockney Rejects), Paul Thompson (ex-Roxy Music), Chris Wright, Evo (who has also played in The Blood, Major Accident and Warfare).

Wade rejoined the band for a few years before leaving again. Brian Hayes (also of Blaggers ITA, Long Tall Shorty) originally joined the band as the second guitarist until Mond left, leaving Hayes as the only guitarist. Tony Van Frater (Red Alert) was Mensi&#x27;s main songwriting partner for the &quot;Sons of Spartacus&quot; album in 2002.

In August 2006, Mensi announced he was resigning, but requested that the band continue with Chris Wright (of the band Crashed Out) on vocals. The band&#x27;s lineup became Wright on vocals, Dickie Hammond on guitar, Neil &quot;Newts&quot; Newton on guitar, Gaz &quot;Geordie&quot; Stoker on bass and Wade on drums. In the latter part of 2007, Mensi rejoined the band and the lineup became Mensi on vocals, Gaz &quot;Geordie&quot; Stoker on bass, Hammond on guitar, Newts on guitar and Brett Mulvaney (and later Jonnie Halling) on drums. In October 2018 Gaz &quot;Geordie&quot; Stoker left the band and was replaced by John Woodward (Long Tall Shorty, The Straps, The Gonads). In January 2020, after 14 years and two albums with the band, Neil &quot;Newts&quot; Newton, took time out to complete university and was replaced by Mick Robson. The lineup becoming Mensi on vocals, Mick Robson on guitar, John Woodward on bass and Andy Wilkinson on drums. Having completed his course, Newts rejoined the band to perform at a charity tribute show for Mensi, with Chris Wright standing in on vocal duties and the final Angelic Upstarts line-up of Andy Wilkinson on drums, John Woodward on bass, Mick Robson on guitar with Newts Newton on guitar.

Former guitarist Tony Van Frater died on 29 October 2015. Dickie Hammond died two days later. On 22 February 2021, former member Tony Morrison (aka Tony Feedback) died after contracting COVID-19. Thomas Mensforth (aka Mensi or Mensi Marx) died on 10 December 2021, aged 65, after also being infected with COVID-19.

==Influence==
Angelic Upstarts are regarded as pioneers of the Oi! punk subgenre. In 2001, Various Artists cover album &quot;We Are The People&quot; was released in tribute to the Upstarts, including tracks from bands such as Leatherface, The Oppressed, Red London and Red Alert. In 2009, punk-influenced singer-songwriter Jamie T sampled vocals from the album &quot;Angelic Upstarts Live&quot; on his song &quot;The Man&#x27;s Machine&quot;.

<text>Shelley Long (born August 23, 1949) is an American retired actress, singer, and comedian. For her role as Diane Chambers on the sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;, Long received five Emmy nominations, winning in 1983 for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. She also won two Golden Globe Awards for the role. Long reprised her role as Diane Chambers in three episodes of the spin-off &quot;Frasier&quot;, for which she received an additional guest star Emmy nomination. In 2009, she began playing the recurring role of DeDe Pritchett on the ABC comedy series &quot;Modern Family&quot;.

Long has also starred in several films including &quot;Night Shift&quot; (1982), &quot;Irreconcilable Differences&quot; (1984), &quot;The Money Pit&quot; (1986), &quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot; (1987), &quot;Hello Again&quot; (1987), &quot;Troop Beverly Hills&quot; (1989), &quot;The Brady Bunch Movie&quot; (1995), &quot;A Very Brady Sequel&quot; (1996), and &quot;Dr. T &amp; the Women&quot; (2000).

==Early life==
Shelley Long was born on August 23, 1949, in Indian Village, Fort Wayne, Indiana. She is the only child of Ivadine (née Williams), a schoolteacher, and Leland Long who worked in the rubber industry before becoming a teacher as well. 

Shelley was raised in the Presbyterian faith. She was active on her high school speech team, competing in the Indiana High School Forensic Association. In 1967, she won the National Forensic League&#x27;s National Championship in Original Oratory.

After graduating from South Side High School in Fort Wayne, she studied drama at Northwestern University but left before graduating to pursue a career in acting and modeling. Her first job was at the university as a meal plan checker.

==Career==
Long&#x27;s break as an actress occurred when she began performing in local commercials for Homemakers furniture store in the Chicago area.

===Early roles (1977-1982)===
In Chicago, Long joined The Second City comedy troupe. In 1975, she began writing, producing, and co-hosting the television program &quot;Sorting It Out&quot; on WMAQ-TV and went on to win three Regional Emmys for her work on the show. She also appeared in the 1970s in VO5 shampoo print advertisements and in commercials for Camay soap as well as more Homemakers furniture commercials. In 1978, she appeared in a vignette on &quot;The Love Boat&quot;.

Long appeared in the 1979 television film &quot;The Cracker Factory&quot; as a psychiatric inmate. In the same year she guest starred on &quot;Family&quot; and &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot;, and played Nurse Mendenhall in an episode of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. In 1980, she appeared in her first feature film role in &quot;A Small Circle of Friends&quot;. The film about social unrest at Harvard University during the 1960s enjoyed a level of critical success. In 1981, she played the role of Tala in &quot;Caveman&quot;. In 1982, she starred as Belinda, the good-natured prostitute neighbor of the character portrayed by Henry Winkler in Ron Howard&#x27;s comedy &quot;Night Shift&quot; (also co-starring Michael Keaton), and starred with Tom Cruise in &quot;Losin&#x27; It&quot; (1983). She was offered the role of Mary, the mother in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, but turned it down because she had already signed on to appear in &quot;Night Shift&quot;.

=== &quot;Cheers&quot; (1982-1987) ===
Although she had already been in feature films, Long became famous for her role in the long-running television sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot; as the character Diane Chambers, who has a tempestuous on-and-off relationship with Sam Malone. The show was slow to capture an audience but eventually became one of the more popular on the air. Amid some controversy, Long left &quot;Cheers&quot; after season five in 1987.

In the &quot;Cheers&quot; biography documentary, co-star Ted Danson admitted there was tension between them but &quot;never at a personal level and always at a work level&quot; due to their different modes of working. He also stated that Long was much more similar to her TV character than she might have liked to admit, but also said that her performances often &quot;carried the show.&quot; Long said in later interviews that it did not occur to her, when deciding to leave, that she was going to &quot;sabotage a show&quot; and she felt confident that the rest of the cast could continue without her.

In a 2003 interview with Graham Norton, Long said she left for a variety of reasons, the most important of which was her desire to spend more time with her daughter. In a 2007 interview on Australian television, Long said Danson was &quot;a delight to work with&quot; and talked of her love for co-star Nicholas Colasanto (&quot;Coach&quot;), who was &quot;one of my closest friends on set&quot;. She said she left the show because she &quot;didn&#x27;t want to keep doing the same episode over and over again and the same story. I didn&#x27;t want it to become old and stale.&quot; She went on to say that &quot;working at &quot;Cheers&quot; was a dream come true...it was one of the most satisfying experiences of my life. So, yes, I missed it, but I never regretted that decision.&quot;

===Film===

While appearing on &quot;Cheers&quot;, Long continued to appear in motion pictures. In 1984, she was nominated for a Best Leading Actress Golden Globe for her performance in &quot;Irreconcilable Differences&quot;. She also starred in the comedies &quot;The Money Pit&quot; and &quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot;. She was offered lead roles in &quot;Working Girl&quot;, &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot;, and &quot;My Stepmother Is an Alien&quot; but did not accept them.

On August 12, 1986, Long signed a production agreement with The Walt Disney Studios through Itsbinso Long Inc. to produce three films for the Walt Disney Pictures and Touchstone Films labels.

===Post-&quot;Cheers&quot; projects (1987-1994)===
Long&#x27;s first post-&quot;Cheers&quot; project was &quot;Hello Again&quot;, a comedy about a housewife who is brought back from the dead. This was followed by &quot;Troop Beverly Hills&quot;, a comedy about another housewife who takes leadership of a &#x27;Wilderness Girl&#x27; troop to bond with her daughter and distract herself from divorce proceedings. Neither film was successful with critics or at the box office.

In 1990, Long returned to television for the fact-based miniseries &quot;Voices Within: The Lives of Truddi Chase&quot;. She received critical praise for the role, which required her to portray nearly 20 personalities. This introduced her to more dramatic roles in TV films, after which she starred in several more throughout the 1990s.

Major feature film roles followed such as the romantic comedy &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Her It&#x27;s Me&quot; with Jami Gertz and Steve Guttenberg and &quot;Frozen Assets&quot;, a comedy about a sperm bank, which reunited her with &quot;Hello Again&quot; co-star Corbin Bernsen.

In 1992, she starred in &quot;Fatal Memories: The Eileen Franklin Story&quot;, a television drama about a woman who remembers the childhood trauma of being raped by her father and his cronies, and witnessing him murder her childhood friend to prevent the child from &quot;telling on him,&quot; based on a 1989 case. The still-controversial &quot;recovered memories&quot; basis for the prosecution resulted in the conviction and sentencing of life imprisonment of George Franklin, a conviction that was later overturned.

Long starred in the 1992 film &quot;A Message from Holly&quot; with Lindsay Wagner. Long plays a workaholic who finds out that her best friend has cancer and only six months to live, then stays with her in her last months.

In 1993, the actress returned to &quot;Cheers&quot; for its series finale, and picked up another Emmy nomination for her return as Diane. She also starred in the sitcom &quot;Good Advice&quot; with Treat Williams and Teri Garr, a show that lasted two seasons. She later resurfaced as Diane in several episodes of the Kelsey Grammer spinoff series &quot;Frasier&quot;, for which she was nominated for another Emmy Award.

Both &quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot; co-star Bette Midler and Paramount studio executive Richard H. Frank, who helped develop &quot;Cheers&quot;, described Long as being difficult to work with.

===Later work (1995-2022)===
Long appeared as Carol Brady in the 1995 film &quot;The Brady Bunch Movie&quot; which is a campy take of the popular television show. In 1996, she reprised her role in &quot;A Very Brady Sequel&quot; which had modest success, and a 2002 television film sequel—&quot;The Brady Bunch in the White House&quot;. Some ventures followed including the TV remake of &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; and the family sitcom &quot;Kelly Kelly&quot;, which only lasted for a few episodes. She played the Wicked Witch of the Beanstalk in a 1998 episode of &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot;.

In 1999, she starred in another television film &quot;Vanished Without a Trace&quot;, about a woman who refuses to accept the kidnapping of her 13-year-old daughter and relentlessly pursues the villain&#x27;s capture (not to be confused with the 1993 film of the same name about the 1976 Chowchilla kidnapping.) In 2000, she appeared as one of the women in the Richard Gere film &quot;Dr. T &amp; the Women&quot;, directed by Robert Altman.

Long guest-starred in several TV shows such as &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot;, &quot;Yes Dear&quot;, &quot;Strong Medicine&quot;, and &quot;Boston Legal&quot;. She had a recurring role on the popular ABC sitcom &quot;Modern Family&quot; as DeDe Pritchett, the ex-wife of Jay Pritchett. She starred in television films, including &quot;Falling in Love with the Girl Next Door&quot; and &quot;Holiday Engagement&quot;. In 2012, she made a guest appearance on &quot;Switched at Birth&quot;. In 2016, Long produced and acted in the feature film &quot;Different Flowers&quot;.

==Personal life==
Long&#x27;s first marriage, to Ken Solomon, ended in divorce in the 1970s after only 
a few years. In 1979, she met her second husband, Bruce Tyson, a securities broker. They married in 1981 and had a daughter, Juliana. Long and Tyson separated in 2003 and divorced in 2004.

<text>The media in Toronto encompasses a wide range of television and radio stations, as well as digital and print media outlets. These media platforms either service the entire city or are cater to a specific neighbourhood or community within Toronto. Additionally, several media outlets from Toronto extend their services to cover the Greater Toronto Area and the Golden Horseshoe region. While most media outlets in Toronto cater to local or regional audiences, there are also several national media outlets based in the city that distribute their services across Canada and caters to a national audience.

Toronto is largest mass media market in Canada, and the fourth-largest market in North America, behind New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago. As a result, several Canadian media companies and conglomerates are based in Toronto.

==TV stations==
The incumbent cable provider in the Toronto area is Rogers Cable, which originally secured the cable franchise for most of the pre-amalgamation city of Toronto, and later purchased the systems in surrounding areas. Since 2010, Bell Fibe TV (an IPTV terrestrial service operated by Rogers&#x27; rival Bell Canada) has been available in most neighbourhoods in the Greater Toronto Area. Independent IPTV television services such as Vmedia and Zazeen have also become available.

American network affiliates on Toronto cable are piped in from Buffalo, New York, including WGRZ (NBC), WIVB-TV (CBS), WKBW-TV (ABC), WUTV (Fox), and WNED-TV (PBS). For additional fees cable subscribers can also watch WNYO-TV (MyNetworkTV) and WNLO (The CW). Many of these stations can be seen over the air throughout the Greater Toronto Area.

Toronto has seven times the population of the Buffalo market. In particular, WUTV and WNED rely heavily on viewership from Toronto; both have long identified as serving &quot;Buffalo/Toronto,&quot; and also have sales offices in the city. More than half of WNED&#x27;s members live in Toronto.

Most of Canada&#x27;s over-the-air and cable television networks also have national operations based in Toronto; for more information, see List of Canadian television channels.

<doc id="579073" wikidata="Q151982" url="?curid=579073" title="Havelock, New Zealand">
<text>Havelock is a small town in the Marlborough Region of New Zealand, at the head of Pelorus Sound, one of the Marlborough Sounds, and at the mouth of the Pelorus and Kaituna Rivers

State Highway 6 from Nelson to Blenheim passes through the town. Queen Charlotte Drive, which provides a shorter but very winding road to Picton proceeds east along the edge of the Sounds. Canvastown lies to the west. Renwick is to the south. Picton lies 35 km to the east.

Havelock serves as the centre for much of the New Zealand green-lipped mussel industry, and promotes itself as the greenshell mussel capital of the world. It also functions as the base for a mail boat servicing the remote communities in the Marlborough Sounds, as well as for many fishing and recreational boats.

The name &quot;Havelock&quot; commemorates Sir Henry Havelock (1795-1857), known from the Siege of Lucknow during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The streets were laid out in 1858, with Lucknow Street as the main thoroughfare.
The gold rush to the Wakamarina Valley in 1864 boosted the growth of the township, with sawmilling becoming the main activity until the 1910s, later joined by dairying. The valleys around Havelock contain many pine plantations.

Across the Kaituna River estuary, the Cullen Point Scenic Reserve
and the Mahakipawa Hill Scenic Reserve
offer a coastal walking-track to a lookout at Cullen Point.

<doc id="579076" wikidata="Q3238284" url="?curid=579076" title="Lieutenant Governor of California">
<text>The lieutenant governor of California is the second highest executive officer of the government of the U.S. state of California. The lieutenant governor is elected to serve a four-year term and can serve a maximum of two terms. In addition to largely ministerial roles, serving as acting governor in the absence of the governor of California and as President of the California State Senate, the lieutenant governor either sits on (or appoints representatives to) many of California&#x27;s regulatory commissions and executive agencies.

California is one of seventeen states where the governor and lieutenant governor do not run as running mates on the same ticket: in California the governor and lieutenant governor are elected separately, although both are up for election in the same year every four years. As a result, California has frequently had a governor and a lieutenant governor of different parties.

California has had 41 lieutenant governors and five acting lieutenant governors since achieving statehood in 1850. The current lieutenant governor is Eleni Kounalakis, a Democrat who was sworn into office on January 7, 2019. She is the first woman elected to the office in California history.

==Responsibilities==
The lieutenant governor is, after the governor, the highest-ranking executive officer of the state of California. The responsibilities of this independently elected office are largely concerned with core constitutional duties, higher education, natural resources, economic development. In addition, the lieutenant governor carries out some miscellaneous functions.

===Core constitutional duties===
The California Constitution designates the lieutenant governor as president of the California State Senate and provides that all the powers of the governor fall to the lieutenant governor whenever the governor is not in the State of California, with the lieutenant governor often signing or vetoing legislation, or making political appointments, whenever the governor leaves the state. In practice, the lieutenant governor only presides over the Senate when requested by the president pro tempore or in order to cast a tie-breaking vote. Moreover, there is a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement for the lieutenant governor not to perform more than perfunctory duties while the governor is away from the state. This agreement was violated when Mike Curb was in office, as he signed several executive orders at odds with the administration of Jerry Brown and appointed Armand Arabian as presiding justice on the California Courts of Appeal when Brown was out of the state. Brown withdrew Arabian&#x27;s appointment upon his return, appointing Bernard S. Jefferson in his place. In the 1979 case &quot;In re Governorship&quot;, the California Supreme Court upheld the lieutenant governor&#x27;s right to perform the duties and assume all of the prerogatives of governor while the governor is out of the state, but that the governor generally has the right to rescind those actions upon his or her return.

===Higher education===
The lieutenant governor is the only elected official in California to have a comprehensive policymaking role over the entire higher education system. By virtue of office, he or she is a full voting member of the Board of Regents of the University of California, the Board of Trustees of California State University, the Board of Governors of the California Community College System, and the Calbright College Board of Trustees.

===Natural resources===
Together with the state controller and director of finance, the lieutenant governor is a member of the California State Lands Commission. The State Lands Commission is an independent state agency which manages 450,000 acres of school trust lands and an additional 4,000,000 acres of public trust lands consisting of California&#x27;s foreshore, nearshore, and the beds of natural navigable rivers, streams, lakes, bays, estuaries, inlets, and straits. The position of commission chair alternates annually between the lieutenant governor and the state controller; in those years when the lieutenant governor is commission chair, the lieutenant governor is also a voting member of the Ocean Protection Council and a non-voting member of the California Coastal Commission.

===Economic development===
The lieutenant governor chairs the Commission for Economic Development, which is responsible for fostering economic growth in California by developing and implementing strategies for attracting new business to the state, increasing state exports, creating new jobs, and stimulating industries statewide. The commission is composed of appointees from the legislature and the governor and currently does not have a quorum needed to meet.

===Miscellaneous functions===
Many California projects created through gubernatorial executive orders, or through the initiative process, include a role for the lieutenant governor. For example, the lieutenant governor serves on the Agriculture-Water Transition Task Force (created by Governor Gray Davis), and five of the twenty-nine members of the oversight committee of the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine are appointed by the lieutenant governor.

==Criticism of the office==
Some academics and scholars such as Roger E. Noll and Bruce Cain in &quot;Constitutional Reform in California&quot; have criticized constitutional offices like the lieutenant governor because of their low visibility among the electorate that can make it difficult for the electorate to hold constitutional officers like the lieutenant governor responsible for their actions. Although the lieutenant governor of California&#x27;s powers and responsibilities are clearly lesser than those of the governor, the ability to make appointments to, and decisions on, the boards of executive agencies does allow the lieutenant governor to make policy decisions that, due to their separate election, might well conflict with the agenda of the governor. Thus, it is argued, California might benefit if the governor and the lieutenant governor ran on the same ticket. The lieutenant governor would then be more likely to help the governor – who is subject to a greater degree of voter scrutiny – to implement his or her policies, but that is unlikely.

In 2003, although Lt. Governor Cruz Bustamante and Governor Gray Davis were both Democrats, they reportedly had an icy relationship and had not spoken in months before the 2003 California recall election approached. Bustamante&#x27;s decision to run in the recall election was controversial, as many supporters of Governor Davis had urged prominent Democrats not to run, in an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of the event.

Despite being the second highest-ranking office in California, the lieutenant governor has no real responsibility or power to represent the governor on issues such as trade negotiations or a legislative agenda (i.e. in contrast to its powerful counterpart in Texas), so the job has been jokingly defined by political insiders as &quot;get up, read the paper, see if the governor is dead, if not, go back to sleep.&quot; Despite its prestige, it has not historically been a strong springboard to higher political office; Gray Davis and current Governor Gavin Newsom are the only Democrats in state history and the only state politicians in the last eight decades to be elected governor after holding the post. Furthermore, the lieutenant governor&#x27;s office budget has suffered considerable cutbacks in recent times; the proposed annual budget for July 2011 will be slightly over $1 million and include three staffers, while from 1995 to 1999 the office had an $1.3 million annual budget with a staff of 17. By contrast the attorney general of California oversees 5,300 employees, including 1,110 state attorneys, and its 2010 budget was over $700 million.

<doc id="579077" wikidata="Q1811803" url="?curid=579077" title="Lenore, the Cute Little Dead Girl">
<text>Lenore, the Cute Little Dead Girl is a black comedy comic series created by Roman Dirge, inspired by the poem &quot;Lenore&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe. Lenore has appeared in several comic books by Dirge. From 1998 to 2007, she featured in her own series published by Slave Labor Graphics. Twenty-six flash-animated shorts were also produced for Sony&#x27;s ScreenBlast website in 2002. In July 2009, a new comic series started, now published by Titan Books and called &quot;Lenore Volume II&quot;. Previous issues were made into colored edition trade paperback called &quot;Lenore Volume I&quot;, which is separated into three books.

On 31 July 2013,&quot; Lenore Volume II #8&quot; was released, marking the start of a plotline that continued for six issues.

==Plot outline==

The comic tells of the unlife and adventures of the title character and her similarly odd (if not odder) friends. The story takes place in a small town called Nevermore (taking its name from &quot;The Raven&quot;, another of Poe&#x27;s poems) and the surrounding wilderness where Lenore&#x27;s mansion and a nearby graveyard are situated.

The primary focus of the graphic novel is dark humor, with many of the stories having twist endings. Common themes are the reinvention of children&#x27;s songs, games, and nursery rhymes to something more macabre, and subverting all sorts of pop culture icons and cultural figures into topics of dark comedy. In one story, for instance, Lenore accidentally kills the Easter Bunny.
Lenore&#x27;s actions often result in the death or injury to those around her and in various forms of chaos. Lenore is a character who is a mystery. She often thinks she is doing good and occasionally shows good intentions, although in later issues the character has shown a change in personality. When she is asked of what her dream is, she replies that it is to rule the world. To further question this, it should also be mentioned that whenever Lenore gets really upset or angry, she can be very violent and often takes her anger out on whoever made her angry even if it is one of her friends. This results in most of her friends (except for Mr. Gosh) being very fearful of her. She can also be spiteful. All of this results in Lenore being an enigma due to her at times thinking that she is doing good with a meaning to do good and at other times wanting to do something more along the lines of being evil.

The comic also featured various one-time side stories (one of these characters, Samurai Sloth, is set to star in his own series) and occasionally guest strips from other artists (with Jhonen Vasquez being the most frequent). A recurring comic strip called &quot;Things Involving Me&quot; tells about the author&#x27;s life and experience in an exaggerated, semiautobiographical manner.

==Animated shorts==
A series of 2–4 minute shorts produced by Adelaide Productions and Sony Pictures Digital Entertainment was created for Sony&#x27;s ScreenBlast website. Any other website distributing these is doing so without Sony&#x27;s permission, although Dirge has given permission for people to distribute them as they see fit.

All films begin with a line from Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;Lenore&quot;: &quot;A dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young&quot;. &quot;Dirge&quot; also happens to be the pseudonymous surname of Lenore&#x27;s creator.

==Movie plans==
Plans were made for the making of a Lenore feature film by Sony Family Entertainment. A script was written, but it was not approved by Dirge. The contract has expired.

At his panel at the 2011 Comic Con, Roman Dirge announced that Neil Gaiman has agreed to serve as an executive producer for a CGI film adaptation. 

The movie appears to be in development.

==Lenore by Titan Books==

===Lenore Volume I===
Lenore Volume I consists of three hardcover graphic novels that include 12 issues of the original Lenore Series originally published by Slave Labor Graphics but in full color: Noogies (Issues 1-4), Wedgies (Issues 5-8) and Cooties (Issues 9-12). These three volumes were previously available as trade paperbacks published by Slave Labor Graphics with illustrations in black &amp; white.

===Lenore Volume II===
Titan Magazines released a new line of Lenore comics in full color that started with a new #1 in 2009 and continues to be published up to the present. They also continue with their hardcover graphic novels line: &quot;Swirlies&quot; (which includes the extremely rare Vol. 1 #13 from the original series, also in full color, plus Vol. 2 issues #1-3), &quot;Purple Nurples&quot; (Vol. 2 issues #4-7) and &quot;Pink Bellies&quot; (Vol. 2 issues #8-11).

==Characters==

===Lenore Lynchfast===
Lenore is a 10-year-old undead girl who lives in a mansion with her other creepy friends. She died of pneumonia at the beginning of the 20th century, issue #14 had more of her origin revealed.

Her character has developed from being a somewhat malicious character in the early comics, hurting people out of spite or revenge, to a well-meaning but dim character who kills people by &quot;accident&quot;, stemming from the fact that Lenore is generally unaware of her surroundings, as well as the fact that she is dead. Lenore says she loves animals (especially cats), but she constantly kills all her pets.

Later, she reverts to her old self and starts hurting those around her with full intentions on what she is doing, as it can be seen in issue #9, when she insults Ragamuffin and calls him all kinds of names and in issue #13 where she declares that her dream is to take over the world. 
Sometimes, she appears to enjoy others&#x27; misfortune, since she smiles when she hurts or kills them, and is often depicted as quite violent, especially when she is unhappy about something or when she is angry.

Lenore usually does and says things that do not make sense most of the time, resulting in the annoyance of her level-headed companion, Ragamuffin, who considers her a dimwit, calling her &quot;special in the head&quot;. However, despite all that, whether she is really dense or she acts stupidly on purpose, just to torment Ragamuffin for fun, is unclear, because at times she is shown to be quite intelligent-such as in Vol. 2 issue #2, when she verbosely presents Mr. Gosh with various examples of &quot;things she loves more than him&quot; which are quite revolting but quite witty nonetheless.

After she is taken by Death to the Underworld, she escapes from there and returns to the living world, with Ragamuffin&#x27;s help, who unburies her. She has two big, black wings, gained after her return from Hell. Apparently, she can let others see her wings only if she desires to.

In issue #9, she tries to tell Ragamuffin that he is her best friend, but she is interrupted by him, when he sprays a substance on her face to kill the worm that eats from her forehead.

Lenore gives Ragamuffin a Valentine&#x27;s Day gift in the bonus comic from Vol. 2 issue #2, where he accepts it until he realizes what she has given him as a Valentine&#x27;s Day card is, in fact, a &#x27;nard&#x27;.

In the later issues, it is revealed that Lenore&#x27;s last name is Lynchfast.

It is unknown if she has parents or not. Given that she is over a century dead, her birth parents would have also perished, but the way the priest talks to her in &quot;Lil Ballerina&quot; suggests that he may be a father figure to her.

It is also unclear what type of undead she is. She generally appears zombie-like, but she has small pointed canines like a vampire. Given the fact that she gained wings, she may likely be part-demon.

In the cartoon, she has a Southern accent.

===Ragamuffin===
Ragamuffin can at first sight look like a rag doll with worms for hair and polyester filling, but he has a very interesting background story and personality.
Ragamuffin was a 400-year-old (as mentioned in issue #13) vampire who fed upon the flesh of the living. One night he attacked a young woman and ate her, but unfortunately, her sister, who happened to be a powerful witch, witnessed the scene. The witch cursed him and transformed him into a doll. A drop of Lenore&#x27;s blood eventually returned him to consciousness, but since her blood was mixed with embalming fluid the curse was only partially lifted: he will never cease to be a doll. (He was briefly reverted into his original body at the end of issue #11, but returned to his rag doll form in the last frame of issue #12).

Ragamuffin is a little unsure of some of Lenore&#x27;s crazier ideas and is oddly enough the occasional voice of reason in the comic. Still, as shown in the later comics, Ragamuffin is loyal to Lenore, often joining her plans in the flash-animated cartoons. He is often infuriated by her dimwitted behavior, but he goes along with her in the end. One example is in issue #13, when Lenore says that he is her little kid (or &quot;baby&quot;, as she calls him) and, after many protests, he gives up and lets her put a baby bottle into his mouth. In contrast to the brutal, savage nature of his original vampire form, he seems quite interested in somewhat more humanlike activities as a ragged doll, though he does not admit it (he persistently denies it and tries to change the topic when Lenore accuses him of break-dancing in parachute pants in Vol. 2 issue #1).

Ragamuffin becomes very protective of Lenore and, in issue #12, when he is reverted into a vampire, he remains by her side and tries to defend her from the Nazi zombies that ascended from Hell. In the same issue, Ragamuffin threatens Mr. Gosh, when he disturbs Lenore, and makes him eat his own bowels. Also in Vol. 2 issue #1, Ragamuffin brutally murders Mortimer Fledge, who tries to get revenge on Lenore for quite unintentionally ruining his life. Ragamuffin seems worried when Lenore gets sick, takes her to a doctor and he is really devastated when she dies for the second time in &quot;Lenore&#x27;s last (Part 2)&quot;. These actions imply the fact that he views himself as her parental figure, or at least as her guardian. The supposition is validated by Pooty Applewater&#x27;s letter, in issue #13, in which he tells Lenore that he cannot leave her with the Puff-Puff Midget, who calls himself Ragamuffin, to protect her. In issue #9, when Lenore falls briefly for Mr. Gosh (when his mask is removed) and shoves Ragamuffin away, he seems hurt and tells her he has feelings.

A new game based on Ragamuffin has been made, in which he plays the role of Lenore&#x27;s rescuer. However the game had been pulled from the App Store as it was found to have a lot of glitches.

In the original, animated series, he is voiced by Roman Dirge, the titular author of the comics. Dirge hopes to continue as the voice of Ragamuffin in the Lenore movie.

===Pooty Applewater===
Pooty Applewater made his first appearance in issue #9 as a bounty hunter sent to bring Lenore back to the underworld. Lenore convinced him to let her stay and he became one of her friends, playing a part in the battles that followed. He has a small, bucket-like head and carries a trident. In #13 Pooty suddenly vanished leaving a note that informed Lenore and Ragamuffin that his ex-wife wanted child support and that he would be fleeing to Norway or Mexico. But, 2 issues later, he re-appeared in Issue 3, Volume 2, and has stayed with Lenore and Ragamuffin as a permanent resident since.

Since this, Pooty and Ragamuffin&#x27;s &#x27;buddy-hate&#x27; relationship has only begun to increase. At &quot;times&quot;, they lend each other a hand when they need one, (such as when they worked together to hide the Bloody Birthday clowns in issue #6 Volume 2, or when Ragamuffin helped Pooty pull a splinter out of his ass in Issue #8 Volume 2), but they also can betray each other in small ways at the same time, and weakly argue like an old married couple. (Like when Pooty asked to take a picture with Ragamuffin, and made him look completely ridiculous by drawing and writing things to make fun of him in the background, or when Ragamuffin &#x27;agreed&#x27; to tell Lenore how her parents actually left her and were killed by Taxidermy, but instead gave the wheel to Pooty by saying, &quot;Lenore, Pooty has something to tell you. And if he doesn&#x27;t, it means he hates you a lot.&quot;)

It is also said by Lenore herself that she had always suspected there was a hinted romance going on between them, but never said anything.

===Mr. Gosh===
Mr. Gosh appears to be a human-sized sock puppet man with buttons as eyes, but he is a dead person with a bag over his head. He is madly and obsessively in love with Lenore. Even after being killed several times by Lenore, he keeps returning from the grave — often saying that he forgives her for killing him, as he supposed she always does it by &quot;accident&quot;. He is also unpopular among some of Lenore&#x27;s friends, especially Ragamuffin, who threatened to feed Mr. Gosh his own bowels if he bothered Lenore again in issue 12. The threat was carried out in the next panel.
Lenore&#x27;s repeated murders of Mr. Gosh include the &quot;Lawnmower Incident&quot;, in which she ran him over repeatedly (according to Mr. Gosh himself, 164 times) with a lawnmower, after he proposed to her. Some of his other injuries include: being poisoned, being set on fire, bashed with a shovel, stabbed in the head 6 times, and having his head explode, yet he still loves Lenore with all his heart. Lenore actually falls for him briefly when his hood is removed by Pooty. When Lenore realizes who he is, well, more than his heart is broken. Beneath his hood his head is rotten and causes all who look upon it to vomit, except Lenore; she finds Mr. Gosh much more attractive without his hood. This could be his &#x27;true form&#x27; or it could be due to the &#x27;lawnmower incident&#x27;.
It is revealed in volume 2, issue 2 that he inherited a cupcake castle, which he used to live in before he moved to be closer to Lenore.

In issue 2 Volume 2, after finally having been rejected far enough and realizing how over-compulsive his advances on Lenore were, Mr. Gosh eventually fled to his cupcake castle in hopes of distancing himself from her, and trying to make a new start to move on with his life. (But, of course, not before letting Lenore in on the word of his inheritance). Once there, Lenore soon followed, and while trying to just forget she had even existed so he could finally live with a peace of mind, he was indirectly forced to take her in for a tour of his new home. After being utterly taken by all of the wealth (in sweets and toys) her ex-stalker possessed, she weakly attempted to convince him, the very second after they walked into the castle&#x27;s vast &quot;Hall of Toys&quot;, that she was in love with him after all, and even &#x27;agreed&#x27; to marry without a pre-nup. Although Mr. Gosh could spot-on see through her plan, even admitting he did straight to her, once she held his hand, his only first reaction was to feel incredibly sad, but still acknowledged that she was trying to trick him. So, in order to get rid of this feeling once and for all, he took Lenore and Ragamuffin outside, along with a good amount of TNT, and told her that if she loved him, even if his entire castle blew up, to stay where she was. After he pushed the lever down on the explosives, and his enheritance had been completely destroyed, he looked over to what he thought to be Lenore, and had a moment of pure happiness and total excitement. Which, is actually pretty heartbreaking to read, when he then discovers moments later that it&#x27;s nothing more than a cardboard cut-out of her. (signaling that she left in the blink of an eye. Probably before he even destroyed the castle).

Gosh&#x27;s current whereabouts are unknown, but due to his presence on the cover of Issue #11, Volume 2, he may or may not appear once again in the climax of Volume 2.

===Taxidermy===
Taxidermy is Lenore&#x27;s odd-looking neighbor, who claims that his strange appearance is a &#x27;medical condition&#x27;. As his name suggests, his very first appearance in the comics had him looking like a tall, emaciated, suit-wearing deer with a stitched-up head, and he even had hooves for hands. He later (and currently) takes on the appearance of a human with a rotting, taxidermied deer head. The latter design was also adopted for the flash cartoon. Despite his rather ghastly appearance, Taxidermy is a mostly benevolent character and very much an intellectual.
He has a little pet named Malakai, confirmed to be a taxidermy form by Roman Dirge on the SpookyLand forums. Taxidermy also leads a horde of taxidermied animals. The horde appears occasionally to assist Lenore and her friends against their enemies. Taxidermy was set to have his own full color 32-page comic, but Roman Dirge gave up on it after 9 pages. According to him, it is sitting in a box just waiting to be finished.

From Volume II #8, Taxidermy&#x27;s back story and history are revealed dating back to Ancient Egypt. Taxidermy, named Taxen Ra, punished parents who inflicted abuse on their offspring and their demise depended on whatever form of abuse took place. Taxidermy was imprisoned as a result for taking on the Egyptian gods but was later discovered by an archaeologist who accidentally released him. Taxidermy was dubbed as &#x27;The Orphanage&#x27; by the press, for the many killings of children&#x27;s parents, including Lenore&#x27;s, which was revealed in issue 9, Volume 2. He left gifts and notes for every child he assisted and was never captured.

He lives in a cabin just behind Lenore&#x27;s house and assists her when needed.

Dirge also has a life-sized 7 ft Taxidermy in his living room that he along with a friend built in 2004 on a mannequin. During his Comic Con 2011 panel, Dirge told of how the head of the Taxidermy has become less stiff over time as the head is removable for the statue to be moved around. This resulted in the head turning unexpectedly during a video game session and scaring him and a friend. Comic Con &#x27;04 also resulted in Taxidermy&#x27;s head almost being stolen by a passer-by when Dirge had placed it on the table after the signing had finished. Luckily a member of the staff had seen this and got the head back.

===Muffin Monster===
The Muffin Monster is a dark green-coloured creature who made his first appearance in issue #5 at Lenore&#x27;s tea party. Not much is known about him except that he likes muffins which seem to give him gas. He dies in an issue titled The Creepig Creeping, killed by the titular Creepig. Lenore insists that he will be fine and attend her tea party, and he seemingly does, but is revealed to simply be a propped-up corpse.

===Kitty===
Lenore often carries a dead kitten with her. The kittens weren&#x27;t dead when she got them, but she accidentally kills every kitty she takes care of. At one point, she is confronted by the spirit of &quot;Kitty #12&quot; about her cruel behaviour towards animals. She attempts to justify her actions by claiming that her victims were evil. In the process she accidentally kills a bunny in a fan claiming that it looked hot. She had planned to get a weasel, but it was &quot;too fast&quot;.

===The Spam Witch===
She first appears in installment #12 of the Lenore comic series. She is summoned by Pooty Applewater to help them defeat the Zombie Nazi hordes. Pooty refers to her, saying &quot;That&#x27;s It. I&#x27;m calling in The Spam Witch.&quot; He then holds up an object resembling a key or a bottle opener. The Spam Witch appears in a light blue cloud of stars. She is naked, save for a traditional, black witch&#x27;s hat; she is an odd pinkish color and sort of square in shape; she rides a broom, which she is never seen off of; also on the broom is a small black cat with yellow eyes, who is never seen saying or doing anything. 
The Spam Witch and Pooty Applewater have an awkward exchange implying a past intimate relationship which did not resolve well. She gives Pooty a spell book to help them close the door to Heck. She then flies off, crashing into the cellar, and is supposedly eaten by a pack of dogs. 
The Spam Witch reappears in Chapter Two of Purple Nurples, Wrath of the Creepig. Pooty summons The Spam Witch and Lenore summons Herman Von Ficklefrog (a frog in a bowler hat), the two appear in light blue poofs, then proceed to make out in front of Lenore, Pooty, and Ragamuffin. The Spam Witch is instructed by Pooty to enact Plan 66. She casts a spell on the Creepig, saying, &quot;Maniratoo Shampup-Kiss.&quot; Effectively neutralizing the threat by shrinking the Creepig to such a size that it will never be able to destroy Lenore, not matter how hard it tries. The Spam Witch is then involved in a celebratory tea party.

<text>Havelock North () is a town in the Hawke&#x27;s Bay region of the North Island of New Zealand, situated less than 2 km south-east of the city of Hastings. It was a borough for many years until the 1989 reorganisation of local government saw it merged into the new Hastings District, and it is now administered by the Hastings District Council.

== Overview ==

The suburb, known locally as &quot;the village&quot;, is situated on the Heretaunga Plains, less than 2 km to the south-east of Hastings. It is surrounded by numerous orchards and vineyards, and its industry is based around its fruit and wine production, and a horticultural research centre. The fertile soils that lie between Havelock North and Hastings has prevented urban sprawl linking them together. Havelock North itself is primarily residential and rural-residential housing, with only a relatively small and compact industrial and commercial centre. As a result, a large majority of its 15,000 residents commute each morning to the nearby cities (Hastings or Napier) for work.

Havelock North is generally hilly, and small gullies have been formed by the creeks and streams flowing from higher ground, resulting in a small amount of inaccessible or steep land which is converted into forests, parks or reserves, giving the image of naturally having many bushes and trees. This is due to the town being situated at the base of the prominent landmark Te Mata Peak, a 399-metre outcrop, which according to local Māori legend is the body of the giant Te Mata o Rongokako, and the depression in the land visible behind his head according to the myth is where he tried to bite through the mountain range which filled his stomach turning him to stone.

Both Hastings and Havelock North obtain water from secure confined aquifer systems. The Te Mata aquifer that feeds Havelock North is very similar to Hastings in quality, but has slightly elevated calcium levels. Hastings is situated directly over the Heretaunga Plains aquifer system.

== History ==

Havelock North was founded as a planned Government settlement following the purchase in 1858, from Māori owners, of land previously known as &#x27;Karanema&#x27;s Reserve&#x27;. The original village was laid out in 1860, taking its name from Sir Henry Havelock, who was involved in the suppression of the Indian Uprising, thus keeping with the local habit of naming towns after prominent men from Imperial India. Its founders originally envisaged a larger town for the site, but when the Wellington–Napier rail line went through the area in 1874 it took a direct route some distance from Havelock North, and Hastings became a more logical choice for residents.

In the early 1800s, the local Karamu Stream was part of the much larger Ngaruroro River system. It was termed the &quot;River Plassey&quot;, the same name also being applied to a street in the village after the battle of Plassey of 1757 near Calcutta. Early survey plans of Havelock North show ferry landings where boats would sail up and down the river to collect and deliver supplies. This practice was phased out in the 1880s, when a number of large floods diverted the Ngaruroro River to its current course further north away from Havelock North. Later, during the 1931 earthquake, a bridge over the Karamu was completely destroyed.

Like a number of North Island towns, Havelock North has grown larger than its South Island namesake, Havelock, in the Marlborough Sounds.

Havelock North was the centre for Havelock Work, a quasi-religious movement based at a temple of the Stella Matutina magical order, which followed the early twentieth century teachings of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The building housing the temple survives today as Whare Ra.

From 12 to 29 August 2016 the town experienced New Zealand&#x27;s largest recorded outbreak of waterborne disease. Campylobacter entered the town&#x27;s water supply after run off from a nearby sheep farm entered the Brookvale boreholes following heavy rain. Of the town&#x27;s 13,000 residents, 5,500 fell ill, 45 were hospitalised and four died.

== Demographics ==
Havelock North covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.

Using that boundary, Havelock North had a population of 14,331 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 1,164 people (8.8%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 2,109 people (17.3%) since the 2006 census. There were 5,505 households, comprising 6,564 males and 7,770 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.84 males per female, with 2,763 people (19.3%) aged under 15 years, 1,791 (12.5%) aged 15 to 29, 5,943 (41.5%) aged 30 to 64, and 3,840 (26.8%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 91.0% European/Pākehā, 10.0% Māori, 1.3% Pacific peoples, 3.5% Asian, and 2.1% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 20.8, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 46.5% had no religion, 43.5% were Christian, 0.6% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.5% were Hindu, 0.5% were Muslim, 0.5% were Buddhist and 1.7% had other religions.

<doc id="579089" wikidata="Q1274040" url="?curid=579089" title="ECAC Hockey">
<text>ECAC Hockey is one of the six conferences that compete in NCAA Division I ice hockey. The conference used to be affiliated with the Eastern College Athletic Conference, a consortium of over 300 colleges in the eastern United States. This relationship ended in 2004; however, the ECAC abbreviation was retained in the name of the hockey conference. ECAC Hockey is the only ice hockey conference with identical memberships in both its women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s divisions. 

Cornell University has won the most ECAC men&#x27;s hockey championships with 13, followed by Harvard at 11, and Quinnipiac, which joined the league in 2005, with seven. ECAC Hockey teams have won 10 NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey Championships, most recently in 2023.

==History==
ECAC Hockey was founded in 1961 as a loose association of college hockey teams in the Northeast. 

Cornell won the first NCAA championship for ECAC Hockey in 1967 in 4-1 victory over fellow ECAC Hockey team Boston University.

The Big Red won their second title in 1970 to complete the first and thus far only undefeated campaign in NCAA Division I men&#x27;s ice hockey history, this time with a 6-4 victory over Clarkson.

ECAC Hockey completed back-to-back titles when Boston University won the 1971 championship with a 4-2 victory over Minnesota. The Terriers then made it two in a row for their school and three straight for ECAC Hockey when they repeated as champions in 1972 with a 4-0 victory over Cornell.

Boston University won their third title in 1978 with a 5-3 victory over Boston College, another ECAC Hockey member at that time.

In June 1983, concerns that the Ivy League schools were potentially leaving the conference and disagreements over schedule length versus academics caused Boston University, Boston College, Providence, Northeastern and New Hampshire to decide to leave the ECAC to form what would become Hockey East, which began play in the 1984–85 season. By that fall, Maine also departed the ECAC for the new conference. 

This left the ECAC with twelve teams (Army, Brown, Clarkson, Colgate, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton, RPI, St. Lawrence, Vermont, and Yale). Army would stay in the conference until the end of the 1990–91 season, at which point they became independent (they now play in Atlantic Hockey) and were replaced by Union College. Vermont left the ECAC for Hockey East at the end of the 2004–05 season, and were replaced in the conference by Quinnipiac.

RPI won its second national championship, and first as a member of ECAC Hockey when it defeated Providence of the newly formed Hockey East, 2-1 at the 1985 championship tournament. The Engineers previously won in 1954 as a member of the Tri-State League.

Harvard won its first and thus-far only NCAA Division I Hockey Championship when the Crimson topped Minnesota, 4-3 in overtime at the 1989 Tournament.

After seven titles and multiple Frozen Four representatives in the preceding 23-year period, ECAC Hockey suffered through a 23-year drought before Yale won its first title at the 2013 Tournament with a 4-0 victory over first-time finalists Quinnipiac. The 2013 Tournament was also unique in that with Quinnipiac defeating fellow ECAC Hockey school Union to advance to the Frozen Four before losing to Yale in the final, the only teams to defeat an ECAC school at the Tournament were other schools from ECAC Hockey.

The Dutchmen gained a measure of revenge when it won the 2014 Championship with a 7-4 victory over Minnesota.

After finishing runner up again in 2016, Quinnipiac finally broke through to win their first title at the 2023 Tournament with a 3-2 overtime victory over Minnesota.

The ECAC began sponsoring an invitational women&#x27;s tournament in 1985. ECAC teams began playing an informal regular season schedule in the 1988–89 season, with the conference officially sponsoring women&#x27;s hockey beginning in the 1993–94 season. ECAC teams won two of the three pre-NCAA American Women&#x27;s College Hockey Alliance national championships, New Hampshire winning in 1998 and Harvard in 1999.

The ECAC was the only Division I men&#x27;s hockey conference that neither gained nor lost members during the major conference realignment in 2011 and 2012 that followed the Big Ten Conference&#x27;s announcement that it would launch a men&#x27;s hockey league in the 2013–14 season.

==Membership==
There are 12 member schools in the ECAC. Since the 2006–07 season, all schools have participated with men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams, making ECAC Hockey the only Division I hockey conference with a full complement of teams for both sexes.

===Ivy League Teams===
Six Ivy League universities with Division I ice hockey programs are members of ECAC Hockey. Those schools are: Harvard University, Dartmouth College, Cornell University, Yale University, Princeton University, and Brown University. Columbia University does not currently have a varsity intercollegiate ice hockey program. Penn supported an intercollegiate varsity hockey program in the past and was an ECAC Hockey member from 1966 to 1978 before the team was disbanded. The Ivy school that has the best record against other Ivy opponents in regular season ECAC games is crowned the Ivy League ice hockey champion. The Ivy League schools require their teams to play seasons that are about three weeks shorter than those of the other schools in the league. Thus, they enter the league schedule with fewer non-conference warm-up games. Harvard competes in the annual Beanpot Tournament.

== Men&#x27;s regular season champion==
The Cleary Cup, named for former Harvard player and coach Bill Cleary since 2001, is awarded to the team with the best record in league games at the end of the regular–season. There is no tie–breaking procedure should two or more teams end the season with the same record and the trophy is shared. A tie breaking procedure is applied to determine the top seed in the ECAC conference tournament. The Cleary Cup winner is not given any special consideration in the NCAA tournament as the ECAC awards its automatic bid to the winner of the ECAC tournament.

==Awards==

===Men&#x27;s===
At the conclusion of each regular season schedule the coaches of each ECAC team vote which players they choose to be on the two to four All-Conference teams: first team and second team (rookie team starting in 1987–88 and third team beginning in 2005–06). Additionally they vote to award up to 7 individual trophies to an eligible player at the same time. ECAC Hockey also awards a Conference Tournament Most Outstanding Player as well as an All-Tournament Team, which are voted on at the conclusion of the conference tournament. Three awards have been bestowed every year that ECAC has been in operation while the &#x27;Best Defensive Defenseman&#x27; was retired from 1967–68 thru 1991–92
and the All-Tournament team was discontinued from 1973 thru 1988.

===Individual awards===


==NCAA Records==
* In 2000, St. Lawrence University won the second longest game in NCAA tournament history. St. Lawrence defeated Boston University in quadruple overtime by a score of 3–2. Currently, this game is the fifth longest game in NCAA division I history.
* On March 4, 2006, Union College played host to the longest NCAA men&#x27;s ice hockey game in NCAA history. In Game 2 of the first round of the 2006 ECACHL Tournament (best of three series) between Yale University and Union, Yale won 3–2 1:35 into the 5th overtime. Overall, the game took 141:35 to decide the winner.
* On March 11, 2010, Quinnipiac defeated Union College 3–2. The game, which lasted 150 minutes and 22 seconds, set a new record for the longest hockey game in NCAA history. The record lasted until March 6, 2015 when a Hockey East playoff game between UMass and Notre Dame lasted just over a minute longer.
* Cornell University recorded the only undefeated and untied season for a Division I NCAA champion in 1970.

<text>H P Bulmer Limited, trading as Bulmers, is a cider-making company founded in 1887 in Hereford, England.
The company&#x27;s two principal brands are its own Bulmers cider, which is sold worldwide, and Strongbow, which is sold across Europe, the US &amp; Canada, Oceania and East Asia. The company is owned by Heineken N.V. HP Bulmer makes 65% of the five hundred million litres of cider sold annually in the United Kingdom and the bulk of the UK&#x27;s cider exports. 
The firm&#x27;s primary competitor is the Irish C&amp;C Group and its Magners brand (which holds the licence to the Bulmers name within the Republic of Ireland only). Also brewed in Clonmel, co. Tipperary, Republic of Ireland.

==History==
===Formation===
The founder was Henry Percival &quot;Percy&quot; Bulmer, the twenty-year-old son of the rector at Credenhill, the Reverend Charles H. Bulmer and his wife Mary. He is said to have taken his mother&#x27;s advice to make a career in food or drink, &quot;because neither ever go out of fashion&quot;.

Using apples from the orchard at his father&#x27;s rectory and an old stone press on the farm next door, Percy Bulmer made the first cider, upon which the family fortune would be made.

In 1889, on leaving King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, his elder brother Fred (Edward Frederick Bulmer), turned down the offer of a post as tutor to the children of the King of Siam to join Percy in his fledgling cider business.

With a £1,760 loan from their father, the brothers bought an field just outside the city and built their first cider mill. It was little more than a barn compared to the huge modern stainless-steel computer-controlled cider-making plant that has grown up on a site nearby.

Cider-making was then an unpredictable activity, the natural fermentation process being achieved by yeast contained within apples; this meant that the cider often became sour. It was a college friend of Fred&#x27;s, Dr Herbert Durham, who, in the 1890s, isolated a wild yeast to create the first pure cider yeast culture, which would ensure that fermentations were consistent. This was the start of commercial cider-making.

Bulmers was first granted the Royal Warrant in 1911 and continues today as Cider Maker to His Majesty the King. It was incorporated as a private company on 27 June 1918. It described its cider as &quot;The White Wine of England&quot;.

Percy Bulmer died in 1919, aged 52.

Strongbow was brought in from 1960.

===Public company===
Shares were offered in the company on the Stock Exchange on 7 December 1970. At this point, it was the world&#x27;s largest producer of cider.

==21st century==
In 2003, the company was bought for £278 million by Scottish &amp; Newcastle (S&amp;N) with the loss of some 200 jobs initially. In 2008, S&amp;N was bought for £7.8 billion by the Heineken group. Its Australia and New Zealand business interests were sold to Australian brewer Foster&#x27;s. Bulmers now survives only as a brand name, with operations in Hereford scaled back considerably, principally producing cider. Apart from the 200 initial mainly administrative jobs lost in 2003 after the initial S&amp;N merger, more losses were announced in 2008 when bottling ceased, although after the last batch of 65 job cuts it was pledged that there would be site production and investment of around £7.5m, including a second can line to be installed by 2011.

In 2006, the company relaunched Bulmers Original in the UK, a premium packaged cider aimed at the &quot;served over ice&quot; market, which grew in popularity. Bulmers Original is a 4.5% ABV cider sold primarily in pint (568 ml) bottles, but also on draught, in 1 litre bottles and in a 500 ml can. In 2007, the Bulmers range was joined by Bulmers Pear cider, and in Spring 2008 by Bulmers Light, with the same ABV as the Original but with 30% fewer calories. However, this was delisted a year later.

Amongst the other brands produced by Bulmers is Jacques, a 5.5% ABV cider. This is available in Fruit De Bois (cider with cherry, raspberry and blackcurrant flavours) and Jacques Orchard Fruits, launched in 2008.

In 2010, a limited edition Summer Blend of Bulmers was made, combining apple and pear flavours, and another limited edition version of Bulmers using specially selected red Katy Apples which are allowed to fully ripen in the orchards before harvesting, named Red Apple.

In 2011, Bulmer&#x27;s released the limited edition Crisp Blend, made from sharper tasting apples, delivering a crisp and slightly drier flavour than the Original. Bulmers also rebranded themselves with a new look and new bottles.

The Bulmers naming tradition dates back to the early 1900s (at the time these were Bulmers 1 through to 8). They also number-coded the different varieties, with Original No.9, Pear No.10 and Crisp Blend No.15. At the same time, No.17, Red Berry and Lime, was introduced

As of 2022, the main Bulmers brand has largely fallen out of favour with the public, with only the Original and Red Berry and Lime flavours available in the UK.

==Structure==
Apples for the cider are grown in England and France. In 2014, it was reported that Bulmers takes 90 per cent of its apples from orchards in Herefordshire.

<doc id="579095" wikidata="Q600377" url="?curid=579095" title="Near Field Infrared Experiment">
<text>The Near Field Infrared Experiment (NFIRE) was a satellite that was proposed and developed by the Missile Defense Agency, a division of the United States Department of Defense. It was launched atop a Minotaur rocket, from Wallops Island, at 06:48 GMT on 24 April 2007. Though primarily designed to gather data on exhaust plumes from rockets, the satellite was also intended to contain a kill vehicle similar to kinds intended for the Strategic Defense Initiative. A missile was then to be fired at and nearly miss the instrumented kill vehicle. This feature was later removed.

NFIRE was funded by $44 million in FY2004. In 2004, the United States House of Representatives instructed the Missile Defense Agency, MDA, to remove the kill vehicle from the planned 2006 NFIRE launch, approving $68 million in FY2005 subject to that condition.
The Senate Appropriations Committee reviewing the NFIRE program, however, urged the MDA to return the missile defense interceptor (kill vehicle) to the originally scheduled test, despite the controversial perception of this leading to the deployment of weapons in space. The committee, which approved $13.7 million for the NFIRE program in FY06, told the MDA to &quot;complete development and mission integration of the deployable NFIRE Kill Vehicle.&quot;

The MDA removed the kill vehicle portion of the planned test, saying it posed a risk of technical failure, and replaced it with a laser communications payload from Tesat-Spacecom.

NFIRE reentered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere on November 4, 2015.

<doc id="579097" wikidata="Q272184" url="?curid=579097" title="Henryk Wieniawski">
<text>Henryk Wieniawski (; 10 July 183531 March 1880) was a Polish virtuoso violinist, composer and pedagogue, who is regarded amongst the most distinguished violinists in history. His younger brother Józef Wieniawski and nephew Adam Tadeusz Wieniawski were also accomplished musicians, as was his daughter Régine, who became a naturalised British subject upon marrying into the peerage and wrote music under the name Poldowski.

==Life==

===Early life===
Henryk Wieniawski was born in Lublin, in present-day Poland. His father, Tobiasz Pietruszka né Wolf Helman, was the son of a Jewish barber named Herschel Meyer Helman, from Lublin&#x27;s Jewish neighborhood of Wieniawa. Wolf Helman later changed his name to Tadeusz Wieniawski, taking on the name of his neighborhood to blend into the Polish environment. Prior to obtaining his medical degree, he had converted to Catholicism. He married Regina Wolff, the daughter of a noted Jewish physician from Warsaw, and out of this marriage, Henryk was born.

Henryk&#x27;s talent for playing the violin was recognized early, and in 1843 he was accepted by the Paris Conservatoire taught by Lambert Massart, where special exceptions were made to admit him, as he wasn&#x27;t French and was only eight years old. He attended the Conservatoire from 1843 to 1846 and returned for another year in 1849. 

===Touring and teaching===
After graduation, he toured extensively and gave many recitals, where he was often accompanied by his brother Józef on piano. In 1847, he published his first opus, a &quot;Grand Caprice Fantastique&quot;, the start of a catalogue of 24 opus numbers.

When his engagement to Isabella Hampton was opposed by her parents, Wieniawski wrote &quot;Légende&quot;, Op. 17; this work helped her parents change their mind, and the couple married in 1860.

Wieniawski was a player in the Beethoven Quartet Society in London, where he also performed on viola.

At the invitation of Anton Rubinstein, Wieniawski moved to St. Petersburg, where he lived from 1860 to 1872, taught many violin students and led the Russian Musical Society&#x27;s orchestra and string quartet. From 1872 to 1874, Wieniawski toured the United States with Rubinstein. Wieniawski replaced Henri Vieuxtemps as violin professor at the Conservatoire Royal de Bruxelles in 1875.

===Decline and death===
During his residence in Brussels, Wieniawski&#x27;s health declined, and he often had to stop in the middle of his concerts. He started a tour of Russia in 1879 but was unable to complete it, and was taken to a hospital in Odessa after a concert. On 14 February 1880, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s patroness Nadezhda von Meck took him into her home and provided him with medical attention. His friends also arranged a benefit concert to help provide for his family. He died in Moscow a few weeks later from a heart attack and was interred in the Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw.

==Daughters==
His daughter Régine Wieniawski, born in Brussels the year before his death, also became a composer. She published her early works as &quot;Irène Wieniawska&quot;, but after marrying Sir Aubrey Dean Paul and becoming a British subject, she used the pseudonym &quot;Poldowski&quot;. Another daughter, Henriette, would go on to marry Joseph Holland Loring in 1904, who was among the victims of the Titanic disaster.

==Works==
Henryk Wieniawski was considered a violinist of great ability and wrote some very important works in the violin repertoire, including two technically demanding violin concertos, the second of which (in D minor, 1862) is more often performed than the first (in F-sharp minor, 1853). One assessment of violin etudes ranks Wieniawski&#x27;s &quot;Op. 10 L&#x27;École moderne: 10 Études-caprices&quot; just below the difficulty of the Paganini Caprices.

==Legacy==
Wieniawski was given a number of posthumous honors. His portrait appeared on a postage stamp of Poland in 1952 and again in 1957. A 100 zloty coin was issued in 1979 bearing his image.

What is commonly called the &quot;Russian bow hold&quot; is sometimes called the &quot;Wieniawski bow hold&quot;, as Wieniawski taught his students his own kind of very rigid bowing technique (like the Russian bow hold) that allowed him to play what he called a &quot;devil&#x27;s staccato&quot; with ease. This &quot;devil&#x27;s staccato&quot; was used to discipline students&#x27; technique.

The first violin competition named after Wieniawski took place in Warsaw in 1935. Ginette Neveu took first prize, David Oistrakh second, and Henri Temianka third. The International Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competition has been held every five years since 1952.

<text>Soccer is the fourth most popular sport in the United States behind American football, basketball, and baseball.

The United States Soccer Federation (USSF) governs most levels of soccer in the United States, including the national teams, professional leagues, and amateur leagues, being the highest soccer authority in the country. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) governs most colleges; secondary schools are governed by state-level associations, with the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) setting the rules at that level. The match regulations are generally the same between the three governing bodies although there are many subtle differences.

, over 24.4 million people play soccer in the United States. In 2017, Gallup reported that soccer was the third-most watched team sport in the U.S., behind only basketball and American football. The popularity of the sport in the U.S. has been growing since the late 1960s and received a significant boost when the United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup.

The highest-level of men&#x27;s professional soccer in the U.S. is Major League Soccer (MLS). The league&#x27;s predecessor was the major professional North American Soccer League (NASL), which existed from 1968 until 1984. MLS began to play in 1996 with 10 teams and has grown to 29 teams (26 in the United States and 3 in Canada), with further expansion planned to at least 30 teams. MLS has the most teams of any first-division professional soccer league in the world. The MLS season runs from February to November, with the regular-season winner awarded the Supporters&#x27; Shield and the post-season winner awarded the MLS Cup. With an average attendance of over 20,000 per game, MLS has the third-highest average attendance of any sports league in the U.S. after the National Football League (NFL) and Major League Baseball (MLB), and is the seventh-highest attended professional soccer league worldwide. MLS uses franchised clubs similar to other major U.S. sports leagues, rather than the promotion and relegation model used for club soccer in other countries such as the United Kingdom.

The first women&#x27;s professional soccer league in the U.S. formed after the success of the 1999 Women&#x27;s World Cup. The Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association (WUSA) ran from 2001 to 2003 and featured many of the World Cup stars, including Mia Hamm, Michelle Akers and Brandi Chastain. Its successor Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer (WPS) ran from 2009 to 2012. Currently, the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL) is the top professional league in the country; it was formed in 2012 with play starting in 2013. The NWSL season runs from spring to early fall (typically April – October).

U.S. soccer fans follow the U.S. national teams in international competition. The 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup final drew a record 26.7 million viewers, greater than final games of the 2014 World Series or the 2015 NBA Finals, and the 2010 Men&#x27;s World Cup final drew 26.5 million viewers. The women&#x27;s national team has won four Women&#x27;s World Cup titles and five gold medals at the Summer Olympics and the men&#x27;s national team played in every World Cup from 1990 to 2014 and returned to the World Cup in 2022.

==Terminology==
In the United States, the sport of association football is mainly referred to as &quot;soccer&quot;, as the term &quot;football&quot; is primarily used to refer to the sport of American football.

==History==
===Beginnings and decline: 1850s–1930s===
There has been some debate about the origins of modern soccer in the United States. It has long been held that the modern game entered the States through Ellis Island in the 1860s. However, 2013 research has shown that soccer entered America through the port of New Orleans, as Irish, English, Scottish, Italian and German immigrants brought the game with them. It was in New Orleans that many of the first games of soccer in America were held. The origins of the game in general trace back to ancient Greece, Rome, Egypt, or China. It is difficult to say for sure which country was the true origin.

Oneida Football Club has been named as the first association football club in the United States but there is still discussion on what rules the club used, and it broke up within the space of a few years. According to &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, the club is often credited with inventing the &quot;Boston Game&quot;, which allowed players to both kick a round ball along the ground, and to pick it up and run with it. On the other hand, in 1869, Princeton and Rutgers played the first intercollegiate &quot;football&quot; game. Although each team had 25 players, the use of a soccer ball and the rules based on the 1863 London Football Association laws arguably make it the first college soccer match and the birth of soccer in the United States.

Nevertheless, the earliest known game of organized soccer in the United States was played on October 11, 1866 in Waukesha, Wisconsin under the 1863 London Football Association laws.

The earliest examples of governance in the sport started in 1884 when the American Football Association (AFA) was incarnated. The AFA sought to standardize rules for the local soccer teams based in the Northeastern United States, particularly in northern New Jersey and southern New York state. By 1886, the AFA had spread in influence into Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.

Within a year of its founding, the AFA organized the first non-league cup in American soccer history, known as the American Cup. For the first dozen years, clubs from New Jersey and Massachusetts dominated the competition. It would not be until 1897 that a club from outside those two states won the American Cup. Philadelphia Manz brought the title to Pennsylvania for the first time. Due to conflicts within the AFA, the cup was suspended in 1899, and it was not resumed until 1906.

Early soccer leagues in the U.S. mostly used the name &quot;football&quot;, for example: the AFA (founded in 1884), the American Amateur Football Association (1893), the American League of Professional Football (1894), the National Association Foot Ball League (1895), and the Southern New England Football League (1914). Common confusion between the terms &quot;American football&quot; and &quot;association football&quot; eventually led to a more domestic widespread use of the term &quot;soccer&quot; with regard to association football. Originally seen as a British slang term for &quot;association&quot;, the use of &quot;soccer&quot; began appearing in the late 1910s and early 1920s. A noticeable example was the American Soccer League (ASL), which formed in 1919. The governing body of the sport in the U.S. did not have the word &quot;soccer&quot; in its name until 1945 when it became the United States Soccer Football Association. It did not drop the word &quot;football&quot; from its name until 1974, when it became the United States Soccer Federation, often going simply as U.S. Soccer.

In October 1911, a competing body, the American Amateur Football Association (AAFA) was created. The association quickly spread outside of the Northeast and created its own cup in 1912, the American Amateur Football Association Cup.

The conflicts within the AFA led to a movement to create a truly national body to oversee American soccer. In 1913, both the AAFA and AFA applied for membership in FIFA, the international governing body for soccer. Drawing on both its position as the oldest soccer organization and the status of the American Cup, the AFA argued that it should be the nationally recognized body. Later that year, the AAFA gained an edge over the AFA when several AFA organizations moved to the AAFA.
On April 5, 1913, the AAFA reorganized as the United States Football Association (USFA), presently known as the United States Soccer Federation. FIFA quickly granted a provisional membership and USFA began exerting its influence on the sport. This led to the establishment of the National Challenge Cup, which still exists as the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, that fall. The National Challenge Cup quickly grew to overshadow the American Cup. However, both cups were played simultaneously for the next ten years. Declining respect for the AFA led to the withdrawal of several associations from its cup in 1917. Further competition came in 1924 when USFA created the National Amateur Cup. That spelled the death knell for the American Cup. It played its last season in 1924.

During the days of the American Soccer League, the league was seen as widely popular, and considered to be the second-most popular sports league in the United States, only behind Major League Baseball. However, the &quot;soccer war&quot; between the USFA and ASL, combined with the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, led to the demise of the ASL in 1933, and the demise of the professional sport in the United States; however, the sport continued in amateur and semi-professional leagues. The national soccer team competed in the first two FIFA World Cups, managing to qualify for the semifinals of the first tournament and qualifying for the following one in Italy, where the U.S. team was knocked out in the first match by would-be world champions Italy.

===Re-emergence and growth: 1960s–today===

The prominence of college soccer increased with the NCAA sanctioning an annual men&#x27;s soccer championship, beginning in 1959 with the inaugural championship won by Saint Louis University.

Two professional soccer leagues were started in 1967, the United Soccer Association (USA) and the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL), which merged to form the North American Soccer League (NASL) in 1968. The NASL enjoyed a significant boost in popularity when the New York Cosmos signed Pelé to play for three seasons in 1975–77. The Cosmos drew large publicity throughout the late 1970s. Between 1977 and 1980, the Cosmos drew crowds of more than 60,000 on ten occasions, and over 70,000 on seven occasions (see Record attendances in United States club soccer). The NASL declined during the early 1980s and disbanded in 1984 amidst financial problems. The popularity of indoor soccer peaked in the 1980s, with both the NASL and the Major Indoor Soccer League operating indoor soccer leagues.

The 1970s and 1980s saw increased popularity of the college game. Women&#x27;s college soccer received a significant boost in 1972 with the passage of Title IX, which mandated equal funding for women&#x27;s athletic programs, leading to colleges forming NCAA-sanctioned women&#x27;s varsity teams. A men&#x27;s match between Saint Louis University and local rival SIU Edwardsville drew a college record 22,512 fans to Busch Stadium on October 30, 1980. By 1984, more colleges played soccer (532) than American football (505).

In 1967 there were 100,000 people playing soccer in the US; by 1984, that number had grown to over 4 million. Girls high school soccer experienced tremendous growth in playing numbers throughout the 1970s and 1980s—from 10,000 in 1976 to 41,000 in 1980, to 122,000 in 1990.

The soccer matches for the 1984 Summer Olympics were well attended. Five matches drew over 75,000 fans, and two soccer matches at the Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena, California, drew over 100,000 fans. These high attendance figures were one factor that FIFA took into consideration in 1988 when deciding to award the 1994 World Cup to the United States.

Interest in soccer within the United States continued to grow during the 1990s. This growth has been attributed in significant part to the FIFA World Cup being held in the United States for the first time in 1994. This won the sport more attention from both the media and casual sports fans. The tournament was successful, drawing an average attendance of 68,991, a World Cup record that still stands today. The 1994 World Cup drew record TV audiences in the U.S.

As part of the United States&#x27; bid to host the 1994 World Cup, U.S. Soccer pledged to create a professional outdoor league. Major League Soccer (MLS) launched in 1996, which helped develop American players in a way that was not possible without a domestic league. Many of these players competed in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, where the United States reached the quarterfinals, its best result in the modern era. The team qualified for seven consecutive World Cup tournaments between 1990 and 2014 before failing to qualify for the 2018 tournament, the first since 1986. The USMNT would return at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where they managed to repeat their performances of 2010 and 2014 editions.

The growth of the women&#x27;s game during the 1990s helped increase overall interest in soccer in the United States. The number of women&#x27;s college soccer teams increased from 318 in 1991 to 959 in 2009. Both the 1999 and 2003 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cups were held in the United States. The crowd of over 90,000 at the Rose Bowl for the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup Final remained the largest crowd in the world to witness any women&#x27;s sporting event for more than 20 years.

== Popularity ==
There are 4.2 million players (2.5 million male and 1.7 million female) registered with U.S. Soccer. , thirty percent of American households contain someone playing soccer, a figure second only to baseball.

Increasing numbers of Americans, having played the game in their youth, are now avid spectators. The annual ESPN sports poll has shown soccer as the fourth most popular team sport in the United States every year since overtaking hockey in 2006; as of 2011, 8.2% of Americans rank soccer as their favorite sport (compared to 3.8% for ice hockey). A 2012 Harris Interactive poll showed soccer to be the fifth favorite team sport, with 2% of Americans ranking soccer as their favorite (compared to 5% for ice hockey). A 2011 ESPN sports poll ranked soccer as the second most popular sport in the country for 12- to 24-year-olds. In 2013, Lionel Messi became the first soccer player ever to rank among the Top 10 most popular athletes in the U.S. in an ESPN poll, although he was not listed in the Top 10 in a Harris poll. A 2017 poll by Gallup found that soccer is nearly as popular as baseball with 7% of Americans saying it is their favorite sport, as opposed to 9% for baseball.

===Competitions and attendance===

Many soccer matches in the United States draw large crowds, particularly international matches. A 2014 International Champions Cup match between Real Madrid and Manchester United at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, Michigan had an attendance of 109,318, a record crowd for a U.S. soccer match.

The 2009 Gold Cup quarterfinal matches drew over 82,000 to Cowboys Stadium (now known as AT&amp;T Stadium). Between 2008 and 2011, the U.S. played three times in East Rutherford, New Jersey, drawing over 78,000 fans each game. The United States and Mexico national teams have been playing in front of crowds in excess of 60,000 in the U.S. in recent years.

Also in recent years, many top-division European clubs—such as English clubs Manchester United and Chelsea, and Spanish clubs Real Madrid and Barcelona—have spent portions of their pre-season summer schedule playing matches in the United States. These matches have been highly attended events for U.S. stadiums. The 2009 World Football Challenge drew large crowds around the country, and Chelsea&#x27;s four-game stint in the United States drew record crowds for a visiting foreign team.

Nations from other regions have decided to organize tournaments in the U.S., given the growing soccer market in the country. For example, the 2014 Copa Centroamericana, a soccer competition for countries from Central America, was held in the U.S., due to the commercial appeal of the U.S. soccer market. Similarly, the 2016 Copa América was also held in the U.S., marking the first time that tournament took place outside of South America. The U.S. was selected to host for financial reasons, because &quot;the market is in the United States, the stadiums are in the United States ... everything is in the United States&quot;.

Furthermore, several nations schedule friendly matches to be held in the U.S. against opponents other than the U.S. national team. For example, the Mexico national team usually schedules several friendlies in the U.S. each year against various opponents. The El Salvador national team also regularly plays friendlies in the U.S., often in the Washington, D.C. area, home to a large Salvadoran community. The Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia national teams also play matches in the U.S. This is due to the fact that the U.S. has more adequate venues for competitions.

The 2018 MLS cup final recorded an attendance of 73,019, beating the past record of 61,316 which was set in the 2002 cup final. At the time, this was the most-attended MLS game in history. The most recent attendance record for an MLS match was set on March 5, 2022, when 74,479 fans attended Charlotte FC&#x27;s inaugural home match at Bank of America Stadium. That record was subsequently broken on July 4, 2023 when a crowd of 82,110 attended an &quot;El Trafico&quot; derby between LA Galaxy and Los Angeles Football Club at the Rose Bowl.

===Regional popularity===

The popularity of the sport varies from region to region, and sometimes from city to city. Atlanta, Charlotte, and Seattle are known to draw stadium attendances of more than 35,000 frequently (with Atlanta drawing 70,000+ occasionally). Additionally, it has the highest city professional sports attendance per game in Portland and Orlando, albeit at just over 20,000 spectators; while Cincinnati drew tier 2 attendances comparable to 2. Bundesliga in Germany before getting invited to Major League Soccer.

In the rest of the United States, the situation varies. The sport has struggled to get a big break in New York City and Chicago, with the latter&#x27;s Chicago Fire FC having had the lowest average attendance in Major League Soccer in 2019 at 12,324. California is strongly represented with teams in most professional and semi-pro leagues, but lag behind in Major League Soccer attendance. In bigger states and cities (especially the Northeast and California), the international club game is far more popular than MLS or USL, both in terms of crowds and TV ratings.

Professional senior teams are almost non-existent in the Prairie and Rockie states north of Omaha (Sioux Falls Thunder FC in Sioux Falls, South Dakota play in the tier 4 National Premier Soccer League as of August 2023), and entirely non-existent in Hawaii. National under-23 collegiate amateur leagues and intrastate adult/junior leagues are held in those regions, however. In Alaska, the semi-pro &quot;Last Frontier Conference&quot; at approximately tier 5 forms part of United Premier Soccer League.

International club friendlies have frequently drawn more spectators than most US-based teams&#x27; league matches, including in areas not otherwise represented by major national clubs, e.g. Michigan and Maryland. The 2014 International Champions Cup match between Manchester United and Real Madrid drew 109,318 spectators to Michigan Stadium.

==Women&#x27;s professional soccer==
Women&#x27;s soccer in the United States has been played at the professional level since 2001. Women&#x27;s soccer has made a significant impact all over the U.S. They have gotten support, rejection, and discrimination, and have battled for equal rights in a male-dominated soccer environment.

=== WUSA (2001–2003) ===

As a result of the U.S. women&#x27;s national team&#x27;s (USWNT) first-place showing in the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, a seemingly viable market for the sport germinated.
Feeding on the momentum of their victory, the eight-team league formed in February 2000, the U.S. Soccer Federation approved membership of the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association (WUSA) as a sanctioned Division 1 women&#x27;s professional soccer league on August 18, 2000, and the league began playing its first season in April 2001. It would be the world&#x27;s first women&#x27;s soccer league in which all the players were paid as professionals.
The WUSA had previously announced plans to begin to play in 2001 in eight cities across the country, including: Atlanta, the Bay Area, Boston, New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, San Diego and Washington, D.C. The WUSA forged ahead on a cooperation agreement that would see the new league work side by side with Major League Soccer to help maximize the market presence and success of both Division I leagues.
The eight teams included the Atlanta Beat, Boston Breakers, Carolina Courage, New York Power, Philadelphia Charge, San Diego Spirit, San Jose CyberRays (called Bay Area CyberRays for 2001 season), and the Washington Freedom.

The WUSA played for three full seasons. The WUSA suspended operations, however, on September 15, 2003, shortly after the conclusion of the third season, due to financial problems and lack of public interest in the sport.

=== Post-WUSA (2004–2009) ===
With the WUSA on hiatus, the Women&#x27;s Premier Soccer League (WPSL) and the W-League regained their status as the premier women&#x27;s soccer leagues in the United States, and many former WUSA players joined those teams.

The Washington Freedom was the only WUSA team to continue operations after the league dissolved (although new versions of the Atlanta Beat and Boston Breakers formed in 2009) and eventually became a part of the W-League in 2006.

After the folding of WUSA, WUSA Reorganization Committee was formed in September 2003 that led to the founding of Women&#x27;s Soccer Initiative, Inc. (WSII), whose stated goal was &quot;promoting and supporting all aspects of women&#x27;s soccer in the United States&quot;, including the founding of a new professional league. Initial plans were to play a scaled-down version of WUSA in 2004. However, these plans fell through and instead, in June 2004, the WUSA held two &quot;WUSA Festivals&quot; in Los Angeles and Blaine, Minnesota, featuring matches between reconstituted WUSA teams in order to maintain the league in the public eye and sustain interest in women&#x27;s professional soccer. A planned full relaunch in 2005 also fell through. In June 2006, WSII announced the relaunch of the league for the 2008 season.

In December 2006, WSII announced that it reached an agreement with six owner-operators for teams based in Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Washington, D.C., and a then-unnamed city. In September 2007, the launch was pushed back from Spring of 2008 to 2009 to avoid clashing with 2007 Women&#x27;s World Cup and the 2008 Olympic Games and to ensure that all of the teams were fully prepared for long-term operations.

=== WPS (2009–2012) ===

The name for the new professional league, along with its logo, was announced on January 17, 2008. The league was to have its inaugural season in 2009, with seven teams, including the Washington Freedom, a former WUSA team. Twenty-one U.S. national team players were allocated to each of the seven teams in September 2008. Also in September, the league held the 2008 WPS International Draft.

Unlike WUSA, the WPS took &quot;a local, grassroots approach&quot;, and &quot;a slow and steady growth type of approach,&quot; In addition, the WPS attempted to have a closer relationship with Major League Soccer in order to cut costs.

Most teams considered the first season a moderate success, despite many losing more money than planned. However, most teams began to see problems in 2010. Overall attendance for 2010 was noticeably down from 2009, teams were struggling with financial problems, and the WPS changed leadership by the end of the season.

The success of the United States women&#x27;s national soccer team at the 2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup resulted in an upsurge in attendance league-wide as well as interest in new teams for the 2012 season. However, several internal organization struggles, including an ongoing legal battle with magicJack-owner Dan Borislow, and lack of resources invested in the league led to the suspension of 2012, announced in January 2012.

On May 18, 2012, the WPS announced that the league had officially ceased operations, having played for only three seasons.

=== WPSL Elite (2012) ===
By this time, the WPSL and W-League were the two semi-pro leagues in the United States and had sat under WUSA and the WPS until 2012. Upon the disbandment of the WPS, they once again regained their status as the premier women&#x27;s soccer leagues in the United States.

In response to the suspension and eventual end, of the WPS, the Women&#x27;s Premier Soccer League created the Women&#x27;s Premier Soccer League Elite (WPSL Elite) to support the sport in the United States. For the 2012 season, the league featured former WPS teams, Boston Breakers, Chicago Red Stars, and Western New York Flash, in addition to many WPSL teams. Six of the eight teams were considered fully professional.

Many members of the USWNT remained unattached for the 2012 season while others chose to play in the W-League instead of the WPSL Elite.

=== Modern-day leagues (2013–present) ===

==== NWSL (2013–present) ====
After the WPS folded in 2012, the United States Soccer Federation (USSF) announced a roundtable for the discussion of the future of women&#x27;s professional soccer in the United States. The meeting resulted in the planning of a new league set to launch in 2013 with 12–16 teams, taking from the WPS, the W-League, and the WPSL.

The league was officially announced by U.S. Soccer on November 21, 2012, with the Canadian Soccer Association (CSA) and Mexican Football Federation (FMF) also participating in the announcement. The league was ultimately called the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL). Teams in the NWSL are privately owned, but national federations are heavily involved in league financing and operations. All three federations initially paid salaries for many of their respective national team members. U.S. Soccer committed to funding up to 24 national team members, with the CSA committing to paying 16 players and FMF pledging support for 12 to 16 (ultimately 16). This freed each of the eight charter teams from having to pay salaries for up to seven players. In addition, U.S. Soccer hosts the new league&#x27;s front office, and is scheduling matches to avoid conflicts with international tournaments. Today, only U.S. Soccer and the CSA still provide support (including allocating players) to the NWSL; FMF and NWSL ended their relationship (presumably amicably) in 2017, when FMF launched its own national women&#x27;s league, Liga MX Femenil.

Four of the league&#x27;s charter teams had WPS ties—the Boston Breakers, Chicago Red Stars, a revival of the New Jersey–based Sky Blue FC, and the Western New York Flash. The other four were in Kansas City, Portland, Seattle, and Washington, D.C., with the Portland team being run by the Portland Timbers. The league added its second MLS-linked team in 2014 with the entry of the Houston Dash, run by the Houston Dynamo and playing in the Dynamo&#x27;s stadium. A third NWSL team, FC Kansas City, announced a partnership with Sporting Kansas City in 2015; although the two clubs continued to be separately owned, FC Kansas City would use Sporting&#x27;s facilities for practices and home games. Another MLS-linked team joined the league in 2016 with the arrival of the Orlando Pride, operated by Orlando City SC.

The 2016–17 offseason saw the league&#x27;s first major relocation, with the Flash selling their NWSL franchise rights to the owner of North Carolina FC, then playing in the NASL and now in USL League One, who moved the NWSL team to the Research Triangle of North Carolina and relaunched it as the North Carolina Courage.

The NWSL became the first professional women&#x27;s league to reach more than eight teams with the addition of the Houston Dash and Orlando Pride (10 teams in the league in 2016 and 2017) and the first to sustain more than three years of operations. In 2017, A&amp;E Networks bought an equity stake in the league and broadcasts a game of the week on Lifetime and streams all games online via the go90 platform.

Following the 2017 season, FC Kansas City folded. Kansas City&#x27;s place in the NWSL was immediately filled by a new franchise operated by another MLS club, Real Salt Lake; the new team was unveiled shortly thereafter as Utah Royals FC. In January 2018, the league dropped to 9 teams with the demise of the Boston Breakers, which had been the only team to have participated in every previous season of U.S. top-flight professional women&#x27;s soccer.

The Utah Royals ceased operations at the end of the 2020 season due to the fallout from a racism controversy surrounding Real&#x27;s owner; the NWSL franchise rights were awarded to a Kansas City ownership group that had no members in common with the former FC Kansas City ownership. The new Kansas City team played in the 2021 season under the placeholder name of Kansas City NWSL before announcing its permanent identity of Kansas City Current at the end of that season.

The NWSL membership announced in October 2019 the entry of a Louisville team in 2021. The team, ultimately unveiled as Racing Louisville FC, is owned and operated by USL Championship side Louisville City FC.

The most recent teams to start NWSL play are two California teams that played their first season in 2022—the Los Angeles–based Angel City FC and San Diego Wave FC. Two more NWSL teams are scheduled to start or resume play in 2024. First, the new ownership of Real Salt Lake exercised an option to revive Utah Royals FC; the team would be revived without the &quot;FC&quot; in its branding. This was soon followed by the announcement of a new team for the San Francisco Bay Area, soon unveiled as Bay FC. A new team in Boston, unrelated to the Breakers, has been announced for 2026.

=== USL Super League (2022–present) ===

Originally slated to begin play in 2022 as a D-2 league, the USL Super League began play in 2024 as a top-division league with eight inaugural members. Unique to most other soccer leagues, the Super League follows the global soccer calendar, starting in the fall and taking a break in the winter before resuming in the spring.

=== Lower divisions ===
==== W-League, WPSL, and UWS ====
Originally called the United States Interregional Women&#x27;s League, the W-League was formed in 1995 to provide a professional outlet for many of the top female soccer players in the country. Starting as the Western Division of the W-League, the Women&#x27;s Premier Soccer League (WPSL) broke away and formed its own league in 1997 and had its inaugural season in 1998. Both the W-League and the WPSL were considered the premier women&#x27;s soccer leagues in the United States at the time but eventually fell to a &quot;second-tier&quot; level upon the formation of the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association.

The W-League grew as large as 41 teams in 2008, but its membership fell rapidly from that point on, and the league folded after its 2015 season. Of the 18 teams that competed in the final season of the W-League, seven joined the WPSL, and eight formed a new second-level league, United Women&#x27;s Soccer (UWS). This new league ultimately launched in 2016 with 11 teams, including six of the founding members (the other two, both Canadian teams, were denied licenses by the Canadian Soccer Association). UWS expanded to 21 teams, including one new Canadian side, in 2017.

==== USL W League ====
The United Soccer League has since announced the establishment of a full development pathway for women&#x27;s soccer. First, in 2022, the USL launched the USL W League (not to be confused with the former W-League), a third-level semi-pro league. The W League launched with 44 teams. 

==Men&#x27;s professional soccer==


===Major League Soccer===


Major League Soccer (MLS) is the professional first-division league in the United States. As of the current 2025 season, it has 30 teams — 27 in the U.S. and 3 in Canada. MLS is currently the largest first-division professional soccer league in the world by number of teams. With careful cost controls and the construction of soccer-specific stadiums, some MLS clubs became profitable for the first time in the mid-2000s, and &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine found that three clubs were already valued at $40 million or more, with the Los Angeles Galaxy worth $100 million. 
The establishment of the Designated Player Rule in 2007 has led to the signings of international superstars such as David Beckham, Thierry Henry, and Lionel Messi.

Major League Soccer has been in an expansion phase, going from 10 teams in 2005 to 30 teams today. The league&#x27;s 2007 and 2009 expansion to Toronto and Seattle, respectively, have proven highly successful, with league-leading ticket and merchandise sales, capped by sold-out attendances for friendlies against Real Madrid of Spain and Chelsea of England. In 2013, New York City FC agreed to pay a record $100 million expansion fee for the right to join MLS in 2015. This record was surpassed by the ownership groups of FC Cincinnati and a new Nashville team, which each paid $150 million to join MLS (FC Cincinnati in 2019 and Nashville in 2020). The same amount was paid as an effective entrance fee by a group that bought Columbus Crew SC in 2018, which led to that team&#x27;s previous operator receiving a new team in Austin, Texas that joined MLS in 2021. The league expanded to 27 teams with the addition of Austin FC in 2021 and 28 with Charlotte FC in 2022 (delayed from the original 2021 schedule), then St. Louis City SC in 2023 (delayed from 2022), and finally San Diego FC in 2025.

MLS average attendance has been steadily growing, from 13,756 in 2000 to 22,113 in 2017. MLS has drawn a higher per-game attendance than NBA basketball and NHL hockey every year since 2011. With an average attendance of over 20,000 per game, MLS has the third highest average attendance of any sports league in the U.S. after the National Football League (NFL) and Major League Baseball (MLB), and is the seventh highest attended professional soccer league worldwide.

Professional soccer has been less popular in the United States than most other parts of the world. Although MLS is also much younger than most other countries&#x27; first divisions, it is already the twelfth most-attended premier division in the world. MLS has announced its goal of developing into one of the top soccer leagues in the world by 2022.

Unlike club football leagues in other countries, Major League Soccer does not have promotion and relegation, and instead utilizes a franchise system similar to other professional sports leagues in the country. In addition, Major League Soccer operates as a single entity, meaning that all clubs are owned by the league, with club investor-operators holding shares in the league itself rather than owning their teams directly, and all players being centrally contracted. Major League Soccer has faced criticisms for this structure, as well as other deviations such as scheduling matches during time periods designated by the FIFA Calendar for international play (which can affect the quality of MLS matches taking place within, although the league had been working to reduce the number of matches during these windows). However, it has also been noted that the league&#x27;s salary caps have helped to discourage rampant spending, allowing for steadier long-term growth.

By 2012 the league had shown a marked improvement in its financial health. In November 2013, &quot;Forbes&quot; published a report that revealed that ten of the league&#x27;s nineteen teams earned an operating profit in 2012, while two broke even and seven had a loss. Forbes estimated that the league&#x27;s collective annual revenues were $494 million, and that the league&#x27;s collective annual profit was $34 million. Forbes valued the league&#x27;s franchises to be worth $103 million on average, almost three times as much as the $37 million average valuation in 2008. The Seattle Sounders FC franchise was named the most valuable at $175 million, a 483% gain over the $30 million league entrance fee it paid in 2009.

The trend in increased team values has continued with MLS teams seeing a strong 52% increase in franchise values from 2012 to 2014. In August 2015 &quot;Forbes&quot; updated its MLS franchise values with the most profitable team measuring $245 million and the least $105 million. The average value jumped from $103 to $157 million.

As of 2018 &quot;Forbes&quot; estimates Atlanta United FC are the most valuable MLS team, worth $330 million, while the Colorado Rapids are the lowest value, at $155 million. These valuations do not include the value of stadiums or training facilities owned by the respective clubs.

The North American Soccer League (NASL) repeatedly accused Major League Soccer of having a monopoly position being defended by the United States Soccer Federation, such as accusing the USSF of proposing to change the minimum criteria for a Division I league to include specifications that only MLS could currently meet, such as minimum stadium capacities and requiring at least 75% of teams to be in metropolitan areas with a population of at least 2 million.

===Second division===
Since the 2018 season, the second tier of North American soccer has been occupied by the USL Championship, rebranded from the United Soccer League after the 2018 season. This league received provisional sanctioning by U.S. Soccer before the 2018 season. The second iteration of the North American Soccer League had functioned at the second level under provisional status through the 2017 season, but more recent developments led to the effective demise of that league.

====NASL: Formation, instability, and demise====
The new North American Soccer League was formed in late 2009, with plans to launch in the 2010 season, by disgruntled team owners from the USL First Division, after Nike sold its stake in the latter league&#x27;s parent corporation, then known as the United Soccer Leagues and now as the United Soccer League (USL). U.S. Soccer refused to sanction either the First Division or the new NASL for 2010, and the two groups eventually agreed to unite for 2010 only under the banner of USSF Division 2, run directly by U.S. Soccer and including teams from both leagues. U.S. Soccer initially sanctioned the new NASL in November 2010, revoked its sanctioning in January 2011 due to financial issues surrounding the ownership of several teams, and re-sanctioned it in February 2011. The NASL launched in 2011 with eight teams—five on the U.S. mainland, one in Puerto Rico (a U.S. commonwealth that has its own national federation), and two in Canada. One of the Canadian teams left the NASL after the 2011 season to enter MLS; the league remained at eight teams for 2012 as San Antonio Scorpions FC joined NASL. In 2013, a new version of the New York Cosmos joined the NASL. Ottawa Fury FC and Indy Eleven joined in 2014. Three teams were set to join the league in 2015—Jacksonville Armada FC, Virginia Cavalry FC, and Oklahoma City FC—but only the Jacksonville team actually began play. Virginia Cavalry is no longer listed as a future team on the NASL website; Oklahoma City FC was bought by the owner of Spanish club Rayo Vallecano and rebranded as Rayo OKC, which began play in 2016. Two other teams, Miami FC and Puerto Rico FC, were launched in 2016, with Miami starting play in the league&#x27;s spring season and Puerto Rico in the fall season. At the same time, the Atlanta Silverbacks self-relegated to the lower-level National Premier Soccer League and the San Antonio Scorpions folded. After the 2016 season, Minnesota United left for MLS, Rayo OKC folded, and Ottawa Fury FC and the Tampa Bay Rowdies left for the USL.

Since then, the NASL has experienced even more instability. The San Francisco Deltas joined for the 2017 season but folded after that season despite winning the league&#x27;s title. During that offseason, after the USSF pulled the NASL&#x27;s provisional Division II status due to not meeting its criteria, the NASL filed an antitrust lawsuit against the USSF. The NASL accused the USSF of colluding with Major League Soccer to protect its status as the sole top-flight soccer league in the United States, citing a relationship under which MLS clubs are required to maintain affiliations or co-owned reserve teams in the USL. The suit was not supported by all of the league&#x27;s teams; FC Edmonton was not involved in the action (and would cease professional operations due to the uncertainty stemming from the lawsuit), and North Carolina FC did not support the suit. While the league added two teams for 2018 in California United FC and San Diego 1904 FC, it lost four teams—the aforementioned San Francisco Deltas, FC Edmonton and NCFC, plus Indy Eleven; the last two of these teams moved to the USL. Due to the ongoing litigation, the NASL canceled its 2018 spring season, though choosing to frame it as a change to a fall-to-spring schedule spanning two calendar years. After a federal court denied an injunction that would have maintained the NASL&#x27;s second-division status, the league announced that it would also not play a 2018 fall season. The league never resumed play.

====United Soccer League: Establishment and growth====
Following the USL–NASL feud and a subsequent tightening of U.S. Soccer standards for owners of second-division teams, the USL folded its First and Second Divisions into a new third-level league originally known as USL Pro, later as the United Soccer League, and now as the USL Championship. The league launched in 2011 with 15 teams–11 on the U.S. mainland, three in Puerto Rico, and one in Antigua and Barbuda—but due to issues with the health and finances of two of the Puerto Rican owners, the Puerto Rican teams were dropped from the league shortly after the beginning of its first season. One of the U.S.-based teams folded following the 2011 season; two new U.S.-based teams joined the league in 2013. In that same year, MLS and USL Pro entered into a formal agreement that eventually merged the MLS Reserve League into the USL Pro structure. For a time, each MLS team was nominally required to field a reserve team in a USL league, either by operating a standalone team or affiliating with an independently owned team, though this was never strictly enforced. After the 2013 season, the Antigua and Barbuda team folded, as well as one U.S.-based team. In addition, one U.S.-based team left the league but was replaced by a new team in the same area; and three completely new teams entered the league for 2014. One of the new teams was an MLS reserve side.

The 2015 season, which coincided with the rebranding of the competition as the United Soccer League, saw a major expansion. Three teams left the league, but 13 new teams entered, bringing its membership to 24. Orlando City moved to MLS, and two other teams, the Charlotte Eagles and Dayton Dutch Lions, relegated themselves to the PDL. Two of the three departing teams were replaced by new franchises; the Eagles&#x27; franchise rights were acquired by a local group that launched the Charlotte Independence, and Louisville interests bought Orlando City&#x27;s USL franchise rights and launched Louisville City FC. Both of these clubs became affiliates of MLS teams, respectively the Colorado Rapids and Orlando City. Seven MLS teams—the Montreal Impact, New York Red Bulls, Portland Timbers, Real Salt Lake, Seattle Sounders, Toronto FC, and Vancouver Whitecaps—began fielding team-operated reserve sides in the USL. The Orlando City–Louisville affiliation was only for the 2015 season, as Orlando City launched Orlando City B, its own USL reserve side, in 2016.

The USL expanded to 29 teams in 2016. While Austin Aztex went on hiatus for that season while seeking to build a new stadium, six new teams were launched. Three are operated by MLS teams—Orlando City B, Bethlehem Steel FC (Philadelphia Union), and Swope Park Rangers (Sporting Kansas City). The other three are FC Cincinnati and San Antonio FC, neither of which had an MLS affiliation, and the Rio Grande Valley FC Toros. The Toros are the first USL team with a so-called &quot;hybrid affiliation&quot; with an MLS team; the Houston Dynamo selects players and coaches, while the separate Toros ownership group runs all business affairs. In 2017, the USL expanded to 30 teams. The Aztex ultimately folded without building a new stadium, and two other teams from the 2016 season did not play in 2017. The Wilmington Hammerheads self-relegated to the USL&#x27;s Premier Development League (PDL), now known as USL League Two, and the Montreal Impact folded FC Montreal in favor of an affiliation with the incoming Ottawa Fury FC. At the same time, three new teams entered the league, with Ottawa Fury FC and the Tampa Bay Rowdies joining from the NASL, and the completely new Reno 1868 FC competing as a hybrid affiliate of the San Jose Earthquakes. U.S. Soccer awarded the USL provisional second-level status for the 2017 season alongside the NASL.

Further USL expansion was announced for 2019 and beyond. With the folding of one team, the departure of two, and the addition of six, the league featured 33 teams in its 2018 season. Permanently departing was Whitecaps FC 2, which was folded by its MLS parent, the Vancouver Whitecaps. Orlando City B and the Rochester Rhinos went on hiatus, but eventually chose not to return to the USL&#x27;s top flight. Of the six new USL teams for 2018, four were new sides—Atlanta United 2 (owned by Atlanta United FC), Fresno FC (which took over the Whitecaps affiliation), Las Vegas Lights FC, and Nashville SC. The other new USL teams were former NASL sides Indy Eleven and North Carolina FC. The following year saw four teams leave the rebranded USL Championship and seven new teams join. The departing teams were FC Cincinnati, which joined MLS; the Richmond Kickers and Toronto FC II, both of which became founding members of USL League One, a third-level league that began play in 2019; and the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania-based Penn FC, which suspended professional operations for 2019 before resuming play in League One in 2020. In addition, both clubs that had gone on hiatus after the 2017 USL season would later announce moves to League One. Orlando City B resumed play alongside Toronto FC II as an inaugural League One team, while the Rochester Rhinos initially planned not to resume professional operations until joining League One in 2020 (the Rhinos ultimately did not resume play until 2022, joining MLS Next Pro under the new name of Rochester New York FC). The teams that began play in the USL Championship in 2019 are Austin Bold FC (replacing the Aztex), Birmingham Legion FC, El Paso Locomotive FC, Hartford Athletic, Loudoun United FC, Memphis 901 FC, and New Mexico United. Of these new sides, one was an MLS reserve team, namely Loudoun United, which replaced the Richmond Kickers as the D.C. United reserve side. Three teams ceased USL operations after the 2019 season—the identity of Nashville SC was assumed by the city&#x27;s new MLS team, and Fresno FC and Ottawa Fury FC suspended all operations, with the latter having been denied sanctioning by U.S. Soccer and CONCACAF. Fresno FC&#x27;s owner maintained his USLC franchise rights, and eventually relaunched the side in the Monterey, California area as Monterey Bay FC in 2022. The Fury sold its USLC franchise rights to the owners of Miami FC, then members of the third-level National Independent Soccer Association (NISA), and Miami FC accordingly joined the USLC in 2020. San Diego Loyal SC also joined the USL Championship in 2020. Teams in Chicago and California&#x27;s East Bay were set to launch in 2021, but the Chicago team&#x27;s launch was pushed back to an indeterminate future date before plans for that team were scrapped, and the East Bay bid faltered due to stadium issues. In addition to the East Bay team, Queensboro FC, based in the New York City borough of Queens, originally planned to start USLC play in 2021, but this was pushed back to 2023.

The USLC has been significantly affected by three phenomena in the early 2020s—financial issues triggered by COVID-19, further MLS expansion, and the decision by MLS to reestablish its reserve league in 2022 under the banner of MLS Next Pro. After the 2020 season, Saint Louis FC folded after the 2020 season due to a combination of COVID-19 impact and the impending arrival of St. Louis City SC in MLS; Reno 1868 FC folded due to COVID-19 impact; North Carolina FC voluntarily dropped to USL1; and the Philadelphia Union and Portland Timbers withdrew their reserve sides from the USL system. Both MLS reserve sides, as well as some other such sides withdrawn earlier by their MLS parents, would resume play in Next Pro. After the 2021 season, Austin Bold FC went on hiatus due to a combination of the MLS arrival of Austin FC and stadium issues, with plans to relocate to another Texas city; Charlotte Independence dropped to USL1, largely due to the 2022 MLS arrival of Charlotte FC; and three more MLS teams (Real Salt Lake, Seattle Sounders FC, Sporting Kansas City) moved their reserve sides from the USLC to Next Pro. Additionally, all remaining MLS reserve sides still playing in the USL system joined Next Pro in 2023.

Nonetheless, several teams have joined the Championship during that period. The franchise rights of the East Bay group were purchased by NISA side Oakland Roots SC, which moved to the USLC in 2021. Another NISA side, Detroit City FC, moved to the USLC in 2022, and as mentioned above the former Fresno FC franchise resumed play as Monterey Bay FC. OKC Energy FC went on hiatus for 2022, but plans on returning by 2027 pending the construction of a soccer-specific stadium. Expansion teams such as Rhode Island FC joined in 2024, entering alongside North Carolina FC, who rejoined the league after winning League 1. Brooklyn FC, an expansion club, and Lexington SC, who came from League 1, are expected to join in 2025, followed along by teams in Milwaukee, Buffalo, and Des Moines joining in the coming years. League 1 is also continuing its expansion, with teams like the Portland Heart of Pine, Santa Barbara Sky FC, and Texoma FC slated to join in 2024.

===Lower divisions===
The United Soccer League operates five leagues in all, with a sixth set to start play in 2024. These leagues span the lower divisions of men&#x27;s professional soccer, as well as women&#x27;s and youth soccer. The most recent addition to the USL lineup is the USL W League, a semi-pro third-level women&#x27;s league that started play in 2022 with 45 teams. This is not to be confused with the similar USL W-League, which operated from 1995 to 2015. This will be followed in 2024 with the launch of the USL Super League, a fully professional second-level women&#x27;s league. The most recent addition to the USL men&#x27;s lineup is USL League One, a third-level men&#x27;s league that began play in 2019. Below the USL Championship and League One is the country&#x27;s semi-professional fourth-division league, USL League Two (formerly the Premier Development League), which has (as of the 2022 season) 109 teams in the U.S. and two in Canada (the league has also previously had a team in Bermuda). Though League 2 does have some paid players, it also has many teams that are made up entirely or almost entirely of college soccer players who use the league as an opportunity to play competitive soccer in front of professional scouts during the summer, while retaining amateur status and NCAA eligibility.

Major League Soccer relaunched its reserve league under the banner of MLS Next Pro in 2022. The new league, which plays at the third level, started play with 21 teams, all of which are MLS reserve sides except the independently owned Rochester New York FC (which folded after that season). In 2023, all US-based MLS teams except D.C. United are fielding reserve sides in Next Pro.

The United States Adult Soccer Association governs amateur soccer competition for adults throughout the United States, which is effectively the amateur fifth division of soccer in the United States.

===Cup competitions===

The Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup is a knockout tournament in American soccer. The tournament is the oldest ongoing national soccer competition in the U.S. and was historically open to all United States Soccer Federation affiliated teams, from amateur adult club teams to the professional clubs of Major League Soccer. Since the 2016 edition, professional teams that are majority-owned, or whose playing staff is managed, by a higher-division outdoor professional team have been barred from the competition; all other U.S. Soccer-affiliated teams remain eligible to enter. The Open Cup was first held in 1913–14 when it was called the National Challenge Cup.

===American leagues vs. European leagues===
The overall league structure in the United States is significantly different from that used in almost all the rest of the world, but similar to that used by other American team sports leagues, in that there is no system of promotion and relegation between lower and higher leagues, but rather a minor league system, generally the same as other top-level pro sports leagues in North America. In addition, teams playing in American soccer leagues are not private clubs founded independently of the league that join a league in order to ensure regular fixtures but are instead usually franchises of the league itself. The soccer leagues in the United States also incorporate features common to other American sports leagues, most notably the determination of champions by playoffs between the top teams after the conclusion of a league season. MLS formerly had a balanced schedule, but due to the league&#x27;s expansion it returned to an unbalanced schedule in 2012 that favors intra-conference matches.

American soccer leagues became more similar to leagues in the rest of the world in the early 21st century. MLS and all USL leagues now allow games to end in ties, which were initially avoided via a penalty shootout if scores were level at the end of play (This practice still exists in MLS Next Pro). This was done to avoid alienating mainstream American sports fans, who are not accustomed to tie games, but actually had the unintended consequence of alienating soccer purists who saw the change as an &quot;Americanization&quot; of the sport. MLS began allowing ties in the 2000 season. Additionally, MLS and USL leagues now use upward-counting clocks that do not stop for stoppages in play, and instead add on time before halftime and full-time. A countdown clock that stops for dead balls and ends the game when it reaches zero is still in use in American high school and college soccer, as well as most other American sports, but was and is completely foreign to soccer played outside the United States. MLS adopted the international clock in late 1999. Until 2007, the front of teams&#x27; shirts in MLS and USL leagues did not bear advertisements, as commercial uniform sponsorship is uncommon in American sports. However, starting in the mid-2000s, clubs were allowed to accept corporate sponsorship on the front of their shirts.
==United States national teams==
The United States men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s national soccer teams represent the United States in international competition.

===Women&#x27;s national team===
The women&#x27;s national soccer team of the 1900s were the first women&#x27;s national team in the United States. They competed in the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, the Summer Olympics, and the Algarve Cup, in addition to the CONCACAF Women&#x27;s Championship and other competitions by invitation. The United States women&#x27;s team has been one of the best national teams in the history of women&#x27;s soccer, having won four World Cups (in 1991, 1999, 2015 and 2019). They also won four Olympic gold medals (in 1996, 2004, 2008, and 2012), and 10 Algarve Cups (in 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2015). Following their 2015 World Cup victory, the USWNT regained the top spot in the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Rankings from Germany; they have held the top spot for the majority of the time since the rankings began in 2003, and have never been lower than second.

In 1999, when the United States hosted and won the Women&#x27;s World Cup, women&#x27;s soccer briefly captivated the American public on an unprecedented scale. The tournament&#x27;s final between the United States and China was watched by an estimated 40 million American television viewers.

There are several factors that may have contributed to the early dominance of the United States women&#x27;s national soccer team. First is the relative lack of attention afforded the women&#x27;s game in some traditional soccer-playing countries. According to a 2015 story in the ESPN-owned Web outlet &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot;,For as much as the rest of the world loves soccer, it has been much slower to embrace the women&#x27;s game than the U.S. In England, women playing soccer was effectively banned (at least at venues that hosted men&#x27;s teams) from 1921 to 1971, and in Germany it was banned from 1955 to 1970. At around the time Title IX was heating up in the United States, women&#x27;s international soccer basically didn&#x27;t exist. According to FIFA, there were only three national teams and two international matches played in 1971.

Additionally, in the years following Title IX, American high schools and colleges have been steadily embracing girls&#x27; and women&#x27;s soccer. According to the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS), the U.S. had little more than 10,000 girls playing high school soccer in the late 1970s. This number had increased to 120,000 by 1991 when the USWNT claimed its first World Cup title, and 250,000 by 1999, the year of the second World Cup title. In 2015, there were about 375,000 girls playing high school soccer, making up 47% of all high school soccer players, and soccer has recently surpassed softball as the third-most-played girls&#x27; team sport. At the college level, 53% of all NCAA soccer players are women, and this percentage rises to 61% at the highest level, Division I.

Another contributing factor is the role of women within American society, which includes relative equality (especially rejecting hardened gender roles) for women in the United States relative to many other countries. This is also reflected in official government policy regarding women in athletics, specifically the landmark Title IX legislation, which broadly requires any educational institution that receives federal government funds to support men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s educational programs equally, thus including athletics. America&#x27;s approach to growing the game among women has served as a model for other countries&#x27; development programs for women at all levels.

However, the &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; story suggested that the U.S. does not take adult women&#x27;s soccer as seriously as some other countries, notably Germany. On a per capita basis, the U.S. and Germany have essentially identical participation among girls. However, the two countries differ greatly in the age profile of their registered female players. Nearly 95% of registered female players in the U.S. are youths, as opposed to 31% in Germany. In turn, this leads to Germany having more than six times the number of serious adult female players as the U.S. (about 650,000 to 100,000).

===Men&#x27;s national team===
The men&#x27;s national team competes in the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Confederations Cup, in addition to the CONCACAF Gold Cup and other competitions by invitation.

The U.S. national team had some success in early FIFA World Cup tournaments. The U.S. finished third in the World Cup in 1930, and played in the 1934 World Cup. The next World Cup participation came in the 1950 World Cup, where they upset England 1–0 in group play. After 1950, the U.S. did not return to the World Cup for another 40 years.

The fortunes of the U.S. national team changed in the 1990s, with the team participating in every World Cup between 1990 and 2014. The U.S. hosted the 1994 World Cup, beating Colombia to reach the knockout rounds, before losing to Brazil in the round of sixteen. The team reached the quarter-finals of the 2002 World Cup by defeating its rival Mexico. The U.S. team also accomplished another first by winning its group at the 2010 World Cup.

The U.S. national team participated in the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup. The U.S. defeated #1 ranked Spain in the semifinals, before losing to Brazil 3–2 in the final.
On the regional stage, the national team has also improved, with a record up to 2013 of reaching the final of the biannual CONCACAF Gold Cup nine times since 1989, winning it seven times: 1991, 2002, 2005, 2007, 2013, 2017, and 2021.

Most recently, the U.S. national team won the very first 2021 CONCACAF Nations League, beating Mexico 3–2 in overtime thanks to the heroics of the United States backup goalkeeper Ethan Horvath following an injury to the starting goalkeeper Zack Steffen in the 67th minute. The match was widely considered as a revival of the United States-Mexico rivalry following the struggles of U.S. soccer between 2017 and 2020.

The national team has development teams at a number of different ages, the most popular youth national team groups are the Olympic team made up of primarily U23 player, the U20s who has their own World Cup and the u17s who also have their own World Cup.

==College soccer==

In the United States, college soccer is featured in many collegiate athletic associations including the NCAA, the NAIA, the NCCAA, and the USCAA.
Many top American college soccer players play for separate teams in USL League Two during the summer.

The NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Soccer Championship, the semifinals and finals of which are known as the College Cup, is an American intercollegiate college soccer tournament conducted by the NCAA and determines the Division I men&#x27;s national champion. The tournament has been formally held since 1959, when it crowned Saint Louis University as the inaugural champion. The tournament&#x27;s current format involves 48 teams, in which every Division I conference tournament champion is allocated a berth. Since its inception, Saint Louis (10 titles), Indiana (8 titles), and Virginia (6 titles) have historically been the most successful Division I schools. Indiana has appeared in more College Cups (18) and has a higher winning percentage in post-season play (.768) than any other school in Division I soccer.

==Youth soccer==

The largest category of soccer in the United States in terms of participation is boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; youth soccer. Soccer is one of the most played sports by children in the United States. In 2012, soccer was the #1 most played team sport by high school boys, and soccer overtook softball to become the #3 most played team sport by high school girls. As of 2006, the U.S. was the #1 country in the world for participation in youth soccer, with 3.9 million American youths (2.3 million boys and 1.6 million girls) registered with U.S. Soccer. Among girls, the U.S. has more registered players than all other countries combined. The number of high school soccer players more than doubled from 1990 to 2010, giving soccer the fastest growth rate among all major U.S. sports. In recent decades, more youth sports organizations have turned to soccer as a supplement to American football, and most American high schools offer both boys and girls soccer. Due to the rising number of youths playing, the term &quot;soccer mom&quot; is used in American social and political discourse to describe middle- or upper-middle-class suburban women with school-age children. Americans between the ages of 12 and 24 rank professional soccer as their second favorite sport behind only American football. And in 2011, the FIFA video game ranked as the #2 most popular video game in the country, behind only Madden NFL.

Though organized locally by organizations all over the United States, there are three main youth soccer club leagues working nationwide through affiliated local associations. The United States Youth Soccer Association (USYSA) boasts over three million players between the ages of five and 19, while American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO) has more than 600,000 players between the ages of four and 19. Finally, the USL offers a number of youth leagues, including the Super-20 League and the Super Y-League, which have almost 1,000 teams and tens of thousands of players from the ages of 13 to 20.

Also, the National Federation of State High School Associations features 800,000 soccer players. However, NFHS uses rules that are somewhat different from IFAB&#x27;s laws.

== Soccer on TV ==

=== TV contracts and exposure ===
U.S. television coverage and viewership of club and international soccer are at an all-time high. Mainstream sports broadcasters ESPN, Fox Sports, NBC Sports, and CBS Sports regularly provide coverage of soccer, as do several popular Spanish-language channels such as Univision, Telemundo, UniMás, and Galavisión. Additionally, the U.S. has several networks devoted mostly or completely to the sport, including Gol TV and beIN Sport USA.

The size of the annual TV market in the U.S. for annual club soccer competitions was $126 million as of 2009. The club soccer competitions that generate the most annual revenue from TV audiences today in the United States are England&#x27;s Premier League ($167 million), Major League Soccer ($90 million), the Mexican league ($50 million), Spain&#x27;s La Liga ($16 million), and the UEFA Champions League ($10 million). The most widely accessed televised soccer league in the United States is Mexico&#x27;s Liga MX, which has most of its games televised live and free on television channels Azteca, Telemundo, UniMás and Univision.

CBS aired a soccer series in 1967-68 but dropped it due to low ratings. In May 1976, CBS made a three-year agreement with the North American Soccer League to broadcast two games in 1976, six in 1977 and nine in 1978 but terminated the contract after the first year. The network returned to regular soccer broadcasts after it acquired the rights to UEFA club competitions in 2019 following the withdrawal of Turner Sports. CBS later acquired the rights to Serie A, several CONCACAF tournaments, and the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League and launched the CBS Sports Golazo Network, a free streaming channel, alongside its paid Paramount+ service.

Fox began showing English Premier League matches on network TV in 2011, the first time that Premier League matches aired on U.S. English-language broadcast TV. U.S. TV rights for the English Premier League were sold to NBC Sports in 2012 for $250 million for three years beginning with the 2013–14 season. Viewership for the Premier League&#x27;s 2013–14 season on NBC Sports was 32 million, more than double the previous season. The Premier League earns higher ratings on NBCSN than the National Hockey League, despite the fact that the Premier League is shown in the morning while NHL games are in primetime. The Premier League and NBC have continued to renew their broadcast contract; that latest extension brings the rights to the end of the 2027-28 season.

Major League Soccer has received broadcast fees from ESPN since 2008, and MLS signed a three-year deal in 2011 with NBC Sports to nationally televise 40 matches per year from 2012 to 2014. MLS has since then signed new television agreements with ESPN, FOX Sports, and Univision worth in total $90 million per year from 2015 to 2022. In 2023, MLS started a new television deal with Apple, which operates the MLS Season Pass streaming service in a deal that guarantees the league $250 million per year; selected games continue to be broadcast on Fox Sports. In addition, the 2010 UEFA Champions League final was broadcast live on the Fox Network, marking the first time that a soccer match between two European club teams was televised in the U.S. on English-language broadcast television. 

These TV networks also provide coverage of international soccer competitions, including the FIFA World Cup, the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, the CONCACAF Gold Cup, the UEFA European Championship, the FIFA Confederations Cup, and the U.S. men&#x27;s national team, and women&#x27;s national team matches. The Mexico national football team is also a popular team featured on Spanish language television and on ESPN.

In addition to the World Cup, other international soccer competitions involving the U.S. team have become more popular among TV viewers. The 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup attracted record television viewership, with the Univision telecast of the final between the United States and Mexico ranking as the third-most-watched Spanish-language program of all time in the United States, beaten only by two FIFA World Cup finals matches. The 2009 Confederations Cup Final featuring the United States attracted 6.9 million viewers (including both the English and Spanish broadcasts). The 2013 World Cup qualifier between the U.S. and Mexico drew 7 million viewers, higher than the 5.8 million average viewers of the 2013 NHL Stanley Cup finals. Three 2013 Gold Cup matches were broadcast on the main Fox network channel, the first time since 2002 that a U.S. national team match outside of the World Cup was broadcast on network TV. 
TV networks in the U.S. have also begun showing international soccer tournaments that do not include the United States. Euro 2008 was shown on ESPN and ABC. Viewership for the Euro 2012 was 51% higher than 2008, with the 2012 final watched by over 4 million viewers. The viewership on ESPN of the group-stage matches of the 2013 Confederations Cup was 26% higher than the 2009 tournament, even though the U.S. did not play in the 2013 tournament.

Notes:
# The rights to the two FIFA World Cups during the 2015–2022 timeframe also include rights to the two Women&#x27;s World Cups and the two Confederations Cups during those years.
# The rights to the CONCACAF Gold Cup also include the rights to the CONCACAF Champions League.
# The rights to the Euro also includes rights for European World Cup qualifiers, as well as the UEFA Nations League

===FIFA World Cup on TV===
, the most popular soccer event on television in the U.S. was the 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup Final. It was the most watched soccer match in American history with nearly 26.7 million combined viewers, more than the 2015 NBA Finals and Stanley Cup. It was also the most watched Spanish-language broadcast in tournament history. More than 750 million viewers were reported to have watched the match worldwide. The second highest viewership in the U.S. for a soccer match was 26.5 million combined viewers for Germany vs. Argentina in the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final. Previously, the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup Final tallied 17.9 million viewers in the U.S.

In 2005, the U.S. TV rights for the 2010 and 2014 World Cups were sold to ABC/ESPN and Univision for $425 million in &quot;the biggest TV deal in a single country in FIFA&#x27;s history.&quot;
The telecasts of the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final attracted an estimated 17 million American viewers, higher than the 15.8 million average viewership of the 2006 World Series.

The total TV viewership in the U.S. for all the matches including the final for the 2010 World Cup was 112 million viewers, a 22% increase over viewing numbers for the 2006 World Cup.
The 2010 World Cup final game drew 24.3 million viewers in the United States, higher than the 14.3 million average viewership of the 2010 World Series. Landon Donovan&#x27;s dramatic game-winning goal against Algeria that advanced the U.S. team to the knockout stage of the 2010 World Cup resulted in jubilant celebrations across the United States.
In 2011, the U.S. TV rights for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups were sold to Fox and Telemundo for a record $1.1 billion, more than any other country in the world, and 147 percent higher than the 2010 and 2014 TV rights.

By 2014, the World Cup was considered an elite sports property on U.S. television. The USA-Portugal match during the 2014 World Cup registered 24.7 million viewers in the United States, with 6.5 million viewers on Univision and 18.2 million viewers on ESPN, making it the most viewed program on ESPN, other than NFL or college football games, and eclipsing viewership numbers of other high-profile sports events such as MLB&#x27;s World Series, the NBA Finals, and the NHL&#x27;s Stanley Cup Finals. The 2014 FIFA World Cup also generated strong internet traffic, with the tournament generating more viewers via websites and apps than the 2012 Summer Olympics.

More recently, many matches have also become available on over-the-top streaming services such as Paramount+, ESPN+, and Peacock.

==Americans playing in foreign leagues==
Since the early 1990s, several Americans have found opportunities playing soccer at the highest levels of foreign leagues. Among the first Americans to become regulars in foreign leagues were John Harkes at Sheffield Wednesday and Derby County in England, Eric Wynalda at Saarbrücken in Germany, and Kasey Keller at Millwall in England. Since then, other Americans have played for clubs that have participated in the knockout rounds of the Champions League and Europa League, such as Brad Friedel with Tottenham Hotspur; DaMarcus Beasley with PSV Eindhoven; and Christian Pulisic with Borussia Dortmund, Chelsea, and AC Milan.

==National teams of U.S. unincorporated territories==
The following national teams of U.S. unincorporated territories compete in their corresponding regions. Their governing bodies are either members or associates in the corresponding regional federations. For all but American Samoa, players for these territories are, like most local residents, U.S. citizens. Natives of American Samoa are U.S. nationals, but not U.S. citizens (unless they have a citizen parent).

<text>The United Soccer Coaches (formerly known as the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA)) is an organization of American soccer coaches founded in 1941. It is the largest soccer coaches organization in the world, with more than 30,000 members. It offers training courses for both beginning and experienced coaches and a wide range of award programs. Rare among sports organizations, it serves its sport for both men/boys and women/girls. Geoff VanDuesen is the current Chief Executive Officer. The NSCAA was rebranded as United Soccer Coaches on August 2, 2017.

==Annual convention==
The annual United Soccer Coaches Convention, known as &quot;The World&#x27;s Largest Annual Gathering of Soccer Coaches&quot; is held in mid-January. The five-day event attracts more than 12,000 attendees for live field demonstration and lecture sessions, networking socials, coaching diploma training classes, and a large soccer-only trade show, with more than 300 companies displaying soccer equipment, technology and services.

As the group announced its new name in Chicago on August 2, 2017, it also listed the sites for the annual convention through 2032:

Philadelphia– 2018, 2023, 2026, 2030

Chicago– 2019, 2025, 2031

Baltimore– 2020, 2028, 2032

Anaheim– 2021, 2024, 2029

Kansas City– 2022, 2027

On August 26, 2020, the association announced that the 2021 United Soccer Coaches Convention would take place online, in a digital format. The 2021 Convention was originally scheduled to be held in Anaheim, California, but the organization decided to cancel the in-person event due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="579127" wikidata="Q1413227" url="?curid=579127" title="The Trouble with Harry">
<text>The Trouble with Harry is a 1955 American Technicolor black comedy film directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The screenplay by John Michael Hayes was based on the 1950 novel by Jack Trevor Story. It starred Edmund Gwenn, John Forsythe, Mildred Natwick, Jerry Mathers and Shirley MacLaine in her film debut. &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot; was released in the United States on September 30, 1955, then re-released in 1984 once the distribution rights had been acquired by Universal Pictures.

The action in &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot; takes place during a sun-filled autumn in the Vermont countryside. The fall foliage and the beautiful scenery around the village, as well as Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s light-filled score, all set an idyllic tone. The story is about how residents of a small Vermont village react when the dead body of a man named Harry is found on a hillside. The film is, however, not a murder mystery: it is a light comedy-drama with a touch of romance, in which the corpse serves as a MacGuffin. Four village residents end up working together to solve the problem of what to do with Harry. In the process, the younger two (an artist and a very young, twice-widowed woman) fall in love and become a couple, soon to be married. The older two residents (a captain and a spinster) also fall in love.

The film was one of Hitchcock&#x27;s few true comedies (though most of his films had some element of tongue-in-cheek or macabre humor). The film also contained what was, for the time, frank dialogue. One example of this is when John Forsythe&#x27;s character unabashedly tells MacLaine&#x27;s character that he would like to paint a nude portrait of her. The statement was extremely explicit for the time.

== Plot ==
The quirky but down-to-earth residents of the small hamlet of Highwater, Vermont, are faced with the freshly dead body of Harry Worp, which has inconveniently appeared on the hillside above the town. The problem of who the person is, who was responsible for his sudden death, and what should be done with the body is &quot;the trouble with Harry&quot;.

Captain Wiles is sure that he killed the man with a stray shot from his rifle while hunting, until it is shown he actually shot a rabbit. Jennifer Rogers, Harry&#x27;s estranged wife, believes she killed Harry because she hit him hard with a milk bottle. Miss Gravely is certain that the man died after a blow from the heel of her hiking boot when he lunged at her out of the bushes, while still reeling from the blow he received at the hands of Jennifer. Sam Marlowe, an attractive and nonconformist artist, is open-minded about the whole event, and is prepared to help his neighbors and new-found friends in any way he can. In any case, no one is upset at all about Harry&#x27;s death.

However, they all are hoping that the body will not come to the attention of &quot;the authorities&quot; in the form of cold, humorless Deputy Sheriff Calvin Wiggs, who earns his living per arrest. The Captain, Jennifer, Miss Gravely and Sam bury the body and then dig it up again several times throughout the day. They then hide the body in a bathtub before finally putting it back on the hill where it first appeared, in order to make it appear as if it was just discovered.

Finally it is learned that Harry died of natural causes; no foul play at all was involved. In the meantime, Sam and Jennifer have fallen in love and wish to marry, and the Captain and Miss Gravely have also become a couple. Sam has been able to sell all his paintings to a passing millionaire, although Sam refuses money, and instead requests a few simple gifts for his friends and himself.

== Cast ==
== Production ==

Primary location shooting took place in Craftsbury, Vermont. Assuming that the town would be in full foliage, the company showed up for outdoor shots on September 27, 1954. To the filmmakers&#x27; shock, there was hardly any foliage left; to achieve a full effect, leaves were glued to the trees. Several scenes in the film had to be shot in a rented high school gym because of persistent rain. In the gym, a 500-lb (226-kg) camera fell from a great height and barely missed Hitchcock, and the sound of the rain on the roof of the gym necessitated extensive post-production re-recording. Other locations included Morrisville and Barre, with the shooting lasting up to December of that year. Full details on the making of the film are in Steven DeRosa&#x27;s book &quot;Writing with Hitchcock&quot;.

The paintings by the character Sam Marlowe were painted by American abstract expressionist artist John Ferren, who was present during principal photography in Vermont. While there, he instructed John Forsythe in the correct painting technique for his on-screen work. Hitchcock was particularly interested in Ferren&#x27;s work, for his vivid use of color, which he thought would be resonant with the autumnal colors of New England. The sketch of the corpse, Harry Worp, was done on location by Ferren&#x27;s wife, Rae Ferren, also a fine artist. Hitchcock and Ferren very much enjoyed collaborating, and as a result of this first project together, he was invited several years later to design the &quot;special sequence&quot; core to the 1958 Hitchcock film &quot;Vertigo&quot;. The panoramic drawing for the opening credits was done by Saul Steinberg.

Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s cameo is a signature occurrence in most of his films. In &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot;, he can be seen 22:14 minutes into the film as he walks past a parked limousine while an old man looks at paintings for sale at the roadside stand.

The corpse, Harry Worp, was played by Philip Truex (1911–2008), who was the son of character actor Ernest Truex.

== Musical score ==

&quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot; is notable as a landmark in Hitchcock&#x27;s career as it marked the first of several highly regarded collaborations with composer Bernard Herrmann. In an interview for &quot;The New York Times&quot; on June 18, 1971, Hitchcock stated that the score was his favorite of all his films. Herrmann rerecorded a new arrangement of highlights from the film&#x27;s score for Phase 4 Stereo with Herrmann calling the arrangement &quot;A Portrait of Hitch&quot;.

A song sung by John Forsythe&#x27;s character, &quot;Flaggin&#x27; the Train to Tuscaloosa&quot;, was written by Raymond Scott and Mack David. Forsythe is not the performer, however.

A &quot;cash-in&quot; song titled &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot; was written by Floyd Huddleston with Herb Wiseman and Mark McIntyre. A recording of the song by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. (using the pseudonym of &quot;Alfi &amp; Harry&quot;) was released as a single in early 1956, reaching No. 44 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and No. 15 on the UK singles chart. A competing version by Les Baxter reached No. 80 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. The title aside, the record had no connection with the film.

=== 1998 re-recording ===
Originally released on October 3, 1955, the original soundtrack was re-recorded in 1998 and released on CD that same year, under the Varèse Sarabande label. All the original music, composed by Bernard Herrmann, was re-recorded at the City Halls, Glasgow, Scotland, on April 29, 1998, performed by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, under the direction of Joel McNeely.

The re-recording was originally released on CD in the United Kingdom on July 27, 1998 and in the United States on October 6, 1998. It was later re-released in the UK on May 16, 2014 and in the US on July 21, 2014.

=== Track listing ===
== Reception ==
The world premiere of &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot; was in Vermont (where it was shot), with revenue donated to victims of a recent flood.

Contemporary reviews were middling to positive. Bosley Crowther, in a mixed verdict for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote: &quot;It is not a particularly witty or clever script that John Michael Hayes has put together from a novel by Jack Trevor Story, nor does Mr. Hitchcock&#x27;s direction make it spin. The pace is leisurely, almost sluggish, and the humor frequently is strained ... But it does possess mild and mellow merriment all the way. The performers are beguiling in a briskly artificial style, and there&#x27;s an especially disarming screwball blandness about the manner of Miss MacLaine.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a blithe little comedy&quot; with Edmund Gwenn &quot;a delight&quot; in the lead role. &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called it &quot;a whacky, off-beat type of film, well directed and acted and quite amusing throughout&quot;, though the review cautioned that &quot;it may be received with mixed audience reaction&quot; because of the subject matter. Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;an odd one—sparkling cider spiked with arsenic and a sprig of poison ivy. Although I can recognize its drawbacks, I must confess it almost made me drunk with perverse pleasure.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; called the film &quot;a &quot;comedie noire&quot; that brilliantly maintains its precarious balance between humour and bad taste&quot;, adding, &quot;The humour is of a quiet and concentrated kind, with the corpse of the troublesome Harry kept persistently in the foreground, and John Michael Hayes&#x27; shrewdly witty script affords Hitchcock opportunities for some typically witty macabre and sardonic invention.&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was negative, writing, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock, whose work has been going steadily downhill ever since he arrived in Hollywood, skids to preposterous depths in &#x27;The Trouble With Harry.&#x27;&quot;

The film was a box office disappointment, earning only $3.5 million in the United States. Although the movie was a financial failure in the U.S., it played for a year in England and Rome, and a year and a half in France.

The film rights reverted to Hitchcock following its initial release. It was little shown for nearly 30 years, other than a showing on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot; network television broadcast in the early 1960s, though there were some theatrical exhibition in 1963. After protracted negotiations with the Hitchcock estate, Universal Pictures reissued it in 1983, along with &quot;Rear Window&quot;, &quot;Vertigo&quot;, and &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;, which in turn led to VHS and eventually DVD and Blu-ray versions for the home video market.

<doc id="579129" wikidata="Q16252604" url="?curid=579129" title="IiNet">
<text>iiNet Limited is an Australian internet service provider and telecommunications company that sells NBN plans, 4G and 5G Home Wireless Internet and services on its ULTRA Broadband Cable, FTTB and VDSL2 networks. It also sells mobile phone sim-only plans using the Vodafone network. 

iiNet was acquired by TPG in September 2015 for $1.56 billion but retained its retail brand name. iiNet acquired or merged with smaller ISPs, building a customer base in Western Australia and then, by acquiring ihug and OzEmail, expanded into the eastern states.

==History==
iiNet was founded in 1993 by Michael Malone and Michael O&#x27;Reilly, who started the business in a suburban garage in Perth as iiNet Technologies. It began as one of the first Australian ISPs to offer TCP/IP Internet access , as opposed to the store-and-forward techniques (such as MHSnet) that were then in use at other ISPs. It claims it was the first ISP to offer PPP access in Australia and to be the first to base operations on the then-new Linux operating system.

In 1995, the company moved to a CBD office. Early growth during the Internet boom was hampered by the ability of Telstra (not releasing Bigpond as an ISP until 1997) to cope with the demand for needed telephone lines and by the sheer competitive pressure in the Perth market, which had a comparative oversupply of low-cost providers. In 1996, iiNet expanded into the Adelaide market under the name &quot;light.iinet.net.au&quot; (named after Colonel Light), in partnership with locals John Lindsay and Leigh Hart. The South Australian branch moved to become the number three ISP in the state before being acquired by Auslink in 1998.

===Early growth===
In 1997, due to growing demand for infrastructure and an increase in staff numbers, the company relocated to the central QV.1 building. Additionally, during the same period, the Western Australian Internet Association established a peering and interconnection arrangement called WAIX among its members, including iiNet and several other Perth-based ISPs.

With the internet market transitioning to 56K technology in late 1997, traditional racks of modems at ISPs became redundant and expensive. CBD-hosted equipment from Cisco, Ascend, and Livingston became essential to adapt to the changing marketplace. The Perth market also faced competition from budget national providers, notably One.Tel.

In 1998, iiNet&#x27;s founding partner, Michael Malone, acquired the company entirely and subsequently listed it on the Australian Securities Exchange in September 1999 (ticker symbol IIN). With new capital, iiNet acquired its major local competitors in the Perth area, including Wantree Internet and Omen Internet, and several smaller competitors like Networx Internet, Infinite Data, Octal, and Net Trek Online Services.

This was perceived by most observers as a rationalisation of an unsustainable services market and allowed not only iiNet, but also other providers such as Westnet, EFTel (itself an agglomeration of several ISPs formed in 2000), ArachNet and Global Dial among others to grow in the local market and to expand into fully-fledged national providers.

After the dot-com bubble burst in mid-2000, iiNet fared poorly on the markets – with shares at one stage falling to from a issue price – however its share price recovered as time progressed. In September 2000, iiNet became the first Western Australian provider to offer ADSL technology.

===Growth through acquisition===
The company created a new registered telecommunications provider iiTel, later renamed &quot;Chime Communications&quot;, that sought to improve Internet access prices by making wholesale telephone access much cheaper. This was possible through new interconnection agreements mandated by the Australian Government&#x27;s deregulation of the telecommunications industry and provided the foundation for iiNet&#x27;s later move into telephony via its iPhone (later &quot;Phone Advantage&quot; and &quot;Phone 1&quot;) and iiNetPhone (later &quot;iiNet VoIP&quot;) products.

In the early 2000s, iiNet expanded their national coverage by acquiring the following companies: 
*RuralNet (Mildura and regional Victoria)
*Tas Access (Tasmania)
*Granite Internet (Fleurieu Peninsula, South Australia)
*RockNet (Rockhampton, Queensland)
*Hartingdale (Sydney)
*Country Netlink (regional Victoria)
*Origin Internet (regional Victoria)
*Froggy Internet (Sydney)
*Virtual Communities (Melbourne)
*Octa4 (Darwin)
*TransACT (Australian Capital Territory and Queanbeyan)

In 2003, iiNet made what was then its biggest acquisition, purchasing key New Zealand provider ihug. The acquisition significantly increased iiNet&#x27;s share of the Australian and New Zealand Internet market.

In 2005, iiNet acquired the residential ISP business and trademarks of rival OzEmail. That business&#x27;s business side and infrastructure remained in the ownership of US-parent MCI. OzEmail had been Australia&#x27;s largest ISP until 2000, when it was acquired by MCI. The retail arm had been neglected, and the company moved very late into ADSL, meaning that it had difficulty positioning itself as a broadband player. iiNet initially used both the OzEmail and iiNet brands on the east coast, but by 2006 iiNet had largely abandoned the OzEmail brand, using its own corporate image across Australia.

===DSLAM deployment===
In late 2004, throughout 2005 and into 2006, iiNet moved to introduce their own DSLAM infrastructure (colloquially known as &quot;iiSLAMs&quot; or &quot;iiDSLAMs&quot; in the industry) into telephone exchanges Australia-wide. This move allowed iiNet to be the first Australian DSL carrier to offer speeds of over 1.5 Mbit/s to many customers. The maximum download speed was initially 8 Mbit/s (ADSL1), which increased to 12 Mbit/s and later to 24 Mbit/s, as ADSL2/ADSL2+ standards have been ratified and tested with iiNet&#x27;s equipment. There are currently over 406 enabled exchanges active around Australia, and a list of these exchanges can be found at iiNet&#x27;s official website.

===Launch of telephony products===
2004 saw the introduction of iiPhone in the form of a long-distance carrier.

In February 2005, iiNet launched their full-service &quot;iiPhone&quot; telephony service with their new range of iiBroadband2 packages, allowing customers to pay their telephony costs entirely through iiNet, including line rental and local calls.

In August 2005, iiNet released &quot;iiNetPhone&quot;, their consumer VoIP service. The product was an &quot;add-on&quot; service, available only to customers that also use their iiPhone service. As with most VoIP services, call costs were well under standard market prices for a regular copper line. The iiNetPhone service supports inbound and outbound calls to normal Australian PSTN numbers.

In 2006, iiNet were trialling its MSAN services in three Perth telephone exchanges; but release and expanded trial of these has since been put on hold until further notice. MSANs are iiNet&#x27;s own full telephone service, meaning they can be completely off Telstra&#x27;s phone service and onto their own. This would result in a lower line rental price for its customers and free additional add on options to the phone service.

===Regulatory conflict with Telstra===
In late 2005, Telstra Wholesale changed its pricing arrangements, each of which forced iiNet to change its product line and pricing. The first of these changes was to the DSLAM port rate, which resulted in an increase in the cost of a 1.5 Mbit port. iiNet reduced the speeds for their two cheapest plans to 512 kbit/s, while doubling the data allowance on these plans in an attempt to placate users. They also rebranded the plans available to their Telstra Wholesale customers (512 kbit/s and 1.5 Mbit/s plans) to &quot;iiBroadband1&quot;, reserving the &quot;iiBroadband2+&quot; moniker to uncapped &quot;Up to 24 Mbit/s&quot; speed plans, only available in areas connected to an exchange with an iiNet DSLAM. In April 2006, another iiBroadband1 (using Telstra Wholesale) plan&#x27;s speed was reduced to 512 kbit/s (though existing plan users were allowed to keep their speed).

The second was an increase in line rental for iiPhone. The rate was increased from to , and was also blamed on price increases from Telstra Wholesale. Michael Malone said in regard to both changes, &quot;We&#x27;re disappointed in the changes to our broadband arrangements and line rental prices from Telstra Wholesale and we&#x27;re challenging this.&quot;

This dispute was resolved, and line rental returned to a month under the re-branded &quot;Phone 1&quot; plan on the iiNet website.

===Suspension and resumption of share trading===
iiNet&#x27;s share value slid from in September 2005 to in April 2006. On 18 April 2006, iiNet requested a trading halt pending the release of an announcement. Two days later, it suspended its shares from quotation. Initially, the company advised it intended to resume trading on the ASX the following week, but on 21 April, a local newspaper, &quot;WA Business News&quot;, speculated that &quot;One line of thought is that uncertainty on behalf of iiNet&#x27;s bankers, will result in the company embarking on a capital raising to address concerns over banking covenants, and provide its bankers with a measure of confidence.&quot; Other speculation in the same article suggested that iiNet may be about to exit New Zealand or the CEO was about to sell his shareholding.

On 1 May 2006, iiNet advised the ASX that its shares would remain suspended, as its March quarter results had been &quot;well below expectations&quot;. The company announced on 11 May 2006 that updated financial figures for the previous year would not be released for &quot;one to two weeks&quot;. On 13 May, &quot;The West Australian&quot; business section reported on the matter, and claimed that founder Michael Malone had been &quot;sidelined&quot;, and that the company was &quot;open for takeover&quot; according to analysts, who rated Singtel Optus as the most likely suitor. On 18 May, &quot;WA Business News&quot; agreed with the West&#x27;s claim that takeover offers were being evaluated, however contradicted the claim that Malone had been sidelined. Meanwhile, ZDNet reported, &quot;It is likely iiNet&#x27;s management will move more conservatively now that their financial dirty laundry has been so publicly aired. They&#x27;ll need to remain focused on consolidating their assets after what is expected to be a large drop in iiNet&#x27;s share price when the stock resumes trading.&quot;

On 26 May, the stock was reinstated to official quotation and fell on its first trading day to , after the 27 May edition of &quot;The West Australian&quot; reported that iiNet was in the red for the first time in five years and had vowed not to repeat costly mistakes. PowerTel, a Sydney-based telco, would emerge with a diluted stake of 13% at 85c a share and Michael Malone&#x27;s share would be diluted to 14.4%.

On 31 May, Amcom Telecommunications announced it had acquired a 19.96% stake in iiNet, becoming the company&#x27;s largest shareholder.

On 21 June, the Malone family increased their holding to 19.97%.

===Sale of ihug – New Zealand subsidiary===
On 20 July 2006 iiNet announced that they were wanting to sell their New Zealand subsidiary – ihug. Potential buyers included Orcon Internet, Vodafone and TelstraClear. The sale to Vodafone NZ was announced on 9 October 2006, at a price of – roughly six times ihug&#x27;s EBIT at the time.

===2008 acquisitions===
January 2008 saw iiNet recommence its acquisition strategy with the purchase of the customer base of local Perth ISP Up&#x27;n&#x27;away. This was followed in May with the purchase of rival Perth-based ISP Westnet, in a friendly acquisition worth $81 million. In a departure from previous acquisitions, iiNet also announced that Westnet would continue to operate as a separate entity. However, as of 2013 some marketing copy is identical, suggesting at the very least a degree of back-office collaboration now exists.

As part of the Westnet acquisition, iiNet&#x27;s online gaming presence was closed in August 2008, with operations being moved to the former Westnet gaming site 3FL.

===2010 acquisitions===

iiNet continued to grow through acquisitions by purchasing rival ISP Netspace in March 2010. The deal, valued at $40 million, increased iiNet&#x27;s total number of broadband subscribers to 520,000, and also followed the pattern of the Westnet takeover with Netspace remaining operational as a separate entity under iiNet.

In late July 2010, iiNet agreed to purchase AAPT&#x27;s consumer operations for $60 million from Telecom New Zealand. As part of the acquisition, Telecom New Zealand entered into a block-trade agreement to sell their 18.2% share holding in iiNet to &quot;institutional and sophisticated investors&quot;, a move viewed by many as a defensive action against a takeover bid from industry rival TPG. The purchase of AAPT increases iiNet&#x27;s total broadband subscribers to more than 652,000 and total active services to more than 1,326,000.

===2011 acquisitions===

On 16 November 2011 it was announced that iiNet was in the final stages of negotiations in the acquisition of Canberra-based telco TransACT. The acquisition was completed on 30 November 2011 at a cost of $60 million.

On 22 December 2011, iiNet announced it would acquire rival ISP Internode for $105 million with the transaction due to be completed late February 2012.

===2013 acquisitions===
On 4 August 2013 iiNet announced it would be purchasing the South Australian ISP Adam Internet for $60 million, after an identical bid by Telstra was rejected by the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) on grounds that the telco giant would use its acquisition of Adam to undercut its rivals&#x27; offers through the use of favourable wholesale supply deals. The sale process was completed at the end of August, with Adam becoming a subsidiary of iiNet.

==AFACT lawsuit==

On 20 November 2008, the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft (AFACT) filed a lawsuit against iiNet in the Federal Court of Australia claiming that iiNet infringed copyright by failing to prevent its subscribers from downloading illegally copied material using the BitTorrent peer-to-peer protocol. The lawsuit was co-filed by 34 film and affiliated companies including Village Roadshow, Universal Pictures, Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox as well the Seven Network, an Australian television broadcaster, and alleges breach of copyright on a number of popular movies and television shows. It was later revealed in a WikiLeaks document AFACT was backed by MPAA.

In response, iiNet issued a statement indicating that iiNet had been passing on the reports of infringement received from AFACT to law enforcement authorities and that iiNet could not disconnect a customer&#x27;s phone line based on an allegation unproven in the courts. Michael Malone, managing director of iiNet, went on to state that &quot;AFACT is arguing that they don&#x27;t want to talk to the police, and we should just cut the customers off&quot;. However, the Statement of Claim filed at the Federal Court does not indicate AFACT are asking for users to be disconnected but that iiNet subscribers are &quot;prevented&quot; from committing copyright infringement.
The case is regarded as a test case for copyright infringement in Australia, and AFACT was represented by Gilbert + Tobin, the same law firm that successfully sued the makers of Kazaa in 2005.

In 2010, Justice Cowdroy in the Federal Court found in favour of iiNet, noting that while iiNet users did infringe, this was not the responsibility of iiNet to deal with.

On 20 April 2012, the High Court of Australia handed down its decision in &quot;Roadshow Films Pty Ltd v iiNet Ltd&quot; which confirmed the intervening Federal Court Full Bench decision affirming the first instance decision of Cowdroy, though not supporting all his reasons. In his reasoning, Gummow J. noted, in particular, that the current legislation did not provide a mechanism to deal with peer-to-peer infringements, and it needed to be addressed by the legislature.

==Products and services==
iiNet Limited provides Broadband and IP telephone communication services to consumers and business customers. Its flagship products are broadband2+ (ADSL2+) services and, more recently, reselling NBN as well as services for businesses.

iiNet was part of the Terria consortium that unsuccessfully bid to build the National Broadband Network in 2008.

iiNet is now a Retail Service Provider (RSP) to serve customers with the NBN (National Broadband Network). Australian consumers can now sign up for services such as fibre to the home (FTTH), FTTC, HFC and fixed wireless. From 2011, iiNet also sold services on the NBN Interim Satellite Service; however, demand for these connections exceeded the available capacity, severely congesting the service. As a result, iiNet withdrew the product from sale in November 2013, and NBN co issued a cease sale for all RSPs in December 2013.

iiNet also offers a variety of mobile services to businesses and the public, which includes post-paid mobile plans and mobile data plans that run on the Vodafone network;
iiNet has offered 1000 MB to members at no additional cost for website hosting from the beginning. As of 1 August 2023 the parent company (TPG) killed all the hosted sites which now re-direct to a page saying hosting is EOL. As of 7 August, they advise that email will also cease: &quot;iiNet has made the decision to stop providing email services in 2023. This change will help us focus on creating better experiences for our core products: internet and mobile&quot;.

==Chime Communications==

Chime Communications is an Australian telecommunications company founded by iiNet in 1996.

It was the focus of a dispute regarding access to the Telstra PSTN network which was settled by the ACCC in 2007.

<doc id="579132" wikidata="Q3216921" url="?curid=579132" title="Lance Barnard">
<text>Lance Herbert Barnard (1 May 19196 August 1997) was an Australian politician and diplomat who served as the third deputy prime minister of Australia from 1972 to 1974. He was the deputy leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) from 1967 to 1974 and held senior ministerial offices in the Whitlam government.

Barnard was born in Launceston, Tasmania, into a prominent political family; his father Claude Barnard was also a federal government minister. He was a timber worker, soldier and schoolteacher before entering politics himself. He was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1954 federal election, winning the seat of Bass that his father had lost five years earlier. Barnard was elected deputy to Gough Whitlam in 1967 and became deputy prime minister following the ALP&#x27;s victory at the 1972 election.

After an initial &quot;duumvirate&quot; in which he and Whitlam both held multiple portfolios, Barnard was appointed Minister for Defence. He subsequently oversaw the merger of several smaller departments into the Department of Defence. In 1974, Barnard lost the deputy leadership to Jim Cairns but remained in the defence portfolio. He resigned from parliament in 1975 to become ambassador to Norway, Finland and Sweden, triggering a by-election that resulted in the loss of his seat to the Liberal Party.

==Early life==
Barnard was born on 1 May 1919 in Launceston, Tasmania. He was one of four children born to Herbert Claude Barnard and the former Martha Melva McKenzie. His father, a trade unionist and locomotive driver, was elected to parliament in 1934, and was a minister in the Chifley government.

Barnard attended Launceston Junior Technical School. He left school during the Great Depression and worked in a timberyard for a few years. He began training as a schoolteacher by attending night school. In 1940, Barnard enlisted in the Australian Army. He fought with the 9th Division in the Middle East and Africa, including in the Battle of El Alamein. His military service left him with a permanent hearing impairment. After returning to Australia in 1945, Barnard qualified as a school teacher and subsequently taught mathematics in various Tasmanian schools.

==Political career==

At the 1954 federal election, Barnard was elected to the Division of Bass for the Labor Party. He defeated the sitting Liberal member Bruce Kekwick, who had defeated Claude Barnard for the seat in 1949. He was later elected to the ALP Federal Executive and a delegate to Federal Conference, where he &quot;more than once put up spirited battles against left-wing influence&quot;.

Following the ALP&#x27;s defeat at the 1966 federal election, Arthur Calwell resigned as party leader and was succeeded by his deputy Gough Whitlam. Barnard was then elected deputy leader with the endorsement of Whitlam, defeating Jim Cairns by 35 votes to 33 on the final ballot following the elimination of Frank Crean. At the time he was described in &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; as &quot;a personal friend of Mr Whitlam and a competent if not brilliant speaker in the House, mainly on his father&#x27;s subject of repatriation, and social services&quot;.

===Whitlam government===

When the ALP won the 1972 federal election Barnard became deputy prime minister. For the first two weeks of Whitlam&#x27;s government, before the full electoral result was known, Whitlam and Barnard formed a two-man ministry, known as a duumvirate, to govern until a full ministry could be announced. Barnard held 14 portfolios including Defence and Immigration. Following the announcement of a complete ministry, Barnard served as Minister for Defence. He personally ensured the recommendations of the Jess Committee and new Defense Force Retirements Benefits Scheme was implemented in 1972.

Following the 1974 federal election, Barnard was challenged for Labor&#x27;s deputy leadership by Jim Cairns. He was defeated by 54 votes to 42. Contemporary sources reporting that he was receiving &quot;fairly active&quot; support from Whitlam, and that Whitlam was &quot;actively canvassing&quot; for him. However, it was later reported that he had received &quot;only token support&quot; from the prime minister.

==Later years==
In June 1975, Whitlam announced that Barnard would leave politics to become Australia&#x27;s resident ambassador to Sweden, with accreditation also to Finland and Norway. He presented his credentials to King Carl XVI Gustaf on 10 September. Bass was resoundingly lost to the Liberals at the ensuing by-election, in which Labor lost 17 per cent of its primary vote. This shock result was seen by many as the beginning of the end for the Whitlam government, which was dismissed five months later.

Barnard returned to Launceston after completing his term as ambassador in 1978. The following year he won ALP preselection to recontest his old seat of Bass, but withdrew four months later for health reasons. In May 1981 he was nominated by the Fraser government as director of the Office of Australian War Graves. He retired in 1983.

Barnard died in Melbourne on 6 August 1997 at the age of 78, following vascular surgery. In response Gough Whitlam stated that &quot;My partnership with Lance Barnard was the most satisfying and significant of my political life. I have lost my oldest and best mate&quot;.

==Personal life==
Barnard married Doris Burston on 6 March 1943. They had two daughters together, Patricia and Suzanne. He was widowed in September 1960.

Barnard married a second time on 11 September 1962 to Jill Cant, the daughter of Senator Harry Cant of Western Australia. They had a son together, Nicholas, and also adopted two Vietnamese orphan girls, Amanda and Jacqueline; Amanda died as an infant.

<doc id="579134" wikidata="Q13557472" url="?curid=579134" title="Fan club">
<text>A fan club is an organized group of fans, generally of a celebrity. Most fan clubs are run by fans who devote considerable time and resources to support them. There are also &quot;official&quot; fan clubs that are run by someone associated with the person or organization the club is centered on. This is the case for many musicians, sports teams, etc.

People in a fan club usually have either a T-shirt or a pin to indicate which fan club they are a part of. All fan clubs have unique paraphernalia that are given or sold to fans to use as an indication. Barbz, who support Nicki Minaj, Hollanders, who support Tom Holland, Carats, who support Seventeen, and Swifties who support Taylor Swift are examples of a fan club.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the
term fan in reference to a dedicated zealot is unclear. The word may have
emerged in the 1800s, when boxing supporters were said to take a “fancy” to pugilistic
sports. Among modern sports fans, however, the title is considered a
shortened version of the word fanatic, as in “boxing fanatic,” an indication
of the dedication of fan club members.

==Functions==
Larger fan clubs may organize events and fundraising relating to what they are based on. In some cases, the money that is raised goes directly to fan club members or to fund the club itself.

There are two main kinds of fan clubs, there are fan clubs that do not require an official registration process and others that do. Fan clubs that do require a formal registration usually require a membership fee. Different fan clubs have different systems, however most clubs have an annual membership fee. These fees will be used to run the foundation. If the fan clubs are for certain fashion brands, they may use those fees for advertisement.

The term groupie is a slang that is commonly used in reference to fans of a particular musician, band, or celebrity who follow the group- or individual- while they are touring, or who attend as many of their public appearances as possible. The word is often used to describe female fans seeking sexual relationships with musicians. They often value musicians themselves over their music.

Groupies are more personally affiliated with the band or celebrity they follow, however fans are not affiliated as they are more reserved than groupies would be. Most fan clubs are online and fans who are a part of these clubs, do not usually get to have personal connections with whom they are fans of.

==Internet==

Today, many fan clubs have websites to support their efforts. Technology allows individuals in fan clubs to communicate across the world. These sites usually have photos and information on the object of their affection. For example, a fan site dedicated to musicians might have photos, videos, discussion boards, and information on upcoming concerts.

Fan clubs are growing in number thanks to technological advances and influences on social media.

<text>Rodrigue Biron (born September 8, 1934) is a politician in Quebec, Canada. He was leader of the Union Nationale political party from 1976 to 1980, when he joined the Parti Québécois (PQ). He served as Minister of Industry, Commerce and Tourism in the PQ government.

==Background==

Biron was manager of his family’s sewer pipe factory in Sainte-Croix, Quebec. He and his wife Huguette Dionne have had three children. His father Paul ran as the Liberal candidate for Lotbinière in the 1958 federal election. Biron&#x27;s late brother Paul Jr. (1933-2015) was a perennial candidate in provincial politics who has run under different labels including Parti Québécois in the Lévis in 1970 and Parti démocratie chrétienne du Québec, which was renamed Parti Unité Nationale in 2012. Prior to entering provincial politics, Rodrigue Biron had been a card-carrying supporter of the Liberal Party of Quebec. He also served as Chair of the federal Liberal Association for Lotbinière in 1962.

==Mayor==

Biron served as Mayor of the Town of Sainte-Croix, Quebec, from 1971 to 1973.

==Member of the legislature==

He became the leader of the conservative Union Nationale (UN) party on May 23, 1976. The UN had once dominated Quebec provincial politics, but in the 1973 election, it lost all of the seats that it had held in the previous National Assembly. However, the party returned to the National Assembly of Quebec by winning a by-election in 1974.

Biron led the party to a modest comeback in the 1976 election, winning 11 seats. The party won one anglophone riding, where UN candidate William Shaw was elected capitalizing on discontent with Bill 22 language legislation passed by the Liberal government of Robert Bourassa.

The 1976 election had been won by the sovereigntist PQ, however, and the nationalist vote on which the UN had counted for support gravitated toward that party. Biron resigned as Union Nationale leader on March 3, 1980, campaigned in favor of the Yes side in the 1980 Quebec referendum on sovereignty and joined the PQ on November 11 of that year.

In the 1981 election, he was elected as a PQ member of the National Assembly, and served as Minister of Industry, Commerce and Tourism. Meanwhile, his former party, the Union Nationale, was again wiped out in the 1981 election, this time for good—the party never won another seat, and eventually ceased to exist.

The PQ lost the 1985 election, and Biron lost his seat.

==Federal politics==

In 1997, he unsuccessfully ran for the leadership of the Bloc Québécois, a federal (Canadian) sovereigntist party. When Preston Manning wanted to form the United Alternative, he recruited Biron to the steering committee.

<text>Radio Mirchi (&quot;Mirchi&quot; in Hindi meaning red chilli), also known as 98.3 Mirchi, is a nationwide network of private FM radio stations in India. It is owned by the EntertainmentNetwork India Ltd (ENIL), which is one of the subsidiaries of The Times Group. The tagline of Radio Mirchi is &quot;Mirchi Sunnewaale Always Khush!&quot; (&quot;Mirchi Listeners are Always Happy!&quot;). It is the first privately owned radio station in India.

Radio Mirchi maintains weekly music charts, or record charts, for India. The most followed charts are Mirchi Top 20 (Bollywood Songs, now celebrities select their favourites) and Indie Pop 10 (Independent Music). Both of these charts rank recorded music according to popularity. These charts are published on a weekly basis in the Indian English-language daily newspaper, The Times of India, and on Radio Mirchi&#x27;s official website.

Mirchi has its stations in India and also in GCC countries: UAE, Qatar, and Bahrain.

As per the latest IRS data released in 2017, Radio Mirchi has emerged as the number one FM broadcaster in Delhi and Mumbai, as well as in the top 8 metros taken together.

==History==
The original avatar of Radio Mirchi was Times FM. Radio Mirchi began operations in 1993 in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. Until 1993, All India Radio or AIR, a government undertaking, was the only radio broadcaster in India. The government then took the initiative to privatize the radio broadcasting sector. It sold airtime blocks on its FM channels in Indore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Varanasi, Visakhapatnam and Goa to private operators, who developed their own program content. The Times Group operated its brand, Times FM, till June 1998. After that, the government decided not to renew contracts given to private operators.

===First round of licenses===
In 2000, the government announced the auction of 108 FM frequencies across India. ENIL won the largest number of frequencies, and thus started its operations under the brand name Radio Mirchi.

===Second round of licences===
In January 2006, Radio Mirchi purchased 25 frequencies in the second wave of licences that were issued by the Government of India. This pushes the Radio Mirchi presence in 32 centres. In the first wave of launches, Indore was the first city in India having grade of first private radio channel. Times decided to start radio channel to address the mass audience as advertisers can be attracted by showing a low cost per thousand.

===Third round of licenses===
Radio Mirchi invested above Rs.339 crore during phase III auctions and purchased 17 new channels in new cities such as Chandigarh, Kochi, Kozhikode, Jammu, Srinagar, Guwahati and Shillong, as well as in existing cities such as Bangalore, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Pune, Kanpur, Lucknow, Jaipur, Nagpur and Surat. This pushes Radio Mirchi presence in 49 centres.

=== GCC countries expansion ===
Radio Mirchi started operations across UAE, streaming across three frequencies : 97.3FM in Abu Dhabi, 88.8FM in Dubai and the Northern Emirates and 95.6FM in Al Ain &amp; Bahrain 104.2 and Qatar 89.6 Mirchi One In partnership with ONE FM Qatar ki dhadkan All the RJs have been recruited from various Radio Mirchi stations in India including Anup Chugh, with a total seven who will take to the air.

Radio Mirchi UAE is now KADAK FM but later, Radio Mirchi made a comeback to the UAE in 2021 with 102.4 FM Mirchi.

<doc id="579147" wikidata="Q213150" url="?curid=579147" title="Charles Williams-Wynn (1775–1850)">
<text>Charles Watkin Williams-Wynn PC (9 October 1775 – 2 September 1850) was a British politician of the early- to mid-19th century. He held office in both Tory and Whig governments and was Father of the House of Commons between 1847 and 1850.

==Background and education==
Born into an ancient and grand Welsh family, Williams-Wynn was the second son of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 4th Baronet, by his second wife Charlotte Grenville, daughter of Prime Minister George Grenville. His great-great-grandfather Sir William Williams, 1st Baronet, served as Speaker of the House of Commons from 1680 to 1685. On his mother&#x27;s side, he was the nephew of William Wyndham Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville and George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham and the first cousin of Richard Temple-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos. Williams-Wynn was educated privately, at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford. He was called to the Bar, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, in 1798. At Westminster School Williams-Wynn became acquainted with the poet Robert Southey, whom he later supported financially.

==Political career==
In 1797 he was elected to parliament for the notorious rotten borough of Old Sarum, where he succeeded Richard Wellesley, 2nd Earl of Mornington. He resigned this seat in 1799, when he was elected for Montgomeryshire, which constituency he would represent for the next 51 years. 

During the French Revolutionary War Montgomeryshire had failed to raise a single unit of part-time unit Yeomanry Cavalry or Volunteer Infantry for home defence and internal security duties. After the shortlived Peace of Amiens broke down in 1803, Williams-Wynn overcame the apathy and the county rapidly two formed Troops of Yeomanry cavalry by August 1803. Williams-Wynn took command as Major-Commandant By 2 November this had expanded into a large force, the Montgomeryshire Volunteer Legion. In contemporary terminology a &#x27;Legion&#x27; was an all-arms force, and soon after its formation the Montgomeryshire unit comprised three troops of Yeomanry cavalry each 40 strong, and 20 Companies of Volunteer infantry, with Watkins-Wynn as Lieutenant-Colonel-Commandant and commander of the legion&#x27;s cavalry. The Volunteer Infantry were replaced by the Local Militia in 1808, but the cavalry troops carried on as the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry. These were disbanded in 1828, but in view of the disturbances in north-east Wales Williams-Wynn applied to reform the regiment in 1831. It saw service in 1838–39 during the Chartist riots. Williams-Wynn finally retired from the command in 1844 at the age of 77.

In 1806 he was appointed Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department in the Ministry of All the Talents led by his uncle Lord Grenville. He remained in this post until the government fell the following year. Williams-Wynn was an active member of parliament and considered an authority on the procedure of the House of Commons. This led him to be nominated for the post of Speaker of the House of Commons in 1817. However, he was defeated by Charles Manners-Sutton. During the late 1810s, Williams-Wynn was the leader of a group of MPs that tried to establish a third party in the House of Commons, acting on behalf of his cousin Lord Buckingham. However, the third party never materialised and the group instead joined the Tories.

In January 1822 Williams-Wynn was admitted to the Privy Council and appointed President of the Board of Control, with a seat in the cabinet, in the Tory government of the Earl of Liverpool. He remained in this post also in the governments of George Canning and Lord Goderich. However, when the Duke of Wellington became Prime Minister in 1828, Williams-Wynn was not offered a position in the government.

This drove him into opposition, and when the Whigs came to power in November 1830 under Lord Grey, Williams-Wynn was appointed Secretary at War, although without a seat in the cabinet. He only remained in this post until April of the following year, and held no other position during the three remaining years of the Whig government. In 1834 the Tories returned to office under Sir Robert Peel, and Wynn was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, but again was not a member of the cabinet. The Peel government fell already in April 1835 and Wynn never held office again. However, he was said to have thrice rejected the post of Governor-General of India. Wynn remained Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire until his death, and from 1847 to 1850 he was Father of the House of Commons; at the time of his death, he was the final MP from the 18th century still in Parliament.

He was elected as the first president, from 1823 to 1841, of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland and as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1827.

==Family==
Wynn married Mary Cunliffe, daughter of Sir Foster Cunliffe, 3rd Baronet and Harriet Kinloch, in 1806. They had seven children, two sons and five daughters. His eldest daughter Charlotte Williams-Wynn was a well-known diarist; his son, also named Charles, followed him into Parliament. Williams-Wynn died in September 1850, aged 74.

<text>The Brundtland Commission, formerly the World Commission on Environment and Development, was a sub-organization of the United Nations (UN) that aimed to unite countries in pursuit of sustainable development. It was founded in 1983 when Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, appointed Gro Harlem Brundtland, former Prime Minister of Norway, as chairperson of the commission. Brundtland was chosen due to her strong background in the sciences and public health.

The Brundtland Commission officially dissolved in 1987 after releasing &quot;Our Common Future&quot;, also known as the &quot;Brundtland Report&quot;. The document popularized the term &quot;sustainable development&quot; and won the Grawemeyer Award in 1991. In 1988, the Center for Our Common Future replaced the commission.

==History==

=== Before Brundtland ===
Ten years after the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, a number of global environmental challenges had not been adequately addressed.

During the 1980s, the World Bank increasingly intervened with the economic and social policies of the Third World, most notably with the events at Bretton Woods in 1945. Neoliberalism and economic globalization dominated the political agenda of leading trading nations, led by the US&#x27;s Ronald Reagan and the UK&#x27;s Margaret Thatcher.

The underlying problem was reducing poverty in low-income countries without exacerbating global and local environmental burdens. Neither high-income Northern countries nor low-income Southern countries were willing to give up economic growth, but environmental threats such as pollution, acid rain, deforestation, desertification, and ozone depletion were impossible to overlook. Countries needed some way to reconcile economic development with environmental protection.

Views differed on several questions:

* Were local environmental problems the result of local developments or of a global economic system that forced low-income countries to destroy their environment? 
* Did environmental burdens result from destructive economic growth or a lack of economic development? 
* Would reconciling the economy and the environment require more resource-efficient technologies (for example), or social, political, and structural changes?

The 1980 World Conservation Strategy of the International Union for Conservation of Nature was the first report that included a very brief chapter on a concept called &quot;sustainable development&quot;. It focused on global structural changes and was not widely read. The UN created an independent commission, which was asked to provide an analysis of existing problems and ideas for solving them, similar to earlier commissions such as the Independent Commission on International Development Issues (Brandt Commission) and the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues (Palme Commission).

=== Establishment ===
In December 1983, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, asked the former Prime Minister of Norway, Gro Harlem Brundtland, to create an organization independent of the UN to focus on environmental and developmental problems and solutions after an affirmation by the General Assembly resolution in the fall of 1983. This new organization was the Brundtland Commission, formally known as the World Commission on Environment and Development. It was initially headed by Brundtland as Chairman and Mansour Khalid as Vice-Chairman.

The 1983 General Assembly established the Commission with Resolution 38/161, &quot;Process of Preparation of the Environmental Perspective to the Year 2000 and Beyond&quot;. In A/RES/38/161, the General Assembly:
:8. Suggests that the Special Commission, when established, should focus mainly on the following terms of reference for its work:
:(a) To propose long-term environmental strategies for achieving sustainable development to the year 2000 and beyond;
:(b) To recommend ways in which concern for the environment may be translated into greater cooperation among developing countries and between countries at different stages of economic and social development and lead to the achievement of common and mutually supportive objectives which take account of the interrelationships between people, resources, environment, and development;
:(c) To consider ways and means by which the international community can deal more effectively with environmental concerns, in the light of the other recommendations in its report;
:(d) To help define shared perceptions of long-term environmental issues and of the appropriate efforts needed to deal successfully with the problems of protecting and enhancing the environment, a long-term agenda for action during the coming decades, and aspirational goals for the world community, taking into account the relevant resolutions of the session of a special character of the Governing Council in 1982;
==Definition of sustainable development==

The Brundtland Report was intended to respond to the conflict between globalized economic growth and accelerating ecological degradation by redefining &quot;economic development&quot; in terms of &quot;sustainable development&quot;. It is credited with crafting the most prevalent definition of sustainability:&quot;Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.&quot;

=== Development ===
&quot;Our Common Future&quot; was published by Oxford University Press in 1987. The document was the culmination of a “900-day” international exercise which catalogued, analyzed, and synthesized written submissions and expert testimony from “senior government representatives, scientists and experts, research institutes, industrialists, representatives of non-governmental organizations, and the general public” held at public hearings throughout the world.

The Brundtland Commission&#x27;s mandate was to:“[1] re-examine the critical issues of environment and development and to formulate innovative, concrete, and realistic action proposals to deal with them; [2] strengthen international cooperation on environment and development and assess and propose new forms of cooperation that can break out of existing patterns and influence policies and events in the direction of needed change; and [3] raise the level of understanding and commitment to action on the part of individuals, voluntary organizations, businesses, institutes, and governments” (1987: 347). Furthermore,“The Commission has focused its attention on the areas of population, food security, the loss of species and genetic resources, energy, industry, and human settlements - realizing that all of these are connected and cannot be treated in isolation one from another” (1987: 27).

=== Analysis ===
The commission&#x27;s definition contains two main elements:
*the concept of &quot;needs&quot;, in particular those of the global poor, to which overriding priority should be given
*limitations imposed by the technology and social organization on the environment&#x27;s ability to meet present and future needs
These ideas are essentially equivalent to intergenerational equity; &quot;needs&quot; are basic and essential, economic growth will facilitate their fulfilment, and equity is encouraged by citizen participation.

Another key element in the definition is the unity of environment and development. The Brundtland Commission argued against the assertions of the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment and provided an alternative perspective on sustainable development, unique from that of the 1980 World Conservation Strategy of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The commission suggested that while the &quot;environment&quot; was previously perceived as a sphere separate from human emotion or action, and &quot;development&quot; was a term habitually used to describe political goals or economic progress, it is more comprehensive to understand the two terms in relation to each other (i.e., one can better understand the environment in relation to development and vice versa because they cannot and should not be distinguished as separate entities). Brundtland argued:&quot;...the &quot;environment&quot; is where we live; and &quot;development&quot; is what we all do in attempting to improve our lot within that abode. The two are inseparable.&quot;The Brundtland Commission insisted that the environment should also include social and political atmospheres and circumstances, as well as how development is not just about how poor countries can ameliorate their situation, but what the entire world, including developed countries, can do to ameliorate their common situation.

The Brundtland Commission Report recognized that human resource development in the form of poverty reduction, gender equity, and wealth redistribution was crucial to formulating strategies for environmental conservation and that environmental limits to economic growth in industrialized and industrializing societies existed. The report offered “the analysis, the broad remedies, and the recommendations for a sustainable course of development” within such societies.

=== Responses to the definition ===
The Brundtland definition is open to interpretation, allowing for widespread support from diverse efforts, groups and organizations, and has also been criticized for being &quot;self-defeating and compromised rhetoric&quot;. Despite this, the issue of sustainable development entered the agenda of international and national institutions, corporations, and cities.

==Structure==
The Brundtland Commission was chaired by former Norwegian prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland. Politicians, civil servants, and environmental experts made up the majority of the members. Members of the commission represented 21 different nations (both developed and developing countries are included). Many of the members were important political figures in their home country, such as William Ruckelshaus, former head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. All members of the commission were appointed by both Brundtland and Khalid.

The commission focused on setting up networks to promote environmental stewardship. Most of these networks make connections between governments and non-government entities, such as Bill Clinton&#x27;s Council on Sustainable Development, which invites government and business leaders to come together and share ideas on how to encourage sustainable development. The Brundtland Commission has been the most successful in forming international ties between governments and multinational corporations. The international structure and scope of the Brundtland Commission allowed multiple problems (such as deforestation and ozone depletion) to be looked at from a holistic approach.

==Sustainability efforts==

The three main pillars of sustainable development include economic growth, environmental protection, and social equality. While many people agree that each of these three ideas contributes to the overall idea of sustainability, it is difficult to find evidence of equal levels of initiative for the three pillars in countries&#x27; policies worldwide. With the overwhelming number of countries that put economic growth on the forefront of sustainable development, it is evident that the other two pillars have been suffering, especially with the overall well-being of the environment in a dangerously unhealthy state. The Brundtland Commission put forth a conceptual framework that many nations agree with and want to try to make a difference within their countries, but it has been difficult to change these concepts about sustainability into concrete actions and programs. After the commission released &quot;Our Common Future&quot;, it called for an international meeting to take place to map out more concrete initiatives and goals, which took place in Rio de Janeiro. A comprehensive plan of action, known as Agenda 21, came out of the meeting, and entailed actions to be taken globally, nationally, and locally to make life on Earth more sustainable going into the future.

===Economic growth===
Economic growth is the pillar that most groups focus on when attempting to attain more sustainable efforts and development. In trying to build their economies, many countries focus their efforts on resource extraction, which leads to unsustainable efforts for environmental protection and economic growth sustainability. While the commission was able to help to change the association between economic growth and resource extraction, the total worldwide consumption of resources is projected to increase in the future. Agenda 21 reinforces the importance of finding methods to generate economic growth without hurting the environment.

===Environmental protection===
Environmental protection has become more important to government and businesses over the last 20 years, leading to great improvements in the number of people willing to invest in green technologies. For the second consecutive year in 2010, the US and Europe added more power capacity from renewable sources such as the wind and sun. In 2011 the efforts continued with 45 new wind energy projects in 25 different states. The focus on environmental protection transpired globally, including a great deal of investment in renewable energy power capacity. Eco-city development occurring around the world helps develop and implement water conservation, smart grids with renewable energy sources, LED street lights, and energy-efficient buildings. The consumption gap remains: &quot;roughly 80 percent of the natural resources used each year are consumed by about 20 percent of the world&#x27;s population&quot;.

===Social equality===
Social equality and equity are pillars of sustainable development that focus on the social well-being of people. The growing gap between incomes of the rich and poor is evident throughout the world with the incomes of the richer households increasing relative to the incomes of middle- or lower-class households. The disparity is attributed partly to the land distribution patterns in rural areas where the majority live on land. Global inequality has been declining, but the richest 1% of the world&#x27;s population owns 40% of the world&#x27;s wealth and the poorest 50% owns around 1%. The Commission reduced the number of people living on less than a dollar a day to just half of what it used to be, as many can approach the environment and use it. These achievements can also be attributed to economic growth in China and India.

<text>RPH Australia is the national peak representative organisation for a unique Australian network of radio reading services designed to meet the daily information needs of people who, for any reason, are unable to access printed material. It is estimated that 22% of the Australian population has a print disability (over 5 million).

==History==
Historically, RPH stood for &quot;Radio for the Print Handicapped&quot;, and these services began in Australia in 1975 on Melbourne&#x27;s 3ZZ.

On 23 July 1978, the Minister for Post and Telecommunications announced, &quot;The establishment of a special radio communications service for the blind and other people with reading difficulties.&quot; 

The federal government began its direct funding of the service with a $250,000 grant in the 1981–82 budget.

Initially using marine band (today&#x27;s extended AM broadcast band) frequencies, stations in Hobart, Melbourne, and Sydney began operating. 7RPH Hobart went to air in June 1982. 3RPH Melbourne was officially opened in December the same year.

By 1984–85, RPH services were also operating in Brisbane and Canberra. After another review, the specialised stations of the service transferred to normal broadcast band frequencies in 1990 and 1991. 

Material from the network is heard on a small number of non-network community stations in Australia and on the Radio Reading Service of New Zealand.

In December 2013, all RPH Australia network stations joined the new VAST satellite platform.

<doc id="579163" wikidata="Q25056015" url="?curid=579163" title="Prism (band)">
<text>Prism (styled as PRiSM) is a Canadian rock band formed in Vancouver in 1977. They were originally active from 1977 to 1984 and have been active again from 1987 to present. Their classic line-up consisted of lead singer Ron Tabak, guitarist Lindsay Mitchell, keyboardist John Hall, bassist Allen Harlow and drummer Rocket Norton.

The band&#x27;s sound is a mix of album-oriented rock (AOR) and pop rock. They have released a total of eight studio albums, three compilation albums and one live album.

Prism&#x27;s success has been primarily in Canada where they won the Canadian music industry Juno Award for &#x27;Group of the Year&#x27; in 1981, although they also reached the US top 40 charts with 1981&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Him Know&quot;. Prism is also noteworthy for launching the careers of several former group members, including international record producer Bruce Fairbairn, songwriter Jim Vallance, Powder Blues Band frontman Tom Lavin and Headpins and Chilliwack musician Ab Bryant. A pre-fame Bryan Adams also contributed as a songwriter to several early Prism releases.

In March 2011 the band&#x27;s 1977 song &quot;Spaceship Superstar&quot; was chosen as the wake-up song for the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; crew members. This was a significant point in history as it was the last day that the crews of &quot;Discovery&quot; and the International Space Station were together before &quot;Discovery&quot; returned to Earth, in the last mission of &quot;Discovery&quot;.

== History ==
=== Sunshyne and Seeds of Time ===
Prism was the brainchild of musician-producer Bruce Fairbairn, and comprised members from two local Vancouver bands, Sunshyne and Seeds of Time. Fairbairn was originally a trumpet player in Sunshyne, a jazz-rock band, in the early 1970s. Around 1974, the band switched their format to blues-rock by recruiting guitarist Lindsay Mitchell from Seeds of Time as their frontman. The Seeds of Time were a blues-oriented group that had recently wound down after a mildly successful recording career, in which they placed two songs in the Canadian Top 100 (RPM Magazine): &quot;My Home Town&quot; reached No. 76 and &quot;Crying the Blues&quot; reached No. 90, both in 1971.

Still operating under the name Sunshyne, Fairbairn then decided to pursue a recording contract for the band. After a year of trying, he was unsuccessful and in mid-1975 he approached former Sunshyne member Jim Vallance for help in reworking the demos. Some changes were made. First, Vallance helped with new arrangements on two of Mitchell&#x27;s songs, and also began contributing some of his own at Fairbairn&#x27;s request. Ron Tabak was recruited to replace Mitchell on lead vocals, while Mitchell remained as the guitarist, and alternate songwriter. A set of five demo songs, two by Mitchell and three by Vallance, were then recorded and sent to record labels across Canada. An executive at GRT Records liked one of Vallance&#x27;s songs, &quot;Open Soul Surgery&quot;, and offered Fairbairn&#x27;s project a recording contract in 1976.

=== Prism debut ===
Over the next year, Fairbairn produced the group&#x27;s debut album. At the time there was no fixed band line-up for the recording, and Fairbairn employed various musicians from around the local Vancouver music scene. Tabak, Mitchell and Vallance were relative constants during the sessions: others who participated in the recording sessions included Steve Pugsley, Richard Christie, Peter Bjerring, Dave Calder, Tom and Jack Lavin, David Sinclair, Dave Pickell, John Hall and Graeme Coleman.

Eventually, the group line-up &quot;officially&quot; coalesced into Ron Tabak (vocals), John Hall (keyboards, synthesizers, backing vocals), Lindsay Mitchell (lead guitar, backing vocals), Tom Lavin (rhythm guitar and bass), Ab Bryant (bass) and Jim Vallance (drums). The group was still known as Sunshyne at this point and Bryant had not actually played on any of the recording sessions, joining shortly after they were completed.

By the time the album was completed, seven of its nine songs were written by Vallance, with one by Mitchell and one by Lavin. As the album was about to go into production, some changes were made to the credits. The label&#x27;s management did not like the name &quot;Sunshyne&quot;, so they released a pre-LP teaser single, &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Lookin&#x27; Anymore&quot; with &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Find Out&quot; as a B-side, under the group name &quot;Stanley Screamer&quot;. That moniker was not popular with the group, so after trying out several other names at local gigs (including &quot;Under Construction&quot;), the members settled on &quot;Prism&quot; as the band&#x27;s new name. Also, Vallance decided to use a pseudonym, Rodney Higgs, for his work as the band&#x27;s drummer and songwriter. As Prism&#x27;s principal songwriter, Vallance was afraid that if the album failed and his real name was associated with it, he would never land another recording contract. By using the pseudonym, he could get around that problem.

Finally, Fairbairn (horns) and Tom Keenlyside (saxophone) received credit as session musicians, with Fairbairn acting as road manager on US and Canadian tour dates. The others who played were not credited on the finished album as musicians, but were listed in the credits in a section labelled &quot;special thanks&quot;.

The band was then taken on by Bruce Allen, arguably the biggest rock music manager in Canada at the time.

The self-titled &quot;Prism&quot; album was released on GRT (Ariola Records in the US) in May 1977. Although Ab Bryant appears on the back jacket, he had only been hired days before the photo was taken. But within a few months of the album&#x27;s debut, Bryant exited the group to join the Rocket Norton Band, later joining Chilliwack (and later still, The Headpins). Lavin switched back to bass in Bryant&#x27;s absence and Sunshyne&#x27;s trombonist, Ralph Eppel, joined alongside adjunct members Bruce Fairbairn and Tom Keenlyside in Prism&#x27;s horn section for their ensuing tour (with Vallance still drumming as &quot;Rodney Higgs&quot;).

After the first leg of touring ended in late August 1977, Vallance resigned as drummer, but remained as principal songwriter. Vallance did not enjoy the lifestyle of touring, preferring instead to write songs in his home studio. He was replaced with Seeds of Time alumnus Rocket Norton, who was also leading his own Rocket Norton Band at the time.

Lavin was let go in December 1977 and went on to form the Powder Blues Band, who in the next few years hit the Canadian charts with several singles and albums.

Prism&#x27;s &quot;Spaceship Superstar&quot; and &quot;Take Me to the Kaptin&quot; were released as singles and both charted in Canada. The debut album reached platinum status in sales (100,000+ units sold) by the next year.

=== 1978–1981: Fixed line-up ===
As Prism was preparing to record their follow up album, some changes happened to the line-up that remained fixed for the next three years. Firstly, another Seeds of Time alumnus, Allen Harlow (real name Allen Steven Hawirko), was brought in as bassist, in January 1978, to replace Tom Lavin. Then, Vallance quit the band as principal songwriter. Upon rehearsing song demos with the band, Mitchell and Vallance had fallen into heated disagreements over the style of songwriting. When it became apparent they were at an impasse, Vallance elected to go, leaving two songs for the band, &quot;N-N-N-No!&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Like The Wind&quot; (both credited to Rodney Higgs as songwriter). But his departure left a gaping hole in songwriting for the band to fill. Fortunately, Al Harlow supplied two songs, and the remaining members&#x27; songs filled out the album. &quot;See Forever Eyes&quot; was again produced by Fairbairn. The album was released in June 1978, with the title track and Harlow&#x27;s songs, &quot;Flyin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Take Me Away&quot;, released as singles. &quot;See Forever Eyes&quot; reached platinum status by the next year.

Just before their 1978 tour, saxophonist Tom Keenlyside was dropped, but Fairbairn and Eppel remained on trumpet and trombone respectively. Keenlyside went on to join Lavin in the Powder Blues Band.

On July 16, 1978, Prism played a show at Royal Oak Music Theater in Royal Oak, Michigan that was broadcast by Westwood One Radio and later appeared as a much sought after promo album. That same summer, the band toured the US and Canada as the opening act for Meat Loaf&#x27;s Bat Out of Hell Tour.

During early 1979, the band returned to the studio to record their third and what would be their most commercially successful album. Mitchell was now the principal songwriter and wrote/co-wrote four songs for the album. Although it was his largest contribution yet for a single album, it fell short of what was needed. In an effort to help, Vallance became involved again and brought along his new songwriting partner, Bryan Adams, to contribute to the songwriting effort. Adams, who at the time was an unsigned recording artist, wrote/co-wrote three songs. Vallance, meanwhile, co-wrote one track as Rodney Higgs, arranged two tracks using his real name and played drums, bass and guitars on several tracks without credit.

For their 1979 tour, the two remaining horns were dumped, but Fairbairn remained involved with the band and organized a six piece horn section, that appeared with the band on selected dates for the next few tours.

Their third album, &quot;Armageddon&quot;, was released in June 1979 to much promotional hype. &quot;Virginia&quot;, &quot;Armageddon&quot; and &quot;Night to Remember&quot; were released as singles and charted in Canada. The album reached double platinum status (in excess of 200,000 units sold) by the next year and helped garner the band their lone Canadian music industry Juno Award for &#x27;Group of the Year&#x27; in 1981. Also, Mitchell received the SOCAN Song of the Year award for &quot;Night to Remember&quot; in 1980. The title track &quot;Armageddon&quot; became one of the band&#x27;s most recognizable songs. Despite the album&#x27;s commercial success, the record label, GRT, went into receivership and the band signed on with Capitol Records.

The group&#x27;s next record, &quot;Young and Restless&quot;, was released in May 1980. This was the first Prism album written without any credited contributions from Vallance/Higgs: all songs were written by Mitchell, Harlow or Norton. (Vallance claims he did participate in the making of the album as an arranger, and as an uncredited co-writer of one track, but admits that his participation in &quot;Young and Restless&quot; was &quot;minimal&quot;). The album spun off Prism&#x27;s highest-charting single, also called &quot;Young and Restless&quot;, which peaked at No. 14 on the Canadian chart.

At this point, Prism parted company with their long-time producer and founder Bruce Fairbairn, and recorded one new track for their 1980 greatest hits album, &quot;All the Best from Prism&quot;, with new producer John S. Carter, who was known professionally simply as &quot;Carter&quot;; Carter was the group&#x27;s producer for all their subsequent releases through 1983. The new song, &quot;Cover Girl&quot;, was written by Mitchell and Bryan Adams and was released as a single but did not chart.

Fairbairn went on to a successful career as a record producer. He died of a heart attack on May 17, 1999, in his Vancouver home, aged 49.

=== 1981–1984: Henry Small era ===
At a show at the Danforth Music Hall in Toronto on December 9, 1980, singer Ron Tabak&#x27;s performance was so lackluster that he was fired by the band&#x27;s manager Bruce Allen in early 1981 at Capitol&#x27;s insistence and the band&#x27;s support. Various reasons cited were his drug and alcohol abuse, conflicts with other band members, several run-ins with the law and/or lack of songwriting ability. Vocalist Henry Small (ex-Scrubbaloe Caine and Small Wonder) was brought in after being recommended by his friend and former bandmate, Paul Dean (of Loverboy).

Tabak, with the help of drummer Norton, formed The Ron Tabak Band in 1981, which attracted interest from CBS Records. But when the CBS deal fell through, a discouraged Tabak left the music business altogether.

In the meantime, keyboardist John Hall, unhappy with Tabak&#x27;s firing, left Prism as well and the new four-piece line-up (Small/Mitchell/Harlow/Norton) recorded the album &quot;Small Change&quot; in the summer of 1981, which was released that December. Keyboards on the album were handled by Jimmy Phillips (who had previously played with The Guess Who in 1979 under his real name of Jimmy Grabowski) and guitarist Randy Hansen and harmonica player Norton Buffalo were among those who also contributed to the sessions for &quot;Small Change&quot;. Plus Harlow&#x27;s and Norton&#x27;s contributions to the record were reportedly minimal, as Capital had more session players brought in, in hopes of a hit. The lead track &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Him Know&quot;, written by Jim Vallance (using his real name) and Bryan Adams, became Prism&#x27;s first top 40 hit(and the first top US 40 hit for Adams and Vallance as songwriter) (No. 39 in early 1982) in the US and a No. 1 single on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s new Rock Tracks chart. The follow-up single &quot;Turn on Your Radar&quot; also charted at No. 64, becoming their fifth and final American charter.

In 1981 Small, Mitchell, Harlow and Norton were joined for touring by keyboardists Jamie Bowers (also rhythm guitar) and David Stone (ex-Rainbow).

During another Christmas show at the Danforth Music Hall on December 14, 1981, the group was playing with fellow Canadian rockers Klaatu. When Klaatu received a better response and most of the audience left before Prism had finished their set, the band realized that their new line-up was not being embraced by fans, so Mitchell, Harlow, Norton, Bowers and Stone, who were also chafing over Bruce Allen and Capital designating Henry Small in charge of musical direction and rehearsals in Los Angeles, decided to leave Prism by early 1982. With Mitchell&#x27;s departure, Prism now had no original members left.

In 1982 because of debts, ownership of the band&#x27;s name temporarily was held by Allen, who decided to build on the success of &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Him Know&quot;, by putting the band on the road with a line-up of Small, guitarist Paul Warren (ex-Rare Earth), bassist John Trivers, keyboardist Robyn Robbins (from Bob Seger&#x27;s Silver Bullet Band) and Doug Madick (formerly of Starz and Hellcats) on drums.

Although the band had essentially broken up by the end of 1982, Small decided to continue recording as a solo artist but using the Prism name and assembled a group of session musicians, including Alan Pasqua, Richie Zito, Mike Baird and backup vocalists Timothy B. Schmit (Eagles), Bobby Kimball (Toto) and Bill Champlin (Chicago) to assist him. Together, this ad hoc line-up released the album &quot;Beat Street&quot; under the Prism name in July 1983. The album was not a commercial success and failed to spin off any charting singles. In a 2006 interview, Small explained why: &quot;Bruce Allen had a falling out with the president of EMI at the time, over Tom Cochrane, and suddenly the &quot;Beat Street&quot; album, which at that point had been charting all over the east coast of the US, was basically pulled by Capitol Records. I had put together a great touring band but Bruce called and said the tour was off and soon after, Prism was dropped from the label. That was heartbreaking but not unusual in the business.&quot; Small—by now the group&#x27;s only member—essentially retired from using the Prism name in early 1984 and the &#x27;group&#x27; became defunct.

=== Death of Ron Tabak and medical legacy ===
Several former members of Prism were in the preliminary discussion stages of a Prism reunion in late 1984. Al Harlow and Ron Tabak had made plans to spend Christmas 1984 together at Harlow&#x27;s place in Kitsilano. Tabak decided to cycle to Harlow&#x27;s home on Christmas Eve as a way to get some exercise. The roads were snow-covered, and he rode at night without a headlight and helmet and had consumed a large quantity of alcohol. On the way, near Kingsway and Earles Street, Tabak was struck by a passing vehicle, fell and hit his head on the pavement. He was taken by ambulance to the Burnaby General Hospital where he abruptly became abusive and uncooperative, prompting staff to call Burnaby RCMP. Two constables arrested him, thinking he was under the influence of alcohol, and he was held in Burnaby cells. He was later discovered unconscious in his jail cell and was rushed by ambulance to Royal Columbian Hospital. A second examination discovered a blood clot had developed on the right side of his brain. Tabak died of an aneurysm on Christmas Day 1984, before a pending neurosurgical operation could be performed. Previously discussed plans for a Prism reunion were canceled, out of respect for Tabak&#x27;s death.

===Legacy===
Tabak&#x27;s death due to an undiagnosed brain bleed, along with that of British Columbia Ambulance Service Supervisor John Phillips in early 1985, led to changes that ultimately resulted in the creation of regional &#x27;trauma centres&#x27; in the Lower Mainland (Lions Gate Hospital, Vancouver General Hospital and Royal Columbian Hospital) as well as new, more stringent criteria for diagnosis and care of potential head injury patients. As in the case with both Tabak and Phillips, even if a patient was impaired by alcohol and even if they were combative, they were restrained and managed in hospital, rather than being arrested. As well, paramedics assessing a patient who presented as Tabak did (the clear history and evidence of him having hit his head on pavement and having been struck by a car) would take that patient directly to the closest Trauma Centre where specialized equipment and care were available, rather than simply to the closest hospital.

=== Reunion and &quot;Jericho&quot; ===
In 1987 Prism reformed with a revised line-up, and two new Prism tracks were recorded for another greatest hits album called &quot;Over 60 Minutes with...Prism&quot;, released in 1988. One of the new tracks, &quot;Good To Be Back&quot;, was composed by Al Harlow, Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance, produced by Vallance, and in a nod to long-time fans, was mixed by &quot;Rodney Higgs&quot;. The song was performed by new vocalist Darcy Deutsch (vocals), Allen Harlow (guitar and bass), Jim Vallance (drums and keyboards) and Lindsay Mitchell (guitar solo). Paul Janz and Marc LaFrance provided backing vocals. Subsequently, Harlow, Mitchell and Deutsch recruited former member Rocket Norton on drums and new keyboardist Andy Lorimer. This line-up toured live in 1988. Deutsch and Lorimer had previously performed Prism songs in their former band Simon Kaos, where they had been spotted by Prism guitarist Mitchell.

Five years later, this same line-up released the first new Prism album in 10 years, 1993&#x27;s &quot;Jericho&quot;. Guest musicians on the album included Bryan Adams, Paul Janz and Marc LaFrance, with Rick Springfield and Randy Bachman (Bachman–Turner Overdrive) contributing to the songwriting.

=== Present line-up and &quot;Big Black Sky&quot; ===
In 1990 China White singer Rick Shermack, of Edmonton, had done a short tour substituting for Darcy Deutsch as lead vocalist with Prism, which he called not only an honour, but actually rather easy. &quot;We were always playing their songs anyway, now here was my chance to blast out all those Prism hits I&#x27;d been covering for all those years with the guys who wrote them – an absolute blast&quot;.

Rocket Norton left the band in 1994 to work in television and stage production and was replaced by drummer John Cody (who had already subbed for Norton on the road in 1992–1993 and played on the &quot;Jericho&quot; album). But after Cody&#x27;s departure in 1996 and a brief return in 1997 by Norton, Darrell Mayes (from the Colin James Band) took over the drum chair before turning it over to Frank Baker circa 2000. Baker stayed on until he left to join Trooper in 2003. Mayes then briefly returned, but he was replaced almost immediately by Gary Grace.

Keyboardist Richard Sera (formerly with fellow Canadian rockers Trooper) subbed for Andy Lorimer from 1991 to 1992 before Lorimer returned. But Lorimer left Prism again in 1996 and John Counsel was on keys until Andy returned for a final stint in 1999–2002. Steve Soucy then assumed the keyboard chair from 2002 to 2003, when Alfie Galpin took over for a year, followed by Johnny Ferreira (another Colin James player) in 2004.

After singer Darcy Deutsch left Prism in 2003, Harlow assumed the lead singer position; and also assumed lead guitar when Lindsay Mitchell left in early 2005. Mitchell&#x27;s departure left Prism once again with no original members.

The band continued to tour in 2005 with a new line-up of Harlow, drummer Gary Grace (who had joined in 2003), Steve-O (keyboards, guitars, backing vocals) and bassist Michael Kaye (who was soon replaced by Tad Goddard). In 2006 Goddard left and Timothy B. Hewitt (bass, guitars, keyboards, backing vocals) came in for two years.

By 2008, Prism consisted of Harlow, Gary Grace, Steve-O and Timothy B. Hewitt (bass, guitars, keyboards). This line-up released a new studio album called &quot;Big Black Sky&quot; in July 2008. It featured mostly compositions by Harlow, with one track written by long-time ally Jim Vallance. At the end of 2008, Hewitt departed and Tad Goddard returned.

Since 2010, Prism&#x27;s line-up has been Allen Harlow (vocals, guitar, bass), Gary Grace (drums, percussion, backing vocals), Marc Gladstone (keyboards, backing vocals) and Tad Goddard (bass, backing vocals). Gladstone (ex-Doug and the Slugs and a Sweeney Todd reunion) was a cousin to Prism&#x27;s original keyboardist John Hall.

On August 19, 2016, the band was flying to a show in Ottawa when drummer Gary Grace began experiencing increasing chest and leg pains. After that evening&#x27;s show, he was hospitalized immediately with a massive blood clot. Prism played the following night in Halifax at the large outdoor Weir Rockin festival with drummer A.J. Chabidon from Harlequin, one of the other bands on the festival&#x27;s bill. After this, former Prism drummer Frank Baker (currently with fellow Canadian rockers Sweeney Todd) did the honors at the group&#x27;s Deerfoot Calgary show on August 27. One month and five days following the Ottawa incident, Grace returned to the concert stage at Edmonton&#x27;s Century Casino Showroom playing to a sold-out crowd.

=== 2015 reunion concert ===
On May 22, 2015, a &quot;Local Legends of Rock&quot; concert, featuring Ab Bryant, John Hall, Al Harlow and Rocket Norton, was held in Lynn Valley, North Vancouver. At the concert, Harlow said, &quot;Here&#x27;s a disclaimer; This isn&#x27;t the reunion of any one band, but it might be the reunion of 3 or 4 bands.&quot; A review of the concert titled it the &quot;Prism / Jet / Seeds of Time Reunion Concert,&quot; with Sunshyne being an obvious candidate for the fourth band Harlow referred to. The concert included the Prism songs &quot;Young and Restless&quot;, &quot;Nickels and Dimes&quot;, &quot;Take Me to the Kaptin&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Like the Wind&quot; and &quot;Spaceship Superstar.&quot;

=== 2018–present ===
On May 4, 2018, Prism took part in a &quot;White Hat Ceremony&quot; at a concert in Calgary making them official Citizens of Calgary.

On November 23, 2020, former Prism keyboardist Steve Soucy died after a heart attack.

On Valentine&#x27;s Day 2022, Al Harlow released his debut solo album, &quot;Now!&quot;. The album featured a co-write with Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance.

On September 28, 2023, Prism was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame. Allen Harlow, John Hall, Lindsay Mitchell and Rocket Norton were present for the induction ceremony and they also included a framed picture of Ron Tabak.

On October 21, 2023, Lindsay Mitchell, John Hall, Rocket Norton, Allen Harlow, Tad Goddard and Darcy Deutsch performed on stage for the first time ever together as Prism in support of Rocket Norton&#x27;s &quot;F**K Cancer&quot; benefit concert, in aid of Norton&#x27;s struggle with cancer. Other acts, such as Headpins, Chilliwack, Lee Aaron, Trooper, Powder Blues Band, H.U.N.N., Doug and the Slugs and Loverboy, also performed.

Norton (real name Gary Wanstall) died in Vancouver on April 5, 2024, at the age of 73.

== Legacy ==
Although Prism has had only moderate success as a band, their legacy is renowned for some of its former members who went on to have success in the music industry. Prism helped launch the careers of Bruce Fairbairn as an international record producer and Jim Vallance as a music industry wide songwriter. Fairbairn went on to produce successful albums for international artists such as Loverboy, Bon Jovi, Aerosmith, AC/DC, Kiss and Yes. Vallance teamed up with Bryan Adams to become Adams-Vallance, a successful song-writing team. Vallance then continued that success as a music industry &quot;song doctor&quot; for many well known international recording artists.

<doc id="579164" wikidata="Q6555551" url="?curid=579164" title="Lionel Bowen">
<text>Lionel Frost Bowen (28 December 1922 – 1 April 2012) was an Australian politician. He was the deputy leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) from 1977 to 1990 and served as the sixth deputy prime minister of Australia in the Hawke government from 1983 to 1990.

Bowen was born in Sydney to a working-class family. He served in the Australian Army during World War II and subsequently studied law at the University of Sydney. He was elected mayor of Randwick in 1948 and served in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1962 to 1969. Bowen was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1969 federal election, representing the seat of Kingsford Smith. He served as Postmaster-General (1972–1974), Special Minister of State (1973–1975) and Minister for Manufacturing Industry (1975) in the Whitlam government, before being elected deputy leader to Bill Hayden in 1977. He retained the position when Bob Hawke was elected leader in 1983 and became deputy prime minister after Labor won the 1983 election. He served as Minister for Trade (1983–1984) and Attorney-General (1984–1990) until his retirement from politics in 1990, and was later chair of the National Gallery of Australia.

==Early life==
Bowen was born in the Sydney suburb of Ultimo. His father left the family when Bowen was aged 10 years and Bowen&#x27;s mother looked after her invalid brother and elderly mother, while working as a cleaner. Bowen was educated at Cleveland Street public school, Marcellin College Randwick and Sydney University where he graduated with a LLB in 1946 and became a solicitor. He served in the Second Australian Imperial Force from 1941 to 1945, reaching the rank of corporal.

==Political career==
Bowen was elected to Randwick Council and became Mayor in 1948. He served in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1962 to 1969, representing Randwick, before being elected to the Parliament of Australia in 1969, to the seat of Kingsford Smith in the House of Representatives. From 1972 to 1975, he served successively as Minister for Manufacturing Industry, Special Minister of State and Postmaster-General in the Whitlam cabinet.

Bowen played a relatively quiet role in politics, preferring to work behind the scenes. A significant achievement came when he served as acting education minister in the Whitlam government (during the illness and hospitalization of incumbent education minister Kim Beazley Senior), when he managed to split the opposition and win National Party support in the Senate for needs-based funding for non-government schools.

When Whitlam resigned as Labor leader after his defeat at the 1977 election, Bowen contested the party leadership but was defeated by Bill Hayden and became Deputy Leader. He retained this position when Bob Hawke became Leader in February 1983. When Hawke won the March 1983 election, Bowen became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade in the first Hawke Ministry. In July 1983, he was appointed Vice-President of the Executive Council and in the second Hawke ministry, he became Attorney-General, losing the Trade portfolio.

In 1988, Bowen sponsored four referendums to reform the Australian Constitution (see 1988 Australian referendum), but all were defeated. He retired from federal politics prior to the March 1990 election, and was succeeded as Deputy Prime Minister by Paul Keating.

To date Bowen is the last Labor Deputy Prime Minister to have served for at least a full parliamentary term.

==Post political career==
Bowen served as Chairman of the National Gallery of Australia between 1990 and 1995 and shared a strong interest in horseracing.

In 1990, he was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal, and in 1991, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia &quot;in recognition of service to the community and politics.&quot; In 2001, he received a Centenary Medal.

==Personal life==
Bowen and his wife, Claire, married in 1953 and had three daughters and five sons. He lived in the same home in Kensington for 73 years. His son, Tony, was a mayor of the City of Randwick.

Bowen died from pneumonia on 1 April 2012. after years afflicted with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He was given a state funeral on 11 April 2012.

==Legacy==
The Family Court of Australia and the Federal Magistrates Court are located in the Lionel Bowen Building in Goulburn Street, Sydney. The City of Randwick main library is known as the Lionel Bowen Library. Lionel Bowen Park is situated in the suburb of Mascot.

<doc id="579169" wikidata="Q2390270" url="?curid=579169" title="Treasurer of Australia">
<text>The Treasurer of Australia, also known as the Federal Treasurer or more simply the Treasurer, is the minister of state of the Commonwealth of Australia charged with overseeing government revenue collection, federal expenditure and economic policy as the head of the Department of the Treasury. The current treasurer is Jim Chalmers, who was selected by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in May 2022 following the 2022 Australian federal election. 

The Treasurer implements ministerial powers through the Department of the Treasury and a range of other government agencies. According to constitutional convention, the Treasurer is always a member of the Parliament of Australia with a seat in the House of Representatives. The office is generally seen as equivalent to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the United Kingdom or the Secretary of the Treasury in the United States or, in some other countries, the finance minister. It is one of only four ministerial positions (along with prime minister, Minister for Defence and Attorney-General) that have existed since Federation.

==Responsibilities and duties==
The Treasurer is the minister in charge of government revenue and expenditure. The Treasurer oversees economic policy: fiscal policy is within the Treasurer&#x27;s direct responsibility, while monetary policy is implemented by the politically independent Reserve Bank of Australia, the head of which is appointed by the Treasurer. The Treasurer also oversees financial regulation. Each year in May, the Treasurer presents the Federal Budget to the Parliament.

The Prime Minister and Treasurer are traditionally members of the House, but the constitution does not have such a requirement. The tradition is due to the fact that under the constitution, appropriation bills have to originate from the House, and if the Treasurer is a senator, they would not be able to introduce the bills. This would also mean another minister would need to give the nationally televised budget speech and introduce the bills. While no Federal Treasurer has been a member of the Senate, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia had state Treasurers who had served as members of the Legislative Councils, the states&#x27; upper houses.

Unlike the scenario in which a treasurer who is a senator cannot present the budget in the House of Representatives, state treasurers who have been members of upper houses have delivered their budgets in the respective lower houses.

The treasurer is a very senior government post, usually ranking second or third in Cabinet. Historically, many treasurers have previously, concurrently or subsequently served as prime minister or deputy prime minister; two subsequently served as Governor-General. Service as treasurer is seen as an important (though not essential) qualification for serving as prime minister: to date, six treasurers have gone on to be prime minister.

Paul Keating and Wayne Swan are currently the only two to have been named &quot;Euromoney Finance Minister of the Year&quot; by &quot;Euromoney&quot; magazine.

Since 1958, Treasurers in Coalition governments have often but not always been the deputy leader of the Liberal Party. In contrast, only four Labor Treasurers have also been the deputy leader of the Labor Party.

==Related ministerial positions==
Along with the Treasurer, other ministers have responsibility for the Department of the Treasury. The Treasurer together with these other ministers are known as the &quot;Treasury Ministers&quot;. At present, the Treasury Minister positions are:
* Treasurer
* Assistant Treasurer
* Minister for Financial Services
* Minister for Small Business

The work of the Department of Finance is closely related to the work of the Department of the Treasury, with the former responsible for budget formation and operational management of government finances. The ministers who have responsibility for the Department of Finance are:
* Minister for Finance
* Special Minister of State

==Treasury portfolio==
Eleven organizations nominally fall under the auspices of the Australian Treasurer. They entail the provision of policy advice to portfolio ministers; effective government spending and taxation arrangements; and well-functioning markets.

* The Department of the Treasury creates policies and reports for four output groups. These groups are macroeconomic, fiscal, revenue and markets:
** Macroeconomic reports include: domestic economic policy advice and forecasting and international economic policy advice and assessment.
** Fiscal reports include: budget policy advice and coordination; Commonwealth-State financial policy advice; and industry, environment and social policy advice.
** Revenue reports include: taxation and income support policy advice.
** Markets reports include: foreign investment policy advice and administration; financial corporate governance policy advice; competition and consumer policy advice; and actuarial services. In addition, the Royal Australian Mint is responsible for producing Australia&#x27;s circulating currency.

* The Australian Bureau of Statistics is Australia&#x27;s official statistical agency. Its reports are created for decision-making, research and discussion within governments and the community. It principally relates to the production of economic, population and social statistics.
* The Australian Office of Financial Management manages the Commonwealth&#x27;s net debt portfolio. Its reports on debt management directed at ensuring that the Commonwealth net debt portfolio is managed, subject to the government&#x27;s policies and risk references.
* The National Competition Council is an independent advisory body for all Australian governments involved in implementing the National Competition Policy. Outputs include: advice provided to governments on competition policy and infrastructure access issues and accessible public information on competition policy.
* The Productivity Commission is an advisory body on microeconomics policy that contributes to public understanding.
* The Australian Taxation Office outputs are directed at systems that support and fund services for Australians and give effect to social and economic policy through the tax, superannuation, excise and other related systems. Outputs include: design and build administrative systems; management of revenue collection and transfers; compliance assurance; and regulation of superannuation funds compliance with retirement income standards. The Inspector-General of Taxation is an independent statutory office to review systemic tax administration issues and to report to the Government with recommendations for improving tax administration for the benefit of taxpayers.
* The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is a regulation agency mandated for consumer rights by industry regulation and price monitoring.
* The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority is the financial supervisor responsible for prudentially regulating the banking, other deposit-taking, insurance and superannuation industries.
* The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) is the independent government body that enforces and administers the Corporations Law and Consumer Protection Law for investments, life and general insurance, and superannuation and banking (except lending). Outputs include: policy, enforcement and guidance about ASIC-administered laws; information on companies and corporate activity; and monitoring and licensing of participants.
* The Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee (CAMAC) creates reports directed at participation of investors and consumers. It makes recommendations to the responsible Minister on the Corporations Law, and produces and publishes an annual report along with other discussion papers and reports.

<doc id="579177" wikidata="Q3655986" url="?curid=579177" title="Late harvest wine">
<text>Late harvest wine is wine made from grapes left on the vine longer than usual. &quot;Late harvest&quot; is usually an indication of a sweet dessert wine, such as late harvest Riesling. Late harvest grapes are often more similar to raisins, but have been naturally dehydrated while on the vine.

Botrytis cinerea, or &quot;noble rot&quot;, is a mold that causes grapes to lose nearly all of their water content. Wines made from botrytis-affected grapes are generally very sweet.

== Noble rot ==
Botrytis cinerea is a fungus that affects many wine grapes and causes them to shrivel into moldy raisins. The fungus responds to the humidity and warmth in the climate and attacks the grapes. As the mold penetrates the skin its spores begin to germinate, causing the water inside to evaporate and the grape to dehydrate. With the absence of water, the sugar becomes more concentrated and the botrytis begins to alter the acidity within the grape. Typically botrytis infection begins to take place in late September and can last till late October. In some years desiccation may occur leaving tiny amount of sweet liquor like juice within the grape.

The infection rate of botrytis is sporadic with vines and bunches achieving full rottenness at different times. This requires harvest workers to go through the vineyards several times between October and November to hand-pick the full rotted grapes. In some occasions, the usable grapes from a single vine may only produce enough juice for a single glass.

=== Sauternes ===

Sauternes, such as Château d&#x27;Yquem, are produced in the Sauternes region (including Barsac) south of Bordeaux. They are made from botrytis infected Semillon and Sauvignon blanc grapes. Semillon is preferred due to the grape&#x27;s thin skin and susceptibility to the botrytis which gives the grape a high sugar content. These wines are noted for the balance that complements the honeyed sweetness.

During fermentation, the juice is transferred into oak wine barrels where the high sugar concentration of must prolongs the fermentation time which can last up to a year. When the alcohol level kills off all present yeast, the fermentation stops leaving the residual sugar at levels between 8 and 12% and alcohol levels around 14%.

After fermentation, the wine is placed in an aging barrel for two to three years before it is bottled where it will continue aging. A Sauterne from a reputable estate can bottle age for over 30 years though they normally hit their peak 10 years after the vintage date.

=== Tokaji/Tokaj/Tokajské ===
Tokaji wines are produced in the Tokaj regions of Hungary and Slovakia. Wine has been made in these regions since as early as 1650, before the botrytized wines of Sauternes and the Rheingau were produced. The Furmint, Yellow Muscat, and Hárslevelű/Lipovina grapes are the primary grapes used in this wine. In a manner similar to Sherry, the wine is aged in partially filled barrels with a film of yeast on top and stored underground in wine caverns.

== German late harvest wines ==

In Germany, wines are classified according to the ripeness of the grape at time of harvest. Within the Qualitätswein mit Prädikat classification, there are four levels of late harvest wines, roughly ranging from dry to very sweet: Spätlese (&quot;late harvest&quot;), Auslese (&quot;selected harvest&quot;), Beerenauslese (&quot;selected berries harvest&quot;) and Trockenbeerenauslese (&quot;selected dried-berries harvest&quot;) with the last two levels being botrytized.

== Icewine ==
Ice wines are popular in the cold northernly wine regions of Germany and Canada where the grapes can freeze on the vine. As the grapes are pressed, the frozen water crystals are eliminated leaving the highly concentrated sugar behind.

== Raisin wine ==

Raisin wines are sometimes made from grapes that have been left on the vine in the sun to concentrate their sugar. The result is similar to that of the ice wine process, but is a much older process and suitable for warm climates.

<text>Kurt Harland is an American singer, songwriter, and audio engineer. He is the lead singer of Information Society. He also works on video game scores, including two of the soundtracks for the &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; video game series (&quot;Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&quot; and &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot; in collaboration with Jim Hedges).
== Personal life ==
Kurt Harland Larson was born on January 25, 1963 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He lived in Minneapolis until he was 5, when he moved to New Brighton.

Kurt began learning piano at age 6 and took lessons on and off until age 19. He began singing in the school choirs and theater productions in 8th grade, which he continued through college. Between the ages of 14 and 19, he experimented with painting.

At age 18 he moved back into the city to attend college, in Saint Paul. From 1982 to 1988, he lived in South Minneapolis, except for a 6-month stay in Vienna, Austria.

He graduated from Irondale High School in 1981, and attended Macalester College in Saint Paul for a year before attending the University of Minnesota in 1982.

Kurt has stated he started performing and making music with Information Society at age 19 in 1982.

In 1988, he moved to New York City for 5 years before settling in San Francisco in 1993.

==Career==

===Information Society===

In early concerts and albums, Harland was credited under the pseudonym &quot;Kurt Valaquen&quot;, Valaquen taken from Tolkien, meaning child of light. After the band had achieved mainstream success, he began using his own middle name as his professional last name.

=== 1982–1990 ===
Formed in 1982, synthpop band Information Society achieved mainstream success for a time in the late eighties and early nineties. They are most widely known for their 1988 hit single &quot;What&#x27;s on Your Mind (Pure Energy)&quot;. The band&#x27;s last major (top 40) charting release was &quot;Think&quot; in 1990, from the album &quot;Hack&quot;.

=== 1990–1997 ===
After the moderate success of Hack, the band released &quot;Peace and Love, Inc.&quot; in 1992. The album did not achieve much commercial success and failed to chart to a notable degree. MTV were reportedly opposed to playing the music video of the title track on its channel.

After Information Society broke up, Harland kept the rights to the name of the band and worked with Steven Seibold of &quot;Hate Dept.&quot;. The resulting album titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid&quot;, was released in 1997. The album resulted in a more industrial influenced sound, purportedly fulfilling the wishes of Harland in pursuing a darker approach that he had previously hoped to explore.

=== 1997–present ===
A 2004 episode of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Bands Reunited&quot;, caused a brief controversy when Harland refused to appear in an Information Society reunion performance, despite apparently accepting the invitation on-camera by signing a copy of their first album. In an account of the incident written by Harland and available on his website, Harland disputes VH1&#x27;s depiction of the events and his portrayal on the show, claiming that the show was edited to make it look as if he had accepted the invitation and then backed out of it.

In 2006, he turned the name back over to Paul Robb and James Cassidy, who reformed the band with a new singer. Harland cited family obligations and a demanding career in not returning full-time; he has since been involved nonetheless, performing at a few concerts, and is featured as a vocalist on their 2007 album &quot;Synthesizer&quot;. He later rejoined the band full-time, singing and writing for subsequent releases. These additional albums were &quot;Hello World&quot; in 2014 and &quot;Orders of Magnitude&quot; in 2016.

===Video games===
After 11 years as a full-time recording artist, Harland moved to San Francisco and began his career in video game audio engineering. Over the years he has been involved with eighteen different projects, notably six years with Crystal Dynamics and a stint at Electronic Arts.

Harland has worked on the following:

* 1995: &quot;Scooby-Doo Mystery&quot; — Sunsoft, Mega Drive
* 1995: &quot;X-Men 2: Clone Wars&quot; — Headgames / Sega, Mega Drive
* 1995: &quot;Ballz&quot; — PF.Magic, 3DO
* 1995: &quot;Nightmare Circus&quot; — Funcom Oslo / Sega, Mega Drive
* 1997: &quot;&quot; — Crystal Dynamics, PlayStation
* 1999: &quot;Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&quot; — Crystal Dynamics, PlayStation / Dreamcast / Windows
* 2001: &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot; — Crystal Dynamics, Windows / PlayStation 2
* 2003: &quot;Whiplash&quot; — Crystal Dynamics, PlayStation 2 / Xbox
* 2003: &quot;Legacy of Kain: Defiance&quot; — Crystal Dynamics, Windows / PlayStation 2 / Xbox
* 2005: &quot;The Godfather&quot; — Electronic Arts, PlayStation 2 / Xbox / PC
* 2005: &quot;Death Jr.&quot; – Backbone Entertainment, PSP
* 2006: &quot;Death Jr. II: Root of Evil&quot; – Backbone Entertainment, PSP
* 2007: &quot;Death Jr. and the Science Fair of Doom&quot; – Backbone Entertainment, Nintendo DS
* 2011: &quot;PlayStation Move Heroes&quot; – Nihilistic Software Inc., PlayStation 3 with PlayStation Move
* 2012: &quot;&quot; – Nihilistic Software Inc., PlayStation Vita

Four songs from Information Society&#x27;s album &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid&quot; were also used in video games that had their soundtracks composed by Kurt Harland:
* Early versions of &quot;Closing In&quot; and &quot;On the Outside&quot; had been used in the 3DO version of &quot;Ballz&quot;.
* The instrumental track &quot;Ozar Midrashim&quot; would later be used as the intro theme of &quot;Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&quot;.

<doc id="579183" wikidata="Q2915839" url="?curid=579183" title="Soccer in Canada">
<text>In Canada, soccer is the most popular sport in terms of participation rate; according to Canada Soccer, there are nearly 1 million registered players in Canada. Professional soccer in Canada is played in the Canadian Premier League and Major League Soccer. Canada also has many semi-professional and amateur soccer leagues. Canada&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s national soccer teams are ranked 31st and 6th respectively in the FIFA World Rankings as of November 28, 2024.

==Terminology==
Soccer is played in Canada according to the rules of association football. What is called soccer in Canada today was generally known as football in Canada in the early days of the sport as it is known in much of the rest of the world today.

The British Columbia Football Association was the first provincial football association formed in Canada in 1891. This was followed by the Manitoba Football Association in 1896, the Ontario Football Association in 1901, the Saskatchewan Football Association in 1906, the Alberta Football Association in 1909 and the Province of Quebec Football Association in 1911.

The Dominion of Canada Football Association was formed in 1912. The game&#x27;s governing body retained that name until it was changed to The Football Association of Canada on June 6, 1952. The Association later changed its name to the Canadian Soccer Football Association in 1958 and then to the Canadian Soccer Association in 1971.

==History==
===Early history===

One of the earliest soccer games was played in Toronto in 1859 between the St. George&#x27;s Society and a team of Irishmen. Games were played in New Westminster in 1862 and in Victoria in 1865. The first game played under modern rules took place in Toronto in 1876, after which the Dominion Football Association, the first recorded football association outside the British Isles, was formed in Toronto in 1877 to foster competition between local sides.

In 1880, the Western Football Association was formed in Berlin (now Kitchener), Ontario and played a major role in the subsequent development of the sport throughout southern Ontario. In the time around 1900, the WFA had teams throughout Western Ontario in various municipalities including Seaforth, Mildmay, Listowel, Woodstock, Ingersoll, Brussels, Dundas, Aylmer, Ayr, Tavistock, Preston, Galt and Berlin.

In 1885 and 1886, the Western Football Association sent teams to New Jersey to play both indoor and outdoor matches against teams representing the American Football Association, then the unofficial governing body of soccer in the United States. In the first unofficial international between the two countries in 1885 Canada defeated the United States 1–0 in East Newark, New Jersey. A year later the American side won 3–2 on the same field. Teams from the two organizations played one another on both sides of the border regularly in the years that followed.

In 1896, the Newfoundland Football League was founded on March 15 in St. John&#x27;s. The Manitoba Football Association was formed that same year on March 19 in Brandon.
In 1901 the Ontario Football Association was formed in Toronto and competition for the Ontario Cup began. Galt F.C. won the first edition of the tournament that is still running. They represented the WFA at the 1904 Olympic Games in St. Louis, Missouri, winning the gold medal. Only two other teams participated, both American clubs.

In 1905, the Saskatchewan Football Association was formed in the province of Saskatchewan, and by 1911 the Province of Quebec Football Association was formed in Montreal with Frank Calder, first president of the National Hockey League, playing a leading role in the PQFA&#x27;s formation. The Alberta Football Association was incorporated in the same year.

The first ever professional game was played in Vancouver between the Callies and Rovers in 1910. The &quot;Dominion of Canada Football Association&quot;, today known as the &quot;Canadian Soccer Association was founded in Winnipeg, Manitoba in July 1912. &quot;At the meeting, the Manitoba Football Association joined with the provincial associations of Ontario, New Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan and Alberta to form the national association.&quot; The organization became a member of FIFA December 31, 1912. In 1926, the National Soccer League was formed with teams in Ontario and Quebec. On June 21, 1926, the DCFA resigned from FIFA and remained outside the world governing body, following the example of British associations in a dispute over broken time payments to amateurs. Hamilton&#x27;s Whitey McDonald was signed by Scottish club Rangers in the 1920s, who spotted him while on tour in North America.
The Great Depression of the 1930s meant that the DCFA struggled financially and could not afford to hold annual meetings in 1932 and 1933 and from 1935 to 1940. In those years, business was conducted by mail. At one point, president Len Peto of Montreal loaned the DFA a considerable sum of money to stave off bankruptcy. The money was later repaid in full. Despite the hard times, Montreal-born goalkeeper Joe Kennaway signed for Scottish giants Glasgow Celtic in 1931 and was an immediate success. Toronto Scottish won a North American club championship in 1933 by beating holders and U.S. champions Stix, Baer and Fuller F.C. at Chicago&#x27;s Soldier Field by a score of 2–1.

===1945–1979===
In July 1946, the Dominion of Canada Football Association held reorganizational meetings in Winnipeg, Manitoba. On July 24, 1948, the Association again became a member of FIFA. On June 6, 1952, the Association officially changed its name to the Football Association of Canada. In 1958, the Association again changed its name, this time to the Canadian Soccer Football Association. It would change its name one more time in 1971, at that time becoming the Canadian Soccer Association.

In 1957, Canada entered qualifying for the FIFA World Cup for the first time and met the United States and Mexico in qualifying for the finals in Sweden in 1958. Canada won its first World Cup qualifying game 5–1 against the U.S. in Toronto, but played Mexico twice in Mexico City and lost 2–0 and 3–0. In the final group game, Canada beat the U.S. 3–2 in St. Louis, but group winners Mexico advanced to the Finals.

From the 1940s through 1960s, Canada&#x27;s four major leagues were the Pacific Coast League (re-established in 1939–40), the National League of Ontario/Quebec (re-established in 1947), the Eastern Canada Professional League (established in 1961), and the Western Canada League (established in 1963). Canadian teams also played in the American-based North American Soccer Football League in the late 1940s. The Western Canada League was the first-ever league to feature teams across three and then four provinces, although the league folded in 1971.

During the 1960s there was a concerted effort to push professional soccer in Canada. The Eastern Canada Professional Soccer League was formed in 1961 and featured teams in Toronto, Montreal, Hamilton, and (for one season) Buffalo, New York. One club, Toronto City, even featured some very prominent British soccer stars during its inaugural season, including Northern Ireland international Danny Blanchflower, England internationals Stanley Matthews and Johnny Haynes and Scottish internationals Jackie Mudie and Tommy Younger. This is also notable as the last time that the England, Scotland and Northern Ireland captains all played on the same side together.

Following a rise in the popularity of the game after the global broadcasting of the 1966 World Cup, the North American Soccer League was formed in 1968. The league primarily based in the United States also had clubs in Canada and used many European professionals brought in to supplement domestic talent. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Canada was represented by professional teams playing in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver with short-lived teams in Calgary and Edmonton. The NASL had a stormy relationship with FIFA and the USSF and their clubs did not compete in the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup.

The Olympic Summer Games were held in Montreal in 1976, but the soccer tournament featured only 13 teams instead of the normal 16 after the African nations boycotted the games in protest against South Africa&#x27;s apartheid policies. Canada opened against the Soviet Union in the Olympic Stadium, losing 2–1. Canada lost its second game in Toronto against North Korea and was eliminated from the tournament. The same year, Toronto Metros-Croatia won the Soccer Bowl, the North American Soccer League championship. The final was held in Seattle, where the Toronto side defeated Minnesota 3–0 with a squad featuring Eusébio, striker Ivan Lukačević, Canadian defender Robert Iarusci and goaltender Željko Bilecki. Vancouver Whitecaps won the 1979 Soccer Bowl, beating Tampa Bay Rowdies 2–1 in the final at Giants Stadium in New Jersey.

===1980–1999===
In 1983, Toronto Blizzard reached the final at B.C. Place Stadium in Vancouver but lost 2–0 to the Tulsa Roughnecks. Also in 1983 the Canadian Professional Soccer League played one shortened season after two years of aborted attempts to find enough clubs to play. Canada also lost the bid to host the 1986 World Cup in 1983 when Mexico was awarded the World Cup. Toronto Blizzard returned to the NASL Finals in 1984, but in losing to the Chicago Sting, came up short for the second consecutive year. The league folded prior to the 1985 season. Despite these misfortunes, Canada qualified for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics soccer tournament played throughout the United States. In the first round, they drew with Iraq, lost to Yugoslavia and beat Cameroon to qualify for the quarter finals. After taking an early lead against Brazil, Canada were defeated on penalty kicks.

The 1985 CONCACAF Championship was the fourth edition that doubled as qualification for the FIFA World Cup. Continuing in its good phase, Canada secured qualification for the 1986 World Cup after beating Honduras 2–1 in St John&#x27;s, Newfoundland on September 14, 1985 at King George V Park in front of over 13,000 people. Canada had bid to host the final tournament, but their application was rejected in favour of Mexico, who qualified automatically as hosts, with Canada earning the remaining CONCACAF spot and winning the CONCACAF Championship (now the Gold Cup) for the first time. At the World Cup, Canada were drawn in Group C and lost 1–0 to France and 2–0 to both Hungary and the Soviet Union.

Also in 1986, four Canadian national team players were guilty of taking bribes in a match-fixing scandal at the Merlion Cup in Singapore. The Canadian Soccer Association suspended Chris Cheuden, Hector Marinaro, David Norman and Igor Vrablic for one year each. Marinaro and Norman were reinstated and resumed play for Canada. In the wake of Canada&#x27;s World Cup appearance, the Canadian Soccer League began operations in 1987 with teams in eight Canadian cities. In 1989 the Canadian Soccer Referees&#x27; Association was founded.

The Vancouver 86ers of the CSL won the 1990 North American Club Championship, beating Maryland Bays 3–2 in the final in Burnaby, British Columbia. The same year, Canada&#x27;s national side took part in the North American Nations Cup, hosting the three-team tournament. Canada won the tournament after a 1–0 win over the United States on May 6 and a 2–1 win over Mexico on May 13, all three goals scored by John Catliff, the tournament&#x27;s top scorer. In 1991, Canada took part in the championship for the second time as defending champions. Mexico won the 1991 North American Nations Cup with Canada finishing in third place.

After the 1992 season, the CSL was forced to end operations with Vancouver 86ers and Montreal Impact joining the United States&#x27; APSL. In January 1993, the Toronto Blizzard also joined the APSL. The Winnipeg Fury, not meeting USSF Division 1 market size standards, and North York Rockets joined the National Soccer League, which changed its name to the Canadian National Soccer League in 1993.

The Canadian women&#x27;s national team benefited from a surge in youth participation throughout the 1980s, and in 1995 Canada qualified for the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup for the first time. Canada lost to England and Norway and drew with Nigeria at the tournament played in Sweden. Canada again qualified for FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup 1999 played in the United States, again going winless after drawing with Japan and losing to Norway and Russia.

===2000–present===

In 2000, Canada&#x27;s men&#x27;s team won the CONCACAF Gold Cup for the first time. Canada had finished in a tie in group play with South Korea, but won the tie-breaking coin toss to advance to the quarter-final, where they beat Mexico 2–1 on an extra-time golden goal. In the semi-final, Canada beat Trinidad and Tobago 1–0, and beat invited side Colombia 2–0 in the final. As a result of being named CONCACAF champions, Canada travelled to the 2001 Confederations Cup in Japan, earning a memorable 0–0 draw with Brazil thanks to a stellar performance from Gold Cup Most Valuable Player, goalkeeper Craig Forrest.

At the next Gold Cup in 2002, Canada reached the semi-final for the second time but lost to the United States, on penalty kicks, who would go on to win the tournament. Despite their success in the Gold Cup, Canada&#x27;s senior men&#x27;s side failed to qualify for either the 2002 or 2006 World Cup.

Also in 2002, Canada hosted the first ever FIFA U-19 Women&#x27;s World Championship with games in Edmonton, Victoria, and Vancouver. The final between Canada and the United States was played at Edmonton&#x27;s Commonwealth Stadium, with the U.S. winning on a golden goal. Canadian Christine Sinclair received the tournament&#x27;s Golden Ball as MVP and Golden Boot as leading goal-scorer. Rounding out 2002, Canada&#x27;s senior women&#x27;s team, with several players from the U-19 squad, met the United States in the 2002 CONCACAF Women&#x27;s Gold Cup final, where the U.S. won on yet another golden goal. Still later that year, Sinclair led the U.S. NCAA Division I in goals scored as she helped the University of Portland win the national championship.

The senior women&#x27;s side again qualified for the 2003 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. In the group stages they lost to Germany before beating Japan and Argentina for their first wins in World Cup history (men or women). In the quarter-finals, Canada upset China 1–0 before losing to Sweden in the semifinal. They were again beat by old rivals the U.S. in the 3rd place game. The under-19 women&#x27;s side qualified for the 2004 world championship in Thailand, losing in the quarterfinals to China. For the second straight tournament, a Canadian won the Golden Boot, with Brittany Timko the top-scorer. Sinclair set an NCAA Division I record in 2005 with 39 goals as she led Portland to another NCAA title and earned a second straight Hermann Trophy. In the wake of her record-setting season at Portland, Sinclair won the Honda-Broderick Cup in 2006 as the outstanding female athlete at a U.S. university. Also in 2006, long-serving CSA Chief Operating Officer Kevan Pipe was fired from his duties. The CPSL re-branded as the Canadian Soccer League.

In 2007, Toronto FC began play in Major League Soccer as its first franchise located outside the United States. Canada&#x27;s national team reached the semi-final at the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup, losing again to the U.S. who would again win the tournament as in 2002. Dale Mitchell was named coach of Canada&#x27;s senior men&#x27;s team, to begin duties after the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup, held in Canada. The host went out without scoring a goal and losing all three matches. The final was held in front of 20,000 people at BMO Field in Toronto, with Argentina beating the Czech Republic 2–1.

In May 2008, the CSA inaugurated the Canadian Championship – a domestic cup competition open to professional clubs in Canada. The Montreal Impact won the inaugural season and qualified for the 2008–09 CONCACAF Champions League season.

In women&#x27;s soccer, Canada qualified for the Women&#x27;s Olympic Football Tournament for the first time. The team came within an extra-time goal of knocking off number-one ranked U.S. in the quarter-final. At the youth level, Canada won its second CONCACAF Women&#x27;s U-20 Championship. In March 2011, it was announced Canada would host the 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup for the first time, where they reached the quarterfinals.

On January 31, 2013, the Canadian Soccer Association announced they were withdrawing sanctioning of the Canadian Soccer League (CSL) as a division 3 league following the 2013 season as the CSA board of directors adopted a new soccer structure in Canada based on the Easton Report. Prior to being de-sanctioned, the CSL had been involved in a match-fixing scandal and a majority of the teams reportedly did not meet CSA requirements in the 2012 season. The league was founded in 1998 after a merger between the Canadian National Soccer League with the stillborn Ontario Professional Soccer League and previously featured academy clubs of Toronto FC and Montreal Impact. The CSL continued to play following the creation of their own soccer federation in 2014 which was unsanctioned by FIFA.

On May 6, 2017, the creation the Canadian Premier League was unanimously approved and sanctioned by the Canadian Soccer Association as a division 1 league. On December 9, 2017, Toronto FC became the first MLS team to complete a domestic treble with their 2–0 win over the Seattle Sounders FC in the MLS Cup, as well as the first Canadian team to win the MLS Cup. 
On June 13, 2018, Canada, Mexico and United States joint bid was chosen to co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup 69 votes ahead of Morocco 134–65 at the FIFA Congress in Moscow. Canada will host 10 matches in Vancouver and Toronto. The first match of the inaugural season of the Canadian Premier League took place between Forge FC and York9 FC at Tim Hortons Field on April 27, 2019, and resulted in a 1–1 draw.

On August 6, 2021, the women&#x27;s side won their first Olympic gold medal, at the 2020 Summer Olympics.

On March 27, 2022, the men&#x27;s side defeated Jamaica 4–0 on Matchday 13 to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. This ended a 36-year drought since the first time Canada played in the FIFA World Cup, in 1986. In the tournament, as part of Group F, Canada suffered three defeats again, being 1–0 for Belgium, 4–1 for Croatia (in which he scored his first goal in the tournament&#x27;s history, with Alphonso Davies) and 2–1 for Morocco.

Canada will co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup, along with neighbours the United States and Mexico.

==Popularity==
As in other English-speaking nations outside the United Kingdom, association football (soccer) has been traditionally overshadowed by a rival code of the game with explicitly local roots. As in Australia, where Australian rules football took hold; and Ireland, where Gaelic football is played; while in New Zealand, rugby holds greater popularity; Canadian football usurped association football. In 1869, the founding of Hamilton Football Club, who played what would become Canadian football, helped make that sport the dominant football code in Canada by the dawn of the twentieth century.

Despite the difference in popularity of their respective professional leagues, soccer overtook ice hockey in the 1980s and 1990s as the sport with the most registered players in the country. In 2008, there were 873,032 soccer players, compared to 584,679 registered hockey players in Canada in 2008–09.

==Leagues==

The following is a list of fully professional teams in Canada:

===Canadian Premier League===
The Canadian Premier League (CPL) is the highest level of professional soccer in Canada. The tier 1 soccer league began play in 2019 and includes eight Canadian teams, including Atlético Ottawa (Ottawa, Ontario), Cavalry FC (Foothills County, Alberta), Forge FC (Hamilton, Ontario), HFX Wanderers (Halifax, Nova Scotia), Pacific FC (Langford, British Columbia), Valour FC (Winnipeg, Manitoba), Vancouver FC (Langley, British Columbia), and York United FC (Toronto, Ontario). The CPL has announced conditional expansion clubs to Saskatoon and Windsor. The stated goal of the league is to develop Canadian soccer talent, and as such will have a minimum number of Canadian players on each roster and an annual draft of U Sports players.

===Major League Soccer===
Major League Soccer (MLS) is the highest level of professional soccer in the United States. There are three MLS teams located in Canada. Toronto FC became the first Canadian club in 2007. An MLS franchise was awarded to Vancouver in 2009 and began play in the 2011 season. An MLS franchise was awarded to Montreal in 2010 and began play in the 2012 season. Both the Vancouver and Montreal clubs were long-time organizations that had played in USSF-sanctioned Division 2 leagues — North American Soccer League and the USL Championship.

===MLS Next Pro===
In 2022, Toronto FC II and Whitecaps FC 2 began play in MLS Next Pro, a United States Soccer Federation-sanctioned division 3 league and the reserve league of MLS. Toronto FC II had played in the division 2 USL Championship until 2018 and in the division 3 USL League One from 2019 to 2021.

=== League1 Canada ===
Semi-professional leagues have been operated by provincial soccer associations since 2012 and have been designated as pro-am by the Canadian Soccer Association. Currently four such leagues exist: Ligue1 Québec, League1 Ontario, League1 British Columbia, and League1 Alberta — all operating men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s competitions. The champions of the four men&#x27;s leagues are given berths into the Canadian Championship. Starting in 2022, the champions of the three women&#x27;s leagues, along with a second team from the host league, compete at a single location in an interprovincial championship. In 2022, League1 Canada was launched as an alliance for Ligue1 Québec, League1 Ontario and League1 British Columbia to unify and elevate the sport of soccer at the pro-am level through sharing of resources, best practices, and coordination of national commercial partnerships.

===USL League Two===
USL League Two is a U.S.-based, men&#x27;s amateur league. For the 2024 season, Thunder Bay Chill, based in Thunder Bay, Ontario, is the only Canadian team in the league. Four Canadian teams have previously won the league championship:
* 2008 – Thunder Bay Chill
* 2012 – Forest City London, who have since moved to League1 Ontario
* 2015 – K–W United FC, now defunct
* 2018 – Calgary Foothills FC, who have moved to League1 Alberta in 2023

===Northern Super League===
The Northern Super League is a fully Canadian women&#x27;s pro league. Halifax Tides FC, Montreal Roses FC, AFC Toronto, Calgary Wild FC, Ottawa Rapid FC, and Vancouver Rise FC are the teams in the league.

===United Women&#x27;s Soccer===
United Women&#x27;s Soccer is a U.S.-based, women&#x27;s pro-am league. Calgary Foothills WFC is the only Canadian team in the league.

===Canadian soccer cup competitions===
* Canadian Championship (fully pro teams from Canadian Premier League and Major League Soccer and league champions from League1 Ontario, League1 British Columbia, and Ligue1 Québec.)
* Challenge Trophy (amateur men&#x27;s nationals)
* Jubilee Trophy (amateur women&#x27;s nationals)

Many of the provincially sanctioned amateur leagues have league cup competitions. Some such as the ones in British Columbia have significant history.
*Vancouver Island Soccer League – Sir John Jackson Cup first contested 1914
*Fraser Valley Soccer League – Packenham Cup first contested 1909
*Vancouver Metro Soccer League – Imperial Cup first contested 1913
*British Columbia Provincial Soccer Championship – Province Cup (formerly McBride Shield and BCFA Challenge Cup) first contested 1892
*Pacific Coast Soccer League – Cambridge Cup
*Pacific Coast Soccer League – John F. Kennedy Cup (between top amateur teams in BC, Washington State, and Oregon)

==National teams==

The men&#x27;s national soccer team have appeared in three senior FIFA tournaments: the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup in Japan and the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. The women&#x27;s senior national team have appeared in ten senior FIFA tournaments: seven FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cups and three Women&#x27;s Olympic Soccer Tournaments.

A Québec official soccer team has represented Quebec and French Canadians in non-FIFA tournaments.

==Stadiums==
Many Canadian football stadiums and multi-use stadiums are utilized for soccer.

With the growth of Major League Soccer, the Canadian Premier League and the three Tier 3 provincially-based soccer leagues, Canada has a number of soccer-specific stadiums.

<text>A chief technology officer (CTO) (also known as a chief technical officer or chief technologist) is an officer tasked with managing technical operations of an organization. They oversee and supervise research and development and serve as a technical advisor to a higher executive such as a chief executive officer.

A CTO is very similar to a chief information officer (CIO). CTOs will make decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization&#x27;s goals, while CIOs work alongside the organization&#x27;s information technology (&quot;IT&quot;) staff members to perform everyday operations. The attributes of the roles a CTO holds vary from one company to another, mainly depending on their organizational structure. 

== History ==
After World War II, large corporations established research laboratories at locations separate from their headquarters. The corporation&#x27;s goals were to hire scientists and offer them facilities to conduct research on behalf of the company without the burdens of day-to-day office work. This is where the idea of a CTO focusing on the overarching technology infrastructures originates. 

At that time, the director of the laboratory was a corporate vice president who did not participate in the company&#x27;s corporate decisions. Instead, the technical director was the individual responsible for attracting new scientists, to do research, and to develop products. 

In the 1980s, the role of these research directors changed substantially. Since technology was becoming a fundamental part of the development for most products and services, companies needed an operational executive who could understand the product&#x27;s technical side and provide advice on ways to improve and develop.

This all led to the creation of the position of Chief Technology Officer by large companies in the late 1980s with the growth of the information technology industry and computer (internet) companies.

== Overview ==

A CTO &quot;examines the short and long term needs of an organization, and utilizes capital to make investments designed to help the organization reach its objectives... [the CTO] is the highest technology executive position within a company and leads the technology or engineering department&quot;. The role became prominent with the ascent of the IT industry, but has since become prevalent in technology-based industries of all types – including computer-based technologies (such as game developer, e-commerce, and social networking service) and other/non-computer-focused technology (such as biotech/pharma, defense, and automotive). In non-technical organizations as a corporate officer position, the CTO typically reports directly to the chief information officer (CIO) and is primarily concerned with long-term and &quot;big picture&quot; issues (while still having deep technical knowledge of the relevant field). In technology-focused organizations, the CIO and CTO positions can be at the same level, with the CIO focused on the information technology and the CTO focused on the core company and other supporting technologies.

Depending on company structure and hierarchy, there may also be positions such as R&amp;D manager, director of R&amp;D and vice president of engineering whom the CTO interacts with or oversees. The CTO also needs a working familiarity with regulatory (e.g. U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, Consumer Product Safety Commission, as applicable) and intellectual property (IP) issues (e.g. patents, trade secrets, license contracts), and an ability to interface with legal counsel to incorporate these considerations into strategic planning and inter-company negotiations.

In many older industries (whose existence may predate IT automation) such as manufacturing, shipping or banking, an executive role of the CTO would often arise out of the process of automating existing activities; in these cases, any CTO-like role would only emerge if and when efforts would be made to develop truly novel technologies (either for facilitating internal operations or for enhancing products/services being provided), perhaps through &quot;intrapreneuring&quot;.

<doc id="579197" wikidata="Q837482" url="?curid=579197" title="Shoukichi Kina">
<text>, is a Japanese rock musician and politician. He, along with his band Champloose, played a large role in the Okinawan home-grown &quot;folk rock&quot; scene in the 1970s and 1980s. His first big hit was &quot;Haisai Ojisan&quot; (&quot;Hey, old man&quot;) in 1972, which he wrote when he was in high school. A Song from the 1980 album Blood Lines, &quot;Hana&quot; also named &quot;Subete no Hito no Kokoro ni Hana o&quot;, is frequently heard in international markets.

He was elected a member of the House of Councillors in July 2004. In 2010 he ran for a second term but lost.

== Music career with Champloose ==

 is a Japanese band from Okinawa blending traditional Okinawan music with a strong Western rock influence. Their name is apparently derived from the word for a traditional Okinawan stir-fry, chanpuru. Singer and lead songwriter Shoukichi Kina&#x27;s electric sanshin was a particularly distinctive part of their sound. First major single was the classic &quot;Haisai Ojisan&quot; (Hey, old man), written while Kina was still in high school but not a hit until a few years later, in 1972. Later, Champloose&#x27;s version of the Okinawan folk song &quot;Jin Jin&quot; (Firefly) was a minor hit in British discos, and their ballad &quot;Hana&quot; (Flowers), with vocals by Kina&#x27;s wife Tomoko, became a weepy favourite in many Asian countries.

Their first, self-titled album, released in 1977, remains a Japanese folk-rock classic.

== Activism ==
Kina&#x27;s activism is especially focused on peace efforts in his own prefecture of Okinawa, and much of his work as a composer makes explicit links between his art and his activism. Examples of this include his song &quot;Kana-ami no nai shima&quot; or his revision of the song &quot;Shin-jidai no nagare&quot; to add in lyrics that contain words by political activist Chibana Shoichi. He also created The White Ship of Peace Project, to “bring to the USA a message of peace for the future,” to counter to what he called the &quot;black ships&quot; that came to Japan after Matthew C. Perry opened Japan&#x27;s doors to trade with the west. He also coined the slogan, “Lay down your weapons, take up musical instruments,” which he used during a trip to the United States for the project where he presented a sanshin to the UN secretary general. Kina also performs &quot;peace concerts&quot; in war-torn places, most recently in Baghdad.

<text>A cancelled to order (also called and abbreviated CTO) postage stamp, philatelic symbol , is a stamp the issuing postal service has cancelled (marked as used), but has not traveled through the post, but instead gets handed back to a stamp collector or dealer. They can come from withdrawn stocks of stamps cancelled in sheets and sold as remainders or from new sheets for sale at reduced rates to the stamp trade. Postal services of various countries do this in response to collector demand, or to preclude stamps issued for the collector market being used on mail. Some of the history of CTOs is from stamps being given to collectors on an approval basis, in person or through mailings; the first CTOs began in the late 19th century.

==Background==
While some collectors value mint postage stamps, others prefer to collect stamps that have been used. In practice, it is slow and difficult to build a comprehensive collection by removing stamps from mailed envelopes, so modern postal administrations accommodate collectors by offering new stamps already cancelled. The advantage for collectors is that the stamps count as officially used without being subjected to the stress of actually going through the mail. Also, the postal service can arrange a relatively light and unobtrusive cancellation mark.

==Postmarked to order==
Similar to &quot;cancel to order&quot; is postmarked to order which occurs when the stamps are purchased at full value, placed on a piece of mail, and then cancelled by the clerk on request. The mail then is handed back to the customer instead of travelling through the post. This is sometimes called favour cancellation, or hand-back. Some countries&#x27; postal regulations permit this and others forbid it. It is misleading because the cancelled envelope appears to have gone through the mails though it has not. For instance, it is missing additional postal markings typically applied to real mail.

==Misuse of cancellations==
An illegitimate practice related to CTOs involves deliberate misuse of cancellation devices to make a stamp appear used. This typically happens for stamps from remote places, or that were in use for only short periods. Used stamps can be more valuable than unused, sometimes by an order of magnitude. This form of philatelic forgery may involve use of rare types of canceling devices, unusual dates in postmarks, and so forth.

==Topical issues==
Another form of CTO is especially common in countries that try to make money from collectors by issuing large numbers of topical stamps. To make more sales, the stamps must be inexpensive, but if the issuing postal service prices them below face value, commercial mailers could use them to save money by routing their mail through the issuing country, financially hurting the issuer. So these countries issue most of their collector stamps as CTOs. It is easy to recognize such stamps. The cancellation is neat, usually in one corner without a town name, and the gum is still present.

Some countries, such as the emirates that later joined the United Arab Emirates, went further and printed the cancellation directly onto the stamp with the rest of the design. Many collectors do not consider these authentic stamps, and some catalogs categorize them separately.

==Modern issues==
Many modern stamp issues are hard to find genuinely postally used. Due to this, catalogs such as Stanley Gibbons only list modern issues of some countries as cancelled-to-order.

<doc id="579216" wikidata="Q5380265" url="?curid=579216" title="Enterprise, Northwest Territories">
<text>Enterprise is a hamlet in the South Slave Region of the Northwest Territories, Canada, located between Great Slave Lake and the Alberta border on the Hay River.

Enterprise is at an important junction of the Mackenzie Highway and the road to Yellowknife and was established when two service stations were built to take advantage of traffic along these highways. It has since grown to include a weigh station, Winnie&#x27;s Restaurant, and a motel to accommodate travellers. Most of the remaining commercial region, however, is currently closed for business and looking for buyers.

It is a significant point on the Northwest Territories highway system, as all traffic that heads to the two largest population centres, Yellowknife to the north, and the nearby town of Hay River to the northeast, must pass through. As such, a tourism centre/visitors centre is located right in the heart of town, where the old weigh station used to be.

In August 2023, most buildings in Enterprise were destroyed by wildfires.

== History ==
With the completion of the Mackenzie Highway in 1948 from Grimshaw, Alberta, to Hay River on the shores of Great Slave Lake, a number of new service stops were built along its length. In the winter of 1948/1949, Jack Parnall, a freight operator based in Hay River, opened a service station at the junction of the Mackenzie Highway and the Mills Lake winter road, which connected to the Mills Lake freight staging area on the Mackenzie River below Fort Providence. In the late 1950s, the highway was extended to Yellowknife on the north side of Great Slave Lake, and Enterprise became the important junction. Jerry and Mae Eyford opened a Pacific 66 garage in 1956 and Sammy Petersen built a motel and general store in 1964. The community is a service centre for travellers and is also the base of operations for GNWT highway maintenance in this region.

== Demographics ==

In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Enterprise had a population of 75 living in 33 of its 51 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 106. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

At the 2016 Canadian census there were 30 First Nations, 10 Métis and 10 Inuit. The main languages, besides English, are North and South Slavey, Inuinnaqtun (Inuvialuktun) and German.

== Incorporation ==
In 2007, Enterprise filed a petition to change from settlement status to hamlet, which would allow for greater powers by council, a public voting for mayor, and freedom to set property tax rates. On 27 October 2007 the community was officially incorporated and Allan Flamand became the first mayor.

== Climate ==
Enterprise has a subarctic climate (Dfc) with the yearly mean temperature being below zero in spite of the relatively warm summers around resulting in Enterprise being well below the tree line in the boreal forest. Winter average highs are around with lows being , typical of the boreal forests north of the prairies.

<doc id="579219" wikidata="Q306135" url="?curid=579219" title="Β-Carotene">
<text>β-Carotene (&quot;beta&quot;-carotene) is an organic, strongly colored red-orange pigment abundant in fungi, plants, and fruits. It is a member of the carotenes, which are terpenoids (isoprenoids), synthesized biochemically from eight isoprene units and thus having 40 carbons.

Dietary β-carotene is a provitamin A compound, converting in the body to retinol (vitamin A). In foods, it has rich content in carrots, pumpkin, spinach, and sweet potato. It is used as a dietary supplement and may be prescribed to treat erythropoietic protoporphyria, an inherited condition of sunlight sensitivity.

β-carotene is the most common carotenoid in plants. When used as a food coloring, it has the E number E160a. The structure was deduced in 1930.

Isolation of β-carotene from fruits abundant in carotenoids is commonly done using column chromatography. It is industrially extracted from richer sources such as the algae &quot;Dunaliella salina&quot;. The separation of β-carotene from the mixture of other carotenoids is based on the polarity of a compound. β-Carotene is a non-polar compound, so it is separated with a non-polar solvent such as hexane. Being highly conjugated, it is deeply colored, and as a hydrocarbon lacking functional groups, it is lipophilic.

==Provitamin A activity==
Plant carotenoids are the primary dietary source of provitamin A worldwide, with β-carotene as the best-known provitamin A carotenoid. Others include α-carotene and β-cryptoxanthin. Carotenoid absorption is restricted to the duodenum of the small intestine. One molecule of β-carotene can be cleaved by the intestinal enzyme &quot;β,β-carotene 15,15&#x27;-monooxygenase&quot; into two molecules of vitamin A.

==Absorption, metabolism and excretion==
As part of the digestive process, food-sourced carotenoids must be separated from plant cells and incorporated into lipid-containing micelles to be bioaccessible to intestinal enterocytes. If already extracted (or synthetic) and then presented in an oil-filled dietary supplement capsule, there is greater bioavailability compared to that from foods.

At the enterocyte cell wall, β-carotene is taken up by the membrane transporter protein scavenger receptor class B, type 1 (SCARB1). Absorbed β-carotene is then either incorporated as such into chylomicrons or first converted to retinal and then retinol, bound to retinol binding protein 2, before being incorporated into chylomicrons. The conversion process consists of one molecule of β-carotene cleaved by the enzyme beta-carotene 15,15&#x27;-dioxygenase, which is encoded by the BCO1 gene, into two molecules of retinal. When plasma retinol is in the normal range the gene expression for SCARB1 and BCO1 are suppressed, creating a feedback loop that suppresses β-carotene absorption and conversion.

The majority of chylomicrons are taken up by the liver, then secreted into the blood repackaged into low density lipoproteins (LDLs). From these circulating lipoproteins and the chylomicrons that bypassed the liver, β-carotene is taken into cells via receptor SCARB1. Human tissues differ in expression of SCARB1, and hence β-carotene content. Examples expressed as ng/g, wet weight: liver=479, lung=226, prostate=163 and skin=26.

Once taken up by peripheral tissue cells, the major usage of absorbed β-carotene is as a precursor to retinal via symmetric cleavage by the enzyme beta-carotene 15,15&#x27;-dioxygenase, which is encoded by the BCO1 gene. A lesser amount is metabolized by the mitochondrial enzyme beta-carotene 9&#x27;,10&#x27;-dioxygenase, which is encoded by the BCO2 gene. The products of this asymmetric cleavage are two beta-ionone molecules and rosafluene. BCO2 appears to be involved in preventing excessive accumulation of carotenoids; a BCO2 defect in chickens results in yellow skin color due to accumulation in subcutaneous fat.

==Conversion factors==
For counting dietary vitamin A intake, β-carotene may be converted either using the newer retinol activity equivalents (RAE) or the older international unit (IU).

===Retinol activity equivalents (RAEs)===
Since 2001, the US Institute of Medicine uses retinol activity equivalents (RAE) for their Dietary Reference Intakes, defined as follows:
* 1 μg RAE = 1 μg retinol from food or supplements
* 1 μg RAE = 2 μg all-&quot;trans&quot;-β-carotene from supplements
* 1 μg RAE = 12 μg of all-&quot;trans&quot;-β-carotene from food
* 1 μg RAE = 24 μg α-carotene or β-cryptoxanthin from food

RAE takes into account carotenoids&#x27; variable absorption and conversion to vitamin A by humans better than and replaces the older retinol equivalent (RE) (1 μg RE = 1 μg retinol, 6 μg β-carotene, or 12 μg α-carotene or β-cryptoxanthin). RE was developed 1967 by the United Nations/World Health Organization Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO/WHO).

===International Units===
Another older unit of vitamin A activity is the international unit (IU). Like retinol equivalent, the international unit does not take into account carotenoid variable absorption and conversion to vitamin A by humans, as well as the more modern retinol activity equivalent. Food and supplement labels still generally use IU, but IU can be converted to the more useful retinol activity equivalent as follows:
* 1 μg RAE = 3.33 IU retinol
* 1 IU retinol = 0.3 μg RAE
* 1 IU β-carotene from supplements = 0.3 μg RAE
* 1 IU β-carotene from food = 0.05 μg RAE
* 1 IU α-carotene or β-cryptoxanthin from food = 0.025 μg RAE1

==Dietary sources==
The average daily intake of β-carotene is in the range 2–7 mg, as estimated from a pooled analysis of 500,000 women living in the US, Canada, and some European countries. Beta-carotene is found in many foods and is sold as a dietary supplement. β-Carotene contributes to the orange color of many different fruits and vegetables. Vietnamese gac (&quot;Momordica cochinchinensis&quot; Spreng.) and crude palm oil are particularly rich sources, as are yellow and orange fruits, such as cantaloupe, mangoes, pumpkin, and papayas, and orange root vegetables such as carrots and sweet potatoes.

The color of β-carotene is masked by chlorophyll in green leaf vegetables such as spinach, kale, sweet potato leaves, and sweet gourd leaves.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture lists foods high in β-carotene content:

===No dietary requirement===
Government and non-government organizations have not set a dietary requirement for β-carotene.

== Side effects ==
Excess β-carotene is predominantly stored in the fat tissues of the body. The most common side effect of excessive β-carotene consumption is carotenodermia, a physically harmless condition that presents as a conspicuous orange skin tint arising from deposition of the carotenoid in the outermost layer of the epidermis.

===Carotenosis===
Carotenoderma, also referred to as carotenemia, is a benign and reversible medical condition where an excess of dietary carotenoids results in orange discoloration of the outermost skin layer. It is associated with a high blood β-carotene value. This can occur after a month or two of consumption of beta-carotene rich foods, such as carrots, carrot juice, tangerine juice, mangos, or in Africa, red palm oil. β-carotene dietary supplements can have the same effect. The discoloration extends to palms and soles of feet, but not to the white of the eye, which helps distinguish the condition from jaundice. Carotenodermia is reversible upon cessation of excessive intake. Consumption of greater than 30 mg/day for a prolonged period has been confirmed as leading to carotenemia.

===No risk for hypervitaminosis A===
At the enterocyte cell wall, β-carotene is taken up by the membrane transporter protein scavenger receptor class B, type 1 (SCARB1). Absorbed β-carotene is then either incorporated as such into chylomicrons or first converted to retinal and then retinol, bound to retinol binding protein 2, before being incorporated into chylomicrons. The conversion process consists of one molecule of β-carotene cleaved by the enzyme beta-carotene 15,15&#x27;-dioxygenase, which is encoded by the BCO1 gene, into two molecules of retinal. When plasma retinol is in the normal range the gene expression for SCARB1 and BCO1 are suppressed, creating a feedback loop that suppresses absorption and conversion. Because of these two mechanisms, high intake will not lead to hypervitaminosis A.

===Drug interactions===
β-Carotene can interact with medication used for lowering cholesterol. Taking them together can lower the effectiveness of these medications and is considered only a moderate interaction. Bile acid sequestrants and proton-pump inhibitors can decrease absorption of β-carotene. Consuming alcohol with β-carotene can decrease its ability to convert to retinol and could possibly result in hepatotoxicity.

===β-Carotene and lung cancer in smokers===
Chronic high doses of β-carotene supplementation increases the probability of lung cancer in smokers while its natural vitamer, retinol, increases lung cancer in smokers and nonsmokers. The effect is specific to supplementation dose as no lung damage has been detected in those who are exposed to cigarette smoke and who ingest a physiological dose of β-carotene (6 mg), in contrast to high pharmacological dose (30 mg).

Increases in lung cancer have been attributed to the tendency of β-carotene to oxidize, yet based on the pharmacokinetics of β-carotene absorption and transport through the intestine and the lack of specific β-carotene transporters, it is unlikely that β-carotene reaches the lung of smokers in sufficient quantities. Additional research is required to understand the link between the increased risk of cancer and all-cause mortality following β-carotene supplementation.

Additionally, supplemental, high-dose β-carotene may increase the risk of prostate cancer, intracerebral hemorrhage, and cardiovascular and total mortality irrespective of smoking status.

== Industrial sources ==
β-carotene is industrially made either by total synthesis (see ) or by extraction from biological sources such as vegetables, microalgae (especially &quot;Dunaliella salina&quot;), and genetically-engineered microbes. The synthetic path is low-cost and high-yield.

==Research==
Medical authorities generally recommend obtaining beta-carotene from food rather than dietary supplements. A 2013 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that high-dosage (≥9.6 mg/day) beta-carotene supplementation is associated with a 6% increase in the risk of all-cause mortality, while low-dosage (&lt;9.6 mg/day) supplementation does not have a significant effect on mortality. Research is insufficient to determine whether a minimum level of beta-carotene consumption is necessary for human health and to identify what problems might arise from insufficient beta-carotene intake. However, a 2018 meta-analysis mostly of prospective cohort studies found that both dietary and circulating beta-carotene are associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality. The highest circulating beta-carotene category, compared to the lowest, correlated with a 37% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality, while the highest dietary beta-carotene intake category, compared to the lowest, was linked to an 18% decrease in the risk of all-cause mortality.

===Macular degeneration===

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) represents the leading cause of irreversible blindness in elderly people. AMD is an oxidative stress, retinal disease that affects the macula, causing progressive loss of central vision. β-carotene content is confirmed in human retinal pigment epithelium. Reviews reported mixed results for observational studies, with some reporting that diets higher in β-carotene correlated with a decreased risk of AMD whereas other studies reporting no benefits. Reviews reported that for intervention trials using only β-carotene, there was no change to risk of developing AMD.

===Cancer===
A meta-analysis concluded that supplementation with β-carotene does not appear to decrease the risk of cancer overall, nor specific cancers including: pancreatic, colorectal, prostate, breast, melanoma, or skin cancer generally. High levels of β-carotene may increase the risk of lung cancer in current and former smokers. Results are not clear for thyroid cancer.

===Cataract===
A Cochrane review looked at supplementation of β-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E, independently and combined, on people to examine differences in risk of cataract, cataract extraction, progression of cataract, and slowing the loss of visual acuity. These studies found no evidence of any protective effects afforded by β-carotene supplementation on preventing and slowing age-related cataract. A second meta-analysis compiled data from studies that measured diet-derived serum beta-carotene and reported a not statistically significant 10% decrease in cataract risk.

===Erythropoietic protoporphyria===
High doses of β-carotene (up to 180 mg per day) may be used as a treatment for erythropoietic protoporphyria, a rare inherited disorder of sunlight sensitivity, without toxic effects.

=== Food drying ===
Foods rich in carotenoid dyes show discoloration upon drying. This is due to thermal degradation of carotenoids, possibly via isomerization and oxidation reactions.

<text>The Truman Sports Complex is a sports and entertainment facility in Kansas City, Missouri. It includes two major league sports venues: GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium, which is home to the National Football League&#x27;s Kansas City Chiefs, and Kauffman Stadium, which hosts Major League Baseball&#x27;s Kansas City Royals. The complex also hosts various other events during the rest of the year.

==Overview==

The Truman Sports Complex was built and owned by the government of Jackson County and managed by the Jackson County Sports Complex Authority, which is a State of Missouri agency. The current complex design, created by Charles Deaton, was arrived at when Deaton caught the ear of Kansas City Chiefs General Manager Jack Steadman and suggested building side-by-side stadiums for the two sports with each stadium customized to its needs. The original plan called for separate side-by-side stadiums with a mutual rolling roof. However, the roof was never built due to cost. The complex was revolutionary in an age when new stadiums tended to be built as multiuse venues for planning and cost purposes.

The design not only made Deaton&#x27;s reputation, but also made that of the architects that implemented his plans, Kivett and Myers. In 1975, the firm merged with Kansas City architect firm HNTB and went on to design stadiums like Giants Stadium, the RCA Dome, Broncos Stadium at Mile High, and Ralph Wilson Stadium. In 1983, several HNTB architects were hired by St. Louis-based architectural firm Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum, forming what would later become Populous and opening their primary office in Kansas City. Had the 40–year extension of an existing 3/8th Jackson County, Missouri, tax passed when it was put to a vote on April 2, 2024, Populous would have been the company to build New Royals Stadium.

The construction of the complex was undertaken by the joint venture of the Sharp, Kidde, and Webb construction firms.

On October 27, 1985, the Chiefs hosted a Noon kickoff game at Arrowhead Stadium against the Denver Broncos in which Denver won, 30–10. Later that night across the complex at Royals Stadium, the Royals won Game 7 of the 1985 World Series (7:30pm first pitch) against the St. Louis Cardinals.

Kansas City began a project to renovate both Arrowhead and Kauffman Stadiums in 2007, following the passage of a cent sales tax increase in a referendum in 2006. Improvements to Kauffman Stadium were finished in time for the MLB Opening Day in 2009, and Arrowhead Stadium was completed in time for the NFL Opening Day in 2010. A separate tax referendum to raise funds to finally build the rolling roof failed. Both stadiums are being renovated by Populous.

With renovations, both the Royals and Chiefs have leases on the stadiums through January 31, 2031. Their previous lease which was renegotiated in 1990 had been set to expire January 31, 2015.

===GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium===
GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium, home of the National Football League&#x27;s Kansas City Chiefs, opened in the fall of 1972. George Halas called Arrowhead &quot;the most revolutionary, futuristic sports complex I have ever seen.&quot; Fans occasionally refer to the stadium as &quot;The Sea of Red&quot; or simply just Arrowhead. The stadium is commonly referred to as the &quot;Home of the CHIEFS&quot; at the beginning of every home game. Arrowhead has long held a reputation for being one of, if not the, loudest outdoor stadium in the NFL due to the exuberance of the Chiefs&#x27; fans. In recent years, Arrowhead has competed with Lumen Field in Seattle for the loudest open-air stadium in the world, as certified by the Guinness Book of World Records. Kansas City briefly held the record when the crowd roar reached 137.5 decibels in a Chiefs victory over the Oakland Raiders on October 13, 2013; but Seattle&#x27;s 12th Man broke the record only a few weeks later at 137.8 decibels. Arrowhead reclaimed the title, however, on September 29, 2014, when noise levels reached 142.2 decibels as the Chiefs defeated the New England Patriots on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;.

===Kauffman Stadium===
Kauffman Stadium, home of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Kansas City Royals, opened in early 1973 as Royals Stadium and is located adjacent to Arrowhead. The stadium&#x27;s name was changed in 1993 to honor Royals founder Ewing Kauffman just months before his death. Even though the stadium is slightly older than 40 years old, it is the sixth-oldest stadium in MLB, as a result of the construction of a number of new stadiums in the 1990s. It was the only baseball-specific stadium completed from the early 1960s until the early 1990s. It is also one of eight stadiums in Major League Baseball that doesn&#x27;t have a corporate-sponsored name (the others are Yankee Stadium, Fenway Park, Wrigley Field, Oriole Park at Camden Yards, Dodger Stadium, Angel Stadium of Anaheim, and Nationals Park).

In addition to that, the stadium was the last baseball-only park that was built in the majors (not counting temporary facilities) from 1966 to 1991 and one of the few baseball-only facilities built in the majors during the heyday of the cookie-cutter stadium era, as well as one of two such facilities (alongside Dodger Stadium) that are still active and were never converted for use as multi-purpose stadiums. Despite its status as a baseball-only park throughout its history, it is one of only two active MLB stadiums (the other being Rogers Centre) that features symmetrical outfield dimensions, commonly associated with multi-purpose stadiums.

<text>Land reclamation, often known as reclamation, and also known as land fill (not to be confused with a waste landfill), is the process of creating new land from oceans, seas, riverbeds or lake beds. The land reclaimed is known as reclamation ground, reclaimed land, or land fill.

==History==
In Ancient Egypt, the rulers of the Twelfth Dynasty (c. 2000–1800 BC) undertook a far-sighted land reclamation scheme to increase agricultural output. They constructed levees and canals to connect the Faiyum with the Bahr Yussef waterway, diverting water that would have flowed into Lake Moeris and causing gradual evaporation around the lake&#x27;s edges, creating new farmland from the reclaimed land. A similar land reclamation system using dams and drainage canals was used in the Greek Copaic Basin during the Middle Helladic Period (c. 1900–1600 BC). Another early large-scale project was the Beemster Polder in the Netherlands, realized in 1612 adding of land. In Hong Kong the Praya Reclamation Scheme added of land in 1890 during the second phase of construction. It was one of the most ambitious projects ever taken during the Colonial Hong Kong era. Some 20% of land in the Tokyo Bay area has been reclaimed, most notably Odaiba artificial island. The city of Rio de Janeiro was largely built on reclaimed land, as was Wellington, New Zealand.

==Methods==
Land reclamation can be achieved by a number of different methods. The simplest method involves filling the area with large amounts of heavy rock and/or cement, then filling with clay and dirt until the desired height is reached. The process is called &quot;infilling&quot; and the material used to fill the space is generally called &quot;infill&quot;. Draining of submerged wetlands is often used to reclaim land for agricultural use. Deep cement mixing is used typically in situations in which the material displaced by either dredging or draining may be contaminated and hence needs to be contained. Land dredging is also another method of land reclamation. It is the removal of sediments and debris from the bottom of a body of water. It is commonly used for maintaining reclaimed land masses as sedimentation, a natural process, fills channels and harbors.

==Notable instances==

This is part of the nation&#x27;s plans to create more homes and common spaces in the land scarce city-state. Upcoming projects, such as the Long Island project, involving the reclamation of three tracts of land (expected to span around 800 ha), which is set at a higher level to protect against rising sea levels. It will also enclose a body of water, acting as a reservoir, strengthening the nation&#x27;s water resilience. Detailed technical studies are currently underway lasting 5 years. This project would take a few decades to plan and implement.

==Agriculture==

Agriculture was a driver of land reclamation before industrialisation. In South China, farmers reclaimed paddy fields by enclosing an area with a stone wall on the sea shore near a river mouth or river delta. The species of rice that are grown on these grounds are more salt tolerant. Another use of such enclosed land is the creation of fish ponds. It is commonly seen on the Pearl River Delta and Hong Kong. These reclaimed areas also attract species of migrating birds.

A related practice is the draining of swampy or seasonally submerged wetlands to convert them to farmland. While this does not create new land exactly, it allows commercially productive use of land that would otherwise be restricted to wildlife habitat. It is also an important method of mosquito control.

Even in the post-industrial age, there have been land reclamation projects intended for increasing available agricultural land. For example, the village of Ogata in Akita, Japan, was established on land reclaimed from Lake Hachirōgata (Japan&#x27;s second largest lake at the time) starting in 1957. By 1977, the amount of land reclaimed totalled .

==Artificial islands==
Artificial islands are an example of land reclamation. Creating an artificial island is an expensive and risky undertaking. It is often considered in places with high population density and a scarcity of flat land. Kansai International Airport (in Osaka) and Hong Kong International Airport are examples where this process was deemed necessary. The Palm Islands, The World and hotel Burj al-Arab off Dubai in the United Arab Emirates are other examples of artificial islands (although there is yet no real &quot;scarcity of land&quot; in Dubai), as well as the Flevopolder in the Netherlands which is the largest artificial island in the world.

==Beach restoration==

Beach rebuilding is the process of repairing beaches using materials such as sand or mud from inland. This can be used to build up beaches suffering from beach starvation or erosion from longshore drift. It stops the movement of the original beach material through longshore drift and retains a natural look to the beach. Although it is not a long-lasting solution, it is cheap compared to other types of coastal defences. An example of this is the city of Mumbai.

==Landfill==
As human overcrowding of developed areas intensified during the 20th century, it has become important to develop land re-use strategies for completed landfills. Some of the most common usages are for parks, golf courses and other sports fields. Increasingly, however, office buildings and industrial uses are made on a completed landfill. In these latter uses, methane capture is customarily carried out to minimize explosive hazard within the building.

An example of a Class A office building constructed over a landfill is the Dakin Building at Sierra Point, Brisbane, California. The underlying fill was deposited from 1965 to 1985, mostly consisting of construction debris from San Francisco and some municipal wastes. Aerial photographs prior to 1965 show this area to be s of the San Francisco Bay. A clay cap was constructed over the debris prior to building approval.

A notable example is Sydney Olympic Park, the primary venue for the 2000 Summer Olympic Games, which was built atop an industrial wasteland that included landfills.

Another strategy for landfill is the incineration of landfill trash at high temperature via the plasma-arc gasification process, which is currently used at two facilities in Japan, and was proposed to be used at a facility in St. Lucie County, Florida. The planned facility in Florida was later canceled.

==Environmental impact==

Draining wetlands for ploughing, for example, is a form of habitat destruction. In some parts of the world, new reclamation projects are restricted or no longer allowed, due to environmental protection laws. Reclamation projects have strong negative impacts on coastal populations, although some species can take advantage of the newly created area. A 2022 global analysis estimated that 39% of losses (approximately ) and 14% of gains (approximately ) of tidal wetlands (mangroves, tidal flats, and tidal marshes) between 1999 and 2019 were due to direct human activities, including conversion to aquaculture, agriculture, plantations, coastal developments and other physical structures.

===Environmental legislation===

The State of California created a state commission, the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission, in 1965 to protect San Francisco Bay and regulate development near its shores. The commission was created in response to growing concern over the shrinking size of the bay.

Hong Kong legislators passed the Protection of the Harbour Ordinance, proposed by the Society for Protection of the Harbour, in 1997 in an effort to safeguard the increasingly threatened Victoria Harbour against encroaching land development. Several large reclamation schemes at Green Island, West Kowloon, and Kowloon Bay were subsequently shelved, and others reduced in size.

==Dangers==
Reclaimed land is highly susceptible to soil liquefaction during earthquakes, which can amplify the amount of damage that occurs to buildings and infrastructure. Subsidence is another issue, both from soil compaction on filled land, and also when wetlands are enclosed by levees and drained to create polders. Drained marshes will eventually sink below the surrounding water level, increasing the danger from flooding.

<text>Severomorsk (), known as Vayenga () until 18 April 1951, is a closed town in Murmansk Oblast, Russia. Severomorsk is the main administrative base of the Russian Northern Fleet. The town is situated on the coast of the Barents Sea along the Kola Bay northeast of Murmansk, the administrative centre of the oblast, to which it is connected by railway and a motorway. It is the main naval base of the Northern Fleet of Russia and the sixth largest city in the world beyond the Arctic Circle.

==History==
===Early settlement===
The first settlement on the site of the current city was established between 1896 and 1897. It was named Vayenga (), after the river, the name of which itself comes from the Sami &quot;vayongg&quot;, meaning a female reindeer. The settlers were engaged in hunting, fishing and cattle breeding. In 1917, only thirteen people lived in the settlement.

===The founding of the Northern Fleet Base===
In 1926, a timber procurement office was founded in Murmansk, one of the teams of which was sent to Vayenga. A barrack-dormitory, a bathhouse, and a telephone line were built in Vayenga. In 1933, the bay was chosen as one of the bases for the newly created Northern Fleet. From 1934 and until the beginning of World War II, wooden and brick buildings and military facilities were built in the town, and the Vayenga-1 naval airfield was built in the neighbouring bay. From August 1941, all construction was mothballed. The airfield was used by the British; namely No. 151 Wing RAF to protect the Arctic Convoys before their fighters were later handed over to the Soviet Naval Aviation.

After the war, construction was resumed. Vayenga, given the existing facilities, was chosen as the main base for the Northern Fleet. On 1 September 1947, the headquarters and command of the Northern Fleet were relocated from Polyarny to Vayenga. In the same year, the first secondary school in the city was opened. The population of Vayenga was 3,884 people. In 1948, Vayenga&#x27;s village Council of Workers&#x27; Deputies was formed.

===Severomorsk===
On April 18, 1951, Vayenga received town status and was renamed to Severomorsk, from the Russian &quot;sever&quot; (север), meaning &quot;north&quot;, and &quot;more&quot; (море), meaning &quot;sea&quot;. By the 1960s, the town was already thoroughly developed - the city had a bakery, a sausage factory, and a soft drink bottling plant, and a swimming pool was built. On 26 November 1996, by the decree of the President of the Russian Federation, the town of Severomorsk, as a major naval base, was transformed into a closed administrative-territorial entity (ZATO) (urban district) with the inclusion of the following populated areas under its jurisdiction: Safonovo, Roslyakovo, Safonovo-1, Severomorsk-3, and Shchukozero.

<doc id="579228" wikidata="Q151227" url="?curid=579228" title="Pokanoket">
<text>The Pokanoket (also spelled Pakanokick) are a group of Wampanoag people and the village governed by Massasoit (c. 1581–1661), chief sachem of the Wampanoag people. 

The village was located on what is now called Mount Hope in Bristol, Rhode Island. Later the term Pokanoket broadened to refer to the peoples and lands governed by Massasoit and his successors, which were part of the Wampanoag people in what is now Rhode Island and Massachusetts.

== Name ==
Pokanoket is also spelled Pauquunaukit, and translates as &quot;land at the clearing&quot; from the Massachusett.

== History ==
At the time of the pilgrims&#x27; arrival in Plymouth, the realm of Pokanoket included parts of Rhode Island and much of southeastern Massachusetts. European accounts of Pokanoket social life noted the political authority of the Massasoit (Great Leader).

The realm of the Pokanoket was extensive and known to the Pilgrims before they arrived at Plymouth, Massachusetts on the &quot;Mayflower&quot; in 1620. William Bradford wrote that he had received before the Pilgrims sailed: &quot;The Pokanokets, which live to the west of Plymouth, bear an inveterate malice to the English, and are of more strength than all the savages from there to Penobscot. Their desire of revenge was occasioned by an English man who, having many of them on board, made a great slaughter with their murderers and small shot, when (as they say) they offered no injury on their part.&quot; 

The area in Rhode Island consisting of Bristol, Barrington, and Warren (the latter named Sowams by the natives) was the main settlement of the Pokanoket when the Pilgrims arrived. Bradford had been told that the land of the Pokanoket had &quot;the richest soil, and much open ground fit for English grain&quot;.

Giovanni da Verrazzano sailed into Narragansett Bay in 1524, and people appeared on the shores, most likely Pokanokets. The navigator&#x27;s recorded latitude of 41°40′ north corresponds to Mount Hope Bay, where the seat of the Pokanoket is located. Verrazzano wrote of these Rhode Island Native Americans whom he encountered: &quot;These people are the most beautiful and have the most civil customs we have found on this voyage.&quot;

The Pilgrims lost more than half of their people due to sickness and starvation over the first winter. The Pokanoket taught them how to plant crops and live in this country. Despite the fears initially felt by the Pilgrims, the Pokanoket quickly made a pact of peace with the new settlers. Bradford referred to the Pokanoket leader Ousamequin as &quot;their great Sachem, called Massasoit&quot;. Ousamequin was succeeded as Great Leader of the Pokanoket by his sons, first by Wamsutta, (also known as Alexander), and then by Metacomet (also known as Philip), who was killed in the King Philip&#x27;s War (1675–76).

Natick, sometimes referred to as Pokanoket, is the dialect of Massachusett spoken among the Pokanoket.

== List of Pokanoket leaders ==

== Historical territories ==
The Pokanoket&#x27;s conceded territory shown in the map featured here is a reconstruction of Pokanoket ancestral boundaries based on a political and topographical map from 1895, which itself drew on 17th-century topographical descriptions of political borders.

Today, the area includes cities and towns on the Massachusetts and Rhode Island border such as Bristol, Warren, Barrington, East Providence, Seekonk, Rehoboth, Attleboro, Cumberland, North Attleboro, Norton, Mansfield, Dighton, and Somerset.

== Map points ==

# Both the Seller Map and the Hack Map document Pokanoket ancestral land to the east and west of the head of what is now called Narragansett Bay.
# Pokanoket used rivers as boundaries for their ancestral lands due to the natural geographical features of their area. On the west side of the bay, the boundary starts in the land that is called Cowessett ( Cowee means pines. Cowessett Place of Pines ) (Land at the border). The Pawtuxet River is the natural boundary that defines the border between the Narragansett and Pokanoket Tribes. Narragansett lands are to the south of the Pawtuxet River.
# Pokanoket lands lie to the north and northeast of the Pawtuxet River as far north as the Ponegunsett Reservoir, then continue northeast of the Ponegunsett Reservoir, northward up the Chepachet River. 
# The Nipmuc lands are west and northwest of the Chepachet River. East of this river is Pokanoket lands. 
# We now follow the Charles River from its basin northeasterly until it empties into Boston Bay. The lands to the west of the Charles River are Nipmuc lands. The lands to the east are Pokanoket lands. 
# The lands north of the Charles River are Massachusetts lands and the lands south of the Charles River are Pokanoket lands. 
# The eastern mainland boundary of Pokanoket is located at what is now the Cape Cod Canal, which was once a tributary extended from Great Herring Pond. West of this border is Pokanoket land. East of this natural border is the land of the Nausett. 
# This leaves the islands in what we now call Narragansett Bay and the islands off the coast. All the islands in Narragansett Bay on this map are highlighted except for Jamestown and Dutch Island. These two islands belong to the Narragansett, as well as Block Island located in Rhode Island Sound.

== Descendants ==
Today, descendants from the Pokanoket village are part of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, a federally recognized tribe in Massachusetts.

An unrecognized tribe, the Pokanoket Tribe, also known as the Pokanoket Nation claims to descend from the Pokanoket people. They are not federally recognized; state-recognized by Rhode Island, Massachusetts, or any other state; or recognized by Wampanoag tribes. The town of Warren, Rhode Island, lists a land acknowledgment on a town sign.

<doc id="579229" wikidata="Q27074633" url="?curid=579229" title="Grey-headed fish eagle">
<text>The grey-headed fish eagle (Icthyophaga ichthyaetus) is a fish-eating bird of prey from Southeast Asia. It is a large stocky raptor with adults having dark brown upper body, grey head and lighter underbelly and white legs. Juveniles are paler with darker streaking. It is often confused with the lesser fish eagle (&quot;Icthyophaga humilis&quot;) and the Pallas&#x27;s fish eagle. The lesser fish eagle is similar in plumage but smaller and the Pallas&#x27;s fish eagle shares the same habitat and feeding behaviour but is larger with longer wings and darker underparts. Is often called tank eagle in Sri Lanka due to its fondness for irrigation tanks.

== Taxonomy ==
The grey-headed fish eagle is included in the order Accipitriformes and the family Accipitridae, which includes most birds of prey except for the ospreys and falcons. Lerner &amp; Mindell placed the grey-headed fish eagle in the subfamily Haliaeetinae, which includes the genera &quot;Haliaeetus&quot; (sea eagles) It was first described by Horsfield in 1841 as &quot;Falco ichthyaetus&quot;. This paraphyletic group forms a close sister relationship with the subfamily Milvinae (composed of two genera, &quot;Milvus&quot; and &quot;Haliatur&quot;), based on the shared trait of basal fusion of the second and third phalanges found only in these two groups. Some taxonomic authorities place this species in the monotypic genus Ichthyophaga.

== Description ==
A smallish to medium-sized but quite bulky fish eagle. Has a small bill, a small head on long neck, rounded tail and shortish legs with unfeathered tarsi and long talons. Wings aren&#x27;t very long and wingtips reach less than halfway down tail. Males and females are sexually dimorphic. The grey-headed fish eagle has a body length of 61–75 cm. Females are heavier than males at 2.3–2.7 kg compared to 1.6 kg. The tail measures between 23–28 cm and the tarsus 8.5–10 cm. The wingspan measure between 155–170 cm.

Adults are grey-brown with a pale grey head and pale iris, belly and tail are white with the having a broad black subterminal band. Breast and neck are brown, with the wings on top dark brown with blacker primaries and below brown. Juveniles the head and neck are brown, greyer on the ides of throat, with buff supercilia and whitish streaks. The rest of the upperparts are darker brown, edged with grey and secondaries and tertials faintly barred. Tail black and white marbled with broader dark subterminal band and white tip. Belly and thighs white, while breast and flanks brown streaked with white. Iris is darker than adult. As juveniles mature subterminal band becomes more prominent, head becomes greyer and loses streaking becoming uniformly brown.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The grey-headed fish eagle has a wide distribution (38˚ N to 6˚ S) that encompasses India and South-East Asia to Malaysia, Western Indonesia and Philippines. It is generally uncommon but can be rare or local. In North and East India it is found in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Assam. It is uncommon in North and East Sri Lanka, rare and local in Nepal and uncommon and local in Bangladesh. It is rare and local in South Thailand and rare in Laos; scarce in Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia to Sumatra; very rare in Java and Sulawesi except for a small local population and scarce in Borneo and the Philippines.

=== Habitat ===
Grey-headed fish eagles live in lowland forest up to 1,500 m above sea-level. Their nests are close to bodies of water such as slow-moving rivers and streams, lakes, lagoons, reservoirs, marshes, swamps and coastal lagoons and estuaries. They are also known to frequent irrigation tanks in Sri Lanka, hence where their alternate English in Sri Lanka comes from.

== Ecology and behaviour ==
It is a sedentary bird that can be solitary or occur in pairs. It is non-migratory. Juveniles disperse from the breeding areas, presumably in search of mates or another food source. The grey headed fish eagle spends much of its time perching upright on bare branches over water bodies, occasionally flying down to catch fish. Flight is heavy looking with sharp and full wing-beats on flattish wings. Spends little time in the air soaring possibly due to habitat it lives in and no other aerial displays have been described.

=== Breeding ===
The breeding season of the grey-headed fish eagle usually takes place between November and May across most of its mainland range, but changes from December to March in Sri Lanka, November to January in India. Nests have been found in January–March in Burma, April in Sumatra and August in Borneo, it is unclear whether these nest were old or being used for breeding. Breeding in the protected Prek Toal area of the Tonlé Sap follow the flood regimes that begin in September, with eggs near hatching or hatching at peak flood waters in October–November.

The grey-headed fish eagle builds a huge stick nest, up to 1.5 metres across and, with repeated use, up to 2 metres deep. The nest is lined with green leaves and were situated in tall trees (8–30 m) on or near the top of the tree with an open crown structure, which can be in a forest or a standalone tree. Nest sites were always near or by a water source with the avoidance of human habitations and is consistent with other fish eagles due to ease of access and food abundance.

The clutch size can be between 2 and 4 eggs but usually 2 unmarked white eggs are laid per couple. Little is known about the level of parental care employed by the grey headed fish eagle, the evidence points towards monogamy and shared parental care duties. Both incubation, foraging and fledgling feeding are carried out by the male and female, with incubation lasting 45–50 days and the fledgling period 70 days.

=== Foraging and diet ===
As the common name suggests the grey-headed fish eagle is a specialist piscivore, which preys upon live fish and scavenges dead fish and occasionally reptiles and terrestrial birds and small mammals. Tingay et al. found that the diet of the grey-headed fish eagle in the Prek Toal protected area of the Tonlé Sap contains the endangered Tonlé Sap water snake. Whether this is the primary prey item of their diet or a seasonal occurrence in this are remains unclear.
The most common method of foraging used is to catch fish from a hunting perch close to a water source with a short flight to snatch prey on the water surface or just below. Also quarters over stretches of river or lakes and fish too heavy to lift may be dragged to bank to devour. It is also dynamic in prey pursuit and can catch fish in rough water such as rapids. Both species in the genus &quot;Ichthyophaga&quot; have strongly recurved talons like the osprey (Pandionidae) a specialisation for catching fish, which is lacking in the genus &quot;Haliaeetus&quot; (sea eagles).

=== Voice ===
The calls of the grey-headed fish eagle include a gurgling &quot;awh-awhr&quot; and &quot;chee-warr&quot; repeated 5–6 times, an owlish &quot;ooo-wok&quot;, &quot;ooo-wok&quot;, &quot;ooo-wok&quot;, a nasally honking &quot;uh-wuk&quot; and a loud high pitched scream. These begin as subdued low short notes each succeeding one more strongly upturned and more strident then previous then dying away again and are uttered from a perch or on the wing. Fledglings give a longer nasal &quot;uuuw-whaar&quot; that starts low and subdued then becomes, louder and higher and strident. During the breeding season becomes quite vocal, with calls being loud and far carrying, often calling also at night.

== Threats ==
Although not currently considered to be threatened with extinction, the population of grey-headed fish eagles is declining, the result of numerous and varied threats. The loss of suitable wetland habitat, deforestation, over-fishing, siltation, persecution, human disturbance and pollution resulting in a loss of nesting sites and reduced food supply. Tingay et al. noted that these statements are based mostly on anecdotal evidence, although their studies found a definitive negative link between human habitation and grey-headed fish eagle nest occupancy rates in Cambodia. Another critical threat to the Cambodian populations of the grey-headed fish eagle on the Tonlé Sap is the damming of the Mekong River for hydropower, which will possibly have adverse effects on critical flood regimes of the Tonlé Sap.

== Conservation status ==
The grey-headed fish eagle is currently listed as Near-Threatened on the IUCN Red List. The population is estimated to be between 10,000–100,000 mature individuals on the basis that it may not exceed a five figure total. This estimate was completed in 2001 with poor data quality, combined with a marked decrease in populations is would be reasonable to assume that the number is closer to 10,000 and bordering on being classified Vulnerable. The population is spread out over 5 million km² and is now thought be only common locally, with moderate rapid population decline throughout its range.

Although there are no active conservation measures currently in place for the grey-headed fish eagle, there is an annual monitoring programme for the breeding population in the Prek Toal protected area at the Tonlé Sap Lake in Cambodia, which has been conducted each year since 2006. The programme provides baseline information on the ecology of the species and the status and distribution of the breeding population. A number of other conservation actions have also been proposed by the IUCN, these include surveys to reveal important areas and regularly monitor at various sites throughout its range, protect forest in areas known to be important to the species and conduct awareness campaigns involving local residents to engender pride in the species and encourage better care of wetland areas.

<text>South Karelia (or &quot;Southern Karelia&quot;, ; ) is a region of Finland. It borders the regions of Kymenlaakso, South Savo and North Karelia, as well as Russia (Republic of Karelia and Leningrad Oblast). 

== Historical province ==
&quot;For history, geography and culture see: Finnish Karelia&quot;

==Heraldry==

The coat of arms of South Karelia is composed of the arms of Karelia.

==Nature==
The ground in the region consists of loose soil types accumulated on top of bedrock during the last ice age, as the ice sheet retreated to the northwest. The soil shaped by the Ice Age is still clearly visible in the South Karelian environment and scenery. The greatest natural wonder in South Karelia consists of the parallel dividers called Salpausselkä, which transect the region, and their large edge formations. At its steepest, the divider plunges into Lake Saimaa in Kyläniemi village of Taipalsaari.

The variable terrain and great local height differences make South Karelia exceptional in Southern Finland. As a contrast to the rugged rocky islands of Saimaa and flat pinewoods, the region features lush deciduous woodlands reaching out from the Ladogian Karelia around Parikkala, Imatra and Lappeenranta. Parikkala and Rautjärvi are clearly different from other areas in the region, with the Ladogian Karelia even affecting their climate. The lush deciduous zone with great biodiversity shelters the most valuable wetlands of Finland. Bird wetland habitats of national importance are found in Siikalahti and Tarassiinlahti of Parikkala and Kuokkalampi in Ruokolahti. These wetlands harbour endangered habitats – birds, dragonflies, bats and butterflies.

== Regional Council ==
The Regional Council of South Karelia is a joint municipal authority of nine member municipalities. The council operates as the authority for regional development and unit for regional planning and looks after regional interests and to promote economic development and cultural well-being in South Karelia. The council has statutory responsibility for regional development and planning.

The EU&#x27;s regional Objective Programmes for South Karelia have partly been prepared in the council as it also implements and coordinates various projects. The council is also represented in several international organisations, such as AEBR.

== Municipalities ==

The region of South Karelia consists of nine municipalities, two of which have city status (marked in bold).

==Tourism==

South Karelia is a popular tourist area in Finland with its special features – its nature, its location between Lake Saimaa and the border as well as its cultural heritage and history as a border region. Thanks to the natural attractions, waterways and islands, tourism has natural prerequisites for developing in South Karelia. The provincial centres are continuously improving their services. Lappeenranta has in recent years focused particularly on tourism services for families, and Imatra on fishing and spa tourism. There is a good selection of agritourism attractions and tourism services available around the region.

The most interesting attractions include Lake Saimaa, Saimaa Canal, Lappeenranta Fortification and Imatrankoski rapids, the Russian border and the short distance to Vyborg and St. Petersburg. Lappeenranta Fortification and its museums portray the history of the border zone and border arrangements over several centuries. Cruises on Lake Saimaa and along Saimaa Canal up to Vyborg are a unique tourist attraction for Finns and foreigners alike. The high quality guest marinas draw yachters to Lake Saimaa all the way from international waters.

The region also features an interesting cross-section of churches that represent various centuries, architectural styles and denominations. The internationally best-known of these is the Church of the Three Crosses in Imatra designed by Alvar Aalto.

The South Karelian nature has played a key role in the history of tourism. The rapids of Imatrankoski and their surroundings became the first actual tourist attraction in Finland. Russian upper classes and civil servants, in particular, came to marvel at the wild foams of the rapids. In the summer of 1772, Russian Empress Catherine the Great visited Imatra for one day. Her journey from St. Petersburg to Imatra took five days. The rulers and dignitaries of many other countries have left a memento of their visit in the rocks surrounding the rapids. Actual tourism in the modern sense developed in the 19th century. It was speeded up by the completion of Saimaa Canal and St. Petersburg railway in the latter half of the century. What also drew tourists all the way from St. Petersburg was the good fishing to be had in River Vuoksi, Imatra Rapids and Lake Saimaa.

The Rauha – Tiuruniemi area by the Lake Saimaa has long traditions in spa and hotel activities. As early as 1894 the area&#x27;s first hotel spa - Rauha pensionat för turister - was established. In 1912 a Russia-born physicist Dimitri Gabrilovitsch bought the place to transform it into a sanatorium. The clinic&#x27;s services at the time were different kinds of baths as well as galvanic and bright light treatments. The clinic had visitors from Russia, Europe and even the Americas. The spa in Lappeenranta, which is still in business today, was founded in 1871.

Tourism in South Karelia went into a decline for some time after the First World War ended the flows of travellers from St. Petersburg. Interest in domestic travel, which had arisen towards the end of the 19th century, increased as conditions became more settled in the newly independent Finland. Tourism had its heyday before the 1930s depression. The area, including Lake Saimaa and the legendary beaches of Terijoki, was a popular area for holiday villas. Tourism was once more affected by the closing of the borders after the Second World War. The unspoilt nature and Lake Saimaa attracted tourists especially from Central Europe and the Nordic countries. The Germans discovered the rented holiday houses on the shores of Saimaa.

==Education==

Lappeenranta has been voted the best university town in Finland. The campus is welcoming, there are plenty of flats available and international student exchanges are competently organised. Most importantly, however, the education offered is versatile and of a high standard. The study programmes are being developed with an open mind. Some years ago, Lappeenranta University of Technology decided to include business studies in the curriculum. The university and Saimaa University of Applied Sciences were the first in Finland to suggest mutual co-operation between these two types of third-level educational institutes.

<doc id="579233" wikidata="Q1476227" url="?curid=579233" title="Nakajima Aircraft Company">
<text>The was a prominent Japanese aircraft manufacturer and aviation engine manufacturer throughout World War II. It continues as the car and aircraft manufacturer Subaru.

==History==

The Nakajima Aircraft company was Japan&#x27;s first aircraft manufacturer, and was founded in 1918 by Chikuhei Nakajima, a naval engineer, and Seibei Kawanishi, a textile manufacturer, as . In 1919, the two founders split and Nakajima bought out Nihon Aircraft&#x27;s factory with tacit help from the Imperial Japanese Army. The company was renamed Nakajima Aircraft Company in 1919.

The company&#x27;s manufacturing facilities were:
* Tokyo plant
* Musashino plant
* Donryu plant
* Ota plant, near Ōta Station. Visited by Emperor Shōwa on November 16, 1934. Critically damaged by American bombardment on February 10, 1945. Currently a Subaru Corporation plant for kei trucks.
* Koizumi plant, near Nishi-Koizumi station. Critically damaged by American bombardment on April 3, 1945. Currently a Sanyo plant.

==After World War II==
After Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II, the company was forced to close, as the production and research of aircraft was prohibited by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers. This had a severe impact on Nakajima as one of the two largest aircraft manufacturers in Japan; the second was Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI). Unlike MHI, Nakajima did not diversify into shipbuilding and general machinery, and so was forced to dissolve into a number of spin-off companies set up by its former managers, engineers, and workers. As a result, leading aeronautical engineers from the company, such as Ryoichi Nakagawa, helped transform Japan&#x27;s automobile industry.

The company was reborn in 1953 as Fuji Heavy Industries, maker of Fuji Rabbit scooters and Subaru automobiles, and as Fuji Precision Industries (later renamed Prince Motor Company, which merged with Nissan in August 1966), manufacturer of Prince Skyline and Prince Gloria automobiles. Fuji began aircraft production in the mid-1950s and produced military training aircraft and helicopters for the Japan Self-Defense Forces. In 2017, it rebranded as Subaru Corporation.

<text>The Passaic River ( or ) is a river, approximately long, in northern New Jersey. The river in its upper course flows in a highly circuitous route, meandering through the swamp lowlands between the ridge hills of rural and suburban northern New Jersey, called the Great Swamp, draining much of the northern portion of the state through its tributaries.

In its lower (southern) portion, it flows through the most urbanized and industrialized areas of the state, including along Downtown Newark. The lower river suffered from severe pollution and industrial abandonment in the 20th century.
In April 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a $1.7 billion plan to remove of toxic mud from the bottom of lower of the river. It is considered one of the most polluted stretches of water in the nation, and the project is one of the largest toxic cleanups ever undertaken in the nation.

==Course==

The Passaic River rises in the center of Mendham, in southern Morris County. According to Google Maps the river begins at Dubourg Pond located on private land between Spring Hill Road and Hardscrabble Road. This pond is fed by a very small stream that begins from a spring located approximately 1000 feet south west of the pond at the bend in Spring Hill Road. This spring is the likely true headwater of the Passaic River. Leaving Dubourg Pond the river travels northeast and crosses Corey Lane before entering the &quot;Buck Hill Tract Natural Area&quot;. However At this point, the river begins to generally flow south, through Morristown National Historical Park, and forms the boundary between Morris and Somerset counties. In its current path, it passes through the southeast edge and drains Lord Stirling Park then along the western edge of the Great Swamp, which it drains through several small tributaries including Black Brook. The river passes through a gorge in Millington and then turns abruptly northeast, flowing through the valley between Long Hill to the west and the Second Watchung Mountain to the east.

It forms the boundary between Morris and Union counties as it passes Berkeley Heights, New Providence, and Summit. Near Chatham it turns north, forming the boundary between Morris and Essex counties. It passes Livingston and Fairfield, where it flows through the Hatfield Swamp and is joined by the Rockaway River just after the Rockaway is joined by its own tributary, the Whippany River. Southwest of Lincoln Park it passes through the Great Piece Meadows, where it turns abruptly eastward and is joined at Two Bridges by its major tributary, the Pompton River, then meandering through Little Falls, New Jersey as it drops over a fall, across some rapids, and under Passaic County Route 646 and an abandoned railroad trestle.
The river flows northeast into the city of Paterson, where it drops over the Great Falls of the Passaic. On the north end of Paterson, it turns abruptly south, flowing between Paterson and Clifton on the west and Hawthorne, Fair Lawn, Elmwood Park, Garfield on the east, next through the city of Clifton. At Elmwood Park it begins to form Dundee Lake, created by the Dundee Dam built in 1845. The river becomes navigable downstream of the Dundee Dam at the Eighth Street/Locust Ave Bridge in Wallington where the dredged Wallington Reach channel begins. Proceeding beyond the Wallington Reach, the river remains navigable via a series of maintained channels to its final destination, Newark Bay. It passes Passaic, Clifton again, then Nutley and Belleville on the west; it flows past Rutherford, Lyndhurst, and North Arlington to the east.

In its lowest reaches, it flows along the northeast portion of the city of Newark on the west, passing Kearny, East Newark, and Harrison on the eastern bank. Near downtown Newark it makes an abrupt easterly bend, then south around Ironbound, joining the Hackensack River at the northern end of Newark Bay, a back bay of New York Harbor.

==History==

===Geology===
The Passaic River formed as a result of drainage from a massive proglacial lake that formed in North Jersey at the end of the last ice age, approximately 13,000 years ago. That prehistoric lake is now known as Glacial Lake Passaic and was centered in the present lowland swamps of Morris County, forming because of a blockage of the normal drainage path. Eventually, the lake level rose high enough that the water flowed out of a new outlet. The Passaic River found a new path to the ocean via the Millington Gorge and the Paterson Falls as the glacier that covered the area retreated northward and the lake drained. As a result, the river as we now know it was born.

===Native American weirs===
Prior to European colonialization along the Passaic in the late 17th century, the valley was the territory of the Lenape groups now known as the Acquackanonk and Hackensack, who used the river for fishing. To that end they built weirs, or overflow dams, to create pools and where the fish could be trapped. Many of these archeological sites are still present and, in some cases, in good condition.

===Economic development===
The river was highly significant in the early industrial development of New Jersey. It provided a navigable route connected by canals to the Delaware River starting in the late 18th century. It also was an early source of hydropower at the Great Falls of the Passaic in Paterson, resulting in the early emergence of the area as the center of industrial mills.

===Pollution===
Much of the lower river suffered severe pollution during the 19th and 20th centuries because of industrial waste discharges to the river and improper waste disposal practices on adjacent land. Although the health of the river has improved due to implementation of the 1972 Clean Water Act and other environmental legislation, and the decline of industry along the river, it still suffers from substantial degradation of water quality. The sediment at the mouth of the river near Newark Bay remains contaminated by pollutants such as dioxin. The dioxin was generated principally by the Diamond Shamrock Chemical Plant in Newark, as a waste product resulting from the production of the Agent Orange defoliation chemical used during the Vietnam War. The cleanup of the dioxin contamination on the bottom of the river is the subject of a major environmental lawsuit regarding the responsibility for the cleanup. In 2008, the EPA reached a settlement with Occidental Chemical Corporation and Tierra Solutions Inc. to clean a portion of the polluted river. A New Jersey Superior Court judge, ruling in July and September 2011, stated that Occidental and Maxus Exergy Corporation (a subsidiary of YPF) are liable for remediation in other portions of the river. In 2013, several corporate defendants agreed to pay the State of New Jersey $130 million for ecological damages related to Passaic River pollution. However, it is unclear as to whether the state will actually use this money for clean-up efforts.

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) issued notices in 2009 banning commercial fishing and advising the general public that fish caught in the tidal Passaic River (from Dundee Dam to the mouth at Newark Bay) should not be eaten. The fish consumption advisories remain in effect as of 2020.

In April 2014 EPA announced a $1.7 billion plan to remove of toxic mud from the bottom of lower of the river. It is considered one of the most polluted stretches of water in the nation and one of the biggest clean-ups project ever undertaken.

===Economic decline and resurgence===
The decline of manufacturing on the lower river has left a post-industrial landscape of abandoned and disused factories and other facilities. In particular, the stretch of the river along downtown Newark came to be regarded in the latter decades of the 20th century as particularly wretched. Starting in the 1990s, the lower river became the subject of federal and state urban restoration efforts, which have resulted in new construction along the riverfront, the city of Newark has constructed a riverfront walk from the Jackson Street Bridge to the Bridge Street Bridge. It is landscaped with trees, plants, flowers, and benches. Construction of office buildings has also taken place, including a regional headquarters building for the FBI.

While there has been a decline in the industrial use of the river, recreational use has increased since the early 1990s. There has been a long tradition of high school rowing by Kearny (since 1968), Belleville (1942, New Jersey&#x27;s first public high school crew team), and Nutley High Schools and, in 1990, the historic Nereid Boat Club (founded in 1868) was revived, broadening participation in the sport of rowing on the Passaic River. In 1999, the Passaic River Rowing Association became the second rowing club along the banks of the Lower Passaic River. Today, the rowing community is very active through the two Rowing Clubs (Nereid Boat Club and Passaic River Rowing Association) and ten high school crews that include Kearny, Belleville, Nutley, Don Bosco Prep, St. Peter&#x27;s Preparatory School, Montclair, Ridgewood, Teaneck, Westfield, North Arlington (2012-13 School Year), and St. Benedict&#x27;s Prep. The Passaic River is also host to the annual Head of the Passaic Regatta that has been held since 2001. 

Commercial transport on the Lower Passaic hasn&#x27;t entirely died. On December 3, 2008, a barge was loaded with biodiesel at the former W.A.S. Terminals in Newark, now Passaic River Terminals. Innovation Fuels LLC, one of the terminal&#x27;s tenants, has plans to continue to sell two barge loads a month of biodiesel to customers in Europe. This is the first commercial barge in the river in over 15 years. Although they experienced some delays with the County drawbridges that have been neglected for years and had some problems with shoaling due to the lack of maintenance dredging, they remain undeterred and the Passaic River represents the cheapest and most efficient method to ship their cargo to its customers.
==Vantage points==

The Passaic River can be accessed via a number of county parks. One notable park is Stanley Park between Summit and Chatham. Other parks along the river are located in Passaic County. As part of the ongoing Newark revitalization effort by the city government, parkland is proposed along the banks of the river.

The Passaic River generally is free of industrialization until it reaches the Summit and Chatham border. The upper portion of the river, above Summit and Chatham, are more natural in appearance and the river has more of a young river character in places. The middle portion of the river flows through natural marshlands and forested areas in Essex County, which are generally inaccessible, and then through heavily populated areas of Passaic County where it is accessible via parallel roads and parks. Lower portions of the river, south of Paterson are wider, more industrialized, and more mature in nature. Kearny Riverbank Park and Riverbank Park in Newark both provide waterfront access. The banks of the lower few miles (kilometers) of the river mainly are industrialized.

==Flooding problems==

The Passaic River is known for chronic flooding problems during periods of heavy rainfall or snow-melt, especially where the Pompton River joins the Passaic River on the border of Fairfield, Lincoln Park, and Wayne. The two rivers form a sizable flood plain in this area. Building has been allowed in the flood plain and during extreme weather events that occur on a fairly regular basis, homes and businesses in the flood plain become flooded. A plan has been proposed to build a massive structure, the Passaic River Flood Tunnel, to divert the periodic floodwaters southeasterly into Newark Bay, thus relieving these flooding problems upstream. Some residents have accepted buy-outs from the federal government while the concept of constructing a flood tunnel is debated, however, many residents still live within the flood plain and flooding appears to be growing worse as the land in the Passaic River basin continues to be developed.

===Little Falls River Gauge===
The Little Falls River Gauge along the Passaic River is located just south of the junction with the Pompton River, in an area that frequently floods. Flood stage is at this location.

===Floods===
On February 28, 1902, there was severe flooding of the river. On October 10, 1903, one of the worst floods on record happened. The water crest was and severe flooding of Little Falls, Paterson, as well as many other areas along the river. Other high crests were: on April 7, 1984; on April 18, 2007; and on March 16, 2010. On April 23, 2010, Governor Chris Christie issued an order creating the &quot;Passaic River Basin Flood Advisory Commission&quot;. In January 2011 a report was issued, mentioning the 2010 flood, and the result was for municipalities to change their master plans and change local flood damage prevention ordinances, which would include such things as elevating structures, and to stop expansion into flood zones. The areas considered prone to continual flooding are Acid Brook, Buttermilk Falls, Haycock Brook, Mahwah River, Masonicus Brook, Packanack Brook, Pequannock River, Plog Brook, Pompton River, Ramapo River, Third River, Wanaque River, and Wolf Creek. On August 30, 2011 there was another flood with a crest. The flood control issue had been considered as far back as 1870 and there were studies in 1939, 1948, 1962, 1969, 1972, 1973, 1987, and 1995 with minimum results from report suggestions.

==In the arts and literature==
A poem about the river was written by John Alleyne Macnab in 1890, and put to music by Fountains of Wayne.

The river hosted a group of Inuit plantation workers on the run in the 2004 short story, &quot;From Out of the River&quot;, by beat laureate Spencer Hash.

The river, and especially its Great Falls, plays a large part in William Carlos Williams&#x27;s epic poem Paterson.

From 2006 to 2008, writer Wheeler Antabanez traveled the Passaic River and its shores, chronicling his adventures in a special issue of &quot;Weird NJ&quot; magazine. &quot;Nightshade on the Passaic&quot; was released as a special issue of the magazine and quickly became its best-selling issue, confirming readers&#x27; interest in stories involving the Passaic River. Antabanez intentionally did not want the special issue to be a history lesson of New Jersey or the river but instead wanted it to be a Huckleberry Finn-style adventure story.

In his canoe, Nightshade, Antabanez visits the most dangerous parts of the Passaic, along with several of the abandoned buildings and factories that relied on the Passaic years ago. In addition to the river and the decaying structures that surround it, he also researched murders that involved the Passaic River, including the horrific case of Jonathan Zarate, who attempted to dump the mutilated body of his 16-year-old neighbor in the river but was thwarted by a police officer who happened to pass by at the time.

<doc id="579243" wikidata="Q59676" url="?curid=579243" title="Benguela Current">
<text>The Benguela Current is the broad, northward flowing ocean current that forms the eastern portion of the South Atlantic Ocean gyre. The current extends from roughly Cape Point in the south, to the position of the Angola-Benguela Front in the north, at around 16°S. The current is driven by the prevailing south easterly trade winds. Inshore of the Benguela Current proper, the south easterly winds drive coastal upwelling, forming the Benguela Upwelling System. The cold, nutrient rich waters that upwell from around depth in turn fuel high rates of phytoplankton growth, and sustain the productive Benguela ecosystem.

==Boundaries==
Source waters for the Benguela include cold upwelled waters from the depths of the Atlantic Ocean close inshore, joined further off-shore by nutrient poor water that has crossed the Southern Atlantic from South America as part of South Atlantic Gyre. Eddies from the warm South Indian Ocean Agulhas current along South Africa&#x27;s east coast come round the Cape of Good Hope from time to time to join the Benguela current. The Benguela current is 200 to 300 km wide and widens further as it flows north and northwest. Its western, seaward edge is well-defined, with many temporary and seasonal eddies and meanders. There is however a well-defined thermal front between the waters associated with the Benguela Upwelling System and those of the eastward flowing Atlantic currents which are not deflected northward by the African continent.

The icy Benguela and the warm, south-flowing Agulhas current do not meet off the Cape of Good Hope (see diagram on the right, above), but there is a body of water off the South African south coast, east and particularly west of Cape Agulhas that consists of eddies from both currents, so that offshore water temperatures along the south coast of Africa vary chaotically.

==Upwelling and primary production==
Northward winds along the coast result in Ekman transport offshore and upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water to the euphotic zone. The intensity of the upwelling event is determined by wind strength. Variations in wind strength result in pulses of upwelling, which propagate to the south along the coast with speeds of 5 to 8 m/s. The pulses are similar to a Kelvin wave, except on a scale of 30 to 60 km instead of 1000 km, and can propagate around the Cape depending on wind systems.

Pulses of upwelling induce biological production. In the Benguela system, phytoplankton growth requires a period of upwelling followed by a period of stratification and relatively calm waters. The phytoplankton bloom usually lags the upwelling event by 1 to 4 days and blooms for 4 to 10 days. In order for zooplankton to have a continuous food supply, the phytoplankton blooms must not occur too far apart. Pulses of upwelling in the Benguela system regularly have a duration of 10 days, an optimal period for biological production. It is estimated that the annual biomass production in the Benguela system is 4.7× gC/y, making the Benguela system 30 to 65 times more productive per unit area than the global ocean average.

While upwelling promotes abundant primary and secondary production in the upper parts of the water column and near the coast, deeper waters with limited oxygen exchange create hypoxic areas called oxygen minimum zones at the coastal shelf and upper coastal slope. The Benguela oxygen minimum zone starts around a depth of 100 m and is a few hundred meters thick. Bacteria that use sulphur rather than oxygen, called sulphur-reducing bacteria, reside in the oxygen minimum zone.

The most abundant fish in the Benguela system are &quot;Sardinops&quot; and &quot;Engraulis&quot;. The Southern African pilchard (&quot;S. s. ocellatus&quot;), was intensely fished in the 1950s and peaked in 1968 with landings over 1.3 million tons. Since then, fishery of the &quot;Sardinops&quot; has declined and fishery of the Southern African anchovy (&quot;Engraulis capensis&quot;) has taken over.

==Benguela Niño==
Similar to the Pacific El Niño, a thick slab of warm, nutrient-poor water enters the northern part of the Benguela upwelling system off the Namibia coast about once per decade. During the Benguela Niño, warm, salty waters from the Angola Current move southward, between 15°S and 25°S. This slab of warm salty water extends to offshore and to depth. Heavy rains, changes in fish abundance, and temporal proximity to the Pacific El Niño have been observed; however, the causes and effects of the Benguela Niño are not well understood. One research team has shown that the Benguela Niño is caused by winds in the west-central equatorial Atlantic Ocean that propagate as subsurface sea temperature anomalies to the African coast.
A recent study has demonstrated the importance of local winds in the development of the Benguela Niño off the coast of Namibia and Angola. This local process together with the remote signal from the equatorial regions form the basis of the formation mechanism in which both processes sometimes reinforce each other.

<doc id="579244" wikidata="Q431212" url="?curid=579244" title="Crested serpent eagle">
<text>The crested serpent eagle (Spilornis cheela) is a medium-sized bird of prey that is found in forested habitats across tropical Asia. Within its widespread range across the Indian Subcontinent, Southeast Asia and East Asia, there are considerable variations and some authorities prefer to treat several of its subspecies as completely separate species. In the past, several species including the Philippine serpent eagle (&quot;S. holospila&quot;), Andaman serpent eagle (&quot;S. elgini&quot;) and South Nicobar serpent eagle (&quot;S. klossi&quot;) were treated as subspecies of the Crested serpent eagle. All members within the species complex have a large looking head with long feathers on the back of the head giving them a maned and crested appearance. The face is bare and yellow joining up with the ceres while the powerful feet are unfeathered and heavily scaled. They fly over the forest canopy on broad wings and tail have wide white and black bars. They call often with a loud, piercing and familiar three or two-note call. They often feed on snakes, giving them their name and are placed along with the &quot;Circaetus&quot; snake-eagles in the subfamily Circaetinae.

==Description==
This medium-large, dark brown eagle is stocky, with rounded wings and a short tail. Its short black and white fan-shaped nuchal crest gives it a thick-necked appearance. The bare facial skin and feet are yellow. The underside is spotted with white and yellowish-brown. When perched the wing tips do not reach until the tail tip. In soaring flight, the broad and paddle-shaped wings are held in a shallow V. The tail and underside of the flight feathers are black with broad white bars. Young birds show a lot of white on the head. The tarsus is unfeathered and covered by hexagonal scales. The upper mandible does not have an overhanging festoon to the tip. 

===Size===
This species of serpent eagle manifests an unusual amount of size variation across its assorted subspecies. Total length of fully-grown crested serpent eagles can vary from and wingspan can vary from . The largest proportioned race appears to be the nominate, &quot;S. c. cheela&quot;, with a wing chord of in males and in females, tail lengths of and tarsus length of . In comparison, &quot;S. c. minimus&quot;, probably the smallest race, has a wing chord of in males and in females, tail lengths of around and tarsal length of around . Weights are more fitfully reported but are estimated to vary perhaps threefold between assorted races. In very small subspecies such as &quot;S. c. asturinus&quot; body masses were found to be in a male and in a female. In &quot;S. c. palawanesis&quot;, body mass was reported at in males and in females. Serpent eagles from Borneo, &quot;S. c. pallidus&quot;, may between . Mainland forms are typically larger but a weight of was cited for the fairly small mainland race, &quot;S. c. burmanicus&quot;. In the race &quot;S. c. hoya&quot;, weights were much higher, averaging ; meanwhile, in the same race, 8 males averaged and 6 females averaged . In some cases, serpent eagles may attain estimated weights of approximately .

==Taxonomy==
The crested serpent eagle is placed along with the snake eagles of the genus &quot;Circaetus&quot; in the subfamily Circaetinae.

The nominate subspecies has a black throat while the peninsular Indian form has a brownish throat. There are clinal latitudinal variations, with size decreasing southward. The small islands taxa are generally smaller in size than the taxa from the Asian mainland/larger islands in a phenomenon termed as insular dwarfism.
Within its widespread range across tropical Asia, 21 subspecies have been proposed:

* &quot;S. c. batu&quot; from southern Sumatra and Batu, 
* &quot;S. c. bido&quot; from Java and Bali, 
* &quot;S. c. burmanicus&quot; in most of Indochina, 
* &quot;S. c. hoya&quot; from Taiwan, 
* &quot;S. c. malayensis&quot; of the Thai-Malay Peninsula and northern Sumatra, 
* &quot;S. c. melanotis&quot; in Peninsular India, 
* &quot;S. c. palawanensis&quot; from Palawan,
* &quot;S. c. pallidus&quot; from northern Borneo, 
* &quot;S. c. richmondi&quot; from southern Borneo, 
* &quot;S. c. ricketti&quot; in northern Vietnam and southern China,
* &quot;S. c. rutherfordi&quot; from Hainan, and 
* &quot;S. c. spilogaster&quot; of Sri Lanka. 
The remaining sub-species are all restricted to smaller islands: 
* &quot;S. c. abbotti&quot; (Simeulue serpent eagle) from Simeulue, 
* &quot;S. c. asturinus&quot; (Nias serpent eagle) from Nias, 
* &quot;S. c. baweanus&quot; (Bawean serpent eagle) of the Bawean, 
* &quot;S. c. davisoni&quot; in the Andamans, 
* &quot;S. c. minimus&quot; (Central Nicobar serpent eagle) from the central Nicobars,
* &quot;S. c. natunensis&quot; (Natuna serpent eagle) from Natuna, 
* &quot;S. c. perplexus&quot; (Ryukyu serpent eagle) from Ryukyu, and 
* &quot;S. c. sipora&quot; (Mentawai serpent eagle) from Mentawai. 

The last seven (with English names in brackets) are sometimes treated as separate species. Although the crested serpent eagle remains widespread and fairly common overall, some of the taxa that are restricted to small islands are believed to have relatively small populations that likely are in the hundreds. 

The rarest is probably the Bawean serpent eagle with a declining population of about 26–37 pairs, which makes it critically endangered.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The crested serpent eagle is a reptile eater which hunts over forests, often close to wet grassland, for snakes and lizards. It has also been observed to prey on birds, amphibians, mammals, fishes, termites and large earthworms. It is found mainly over areas with thick vegetation both on the low hills and the plains. This species is a resident species, but in some parts of their range they are found only in summer.

The call is a distinctive &quot;Kluee-wip-wip&quot; with the first note being high and rising. They call a lot in the late mornings from their perches where they spend a lot of time and they rise on thermals in the mornings. In southern Taiwan, males have a larger home range than females. Males on average had a home range of 16.7 km2 while females used about 7 km2. When alarmed, they erect the crest and the head appears large and framed by the ruff. They will sometimes follow snakes on the ground. They roost in the interiors of trees with dense foliage. A radio-telemetric study of the species in Taiwan found that the birds spend 98% of the day perched and usually finding food in the morning hours. They appear to use a sit and wait foraging strategy.

The breeding season begins in late winter when they start courting and establishing territories. The eggs are laid in early summer. Old nests are often refurbished and reused in India but a study in Penang found them to build fresh nests each year. A study in India found that most nests were built along riverine trees. The nest is a large platform built high on a tree. Both birds in a pair build the nest but the female alone incubates. The male guards when the female forages. In central India, the &quot;Terminalia tomentosa&quot; is often used while &quot;Terminalia bellirica&quot; and &quot;Dalbergia latifolia&quot; was often used in southern India. In Penang, the nest trees were typically large and isolated from other trees with lot of room for the birds to fly in and out. The nests are lined with green leaves collected from nearby and are placed facing down on the nest floor. The usual clutch is one egg but two are sometimes laid and only a single chick is successfully raised in a season. When eggs are lost, a replacement is laid two to seven weeks later. The eggs hatch after about 41 days and the young fledge after about two months. Nests are defended by the parents.

Several species of endoparasitic nematodes have been recovered from the intestines of crested serpent eagles, including &quot;Madelinema angelae&quot;. Avian pox virus infections which cause warts on the face have been observed in a wild bird living in Taiwan. A number of ectoparasitic bird lice have been described from the species including &quot;Kurodaia cheelae&quot;. In Penang, it was found that cinereous tits (&quot;Parus cinereus ambiguus&quot;) tended to nest close to nesting crested serpent eagles, presumably due to safety from predators like crows that may be driven off by the eagles. They have also been found to visit the nests of the eagles to collect fur from the remains of dead mammal prey.

<doc id="579251" wikidata="Q2657594" url="?curid=579251" title="Kawanishi Aircraft Company">
<text>The was a Japanese aircraft manufacturer active during World War II.

==History==
The company was founded as Kawanishi Engineering Works in 1920 in Hyōgo Prefecture as an outgrowth of the Kawanishi conglomerate, which had been funding the Nakajima Aircraft Company. Kawanishi built its first aircraft, the Kawanishi K-1 Mail-carrying Aircraft in 1921, and set up an airline, &quot;Nippon Koku K.K.&quot; (Japan Aviation Co. Ltd) in 1923, designing and building several aircraft for the airline&#x27;s use. It was forced by the Japanese government to shut down &quot;Nippon Koku&quot; in 1929, however, with its routes being transferred to the government-owned &quot;Nippon Koku Yuso K.K.&quot; (Japan Air Transport Co. Ltd.) Kawanishi then split off the former Kawanishi Engineering Works, forming &quot;Kawanishi Kokuki KK&quot; in 1928, taking all of the Kawanishi Engineering Works&#x27; assets.

While Kawanishi was best known for its seaplanes, such as the Kawanishi H6K and H8K flying boats, its N1K-J land-based fighter -derived from their Kawanishi N1K1 floatplane fighter- was considered one of the best in the war. After Japan&#x27;s defeat, the company was reborn as Shin Meiwa Industries (later ShinMaywa), and continued to create flying boats such as the PS-1 and US-2.

<doc id="579254" wikidata="Q928750" url="?curid=579254" title="Duane Arnold Energy Center">
<text>The Duane Arnold Energy Center (DAEC) was Iowa&#x27;s only nuclear power plant. It is located on a site on the west bank of the Cedar River, north-northeast of Palo, Iowa, USA, or northwest of Cedar Rapids.

DAEC entered operation in February 1975. On August 10, 2020, the plant cooling towers were damaged during a derecho, and repairs were deemed uneconomical, as the plant had already been scheduled for decommissioning in October 2020.

The operator and majority owner is NextEra Energy Resources (70%). The Central Iowa Power Cooperative owns 20% and the Corn Belt Power Cooperative owns 10%.
== Electricity Production ==
During last full year of operation in 2019, Duane Arnold generated 5,235 GWh of electricity. 
==History==
In the late 1960s, Iowa Electric Light &amp; Power Co. (now Alliant Energy – West), Central Iowa Power Cooperative and Corn Belt Power Cooperative applied for a nuclear plant license with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). On June 17, 1970 a construction permit was granted and work began. The original plan was to complete construction in 40 months at an estimated cost of $250 million.

The energy center was named after Duane Arnold who grew up in Sanborn, Iowa. Arnold was educated at Grinnell College and went to work for Iowa Electric Light and Power Company in 1946. At the time of his death in 1983, at the age of 65, he was chairman of the board and CEO of that company, marrying along the way the daughter, Henrietta, of the previous chairman Sutherland Dows. Arnold was very committed to nuclear energy despite the controversy surrounding that source of energy, and oversaw the construction and opening in 1974 of the plant that bears his name. “In my opinion, nuclear power is the most beneficial method of anything we could possibly do to provide energy to our customers in the future,” Mr. Arnold stated in a 1979 interview with the Des Moines Register, about a month after the Three Mile Island accident. 

Construction was completed and the reactor reached initial criticality on March 23, 1974. The cost was $50 million over budget. Commercial operations began on February 1, 1975. The plant was licensed for 1,658 MWt. However, power operations were restricted to 1593MWt (about 535 MWe) until plant modifications were completed in 1985 to utilize the full licensed capacity.

In May 2000, the NRC granted a license transfer of the DAEC to Nuclear Management Company LLC (NMC). Ownership of the plant remained with Alliant, Central Iowa Power Cooperative and Corn Belt Power Cooperative, but NMC would manage the operation of the plant.

In 2001, a power uprate was approved by the NRC to 1,912 MWt. Scheduled outages since that time have added modifications to the plant that have allowed this power level to be sustained without restrictions or challenges to nuclear or industrial safety.

On January 27, 2006, FPL Energy (a subsidiary of FPL Group) closed the sale transaction of 70 percent ownership from Alliant Energy-Interstate Power and Light. FPL Energy (now NextEra Energy Resources) also took control of the operations of the plant from NMC.

DAEC remained online during the 2008 Iowa Flood, when other power plants along the Cedar River shut down. Practice drills for radiological emergencies from the plant allowed the Linn County Emergency Management Agency to better respond to the flooding.

In December 2010, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted Duane Arnold a 20-year extension license lasting until 2034, taking the plant beyond the life of its original 40-year operating permit.

In January 2018, NextEra Energy announced that it was unlikely that DAEC would operate beyond 2025. The plant was given a 20-year license extension to 2034 but considered closing after Alliant Energy, which contracts for 70% of the plant&#x27;s electricity, announced it would instead be buying electricity generated by wind and natural gas. In July 2018 the expected closure date was amended to October 2020.
In July 2018, NextEra and Alliant Energy agreed to shorten their power purchase agreement by five years in return for a $110 million buyout payment from Alliant, making the expected closure date 2020.

The unit permanently ceased making power on 10 August 2020, due to storm damage from the August 2020 Midwest derecho. An NRC report of the incident stated that &quot;the vacuum drawn in secondary containment by the standby gas treatment system was slightly below the technical specification (TS) limit&quot;, indicating that the secondary containment system might not have been fully effective had it been challenged. Thus the incident was considered by nuclear safety experts to be &quot;a close call&quot;.

 As of September 2024, John Ketchum, NextEra’s chief executive officer said that, under certain conditions, they’re willing to revive the plant, as several data centers were interested.

==Plant equipment==
DAEC has a single GE BWR-4 reactor with a Mark I containment. Twenty-four mechanical draft cooling towers utilized water from the Cedar River as a heat sink. Facilities exist to process all contaminated water onsite and the DAEC operates with a &quot;zero release&quot; policy to not discharge any contaminated water back to the Cedar River. Facilities exist on site for dry storage of spent fuel with capacity for the entire life of the plant (including license renewal).

The site is scheduled for a 200 MW label capacity solar park with a 75 MW / 300 MWh (4-hour) battery by 2024. Lazard estimates that the wholesale price of replacement electricity will be $0.04/kWh, but a more realistic estimate that takes account of the 11.4% cost of capital reported by NextEra puts the wholesale price at $0.21/kWh, not including operating and decommissioning costs.

==Known problems==
The Mark I containment was undersized in the original design; the Nuclear Regulatory Commission&#x27;s Harold Denton estimated a 90% probability of explosive failure if the pressure containment system were ever needed in a severe accident. This design flaw may have been the reason that the tsunami in 2011 led to explosions and fire in Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.

==Accident analysis==
In 2010, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission estimated that the risk of an earthquake causing core damage to the reactor at Duane Arnold was 1 in 31,250 each year.

In 2013, in response to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ordered Duane Arnold &quot;to install a reliable hardened venting capability for pre-core damage and under severe accident conditions, including those involving a breach of the reactor vessel by molten core debris&quot; due to the similarity in reactor design.

==Community impact==
DAEC employed hundreds of people in the Cedar Rapids area. Some of these workers are represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, others by Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America.

Emergency warning towers are maintained by DAEC and provide a means for tornado warnings as well as plant emergencies. The Emergency Planning organization at DAEC works with local, county, and state officials to maintain an emergency plan. The emergency plan can be found in the front of area phonebooks. Drills are conducted on a regular basis in accordance with requirements from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

Tax revenues from DAEC amount to about 1% of the total revenues for Linn County, Iowa. Pleasant Creek Reservoir, a lake, was developed by Alliant Energy and the Iowa Conservation Commission to provide a recreation area and act as a source of cooling water during times of low flow in the Cedar River.

While the DAEC site covers , only a portion of that is used for power production. The remainder is leased to farmers for crop production or is left in its natural habitat.

In 2014, the Nuclear Energy Institute released a study showing the positive impact of DAEC on the economy and environment. Key findings are listed below.
* DAEC employs nearly 600 full-time workers that earn more than double the average pay of workers in Benton County and approximately 55 percent more than those in Linn County
* DAEC contributes $246 million of economic activity locally and contributes approximately $255 million to Iowa&#x27;s economy each year
* For every dollar DAEC spent, the Iowa economy produced $1.27
* DAEC produces more than 1,100 direct and secondary jobs
* DAEC&#x27;s operation helps avoid the emission of nearly 4 million tons of carbon dioxide annually, which is the equivalent of taking almost 800,000 cars off the road

==Surrounding population==
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.

The 2010 U.S. population within of Duane Arnold was 107,880, an increase of 8.2 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within was 658,634, an increase of 7.1 percent since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include Cedar Rapids (10 miles to city center).

== Proposed Restart ==
In early 2025, NextEra Energy Duane Arnold, LLC (NextEra), the licensee for DAEC expressed an interest in returning the plant to an operational status and resuming commercial operation.

To restart DAEC, NextEra would need to gain NRC approval to restore the licensing basis of the plant to an operational status, return plant components to a status that supports safe operation, and make any upgrades necessary to meet the proposed operational licensing basis.

NRC staff will carefully review the regulatory and licensing documents for the plant, inspect new and restored components necessary to operate safely, and continue ongoing oversight to ensure sufficiency of all plant systems and programs.

The NRC will engage in several pre-submittal interactions with the DAEC staff on various topics related to the potential for restart, and will continue to host public meetings related to the potential for the DAEC to resume power operations throughout the project.

<text>The crested goshawk (Lophospiza trivirgata) is a bird of prey in the family Accipitridae that is widely distributed in tropical Asia. It was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Accipiter&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The crested goshawk was formally described in 1824 by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck under the binomial name &quot;Falco trivirgatus&quot;. It was formerly placed in the very large genus &quot;Accipiter&quot;. When molecular phylogenetic studies found that &quot;Accipiter&quot; was polyphyletic, the genus was split to create monophyletic genera. As part of this reorganisation, the genus &quot;Lophospiza&quot; was resurrected to accommodate the crested goshawk and the closely related Sulawesi goshawk. The genus had originally been erected in 1844 by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek λοφος (&quot;lophos&quot;) meaning &quot;crest&quot; and σπιζιας (&quot;spizias&quot;) meaning &quot;hawk&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;trivirgata&quot; combines the Latin &quot;tri&quot; meaning &quot;three&quot; with &quot;virgatus &quot; meaning &quot;striped&quot;.

==Description==
This raptor has short broad wings and a long tail, both adaptations to manoeuvring through trees. It is 30–46 cm in length, with the female much larger than the male. The larger size and a short crest, clearly visible in profile, are the best distinctions from its relative, the besra (&quot;Tachyspiza virgata&quot;).

The male has a dark brown crown, grey head sides and black moustachial and throat stripes. The pale underparts are patterned with rufous streaks on the breast and bars on the belly. The larger female has a browner head and brown underpart streaks and bars. The juvenile has pale fringes to its head feathers, and the underpart background colour is buff rather than white.

The flight is a characteristic &quot;slow flap, slow flap, straight glide&quot;, similar to other &quot;Accipiter&quot; species such as the Eurasian goshawk (&quot;Astur gentilis&quot;).

==Range and ecology==

The crested goshawk breeds in southern Asia, from India and Sri Lanka to southern China, Indonesia, Taiwan, and the Philippines. It is primarily a lowland bird, and an all-year resident. Even in upland habitat it is resident in winter, for example in the Himalayas foothills of Bhutan or in Sal (&quot;Shorea robusta&quot;) forest in India&#x27;s Dehradun district. In these lands at the northern end of its range, it is generally very rare however. Essentially it is limited to tropical and warm subtropical areas.
In Malaysia and Singapore there is increasing evidence of this species adapting to life in urban centres.

Like its relatives, this secretive forest bird hunts birds, mammals and reptiles in woodland, relying on surprise as it flies from a perch to catch its prey unaware. It builds a stick nest in a tree and lays two or three eggs.

The ischnoceran louse &quot;Degeeriella storeri&quot; is a parasite of this bird; it is not yet known from any other host species. On the other hand, &quot;Kurodaia fulvofasciata&quot;, an amblyceran louse parasitizing the crested goshawk, is widely found on birds of prey throughout the Holarctic.

In Hong Kong, &quot;A. trivirgatus&quot; is a protected species under Wild Animals Protection Ordinance Cap 170. It can be found in Kam Shan Country Park.
