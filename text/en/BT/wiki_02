<text>Skye and Lochalsh () was a local government district, created in 1975 as one of eight districts within the Highland region in Scotland. It include the Isle of Skye and the Lochalsh area on the mainland. The main offices of the council were in Portree, on the Isle of Skye. The district was abolished in 1996 when Highland was made a single-tier council area.

==History==
The district was created in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which abolished Scotland&#x27;s counties, burghs and landward districts and replaced them with a two-tier system of regions and districts. The new district covered two former districts: the Skye district from Inverness-shire (covering the Isle of Skye and neighbouring Inner Hebridean islands) and the South West district from Ross and Cromarty (covering the parishes of Lochalsh, Kintail and Glenshiel).

Skye and Lochalsh District Council was a district-level authority, with regional-level functions provided by the Highland Regional Council, based in Inverness.

The districts and regions created in 1975 were abolished in 1996, under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 and replaced with single-tier council areas. The Highland region became one of the new council areas.

==Political control==
The first election to the district council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the district and its council formally came into being on 16 May 1975. Throughout the council&#x27;s existence a majority of the seats were held by independents:
==Premises==

In 1976, shortly after the council&#x27;s creation, it bought the former drill hall on Park Lane in Portree to serve as its headquarters. The converted building was given the Scots Gaelic name of &quot;Tigh-na-Sgire&quot; (&quot;the District House&quot;). After the district council&#x27;s abolition in 1996 the building passed to the Highland Council, who continue to use it as an area office. Skye and Lochalsh District Council also had an area office in Kyle of Lochalsh.

==Coat of arms==

The Skye and Lochalsh District Council coat of arms, granted by Lord Lyon King of Arms in 1987, featured a wavy blue &quot;fess&quot; across the centre of the shield for the Kyle of Lochalsh. Above this were emblems for the three main historic families of the Isle of Skye (Macleod of Macleod, Macdonald of Sleat and Mackinnon) and below it a stag&#x27;s head from the arms of Mackenzie of Kintail for the Lochalsh area. The gold coronet above the arms was a special pattern reserved for the arms of Scottish district councils, and was topped by thistle-heads.

<doc id="562205" wikidata="Q92803" url="?curid=562205" title="Grady Booch">
<text>Grady Booch (born February 27, 1955) is an American software engineer, best known for developing the Unified Modeling Language (UML) with Ivar Jacobson and James Rumbaugh. He is recognized internationally for his innovative work in software architecture, software engineering, and collaborative development environments.

==Education==
Booch earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1977 from the United States Air Force Academy and a master&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering in 1979 from the University of California, Santa Barbara.

==Career and research==
Booch worked at Vandenberg Air Force Base after he graduated. He started as a project engineer and later managed ground-support missions for the space shuttle and other projects. After he gained his master&#x27;s degree he became an instructor at the Air Force Academy.

Booch served as Chief Scientist of Rational Software Corporation from its founding in 1981 through its acquisition by IBM in 2003, where he continued to work until March 2008. After this he became Chief Scientist, Software Engineering in IBM Research and series editor for Benjamin Cummings.

Booch has devoted his life&#x27;s work to improving the art and the science of software development. In the 1980s, he wrote one of the more popular books on programming in Ada. He is best known for developing the Unified Modeling Language with Ivar Jacobson and James Rumbaugh in the 1990s.

===IBM 1130===
Booch got his first exposure to programming on an IBM 1130.

... I pounded the doors at the local IBM sales office until a salesman took pity on me. After we chatted for a while, he handed me a Fortran [manual]. I&#x27;m sure he gave it to me thinking, &quot;I&#x27;ll never hear from this kid again.&quot; I returned the following week saying, &quot;This is really cool. I&#x27;ve read the whole thing and have written a small program. Where can I find a computer?&quot; The fellow, to my delight, found me programming time on an IBM 1130 on weekends and late-evening hours. That was my first programming experience, and I must thank that anonymous IBM salesman for launching my career. Thank you, IBM.

===Booch method===
Booch developed the &#x27;Booch method&#x27; of software development, which he presents in his 1991/94 book, &quot;Object Oriented Analysis and Design With Applications&quot;. The method was authored by Booch when he was working for Rational Software (acquired by IBM), published in 1992 and revised in 1994.

The method is composed of an object modeling language, an iterative object-oriented development process, and a set of recommended practices. The recommended practices include adding more classes to simplify complex code. The methodology was widely used in software engineering for object-oriented analysis and design and benefited from ample documentation and support tools.

The Booch notation is characterized by cloud shapes to represent classes and distinguishes the following diagrams:
The process is organized around a macro and a micro process.

The macro process identifies the following activities cycle: 
* Conceptualization : establish core requirements
* Analysis : develop a model of the desired behavior
* Design : create an architecture 
* Evolution: for the implementation
* Maintenance : for evolution after the delivery

The micro process is applied to new classes, structures or behaviors that emerge during the macro process. It is made of the following cycle: 
* Identification of classes and objects
* Identification of their semantics 
* Identification of their relationships
* Specification of their interfaces and implementation

The notation aspect of the Booch method has now been superseded by the Unified Modeling Language (UML), which features graphical elements from the Booch method along with elements from the object-modeling technique (OMT) and object-oriented software engineering (OOSE).

Methodological aspects of the Booch method have been incorporated into several methodologies and processes, the primary such methodology being the Rational Unified Process (RUP).

===Design patterns===
Booch is also an advocate of design patterns. For instance, he wrote the foreword to &quot;Design Patterns&quot;, an early and highly influential book in the field.

===IBM Research - Almaden===
He now is part of IBM Research - Almaden, serving as Chief Scientist for Software Engineering, where he continues his work on the &quot;Handbook of Software Architecture&quot; and also leads several long-term projects in software engineering. Grady has served as architect and architectural mentor for numerous complex software-intensive systems around the world.

===Publications===
Grady Booch published several articles and books. A selection:

*&quot;Software Engineering with Ada&quot;.
*&quot;Object Solutions: Managing the Object-Oriented Project&quot;.
*&quot;The Unified Software Development Process&quot;. With Ivar Jacobson and James Rumbaugh.
*&quot;The Complete UML Training Course&quot;. With James Rumbaugh and Ivar Jacobson.
*&quot;The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual, Second Edition&quot;. With James Rumbaugh and Ivar Jacobson.
*&quot;The Unified Modeling Language User Guide, Second Edition&quot;. With James Rumbaugh and Ivar Jacobson.
*&quot;Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications&quot;.
==Awards and honors==

In 1995, Booch was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. He was named an IBM Fellow in 2003, soon after his entry into IBM, and assumed his current role on March 18, 2008. He was recognized as an IEEE Fellow in 2010. In 2012, Booch was awarded the Lovelace Medal for 2012 by the British Computer Society and gave the 2013 Lovelace Lecture. He gave the Turing Lecture in 2007. He was awarded the IEEE Computer Society Computer Pioneer award in 2016 for his pioneering work in Object Modeling that led to the creation of the Unified Modeling Language (UML).

<doc id="562206" wikidata="Q184841" url="?curid=562206" title="Marie Fredriksson">
<text>Gun-Marie Fredriksson (; 30 May 1958 – 9 December 2019) was a Swedish singer, songwriter, pianist, and lead vocalist of pop-rock duo Roxette, which she formed in 1986 with Per Gessle. The duo achieved international success in the late 1980s and early 1990s with their albums &quot;Look Sharp!&quot; (1988) and &quot;Joyride&quot; (1991), and had multiple hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, including four number ones.

Fredriksson had a successful career in her native country prior to forming Roxette. She was a member of punk group Strul, a band which created their own music festival in 1979. Strul&#x27;s dissolution led to the creation of her next project, the short-lived MaMas Barn, after which she began releasing solo work. Her first album, &quot;Het vind&quot;, was issued in 1984, followed by &quot;Den sjunde vågen&quot; in 1986 and &quot;... Efter stormen&quot; in 1987. Roxette&#x27;s international breakthrough coincided with a period of inactivity for Fredriksson as a solo artist, punctuated only by the release of the non-album single &quot;Sparvöga&quot; in 1989. Subsequent solo albums included &quot;Den ständiga resan&quot; (1992) and &quot;I en tid som vår&quot; (1996).

In 2002, after fainting at home, Fredriksson was diagnosed with a brain tumour. During her rehabilitation, she continued to record music as a solo artist, resulting in &quot;The Change&quot; in 2004 and &quot;Min bäste vän&quot; in 2006, as well as the non-album single &quot;Där du andas&quot; in 2008—her first and only solo number one single in Sweden. She and Gessle later reunited to record more albums as Roxette, and the pair embarked on a worldwide concert tour. She also continued to record as a solo artist in her native Sweden, releasing &quot;Nu!&quot; in 2013. Fredriksson died on 9 December 2019 as a result of health issues stemming from her brain tumour.

==Early life==
Gun-Marie Fredriksson was born on 30 May 1958 outside the small Swedish village of Össjö. She was the youngest of five children born of Charles Gösta Fredriksson (1914–1981) and Inez Dagmar Fredriksson (née Hoffert, 1922–1998). When she was four years old, her parents sold their farm and relocated to Östra Ljungby, where Gösta took a job as a postman and Inez became a factory worker. Three years later, her oldest sister Anna-Lisa was involved in a fatal traffic collision; her car was crushed by a tanker truck while she was travelling to purchase a dress for her engagement party. Marie explained: &quot;She was 20 – and I can barely remember her today. But I remember the grief, how the family was torn apart. Completely. After that I had to fend for myself. I was only seven years old.&quot;

With both parents in full-time employment but unable to afford child care, Marie and her underage siblings would often be left unaccompanied at home while their parents worked. It was during this period, with the help of siblings and friends, that she learned how to sing, read notation and play musical instruments. She also credited her pastor with encouraging her love of music, and said that she had been performing &quot;ever since I was little and me and my sister Tina went to Sunday school. We had a wonderful pastor in Östra Ljungby. I&#x27;ve got really bright, lovely memories of that place, even when my big sister died. I loved all the songs. It was such a source of freedom for me… for both of us.&quot;

Her interest in music continued to grow throughout her teens, as she discovered artists such as The Beatles, Joni Mitchell, Jimi Hendrix and Deep Purple. She enrolled in a music school in the Svalöv Municipality at the age of seventeen, where she befriended students from the theatre department by composing music for their amateur plays. Since no other vocalist in the school could emulate Fredriksson&#x27;s vocal range, she joined the cast of a musical she co-wrote. This musical toured throughout Sweden, with its run culminating in a performance in Stockholm for Prime Minister Olof Palme.

==Career==
===1978–1984: Early work===
After graduating from music school in 1977, Fredriksson moved to Halmstad, where she worked in theatre before becoming involved in the local indie music scene. She formed punk group Strul (English: Hassle) in 1978 with then-boyfriend Stefan Dernbrant—the band consisted of an extensive and fractious lineup of musicians, the majority of whom would leave after a single performance. Strul established their own independent music festival in 1979, Strulfestivalen, which was financially lucrative for the band. The festival was held each summer for three years, until 1981. Dernbrant exited the group in December 1980 when he and Fredriksson ended their relationship. Due to the success of the festival, Fredriksson opted to continue performing under the Strul name alongside the band&#x27;s other longest-serving member, guitarist Martin Sternhufvud. The group&#x27;s popularity increased substantially in 1981, culminating in several performances on Swedish music television programmes. This exposure led to Strul signing with independent record label Bastun, which released their first and only single in June, the double A-side &quot;Ki-I-Ai-Oo&quot; / &quot;Strul igen&quot;. The release was timed to coincide with the 1981 version of Strulfestivalen, which would be the last; three months later, the group permanently disbanded following a &quot;disastrous&quot; performance at the Pop Around the Clock festival, which was broadcast nationally on Swedish radio.

Following Strul&#x27;s breakup, Fredriksson and Sternhufvud formed a new band, MaMas Barn (English: MaMas Children). The two were the only permanent members, with Sternhufvud moving to vocals and Fredriksson to keyboards. The name was created by combining the first two letters of both members&#x27; given name. The duo regularly shared a rehearsal space with Gyllene Tider - a successful Swedish band fronted by Per Gessle - leading to that band&#x27;s bassist and drummer – Anders Herrlin and Mickael &quot;Syd&quot; Andersson, respectively – joining MaMas Barn. This close relationship between the two bands resulted in Fredriksson performing vocals on Gyllene Tider&#x27;s 1981 song &quot;Ingenting av vad du behöver&quot; (English: &quot;Nothing of What You Need&quot;). The following year, MaMas Barn signed with CBS Records International before their recording contract was sold to WEA International, which financed the recording of their only album, &quot;Barn som barn&quot; (English: &quot;Children as Children&quot;). The album was produced by ABBA guitarist Finn Sjöberg and eventually released in November 1982. Although it was a critical success, the record struggled commercially, selling approximately 1,000 copies. The group disbanded shortly after.
Believing Fredriksson to be &quot;too talented to be hiding behind keyboards&quot;, Gessle invited her to audition for Gyllene Tider&#x27;s producer Lars-Göran &quot;Lasse&quot; Lindbom. Impressed with her voice, Lindbom offered Fredriksson a contract as a solo artist on EMI Sweden, although she initially refused the deal, saying she was &quot;too nervous&quot; and &quot;lacked the confidence&quot; to be a solo artist. She performed duet vocals on &quot;Så nära nu&quot; (English: &quot;So Near Now&quot;), the lead single from the Lasse Lindbom Band&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;Romantisk Blackout&quot;. The album was successful in Sweden, and she joined Lindbom&#x27;s band as a featured vocalist for an extensive tour of the country. Following its completion in the autumn of 1983, Fredriksson recorded backing vocals for Gyllene Tider&#x27;s debut English album &quot;The Heartland Café&quot;, released in Sweden under the band&#x27;s original name, and in EP format in North America under the name Roxette—derived from the Dr. Feelgood song of the same name.

===1984–1989: Solo work and Roxette===
On Gessle&#x27;s insistence, Fredriksson agreed to embark on a solo career in late 1983, recording her debut album from December 1983 to June 1984, with Lindbom as co-writer and producer. &quot;Ännu doftar kärlek&quot; (English: &quot;Still the Scent of Love&quot;) was issued as her debut single in May 1984, becoming a top twenty hit on Sverigetopplistan, Sweden&#x27;s national record chart. Her debut album, &quot;Het vind&quot; (English: &quot;Hot Wind&quot;), was released in September, and also peaked within the Sverigetopplistan top twenty. The album was promoted by a three-month double bill concert tour, featuring Fredriksson performing as a solo artist alongside Lindbom&#x27;s eponymous band. The title track was issued as the second and final single in October, b/w a Swedish version of Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s &quot;All Through the Night&quot;, retitled &quot;Natt efter natt&quot; (English: &quot;Night After Night&quot;).

Her first solo tour took place from March to June 1985, after which she performed vocals for Spännande Ostar (English: Exciting Cheeses). This cover band appeared on several Swedish television programmes, and consisted of Fredriksson and Lindbom performing alongside Per Gessle and Mats Persson. The same year, Fredriksson and Lindbom travelled to the Canary Islands to write songs for her second solo album. &quot;Den sjunde vågen&quot; (English: &quot;The Seventh Wave&quot;) was released in February 1986 and peaked at number six on Sverigetopplistan, selling over 90,000 copies. &quot;Den bästa dagen&quot; (English: &quot;The Best Day&quot;) and &quot;Silver i din hand&quot; (English: &quot;Silver in Your Hand&quot;) were issued as singles, while the title track and &quot;Mot okända hav&quot; (English: &quot;Toward Unknown Seas&quot;) were top ten hits on Svensktoppen, Sweden&#x27;s airplay-based chart. She won the 1986 Rockbjörnen award for Best Swedish Female, and embarked on her second tour as a solo artist.
While Fredriksson had established herself as a prominent soloist, Gessle&#x27;s solo work struggled to replicate the success of Gyllene Tider; his second studio album &quot;Scener&quot; (1985) sold less than 20,000 copies, a significant drop from the 400,000 copies sold by &quot;Moderna tider&quot; four years earlier. EMI Sweden&#x27;s managing director, Rolf Nygren, suggested Gessle translate one of his Swedish compositions to English and record it as a duet with Fredriksson. The resulting song, &quot;Neverending Love&quot;, was issued under the band name Roxette—the name Gyllene Tider had used to release &quot;The Heartland Café&quot; in North America in 1984. The track peaked at number three on the Swedish Singles Chart, and was one of the most popular songs on Swedish radio that year. Their debut album, &quot;Pearls of Passion&quot;, was a major success upon release in October 1986, peaking at number two and eventually selling over 200,000 copies, but it failed to chart internationally. Roxette embarked on their first tour in the summer of 1987, &quot;Rock runt riket&quot; (&quot;Rock Around the Kingdom&quot;), a 15-date co-headlining tour with Eva Dahlgren and Ratata.

Fredriksson&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;... Efter stormen&quot; (English: &quot;After the Storm&quot;), was issued in October 1987. It peaked at number one and sold over 50,000 copies within a month of release, and was certified platinum by the Swedish Recording Industry Association for shipments in excess of 100,000 units. Both the title track and &quot;Bara för en dag&quot; (English: &quot;Just for a Day&quot;) were top ten hits on Svensktoppen, and she promoted the album with a sold-out concert tour. Roxette released their second studio album, &quot;Look Sharp!&quot;, on 21 October 1988. Once again, it was an immediate commercial success in Sweden, selling over 140,000 copies within ten days of release, but failed to chart internationally.
Two weeks later, EMI released &quot;Den flygande holländaren&quot; (&quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;), a tribute album to musician Cornelis Vreeswijk, who died the previous year. Fredriksson performed three songs on the compilation. One of these, &quot;Felicia – Adjö&quot;, became her first number one on Svensktoppen. &quot;Den flygande holländaren&quot; peaked at number two for three consecutive weeks in Sweden, held off the top spot by &quot;Look Sharp!&quot;. The compilation was certified double platinum there, denoting shipments in excess of 200,000 units. The non-album single &quot;Sparvöga&quot; (&quot;Sparrow-eye&quot;) was recorded as the theme music for a miniseries of the same name, and became both her highest-peaking and best-selling single to date when it was issued in February 1989. Fredriksson won the award for Pop/Rock Female at the 1989 Grammis, the Swedish equivalent of the Grammy Awards, as well as the Rockbjörnen award for Best Swedish Female, for the fourth consecutive year.

===1989–1992: Roxette&#x27;s international breakthrough===
&quot;The Look&quot; was issued as the third single from &quot;Look Sharp!&quot; in Sweden, and was a top ten hit upon release in January 1989. The following month, the track unexpectedly entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, despite the duo not having a recording contract in the US; the local branch of EMI had previously rejected Roxette as &quot;unsuitable for the American market.&quot; An exchange student from Minnesota returned from Sweden and asked his local Minneapolis-based Top 40 radio station to play the song. The track quickly became popular, and the station began distributing the song to their sister radio operations throughout the US. &quot;The Look&quot; topped the chart after just eight weeks, and went on to peak at number one in a total of 25 countries. The single&#x27;s parent album eventually sold over 9 million copies worldwide. &quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot; was the band&#x27;s second number one on the Hot 100, while the album&#x27;s final single, &quot;Dangerous&quot;, spent two weeks at number two. Fredriksson ended 1989 performing on-stage as part of The Husbands, a cover band formed by Lasse Lindbom and Niklas Strömstedt.
In 1990, Fredriksson contributed a cover of the Evert Taube composition &quot;Så skimrande var aldrig havet&quot; (&quot;The Sea Was Never So Sparkling&quot;) to the tribute album &quot;Taube&quot;. The same year, Touchstone Pictures approached Gessle to compose a song for the upcoming film &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;. As he did not have time to compose a new song—Roxette had recently embarked on their first international concert tour—a new edit of their 1987 single &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot; was created, and featured prominently in the movie. The track became their third number one on the Hot 100, and remains one of Roxette&#x27;s best-known and most successful singles. The following year, the duo released their third album, &quot;Joyride&quot;, which remains their most successful release, with worldwide sales of over 11 million copies. The title track gave them their fourth and final number one on the Hot 100, while &quot;Fading Like a Flower (Every Time You Leave)&quot; peaked at number two. The album was promoted by the &quot;Join the Joyride! Tour&quot;, their biggest and widest ranging tour.

===1992–2002: Continued solo work===
Fredriksson returned to solo work following the recording of Roxette&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Tourism&quot;. She was a featured vocalist on &quot;Änglamark&quot; (&quot;Angel Land&quot;), a Band Aid-style recording spearheaded by former ABBA vocalist Anni-Frid Lyngstad under the banner Artister för Miljö (Artists for the Environment), which was released in July 1992. She also performed the track alongside all of the other featured artists during a televised gala the following month. Fredriksson&#x27;s fourth solo album, &quot;Den ständiga resan&quot; (&quot;The Eternal Journey&quot;), was released that October, and remains both her highest-selling and most critically successful solo studio album, with sales of over 185,000 copies in Sweden as of 2002. She was nominated for three awards at the 1993 Grammis, including Songwriter of the Year and Artist of the Year, winning the latter. &quot;Så länge det lyser mittemot&quot; (&quot;As Long as There Is Light on the Other Side&quot;) and &quot;Mellan sommar och höst&quot; (&quot;Between Summer and Autumn&quot;) were issued as commercial singles; the latter song, &quot;Så stilla så långsamt&quot; (&quot;So Still, So Slow&quot;) and &quot;Det regnar igen&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s Raining Again&quot;), were also top ten hits on Svensktoppen. She toured in support of the record.

Her first musical collaboration with husband Mikael Bolyos, &quot;Herren ber för dig&quot; (&quot;The Lord Prays for You&quot;), was released in November 1994 on the charitable compilation &quot;Vilda fåglar: sånger om barn&quot; (&quot;Wild Birds: Songs About Children&quot;), the proceeds of which were donated to children&#x27;s hospitals in Nordic territories. The next summer, she was a featured vocalist with Bolyos&#x27; band Sugarcane, during their concert residency in Halmstad nightclub Penny Lane. She took part in this residency every summer between 1995 and 2002, performing vocals on several of Bolyos&#x27; original compositions and numerous cover versions, including &quot;The Good Life&quot;.

Her fifth solo album, &quot;I en tid som vår&quot; (&quot;In a Time Like Ours&quot;), was recorded by Fredriksson and Bolyos at their home studio in Djursholm between February and September 1996. She was eight months pregnant when it was released in November, so was unable to promote it. The album peaked at number two on Sverigetopplistan, and lead single &quot;Tro&quot; became the longest-charting song of her career on the Swedish Singles Chart, either as a solo artist or as part of Roxette; it reached number eight and spent a total of 29 weeks on the chart. Her duet with Anni-Frid Lyngstad, &quot;Alla mina bästa år&quot; (&quot;All My Best Years&quot;) – from Frida&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Djupa andetag&quot; (&quot;Deep Breaths&quot;) – was released as a single in February 1997.
Fredriksson and Gessle collaborated on a new Roxette album throughout 1997 and 1998; &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; was eventually released in February 1999. She was more involved in its composition and production than on previous Roxette releases, recording numerous demos at her Djursholm studio and singing lead vocals on ten of the album&#x27;s fourteen songs. The record includes &quot;Waiting for the Rain&quot;, the first Roxette song written and composed solely by Fredriksson. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, the duo signed a new recording contract with their longterm label EMI, which saw Fredriksson obtain the copyright for her entire solo discography. The process of recording the album was reputedly difficult and confrontational, with Fredriksson later heavily criticising co-producer Michael Ilbert: &quot;I ended up under his thumb. He would only communicate with Per and [Roxette&#x27;s regular producer] Clarence Öfwerman. He complained to everyone that my voice was weak, that I needed to re-record vocals, and that my songs weren&#x27;t good enough. He criticised me until I started crying. I lost all my confidence, and no longer felt happy in Roxette.&quot;

Her first greatest hits album, &quot;Äntligen – Marie Fredrikssons bästa 1984–2000&quot;, was released in 2000, and was the second best-selling album of the year in Sweden, behind the Beatles compilation &quot;1&quot;. It was also one of the best-selling albums of 2001 in the country, and was certified triple platinum for shipments of almost 250,000 units. The two new songs recorded for the compilation, &quot;Äntligen&quot; (&quot;Finally&quot;) and &quot;Det som var nu&quot; (&quot;That What Was Now&quot;), were both minor hits. The latter song featured Patrik Isaksson, and was a Swedish re-recording of a demo originally produced by Fredriksson for &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot;. The record was promoted with a Swedish tour.

In 2001, Roxette released their seventh album, &quot;Room Service&quot;. Even though Ilbert was not present for this album&#x27;s recording, Marie later said she &quot;lost all desire to continue Roxette&quot;, and would appear at the recording studio as infrequently as possible; she instructed her taxi driver to wait outside while she recorded vocals for &quot;Milk and Toast and Honey&quot;. The album was supported with a European tour, after which Fredriksson &quot;called for a meeting&quot; with Gessle, wherein she discussed disbanding Roxette, to which Gessle agreed. She issued a box set containing all of her previous studio albums, &quot;Kärlekens guld&quot; (&quot;Love&#x27;s Gold&quot;), in June 2002. Roxette scheduled the release of two new compilation albums, &quot;The Ballad Hits&quot; and &quot;The Pop Hits&quot;, which were to be promoted with performances at the 2002 edition of the pan-European orchestral concert series &quot;Night of the Proms&quot;. A press conference announcing these appearances as Roxette&#x27;s &quot;swan song&quot; was scheduled to take place in the Netherlands on 12 September 2002.

===2002–2003: Brain tumour diagnosis and aftermath===
On 11 September 2002, Fredriksson complained of feeling unwell after jogging with her husband. She collapsed in a bathroom after becoming nauseated, with the impact of the fall fracturing her cranium. She then had an epileptic seizure. Scans later indicated she had a brain tumour in the back of her head. The diagnosis led to the cancellation of Roxette&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Proms&quot; appearances. After waiting several weeks for the effects of the fracture and resulting concussion to subside, she underwent successful surgery to remove the tumour, which was malignant, and she endured months of chemotherapy and radiation treatment.

In January 2003, King of Sweden Carl Gustaf XVI awarded Roxette the Litteris et Artibus (&quot;Culture and Education&quot;) award. Both Gessle and Fredriksson attended the ceremony, which was the first event Fredriksson appeared at after her operation, and one of very few public appearances she made over the next two years. Lasting effects of the tumour included her being blind in one eye and having limited hearing and mobility, as well as being unable to read or write. She was also unable to speak for a considerable period of time after her treatment. On 21 October 2005, Fredriksson conducted an interview with Swedish newspaper &quot;Aftonbladet&quot;, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s been three very difficult years, [but] I&#x27;m healthy. I&#x27;m not receiving treatment any more.&quot;

===2004–2008: Return to creativity===
Following her diagnosis and treatment, Fredriksson and Bolyos began work on her next studio album as a form of therapy at their home studio in Djursholm. &quot;The Change&quot; debuted atop the Swedish Album Chart, and was certified gold for shipments in excess of 30,000 units. It ended 2004 as the 18th best selling album in the country. Several of the songs included were debuted during Fredriksson&#x27;s live appearances with Sugarcane in the mid-1990s. It was also her first studio album to receive a worldwide release. Lead single &quot;2:nd Chance&quot; was a top ten hit in Sweden. Despite being unable to read or write, Fredriksson rediscovered her love of drawing during her illness, and began using charcoal to create artwork as another form of therapy. She drew the cover art which accompanied &quot;The Change&quot;, and held her first art exhibition – titled &quot;After the Change&quot; – at the vernissage of the Doktor Glas gallery in Kungsträdgården, Stockholm in October 2005. Every painting displayed at the exhibition was sold by the end of the second day. She held further art exhibitions, titled &quot;A Table in the Sun&quot;, in both Stockholm and Gothenburg in 2008.

In February 2006, she released an album of Swedish cover songs titled &quot;Min bäste vän&quot; (&quot;My Best Friend&quot;), which peaked at number three on the Swedish Albums Chart. Later that year, she collaborated with Gessle on the recording of two new Roxette songs: &quot;One Wish&quot; and &quot;Reveal&quot;, which were released on the greatest hits compilation &quot;A Collection of Roxette Hits: Their 20 Greatest Songs!&quot;. Fredriksson performed vocals on several tracks of Bolyos&#x27; debut solo album &quot;A Family Affair&quot;, which was released in June 2007. In November, Capitol Records issued a ballad compilation of Fredriksson&#x27;s Swedish-language solo material, &quot;Tid för tystnad – Marie Fredrikssons ballader&quot; (&quot;Time for Silence – Marie Fredriksson&#x27;s Ballads&quot;). The compilation contained two previously unreleased recordings, one of which, &quot;Ordet är farväl&quot; (&quot;The Word Is Goodbye&quot;), was based on a lyric Py Bäckman wrote for Fredriksson&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;Het vind&quot;.

===2008–2018: Return to touring, Roxette reunion and solo work===

&quot;Där du andas&quot; (&quot;Where You Breathe&quot;) was released in August 2008 as the theme song to the film &quot;Arn – The Kingdom at Road&#x27;s End&quot;, and became Fredriksson&#x27;s first number one single in her home country. During the winter of 2008, she took part in the &quot;Stjärnklart&quot; (&quot;Starlit&quot;) series of concerts, which saw her performing an abbreviated set alongside other vocalists in Swedish concert halls. In May 2009, she joined Gessle on-stage at the Melkweg in Amsterdam to perform acoustic renditions of several Roxette songs, during a concert of his &quot;Party Crasher Tour&quot;. Immediately after the gig, Gessle announced to &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; that Roxette would perform at the 2009 edition of &quot;Night of the Proms&quot;. On the first night of that tour, &quot;Expressen&quot; reported that the duo had been recording material for a new album since May 2009.

The duo reunited for a private performance at the Wedding of Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and Daniel Westling at Stockholm Palace on 18 June 2010. Roxette then embarked on a seven-date tour of Europe in the summer of 2010. &quot;She&#x27;s Got Nothing On (But the Radio)&quot; was released in January 2011, becoming a substantial hit in mainland Europe, and their highest-peaking single in Germany since 1992&#x27;s &quot;How Do You Do!&quot;. Their eighth studio album, &quot;Charm School&quot;, followed the next month. &quot;The Neverending World Tour&quot;, their first world tour in fifteen years, began in March 2011, eventually concluding in February 2016. Another studio album, &quot;Travelling&quot;, was released in March 2012. In June 2013, Fredriksson performed &quot;Ännu doftar kärlek&quot; at the Wedding of Princess Madeleine and Christopher O&#x27;Neill. In November, she released &quot;Nu!&quot; (&quot;Now!&quot;), her first album of original Swedish material since 1996. It was supported by a nineteen-date tour of Swedish concert halls, her first solo concerts since 2000.

Roxette&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;Good Karma&quot;, was released in June 2016, and was due to be promoted with a European tour celebrating the duo&#x27;s 30th anniversary. However, these concerts were cancelled after Fredriksson was advised by her doctors to cease all touring activity, due to poor health. She released a statement saying: &quot;Sadly, now my touring days are over and I want to take this opportunity to thank our wonderful fans that [have] followed us on our long and winding journey.&quot; Fredriksson released three non-album singles after she announced her retirement from touring: &quot;Alone Again&quot; and &quot;I Want to Go&quot; in 2017, and &quot;Sing Me a Song&quot; in 2018.

==Personal life==
Fredriksson met her husband, keyboardist Mikael &quot;Micke&quot; Bolyos, during the Australian leg of &quot;Join the Joyride!&quot; in December 1991. She later said of the impact meeting Bolyos had on her professional career: &quot;If [we] hadn&#x27;t met, I don&#x27;t know if I would have been able to continue in Roxette much longer. I couldn&#x27;t handle the personal side of life on tour. I was hanging out in bars, drinking too much. I was sad a lot of the time and had a hard time with the press, when I always had to be nice and say the right things, always having to be available to everybody, always putting on a smile and being happy. Marie Fredriksson the performer had grown in stature, at the expense of Marie the private person. I had less and less space to be myself, and when I was myself I felt uncertain, small and lost.&quot;

The couple married in a private ceremony in May 1994, which was attended only by immediate family members. Her decision not to invite Gessle and his wife to the wedding briefly became a source of tension between the duo. She later explained: &quot;Some of our friends felt excluded and disappointed. Today I understand that, for example, Per and [his wife] were hurt [not to be invited], but then I didn&#x27;t see it that way. My only concern was that I wanted the wedding to be private. It was what felt important then.&quot; Fredriksson and Bolyos had two children, a daughter and a son.

==Death==
Fredriksson died on 9 December 2019 at the age of 61, having had cancer for 17 years since her 2002 brain tumour diagnosis. A private funeral, with only her immediate family in attendance, took place at an undisclosed location. Among the tributes expressed to Fredriksson was a statement from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, who said &quot;We have been struck by the sad news that singer Marie Fredriksson has passed away. For many in our country, even in my family, her music is closely associated with memories from particularly important moments in life.&quot; A concert in memory of Fredriksson took place at the Stora Teatern in Gothenburg on 20 January, featuring performances from Per Gessle and Eva Dahlgren. The concert was broadcast in its entirety five days later on Sveriges Television.

===Posthumous releases===
A previously unreleased solo song titled &quot;Sea of Love&quot; was issued posthumously on the first anniversary of her death. Recorded in 2017, it was the final track she recorded in her lifetime, and was inspired by the peaceful demonstrations that followed the 2017 Stockholm truck attack. Roxette issued a compilation album of outtakes titled &quot;Bag of Trix&quot; on 11 December 2020, containing several previously unreleased demos composed by Fredriksson. Another solo song, &quot;Stay&quot;, was released as a non-album single on 28 May 2021.

<text>Sir Alexander Matthew Busby (26 May 1909 – 20 January 1994) was a Scottish football player and manager, who managed Manchester United between 1945 and 1969 and again for the second half of the 1970–71 season. He was the first manager of an English team to win the European Cup and is widely regarded as one of the greatest managers of all time.

Before going into management, Busby was a player for two of Manchester United&#x27;s greatest rivals, Manchester City and Liverpool. During his time at City, Busby played in two FA Cup Finals, winning one of them. After his playing career was interrupted by the Second World War, Busby was offered the job of assistant coach at Liverpool, but they were unwilling to give him the control that he wanted over the first team. As a result, he took the vacant manager&#x27;s job at Manchester United instead, where he built the famous Busby Babes team that won successive Football League First Division titles and challenged for the European Cup. Eight of these players died in the Munich air disaster, but Busby rebuilt the team and won several more First Division titles as well as other domestic cups before he took United to European Cup glory a decade later. In a total of 25 years with the club, he won 13 trophies including five league championships and the European Cup.

==Early life==
Busby was born to Alexander and Helen &quot;Nellie&quot; (née Greer) Busby in a two-roomed pitman&#x27;s cottage in the mining village of Orbiston, Bellshill, Lanarkshire. When he was born, Busby&#x27;s mother was told by the doctor, &quot;A footballer has come into this house today&quot;. Busby&#x27;s father, Alexander, was a miner called up to serve in the First World War and was killed by a sniper&#x27;s bullet on 23 April 1917 at the Battle of Arras. His great-great grandfather, George Busby, emigrated to Scotland from Ireland during the Great Famine, while his mother&#x27;s side of the family emigrated to Scotland from Ireland later on in the 19th century. Three of his uncles were killed in France with the Cameron Highlanders. Busby&#x27;s mother was left to raise Matt and his three sisters alone until her marriage to a man called Harry Matthie in 1919.

Busby was raised Catholic. Always a devout Catholic, in 1972, Pope Paul VI made him a Knight of Order of Saint Gregory the Great. He had been appointed Knight Bachelor four years earlier.

Busby would often accompany his father down into the coal pits, but his true aspiration was to become a professional footballer. In his 1973 autobiography, Busby described himself as being as football mad as any other boy in Bellshill citing in particular the impression made on him by Alex James and Hughie Gallacher.

His mother might have quashed those dreams when she applied to emigrate with Matt to the United States in the late 1920s, but he was granted a reprieve by the nine-month processing time.

In the meantime, Busby got a full-time job as a collier and played football part-time for Stirlingshire Junior side Denny Hibs. He had played only a few matches for Denny Hibs, but it was not long before he was signed up by a Manchester City side that was a couple of games away from regaining promotion to the First Division.

==Playing career==

===Club career===
Aged 18, Busby signed for Manchester City on a one-year contract worth £5 per week on 11 February 1928, with the provision for him to leave at the end of the deal if he still wished to emigrate to the United States with his mother. He decided to stay and made his debut for City on 2 November 1929, more than 18 months after first signing for the Blues, when he played at inside left in a 3–1 win at home to Middlesbrough in the First Division. He made 11 more appearances for City that season, all at inside forward, scoring five goals in the process.

During the 1930–31 season, City manager Peter Hodge decided that Busby&#x27;s talents could be better exploited from the half-back line, with Busby playing the right-half role. In his new position, Busby built up a reputation as an intelligent player and a finer passer of the ball. In 1930, Manchester United made an enquiry about signing Busby from their cross-town rivals, but they were unable to afford the £150 fee that City demanded. By the 1931–32 season, Busby was firmly established in the first team, missing just one match that season. Indeed, Busby and Jackie Bray became such fixtures at wing-half that club captain Jimmy McMullan had to move to forward to keep his place in the team. In the 1930s Manchester City performed strongly in the FA Cup. They reached the semi-finals in 1932, and the final in 1933 before finally winning the tournament in 1934. However, from the second half of the 1934–35 season, Busby&#x27;s number 4 jersey was worn by Jack Percival with increasing regularity, and Busby was sold to Liverpool for £8,000 on 12 March 1936, having made more than 200 appearances for Manchester City.

He made his debut for the Reds just two days later, on 14 March, away to Huddersfield Town; the match ended in a 1–0 Liverpool defeat. Busby opened his goalscoring account a month later – his 47th-minute strike helped his team to a 2–2 draw with Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park. Busby soon made the number 4 shirt his own, ousting Ted Savage in the process. He rarely missed a game over the following three seasons. This consistency earned Busby the Liverpool captaincy and he led the club with great distinction. Along with Jimmy McDougall and Tom Bradshaw, Busby made up what is considered by many to be the best half-back line Liverpool had ever had.

Bob Paisley joined Liverpool from Bishop Auckland in 1939, and it was Busby who took him under his wing and showed him the ropes at Anfield. This led to a lifelong friendship between two of the most successful managers in English football history. The Second World War arrived soon after, and with it came an end to Busby&#x27;s playing days. Like many of the Liverpool playing staff, he signed on for national service in the King&#x27;s Liverpool Regiment.

=== War years ===

Busby carried on playing football during the war. A few days after helping Aldershot defeat Chelsea 4–3 in a benefit match, Busby signed for Chelsea on 28 October 1939. He made four appearances in total. He also turned out for Middlesbrough (13 matches), Reading, Brentford, and Bournemouth &amp; Boscombe Athletic.

Hibernian lured Busby back north in 1941 at a time when English clubs did not want their players in Scottish football unless they were insured. He played in 37 matches for the club and scored five goals (including one against city rivals Hearts). Busby appeared in back-to-back Summer Cup finals against Rangers with a 3–2 victory in the 1941 competition.

After returning to Liverpool, he was appointed assistant coach of the club in May 1944. While based in Catterick, he also starred for Portrack Shamrocks in the 1945 Ellis Cup final as a war-time guest.

===International career===
Busby made only one official international appearance for Scotland; he played in a 3–2 British Home Championship defeat to Wales at Ninian Park, Cardiff, on 4 October 1933. Playing opposite Busby in the Welsh half-back line was his future assistant Jimmy Murphy. Busby also made seven appearances for Scotland against England during the Second World War, winning just one of them, but these are considered unofficial. He represented the Scottish League XI in an inter-league match in 1941, while he was a guest player of Hibernian.

==Managerial career==

===Arrival and early days at Manchester United===
During the Second World War, Busby served as a football coach in the Army Physical Training Corps, and the experience resulted in Liverpool offering him the job of assistant to their then-manager George Kay. However, the experience had also forged Busby&#x27;s opinions about how football should be played and governed, and when it became clear that they differed from those of the Liverpool board, their chairman Billy McConnell allowed Busby to pursue alternative employment.

After Manchester United had tried to sign Busby from Manchester City in 1930, he became good friends with United&#x27;s fixer, Louis Rocca; their relationship was helped by the fact that both were members of the Manchester Catholic Sportsman&#x27;s Club. United were in desperate need of a manager to take over from club secretary Walter Crickmer after the war and a board meeting was called in December 1944 so as to ascertain who that new manager might be. Knowing that Liverpool had already offered Busby a job, Rocca convinced the United board to &quot;leave it to [him]&quot; and immediately wrote a letter to Busby, addressed to his army regiment. The letter was vague, referring only to &quot;a job&quot;, just in case it fell into the wrong hands, namely the Liverpool officials.

In February 1945, still in uniform, Busby turned up at Cornbrook Cold Storage, one of the United chairman James W. Gibson&#x27;s businesses at Trafford Park to discuss the contents of Rocca&#x27;s letter with the chairman. Busby requested that he be directly involved in training, pick the team on matchdays and even choose the players to be bought and sold without interference from the club directors, who, he believed, did not know the game as well as he did. Such a level of control over the team was unprecedented in the English game, but the United chairman was in no position to argue. Busby was originally offered a three-year contract but managed to secure himself a five-year deal after explaining that it would take at least that long for his revolution to have a tangible effect.

The contract was signed that day – 19 February 1945 – but it was not until 1 October that Busby officially took over the reins at Manchester United. In the interim, he returned to the Army Physical Training Corps, whose football team he took to Bari, Italy, in the spring of 1945. There, he took in a training session for a football team made up of non-commissioned officers led by West Bromwich Albion&#x27;s former half-back Jimmy Murphy. Impressed by the Welshman&#x27;s oratory skills, Busby engaged him in conversation and offered him the job of chief coach at Manchester United, which Murphy accepted verbally there and then, before joining the club officially in early 1946. The two men immediately put their mark on the side, leading them to the runners-up spot in the league, behind Busby&#x27;s former employers Liverpool, by the end of the 1946–47 season. Manchester United were runners-up in the league in 1947, 1948, 1949 and 1951, and won the FA Cup in 1948, before winning the league championship in 1952. This was a welcome success for a club which had last won a major trophy in 1911 and had spent the interwar years bouncing between the First and Second Divisions.

By 1952, however, the side captained by Johnny Carey, was beginning to show its age, and a new set of players had to be found. Busby, who had achieved a great deal of success in spite of his lack of previous managerial experience, was expected to spend large sums of money on high-profile players. Instead, he gradually replaced the older players with players as young as 16 and 17. These included right-back Bill Foulkes, centre-halves Mark Jones and Jackie Blanchflower, wingers Albert Scanlon and David Pegg and forward Billy Whelan. Among them was Duncan Edwards, judged by many to be England&#x27;s finest player of his era, and capped by England at 17 – setting a record for the youngest-ever full international that remained unbroken for more than 40 years. He made relatively few signings from other clubs between 1951 and 1957, rare examples being winger Johnny Berry, forward Tommy Taylor and goalkeeper Harry Gregg.

Busby managed the Great Britain team at the 1948 Summer Olympics. The team reached the semi-finals, but lost 3–1 to the eventual runners-up, Yugoslavia.

In 1956, just after United won another league title, Busby was offered the Real Madrid managerial role. The Real Madrid president at the time, Santiago Bernabéu Yeste, told him that the role was &quot;like managing paradise&quot;. Busby responded by declining the job and adding &quot;Manchester is my heaven&quot;.

===The Busby Babes and the Munich tragedy===
During this period, the team picked up the affectionate nickname the Busby Babes, because of the youthfulness of many of the players he fielded. They won the league in both 1956 and 1957, and were runners-up to Aston Villa in the 1957 FA Cup Final. The young side was so successful that centre-forward Tommy Taylor and goalkeeper Harry Gregg were United&#x27;s only major signings over a spell of almost five years.

Busby and his team began the 1957–58 season ready for a second bid to win the treble of the Football League title, FA Cup and European Cup. On the way home from a European Cup tie against Red Star Belgrade on 6 February 1958, their plane crashed on the runway at Munich-Riem Airport. Seven United players and three club officials were among the 21 people who died at the scene, while Duncan Edwards died from his injuries two weeks later as the final death toll reached 23; two other players (Johnny Berry and Jackie Blanchflower) were injured to such an extent that they never played football again. Busby&#x27;s old friend from Manchester City, the goalkeeper Frank Swift, who had travelled to Munich in his post-playing career as a journalist, also died. Busby suffered multiple injuries and twice received the last rites, but he recovered from his injuries and left the hospital after nine weeks.

He was not aware of the extent of the Munich tragedy until some three weeks after the crash, as doctors felt he was not strong enough to know the truth until then. Towards the end of February 1958, he asked a Franciscan friar at the hospital how Duncan Edwards was faring; the friar was unaware that the news of Edwards&#x27;s death had been kept from him and felt that it was his duty to inform Busby that Edwards was dead. His wife Jean then had to tell him of all the other players and officials who had lost their lives.

He reportedly told his wife that he felt like quitting the manager&#x27;s job, as he had feelings of guilt over the disaster. Busby had gone against the wishes of Football League officials by pressing for Manchester United&#x27;s participation in the European Cup and had not felt able to challenge the aircraft&#x27;s pilot about taking off in heavy snow. Jean urged him to carry on with his duties in honour of the players who had died. In March 1958, Busby also had to face the torment of player Johnny Berry – who suffered career-ending injuries in the crash – complaining that Tommy Taylor was a poor friend for not visiting him in hospital, unaware that Taylor had been killed; Busby had been urged to keep the news from Berry at this stage, which he found particularly difficult.

In the meantime, the team was managed by Jimmy Murphy, who had been taking charge of the Wales team at the time of the crash, and so was not present. Busby attended a new-look United side&#x27;s FA Cup final defeat against Bolton Wanderers at Wembley three months later, and resumed full managerial duties for the following season.

Busby had been appointed the manager of Scotland before the Munich disaster. Dawson Walker took charge of the team during the 1958 World Cup instead. After recovering from his injuries, Busby managed Scotland in two games later that year against Wales and Northern Ireland. Busby gave an 18-year-old Denis Law, then with Huddersfield Town, his first Scotland cap. He had already expressed an interest in signing Law for United by this stage, although he had yet to be successful in doing so.

===The post-Munich side===

After the crash, Busby built a new side around Munich survivors including Harry Gregg, Bobby Charlton and Bill Foulkes. A number of surviving players including Albert Scanlon, Kenny Morgans and Dennis Viollet resumed their careers but moved on to other clubs in the four years following the disaster.

As well as promoting reserve and youth players including Shay Brennan and Johnny Giles to the first team, Busby also delved into the transfer market to sign players including David Herd, Albert Quixall and Denis Law. Northern Irish teenager George Best was scouted for Manchester United by Bob Bishop and signed to the club&#x27;s playing staff by chief scout Joe Armstrong, making his first team debut in September 1963.

Busby successfully rebuilt United, as he guided them to a 3–1 victory over Leicester City in the 1963 FA Cup Final. They were league champions in 1965 and again in 1967, with a defeat on the final day of the 1967–68 season seeing rivals Manchester City snatch the title away.

During the 1966 World Cup, Busby compiled a scouting report on the Portugal side for England manager Alf Ramsey. Busby added a note saying: “Dear Alf... first of all congrats – keep it up. I know you have knowledge of Portugal but have included a report which may help. Wembley final the next stop is the wish of Yours Truly, Matt.”

===European glory and retirement===

The biggest success of his career came on 29 May 1968 when the team won the European Cup. He retired as manager at the end of the following season, having announced his intention to do so on 14 January 1969, but remained at the club as a director, handing over managerial duties to trainer and former player Wilf McGuinness. When McGuinness was sacked in December 1970, Busby returned to the manager&#x27;s seat on an interim basis until a new permanent appointment was made after the end of the season. The job went to Frank O&#x27;Farrell in June 1971 after United were unsuccessful in approaching Jock Stein and Don Revie.

He carried on as a club director for 11 years, before being made president in 1980.

Busby was awarded the CBE in 1958 and was knighted following the European Cup victory in 1968, before being made a Knight Commander of St Gregory by the Pope in 1972.

==Later years and death==

Busby was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on two occasions: in January 1958 (a month before the Munich tragedy), when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Studios in Manchester, and in May 1971, when he became the show&#x27;s first subject to be honoured for a second time. On this occasion, Andrews surprised him just ahead of his final game as interim manager, leading Manchester United in a derby match with Manchester City at Maine Road.

His testimonial was held at Old Trafford in August 1991. A Manchester United side featuring a new generation of star players including Mark Hughes and Steve Bruce took on a Republic of Ireland XI. The result was a 1–1 draw.
Busby suffered a mild stroke in July 1980 at the age of 71 but made a full recovery. Soon afterwards, however, his wife Jean became ill with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. She died, aged 80, in December 1988 in a Manchester nursing home. They had been married for 58 years. Busby died at the age of 84 on 20 January 1994 at the Alexandra Hospital in Cheadle, Greater Manchester. He had been admitted to the hospital earlier that month to have a blood clot removed from his leg, and had appeared to be making a good recovery until his condition deteriorated after several days.

He was buried in Southern Cemetery, Manchester, alongside his wife Jean. His friend Willie Satinoff, who owned a racecourse and died in the Munich air disaster, is buried in the same cemetery. Two days after Busby&#x27;s death, a minute&#x27;s silence was held at the start of United&#x27;s home game against Everton in the Premier League. United finished that season as double winners, lifting the league title and FA Cup.

The sports centre in Bellshill, his place of birth, was named after him shortly after his death. This opened to the public in 1995.

In 1999, in securing the treble of Premier League, FA Cup and European Cup, Manchester United won the European Cup on what would have been Busby&#x27;s 90th birthday – the first time they had won the trophy since Busby&#x27;s 1968 triumph. Then, in 2008, Manchester United won the Champions League again, 50 years after the Munich tragedy, and 40 years since his own triumph in Europe in 1968 where Busby&#x27;s United defeated Benfica.

The day after the centenary of Busby&#x27;s birth, Manchester United played Barcelona in the 2009 Champions League final and lost to the Spanish side 2–0. Busby was made an inaugural inductee of the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002 in recognition of his impact on the sport.

On 6 September 2009, the Sir Matt Busby Shield was contested between Manchester United Reserves and Motherwell. This was held at Fir Park, two miles from Busby&#x27;s place of birth, to mark 100 years since his birth. Motherwell won the match 1–0.

His son Sandy died on 15 September 2014, followed nearly nine months later by his daughter Sheena, who had been married to former Manchester United player Don Gibson for 59 years. He had a total of seven grandchildren, all female.

==In popular culture==
Busby was portrayed by actor Dougray Scott in the 2011 television drama &quot;United&quot;, which was centred on the successes of the Busby Babes and the Munich air crash, as well as the rebuilding of the team by Jimmy Murphy while Busby recovered from his injuries. Busby&#x27;s son Sandy told BBC News that he was &quot;disgusted&quot; by the film. He pointed out that the character of Busby, despite being the first &quot;tracksuit manager&quot; in English football, was never seen in a tracksuit throughout the film, instead wearing a camel coat and a fedora.
&lt;br&gt;

He was mentioned in the Beatles song &quot;Dig It&quot; from the band&#x27;s final album, &quot;Let it Be&quot;, released in 1970.

Brian Cox portrayed an older Busby (and Charlie Cook a younger Busby in flashbacks to 1958) in the 2013 film &quot;Believe&quot;. Set in 1984, it imagines Busby taking on the management of a boys&#x27; team competing in a local cup.

<text>Southwark Towers was a high rise building at 32 London Bridge Street, designed by TP Bennett architects, overlooking London Bridge station, in Southwark, London. When it was demolished in 2008 to make way for The Shard, it was jointly the tallest building ever to have been demolished in the United Kingdom, alongside the Drapers&#x27; Gardens tower.

==History==

Completed in 1975, it was tall and had 25 floors in three wings. Southwark Towers was formerly the London office of Price Waterhouse before it merged with Coopers &amp; Lybrand in 1998. The property attracted some political interest in the 1970s when the developer, Peachey Property Corporation (&#x27;PPC&#x27;), got into financial difficulties. It was subsequently alleged that the transaction to develop the property might not have been entered into on an arm&#x27;s length basis and that there might have been an element of bounty or kindness from PPC to Price Waterhouse, who happened to be PPC&#x27;s auditors. Department of Trade inspectors dismissed the allegations. In 1998 the building was acquired by Irvine Sellar, a property developer.

In 2008, the building was demolished to make way for The Shard. The typical way to demolish a building in the United Kingdom is by implosion, but due to its close proximity to Guy&#x27;s Hospital and other buildings, Southwark Towers was instead taken apart in pieces. It was the tallest building ever to have been demolished in the United Kingdom.

<doc id="562215" wikidata="Q3048071" url="?curid=562215" title="Edmonton Strathcona">
<text>Edmonton Strathcona (formerly known as Edmonton—Strathcona) is a federal electoral district in Alberta, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1953. It spans the south-central part of the city of Edmonton. In the periods 2008–2015 and since 2019, during the 40th, 41st, and 43rd Canadian Parliaments and 44th Canadian Parliaments, Edmonton Strathcona was the only federal riding in Alberta not represented by the Conservative Party.

==Geography==
The riding is home to most of Edmonton&#x27;s francophones. The historic district of Old Strathcona, the University of Alberta, the University of Alberta Campus Saint-Jean and the Mackenzie Health Sciences Centre are all located in the riding.

Edmonton Strathcona encompasses the neighbourhoods of Allendale, Argyll, Avonmore, Belgravia, Bonnie Doon, Capilano, Cloverdale, Empire Park, Forest Heights, Fulton Place, Garneau, Gold Bar, Grandview Heights, Hazeldean, Holyrood, Idylwylde, Kenilworth, King Edward Park, Lansdowne, Lendrum Place, Malmo Plains, McKernan, Ottewell, Parkallen, Pleasantview, Queen Alexandra Park, Ritchie, Riverdale, Strathcona, Strathearn, Terrace Heights, and Windsor Park.

It borders on the federal ridings of Edmonton Centre, Edmonton Griesbach, Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan, Edmonton Mill Woods, and Edmonton Riverbend.

This district is bounded:
* On the north by the North Saskatchewan River (except for a jog that goes around the neighbourhood of Riverdale, which is north of the river).
* On the west by the Whitemud Creek from the North Saskatchewan River to Whitemud Drive.
* On the south by Whitemud Drive, from Whitemud Creek to the City Limits.
* On the east by Edmonton&#x27;s City Limits.

===Political geography===
As evidenced by the 2008 and 2011 elections, this riding is heavily polarized between more urban New Democratic Party (NDP) voters concentrated in the northwest of the riding and suburban Conservative voters concentrated in the south and east.

The NDP picked up this seat in 2008 for the first time in its history, when Edmonton lawyer Linda Duncan defeated Tory incumbent Rahim Jaffer, thanks to a consolidation of non-Conservative votes. They have retained the riding since and it has established itself as clearly the most left-leaning riding in Alberta and one of the safest seats for the NDP in the prairies.

==Demographics==
:&quot;According to the 2011 Canadian census; 2013 representation&quot;

Languages: 77.3% English, 3.8% French, 3.5% Chinese, 2.5% German, 1.5% Ukrainian, 1.3% Spanish, 1.3% Tagalog
Religions: 52.8% Christian (22.1% Catholic, 5.6% United Church, 3.5% Lutheran, 3.5% Anglican, 2.2% Baptist, 2.0% Christian Orthodox, 1.1% Pentecostal, 13.0% Other), 2.5% Muslim, 1.2% Hindu, 1.1% Buddhist, 40.6% No religion 
Median income (2010): $35,026 
Average income (2010): $46,710

==History==
The Strathcona riding dates back to Territorial times (see Strathcona (federal electoral district). It was represented by Liberal MPs, then a Liberal MP who after election became a Unionist, then became a Conservative), and a United Farmer of Alberta MP in that early incarnation. (This riding was abolished in 1924 and its area was split among the Edmonton East, Edmonton West and Vegreville ridings.)

The electoral district of &quot;Edmonton-Strathcona&quot; (later Edmonton Strathcona) was created in 1952 from Edmonton East and Edmonton West ridings.

&quot;Edmonton—Strathcona&quot; gained territory from Edmonton East and was renamed &quot;Edmonton Strathcona&quot; during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

===Historical boundaries===

===Members of Parliament===

This riding has elected the following members of the House of Commons:











===Current member of Parliament===
The current member of Parliament is Heather McPherson of the New Democratic Party who was first elected in the 2019 federal election and re-elected in the 2021 federal election. Winning 61% of the district vote in 2021, McPherson holds the largest margin of victory among elected NDP MPs in the 44th parliament.

<text>25 Bank Street is an office tower in Canary Wharf, in the Docklands area of London. It is currently home to the European headquarters of the investment bank JPMorgan Chase.

The building was developed in 2001–2002 by Canary Wharf Group as one of five new buildings on its Heron Quays site. The building was designed by architects Cesar Pelli &amp; Associates Architects and built by Canary Wharf Contractors.

Before construction, 25 Bank Street had been earmarked by Canary Wharf Group for occupation by Enron&#x27;s European subsidiary. This plan was abandoned in 2001, prior to Enron&#x27;s collapse later that year.

From 2004, 25 Bank Street served as the European headquarters of Lehman Brothers until the bank&#x27;s insolvency in September 2008.

==History==
===Design and development===
In July 2000, Canary Wharf Group formally announced the development of the Heron Quays site, on the southern boundary of the Canary Wharf estate. This would involve the construction of five buildings providing a total of of Grade A office space. During the development phase, the five buildings were designated HQ1 to HQ5, with 25 Bank Street designated as HQ2.

25 Bank Street, along with its neighbours HQ3 (40 Bank Street) and HQ4 (50 Bank Street) were all designed by César Pelli in the International style, featuring complementary external cladding of stainless steel, glass and stone. 25 Bank Street and 40 Bank Street, which are of equal height, are conjoined by the West Winter Garden glass enclosed concourse and all provide enclosed access to an underground retail mall. The building is designed around a central concrete core containing elevators, washrooms and services; this is surrounded by office floors with stainless steel and glass curtainwalls.

There are 5 basement levels, a ground floor, mezzanine, and a further 32 levels numbered 1 to 33. There is no 13th floor. The lower levels, up to level 8, incorporate large podium areas on the south and west sides. This allows large trading floors to be accommodated, each with a floorplate. The south podium incorporates a secondary core.

In July 2000 Enron Europe opened negotiations with Canary Wharf Group to take 130,060 sq m (1.4 m sq ft) of space on the Canary Wharf estate. The HQ1 and HQ2 sites were earmarked for use by Enron in a mixed use development that would include a mini-power station. This development was planned to supplement Enron&#x27;s Victoria headquarters at 40 Grosvenor Place. The negotiations were discontinued early in 2001, prior to Enron&#x27;s insolvency later that year.

On 3 April 2001, Canary Wharf Group announced that it had concluded a 30-year lease agreement with Lehman Brothers for the entirety of the space in HQ2, a total of over . Under the terms of the agreement, Canary Wharf Group provided a number of financial incentives to Lehman Brothers, including coverage of fitting out costs up to £35 per sq ft; a further payment of £16 million on drawdown of the lease; and a contribution of £30 per sq ft towards the refitting of of office space occupied by Lehman Brothers in Broadgate, City of London.

===Construction===
The construction of 25 Bank Street was undertaken by Canary Wharf Contractors, with an overall build time of 32 months. The geography of the site presented considerable access challenges in that it was surrounded by water on three sides, with two thirds of the fourth side in the former dock. A coffer dam was constructed in the dock to enable the water to be pumped out and a road was built on top of the dam, with earth ramps to enable construction traffic to reach the construction site.
River traffic was extensively used to minimise road deliveries; consignments of aggregates and structural steel were delivered by barge and a concrete batching plant was constructed on a barge anchored in the dock. At the end of the project the coffer dam was removed and the fill loaded onto barges for removal.

The construction of the rectangular concrete core was subcontracted to Byrne Bros (Formwork) Ltd, who used the PERI ACS self climbing formwork system. This was the first time this system had been used in the UK. By using the jumpform system, the subcontractor was able to use additional work platforms situated below the main work platform, so that multiple phases of work could be undertaken concurrently.

The West Podium of 25 Bank Street is situated at a height of above a length of the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), including Heron Quays station. To protect the DLR, which continued to operate throughout construction, a concrete slab was installed above the railway that formed the base of the West Podium. This would support the upper floors and also act as an assembly deck during construction operations. The five levels of the West Podium are suspended from transfer trusses at the higher levels.

The building was topped out on 8 November 2002. George Iacobescu, Canary Wharf Group Chief Executive, and Jeremy Isaacs, chief executive of Lehman Brothers for Europe and Asia, both signed the final steel girder before it was hoisted into place. At that time, 25 Bank Street was London&#x27;s 6th tallest skyscraper.

Elevators engineering was undertaken by Lerch, Bates &amp; Associates, Inc. A specialist lighting arrangement was installed to illuminate the crown of the building. This was designed by LightMatters and involved a total of 5,472 LED fixtures installed between the inner wall and the outer glass shell of the building&#x27;s 32nd level.

==Occupancy==
===Lehman Brothers===
25 Bank Street served as the headquarters of Lehman Brothers International (Europe) and associated Lehman Brothers entities in Europe. The building was officially opened as Lehman Brothers&#x27; European headquarters on 5 April 2004. Gordon Brown, then the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, officiated at the opening ceremony.

The building&#x27;s fit out was undertaken by Hilson Moran, who were responsible for both the shell &amp; core services design for Canary Wharf Limited and the fit-out services design for Lehman Brothers. Facilities included a TV broadcast studio, meeting rooms and 400-seat auditorium at level 1; a 3000 sq metre Data Centre at level 2; four trading floors at levels 3 to 6; a Gym &amp; Fitness Centre and staff restaurant at level 7; executive floors at levels 30 and 31; and twenty office floors. Plant floors were located at levels 8, 32 and 33. The shell &amp; core architect was Adamsons Associates, with Swanke Hayden Connell as the fit-out architect.

Although levels 3-6 were all capable of being used as trading floors, only levels 4 and 5 were fully configured as such during the Lehman occupation.

The staff restaurant, at level 7, was operated by Restaurant Associates, who also provided catering services for corporate events hosted in the building.

The full floor configuration during the Lehman Brothers occupation was:
===Lehman Brothers (in administration)===
====Insolvency====

The cash resources of the Lehman Group were managed centrally in New York by the parent company, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LBHI). Following a deterioration in LBHI&#x27;s financial position, on the afternoon of Sunday 14 September 2008, the directors of Lehman Brothers International (Europe) Ltd (LBIE) sought assurances from LBHI that payments due to be made on its behalf on the following business day would be made. At approximately 12.30 am on 15 September, LBHI informed LBIE that it was preparing to file for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection under US law and that it was therefore no longer in a position to make payments to or on behalf of LBIE. Accordingly, overnight preparations were made for a number of UK based Lehman companies to protect their interests by seeking an Administration Order under UK law. This order was granted by a UK judge at 7.56 am on Monday 15 September 2008.

====Ongoing occupation of 25 Bank Street====
PricewaterhouseCoopers were appointed as administrators of the UK business and as part of this task took over the management of 25 Bank Street. Having arranged the sale of parts of the Lehman business to Nomura International plc, the administrators reached agreement to sub-lease approximately in 25 Bank Street to Nomura International. An additional of space was sub-let to Nomura in March 2010. These subleases were due to expire in March 2011; in the event, Nomura would exercise a break option in September 2010 and exit the building at that time. A further was sub-let to other tenants, including the Financial Services Authority, land agents Jones Lang Wootton and NYSE Euronext.

From 1 January 2010, Lehman Brothers (in administration) reduced its occupation of 25 Bank Street to ; and from 31 March of that year exited the building entirely, moving to new premises at 25 Canada Square. The total property, IT and occupancy costs to the Lehman Brothers administration totalled $170 million for the 18-month period from the time of insolvency to the time of the 25 Bank Street exit. The office move resulted in annual cost savings of over $73 million.

===J.P. Morgan Investment Bank===
On 20 December 2010 J.P. Morgan announced the acquisition of 25 Bank Street to become the new European headquarters of its Investment Bank in 2012. The purchase price would be £495 million. This was one of several real estate commitments announced by the bank that also included the purchase of 60 Victoria Embankment, a London building that the bank had been leasing since 1991 and which accommodates the firm&#x27;s Treasury and Securities Services division. J.P. Morgan also announced that it had reached agreement with Canary Wharf Group to fund a further tranche of development to its Riverside South scheme.

The building&#x27;s postcode was changed to E14 5JP. During the Lehman Brothers occupation it was E14 5LE.

<doc id="562222" wikidata="Q2268391" url="?curid=562222" title="A Wrinkle in Time">
<text>A Wrinkle in Time is a young adult science fantasy novel written by American author Madeleine L&#x27;Engle. First published in 1962, the book won the Newbery Medal, the Sequoyah Book Award and the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award, and was runner-up for the Hans Christian Andersen Award. The main characters – Meg Murry, Charles Wallace Murry, and Calvin O&#x27;Keefe – embark on a journey through space and time, from galaxy to galaxy, as they endeavor to rescue the Murrys&#x27; father and fight The Black Thing that has intruded into several worlds.

The novel offers a glimpse into the war between light and darkness, and good and evil, as the young characters mature into adolescents on their journey, and wrestles with questions of spirituality and purpose, as the characters are often thrown into conflicts of love, divinity, and goodness. It is the first book in L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s &quot;Time Quintet&quot;, which follows the Murry and O&#x27;Keefe families.

L&#x27;Engle modeled the Murry family on her own. B. E. Cullinan noted that L&#x27;Engle created characters who &quot;share common joy with a mixed fantasy and science fiction setting&quot;. The novel&#x27;s scientific and religious undertones are therefore highly reflective of the life of L&#x27;Engle.

The book has inspired a 2003 television film directed by John Kent Harrison, and a 2018 theatrical film directed by Ava DuVernay, both produced by The Walt Disney Company.

== Background ==

Raised in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, author Madeleine L&#x27;Engle began writing at a young age. After graduating from boarding school in Switzerland, she attended Smith College, where she earned a degree in English. In addition to writing, L&#x27;Engle also gained experience as an actor and playwright. At age forty, she nearly abandoned her career as a novelist, but continued to write after her publication of &quot;Meet the Austins&quot;.

L&#x27;Engle wrote &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; between 1959 and 1960. In her memoir, L&#x27;Engle explains that the book was conceived &quot;during a time of transition&quot;. After years of living in rural Goshen, Connecticut where they ran a general store, L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s family, the Franklins, moved back to New York City, first taking a ten-week camping trip across the country. L&#x27;Engle writes that &quot;we drove through a world of deserts and buttes and leafless mountains, wholly new and alien to me. And suddenly into my mind came the names, &quot;Mrs Whatsit&quot;. &quot;Mrs Who&quot;. &quot;Mrs Which&quot;.&quot; This was in the spring of 1959. When asked for more information in an interview with Horn Book magazine in 1983, L&#x27;Engle responded

L&#x27;Engle has also described the novel as her &quot;psalm of praise to life, [her] stand for life against death.&quot;

Additionally, L&#x27;Engle drew upon her interest in science. The novel includes references to Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity and Planck&#x27;s quantum theory.

&quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; is the first novel in the Time Quintet, a series of five young-adult novels by L&#x27;Engle. Later books include &quot;A Wind in the Door&quot;, &quot;A Swiftly Tilting Planet&quot;, &quot;Many Waters&quot;, and &quot;An Acceptable Time&quot;. The series follows the adventures of Meg Murry, her youngest brother Charles Wallace Murry, their friend Calvin O&#x27;Keefe, and her twin siblings Sandy and Dennys Murry. Throughout the series, family members band together to travel through time as they attempt to save the world from the grasps of evil.

==Publication history==
Upon completion in 1960, the novel was rejected by at least 26 publishers, because it was, in L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s words, &quot;too different,&quot; and &quot;because it deals overtly with the problem of evil, and it was really difficult for children, and was it a children&#x27;s or an adults&#x27; book, anyhow?&quot;

In &quot;A special message from Madeleine L&#x27;Engle&quot;, L&#x27;Engle offers another possible reason for the rejections: &quot;&quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; had a female protagonist in a science fiction book&quot;, which at the time was rare.

After trying &quot;forty-odd&quot; publishers (L&#x27;Engle later said &quot;twenty-six rejections&quot;), L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s agent returned the manuscript to her. Then at Christmas, L&#x27;Engle threw a tea party for her mother. One of the guests happened to know J.C. Farrar of Farrar, Straus and Giroux, and he insisted that L&#x27;Engle should meet with him. Although the publisher did not, at the time, publish a line of children&#x27;s books, Farrar met L&#x27;Engle, liked the novel, and ultimately published it under the Ariel imprint.

In 1963, the book won the Newbery Medal, an annual award given by the Association for Library Service to Children, a division of the American Library Association, to the author of the most distinguished contribution to American children&#x27;s literature. The book has been continuously in print since its first publication. The hardback edition is still published by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. The original blue dust jacket by Ellen Raskin was replaced with new art by Leo and Diane Dillon, with the publication of &quot;A Swiftly Tilting Planet&quot; in 1978. The book has also been published in a 25th anniversary collectors&#x27; edition (limited to 500 signed and numbered copies), at least two book club editions (one hardback, one Scholastic Book Services paperback), as a trade paperback under the Dell Yearling imprint, and as a mass market paperback under the Dell Laurel-Leaf imprint. The cover art on the paperback editions has changed several times since its first publication.

The book was reissued by Square Fish in trade and mass market paperback formats in May 2007, along with the rest of the Time Quintet. This new edition includes a previously unpublished interview with L&#x27;Engle as well as a transcription of her Newbery Medal acceptance speech.

==Plot summary==
One night, thirteen-year-old Meg Murry meets an eccentric new neighbor, Mrs. Whatsit, who refers to something called a tesseract. Meg later finds out it is a scientific concept her father was working on before his mysterious disappearance. The following day, Meg, her child genius brother Charles Wallace, and fellow schoolmate Calvin visit Mrs. Whatsit&#x27;s home, where the equally strange Mrs. Who and the voice of the unseen Mrs. Which promise to help Meg find and rescue her father.

Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which turn out to be supernatural beings who teleport Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin O&#x27;Keefe through the universe by means of a tesseract, a fifth-dimensional phenomenon explained as folding the fabric of space and time; this form of travel is called &quot;tessering&quot;. Their first stop is the planet Uriel, a world inhabited by centaur-like beings who live in a state of light and love, fighting against the approaching darkness. There, the Mrs. Ws demonstrate to the children how the universe is under attack from an evil being that appears particularly clearly on Uriel as an overwhelming dark cloud, called The Black Thing. They then take the children to Orion&#x27;s Belt to visit the Happy Medium, a far-seeing person with a crystal ball through which they are shown that Earth is partially covered by the darkness, although great religious figures, philosophers, scientists, and artists, have been fighting against it. Mrs. Whatsit is revealed to be a former star, who exploded in an act of self-sacrifice to fight the darkness.

The three Mrs. Ws tesser the children to the edge of the inhabited part of a dark planet named Camazotz, which has succumbed to The Black Thing, and where the Mrs. Ws cannot themselves enter. Meg&#x27;s and Charles Wallace&#x27;s father, Alex Murry, is imprisoned in a nearby city because he refused to yield to the group mind that causes inhabitants to behave in a mechanical way. When they reach the CENTRAL Central Intelligence building, Charles Wallace deliberately allows himself to be hypnotized, in order to find where their father is kept. Controlled by the group mind, Charles Wallace takes Meg and Calvin to the place where Meg&#x27;s father is being held prisoner. He then takes them to IT, the disembodied brain with powerful telepathic abilities that controls the planet. Using special powers from Mrs. Who&#x27;s glasses, Meg is able to reach her father, who tessers Calvin, Meg, and himself to the adjacent planet Ixchel, before IT can control them all. Charles Wallace is left behind, still under the influence of IT, Meg is paralyzed from contact with The Black Thing during the trip, and Dr. Murry suffers broken ribs. The inhabitants of Ixchel are beast-like, with featureless faces, tentacles, and four arms. Despite their frightening appearance, they prove to be both wise and gentle; one cures Meg&#x27;s paralysis, prompting Meg to nickname it &quot;Aunt Beast&quot;.

The trio of Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which arrive on Ixchel, before Alex Murry has recovered, and assign the rescue of Charles Wallace to Meg alone. Arriving at the building where IT resides, she finds Charles Wallace still under IT&#x27;s control. Inspired by hints from the Mrs. Ws, Meg focuses all her love on Charles Wallace and is able to free him from IT, at which point Mrs. Which remotely tessers Meg and Charles Wallace off Camazotz.

They all then tesser back to Earth, to the edge of the forest near the Murry home, and back to the moment in time just after the Mrs. Ws and the children originally left Earth. Then the Mrs. Ws vanish.

==Characters==
===Main characters===
====Margaret &quot;Meg&quot; Murry====

Meg is the oldest child of scientists Alex and Kate Murry, about thirteen years old. Introduced on the first page of the book, she is the story&#x27;s main protagonist. One of Kate Murry&#x27;s &quot;abnormal&quot; children, she seems to have a temper and a difficult time focusing in school. She was portrayed by Katie Stuart in the 2003 film and by Storm Reid in the 2018 film.

====Charles Wallace Murry====

Charles Wallace is the youngest Murry child, at six years old. Charles Wallace speaks only to his family, but can empathically or telepathically read certain people&#x27;s thoughts and feelings. He was portrayed by David Dorfman in the 2003 film and by Deric McCabe in the 2018 film.

====Calvin O&#x27;Keefe====

Calvin is the third oldest of Paddy and Branwen O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s eleven children: a tall, thin, red-haired 14-year-old high school junior. He was portrayed by Gregory Smith in the 2003 film, and by Levi Miller in the 2018 film.

===Supernatural characters===
==== Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which ====
The Mrs. Ws are immortal beings who can travel across large stretches of both space and time by dematerializing and rematerializing (&quot;tessering&quot;). They are all capable of shapeshifting, but appear as elderly women for almost all of the story.

Mrs. Whatsit is the youngest of the Mrs. Ws (despite being 2,379,152,497 years, 8 months, and 3 days old), and has the most interaction with the children. In a past life she was a star, and when reminded, still grieves for the loss of life on her former planets, when the star she was, died.

Mrs. Who communicates by quoting (and translating) literary sayings in Latin, Spanish, Italian, German, French, Portuguese, and Greek. When the Mrs. Ws leave the group on Camazotz, for no immediately obvious reason, Mrs. Who loans Meg her glasses.

Mrs. Which is the leader of the three women, the oldest of them, and the most skilled at tessering. However, she has nearly forgotten what a body is like, so has difficulty maintaining a solid form, and because of this does make a mistake while tessering to Camazotz. She is usually business-like and unemotional towards the children.

==== IT ====

&quot;IT&quot; is the telepathic brain that controls the planet of Camazotz. IT appears as a giant-sized, disembodied human brain, housed in a transparent jar. While IT usually speaks through one of its pawns (such as the Man with Red Eyes) IT can speak directly to people via telepathy. IT is either an avatar or a servant of The Black Thing.

====The Black Thing====
The Black Thing, a formless, shadowy being, is the source of all evil in the universe.

=== Secondary characters ===
====Dr. Alexander &quot;Alex&quot; Murry==== 
Alex Murry, the father of the Murry children, is a physicist who is researching tesseracts and their relation to the mysteries of the space / time continuum. At the start of the novel, he has been missing for some time.

====Dr. Katherine &quot;Kate&quot; Murry====

==== Happy Medium ====
The Happy Medium is human in appearance, but of uncertain gender. She uses her powers and a crystal ball to look at distant places and people. She prefers to look for happy events and her customary demeanor is jolly, but becomes sad upon viewing sad events. She lives in a cavern on a planet in Orion&#x27;s Belt.

==== Aunt Beast ====
Aunt Beast is a nurturing creature who cares after Meg on the planet Ixchel, the next planet out from Camazotz, nursing Meg back towards wholeness after exposure to The Black Thing. &quot;Aunt Beast&quot; is a name created by Meg that the character accepts; her actual name, if any, is not given. She is a human-sized, furry, four-armed, eyeless gray creature with telepathic abilities. Instead of fingers she has numerous long, waving tentacles.

== Analysis ==

=== Religion ===
The novel is highly spiritualized, with notable influences of divine intervention and prominent undertones of religious messages. According to James Beasley Simpson, the overwhelming love and desire for light within the novel is directly representative of a Christian love for God and Jesus Christ. Furthermore, the children encounter spiritual intervention, signaling God&#x27;s presence in the ordinary, as well as the extendibility of God&#x27;s power and love. Madeleine L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s fantasy works are in part highly expressive of her Christian viewpoint in a manner somewhat similar to that of Christian fantasy writer C.S. Lewis.
L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s liberal Christianity has been the target of criticism from conservative Christians, especially with respect to certain elements of &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot;.

L&#x27;Engle utilizes numerous religious references and allusions in the naming of locations within the novel. &quot;Camazotz&quot; is the name of a Mayan bat god, one of L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s many mythological allusions in her nomenclature.
The name Ixchel refers to a Mayan jaguar goddess of medicine. Uriel is a planet with extremely tall mountains, an allusion to the Archangel Uriel. It is inhabited by creatures that resemble winged centaurs. It is &quot;the third planet of the star Malak (meaning &#x27;angel&#x27; in Hebrew) in the spiral galaxy Messier 101&quot;, which would place it at roughly 21 million light-years from Earth. The site of Mrs Whatsit&#x27;s temporary transformation into one of these winged creatures, it is the place where &quot;the guardian angels show the questers a vision of the universe that is obscured on earth.&quot; The three women are described as ancient beings who act as guardian angels.

The theme of picturing the fight of good against evil as a battle of light and darkness is a recurring one. Its manner is reminiscent of the prologue to the Gospel of John, which is quoted within the book. When the Mrs Ws reveal their secret roles in the cosmic fight against darkness, they ask the children to name some figures on Earth, a partially dark planet, who fight the darkness. They name Jesus and, later in the discussion, the Buddha is named as well.

Nevertheless, religious journalist Sarah Pulliam Bailey doubts whether the novel contains religious undertones. Bailey explains that many readers somehow believe the novel promotes witchcraft, as opposed to alluding to Christian spirituality. Bailey states that conservative Christians take offense, due to the novel&#x27;s potential relativistic qualities, suggesting the various interpretations of religious allusions signals anti-Christian sentiments. However, in her personal journal referencing &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot;, L&#x27;Engle confirms the religious content within the novel: &quot;If I&#x27;ve ever written a book that says what I feel about God and the universe, this is it.&quot;

=== Conformity ===
Themes of conformity and yielding to the status quo are prominent in the novel:

IT is a powerful dominant group that manipulates the planet of Camazotz into conformity. Even Charles Wallace falls prey and is hence persuaded to conform. It is thanks to Meg that she and her father and brother are able to break from conformity.

According to Charlotte Jones Voiklis, the author&#x27;s granddaughter, the story was not a simple allegory of communism; in a three-page passage that was cut before publication, the process of domination and conformity is said to be an outcome of dictatorship under totalitarian regimes, and of an intemperate desire for security in democratic countries.

J. Fulton writes:

==== Conformity on Camazotz ====
Camazotz is a planet of extreme, enforced conformity, ruled by a disembodied brain called IT. Camazotz is similar to Earth, with familiar trees such as birches, pines, and maples, an ordinary hill on which the children arrive, and a town with smokestacks, which &quot;might have been one of any number of familiar towns&quot;. The horror of the place arises from its ordinary appearance, endlessly duplicated. The houses are &quot;all exactly alike, small square boxes painted gray&quot;, which, according to author Donald Hettinga, signals a comparison to &quot;the burgeoning American suburbia&quot;, such as the post-war housing developments of Levittown, New York. The people who live in the houses are similarly described as &quot;mother figures&quot; who &quot;all gave the appearance of being the same&quot;.

W. Blackburn compared Camazotz to &quot;an early sixties American image of life in a communist state&quot;, which Blackburn later dismissed.

=== Feminism ===
&quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; has also received praise for empowering young female readers. Critics have celebrated L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s depiction of Meg Murry, a young, precocious heroine whose curiosity and intellect help save the world from evil. &quot;The New York Times&quot; has described this portrayal as &quot;a departure from the typical &#x27;girls&#x27; book&#x27; protagonist – as wonderful as many of those varied characters are&quot;.

In doing so, L&#x27;Engle has been credited for paving the way for other bright heroines, including Hermione Granger of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; book series, as well as Katniss Everdeen of the &quot;Hunger Games&quot; trilogy. Regarding her choice to include a female protagonist, L&#x27;Engle has stated in her acceptance speech upon receiving the Margaret Edwards Award, &quot;I&#x27;m a female. Why would I give all the best ideas to a male?&quot;

==Reception==
At the time of the book&#x27;s publication, &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; said:

According to &quot;The Horn Book Magazine&quot;:

In a retrospective essay about the Newbery Medal-winning books from 1956 to 1965, librarian Carolyn Horovitz wrote:

In a 2011 essay for &quot;Tor.com&quot;, American author and critic Mari Ness called &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot;

A 2004 study found that &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; was a common read-aloud book for sixth-graders in schools in San Diego County, California. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed the book as one of its &quot;Teachers&#x27; top 100 books for children.&quot; It was one of the &quot;Top 100 chapter books&quot; of all time in a 2012 poll by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;.

In 2016, the novel saw a spike in sales after Chelsea Clinton mentioned it as influential in her childhood in a speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.

=== Controversy ===
&quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; is on the American Library Association list of the 100 most frequently challenged books of 1990–2000 at number 23. The novel has been accused of being both anti-religious and anti-Christian for its inclusion of witches and crystal balls, and for containing &quot;New Age&quot; spiritual themes that do not reflect traditional Christian teachings.

According to &quot;USA Today&quot;, the novel was challenged in a school district in the state of Alabama due to the &quot;book&#x27;s listing the name of Jesus Christ together with the names of great artists, philosophers, scientists, and religious leaders when referring to those who defend Earth against evil.&quot; The novel was also challenged in 1984 by an elementary school in Polk City, Florida when parents claimed that the novel promoted witchcraft.

Regarding this controversy, L&#x27;Engle told &quot;The New York Times&quot;:

=== Audio books ===
In 1994, Listening Library released an unabridged, 4 cassette audio edition read by the author.

On January 10, 2012, Audible released a 50th anniversary edition recorded by Hope Davis.

=== Film adaptations ===
In 2003, a television adaptation of the novel was made by a collaboration of Canadian production companies, to be distributed in the United States by Disney. The movie was directed by John Kent Harrison, with a teleplay by Susan Shilliday. It stars Katie Stuart as Meg Murry, Alfre Woodard as Mrs. Whatsit, Alison Elliott as Mrs. Who, and Kate Nelligan as Mrs. Which. In an interview with MSNBC / &quot;Newsweek&quot;, when L&#x27;Engle was asked if the film &quot;met her expectations&quot;, she said, &quot;I have glimpsed it ... I expected it to be bad, and it is.&quot;

A theatrical feature film adaptation of the novel, by Walt Disney Pictures, was released in 2018. The film was directed by Ava DuVernay and written by Jennifer Lee and Jeff Stockwell. It stars Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, Chris Pine, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Storm Reid, Michael Peña, and Zach Galifianakis.

=== Plays ===
An adaptation by James Sie premiered at the Lifeline Theatre in Chicago in 1990, and returned to the stage in 1998 and 2017.

John Glore adapted the novel as a play that premiered in 2010. It was written for 6 actors playing 12 parts. One actor plays Mrs Whatsit, the Man with Red Eyes, and Camazotz Man. Similarly, another performer plays the characters of Dr. Kate Murry, Mrs Who, Camazotz Woman, and Aunt Beast. The stage adaptation premiered in Costa Mesa, California, with productions in Bethesda, Maryland; Cincinnati; Philadelphia; Orlando; Portland, Oregon; and other cities.

An adaptation by Tracy Young premiered at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in April 2014, with productions at colleges and theaters around the U.S.

A new musical adaptation with book by Lauren Yee and music and lyrics by Heather Christian will make its world premiere at Arena Stage in June of 2025, directed by Lee Sunday Evans.

===Opera===
In 1992, OperaDelaware (known for frequently adapting children&#x27;s books) staged an opera based on &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; written by Libby Larsen with a libretto by Walter Green. The review in Philly.com stated: &quot;The composer does not place arias and set pieces, but conversational ensembles with spoken dialogue that made the young daughter&#x27;s climactic but concise song about familial love all the more imposing.&quot;

=== Graphic novel ===
In 2010, Hope Larson announced that she was writing and illustrating the official graphic novel version of the book. This version was published by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux in October 2012.

<doc id="562223" wikidata="Q138755" url="?curid=562223" title="40 Bank Street">
<text>40 Bank Street is a skyscraper in Heron Quays which overlooks the London Docklands. It is tall, having 30 stories and a total floor area of 634,000-square-feet. The building was designed by Cesar Pelli &amp; Associates, and was built by Canary Wharf Contractors in 2003. The executive architect was Adamson Associates. As of 2023, the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat lists 40 Bank Street as the 31st tallest building in London and the 35th tallest building in the United Kingdom.

== Design and development ==

During a wave of development in the early 2000s, 40 Bank Street became one of the first six skyscrapers to be built on Canary Wharf after One Canada Square (along with 8 Canada Square, 25 Canada Square, One Churchill Place, 25 Bank Street, and 10 Upper Bank Street). Immediately to the west of 40 Bank Street is 25 Bank Street, a skyscraper of the same height, while to the east is a shorter building, 50 Bank Street, which matches the style of 40 Bank Street. These latter three buildings were all designed by Pelli and are connected by glass winter gardens. 40 Bank Street connects to Jubilee Place, an underground shopping mall.

40 Bank Street is the most slender of the three towers speculatively built by Canary Wharf Group on Heron Quays (the others being 25 Bank Street and One Churchill Place). Whereas 25 Bank Street was designed in the International Style, 40 Bank Street is a modernist structure. The building has uniformly spaced windows bounded by a light-coloured stone facade—recalling the 1980s-style buildings in the area—except for a glass section which runs along the side and onto the top of the structure. The solid facade meets the glass curtain walls in such a way as to give the impression that two different buildings have been fused together, an effect that Pelli also employed at the World Financial Center in New York City. The windows are slightly recessed from the facade, giving the illusion, in certain lightning, that the windows are hollow openings. The proportion between the window openings along the curtain wall was chosen in order to emphasise the height of the building.

Construction on 40 Bank Street began in 2000 and was completed in 2003. The curtain walls were manufactured by Permasteelisa. In 2023, Canary Wharf Group completed renovations of the lobby, including security updates.

== Occupants ==

The original tenants at 40 Bank Street were Allen &amp; Overy and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom. Skadden, after consultation with JLL, left 40 Bank Street in 2021 and relocated to 22 Bishopsgate. Allen &amp; Overy tested workspace concepts in 40 Bank Street prior their expansion to Bishops Square. Allen &amp; Overy sublet two floors of the building in 2013, at £35 per sq ft.

In 2022, Canary Wharf Group began offering fully-fitted office space at 40 Bank Street, with Citibank being its first customer. In 2023, HVIVO, a research group specialising in human trials signed a ten-year lease for 39,000 square feet of office space at 40 Bank Street.

<doc id="562224" wikidata="Q325314" url="?curid=562224" title="Tecumseh's War">
<text>Tecumseh&#x27;s War or Tecumseh&#x27;s Rebellion was a conflict between the United States and Tecumseh&#x27;s confederacy, led by the Shawnee leader Tecumseh in the Indiana Territory. Although the war is often considered to have climaxed with William Henry Harrison&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811, Tecumseh&#x27;s War essentially continued into the War of 1812 and is frequently considered a part of that larger struggle. The war lasted for two more years, until 1813, when Tecumseh and his second-in-command, Roundhead, died fighting Harrison&#x27;s Army of the Northwest at the Battle of Moraviantown in Upper Canada, near present-day Chatham, Ontario, and his confederacy disintegrated. Tecumseh&#x27;s War is viewed by some academic historians as the final conflict of a longer-term military struggle for control of the Great Lakes region of North America, encompassing a number of wars over several generations, referred to as the Sixty Years&#x27; War.

==Background==
The two principal adversaries in the conflict, Tecumseh and William Henry Harrison, had both been junior participants in the Battle of Fallen Timbers at the close of the Northwest Indian War in 1794. Tecumseh was not among the signers of the Treaty of Greenville that ended that war and ceded much of present-day Ohio, long inhabited by the Shawnee and other Native Americans, to the United States. However, many Indian leaders in the region accepted the Greenville terms, and for the next ten years, pan-tribal resistance to American hegemony faded.

After the Treaty of Greenville, most of the Ohio Shawnee settled at the Shawnee village of Wapakoneta on the Auglaize River, where they were led by Black Hoof, a senior chief who had signed the treaty. Little Turtle, a war chief of the Miami, who had also participated in the earlier war and signed the Greenville Treaty, lived in his village on the Eel River. Both Black Hoof and Little Turtle urged cultural adaptation and accommodation with the United States.

The tribes of the region participated in several treaties, including the Treaty of Grouseland and the Treaty of Vincennes that gave and recognized American possession of most of southern Indiana. The treaties resulted in an easing of tensions by allowing settlers into Indiana and appeasing the Indians with reimbursement for the lands the settlers were inhabiting by squatting.

===Religious revival===

In May 1805, Lenape chief Buckongahelas, one of the most important native leaders in the region, died of either smallpox or influenza. The surrounding tribes believed his death was caused by a form of witchcraft, and a witch-hunt ensued, leading to the death of several suspected Lenape witches. The witch-hunts inspired a nativist religious revival led by Tecumseh&#x27;s brother Tenskwatawa (&quot;The Prophet&quot;), who emerged in 1805 as a leader among the witch hunters. He quickly posed a threat to the influence of the accommodationist chiefs, to whom Buckongahelas had belonged.

As part of his religious teachings, Tenskwatawa urged Indians to reject European American ways, such as liquor, European-style clothing, and firearms. He also called for the tribes to refrain from ceding any more lands to the United States. Numerous Indians, who were inclined to cooperate with the United States, were accused of witchcraft, and some were executed by followers of Tenskwatawa. Black Hoof was accused in the witch-hunt but was not harmed. From his village near Greenville, Tenskwatawa compromised Black Hoof&#x27;s friendly relationship with the United States, leading to rising tensions with settlers in the region. Black Hoof and other tribal leaders began to put pressure on Tenskwatawa and his followers to leave the area to prevent the situation from escalating.

By 1808, tensions with whites and the Wapakoneta Shawnee compelled Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh to retreat further northwest and establish the village of Prophetstown near the confluence of the Wabash and Tippecanoe Rivers, land claimed by the Miami. Little Turtle told the Shawnee that they were unwelcome there, but the warnings were ignored. Tenskwatawa&#x27;s religious teachings became more widely known as they became more militant, and he attracted Native American followers from many different nations, including Shawnee, Iroquois, Chickamauga, Meskwaki, Miami, Mingo, Ojibwe, Odawa, Kickapoo, Lenape, Mascouten, Potawatomi, Sauk, Tutelo, and Wyandot.

In 1808, Tecumseh began to be seen as a leader by his community. In 1808, the British in Canada approached him to form an alliance, but he refused. The Americans first took notice of him in 1810. Tecumseh eventually emerged as the leader of the confederation, but it was built upon a foundation established by the religious appeal of his younger brother.

Prophetstown came to be the largest Native American community in the Great Lakes region and served as an important cultural and religious center. It was an intertribal, religious stronghold along the Wabash River in Indiana for 3000 Native Americans; it was known as Prophetstown to whites. Led by Tenskwatawa initially, and later jointly with Tecumseh, thousands of Algonquin-speaking Indians gathered at Tippecanoe to gain spiritual strength.

===Indiana Territory===

Meanwhile, in 1800, William Henry Harrison had become the governor of the newly formed Indiana Territory, with the capital at Vincennes. Harrison sought to secure title to Indian lands to allow for American expansion; in particular, he hoped that the Indiana Territory would attract enough white settlers so as to qualify for statehood. Harrison negotiated numerous land cession treaties with American Indians.

In 1809, Harrison began to push for another treaty to open more land for settlement. The Miami, Wea, and Kickapoo were vehemently opposed to selling any more land around the Wabash River. To influence those groups to sell the land, Harrison decided, against the wishes of President James Madison, to first conclude a treaty with the tribes willing to sell and use them to help influence those who held out. In September 1809, he invited the Potawatomi, Lenape, Eel River, and Miami to a meeting in Fort Wayne. In the negotiations, Harrison promised large subsidies and payments to the tribes if they would cede the lands for which he was asking.

Only the Miami opposed the treaty; they presented their copy of the Treaty of Greenville and read the section that guaranteed their possession of the lands around the Wabash River. They then explained the history of the region and how they had invited other tribes to settle in their territory as friends. The Miami were concerned that the Wea leaders were not present, although they were the primary inhabitants of the land being sold. The Miami also wanted any new land sales to be paid for by the acre, and not by the tract. Harrison agreed to make the treaty&#x27;s acceptance contingent on approval by the Wea and other tribes in the territory being purchased, but he refused to purchase land by the acre. He countered that it was better for the tribes to sell the land in tracts so as to prevent the Americans from only purchasing their best lands by the acre and leaving them only poor land on which to live.

After two weeks of negotiating, the Potawatomi leaders convinced the Miami to accept the treaty as reciprocity to the Potawatomi who had earlier accepted treaties less advantageous to them at the request of the Miami. Finally, the Treaty of Fort Wayne was signed on September 30, 1809, selling the United States over 3,000,000 acres (about 12,000 km2), chiefly along the Wabash River north of Vincennes. During the winter, Harrison was able to obtain the acceptance of the Wea by offering them a large subsidy. The Kickapoo were closely allied with the Shawnee at Prophetstown, and Harrison feared they would be difficult to sway. He offered the Wea an increased subsidy if the Kickapoo would also accept the treaty, causing the Wea to pressure the Kickapoo leaders to accept. By the spring of 1810, Harrison had completed negotiations and the Treaty of Fort Wayne was finalized.

==Conflict==
Tecumseh was outraged by the Treaty of Fort Wayne, and thereafter he emerged as a prominent political leader. Tecumseh revived an idea advocated in previous years by the Shawnee leader Blue Jacket and the Mohawk leader Joseph Brant, that American Indian land was owned in common by all tribes, and thus no land could be sold without agreement by all. Tecumseh knew that such &quot;broad consensus was impossible&quot;, but that is why he supported the position. Not yet ready to confront the United States directly, Tecumseh&#x27;s primary adversaries were initially the Native American leaders who had signed the treaty, and he threatened to kill them all.

Tecumseh began to expand on his brother&#x27;s teachings that called for the tribes to return to their ancestral ways, and began to connect the teachings with the idea of a pan-tribal alliance. Tecumseh began to travel widely, urging warriors to abandon the accommodationist chiefs and to join the resistance at Prophetstown.

Harrison was impressed by Tecumseh and even referred to him in one letter as &quot;one of those uncommon geniuses&quot;. Harrison thought that Tecumseh had the potential to create a strong empire if he went unchecked. Harrison suspected that he was behind attempts to start an uprising, and feared that if he were able to achieve a larger tribal federation, the British would take advantage of the situation to press their claims to the Northwest.

===Confrontation at Grouseland===
In August 1810, Tecumseh and 400 armed warriors traveled down the Wabash River to meet with Harrison in Vincennes. The warriors were all wearing war paint, and their sudden appearance at first frightened the soldiers at Vincennes. The leaders of the group were escorted to Grouseland, where they met Harrison. Tecumseh insisted that the Fort Wayne treaty was illegitimate. He asked Harrison to nullify it and warned that Americans should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty. Tecumseh acknowledged to Harrison that he had threatened to kill the chiefs who signed the treaty if they carried out its terms, and that his confederation was rapidly growing. Harrison responded to Tecumseh that the Miami were the owners of the land and could sell it if they so chose. He also rejected Tecumseh&#x27;s claim that all the Indians formed one nation, and insisted that each nation could have separate relations with the United States. As proof, Harrison told Tecumseh that the Great Spirit would have made all the tribes to speak one language if they were to be one nation.

Tecumseh launched an &quot;impassioned rebuttal&quot;, but Harrison was unable to understand his language. A Shawnee who was friendly to Harrison cocked his pistol from the sidelines to alert Harrison that Tecumseh&#x27;s speech was leading to trouble. Finally, an army lieutenant who could speak Tecumseh&#x27;s language warned Harrison that he was encouraging the warriors with him to kill Harrison. Many of the warriors began to pull their weapons and Harrison pulled his sword. The entire town&#x27;s population was only 1,000 and Tecumseh&#x27;s men could have easily massacred the town, but once the few officers pulled their guns to defend Harrison, the warriors backed down. Chief Winnemac, who was friendly to Harrison, countered Tecumseh&#x27;s arguments to the warriors and instructed them that because they had come in peace, they should return in peace and fight another day. Before leaving, Tecumseh informed Harrison that unless the treaty was nullified, he would seek an alliance with the British.

===Rising tensions===
Tensions continued to rise in the following year. Four settlers were murdered on the Missouri River, and in another incident, a boatload of supplies was seized by natives from a group of traders. Harrison summoned Tecumseh to Vincennes to explain the actions of his allies. In August 1811, Tecumseh met with Harrison at Vincennes, assuring him that the Shawnee brothers meant to remain at peace with the United States. Tecumseh then traveled to the south on a mission to recruit allies among the &quot;Five Civilized Tribes&quot;. Most of the southern nations rejected his appeals, but a faction among the Creeks, who came to be known as the Red Sticks, answered his call to arms, leading to the Creek War, which also became a part of the War of 1812. Tecumseh delivered many passionate speeches and convinced many to join his cause.

Having heard from intelligence that Tecumseh was far away, Governor Harrison sent this report to the Department of War, concerning Vincennes&#x27;s meeting, saying Tecumseh &quot;is now upon the last round to put a finishing stroke upon his work. I hope, however, before his return that part of the work which he considered complete will be demolished and even its foundation rooted up&quot;. Thereafter he acted accordingly.

As tensions rose, Harrison openly denounced Tenskwatawa as a fraud and a fool, enraging him. Tecumseh ordered his brother to take no action, but his brother continued to call for the death of Harrison. Tenskwatawa lifted the ban on firearms and was able to quickly procure them in large quantities from the British in Canada. Tecumseh made a strategic error by leaving him alone to travel to the south. Tenskwatawa took his brother&#x27;s absence as an opportunity to raise tensions even higher by further stirring up his followers.

===Expedition to the Prophetstown===


While Tecumseh was still in the south, Governor Harrison marched his army north along the Wabash River from Vincennes with more than 1,000 men on an expedition to intimidate the Prophet and his followers. His stated goal was to force them to accept peace, but he acknowledged that he would launch a pre-emptive attack on the natives if they refused. His army stopped near present-day Terre Haute to construct Fort Harrison to guard an important position on the Wabash River. While at Fort Harrison, Harrison received orders from Secretary of War William Eustis authorizing him to use force if necessary to disperse the Indians at Prophetstown.

On November 6, 1811, Harrison&#x27;s army arrived outside Prophetstown, and Tenskwatawa agreed to meet Harrison in a conference to be held the next day. Tenskwatawa, perhaps suspecting that Harrison intended to attack the village, decided to risk a pre-emptive strike, sending out about 500 of his warriors against the American encampment. Before the dawn of the next day, the Indians attacked, but Harrison&#x27;s men held their ground, and the Indians withdrew from the village after the battle. Despite the surprise attack, the victorious Americans burned Prophetstown the following day and returned to Vincennes. This ordeal is known as the Battle of Tippecanoe.

==Aftermath==
Harrison—and many subsequent historians—claimed that the Battle of Tippecanoe was a deathblow to Tecumseh&#x27;s confederacy. Harrison, thereafter nicknamed &quot;Tippecanoe&quot;, eventually became the President of the United States largely on the memory of this victory. The battle was a severe blow for Tenskwatawa, who lost prestige and the confidence of his brother. Although it was a significant setback, Tecumseh began to secretly rebuild the alliance upon his return from the south.

By December, most of the major American papers began to carry stories on the battle. Public outrage quickly grew and many Americans blamed the British for inciting the tribes to violence and supplying them with firearms. Andrew Jackson was among the forefront of men calling for war, claiming that Indians were &quot;excited by secret British agents&quot;. Other western governors called for action; William Blount of Tennessee called on the government to &quot;purge the camps of Indians of every Englishmen to be found...&quot; Acting on popular sentiment, Congress passed resolutions condemning the British for interfering in American domestic affairs. Tippecanoe fueled the worsening tension with Britain, culminating in a declaration of war only a few months later.

As the Americans went to war with the British, Tecumseh found British allies in Canada. Canadians would subsequently remember Tecumseh as a defender of Canada, but his actions in the War of 1812—which would cost him his life—were a continuation of his efforts to secure Native American independence from outside dominance. Tecumseh continued the struggle until his death in the 1813 Battle of Thames.

<text>El Cantar de mio Cid (, or &#x27;The Song of my Sidi (&#x27;lord&#x27;)&#x27;), or El Poema de mio Cid, also known in English as The Poem of the Cid, is the oldest preserved Castilian epic poem. Based on a true story, it tells of the deeds of the Castilian hero and knight in medieval Spain Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar—known as El Cid—and takes place during the eleventh century, an era of conflicts in the Iberian Peninsula between the Kingdom of Castile and various Taifa principalities of Al-Andalus. It is considered a national epic of Spain.

The work survives in a medieval manuscript which is now in the Spanish National Library.

== Origin ==
The Spanish medievalist Ramón Menéndez Pidal included the &quot;Cantar de mio Cid&quot; in the popular tradition he termed the &quot;mester de juglaría&quot;. &quot;Mester de juglaría&quot; refers to the medieval tradition according to which popular poems were passed down from generation to generation, being changed in the process. These poems were meant to be performed in public by minstrels (or juglares), who each performed the traditional composition differently according to the performance context—sometimes adding their own twists to the epic poems they told, or abbreviating them according to the situation.

&quot;El Cantar de mio Cid&quot; shows signs of being designed for oral transmission. For example, the poem ends with a request for wine for the person who has recited it (&quot;Es leido, dadnos del vino&quot;).
On the other hand, some critics (known as individualists) believe &quot;El Cantar de mio Cid&quot; was composed by one &quot;Per Abbad&quot; (in English, Abbot Peter) who appears to be credited as the writer of the work in a colophon to the text. It has been suggested that the poem, which is written in Old Spanish, is an example of the learned poetry that was cultivated in the monasteries and other centers of erudition. 
However, Per Abbad puts the date 1207 after his name and current thinking is that his claim to have written the work has simply been copied along with the text of an earlier manuscript now lost. The existing copy forms part of a 14th-century codex in the (National Library) in Madrid, Spain. It is, however, incomplete, missing the first page and two others in the middle. For the purposes of preservation, it is not normally on display.

There are sources that claim that the song was written several years earlier, considering the historical Cid died in 1099. These, however, recognize that the poem itself would not have been written immediately after the death of its titular hero since the narrative would not have been picked up if the story of the Cid had not yet attained its legendary status. There are those who also take into consideration the emergence of the Carolingian legends, which began after 1100 since it is believed that these stories also influenced the poem. &quot;The Poem of the Cid&quot;, for example, echoes the plot devices used in &quot;The Song of Roland&quot; epic.

==Title==
One of the oldest documents preserved at the &quot;Real Academia de la Historia&quot; in Madrid presents only this phrase as the poem&#x27;s title: &quot;Hic incipiunt gesta Roderici Campi Docti&quot;, which means &quot;Here begin the deeds of Rodrigo the Campeador.&quot; Its current title is a 19th-century proposal by Ramón Menéndez Pidal since its original title is unknown. Some merely call the poem &quot;El Poema del Cid&quot; on the grounds that it is not a &quot;cantar&quot; but a poem made up of three &quot;cantares&quot;. The title has been translated into English as &quot;The Lay of the Cid&quot; and &quot;The Song of the Cid&quot;. &quot;Mio Cid&quot; is literally &quot;My Cid&quot;, a term of endearment used by the narrator and by characters in the work. The word &quot;Cid&quot; originates from Arabic &quot;sidi&quot; or &quot;sayyid&quot; (سيد), an honorific title similar to English &quot;Sir&quot; (in the medieval, courtly sense).

The commonly used title &quot;El Cantar de mio Cid&quot; means literally &quot;The Song of my Lord&quot; or &quot;The Poem of my Lord&quot;. As the original title of the poem is lost to history, this one was suggested by historian Ramón Menéndez Pidal. It is Old Spanish (old Castilian), adjusted to modern orthography. In modern Spanish the title might be rendered &quot;El Poema de mi Señor&quot; or &quot;El Poema de mi Jefe&quot;. The expression &quot;cantar&quot; (literally &quot;to sing&quot;) was used to mean a &quot;chant&quot; or a &quot;song&quot;. The word &quot;Cid&quot; (&quot;Çid&quot; in old Spanish orthography), was a derivation of the dialectal Arabic word سيد &quot;sîdi&quot; or &quot;sayyid&quot;, which means &quot;lord&quot; or &quot;master&quot;. During the period the poem was written, Arabic was still a widely used and highly regarded language in Iberia (hence the fact that modern Spanish still contains many Arabic words). &quot;Çid&quot; was not a common word, though, in old Spanish and thus can be treated almost as a proper noun.

==The story==
El Cid married the cousin of King Alfonso VI, Doña Ximena, but for certain reasons (according to the story, he made the king swear by Santa Gadea that he had not ordered the fratricide of his own brother), he fell into the disfavor of the king and had to leave his home country of Castile. 

The story begins with the exile of El Cid, whose enemies had unjustly accused him of stealing money from the king, Alfonso VI of Castile and León, leading to his exile. To regain his honor, he participated in the battles against the Moorish armies and conquered Valencia. By these heroic acts he regained the confidence of the king and his honor was restored. The king personally marries El Cid&#x27;s daughters to the &quot;infantes&quot; (princes) of Carrión. However, when the princes are humiliated by El Cid&#x27;s men for their cowardice, the &quot;infantes&quot; swear revenge. They beat their new wives and leave them for dead. When El Cid learns of this he pleads to the king for justice. The &quot;infantes&quot; are forced to return El Cid&#x27;s dowry and are defeated in a duel, stripping them of all honor. El Cid&#x27;s two daughters then remarry to the &quot;principes&quot; (crown princes) of Navarre and Aragon. Through the marriages of his daughters, El Cid began the unification of Spain.

Unlike other European medieval epics, the tone is realist.
There is no magic, even the apparition of archangel Gabriel (verses 404–410) happens in a dream.
However, it also departs from historic truth: for example, there is no mention of his son, his daughters were not named Elvira and Sol and they did not become queens.

It consists of more than 3,700 verses of usually 14 through 16 syllables, each with a caesura between the hemistiches. The rhyme is assonant.

Since 1913, and following the work of Ramón Menéndez Pidal, the entire work is conventionally divided into three parts:

===&quot;Cantar del Destierro&quot; (verses 1–1086)===

El Cid is exiled from Castile by King Alfonso VI and fights against the Moors to regain his honor.

Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar is called Mío Cid (meaning &quot;My Lord&quot;) by the Moors. His current task is to collect the tributes from the Moorish territory owed to his king, Alfonso VI of León. Cid&#x27;s enemy accuses him of taking some of these tributes and the king exiles him from León and Castile. Before he leaves, he places his wife, Doña Ximena, and his two daughters, Doña Elvira and Doña Sol, in the Monastery of Cardeña. The canto then gives accounts of raids in the Moorish territory in which Cid and his men get rich off of the spoils.

===&quot;Cantar de las bodas de las hijas del Cid&quot; (verses 1087–2277)===
El Cid defends the city of Valencia, defeating King Chufa ibn Tashfin of the Almoravids. El Cid restores his honor and grants his daughters permission to marry the &quot;infantes&quot; of Carrión.

It begins with Cid&#x27;s capture of the city of Valencia. He brings his family to live with him. It is discovered that the Infantes (princes) de Carrión, the nephews to the king, are the enemies who caused Cid&#x27;s exile. They plot to marry his daughters to take some of his wealth. The king acts on behalf of his nephews and pardons Cid and allows the marriages. Cid suspects that something bad will happen from the marriages but he allows it anyway.

===&quot;Cantar de la Afrenta de Corpes&quot; (verses 2278–3730)===
The &quot;infantes&quot; of Carrión were put to shame after being scared of a lion roaming in the court and running away from a campaign to fight against the Moors. So, in revenge, they decide to abuse and abandon their wives at the roadside in Corpes, tied to trees. Once more, El Cid has to gain his honor back, so he asks the court of Toledo for justice. The &quot;infantes&quot; are defeated in a duel by El Cid&#x27;s men, and his daughters remarry to the &quot;infantes&quot; of Navarre and Aragon.

The Cantar shows that the Infantes are cowards in battles with the Moors. They are made fun of and decide to get revenge by attacking their wives. They set out for Carrión with their wives and an escort, Felix Muñoz, the cousin of the daughters. Once on the journey, they send the escort ahead of them, steal their wives&#x27; great dowries (including two beautiful swords) and beat them and leave them for dead. Muñoz suspects trouble and returns to his cousins and takes them to receive help. Cid seeks to right the wrongs done to his daughters, and a trial is held. A duel is held between some of Cid&#x27;s men and the Infantes in which the Infantes lose. In the middle of the trial, a message is sent from the kings of Navarra and Aragon, proposing to marry their sons to Cid&#x27;s daughters. These marriages take place after the defeat of the Infantes and near the end of the story.

==Authorship and composition date==
The linguistic analysis allows the reconstruction of a 12th-century previous text, which Ramón Menéndez Pidal dated &quot;circa&quot; 1140. Date and authorship are still open to debate. Certain aspects of the conserved text belong to a well-informed author, with precise knowledge of the law in effect by the end of the 12th century and beginning of the 13th, who knew the area bordering with Burgos.

==Extract==
These are the first two known stanzas. The format has been somewhat regularized (e.g., &quot;mio&quot; for &quot;myo&quot;, &quot;rr&quot; for &quot;R&quot;, &quot;ñ&quot; for &quot;n&quot;n&quot;&quot;, &quot;llorando&quot; for &quot;lorando&quot;, &quot;v&quot; for &quot;u&quot;, adding modern punctuation and capitalization):

:De los sos oios tan fuertemientre llorando,
:Tornava la cabeça e estavalos catando;
:Vio puertas abiertas e uços sin cañados,
:alcandaras vazias, sin pielles e sin mantos,
:e sin falcones e sin adtores mudados.
:Sospiro Mio Cid, ca mucho avie grandes cuidados.
:Fablo mio Cid bien e tan mesurado:
:«¡grado a ti, Señor Padre, que estas en alto!
:»Esto me an buelto mios enemigos malos.»

:Alli pienssan de aguiiar, alli sueltan las rriendas;
:ala exida de Bivar ovieron la corneia diestra
:e entrando a Burgos ovieronla siniestra.
:Meçio Mio Cid los ombros e engrameo la tiesta:
:«¡Albricia, Albar Fañez, ca echados somos de tierra!»
:[»Mas a grand ondra tornaremos a Castiella.»]

(The last verse is not in the original transcript by Per Abbat, but it was inserted by Menéndez Pidal because it appears in later chronicles, e.g., &quot;Veinte Reyes de Castilla (1344)&quot;.)

<text>Doc Daneeka is a fictional character in the 1961 novel &quot;Catch-22&quot; by Joseph Heller. 
Doc Daneeka is the squadron physician and a friend of the novel&#x27;s protagonist, Yossarian. &quot;Catch-22&quot; itself is first explained in the novel when Yossarian asks Doc Daneeka to excuse him from combat duty. Doc Daneeka is also the title of Chapter 4 of the novel.

==Character sketch==

===Motivations===
Doc Daneeka&#x27;s main motivation throughout is for his own welfare, if that be making money or protecting his own life. He generally forgets his moral duty as a physician except in the most extreme of circumstances.

===Goals===
Doc Daneeka&#x27;s goal before he is drafted into the war is to make a successful business out of his medical practice based in New York, he has stated that &quot;my most valuable medical tool is my cash register&quot;. He lies to the drafting board about his health in an attempt to avoid the war and become well-off, as the competition is drafted instead.

Once he is drafted his main goal is to get through the war alive. He is a hypochondriac who never gets ill, and is looking to avoid anything that would increase the risk to his life. He sees unnecessary risks to include displeasing his superiors for grounding crew and being shipped off to the Pacific Ocean, water and its ability to drown a man, and having to fly in a claustrophobic aircraft, which he likens to &quot;climbing back into the womb&quot;.

===Relationships and conflicts===
Doc Daneeka is regularly explaining to his good friend Yossarian why he cannot ground him, even though Yossarian helps him collect his flight pay without having to fly. His fears and the constraints of military bureaucracy prevent him from helping his friend. He shows unusual compassion to Yossarian after the death of Snowden.

Doc Daneeka feels the military is responsible for his being drafted into the war effort and put in harm&#x27;s way, because they were distrustful of him when he lied on his drafting papers about his health. He is constantly scared of upsetting his superiors who may see fit to then ship him off to the far more dangerous South Pacific. Already he sees it as military cruelty to have been assigned to the Air Corps even though he is scared of flying.

Doc Daneeka, as squadron physician, is meant to supervise Gus and Wes who run the medical tent. He generally shows little care for the way they run the tent, basically leaving the growing bureaucracy to decide who is ill enough to be sent to hospital, without reference to medical expertise. This climaxes when Gus and Wes pronounce Doc Daneeka dead at the medical tent against the obvious fact that he is standing alive in front of them.

Doc Daneeka finally falls foul of the bureaucratic processes that are central to &quot;Catch-22&quot;: when McWatt flies his plane into the mountain after he accidentally kills Kid Sampson, Doc Daneeka&#x27;s name is on McWatt&#x27;s crew manifest. Doc Daneeka was not on board the plane, but had an arrangement with McWatt to falsely record his name on the manifest so he could collect flight pay. Doc Daneeka attempts in vain to convince the bureaucracy that he is alive, but the process has already started. He tries to convince his wife that he is not dead, but fails. His wife gives up on him as his death leads to her financial benefit.

Doc Daneeka is forced to share a tent with Chief White Halfoat, whom he is scared of. He is also concerned that he will catch pneumonia from Chief White Halfoat, who is obsessed that he will soon die of pneumonia.

===Epiphanies===
During Milo&#x27;s bombing of the airbase and the death of Snowden, Doc Daneeka shows the compassion for others he lacks throughout the rest of the novel. During the bombing, Doc Daneeka risks his life by attending to the wounded in the field while bombs are still falling, and after Snowden&#x27;s death, he cleans up Yossarian and treats him for shock.

At the end, Doc Daneeka&#x27;s bureaucratic death convinces him that maybe he is, in fact, dead.

==Biographical summary==

===Actions in &quot;Catch-22&quot;===

====At home====
Doc Daneeka was a physician in his hometown of Staten Island, where he initially established a failing practice. As the war effort drafts in more medical personnel, Doc Daneeka&#x27;s surgery booms, especially with increased kickbacks from the local pharmacies and abortion referrals from the beauty parlors. This lucrative business comes to an end when the military catch up with him after he lies to the draft board about having one leg amputated and being bed-ridden with incurable rheumatoid arthritis.

Doc describes only one experience of his practice at home: a young newlywed couple who are unable to procreate. Doc finds out the girl is still a virgin and is cheeky when he asks about the medal of Saint Anthony that lies between her bosom, and the terrible temptation that this must be for Saint Anthony. When he asks the husband how often they have sex, he boasts &quot;Every night&quot;. Doc concludes they have no idea, and with the aid of two rubber models gives a demonstration of intercourse. They thank him for his help and go away to give it a try. Later, the husband returns and, punching him in the nose, cries, &quot;What are you, some kind of wise guy?&quot;

====In Pianosa====
Doc Daneeka appears as a petulant man, feeling beaten by the military for losing his advantage of being one of few doctors around back home. As a military doctor, Doc Daneeka has the ability to choose who of the pilots can be grounded from needing to fly more missions, and who must continue. Because of Colonel Cathcart&#x27;s competing attitude of increasing the missions every time the men meet the requirement, pilots with successful fruition grovel for Doc Daneeka to allow them grounding. Since Doc Daneeka is miserably sour for losing out on his business advantage, he takes it out on the men by not grounding any.

Doc Daneeka is a hypochondriac, who feels something must be physically wrong with himself. He also vainly attempts to remove himself from the military effort; he regularly approaches Gus and Wes, his two nurses, to perform routine physical and check his temperature, which invariably remains a constant, sub-average 96.8 degrees Fahrenheit.

===== Gus and Wes =====
Gus and Wes assist Doc Daneeka and take the responsibility for dealing with the majority of people who visit the medical tent where they have &quot;succeeded in elevating medicine to an exact science&quot;.

Their utilitarian method of dealing with any person presenting themselves at the medical tent is to take their temperature. Those with temperatures above 102 °F are sent to the hospital; those below 102° have their gums and toes painted purple with gentian violet solution and are given a laxative that is quickly disposed of in the bushes. Those with temperatures of exactly 102° are asked to return in an hour to have their temperatures taken again. The only exception to this is Yossarian, who normally runs a temperature of 101°, but who can go to the hospital whenever he wants because he is not afraid of them.

Gus and Wes appear to represent organizational functionaries that anyone who has had the misfortune of dealing with an impersonal bureaucracy should recognize.

====Why me?====
Doc Daneeka shows he has a total lack of empathy for anyone else and he can only think about his own unfortunate circumstances, characterised with his constant lament &quot;Why me?&quot; From bemoaning his loss of a lucrative medical business because he had lied on his drafting papers, to his complete lack of interest for those under his care that may result him being punished by is superiors if he did care. Even when Yossarian helps Doc Daneeka by allowing him to get his flight pay without actually doing the required number of flights (because he is scared of flying) he will not help:

&quot;You do a favor for me, I&#x27;ll do one for you. Get it?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Do one for me,&quot; Yossarian requested.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Not a chance,&quot; Doc Daneeka responded.

This is in total contrast to what might be expected of doctors following the Hippocratic Oath. The Doc does redeem himself, when during Milo&#x27;s bombing of the airbase, the Doc &quot;loses his head&quot; and works continuously in the field helping the wounded. Also he shows compassion to Yossarian after the death of Snowden over Avignon, by covering him in a blanket and cleaning up Snowden&#x27;s blood from Yossarian&#x27;s clothes.

===== Dr Stubbs =====
Dr Stubbs is the doctor in Dunbar&#x27;s squadron. Dr. Stubbs decides to try to confront the rules of Catch-22 by grounding any soldier who asks. Catch-22 cannot be beaten though, as the grounding orders are short-lived as they are rescinded by higher authorities and the soldiers are put back on duty. As punishment Dr Stubbs is transferred to the Pacific, which is one of Doc Daneeka&#x27;s greatest fears.

====Catch-22====
Yossarian is Doc Daneeka&#x27;s only friend on the base. Yossarian, like the other flying officers, continually begs for grounding, although he never successfully accomplishes the number of missions required. Nonetheless, he continues to ask. One day, while Yossarian explains his pitiful circumstances, Doc Daneeka becomes the first in the novel to detail the structured frameworking of what is formally known as &quot;Catch-22&quot;; a circular argument that prevents any of the men from removing themselves from combat:

There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one&#x27;s safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn&#x27;t, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn&#x27;t have to; but if he didn&#x27;t want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle. &lt;br&gt;
&quot;That&#x27;s some catch, that Catch-22,&quot; he [Yossarian] observed. &lt;br&gt;
&quot;It&#x27;s the best there is,&quot; Doc Daneeka agreed.

====&quot;Death&quot;====
One of his requisites of being an Air Corps doctor includes logging four hours per month of flight time in order to earn his flight pay. Since Doc Daneeka experiences fears of flight, he gets Yossarian to convince McWatt to add his name to his flight roster so that his hours are recorded, yet he does not need to leave the ground.

While McWatt performs a training flight, he flies too low, killing Kid Sampson on the raft. Because of his grief, McWatt immediately flies into a mountain and commits suicide. Since McWatt&#x27;s flight roster included Doc Daneeka&#x27;s name, the military blindly assumes and pronounces that Doc Daneeka also died on the flight. The irony, that Doc Daneeka was standing next to the Sergeant Knight who affirmed this tragedy, is further enforced when Doc Daneeka continues to argue that he did not die.

===== Mrs Daneeka =====
Corporal Whitcomb develops the idea of writing and sending home form letters of condolence from Colonel Cathcart to those who died or went missing in combat. To cover all circumstances, the letter reads as a vague letter that could imply any type of death of any form of relative. At home, Mrs Daneeka receives one of these form letters that her husband has died in combat. She later receives a check from his GI insurance for $250 to finance his funeral. She then continues to receive donations and other insurances that Doc Daneeka paid for. As the proceedings continue to accumulate, she later appears to be pleased that her husband is dead.

Doc Daneeka, enraged with the thickheadedness of the military, writes home two letters to his wife, Mrs Daneeka, addressed by himself. His wife feels uncertain after acquiring the first and asks if it is possible the military made a mistake, but is assured that the letter is simply the work of a &quot;sadistic and psychotic forger&quot;. Doc Daneeka futilely composes his second letter which she now believes to be a hoax. The book makes note that she and her children move to a new place; she leaves no forwarding address, and no further reference of her existence throughout the rest of the story.

Doc Daneeka&#x27;s last appearance in the story is in his tent with Yossarian and Chief White Halfoat, who is about to go up to the hospital to die of pneumonia. His last speech implies that he has accepted that he is bureaucratically a dead man:
:&#x27;He&#x27;s dead,&#x27; Chief White Halfoat gloated, with a horse laugh entangled in phlegm. &#x27;That&#x27;s really funny.&#x27;
:&#x27;I don&#x27;t even draw my pay any more.&#x27;
:&#x27;That&#x27;s really funny,&#x27; Chief White Halfoat repeated. &#x27;All this time he&#x27;s been insulting my liver, and look what happened to him. He&#x27;s dead. Killed by his own greed.&#x27;
:That&#x27;s not what killed me,&#x27; Doc Daneeka observed in a voice that was calm and flat. &#x27;There&#x27;s nothing wrong with greed. It&#x27;s all that lousy Dr. Stubbs&#x27; fault, getting Colonel Cathcart and Colonel Korn stirred up against flight surgeons. He&#x27;s going to give the medical profession a bad name by standing up for principle. If he&#x27;s not careful, he&#x27;ll be black-balled by his state medical association and kept out of the hospitals.&#x27;

Yossarian and Chief White Halfoat ignore him, acting as if he is not there. Doc Daneeka disappears from the story at this point.

==Major themes==
*Bureaucracy

Doc Daneeka&#x27;s bureaucratic death parallels one of the main themes of the book that the bureaucratic system holds an impersonal attitude toward those who do not hold power in the higher echelons of the military branch (colonels and generals). There is major irony in his death. The government goes so far to shield the military through political correctness on paper trails as to ignore the blatant, visual proof that Doc Daneeka did not die.

*Medical Ethics
*Catch-22
*Greed

==Film portraits==
Doc Daneeka was portrayed by Jack Gilford in the 1970 film adaptation of the novel directed by Mike Nichols. Grant Heslov played the character in the 2019 miniseries.

The miniseries diminishes his role. While he still is the one who informs Yossarian about Catch-22, he is not mistaken for being dead and actually does try to help him out in getting sent home, though this fails.

<text>Glyfada (, ) is a town and a suburb in the South Athens regional unit located in the Athens Riviera along the coast of Saronic Gulf. It is situated in the southern parts of the Athens urban area. The area stretches from the foot of the Hymettus mountain to the Saronic Gulf.

==History==
In ancient times, the area was a deme known as Aixone (). Today, Glyfada is packed with some of the capital&#x27;s best-known nightclubs, upscale restaurants and shops. It could be argued to be one of the most &quot;Americanized&quot; of Athenian municipalities, since an American airbase was located nearby until the early 1990s. The base&#x27;s population contributed in part to Glyfada&#x27;s character, leading to a unique blend of Greek and American atmosphere and cuisine. Although the base is now gone and the school relocated, Glyfada still retains part of its American flavor while continuing to offer distinctly Greek cuisine, entertainment and nightlife.

Glyfada was established as the heart of Athens&#x27; southern suburbs, because of its prime waterfront location, rich commercial center, and modern business district. It has been described as the headpoint of the &#x27;Athens Riviera&#x27; and features some of Europe&#x27;s most opulent seafront residences, gardens and extensive beachfront property, with a modern marina.

The town hall is located at the center of the municipality; nearby, Glyfada&#x27;s shopping district has one of the most vibrant and diversified commercial centers of Athens&#x27; neighborhoods, with a collection ranging across specialist and designer boutiques. Its proximity to a succession of Beaches and a concentrated seaside club scene also greatly increases the number of visitors during the summer months. The area&#x27;s shopping district runs across Metaxa Avenue and Grigoriou Labraki Street while both the offices of major businesses and shopping areas also dot the Avenues Vouliagmenis, Gounari and Gennimata.

At the beginning of the 20th century the town had already changed its name to &quot;Glyfada&quot;, a name given because of the presence of salt-water wells typical of this area.

==Transportation==

Glyfada is connected to central Athens via two major avenues (Poseidonos Avenue and Vouliagmenis Avenue) and a tram line operated by STASY S.A which goes across the seaside next to Poseidonos Avenue. An extension of the Line 2 of Athens Metro from Elliniko station to the south, with two stations in Ano Glyfada and Glyfada is being planned. A version of these plans includes a third station between Ano Glyfada and Glyfada stations.

==Municipality==
32,492 people registered with the Municipality of Glyfada voted during the Municipal Elections of October 2006. At the second round, 54.79% of the votes were for Thanasis Papakostas, who was the mayor of Glyfada for the 2006–2010 period.
Kostantinos Kokoris was just elected mayor. In 2014, George Papanikolaou was elected mayor in the Glyfada municipality.

==Geography==
The municipality has an area of 25.366 km2 and it is located in the Athens Riviera. Glyfada Marina includes marine space and coastal land area totaling , and a concrete land mass between basins A and B with a length of roughly , between basins B and G with a length of roughly , between basins G and D with a length of roughly , and between basin D until the end of the basin of roughly , with all harbor facilities and buildings found within this space.

Northwest is the golf course of Athens, the &quot;Glyfada Golf Club&quot;, located south of the former Ellinikon Airport. To the east and northeast there is an urban sprawl which spreads over the southwest shoulder of Mt. Hymettus and its rocky landscape.

===Climate===
There is no weather station in Glyfada with a history of at least thirty years to allow for a climate classification. Local extrapolations suggest that Glyfada has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate with mild winters and hot summers, with particularly warm summer nights. The driest months are during the summer while the rainiest period is during the autumn and early winter. See Elliniko climate for data from an official nearby weather station.

==Sports==
The Glyfada Indoor Hall is located at the Municipality, formerly a major indoor sport venue of local Athens teams. Glyfada is the seat of ANO Glyfada, club with many honours in Greek Water Polo and Glyfada F.C.

<text>Lord of Chaos is a fantasy novel by American author Robert Jordan, the sixth book of his series &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot;. It was published by Tor Books and released on October 15, 1994, and was nominated for the Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel in 1995. &quot;Lord of Chaos&quot; consists of a prologue, 55 chapters, and an epilogue. It is the first book of the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; to have an epilogue.

==Plot summary==

With many of the seals on his prison broken, the Dark One has grown in power. He causes global warming, revives the Forsaken Aginor and Balthamel as Osan&#x27;gar and Aran&#x27;gar, and creates Shaidar Haran, his Myrddraal incarnation.

In response to Rand al&#x27;Thor&#x27;s amnesty on male channelers, Mazrim Taim swears allegiance to him. Together they form the Black Tower, which trains male channelers called &quot;Asha&#x27;man&quot;. Rand is diplomatically courted by both the rebel Aes Sedai in Salidar, who send an envoy to Caemlyn, and the Aes Sedai of the White Tower, who send an envoy (many of which are in fact Black Ajah) to Cairhien. In an unsuccessful attempt to control Rand, Alanna Mosvani of the rebel Aes Sedai bonds Rand as her Warder against his will. Additionally, Min Farshaw, who had traveled with the Salidar Aes Sedai, reunites with Rand and gives him much-needed emotional support. Rand later discovers Salidar&#x27;s location and sends Mat Cauthon there, to retrieve Elayne Trakand who will rule Caemlyn and Cairhien in his stead.

Perrin Aybara leaves the Two Rivers to join Rand in Caemlyn.

The deposed Queen of Andor, Morgase Trakand, goes to Amadicia for aid in returning to the throne but is instead taken captive by the Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light, Pedron Niall.

In Salidar, Elayne and Nynaeve al&#x27;Meara have made numerous magical discoveries thanks to Moghedien, who they secretly hold in captivity. In a feat previously believed to be impossible even in the Age of Legends, Nynaeve Heals Siuan Sanche, Leane Sharif, and Logain Ablar, restoring their abilities to channel. Egwene al&#x27;Vere is named the Amyrlin of the rebel Aes Sedai and travels to Salidar through &quot;Tel&#x27;aran&#x27;rhiod&quot;. Upon arrival, she unofficially raises Nynaeve and Elayne to Aes Sedai and sends them and Aviendha to Ebou Dar to search for a &quot;ter&#x27;angreal&quot; called the &quot;Bowl of the Winds&quot; to break the Dark One&#x27;s control of the climate. Mat arrives at this time and reluctantly goes with them. After their departure, Egwene secretly arranges the escape of Logain, who then goes to the Black Tower. Aran&#x27;gar infiltrates Salidar and frees Moghedien.

Shortly after Perrin joins him, Rand is kidnapped by Elaida&#x27;s Aes Sedai, who torture him &quot;en route&quot; to Tar Valon. Learning of the kidnapping, Perrin leads Rand&#x27;s followers to the climactic Battle of Dumai&#x27;s Wells. At the end of the battle, the rebel Aes Sedai are forced to swear fealty to the Dragon Reborn while the surviving White Tower Aes Sedai remain captives.

<doc id="562259" wikidata="Q11758019" url="?curid=562259" title="List of eponymous diseases">
<text>An eponymous disease is a disease, disorder, condition, or syndrome named after a person, usually the physician or other health care professional who first identified the disease; less commonly, a patient who had the disease; rarely, a literary character who exhibited signs of the disease or an actor or subject of an allusion, as characteristics associated with them were suggestive of symptoms observed in the disorder.

==Naming systems==
Eponyms are a longstanding tradition in Western science and medicine. Being awarded an eponym is regarded as an honor: &quot;Eponymity, not anonymity, is the standard.&quot; The scientific and medical communities regard it as bad form to attempt to form eponyms after oneself.

Ideally, to discuss something, it should have a name. When medicine lacked diagnostic tools to investigate and definitively pinpoint the underlying causes of most diseases, assigning an eponym afforded physicians a concise label for a symptom cluster versus cataloguing the multiple systemic features that characterized a patient’s illness.

Most commonly, diseases are named for the person, usually a physician, but occasionally another health care professional, who first described the condition—typically by publishing an article in a respected medical journal. Less frequently, an eponymous disease is named after a patient, examples being Lou Gehrig disease and Hartnup disease. In the instance of Machado–Joseph disease, the eponym is derived from the surnames of two families in which the condition was initially described. Examples of eponyms named for persons who displayed characteristics attributed to a syndrome include: Lazarus syndrome, named for a biblical character; and Miss Havisham syndrome, named for a Dickens character, and Plyushkin syndrome, named for a Gogol character, both fictional persons (the latter two also happen to be alternative names for the same symptom complex). Two eponymous disorders that follow none of the foregoing conventions are: Fregoli delusion, which derives its name from an actor whose character shifts mimicked the delusion it describes; and, Munchausen syndrome which derives from a literary allusion to Baron von Munchausen, whose personal habits were suggestive of the symptom cluster associated with it.

Disease naming conventions which reference place names (such as Bornholm disease, Lyme disease, and Ebola virus disease) are properly termed toponymic, although an NLM/NIH online publication described them as eponymic. Diseases named for animals with which they are associated, usually as a vector, are properly styled as zoonymic; cat scratch fever and monkeypox are examples. Those named for association with a particular occupation or trade, examples of which include nun&#x27;s knee, tennis elbow, and mad hatter&#x27;s disease, are properly described as occupational diseases.

In May 2015, the World Health Organization, in collaboration with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), released a statement on the Best Practices for the Naming of New Human Infectious Diseases &quot;with the aim to minimize unnecessary negative impact of disease names on trade, travel, tourism or animal welfare, and avoid causing offence to any cultural, social, national, regional, professional or ethnic groups.&quot; These guidelines emerged in response to backlash against people and places, based on the vernacular names of infectious diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome, and the 2009 swine flu pandemic. These naming conventions are not intended to replace the International Classification of Diseases, but rather, are guidelines for scientists, national authorities, the national and international media and other stakeholders who may be the first to discuss a disease publicly.

==Punctuation==
In 1975, the Canadian National Institutes of Health held a conference that discussed the naming of diseases and conditions. This was reported in &quot;The Lancet&quot; where the conclusion was summarized as: &quot;The possessive use of an eponym should be discontinued, since the author neither had nor owned the disorder.&quot; Medical journals, dictionaries and style guides remain divided on this issue. European journals tend towards continued use of the possessive, while US journals are largely discontinuing its use. The trend in possessive usage varies between countries, journals, and diseases.

The problem is, in fact, that the possessive case was given its misleading name for historical reasons and that now even educated people, if they are not linguists, often make incorrect assumptions and decisions based on this misleading name. Nevertheless, no native speakers would accept the ungrammatical &quot;men department&quot; as a possible way of saying &quot;men&#x27;s department&quot; nor claim that this &quot;possessive&quot; and obligatory apostrophe in any way implies that men possess the department.

This case was called the genitive until the 18th century and (like the genitive case in other languages) in fact expresses much more than possession. For example, in the expressions &quot;the school&#x27;s headmaster&quot;, &quot;the men&#x27;s department&quot;, and &quot;tomorrow&#x27;s weather&quot;, the school does not own/possess the headmaster, men do not own/possess the department, and tomorrow does not/will not own the weather. Most disagreements about the use of possessive forms of nouns and of the apostrophe are due to the erroneous opinion that a term should not use an apostrophe if it does not express possession.

In the words of Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Dictionary of English Usage:
This dictionary also cites a study which found that only 40% of the possessive forms were used to indicate actual possession.

== Autoeponym == 
Associating an individual&#x27;s name with a disease merely based on describing it confers only an eponymic; the individual must have been either affected by the disease or have died from it for the name to be termed auto-eponymic. Thus, an &#x27;auto-eponym&#x27; is a medical condition named in honor of: a physician or other health care professional who was affected by or died as a result of the disease which he had described or identified; or, a patient, who was not a health care professional, but suffered from or died as a result of the disease. Auto-eponyms may use either the possessive or non-possessive form, with the preference to use the non-possessive form for a disease named for a physician or health care professional who first described it and the possessive form in cases of a disease named for a patient (commonly, but not always, the first patient) in whom the particular disease was identified. Autoeponyms listed in this entry conform to those conventions with regard to the possessive and non-possessive forms.

Examples of autoeponyms include:
* Rickettsiosis: in 1906, Howard Taylor Ricketts discovered that the bacteria that causes Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever is carried by a tick. He injected himself with the pathogen.
* Thomsen&#x27;s disease: an autosomal dominant myotonia of voluntary muscles described by Asmus Julius Thomas Thomsen about himself and his family members.
* Carrion disease: Peruvian medical student Daniel Alcides Carrión inoculated himself with &quot;Bartonella bacilliformis&quot; in 1885 to prove the link to this disease, characterized by &quot;Oroya fever&quot;. 
* Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease: although Gehrig, a New York Yankees player of the early twentieth century, was not the first patient described as having amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the association of such a prominent individual with the then little-known disease resulted in his name becoming eponymous with it.

==Eponyms and trends==
The current trend is away from the use of eponymous disease names and towards a medical name that describes either the cause or primary signs. Reasons for this include:

* A national or ethnic bias attaches to the eponym chosen;
* Credit should have gone to a different person;
* An eponym may be applied to different diseases, which creates confusion;
* Several eponyms refer to one disease (e.g., &quot;amyloid degeneration&quot; is variously called &quot;Abercrombie disease&quot;, &quot;Abercrombie syndrome&quot;, and &quot;Virchow syndrome&quot;);
* An eponym proves invalid (e.g., &quot;Laurence–Moon–Bardet–Biedl syndrome&quot;, in which findings in the patients of Laurence and Moon were later found to differ from those of Bardet and Biedl).
* An eponym honors an individual who has been otherwise discredited. An example is &quot;Wegener&#x27;s Granulomatosis&quot;; it was renamed granulomatosis with polyangiitis when Dr. Wegener was found to have had Nazi ties. 
* Its referent varies by country (e.g., &quot;sideropenic dysphagia&quot; is &quot;Plummer–Vinson syndrome&quot; in the US and Australia, &quot;Patterson–Kelly syndrome&quot; in the UK, and &quot;Waldenstrom–Kjellberg syndrome&quot; in Scandinavia).

Arguments for maintaining eponyms include:
* The eponym may be shorter and more memorable than the medical name (the latter requiring abbreviation to its acronym);
* The medical name proves to be incorrect;
* The syndrome may have more than one cause, yet it remains useful to consider it as a whole.
* It continues to respect a person who may otherwise be forgotten.

The usage of the genitive apostrophe in disease eponyms has followed different trends. While it remains common for some diseases, it has dwindled for others.

==Alphabetical list==
===Explanation of listing sequence===
As described above, multiple eponyms can exist for the same disease. In these instances, each is listed individually (except as described in item 1 below), followed by an in-line parenthetical entry beginning &#x27;aka&#x27; (&#x27;also known as&#x27;) that lists all alternative eponyms. This facilitates the use of the list for a reader who knows a particular disease only by one of its eponyms, without the necessity of cross-linking entries.

It sometimes happens that an alternative eponym, if listed separately, would immediately alphabetically precede or succeed another eponymous entry for the same disease. Three conventions have been applied to these cases:

:1. No separate entry appears for the alternative eponym. It is listed only in the parenthetical &#x27;aka&#x27; entry (e.g., Aarskog syndrome appears only as a parenthetical entry to Aarskog–Scott syndrome).
:2. If eponymous names subsequent to the first are sequenced differently or the eponym is differentiated by another term (e.g., disease versus syndrome), alphabetical sequence dictates which is the linked version versus which is listed as the alternative (e.g., Abderhalden–Kaufmann–Lignac is the linked entry and Abderhalden–Lignac–Kaufmann is the parenthetical alternative entry).
:3. If the number of names included in two or more eponyms varies, the linked entry is the one which includes the most individual surnames (e.g., Alpers–Huttenlocher syndrome is the linked entry for the disease also known as Alpers disease or Alpers syndrome).

Some eponyms have an alternative entry that includes the name(s) of additional individuals. An example is Adams-Stokes syndrome; one of its alternative eponyms is Gerbec–Morgagni–Adams–Stokes syndrome. The entry for Adams-Stokes only names the two individuals (Adams and Stokes) whose names are associated with the entry as listed; the later entry for the alternative Gerbec–Morgagni–Adams–Stokes syndrome names all four of the individuals (Gerbec, Morgani, Adams, and Stokes) who are associated with the longer named entry.

<text>The Anderton Boat Lift is a two-caisson lift lock near the village of Anderton, Cheshire, in North West England. It provides a vertical link between two navigable waterways: the River Weaver and the Trent and Mersey Canal. The structure is designated as a scheduled monument, and is included in the National Heritage List for England; it is also known as one of the Seven Wonders of the Waterways.

Built in 1875, the boat lift was in use for over 100 years until it was closed in 1983 due to corrosion. Restoration started in 2001 and the boat lift was re-opened in 2002. The lift and associated visitor centre and exhibition are operated by the Canal &amp; River Trust. It is one of only two working boat lifts in the United Kingdom; the other is the Falkirk Wheel in Scotland.

==Economic background==
Salt has been extracted from rock salt beds underneath the Cheshire Plain since Roman times. By the end of the 17th century a major salt mining industry had developed around the Cheshire &quot;salt towns&quot; of Northwich, Middlewich, Nantwich and Winsford.

Completion of the River Weaver Navigation in 1734 provided a navigable route for transporting salt from Winsford, through Northwich, to Frodsham, where the Weaver joins the River Mersey. The River Weaver Navigation Act 1759 (33 Geo. 2. c. 49) appointed the Trustees of the Weaver Navigation and gave them responsibility for maintaining and operating the route. The opening of the Trent and Mersey Canal in 1777 provided a second route close to the Weaver Navigation for part of its length, but extended further south to the coal mining and pottery industries around Stoke-on-Trent.

Rather than competing with each other the owners of the two waterways decided it would be more profitable to work together. In 1793 a basin was excavated on the north bank of the Weaver at Anderton that took the river to the foot of the escarpment of the canal – above. The Anderton Basin was owned and operated by the Weaver Navigation Trustees. Facilities were built to trans-ship goods between the waterways including two cranes, two salt chutes and an inclined plane that was possibly inspired by the much larger Hay Inclined Plane at Coalport. The facilities were extended when a second quay was built in 1801 and a second entrance to the basin was constructed in 1831.

==Planning and design==
By 1870 the Anderton Basin was a major interchange for trans-shipping goods in both directions, with extensive warehousing, three double inclined planes and four salt chutes. Trans-shipment was time-consuming and expensive, and the Trustees of the Weaver Navigation decided a link between the waterways was needed to allow boats to pass directly from one to the other. A flight of locks was considered but discarded, mainly because of the lack of a suitable site and the loss of water that would have resulted from using them. In 1870 the Trustees proposed a boat lift between the waterways at the Anderton Basin. The Trustees approached the North Staffordshire Railway Company, owners of the Trent and Mersey Canal, to ask for a contribution towards the cost. When this approach was unsuccessful the Trustees decided to fund the project themselves.
The Trustees asked their Chief Engineer, Edward Leader Williams, to draw up plans for a boat lift. He settled on a design involving a pair of water-filled caissons that would counterbalance one another and require relatively little power to lift boats up and down. A similar boat lift on the Grand Western Canal, completed in 1835, used chains to connect the caissons via an overhead balance wheel. It had a solid masonry superstructure to support the weight of the loaded caissons. Leader Williams realised that if he used water-filled hydraulic rams to support the caissons their weight would be borne by the rams and their cylinders, buried underground and a much lighter superstructure could be used. He may have been inspired by inspecting a hydraulic ship lift and graving dock at the Royal Victoria Dock in London, designed by experienced hydraulic engineer Edwin Clark.

Having decided on a hydraulic ram design Leader Williams appointed Edwin Clark as principal designer. At that time the Anderton Basin consisted of a cut on the north bank of the Weaver surrounding a small central island. Clark decided to build the boat lift on this island. The wrought iron caissons were long by wide by deep, and could each accommodate two narrowboats or a barge with a beam of up to . Each caisson weighed when empty and when full of water (because of displacement, the weight is the same with or without boats). Each caisson was supported by a single hydraulic ram consisting of a hollow long cast iron vertical piston with a diameter of , in a buried long cast iron vertical cylinder with a diameter of . At river level the caissons sat in a water-filled sandstone lined chamber. Above ground the superstructure consisted of seven hollow cast iron columns which provided guide rails for the caissons and supported an upper working platform, walkways and access staircase. At the upper level the boat lift was connected to the Trent and Mersey canal via a long wrought iron aqueduct, with vertical wrought iron gates at either end.

In normal operation the cylinders of the hydraulic rams were connected by a diameter pipe that allowed water to pass between them, thus lowering the heavier caisson and raising the lighter one. To make adjustments at the start and end of a lift either cylinder could be operated independently, powered by an accumulator or pressure vessel at the top of the lift structure, which was kept primed by a steam engine. If necessary, the steam engine and accumulator could operate either hydraulic ram independently to raise the caissons, although in this mode it took about 30 minutes to raise a caisson, as opposed to three minutes in normal operation.

==Construction==
In October 1871 the Weaver Navigation Trustees held a special general meeting which resolved &quot;to consider the desirability of constructing a lift with basins and all other requisite works for the interchange of traffic between the River Weaver and the North Staffordshire Canal at Anderton and of applying to Parliament for an Act to authorise the construction of such works.&quot;
In July 1872 royal assent was granted for the (35 &amp; 36 Vict. c. xcviii), which authorised the construction of the boat lift. The contract for its construction was awarded to Emmerson, Murgatroyd &amp; Co. of Stockport and Liverpool. Work started before the end of 1872 and took 30 months. The Anderton Boat Lift was formally opened to traffic on 26 July 1875. The total cost was £48,428 (£ at today&#x27;s prices).

==Problems of hydraulic operation==
For five years the boat lift operated successfully, the longest closures being during spells of cold weather when the canal froze over. In 1882 a cast iron hydraulic cylinder burst while the caisson it supported was at canal level with a boat in it. The caisson descended rapidly, but water escaping from the burst cylinder slowed the rate of descent and the water-filled dock at river level softened the impact. No-one was hurt and there was no damage to the lift&#x27;s superstructure. As a precaution, tests were carried out on the second hydraulic cylinder. During these tests the second cylinder failed too. As a result, the boat lift was closed for six months while sections of both cylinders were replaced and the connecting pipework, which was thought to have contributed to their failure, was redesigned.

The volume of traffic through the lift grew steadily through the 1880s and 90s but the hydraulic cylinders continued to cause problems. The gland of one cylinder (where the piston travelled through the cylinder wall) was temporarily repaired in 1887 and replaced in 1891, and the gland of the other cylinder was replaced in 1894. The main cause for concern was corrosion of the pistons. The use of canal water as a working fluid in the hydraulic system and the immersion of the pistons in the wet dock at river level led to corrosion and &quot;grooving&quot; of the pistons. Attempts to repair the grooves with copper made matters worse as it reacted electrolytically with the acidic canal water and hastened corrosion of the surrounding iron. In 1897 the lift was converted to use distilled water as its working fluid, slowing corrosion, but not stopping it completely. Over the next few years maintenance and repairs took place with increasing frequency, requiring complete closure of the lift for several weeks or a period of reduced and slower operation with a single caisson.

==Conversion to electrical operation==
By 1904 the Weaver Navigation Trustees faced the prospect of closing the boat lift for a considerable period to repair the hydraulic rams. They asked their Chief Engineer Colonel J. A. Saner, to investigate alternatives to hydraulic operation. Saner proposed electric motors and a system of counterweights and overhead pulleys that would allow the caissons to operate independently of each other. Although this solution involved many more moving parts than the hydraulic system these would be above ground and accessible thus making maintenance easier and cheaper and have a longer working life. Other advantages of the conversion listed by Saner included a reduction in the number of operating attendants by one and the avoidance of costly boiler repairs. Saner promised to achieve the conversion with only three short periods of closure to traffic. This was important because it minimised disruption to traffic and the loss of revenue during conversion.
As a result, the weight of the caissons and counterweights would now be borne by the lift superstructure instead of by the rams. The superstructure was therefore strengthened and put on stronger foundations. The new superstructure was built around the original lift frame in order to avoid the need to dismantle the original lift, which would have taken it out of service for a long period. The new superstructure consisted of ten steel A-frames, five on each side, supporting a machinery deck 60 ft (18 m) above the river level where the electric motors, drive shafts and cast-iron headgear pulleys were mounted. Wire ropes attached to both sides of each caisson passed over the pulleys to 36 cast iron counterweights weighing each, 18 on each side to balance the weight of each loaded caisson. The electric motor had to overcome friction between the pulleys and their bearings. A motor was installed, but normal operation only required about half of this power.

In addition to the new foundations and superstructure, the wet dock at river level was also converted into a dry dock and the aqueduct between the lift and the canal was strengthened. The original caissons were retained but were modified to take the wire ropes that now supported them on each side.

Conversion was carried out between 1906 and 1908. As Saner had promised, the lift was only closed for three periods during these two years, for a total of 49 days. The converted lift was formally opened on 29 July 1908 (although one caisson had been carrying traffic on electrical power since May 1908 while the second caisson was converted).

==Operation after conversion==
After conversion to electrical operation the boat lift was operated successfully for 75 years. Regular maintenance was still necessary; for example, the wire ropes supporting the caissons suffered from fatigue from the repeated bending and straightening as they ran over the overhead pulleys and had to be replaced frequently. However, maintenance was simpler than before the conversion because the mechanism of the electrical lift was above ground. Maintenance was also less expensive because the caissons were now designed to be run independently, allowing most maintenance to be carried out while one caisson remained operational and thus avoiding the need to close the lift entirely.

During 1941 and 1942 the hydraulic rams of the original lift, which had been left in place in a shaft beneath the dry dock, were removed to salvage the iron. During the 1950s and 1960s commercial traffic on British canals declined. By the 1970s the lift&#x27;s traffic was almost entirely recreational and the lift was hardly used during winter months.

The new superstructure was susceptible to corrosion and the entire lift was painted with a protective solution of tar and rubber that had to be renewed every eight years or so. In 1983, during repainting, extensive corrosion was found in the superstructure and it was declared structurally unsound and closed.

==Restoration==
During the 1990s British Waterways carried out preliminary investigations before launching a restoration bid. It was originally intended to restore the lift to electrical operation but after consultation with English Heritage, in 1997 it was decided to restore the lift to hydraulic operation using hydraulic oil.

To raise the £7 million restoration cost, a partnership was forged between the Waterways Trust, the Inland Waterways Association, the Anderton Boat Lift Trust, the Friends of Anderton Boat Lift, the Association of Waterways Cruising Clubs, British Waterways and the Trent and Mersey Canal Society. Heritage Lottery Funding contributed £3.3 million, and more than 2,000 individuals contributed to the scheme, raising a further £430,000.

Restoration commenced in 2000 and the lift was re-opened to boat traffic in March 2002. The site now includes a two-storey visitor centre and exhibition building with a coffee shop and information and films about the history of the lift. The visitor centre incorporates the new lift control centre. Although a modified version of the original hydraulic system was reinstated, the 1906–08 external frame and pulleys have been retained in a non-operational role. The weights that used to counterbalance the caissons were not rehung, but have been used to build a maze in the grounds of the visitor centre.

Further restoration work is now planned starting in mid-2025 and continuing for 12–18 months. During this time, the lift will be closed.

<doc id="562270" wikidata="Q1265755" url="?curid=562270" title="The Theory of the Leisure Class">
<text>The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions (1899), by Thorstein Veblen, is a treatise of economics and sociology, and a critique of conspicuous consumption as a function of social class and of consumerism, which are social activities derived from the social stratification of people and the division of labor; the social institutions of the feudal period (9th–15th c.) that have continued to the modern era. 

Veblen discusses how the pursuit and the possession of wealth affects human behavior, that the contemporary lords of the manor, the businessmen who own the means of production, have employed themselves in the economically unproductive practices of conspicuous consumption and conspicuous leisure, which are useless activities that contribute neither to the economy nor to the material production of the useful goods and services required for the functioning of society. Instead, it is the middle class and working class who are usefully employed in the industrialised, productive occupations that support the whole of society.

==Background==
&quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; (1899) was published during the Gilded Age (1870–1900), the time of the robber baron millionaires John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and Cornelius Vanderbilt, at the end of the 19th century. Veblen presents the evolutionary development of the social and economic institutions of society, wherein technology and the industrial arts are the creative forces of economic production. That in the economics of the production of goods and services, the social function of the economy was to meet the material needs of society and to earn profits for the owners of the means of production. Sociologically, that the industrial production system required the workers (men and women) to be diligent, efficient, and co-operative, whilst the owners of the factories concerned themselves with profits and with public displays of wealth; thus the contemporary socio-economic behaviours of conspicuous consumption and of conspicuous leisure survived from the predatory, barbarian past of the tribal stage of modern society.

The sociology and economics reported in &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; show the influences of Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, Adam Smith, and Herbert Spencer; thereby Veblen&#x27;s socio-economic theory emphasizes social evolution and development as characteristics of human institutions. In his time, Veblen criticised contemporary (19th-century) economic theories as intellectually static and hedonistic, and that economists should take account of how people actually behave, socially, and culturally, rather than rely upon the theoretic deduction meant to explain the economic behaviours of society. As such, Veblen&#x27;s reports of American political economy contradicted the (supply and demand) neoclassical economics of the 18th century, which define people as rational agents who seek utility and maximal pleasure from their economic activities; whereas Veblen&#x27;s economics define people as irrational economic agents who disregard personal happiness in the continual pursuit of the social status and the prestige inherent to having a place in society (class and economic stratum). Veblen concluded that conspicuous consumption did not constitute social progress, because American economic development was unduly influenced by the static economics of the British aristocracy; therefore, conspicuous consumption was an un-American activity contrary to the country&#x27;s dynamic culture of individualism.

Originally published as &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study in the Evolution of Institutions&quot;, the book arose from three articles that Veblen published in the &quot;American Journal of Sociology&quot; between 1898 and 1899: (i) &quot;The Beginning of Ownership&quot; (ii) &quot;The Barbarian Status of Women&quot;, and (iii) &quot;The Instinct of Workmanship and the Irksomeness of Labour&quot;. These works presented the major themes of economics and sociology that he later developed in works such as: &quot;The Theory of Business Enterprise&quot; (1904), about how incompatible are the pursuit of profit and the making of useful goods; and &quot;The Instinct of Workmanship and the State of the Industrial Arts&quot; (1914), about the fundamental conflict between the human predisposition to useful production and the societal institutions that waste the useful products of human effort.

Moreover, &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; is a socio-economic treatise that resulted from Veblen&#x27;s observation and perception of the United States as a society of rapidly developing economic and social institutions. Critics of his reportage about the sociology and economics of the consumer society that is the US especially disliked the satiric tone of his literary style, and said that Veblen&#x27;s cultural perspective had been negatively influenced by his austere boyhood in a Norwegian American community of practical, thrifty, and utilitarian people who endured anti-immigrant prejudices in the course of integration to American society.

==Thesis==

=== Concepts ===
In &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; Veblen coined the following sociology terms:

* Leisure class — members of the upper class who are exempt from productive work.
* Pecuniary superiority — the leisure class demonstrate their economic superiority by not working.
* Pecuniary emulation — the economic effort to exceed someone else&#x27;s socio-economic status.
* Pecuniary struggle — the acquisition and exhibition of wealth in order to gain social status.
* Vicarious leisure — the leisure of wives and servants as evidence of the wealth of the lord of the manor
* Estranged leisure — the leisure of servants is realised in behalf of the lord of the manor.

=== The stratified society ===
&quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; established that the political economy of a modern society is based upon the social stratification of tribal and feudal societies, rather than upon the merit and social utility and economic utility of individual men and women. Veblen&#x27;s examples indicate that many economic behaviours of contemporary society derive from corresponding tribal-society behaviours, wherein men and women practiced the division of labor according to their status group; high-status people practiced hunting and warfare, which are economically unproductive occupations, whilst low-status people practiced farming and manufacturing, which are economically productive occupations. In a socially-stratified society, the &quot;leisure class&quot; are the members of the upper class who are exempt from productive work.

==== (i) Occupation ====
The concepts of dignity and Self-worth and Honour are the bases of the development of social class and distinctions of type among the social classes; thus, by way of social stratification, productive labor came to be seen as disreputable. Therefore, the accumulation of wealth does not confer social status, as does the evidence of wealth, such as leisure. In a stratified society, the division of labor inherent to the barbarian culture of conquest, domination, and the exploitation of labour featured labour-intensive occupations for the conquered people, and light-labour occupations for the conquerors, who thus became &quot;the leisure class&quot;. In that societal context, although low-status, productive occupations (tinker, tailor, chandler) were of greater economic value to society than were high-status, unproductive occupations (the profession of arms, the clergy, banking, etc.), for social cohesion, the leisure class occasionally performed productive work that was more symbolic than practical.

The leisure class engaged in displays of pecuniary superiority by not working and by the:

# Accumulation of property and material possessions
# Accumulation of immaterial goods — high-level education, a family crest
# Adoption of archaic social skills — manners and etiquette, chivalry and a code of conduct
# Employment of servants

==== (ii) Economic utility ====
In exercising political control, the leisure class retained their high social-status by direct and indirect coercion, by reserving for themselves the profession of arms, and so withheld weapons and military skills from the lower social classes. Such a division of labor (economic utility) rendered the lower classes dependent upon the leisure class, which established, justified, and perpetuated the role of the leisure class as the defenders of society against natural and supernatural enemies, because the clergy also belonged to the leisure class.

Contemporary society did not psychologically supersede the tribal-stage division of labor, but evolved the division-of-labor by social status and social stratum. During the Mediæval period (5th–15th c.) only land-owning noblemen had the right to hunt and to bear arms as soldiers; status and income were parallel. Likewise, in contemporary society, skilled laborers of the working class are paid an income in wages, which is inferior to the salary income paid to the educated managers whose economic importance (as engineers, salesmen, personnel clerks, &quot;et al.&quot;) is indirectly productive; income and status are parallel.

==== (iii) Pecuniary emulation ====
The term &quot;pecuniary emulation&quot; describes a person&#x27;s economic efforts to surpass a rich person&#x27;s socio-economic status. Veblen said that the &quot;pecuniary struggle&quot; to acquire and exhibit wealth, in order to gain status, is the driving force behind the development of culture and society. To attain, retain, and gain greater social status within their social class, low-status people emulate the high-status members of their socio-economic class, by consuming over-priced brands of goods and services perceived to be of better quality and thus of a higher social-class. In striving for greater social status, people buy high-status goods and services which they cannot afford, despite the availability of affordable products that are perceived as of lower quality and lesser social prestige, and thus of a lower social class. In a consumer society, the businessman was the latest member of the leisure class, a barbarian who used his prowess (business acumen) and competitive skills (marketing) to increase profits, by manipulating the supply and the demand among the social classes and their strata, for the same products (goods and services) at different prices.

=== Contemporary consumerism ===

* The subjugation of women — Women originally were spoils of war captured by raiding barbarians. In contemporary society, the unemployed housewife is an economic trophy that attests to a man&#x27;s socio-economic prowess. In having a wife without an independent economic life (a profession, a trade, a job) a man can display her unemployed status as a form of his conspicuous leisure and as an object of his conspicuous consumption.
* The popularity of sport — American football is sociologically advantageous to community cohesion; yet, in itself, sport is an economic side-effect of conspicuous leisure that wastes material resources.
* Devout observances — Organized religion is a type of conspicuous leisure (wasted time) and of conspicuous consumption (wasted resources); a social activity of no economic consequence, because a church is an unproductive use of land and resources, and clergy (men and women) do unproductive work.
* Social formalities — social manners are remnant barbarian behaviours, such as paying respect to one&#x27;s socially powerful betters. In itself, etiquette has little value (practical or economic), but is of much social value as cultural capital, which identifies, establishes, and enforces &quot;distinctions of place&quot; (social stratum) within a social class.

==Overview==
=== Conspicuous economics ===

With &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study in the Evolution of Institutions&quot; (1899), Veblen introduced, described, and explained the concepts of &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; and of &quot;conspicuous leisure&quot; to the nascent, academic discipline of sociology. Conspicuous consumption is the application of money and material resources towards the display of a higher social status (e.g. silver flatware, custom-made clothes, an over-sized house); and conspicuous leisure is the application of extended time to the pursuit of pleasure (physical and intellectual), such as sport and the fine arts. Therefore, such physical and intellectual pursuits display the freedom of the rich man and woman from having to work in an economically productive occupation.

=== Theses ===
*Chapter I: Introductory
The modern industrial society developed from the barbarian tribal society, which featured a leisure class supported by subordinated working classes employed in economically productive occupations. The people of the leisure class were exempted from manual work and from practicing economically productive occupations, because they belong to the leisure class.

*Chapter II: Pecuniary Emulation
The emergence of a leisure class coincides with the beginning of ownership, initially based upon marriage as a form of ownership — of women and their chattel property — as evidence of prowess. As such, the material consumption of the leisure class has little to do with either comfort or subsistence, and much to do with social esteem from the community, and thus with self-respect.

*Chapter III: Conspicuous Leisure
Among the lower social classes, a man&#x27;s reputation as a diligent, efficient, and productive worker is the highest form of pecuniary emulation of the leisure class available to him in society. Yet, among the social strata of the leisure class, manual labor is perceived as a sign of social and economic weakness; thus, the defining, social characteristics of the leisure class are the exemption from useful employment and the practice of conspicuous leisure as a non-productive consumption of time.

*Chapter IV: Conspicuous Consumption
Theoretically, the consumption of luxury products (goods and services) is limited to the leisure class, because the working classes have other, more important, things and activities on which to spend their limited income, their wages. Yet, such is not the case, because the lower classes consume expensive alcoholic beverages and narcotic drugs. In doing so, the working classes seek to emulate the standards of life and play of the leisure class, because they are the people at the head of the social structure in point of reputability. In that emulation of the leisure class, social manners are a result of the non-productive, consumption of time by the upper social classes; thus the social utility of conspicuous consumption and of conspicuous leisure lies in their wastefulness of time and resources.

*Chapter V: The Pecuniary Standard of Living
In a society of industrialised production (of goods and services), the habitual consumption of products establishes a person&#x27;s standard of living; therefore, it is more difficult to do without products than it is to continually add products to one&#x27;s way of life. Moreover, upon achieving self-preservation (food and shelter), the needs of conspicuous waste determine the economic and industrial improvements of society.

*Chapter VI: Pecuniary Canons of Taste
To the leisure class, a material object becomes a product of conspicuous consumption when it is integrated to the canon of honorific waste, by being regarded either as beautiful or worthy of possession for itself. Consequently, to the lower classes, possessing such an object becomes an exercise in the pecuniary emulation of the leisure class. Therefore, an &quot;objet d&#x27;art&quot; made of precious metal and gemstones is a more popular possession than is an object of art made of equally beautiful, but less expensive materials, because a high price can masquerade as beauty that appeals to the sense of social prestige of the possessor-consumer.

*Chapter VII: Dress as an Expression of the Pecuniary Culture
In a consumer society, the function of clothes is to define the wearer as a man or as a woman who belongs to a given social class, not for protection from the environment. Clothing also indicates that the wearer&#x27;s livelihood does not depend upon economically productive labor, such as farming and manufacturing, which activities require protective clothing. Moreover, the symbolic function of clothes indicates that the wearer belongs to the leisure class, and can afford to buy new clothes when the fashion changes.

*Chapter VIII: Industrial Exemption and Conservatism
A society develops through the establishment of institutions (social, governmental, economic, etc.) modified only in accordance with ideas from the past, in order to maintain societal stability. Politically, the leisure class maintain their societal dominance, by retaining out-dated aspects of the political economy; thus, their opposition to socio-economic progressivism to the degree that they consider political conservatism, nationalism, and political reaction as honorific features of the leisure class.

*Chapter IX: The Conservation of Archaic Traits
The existence of the leisure class influences the behaviour of the individual man and woman, by way of social ambition. To rise in society, a person from a lower class emulates the characteristics of the desired upper class; he or she assumes the habits of economic consumption and social attitudes (archaic traits of demeanour in speech, dress, and manners). In pursuit of social advancement, and concomitant social prestige, the man and the woman who rid themselves of scruple and honesty will more readily rise into a stratum of the leisure class.

*Chapter X: Modern Survivals of Prowess
As owners of the means of production, the leisure class benefit from, but do not work in, the industrial community, and do not materially contribute to the commonweal (the welfare of the public) but do consume the goods and services produced by the working classes. As such, the individual success (social and economic) of a person derives from his or her astuteness and ferocity, which are character traits nurtured by the pecuniary culture of the consumer society.

*Chapter XI: The Belief in Luck
The belief in the concept of &#x27;luck&#x27; (Fortuna) is one reason why people gamble; likewise follows the belief that luck is a part of achieving socio-economic success, rather than the likelier reason of social connections derived from a person&#x27;s social class and social stratum. Within the social strata of the leisure class, the belief in luck is greater in the matter of sport (wherein physical prowess does matter) because of personal pride, and the concomitant social prestige; hence, gambling is a display of conspicuous consumption and of conspicuous leisure. Nonetheless, gambling (the belief in luck) is a social practice common to every social class of society.

*Chapter XII: Devout Observances
The existence, function, and practice of religion in a socially-stratified society, is a form of abstract conspicuous consumption for and among the members of the person&#x27;s community, of devotion to the value system that justifies the existence of his or her social class. As such, attending church services, participating in religious rites, and paying tithes, are a form of conspicuous leisure.

*Chapter XIII: Survivals of the Non-invidious Interest
The clergy and the women who are members of the leisure class function as objects of vicarious leisure, thus, it is morally impossible for them to work and productively contribute to society. As such, maintaining a high social-class is more important for a woman of the leisure class, than it is for a man of the leisure class. Women, therefore, are the greatest indicators of a man&#x27;s socio-economic standing in his respective community. In a consumer society, how a woman spends her time and what activities she does with her time communicate the social standing of her husband, her family, and her social class.

*Chapter XIV: The Higher Learning as an Expression of the Pecuniary Culture
Education (academic, technical, religious) is a form of conspicuous leisure, because it does not directly contribute to the economy of society. Therefore, high-status, ceremonial symbols of book-learning, such as the gown and mortar-board-cap of the university graduate educated in abstract subjects (science, mathematics, philosophy, etc.) are greatly respected, whereas certificates, low-status, ceremonial symbols of practical schooling (technology, manufacturing, etc.) are not greatly respected to the same degree, because the contemporary university is a leisure-class institution.

==Criticism and critique==
===Literary style===
In &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot;, Veblen used idiosyncratic and satirical language to identify, describe, and explain the consumerist mores of American modern society in the 19th century; thus, about the impracticality of etiquette as a form of conspicuous leisure, Veblen said:

In contrast, Veblen used objective language in &quot;The Theory of Business Enterprise&quot; (1904), which analyses the business-cycle behaviours of businessmen. In his introduction to the 1973 edition, the economist John Kenneth Galbraith said that &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; is Veblen&#x27;s intellectual put-down of American society. That Veblen spoke satirically in order to soften the negative implications of his socio-economic analyses of the U.S. social-class system, facts that are more psychologically threatening to the American ego and the &quot;status quo&quot;, than the negative implications of Karl Marx&#x27;s analyses. That, unlike Marx, who asserted capitalism as superior to feudalism in providing products (goods and services) for mass consumption, Veblen did not recognise such a distinction. For him capitalism was one form of economic barbarism, and that goods and services produced for conspicuous consumption are fundamentally worthless.

In the Introduction to the 1967 edition of &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot;, economist Robert Lekachman said that Veblen was a misanthrope:

=== 19th century ===
The success of &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; (1899) derived from the fidelity, veracity, and accuracy of Veblen&#x27;s reportage about the socio-economic behaviours of the American system of social classes. Additional to the success (financial, academic, social) accrued to him by the book, a social-scientist colleague told Veblen that the sociology of gross consumerism catalogued in &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; had much &quot;fluttered the dovecotes of the East&quot;, especially in the Ivy League academic Establishment.

In the two-part book review &quot;An Opportunity for American Fiction&quot; (April–May 1899), the critic William Dean Howells made Veblen&#x27;s treatise the handbook of sociology and economics for the American intelligentsia of the early 20th century. Reviewing first the economics and then the social satire in &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot;, Howells said that social-class anxiety impels American society to wasteful consumerism, especially the pursuit of social prestige. That despite social classes being alike in most stratified societies, the novelty of the American social-class system was that the leisure class had only recently appeared in U.S. history.

Asking for a novelist to translate into fiction what the social-scientist Veblen had reported, Howells concluded that a novel of manners was an opportunity for American fiction to accessibly communicate the satire in &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot;: 

In the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot; (September 1899), the book reviewer John Cummings said:
As a contribution to the general theory of sociology, Dr. Veblen&#x27;s &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; requires no other commendation for its scholarly performance than that which a casual reading of the work readily inspires. Its highly original character makes any abridgement of it exceedingly difficult and inadequate, and such an abridgement cannot be even attempted here ... The following pages, however, are devoted to a discussion of certain points of view in which the author seems, to the writer [Cummings], to have taken an incomplete survey of the facts, or to have allowed his interpretation of facts to be influenced by personal animus.

=== 20th century ===
In the essay &quot;Prof. Veblen&quot; (1919) the intellectual H. L. Mencken addressed the matters of Americans&#x27; social psychology reported in &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; (1899), by asking:

In the essay &quot;The Dullest Book of The Month: Dr. Thorstein Veblen Gets the Crown of Deadly Nightshade&quot; (1919), after addressing the content of &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot;, the book reviewer Robert Benchley addressed the subject of who are readers to whom Veblen speaks, that:the Doctor has made one big mistake, however. He has presupposed, in writing this book, the existence of a [social] class with much more leisure than any class in the world ever possessed—for, has he not counted on a certain number of readers?
In the Introduction to the 1934 edition, the economist Stuart Chase said that the Great Depression (1929–1941) had vindicated Veblen the economist, because &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; had unified &quot;the outstanding economists of the world&quot;. In the foreword to the 1953 edition, sociologist C. Wright Mills said that Veblen was &quot;the best critic of America that America has ever produced&quot;. In the Introduction to the 1973 edition of the book, economist John Kenneth Galbraith addressed the author as subject, and said that Veblen was a man of his time, and that &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot;—published in 1899—reflected Veblen&#x27;s 19th-century world view. That in his person and personality, the social scientist Veblen was neglectful of his grooming and tended to be disheveled; that he suffered social intolerance for being an intellectual and an agnostic in a society of superstitious and anti-intellectual people, and so tended to curtness with less intelligent folk.

John Dos Passos writes of Veblen in his trilogy novel &quot;U.S.A&quot;, in the third novel (1933), &quot;The Big Money.&quot; There, as one of Passos&#x27; highly subjective portraits of historical figures throughout the trilogy, Veblen is bio-sketched in THE BITTER DRINK in about 10 pages, referring presumably in that title to the hemlock Socrates was forced to drink for his supposed crimes. The portrait ends with these three final lines: &quot;but his memorial remains/riveted into the language/the sharp clear prism of his mind.&quot; 
In &quot;The Worldly Philosophers: The Lives, Times, and Ideas of the Great Economic Thinkers&quot; (1953), the historian of economics Robert Heilbroner said that Veblen&#x27;s socio-economic theories applied to the Gilded Age (1870–1900) of gross materialism and political corruption in the U.S. of the 19th century, but are inapplicable in 21st-century economics, because &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; is specific to U.S. society in general, and to the society of Chicago in particular. In that vein, in &quot;No Rest for the Wealthy&quot; (2009), the journalist Daniel Gross said:

<text>Bearsden and Milngavie () was, from 1975 to 1996, one of nineteen local government districts in the Strathclyde region of Scotland, covering an area north of the City of Glasgow.

==History==
The district was created in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which established a two-tier structure of local government across mainland Scotland comprising upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Bearsden and Milngavie was one of nineteen districts created within the region of Strathclyde. The district covered the whole of two former districts and part of a third from the historic county of Dunbartonshire, all of which were abolished at the same time:
*Bearsden Burgh
*Milngavie Burgh
*Old Kilpatrick District: the landward (outside a burgh) part of the parish of New Kilpatrick

The district was abolished in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 which replaced regions and districts with unitary council areas. The Bearsden and Milngavie area merged with most of neighbouring Strathkelvin district to become the East Dunbartonshire council area.

==Political control==
The first election to the district council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 16 May 1975. Political control of the council from 1975 was as follows:

===Elections===
Elections were held as follows:


==Premises==
The council was based at Boclair, 100 Milngavie Road, Bearsden. The building had been built in 1890–1891 as a care home called the Buchanan Retreat. It had then been bought by the old Bearsden Town Council in 1960 and converted into that council&#x27;s headquarters, being formally opened by Princess Margaret on 31 May 1962. The building passed to the new Bearsden and Milngavie District Council when it was created in 1975 and remained that council&#x27;s headquarters throughout its existence. On the abolition of Bearsden and Milngavie District Council in 1996 the building passed to the new East Dunbartonshire Council, which initially used the building as additional office space, but established its headquarters in Kirkintilloch. East Dunbartonshire Council subsequently sold Boclair, which has since been converted into a hotel.

<text>George Granville Barker (26 February 1913 – 27 October 1991) was an English poet. He identified with the New Apocalyptics movement, which reacted against 1930s realism with mythical and surrealistic themes. His long liaison with Elizabeth Smart was the subject of her cult-novel &quot;By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept&quot;.

==Life and work==
George Barker was born on 26 February 1913 in Loughton, Essex, a stone&#x27;s throw from Epping Forest. His father, George Barker (1879–1965), who had worn many hats from a temporary police constable to a butler at Gray&#x27;s Inn, brought to the family a history of military service, having risen to the rank of Major during World War I. Marion Frances (1881–1953), née Taaffe, his mother, hailed from Mornington, County Meath. It was in Chelsea, London, at the age of six months, that Barker began his urban odyssey.

Barker’s youth was spent in the company of his younger brother Kit, who would later make his mark as a painter. Their upbringing later in Battersea and subsequently at Upper Addison Gardens, Holland Park exposed them to a vibrant milieu that undeniably seeded Barker’s poetic sensibilities.

His formal education began at an L.C.C. school and continued at Regent Street Polytechnic. However, the confines of structured learning could not contain Barker&#x27;s burgeoning creative energy. Leaving school early, he meandered through various jobs before finding his true calling in poetry. His early works, including &quot;Thirty Preliminary Poems&quot; (1933), &quot;Poems&quot; (1935), and &quot;Calamiterror&quot; (1937)—the latter a fervent response to the Spanish Civil War and a scathing critique of the Spanish Nationalists. —heralded the arrival of a formidable literary talent.

The 1930s saw Barker’s association with T.S. Eliot at Faber and Faber, a connection that proved pivotal. This endorsement led to his appointment as Professor of English Literature in 1939 at Tohoku University (Sendai, Miyagi, Japan). His time there, though cut short by the war, was artistically fruitful, giving birth to the &quot;Pacific Sonnets&quot;.

He then travelled to the United States, where his life intertwined dramatically with that of Elizabeth Smart. Their passionate and stormy affair produced four children and left an indelible mark on both their creative outputs. Concurrently, Barker fathered three children with his first wife, Jessica. He returned to England in 1943. From the late 1960s until his death, Barker made his home in Itteringham, Norfolk, with his second wife, Elspeth Barker, herself a writer and journalist. This rural retreat provided the backdrop for his poem &quot;At Thurgarton Church&quot; (1969), inspired by the nearby village.

Barker’s life was a mosaic of intense personal relationships and artistic fervour. His 1950 novel &quot;The Dead Seagull&quot; unveiled his affair with Smart, while her &quot;By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept&quot; offered a poignant counterpoint. Robert Fraser edited Barker&#x27;s &quot;Collected Poems&quot; () that were published in 1987 by Faber and Faber. Barker’s alignment with the New Apocalyptics, a movement rebelling against the realism of the 1930s with surreal and mythic motifs, underscored his independence and distinctive voice.

Though his output varied in quality, Barker’s literary landscape includes revered works like &quot;The True Confession of George Barker&quot;, hailed by C.H. Sisson as his masterpiece. Barker, ever self-aware, admitted the difficulty in capturing his life’s tumultuous narrative, saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve stirred the facts around too much... It simply can&#x27;t be done.&quot; Yet, Robert Fraser’s 2001 biography, &quot;The Chameleon Poet: A Life of George Barker&quot;, endeavours to trace the contours of his complex existence.

George Barker’s death, on 27 October 1991, left a legacy as rich and multifaceted as the life he led. His poetry, suffused with personal passions and marked by a distinctive voice, ensures his enduring presence in the annals of British literature.

<text>Cumbernauld and Kilsyth was one of nineteen local government districts in the Strathclyde region of Scotland between 1975 and 1996.

==History==
The district was created in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which established a two-tier structure of local government across mainland Scotland comprising upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Cumbernauld and Kilsyth was one of nineteen districts created within the region of Strathclyde. The district covered parts of four former districts from the historic counties of Dunbartonshire and Stirlingshire, all of which were abolished at the same time:
*From Dunbartonshire:
**Cumbernauld Burgh
**Kirkintilloch and Cumbernauld District (Croy and Dullatur electoral division and part of Twechar and Waterside electoral division within designated area of Cumbernauld New Town)
*From Stirlingshire:
**Kilsyth Burgh
**Central No.2 district (Kilsyth West electoral division and Banton polling district from Kilsyth East electoral division)

The 1973 Act gave the new district the name &quot;Cumbernauld&quot;. The shadow council elected in 1974 to oversee the transition to the new system requested a change of name to &quot;Cumbernauld and Kilsyth&quot;, which was approved by the government before the new district came into being.

The district was abolished in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 which replaced regions and districts with unitary council areas. North Lanarkshire council area was formed covering the abolished districts of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, Monklands, Motherwell, and the Chryston area of Strathkelvin district.

Cumbernauld and Kilsyth remains a constituency of the Scottish Parliament and was formerly a constituency of the House of Commons.

==Political control==
The first election to the district council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 16 May 1975. Political control of the council from 1975 was as follows:

==Premises==
The council established its headquarters at a new building called Council Offices on Bron Way in the centre of Cumbernauld. Since the council&#x27;s abolition in 1996 the building has been known as Bron Chambers and used as additional offices of North Lanarkshire Council.

<text>The Tupolev Tu-4 (; NATO reporting name: Bull) is a piston-engined Soviet strategic bomber that served the Soviet Air Force from the late 1940s to the mid-1960s. The aircraft was a copy of the American Boeing B-29 Superfortress, having been reverse-engineered from seized aircraft that had made emergency landings in the USSR.

==Design and development==
Toward the end of World War II, the Soviet Union saw the need for a strategic bombing capability similar to that of the Western Allies. The Soviet VVS air arm had the locally designed Petlyakov Pe-8 four-engined &quot;heavy&quot; in service at the start of the war, but only 93 had been built by the end of the war and the type had become obsolete. The U.S. regularly conducted bombing raids on Japan from distant Pacific forward bases using B-29 Superfortresses. Joseph Stalin ordered the development of a comparable bomber.

The U.S. twice refused to supply the Soviet Union with B-29s under Lend Lease. However, on four occasions during 1944, individual B-29s made emergency landings in Soviet territory and one crashed after the crew bailed out. In accordance with the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact, the Soviets were neutral in the Pacific War and so the bombers were interned and kept by the Soviets. Despite Soviet neutrality, the U.S. demanded the return of the bombers, but were refused. Three repairable B-29s were flown to Moscow and delivered to the Tupolev OKB. One B-29 was dismantled, the second was used for flight tests and training, and the third was left as a standard for cross-reference. The aircraft included one Boeing-Wichita –5-BW, two Boeing-Wichita –15-BWs and the wreckage of one Boeing-Renton –1-BN, comprising three different models from two different production lines, at Wichita and Renton. Only one of the four had deicing boots, as would be used on the Tu-4. The fourth B-29 was returned to the US along with its crew with the end of the Soviet-Japanese peace. The Soviets declared war on Japan two days after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, in accordance with the Yalta Agreement.

Stalin told Tupolev to duplicate the Superfortress in as short a time as possible instead of continuing with his own comparable ANT-64/Tu-10. The reverse-engineering effort involved 900 factories and research institutes, which finished the design work during the first year, and 105,000 drawings were made. By the end of the second year, the Soviet industry was to produce twenty copies of the aircraft, ready for state acceptance trials.

The Soviet Union used the metric system and so sheet aluminium in thicknesses matching the B-29&#x27;s U.S. customary measurements was unavailable. The corresponding metric-gauge metal was of different thicknesses. Alloys and other materials new to the Soviet Union had to be brought into production. Extensive re-engineering had to take place to compensate for the differences, and Soviet official strength margins had to be decreased to avoid further redesign. Despite those challenges, the prototype Tu-4 weighed only more than the B-29, a difference of less than 1%.

The engineers and suppliers of components were under pressure from Tupolev, Stalin, and the government to create an exact clone of the original B-29 to facilitate production. Tupolev had to overcome substantial resistance to use equipment that was not only already in production but also sometimes superior to that found on the B-29s. Each alteration and every component made was scrutinized and was subject to a lengthy bureaucratic decision process. Kerber, then Tupolev&#x27;s deputy, recalled in his memoirs that engineers needed authorization from a high-ranking general to use Soviet-made parachutes. Differences were limited to the aforementioned sheet-metal gauges, the engines, the defensive weapons, the radio (a later model used in lend-lease B-25s was used in place of the radio in the interned B-29s) and the identification friend or foe (IFF) system since the American IFF was obviously unsuitable. 
The Soviet Shvetsov ASh-73 engine was a development of the Wright R-1820 but was not otherwise related to the B-29&#x27;s Wright R-3350. The ASh-73 also powered some of Aeroflot&#x27;s remaining obsolescent Petlyakov Pe-8 airframes, a much-earlier Soviet four-engined heavy bomber, whose production was curtailed by higher-priority programs. The B-29&#x27;s remote-controlled gun turrets were redesigned to accommodate the Soviet Nudelman NS-23, a harder-hitting and longer-ranged cannon. Additional changes were made as a result of problems encountered during testing related to engine and propeller failures, and equipment changes were made throughout the aircraft&#x27;s service life.

The Tu-4 first flew on 19 May 1947 and was flown by test pilot Nikolai Rybko. Serial production started immediately, and the type would enter large-scale service by 1949. The aircraft was first displayed during a flyover on 3 August 1947 at the Tushino Aviation Day parade. At first three aircraft flew over and the Western observers assumed that they were merely the three B-29 bombers which they knew had been diverted to the Soviet Union during World War II. Minutes later a fourth aircraft appeared, and the observers realized the Soviets had reverse-engineered the B-29.

Entry into service of the Tu-4 threw the U.S. Air Force into panic since the aircraft possessed sufficient range to attack Chicago or Los Angeles on a one-way mission, and that may have informed the maneuvers and air combat practice conducted by US and British air forces in 1948 involving fleets of B-29s. 
The tests were conducted by the RAF Central Fighter Establishment and co-operative US B-29 groups and involved demonstration of recommended methods of attack against B-29/Tu 4-type bombers using RAF Gloster Meteor and de Havilland Vampire jet fighters. The Soviets developed four different midair refueling systems to extend the bomber&#x27;s range, but these were fitted to only a few aircraft, and only a small number of the final design were installed on operational aircraft before the Tu-4 was superseded by the Tu-16.

==Operational history==
A total of 847 Tu-4s had been built when production ended in the Soviet Union in 1952, some of which went to China during the later 1950s. Many experimental variants were built and the experience launched the Soviet strategic bomber program. Tu-4s were withdrawn from Soviet service in the 1960s, being replaced by more advanced aircraft including the Tupolev Tu-16 jet bomber (starting in 1954) and the Tupolev Tu-95 turboprop bomber (starting in 1956). By the beginning of the 1960s, the only Tu-4s still operated by the Soviets were used for transport or airborne laboratory purposes. A Tu-4A was the first Soviet aircraft to drop a nuclear weapon, the RDS-3.

==Operators==
* Soviet Air Force
The Soviet Air Force operated 847 Tupolev Tu-4 bombers between 1948 and early 1960, initially as long-range bombers. The first regiment to be re-equipped on the Tu-4 was the 185th Guards Aviation Regiment of the 13th Guards Bomber Aviation Division, stationed at Poltava Air Base in the Ukrainian SSR. The training of personnel was carried out in Kazan, at the 890th long-range bomber regiment, turned into a training unit. The pilots of the 890th Regiment had extensive experience flying American Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses and Consolidated B-24 Liberator aircraft. In March 1949 the received Tu-4s; the 121st Guards received Tu-4Rs in 1953.

In 1954 the Soviets began phasing out the Tu-4 as Tupolev Tu-16 bombers entered service and, beginning in 1956, to Tupolev Tu-95 bombers. Tu-4s withdrawn from front line units were used for transport duties.
* People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force
On 28 February 1953, Joseph Stalin gave China ten Tu-4 heavy bombers, and in 1960 two additional aircraft configured as navigational trainers arrived in Beijing. 11 Tu-4s were refitted with AI-20K turboprop engines between 1970 and 1973. The last PLAAF Tu-4 was retired in 1988.

In 1969, China developed its first airborne early warning aircraft based on the Tu-4 airframe. The project was named KJ-1 and mounted a Type 843 rotodome above the fuselage of the aircraft. However, due to clutter noise the KJ-1 failed to meet the PLAAF&#x27;s requirements. The project was canceled in 1979 although further projects were proposed based on Tu-4 platform. The airframe was already obsolete however and the Tu-4 was ruled out for future developments. The single prototype is displayed at the PLAAF museum north of Beijing.

<doc id="562293" wikidata="Q1781903" url="?curid=562293" title="USS Des Moines (CA-134)">
<text>USS &quot;Des Moines&quot; (CA-134) was the lead ship of the class of United States Navy (USN) heavy cruisers. She was the first USN ship to mount the auto-loading 8-inch (203 mm) Mark 16 guns, the first large-caliber auto-loading guns in the world. She was the second ship of the USN to be commissioned with the name of the city of Des Moines, capital of Iowa. Launched 1946, she was commissioned in 1948. She saw duty around the world until her decommissioning in 1961 when she was permanently mothballed. A 1981 survey was done to determine if she was worthy of reactivation for the 600-ship Navy, but the cost was too great so she remained in the reserve. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in 1993, which was followed by a campaign to turn her into a museum ship. The campaign failed, and in 2005 she was sold for scrapping, and she was broken up by July 7. Parts of the ship have been donated to various places for display, including at the USS &quot;Salem&quot; museum, which is the only &quot;Des Moines&quot;-class ship to avoid the scrapyard.
== Construction and career ==

&quot;Des Moines&quot; was launched 27 September 1946 by Bethlehem Steel Company, Fore River Shipyard, Quincy, Massachusetts; sponsored by Mrs. E. T. Meredith, Jr.; and commissioned 16 November 1948. She became the first of her class to mount the semi-automatic Mark 16 8-inch turrets and carry the new Sikorsky HO3S-1 utility helicopters in place of seaplanes. She was named after the capital of the state of Iowa.

In a varied operating schedule designed to maintain the readiness of the Navy to meet the constant demands of defense and foreign policy, &quot;Des Moines&quot; cruised from her home port at Newport, Rhode Island and after 1950, from Norfolk, Virginia on exercises of every type in the Caribbean, along the East Coast, in the Mediterranean Sea, and in North Atlantic waters. Annually between 1949 and 1957 she deployed to the Mediterranean, during the first seven years serving as flagship for the 6th Task Fleet (known as the 6th Fleet from 1950). In 1952, and each year from 1954 to 1957, she carried midshipmen for summer training cruises, crossing to Northern European ports on the first four cruises. She also sailed to Northern Europe on NATO exercises in 1952, 1953, and 1955. On 18 February 1958, she cleared Norfolk for the Mediterranean once more, this time to remain as flagship for the 6th Fleet until July 1961 when she was placed out of commission in reserve.

Through her Mediterranean services &quot;Des Moines&quot; contributed significantly to the success of the 6th Fleet in representing American power and interests in the countries of Southern Europe, Northern Africa, and the Near East. She made this contribution through such activities as her participation in NATO Mediterranean exercises; her call to seldom-visited Rijeka, Yugoslavia, in December 1950 and Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia, in May 1960, and to many other ports as a regular feature of her schedule; her cruising in the eastern Atlantic during the wake of the Suez Crisis of 1956; and service on patrol and as control center for American forces in the Lebanon crisis of 1958.

Film footage of her cruising with other ships of the United States 6th Fleet was used in the introduction and conclusion of the movie &quot;John Paul Jones,&quot; starring Robert Stack (Warner Brothers 1959).

=== Decommissioning ===
After decommissioning in 1961 she was mothballed in the South Boston Naval Annex and eventually laid up in the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility at Philadelphia in maintained reserve. In 1981 the United States Congress directed that the Navy conduct a survey to determine if she and sister ship could be reactivated (in lieu of two ) to support the 600-ship Navy proposed by the Reagan Administration. The study concluded that while both ships would be useful in the active fleet, there was not enough deck space to add the modern weapons systems (Tomahawk cruise missiles, Harpoon anti-ship missiles, Phalanx CIWS mounts, radars and communication systems) that the ships would need to operate in a 1980s environment. In addition, the per-ship costs for the reactivation and updates (that were determined feasible) would be close to the costs for an &quot;Iowa&quot;, for a much less capable ship. Therefore, both ships remained in maintained reserve until they were struck off the reserve list in August 1993.

After an attempt to turn her into a museum ship in Milwaukee, Wisconsin failed, she was sold in 2005, and then towed to Brownsville, Texas, for scrapping. By July 2007, she had been completely broken up. Her status officially changed to &quot;disposed of by scrapping, dismantling&quot; on 16 August 2007. Two of her dual 5-inch/38 gun mounts were donated to the museum in Corpus Christi, Texas, where they can now be seen on display.

Her sister ship was scrapped in New Orleans in 1993. The third &quot;Des Moines&quot;-class ship, , is a museum ship in Quincy, Massachusetts.

USS &quot;Des Moines&quot; &#x27; bell, nameplate and plaque are on display at Camp Dodge, Johnston, Iowa. The USS &quot;Des Moines&quot; &#x27; port anchor resides in the roundabout at the entrance to Quincy, Massachusetts, which is adjacent to the USS &quot;Salem&quot; Museum.

<text>Cumnock and Doon Valley () was one of nineteen local government districts in the Strathclyde region of Scotland from 1975 to 1996.

==History==
The district was created in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which established a two-tier structure of local government across Scotland comprising upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Cumnock and Doon Valley was one of nineteen districts created within the region of Strathclyde. The district covered the whole area of two former districts and most of a third from the historic county of Ayrshire, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Cumnock and Holmhead Burgh
*Cumnock District
*Dalmellington District, except Coylton and the part of the parish of Ayr within that district

The district was abolished in 1996 by the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, which replaced the regions and districts with unitary council areas. The district&#x27;s area was combined with that of Kilmarnock and Loudoun to form the East Ayrshire council area.

==Political control==
The first election to the district council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 16 May 1975. Throughout the council&#x27;s existence the Labour Party held a majority of the seats on the council:
==Premises==
The district council&#x27;s headquarters were at Lugar, north-east of Cumnock, the area&#x27;s largest town. The council&#x27;s offices were at the former Lugar Ironworks on Peesweep Brae, which had been converted to become the offices and workshops of the National Coal Board some years earlier. After the district&#x27;s abolition in 1996 the building at Lugar served as secondary offices for East Ayrshire Council before being demolished around 2013.

<doc id="562301" wikidata="Q1479742" url="?curid=562301" title="USS Fall River (CA-131)">
<text>USS &quot;Fall River&quot; (CA-131) was a heavy cruiser of the United States Navy. Launched on 13 August 1944 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey, sponsored by Mrs. Alexander C. Murray, wife of Fall River mayor Alexander C. Murray; and commissioned on 1 July 1945, Captain David Stolz Crawford in command.

==Service history==

On 31 October 1945, &quot;Fall River&quot; arrived at Norfolk, out of which she sailed in experimental development operations until 31 January 1946. The cruiser was assigned to JTF 1, organized to conduct Operation Crossroads, atomic weapons tests in the Marshall Islands in the summer of 1946. To prepare for this duty, Fall River sailed to San Pedro, California, where from 16 February to 6 March she was altered to provide flagship accommodations. Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 17 March, she embarked Rear Admiral Frank G. Fahrion, commander of the target vessel&#x27;s group for the tests, and with him sailed in the Marshalls between 21 May and 14 September.

After west coast training, &quot;Fall River&quot; served a tour of duty in the Far East as flagship of Cruiser Division 1 from 12 January 1947 to 17 June 1947. Authorized during World War II but completed too late to see service in that conflict, the &quot;Fall River&quot; was caught in the post-war economizing measures, despite her recent completion and lack of wartime damage. She returned to Puget Sound Navy Yard, where she was placed out of commission in reserve on 31 October 1947. Proposals to convert her into an guided missile cruiser were cancelled when sister ship was determined to be in better material condition. &quot;Fall River&quot; continued to reside in the reserve fleet until stricken on 19 February 1971, and sold on 28 August 1972 to Zidell Explorations Corp., Portland, Oregon.

The tip of her bow is now on display at Battleship Cove.

<doc id="562306" wikidata="Q3489350" url="?curid=562306" title="USS Flint (CL-97)">
<text>USS &quot;Flint&quot; (CL-97) was a modified light cruiser, sometimes referred to as an &quot;&quot;Oakland&quot;-class&quot;. She was named after the city of Flint, Michigan. She was launched on 25 January 1944 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation of San Francisco, California, sponsored by Mrs. R. A. Pitcher. She was and commissioned on 31 August 1944. She was reclassified CLAA-97 on 18 March 1949.

==Service history==
&quot;Flint&quot; reported to the 3rd Fleet for duty at Ulithi on 27 December 1944, and six days later, sailed with Task Force 38 (TF 38) for a month-long cruise in support of the invasion of Luzon. She screened aircraft carriers as they launched strikes on Luzon, Taiwan, and the China coast, and fired protective anti-aircraft cover during a Japanese &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack on 21 January 1945. Replenishing at Ulithi from 26 January to 10 February, &quot;Flint&quot; then sailed with newly designated TF 38 for air strikes on Tokyo preceding the attack on Iwo Jima. Her force arrived off Iwo Jima on 21 February to provide anti-aircraft cover for the Marines who had landed two days previously, and &quot;Flint&quot; returned to Ulithi 12 March for a brief 2 days of replenishment.

Putting to sea with TF 58 for strikes against Kyūshū in preparation for the invasion of Okinawa, &quot;Flint&quot; aided in bringing down several airplanes in heavy attacks on the task force from 18 to 22 March. The task force then closed Okinawa, and &quot;Flint&quot; with other cruisers bombarded beach installations in preparation for the landings on 1 April. Aside from the period of 14–24 May, when she was at Ulithi for upkeep, &quot;Flint&quot; operated off Okinawa until 13 June, when she anchored in Leyte Gulf.

&quot;Flint&quot; sortied from Leyte on 1 July to screen the final air attacks on the Japanese home islands and to join the bombardment of the east coast of Honshū until the cessation of hostilities. On 24 August, she took station off Nii Shima to serve as rescue ship and homing station for transport planes carrying occupation troops to Japan. From 10 to 15 September, she lay in Tokyo Bay, then sailed with a carrier task force to provide air and sea surveillance of Central Honshū until 21 September.

The cruiser made a voyage from Japan to Eniwetok, then loaded homeward bound servicemen at Yokosuka on 13 October, bringing them into San Francisco Bay on 28 November. After sailing to Kwajalein to bring home more servicemen eligible for discharge, &quot;Flint&quot; reported at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, on 11 January 1946, and there was placed out of commission in reserve at Bremerton on 6 May 1947. Her dedication plaque currently rests in the Sloan Museum, in the city she is named after.

==Awards==
&quot;Flint&quot; received four battle stars for World War II service.

<text>Helvellyn (; &quot;pale yellow moorland&quot;) is a mountain in the English Lake District, the highest point of the Helvellyn range, a north–south line of mountains to the north of Ambleside, between the lakes of Thirlmere and Ullswater.

Helvellyn is the third-highest point both in England and in the Lake District, and access to Helvellyn is easier than to the two higher peaks of Scafell Pike and Scafell. The scenery includes three deep glacial coves and two sharp-topped ridges on the eastern side (Striding Edge and Swirral Edge). Helvellyn was one of the earliest fells to prove popular with walkers and explorers; beginning especially in the later 18th century. Among the early visitors to Helvellyn were the poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, both of whom lived nearby at one period. Many routes up the mountain are possible so that it may be approached from all directions.

However, traversing the mountain is not without dangers; over the last two hundred years there have been a number of fatalities. The artist Charles Gough is more famous for his death on Striding Edge in 1805 than for what he achieved in his life. Among many human feats upon the mountain, one of the strangest was the landing and take-off of a small aeroplane on the summit in 1926.

Since early 2018 the summit of Helvellyn including both Striding and Swirral Edges and the wider Glenridding Common have been managed by the John Muir Trust, a wild places conservation charity under a three-year lease with the Lake District Park Authority.

== Topography ==

The volcanic rocks of which the mountain is made were formed in the caldera of an ancient volcano, many of them in violently explosive eruptions, about 450 million years ago during the Ordovician period. During the last ice age these rocks were carved by glaciers to create the landforms seen today.

Since the end of the last ice age, small populations of arctic-alpine plants have survived in favourable spots on rock ledges high in the eastern coves. Rare to Britain species of alpine butterfly, the mountain ringlet, also live on and around Helvellyn.

Mineral veins, some with deposits of the lead ore galena, do exist within Helvellyn&#x27;s rocks, but attempts to find sufficient quantities of lead to be worth mining have not been successful.

The top of Helvellyn is a broad plateau, trending roughly from north-west to south-east for about a kilometre between Lower Man and the start of Striding Edge. Throughout this distance it remains more than high. To the west the ground drops gently at first but then more steeply down to Thirlmere, while on the eastern side three deep glacial coves, each backed by high cliffs, are separated by two spectacular sharp ridges or arêtes. The middle of these coves contains Red Tarn.

Like much of the main ridge of the range, Helvellyn stands on the watershed between Thirlmere and the Derwent river system to the west, and Ullswater and the Eden river system to the east.

Streams on the west side drain directly into Thirlmere, apart from Helvellyn Gill which flows into a parallel valley to the east of Great How and empties into St John&#x27;s Beck. However, when Thirlmere reservoir was built, a leat was constructed to capture the water of Helvellyn Gill, so that it is now directed into the reservoir.

A never-failing spring called Brownrigg Well exists below the summit of Helvellyn, about due west of the highest point, at the head of Whelpside Gill. In the nineteenth century a leat was constructed to direct the water of this spring into the gill to its north to serve the needs of the Helvellyn Mine further down. This leat has now fallen into disuse. The gill it led to is not named on any map, but some authors have referred to it as Mines Gill.

Whelp Side, between Whelpside Gill and Mines Gill, appears as a distinct shoulder of the mountain when seen from the west, largely grassy though with a few crags and boulders in places, and with coniferous plantations on its lower slopes which were planted to stabilise the land around the reservoir. North of Mines Gill are the Helvellyn Screes, a more craggy stretch of hillside, beneath the north-west ridge, with a loose scree covering in places.

The deep coves on the rocky eastern side of Helvellyn drain into Ullswater. Water from Brown Cove and Red Tarn unite below Catstye Cam to form Glenridding Beck, which flows through Glenridding village to the lake, while Nethermost Cove drains into the same lake via Grisedale Beck and Patterdale village.

Red Tarn, enclosed between Striding Edge and Swirral Edge, is about deep, but in the mid-nineteenth century a dam was built to increase its capacity and supply the needs of the Greenside Mine near Glenridding. That dam has now gone and the tarn has returned to its natural size. It contains brown trout and schelly, a species of whitefish found in only four bodies of water in the Lake District.

A second reservoir was built around 1860 in Brown Cove, between Swirral Edge and Lower Man, along with one further down the valley in Keppel Cove. These provided water to generate hydroelectric power for the lead mine. The dam in Keppel Cove is still in place, but water now leaks through its base. The remains of the dam in Brown Cove can be seen, but again water leaks freely through it. It is unclear whether there ever was a natural tarn in Brown Cove. Guidebook writers before 1860 refer only to Keppel Cove Tarn to the north of Swirral Edge.

=== Ridges ===

A total of five ridges diverge from the summit ridge of Helvellyn at different points.

The north-west ridge continues from Lower Man over Browncove Crags, becoming almost insignificant when it reaches the shore of Thirlmere, yet still separating the valley of Helvellyn Gill from the reservoir, before finally rising again to the wooded height of Great How at its terminus.

The north ridge, the main ridge of the range, also descends from Lower Man, passing over White Side and Raise to Sticks Pass, then over Stybarrow Dodd and Great Dodd to terminate at Clough Head.

The north-east ridge is known as Swirral Edge, a sharp arête which joins the summit ridge at a point half-way along, and which terminates in the shapely pyramid of Catstye Cam.

The east ridge is another sharp arête known as Striding Edge. This joins the summit ridge at its southern end, not far from Helvellyn&#x27;s summit. It passes over the subsidiary top of High Spying How and leads to Birkhouse Moor before descending to its final top, Keldas, beside the south end of Ullswater.

The south ridge continues the main ridge of the Helvellyn range over Nethermost Pike, High Crag and Dollywagon Pike to terminate at Grisedale Tarn.

The former county boundary between Cumberland and Westmorland lay along the Helvellyn Ridge; this meant that the summit of Helvellyn was the highest point in Westmorland, making it a Historic County Top.

=== Subsidiary tops ===
== Routes ==
The whole of Helvellyn, above the conifer plantations to the west and the walls surrounding the valleys of Glenridding and Grisedale to the east, is Open Access land.

Routes up Helvellyn can begin from the villages of Glenridding or Patterdale to the east, Grasmere to the south, or from a number of places along the A591 road to the west, and can follow any of the mountain&#x27;s five ridges, or the ridges of its neighbours, as well as some of the gills and shoulders on the west side of the range. Walkers can choose between many routes.

In January 2018 Helvellyn was named &#x27;Britain&#x27;s Best Walk&#x27; in an ITV show presented by Julia Bradbury.

=== The eastern ridges ===

Striding Edge is a popular route which involves some scrambling, linking the summit ridge of Birkhouse Moor to Helvellyn&#x27;s summit by what becomes a sharp arête.

Striding Edge begins at Hole-in-the-Wall and then stretches for over to the Helvellyn summit plateau. This starting point is accessible from both Glenridding and Patterdale. Hole-in-the-Wall used to be a prominent gap in the stone wall on the top of the ridge where a gate was missing. Today the gap has been filled in and a ladder stile crosses the wall. From here the initial part of the ridge is relatively rounded and has a solid path running along the right-hand side. This changes upon reaching High Spying How, the highest point on the ridge — . At this point a narrow path continues close to the top of the ridge, which becomes increasingly narrow, and scramblers will often follow the very top of the arête.

The path on the right-hand side continues until near the end of the ridge where it switches over to the left-hand side. Scramblers who continue on the top of the ridge are forced to descend an awkward short gully down from the final rock tower to rejoin the path. At this point the ridge connects with the main Helvellyn massif. Reaching the summit plateau involves a steep walk or scramble up about of rough rocky terrain, known as The Abyss by W. A. Poucher, author of a popular series of mountain guide books between 1940 and the late 1960s. From the top of this climb the summit is only away.

Striding Edge is a notorious accident spot among hikers and scramblers. In winter conditions the climb from Striding Edge up to the summit plateau can involve crossing steep icy ground and a snow cornice, and can be the most dangerous part of the walk. Without an ice axe or crampons this presents a serious obstacle. In January 2008 two walkers died after falling from the ridge in separate incidents. Another walker died after falling from Striding Edge in May 2008. Over the August Bank Holiday weekend in 2017, Patterdale Mountain Rescue attended a fatal fall from Striding Edge on the Saturday and helped rescue a seriously injured walker and his dog on the Sunday.

Swirral Edge offers a shorter but equally exciting scramble along a similar sharp arête. The main path to it comes up from Red Tarn, which is linked by a surprisingly level path to Hole-in-the-Wall, making this ridge equally accessible from Patterdale as from Glenridding. The ridge walk can be extended to include the summit of Catstye Cam.

The climb up or down from the summit plateau onto Swirral Edge is another well known accident spot. In winter it involves climbing down another snow cornice onto steep icy ground. There have been a number of accidents at this spot in recent years, making it as dangerous as Striding Edge.

Nethermost Pike also has an east ridge which gives an alternative route to Helvellyn from Grisedale, which many walkers overlook. It can be combined with a scramble on Eagle Crag, or this part can be bypassed by taking the path to Nethermost Cove before joining the ridge.

=== Other approaches from the east ===
From Patterdale a long but safe and easy walk () on a good path follows the track up Grisedale to the tarn, and then takes the old pony track up the south ridge of Helvellyn. The second part of this walk takes a safe route well away from crags on the side of the ridge (see The south ridge below.)

From Glenridding a similar long but safe and easy walk () follows Greenside Road, past the old lead mine and towards Keppel Cove. This track, another old pony track, then zigzags up the fellside to join the main ridge path at the col between Raise and White Side.

=== The south ridge ===
Grisedale Tarn is the starting point for the south ridge of Helvellyn, and may be reached from Grasmere or Patterdale, or from Dunmail Raise by a path alongside Raise Beck. Above the tarn the old pony track zigzags up the fellside, and takes a safe but unexciting route well away from crags on the side of the ridge, and avoiding all the intermediate tops. In suitable weather a more interesting and scenic route is to follow the edge of the crags as closely as possible, over the tops of Dollywagon Pike, High Crag and Nethermost Pike.

=== The western approaches ===

Shorter and quicker routes to the top of Helvellyn, though with less attractive scenery, begin from several points along the A591 road along the west side of the mountain. Two of these may be combined to create a circular walk. Incorporating the south ridge in the route can restore much of the scenic interest.

Stannah at Legburthwaite is the starting point for the bridleway to Sticks Pass, from which Helvellyn can be approached along the main ridge track from the north.

From Thirlspot two routes lead up Helvellyn. The old pony route took a very safe and steady route for the benefit of early visitors, who took horses and a guide from the inn. The route traverses the flank of White Side to join the ridge at the col just below Lower Man. The other route, known as the White Stones Route, originally marked by stones painted white, crosses the fellside at a lower level and fords Helvellyn Gill to join the path from Swirls.

Swirls is the start of the most direct route to the top of Helvellyn, &quot;the modern pedestrian highway&quot; which has been paved where necessary. It zigzags up the fellside above Helvellyn Gill, over Browncove Crags and joins the main ridge at Lower Man.

Several possible routes begin at Wythburn church. A bridleway winds up the fellside, over Comb Crags and traverses the slopes of Nethermost Pike to arrive on the ridge at Swallow Scarth, the col just below Helvellyn. Other routes from Wythburn follow Comb Gill or Whelpside Gill, or Middle Tongue between these two gills. The shortest route of all follows the gill past the old lead mine, perhaps better used as a descent. Wainwright warned walkers with weak ankles to avoid it.

=== Longer routes ===
Helvellyn may be included in a traverse of the full length of the Helvellyn range in either direction, but with a greater sense of climax when starting from the north. Most of the ridge track is a bridleway and so the route can be completed by mountain bike in a challenging six-hour circular route of off-road and on-road riding. This may begin (and finish) at Mill Bridge near Grasmere.

Helvellyn can also be included in a circular walk from Patterdale: up Striding Edge, down to Grisedale Tarn and back over St Sunday Crag.

=== Climbing routes ===
Helvellyn is a popular area for winter climbing in the Lake District. The steep headwall above Red Tarn contains several graded routes, clustered around the prow-shaped buttress on the right-hand side of the face, known to climbers as Viking Buttress, and in a couple of gullies which lead to the summit.

Nethermost Cove also has some routes, including a large gully between Striding Edge and the back of the cove.

Browncove Crags on the western side of the mountain has some north-facing routes. These are easier to access from a car park, and they can be linked with the Red Tarn routes.

== Fell top assessors ==
The Lake District National Park Authority employs two &quot;Fell top assessors&quot; during the winter months, usually between December and March. Working alternate weeks, one of these walks up Helvellyn each day during that period to check the weather, snow and walking conditions. Their report and daily photograph appear on Weatherline, the Lake District weather forecast website and phone line service, which also includes a local weather forecast from the Met Office. The fell top assessors also put their assessments and photos on Twitter. This information is important for people who go out hillwalking and climbing in winter, helping them to plan their routes and get an idea of the mountain conditions.

== Wild camping ==
Many people camp on Helvellyn throughout the year, often near Red Tarn which gives good views of Striding Edge, Swirral Edge, and the summit of Helvellyn itself. Although camping in England is illegal without the permission of the landowner, there is a tradition of wild camping in the Lake District. This has often been tolerated so long as people have camped unobtrusively, for no more than one night, and have left no trace of their campsite behind.

== Summit ==

The summit of Helvellyn takes the form of a broad plateau, sloping gently to the south-west, but dropping abruptly to the north-east into Red Tarn cove. So smooth and large is this summit that a small aeroplane was able to land on it in 1926 (see History below). The highest point, above sea level, is the top of a small rocky knoll, marked by a loose cairn. In former times this knoll used to be known as Helvellyn High Man (or Higher Man.) Nearby there is a cross-shaped stone shelter; to the north is an Ordnance Survey trig point, slightly lower than the summit at .

The subsidiary top, Helvellyn Lower Man, is about to the north-west. Its summit is small compared to the plateau of Helvellyn, but it offers better views to the north-west, as the ground falls steeply away from it on that side.

== History ==

=== Tourism ===
For centuries shepherds have walked over all parts of Helvellyn in the course of their work. It is only since the late eighteenth century that people have visited the mountain for pleasure or recreation.

One of the earliest accounts of an ascent of Helvellyn for the pleasure of doing so is contained in James Clarke&#x27;s guidebook of 1787. He quotes the account of an unnamed gentleman from Penrith who wanted to eat his dinner on Midsummer Day while sitting in a snowdrift on top of Helvellyn. The man left home at two in the morning, rode to Glencoyne and left his horse at a house in the valley there. He started to walk up the mountain at between four and five in the morning and after five hours hot and hard work he reached the snow and the summit. The snow was covered with dust so he had to dig for clean snow to eat with his dinner. He returned by a different route, reaching Glencoyne ten hours after leaving it. This story seems to reflect the colder climatic conditions of the eighteenth century, during the so-called &quot;Little Ice Age&quot;.
Poets and artists were among the early visitors to Helvellyn at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Samuel Taylor Coleridge did a lot of fellwalking during the years when he lived near Keswick. In August 1800, barely a month after moving there, he went to visit his friends William and Dorothy Wordsworth in Grasmere, taking a route over Helvellyn and arriving at ten in the evening.

A few days later William Wordsworth with his brother John and their friend Mr Simpson made a trip up Helvellyn, setting out after breakfast and returning home at ten that evening. A year later, in October 1801, William and his sister Dorothy rode to Legburthwaite (to the inn at Thirlspot) and then to the top of Helvellyn before returning the same way. Dorothy recorded that it had been a glorious day. They had mists both above and below them, but the sun shone through and their views extended from the Scottish mountains to the sea at Cartmel. Wordsworth&#x27;s poem, &quot;Inmate of a mountain dwelling&quot; (1816), celebrating the captivating power of the old mountain, was dedicated &quot;To … on her first ascent to the summit of Helvellyn.&quot;

John Keats speaks of Wordsworth &quot;on Helvellyn&#x27;s summit, wide awake…&quot; in a sonnet that celebrates the poet and other artists. A portrait of Wordsworth, deep in thought among the clouds on the summit of Helvellyn, was painted by Benjamin Robert Haydon in 1842, an example of romanticism in portraiture.

An early casualty of the mountain was the artist Charles Gough, who slipped and fell from Striding Edge in April 1805. Three months later a shepherd heard a dog barking near Red Tarn and went to investigate. He found Gough&#x27;s skeleton, his hat split in two, and his dog still in attendance. Initial newspaper reports that the dog had survived by eating the remains of her dead master were quickly forgotten. Gough became regarded as a martyr to the romantic ideal, and his dog Foxie was celebrated for her attachment and fidelity to her long-dead master. William Wordsworth and Sir Walter Scott both wrote poems about the scene; Francis Danby and Edwin Landseer both painted it. A memorial stone to Gough was erected on Helvellyn in 1890 and quotes part of Wordsworth&#x27;s poem &quot;Fidelity&quot;.

A small tourist industry began to grow up around the mountain, with inns providing ponies and guides as well as accommodation for the visitors, and guidebooks being published for visitors. Jonathan Otley&#x27;s guidebook of 1823 described the view from the summit and claimed it gave a more complete view of the Lake District than any other point. William Ford, in his guidebook of 1839 recommended the Horse Head Inn at Wythburn as a good place to stay and where a guide could be hired &quot;at a moderate charge&quot;; he went on to describe the climb up Whelp Side and the view from the top. Harriet Martineau in 1855 described the ascent from Patterdale. Ponies could be taken as far as Red Tarn, where there were stakes to tether them while undertaking the final part on foot via Swirral Edge. &quot;Though trying to unnaccustomed nerves,&quot; she said, &quot;there is no real danger&quot;; the other ridge &quot;is always fool-hardy to do&quot;, and &quot;every one knows&quot; the story of Charles Gough. She also mentioned three routes from the west: one by Grisedale Tarn, one from the Nag&#x27;s Head at Wythburn, &quot;the shortest, but by far the steepest,&quot; and a third from Legburthwaite (that is, from the inn at Thirlspot.) An advertisement in her book, placed by the King&#x27;s Head Inn at Legburthwaite, claimed &quot;A guide always in readiness at this inn.&quot;

A further fatality on Striding Edge in 1858 is commemorated by the Dixon Memorial. Robert Dixon from Patterdale was killed while following foxhounds on the ridge.

=== Aeroplane landing ===

In 1926 a small aeroplane landed on the summit plateau of Helvellyn and took off again. The plane was an Avro 585 Gosport, a two-seater biplane flown by Bert Hinkler, a test pilot who worked for A V Roe, the plane&#x27;s manufacturers, at Woodford Aerodrome near Manchester.

A ground party had cleared and marked a landing strip. Attempts on 15 December and on 21 December were abandoned.

On 22 December Hinkler, accompanied by John F. Leeming, president of the Lancashire Aero Club, made another attempt. The landing was no problem. On the steep slope and with a strong headwind the plane stopped quickly. Professor E. R. Dodds witnessed the landing. The uphill take-off was more difficult and the plane dived off the edge of the summit with insufficient airspeed, but picked up speed as it dived, narrowly missing Striding Edge, to return to Manchester.

A stone tablet on Helvellyn, south of the shelter, commemorates this landing.

== Ecology ==

Mountain birds around Helvellyn include the raven (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;), which has now become common. Peregrine falcons (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;), buzzards (&quot;Buteo buteo&quot;) and ring ouzels (&quot;Turdus torquatus&quot;) have all bred in the immediate area. Skylarks (&quot;Alauda arvensis&quot;) and wheatears (&quot;Oenanthe oenanthe&quot;) are frequently encountered. At one time eagles (probably &quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;) soared over the mountain and bred on the steep cliffs above Red Tarn, but even in Wordsworth&#x27;s day they had gone, having been persecuted to extinction.

The three coves to the east of Helvellyn are all important sites for remnant populations of arctic-alpine plants. Species such as downy willow (&quot;Salix lapponum&quot;), mountain avens (&quot;Dryas octopetala&quot;), alpine mouse-ear (&quot;Cerastium alpinum&quot;), alpine meadowgrass (&quot;Poa alpina&quot;) and others have been able to survive in these coves since the last glaciation through a combination of rocks rich in basic minerals, a harsh micro-climate and inaccessibility to grazing sheep on cliff ledges. However, these populations are small and are not reproducing well. Natural England has introduced a recovery plan for them.

Red Tarn, a classic corrie tarn, is a high-elevation tarn with low nutrient levels and poor in the number of species it supports. Characteristic vegetation zones include a water-starwort (&quot;Callitriche&quot;) in shallower areas and the alga &quot;Nitella flexilis&quot; in deeper water and around the inlet. Other species include a pondweed (&quot;Potamogeton&quot;) which grows in of water and the rush &quot;Juncus bulbosus&quot;. Brown trout and schelly, a species of whitefish, are found in the tarn.

Grassland on the Helvellyn range has been heavily overgrazed for many years, yet it supports a diversity of acid grassland species including sheep&#x27;s fescue (&quot;Festuca ovina&quot;) on the summit ridge, matgrass (&quot;Nardus stricta&quot;) on the middle slopes, and fescue-bent swards on the lower slopes. The &quot;Nardus&quot; grasslands are the haunt of the scarce mountain ringlet butterfly (&quot;Erebia epiphron&quot;), the only alpine species of butterfly found in Britain. Acidic flushes (areas of water seepage) with their carpets of sphagnum mosses are common. Less common are basic flushes, which support a greater diversity of species.

The summit and the eastern side of the mountain are part of the Helvellyn &amp; Fairfield Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). This covers an area of and was designated in 1975 because of the area&#x27;s geological and biological features. Natural England, which is responsible for choosing SSSIs, tries to ensure that the management and use of the area is sustainable.

== Geology ==
All the rocks of Helvellyn are part of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, formed on the margin of an ancient continent during a period of intense volcanic activity during the Ordovician period, roughly 450 million years ago.

Helvellyn lies within a geological structure which is interpreted as evidence of a volcanic caldera. This is a semi-circular series of faults which sweep eastwards to encompass Helvellyn, Patterdale, Deepdale and Fairfield, and which abut against a major north–south fault to the west (along the line of the A591 road).

This caldera was formed by an eruption of exceptional magnitude which produced a series of pyroclastic flows, fast moving currents of hot gas and rock, which buried the whole district of roughly beneath at least (in places up to of ignimbrite). This succession of ignimbrites is known as the Lincomb Tarns Tuff Formation, the most widespread volcanic formation in the Lake District. The eruption of such a huge quantity of magma emptied the magma chamber beneath the volcano and led to the collapse of the overlying rocks to form the caldera.

The lowest and oldest rocks on Helvellyn are those of this Lincomb Tarns Tuff Formation, which outcrop along the western side, up to roughly the contour on Whelp Side. The lowest part of the formation here is the densely welded lapilli tuff]] of the Thirlmere Member, in which the individual pieces of semi-molten lava were flattened under the weight of deposits above them. Contemporaneous movement on the caldera&#x27;s boundary fault has produced a thick deposit of breccia above the Helvellyn Screes and on Browncove Crags. The Thirlmere Member is overlain by a deposit of sandstone, the Raise Beck Member, deposited in water during a break in the volcanism, but succeeded by further thick ignimbrite deposits.

Above these ignimbrites are found sedimentary rocks of the Esk Pike Sandstone Formation. These were deposited in water, probably in a caldera lake, as the volcanic rocks weathered and were eroded. Structures in these rocks suggest the faults were still active and the caldera was still subsiding. Layers of tuff and lapilli tuff indicate some ongoing volcanism.

Higher still on Helvellyn, as well as in the coves to the east and covering Swirral Edge and Catstye Cam, are rocks of the Helvellyn Tuff Formation. This consists of up to of ignimbrite, representing another series of pyroclastic flows. This Helvellyn Tuff is found only within the boundary faults of the caldera, and mainly in its western half.

The highest surviving rocks on Helvellyn, found on the summit plateaux of Helvellyn itself and of Nethermost Pike, and along the crest of Striding Edge, are the volcaniclastic sandstones of the Deepdale Sandstone Formation. Again, this formation is confined to the limits of the caldera, and represents another return to erosion and sedimentary deposition within a caldera lake, though with layers of pyroclastic rock showing that the volcanism had not entirely finished.

=== Glaciation ===
During the Late Devensian glaciation, which occurred 28,000 to 14,700 years Before Present (BP), the whole of northern England was covered by an ice sheet. Helvellyn was one of a small number of nunataks which protruded above the ice.

A short period of glacial conditions returned between 12,650 and 11,550 years BP, known in Britain as the Loch Lomond Stadial (and elsewhere as the Younger Dryas stadial), when the Gulf Stream current ceased to flow past the British Isles. Small cirque and valley glaciers formed in north and east facing valleys, including Grisedale and the coves on the east side of Helvellyn. The results are seen in moraines of unsorted boulder gravel in the valleys, the spectacular coves with steep headwalls, and the sharp arêtes formed where the rock was eroded on both sides between adjacent glaciers.

Glacial conditions ended suddenly, 11,550 years BP, when the Gulf Stream current was re-established. Periglacial processes in seasonal freeze-thaw conditions, both present and past, have produced sorted stone stripes and solifluction lobes and sheets on the summit ridge of Helvellyn. These are one reason why the area was included in the Helvellyn &amp; Fairfield SSSI.

== Mining ==

Two unsuccessful attempts to find lead ore in economic quantities on Helvellyn have been made.

Brown Cove Mine was high up at the head of Brown Cove, where some disused oil heaps remain, with a couple of levels, one of which ran about into the mountainside.

Helvellyn Mine or Wythburn Mine opened in 1839 by the gill between Whelpside and Helvellyn Screes. It was operated by a succession of different owners, driving five levels through mostly barren rock to explore three mineral veins. It finally closed in 1880 when Manchester Corporation acquired the land for the Thirlmere reservoir. Only a few hundred tons of galena came out of the mine; probably insufficient to cover its costs.

Little can be seen of the levels now for the entrances were destroyed when the mine closed, but several spoil heaps remain, one covering the gill, along with the old miners&#x27; path which zigzags up the hillside, a self-acting incline to lower ore to the dressing floor, and the old winding-drum house. The narrow leat which once diverted water from Brownrigg Well into the gill beside the mine may also be seen, much higher up the fellside.

== Names ==
Helvellyn. The earliest known record of the name dates from 1577, but early records are spelling variations of the modern name (such as &quot;Helvillon&quot;, &quot;Helvelon&quot; or &quot;Hell Belyn&quot;) rather than any help with the etymology. Various attempts to interpret the name have been made in the past. Some, led by the present spelling, possibly wrongly thought the final syllable was the Welsh word &quot;llyn&quot;, &quot;lake&quot; which has various historic spellings including &#x27;lin&#x27; and &#x27;lynn&#x27;. Richard Coates in 1988 proposed a Celtic derivation from the deduced Cumbric word &quot;hal&quot;, &quot;moorland&quot;, and &quot;velin&quot;, the Cumbric equivalent of the Welsh word &quot;melyn&quot; meaning &quot;yellow.&quot; &quot;Hel&quot; is a Welsh word meaning to &quot;gather&quot;, &quot;drive&quot; or &quot;hunt&quot;, and &quot;helfa&quot; (historically spelt &quot;helva&quot;) has been used to describe a portion of mountain from which sheep are collected.
Recent place-name studies have accepted the &quot;yellow moorland&quot; derivation, but have struggled to understand how Helvellyn can be regarded as a yellow mountain. Colour, in the Celtic languages, is perceived differently from the way it is seen and described in modern English. For example, in Scottish Gaelic the spectrum of colours was &quot;pastel rather than primary, gentle rather than bold.&quot; Colours were related to a landscape context in which blues, greens, greys and whites in particular were both more diverse and more differentiated than in English. People who relied on the system of transhumance for their livelihood gained the ability to assess the nutritional value of upland grasses from a distance before moving their stock to a summer shieling, and used appropriate colour terms for grasses which would become progressively more green as the spring advanced. Yellow, at least in Gaelic hill names, is not a bright colour. It describes hills which are distinguished by grasses such as &quot;Nardus stricta&quot; and &quot;Deschampsia flexuosa&quot;, both of which appear pale and bleached in winter. These grasses are common on the Helvellyn range, in an area where transhumance also used to be practiced. &quot;Nardus stricta&quot; in particular is an unpalatable and unproductive grass, and the &quot;Flora of Cumbria&quot; specifically notes a possible connection between areas of late snow cover and &quot;Nardus&quot; grassland at high elevations in the Helvellyn range. A name describing the mountain as &quot;pale yellow moorland&quot; is therefore meaningful in a Celtic context.

Lower Man. The mountain has two tops, which used to be distinguished as Helvellyn Low Man (or Lower Man) and Helvellyn High Man (or Higher Man). Both are drawn and labelled on a panoramic view of the range found in Jonathan Otley&#x27;s guidebook of 1823.

Striding Edge. An edge in mountain place-names is a steep escarpment, on either one side or (as here) on both sides. The first reference to Striding Edge was by Walter Scott in 1805 as &quot;Striden-edge&quot;. A map of 1823 called it &quot;Strathon Edge&quot;. It is possible that &quot;Striding Edge&quot; has replaced an earlier name, now lost.

Swirral Edge may be either &quot;The precipitous ridge that causes giddiness&quot; or &quot;The precipitous ridge where the wind or snow swirls around.&quot; An edge is a steep escarpment, as above. &quot;Swirrel&quot;, a dialect variation of &quot;swirl&quot; has two possible explanations. It can be used to mean &quot;giddiness, vertigo&quot;, but it can also be used of a place in the mountains where wind or snow swirls around.

<doc id="562313" wikidata="Q2266010" url="?curid=562313" title="Glider pilot license">
<text>In most countries one is required to obtain a glider pilot license (GPL) or certificate before acting as pilot of a glider. The requirements vary from country to country.

In many countries, licensing or certification is similar for gliders and powered aircraft. Training must be undertaken from a certified instructor, and a license or certificate is then issued by the government, limited to gliders only. The exception is when a pilot is flying under Ultralight (Ultralite) glider rules within the United States. The aviation knowledge and skill requirements for a glider are usually similar to those for a powered aircraft, taking into account the different requirements of the aircraft categories.

Most countries also require medical certificates for pilots, although in some countries &quot;self-certification&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot;, a legal statement that one is fit to fly, is allowed for gliders. The United States does not require a medical certificate to operate a glider with a U.S. airman certificate. Canada also permits glider pilot license holders to self-certify, but requires regular medical examinations for gliding instructors.

In some countries, glider instruction and licensing are regulated by a national non-governmental organisation representing the gliding community. This is true in the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. New Zealand also issues a government license to pilots who fly for fees and for those who wish their qualifications to be accepted more readily overseas.

Countries vary in their acceptance of pilot licenses from other countries to fly aircraft registered in the home country. Many permit pilots to fly on their home licenses for short periods, others insist on conversion to their license. Generally, a pilot may fly an aircraft registered in their home country with their home country&#x27;s license or certificate, in any other country, subject to international conventions.

The minimum age for a solo glider flight in the UK is 14. A driving licence is adequate evidence of medical fitness for solo flight, and pilots under the age of 25 may self-certify. Failing this a medical certificate is required from the pilot&#x27;s own doctor, to the same standard as a provisional driving licence, unless the pilot has a higher certificate such as the EASA Class 2 medical required for a Private Pilot Licence (PPL). Gliding in the UK is self-regulated by the British Gliding Association (BGA) and by its member clubs. Training is based on standards defined by the BGA and is conducted by instructors who have been trained on its courses. Further practical training is required after solo, plus a multiple choice test which is very similar to the PPL theory exam, before a pilot is given an endorsement to fly cross-country. Most flights do not require radio contact with air traffic control units, but some pilots obtain a radio operator&#x27;s licence should that eventuality arise.

As of 2023, the BGA issues two major gliding qualifications, the Gliding Certificate (aka Glider Pilot Certificate), and the Glider Pilot Licence. Both are being phased out in favour of an ICAO-compliant Sailplane Pilot Licence (SPL), which can be used abroad. The SPL is specified in UK Part-SFCL. It will still be issued by the BGA, under Delegated Authority from the CAA. The Gliding Certificate can be converted to an SPL, but the Glider Pilot Licence cannot.

The Gliding Certificate is endorsed for each requirement met, and also shows sporting achievements for the FAI&#x27;s gliding badges, plus the UK&#x27;s own 100 km and 750 km Diplomas.

==EASA==
Throughout Europe the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is the rulemaking body responsible for pilot licensing. For glider pilots there are two options:

* The Light Aircraft Pilot Licence (Sailplanes) (LAPL(S)) is a sub-ICAO licence, meaning it does not have to be accepted in non-EASA countries.
* The Sailplane Pilot Licence (SPL) is an ICAO-recognised licence, valid worldwide.

In some EASA member states (notably the UK), a lower medical standard applies to the LAPL(S), such that a pilot may choose the LAPL medical instead of a Class 2 medical. During the transition period, UK pilots may self-declare medical fitness, being restricted to UK-registered EASA aircraft.

Crucially, a pilot exercising the rights of a SPL may receive remuneration but the holder of a LAPL(S) may not.

<text>George Barker (9 May 1882 – 1965) was a portrait and landscape painter from the United States. Born in Omaha, Nebraska, much of his work was done in Southern California. While teaching at Long Beach Polytechnic High School in the late 1920s, he mentored several art students that later went on to being accomplished artist themselves. Among them were John Williams, Sueyo Serisawa and Alan Woods.

<doc id="562316" wikidata="Q364975" url="?curid=562316" title="Richard Cantillon">
<text>Richard Cantillon (; 1680s – ) was an Irish-French economist and author of &quot;Essai Sur La Nature Du Commerce En Général&quot; (&quot;Essay on the Nature of Trade in General&quot;), a book considered by William Stanley Jevons to be the &quot;cradle of political economy&quot;. Although little information exists on Cantillon&#x27;s life, it is known that he became a successful banker and merchant at an early age. His success was largely derived from the political and business connections he made through his family and through an early employer, James Brydges. During the late 1710s and early 1720s, Cantillon speculated in, and later helped fund, John Law&#x27;s Mississippi Company, from which he acquired great wealth. However, his success came at a cost to his debtors, who pursued him with lawsuits, criminal charges, and even murder plots until his death in 1734.

&quot;Essai&quot; remains Cantillon&#x27;s only surviving contribution to economics. It was written around 1730 and circulated widely in manuscript form, but was not published until 1755. His work was translated into Spanish by Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, probably in the late 1770s, and considered essential reading for political economy. Despite having much influence on the early development of the physiocrat and classical schools of thought, &quot;Essai&quot; was largely forgotten until its rediscovery by Jevons in the late 19th century. Cantillon was influenced by his experiences as a banker, and especially by the speculative bubble of John Law&#x27;s Mississippi Company. He was also heavily influenced by prior economists, especially William Petty.

&quot;Essai&quot; is considered the first complete treatise on economics, with numerous contributions to the science. These contributions include: his cause and effect methodology, monetary theories, his conception of the entrepreneur as a risk-bearer, and the development of spatial economics. Cantillon&#x27;s &quot;Essai&quot; had significant influence on the early development of political economy, including the works of Adam Smith, Anne Turgot, Jean-Baptiste Say, Frédéric Bastiat and François Quesnay.

==Early life==
While details regarding Richard Cantillon&#x27;s life are scarce, it is thought that he was born sometime during the 1680s in County Kerry, Ireland. He was son to land-owner Richard Cantillon of Ballyheigue. 

==Career==
Sometime in the middle of the first decade of the 18th century Cantillon moved to France, where he attained French citizenship. By 1711, Cantillon found himself in the employment of British Paymaster General James Brydges, in Spain, where he organised payments to British prisoners of war during the War of Spanish Succession. Cantillon remained in Spain until 1714, cultivating a number of business and political connections, before returning to Paris. Cantillon then became involved in the banking industry working for a cousin, who at that time was lead-correspondent of the Parisian branch of a family bank. Two years later, thanks in large part to financial backing by James Brydges, Cantillon bought his cousin out and attained ownership of the bank. Given the financial and political connections Cantillon was able to attain both through his family and through James Brydges, Cantillon proved a fairly successful banker, specialising in money transfers between Paris and London.

At this time, Cantillon became involved with British mercantilist John Law through the Mississippi Company. Based on the monetary theory proposed by William Potter in his 1650 tract &quot;The Key of Wealth&quot;, John Law posited that increases in the money supply would lead to the employment of unused land and labour, leading to higher productivity. In 1716, the French government granted him both permission to found the &quot;Banque Générale&quot; and virtual monopoly over the right to develop French territories in North America, named the Mississippi Company. In return, Law promised the French government to finance its debt at low rates of interest. Law began a financial speculative bubble by selling shares of the Mississippi Company, using the &quot;Banque Générale&quot;&#x27;s virtual monopoly on the issue of bank notes to finance his investors.

Richard Cantillon amassed a great fortune from his speculation, buying Mississippi Company shares early and selling them later at higher prices, even though he had stated he believed Law&#x27;s &quot;scheme was unsound and was bound to fail.&quot; Cantillon&#x27;s financial success and growing influence caused friction in his relationship with John Law, and sometime thereafter Law threatened to imprison Cantillon if the latter did not leave France within twenty-four hours. Cantillon replied: &quot;I shall not go away; but I will make your system succeed.&quot; To that end, in 1718 Law, Cantillon, and wealthy speculator Joseph Gage formed a private company centred on financing further speculation in North American real estate.

In 1719, Cantillon left Paris for Amsterdam, returning briefly in early 1720. Lending in Paris, Cantillon had outlying debt repaid to him in London and Amsterdam. With the collapse of the &quot;Mississippi bubble&quot;, Cantillon was able to collect on debt accruing high rates of interest. Most of his debtors had suffered financial damage in the bubble collapse and blamed Cantillon—until his death, Cantillon was involved in countless lawsuits filed by his debtors, leading to a number of murder plots and criminal accusations.

==Contributions to economics==
Although there is evidence that Richard Cantillon wrote a wide variety of manuscripts, only his &quot;Essai Sur La Nature Du Commerce En Général&quot; (abbreviated &quot;Essai&quot;) survives. Written in 1730, it was published in French in 1755, and was translated into English by Henry Higgs in 1932. Evidence suggests that &quot;Essai&quot; had tremendous influence on the early development of economic science. However, Cantillon&#x27;s treatise was largely neglected during the 19th century. In the late 19th century it was &quot;rediscovered&quot; by William Stanley Jevons, who considered it the &quot;cradle of political economy&quot;. Since then, Cantillon&#x27;s &quot;Essai&quot; has received growing attention. &quot;Essai&quot; is considered the first complete treatise on economic theory, and Cantillon has been called the &quot;father of enterprise economics&quot;.
One of the greatest influences on Cantillon&#x27;s writing was English economist William Petty and his 1662 tract &quot;Treatise on Taxes&quot;. Although Petty provided much of the groundwork for Cantillon&#x27;s &quot;Essai&quot;, Anthony Brewer argues that Petty&#x27;s influence has been overstated. Apart from Petty, other possible influences on Cantillon include John Locke, Cicero, Livy, Pliny the Elder, Pliny the Younger, Charles Davenant, Edmond Halley, Isaac Newton, Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban, and Jean Boisard. Cantillon&#x27;s involvement in John Law&#x27;s speculative bubble proved invaluable and likely heavily influenced his insight on the relationship between increases in the supply of money, price, and production.

===Methodology===
Cantillon&#x27;s &quot;Essai&quot; is written using a distinctive causal methodology, separating Cantillon from his mercantilist predecessors. &quot;Essai&quot; is peppered with the word &quot;natural&quot;, which in the case of Cantillon&#x27;s treatise is meant to imply a cause and effect relationship between economic actions and their underlying (i.e. causing) phenomena. Economist Murray Rothbard credits Cantillon with being one of the first theorists to isolate economic phenomena with simple models, where otherwise-uncontrollable variables can be fixed. Cantillon made frequent use of the concept of ceteris paribus throughout &quot;Essai&quot; in an attempt to neglect independent variables. Furthermore, he is credited with employing a methodology similar to Carl Menger&#x27;s methodological individualism, by deducing complex phenomena from simple observations.

A cause and effect methodology led to a relatively value-free approach to economic science, in which Cantillon was uninterested in the merit of any particular economic action or phenomenon, focusing rather on the explanation of relationships. This led Cantillon to separate economic science from politics and ethics to a greater degree than previous mercantilist writers. This has led to disputes on whether Cantillon can justly be considered a mercantilist or one of the first anti-mercantilists, given that Cantillon often cited government-manipulated trade surpluses and specie accumulation as positive economic stimuli. Others argue that in instances where Cantillon is thought to have supported certain mercantilist policies, he actually provided a more neutral analysis by explicitly stating possible limitations of mercantilist policies.

===Monetary theory===
Differences between prior mercantilists and Cantillon arise early in &quot;Essai&quot;, regarding the origins of wealth and price formation on the market. Cantillon distinguishes between wealth and money, considering wealth in itself &quot;nothing but the food, conveniences, and pleasures of life.&quot; While Cantillon advocated an &quot;intrinsic&quot; theory of value, based on the input of land and labour (cost of production), he is considered to have touched upon a subjective theory of value. Cantillon held that market prices are not immediately decided by intrinsic value, but are derived from supply and demand. He considered market prices to be derived by comparing supply, the quantity of a particular good in a particular market, to demand, the quantity of money brought to be exchanged. Believing market prices to tend towards the intrinsic value of a good, Cantillon may have also originated the uniformity-of-profit principle—changes in the market price of a good may lead to changes in supply, reflecting a rise or fall in profit.

In &quot;Essai&quot;, Cantillon provided an advanced version of John Locke&#x27;s quantity theory of money, focusing on relative inflation and the velocity of money. Cantillon suggested that inflation occurs gradually and that the new supply of money has a localised effect on inflation, effectively originating the concept of non-neutral money. Furthermore, he posited that the original recipients of new money enjoy higher standards of living at the expense of later recipients. The concept of relative inflation, or a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods in an economy, is now known as the Cantillon Effect. Cantillon also considered changes in the velocity of money (quantity of exchanges made within a specific amount of time) influential on prices, although not to the same degree as changes in the quantity of money. While he believed that the money supply consisted only of specie, he conceded that increases in money substitutes—or bank notes—could affect prices by effectively increasing the velocity of circulating of deposited specie. Apart from distinguishing money from money substitute, he also distinguished between bank notes offered as receipts for specie deposits and bank notes circulating beyond the quantity of specie—or fiduciary media—suggesting that the volume of fiduciary media is strictly limited by people&#x27;s confidence in its redeemability. He considered fiduciary media a useful tool to abate the downward pressure that hoarding of specie has on the velocity of money.

Addressing the mercantilist belief that monetary intervention could cause a perpetually favourable balance of trade, Cantillon developed a specie-flow mechanism foreshadowing future international monetary equilibrium theories. He suggested that in countries with a high quantity of money in circulation, prices will increase and therefore become less competitive in relation to countries where there is a relative scarcity of money. Thus, Cantillon also held that increases in the supply of money, regardless of the source, cause increases in the price level and therefore reduce the competitiveness of a particular nation&#x27;s industry in relation to a nation with lower prices. However, Cantillon did not believe that international markets tended toward equilibrium, and instead suggested that government hoard specie to avoid rising prices and falling competitiveness. Furthermore, he suggested that a favourable balance of trade can be maintained by offering a better product and retaining qualitative competitiveness. Cantillon&#x27;s preference towards a favourable balance of trade possibly stemmed from the mercantilist belief in exchange being a zero-sum game, in which one party gains at the expense of another.

A relatively advanced theory of interest is also presented. Cantillon believed that interest originates from the need of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for the risk of the possible insolvency of the debtor. In turn, interest is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital. While previously it was believed that the rate of interest varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that the rate of interest was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume. As such, while saved money impacts the rate of interest, new money that is instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon&#x27;s theory of interest is therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes&#x27;s liquidity preference theory.

===Other contributions===
Traditionally, it is Jean-Baptiste Say who is credited for coining the word and advancing the concept of the entrepreneur, but in fact it was Cantillon who first introduced the term in &quot;Essai&quot;. Cantillon divided society into two principal classes—fixed income wage-earners and non-fixed income earners. Entrepreneurs, according to Cantillon, are non-fixed income earners who pay known costs of production but earn uncertain incomes, due to the speculative nature of pandering to an unknown demand for their product. Cantillon, while providing the foundations, did not develop a dedicated theory of uncertainty—the topic was not revisited until the 20th century, by Ludwig von Mises, Frank Knight, and John Maynard Keynes, among others. Furthermore, unlike later theories of entrepreneurship which saw the entrepreneur as a disruptive force, Cantillon anticipated the belief that the entrepreneur brought equilibrium to a market by correctly predicting consumer preferences.

Spatial economics deal with distance and area, and how these may affect a market through transportation costs and geographical limitations. The development of spatial economics is usually ascribed to German economist Johann Heinrich von Thünen; however, Cantillon addressed spatial economics nearly a century earlier. Cantillon integrated his advancements in spatial economic theory into his microeconomic analysis of the market, describing how transportation costs influence the location of factories, markets and population centres—that is, individuals strive to lower transportation costs. Conclusions on spatial economics were derived from three premises: cost of raw materials of equal quality will always be higher near the capital city, due to transportation costs; transportation costs vary on transportation type (for example, water transportation was, and often still is, cheaper than land-based transportation); and larger goods that are more difficult to transport will always be cheaper closer to their area of production. For example, Cantillon believed markets were designed as they were to decrease costs to both merchants and villagers in terms of time and transportation. Similarly, Cantillon posited that the locations of cities were the result in large part of the wealth of inhabiting property owners and their ability to afford transportation costs—wealthier property owners tended to live farther from their property, because they could afford the transportation costs. In &quot;Essai&quot;, spatial economic theory was used to derive why markets occupied the geographical area they did and why costs varied across different markets.

Apart from originating theories on the entrepreneur and spatial economics, Cantillon also provided a dedicated theory on population growth. Unlike William Petty, who believed there always existed a considerable amount of unused land and economic opportunity to support economic growth, Cantillon theorised that population grows only as long as there are economic opportunities present. Specifically, Cantillon cited three determining variables for population size: natural resources, technology, and culture. Therefore, populations grow only as far as the three aforementioned variables allowed. Furthermore, Cantillon&#x27;s population theory was more modern than that of Malthus in the sense that Cantillon recognised a much broader category of factors which affect population growth, including the tendency for population growth to fall to zero as a society becomes more industrialised.

==Influence==
While the &quot;Essai&quot; was not published until 1755 as a result of heavy censorship in France, it did widely circulate in the form of an unpublished manuscript between its completion and its publication. It notably influenced many direct forerunners of the classical school of thought, including Turgot and other physiocrats. Cantillon was a major influence on physiocrat François Quesnay, who has probably had access to his work through the marquis de Mirabeau, who possessed a manuscript of the &quot;Essai&quot; since 1740. While it is evident that the &quot;Essai&quot; influenced Quesnay, to what degree remains controversial. There is evidence that Quesnay did not fully understand, or was not completely aware of, Cantillon&#x27;s theories. Many of Quesnay&#x27;s economic beliefs were elucidated previously in the &quot;Essai&quot;, but Quesnay did reject a number of Cantillon&#x27;s premises, including the scarcity of land and Cantillon&#x27;s population theory. Also, Quesnay recognised the scarcity of capital and capital accumulation as a prerequisite for investment. Nevertheless, Cantillon was considered the &quot;father of physiocracy&quot; by Henry Higgs, due to his influence on Quesnay. It is also possible that Cantillon influenced Scottish economist James Steuart, both directly and indirectly.

Cantillon is one of the few economists cited by Adam Smith, who directly borrows Cantillon&#x27;s subsistence theory of wages. Large sections of Smith&#x27;s economic theory were possibly directly influenced by Cantillon, although in many respects Adam Smith advanced well beyond the scope of Cantillon. Some economic historians have argued that Adam Smith provided little of value from his own intellect, notably Schumpeter and Rothbard. In any case, through his influence on Adam Smith and the physiocrats, Cantillon was quite possibly the pre-classical economist who contributed most to the ideas of the classical school. Illustrative of this was Cantillon&#x27;s influence on Jean-Baptiste Say, which is noticeable in the methodology employed in the latter&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on Political Economy&quot;.

==Personal life==

On 16 February 1722, Cantillon married Mary Anne O&#x27;Mahony (1701–1751), daughter of Cecilia Weld and Count Daniel O&#x27;Mahony—a wealthy merchant and former Irish general—spending much of the remainder of the 1720s travelling throughout Europe with his wife. Cantillon and Mary had a son, who died at a young age, and a daughter:

* Henrietta Cantillon (1728–1761), who married William Stafford-Howard, 3rd Earl of Stafford, son of William Stafford-Howard, 2nd Earl of Stafford, in 1743. After his death, she married Robert Maxwell, 1st Earl of Farnham, son of John Maxwell, 1st Baron Farnham, in 1759.

Although he frequently returned to Paris between 1729 and 1733, his permanent residence was in London. In , his residence in London was burned to the ground, and it is generally assumed that Cantillon died in the fire. While the fire&#x27;s causes are unclear, the most widely accepted theory is that Cantillon was murdered. One of Cantillon&#x27;s biographers, Antoine Murphy, has advanced the alternative theory that Cantillon staged his own death to escape the harassment of his debtors, appearing in Suriname under the name Chevalier de Louvigny.

After his death, his widow married François de Bulkeley, son of Hon. Henry Bulkeley (himself son of the 1st Viscount Bulkeley) and Sophia Stuart (sister of the Duchess of Richmond, daughter of Dr. Walter Stewart and granddaughter of the 1st Lord Blantyre), and a sister of Anne, Duchess of Berwick (second wife of James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick).

<text>The second USS &quot;Fresno&quot; (CL-121) was a United States Navy &quot;Juneau&quot;-class light cruiser launched on 5 March 1946 by Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company of Kearny, New Jersey, sponsored by Mrs. Ruth R. Martin; and commissioned on 27 November 1946, with Captain Elliott Bowman Strauss in command. She was reclassified CLAA-121 on 18 March 1949.

==Service history==
During her first operational cruise, from 13 January-7 May 1947, &quot;Fresno&quot; not only concluded her preliminary training in the Caribbean, but also visited Montevideo, Uruguay, during a presidential inauguration and called at Rio de Janeiro. On 1 August, she sailed from Norfolk, Virginia for a tour of duty which took her to ports both of northern Europe and the Mediterranean, returning to Norfolk on 1 December.

A second overseas deployment, from 3 March-19 June 1948, found &quot;Fresno&quot; visiting Amsterdam, Dublin, Bergen, and Copenhagen from her overseas base at Plymouth, England. Her coastwise operations from Norfolk included cruises to Prince Edward Island and Bermuda prior to her decommissioning at New York Naval Shipyard on 17 May 1949. Placed in reserve, she was berthed at Bayonne, New Jersey. She was sold for scrap on 17 June 1966.

<text>Citypoint (previously known as Britannic House and Britannic Tower) is a building located on Ropemaker Street on the northern fringe of the City of London, the main financial district and historic nucleus of London.

Originally named Britannic House, Citypoint was built in 1967 as a 35-storey, tall headquarters for British Petroleum (now BP), becoming the first building in the City of London area to exceed the height of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. The designers were F. Milton Cashmore and H. N. W. Grosvenor. In 1991 British Petroleum moved back to their original headquarters on Finsbury Circus and the building was renamed Britannic Tower.

It was refurbished in 2000, with additional floor space and the height increased to . The designer for the refurbishment was Sheppard Robson. It was renamed Citypoint after its refurbishment.

Citypoint is the 13th-tallest building in the City and the 63rd-tallest in Greater London.

In August 2005 its owner, Pillar Properties, sold the building for more than £500 million in one of the largest deals ever seen in the City office market.

In early 2007 the building was again put on the market, this time for £650 million, and purchased by Beacon Capital Partners, a private American company. At the time it was the most expensive building sale in the United Kingdom. A few months later, the sale of 8 Canada Square at Canary Wharf eclipsed this when it was sold for over £1 billion.

A number of other large buildings have been constructed nearby, including The Heron, a 36-storey residential tower at Milton Court and a office tower at Ropemaker Place developed by British Land.

<text>Lou Blonger (May 13, 1849 – April 20, 1924), born Louis Herbert Belonger, was a Wild West saloonkeeper, gambling-house owner, and mine speculator, but is best known as the kingpin of an extensive ring of confidence tricksters that operated for more than 25 years in Denver, Colorado. His &quot;Million-Dollar Bunco Ring&quot; was brought to justice in a famous trial in 1923.

Blonger&#x27;s gang set up rooms resembling stock exchanges and betting parlors that were used by several teams to run &quot;big cons&quot;. The goal of the con was to convince tourists to put up large sums of cash in order to secure delivery of stock profits or winning bets. The depiction of the &quot;Wire Con&quot; seen in the movie &quot;The Sting&quot; is a fairly accurate representation of a typical big con.

Blonger had longstanding ties to numerous Denver politicians and law enforcement officials, including the mayor and the chief of police. In 1922, however, District Attorney Philip S. Van Cise bypassed the Denver police and used his own force, funded by donations solicited in secret from local citizens, to arrest 33 con men, including Blonger, and bring the ring to justice.

== Childhood ==

Lou Blonger was born in Swanton, Vermont, on May 13, 1849, the eighth of 13 children. His father, Simon Peter Belonger, was a stonemason born in Canada of French ancestry. His mother, Judith Kennedy, was raised in an orphanage in Nenagh, County Tipperary, Ireland. The Belonger family migrated from Vermont to the lead mining village of Shullsburg, Wisconsin, when Lou was five years old. After his mother died in 1859, Lou lived with his older sister and her husband for a few years. Around this time Blonger began using a shortened version of the family name (omitting the first &quot;e&quot;), as most of his brothers did.

Blonger followed brothers Mike and Joe into the Union Army in 1864. Although he was still three days shy of his 15th birthday, Blonger was mustered in as a fifer at Warren, Illinois, and served a few weeks with Company B of the 142nd Illinois Regiment before suffering a leg injury at White Station, Tennessee. He spent the remainder of his 100-day enlistment recovering at the Marine Hospital in Chicago.

At the conclusion of the Civil War, Blonger reunited with his brother Sam, ten years his elder, who had spent the war years prospecting in Colorado and driving freight over the mountains in California and Nevada. Lou was living in Mount Carroll, Illinois, with a friend named William Livingston when Sam returned. While Sam courted and eventually married Livingston&#x27;s sister Ella, Lou attended high school. Later Sam sent his brother to study at Bryant &amp; Stratton Business College in Chicago.

== In the Western boomtowns ==

In 1870 Sam and Lou Blonger, along with many of the Livingstons, left the Midwest for the western frontier. Following the path of the newly completed Transcontinental Railroad, they briefly ran a hotel and saloon in Red Oak, Iowa, before moving on to Salt Lake City, Utah and the nearby mining towns of Stockton and Dry Canyon. In a pattern that repeated itself at many of their stops, Lou owned and operated saloons with assorted entertainments while Sam developed mining claims in the surrounding mountains, served occasionally as a peace officer and, in his spare time, raced horses. Similar stops followed in Virginia City, Nevada; Cornucopia, Nevada; Silver Reef, Utah; and again in Salt Lake City.

Moving to Colorado in 1879, Lou Blonger took a shot at running a vaudeville theater in Georgetown, while Sam made an unsuccessful bid to become the first mayor of nearby Leadville. There the Blongers were joined by two other brothers: Simon, the eldest, who worked as superintendent at the Robert E. Lee Mine, and Marvin, the youngest, also a miner. Soon afterward, Sam and Lou were on the move again, this time to the burgeoning railroad town of New Albuquerque, New Mexico (soon to merge with Albuquerque).

== Albuquerque days ==

Sam Blonger was appointed marshal of New Albuquerque in February 1882 and quickly deputized his brother. Newspaper accounts indicate that while the brothers engaged in a few shootouts and jailed their share of vagrants, they also took plenty of time off to pursue other interests: prospecting, horse racing, and even running a brothel.

For a couple of months the Blongers were toasted as the solution to the town&#x27;s law enforcement problem (a previous marshal, Milt Yarberry, had murdered two citizens). When Sam and Lou were joined briefly by brother Joe, a prospector in the nearby Cerrillos Hills, a local newspaper wrote: &quot;The three brothers are all of them young, nervy and square western men and it would be a good thing for the town if they were all on the police force.&quot;

In April 1882, Lou Blonger served as acting town marshal while Sam traveled to Denver to negotiate the sale of a mine. Lou&#x27;s stint roughly coincided with the escape to New Mexico by the Vendetta Posse, composed of Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and five others. Hoping to make their way to legal sanctuary in Colorado, the men took temporary refuge in New Albuquerque after killing several men to avenge the murder of Wyatt&#x27;s brother Morgan. According to one theory, Lou or Sam (or both) may have been called upon to provide shelter for the posse members during their stay.

Sam Blonger&#x27;s appointment as marshal of New Albuquerque lasted just five months. He was relieved of his duties while on a trip to Kansas City, and soon afterward, Lou and Sam split up for the only extended period of their adult lives. Lou spent the next few years in the New Mexico towns of Silver City, Deming, and Kingston, living at least part of the time with Frank Thurmond, a well-known gambler, and his wife, Carlotta Thompkins (better known as Lottie Deno). Blonger also got married, probably in 1884, to Emma Loring.

In 1888, a woman calling herself Kitty Blonger shot and killed a man who tried to break into her room in a Peach Springs, Arizona, brothel. Lou Blonger soon arrived to arrange her defense, and eventually she was acquitted. Kitty had previously worked in Albuquerque, where she had a soiled reputation. She may have been one of Blonger&#x27;s madams, but the exact nature of their relationship has not been determined.

== The Denver underworld ==
Soon after the Kitty Blonger trial, Lou Blonger relocated permanently to Denver, rejoining his brother Sam. The pair operated several saloons and gambling houses in the area of Larimer Street and Seventeenth Street over the next few years, including the magnificent Elite Saloon at 1628 Stout Street, with its mahogany fixtures and frescoed ceiling. In addition to hosting the typical array of poker and faro tables, the Blongers&#x27; operation also branched out into the &quot;policy racket&quot; (also known as the &quot;numbers game&quot;), an illegal lottery that paid out on a daily basis. The Blongers aggressively targeted tourists, who were lured to the saloon by a network of henchmen called &quot;steerers&quot; and then cheated out of their money. The sophistication of the swindles developed over time. In the early years they were as simple as marked cards or loaded dice; later, elaborate &quot;big cons&quot; became the Blonger trademark.

Denver had a reputation as a wide-open town in the 1890s. Gambling shops bought protection from the police force and the mayor&#x27;s office and operated openly except when occasional crackdowns were required for show. In addition to making direct payments to authorities, Sam and Lou Blonger also engaged in election fraud for candidates from both parties, from Denver mayor Wolfe Londoner in 1890 to Congressman Robert W. Bonynge in 1902. Testimony in the latter case indicated that Blonger&#x27;s network of steerers had already been in place for several years.

The Blongers&#x27; policy shop had plenty of competition, including saloon man Ed Chase and Soapy Smith, the famous Western con man. Smith was an uneasy Blonger ally for a while, but the frequent quarrels between steerers from the rival groups suggested a confrontation was brewing. In 1895 Smith went on a drunken rampage through several Larimer Street establishments including the Blongers&#x27; saloon, where police removed him; one account alleged that Lou Blonger was crouched behind the cigar counter, ready to unload a shotgun. In the wake of the rampage, Smith and his brother Bascomb were charged with the attempted murder of a saloon manager. Realizing he had lost control of the situation, Soapy left for the mining boomtown of Skagway, Alaska, in 1897, ceding control of Denver&#x27;s underworld to Lou Blonger.

== The Forest Queen ==

In 1892 Sam and Lou Blonger found the gold mine they had been looking for in the mountains above Cripple Creek, Colorado, and named it the Forest Queen (). Sam and Lou had several partners in the mine at different stages of its development, some of whom were extraordinarily well-placed. Two of them, Neil Dennison and Robert W. Steele, served as district attorney in Denver during the 1890s. Dennison was the son of a former governor of Ohio and Steele later became chief justice of the Colorado Supreme Court. A third partner of note was J. W. McCulloch, manufacturer of Green River Whiskey, who supposedly traded 20 barrels of his product for a piece of Lou Blonger&#x27;s stake.

Once developed, the Forest Queen provided its owners with periods of steady income, if not the fortune that came out of the nearby Independence Mine. Lou and Sam Blonger claimed, bought, traded, and sold several mines in their lives, but both held onto the Forest Queen to the end, leaving their interest to their wives.

The Blongers were keen observers in the frequent labor struggles between miners and mine owners. Conditions reached a head in 1894 during the &quot;Battle of Bull Hill&quot;, when striking miners took up arms in the hills near the Forest Queen. Lou Blonger and several allies from Denver were frequent visitors to the area during the months-long dispute and its aftermath, calling themselves &quot;detectives&quot;.

==&quot;Million-Dollar Bunco Ring&quot;==

As his gang branched out into bigger and more complicated &quot;big cons&quot; that attracted a more well-to-do clientele, Lou Blonger found he no longer needed his saloon and the relatively small take it provided from card and dice games. Eventually he moved into headquarters in the American National Bank building on Seventeenth Street and styled himself as a mining magnate. A crucial moment in the development of the bunco gang was Blonger&#x27;s partnership in 1904 with Adolph W. Duff, who had operated his own gang of confidence men in Colorado Springs before being run out of town by the police. With Duff handling the details of coordinating gang members and scheduling locations for the scams, Blonger was free to conduct the business of schmoozing public officials and bribing law enforcement, all while cultivating the image of a model citizen. In the summertime he made the rounds of friendly politicians and policemen, paying off favors with boxes of cherries from his orchard in suburban Lakewood.

For the next 18 years Blonger and his gang operated virtually unmolested by local law enforcement. Gang members were specifically instructed not to solicit victims from Colorado, concentrating instead on out-of-state tourists who would find it difficult to help prosecute a criminal case. Only twice during this period did Blonger come close to arrest. The first was in 1910, when he escaped prosecution in connection with the Maybray Gang of Council Bluffs, Iowa. The second occurred in 1915, when Blonger was implicated in a swindling scheme uncovered by carpenters remodeling his office building.

Sam Blonger&#x27;s participation in his brother&#x27;s gang waned as bigger and more sophisticated cons were developed, and he died in 1914. Meanwhile, Lou Blonger expanded the gang&#x27;s home base from Denver, where it operated only during the warmest months, southward to Miami and Havana, Cuba. During the winter Blonger relaxed at Hot Springs, Arkansas, where he reportedly compared notes with his old friend Allan Pinkerton, president of the Pinkerton Detective Agency.

=== Investigation and arrest ===

During the 1920 primary election for Denver district attorney, Blonger approached Republican Party candidate Philip S. Van Cise and offered assistance in the way of campaign contributions and votes. To Blonger&#x27;s surprise, Van Cise turned down his offer, and after his election, Van Cise called Blonger into his office to warn him that one of his goals would be the eradication of Blonger&#x27;s gang of con men. Recognizing that the police force was in Blonger&#x27;s pocket, Van Cise undertook a private investigation underwritten by donations from 31 wealthy benefactors. Over the course of a year, his detectives gathered information and watched the habits and movements of the gang members. Van Cise monitored Blonger&#x27;s trash, spied on him from a building across the street, and had a Dictaphone installed surreptitiously inside his office (an action that did not require a search warrant at the time). He also allowed a crooked police detective to work inside the district attorney&#x27;s office, feeding him misleading information to confuse the gang.

In the summer of 1922, Van Cise made it well known he was going on a long fishing vacation to the Rocky Mountains, signaling to the gang members that the heat was off their operation. While the con men plied their trade openly on the streets of Denver, Van Cise and his assistants plotted a huge roundup that required a willing victim to help catch the gang in the act. With incredible good fortune, J. Frank Norfleet showed up in Denver at precisely this moment. Norfleet was a Texas rancher who had previously been scammed twice by other gangs and was on a nationwide manhunt to bring the men who swindled him to justice. Entering the lobby of the Brown Palace Hotel, Norfleet was hooked by unwitting gang members who saw him as an easy mark, and the plan was set in motion.

The posse assembled early on the morning of August 24, 1922: eighteen Colorado Rangers to arrest the gang members and several private citizens to chauffeur them to a holding cell in the basement of the First Universalist Church. Blonger and Duff were among the first to be arrested; eventually 33 gang members were hauled in before news of the raid reached the street, allowing the remainder of the gang to flee.

Although newspapers across the country carried the particulars of the unusual sting, the &quot;Denver Post&quot; at first declined to print Blonger&#x27;s name. Co-publisher Harry Heye Tammen was a close friend of Blonger&#x27;s, but his partner Fred Bonfils ordered the paper&#x27;s editors to end the embargo and support Van Cise and the prosecution of the &quot;Million-Dollar Bunco Ring&quot;. The nickname the papers hung on the gang didn&#x27;t tell half the story. The con men&#x27;s total haul was impossible to determine, but in any case was well in excess of a million dollars per year.

=== Trial ===

Blonger had a host of legal talent at his disposal, not to mention a sympathetic judge or two. His personal lawyer, Thomas Ward, Jr., was a former U.S. district attorney who had argued cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. While the rest of the gang was represented by lesser names, they all benefited from the roadblocks laid down by the lead lawyers in the conspiracy case. The defense successfully fought to have Van Cise removed from the prosecution of the case on a technicality, but Van Cise considered this a tactical error, since it allowed him to spend more time devising the prosecution&#x27;s strategy and less time in court. The case proceeded with two special prosecutors, S. Harrison White, former chief justice of the Colorado Supreme Court, and Harry C. Riddle, a former district court judge.

The trial began on February 5, 1923. Day after day the prosecution called a series of victims, bilked out of their life savings, to the stand. The star witness, however, was Len Reamey, one of the gang&#x27;s bookmakers, fourth in the hierarchy behind Blonger, Duff, and bookmaker Jackie French. Reamey provided the inside story of how the gang defrauded hundreds of victims and divided the spoils among themselves. When the prosecution rested after seven weeks of testimony, the defense attorneys surprised everyone by resting their case without presenting a witness, and further by offering to forgo their closing arguments if the prosecution did the same. Van Cise directed the special prosecutors to call their bluff, and so the case went immediately to the jury without any closing arguments.

During the trial rumors were rampant that the jury had been fixed. Blonger&#x27;s men approached at least four of the jurors, but struck out when they attempted to bribe Herman M. Okuly, a mechanic. Okuly played along with the offer, but immediately reported the deal to his boss, who informed Van Cise. After four days of deliberations, with three jurors still favoring acquittal, Okuly played his ace, telling the holdouts &quot;the difference between me and you is that I got my five hundred dollars, but turned it over to the Judge, and you&#x27;ve still got yours.&quot; The three relented, and on March 28, 1923, the jury returned a verdict of guilty against Blonger and the other 19 defendants who remained on trial. 

== Incarceration and death ==

Blonger&#x27;s health, poor even before his arrest, grew increasingly worse during the long trial. In the days after his conviction, while he was still battling to stay out of prison, Blonger received a final blow when the &quot;Denver Post&quot; revealed that he had led a double life for 20 years, living with his wife, Nola, on weekends and a mistress, Iola Readon, during the week. Rocked by the revelation, he reconciled with his wife, transferring his property to her in anticipation of his incarceration.

As one legal appeal after another failed, Blonger made a final plea to Van Cise to remain free, a plea the district attorney forcefully rejected:

Blonger was driven in a special car to the Colorado State Penitentiary on October 18, 1923, and died there on April 20, 1924, succumbing to organ failure. His funeral, held at Denver&#x27;s Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, was attended by hundreds of people from all walks of life. Despite his wishes to be buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery, his wife directed that he be interred at Fairmount Cemetery instead.

==Family==

Lou Blonger married twice. In 1882 or 1884 in San Francisco, he married Emma Loring, about whom nothing is known. Blonger received an uncontested divorce in 1889 on the grounds of desertion and quickly married 30-year-old Cora &quot;Nola&quot; Lyons (née Morehouse), who was said in younger days to have been a &quot;successful variety actress.&quot; Blonger had no children. Upon Nola&#x27;s death the remainder of Blonger&#x27;s estate, including his interest in the Forest Queen Mine, passed to her fourth husband, William J. MacAuley.

<text>USS &quot;Galveston&quot; (CL-93/CLG-3) was a light cruiser of the United States Navy that was later converted to a guided missile cruiser. She was launched by William Cramp &amp; Sons Shipbuilding Company, Philadelphia 22 April 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Clark Wallace Thompson. The cruiser&#x27;s construction was suspended when nearly complete on 24 June 1946; and the hull assigned to the Philadelphia Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She was reclassified CLG-93 on 4 February 1956; then reclassified to CLG-3 on 23 May 1957; and commissioned at Philadelphia 28 May 1958.

==1958–1960==
Refit as a &quot;Galveston&quot;-class guided missile light cruiser, the warship departed Philadelphia on 30 June 1958 for builder&#x27;s trials out of Norfolk, Va., in the Virginia Capes area, that included &quot;highly successful&quot; tests of her new Talos missile and tracking gear. The Talos supersonic surface-to-air missile was 38 ft long, weighed nearly 3,000 pounds (1,400 kg), and was powered by a novel 20,053 lbf ramjet engine, plus a solid-fuel rocket booster. With a range of over 65 miles (105 km) for early variants, and over 100 for later ones, and speeds of up to Mach 4, it was designed to destroy enemy aircraft at high altitudes using either a conventional or atomic warhead. She finished out the year with operations in the Norfolk area.

&quot;Galveston&quot; arrived at San Juan, Puerto Rico, on 16 January 1959, for training and evaluation operations in the waters of the West Indies. She successfully launched the first Talos missile ever fired at sea on 24 February 1959. The Talos was termed by Admiral Arleigh Burke as &quot;the best antiaircraft missile in any arsenal in the world&quot;. &quot;Galveston&quot; reported the shot &quot;hot, straight and normal&quot; as she proudly proved her capability as one of the most mighty warships of the modern United States Navy. The cruiser set course for Norfolk on 17 March and a special yard period in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.

In July 1959, &quot;Galveston&quot; conducted shakedown and acceptance trials in the Virginia Capes area, followed by a refresher training cruise to waters off Cuba and the testing of her radar and communications in war games with the U.S. Air Force. On 4 January 1960, she departed Norfolk for a visit to Charleston, South Carolina, and operations off the Florida coast, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. She then headed to her namesake city of &quot;Galveston&quot;, arriving on 16 February for a Silver Service presentation. Returning to Norfolk, the cruiser unloaded her ammunition for shock tests off the Bahamas, then entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 25 March 1960 for a yard period that extended into the fall. During this time the cruiser entertained more than 30,000 visitors. She headed for the Virginia Capes 24 October 1960, successfully completing her first missile transfer at sea.

==1961==
On 6 January 1961, &quot;Galveston&quot; departed Norfolk for more Bureau of Naval Weapons technical evaluation of her Talos missile systems, including tests of the IV Talos, its capabilities and potentials, in areas off Jacksonville, Florida, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. These evaluations completed 1 March, she departed San Juan for refresher training and her final acceptance trial out of Guantanamo Bay. The cruiser returned to Norfolk on 9 April, but soon steamed to Jacksonville, where on 8 May she began duty under the Operational Technical Evaluation Force that included extensive testing of her missile system and many Talos firings. The effectiveness of the system and the weapon were demonstrated by a new, long-range record as well as a successful two-missile salvo shot. The Talos missile cruiser entertained over 17,000 visitors at Cape Canaveral on the Armed Forces weekend celebration in May; completed later phases of her evaluation exercises in the Caribbean through 21 July 1960; then visited Bayonne, New Jersey, where her missile fire-control radars were removed in preparation for overhaul. &quot;Galveston&quot; was overhauled in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard (30 August 1961 – 23 July 1962). This overhaul included modifications to the fire control system of the Talos missile.

The visit to Charleston was for electronic equipment repair. She had to go in at low tide, and lightning rods had to be lowered to pass under the Charleston bridge.

==1962–1964==
&quot;Galveston&quot; departed Philadelphia on 23 July 1962, transited the Panama Canal for San Diego, California; and joined Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla 9, U.S. Pacific Fleet, on 24 August 1962. While home-ported in San Diego she continued trials with the Talos. The Talos was fired successfully at an old destroyer escort, striking it above decks and exiting above the waterline. No explosives were used. She operated along the West Coast until October 1963 when she sailed for the Western Pacific as flagship of the flotilla. During the next six months she operated in the Far East with the 7th Fleet off Japan, Taiwan, and Okinawa. She returned to San Diego 16 April 1964 and resumed West Coast training.

==1965==
Following a four-month overhaul from October 1964 to February 1965, &quot;Galveston&quot; departed San Diego 4 June for operations off the coast of South Vietnam. She touched at Subic Bay, Philippines, 21 June, then sailed to join the 7th Fleet in the South China Sea. During the next 5 months she ranged the Southeast Asian waters from the Gulf of Thailand to the Gulf of Tonkin while supporting the American effort to repel Communist aggression in South Vietnam. She provided gunfire support during search-and-clear operations at Chu Lai and at the Vung Tuong Peninsula. In addition she provided air defense for 7th Fleet carriers in the South China Sea and conducted search and rescue operations in the Gulf of Tonkin. She departed the Philippines on 2 December and arrived at San Diego on 18 December.

==1966–1967==
Resuming operations early in January 1966, &quot;Galveston&quot; operated out of San Diego to the Hawaiian Islands and along the California coast while keeping her crew and equipment in a peak state of readiness. From 31 July to 4 November she underwent modernization overhaul, then she resumed training for the remainder of 1966. Early in 1967 she departed San Diego for the East Coast, and for much of the rest of that year was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet for duty in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.

==1968–1969==
On 19 October 1968, &quot;Galveston&quot; departed Seal Beach, California on her final Westpac tour. She divided her time between operations on Yankee Station in the north and the Da Nang area in the south where she temporarily replaced the on the gun line, firing 3,500 rounds of ammunition from her 5&quot;/38 and 6-inch/47-caliber guns in one nine-day period. She effectively supported Republic of Korea Marines in the Delta area. &quot;Galveston&quot; returned to San Diego on 2 February 1969. She departed San Diego for the East Coast and duty with the Atlantic Fleet performing duties in the Mediterranean. In 1970 she was placed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet, San Diego and in 1975 was sold for scrap to National Metal and Steel Corp.

==In popular culture==
The 1963-1964 Far East tour was commemorated in the large back patch on the G-1 flight jacket worn by lead Tom Cruise in the 1986 film Top Gun. Retired U.S. Navy Commander Michael Dahm theorizes the patch may have been a reference to real U.S. Navy pilot Harry J. Post, commanding officer of the Navy&#x27;s first Fighter Weapons School. Post had been the only naval aviator on board on the tour.

<text>SMS (&quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Ship ) was the lead ship of her class of light cruisers built by the German (Imperial Navy). Named after Königsberg, the capital of East Prussia, she was laid down in January 1905, launched in December of that year and completed by June 1906. Her class included three other ships: , , and . was armed with a main battery of ten guns and had a top speed of .

After her commissioning, served with the High Seas Fleet&#x27;s reconnaissance force. During this period, she frequently escorted Kaiser Wilhelm II&#x27;s yacht on visits to foreign countries. In April 1914, the ship was sent on what was to have been a two-year deployment to German East Africa, but this was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I in August of that year. initially attempted to raid British and French commercial traffic in the region, but only destroyed one merchant ship in the course of her career. Coal shortages hampered her ability to attack shipping. On 20 September 1914, she surprised and sank the British protected cruiser in the Battle of Zanzibar.

 then retreated into the Rufiji River to repair her engines. Before the repairs could be completed, British cruisers located , and, unable to steam into the river to destroy her, set up a blockade. After several attempts to sink the ship during the Battle of Rufiji Delta, the British sent two monitors, and , to destroy the German cruiser. On 11 July 1915, the two monitors got close enough to severely damage , forcing her crew to scuttle the ship. The surviving crew salvaged all ten of her main guns and joined Lieutenant Colonel Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck&#x27;s guerrilla campaign in East Africa. was partially broken up in 1963–1965 for scrap, and the remains sank into the riverbed.

==Design==
 and her sisters were designed to serve both as fleet scouts in home waters and in Germany&#x27;s colonial empire. This was a result of budgetary constraints that prevented the (Imperial Navy) from building more specialized cruisers suitable for both roles. The class was an iterative development of the preceding . All four members of the class were intended to be identical, but after the initial vessel was begun, the design staff incorporated lessons from the Russo-Japanese War. These included internal rearrangements and a lengthening of the hull.

 was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced normally and up to at full load. The ship had a minimal superstructure, which consisted of a small conning tower and bridge structure. Her hull had a raised forecastle and quarterdeck, along with a pronounced ram bow. She was fitted with two pole masts. had a crew of 14 officers and 308 enlisted men.

Her propulsion system consisted of two 3-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines that drove a pair of screw propellers. Steam was provided by eleven coal-fired water-tube boilers that were vented through three funnels. The ship&#x27;s propulsion system was rated to produce for a top speed of , though she exceeded these figures in service. Normal coal storage amounted to . At a more economical pace of , the ship had a range of approximately .

The ship was armed with a main battery of ten SK L/40 guns in single pedestal mounts. There were two side by side forward on the forecastle; six on the broadside, three on either side; and two side by side aft. The guns had a maximum elevation of 30 degrees, which allowed them to engage targets out to . They were supplied with 1,500 rounds of ammunition, for 150 shells per gun. also carried ten SK guns in single mounts. She was also equipped with a pair of torpedo tubes with five torpedoes submerged in the hull on the broadside. 

The ship was protected by a curved armor deck that was thick amidships. The deck sloped downward at the sides, with a thickness of , to provide protection against enemy fire. The conning tower sides were thick. Her main battery guns were fitted with thick gun shields.

==Service history==
===Construction and early career===
 was ordered under the contract name &quot; &quot; and was laid down at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel on 12 January 1905. She was launched on 12 December 1905, when the of Königsberg, Siegfried Körte, christened the ship, after which fitting-out work commenced. She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet for sea trials on 6 April 1907. Her trials were interrupted at the beginning of June when she was tasked with escorting Kaiser Wilhelm II&#x27;s yacht during three sailing regattas including Kiel Week. The two ships then cruised the North Sea and stopped at Nordkapp, where from 3 to 6 August, Wilhelm II met Czar Nicholas II of Russia. After returning to Germany, resumed her sea trials, which lasted from 9 August to 9 September. She visited her namesake city from 21 to 23 September and was later assigned to the fleet scouting forces to replace the cruiser on 5 November. At this time, was again used to escort Wilhelm II&#x27;s yacht, this time in company with the new armored cruiser and the dispatch boat on a visit to Britain. The ships stopped in Portsmouth and the Thames, and were visited by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands.

On 17 December, was tasked with another goodwill visit, this time escorting the Kaiser&#x27;s brother, Prince Heinrich, and a delegation of naval officers to Malmö, Sweden to meet King Oscar II. The visit lasted until 20 December. participated in the normal peacetime routine of individual and squadron training for 1908 without incident. The year ended with a major training cruise, first in the Baltic and North Sea and later into the Atlantic, that ended in early December. The ship then went into drydock over the winter of 1908–09 for periodic maintenance, emerging for service again in early February 1909. A typical training routine followed for the next two years, interrupted only by a collision with the new cruiser on 16 February 1910 in the Kiel Bay, and two trips escorting the Kaiser in 1910; the first to Helgoland on 9–13 March and the second to Britain from 8 to 27 May. The collision with caused significant damage to both ships, though no one on either vessel was injured. Both ships were repaired in Kiel. also won the Kaiser&#x27;s (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery in the reconnaissance force during this period. From December 1909 to September 1910, (Frigate Captain) Adolf von Trotha served as the ship&#x27;s commander.

From 8 March to 22 May 1911, cruised in the Mediterranean Sea with Wilhelm II aboard . On 10 June, was replaced in the reconnaissance force by the new cruiser ; was transferred to Danzig, where she was placed out of service on 14 June for modernization work. On 22 January 1913, the ship was recommissioned for service with the fleet, to replace the cruiser which was also being modernized. This service lasted until 19 June, when was again placed in reserve in Kiel. During this period of active service, she was assigned to the training squadron from 1 to 18 April. In early 1914, the high command decided to send to German East Africa, where she would replace the current station ship, the old unprotected cruiser .

===East Africa station===
On 1 April 1914, Max Looff took command of the ship. left Kiel on 25 April, stopped in Wilhelmshaven, and then left three days later for a two-year deployment to German East Africa. She steamed into the Mediterranean Sea and stopped in Spanish and Italian ports before entering the Suez Canal. After passing through the canal, she stopped briefly in Aden before arriving in Dar es Salaam, the capital of German East Africa, on 5 June. Two days later, the (Protection Force) celebrated their 25th anniversary in the colony; the deputy commander of the presented Looff with a model of the cruiser , which had been the longest serving warship with the unit. surveyed the harbor at Bagamoyo later in the year. The African colonial subjects considered the ship to be quite impressive, particularly her three funnels, which were assumed to signify a warship more powerful than one with only two funnels. The ship acquired the nickname &quot;Manowari na bomba tatu&quot;, or &quot;the man of war with three pipes&quot;.

As tensions in Europe rose in the aftermath of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, Looff decided to abandon the normal peacetime training schedule and returned to Dar es Salaam on 24 July to replenish his coal and other stores. He also made efforts to organize a coast watcher network to report enemy ships and to protect German shipping in the area. On 27 July, Looff received a message from the (Admiralty Staff) informing him of the worsening political situation in Europe. Concurrently, the cruisers of the British Cape Squadron, , , and , arrived with the intention of bottling up at the colony&#x27;s capital Dar es Salaam. Looff got his ship ready to sail and left port on the afternoon of 31 July 1914, with the three slower British ships shadowing him. Looff used a rain squall and his ship&#x27;s superior speed to break contact with his British pursuers the following day. steamed off Aden until 5 August, when word of the outbreak of hostilities between Britain and Germany belatedly reached the ship.

====World War I====
At the outbreak of World War I, was ordered to attack British commerce around the entrance to the Red Sea. A lack of coal hampered Looff&#x27;s efforts; the British prevented his collier from leaving Dar es Salaam and purchased all the coal in Portuguese East Africa to deny it to . Looff then radioed the German steamer to warn her against using the Suez Canal, where she would have been confiscated. chased after the German freighter , whose officers mistook the ship for a British cruiser and refused to stop. was forced to fire a warning shot across the bow of to force the ship to stop so that Looff could warn her captain of the state of war.

On 6 August, found a British ship off the coast of Oman, the freighter &quot;City of Winchester&quot;. A prize crew took the ship along with , and the two vessels met four days later in the Khuriya Muriya Islands, where coal from &quot;City of Winchester&quot; was transferred to . The freighter was thereafter sunk. The British crew was taken aboard , which departed the following day and stopped in Mozambique. Meanwhile, the steamer &quot;Somali&quot;, under the command of (Corvette Captain) Zimmer, had left Dar es Salaam with a cargo of of coal on the night of 3–4 August to resupply ; the two ships met ten days later. By the time Looff rendezvoused with &quot;Somali&quot;, his ship was down to a mere of coal. &quot;Somali&quot; transferred some of coal to the cruiser, which permitted a sweep to Madagascar. No British or French ships were found, however, and so met &quot;Somali&quot; again on 23 August and took on coal for four days of cruising.

In the meantime, British warships bombarded Dar es Salaam and destroyed the German wireless station there. By this time, ″s engines required a thorough overhaul, and Looff needed to find a secluded area where the work could be completed. He settled on the Rufiji Delta, which had recently been surveyed by the survey ship . On 3 September 1914 at high tide, passed over the bar at the mouth of the Rufiji and slowly made her way up the river. Coast watchers were stationed at the mouth of the river and telegraph lines were run to ensure the Germans would not be surprised by British ships searching for them. Zimmer, who was sending small coastal steamers to resupply , observed a British cruiser—&quot;Pegasus&quot;—patrolling the coast for two weeks. He deduced that the ship would likely have to coal at Zanzibar on Sundays, and so Looff decided to attack the ship in port before he began his overhaul. He considered the action justified, since Britain had rejected a German proposal to keep central Africa neutral according to the Congo Act of 1885.

On 19 September, left the Rufiji and arrived off Zanzibar the following morning. She opened fire at a range of about at 05:10, starting the Battle of Zanzibar; within 45 minutes, &quot;Pegasus&quot; caught fire, rolled over to port, and sank. Crewmen aboard &quot;Pegasus&quot; had raised a white flag, but it could not be seen aboard due to the heavy smoke. &quot;Pegasus&quot;″s crew suffered 38 dead and 55 wounded, while was undamaged and had no casualties. After sinking &quot;Pegasus&quot;, bombarded the wireless station and dumped barrels filled with sand into the harbor entrance to simulate mines. While leaving the harbor, spotted the picket ship and sank her with three shells.

The cruiser then returned to the Rufiji River so work could begin on overhauling her engines; the parts would need to be transported overland to the shipyard in Dar es Salaam where they could be rebuilt. While moored in the town of Salale, the ship was heavily camouflaged and defensive arrangements were erected. These included positioning soldiers and field guns to defend the approaches to the cruiser and establishing a network of coast watchers and telegraph lines to watch for hostile ships. An improvised minefield was also laid in the delta to keep the British ships from entering the river.

Concerned with the threat posed to troop transports from India, the British reinforced the flotilla tasked with tracking down the elusive German raider, and placed the ships under the command of Captain Sidney R. Drury-Lowe. The sinking of &quot;Pegasus&quot; convinced the British that must still be in German East Africa. On 19 October, the cruiser found the German East Africa Line ship at Lindi. A boarding party searched the ship and discovered documents indicating she had supplied with coal in the Rufiji the previous month. On 30 October, the cruiser located and &quot;Somali&quot; in the delta. The cruisers &quot;Chatham&quot;, &quot;Dartmouth&quot;, and blockaded the Rufiji Delta to ensure could not escape.

=====Battle of Rufiji Delta=====

On 3 November, the British began a bombardment in an attempt to destroy or neutralize and &quot;Somali&quot;. was protected by the thick mangrove swamps, which concealed the ship and offered a degree of cover from British shellfire, especially while the British ships remained outside the river. A collier, &quot;Newbridge&quot;, was converted into a blockship to be sunk in the main channel of the delta to prevent ″s escape. Despite heavy German fire from both sides of the river, the British successfully sank &quot;Newbridge&quot; across one of the delta mouths on 10 November, though the German raider could still put to sea via other channels. Looff decided to move his ship further upriver, to make it more difficult for the British to destroy her. In doing so, his ship would occupy a disproportionate number of British vessels that could otherwise have been employed elsewhere. In the course of the campaign, the British reinforced the squadron blockading the Rufiji with additional cruisers, including and the Australian .

A civilian pilot, Dennis Cutler of Durban, South Africa, was commissioned into the Royal Marines and persuaded to make his private Curtiss seaplane available for the British Empire. The Royal Navy requisitioned the passenger ship to serve as a makeshift tender for Cutler&#x27;s aircraft. On his first attempt to locate the cruiser, Cutler, who did not have a compass, got lost and was forced to land on a desert island. On his second flight, he successfully located , and a third flight with a Royal Navy observer confirmed his observations. His aircraft&#x27;s radiator was damaged on the flight by ground fire and he was grounded until replacement parts could be brought from Mombasa. A pair of Royal Naval Air Service Sopwiths were brought up with the intention of scouting and even bombing the ship. They soon fell apart in the tropical conditions. A trio of Short seaplanes fared a little better, though they too were quickly disabled by the conditions.

Also in November, the British sought to use the guns of the old battleship to sink the cruiser. The attempt was unsuccessful, once again because the shallow waters prevented the battleship from getting within range. In December, (Lieutenant Colonel) Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck requested as many crew members from the ship as possible for the East Africa Campaign against the British; a total of 220 men were left aboard to keep the ship in fighting condition. This was not enough, however, to permit the ship to go to sea. moved further up the river on 18 December. On 23 December, the British used a pair of shallow-draft ships to sail up the delta. They hit &quot;Somali&quot; once before German defensive fire forced them to retreat.

In the meantime, conditions were deteriorating on . There were shortages of coal, ammunition, food, and medical supplies. Although safe from the British, the crew was ravaged by malaria and other tropical ailments. Generally cut off from the outside world, the morale of the sailors fell. However, the situation was marginally improved with a scheme to resupply the ship and give her a fighting chance to return home. A captured British merchant ship, &quot;Rubens&quot;, was renamed &quot;Kronborg&quot;. It was given a Danish flag, papers, and a crew of German sailors selected for their ability to speak Danish. It was then packed with coal, field guns, ammunition, small arms, and various supplies. As the freighter approached East Africa, prepared to sortie to meet the ship and attempt to break out and return to Germany. Instead, was trapped in the river by two cruisers and several smaller vessels. &quot;Hyacinth&quot; intercepted &quot;Kronborg&quot; as she approached, and chased her to Manza Bay. The trapped ship was forced aground and set on fire, but the Germans salvaged much of her cargo and put it to use later in the East Africa Campaign.

Finally, in April 1915, the British Admiralty agreed to a plan submitted by Drury-Lowe the previous November, which envisioned attacking the German cruiser with shallow-draft monitors, capable of navigating the Rufiji River. Two of the warships, and , armed with a pair of guns each, were brought from Britain. had in the meantime been moved a third time, even further upriver. On 6 July 1915, the two monitors crossed the outer sandbar and steamed up the river, despite heavy fire from German positions on the river banks. They stopped at a point they thought to be from , which would be in range of their own guns but farther than the smaller German guns could reply. Aircraft were used to spot the fall of shot. The monitors&#x27; navigation was faulty, however, and after opening fire, they found themselves to be within range of ″s guns. She hit &quot;Mersey&quot; twice in the engagement; one shell disabled the forward 6-inch gun, and another holed the ship below the waterline. was hit four times in return, one shell striking beneath the waterline and causing some flooding. In the span of three hours, forced both British ships to withdraw.

They returned again on 11 July, after having repaired the damage sustained in the first attempt. The two monitors conducted a five-hour bombardment. opened fire at 12:12, initially with four guns, but only three guns remained in action after 12:42, two guns after 12:44, and one gun after 12:53. The two monitors did not respond until 12:31, once they had been anchored into their firing positions, and scored several serious hits that caused a major fire at the ship&#x27;s stern and inflicted heavy casualties. By 13:40, had run low on ammunition and her gun crews had suffered very heavy casualties, and so Looff ordered the crew to abandon ship and to drop the breech blocks for the guns overboard to disable them. Two torpedo warheads were detonated in the ship&#x27;s bow to scuttle her; the ship rolled over slightly to starboard and sank up to the upper deck with her flags still flying. Nineteen men had been killed in the battle, with another forty-five wounded, including Looff.

Later that day, the crew returned to haul down the ship&#x27;s flag and gave three cheers for the Kaiser. The guns and other usable equipment were salvaged from the wreck starting the following day. The guns were converted into field artillery pieces and coastal guns; together with the ship&#x27;s crew, they went on to see service in the East African land campaign under Lettow-Vorbeck. All ten guns were repaired in Dar es Salaam over the next two months; one was mounted on the converted ferry of the inland Lake Tanganyika fleet. The surviving sailors, organized as the (Königsberg-Detachment), eventually surrendered on 26 November 1917 and were interned in British Egypt. In 1919, after the war, the men took part in a parade through the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin to celebrate their service and that of their ship.

In 1924, John Ingle, the former captain of &quot;Pegasus&quot;, was tasked with clearing wrecks from the harbor in Dar es Salaam. At that time, he bought the salvage rights to for the price of £200; he sent divers to extract non-ferrous scrap metal from the wreck and in turn sold the rights. Salvage work continued into the 1930s, and by the 1940s the hull had rolled over to her starboard side. As late as 1965, salvage work continued, but in 1966 the wreck collapsed and finally sank into the riverbed. Three of the ship&#x27;s 10.5 cm guns are preserved, one in Pretoria, South Africa, one in Jinja, Uganda, and one in Mombasa, along with a gun from &quot;Pegasus&quot;.

<text>The Anglo-Nepalese War (1 November 1814 – 4 March 1816), also known as the Gorkha War, was fought between the Gorkhali army of the Kingdom of Nepal (present-day Nepal) and the forces of the British East India Company (EIC). Both sides had ambitious expansion plans for the mountainous north of the Indian subcontinent. The war ended with a British victory and the signing of the Treaty of Sugauli in 1816, which ceded some of the Nepalese-controlled territory to the EIC. The British war effort was led by the EIC against the Kingdom of Gorkha. Most of the Kingdom of Gorkha&#x27;s war effort was led by the two Thapa families: the Thapa dynasty and the family of Amar Singh Thapa.

==Background==
In the mid-eighteenth century, the British East India Company actively traded with Nepal. Viewed as an opulence hub, Nepal supplied the Company with commodities such as rice, butter, oil seeds, timber, dyes, and gold. In 1767, British concerns around this partnership grew when the Gorkhas ascended their power and leadership in Nepal. In 1768, the Gorkhas conquered Kathmandu Valley and became Nepal’s ruling force, paving the way for a declining relationship between British India and Nepal. In 1801, the Company established a British Residency in Kathmandu to seek a stronger hold over the region. As 1814 approached, however, the British found themselves concerned by the possibility of an alliance between Nepal and Sikhs in northern India. The Company believed that if Nepal was expelled from its Western lands, the “Terai” region, it would no longer pose a danger. In 1814, this is what the British set out to do, alongside a goal of establishing a second Residency in Kathmandu to keep a close watch on the nation. In May 1814, British forces in Nepal temporarily left to escape malaria season. When Nepali forces aimed to reassert power, Company officials were killed in the process. In 1814, Warren Hastings – Governor General of Bengal – officially declared war on Nepal. 16,000 troops were then sent to invade Nepal in September 1814. The Treaty of Sagauli (1816) then marked the end of the Anglo-Nepalese War.
The Shah era of Nepal began with the Gorkha King Prithvi Narayan Shah invading Kathmandu Valley, which consisted of the capital of the Malla confederacy. Until then, only the Kathmandu Valley had been referred to as Nepal. The confederacy requested help from the East India Company, and an ill-equipped and ill-prepared expedition, numbering 2,500, was led by Captain Kinlock in 1767. The expedition was a disaster, and the Gorkhali army easily overpowered those who had not succumbed to malaria or desperation. The ineffectual British force provided the Gorkhali with firearms and filled the Gorkhas with confidence, which possibly caused them to underestimate their opponents in future wars.

Victory and the occupation of the Kathmandu Valley by Prithvi Narayan Shah, starting with the Battle of Kirtipur, resulted in the shift of the capital of his kingdom from Gorkha to Kathmandu, and the empire that he and his descendants built then came to be known as Nepal. Also, the invasion of the wealthy Kathmandu Valley provided the Gorkha army with economic support for furthering their martial ambitions throughout the region.

To the north, however, aggressive raids into Tibet over a long-standing dispute over trade and control of the mountain passes triggered Chinese intervention. In 1792, the Chinese Qianlong Emperor sent an army that expelled the Nepalese from Tibet to within of their capital, Kathmandu. Acting Regent Bahadur Shah (Prithvi Naryan&#x27;s younger son) appealed to the British Governor-General of India for help. Anxious to avoid a confrontation with the Chinese, the Governor-General did not send troops but sent Captain Kirkpatrick as mediator. However, before he arrived the war with China had finished.

The Tibet affair had postponed a planned attack on the Garhwal Kingdom, but by 1803, the Raja of Garhwal, Pradyuman Shah, had also been defeated. He was killed in the struggle in January 1804, and all his land was annexed. Further west, general Amar Singh Thapa overran lands as far as Kangra, Himachal Pradesh, the strongest fort in the hill region, and laid siege to it. However, Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the ruler of the Sikh state in Punjab, intervened and had driven the Nepalese army east of the Sutlej River by 1809.

==Causes==

In the years leading up to the war, the British had been expanding their sphere of influence. While the Nepalese had been expanding their empire – into Sikkim to the east, the Kumaon and the Garhwal to the west, and into Awadh to the south – the British East India Company had consolidated its position in India from its main bases of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay. This British expansion had already been resisted in India, culminating in three Anglo-Maratha wars as well as in the Punjab where Ranjit Singh and the Sikh Empire had their own aspirations.

===Territorial Conflict===
Territorial conflict represents a significant cause of the Anglo-Nepalese War. First, Nepal’s views on borders and borderlands clashed with the Company’s visions of space and territoriality. Borderlands represent “zones of contact for the management, separation, and negotiation of difference,” and leading up to 1814, conflicts over borderlands played a pivotal role in spurring conflict between Nepal and British India. Throughout its history, the Himalayas served as a site of political malleability and entangled agrarian entitlements. As such, Nepal’s boundaries remained porous. As opposed to fixed territorial lines, Nepal possessed “an unbounded space” that facilitated heterogeneous movements of trade and people. Nepal’s borders experienced frequent shifts in administration determined by the environment, tribute and taxation claims, and landholding patterns. As a result, control over Anglo-Gorkha borderlands – Nepal’s frontiers with British India – oscillated frequently among different agents. In the eighteenth century, these borderlands became an area of deep concern for the British. The British viewed borders as fixed and immutable, leading the Company to interpret Nepal’s fluid boundaries as encroachments on British territory.

Motivated by territorial concern, the Company embarked on surveys and mapmaking projects. These activities involved carving political and administrative boundaries in Nepal to render the territory “more legible for colonial rule.” These maps were then produced by the Revenue Surveys in the nineteenth century, serving as a strategy for the Company to divide land into non-overlapping, fixed spaces. Clashing ideas around borderlands and spatiality, therefore, played an instrumental role leading up to the height of territorial disputes in 1814 – the onset of the Anglo-Nepalese War.

Contents from the Treaty of Sagauli illustrate that clashes over territorial views aided in causing the war. Article 2 states, “The Raja of Nepal renounces all claim to the lands which were the subject of discussion between the two States before the war, and acknowledges the right of the Honourable Company to the sovereignty of those lands.” British forces’ focus on land and territoriality throughout the various articles of this Treaty exemplifies that territorial concern helped spur the war. Article 3 further states, “The Raja of Nepal hereby cedes to the Honourable the East India Company in perpetuity all the under-mentioned territories,” followed by the listing of five very detailed territorial spaces. When describing one of these ceded lands, for example, the Treaty states, “hills eastward of the River Mitchee including the fort and lands of Nagree and the Pass of Nagarcote leading from Morung into the hills.” These high levels of specificity, once again, showcase the Company’s highly fixed perceptions of borders and borderlands. As a result of the Anglo-Nepalese War and the subsequent treaty, Nepal lost approximately one-third of its land. Disputes over territoriality, therefore, constituted a driving cause for war, following from the Company&#x27;s deep concerns about Nepal’s fluid borders in the preceding years and decades.

The acquisition of the Nawab of Awadh&#x27;s lands by the British East India Company brought the region of Gorakhpur into the close proximity of the raja(king) of Palpa – the last remaining independent town within the Nepalese heartlands. Palpa and Butwal were originally two separate principalities; they were afterwards united under one independent Rajput prince, who, having conquered Butwal, added it to his hereditary possessions of Palpa. The lands of Butwal, though conquered and annexed, were yet held in fief, or paid an annual sum, first to Awadh, and afterwards, by transfer, to the British. During the regency of Rani Rajendra Laxmi, towards the close of the 18th century, the hill country of Palpa was conquered and annexed to Nepal. The rajah retreated to Butwal, but was subsequently induced, under false promises of redress, to visit Kathmandu, where he was put to death, and his territories in Butwal seized and occupied by the Nepalese. Bhimsen Thapa, the Nepalese prime minister from 1806 to 1837, installed his own father as governor of Palpa, leading to serious border disputes between the two powers. The occupation of Terai of Butwal from 1804 till 1812 by the Nepalese, which was under British protection, was the immediate reason which led to the Anglo-Nepalese war in 1814.

In October 1813, the ambitious the Earl of Moira, assumed the office of the Governor-General, and his first act was to re-examine the border dispute between Nepal and British East India Company. These disputes arose because there was no fixed boundary separating the Nepalese and the British. A struggle with the former was unpromising as the British were ignorant of the country or its resources and, despite their technological superiority, it was a received persuasion that the nature of the mountainous tract, which they would have to penetrate, would be as baffling to them as it had been to all the efforts of many successive Mahomedan sovereigns. A border commission imposed on Nepal by the Governor-General failed to solve the problem. The Nepalese Commissioners had remarked to the British the futility of debating about a few square miles of territory since there never could be real peace between the two States, until the British should yield to the Nepalese all the British provinces north of the Ganges, making that river the boundary between the two, &quot;as heaven had evidently designed it to be.&quot; However, Nepalese Historian Baburam Acharya contends that the British were striving to annex the hill regions of Nepal and were the ones responsible for creating border disputes. At the border demarcation, the British representative Major Bradshaw disrespected the Nepalese representatives – Rajguru Ranganath Poudyal and Kaji Dalabhanjan Pande, with a view of invoking a war against the Nepalese. In the meantime, the British found that the Nepalese were preparing for war; that they had for some time been laying up large stores of saltpetre; purchasing and fabricating arms, and organizing and disciplining their troops under some European deserters in this service, after the model of the companies of East India&#x27;s sepoy battalions. The conviction that the Nepalese raids into the flatlands of the Terai, a much prized strip of fertile ground separating the Nepalese hill country from India, increased tensions – the British felt their power in the region and their tenuous lines of communication between Calcutta and the northwest were under threat. Since there was no clear border, confrontation between the two powers was &quot;necessary and unavoidable&quot;. Britain formally declared war on Nepal on 1 November 1814.

===Economic Interests===
Economic interests also represent vital causes of the Anglo-Nepalese War. First, the British sought to utilize the trans-Himalayan trade routes through Kathmandu and eastern Nepal. These routes would create access to untapped markets for British manufactured goods in Tibet and China. In the late eighteenth century, therefore, the Company turned its attention toward trade between Tibet and British possessions in Bengal. Under the leadership of Warren Hastings, trade missions were carried out to further these trade interests with the goal of establishing commercial relations with Nepal, Bhutan, and, ultimately, Tibet. Tibet represented a source of Chinese silks, wool, dyestuffs, and other attractive commodities. The Gorkha’s conquest of Kathmandu Valley and Nepal’s push into the Terai regions during the latter half of the eighteenth century, however, was viewed by the British as a threat to the Company’s trading plans. British economic interests, therefore, played a major role in causing the Anglo-Nepalese War. The Treaty of Sagauli illustrates these economic interests, as seen by Britain ceding Nepali lands that covered these attractive trade routes.

The British had made constant efforts to persuade the Nepalese government to allow them trade access to fabled Tibet through Nepal. Despite a series of delegations headed by William Kirkpatrick (1792), Maulvi Abdul Qader (1795), and later William O. Knox (1801), the Nepalese Durbar refused to budge an inch. The resistance to open up the country to the Europeans could be summed up in a Nepalese precept, &quot;With the merchants come the musket and with the Bible comes the bayonet.&quot;

Lord Hastings was not averse to exploiting any commercial opportunities that access to the Himalayan region might offer. He knew that these would gratify his employers and silence his critics, because the East India Company was at this time in the throes of a cash-flow crisis. It needed substantial funds in Britain, in order to pay overheads, pensions, and dividends; but there were problems in remitting the necessary assets from India. Traditionally the company had bought Indian produce and sold it in London; but this no longer made economic sense. The staple Indian export was cotton goods, and demand for these was declining as home-produced textiles captured the British market. So the company was having to transfer its assets in another, more complicated and expensive way. It was having to ship its Indian textiles to Canton; sell them on the Chinese market; buy tea with the proceeds; then ship the tea for sale in Britain (all tea at this time came from China. It was not grown in India until the 1840s).

So when Hastings told the directors of the Company about an alternative means of remittance, a rare and precious raw material that could easily and profitably be shipped from India directly to London, they were at once interested. The raw material in question was a superior-quality wool: the exquisitely soft and durable animal down that had been used since time immemorial to make the famous wraps, or shawls, of Kashmir. This down was found only on the shawl-wool goat, and the shawl-wool goat was found only in certain areas of western Tibet. It refused to breed anywhere else. This explains why, under the terms of the treaty of 1816, Nepal was required to surrender its far western provinces. Hastings hoped that this territory, partly annexed by the company and partly restored to its previous rulers, would give British merchants direct access to the wool-growing areas.

Similarly David Ochterlony, then an agent at Ludhiana, on 24 August 1814 noted of Dehra Dun as a &quot;potentially thriving entrepot for Trans-Himalayan trade.&quot; He contemplated annexing Garhwal not so much with the view to revenue, but for security of commercial communications with the country where the shawl wool is produced. The British soon got to know that Kumaon provided a better facility for trade with Tibet. Therefore, the annexation of these two areas became part of their strategic objectives.

===Security Concerns===
Although the immediate cause of disputes between Nepal and the British occurred over territoriality, it is unlikely that the Company would have embarked on such an expensive and arduous war without a desire to “eliminate one of the few remaining threats to British dominance in northern India.” Therefore, the Company’s security concerns also aided in causing the war. In the early nineteenth century before the Anglo-Nepalese War, Nepal’s land stood directly north of Bengal, the heart of British administration. This posed a threat to the British. The Company feared that anti-British prejudices among the Nepalese might result in either an attack on Bengal that would strain British communication with North India, or may result in Indian states uniting into an anti-British alliance. Gorkhas’ impressive conquests of the Kathmandu Valley further supplied the British with an exaggerated view of Nepal’s strength, contributing to the British viewing Nepal as a security threat. Gorkhas’ strong resistance against British pressure since the 1760s contributed to British security concerns.

The Treaty of Sagauli showcases British security concerns. Article 6 of the treaty states, “The Raja of Nepal renounces for himself, his heirs, and successors, all claim to or connection with the countries lying to the west of the River Kali and engages never to have any concern with those countries or the inhabitants there of.” This illustrates that the British used territorial limitations as a way of curtailing their security concerns – whether it be their concern over Nepal’s relationships with Sikhs, or concerns around Nepal’s possibility of alliance with north India or Bengal.

While trade was indeed a major objective of the company, out of it grew a concept of &quot;political safety,&quot; which essentially meant a strategy of dissuasion and larger areas of occupation. The evidence does not support the claim that Hastings invaded Nepal only for commercial reasons. It was a strategic decision. He was wary of the Hindu revival and solidarity among the Marathas, the Sikhs, and the Gurkhas amid the decaying Mughal empire. He was hatching pre-emptive schemes of conquest against the Marathas in central India, and he needed to cripple Nepal first, in order to avoid having to fight on two fronts.

That it was a flawed strategy is explained by P.J. Marshal: &quot;Political safety meant military preparedness. The military expenditure for 1761–62 to 1770–71 was 44 percent of the total spending of 22 million pounds. War and diplomacy rather than trade and improvement; most of the soldiers-would-be politicians and Governor Generals rarely understood. The political safety of Bengal was their first priority and they interpreted safety as requiring the subjugation of Mysore, the Marathas, the Pindaris, the Nepalese and the Burmese.&quot;

==War preparation==
===Pre-war opinions===
When the Kathmandu Durbar solicited Nepalese chiefs&#x27; opinions about a possible war with the British, Amar Singh Thapa was not alone in his opposition, declaring that – &quot;They will not rest satisfied without establishing their own power and authority, and will unite with the hill rajas, whom we have dispossessed. We have hitherto but hunted deer; if we engage in this war, we must prepare to fight tigers.&quot; He was against the measures adopted in Butwal and Sheeoraj, which he declared to have originated in the selfish views of persons, who scrupled not to involve the nation in war to gratify their personal avarice.

This contrasts sharply with the prime minister of Nepal, Bhimsen Thapa – &quot; ... our hills and fastness are formed by the hand of God, and are impregnable.&quot; This stance by Bhimsen Thapa is not surprising, as insinuated by Amar Singh, considering Bhimsen Thapa had made the usurpations in Butwal and Sheoraj, and whose family derived most of the advantages. Prinsep estimates that the revenue of the usurped lands could not have been less than a lakh of rupees a year to the Nepalese, in the manner they collected it: the retention of this income was therefore an object of no small importance to the ambitious views of Bhimsen Thapa and the preservation of the influence he had contrived to establish for his family. The Nepalese prime minister realized the Nepalese had several advantages over the British including knowledge of the region and recent experience fighting in the mountainous terrain. However, the British had numerical superiority and far more modern weapons.

In the meantime, the Governor-General also naively believed that &quot;the difficulties of mountain warfare were greater on the defensive side than on that of a well conducted offensive operation.&quot; Soldiers like Rollo Gillespie saw the Nepalese as a challenge to British supremacy — &quot;Opinion is everything in such a country as India: and whenever the natives shall begin to lose their reverence for the English arms, our superiority in other respects will quickly sink into contempt.&quot;

===Finance===
The Governor-General looked towards the Nawab of Awadh to finance the impending warfare with Nepal: two crore (20 million) rupees were solicited. Of this matter he writes:

In the aftermath of the war, he writes:
This was in contrast with the Nepalese who had spent huge amount of resources on the first and second wars against the Tibetans, which had led to the gradual exhaustion of their treasury.

===Terrain===

To the British, who were used to fighting in the plains, but were unacquainted with the terrain of the hills, the formidability of the topology is expressed by one anonymous British soldier as such:
==First campaign==
===British plan of operation===

The initial British campaign was an attack on two fronts across a frontier of more than , from the Sutlej to the Koshi. In the eastern front, Major-General Bennet Marley and Major-General John Sullivan Wood led their respective columns across the Tarai towards the heart of the valley of Kathmandu. Major-General Rollo Gillespie and Colonel David Ochterlony commanded columns in the western front. These columns were faced with the Nepalese army under the command of Amar Singh Thapa. About the beginning of October 1814, the British troops began to move towards different depots; and the army was soon after formed into four divisions, one at Benares, one at Meeruth, one at Dinapur, and one at Ludhiana.

&quot;The first division&quot;, at Dinapur, being the largest, was commanded by Major-General Marley, and was intended to seize the pass at Makwanpur, between Gunduk and Bagmati, the key to Nepal, and to push forward to Kathmandu: thus at once carrying the war into the heart of the enemy&#x27;s country. This force consisted of 8,000 men, including his Majesty&#x27;s 24th foot of 907 strong; there was a train attached to it of four 18-pounders, eight 6- and 3-pounders, and fourteen mortars and howitzers.

&quot;The second division&quot;, at Benares, under command of Major-General Wood, having subsequently removed to Gorakhpur, was meant to enter the hills by the Bhootnuill pass, and, turning to the eastward, to penetrate the hilly districts, towards Kathmandu, and cooperate with the first division, while its success would have divided the enemy&#x27;s country and force into two parts, cutting off all the troops in Kumaon and Garhwal from communication with the capital. Its force consisted of his Majesty&#x27;s 17th foot, 950 strong, and about 3000 infantry, totaling 4,494 men; it had a train of seven 6- and 3-pounders, and four mortars and howitzers.

&quot;The third division&quot;, was formed at Meerut, under Major-General Gillespie; and it was purposed to march directly to the Dehra Dun; and having reduced the forts in that valley, to move, as might be deemed expedient, to the eastward, to recover Srinagar from the troops of Amar Singh Thapa; or to the westward, to gain the post of Nahan, the chief town of Sirmaur, where Ranjore Singh Thapa held the government for his father, Amar Singh; and so sweep on towards the Sutlej, in order to cut off that chief from the rest, and thus to reduce him to terms. This division originally consisted of his Majesty&#x27;s 53d, which with artillery and a few dismounted dragoons, made up about one thousand Europeans, and two thousand five hundred native infantry, totaling 3,513 men.

&quot;The fourth, or north-western division&quot;, at Ludhiana, was to operate in the hilly country lying near the Sutlej: it assembled under Brigadier-General Ochterlony, and was destined to advance against the strong and extensive cluster of posts held by Amar Singh and the troops under his immediate orders at and surrounding arki, a considerable town of Kahlur, and to cooperate with the forces under Major-General Gillespie, moving downwards among the hills, when these positions should be forced, surrounding Amar Singh, and driving him upon that army. The force consisted exclusively of native infantry and artillery, and amounted to 5,993 men; it had a train of two 18-pounder, ten 6-pounders, and four mortars and howitzers.

Lastly, beyond the Koshi River eastward, Major Latter was furnished with two thousand men, including his district battalion, for the defence of the Poornea frontier. This officer was desired to open a communication with the Raja of Sikkim, and to give him every assistance and encouragement to expel the Gorkhas from the eastern hills, short of an actual advance of troops for the purpose. Captain Barré Latter was sent to the border with Poornea and after a successful mission to confine the Gorkhas to their own territory concluded the Anglo-Sikkimese Treaty of Titalia confirming the Raja&#x27;s dominions, although the latter lost territory from his border to the Tamur River.

The Commander-in-Chief of the British forces was Lord Moira. All four divisions composed mostly of Indian Sepoys. Ochterlony&#x27;s army was the only division without a single British battalion. In conclusion, the Gorkhali Army defeated the British on three fronts consisting the middle and the east whereas lost the remaining two fronts in the west.

===Battle of Makwanpur Gadhi===

Major General Marley was tasked to occupy Hetauda and capture the fortresses of Hariharpur and Makawanpur before proceeding to Kathmandu. His frontage of advance lay between Rapati river and Bagmati river. After additional reinforcements, he had 12,000 troops for his offensive against the Makawanpur and Hariharpur axis. A big attack base was established but Major General Marley showed reluctance to take risks against the Nepalese. Some skirmishes had already started taking place. Similarly, Major General George Wood, sometimes known as the Tiger of the British Indian Army, proved exceedingly cautious against the hard charging Nepalese.

Colonel Ranabir Singh Thapa, brother of Bhimsen Thapa, was to be the Sector Commander of Makawanpur-Hariharpur axis. He was given a very large fortress and about 4,000 troops with old rifles and a few pieces of cannons. But the British could not move forward from the border. Colonel Ranabir Singh Thapa had been trying to lure the enemies to his selected killing area. But Major General Wood would not venture forward from Bara Gadhi and he eventually fell back to Betiya.

===Battle of Jitgadh===

With the help of an ousted Palpali king, Major General Wood planned to march on Siuraj, Jit Gadhi and Nuwakot with a view to bypass the Butwal defenses, flushing out minor opposition on the axis, and assault Palpa from a less guarded flank. Nepalese Colonel Ujir Singh Thapa had deployed his 1200 troops in many defensive positions including Jit Gadhi, Nuwakot Gadhi and Kathe Gadhi. The troops under Colonel Ujir were very disciplined and he himself was a dedicated and able commander. He was famous for exploiting advantage in men, material, natural resources and well versed in mountain tactics. The British advance took place on 6 January 1814, to Jit Gadh. While they were advancing to this fortress, crossing the Tinau River, the Nepalese troops opened fire from the fortress. Another of the attackers&#x27; columns was advancing to capture Tansen Bazar. Here too, Nepalese spoiling attacks forced the General to fall back to Gorakhpur. About 70 Nepalese lost their lives in Nuwakot pakhe Gadhi. Meanwhile, more than 300 of the enemy perished.

===Battle of Hariharpur Gadhi===
No special military action had taken place in Hariharpur Gadhi fortress in the first campaign. Major General Bannet Marley and Major General George Wood had not been able to advance for an offensive against Makawanpur and Hariharpur Gadhi fortresses.

===Battle of Nalapani===

The Battle of Nalapani was the first battle of the Anglo-Nepalese War. The battle took place around the Nalapani fort, near Dehradun, which was placed under siege by the British between 31 October and 30 November 1814. The fort&#x27;s garrison was commanded by Captain Balbhadra Kunwar, while Major-General Rollo Gillespie, who had previously fought at the Battle of Java, was in charge of the attacking British troops. Gillespie was killed on the first day of the siege while rallying his men and despite considerable odds, both in terms of numbers and firepower, Balbhadra and his 600-strong garrison, which also consisted of brave women who reportedly shielded the bullets and cannonballs with their bodies, successfully held out against more than 5,000 British troops for over a month.
Fraser recorded the situation in the following terms:
After two costly and unsuccessful attempts to seize the fort by direct attack, the British changed their approach and sought to force the garrison to surrender by cutting off the fort&#x27;s external water supply. Having suffered three days of thirst, on the last day of the siege, Balbhadra, refusing to surrender, led the 70 surviving members of the garrison in a charge against the besieging force. Fighting their way out of the fort, the survivors escaped into the nearby hills. The battle set the tone for the rest of the Anglo-Nepalese War, and a number of later engagements, including one at Jaithak, unfolded in a similar way.

The experience at Nalapani so discomforted the British that Lord Hastings so far varied his plan of operations as to forego the detachment of a part of this division to occupy Gurhwal. He accordingly instructed Colonel Mawbey to leave a few men in a strong position for the occupation of the Doon and to carry his undivided army against Amar Singh&#x27;s son, Colonel Ranajor Singh Thapa, who was with about 2300 elite of the Gurkha army, at Nahan. It was further intended to reinforce the division considerably; and the command was handed over to Major-General Martindell. In the meantime Colonel Mawbey had led back the division through the Keree pass, leaving Colonel Carpenter posted at Kalsee, at the north western extremity of the Doon. This station commanded the passes of the Jumna on the main line of communication between the western and eastern portions of the Gurkha territory, and thus was well chosen for procuring intelligence.

===Battle of Jaithak===
Major General Martindale now joined the force and took over command. He occupied the town of Nahan on 27 December, and started his attack on the fort of Jaithak. The fort had a garrison of 2000 men under the command of Ranajor Singh Thapa, the son of the Amar Singh Thapa. The first assault ended in disaster, with the Nepalese successfully warding off the British offensive. The second managed to cut off the water supply to the fort, but could not capture it mainly because of the exhausted state of the troops and shortage of ammunition. Martindale lost heart and ordered a withdrawal. Jaithak was eventually captured much later in the war, when Ochterlony had taken over the command.

A single day of battle at Jaithak cost the British over three hundred men dead and wounded and cooled Martindell&#x27;s ardour for battle. For over a month and a half, he refused to take any further initiative against the Nepalese army. Thus by mid-February, of the four British commanders the Nepalese army had faced till that time, Gillespie was dead, Marley had deserted, Wood was harassed into inactivity, and Martindell was practically incapacitated by over-cautiousness. It set the scene for Octorloney to soon show his mettle and change the course of the war.

===Trying times for Nepalese troops===
Out West, the Nepalese were hopelessly overextended. Kumaun, a key link in Nepalese army communications with the Far West, was defended by a small force, numbering about seven hundred and fifty men, with an equal number of Kumaoni irregulars, altogether about fifteen hundred men to defend a whole province. In addition, Doti which was to the East of Kumaun, had been practically stripped of troops. Bam Shah, as governor of Kumaun, had final responsibility for the defence of the province.

The British force, numbering initially over forty five hundred men, was easily able to outmanoeuvre the Nepalese army defenders and force them to abandon one post after another. Despite a significant victory over Captain Hearsey&#x27;s force, which had been sent on a flanking movement though Eastern Kumaun, and the capture of the captain himself, the Nepalese army were unable to stem the tide of the British advance. Hasti Dal Shah arrived in Almora with a small body of reinforcement troops. A further reinforcement of four companies was sent from Kathmandu to aid the beleaguered defences of Kumaun, but the difficulties of communication through the hills prevented them from arriving in time to be of any help.

Meanwhile, Hastings sent Colonel Nicolls, Quartermaster-General for the British troops in India, to take charge of the Almora campaign and assigned two thousand regular troops to this front in addition to the very large number of irregulars already assigned to the area – all of this against fewer than one thousand Nepalese army soldiers.

Hasti Dal Shah and some five hundred Nepalese Army men had set out from Almora to secure Almora&#x27;s Northern line of communications with Kathmandu. This party was intercepted. Hasti Dal Shah, the ablest Nepalese commander in this sector, was killed in the first moments of the battle. The Nepalese suffered terrible losses. When word of this disaster reached the defenders at Almora, they were stunned. The British closed in on Almora and the Nepalese was unable to prevent the British advance. On 25 April 1815, 2,000 British regulars under Col. Nicholls and a force of irregular troops under Col. Gardiner assaulted and captured the heights of the town of Almorah. Subsequently, the British managed to establish gun positions within seventy yards of the gate of the fort at Almora and the British artillery demolished the walls of the fort at point blank range. Bam Shah surrendered Almora on 27 April 1815. The result of this British victory was the capitulation of the province of Kumaon and all of its fortresses.

===Second Battle of Malaon and Jaithak===
The second battle of Malaon and Jaithak cut the Nepalese lines of communication between Central Nepal and the Far West. It also sealed the fate of Kazi Amar Singh Thapa at Malaon and Ranajor Singh Thapa at Jaithak. At Malaon, Major-General Ochterlony had moved with extreme care summoning reinforcements and heavy guns from Delhi until his total attack force consisted of over ten thousand men well-equipped with heavy cannon.

Kazi Amar Singh Thapa&#x27;s position in the Malaon Hills depended on Bilaspur in the lowlands for his food supplies, and the nature of the hills forced him to spread his forces very thinly in an attempt to defend every vantage point. Ochterlony cut off the supply of food from Bilaspur and then turned his attention to the intricate network of defensive posts that were designed to withstand any frontal assault. Although rear fortifications supported these posts, none could withstand a long cannonade by heavy guns. Because Ochterlony had sufficient troops to attack and overwhelm several positions simultaneously, the thinly spread Nepalese defences could be dangerously divided.

Ochterlony chose his target, a point on the ridge, and then proceeded to move slowly, consolidating each position that he took, and allowing the pioneers time to build roads so that the heavy guns could be moved forward to support each attack. After a series of carefully planned and executed moves, he succeeded in establishing a position on the crest of Deothal, not even over a thousand yards from Kazi Amar Singh Thapa&#x27;s main fort at Malaon. The old warrior Bhakti Thapa valiantly led assault after assault on this position, but he died during battle and the position did not fall. Immensely impressed by Bhakti&#x27;s sustained courage against impossible odds, the British made the well appreciated and honourable gesture of returning his body with full military honours. The British superiority in numbers made it inevitable that they would be able to establish themselves and their heavy guns on a vantage point within range of Ranajor Singh&#x27;s fortifications, sooner or later.

Both Kazi Amar Singh Thapa and Ranajor Singh Thapa were thus hemmed in and looking down the barrels of the British guns when Bam Shah&#x27;s letter arrived, announcing the fall of Almora. Although the old commander was still reluctant to surrender, Kazi Amar Singh Thapa at last saw the hopelessness of the situation and, compelled by circumstances and the British guns, surrendered with honour for both himself and Ranajor Singh. The Nepalese positions in the Far West lost control to the British on 15 May 1815.

==Second campaign==
The outstretched Nepalese army was defeated on the Western front i.e. Garhwal and Kumaon area. Ochterlony had finally outfoxed Bada Kaji Amar Singh Thapa. He was the only successful British Commander in the first Nepal-Company campaign. Not surprisingly Lord Moira appointed him as the Main Operational Commander in the second offensive on the Bharatpur-Makawanpur-Hariharpur front with 17,000 strong invasion force, but again, most of them were Indian sepoys.

The British had given a 15-day ultimatum to Nepal to ratify a treaty on 28 November. But the points of the treaty were very difficult for the Nepalese to ratify quickly. The delay provided the excuse for the British to commence the second military campaign against the kingdom. Colonel Bhaktawar Singh Thapa, another brother of Bhimsen Thapa, had been appointed as Sector Commander for defensive battles for the area from Bijayapur to Sindhuli Gadhi in the first campaign. In this second campaign, Bada Kaji Amarsingh Thapawas detailed as Sector Commander for Sindhuli Gadhi and the eastern front. Colonel Bhaktawar Singh Thapa was manning his headquarters at Makwanpur Gadhi. Major General David Ochterlony, was the overall commander against Nepal with a massive 17,000 British troops to assault the fronts including Upardang Gadhi, Sinchyang Gadhi, Kandrang Gadhi, Makawanpur Gadhi and Hariharpur Gadhi.

During the campaign in February 1816, Ochterlony decided to take a very infrequently used pass through the mountains. The failure there would have been a disaster for British. But the successful passage would allow British to directly emerge and attack the Nepalese&#x27;s rear. Colonel Kelly and Colonel O’Hollorah followed the river Bagmati to reach Hariharpur Gadhi. Some of the heads of villagers were bribed for sensitive information about the defensive positions in the area of Hariharpur Gadhi. The information seriously compromised the Nepalese defences. Secret routes would have given the enemy advantage even if they were able to get only a battalion through. But the British were able to advance with more than a brigade&#x27;s strength. Colonel Kelly and Colonel O’Hollorah launched their attack from two different directions on 29 February. The Nepalese troops were eventually driven back from Hariharpur Gadhi after a big battle. Kaji Ranjore Singh Thapa withdrew to Sindhuli Gadhi to link up with Bada Kaji Amar Singh Thapa. The British troops did not approach Sindhuli Gadhi and fell back to Makawanpur by the end of March 1816.

The situation became very critical for Nepal and the British which eventually led to a treaty. Major General David Ochterlony settled down to receive the treaty, signed by Kathmandu Durbar through Chandra Sekhar Upadhyaya, Pandit Gajaraj Mishra and finally though Bhaktawar Singh Thapa. Two days later the ratified treaty was handed over to the British in Makawanpur. The war ended with the Treaty of Sugauli, which has been considered as an unequal treaty which led to Nepal losing its one-third territory. The river Mechi became the new Eastern border and the Mahakali the Western boundary of Nepal.

==Aftermath==
===The Treaty of Sugauli===


The Treaty of Sugauli was ratified on 4 March 1816. As per the treaty, Nepal lost all Sikkim (including Darjeeling), the territories of Kumaon and Garhwal and Western Terai. The Mechi River became the new eastern border and the Mahakali river the western boundary of the kingdom. The British East India Company would pay 200,000 rupees annually to compensate for the loss of income from the Terai region. The British set up Resident. The fear of having a British Resident in Kathmandu ultimately proved to be unfounded, as the rulers of Nepal managed to isolate the Resident to such an extent as to be in virtual house arrest.

The Terai lands, however, proved difficult for the British to govern and some of them were returned to the kingdom later in 1816 and the annual payments accordingly abolished. However even after the conclusion of the Anglo-Nepalese War, the border issue between the two states was not yet settled. The boundary between Nepal and Oudh was not finally adjusted until 1830; and that between Nepal and the British territories remained as a matter of discussion between the two Governments for several years later.

The British never had the intention to destroy either the existence or the independence of a state which was usefully interposed between them and the dependencies of China. Lord Hastings had given up his plan to dismember Nepal from fear of antagonising China – whose vassal Nepal in theory was. In 1815, while British forces were campaigning in far western Nepal, a high-ranking Manchu official advanced with a large
military force from China to Lhasa; and the following year, after the Anglo-Nepalese treaty had been signed, the Chinese army moved south again, right up to Nepal&#x27;s frontier. The Nepalese panicked, because memories were still vivid of the Chinese invasion of 1792, and there was a flurry of urgent diplomatic activity. Hastings sent mollifying assurances to the imperial authorities, and ordered the British Resident, newly arrived in Kathmandu, to pack his bags and be ready to leave at once if the Chinese invaded again.

===Cost of war===
Despite the boast of Lord Moira to the British parliament on having increased the state coffers, the Gurkha War had in reality cost more than the combined cost of the campaigns against the Marathas and the Pindaris for which Lord Moira&#x27;s administration is better known: Sicca Rs. as against Sicca Rs. . This was the kind of fact which greatly influenced the policy of the Company government in subsequent years. Thus, while the Company Government, in theory, thoroughly approved of the development of trade, especially in shawl wool, between Western Tibet and its territories, it was unprepared to take any decisive step to bring this about. It preferred to leave the Chinese in Tibet to their own devices, and hoped to avoid the risk, however slight, of another expensive hill war.

Furthermore, despite the British merchants&#x27; direct access to the wool growing areas after the war, the hopes of shawl wool trade were never realised. The British merchants found that they were too late. The shawl wool market was strictly closed and closely guarded. It was monopolised by traders from Kashmir and Ladakh, and the only outsider with whom they dealt was Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the powerful Sikh ruler of Lahore. Ranjit was very zealous of his privilege, and he was the last person the British could afford to offend at this time of crisis and uncertainty. So the East India Company never did get its shawl wool. When it finally acquired the Punjab and Kashmir, after the Sikh Wars of the 1840s, it had long since given up trade, and Kashmir was so little valued that it was quickly discarded – sold for a knock-down price to the Raja of Jammu.

===Gorkha recruitment===


David Ochterlony and the political agent William Fraser were quick to recognize the potential of Nepalese soldiers in British service. During the war the British were keen to use defectors from the Nepalese army and employ them as irregular forces. His confidence in their loyalty was such that in April 1815 he proposed forming them into a battalion under Lieutenant Ross called the Nasiri regiment. This regiment, which later became the 1st King George&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles, saw action at the Malaun fort under the leadership of Lieutenant Lawtie, who reported to Ochterlony that he &quot;had the greatest reason to be satisfied with their exertions&quot;.

As well as Ochterlony&#x27;s Gorkhali battalions, William Fraser and Lieutenant Frederick Young raised the Sirmoor battalion, later to become the 2nd King Edward VII&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles; an additional battalion, the Kumaon battalion was also raised eventually becoming the 3rd Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles. None of these men fought in the second campaign.

===Fate of protagonists===
====Bhimsen Thapa====
Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, with the support of the queen regent Tripura Sundari, remained in power despite the defeat of Nepal. Other ruling families, particularly the Pandes, decried what they saw as Bhimsen Thapa&#x27;s submissive attitude towards the British. The prime minister however had been able to retain power by maintaining a large, modernized army and politically dominating the court during the minority of King Rajendra Bikram Shah, (reigned 1816–1847). Additionally, he was able to freeze out the Pandes from power by appointing members of his own family into positions of authority.

When queen Tripura Sundari died in 1832, Bhimsen Thapa began to lose influence. In 1833, Brian Hodgson became British resident, openly favouring Bhimsen Thapa&#x27;s opponents, and in 1837 the king announced his intention to rule independently, depriving the prime minister and his nephew of their military powers. After the eldest son of the queen died, Bhimsen Thapa was falsely accused of attempting to poison the prince. Although acquitted, the Thapas were in turmoil. When the head of the Pande family, Rana Jang Pande, became prime minister, he had Bhimsen Thapa re-imprisoned; Bhimsen Thapa committed suicide in August 1839.

====David Ochterlony====
For his part, David Ochterlony received thanks from both Houses of Parliament and became the first officer in the British East India Company to be awarded the GCB. Lord Moira also reinstated him as Resident at Delhi and he lived in the style appropriate to a very senior figure of the company. However, after Lord Moira left India – succeeded by Lord Amherst as Governor-General in 1823 – Ochterlony fell out of favor.

In 1825 the Raja of Bharatpur died and the six-year-old heir to the throne, whom Ochterlony supported, was usurped by his cousin Durjan Sal. When Durjan Sal failed to submit to Ochterlony&#x27;s demands to vacate the throne, the British general prepared to march on Bharatpur. He did not receive the backing of the new Governor-General however, and after Amherst countermanded his orders, Ochterlony resigned, as Amherst had anticipated. This episode badly affected the ailing general who died shortly after on 14 July 1825. A 165-foot-high memorial was later erected in Calcutta in his memory; however, Sir David Ochterlony&#x27;s greatest legacy is the continuing recruitment of Gorkhas into the British and Indian armies.

Soon after Ochterlony&#x27;s resignation Amherst was himself obliged to do what Ochterlony had prepared to do, and laid siege to Bharatpur.

<text>The Butterworth filter is a type of signal processing filter designed to have a frequency response that is as flat as possible in the passband. It is also referred to as a maximally flat magnitude filter. It was first described in 1930 by the British engineer and physicist Stephen Butterworth in his paper entitled &quot;On the Theory of Filter Amplifiers&quot;.

==Original paper==
Butterworth had a reputation for solving very complex mathematical problems thought to be &#x27;impossible&#x27;. At the time, filter design required a considerable amount of designer experience due to limitations of the theory then in use. The filter was not in common use for over 30 years after its publication. Butterworth stated that: 

Such an ideal filter cannot be achieved, but Butterworth showed that successively closer approximations were obtained with increasing numbers of filter elements of the right values. At the time, filters generated substantial ripple in the passband, and the choice of component values was highly interactive. Butterworth showed that a low-pass filter could be designed whose gain as a function of frequency (i.e., the magnitude of its frequency response) is:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the angular frequency in radians per second and formula_3 is the number of poles in the filter—equal to the number of reactive elements in a passive filter. Its cutoff frequency (the half-power point of approximately −3 dB or a voltage gain of 1/ ≈ 0.7071) is normalized to 𝜔 = 1 radian per second. Butterworth only dealt with filters with an even number of poles in his paper, though odd-order filters can be created with the addition of a single-pole filter applied to the output of the even-order filter. He built his higher-order filters from 2-pole filters separated by vacuum tube amplifiers. His plot of the frequency response of 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-pole filters is shown as A, B, C, D, and E in his original graph.

Butterworth solved the equations for two-pole and four-pole filters, showing how the latter could be cascaded when separated by vacuum tube amplifiers and so enabling the construction of higher-order filters despite inductor losses. In 1930, low-loss core materials such as molypermalloy had not been discovered and air-cored audio inductors were rather lossy. Butterworth discovered that it was possible to adjust the component values of the filter to compensate for the winding resistance of the inductors.

He used coil forms of 1.25″ diameter and 3″ length with plug-in terminals. Associated capacitors and resistors were contained inside the wound coil form. The coil formed part of the plate load resistor. Two poles were used per vacuum tube and RC coupling was used to the grid of the following tube.

Butterworth also showed that the basic low-pass filter could be modified to give low-pass, high-pass, band-pass and band-stop functionality.

==Overview==

The frequency response of the Butterworth filter is maximally flat (i.e., has no ripples) in the passband and rolls off towards zero in the stopband. When viewed on a logarithmic Bode plot, the response slopes off linearly towards negative infinity. A first-order filter&#x27;s response rolls off at −6 dB per octave (−20 dB per decade) (all first-order lowpass filters have the same normalized frequency response). A second-order filter decreases at −12 dB per octave, a third-order at −18 dB and so on. Butterworth filters have a monotonically changing magnitude function with formula_2, unlike other filter types that have non-monotonic ripple in the passband and/or the stopband.

Compared with a Chebyshev Type I/Type II filter or an elliptic filter, the Butterworth filter has a slower roll-off, and thus will require a higher order to implement a particular stopband specification, but Butterworth filters have a more linear phase response in the passband than Chebyshev Type I/Type II and elliptic filters can achieve.

==Example==

A transfer function of a third-order low-pass Butterworth filter design shown in the figure on the right looks like this:

:formula_5

A simple example of a Butterworth filter is the third-order low-pass design shown in the figure on the right, with formula_6 = 4/3 F, formula_7 = 1 Ω, formula_8 = 3/2 H, and formula_9 = 1/2 H. Taking the impedance of the capacitors formula_10 to be formula_11 and the impedance of the inductors formula_12 to be formula_13, where is the complex frequency, the circuit equations yield the transfer function for this device:
:formula_14

The magnitude of the frequency response (gain) formula_15 is given by
:formula_16

obtained from
:formula_17

and the phase is given by

:formula_18

The group delay is defined as the negative derivative of the phase shift with respect to angular frequency and is a measure of the distortion in the signal introduced by phase differences for different frequencies. The gain and the delay for this filter are plotted in the graph on the left. There are no ripples in the gain curve in either the passband or the stopband.

The log of the absolute value of the transfer function formula_19 is plotted in complex frequency space in the second graph on the right. The function is defined by the three poles in the left half of the complex frequency plane.

These are arranged on a circle of radius unity, symmetrical about the real formula_20 axis. The gain function will have three more poles on the right half-plane to complete the circle.

By replacing each inductor with a capacitor and each capacitor with an inductor, a high-pass Butterworth filter is obtained.

A band-pass Butterworth filter is obtained by placing a capacitor in series with each inductor and an inductor in parallel with each capacitor to form resonant circuits. The value of each new component must be selected to resonate with the old component at the frequency of interest.

A band-stop Butterworth filter is obtained by placing a capacitor in parallel with each inductor and an inductor in series with each capacitor to form resonant circuits. The value of each new component must be selected to resonate with the old component at the frequency that is to be rejected.

==Transfer function==

Like all filters, the typical prototype is the low-pass filter, which can be modified into a high-pass filter, or placed in series with others to form band-pass and band-stop filters, and higher order versions of these.

The gain formula_15 of an formula_3th-order Butterworth low-pass filter is given in terms of the transfer function formula_19 as
:formula_24

where formula_3 is the order of filter, formula_26 is the cutoff frequency (approximately the −3 dB frequency), and formula_27 is the DC gain (gain at zero frequency).

It can be seen that as formula_3 approaches infinity, the gain becomes a rectangle function and frequencies below formula_26 will be passed with gain formula_27, while frequencies above formula_26 will be suppressed. For smaller values of formula_3, the cutoff will be less sharp.

We wish to determine the transfer function formula_19 where formula_34 (from Laplace transform). Because formula_35 and, as a general property of Laplace transforms at formula_36, formula_37, if we select formula_19 such that:

:formula_39

and hence

:formula_40

The transfer (or system) function may be written in terms of these poles as

:formula_41.

where formula_42 is the product of a sequence operator. The denominator is a Butterworth polynomial in formula_20.

===Normalized Butterworth polynomials===

The Butterworth polynomials may be written in complex form as above, but are usually written with real coefficients by multiplying pole pairs that are complex conjugates, such as formula_44 and formula_45. The polynomials are normalized by setting formula_46. The normalized Butterworth polynomials then have the general product form

:formula_47
:formula_48

Factors of Butterworth polynomials of order 1 through 10 are shown in the following table (to six decimal places).

Factors of Butterworth polynomials of order 1 through 6 are shown in the following table (Exact).

where the Greek letter phi ( or formula_49) represents the golden ratio. It is an irrational number that is a solution to the quadratic equation formula_50 with a value of

The formula_3th Butterworth polynomial can also be written as a sum

:formula_52

with its coefficients formula_53 given by the recursion formula

:formula_54

and by the product formula

:formula_55

where

:formula_56

Further, formula_57. The rounded coefficients formula_53 for the first 10 Butterworth polynomials formula_59 are:

The normalized Butterworth polynomials can be used to determine the transfer function for any low-pass filter cut-off frequency formula_26, as follows

:formula_61 , where formula_62

Transformation to other bandforms are also possible, see prototype filter.

===Maximal flatness===

Assuming formula_46 and formula_64, the derivative of the gain with respect to frequency can be shown to be

:formula_65

which is monotonically decreasing for all formula_2 since the gain formula_67 is always positive. The gain function of the Butterworth filter therefore has no ripple. The series expansion of the gain is given by

:formula_68

In other words, all derivatives of the gain up to but not including the 2formula_3-th derivative are zero at formula_70, resulting in &quot;maximal flatness&quot;. If the requirement to be monotonic is limited to the passband only and ripples are allowed in the stopband, then it is possible to design a filter of the same order, such as the inverse Chebyshev filter, that is flatter in the passband than the &quot;maximally flat&quot; Butterworth.

===High-frequency roll-off===

Again assuming formula_46, the slope of the log of the gain for large formula_2 is

:formula_73

In decibels, the high-frequency roll-off is therefore 20formula_3 dB/decade, or 6formula_3 dB/octave (the factor of 20 is used because the power is proportional to the square of the voltage gain; see 20 log rule.)

=== Minimum order ===
To design a Butterworth filter using the minimum required number of elements, the minimum order of the Butterworth filter may be calculated as follows.

:formula_76

where:

:formula_77 and formula_78 are the pass band frequency and attenuation at that frequency in dB.

:formula_79 and formula_80 are the stop band frequency and attenuation at that frequency in dB.

:formula_3 is the minimum number of poles, the order of the filter.

:formula_82 denotes the ceiling function.

=== Nonstandard cutoff attenuation ===
The cutoff attenuation for Butterworth filters is usually defined to be −3.01 dB. If it is desired to use a different attenuation at the cutoff frequency, then the following factor may be applied to each pole, whereupon the poles will continue to lie on a circle, but the radius will no longer be unity. The cutoff attenuation equation may be derived through algebraic manipulation of the Butterworth defining equation stated at the top of the page.

:formula_83

where:

:formula_84 is the relocated pole positioned to set the desired cutoff attenuation.

:formula_85 is a −3.01 dB cutoff pole that lies on the unit circle.

:formula_86 is the desired attenuation at the cutoff frequency in dB (1 dB, 10 dB, etc.).

:formula_3 is the number of poles, the order of the filter.

==Filter implementation and design==

There are several different filter topologies available to implement a linear analogue filter. The most often used topology for a passive realisation is the Cauer topology, and the most often used topology for an active realisation is the Sallen–Key topology.

===Cauer topology===

The Cauer topology uses passive components (shunt capacitors and series inductors) to implement a linear analog filter. The Butterworth filter having a given transfer function can be realised using a Cauer 1-form. The &quot;k&quot;-th element is given by

:formula_88

:formula_89

The filter may start with a series inductor if desired, in which case the &quot;Lk&quot; are &quot;k&quot; odd and the &quot;Ck&quot; are &quot;k&quot; even. These formulae may usefully be combined by making both &quot;Lk&quot; and &quot;Ck&quot; equal to &quot;gk&quot;. That is, &quot;gk&quot; is the immittance divided by &quot;s&quot;.

:formula_90

These formulae apply to a doubly terminated filter (that is, the source and load impedance are both equal to unity) with ωc = 1. This prototype filter can be scaled for other values of impedance and frequency. For a singly terminated filter (that is, one driven by an ideal voltage or current source) the element values are given by

:formula_91

where

:formula_92

and

:formula_93
:formula_94

Voltage driven filters must start with a series element and current driven filters must start with a shunt element. These forms are useful in the design of diplexers and multiplexers.

===Sallen–Key topology===

The Sallen–Key topology uses active and passive components (noninverting buffers, usually op amps, resistors, and capacitors) to implement a linear analog filter. Each Sallen–Key stage implements a conjugate pair of poles; the overall filter is implemented by cascading all stages in series. If there is a real pole (in the case where formula_3 is odd), this must be implemented separately, usually as an RC circuit, and cascaded with the active stages.

For the second-order Sallen–Key circuit shown to the right the transfer function is given by

:formula_96

We wish the denominator to be one of the quadratic terms in a Butterworth polynomial. Assuming that formula_97, this will mean that

:formula_98

and

:formula_99

This leaves two undefined component values that may be chosen at will.

Butterworth lowpass filters with Sallen–Key topology of third and fourth order, using only one op amp, are described by Huelsman, and further single-amplifier Butterworth filters also of higher order are given by Jurišić et al.

===Digital implementation===

Digital implementations of Butterworth and other filters are often based on the bilinear transform method or the matched Z-transform method, two different methods to discretize an analog filter design. In the case of all-pole filters such as the Butterworth, the matched Z-transform method is equivalent to the impulse invariance method. For higher orders, digital filters are sensitive to quantization errors, so they are often calculated as cascaded biquad sections, plus one first-order or third-order section for odd orders.

==Comparison with other linear filters==

Properties of the Butterworth filter are:
* Monotonic amplitude response in both passband and stopband
* Quick roll-off around the cutoff frequency, which improves with increasing order
* Considerable overshoot and ringing in step response, which worsens with increasing order
* Slightly non-linear phase response
* Group delay largely frequency-dependent

Here is an image showing the gain of a discrete-time Butterworth filter next to other common filter types. All of these filters are fifth-order.

The Butterworth filter rolls off more slowly around the cutoff frequency than the Chebyshev filter or the Elliptic filter, but without ripple.

<text>Ioannis &quot;Yiannis&quot; Latsis (; 14 September 1910 – 17 April 2003), also known as John Spyridon Latsis, was a Greek shipping multi-billionaire business magnate notable for his great wealth, influential friends, and charitable activities.

The year of his death (2003), &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked Yiannis Latsis number 101 on its list of the world&#x27;s richest people, with a fortune estimated at $6.4 billion.

== Biography ==
Latsis was born in Katakolo, a fishing village in the Elis. His family was from the Greek community in Albania. He was the sixth of nine children, the son of Spiro Latsis and Aphrodite Efthimiou. He was educated at the Pyrgos School of Commerce and the .

He started as a deckhand, eventually working his way up to ship&#x27;s captain in the merchant marine. After the Second World War, Latsis expanded his activities into coastal shipping with the purchase of used passenger vessels. The most renowned of these vessels was the &quot;Neraida&quot; (ex-&quot;Laurana&quot;), an Italian-built passenger ship that was routed in the coastal line of the Argo-Saronic Gulf from 1950 to 1974. Today, she is a floating museum dedicated to her owner&#x27;s business history.

He bought his first cargo vessel in 1938 and by the 1960s, owned a fleet of ships. In 1955, Latsis purchased a cargo vessel, the Marianna. Three years later, he purchased his first oil tanker, the Spyros, which was used for the transportation of liquid molasses from Egypt to Greece and the UK. In the following years, his fleet expanded significantly, with the acquisition of passenger vessels, cargo ships and oil tankers. In the 1990s, Latsis’ fleet was one of the largest under Greek ownership.

In the late 1960s, he diversified his business to include oil – establishing Petrola — and construction, building (among other things) oil refineries in Greece and Saudi Arabia, before gradually expanding into banking and financial services.

Latsis also invested in yacht management and established a private airline, LatsisAir (later renamed PetrolAir). In the early 1980s, he made his first investment in the banking sector, with the acquisition of the Banque de Dépôt, a small bank based in Geneva.  Banque de Dépôt eventually evolved into EFG International Bank, one of the largest Swiss private banks listed on the Zurich stock exchange.

His European Financial Group owns banks in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Monaco, the Channel Islands and Greece.

In 1990, he hosted the G7 Economic Conference at Bridgewater House, Westminster, London. He was a close friend of Charles, Prince of Wales, twice loaning him the use of his yacht &quot;Alexandros&quot;, firstly in 1991 for a second honeymoon with the Princess of Wales, and secondly in 2002 for a cruise with Camilla Parker-Bowles. Others to whom he lent the ship included former US President George H. W. Bush, Colin Powell and Marlon Brando. He also maintained close ties with the Saudi royal family.

Latsis donated £5 million to the British Conservative Party during his business career.

== Business empire ==
The Latsis commercial empire has been closely involved with German firm Hochtief in both constructing and managing Spata airport. Through Hellenic Petroleum, one of Greece&#x27;s largest oil companies – in which another partner is the Russian oil giant LUKoil – it holds the contract for all fuel supplies to the airport, through an EU-funded pipeline built by a Latsis engineering company. Hellenic Petroleum, according to its own accounts, in 2000, paid $912 million to acquire a 34 percent interest in the Athens Airport Fuel Pipeline Company.

A Latsis company also has a 50 percent stake in the huge contract for running most of the airport&#x27;s &quot;ground-handling&quot; services – almost everything except control of the aircraft themselves.

Latsis&#x27;s development arm, Lamda, is a partner with Hochtief in a series of vast, part-EU funded motorway projects across Greece, as part of the &quot;Trans European Network&quot;. And between 1999 and 2004, during the time when Spata airport was completed, the commission last week revealed that the giant EFG Eurobank Ergasias banking group, controlled by Latsis family interests, held an exclusive contract to handle all EU structural funds coming to Greece, totalling €28 billion.

==Philanthropy==
His charitable works began with the establishment of the Latsis Scholarships Institute in 1970 and also included the provision of aid to earthquake victims and the creation of the Latsis Foundation. Two years after his passing in 2003, his immediate family founded the John S. Latsis Public Benefit Foundation in his memory, that undertook the activity of the aforementioned scholarship fund and all the philanthropic work of the family.

== Awards ==
He was awarded the Golden Cross from the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and the Grand Cross of the Order of the Phoenix by Greece.

== Personal life ==
Latsis married Erietta Tsoukala. They had three children: Spiros, Marianna and Margarita. Spiros is a trustee of the Friends of Europe, an EU-wide lobbying organisation for greater political integration. His grandson Paris Latsis (son of Marianna) was the former fiancé of Paris Hilton.

<text>USS &quot;Helena&quot; (CA-75), a heavy cruiser, was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the city of Helena, Montana. Originally laid down as the USS &quot;Des Moines&quot;, she was renamed &quot;Helena&quot; while under construction after the 5 October 1944 cancellation of the light cruiser USS &quot;Helena&quot; (CL-113).

== Construction and commissioning ==
&quot;Helena&quot; was launched at the Bethlehem Steel Company in Quincy, Massachusetts, on 28 April 1945, sponsored by Mrs. John T. Haytin, wife of the mayor of Helena. She was commissioned on 4 September 1945 with Captain Arthur Howard McCollum in command.

=== 1940s ===
&quot;Helena&quot; completed her outfitting in the Boston, Massachusetts, area and departed on 24 October 1945, arriving in New York City the next day to take part in the tremendous celebration of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s role in World War II victory that marked Navy Day, 27 October 1945. After two shakedown cruises and training periods at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, &quot;Helena&quot; returned to Boston in February 1946 to prepare for her first deployment, a round-the-world cruise. &quot;Helena&quot; departed Boston on 12 February 1946 for England, where Admiral H. Kent Hewitt boarded and broke his flag as Commander Naval Forces, Europe, and Commander, 12th Fleet. During the next three months, &quot;Helena&quot; conducted training exercises in Northern European waters and paid good-will visits to major ports in England and Scotland.

Relieved as flagship on 1 May 1946, &quot;Helena&quot; departed for East Asia via the Suez Canal, calling at major Mediterranean ports; Colombo, Ceylon; and Singapore before arriving at Qingdao, China, on 18 June 1946. During her tour in East Asia, &quot;Helena&quot; took part in a wide variety of training exercises and fleet maneuvers until she finally departed Shanghai, China, on 22 March 1947 for the United States after more than a year in foreign waters.

After training operations in California waters &quot;Helena&quot; departed once more for the East Asia on 3 April 1948, arriving at Shanghai 24 days later. Throughout the summer and fall of 1948, she operated primarily in Chinese waters, returning to Long Beach, California, in December 1948.

&quot;Helena&quot; spent much of the spring of 1949 in training a new crew and in May 1949 cruised to train Naval Reservists, returning to Long Beach for a conversion necessary to equip her to carry a helicopter. During July and August 1949, &quot;Helena&quot; took part in a six-week at-sea training cruise for men of the Naval Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps to the Galapagos Islands and Panama. She then took part in Operation Miki, a joint United States Army-U.S. Navy amphibious training exercise in the Hawaiian Islands conducted in November 1949.

&quot;Helena&quot; then proceeded via Yokosuka, Japan, and Hong Kong to the Philippines, where she conducted training exercises. She returned to Japan in January 1950, and soon after experienced the highlights of her service as flagship of the United States Seventh Fleet when the Joint Chiefs of Staff, then touring East Asia, embarked on 2 February 1950. During the remainder of her East Asian tour she carried out a schedule of large-scale fleet exercises off Okinawa and visits to Japanese ports. She departed for the United States on 21 May 1950.

=== 1950s ===

==== Korean War ====

&quot;Helena&#x27;s&quot; schedule called for a summer spent in Long Beach, California, followed by an overhaul at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard. Suddenly came word of the communist aggression in Korea. Hurriedly she prepared for sea; and, on 6 July 1950, sped westward. Stopping at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, only to take on ammunition, she plowed across the Pacific and into action on the east coast of Korea. On 7 August, she first unleashed her guns on an enemy target—the railroad marshalling yards, trains, and power plant near Tanchon.

Serving as flagship of the Bombardment Task Group, &quot;Helena&quot; pounded enemy positions, aiding immeasurably in keeping the invaders off balance and preventing them from mounting a formidable drive, as United Nations forces prepared to take the offensive. Operations such as hers provided the diversion necessary to cover the powerful amphibious assault into Inchon, on 15 September 1950, Later, &quot;Helena&quot; provided gunfire support for Korean troops pushing the invaders north along the east coast, and it was &quot;Helena&quot;″s, concentrated firepower that aided in creating a diversion at Samcheok, and in the recapture of Pohang.

Valuable as she was in Korean waters, &quot;Helena&quot; could no longer put off overhaul, and in November 1950 she arrived at Long Beach to prepare for the now twice-postponed yard period.

After her overhaul, she reported for duty in Sasebo, Japan, on 18 April 1951, and was assigned to Task Force 77, the fast carrier group making daily air strikes against the enemy. While operating as heavy support for the carriers, &quot;Helena&quot; was often detached to pound shore targets. During June 1951, she was occupied almost continually in interdiction fire at targets along the east coast of Korea, subsequently she returned to the Task Force, At twilight on a day late in July, &quot;Helena&quot; was straddled and then hit by shore gunfire. Damage was light, and, swiftly twisting around the harbor in the maneuver which came to be called &quot;the war dance&quot;, &quot;Helena&quot; delivered rapid continuous fire that destroyed seven enemy gun positions and an ammunition dump. After a short respite at Yokosuka, she returned again to the Task Force, but was soon detached for special duty supporting a massive air strike on supply depots and rail road marshalling yards at Rason, acting as radar picket.

&quot;Helena&#x27;s&quot; accurate gunnery was next sought by the Eighth Army, for whom she fired at 13 targets along the bombline in aid of advancing infantry. Her support to ground forces continued with missions fired for United States Marines and Republic of Korea Army units. On 20 September 1951 she returned to Yokosuka. Here, at a ceremony on her decks, President Syngman Rhee of Korea presented to Task Force 95 the first Korean Presidential Unit Citation awarded to a naval unit. &quot;Helena&quot; received the award for her operations in the fall of 1950.

After rejoining the Task Force, &quot;Helena&quot; was ordered to duty as fire support vessel in the Hungnam-Hamhung area. With her helicopter providing its usual efficient spotting, she fired with great success on rail and highway bridges, marshalling yards and gun positions for the next 2 weeks.

&quot;Helena&quot; returned to Long Beach on 8 December 1951 and her entire battery of nine guns was replaced. In February, she commenced training for return to the Far East. One of the highlights of this training period came from 14 February to 23 February 1952 when she took part in &quot;Lex Baker One&quot;, the largest scale training exercise held since the outbreak of the Korean War. Over 70 ships and 15,000 sailors and Marines took active part in this operation.

&quot;Helena&quot; arrived once again at Yokosuka on 8 June 1952 and the next day was underway to rendezvous with Task Force 77 off the coast of Korea. For 5 months her mission again was to burn buildings, destroy gun positions, and smash transportation facilities; all were left in her wake after shore bombardments. She also performed air rescue of pilots, two of whom were deep in enemy territory.

On 24 November 1952, &quot;Helena&quot; was relieved of her normal duties at Yokosuka and 5 days later sailed on a special mission. She called first at Iwo Jima where on 1 December Admiral Arthur W. Radford, Commander In Chief Pacific Fleet, boarded the ship by helicopter to visit briefly. Two days later she proceeded to Guam, where President-Elect Dwight D. Eisenhower, with several of his prospective cabinet members, and Admiral Radford embarked for passage to Pearl Harbor. Top-level policy conferences were held on board. &quot;Helena&#x27;s&quot; distinguished passengers disembarked at Pearl Harbor on 11 December 1952, and she returned to Long Beach on 16 December.

==== Post-Korean War ====
&quot;Helena&quot; departed for the Far East on 4 August 1953 to join Task Force 77 on security patrol in the Sea of Japan and after another voyage to the United States for upkeep and training, rejoined the 7th Fleet at Yokosuka as flagship on 11 October 1954. &quot;Helena&quot; spent much of her time in waters off Taiwan. The highlights of &quot;Helena&quot;″s service during this tour of duty came in February 1955 during the evacuation of the Dachen Islands. These off-shore islands posed a possible point of contention between the Nationalist and Communist Chinese; and it was determined to neutralize them by means of evacuation. On 6 February came the &quot;execute&quot; from President Eisenhower, and the fleet, led by &quot;Helena&quot;, got underway. By 1500 on 9 February 1955, with Helena on watchful patrol, all civilians had been removed to safety from the islands—a total of 18,000 people. Early on 12 February the remaining 20,000 Nationalist troops were removed and, as &quot;Helena&quot; steamed on rear guard patrol, the Task Force sailed south.

After 6 months&#x27; training in home waters, &quot;Helena&quot; again sailed for Yokosuka, arriving on 25 January 1956. During the 6 months of this tour of duty, she once more operated primarily in the Taiwan area and briefly in Philippine waters on exercises. She returned to Long Beach on 8 July. While there alterations were performed replacing her fore and aft masts and enclosing her navigation and flag bridges.

Exercises, which included firing of the Regulus I missile from &quot;Helena&quot;″s launching gear, continued for 9 months, and then she headed for another Far East tour on 10 April 1957. During the ensuing tour of duty, she played her flagship role fully, combining sea power and diplomacy.

&quot;Helena&quot; returned to Long Beach on 19 October. Following a major overhaul completed on 31 March 1958 and intensive training, including missile launching, she again sailed west.

&quot;Helena&quot;″s 1958 cruise in the Far East began on 3 August. Her first port of call was Keelung, Taiwan, arriving on 21 August. On the next day, students and faculty of the Taiwan National Defense College were received on board for a tour of the ship. Her schedule next called for a visit to Manila, but the crisis brought on by the Chinese Communist shelling of the off-shore islands of Quemoy and Matsu governed by the Nationalists interrupted normal operations.

During the next weeks, &quot;Helena&quot; patrolled the troubled area. On 7 September she steamed to within of the Chinese mainland, covering Chinese Nationalist supply ships replenishing Quemoy Island. While on this duty, she was illustrating once more the fact that the mere presence of the overwhelming naval strength of the United States is one of the most formidable protections the free world has in deterring such aggression.

On 9 October 1958, while off the Philippines, word flashed to &quot;Helena&quot; to proceed to the aid of a stricken merchant vessel of Norwegian registry, the Hoi Wong, which had run aground on Bombay Reef in the Paracel Islands. &quot;Helena&quot; reached the scene at 1000, on 10 October 1958. Her helicopters rescued men, women and children, whom she transported to Hong Kong. Her men had skillfully and courageously carried out a difficult humanitarian mission, another contribution to strengthening American relationships with Asian nations. &quot;Helena&quot; resumed patrol and readiness operations until her return to Long Beach on 17 February 1959.

=== 1960s ===
On 5 January 1960 &quot;Helena&quot; departed for the Western Pacific in company with USS &quot;Yorktown&quot; and her escort of Destroyer Squadron 23. Visits to Korea and to Taiwan prefaced her participation in Operation Blue Star, one of the largest peacetime amphibious exercises in our history.

After a period in Japan, &quot;Helena&quot; sailed with USS &quot;Ranger&quot; and &quot;Saint Paul&quot; to Guam. On 24 April 1960, &quot;Helena&quot;, in company with destroyers USS &quot;Taylor&quot; and USS &quot;Jenkins&quot;, set sail for Australia. She then returned to Long Beach and from June until November underwent extensive overhaul. In mid-January 1961 she became the permanent flagship of Commander, 1st Fleet.

On 17 May 1961, led by the &quot;Helena&quot;, 12 1st Fleet ships put on a firepower demonstration for more than 700 members of the American Ordnance Association. In June, &quot;Helena&quot;, with eight guests of the Secretary of the Navy on board, cruised to Portland, Oregon, for the Rose Festival.

During the next months, &quot;Helena&quot; joined in Exercise Tail Wind, rendezvousing with the cruiser , the guided missile frigate and their destroyer escort to form the largest &quot;Fleet Sail&quot; in 4 years. &quot;Helena&quot; visited major ports of the Far East, rode out Typhoon Olga off Hong Kong, then returned to San Diego, California, on 6 October, soon to participate in Exercise Covered Wagon. During the remainder of the year, &quot;Helena&quot; participated in a major fleet demonstration observed by the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral George W. Anderson. Her last operation of the year was Exercise &quot;Black Bear.&quot;

During 1961 and 1962, &quot;Helena&quot;, operated in United States West Coast and western Pacific waters, taking part in several amphibious operations with ships of the 1st Fleet and elements of the 1st Marine Division and 3rd Marine Air Wing. &quot;Helena&quot; embarked foreign and staff officers from the Naval War College in March 1962, and two groups of Navy League members engaged in orientation cruises in June and August.

As 1962 ended, &quot;Helena&quot; was scheduled for inactivation at Long Beach Naval Shipyard. On 18 March 1963, Commander 1st Fleet shifted his flag to &quot;Saint Paul&quot;.

She appeared as a search/recovery vessel in the 1963 movie &quot;A Ticklish Affair.&quot;

=== Decommissioning ===
&quot;Helena&quot; was placed out of commission in reserve on 29 June 1963, after serving (just two months shy of) 18 continuous years of service. &quot;Helena&quot; was transferred on 30 June 1963 to San Diego Group Pacific Reserve Fleet. Stricken on 1 January 1974, and sold to Levin Metals Co., San Jose, Calif., on 13 November 1974, and scrapped in Richmond, Calif the following year.

== Awards ==
For her service in the Korean War, &quot;Helena&quot; was presented the Presidential Unit Citation of the Republic of Korea and the Korean Service Medal with four stars.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Helena&quot;″s ship&#x27;s bell, her anchor chain, and one of her propellers are located in downtown Helena, Montana, on the grounds of the Walking Mall, outside the Lewis &amp; Clark County Library.

Boilers from the &quot;Helena&quot; continue to be used in the ArcJet Complex at NASA Ames Research Center to operate a large steam injection vacuum pump system.

<text>Bachmann Branchline is a British OO gauge model railway brand manufactured by Bachmann Europe PLC, a subsidiary of Bachmann Industries, and is used for British outline OO scale model railways. 
Bachmann, a US company founded in 1835, was purchased by Kader Industries in 1987. Kader had previously produced models for Palitoy under the Mainline brand. Palitoy required its manufacturers to produce and retain ownership of the toolings and Kader had used the toolings and added new ones for models commissioned by Replica Railways following the demise of Mainline.

Kader formed Bachmann Europe PLC in 1989 with its main UK headquarters in Moat Way, Barwell, and the following year launched the Bachmann Branchline range for the British market with the moulds that had previously been used for Mainline Railways and Replica. From this starting point Bachmann has developed the range further and now produce a large range of models competing in particular with Hornby.

In 2000, Bachmann Europe PLC bought Graham Farish, an N gauge manufacturer, and since then many of its models have been made available in both gauges.

== Items ==

Bachmann is known for its consistent quality of model trains . Many of its trains include NEM pockets, making it possible to replace standard tension lock coupling with close couplings such as Kadees or screw link couplings.

== Models produced ==

The following locomotive models have been produced, or announced by Bachmann Branchline:

===Diesel locomotives===
===Electric locomotives===
===Diesel multiple units===
===Electric multiple units===
===Steam Locomotives===

<text>John McClintock, 1st Baron Rathdonnell (26 August 1798 – 17 May 1879), was an Irish Conservative peer and Member of Parliament.

==Biography==
He was the eldest son of John McClintock, an Irish magistrate for County Louth, and formerly Serjeant at Arms in the Irish House of Commons. His mother was Jane, the only daughter of William Bunbury, Esq of Moyle. Jane was sister to Thomas Bunbury, MP for County Carlow. McClintock was appointed High Sheriff of Louth in 1840 and elected Member of Parliament for County Louth in 1857, a seat he held until 1859. He later served as Lord Lieutenant of County Louth from 1867 until his death in 1879. On 21 December 1868 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Rathdonnell, of Rathdonnell in the County of Donegal, with remainder to the male issue of his deceased younger brother Captain William McClintock-Bunbury. It was to be the second last title granted in the Irish peerage.

Lord Rathdonnell was married to Anne Lefroy, sister of Sir John Henry Lefroy, and they lived between Drumcar, County Louth, and their London house at 80 Chester Square. The marriage was childless. Rathdonnell was also an uncle of the Arctic explorer Sir Francis Leopold McClintock. Lord Rathdonnell died in May 1879, aged 80. He was succeeded in the Barony according to the special remainder by his nephew Thomas McClintock-Bunbury, who notably served as Lord Lieutenant of County Carlow and as President of the Royal Dublin Society.

<doc id="562363" wikidata="Q6267153" url="?curid=562363" title="Johnny Longden">
<text>John Eric &quot;Johnny&quot; Longden (February 14, 1907 – February 14, 2003) was an American Hall of Fame and National Champion jockey and a trainer of Thoroughbred racehorses who was born in Wakefield, Yorkshire, England. His father emigrated to Canada in 1909, settling in Taber, Alberta.

==Career==

By 1912, Longden Sr. had saved enough money to send for his wife and young son to join him in Canada. However, the Longdens&#x27; train was late getting to the port of Southampton, and they missed their scheduled voyage to New York City on the &quot;Titanic&quot;.

As a young man, Longden Jr. worked in the mining industry. His love of horses and horse-racing, as well as his small stature standing at 4&#x27; 11&#x27;, led him to leave Canada in 1927 to seek opportunities as a jockey in California&#x27;s burgeoning racing scene. Based at Santa Anita Park, by 1956 he had become thoroughbred racing&#x27;s winningest rider, breaking the record of 4,870 wins by British jockey Sir Gordon Richards (1904–1988). Longden, who was called &quot;The Pumper&quot; by his fellow jockeys because of his riding style, rode many of the great thoroughbreds of the day. In 1943, he captured the United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing winning the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes aboard Count Fleet. A sculptured bust of Longden, along with busts of fellow jockeys William Shoemaker and Laffit Pincay, has been placed in the paddock area at Santa Anita Racetrack in Arcadia, California.

A founding member of the Jockeys&#x27; Guild in 1940, Longden was the United States&#x27; leading jockey in races won in 1938, 1947, and 1948. He was also the leading jockey in purses won in 1943 and 1945. He was voted the prestigious George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award in 1952.

In 1958, Longden was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. He retired the following year as the jockey with the most wins in racing history with 6,032 victories from his 32,413 mounts. His last ride was in the 1966 San Juan Capistrano Handicap at Santa Anita Park, which he won aboard George Royal in a stretch duel. The clubhouse at Santa Anita Park contains an oil painting of the finish of this race. The image was used for the cover of the Santa Anita official program during the 1967 racing season.

==Horse ownership and training career==
Longden operated a racing stable under the name Alberta Ranches Ltd. in partnership with Frank McMahon, Wilder H. Ripley and Max Bell, longtime friends from Alberta. On January 28, 1971, Longden&#x27;s wife Hazel became the first woman to train a stakes winner at Santa Anita Park when her horse Diplomatic Agent won the San Vicente Stakes. Longden&#x27;s sons Eric and Vance Longden both became horse trainers.

Following his retirement from riding, Longden turned to training and became the only person to ever win the Kentucky Derby as both a jockey and trainer when he captured the 1969 Derby with Frank McMahon&#x27;s colt Majestic Prince. Longden was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame on its formation in 1976. He went on to become the second ever recipient of the Avelino Gomez Memorial Award in 1985, given annually to jockeys who have made significant contributions to the sport. In 1994, he was recognized further by the North American racing industry with a Special Eclipse Award.

==Harness racing==
The June 12, 1954 issue of the &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot; reported that Johnny Longden was also an owner of a Standardbred racehorse which he personally drove to victory in a race at Sportsman&#x27;s Park in Phoenix, Arizona.

==Television appearance==

In 1957, Johnny Longden and his wife Hazel Longden, both appeared briefly as themselves on the legendary sitcom, I Love Lucy. In the episode, &quot;Lucy and the Loving Cup&quot; (Season 6 Episode 12), Longden was set to receive a trophy for being the winningest jockey in history at an awards dinner at the Babalú nightclub run by Ricky Ricardo. Early in the episode, Ricky makes fun of Lucy&#x27;s new hat, so she puts the trophy over her head as a joke, but it ends up stuck on her head; after many failed attempts to remove it, she is forced to comically make her way through the New York City subway system to get the trophy to the club in time for the ceremony. After a run-in with an elderly lady, a homeless man and a cop, Lucy finally makes it to the nightclub and the trophy (with Lucy&#x27;s head still stuck inside) is presented to a very confused Johnny Longden. Longden thanks Ricky for the trophy but asks what he should do about Ricky&#x27;s wife. Ricky replies that Lucy has been his problem for 15 years, so now Johnny can deal with her.

==Last years/legacy==
As of 2006, Longden still holds five track records at Santa Anita Park. Longden was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Longden died on his 96th birthday on St. Valentine&#x27;s Day at his home in Banning, California.

<text>The second USS &quot;Juneau&quot; (CL-119/CLAA-119) was the lead ship of the United States Navy s.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Juneau&quot; was laid down by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company in Kearny, New Jersey, on 15 September 1944; launched on 15 July 1945; sponsored by Mrs. B. L. Bartlett; and commissioned 15 February 1946.

==Service history==

===Mediterranean, 1946-1949===
&quot;Juneau&quot; spent her first year of commissioned service in operations along the Atlantic seaboard and Caribbean. Prior to the Korean War, she deployed three times in the Mediterranean. The ship cleared New York on 16 April 1947, and joined the 6th Fleet at Trieste on 2 May where she aided in stabilizing the unresolved question of territorial ownership between Italy and Yugoslavia. During an extended tour of Greece, she provided ample warning to the communists that aggression would not go unchallenged. The ship returned to Norfolk on 15 November for training, and was back on duty with the 6th Fleet from 14 June-3 October 1948 and again from 3 May-26 September 1949. As on her first cruise, she ranged the Mediterranean to assure Europeans and Africans of our intention to guard world peace and freedom.

Having been reclassified CLAA-119 on 18 March 1949, &quot;Juneau&quot; departed Norfolk on 29 November for the Pacific.

===Korean War, 1950-1952===
She arrived at Bremerton, Washington, on 15 January 1950 and took part in operations along the Pacific coast. On 22 April, she became flagship for Rear Admiral J. M. Higgins, Commander Cruiser Division 5 (CruDiv 5), and reported for duty in Yokosuka, Japan on 1 June, where she began surveillance patrols in the Tsushima Straits. When the Korean War broke out on 25 June, &quot;Juneau&quot; was one of the few ships immediately available to Vice Admiral C. Turner Joy, Commander of Naval Forces, Far East. She patrolled south of the 38th parallel to prevent enemy landings, conducted the first shore bombardments on 29 June at Bokuko Ko, destroyed enemy shore installations, engaged in the first naval action on 2 July when she sank three enemy torpedo boats near Chumonchin Chan, and supported raiding parties along the coast. On 18 July, &quot;Juneau&quot;″s force, which included British units such as the Royal Navy light cruiser , laid down a deadly barrage on enemy troop concentrations near Yongdok which slowed down the North Korean advance southward.

The ship departed Sasebo Harbor on 28 July and made a sweep through the Formosa Straits before reporting for duty with the 7th Fleet at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 2 August. She became flagship of the Formosa Patrol Force on 4 August, remaining until 29 October when she joined the Fast Carrier Task Force operating off the east coast of Korea. The ship conducted daily plane guard for the attack carriers, and returned to Long Beach, California, on 1 May 1951 for overhaul. In nine months she was updated with improved Mk 37, 56 and 63 fire control and an improved armament of 14 3-inch/50cal (6x2 &amp; 2x1) and 12 5-inch (6x2). Underway on Jan 26 1952 and a period of operations off the Pacific coast and in Hawaii. She returned to Yokosuka on 19 April 1952 and conducted strikes along the Korean coast in coordination with carrier planes until returning to Long Beach on 5 November.

===Atlantic, 1953-1955===
&quot;Juneau&quot; engaged in training maneuvers and operations until 7 April 1953 when she arrived Norfolk to rejoin the Atlantic Fleet. On 13 May the cruiser departed for duty with the 6th Fleet once again, and returned home on 23 October. She operated in the Atlantic and Caribbean until 18 November 1954, then returned to the Mediterranean for her last tour of duty.

==Decommissioning and sale==
After her return to the East Coast on 23 February 1955, she was placed in reserve at Philadelphia on 23 March 1955, and remained inactive until decommissioned on 23 July 1955. The ship was then attached to the Philadelphia Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet until 1 November 1959, when she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. &quot;Juneau&quot; was sold for scrapping to the Union Minerals and Alloys Corporation, New York in 1962.

<doc id="562374" wikidata="Q359026" url="?curid=562374" title="Tino Rossi">
<text>Constantin &quot;Tino&quot; Rossi (29 April 1907 – 26 September 1983) was a French singer and film actor of Corsican origin.

Born in Ajaccio, Corsica, Rossi was gifted with a voice well suited for opera. He became a tenor in the French cabaret style. Later, he appeared in various movies. During his career it is reported he recorded over 2000 songs and he appeared in more than 25 films, the most notable of which was the 1954 production, &quot;Si Versailles m&#x27;était conté...&quot; directed by Sacha Guitry. His romantic ballads had especially women swooning and his art songs by Jules Massenet (1842–1912), Reynaldo Hahn (1875–1947), and other composers, sold out theaters wherever he performed.

Among his most famous hits, &quot;Petit Papa Noel&quot; sold over 30 million copies worldwide. Over the course of his 50-year singing career, Tino Rossi recorded over 2000 songs and sold over 200 million albums making him one of the best selling (and mostly forgotten) artists of all time.

==Biography==

As a young man, Rossi played guitar and sang in many places of his hometown of Ajaccio, but later he went to perform in Marseille and at resort clubs along the French Riviera. In the early 1930s he went to Paris and within a few years achieved enormous success, joining a Columbia Records roster that included the biggest stars of that time such as Lucienne Boyer, Damia, Pills et Tabet, Mireille, and Jean Sablon.

Rossi&#x27;s success was greatly aided by songwriter Vincent Scotto (1876–1952), who wrote his first hits and collaborated with him for many years, composing and arranging many of Rossi&#x27;s songs. Prior to World War II, Rossi was a major box office attraction in the French-speaking world, and expanded his audience in 1938 to the U.S. and Canada during a first visit there. Rossi began his film career with a role in &quot;Les Nuits Moscovites&quot; (1934); his first real success came with &quot;Marinella&quot; (1936).

During the Occupation of France by Nazi Germany Rossi&#x27;s film career reached its peak, notably with &quot;Fièvres&quot; (1942), &quot;Le Soleil a toujours raison&quot; (1943), &quot;Mon amour est près de toi&quot; (1943) and &quot;L&#x27;Île d&#x27;amour&quot; (1944). Like many celebrities, Tino Rossi was arrested on 7 October 1944 by several police officers in search of information on his close Corsican friend, Etienne Leandri, suspected of active collaborationism. Following three months&#x27; detention in the prison of Fresnes, near Paris, during which he stubbornly refused the assistance of a lawyer, he was freed from further detention by a judge, who deemed the charge leveled against him void of substance. Tino Rossi who, in October 1943, had loaned his personal car to a resistance network to transport weapons and enable several escapes (including that of a general), accepted—an extremely rare action at the time—exceptional official apologies.

In 1946 he recorded his song &quot;Petit Papa Noël&quot; for a movie. The song remained classic for the family and sold several million copies after being released on CD in 1992.

He is the recipient of the prestigious musical award Grand Prix du Disque.

==Personal life==
In 1948, Tino Rossi married Lilia Vetti, a young dancer he had met in 1941 thanks to revue leader Mistinguett. They had one son, Laurent (1948–2015), and remained married until Tino&#x27;s death in 1983. In 1982, President François Mitterrand named Rossi a Commander of the Legion of Honour for his contributions to French culture. That same year, Rossi gave his last public performance at the Casino de Paris, a show that popular demand turned into a three-month stint.

==Death==
Rossi died of pancreatic cancer in 1983 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France. His body was transported to Ajaccio for burial in the family grave. His wife died in 2003 aged 79. 

Ajaccio named a street and the sailing harbor in his honor and in Nogent-sur-Marne, there is a square named Tino Rossi Square. A garden on the banks of the Seine in Paris - the Jardin Tino Rossi - was also named in his honour.

Tino Rossi&#x27;s unique status on Corsica is reflected in several (somewhat hidden) references to him in the comic book &quot;Asterix in Corsica&quot; (1973) by Uderzo and Goscinny.

<doc id="562375" wikidata="Q1024804" url="?curid=562375" title="United National Congress">
<text>The United National Congress ( UNC or UNCTT) is one of two major political parties in Trinidad and Tobago and the current parliamentary opposition. The UNC is a centre-left party. It was founded in 1989 by Basdeo Panday, a Trinidadian lawyer, economist, trade unionist, and actor after a split in the ruling National Alliance for Reconstruction (NAR). After spending six years in opposition, the UNC won control of the government in 1995, initially in coalition with the NAR and later on its own. In the 2000 general election, the UNC won an absolute majority in the Parliament. In 2001, a split in the party caused the UNC to lose its parliamentary majority and control of the government. From 2001 to 2010, the UNC was once again Parliamentary Opposition party. In May 2010, the UNC returned to government as the majority party in the People&#x27;s Partnership. The UNC&#x27;s Political Leader, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, was sworn in as the first female Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago. Kamla Persad-Bissessar was Prime Minister from 2010 until 2015. 

The party symbol is the sun rising above the Trinity Hills. Historically, the UNC has been supported by a majority of Indo-Trinidadians and Tobagonians, especially Hindu Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonians, thus it is colloquially called the &quot;Indian Party&quot; or the &quot;Hindu Party&quot;. The Spiritual Baptist and other racial and religious minorities of the country also support the party.

In opposition since the 2015 general election, the party holds 19 out of 41 Members of Parliament in the House of Representatives and 6 out of 31 members of the Senate, as mandated by the Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago to the official parliamentary opposition. The party has 67 out of the 139 local councillors and is in control of 7 of the 14 regional corporations since the 2019 Trinidadian local elections. The party has no representation in the Tobago House of Assembly.

As of December 2020, the UNC has 120,000+ registered members.

== Opposition party (1989–1995) ==
The party was founded on 30 April 1989 following a split in the ruling NAR. Six members of parliament, all of whom were former members of the United Labour Front, left the NAR to form the Caucus for Love, Unity and Brotherhood 1988 (CLUB &#x27;88) which was chaired by Rampersad Parasram. CLUB &#x27;88 evolved into the UNC with Panday as leader and Parasram as its first chairman.

The UNC won 13 seats in the 1991 general election and became the official opposition. It won a 14th seat in a by-election and gained another in 1995 when Ralph Maraj defected from the ruling People&#x27;s National Movement (PNM) party. In 1995, the UNC lost one seat when Hulsie Bhaggan, member of parliament for Chaguanas, left the party to form the Movement for Unity and Progress (MUP).

== Governing party (1995–2001) ==

In the 1995 general election, the UNC won 17 of 36 seats and formed a coalition government with the NAR which won 2 seats. In exchange for his support, NAR Political Leader A. N. R. Robinson was first appointed Minister Extraordinaire and then elected President in 1997. Two PNM MPs defected and supported the UNC as independent members. This gave the UNC an absolute majority and caused relations with the NAR to deteriorate.

In the 2000 general election, the UNC won 19 seats and formed a majority government. However, internal party elections in 2001 exposed a rift in the party between Panday and Attorney-General Ramesh Maharaj, who fielded rival slates. Maharaj&#x27;s slate termed itself &#x27;Team Unity&#x27;. Though Panday was not challenged as Political Leader, Maharaj&#x27;s slate won 21 of the 24 executive posts, and Maharaj himself was elected Deputy Leader.

Panday refused to recommend Maharaj as Acting Prime Minister in his absence. Maharaj countered by initiating investigations into charges of corruption by Panday and his supporters. Panday then reduced the ministerial portfolios of Maharaj and his supporters. This led to the defection of Maharaj; two of his supporters, Agriculture Minister Trevor Sudama and Information Technology Minister Ralph Maraj, formed a new political party: Team Unity. Early elections were called in 2001, in which the UNC was reduced to 18 seats in the House of Representatives. The opposition PNM, which also won 18 seats, was called upon to form the government.

== Return to opposition (2001–2010) ==
=== 2002 general election ===
During the 2002 general elections, the UNC won 46.5% of the popular vote and 16 out of 36 seats in the House of Representatives. It became the opposition party to the ruling PNM government, which held the other 20 seats.

=== Party infighting ===
In April 2005, the UNC was further weakened when Pointe-à-Pierre MP Gillian Lucky and San Juan MP Fuad Khan declared themselves to be &quot;independent UNC members&quot; and relocated to the Opposition backbenches. On 31 May 2005, Panday, his wife Oma, former UNC MP Carlos John, and party financier Ishwar Galbaransingh were arrested for bribery. Panday refused bail and remained in prison for eight days.

On 2 September 2005, Panday announced that he would be willing to hand over party leadership to Winston Dookeran, MP for St. Augustine, if Panday could remain party chairman. As a result of negotiations between the two, Dookeran was nominated unopposed for the post of Political Leader and Panday was nominated unopposed for the party Chairmanship. However, both fielded rival slates for the remaining 16 executive posts.

On 2 October, Panday&#x27;s slate won 12 of the posts including two of the three deputy leader positions and, after a recount, the vice-chairmanship. Dookeran&#x27;s slate won the 4 remaining posts. Members of Dookeran&#x27;s slate called for Panday&#x27;s resignation as Leader of the Opposition. Gerald Yetming, MP for St. Joseph, joined the Opposition backbenches in protest of Panday&#x27;s refusal to relinquish his position.

In February 2006, Panday announced that he had reconciled with Maharaj, who marked his return to the party by speaking at a party rally held at Mid-Centre Mall in Chaguanas on 19 February. At that rally, Dookeran criticized his party for accepting Maharaj&#x27;s return and was booed by the crowd.

On 8 March 2006, Yetming announced he was formally leaving the UNC and would serve out his term as an independent. His chief reason was the return of Maharaj to the UNC, a move which he opposed.

As internal wranglings continued in the party, it appeared that a rift between Dookeran and the Executive was deepening. Newspaper accounts indicated that pro-Panday executives and Dookeran were largely functioning independently of each other. Dookeran also suffered a loss of support as Deputy Leader Jack Warner and Roodal Moonilal, MP for Oropouche, announced their support of Panday.

In March, Senator Robin Montano&#x27;s Senate appointment was revoked by Panday. Montano had supported Dookeran and opposed the return of Maharaj to the UNC.

On 24 April, Panday was convicted of fraud for failing to disclose a bank account under the rules of the Integrity Act. He was sentenced to 2 years hard labour. At the UNC rally held that night Dookeran was not permitted to speak on the platform. Maharaj, however was seated centre stage at that rally.

On 25 April, Panday&#x27;s appointment as Opposition Leader was revoked by President George Maxwell Richards. In a surprise move the next day, seven UNC MPs announced their support of Deputy Political Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar as the new Opposition Leader. Persad-Bissessar was appointed Opposition Leader the following day but stated that she would step aside should Panday&#x27;s appeal prove successful.

The Courts released Panday on bail on Friday 28 April, on the ground of his medical ailments. Following his release on bail, he tendered his resignation as chairman of the party on 1 May 2006. The UNC executive did not immediately accept his resignation.

=== Resignation of Dookeran and return of Panday ===
In the months following, infighting in the UNC increased. Dookeran and the party Executive were entrenched in opposing positions. Dookeran organised his own political apparatus and held political meetings without the Executive&#x27;s consent. He also ceased to attend Executive meetings and his few allies on the Executive were removed. Persad-Bissessar also replaced Dookeran&#x27;s supporters in the appointed Senate.

Amidst the infighting, Panday returned to active politics in August 2006 and attempted to publicly broker a reconciliation between the two factions. This proved fruitless. Many, including Panday&#x27;s supporters, privately held the view that Panday was working behind the scenes to undermine Dookeran&#x27;s support within the Executive. Dookeran, who was seen as the legitimate Political Leader of the UNC, was unable to exercise the full powers granted to him in the Party&#x27;s Constitution. However, Dookeran&#x27;s call for internal change within the UNC was negatively viewed by some of the party&#x27;s &#x27;old guards&#x27; who felt their position threatened.

Panday loyalists organised themselves into a five-member Leadership Council, composed of the three Deputy Leaders (Persad-Bissessar, Wade Mark, and Jack Warner), the Party CEO Tim Gopeesingh, and the newly returned Maharaj. Panday was said to have been appointed as an advisor to the council.

On 10 September at a large rally, Dookeran announced his resignation as UNC Political Leader and the formation of a new party: the Congress of the People. On 11 September, Panday resumed the Chairmanship of the party, and on 3 January 2007, Panday was reinstated as Political Leader of the party.

===2007 general election===
In the 5 November 2007 general election, the party won 29.73% of the popular vote and 15 out of 41 seats.

===Rise of Kamla Persad-Bissessar===

On 24 January 2010, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, member of parliament for Siparia, was elected the new leader of the UNC. In the internal election, she won 13,932 votes compared to 1,359 for Basdeo Panday and 1,072 for Ramesh Maharaj and became the first female leader of a major political party in Trinidad and Tobago.

==Return to government (2010–2015)==
Based on a campaign of change against the PNM, the UNC was successful in the 2010 general election, and Persad-Bissessar was appointed as the first-ever female Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago. The UNC won a majority of 21 seats. Their coalition controlled 29 seats in total; the Congress of the People won 6 seats and the Tobago Organization of the People won Tobago&#x27;s only 2 seats.

After the election, the coalition showed signs of weakening. The Movement for Social Justice, which did not win any seats in the election, left the coalition due to discontent with the running of the government. The Tobago Organization of the People failed to win a single seat in the 2013 Tobago House of Assembly elections.

During 2013, the UNC lost 2 seats in by-elections in St. Joseph and Chaguanas West.

==Second return to opposition (2015- )==
=== 2015 general election ===

In the 2015 general elections, the party won 18 of the 41 seats in the elections to form the main Opposition party in the 11th parliament of Trinidad and Tobago. Persad-Bissessar was appointed Leader of the Opposition by President Anthony Carmona on 21 September 2015.

=== 2015 internal election ===
An internal party election was held on 5 December 2015, which Kamla Persad-Bissessar won as political leader of the party against Roodal Moonilal and Vasant Bharath. Controversy arose when ballots in favor of Roodal Moonilal were found near a river and at the back of a school used as a polling station. The ballots were left out in the open with no visible attempts to destroy or hide them. Some names were found twice on the voting list, which may have allowed one individual to vote twice. Moonilal filed a complaint for these issues to be rectified, however Kamla Persad-Bissessar was declared the winner.

===2016 local election===

In the 2016 local election, the party won 54 of the 137 seats in the elections and held the majority in 6 of the 14 local councils. According to the election authorities, three of the UNC&#x27;s candidates were found ineligible or withdrew themselves before polling day, resulting in a walkover victory for the PNM in one district.

===2017 internal election===
In the 2017 internal elections Kamla Persad-Bissessar won virtually all of the votes to continue as political leader of the party against Chanda Bhaggan and Christine Newallo Hosein. The voter turnout was the lowest recorded in an internal election for the UNC at the time.

===2020 general elections===

The 2020 general elections took place on the 10th of August 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The UNC&#x27;s campaign was based on the incumbent PNM government&#x27;s mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic, not doing more to control the Venezuelan refugee crisis and having a failing economy. However, Leader of the Opposition Kamla Persad-Bissessar faced backlash due to her statements on her opponent Prime Minister Keith Rowley as a &quot;blank man on the other side&quot;, which many interpreted her as saying the &quot;black man&quot;, however it was noted that later in her speech&#x27;s transcript she referenced the &quot;blank man&quot; numerous times. The party also faced questions of corruption amid a police investigation that involved members of the UNC. The UNC won 19 of the 41 constituencies, giving them two more seat than previously held. The results in six constituencies were subject to recounts, causing the final election results to be delayed by a week. This was the first parliamentary election in Trinidad and Tobago where the result was not finalized the day after the election. However, after the recount the UNC did not gain any constituencies, and remained the opposition in the parliament.

===2020 internal election===

The 2020 internal election took place on the 6th of December 2020, after Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar, the current leader of the UNC, faced losses commencing in January 2013 with the wipeout of her People&#x27;s Partnership-led administration from the Tobago House of Assembly due to the landslide victory of the Tobago Council of the People&#x27;s National Movement at the 2013 Tobago House of Assembly election, loss in the 2015 Trinidad and Tobago general election and loss in the 2020 Trinidad and Tobago general election. The candidates for political leader were incumbent Kamla Persad-Bissessar on Team Star against former member of parliament for St. Augustine and former Minister of Trade, Industry and Investment in the People&#x27;s Partnership&#x27;s government, Vasant Bharath, on Team Lotus. Former senator and Minister of Transport in the People&#x27;s Partnership&#x27;s government, Devant Maharaj, was an early candidate for political leader, but was never formally nominated as he dropped out on nomination day on the 15th of November 2020, citing irregularities in the voting process. He endorsed Vasant Bharath and Team Lotus.

Focus on the leadership election occurred when Anita Haynes, Public Relations Officer of the UNC, was questioned by reporters on whether or not the Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar would resign. Devant Maharaj was a leading figure in calling for Kamla Persad-Bissessar to step down as political leader. He actively called for her to step down on social media and on billboards he had put up. On the 27th of October 2020, Kamla Persad-Bissessar announced the date for the internal election to be held on Sunday the 6th of December 2020.

On election night, Persad-Bissessar said her Team Star was on the path to defeat Bharath&#x27;s Team Lotus. She called for unity within the party and said their main political opponent was the People&#x27;s National Movement. She claimed under her continued leadership that she would work to make the party more united and stronger. She also acknowledged that there was some reports of elections issues, but that overall everything had gone well. Persad-Bissessar said that the low voter turnout was due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as it was in the general election. Bharath conceded shortly after midnight and congratulated Persad-Bissessar and wished her success. He also stated the party needs to determine the reason for the low voter turnout then they need to &quot;inspire their ground troops&quot; to win the next general election. Bharath stated that he was willing to work with Persad-Bissessar to help rebuild the party. However, he mentioned that there were irregularities in the election which he had warned about and many were unable to vote. He said that active campaigner on Persad-Bissessar&#x27;s team were presiding officers, his team was not granted access to a revised list of electors, that there were reports of voters being verbally abused and intimidated, there was paraphernalia of the Star Team being distributed at some precincts, and that his father John Bharath, a founding member of the UNC, was not on the voting list and that there were other people who were not on the revised voter list who were allowed to vote. Devant Maharaj called on Persad-Bissessar to embrace all and rebuild the party. The election had the lowest voter turnout for an UNC internal election with only 17,066 members out of 120,000+ members coming out to vote. This follows after the last internal election in 2017 was recorded to have the lowest voter turnout.

Founder of the party, Basdeo Panday, commented before the election that the UNC had no future under the leadership of Kamla Persad-Bissessar nor Vassant Bharath and would eventually die out. He reiterated again after the election results that the UNC would die, pointing that it had the lowest voter turn out for an UNC internal election and says that the COVID-19 pandemic had nothing to do with it as the last internal election was the same. He further said that Kamla Persad-Bissessar killed the party &quot;beyond repair&quot; and that the only way to end the &quot;tribal politics&quot; was for a new party to be formed. However, political analyst Mukesh Basdeo disagreed with Panday, saying that the party received a significant number of votes despite the COVID-19 pandemic and that had the election been held in other conditions then it would have showed a decline in the interest of the party. He also stated that the pandemic deterred people from coming out to vote. He noted that smaller third parties were crushed in the 2020 general election and that most of the votes went to the two major parties, the UNC and the PNM.

<doc id="562376" wikidata="Q616488" url="?curid=562376" title="USS Leahy (DLG-16)">
<text>USS &quot;Leahy&quot; (DLG/CG-16) was the lead ship of a new class of destroyer leaders in the United States Navy. Named for Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy, she was commissioned on 4 August 1962 as DLG-16, a guided missile frigate, and reclassified as CG-16, a guided missile cruiser, on 30 June 1975.

From 1962 to 1976, &quot;Leahy&quot; operated as a unit of the Atlantic Fleet and from 1976 to 1993 as a unit of the Pacific Fleet. She made six Mediterranean deployments (Sixth Fleet), two UNITAS Latin America cruises and eight Western Pacific deployments (Seventh Fleet), completed three Panama Canal transits, and crossed the equator over a dozen times. She traveled the seas from the easternmost end of the Mediterranean to the westernmost edge of the Indian Ocean. She steamed far north to Leningrad, Russia, and the Aleutian Islands; and far south for two passages through the Straits of Magellan. Over the course of her sixteen major deployments, &quot;Leahy&quot; made port calls on six continents—North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia.
&quot;Leahy&quot; served longer than any other ship of her class. After more than 31 years of active service all over the globe, the &quot;Sweet 16&quot; was decommissioned on 1 October 1993. After another 11 years in the reserve fleet, she was scrapped in Brownsville, Texas, in 2005.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Leahy&quot; was the first of a new &quot;double-ender&quot; class fitted with Terrier (later Standard ER) missile launchers fore and aft, and the first and only frigate class designed without a main gun battery for shore bombardment or ship-vs.-ship engagements. The gun armament was reduced in order to carry a larger missile load. One of the principal missions of these ships, like their predecessors, the , was to form part of the anti-air (AAW) and anti-submarine (ASW) screen for carrier task forces while also controlling aircraft from the carrier by providing vectors to assigned targets.

&quot;Leahy&quot; carried over the propulsion plant of the &quot;Farragut&quot; class, fitted into a longer hull designed with a knuckled &quot;hurricane&quot; bow that reduced plunging in rough seas, thus keeping her forecastle dry as needed to operate the forward missile launcher. Other features included an expanded electrical plant and increased endurance. A major design innovation was the use of &quot;macks&quot;—combined masts and stacks—on which the radars could be mounted without smoke interference.

Close-in anti-aircraft defense consisted of a pair of twin MK 22 3-inch/50 caliber guns; anti-submarine armament consisted of RUR-5 ASROC and two triple MK 32 torpedo mounts. The 3-inch gun mounts were replaced with Harpoon anti-ship missiles (ASM) and the Phalanx CIWS during an overhaul in 1981.

&quot;Leahy&quot; was laid down by Bath Iron Works Corp., Bath, Maine, 3 December 1959; launched 1 July 1961; sponsored by Mrs. Michael J. Mansfield, wife of Senator Mansfield, Montana, Senate Majority Leader; and commissioned 4 August 1962. For the traditional &quot;mast stepping&quot; ceremony during construction, an 1875 silver dollar was placed beneath the forward mack to honor the birth year of Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy.

==History==
After shakedown in the Caribbean, &quot;Leahy&quot; departed Boston on 19 September 1963 and reported to Charleston, South Carolina., where RADM E. E. Grimm, Commander Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla 6, selected her as his flagship. She then proceeded to the Jacksonville, Florida operating areas for type training. She briefly put into home port in November, then returned to the Caribbean to participate in AA warfare exercises.

On 2 January 1964, the DLG was again bound for the Caribbean for missile training, which ended 26 February. From 1 to 10 April, she joined in an amphibious exercise, &quot;Quick Kick V,&quot; and on 1 June was permanently assigned to Destroyer Squadron 6.

&quot;Leahy&quot; departed for duty with the Sixth Fleet on 17 July as part of a Fast Carrier Task Group, which included the aircraft carrier , and participated in a coordinated fleet exercise, &quot;MEDLANDEX-64,&quot; between the Balearic Islands and Sardinia. She then carried out independent training in the eastern Mediterranean before departing from Naples, Italy, on 22 September to join in NATO exercise &quot;FALLEX-64.&quot; She returned to Naples on 26 October and, in November, participated in another fleetwide exercise, &quot;POOPDECK-IV,&quot; which brought some 40 ships of Task Force 60 together off the coast of Spain.

&quot;Leahy&quot; departed from Barcelona, Spain, on 2 December 1964 for replenishment, and on 14 December drew the curtain on of steaming while deployed with the Sixth Fleet. She arrived at Charleston on 22 December and began a period of restricted availability in preparation for extensive tests to evaluate the Terrier Missile System. During these tests, which were completed in September 1965, &quot;Leahy&quot; was briefly deployed for the Dominican Republic Crisis from 28 April to 7 May 1965 as a unit of the Strike and Covering Force.

The vessel departed from Charleston on 30 November 1965 for the Mediterranean and relieved the destroyer at Puerto Pollensa, Majorca, 9 December. During this second deployment with the Sixth Fleet, she operated throughout the Mediterranean participating in ASW, gunnery, and AA warfare exercises as well as major fleet tactical operations alongside other NATO ships.
&quot;Leahy&quot; returned home to Charleston on 8 April 1966. During June and July, she gave some 60 midshipmen from Annapolis at-sea training, and visited ports along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean. Following this, &quot;Leahy&quot; conducted exercises with the navies of many South American countries as part of operation UNITAS VII. She sailed through the Panama Canal in early September, thence south and through the Straits of Magellan at the end of October.

The operation was completed on 6 December 1966 and the DLG returned to Charleston on 15 December. &quot;Leahy&quot; then prepared for massive modernization at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, arriving there on 27 January 1967 and decommissioning on 18 February. For over a year the ship received new AAW and ASW equipment, allowing her to utilize the most recent developments in the technology of naval warfare. The destroyer leader was placed in commission, special, on 4 May 1968 for the extensive period of testing her updated weapons systems. Leaving Philadelphia on 18 August, she arrived at her new home port, Norfolk, 3 days later.

A second shakedown cruise and training on the new weapons systems lasted into 1969. In August, &quot;Leahy&quot; took part in UNITAS X, which included ships from the navies of Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, and Uruguay. She returned to Norfolk, VA shortly before Christmas.
In September 1970, while on a routine missile exercise, &quot;Leahy&quot; was ordered to make an emergency deployment to the eastern Mediterranean as part of a contingency force in response to the Jordanian Crisis. She remained there for more than seven months operating with the &quot;Forrestal&quot; battle group, returning home to Norfolk in May 1971. For her efforts, she received the first of her five Meritorious Unit Commendations. &quot;Leahy&quot; deployed once more to the Mediterranean in 1972 and, after an overhaul at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, again in 1974. During the 1974 deployment, she operated extensively with the battle group and made port calls in France, Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey.
In 1975, &quot;Leahy&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean for a sixth time. Prior to entering the Mediterranean, she participated with the destroyer (COMCRUDESGRU 12, RADM Langille, and staff embarked) in an historic port call at Leningrad in the USSR. &quot;Leahy&quot; and &quot;Tattnall&quot; were the first U.S. warships to visit the Soviet Union since World War II. During the five-day visit, &quot;Leahy&quot; hosted over 12,300 visitors. Her crew participated in a variety of athletic contests with local teams, and enjoyed visits to a hockey game and the Kirov Ballet. She also received a visit from Elizabeth Taylor, who was on location filming &quot;The Blue Bird&quot;. &quot;Leahy&quot; then made port calls in Helsinki, Finland and Portsmouth, England before making her way into the Mediterranean. During the deployment she visited Spain, France, Monaco (for Fourth of July celebrations and Princess Grace&#x27;s Red Cross Ball), Italy, Greece, and Turkey.

USS &quot;Leahy&quot; was redesignated CG-16 (guided missile cruiser) on 30 June 1975, as part of the United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification. Her sister ships were also redesignated as guided missile cruisers.
In January 1976, &quot;Leahy&quot; was transferred to the Pacific Fleet and, after transiting the Panama Canal, entered her new home port of San Diego. On 6 June 1976, she rescued 22 crewmembers off the research vessel &quot;Aquasition&quot;, which caught fire at sea and eventually sank. On 1 November 1976, she entered drydock for an overhaul at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, which lasted a year. She did not make her first deployment to the Western Pacific until July 1978, when she served as part of the carrier battle group. She made stops at Okinawa, Yokosuka, Taiwan, Singapore, the Philippines, and South Korea before returning to the United States in February 1979.
&quot;Leahy’s&quot; next deployment to the Western Pacific began in May 1980. By September, she was in the Arabian Sea supporting the and carrier battle groups. In October, she entered the Persian Gulf to provide anti-aircraft support for Saudi Arabia against possible attacks by Iran. Her stay in the Persian Gulf was short and the &quot;Leahy&quot; returned to San Diego on 4 December. The ship began another overhaul in January 1981 that lasted into May.
&quot;Leahy&quot;&#x27;s next Western Pacific deployment began in March 1983 as part of a battle group with the newly reactivated battleship . During the cruise, she visited ports in the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. In 1984, she operated with the aircraft carrier in the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean, then deployed to the Persian Gulf in 1985. In 1986, again escorting &quot;Carl Vinson&quot;, she deployed to the Western Pacific and the Persian Gulf.
After a New Threat Upgrade modernization that lasted into 1988, &quot;Leahy&quot; returned to regular duty with the Pacific Fleet. In 1990, she served as the senior host ship for the Soviet Navy’s historic first trip to San Diego, which was also the first Russian visit to any west coast naval base. In April 1991, she arrived in the Persian Gulf shortly after the completion of Operation Desert Storm. In 1992, while serving part of the battle group, &quot;Leahy&quot; helped direct United Nations UNOSOM relief flights into Mogadishu, Somalia as part of Operation Restore Hope. In early 1993, &quot;Leahy&quot; was ordered to the northern Persian Gulf to take part in the newly authorized Operation Southern Watch, enforcing a &quot;no-fly&quot; zone in southern Iraq.
In 1993, &quot;Leahy&quot; won a Battle &quot;E&quot; for outstanding combat preparedness, as well as excellence awards in anti-aircraft warfare and anti-submarine warfare. At the time, she was the oldest conventional cruiser in the Navy’s inventory.

==Decommissioning==
&quot;Leahy&quot; was decommissioned on 1 October 1993
and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register (NVR) the same day. On 8 October 1993, she was transferred to the USDOT Maritime Administration (MARAD) and laid up as part of the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet in Benicia, CA. In 2004, she was towed by to the former Rodman Naval Station in the Canal Zone. From there she was towed by and on 21 June 2004 arrived at the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in Beaumont, Texas.

On 24 July 2004, &quot;Leahy&quot; was moved to the International Shipbreaking Limited yards in Brownsville, Texas to be dismantled. Scrapping started the first week of August 2004, 42 years after her 4 August 1962 commissioning. Three of her sisters, , and , passed this way before her. Scrapping was completed 6 July 2005, 44 years after her 1 July 1961 launch date.

In October 2013, the ship&#x27;s bell, builder&#x27;s plaque and other items were placed on long-term loan from the Naval History &amp; Heritage Command to the Franklin County Historical Society Museum in Hampton, Iowa for an exhibit on native son William D. Leahy. In addition, the 1/48 scale model previously displayed at the Surface Warfare Officer&#x27;s School in Newport, Rhode Island was loaned for the same exhibit.

==Awards and commendations==
Unit awards from Navy unit awards database.
==Deployments and overhauls==
Summary of all 16 major deployments and 5 yard overhauls.
Note: Cruise books were published for all major deployments except 1972 and 1975. A &quot;Leahy Pictogram&quot; was published in August 1972 with deployment details and photographs of officers and crew.

==Plank owners==
The 4 August 1962 commissioning crewmembers were the original 363 plank owners. The 1962 commissioning ceremony booklet lists 21 officers, 24 chief petty officers, 39 first class petty officers, 50 second class petty officers, 96 third class petty officers, 87 seamen and 46 firemen. Because &quot;Leahy&quot; was decommissioned on 18 February 1967 for a major overhaul and then recommissioned on 4 May 1968, a second group of plank owners was created. The 1968 commissioning ceremony booklet lists these additional 370 plank owners.

==Ship&#x27;s seal and motto==

The ship&#x27;s seal shows twin crossed missiles representing &quot;Leahy&quot;″s status as the lead ship of the &quot;double-ender&quot; class of guided missile cruisers. The five stars represent her namesake Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy.

&quot;Leahy&quot;″s motto &quot;Prompta et Parata&quot; translates as &quot;Prompt and Ready&quot; from the Latin.
The words are most well known from Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De Officiis&quot; as part of the phrase &quot;... the good will of men, on the other hand, &quot;prompt and ready&quot; for the advancement of our interests, is secured through wisdom and virtue.&quot;
