<text>The title of Duke of Montagu has been created twice, firstly for the Montagu family of Boughton, Northamptonshire, and secondly for the Brudenell family, Earls of Cardigan. It was first created in the Peerage of England in 1705 for Ralph Montagu, 3rd Baron Montagu of Boughton, with the subsidiary title &quot;Marquess of Monthermer,&quot; but became extinct in 1749. The 1st Duke had been created &quot;Earl of Montagu&quot; and &quot;Viscount Monthermer&quot; in 1689. The Dukedom was then recreated in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1766 (together with the subsidiary title &quot;Marquess of Monthermer&quot;) for the late Duke&#x27;s son-in-law George Brudenell, 4th Earl of Cardigan, who adopted the surname of Montagu. On his death in 1790 the dukedom and marquessate became extinct a second time, but the earldom passed to his brother, James Brudenell, 5th Earl of Cardigan.

The dukedom is named after the Montagu family &quot;of Boughton&quot; in Northamptonshire, where the 1st Duke built the splendid and surviving Boughton House, which claimed descent from the ancient Anglo-Norman family of Montagu, Earls of Salisbury, which connection is however unproven. The earliest proven ancestor of the Montagu family of Boughton is Thomas Montagu (d.1516) of Hemington, Northamptonshire, the son of Richard Ladde (d.1484), &quot;alias Montagu&quot;, of Hanging Houghton in Northamptonshire, whose family of Ladde is recorded in the deeds of that place from 1355. Richard Ladde &quot;alias Montagu&quot; was the father of Sir Edward Montagu, Lord Chief Justice (great-great grandfather of the 1st Duke), who purchased the estate of Boughton in 1528. It is suggested by the Complete Peerage that the Ladde family adopted the surname of Montagu due to &quot;having to deal with some Montagu inheritance&quot;, i.e. dictated by the terms of a bequest from a member of that family, as was common practice, requiring the legatee to adopt the surname and arms of the legator, where a branch of a family had died out in the male line. Collins Peerage suggests that the Montagu family of Boughton was descended from James &quot;Montagu&quot;, a natural son of Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury (1388-1428), the maternal grandfather of &quot;Warwick the King-Maker&quot;, 16th Earl of Warwick, 6th Earl of Salisbury. The Montagu family of Boughton and its descendants use the coat of arms of Montagu, Earls of Salisbury, but differenced by a &quot;bordure sable&quot;, and quarters the arms of Monthermer, as did the Earls of Salisbury, but undifferenced.

Sir Edward Montagu of Boughton, Lord Chief Justice, was the ancestor of Montagu, Duke of Montagu, Montagu, Earls and Dukes of Manchester, Montagu, Earls of Sandwich and Montagu, Earls of Halifax.

<text>James Henry Breasted (; August 27, 1865 – December 2, 1935) was an American archaeologist, Egyptologist, and historian. After completing his PhD at the University of Berlin in 1894 – the first American to obtain a doctorate in Egyptology – he joined the faculty of the University of Chicago. In 1901 he became director of the Haskell Oriental Museum at the university, where he continued to concentrate on Egypt. In 1905 Breasted was promoted to full professor, and held the first chair in Egyptology and Oriental History in the United States.

Breasted was a committed field researcher in Egypt and the Levant and had a productive interest in recording and interpreting ancient writings, especially from sources and structures that he feared may be lost forever. In 1919 he founded the Oriental Institute (later known as, the Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures) at the University of Chicago, a center for interdisciplinary study of ancient civilizations. That same year, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

==Early life and education==
James Henry Breasted was born on August 27, 1865, the son of a small hardware business owner and his wife, in Rockford, Illinois. His ancestors went back to early colonial Dutch and English, with the family name Van Breestede. He was educated at local public schools before attending North Central College (then North-Western College). He graduated from there in 1888, and attended Chicago Theological Seminary, but transferred to Yale University to study Hebrew. He studied with William Rainey Harper, who had great influence on the teaching of the language. He received a master&#x27;s degree from Yale in 1891. His mentor Harper had just accepted the presidency of the University of Chicago and encouraged Breasted to study at the University of Berlin for his doctorate, and then to join him in Chicago. Breasted studied the Egyptian language under the instruction of Adolf Erman. Erman had just established a new school of Egyptology, concentrating systematically on grammar and lexicography. Breasted received his doctorate in 1894, producing an edition of the sun hymns of El &#x27;Amǎrneh period for his thesis. He was the first American citizen to obtain a PhD in Egyptology.

==Marriage and family==
In 1894 Breasted married Frances Hart. Hart and her sisters were in Germany at the same time as Breasted, where they were learning the German language and studying music. The couple honeymooned in Egypt. It was a working vacation, as Breasted had been recruited to build a collection of Egyptian antiquities for the University of Chicago.

Frances Hart Breasted died in 1934 after 40 years of marriage. After the death of his wife, Breasted married one of her sisters.

==Academic career==

Breasted popularized the term &quot;Fertile Crescent&quot; to describe the archaeologically important area including parts of present-day Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine and Israel.

Breasted became an instructor at the University of Chicago in 1894 soon after earning his doctorate. Five years later the university agreed to his accepting an invitation from the Prussian Academy of Sciences to work on its Egyptian dictionary project. From 1899 to 1908 he did fieldwork in Egypt, which established his reputation. He began to publish numerous articles and monographs, as well as his &quot;History of Egypt from the Earliest Times Down to the Persian Conquest&quot; in 1905. At that time he was promoted to Professor of Egyptology and Oriental History for Chicago (the first such chair in the United States).

In 1901 Breasted was appointed director of the Haskell Oriental Museum (forerunner of the Oriental Institute), which had opened at the University of Chicago in 1896. Though the museum contained works of art from both the Near East and the Far East, Breasted&#x27;s principal interest was in Egypt. He began to work on a compilation of all the extant hieroglyphic inscriptions, which was published in 1906 as &quot;Ancient Records of Egypt,&quot; and continues to be an important collection of translated texts. As Peter A. Piccione wrote in the preface to its 2001 reprint, it &quot;still contains certain texts and inscriptions that have not been retranslated since that time.&quot;

Through the years, as Breasted built up the collection of the Haskell Oriental Museum, he dreamed of establishing a research institute, &quot;a laboratory for the study of the rise and development of civilization&quot;, that would trace Western civilization to its roots in the ancient Middle East. As World War I wound down, he sensed an opportunity. He wrote to John D. Rockefeller Jr., son of the major donor to the university, and proposed founding what would become the Oriental Institute. He planned a research trip through the Middle East, which he suggested was ready to receive scholars. Rockefeller responded by pledging $50,000 over five years for the Oriental Institute. He separately assured the University of Chicago President Judson to pledge another $50,000 to the cause. The University of Chicago contributed additional support and, in May 1919, the Oriental Institute was founded.

Breasted had two key objectives for the field trip: to purchase antiquities for the Oriental Institute and to select sites for future excavation. The research group consisted of Breasted and four of his students (or former students): Ludlow Bull, William Edgerton (both graduate students in Egyptology); Daniel Luckenbill (professor of Assyriology at the University of Chicago), and William Shelton (a former student who was a professor of Semitic languages at Emory University).

The general itinerary of the expedition was:
* August 1919: from Chicago to England, sailing by way of New York and France
* September 1919: England 
* October 1919: from England to Cairo, by way of Paris, Venice, and Alexandria
* November 1919: Egypt
* December 1919: Egypt
* January 1920: Egypt
* February 1920: from Egypt to Bombay
* March 1920: Bombay to Basra, Mesopotamia
* April 1920: Mesopotamia
* May 1920: from Mesopotamia to Arab State (today Syria) and Beirut
* June 1920: from Damascus to Jerusalem, Haifa, Cairo, and London
* July 1920: to Chicago

As Breasted scouted future archaeological sites and visited antiquities dealers, he came to know many of the British political figures and scholars working in Egypt. These included Gertrude Bell, Howard Carter, Lord Carnarvon, Lord Allenby, and the Arab leader Faisal, who would become king of Iraq. Due to Breasted&#x27;s extensive travels and knowledge of the political situation throughout the Middle East, Lord Allenby, at that time the High Commissioner for Egypt, requested that he inform the British Prime Minister and Earl Curzon about the hostility of the western Arabs to the occupying British forces before returning to the United States.

Breasted&#x27;s acquisitions were significant for the growth and scope of the collections of the Oriental Institute and the Art Institute of Chicago. One of his best-known purchases was the mummy of Meresamun, a singer in the interior of the Temple of Amun at Karnak.

The first excavation conducted by the Oriental Institute was in Egypt at Medinet Habu, one of the sites he had recommended. Breasted returned to Egypt frequently; between 1922 and 1927 he supported Howard Carter&#x27;s excavation of Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb. He applied his expertise in deciphering seals, and was present during the dismantling of the shrine that contained the King&#x27;s sarcophagus. He also acted as mediator between Carter and the Egyptian authorities during the dispute that halted the excavation in 1924–25. He was often accompanied to Egypt by his son Charles who, under an assumed name, wrote first-hand reports on the Tutankhamun excavation for the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; and &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;.

Breasted also collaborated with his University of Chicago colleague Carl F. Huth, Jr. on a very well-received series of historical maps that was published by the Denoyer-Geppert Co. (1916), which were sold both individually and eventually expanded and published in a series of atlases, including (with Huth and Samuel B. Harding) &quot;European History Atlas: Ancient, Medieval and Modern European and World History Adapted from the Large Wall Maps&quot;, 3rd rev. ed. (1929), which was published in its eleventh revised edition in 1967.

On April 25, 1923, Breasted became the first archaeologist to be elected to membership in the National Academy of Sciences. The honor helped to legitimize the struggling profession of archaeology in American academic circles. He served as the president of the History of Science Society in 1926.

Breasted died in New York City on December 2, 1935, of a streptococcus infection after returning from his last expedition.

While at Chicago, Breasted had a home built near the university. Its carriage house was designed to look like a &quot;mastaba&quot;. The house is now used as the fraternity house of Phi Gamma Delta.

Breasted is buried in Greenwood Cemetery, in Rockford, Illinois. His grave site is marked with a large Aswan granite cube, marked simply with his name and &quot;historian and archaeologist.&quot;

The &quot;James Henry Breasted Prize&quot; was established in 1985 in his honor by the American Historical Association. It is awarded annually to a book in English that covers any period of history prior to 1000 AD.

==&quot;Dawn of Conscience&quot;==
Breasted&#x27;s book &quot;Dawn of Conscience&quot; (1933) was a major influence on Sigmund Freud, who completed his &quot;Moses and Monotheism&quot; in London in 1938.

<text>Egil Roger Olsen (born 22 April 1942), nicknamed Drillo, is a Norwegian former football manager and player. He is best known as a highly successful manager of the Norway national team. He later was manager of the Iraq national team, his departure from which caused considerable attention. In January 2009, he made a comeback as manager for the Norway national team.

==Club career==
Olsen was a successful player with 16 caps for the national team, earning the nickname &quot;Drillo&quot; from his dribbling skills and technical ability. According to close friend Nils Arne Eggen, Olsen would have been awarded with more caps as a player, had it not been for Willi Kment, Norway&#x27;s manager at the time, who did not approve of Olsen&#x27;s long hair and generally scruffy appearance, as well as his left-wing political views. Olsen was also a formidable bandy player, while playing football.

==Managerial career==

He managed the Norway national team from 1990 to 1998, guiding them to World Cup final tournaments in 1994 and 1998, with Norway peaking at number two on the FIFA ranking. He worked from 2005 to 2007 as an analyst for Vålerengens IF before joining Expekt.com.

In 1995, as Norway manager Egil Olsen used one of his three votes to nominate Norway women&#x27;s football star Hege Riise as the FIFA World Player of the Year. The first time a woman player had been nominated in what is seen as a men&#x27;s football award.

In June 1999, the then 57-year-old Olsen made his appearance in English football, when he was named as manager of Wimbledon. He reportedly turned down an approach from Celtic to take charge of the London club, becoming the first Norwegian to manage in the Premier League. Olsen has stated that his favorite player at the club was Welsh international Ben Thatcher. He remained in charge for less than a year, and was sacked just before the club was relegated from the Premier League, having been top division members since 1986. Club captain Robbie Earle said that &quot;Olsen just didn&#x27;t know how to get the best out of us&quot;.

On 19 May 2007, Olsen rejected an offer to manage the Iraq national team citing a busy schedule.
However, the Iraqi football president vowed not to give up on his signature and on 17 September, Olsen signed a three-year contract. In February 2008, Iraq sacked Olsen without telling him. He had tried to contact them by several means, but received the message when a new manager was installed, this action on the Iraqis part was very unexpected and their reason was said to be that they did not believe Olsen was strict enough.

On 14 January 2009, it was announced that Olsen would once again manage the Norway national team in an interim period until a successor for Åge Hareide could be found.

In their first game under his management, they beat Germany 1–0 in a friendly away game in Düsseldorf. It is the first time Norway has won against Germany, since the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.

With Olsen as manager Norway rose from No. 59 in 2009 to No. 11 in 2011 on the FIFA rankings.

On 27 September 2013, Olsen agreed to stand down as coach following the World Cup qualifying at home defeat to Switzerland.

==Football philosophy==
Olsen has at times been referred to as a &quot;football professor&quot; for his scientific approach to the game, an early user of video analysis of matches. He has collected statistical data to find out which playing styles are the most efficient. As Norway manager, he argued that as Norway didn&#x27;t have the players to beat the best teams, they needed a smarter playing style than them, and one that fit Norway&#x27;s skills.

He found that breakaways played an important role to making goals, and that quick counter-attacks caught opponents off guard to organize defense. Olsen believes that getting the ball down the field through the air to the attackers or flank players gave less chance for losing control. His use of a player with good heading abilities as a target man on the flank, such as Jostein Flo, was a major break with the established idea that all flank players should be small, quick and good dribblers.

He is opposed to stationary offensive players, and argues that offensive runs (also for players that do not possess the ball) should be carried out as often as possible when one&#x27;s team has the ball, as multiple simultaneous runs are very difficult to defend against. He also holds the idea that breakthrough passes to the area behind the opponent&#x27;s defensive line should be sought out very often, and that frequent offensive runs towards this area is important. He also coined the phrase &quot;å være best uten ball&quot; (roughly &quot;to be best at off-the-ball running&quot;, lit. &quot;to be best without the ball&quot;) which gained some fame in Norway. It was originally said about Øyvind Leonhardsen, a player doing an exceptional number of runs during games.

Olsen is also an ardent supporter of zone defense, as opposed to man-to-man marking. He also argues that players with extreme skills (extremely fast, extremely good headers, extremely good dribblers, extremely good passers etc.), as opposed to players with only good all-round skills, are important in football.

His long-ball philosophy, use of the 4–5–1 system and his teams&#x27; often extremely successful defending was considered extremely boring by some, but Olsen&#x27;s direct attacking style would also be praised whenever it was successful - notably in Norway&#x27;s wins against Brazil in 1997 and 1998.

His thoughts, together with those of Nils Arne Eggen, have had a strong impact on Norwegian football.

==Personal life==
Olsen was a member of the Norwegian Workers&#x27; Communist Party (known as AKP (m-l)). He is also known for his immense knowledge of geographical trivia, proven by his 2002 published factbook &quot;Drillos Verden&quot; (English: &quot;Drillo&#x27;s World&quot;) published by Erling Kagge&#x27;s publishing house Kagge Forlag ( Norway).

<doc id="572605" wikidata="Q2142" url="?curid=572605" title="Goku">
<text>Son Goku is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga series created by Akira Toriyama. He is based on Sun Wukong (known as &quot;Son Gokū&quot; in Japan and the Monkey King in the West), a main character of the classic 16th-century Chinese novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, combined with influences from the Hong Kong action cinema of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee. Goku made his debut in the first &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; chapter, &quot;Bulma and Son Goku&quot;, originally published in Japan&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; magazine on December 3, 1984. 

Goku is introduced as an eccentric, monkey-tailed boy who practices martial arts and possesses superhuman strength. He meets Bulma and joins her on a journey to find the seven wish-granting Dragon Balls. Along the way, he finds new friends who follow him on his journey to become stronger. As Goku grows up, he becomes the Earth&#x27;s mightiest warrior and battles a wide variety of villains with the help of his friends and family, while also gaining new allies in the process.

Born under the name Kakarot, as a member of the Saiyan race on Planet Vegeta, he is sent to Earth as an infant prior to his homeworld&#x27;s destruction at the hands of Frieza. Upon his arrival on Earth, the infant is discovered by Son Gohan, who becomes the adoptive grandfather of the boy and gives him the name Goku. The boy is initially full of violence and aggression due to his Saiyan nature, until an accidental head injury turns him into a cheerful, carefree person. Grandpa Gohan&#x27;s kindness and teachings help to further influence Goku, who later on names his first son Gohan in honor of him.

As the protagonist of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, Goku appears in most of the episodes, films, television specials and OVAs of the manga&#x27;s anime adaptations (&quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;) and sequels (&quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;), as well as many of the franchise&#x27;s video games. Due to the series&#x27; international popularity, Goku became one of the most recognizable and iconic manga/anime characters worldwide. Outside the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; franchise, Goku has made cameo appearances in Toriyama&#x27;s self-parody series &quot;Neko Majin Z&quot;, has been the subject of other parodies, and has appeared in special events. Most Western audiences were introduced to the adult version of Goku featured in the &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; anime, which adapted the final 26 &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga volumes, as opposed to his initial appearance as a child due to the limited success of the first anime series overseas.

==Conception and creation==

Goku, and &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; in general, evolved from one of Akira Toriyama&#x27;s earlier one-shot series called &quot;Dragon Boy&quot;. In this story, the protagonist looks similar to Goku, but has a pair of wings. The original inspiration were Hong Kong action cinema, including those by Bruce Lee such as &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (1973) and by Jackie Chan such as &quot;Drunken Master&quot; (1978); Toriyama said he had a young Chan in mind for a live-action Goku, stating that &quot;nobody could play Goku but him.&quot; Goku uses a variety and hybrid of East Asian martial arts styles, including Karate and Wing Chun (Kung fu).

Bulma and Goku were the first pair of characters which were introduced in the manga and Toriyama stated that he subsequently introduced other characters in pairs because &quot;that way, I&#x27;m able to explain the characters and their relationship to each other through their interactions. In my case, I feel that it isn&#x27;t good to insert too much narration. I suppose Goku and Bulma are representative of that.&quot; He further added that &quot;as a child, Goku doesn&#x27;t know anything [of the world], so without Bulma, he&#x27;d be a character who didn&#x27;t say anything.&quot; Toriyama mentioned Torishima wanted Goku to form a relationship with Bulma, but this was never applied to the series. With the conclusion of the Cell arc, Gohan was intended to replace his father as the protagonist, but Toriyama later decided that Gohan was unsuitable for the role. According to Toriyama, Goku is more of a selfish person than a hero as his main interest in the story is to fight strong opponents rather than protecting the innocent. As a result, Toriyama was angered when the anime adaptations of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; started portraying Goku as more heroic than his manga counterpart. Toei kept protraying Goku as heroic figure, especially in the anime sequel &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; where he often rescues his granddaughter Pan as producer Kōzō Morishita was influenced by the 1997 film &quot;Titanic&quot;.

===Design===
The character Goku is based on Sun Wukong (Son Goku in Japanese), the central character of the Chinese novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. To be creative with the idea of Sun Wukong, Toriyama designed Goku as a human boy with a monkey&#x27;s tail, rather than a complete simian, because the tail would give the character a distinguishing feature. He later stated that the tail was a pain to draw, hence why he had it get cut off early on. Toriyama did not initially plan to make Goku an alien, it was not until the introduction of fighters from other planets that he established him as a Saiyan. Goku was given the ability to teleport to any planet in seconds, so that Toriyama could increase the pace of the story.

Wanting the series to have a Chinese appearance, Toriyama used the color of the robes worn by Buddhist monks for Goku&#x27;s &quot;dōgi&quot;. During the early chapters of the manga, Toriyama&#x27;s editor Kazuhiko Torishima commented that Goku looked rather plain. Toriyama had given him simple clothes on purpose because it was a fighting manga, so to combat this he added several characters like Master Roshi and Krillin, and created the &quot;Tenkaichi Budōkai&quot; to focus the storyline on fighting. To defy the assumption that Goku would win the tournaments, Toriyama made him lose the first and second but win the third.

Toriyama&#x27;s editor was initially against having Goku grow up, saying it was uncommon to have the protagonist drastically change in manga, however, he gave in when Toriyama threatened that he would not be able to continue the series if the character did not. Toriyama later stated he had him grow up as a means to make drawing the fight scenes easier.

When Toriyama thought up the Super Saiyan concept during the Frieza arc, he felt the only way to show Goku&#x27;s massive power-up was to have him transform. Initially he was concerned that the facial expression looked like that of a villain, but felt it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger. The Super Saiyan form spared the trouble of coloring Goku&#x27;s hair all the time for the standard black-and-white manga pages. This was the reason for the Super Saiyan form having blonde hair, because it was easier to draw for Toriyama&#x27;s assistant who spent a lot of time blacking in Goku&#x27;s hair. Goku&#x27;s piercing eyes in Super Saiyan form were inspired by Bruce Lee&#x27;s paralyzing glare. For the &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; anime adaptation, character designer Tadayoshi Yamamuro used Lee as a reference, stating that, when he &quot;first becomes a Super Saiyan, his slanting pose with that scowling look in his eyes is all Bruce Lee.&quot;

&quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; chief character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru said he agonized over designing Goku&#x27;s Super Saiyan 4 appearance, which was the idea of the show&#x27;s producers, questioning whether it was necessary to go further with the transformations. Because Super Saiyan 4 is brought about while in a Saiyan&#x27;s &quot;Ōzaru&quot; form, he made the hair more &quot;wild&quot; and covered Goku&#x27;s body in red fur. There was only a single final draft of the character, although Nakatsuru did consider making the hair blonde, he ended up choosing black as it provides more contrast with the red fur.

During the plans of the final story arc of &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;, it was decided that Goku should have another transformation: The Ultra Instinct. The concept was that the Ultra Instinct would be completely different from Goku&#x27;s previous Super Saiyan transformations.

===Voice actors===

In the Japanese version of every &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; anime series and subsequent related media, Goku has been voiced by Masako Nozawa. Toriyama selected Nozawa upon hearing her audition sample, remarking that only Goku could sound like that. Nozawa stated that she was ecstatic when she got the role because she had always wanted to be in one of Toriyama&#x27;s works. She said she had to be mindful of the fact that Goku grew up in the mountains and did not know much of the world. Despite having to voice Goku, Gohan, Goten and Bardock, Nozawa says she is able to instantly get into the respective character upon seeing their image.

Nozawa explained that she did not read the manga so that she would not know what was coming in the story until recording, making her reactions the same as Goku&#x27;s. Nozawa said that she liked young Goku with his tail because he was cute, and stated that the character was still the same even at the end of the series.

In the numerous English versions, Goku has been played by different actors because different companies produced the dubs, by reason of changes of automated dialogue replacement companies and recording studios, or due to actors quitting:

*In Harmony Gold&#x27;s very brief dub of the original &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series, Goku was voiced by Barbara Goodson.
*In Funimation&#x27;s initial dub of the anime, Goku was voiced by Saffron Henderson in the first 13 episodes of the original &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series (produced in association with BLT Productions), and by Ian James Corlett and Peter Kelamis in the first 67 episodes of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; (edited into 53 episodes, produced in association with Saban and Ocean Productions).
*In Funimation&#x27;s in-house dub, Goku was voiced by Stephanie Nadolny as a child in &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;, and &quot;Dragon Ball Daima&quot;, and has been consistently voiced by Sean Schemmel as an adult throughout the entire &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; franchise.

==Appearances==
===In &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;===

Goku first appears in &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; as a monkey-tailed child adopted by the hermit martial artist Gohan. Before the series&#x27; narrative begins, he accidentally and unknowingly kills Gohan when he temporarily transforms into the mighty &quot;Ōzaru&quot; after staring at a full moon. Goku loses the ability when his friends cut off his tail.

Living alone with an item known as a Dragon Ball which he keeps as a memento of Gohan, Goku befriends a teenage girl named Bulma. He joins her to find the seven Dragon Balls, which, when gathered, summon the wish-granting dragon Shenron. They encounter the desert bandit Yamcha and two shapeshifters named Oolong and Puar, who join their quest. Goku is later trained by the martial artist Master Roshi, alongside a monk named Krillin, who later becomes his best friend. It is Roshi who gives Goku the magic cloud &quot;Kinto&#x27;un&quot;, as a reward for saving his pet sea turtle, which becomes Goku&#x27;s primary source of flight travel across the world.

Goku&#x27;s first shown martial arts attack as a child is &quot;Jan ken&quot;, three physical blows modeled after the hand signs in rock-paper-scissors. As a child, he wields the &quot;Nyoi-bō&quot;, a magic staff that extends and retracts on command, given to him by his grandfather.

Goku&#x27;s signature attack is the &quot;Kamehameha&quot; (named after King Kamehameha I of Hawai&#x27;i), which he learned from Roshi. The &quot;Kamehameha&quot; is a concentration of energy, released as a concussive beam. Roshi spent about 50 years developing and perfecting the technique, but, as a child, Goku is able to understand and copy the technique immediately after only one demonstration. After training with the Earth&#x27;s Guardian, Kami, Goku learns to fly by virtue of the technique &quot;Bukū-jutsu&quot; and uses the Nimbus cloud less frequently for flight travel.

While participating in the World Martial Arts Tournament that attracts the most powerful fighters in the world, Goku battles foes, later turned allies, such as Tien Shinhan and Chiaotzu, as well as the Namekian Piccolo. After becoming the runner-up champion of the 21st and 22nd tournaments, Goku wins in the 23rd with Piccolo&#x27;s defeat, and marries Chi-Chi soon after to fulfill a promise he made to her years ago despite not knowing what marriage was.
Five years later, Goku meets his evil older brother Raditz and learns about his heritage. Goku comes from a race of nearly extinct extraterrestrials called Saiyans, himself having been sent from their home planet to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life (at least according to Raditz, who was absent at the time of his planet&#x27;s destruction, when Goku was sent to Earth as an infant by Bardock and Gine to protect their son from Frieza). While Grandpa Gohan was taking care of him, Goku accidentally fell into a deep ravine and suffered a severe head injury, which caused him to forget his mission and drastically altered his personality.

After Raditz kidnaps Goku&#x27;s son Gohan, he forms a truce with Piccolo in order to defeat Raditz. After sacrificing his life during the battle, Goku trains with King Kai in the Other World. He teaches Goku the &quot;Kaiō-ken&quot;, which multiplies his energy and strength but with possible strain to the body. It is from King Kai that Goku learns his most powerful attack: the &quot;Genki-Dama&quot;, an energy sphere created by gathering energy from surrounding animals, nature and humans.

After being revived by the Dragon Balls, Goku faces off with the Saiyan prince Vegeta, who eventually becomes his greatest rival and another ally. On his journey to Planet Namek in order to aid his friends in gathering the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive those killed by the Saiyans, Goku fights the galactic tyrant Frieza, who destroyed the Saiyans&#x27; home planet and nearly the entire race. During his epic battle with Frieza, Goku becomes the first Saiyan in a thousand years to transform into a fabled Super Saiyan.

After defeating Frieza and escaping the destruction of Namek, Goku learns a teleportation skill called &quot;Shunkan Idō&quot;, taught by the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat. Goku contracts a heart virus whereof the time-traveler Trunks warns him, but recovers after taking medicine provided by Trunks. Goku trains Gohan to be his successor and sacrifices himself again during the battle against the evil bio-android Cell. Goku is temporarily resurrected on Earth seven years later and meets his second son Goten.

Goku battles Vegeta again after Vegeta willingly falls under the control of the wizard Babidi in order to gain power. Shortly after, he is drawn into a battle for the universe against the monster Majin Buu. Despite having mastered two new Super Saiyan transformations, Goku prepares Goten and Trunks to take his place as Earth&#x27;s defender. After his life is fully restored, Goku attempts to fuse with Gohan in order to defeat Buu, but this fails when the latter is temporarily absorbed by Buu and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito. Later when the Fusion technique is abandoned on both sides, Goku destroys Buu with a Spirit Bomb attack. Ten years later, during another World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku meets Uub, Buu&#x27;s human reincarnation, and leaves with him, intending to train him as the new protector of Earth.

===In &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;===
After defeating Majin Buu, Goku meets a new opponent known as Beerus, the God of Destruction in the film &quot;Battle of Gods&quot;. An alternative, more innately powerful form known as the Super Saiyan God is reached by Goku during this film. Though the temporary transformation wears off, Goku manages to harness its godly powers. In its sequel film &quot;Resurrection &#x27;F&#x27;&quot;, Goku manages to achieve a blue-haired evolution of Super Saiyan God under Whis&#x27;s tutelage, known as the Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan, or &quot;Super Saiyan Blue&quot; for short, which Goku uses to battle the newly revived Frieza. These forms appear in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; and its manga tie-in, which expand upon the stories from the two films.

Afterwards, Goku and his friends participate in a fighting tournament set between Beerus and his brother Champa, who is Universe 6&#x27;s God of Destruction, facing the best warriors from Champa&#x27;s universe. During this tournament, Goku reveals that he has learned to combine the perfect energy control of his Super Saiyan Blue form with his older technique, the &quot;Kaiō-ken&quot;. After meeting with the omnipotent being known as Grand Zeno, Goku encounters an evil alternate version of himself called &quot;Goku Black&quot;, who is terrorizing Future Trunks&#x27; timeline. Black is eventually revealed to be a rogue Supreme Kai in training named Zamasu, who has stolen Goku&#x27;s body from yet another alternate timeline and teamed up with the Zamasu of Future Trunks&#x27; timeline to fulfill their &quot;Zero Mortals Plan&quot;. After Zamasu and Black become even more dangerous by undergoing Potara Fusion during the battle in Future Trunks&#x27; timeline, Goku ultimately summons the future version of Grand Zeno who erases Zamasu.

Goku causes the Zenos to decide to hold a multi-universal martial arts tournament with the losing universes wiped from existence; the Tournament of Power. Throughout the tournament, Goku faces multiple opponents but finds his toughest in Jiren. It is during his fights with Jiren that Goku acquires a temporary transformed state using a divine technique known as &quot;Migatte no Goku&#x27;i&quot;. Ultimately, Goku and Frieza manage to work together to force Jiren out of bounds in a triple elimination, leaving Android 17 as the winner who uses his wish on the Super Dragon Balls to restore the erased universes.

Goku&#x27;s origin story from the &quot;Dragon Ball Minus&quot; manga chapter is retold in the film &quot;Dragon Ball Super: Broly&quot;. His birth parents are Bardock, a low-class Saiyan mercenary, and Gine, the owner of a butcher shop. Bardock has a strong suspicion that Frieza is up to something when he receives an order on his scouter for all Saiyans to return home, so he convinces Gine to send their infant son in a space pod to Earth. In the present, following the events of the Tournament of Power, Goku and Vegeta encounter another Saiyan survivor named Broly, whom Frieza has recruited to defeat them. When Broly proves to be too powerful for either of them to handle individually, Goku and Vegeta use the Metamoran Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta. Gogeta almost defeats his opponent, but Broly&#x27;s allies teleport him back to the barren planet he grew up on. Goku teleports to this planet as well to provide Broly and his two friends with survival supplies, hoping to be able to spar with Broly again someday.

In the manga, directly after the final scene of &quot;Broly&quot;, Goku and Vegeta meet Galactic Patrol by Jaco and a mysteriously highly skilled agent named Merus in order to help stop an ancient warlock called Moro. With Moro headed to New Namek to use the Namekian Dragon Balls, the two Saiyans travel to the planet to stop him, where they are defeated by him using his magic to drain their life essences until near death. Once recovered, they attempt to go after Moro again, but he escapes from them, Merus and (the also conscripted) Majin Buu with the help of his accomplice Cranberry (who he kills) in order to wish upon the Dragon Balls to free all the Galactic Prison prisoners. After a few days, Goku hears from Merus that Moro has grown even stronger and is unstoppable. This leads to Goku asking Merus to help train him to master the &quot;Ultra Instinct&quot; technique so he can defeat Moro. Goku helps his friends take out Moro&#x27;s forces before he comes face-to-face with Moro again. When Moro fuses with Seven-Three, he and his allies are soundly defeated and mortally wounded. Goku achieves the full power of &quot;Ultra Instinct&quot; once more, which he uses to debilitate Moro to near-death. Even after healing him with a Senzu bean, he is unfazed by his ensuing sneak attack, unsuccessfully attempting to convince him to reconsider his ways and go back to prison, and him using a stray severed arm with Merus&#x27;s copied power to obtain &quot;Ultra Instinct&quot; for himself, Goku continuously outmatches Moro. Ultimately, with the help of his friends and family, along with key assistance from Buu/Grand Supreme Kai and Uub unknowingly contributing divine power, Goku manages to finish off Moro and save the Earth once more. He, Vegeta, Buu and Jaco then reunite with a now-mortal Merus to be honoured as heroes by the Galactic Patrol.

Much later, Goku and Vegeta are contacted by a group of beings called the Heeters, on a seemingly imperative mission to defeat a surviving member of the now-extinct sharpshooting Cerealean race; Granolah. Blinded by his desire for revenge, Granolah confronts Goku and defeats him, as Goku&#x27;s &quot;Ultra Instinct&quot; turns out to be taxing to his body and loses its accuracy as he keeps fighting. The fight is later revealed to be a ruse by the Heeters to eliminate Granolah and the Saiyans from the Heeters&#x27; plot to assassinate Frieza and achieve universal conquest. He is later rescued by the last Namekian on the planet Cereal, Monaito, who hides them in his home after a disastrous battle with the Heeter warrior Gas, who wishes absolute power using the planet&#x27;s Dragon Balls. Monaito reveals the identity of his father, Bardock, and the story of his actions in keeping him and the young Granolah safe from the Heeters a long time ago. Moved by the story, Goku and Vegeta finally find resolve about the meaning of the Saiyan race&#x27;s pride, and later confront Gas for a second round. Goku stalls him by teleporting across random locations within the cosmos via &quot;Shunkan Idō&quot; with Gas tailing him, in an effort to give Granolah time to regain his power. Remembering Whis&#x27; advice about finding one&#x27;s true and personal &quot;Ultra Instinct&quot;, Goku later molds his own version of the technique, using his emotions as freely as he pleases. Despite this, he and Vegeta are ultimately bested, even after Granolah inflicted his deadliest sniping shot towards the villain with Goku&#x27;s assistance, but are saved by Frieza&#x27;s unexpected arrival. Frieza kills Gas and Elec, the Heeter leader and mastermind of the coup, in swift succession, before unveiling a new transformation and demonstrating his new powers by knocking Goku and Vegeta out of their empowered forms in one quick strike. He spares the duo before making his leave.

In the film &quot;Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero&quot;, Goku does not play the role of protagonist, as he and Vegeta train on Beerus&#x27; domain, accompanied by newcomer Broly, and his companions from the previous film. He spars with Vegeta without any transformations or &quot;ki&quot; techniques except for flight. Back on Earth, Piccolo is forced to deal with the reinvigorated Red Ribbon Army with Gohan as his only best defense for Earth against the army&#x27;s threat, as Bulma is unable to contact Goku and Vegeta because Beerus&#x27; ice cream container accidentally obstructed Whis&#x27; angelic staff. In the post-credits scene, tired and exhausted, Goku falls down from Vegeta&#x27;s weak last punch, admitting defeat as his rival celebrates his triumph.

===In other media===
In the anime-only sequel series &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;, Goku is transformed back into a child by an accidental wish made by his old enemy Pilaf using the Black Star Dragon Balls while Pilaf was about to wish to take over the world. Goku, Trunks and his own granddaughter Pan travel the universe to search for the Black Star Dragon Balls and return them to Earth to prevent its destruction. After acquiring the Super Saiyan 4 transformation, Goku battles the evil Tuffle Baby, Super Android 17, and the evil Shadow Dragons. His final challenge is against Omega Shenron, whom he destroys using the Spirit Bomb. Goku leaves with the original form of Shenron, but not before saying his goodbyes to his friends on Earth. He appears 100 years later at the next World Martial Arts Tournament as an adult, where he watches a battle between Goku Jr., his descendant, and Vegeta Jr., Vegeta&#x27;s descendant. An elderly Pan sees him, but he quickly departs.

Goku has appeared in various other media including an unofficial Taiwanese live-action film and an unofficial Korean live-action film. He was portrayed by Justin Chatwin in the 2009 20th Century Fox feature &quot;Dragonball Evolution&quot;. Goku has appeared in almost every &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; licensed video game, including crossover games such as &quot;Jump Super Stars&quot;, &quot;Jump Ultimate Stars&quot; and &quot;Battle Stadium D.O.N&quot;. In 1992, Goku was featured in the interactive game &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Get Together! Goku World&quot;, in which Goku and his gang travel back in time to review events in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; timeline and interacts with his younger self. In December 2007, Goku made a guest appearance in avatar form in the MMORPG &quot;Second Life&quot; for a &quot;Jump Festa&quot; promotion titled &quot;Jumpland@Second Life&quot;. Goku appears in the &quot;Dr. Slump and Arale-chan&quot; video game for the Nintendo DS.

Goku has been the subject of, and is mentioned in, various songs. &quot;Son Goku Song&quot; and &quot;Gokū no Gokigen Jānī&quot; feature Goku as a child singing about himself. During his adult years, the song &quot;Aitsu wa Son Gokū&quot; by Hironobu Kageyama, where Kageyama praises everything about Goku, and the duet &quot;Ore-tachi no Energy&quot; feature words spoken by the character. For the release of the single of the &quot;Dragonball Evolution&quot; international theme song &quot;Rule&quot;, Toriyama supplied CD artwork of singer Ayumi Hamasaki dressed as Goku.

Goku has been used in Japanese public service announcements aimed at children. In June 1988, Goku and other &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; characters were featured in two PSA short films. The first, in which Goku is taught the importance of obeying traffic safety by others, is entitled &quot;Goku&#x27;s Traffic Safety&quot;. The second is called &quot;Goku&#x27;s Fire Fighting Regiment&quot;, in which he teaches two children the importance of fire safety.

Goku has made guest appearances in various Japanese television shows and manga. In 2005, Goku appeared in the Toriyama parody manga &quot;Neko Majin Z&quot; where he is the sensei of the main character Z. On September 15, 2006, in celebration of the 30th anniversary of &quot;Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo&quot;, the special manga &quot;Super Kochikame&quot; was released. The chapter entitled &quot;This is the Police Station in front of Dragon Park on Planet Namek&quot; has Ryotsu Kankichi travel to planet Namek and try to issue Freeza a citation and scold both he and Goku for parking their ships illegally.

Goku and other &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; characters joined the cast of &quot;One Piece&quot; in the 2006 crossover manga &quot;Cross Epoch&quot;. He appears in a single panel of Toriyama&#x27;s 2013 manga &quot;Jaco the Galactic Patrolman&quot;, which is set before the events of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. The collected tankōbon volume of &quot;Jaco&quot; features the bonus story &quot;Dragon Ball Minus: The Departure of the Fated Child&quot;, depicting how and why Goku&#x27;s parents sent him to Earth.

Goku has been the subject of various parodies. In the episode &quot;Career Day&quot; of &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot;, known in the United States as &quot;MXC&quot;, the hosts Beat Takeshi and Sonomanma Higashi dressed as popular anime characters, one as Goku as a child, the other as Doraemon. &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;″s &quot;Gag Special 2005&quot; issue, released on November 12, 2004, featured a &quot;Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo&quot; one-shot &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; parody manga, a retelling of the first fight between Goku and Vegeta. In chapter #179 of the &quot;Yakitate!! Japan&quot; manga, Kawachi executes a &quot;Genki-Dama&quot; parody called a &quot;Shinrai-Dama&quot; on the character Katsuo. In the manga and anime series &quot;Blood Lad&quot;, the character Staz performs the gestures for Goku&#x27;s Kamehameha, having learned it from his favorite manga superhero, but it has no actual effect.

Goku regularly appears on Fuji TV. In 2003, Goku appeared in the interactive feature &quot;Orb&#x27;s Panic Adventure!&quot;, which was featured at the Fuji TV headquarters in the orb section. In this, Freeza attacks a visiting tourist, blasting the orb section free from the rest of the Fuji TV building. Goku fights Freeza over the real life aqua city of Odaiba. In 2004, a sequel called &quot;Orb&#x27;s Panic Adventure Returns!&quot; was produced. On March 25, 2006, Goku and Freeza appeared in an original animated short film in the &quot;IQ Mirror Mistake 7&quot; segment of the Japanese game show &quot;IQ Supplement&quot;.

On April 7, 2007, Goku and Fuji TV announcer Masaharu Miyake were commentators on the anime segment in the &quot;Japan Great Man Awards&quot; titled &quot;Who is the Strongest Hero?&quot;. The segment featured a special tournament to decide who was the greatest person in Japanese history. During the intermission, Goku promoted the coming release of R2 &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; DVDs.

Since the U.S. debut of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; in 1996, Goku has appeared in American pop culture. He was featured in an issue of &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine in which he and Superman fought a hypothetical battle and won. In the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Operation: R.E.P.O.R.T&quot;, Numbuh Four&#x27;s version of the story is a parody of the Goku and Freeza&#x27;s battle in &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;. Goku appears in &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; in a sketch entitled &quot;A Very Dragon Ball Z Christmas&quot;, where Goku and Gohan fight an evil Mrs. Claus with Santa&#x27;s reindeer, in an attempt to save Christmas.

The &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch &quot;TV Funhouse&quot; titled &quot;Kobayashi&quot; depicts real-life hot-dog-eating champion Takeru Kobayashi as able to transform into a Super Saiyan as he prepares to eat hot dogs; Goku appears briefly near the end. Goku is referenced in the songs &quot;Goku&quot; and &quot;Anime&quot; by Soulja Boy Tell &#x27;Em, where he brags that he looks and feels like Goku.

Goku appears in a parody of the film &quot;Moneyball&quot; on an episode of &quot;Mad&quot; entitled &quot;Money Ball Z&quot;, in which Billy Beane drafts Goku and a couple of other &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; characters into the Oakland A&#x27;s. In 2013, he and Superman fought in a &quot;Death Battle&quot; episode of the Rooster Teeth web series &quot;ScrewAttack&quot; and lost. The episode &quot;Goku vs. Superman&quot; in the web series &quot;Epic Rap Battles of History&quot; won a Streamy Award for Best Music Video.

The use of the &quot;Kamehameha&quot; attack became an Internet meme which started with Japanese schoolgirls photographing themselves apparently using, and being affected by, this attack. It has attracted considerable media attention in France, Germany, as well as in many Spanish-speaking countries in South America.

==Cultural impact==

A number of notable public figures have commented on their feelings towards Goku or his status in popular culture. For example, Jackie Chan has gone on record stating that Goku is his favorite &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; character. The German rock band Son Goku takes their name from the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; protagonist. The band&#x27;s lead singer Thomas D chose the name because Goku embodies the band&#x27;s philosophy, saying he was &quot;fascinated by Goku&#x27;s naïveté and cheerfulness, yet, at the same time, a great warrior saving the world.&quot;

In 2010, a fiberglass statue of Goku was created by Canadian-born Hong Kong artist Edison Chen, with Chen&#x27;s facial features instead of Goku&#x27;s, as part of Chen&#x27;s collection that was displayed at the &quot;Treacherous Treis&quot; exhibition in Singapore&#x27;s Museum of Art and Design. CNN released an article explaining how Goku was Spanish professional tennis player Rafael Nadal&#x27;s childhood inspiration, and called Nadal &quot;the Dragon Ball of tennis&quot; due to his unorthodox style &quot;from another planet.&quot;
&quot;One Piece&quot; creator Eiichiro Oda and &quot;Naruto&quot; creator Masashi Kishimoto said that Goku inspired their protagonists as well as series structure, with &quot;Tekken&quot; Lars Alexandersson showing traits of a hero through his design inspired by Goku alongside Marvel Comic&#x27;s Thor. Commenting on Goku&#x27;s popularity, Kishimoto stated that when people hear the name &quot;Son Goku&quot;, no longer do they think of the &quot;Journey to the West&quot; character, but instead &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;&#x27;s protagonist comes to mind. Additionally, for the second half of the series, Kishimoto created an ape named Son Goku in reference to Toriyama&#x27;s character to the point the ape has four tails just like the four-star Dragon Ball Goku earned from his grandfather.

In his book about Akira Toriyama published in 2004, Julius Weideman said Goku&#x27;s journey and ever-growing strength resulted in the character winning &quot;the admiration of young boys everywhere.&quot; Jason Thompson stated that unlike the &quot;manly&quot; heroes of other popular shōnen manga of the late 1980s and early 1990s, such as &quot;City Hunter&quot; and &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;, Toriyama made his protagonist (Goku) cartoonish and small, thus starting a trend that Thompson says continues to this day. In 2015, the Japan Anniversary Association officially declared May 9 as &quot;Goku Day&quot;. Goku is the first manga character to have a balloon at the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, with his first appearance at the 2018 parade.

===Merchandise===
Several pieces of merchandising based on Goku have been released, including action figures, plushes, and keychains.

===Reception===
Goku has appeared in several &quot;top&quot; character lists. He was ranked number one in IGN&#x27;s 2009 list of Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time and reappeared on the same list in 2014, however, on this occasion they ranked him third, with &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;″s Spike Spiegel and &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;″s Shinji Ikari placed above him, saying that &quot;He was, in many ways, a character that bucked the trends of his time and defined the direction of shonen manga/anime for decades.&quot; In Mania Entertainment&#x27;s 10 Most Iconic Anime Heroes, Thomas Zoth commented that &quot;Goku and &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; completely revolutionized shōnen manga.&quot;

In a &quot;Newtype&quot; poll from March 2010, Goku was voted the fifth most popular male character from the 1980s. Goku ranked consistently high in the Anime Grand Prix poll in the category of &quot;best male character&quot; in the late 1980s and early 1990s, appearing seventeenth in the 1987 poll, fifteenth in the 1988 poll, second in the 1989 poll, fourth in the 1990 poll, third in the 1991 poll, fourth in the 1992 poll, thirteenth in 1993 poll, and twelfth in 1994 poll.

In a 1993 character popularity poll for the series, &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; readers voted Goku second, after his son Gohan. He came in first in the magazine&#x27;s 1995 poll, as well as in a 2004 poll amongst fans of the series for the book &quot;Dragon Ball Forever&quot;. In a 2005 &quot;The Daily Reader&quot; article entitled &quot;The Greatest Geek Movie Heroes of All Time&quot;, Goku is the only animated character listed, and is ranked tenth. In a survey of 1,000 people, conducted by Oricon in 2007, Goku ranked first place as the &quot;Strongest Manga character of all time.&quot;

In the survey &quot;Friendship&quot; developed by rankingjapan.com, in which people chose which anime character they would like as a friend, Goku ranked fifth. In 2000, Goku placed third in an Animax poll of favorite anime characters. In 2011, readers of &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; voted Goku as the 41st-top video game character of all time. NTT customers voted him as their third favorite black haired male anime character in a 2014 poll.

Game designer Hiroshi Matsuyama from CyberConnect2 said that while Goku is an appealing character readers could root for during the manga, he was hard to relate and, thus, instead preferred other characters like Krillin or Bulma. However, during the manga&#x27;s final story arc, Matsuyama recalls being overjoyed when Goku says that Mr. Satan, a comic relief character with no superextraordinary skills, was the real hero of mankind as the Earthlings found him as the saviour of mankind when Buu was about win the final fight.

Goku&#x27;s characterization has been well received by publications for manga, anime and other media. Anime News Network noted Goku as a good source of comedy and remarked that after everything he experiences, he still remains a naïve character. Tim Jones from THEM Anime Reviews noted that Goku is not an omnipotent character in the first anime series, unlike &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, and does not disappear for long periods of time between sagas. Jones also liked the way the series&#x27; depict his entire adventures, making him a good main character. Voice actor Mamoru Miyano said that Goku&#x27;s first Super Saiyan transformation in the manga was his favorite part from the series as Goku not only changed visually but his personality changes into a &quot;classic, prototypical hero&quot;.

Rationalmagic.com praised Goku&#x27;s innocence as one of the funniest parts of the series. In January 2017, Nozawa won two Guinness World Records for her longevity as Goku; she has been the sole voice actor for the role for over 23 years. According to &quot;Screen Rant&quot;, Goku&#x27;s origin story has some similarities to that of Superman. On the other hand, Collider was more critical to Goku&#x27;s actions in the series most notably when Gohan becomes an active character who goes through several character&#x27;s arcs yet he is constantly overshadowed by his father to the point Akira Toriyama refrained from turning Gohan into his successor following the Cell Games and Goku once again took over Gohan&#x27;s role in the final arc of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;.

Despite his predominantly positive reception, Goku has received some negative feedback, in particular for his characterization in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; due to how his constant desires for fighting stronger enemies resulted in setting up a story where all universes could be destroyed. While Anime Now&#x27;s Richard Eisenbeis believes Goku is determined to protect his universe, the fact that he does not seemingly care about other loser universes being destroyed has been criticized.

Monique Jones from Syfy panned the character&#x27;s relationship dynamic with his wife, as well as his perceived incompetency and irresponsibility as a father, drawing attention to the &quot;tons of memes and fan chatter about Piccolo actually being the best dad Gohan&#x27;s ever had&quot;. Sam Leach from Anime News Network agreed that fans of the series tend to joke about Piccolo being a better paternal figure to Gohan than his actual father, Goku, and felt that &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; emphasized this more when Piccolo started training him again.

The same site also criticized Goku often being busy in the narrative, most notably in Frieza&#x27;s resurrection, as the supporting characters have some extra scenes only to have their spotlight stolen by Goku and Vegeta. His rematch with Frieza was criticized for how overpowered the character has become and how much back up his allies can provide in the battle, ruining the tension the film was supposed to generate. Despite enjoying his rematch with Frieza, DVD Talk expressed similar responses in the handling of these characters.

&quot;IGN&quot; noted that Goku has a tendency to show enemies mercy, including Vegeta, Piccolo, Cell and Moro. His decision to let Cell have a senzu bean without informing his allies in particular was considered to be infamous, which affected Gohan&#x27;s confidence and led to his defeat. La Tercera went to call Goku irresponsible and immature to the character for helping Moro as a result of this show of mercy and the consequences. Both Goku and Vegeta were criticized for being too overpowered in &quot;Super&quot; to the point they steal the series&#x27; spotlight to the supporting cast while their strategies either lack complexity or create a plothole such as the time limit to the fusion Vegito.

<text>The Coalition of Essential Schools is a US organization created to further a type of whole-school reform originally envisioned by founder Ted Sizer in his book, &quot;Horace&#x27;s Compromise.&quot; The group began in 1984 with twelve schools and grew to 600 members.

In 2014 it merged with the Forum for Education and operated from headquarters in Portland, Maine. The organization&#x27;s executive board voted in December 2016 to cease the organization’s operations.

<text>Fear of Music is the third studio album by the American new wave band Talking Heads, released on August 3, 1979, by Sire Records. It was recorded at locations in New York City during April and May 1979 and was produced by Brian Eno and Talking Heads. The album reached number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 33 on the UK Albums Chart. It spawned the singles &quot;Life During Wartime&quot;, &quot;I Zimbra&quot;, and &quot;Cities&quot;.

&quot;Fear of Music&quot; received favorable reviews from critics. Praise centered on its unconventional rhythms and frontman David Byrne&#x27;s lyrical performances. The album is often considered one of Talking Heads&#x27; best releases and has been featured in several publications&#x27; lists of the best albums of all time.

==Background==
Talking Heads&#x27; second album &quot;More Songs About Buildings and Food&quot;, released in 1978, expanded the band&#x27;s sonic palette. The record included a hit single, a cover of Al Green&#x27;s &quot;Take Me to the River&quot;, which gained the quartet commercial exposure. In March 1979, the band members played the song on nationwide U.S. music show &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. In the days after the performance, they decided they did not want to be regarded simply as &quot;a singles machine&quot;. 

Talking Heads entered a New York City studio without a producer in the spring of 1979 and rehearsed demo tracks. Musically, the band wanted to expand on the &quot;subtly disguised&quot; disco rhythms present in &quot;More Songs About Buildings and Food&quot; by making them more prominent in the mixes of new songs. These recording plans were shelved after the quartet was not pleased with the results. A decision was then taken to rehearse in drummer Chris Frantz and bassist Tina Weymouth&#x27;s loft in Long Island City, Queens, where the band members had played while unsigned in the mid-1970s. Brian Eno, who had produced &quot;More Songs About Buildings and Food&quot;, was called in to help.

==Recording and production==
On April 22 and May 6, 1979, a sound engineering crew in a Record Plant van parked outside Frantz&#x27;s and Weymouth&#x27;s apartment building and ran cables through their loft window. On these two days, Talking Heads recorded the basic tracks with Eno. 

Weymouth later stated that Byrne&#x27;s sense of rhythm is &quot;insane but fantastic&quot; and that he was key to the band&#x27;s recording drive during the home sessions. As songs evolved, the performances became easier for the band members. Eno was instrumental in shaping both their sound and recording confidence, and worked on electronic treatments of tracks.

==Composition==
&quot;Fear of Music&quot; is largely built on an eclectic mix of disco rhythms, cinematic soundscapes, and conventional rock music elements.

Byrne credits the inspiration for the album, especially &quot;Life During Wartime&quot;, to life on Avenue A in the East Village. Instead of incorporating characters in society, as he did on &quot;More Songs About Buildings and Food&quot;, Byrne decided to place them alone in dystopian situations. Weymouth was initially skeptical of Byrne&#x27;s new compositions, but the frontman managed to persuade her. 

Album opener &quot;I Zimbra&quot; is influenced by Afrobeat and disco, and includes guitar work by Robert Fripp and background chanting from assistant recording engineer Julie Last. The nonsensical lyrics are based on the poem &quot;Gadji beri bimba&quot; by German Dadaist writer Hugo Ball. Band member Jerry Harrison has said that this song influenced what the band was to do on their next album, &quot;Remain in Light&quot; (1980).

&quot;Cities&quot; details a search for the ideal urban settlement to live in and was born out of Talking Heads&#x27; preferences for urban homes, especially in Manhattan. &quot;Paper&quot; compares a love affair to a simple piece of paper. In &quot;Life During Wartime&quot;, Byrne casts himself an &quot;unheroic urban guerrilla&quot;, who renounced parties, survived on basic supplies like peanut butter, and heard rumors about weapons shipments and impromptu graveyards. The character is only connected to the imminent collapse of his civilization. Byrne considered the persona &quot;believable and plausible&quot;. &quot;Air&quot; is a protest song against the atmosphere, an idea Byrne does not consider &quot;a joke&quot;. Inspired by &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill, the lyricist wanted to create a melancholic and touching track about a person who feels so depressed that even breathing feels painful.

==Artwork==
The LP sleeve was designed by Harrison. It is completely black and embossed with a pattern that resembles the appearance and texture of tread plate metal flooring, reflecting the album&#x27;s urban subject matter. The rest of the artwork was crafted by Byrne and includes heat-sensitive photography created by Jimmy Garcia with the help of Doctor Philip Strax. The design was nominated for the 1980 Grammy Award for Best Recording Package. Harrison suggested the &quot;ludicrous&quot; title to the band; according to Weymouth, it was accepted because it &quot;fit&quot; the album&#x27;s themes and the quartet&#x27;s stress during the album&#x27;s production.

==Promotion and release==
After completing &quot;Fear of Music&quot;, Talking Heads embarked on their first Pacific region tour in June 1979 and played concerts in New Zealand, Australia, Japan, and Hawaii. The album was released worldwide on August 3. 

A U.S. tour to showcase the new material was completed during August 1979. At the time, Byrne told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;re in a funny position. It wouldn&#x27;t please us to make music that&#x27;s impossible to listen to, but we don&#x27;t want to compromise for the sake of popularity.&quot; The band shared the headliner slots with Van Morrison and the Chieftains at the Edinburgh Festival in September, and embarked on a promotional European tour until the end of the year.

==Reception==
===Critical===
The album received widespread critical acclaim. Jon Pareles, writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, was impressed with its &quot;unswerving rhythms&quot; and Byrne&#x27;s lyrical evocations; he concluded, &quot;&quot;Fear of Music&quot; is often deliberately, brilliantly disorienting. Like its black, corrugated packaging (which resembles a manhole cover), the album is foreboding, inescapably urban and obsessed with texture.&quot; John Rockwell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; suggested that the record was not a conventional rock release, while Stephanie Pleet of the &quot;Daily Collegian&quot; commented that it showed a positive progression in Talking Heads&#x27; musical style. Robert Christgau, writing in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, praised the album&#x27;s &quot;gritty weirdness&quot;, but noted that &quot;a little sweetening might help&quot;. Richard Cromelin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was impressed with Byrne&#x27;s &quot;awesome vocal performance&quot; and its nuances and called &quot;Fear of Music&quot; &quot;a quantum leap&quot; for the band. Tom Bentkowski of &quot;New York&quot; concluded, &quot;But what makes the record so successful, perhaps, is a genuinely felt anti-elitism. Talking Heads was clever enough to make the intellectual infectious and even danceable.&quot;

In retrospective reviews, AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann felt that &quot;Fear of Music&quot; was &quot;an uneven, transitional album&quot;, but nonetheless stated that it includes songs that match the quality of the band&#x27;s best works. In the 1995 &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot;, Jeff Salamon called it Talking Heads&#x27; most musically varied offering. In a 2003 review, Chris Smith of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; praised Byrne&#x27;s personas and Eno&#x27;s stylized production techniques. In &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; published the same year, Andy Smith concluded that the album is a strong candidate for the best LP of the 1970s because it is &quot;bristling with hooks, riffs and killer lines&quot;.

===Commercial===
&quot;Fear of Music&quot; was certified Gold by Recording Industry Association of America on September 17, 1985, after more than 500,000 copies were sold in the U.S.

===Accolades===
&quot;Fear of Music&quot; was named as the best album of 1979 by &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; included it on its unnumbered shortlist of the 10 best records issued that year. &quot;Sounds&quot; placed the album at number two on its &quot;Best of 1979&quot; staff list, behind the Specials&#x27; eponymous release. It placed fourth in the 1979 Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll run by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, which aggregates the votes of hundreds of prominent reviewers. 

In 1985, &quot;NME&quot; placed &quot;Fear of Music&quot; at number 68 on its writers&#x27; list of the &quot;All Time 100 Albums&quot;. In 1987, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it at number 94 on its list of the best albums of the previous 20 years. In 1999, it was included at number 33 on &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s list of the &quot;Top 100 Albums That Don&#x27;t Appear in All the Other Top 100 Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2004, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; featured the record at number 31 on its &quot;Top 100 Albums of the 1970s&quot; list, while in 2005, Channel 4 ranked it at number 76 during its &quot;100 Greatest Albums&quot; countdown. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>Noël Forgeard (born 8 December 1946 in La Ferté-Gaucher) is a French industrialist and former joint CEO of EADS.

==Appointment==
From April 1998 until June 2005, Forgeard was CEO of the aircraft manufacturer Airbus SAS.

In late 2004, he was nominated as the next French CEO of EADS. This position is shared with a German—then Thomas Enders—in a system that was established at the creation of EADS in 2000.

==Alleged insider dealing==
News reports in June 2006 focused on possible insider dealing at EADS. Forgeard made a 2.5 million Euro profit on the sale of EADS shares, with his children earning 4.2 million Euro, just weeks before news of Airbus A380 delays was released. Forgeard denied any wrongdoing, claiming that he was a scapegoat in the matter.

Forgeard resigned as CEO of EADS on 2 July 2006 and was replaced by Christian Streiff.

<doc id="572624" wikidata="Q857908" url="?curid=572624" title="Can't Buy a Thrill">
<text>Can&#x27;t Buy a Thrill is the debut studio album by American rock band Steely Dan, released in November 1972, by ABC Records. It was written by band members Walter Becker and Donald Fagen, and recorded in August 1972 at the Village Recorder in Los Angeles with producer Gary Katz. The album is one of Steely Dan&#x27;s most stylistically eclectic, encompassing the sounds of soft rock, pop rock and jazz-rock, alongside philosophical, elliptical lyrics.

A commercial success, &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy a Thrill&quot; peaked at number 17 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, bolstered by the popular singles &quot;Do It Again&quot; and &quot;Reelin&#x27; In the Years&quot;, and was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was also met with positive reviews and has appeared on many retrospective &quot;greatest albums&quot; lists, including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; (2003).

==Recording==
Steely Dan recorded the album in August 1972 at the Village Recorder in Los Angeles. Two songs recorded during the &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy a Thrill&quot; sessions were left off the album and released as a single: &quot;Dallas&quot; b/w &quot;Sail the Waterway&quot;. This is the only Steely Dan album to include David Palmer as a lead vocalist, having been recruited after Donald Fagen expressed concerns over singing live. Drummer Jim Hodder contributes lead vocals on one song, &quot;Midnite Cruiser&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;Midnight Cruiser&quot;); he also sang &quot;Dallas&quot;. By the time recording of the next album began, the band and producer Gary Katz had convinced Fagen to assume the full lead vocalist role.

==Music and lyrics==
According to writers Marjorie Galen and Gordon Matthews, &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy a Thrill&quot; features an upbeat soft rock style. Music journalist Paul Lester said it incorporates mambo, swing, jazz, and Latin musical elements. Music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that &quot;there are very few of the jazz flourishes that came to distinguish their [later] albums&quot;, but added that the first single from the album, &quot;Do It Again&quot;, incorporates a tight Latin jazz beat, while the second single, &quot;Reelin&#x27; In the Years&quot;, features jazzy guitar solos and harmonies. Robert Christgau described &quot;Do It Again&quot; as a toned-down mambo song with &quot;tragic&quot; lyrics about a &quot;compulsive&quot; loser.

&quot;Fire in the Hole&quot;, which features &quot;angry, strident piano&quot; by Fagen, takes its title from a phrase used by American soldiers in Vietnam, and alludes to the many students who evaded the draft in the late 1960s and early 1970s (Becker and Fagen included).

==Title and packaging==
The title of the album is a reference to the opening line of the Bob Dylan song &quot;It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry&quot;. The album cover features a photomontage by Robert Lockart. It includes images of muscle-men and a line of prostitutes (standing in Rue du Gros-Horloge in Rouen, France), waiting for clients, which was chosen because of its relevance to the album title. In the liner notes to a reissue of &quot;The Royal Scam&quot; (1976), Walter Becker and Donald Fagen said that &quot;The Royal Scam&quot; possessed &quot;the most hideous album cover of the seventies, bar none (excepting perhaps &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy a Thrill&quot;).&quot; The cover was banned in Francisco Franco&#x27;s Spain and replaced by a photograph of the band playing in concert.

==Release==
&quot;Can&#x27;t Buy a Thrill&quot; was released in the United States by ABC Records in November 1972, and in the United Kingdom by Probe Records in January 1973. The album was released in a two-channel stereo mix, as well as in a four-channel quadraphonic mix.

The album peaked at number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, and Dunhill Records reissued the album in the U.S. on August 22, 1973. On May 31, 1973, &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy a Thrill&quot; was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), recognizing the shipment of 500,000 copies in the U.S.; it was certified Platinum on September 7, 1993, recognizing the shipment of 1,000,000 copies.

==Critical reception==

Reviewing the album in November 1972 for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, James Isaacs said &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy a Thrill&quot; is &quot;distinguished by three top-level cuts and scattered moments of inspiration,&quot; but felt the band occasionally sounded &quot;limp&quot;. In his review for &quot;Creem&quot;, Robert Christgau deemed the package &quot;A hit single with a good album attached&quot;, and said he found the lyrics &quot;oblique, even philosophical [...] as befit a band named after a dildo in a William Burroughs novel.&quot; In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Christgau expounded on his original praise, writing: &quot;Think of the Dan as the first post-boogie band: the beat swings more than it blasts or blisters, the chord changes defy our primitive subconscious expectations, and the lyrics underline their own difficulty—as well as the difficulty of the reality to which they refer—with arbitrary personal allusions, most of which are ruses.&quot;

In a retrospective review for BBC Music, Paul Lester said the album is so &quot;fully-formed [...] that you would scarcely believe that it&#x27;s their debut&quot;, and contains &quot;tightly constructed songs with dazzling hooks, clever, cryptic lyrics, and vocals that offer teasing critiques for those that want them.&quot; Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said the songs on the album &quot;subvert traditional conventions&quot; and are &quot;tightly constructed, with interlocking chords and gracefully interwoven melodies, buoyed by clever, cryptic lyrics&quot;, but criticized the contributions of vocalist David Palmer, writing that he &quot;oversings the handful of tracks where he takes the lead&quot;, which caused Becker and Fagen to temper &quot;their wildest impulses with mainstream pop techniques.&quot; In a review included in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Rob Sheffield was somewhat less impressed by the album, calling it &quot;mellow folk rock&quot; that was &quot;softened&quot; by Palmer, who &quot;sounds like he&#x27;s nervous about where his wallet is&quot;.

&quot;Can&#x27;t Buy a Thrill&quot; has appeared on retrospective &quot;greatest albums&quot; lists. In 2000, it was voted number 207 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2003, it was ranked number 238 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;; it was number 240 on the 2012 update of the list, and number 168 on the 2020 version. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="572634" wikidata="Q6025982" url="?curid=572634" title="A Woman Peeling Apples">
<text>A Woman Peeling Apples (c. 1663) is a painting by the Dutch Golden Age painter Pieter de Hooch. It is currently in the Wallace Collection in London.

==Description==
It is a genre painting showing a quiet domestic scene from the time, like most of de Hooch&#x27;s works. The elaborate fireplace and fur and embroidery in the mother&#x27;s clothes show a prosperous household, and the cupid between the two figures implies a happy one. Its sensitive handling of light—in particular, natural light filtered into an otherwise unlit interior space—led 19th-century art historians to attribute it to Johannes Vermeer, with whose work the painting does bear strong similarities. However, Vermeer&#x27;s work typically portrayed a woman working alone instead of a family scene as in &quot;A Woman Peeling Apples&quot;. Most scholars also now believe that de Hooch was influenced by Vermeer instead of Vermeer by de Hooch.

The painting is in oil on canvas (67 cm × 55 cm). It is also sometimes referred to as &quot;A Woman Peeling Apples, with a Small Child&quot;. This painting was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1908, who wrote:33. WOMAN PEELING APPLES. de G. 55. In the right-hand corner of a room sits a woman, facing the spectator. She wears a black velvet jacket trimmed with fur, a red skirt, and a white apron. In her lap she holds a basket of apples which she is peeling. She holds out a long rind in her right hand to a little girl standing to the left and seen in profile. A tub is on the floor at the woman&#x27;s feet. To the left is a fireplace with a kettle on the fire. The fireplace is lined with Delft tiles, and is enclosed with pilasters worked in low relief. Behind the woman hangs a mirror in a black frame. The sunlight enters through a window above to the right and illumines the wall and a corner of the mirror. The floor is composed of brown and white tiles. The picture is in a very dirty condition. Its general effect is fine. It is somewhat similar in style to the Weissbach picture (4), but not so charming in subject; it is Canvas, 26 inches by 21 inches. Mentioned by Waagen, Supplement, p. 87, in the collection of the Marquis of Hertford, who bought it from C. Perrier in 1848 (for £283 : 10s.). Described by Bürger, Gazette des Beaux-Arts, 1866, vol. xxi. p. 561, as a Vermeer, No. 16. Exhibited at the Royal Academy Winter Exhibition, London, 1893, No. 55. Now in the Wallace collection, London, No. 23 in the 1901 catalogue.

<doc id="572635" wikidata="Q868506" url="?curid=572635" title="Intestinal villus">
<text>Intestinal villi (: villus) are small, finger-like projections that extend into the lumen of the small intestine. Each villus is approximately 0.5–1.6 mm in length (in humans), and has many microvilli projecting from the enterocytes of its epithelium which collectively form the striated or brush border. Each of these microvilli are about 1 μm in length, around 1000 times shorter than a single villus. The intestinal villi are much smaller than any of the circular folds in the intestine. 

Villi increase the internal surface area of the intestinal walls making available a greater surface area for absorption. An increased absorptive area is useful because digested nutrients (including monosaccharide and amino acids) pass into the semipermeable villi through diffusion, which is effective only at short distances. In other words, increased surface area (in contact with the fluid in the lumen) decreases the average distance travelled by nutrient molecules, so effectiveness of diffusion increases. The villi are connected to the blood vessels so the circulating blood then carries these nutrients away.

==Structure==

===Microanatomy===
Enterocytes, along with goblet cells, represent the principal cell types of the epithelium of the villi in the small intestine.

==Function==
There, the villi and the microvilli increase intestinal absorptive surface area approximately 40-fold and 600-fold, respectively, providing exceptionally efficient absorption of nutrients in the lumen. 

There are also enzymes (enterocyte digestive enzyme) on the surface for digestion. Villus capillaries collect amino acids and simple sugars taken up by the villi into the blood stream. Villus lacteals (lymph capillaries) collect absorbed chylomicrons, which are lipoproteins composed of triglycerides, cholesterol and amphipathic proteins, and are taken to the rest of the body through the lymph fluid.

Villi are specialized for absorption in the small intestine as they have a thin wall, one cell thick, which enables a shorter diffusion path. They have a large surface area so there will be more efficient absorption of fatty acids and glycerol into the blood stream. They have a rich blood supply to keep a concentration gradient.

==Clinical significance==

===Villous atrophy===

In diseases of the small intestine the villi can become flattened due to the effects of inflammation, and the villi can sometimes disappear. This deterioration is known as villous atrophy, and is often a feature of coeliac disease.

<doc id="572637" wikidata="Q419566" url="?curid=572637" title="Guanylate cyclase">
<text>Guanylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.2, also known as guanyl cyclase, guanylyl cyclase, or GC; systematic name GTP diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing; 3′,5′-cyclic-GMP-forming)) is a lyase enzyme that converts guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and pyrophosphate:

: GTP = 3′,5′-cyclic GMP + diphosphate

It is often part of the G protein signaling cascade that is activated by low intracellular calcium levels and inhibited by high intracellular calcium levels. In response to calcium levels, guanylate cyclase synthesizes cGMP from GTP. cGMP keeps cGMP-gated channels open, allowing for the entry of calcium into the cell.

Like cAMP, cGMP is an important second messenger that internalizes the message carried by intercellular messengers such as peptide hormones and nitric oxide and can also function as an autocrine signal. Depending on cell type, it can drive adaptive/developmental changes requiring protein synthesis. In smooth muscle, cGMP is the signal for relaxation, and is coupled to many homeostatic mechanisms including regulation of vasodilation, vocal tone, insulin secretion, and peristalsis. Once formed, cGMP can be degraded by phosphodiesterases, which themselves are under different forms of regulation, depending on the tissue.

==Reaction==
Guanylate cyclase catalyzes the reaction of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to 3&#x27;,5&#x27;-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and pyrophosphate:

==Effects==

Guanylate cyclase is found in the retina (RETGC) and modulates visual phototransduction in rods and cones. It is part of the calcium negative feedback system that is activated in response to the hyperpolarization of the photoreceptors by light. This causes less intracellular calcium, which stimulates guanylate cyclase-activating proteins (GCAPs). Studies have shown that cGMP synthesis in cones is about 5-10 times higher than it is in rods, which may play an important role in modulating cone adaption to light. In addition, studies have shown that zebrafish express a higher number of GCAPs than mammals, and that zebrafish GCAPs can bind at least three calcium ions.

Guanylate cyclase 2C (GC-C) is an enzyme expressed mainly in intestinal neurons. Activation of GC-C amplifies the excitatory cell response that is modulated by glutamate and acetylcholine receptors. GC-C, while known mainly for its secretory regulation in the intestinal epithelium, is also expressed in the brain. To be specific, it is found in the somata and dendrites of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the substantia nigra. Some studies implicate this pathway as having a role in attention deficiency and hyperactive behavior.

Soluble guanylate cyclase contains a molecule of heme, and is activated primarily by the binding of nitric oxide (NO) to that heme. sGC is primary receptor for NO a gaseous, membrane-soluble neurotransmitter. sGC expression has been shown to be highest in the striatum compared to other brain regions and has been explored as a possible candidate for restoring striatal dysfunction in Parkinson&#x27;s disease. sGC acts as an intracellular intermediary for regulating dopamine and glutamate. Upregulation, which creates neuronal sensitivity, of the cGMP in a dopamine-depleted striatum has been associated with the symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s. Increased intracellular cGMP has been shown to contribute to excessive neuron excitability and locomotor activity. Activation of this pathway can also stimulate presynaptic glutamate release and cause an upregulation of AMPA receptors postsynaptically.

==Types==
There are membrane-bound (type 1, guanylate cyclase-coupled receptor) and soluble (type 2, soluble guanylate cyclase) forms of guanylate cyclases.

Membrane bound guanylate cyclases include an external ligand-binding domain (e.g., for peptide hormones such as BNP and ANP), a transmembrane domain, and an internal catalytic domain homologous to adenylyl cyclases. Recently, a directly light-gated guanylate cyclase has been discovered in an aquatic fungus.

In the mammalian retina, two forms of guanylate cyclase have been identified, each encoded by separate genes; RETGC-1 and RETGC-2. RETGC-1 has been found to be expressed in higher levels in cones compared to rod cells. Studies have also shown that mutations in the RETGC-1 gene can lead to cone-rod dystrophy by disrupting the phototransduction processes.

==Mutations==
Cone dystrophy (COD) is a retinal degradation of photoreceptor function wherein cone function is lost at the onset of the dystrophy but rod function is preserved until almost the end. COD has been linked to several genetic mutations including mutations in the guanylate cyclase activator 1A (GUCA1A) and guanylate cyclase 2D (GUY2D) among other enzymes. To be specific, GUY2D codes for RETGC-1, which is involved in cone adaptation and photoreceptor sensitivity by synthesizing cGMP. Low concentrations of calcium cause the dimerization of RETGC-1 proteins through stimulation from guanylate cyclase-activating proteins (GCAP). This process happens at amino acids 817-857, and mutations in this region increase RETGC-1 affinity for GCAP. This works to alter the calcium sensitivity of the neuron by allowing mutant RETGC-1 to be activated by GCAP at higher calcium levels than the wild-type. Because RETGC-1 produces cGMP, which keeps cyclic nucleotide-gated channels open allowing the influx of calcium, this mutation causes extremely high intracellular calcium levels. Calcium, which plays many roles in the cell and is tightly regulated, disrupts the membrane when it appears in excess. Also, calcium is linked to apoptosis by causing the release of cytochrome c. Therefore, mutations in the RETGC-1 can cause COD by increasing intracellular calcium levels and stimulating cone photoreceptor death.

<doc id="572638" wikidata="Q1365517" url="?curid=572638" title="Lufia">
<text>Lufia, known as in Japan, was a series of role-playing video games developed by Neverland (aside from &quot;The Ruins of Lore&quot;, which was developed by Atelier Double). In Japan, the games were originally published by Taito and later, its now-parent company Square Enix (with &quot;Curse of the Sinistrals&quot;), and after the closing of Taito&#x27;s North American branch after the release of the first game, Natsume Inc. (&quot;Rise of the Sinistrals&quot;, &quot;The Legend Returns&quot;, and &quot;Curse of the Sinistrals&quot;) and Atlus USA (&quot;The Ruins of Lore&quot;) in the U.S. While the games are primarily traditional 2D RPGs, they draw on elements from many other genres including action-adventure, monster collecting, and puzzle games. In the 1990s the games were originally developed on the Super NES while the most recent installment, &quot;&quot;, was developed for the Nintendo DS and was released in 2010 for Japan on February 25 and for North America on October 12. The series currently consists of six games, including this most recent installment.

== Setting ==

The &quot;Lufia&quot; series spans the course of two centuries, beginning with the defeat of the god-like Sinistrals in &quot;Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals&quot;. These events are followed by &quot;Ruins of Lore&quot;, which takes place 20 years after &quot;Rise of the Sinistrals&quot; ends. &quot;Fortress of Doom&quot; picks up another 79 years (99 years after the events of &quot;Rise of the Sinistrals&quot;) later. The current series ends with the Sinistrals&#x27; final defeat in &quot;Legend Returns&quot;, which takes place 101 years after &quot;Fortress of Doom&quot;.

== Characters ==
&quot;Lufia&quot; follows the exploits of the hero Maxim and his quest to defeat the Sinistrals; after his death, this task is taken up by his descendants through several generations. One of his descendants is Wain, the main male protagonist of &quot;The Legend Returns&quot;.

<doc id="572653" wikidata="Q4269872" url="?curid=572653" title="Robert Stuart, Duke of Kintyre and Lorne">
<text>Robert Bruce Stuart, Duke of Kintyre and Lorne (18 January 1602 – 27 May 1602) was the fifth child of James VI of Scotland and Anne of Denmark. He was born at Dunfermline Palace, Fife. On 2 May 1602 he was created Duke of Kintyre and Lorne, Marquess of Wigton, Earl of Carrick and Lord of Annandale. He died at Dunfermline Palace on 27 May 1602 and was buried at Holyrood Abbey.

His older siblings included Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, Elizabeth, and Charles.

Robert&#x27;s birth was attended by the physicians Martin Schöner and John Naysmyth and the midwife Janet Kinloch. He was born at 1 o&#x27;clock in the morning. The page John Murray brought news of the birth to the king, who was staying at Edinburgh, and had set out to visit the queen. Edinburgh Castle gave a cannon salute. James VI gave Anne of Denmark a gift of a pointed diamond. Robert&#x27;s nurse Isobel Colt was dressed in black velvet. The baptism was delayed longer than usual. It was widely believed that Prince Henry would be godfather and after the baptism he would stay at Dunfermline Palace with his mother, but this did not come to be, despite the king&#x27;s promise.

On 2 May 1602 Robert was carried from Dunfermline Palace into the Abbey by the Duke of Lennox on a large purple cushion for his baptism. His name and titles were proclaimed by trumpeters at the windows of the abbey, and the celebrations involved a tournament of &quot;running at ring&quot; which damaged a cornfield. The sum of £66-13s-4d Scots was thrown into the crowd as largesse. On the previous day an English Catholic, Humphrey Dethick, either the son of a London baker or from Ashbourne, Derbyshire, killed one of the guests, claiming to be acting to fulfil a prophecy told to him in Spain.

Margaret Stewart, Mistress of Ochiltree, the senior lady in waiting, was in charge of Robert&#x27;s care. Marion Hepburn was appointed to rock Robert&#x27;s cradle. Isobel Colt, the nurse, was the wife of Patrick Smith, an Edinburgh lawyer and writer to the signet. She was dismissed shortly before the death of Duke Robert, as it was thought a new nurse would improve his health. Isobel was given £200 Scots as a reward for her service by the English courtier Roger Aston on 25 May. The payment was witnessed by John Buchanan, who later married Margaret Hartsyde, a servant of the queen.

When Robert was ill and Princess Elizabeth at Linlithgow Palace was sick with the measles, Anne of Denmark was &quot;sorrowful and more than ever she was before&quot;, but she told James, &quot;If it please God to take one of our children, He will send us another, for I feel myself with child.&quot;

David Calderwood wrote that Doctor Hereis got little thanks for his care of the prince.

<text>Michel Gustave Édouard Mayor (; born 12 January 1942) is a Swiss astrophysicist and professor emeritus at the University of Geneva&#x27;s Department of Astronomy. He formally retired in 2007, but remains active as a researcher at the Observatory of Geneva. He is co-laureate of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics along with Jim Peebles and Didier Queloz, and the winner of the 2010 Viktor Ambartsumian International Prize and the 2015 Kyoto Prize.

Together with Didier Queloz in 1995, he discovered , the first extrasolar planet orbiting a sun-like star, 51 Pegasi. For this achievement, they were awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a solar-type star&quot; resulting in &quot;contributions to our understanding of the evolution of the universe and Earth’s place in the cosmos&quot;.
Related to the discovery, Mayor noted that humans will never migrate to such exoplanets since they are &quot;much, much too far away ... [and would take] hundreds of millions of days using the means we have available today&quot;. However, due to discoveries by Mayor, searching for extraterrestrial communications from exoplanets may now be a more practical consideration than thought earlier.

==Education and career==
Mayor obtained an MS degree in Physics from the University of Lausanne (1966) and a PhD in Astronomy from the Geneva Observatory in 1971. He was a researcher at the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Cambridge in 1971. Subsequently, he spent sabbatical semesters at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in northern Chile and at the Institute for Astronomy of the University of Hawaiʻi System.

From 1971 to 1984, Mayor worked as a research associate at the Observatory of Geneva, which is home to the astronomy department of the University of Geneva. He became an associate professor at the university in 1984. In 1988, the university named him a full professor, a position he held until his retirement in 2007. Mayor was director of the Observatory of Geneva from 1998 to 2004. He is a professor emeritus at the University of Geneva.

==Research==
Mayor&#x27;s research interests include extrasolar planets (also known as exoplanets), instrumentation, statistical properties of double stars, globular cluster dynamics, galactic structure and kinematics. Mayor&#x27;s doctoral thesis at the University of Geneva was devoted to the spiral structure of galaxies.

During his time as a research associate, there had been strong interest in developing photoelectric-based Doppler spectrometers to obtain more accurate measurements of radial velocities of stellar objects compared to existing photographic methods. Following preliminary work by Roger Griffin in 1967 to show the feasibility of photoelectric measurements of radial velocities, Mayor worked with André Baranne at the Marseille Observatory to develop CORAVEL, a photoelectric spectrometer capable of highly accurate radial velocity measurements, which allow measurement of star movements, orbital periods of binary stars, and even the rotational speed of stars.

This research led to various fields of interest, including the study of statistical characteristics of solar-type binary stars. With fellow researcher Antoine Duquennoy, they examined the radial velocities of several systems believed to be binary stars in 1991. Their results found that a subset of these may in fact be single star systems with substellar secondary objects. Desiring more accurate radial velocity measurements, Mayor, along with Baranne at Marseille, and with graduate student Didier Queloz, developed ELODIE, a new spectrograph based on the work of CORAVEL, which was estimated to have an accuracy of 15 m/s for bright stars, improving upon the 1 km/s from CORAVEL. ELODIE was developed with the specific intent to determine if the substellar secondary objects were brown dwarf stars or potentially giant planets.

By 1994, ELODIE was operational at Geneva and Mayor and Queloz began their survey of Sun-like systems with suspected substellar secondary objects. In July 1995, the pair&#x27;s survey of 51 Pegasi affirmed that there was an exoplanet orbiting it, identified as , which was later classified as a hot-Jupiter–type planet. This was the first exoplanet to be found orbiting a main-sequence star, as opposed to planets that orbited the remains of a star. Mayor&#x27;s and Queloz&#x27;s discovery of an exoplanet launched great interest is searching for other exoplanets since. On 21 March 2022, the 5000th exoplanet beyond our solar system was confirmed.

Mayor&#x27;s work focused more on improving instrumentation for radial velocity measurements to improve detecting exoplanets and measuring their properties. Mayor led a team to further improve ELODIE to increase velocity measurement accuracy to 1 m/s via the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) installed on the ESO 3.6 m Telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile by 2003. Mayor led the team that used HARPS to seek out other exoplanets. In 2007, Mayor was one of 11 European scientists who discovered Gliese 581c, the first extrasolar planet in a star&#x27;s habitable zone, from the ESO telescope. In 2009, Mayor and his team discovered the lightest exoplanet ever detected around a main sequence star: Gliese 581e. Nonetheless, Mayor noted that humans will never migrate to such exoplanets since they are &quot;much, much too far away ... [and would take] hundreds of millions of days using the means we have available today&quot;. However, due to discoveries by Mayor, searching for extraterrestrial communications from exoplanets may now be a more practical consideration than thought earlier.

==Awards and distinctions==
In 1998, Mayor was awarded the Swiss Marcel Benoist Prize in recognition of his work and its significance for human life. As of 2003, he was a member of the board of trustees. He received the Prix Jules Janssen from the Société astronomique de France (French Astronomical Society) in 1998.

In 2000, he was awarded the Balzan Prize. Four years later, he was awarded the Albert Einstein Medal. In 2005, he received the Shaw Prize in Astronomy, along with American astrophysicist Geoffrey Marcy. Mayor was made a knight of the French Legion d&#x27;Honneur in 2004.

In collaboration with Pierre-Yves Frei, Mayor wrote a book in French called (Seuil, 260 pages), which was awarded the prize by the 17th Astronomy Festival Haute Maurienne.

Mayor has received honorary doctorate degrees from eight universities: Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Belgium), 2001; École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) (Lausanne, Switzerland) (2002); Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (Brazil), 2006; Uppsala University (Sweden), 2007; Paris Observatory (France), 2008; Université Libre de Bruxelles (Belgium), 2009; University of Provence (Marseille, France), 2011, and Université Joseph Fourier (Grenoble, France), 2014.

Mayor has received the 2011 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award of Basic Sciences (together with his former student Didier Queloz) for developing new astronomical instruments and experimental techniques that led to the first observation of planets around Sun-like stars. Asteroid 125076 Michelmayor, discovered by Swiss amateur astronomer Michel Ory at the Jura Observatory in 2001, was named in his honor. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 21 August 2013 ().

In 2015, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, and the Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences. In 2017, he received the Wolf Prize in Physics. He and Didier Queloz (also from Switzerland) were awarded one half of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of the exoplanet 51 Pegasi b.

<text>The Crown Court is the criminal court of first instance in England and Wales responsible for hearing all indictable offences, some either way offences and appeals of the decisions of magistrates&#x27; courts. It is one of three Senior Courts of England and Wales.

The Crown Court sits in around 92 locations in England and Wales, divided into Circuits. When sitting in the City of London, it is known as the Central Criminal Court or &quot;Old Bailey&quot;.

The Crown Court is administered by HM Courts and Tribunals Service, an executive agency of the Ministry of Justice.

==History==
England and Wales formerly used a system of courts of assize and quarter sessions for indictment trials at first instance. However, the Beeching Commission in 1969 recommended the replacement of the assize system, following the model of the &#x27;crown courts&#x27; introduced by the Criminal Justice Administration Act 1956 (4 &amp; 5 Eliz. 2. c. 34). in Liverpool and Manchester.

The current Crown Court was established on 1 January 1972 by the Courts Act 1971, establishing a unitary trial court for the whole jurisdiction.

With the merging of the various court services into what is now HM Courts and Tribunals Service, the Crown Court frequently shares facilities with the County Court and magistrates&#x27; courts.

== Procedures ==
The Crown Court carries out four principal types of activity:

* Trials by jury of indictable offences
* Hearing appeals from magistrates&#x27; courts
* Sentencing of defendants committed from magistrates&#x27; courts
* Sentencing of those convicted in Crown Court

The average time from receipt by the Crown Court to completion was 177 days by the start of 2016.

=== Appeals from magistrates&#x27; courts ===

The Crown Court can hear appeals against conviction, sentence or both from those convicted in the magistrates&#x27; courts.

Under this procedure, the Crown Court has the power to confirm, reject or alter any part of a decision. It may impose any sentence within the powers of a magistrate.

In 2015 the Crown Court heard 11,348 appeals and the average waiting time was 8.8 weeks in 2015.

=== Sentencing committals from magistrates&#x27; courts ===
Defendants may be committed from a magistrates&#x27; court where its sentencing powers are inadequate. This could be because:

* The combination of convictions exceeds 12 months&#x27; custody
* The conviction requires more than 12 months&#x27; custody

Committals may also arise from breaches of the terms of a Community Order or a suspended custodial sentence.

In 2015, the Crown Court dealt with 30,802 cases for sentencing from the magistrates&#x27; courts.

==Appealing Crown Court decisions==
From Crown Court trials on indictment, appeal lies to the criminal division of the Court of Appeal and thence to the Supreme Court.

In all other cases, appeal from the Crown Court lies by way of case stated to a Divisional Court of the High Court.

==People==

=== Judges ===
The judges who normally sit in the Crown Court are High Court judges, circuit judges and recorders.

* The most serious cases (treason, murder, rape etc.) may be allocated to High Court judges and senior circuit judges. 
* Appeals against conviction or sentence arising from the magistrates’ courts are normally heard by a circuit judge or a recorder sitting with one or two experienced magistrates. 
* The remainder of cases are dealt with by circuit judges and recorders, although recorders will normally handle less serious work than circuit judges.

Allocation of cases is conducted according to directions given by the Lord Chief Justice.

=== Advocates ===
Higher rights of audience are required to speak in the Crown Court. This means that only barristers, solicitor advocates, and some chartered legal executives can represent clients.

Solicitors may choose to attend hearings, but they are not able to speak directly.

=== Court staff ===
The court is primarily administered by the Clerk of Court, who wears a white collar/bib with bands and a black gown. They are assisted by the Court Usher, who is the only person that will move when the court is in session and will wear a gown over standard business dress.

=== Court dress ===
Court dress is almost always worn, although wigs may be removed during exceptional circumstances when directed by the judge - for example, when children are testifying.

==Courtroom layout==

There are several physical elements to a Crown Court. From the position of the defendant:

* The judge sits on a large bench at the very back of the court. Above will be a Royal Coat of Arms.
* In front of the judge will be the desk of the Clerk of Court, facing the court. There may also be a desk for the Usher here.
* In front of the Clerk&#x27;s desk will be the advocates&#x27; seating, facing the judge. This may take the form of one long bench or two separate benches, and may even be the same physical desk as the Clerk&#x27;s. The defence will always sit closest to the jury.
* On one side of the advocates&#x27; seating will be the jury box, facing inwards.
* On the other side of the advocates&#x27; seating will be the witness stand, facing the jury box. There may be a &#x27;screen&#x27; - normally a curtain - to hide the witness from the defendant, to make it easier to testify.
* Behind the advocates&#x27; seating will be instructing solicitors&#x27; seating.
* Behind the instructing solicitors&#x27; seating will be additional seating for paralegals or probation representatives, as well as a bench for authorised press reporters.
* Behind all of this is the dock, a partitioned area for the defendant(s). There will normally be direct access to the court&#x27;s cells from here, often through a door leading downstairs.
* Behind the dock, and sometimes alongside other seating but facing inwards, will be additional seating for police officers, family, and other people relevant to the case.
* Behind this, or often above on a balcony, will be the public gallery.

Different courts may have different layouts. Some, often older courts may have very compact layouts - like Gloucester Crown Court - or some, often newer courts may be very spacious.

Some courts may have a circular layout, but the overall positioning of elements will remain the same.

<text>Absolute Power is a British comedy programme, set in the offices of Prentiss McCabe, a fictional public relations company (or &#x27;government-media relations consultancy&#x27;) in London, run by Charles Prentiss (Stephen Fry) and Martin McCabe (John Bird).

It started in 2000 on BBC Radio 4, lasting until 2004 with the fourth and final radio series. A six-part television series ran on BBC Two towards the end of 2003; the second six-episode television series ran on BBC Two on Thursdays at 10 pm from 21 July to 25 August 2005. A one-off radio episode was broadcast on 3 November 2006.

The title is taken from a quotation by the historian Lord Acton: &quot;power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely&quot;.

==Radio version==

The programme was devised and written by Mark Tavener, and logically follows the programme &quot;In the Red&quot;, &quot;In the Balance&quot;, &quot;In the Chair&quot;, and &quot;In the End&quot; which he wrote with Peter Baynham. In some of these, Prentiss and McCabe (again played by Fry and Bird) are elevated members of the BBC, before getting kicked out. Indeed, there is a scene on the last page of the novel &quot;In the Red&quot;, in which the newly appointed director general of the BBC gives them the sack.
The idea is that after this they created Prentiss McCabe, which is the subject of &quot;Absolute Power&quot;. The tone and style of &quot;Absolute Power&quot; is so different from the &quot;In the...&quot; series that it can be regarded as a totally different programme. It was produced, like so much of Tavener&#x27;s work, by Dawn Ellis.

Prentiss is a man without morals, whose only objectives are money and power. He is portrayed as being the brains, while McCabe, though an excellent speech-writer, lacks his motivation and insight. McCabe&#x27;s ambitions include retiring and drinking claret, and he spends his life in a state of cynicism, lack of energy and boredom. McCabe (who describes himself as &quot;a first class mind&quot;) does sometimes have good ideas, but they usually become Prentiss&#x27;s ideas by the time they are presented to the client, and he lacks the energy to make more than mild objections. McCabe is also more likely to baulk at a scheme for moral reasons than Prentiss.

Stephen Fry said of Charles Prentiss, &quot;He&#x27;s a brute of a man, out to win, with no morals; he&#x27;s completely shameless. There&#x27;s not much to say that&#x27;s nice about him, except that there is some pleasure in watching a natural born killer at work and knowing whatever happens he will win&quot;.

Prentiss and McCabe often find themselves working on behalf of two rival clients, one of whom is often the shadier side of the Labour government, often called their &quot;Downing Street Retainer&quot;. This is usually something of an inconvenience as Prentiss is met by Archie Hilditch (Tony Gardner, Alex Lowe), a faceless member of the government, in a deserted location (such as Frank Dobson&#x27;s campaign headquarters), and told he needs to ruin the popularity of the organisation that he has spent half the programme building up. For example, in one episode they&#x27;re employed by the government to increase the popularity of the European Union, while also being employed by the Eurosceptic newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot; to increase sales. It is probably a good thing in the end, as the firm relies on these payments since neither Prentiss nor McCabe seems to want to do any real work.

The third member of the company is Sandy (Siobhan Hayes), who is there as the office trainee, getting work experience for her NVQ level 2. She usually does all the work that the partners in the firm cannot be bothered to do, such as filling out thousands of public opinion polls in different handwritings, though she will only agree to do something if it can be twisted into one of the &#x27;nine levels of competence&#x27; of her NVQ. Another member of the office is the useless Clive (Tom George) or as Martin calls him, &#x27;young, er, thing&#x27;, who often turns publicity stunts into bloodbaths. He first appears in series three, after Sandy leaves the company to become a nurse (although due to her fiddling with the accounts, she still gets paid).

Another regular character is Maurice, the waiter at McCabe&#x27;s club. Each time he serves McCabe&#x27;s claret, he corrects the English pronunciation of Maurice (Morris) to the French (Maur-ees), and each time Prentiss puts him down with a verse like &quot;One man by circumstance is in splendour set; whilst another irons pants in a laundrette. Go and iron my pants, Morris&quot;.

In series 1, one of the running jokes is the company trying to avoid working on &quot;The Sir Harold Dixon Account.&quot; Although he is never heard, it is known that he is a Conservative politician. As the series goes on, Sandy becomes more frustrated, and in the last episode she changes jobs and starts working for Sir Harold. However, after allegations of sleaze, Sir Harold is made bankrupt and Sandy returns to Prentiss McCabe.

In series 2, another character was created, Gayle Shand, played by Tamsin Greig. Gayle was a former employee of Prentiss McCabe and Charles&#x27;s former girlfriend, with whom she had a heavily sexual relationship (they often made love whilst listening to classical music). However, the relationship fell apart after Gayle told Charles that she was already married to an insect specialist from Philadelphia. She now runs a rival firm to Prentiss McCabe, which is a much larger company, and is often trying to win Archie&#x27;s contract, or is the agent of a rival client to Prentiss McCabe&#x27;s current one. For example, whilst Charles and Martin work for the PM via Archie, Gayle is the spin doctor for the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Prentiss McCabe always come up with a plan to keep Archie on their side, despite Gayle&#x27;s attempts to stop them, even trying to make Charles a partner in her firm.

Also introduced was her assistant, Janice, who suspected that Gayle&#x27;s personal rivalry with Charles did not lead to the best decisions.

In the last episode of series 2, Gayle was leaving for America, and made one last bet with Charles. She bet her company against Charles&#x27;s testicles that he could not make the Home Secretary say &quot;prison doesn&#x27;t work&quot;. Despite Charles&#x27;s best attempts, Gayle won because she bribed the Home Secretary, as she was having an affair with someone in the Home Office. Luckily, she called off the bet providing Charles could make love to her to the tune of the 1812 overture. Charles managed to get his own back, however, by planting some class A drugs in her suitcase as she left for America. Charles may nevertheless still have some feelings for her, and sometimes reminisces about their relationship.

A one-off special episode was broadcast on 3 November 2006, with Tony Gardner playing Archie. In the special, Martin goes to jail for seven years for fraud (having been implicated in the Cash for Peerages scandal). Archie, who has left New Labour, then blackmails Charles into giving him a job to prevent any more embarrassing information getting out about the company.

However, Charles soon learns that in fact Archie has framed both Martin and himself, with the assistance of Martin&#x27;s girlfriend, and they are planning to take over Prentiss McCabe. After Charles finds proof, Archie goes to jail and Martin gets released, but as he has been moved to an open prison, he does not feel like leaving too soon.

The radio series is sometimes repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra as part of the &quot;Comedy Club&quot; hour.

===Hutton Report===
The first episode of series 4 was controversially edited because of references to the Hutton Report. The words &quot;manipulation and lying&quot; were cut from Prentiss&#x27;s line: &quot;There&#x27;s nothing Prentiss McCabe can teach this prime minister about deception, manipulation and lying, except how to do it properly&quot;.

==TV programme==

The television programme was written by Guy Andrews, Mark Lawson and Andrew Rattenbury, and had the tag &quot;spin is dead, long live PR&quot;. Unlike most radio to TV sitcom transfers, none of the TV episodes was based on a radio episode. There are many differences to the radio version. Prentiss McCabe is a much more powerful and respected organisation than in the radio series. Martin McCabe is much more worldly wise. The secret meetings with government representatives are gone and replaced with more cups of coffee with newspaper editors and private secretaries.

While the radio programme has one trainee, the TV version has several young professionals working at the agency. Most notable are Jamie Front (James Lance) and Alison Jackman (Zoe Telford). While Jamie is a brilliant liar and naturally devious, Alison is very intelligent but too honest and somewhat literal-minded. Charles Prentiss said of her, &quot;Most of the young people here at Prentiss McCabe don&#x27;t know their arse from their elbow, but with Alison, at least you know she&#x27;ll join the Royal Arse Society and get a book about elbows from the library&quot;. Also in the firm are Cat Durnford (Sally Bretton), the young party girl, and Nick Mayer (Nick Burns), Charles&#x27;s personal assistant.

Instead of political schemes, the agency concentrates on working with celebrities: something that is rare in the radio version. In the radio episode where McCabe works with a Big Brother contestant, this is shown as an exceptional event, but would be normal behaviour in the TV series. Contrariwise, in the TV episode &quot;The House of Lords&quot;, Charles is mildly surprised to be contacted by a government spin doctor.

===The London bombings===
Owing to the terrorist attacks on London on 7 and 21 July 2005, the first episode of the second series (in which a member of the bin Laden family attempted to buy British Airways) was replaced by an episode from later in the series. The bin Laden episode was aired several weeks later.

<doc id="572665" wikidata="Q2758142" url="?curid=572665" title="Les Inrockuptibles">
<text>Les Inrockuptibles (), abbreviated as Les Inrocks, is a French cultural magazine. Started as a monthly in 1986, it became weekly in 1995. As of 2021, it returned to a monthly format. In the beginning, rock music was the magazine&#x27;s primary focus, though every issue included articles on other topics, generally with a left-wing perspective. Its name is a blend of the words &quot;rock&quot; and &quot;incorruptibles&quot; and a spoonerism of the latter.

The magazine has produced several tribute records, including &quot;I&#x27;m Your Fan&quot; to Leonard Cohen in 1991, &quot;The Smiths Is Dead&quot; in 1996, and &quot;Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited&quot; in 2006. Since 1988, it has included CD compilations as part of individual issues.

Guillaume B. Decherf, a music critic and journalist for the magazine, was killed during the November 2015 Paris attacks at an Eagles of Death Metal concert at the Bataclan. In 2017, the magazine drew controversy for featuring the singer Bertrand Cantat, who murdered French actress Marie Trintignant, on its front cover. After public outrage and a critical editorial published by &quot;Elle France&quot;, the magazine issued an apology.

There is a Spanish-language edition of the magazine made in Argentina, named &quot;Los Inrockuptibles&quot;.

<text>Josef Korbel (; September 20, 1909 – July 18, 1977) was a Czech-American diplomat and political scientist. During his public career, he served as Czechoslovakia&#x27;s ambassador to Yugoslavia and was the country&#x27;s representative to the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan, serving as its chair. After settling down in the United States, Korbel became a professor of international politics at the University of Denver, where he founded the Graduate School of International Studies, which was later named after him, and served as its first dean.

His daughter, Madeleine Albright, served as Secretary of State under President Bill Clinton, and he was the mentor of President George W. Bush&#x27;s Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice. His granddaughter, Alice P. Albright, is serving as CEO of the Millennium Challenge Corporation under President Joe Biden.

==Background and career==
Josef was born under the family name Körbel on September 20, 1909 to Czech-Jewish parents Arnost and Olga Körbel, both of whom were killed in the Holocaust. He married Anna Spiegelová on April 20, 1935. They had met in secondary school around 1928. Anna was born in 1910 to Alfred Spiegel and Růžena Spiegelová, assimilated Czech Jews. Her parents gave her the common Czech nickname of Andula. Korbel called her Mandula, a portmanteau of &quot;Má Andula&quot; (Czech for &quot;My Andula&quot;), while Anna called him Jozka.

At the time of their daughter Madeleine&#x27;s birth, Josef was serving as press-attaché at the Czechoslovak Embassy in Belgrade.

Though he served as a diplomat in the government of Czechoslovakia, Korbel&#x27;s politics and Judaism forced him to flee with his wife and baby Madeleine after the Nazi invasion in 1939 and move to London. Korbel served as an advisor to Edvard Beneš, in the Czech government in exile. He gave speeches for the BBC&#x27;s daily broadcasts to Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. During their time in England the Korbels converted to Catholicism and dropped the umlaut from the family name, resulting in the second syllable of &quot;Korbel&quot; being stressed.

Korbel returned to Czechoslovakia after the war, receiving a luxurious Prague apartment expropriated from Karl Nebrich, a Bohemian German industrialist expelled under the Beneš decrees. Korbel was appointed as the Czechoslovak ambassador to Yugoslavia, where he remained until the Communist coup in Czechoslovakia in February 1948. Around this time, he was named a delegate to the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan to mediate on the Kashmir dispute. He served as its chair, and subsequently wrote several articles and a book on the Kashmir problem.

Following the Communist Party&#x27;s rise to power in 1948, in 1949 Korbel applied for political asylum in the United States stating that he would be arrested in Czechoslovakia for his &quot;faithful adherence to the ideals of democracy.&quot; He received asylum and also a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to teach international politics at the University of Denver. In 1964, with the benefaction of Ben Cherrington, Korbel established the Graduate School of International Studies and became its founding Dean. One of his students was Condoleezza Rice, the first woman appointed National Security Advisor (2001) and the first African-American woman appointed Secretary of State (2005). Korbel&#x27;s daughter Madeleine became the first female Secretary of State in 1997. Both of them have testified to his substantial influence on their careers in foreign policy and international relations.

After his death, the University of Denver established the Josef Korbel Humanitarian Award in 2000. Since then, 28 people have received it.

The Graduate School of International Studies at the University of Denver was named the Josef Korbel School of International Studies on May 28, 2008.

===&quot;Danger in Kashmir&quot;===
Norman Palmer notes in a review of Korbel&#x27;s book &quot;Danger in Kashmir&quot; that Korbel covers the same ground as Michael Brecher. Yashina Tarr sees that Korbel has succeeded in providing an objective assessment of the United Nations&#x27; work and recommends it to readers. Birdwood labels the content on the United Nations Commission involvement &quot;authoritative&quot; due to Korbel&#x27;s own membership in the Commission. He also observes that the huge number of footnotes and quotations testify to Korbel&#x27;s vast research put into this &quot;valuable contribution&quot; on the Kashmir dispute. Werner Levi observes that Korbel tends to abstain from giving his own judgements and evaluations. Levi states that Korbel&#x27;s book is a &quot;comprehensive and balanced statement&quot; of a contested topic.

== Artwork ownership controversy==
Philipp Harmer, an Austrian citizen, filed a lawsuit claiming that Josef Korbel&#x27;s family is in inappropriate possession of artwork belonging to his great-grandfather, the German entrepreneur Karl Nebrich. Like most other ethnic Germans living in Czechoslovakia, Nebrich and his family were expelled from the country under the postwar &quot;Beneš decrees&quot;, and left behind artwork and furniture in an apartment subsequently given to Korbel&#x27;s family, before they also were forced to flee the country.

<text>Osprey Media L.P. was a Canadian newspaper regional chain that published 20 daily newspapers, 34 non-daily newspapers, and a number of shopping guides and magazines in the Canadian province of Ontario. Formerly an independent income trust, Osprey was taken over by Quebecor&#x27;s Sun Media division in 2007. With the sale of Sun Media to Postmedia Network a decade later, many of its former newspapers owned by Osprey today are either owned by Postmedia or Torstar.

In September 2006, the last annual release of Canadian circulation figures before the company&#x27;s takeover by Quebecor, Osprey Media&#x27;s dailies had average daily paid and unpaid circulation / distribution of approximately 340,000 copies, while its non-daily newspapers had average weekly paid and unpaid circulation / distribution of approximately 466,000 copies.

==History==
Osprey Media Group was created in 2001, when Michael Sifton, heir to the family that had once owned the &quot;Regina Leader-Post&quot; and the &quot;Saskatoon Star-Phoenix&quot;, purchased many of the Ontario newspapers that had been put on the market by Conrad Black&#x27;s Hollinger newspaper group. As a newly incorporated media group, Osprey Media&#x27;s purchase marked the first time in many years that a major newspaper sale significantly &quot;increased&quot; the diversity of newspaper ownership in Canada.

In April 2004, Osprey Media Group, motivated by tax breaks, became a subsidiary of Osprey Media Income Fund (OMIF), a unit trust. They changed their name to Osprey Media LP in January 2006 after receiving Canada Revenue Agency approval of their reorganization plans.

On May 31, 2007, it was announced that OMIF would be acquired by Quebecor Media Group for C$517 million. The announcement noted that Scotia Merchant Capital and the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan had conditionally agreed to tender units in their control which amount to over 50% of the outstanding units. According to &quot;Editor &amp; Publisher&quot;, the sale of OMIF was at least in part motivated by the pending loss of the tax advantages which had earlier led to the creation of the unit trust.

On June 27, 2007, a competing takeover offer from Black Press was also announced. On July 6, 2007, OMIF accepted a revised offer from Quebecor of C$575.8 million.

A decade after Osprey Media&#x27;s demise, Sun Media was acquired by Postmedia in 2015 after Quebecor divested of its English newspapers. Postmedia re-sold many of the former Osprey newspapers to rival Torstar in 2017 in an asset swap with some newspapers closed operation.

<doc id="572672" wikidata="Q334337" url="?curid=572672" title="David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir">
<text>David Patrick Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir, (29 May 1900 – 27 January 1967), known as Sir David Maxwell Fyfe from 1942 to 1954 and as Viscount Kilmuir from 1954 to 1962, was a British Conservative politician, lawyer and judge who combined an industrious and precocious legal career with political ambitions that took him to the offices of Solicitor General, Attorney General, Home Secretary and Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain.

One of the prosecuting counsels at the Nuremberg Trials, he subsequently played a role in drafting the European Convention on Human Rights. As Home Secretary from 1951 to 1954 he greatly increased the number of prosecutions of homosexuals in the UK, and declined to commute Derek Bentley&#x27;s death sentence for the murder of a police officer. His political ambitions were ultimately dashed in Harold Macmillan&#x27;s cabinet reshuffle of July 1962.

==Early life==
Born in Edinburgh, the only son of William Thomson Fyfe, Headmaster of Aberdeen Grammar School, by his second wife Isabella Campbell, daughter of David Campbell, of Dornoch, co. Sutherland, he was educated at George Watson&#x27;s College and Balliol College, Oxford, where, perhaps owing to his interest in politics, he achieved a third-class degree in Greats. Whilst at Oxford, he was a member of the Stubbs Society. His academic education was paused during his service in the Scots Guards in 1918–19, at the end of the World War I. After graduation, he worked for the British Commonwealth Union as political secretary to Sir Patrick Hannon MP, studying law in his spare time. He entered Gray&#x27;s Inn and was called to the bar in 1922. He became a pupil of George Lynskey in Liverpool then joined his chambers to practise. Maxwell Fyfe later wrote that his ambition was to be a silk (King&#x27;s Counsel) in his thirties, a minister in his forties and at the top of the legal profession in his fifties.

Not pausing before beginning his political career in earnest, he stood as a Conservative for Wigan in 1924, an unwinnable parliamentary seat. He cultivated the more winnable Spen Valley until 1929 when the party resolved not to oppose sitting Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) Sir John Simon while he was absent on the Simon Commission in India. Maxwell Fyfe was eventually elected to Parliament in Liverpool West Derby in a by-election in July 1935.

Meanwhile, Maxwell Fyfe&#x27;s legal career had prospered. In 1934 he became King&#x27;s Counsel. He was Recorder of Oldham from 1936 to 1942.

==Early political career==
Maxwell Fyfe, along with Patrick Spens, Derrick Gunston and others, backed the National Government over the Hoare–Laval Pact, and he supported Neville Chamberlain over the Munich Agreement. However, after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, Maxwell Fyfe joined the Territorial Army and, at the outbreak of World War II in September, he was deployed to the Judge Advocate-General&#x27;s department with rank of major. He was badly injured in an air raid in September 1940. In May 1941 Maxwell Fyfe became deputy to Rab Butler&#x27;s chairmanship of the Conservative Party Post War Problems Committee to draft policies for after the war. He took over as chairman from Butler between July 1943 and August 1944 while Butler was busy passing the Education Act 1944 (see Political career of Rab Butler (1941–1951)).

==Into government and on to Nuremberg==

In March 1942, Sir Winston Churchill, on the advice of Brendan Bracken, appointed Maxwell Fyfe Solicitor-General. At the same time he was knighted and sworn of the Privy Council. He applied himself to his work in the wartime coalition government with enormous industry and began some of the thinking and planning about how the leaders of the Nazi regime in Germany might be brought to account after the war. As part of his duties, on 8 April 1945, he attended an Anglo-American discussion over the war crimes trial, at which, says the historian Richard Overy, &quot;he presented the standard British argument for summary execution.&quot; Whether Maxwell Fyfe believed such executions were the best method of dealing with the Nazis may be doubted, in view of his later work at the Nuremberg Trials; at the time, however, as a member of the government he had little choice but to follow the lead of the Prime Minister, Churchill, who repeatedly urged that summary justice be visited upon the Nazi leaders. When the war in Europe ended and the coalition was dissolved in May 1945, Maxwell Fyfe was briefly Attorney-General in Churchill&#x27;s caretaker government.

The Labour Party won a landslide victory in the United Kingdom general election of 1945 and Sir Hartley Shawcross became Attorney General and took responsibility as Britain&#x27;s chief prosecutor in the Nuremberg Trials. Shawcross, to emphasise the non-partisan nature of the trials, appointed Maxwell Fyfe his deputy. Shawcross was largely committed to his political duties in Westminster and played little part other than delivering the opening and closing speeches. Maxwell Fyfe took on most of the day-to-day responsibilities as &quot;capable lawyer, efficient administrator and concerned housemaster&quot;. There were misgivings in some quarters as to how Fyfe would perform, cross-examination not being regarded as one of his strengths. However, his cross-examination of Hermann Göring was one of the most noted cross-examinations in history.

==Opposition==
After Nuremberg, Maxwell Fyfe returned to Parliament to shadow the Minister of Labour while simultaneously pursuing a full, busy and prominent career at the Bar, for example defending serial murderer John George Haigh in 1949. Reputedly, he would arrive at the House of Commons at around 5.00 pm, often stay throughout debates that lasted all night then, after a quick shave and breakfast, leave for court. He was assisted in his punishing schedule by his wife Sylvia, herself a Conservative Party worker. In 1945–51 he earned an annual average of £25,000. 

Maxwell Fyfe played a leading role in drafting the party&#x27;s Industrial Charter of 1947 and chaired the committee into Conservative Party organisation that resulted in the Maxwell Fyfe Report (1948–49). The report shifted the responsibility of funding electoral expenditure from the candidate to the constituency party, with the intention of broadening the diversity of MPs by making it harder for local associations to demand large personal donations from candidates. In practice, it may have had the effect of lending more power to constituency parties and making candidates more uniform.

Maxwell Fyfe was a champion of European integration and a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe from August 1949 to May 1952, becoming the Chair of the Assembly&#x27;s Committee on Legal and Administrative Questions, and rapporteur on the committee drafting the European Convention on Human Rights. In his memoirs he criticised Sir Anthony Eden for a negative stance that derailed the UK&#x27;s opportunity to become a leader in Europe. Eden always rejected this and considered a libel action against Maxwell Fyfe.

==Return to government==
===Home Secretary===
Shortly before the United Kingdom general election of 1951, Maxwell Fyfe caused a stir when he appeared to hint in a radio interview that a Conservative government might legislate to curb the power of trade unions. When the Conservative Party was returned to power in the election, Churchill thought it unwise to appoint him Minister of Labour, and Maxwell Fyfe became both Home Secretary and cabinet minister for Welsh affairs. He was responsible for guiding several complicated pieces of legislation through the Commons, in particular those that established commercial television. He gained a reputation as a hard-working, thorough and reliable cabinet member.

In 1952, the Director General of MI5 (DG) was made directly answerable to the Home Secretary rather than the Prime Minister. Given this novel responsibility, Maxwell Fyfe issued the Maxwell Fyfe Directive which became the &quot;de facto&quot; constitution of the Security Service until the Security Service Act 1989 set it on a statutory basis. When Sir Percy Sillitoe resigned as DG in 1953, Maxwell Fyfe delegated the shortlisting of a successor to a committee of civil servants chaired by Sir Edward Bridges. The committee put forward Dick White and Sir Kenneth Strong. Maxwell Fyfe endorsed the committee&#x27;s preference for White, observing to Churchill that an internal appointment would be good for the morale of the service.

Fyfe&#x27;s assumption of office as Home Secretary heralded a reign of fear for male homosexuals. A stern advocate of existing legislation criminalising homosexual acts, he started a campaign to &quot;rid England of this male vice … this plague&quot; by dramatically increased arrests of male homosexuals through police surveillance and entrapment via the use of &quot;agents provocateurs&quot;, tapped telephones, forged documents and the absence of warrants. From 1,276 in prosecutions in 1939 for actual or attempted sodomy or gross indecency, a year after he had assumed the office of Home Secretary prosecutions had soared to 5,443. Fyfe subsequently sanctioned the establishment of the Wolfenden Report into homosexuality, but had he known its findings would recommend decriminalisation, it is unlikely he would have done so.

A conservative on the death penalty, Kilmuir was likewise conservative on the issue of homosexual rights, and led the opposition in the House of Lords to the implementation of the Wolfenden Committee report, which had recommended the decriminalisation of homosexual acts between consenting adults.

This was ironic, says Geraldine Bedell, since it was he, while Home Secretary, who had set up the committee to consider whether the law should be changed. As Bedell also notes: &quot;Perhaps he thought, by handing over to a committee, to shelve the issue. Perhaps he assumed Wolfenden would find against, in which case, he chose a curious chairman, because Wolfenden had a gay son, Jeremy.&quot; Kilmuir still opposed liberalisation when a bill was introduced in the Lords (by Lord Arran) in 1965. Says Bedell: &quot;For the opposition, Lord Kilmuir warned against licensing the &#x27;buggers&#x27; clubs&#x27; which he claimed were operating behind innocent-looking doors all over London.&quot; Maxwell Fyfe told the Conservative backbencher Sir Robert Boothby, who was known in parliamentary circles to be bisexual, that it was not his intention to legalise homosexuality: &quot;I am not going down in history&quot;, he told Boothby, &quot;as the man who made sodomy legal.&quot;

During his tenure as Home Secretary, he was embroiled in the controversy surrounding the hanging of Derek Bentley. Maxwell Fyfe had controversially refused to grant a reprieve to Bentley despite the written petitions of 200 MPs and the claim that Bentley was mentally retarded allegedly having a mental age of only 11. However, on most issues he was on the progressive wing of the Conservative Party, opposing the proposals in 1953 for the re-introduction of corporal punishment.

===Lord Chancellor===
Maxwell Fyfe remained ambitious and a &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; opinion poll in 1954, on the popular favourite to succeed Churchill as Party leader and prime minister, had him behind Eden and Butler but well ahead of Macmillan. In his memoirs (&quot;Political Adventure&quot;, p233) he later wrote that he had hoped to emerge as a compromise leader like Bonar Law in 1911 if Eden and Butler, both of whom he regarded as personal friends, found themselves in a dead heat. However, once it was clear that Eden was to be Churchill&#x27;s successor, he sought the office of Lord Chancellor.

On 19 October 1954 he was raised to the peerage as Viscount Kilmuir, of Creich in the County of Sutherland, and moved to the House of Lords and the &quot;woolsack&quot;. Lord Kilmuir was a political Lord Chancellor, not restricting himself to his judicial role. He worked on many government issues including the constitution of Malta, which he wanted to become part of the UK, and the creation of the Restrictive Practices Court. In his eight years in the post he only sat as a judge on 24 appeals to the House of Lords. Lord Kilmuir opposed Sydney Silverman&#x27;s 1956 private member&#x27;s bill to abolish capital punishment. He described it as &quot;an unwise and dangerous measure, the presence of which on the statute book would be a disaster for the country and a menace to the people&quot;. However, Kilmuir chaired the cabinet committee that recommended limiting the death penalty&#x27;s scope and which led to the Homicide Act 1957. He feared the consequences of immigration to the United Kingdom and presented a report to the cabinet in 1956. Lord Kilmuir contended that the military intervention in the 1956 Suez Crisis was justified under the self-defence provisions of of the United Nations Charter.

He continued in this office in the governments of Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan until Macmillan&#x27;s 1962 &quot;Night of the Long Knives&quot;, when he was abruptly replaced by Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller, the Attorney-General. Kilmuir was made Baron Fyfe of Dornoch, of Dornoch in the County of Sutherland, and Earl of Kilmuir on 20 July 1962 to cushion the blow of retirement. He is said to have complained to Macmillan that he was being sacked with less notice than would be given to a cook, to which Macmillan replied that it was easier to get Lord Chancellors than good cooks.

==After government==
After government, Kilmuir joined the board of directors of Plessey but his health soon declined. He died at Withyham, Sussex, on 27 January 1967 and was cremated. His ashes were buried at the church of St Michael and All Angels at Withyham. His wealth at death was £22,202. His titles, which could pass only to sons, became extinct, as he had fathered only daughters.

==Family and personality==
He married Sylvia Harrison in 1925 and they had three daughters, one of whom pre-deceased him. Lalage Fyfe (b. 1926, d. 1944) and Pamela Maxwell Fyfe (b. 1928). His brother-in-law was the actor Sir Rex Harrison.

Kilmuir was a formidable parliamentary presence on behalf of his party, and his remarkable memory compensated for a dull speaking style, though he was capable of passion when the circumstances were right. In appearance, &quot;His body was pear-shaped, and beneath a large square bald head there were dark heavy eyebrows and a face of middle-eastern pallor and swarthiness&quot;.

As Home Secretary, he often travelled to Wales, and in the valleys of South Wales he was nicknamed &quot;Dai Bananas&quot;, Fyffes being, then as now, one of Britain&#x27;s major importers of the fruit.

<doc id="572684" wikidata="Q411814" url="?curid=572684" title="Aja (album)">
<text>Aja (, pronounced &quot;Asia&quot;) is the sixth studio album by the American rock band Steely Dan, released on September 23, 1977, by ABC Records. For the album, band leaders Donald Fagen and Walter Becker pushed Steely Dan further into experimenting with different combinations of session players, enlisting the services of nearly 40 musicians, while pursuing longer, more sophisticated compositions and arrangements.

The album peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, and number five on the UK Albums Chart, ultimately becoming Steely Dan&#x27;s most commercially successful release. It spawned the hit singles &quot;Peg&quot;, &quot;Deacon Blues&quot;, and &quot;Josie&quot;. At the 20th Annual Grammy Awards, &quot;Aja&quot; won Best Engineered Recording – Non-Classical, and was nominated for Album of the Year and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. It has appeared on many retrospective &quot;greatest albums&quot; lists, with critics and audiophiles applauding the album&#x27;s high production quality. In 2010, the album was added to the National Recording Registry by Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Recording==
The album was produced by Steely Dan&#x27;s longtime producer Gary Katz, engineered by longtime master engineer Roger Nichols, and features contributions from numerous leading session musicians. The eight-minute-long title track features a jazz-based chord progression and a solo by saxophonist Wayne Shorter. Co-composer and co-band leader Walter Becker did not perform on the tracks &quot;Black Cow&quot; or &quot;Peg&quot;.

==Title and packaging==
The title of the album is pronounced &quot;Asia&quot; (like the continent). Donald Fagen has said Aja was the name of a Korean woman who married the brother of one of his high-school friends. The album cover features a photograph by Hideki Fujii of Japanese model and actress Sayoko Yamaguchi, and was designed by Patricia Mitsui and Geoff Westen. The inside photos of Fagen and Becker were taken by Becker and Dorothy A. White.

==Marketing and sales==
&quot;Aja&quot; was released by ABC Records on September 23, 1977. In anticipation of the release, Katz urged the relatively private Fagen and Becker to raise their public profile, and arranged a meeting with Irving Azoff to discuss employing him as their manager. Fagen initially had reservations, saying: &quot;We were ready to go blissfully through life without a manager.&quot;

With Azoff&#x27;s connections with record stores and the album being offered at a discounted price, &quot;Aja&quot; became, according to Cameron Crowe in the December 1977 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;one of the season&#x27;s hottest albums and by far Steely Dan&#x27;s fastest-selling ever.&quot; It reached the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart within three weeks of its release, and it ultimately peaked at number three, becoming the band&#x27;s highest-charting album in the United States. The album was also the group&#x27;s highest-charting album in the UK, reaching number five on the UK Albums Chart. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;Aja&quot; was Steely Dan&#x27;s biggest hit and was one of the first albums to be given the then-new Platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for one million US sales.

Attempts to make a surround-sound mix of the album for a release in the late 1990s were scrapped when it was discovered that the multitrack masters for both &quot;Black Cow&quot; and the title track were missing. Universal Music canceled plans to release a multichannel SACD version of the album for the same reason. In the liner notes for the 1999 remastered reissue of the album, Fagen and Becker offered a $600 reward for the missing masters or any information that would lead to their recovery.

==Reception and legacy==

Reviewing the album in 1977 for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Michael Duffy said that &quot;the conceptual framework of [Steely Dan&#x27;s] music has shifted from the pretext of rock &amp; roll toward a smoother, awesomely clean and calculated mutation of various rock, pop and jazz idioms&quot;, while their lyrics &quot;remain as pleasantly obtuse and cynical as ever&quot;. He added that the duo&#x27;s &quot;extreme intellectual self-consciousness&quot;, though it might be starting to show its limitations with this album, &quot;may be precisely the quality that makes Walter Becker and Donald Fagen the perfect musical antiheroes for the Seventies.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote that he &quot;hated this record for quite a while before I realized that, unlike &quot;The Royal Scam&quot;, it was stretching me some&quot;, and noted that he was &quot;grateful to find Fagen and Becker&#x27;s collegiate cynicism in decline&quot;, but worried that a preference for longer, more sophisticated songs &quot;could turn into their fatal flaw&quot;. Greg Kot was also lukewarm toward the band&#x27;s stylistic departure, later writing in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;: &quot;The clinical coldness first evidenced on &quot;The Royal Scam&quot; is perfected here. Longer, more languid songs replace the acerbic pithiness of old.&quot; Barry Walters was more receptive in a retrospective review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, saying: &quot;rock has always excelled at embodying adolescent ache. But it&#x27;s rare when rock captures the complications of adult sorrows almost purely with its sound.&quot;

Jazz historian Ted Gioia has cited &quot;Aja&quot; as an example of Steely Dan &quot;proving that pop-rock could equally benefit from a healthy dose of jazz&quot; during their original tenure, which coincided with a period when rock musicians were frequently experimenting with jazz idioms and techniques. Amanda Petrusich wrote in &quot;Pitchfork&quot; that the album is &quot;as much a jazz record as a pop one&quot;, while Ben Ratliff from &quot;The New York Times&quot; said it &quot;created a new standard for the relationship between jazz and rock, one that was basically irreproducible, by Steely Dan or anyone else [...] a progressive jazz record with backbeats, a &#x27;70s hipster&#x27;s extension of what had been Gil Evans&#x27;s vision two decades earlier.&quot; In Dylan Jones&#x27; list of the best jazz albums for &quot;GQ&quot;, &quot;Aja&quot; ranked number 62.

The album has been cited by music journalists as one of the best test recordings for audiophiles, due to its high production standards. Walters noted in his review that &quot;the album&#x27;s surreal sonic perfection, its melodic and harmonic complexity - music so technically demanding its creators had to call in A-list session players to realize the sounds they heard in their heads but could not play, even on the instruments they had mastered.&quot; Reviewing &quot;Aja&quot;″s 2007 all-analog LP reissue, Ken Kessler of the &quot;Hi-Fi News &amp; Record Review&quot; gave top marks to both the recording and performance qualities, and called the album &quot;sublime jazz-rock that hasn&#x27;t aged at all - unless you consider &#x27;intelligence&#x27; passe - it is everything you expected the painfully hip/cool Becker and Fagen to deliver.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Aja&quot; has appeared on retrospective &quot;greatest albums&quot; lists. In 1991, France&#x27;s &quot;Rock &amp; Folk&quot; included it on a list of the 250 best albums released since 1966, when the magazine began publication. In 1999, the album was ranked number 59 on the national Israeli newspaper &quot;Yedioth Ahronoth&quot;″s &quot;Top 99 Albums of All Time&quot; list. In 2000, &quot;Aja&quot; was voted number 118 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;, where the author noted its &quot;brand of jazz-influenced white soul&quot;. In 2003, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and ranked number 145 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;; it maintained the same spot on the 2012 update of the list, and rose to number 63 on the 2020 version. In 2006, &quot;Aja&quot; was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2010, the album was recognized by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry; the same year, De La Soul&#x27;s 1989 debut album &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot;, which sampled &quot;Aja&quot;, was also added to the Registry.

The singer Bilal listed &quot;Aja&quot; among his top-25 favorite albums, explaining that &quot;It&#x27;s a great body of work. It seems very thought out from beginning to end, every song just had a certain vibe. The songwriting to the sound and the look of the album, the whole package was just very well thought out.&quot;

===&quot;Classic Albums&quot; episode===
In 1999, &quot;Aja&quot; was the topic of an episode of the British documentary series &quot;Classic Albums&quot;. The episode features a song-by-song study of the album (except for &quot;I Got the News&quot;, which is played during the closing credits), as well as interviews with, among others, Steely Dan co-founders Walter Becker and Donald Fagen, and new, live-in-studio versions of songs from the album, with a band made up of Bernard Purdie, Chuck Rainey, Paul Griffin, who all played on &quot;Aja&quot;, and with their new guitar player Jon Herington. Becker and Fagen also play back several of the rejected guitar solos for &quot;Peg&quot;, which were recorded before Jay Graydon produced the take used for the album.

Discussing the sound of the album, Andy Gill says: &quot;Jazz-rock was a fundamental part of the 70s musical landscape [...] [Steely Dan] wasn&#x27;t rock or pop music with ideas above its station, and it wasn&#x27;t jazzers slumming [...] it was a very well-forged alloy of the two – you couldn&#x27;t separate the pop music from the jazz in their music.&quot; On the same topic, British musician Ian Dury says he hears elements of legendary jazz musicians like Charlie Parker, Charles Mingus, and Art Blakey on the album. He continues: &quot;Well, &quot;Aja&quot;″s got a sound that lifts your heart up, and it&#x27;s the most consistent up-full, heart-warming [...] even though, it is a classic LA kinda sound. You wouldn&#x27;t think it was recorded anywhere else in the world. It&#x27;s got California through its blood, even though they are boys from New York [...] They&#x27;ve got a skill that can make images that aren&#x27;t puerile and don&#x27;t make you think you&#x27;ve heard it before [...] very &#x27;Hollywood filmic&#x27; in a way, the imagery is very imaginable, in a visual sense.&quot;

===Yacht rock===

In retrospective appraisals, &quot;Aja&quot; has been discussed by music journalists as an important release in the development of yacht rock. In an article for &quot;Spin&quot; in 2009, Chuck Eddy listed it among the genre&#x27;s eight essential albums. Writing for &quot;uDiscoverMusic&quot; in 2019, Paul Sexton said that, with the album, Steely Dan &quot;announced their ever-greater exploration of jazz influences&quot;, which would lead to &quot;their yacht-rock masterpiece&quot;: 1980&#x27;s &quot;Gaucho&quot;. Patrick Hosken of MTV News said that both &quot;Aja&quot; and &quot;Gaucho&quot; show how &quot;great yacht rock is also more musically ambitious than it might seem, tying blue-eyed soul and jazz to funk and R&amp;B&quot;. &quot;Aja&quot; was included in &quot;Vinyl Me, Please&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 10 Best Yacht Rock Albums to Own on Vinyl&quot;, with an accompanying essay that said: &quot;Steely Dan&#x27;s importance to yacht rock can&#x27;t be overstated. [...] Arguably the Dan is smoothest on the 1980 smash &quot;Gaucho&quot;, but &quot;Aja&quot; finds Walter Becker and Donald Fagen comfortably hitting a middle-ground stride [...] as a mainstream hit factory while remaining expansive and adventurous&quot;. John Lawler of &quot;Something Else!&quot; wrote that &quot;The song and performance that best exemplifies the half-time, funky, laid (way) back in the beat shuffle within the jazz-pop environment of the mid- to late- 70s can be found on &#x27;Home at Last.&#x27; Bernard &#x27;Pretty&#x27; Purdie feeds off Chuck Rainey&#x27;s bass with righteous grooves and masterful off-beat fills with alacrity in this tight band favorite.&quot;

<text>Base32 (also known as duotrigesimal) is an encoding method based on the base-32 numeral system. It uses an alphabet of 32 digits, each of which represents a different combination of 5 bits (25). Since base32 is not very widely adopted, the question of notation—which characters to use to represent the 32 digits—is not as settled as in the case of more well-known numeral systems (such as hexadecimal), though RFCs and unofficial and de-facto standards exist. One way to represent Base32 numbers in human-readable form is using digits 0–9 followed by the twenty-two upper-case letters A–V. However, many other variations are used in different contexts. Historically, Baudot code could be considered a modified (stateful) base32 code. Base32 is often used to represent byte strings.

== RFC 4648 encodings ==
The October 2006 proposed Internet standard documents base16, base32 and base64 encodings. It includes two schemes for base32, but recommends one over the other. It further recommends that regardless of precedent, only the alphabet it defines in its section 6 actually be called base32, and that the other similar alphabet in its section 7 instead be called base32hex. Agreement with those recommendations is not universal. Care needs to be taken when using systems that are called base32, as those systems could be base32 per RFC 4648 §6, or per §7 (possibly disregarding that RFC&#x27;s deprecation of the simpler name for the latter), or they could be yet another encoding variant, see further below.

=== Base 32 Encoding per §6 ===
The most widely used base32 alphabet is defined in RFC 4648 §6 and the earlier (2003). The scheme was originally designed in 2000 by John Myers for SASL/GSSAPI. It uses an alphabet of A–Z, followed by 2–7. The digits 0, 1 and 8 are skipped due to their similarity with the letters O, I and B (thus &quot;2&quot; has a decimal value of 26).

In some circumstances padding is not required or used (the padding can be inferred from the length of the string modulo 8). RFC 4648 states that padding must be used unless the specification of the standard (referring to the RFC) explicitly states otherwise. Excluding padding is useful when using Base32 encoded data in URL tokens or file names where the padding character could pose a problem.

This is an example of a Base32 representation using the previously described 32-character set (IPFS CIDv1 in Base32 upper-case encoding): 

=== Base 32 Encoding with Extended Hex Alphabet per §7 ===
&quot;Extended hex&quot; base 32 or base32hex, another scheme for base 32 per RFC 4648 §7, extends hexadecimal in a more natural way: Its lower half is identical with hexadecimal, and beyond that, base32hex simply continues the alphabet through to the letter V.

This scheme was first proposed by Christian Lanctot, a programmer working at Sage software, in a letter to &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s&quot; magazine in March 1999 as part of a suggested solution for the Y2K bug. Lanctot referred to it as &quot;Double Hex&quot;. The same alphabet was described in 2000 in under the name &quot;Base-32&quot;. RFC 4648, while acknowledging existing use of this version in NSEC3, refers to it as base32hex and discourages referring to it as only &quot;base32&quot;.

Since this notation uses digits 0-9 followed by consecutive letters of the alphabet, it matches the digits used by the JavaScript codice_1 function and the Python codice_2 constructor when a base larger than 10 (such as 16 or 32) is specified. It also retains hexadecimal&#x27;s property of preserving bitwise sort order of the represented data, unlike RFC 4648&#x27;s §6 base32, or base64.

Unlike many other base 32 notation systems, base32hex digits beyond 9 are contiguous. However, its set of digits includes characters that may visually conflict. With the right font it is possible to visually distinguish between 0, O and 1, I, but other fonts may be unsuitable, as those letters could be hard for humans to tell apart, especially when the context English usually provides is not present in a notation system that is only expressing numbers. The choice of font is not controlled by notation or encoding, yet base32hex makes no attempt to compensate for the shortcomings of affected fonts.

== Alternative encoding schemes ==
Changing the Base32 alphabet, all alternative standards have similar combinations of alphanumeric symbols.

=== z-base-32 ===
z-base-32 is a Base32 encoding designed by Zooko Wilcox-O&#x27;Hearn to be easier for human use and more compact. It includes 1, 8 and 9 but excludes l, v, 0 and 2. It also permutes the alphabet so that the easier characters are the ones that occur more frequently. It compactly encodes bitstrings whose length in bits is not a multiple of 8 and omits trailing padding characters. z-base-32 was used in the Mnet open source project, and is currently used in Phil Zimmermann&#x27;s ZRTP protocol, and in the Tahoe-LAFS open source project.

=== Crockford&#x27;s Base32 ===
Another alternative design for Base32 is created by Douglas Crockford, who proposes using additional characters for a mod-37 checksum. It excludes the letters I, L, and O to avoid confusion with digits. It also excludes the letter U to reduce the likelihood of accidental obscenity.

Libraries to encode binary data in Crockford&#x27;s Base32 are available in a variety of languages.

=== Electrologica ===
An earlier form of base 32 notation was used by programmers working on the Electrologica X1 to represent machine addresses. The &quot;digits&quot; were represented as decimal numbers from 0 to 31. For example, 12-16 would represent the machine address &quot;400&quot; (= 12 × 32 + 16).

=== Geohash ===
See Geohash algorithm, used to represent latitude and longitude values in one (bit-interlaced) positive integer. The base32 representation of Geohash uses all decimal digits (0–9) and almost all of the lower case alphabet, except letters &quot;a&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, as shown by the following character map:

=== Video games ===
Before NVRAM became universal, several video games for Nintendo platforms used base 31 numbers for passwords.
These systems omit vowels (except Y) to prevent the game from accidentally giving a profane password.
Thus, the characters are generally some minor variation of the following set: 0–9, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, and some punctuation marks.
Games known to use such a system include &quot;Mario Is Missing!&quot;, &quot;Mario&#x27;s Time Machine&quot;, &quot;Tetris Blast&quot;, and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (Super NES).

=== Word-safe alphabet ===

The word-safe Base32 alphabet is an extension of the Open Location Code Base20 alphabet. That alphabet uses 8 numeric digits and 12 case-sensitive letter digits chosen to avoid accidentally forming words. Treating the alphabet as case-sensitive produces a 32 (8+12+12) digit set.

==Comparisons with other systems==
=== Advantages ===
Base32 has a number of advantages over Base64:
# The resulting character set is all one case, which can often be beneficial when using a case-insensitive filesystem, DNS names, spoken language, or human memory.
# The result can be used as a file name because it cannot possibly contain the &#x27;/&#x27; symbol, which is the Unix path separator.
# The alphabet can be selected to avoid similar-looking pairs of different symbols, so the strings can be accurately transcribed by hand. (For example, the §6 symbol set omits the digits for one, eight and zero, since they could be confused with the letters &#x27;I&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, and &#x27;O&#x27;.)
# A result excluding padding can be included in a URL without encoding any characters.
Base32 has advantages over hexadecimal/Base16:
# Base32 representation takes 20% less space. (1000 bits takes 200 characters, compared with 250 for Base16.)
Compared with 8-bit-based encodings, 5-bit systems might also have advantages when used for character transmission:
# Featuring the complete alphabet, the RFC 4648 §6 Base32 scheme and similar allow encoding two more characters per 32-bit integer (for a total of 6 instead of 4, with 2 bits to spare), saving bandwidth in constrained domains such as radiomeshes.

=== Disadvantages ===
Base32 representation takes roughly 20% more space than Base64. Also, because it encodes five 8-bit bytes (40 bits) to eight 5-bit base32 characters rather than three 8-bit bytes (24 bits) to four 6-bit base64 characters, padding to an 8-character boundary is a greater burden on short messages (which may be a reason to elide padding, which is an option in ).

Even if Base32 takes roughly 20% less space than hexadecimal, Base32 is much less used. Hexadecimal can easily be mapped to bytes because two hexadecimal digits is a byte. Base32 does not map to individual bytes. However, two Base32 digits correspond to ten bits, which can encode (32 × 32 =) 1,024 values, with obvious applications for orders of magnitude of multiple-byte units in terms of powers of 1,024.

Hexadecimal is easier to learn and remember, since that only entails memorising the numerical values of six additional symbols (A–F), and even if those are not instantly recalled, it is easier to count through just over a handful of values.

==Software implementations==
Base32 programs are suitable for encoding arbitrary byte data using a restricted set of symbols that can both be conveniently used by humans and processed by computers.

Base32 implementations use a symbol set made up of at least 32 different characters (sometimes a 33rd for padding), as well as an algorithm for encoding arbitrary sequences of 8-bit bytes into a Base32 alphabet. Because more than one 5-bit Base32 character is needed to represent each 8-bit input byte, if the input is not a multiple of 5 bytes (40 bits), then it doesn&#x27;t fit exactly in 5-bit Base32 characters. In that case, some specifications require padding characters to be added while some require extra zero bits to make a multiple of 5 bits. The closely related Base64 system, in contrast, uses a set of 64 symbols (or 65 symbols when padding is used).

Base32 implementations in C/C++, Perl, Java, JavaScript Python, Go and Ruby are available.

<doc id="572687" wikidata="Q647884" url="?curid=572687" title="Search and seizure">
<text>Search and seizure is a procedure used in many civil law and common law legal systems by which police or other authorities and their agents, who, suspecting that a crime has been committed, commence a search of a person&#x27;s property and confiscate any relevant evidence found in connection to the crime.

Some countries have certain provisions in their constitutions that provide the public with the right to be free from &quot;unreasonable searches and seizures&quot;. This right is generally based on the premise that everyone is entitled to a reasonable right to privacy. 

Though specific interpretation may vary, this right can often require law enforcement to obtain a search warrant or consent of the owner before engaging in any form of search and seizure. In cases where evidence is seized in a search, that evidence might be rejected by court procedures, such as with a motion to suppress the evidence under the exclusionary rule.

==Italy==
In Italy protection from search and seizure is enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution, which states:

&quot;The home is inviolable. Home inspections, searches, or seizures shall not be admissible save in the cases and manners complying with measures to safeguard personal liberty. Controls and inspections for reason of public health and safety, or for economic and fiscal purposes, shall be regulated by appropriate laws.&quot;

==New Zealand==
Section 21 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (NZBoRA 1990) incorporates this right into New Zealand law, stating that: &quot;Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, whether of the person, property, or correspondence or otherwise.&quot;

While the NZBORA 1990 establishes the overall right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 provides the statutory framework for the practical application of the law in this area in New Zealand. The right to protection from unreasonable search and seizure is routinely ignored by the State, which is able to exercise unlimited powers of search and seizure against private individuals. The only remedy is to seek to have whatever evidence may have been unreasonably obtained omitted from proceedings under the Evidence Act procedures. This means that in practice there is only limited protection against the use of unreasonably obtained evidence, but no protection against actual unreasonable search and seizure in New Zealand.

== United Kingdom ==
Historically, English common law made use of a number of different types of legal writs to effect seizures for various reasons. For example, a writ of &quot;arrestandis bonis ne dissipentur&quot; provided for the seizure of goods when it was found likely they would not be properly cared for during a court case to settle ownership. A writ of &quot;attachiamenta bonorum&quot; allowed for the seizure of personal property to recover a debt.

In relation to criminal investigations, the police have a range of powers to search people and places without first making an arrest, often described as &quot;stop and search&quot;. The United Kingdom has several different legal systems and the powers and procedure for stop and search varies depending on the jurisdiction:
* in England and Wales
* in Scotland

==United States==
The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution states that:

The text of the amendment is brief, and most of the law determining what constitutes an unlawful search and seizure is found in court rulings. The brief definitions of the terms &quot;search&quot; and &quot;seizure&quot; was concisely summarized in &quot;United States v. Jacobsen&quot;, which said that the Fourth Amendment:

===Warrant requirement===
The general rule under the United States Constitution is that a valid warrant is required for a search. There are, however, several exceptions to this rule, based on the language of the fourth amendment that the people are to be &quot;secure ... against unreasonable searches and seizures&quot;.

For instance, the owner of the property in question may consent to the search. The consent must be voluntary, but there is no clear test to determine whether or not it is; rather, a court will consider the &quot;totality of the circumstances&quot; in assessing whether consent was voluntary. Police officers are &quot;not&quot; technically required to advise a suspect that he may refuse, however this policy depends on the specific rules of the department. There are also some circumstances in which a third party who has equal control, i.e. common authority, over the property may consent to a search. Another example of unreasonable search and seizure is in the court case &quot;Mapp v. Ohio&quot;.

When an individual does not possess a &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy&quot; that society is willing to acknowledge in a particular piece of property, any interference by the government with regard to that property is not considered a search for Fourth Amendment purposes, and a warrant is never required. For example, courts have found that a person does not possess a reasonable expectation of privacy in information transferred to a third party, such as writing on the outside of an envelope sent through the mail or left for pick-up in an area where others might view it. While that does not mean that the person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of that envelope, the Court has held that one does not possess a reasonable expectation of privacy that society is willing to acknowledge in the contents of garbage left outside the curtilage of a home.

There is also a lowered expectation of privacy inside of motor vehicles. However, &quot;Coolidge v. New Hampshire&quot; dictates that &quot;the word &#x27;automobile&#x27; is not a talisman in whose presence the Fourth Amendment fades away and disappears.&quot;

===Exceptions to the warrant requirement===
Courts have also established an &quot;exigent circumstances&quot; exception to the warrant requirement. &quot;Exigent circumstances&quot; simply means that the officers must act quickly. Typically, this is because police have a reasonable belief that evidence is in imminent danger of being removed or destroyed, but there is still a probable cause requirement. Exigent circumstances may also exist where there is a continuing danger, or where officers have a reasonable belief that people in need of assistance are present. This includes when the police are in &quot;hot pursuit of a fleeing felon.&quot; In this circumstance, so long as there is probable cause, police may follow the suspect into a residence and seize any evidence in plain view.

Certain limited searches are also allowed during an investigatory stop or incident to an arrest. These searches may be referenced as refined searches.

While the interpretations of the U.S. Supreme Court are binding on all federal courts interpreting the U.S. Constitution, there is some variance in the specifics from state to state, for two reasons. First, if an issue has not been decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, then a lower court makes a ruling of &quot;first impression&quot; on the issue, and sometimes two different lower courts will reach different interpretations. Second, virtually all state constitutions also contain provisions regarding search and seizure. Those provisions cannot reduce the protections offered by the U.S. Constitution, but they can provide additional protections such that a search deemed &quot;reasonable&quot; under the U.S. Constitution might nonetheless be unreasonable under the law of a particular state.

===Violation of the warrant requirement===
There are several areas of analysis that courts use to determine whether a search has encroached upon constitutional protections. Only those searches that meet with certainty each of the minimal measured requirements of the following four doctrines are likely to stand unchallenged in court. Those qualifying doctrines are reasonableness, probable cause, judicial authority, and particularity. While police judgment just before or during the course of a search or arrest usually provides the factors that determine reasonableness, matters of probable cause, judicial authority, and particularity requirements are commonly met through police procedures that are overseen by a court judge or magistrate prior to any search or arrest being conducted. Probable cause requires an acceptable degree of justified suspicion. Particularity requirements are spelled out in the constitution text itself. Law enforcement compliance with those requirements is scrutinized prior to the issuance of a warrant being granted or denied by an officiating judicial authority.

====Exclusionary rule====
The primary remedy in illegal search cases is known as the &quot;exclusionary rule&quot;. This means that any evidence obtained through an illegal search is excluded and cannot be used against the defendant at his or her trial. There are some narrow exceptions to this rule. For instance, if police officers acted in good faith—perhaps pursuant to a warrant that turned out to be invalid, but that the officers had believed valid at the time of the search—evidence may be admitted.

===Administrative searches===
In corporate and administrative law, there has been an evolution of Supreme Court interpretation in favor of stronger government in regards to investigatory power. In &quot;Federal Trade Commission v. American Tobacco Co.&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that the FTC, while having been granted a broad subpoena power, did not have the right to a general &quot;fishing expedition&quot; into the private papers, to search both relevant and irrelevant, hoping that something would come up. Justice Holmes ruled that this would go against &quot;the spirit and the letter&quot; of the Fourth Amendment.

 In the 1946 case of &quot;Oklahoma Press Pub. Co. v. Walling&quot;, there was a distinction made between a &quot;figurative or constructive search&quot; and an actual search and seizure. The court held that constructive searches are limited by the Fourth Amendment, where actual search and seizure requires a warrant based on “probable cause”. In the case of a constructive search where the records and papers sought are of corporate character, the court held that the Fourth Amendment does not apply, since corporations are not entitled to all the constitutional protections created in order to protect the rights of private individuals.

<text>The Black Mass was a horror-fantasy radio drama produced by Erik Bauersfeld, a leading American radio dramatist of the post-television era. The series aired on KPFA (Berkeley) and KPFK (Los Angeles) from 1963 to 1967, on an irregular schedule. Bauersfeld was the Director of Drama and Literature at KPFA from 1966 to 1991.

Bauersfeld&#x27;s sound designer for most of the episodes was John Whiting, KPFA&#x27;s production director. Their collaborations were later credited in a Ph.D. dissertation with &quot;keeping radio drama alive in America in the 1960s.&quot; 

Music for the series was by several Bay Area composers, including KPFA&#x27;s Music Director Charles Shere, a composer and music critic who later wrote books on American composers and also serves on the board of the Berkeley restaurant Chez Panisse.

Bauersfeld&#x27;s &quot;Black Mass&quot; productions were an influence on writer-producer Thomas Lopez (ZBS), who noted, &quot;In the 1960s, I was inspired by someone at KPFA in Berkeley, Eric Bauersfeld, who did a series called &quot;The Black Mass&quot;, adaptations of H. P. Lovecraft and such. He helped me a lot. I consider Eric my mentor. He also did some fine Eugene O&#x27;Neill plays for radio.&quot;

<text>The Party&#x27;s Over is the debut album by Talk Talk. It was released on 12 July 1982 and produced by Colin Thurston, who was a former engineer for David Bowie but was better known for producing Duran Duran&#x27;s first two albums.

== Release ==

&quot;The Party&#x27;s Over&quot; was released on 12 July 1982 by record label EMI.

In the United Kingdom, the album&#x27;s single &quot;Today&quot; was a top-twenty hit. The remixed version of the single &quot;Talk Talk&quot; reached number 1 in South Africa in 1983 and number 23 in the UK. In the United States the album entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200, reaching number 132, while the single &quot;Talk Talk&quot; peaked at number 75.

In New Zealand, the album was a hit, peaking at number 8 due to the success of &quot;Today&quot;, which reached number 10 in 1983.

==Critical reception==
Upon its release, &quot;Smash Hits&quot; reviewer Neil Tennant wrote: &quot;One sad mood permeates the whole LP as though they&#x27;re compensating for the fact that they&#x27;d like to say something important but can&#x27;t think of anything to say. Still, attractive tunes and synthesizer phrases plus sliding bass-playing prosper in the big, careful production. If only they&#x27;d cheered up, the part[y] might have been much more enjoyable.&quot;

<doc id="572720" wikidata="Q8916" url="?curid=572720" title="Biligtü Khan Ayushiridara">
<text>Biligtü Khan (; ; ), born Ayushiridara (; ; ; means preservative of life), also known by his temple name as the Emperor Zhaozong of Northern Yuan (; 23 January 1340 – April or May 1378), was an emperor of the Northern Yuan dynasty, reigning from 1370 to 1378. He ascended to the throne after the death of his father Toghon Temür (Emperor Shun). In 1372, he defeated an invading Ming dynasty army and recaptured some regions that were previously lost to the newly founded Ming dynasty.

==Early life==
Ayushiridara was born in 1340 the eldest son of Toghon Temür (Emperor Shun of Yuan) and Lady Gi, who came from a lower-ranked Goryeo aristocratic family who would eventually be highly influential during her husband&#x27;s reign. He was given his earliest tuition in Chinese at the house of his father&#x27;s minister, Toqto&#x27;a, at age ten. Toghon Temür&#x27;s principal empress, Danashiri, bore only one son who died in infancy. The Mongol noyans mostly preferred another Borjigin (Mongol noble) heir, rather than Ayushiridara, as his mother was a former palace maid and tea server. Only after the purge of Danashiri&#x27;s family and the death of Bayan, were he and his mother accepted at the Yuan court. Induced by his Korean empress, Lady Gi, the Yuan emperor Toghon Temür scheduled to elect his heir apparent in 1353. However, Toqto&#x27;a delayed the schedule for unknown reasons. This aroused the anger of the latter&#x27;s political enemies. The chief minister and his former protégé, Hama of the &quot;Qangli&quot;, and Ayushiridara, with the support of his mother, the Empress, Lady Gi, accused Toqto&#x27;a of corruption and violation of law while he was fighting the Red Turban Rebellion in 1354. This situation halted Toqto&#x27;a, who had been successful in defeating the rebellion, and he was stripped of his dignities and sent to Hoai-nan into exile.

Hama was made first minister and all power was then in his hands. Elated by this success, Hama decided to raise Ayushiridara to the throne. This plot was discovered, Hama was sentenced to exile and strangled by his enemies there in 1356, and Ayushiridara was pardoned. When he became crown prince in 1353, it caused internal strife between his supporters and opponents. Seven years later he and Lady Gi wished the first minister, Tai ping, to convince the Khagan to resign and leave the dominion to Ayushiridara. When Tai ping refused, they poisoned the minister&#x27;s partisans and forced him to resign. Power passed to a eunuch, Papuhwa, and to Cho Sekin, two weak men. An opposition leader, Bolad-Temür, occupied the capital in 1364. Ayushiridara was ordered back by his father to Dadu. Feeling himself not powerful enough to resist Bolad-Temür&#x27;s large army, Ayushiridara fled to the Yuan general, Köke Temür. When Bolad-Temür learned that Ayushiridara was advancing with troops, he arrested Lady Gi and forced her to recall her son to the capital. However, Bolad-Temür&#x27;s commanders deserted to Köke Temür. Toghon Temür secretly ordered Ho chang, son of the prince of Wei chun, to murder Bolad-Temür. After the latter&#x27;s death, Köke Temür defeated Bolad-Temür&#x27;s commander Tukiel in 1365. Ayushiridara forced Köke Temür to persuade the Emperor to resign in his favor. The Emperor was unwilling to abdicate, but he appointed his son lieutenant in the Yuan. Köke Temür tried to prevent it, but failed and was stripped of his dignities.

In 1368 the Yuan dynasty was overthrown by the Ming dynasty, and Toghon Temür Khan and his family fled north to Shangdu from Dadu. In 1370 Toghon Temür died in Yingchang. The Ming army captured the city and relatives and Maidarbal, a son of Ayushiridara who escaped safely to Karakorum where he was officially enthroned as Khagan of the Mongols with the Mongolian title of Biligtü (Intelligent).

==Reign==
Shortly after the succession, he fled to Karakorum and he changed the era name to Xuanguang (宣光, 1371–1378) there. Biligtü Khan made Köke Temür his commander in chief and chingsang of the right hand of the Central Government. The Yuan remnants in Mongolia homeland, known as the Northern Yuan dynasty, still remained overall a strong power during his reign. Its dominions covered the areas from Northeast China to Xinjiang.

Hongwu Emperor demanded Biligtü Khan Ayushiridara to give up his arms several times but failed. In 1372, the former dispatched the Ming army of 150,000 men to Mongolia. Biligtü Khan sent Köke Temür&#x27;s army against the central division of the Ming army under Xu Da. Xu Da&#x27;s troops reached Tuul River within 20 days. However, they were routed and their commander barely escaped with a few of his men. The eastern division of the Ming army advanced to Kherlen River, pillaging the Mongolian camps en route. They were suddenly defeated and forced to retreat to Orkhon where another bloody battle ensued. After that they fought the Mongol army under Halajchani and was finally defeated near Karakorum. The western division of the Ming army was forced to retreat due to other divisions&#x27; failures, though, they won a series of places.

Ayushiridara asked the assistance from the Yuan&#x27;s former vassal King Gongmin of Goryeo to fight against the Ming dynasty of China. In his letter to Gongmin, Biligtü Khan says:

&quot;...Oh king, you are a descendant of Genghis Khan same as me. Therefore, we wish you to work with us to establish justice and truth under the heaven...&quot;

On the contrary, King Gongmin refused to help and started an opposition policy against the Mongols, and retook their lands, which were annexed by the Yuan dynasty in the 1270s. Hong Ryun and Choe Mansaeng killed Gongmin in 1374. Yi Inim killed them and sent envoys to the Mongols in Liaoyang and Biligtü Khan quickly recognized the legitimacy of King U, puppet of Yi Inim. Biligtü Khan asked Goryeo to send troops for a joint attack against the Ming fortress. The Goryeo court cautiously refused to help again.

The Mongols conquered Funin and Suijin districts in Sinhe, Liaoning and Hebei provinces in 1373, cutting the Ming from Liaodong. In 1375, Naghachu, a Mongol official in Liaoyang province invaded the Liaodong Peninsula with aims of restoring the Mongols to power and succeeded with the support of the pro-Mongol Jurchens. The Ming ceased its raids into the Northern Yuan. Biligtü Khan&#x27;s greatest general, Köke Temür, died in 1375. Biligtü Khan Ayushiridara died in 1378 and his half-brother, Tögüs Temür, succeeded to the throne.

The area where the Minase and Yodo rivers meet (currently the Hirose and Todaiji districts) is called Minase. Known for its scenery and fluttering haze, it has been used as a Utamakura since the time of &quot;Manyoshu&quot;. Emperor Go-Toba loved this place and built Minamise Rikyu. After the death of the emeritus, the site of the Rikyuin became Minase Shrine (currently Minamise Jingu), which is the emeritus&#x27;s Mikagedo. In addition, if you arrange 50 phrases from Ogura Hyakunin Isshu in the order of the words, the picture of Minase will be completed. It is said that this is because Fujiwara no Teika has collected songs that match the drawings. In addition, Shin Kokin Wakashū Vol.

In addition, Sakurai District is a part of Sakurai&#x27;s Farewell, where Minatogawa Battle Masashige Kusunoki broke up with Takako Masayuki Kusunoki. Appears in Taiheiki as the ground.

And Meishin Expressway, as well as major traffic such as Hankyu Kyoto Main Line and National Highway 171. There is a point where the Katsura, Uji, and Kizu rivers meet, and because the water temperature of each river is different, a lot of fog is generated in winter.

<text>Maglite (also spelled Mag-Lite, stylized as MAG-LITE) is a brand of flashlight manufactured in the United States by Mag Instrument, Inc. located in Ontario, California, and founded by Anthony Maglica. It was introduced in 1979. Constructed principally of anodized 6061 aluminum, they have a variable-focus beam. Maglites are produced in several colors such as black, silver, blue, red, green, purple, gold, and different finishes. Originally Maglite flashlights used krypton or xenon incandescent bulbs. Current models have LEDs, although the older models are still widely available.

Accessories include belt holsters, mounting brackets, colored and glass lenses, attachable fiber optics extensions to bend light output into a cramped space, higher-powered incandescent bulbs, and LED conversion modules. The Maglite was an improvement over the Kel-Lite, after which the Maglite was patterned.

==Timeline==

A list of the sizes of Mag Instrument flashlights, and the years they were released:

* 1979: D and C battery models are put on the market; targeted to the public safety and industrial sectors (the 5C, 6C, 7C and 7D models are out of production)
* 1982: MagCharger: a larger more expensive model popular with public safety and emergency-services personnel. This light is much brighter than typical Maglites, and uses an incandescent Halogen bulb and a rechargeable NiCad or NiMH battery pack.
* 1984: Two AA cell batteries (Mini Maglite) Maglite&#x27;s first personal size flashlight
* 1987: Two AAA cell batteries (Mini Maglite) A smaller version of the original Mini Maglite
* 1988: One AAA cell battery (Maglite Solitaire) Mag Instrument&#x27;s key chain flashlight.
* 2006: Maglite LED Flashlight and Upgrade Module: 3-watt Luxeon III LED from Lumileds.
* 2006: Mini Maglite LED 2AA.
* 2008: MagCharger: Upgraded Nickel/Metal Hydride (NiMH) battery pack increases charge time and second generation Halogen bulb increases light output.
* 2009: Next Generation Mag-LED Technology: Featuring a new Luxeon Rebel LED and extended battery life.
* 2010: Maglite XL100: offers a motion-controlled user interface using a built-in accelerometer
* 2010: Maglite XL50: This is a simpler version of the XL100, featuring three modes that can be activated with consecutive presses of the tailcap switch. The XL50 will have a lower retail price than the XL100.
* 2011: A variety of LED and rechargeable flashlights introduced. These include the ML100 and the rechargeable/C Cell LED ML125
* 2011: Maglite XL200: This is similar to the XL100 but offers higher lumen output.
* 2012: Mini Maglite AA Pro 215 Lumens and Mini Maglite AA Pro+ 245 Lumens. 
* 2012: Maglite 2D pro 274 Lumens with a Cree XP-G rather than a Cree XP-E, increasing brightness while decreasing beam distance efficiency.
* 2012: Maglite Mag-Tac flashlight plain bezel, 310 Lumens, low mode at around 100 Lumens. First Maglite flashlight to use CR123A batteries. Tactical style designed with military input.
* 2012: Maglite Mag-Tac crowned bezel, 320 lumens. This model has no low mode for light output.
* 2012: The V4 was released with a newly developed electronic switch enabling a Multi Mode operation and a slightly more powerful bulb producing an output of 245 Lumens. 
* 2012: In August, Maglite announced several new models including an LED version of the Solitaire, a Mini Maglite LED 2 AAA and a new version of the 2D LED termed the 2D LED Pro promising a beam in excess of 200 Lumens.
* 2013: Maglite released an LED version of the MagCharger. Features a 680 lumen output and spot-to-flood beam with a quarter turn of the head. Claimed 4 hrs of battery life on a full charge at full power. Other specs are as the Incandescent Version.

==Law enforcement use==
Maglite flashlights have been known to be used as a ready substitute for a baton. In 2004, the Los Angeles Police Commission moved to use smaller flashlights, with Alan Skobin, the commission vice-president, stating that &quot;This policy makes clear flashlights are for illumination and discourages their use as an impact tool. And it ensures officer safety as well as protects the public.&quot; Security and police personnel often carry Maglite flashlights in red as they can be employed as a defensive weapon, especially at night or in dark locations.

On March 30, 2007, the Los Angeles Police Department announced that they would be switching to a smaller, lighter LED flashlight that cannot be used as a baton, in response to a highly publicized incident where an officer was accused of using excessive force against a suspect by using a Maglite.

<text>Jean Giraud (; 2 February 1936 – 27 or 28 March 2007) was a French mathematician, a student of Alexander Grothendieck. His research focused on non-abelian cohomology and the theory of topoi. In particular, he authored the book &quot;Cohomologie non-abélienne&quot; (Springer, 1971) and proved the theorem that bears his name, which gives a characterization of a Grothendieck topos.

From 1969 to 1989, he was a professor at École normale supérieure de Saint-Cloud.

From 1993 to 1994, he was deputy director for research of École normale supérieure de Lyon, where he was made interim director in 1994 and director from 1995 to 2000.

<doc id="572774" wikidata="Q4809228" url="?curid=572774" title="Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation">
<text>Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 KB 223 is an English law case that sets out the standard of unreasonableness in the decision of a public body, which would make it liable to be quashed on judicial review, known as Wednesbury unreasonableness.

The court gave three conditions on which it would intervene to correct a bad administrative decision, including on grounds of its unreasonableness in the special sense later articulated in &quot;Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service&quot; by Lord Diplock:

==Facts==
In 1947, Associated Provincial Picture Houses was granted a licence by the Wednesbury Corporation in Staffordshire to operate a cinema, on condition that no children under 15, whether accompanied by an adult or not, were admitted on Sundays. Under the Cinematograph Act 1909, cinemas could be open from Mondays to Saturdays but not on Sundays, and under a regulation, the commanding officer of military forces stationed in a neighbourhood could apply to the licensing authority to open a cinema on Sundays. 

The Sunday Entertainments Act 1932 legalised opening cinemas on Sundays by the local licensing authorities &quot;subject to such conditions as the authority may think fit to impose&quot; after a majority vote by the borough. Associated Provincial Picture Houses sought a declaration that Wednesbury&#x27;s condition was unacceptable and outside the power of the corporation to impose.

==Judgment==
The court decided that it had no power to issue a writ of &quot;certiorari&quot; to quash the decision of the defendant simply because the court disagreed with it. For the court to adopt any remedies against decisions of public bodies such as Wednesbury Corporation, it would have to find that the decision-maker:

# had given undue relevance to facts that in reality lacked the relevance for being considered in the decision-making process.
# had not given relevance to facts that were relevant and worthy of being considered in the decision-making process
# had made a decision that was completely absurd, a decision so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could have possibly made it.

The court ruled that the corporation&#x27;s conduct was not inappropriate and complied with the standards that had been set out.

As Lord Greene MR said (at 229),

==Significance==
The test laid down in this case, in all three limbs, is known as &quot;the &quot;Wednesbury&quot; test&quot;. The term &quot;&quot;Wednesbury&quot; unreasonableness&quot; is used to describe the third limb, of being so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could have decided that way. This case or the principle laid down is cited in United Kingdom courts as a reason for courts to be hesitant to interfere with decisions of administrative law bodies.

In recent times, particularly as a result of the enactment of the Human Rights Act 1998, the judiciary have receded from this strict abstentionist approach, arguing that in certain circumstances it is necessary to undertake a more searching review of administrative decisions. The European Court of Human Rights requires the reviewing court to subject the original decision to &quot;anxious scrutiny&quot; as to whether an administrative measure infringes a Convention right. In order to justify such an intrusion, the Respondents have to show that they pursued a &quot;pressing social need&quot; and that the means employed to achieve this were proportionate to the limitation of the right.

The UK courts have also ruled that an opinion formed by an employer or other contracting body in relation to a contractual matter has to be &quot;reasonable&quot; in the sense in which that expression is used in &quot;Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation&quot;: see the decision of the High Court in &quot;The Vainqueur José&quot; and that of the Supreme Court in &quot;Braganza v BP Shipping Limited&quot;.

<text>Folk UnderGround is a musical group from Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, who blend traditional music and new songs with dark and darkly comic themes. The members include Lorraine Garland (violin and vocals), Trevor Hartman (drums, accordion, and vocals), and Paul Score (guitar and vocals).

The band formed in the summer of 2002 when guitarist Paul Score and Trevor Hartman began playing tunes from Garland&#x27;s old band, The Flash Girls. &quot;Before Long,&quot; explained Score in one interview, &quot;Lorraine was telling us how to play them correctly, and it went to the wee hours of the morning, and we just had a blast&quot;.

The group has two albums, &quot;Buried Things&quot;, featuring new songs written by Neil Gaiman and Jane Yolen (among others), along with a selection of traditional songs. The second, &quot;Get Y&#x27;er Hands Off &#x27;Me Booty!&quot;, is a live album of (mostly) traditional songs.

Though they have since broken up, the group used to play as the opening act for &quot;Puke and Snot&quot; (a comedy duo) at the Minnesota Renaissance Fair.

<doc id="572783" wikidata="Q1091995" url="?curid=572783" title="Yankee Hotel Foxtrot">
<text>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is the fourth studio album by the American rock band Wilco, released on September 11, 2001 on their website, and on April 23, 2002, on Nonesuch . Recording sessions for the album began in late 2000. These sessions, which were documented for the film &quot;I Am Trying to Break Your Heart&quot;, were marred by conflicts including a switch in drummers and disagreements among the band members and engineers about songs. Despite this, the album would be mostly completed in early 2001. The album showcased a more atmospheric and experimental sound than the band&#x27;s previous work, and has been described as art rock and indie rock by music critics. It was the band&#x27;s first album with drummer Glenn Kotche, and last with multi-instrumentalist and songwriter Jay Bennett.

Reprise Records, Wilco&#x27;s record label at the time, refused to release the album as they felt unhappy about the end result; this would lead to Wilco&#x27;s departure from Reprise. The band subsequently acquired the rights to the album and later streamed the entire album for free on their website 7 days later on September 18, 2001. In November of that year, Wilco signed with Nonesuch Records, who gave the album its first official retail release on April 23, 2002. &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; received widespread acclaim from music critics at release, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest albums of the 2000s and of all time. It is also Wilco&#x27;s best-selling work, having reached number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at number 225 on its updated &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list.

==Background and recording==

Wilco was touring to promote &quot;Mermaid Avenue Vol. II&quot; in May 2000 when lead singer Jeff Tweedy was invited to play at the Noise Pop Festival in Chicago. The festival promoter offered to pair Tweedy with a collaborator of his choosing, and Tweedy decided to perform with Jim O&#x27;Rourke. Tweedy frequently played O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s album &quot;Bad Timing&quot; in his car while he traveled during the previous winter. O&#x27;Rourke was an accomplished producer as well as a musician, and had produced over 200 albums by the time that Tweedy requested the collaboration. O&#x27;Rourke offered the services of drummer Glenn Kotche, and the trio performed at Double Door for the festival on May 14, 2000. Tweedy enjoyed the performance so much that he suggested that the trio record an album together. They chose the name Loose Fur, and recorded six songs during the following summer.

By the end of the year, Wilco had recorded enough demo tracks to release a fourth studio album (the working title was &quot;Here Comes Everybody&quot;), but the band was unhappy with some of the takes of the songs. This was attributed to the inflexibility of Ken Coomer&#x27;s drumming. According to &quot;American Songwriter&quot;, &quot;virtually every attempt [Tweedy] made to steer Coomer toward the percussive sound he had envisioned for the record sparked a fight.&quot; The band decided to bring Kotche into the studio to record with the band. Wilco officially replaced Coomer with Kotche in January 2001, a decision originally proposed by Tweedy and almost immediately approved by the rest of the band.

Guitarist Jay Bennett and Chris Brickley served as the audio engineers, and agreed with Tweedy that O&#x27;Rourke would be a good choice to mix the album, after a failed attempt to mix a few of the songs at the Chicago Recording Company and after hearing O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s &quot;audition mix&quot;. One of the conflicts, exhibited in the film &quot;I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco&quot;, was over the ten-second transition between &quot;Ashes of American Flags&quot; and &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot;. Bennett attempted to explain to Tweedy that there were several slightly different ways to approach the transition, each of which would yield slightly different results, but Tweedy explained that he just wanted the problem fixed, and was not concerned with understanding the different approaches. Bennett focused on the individual songs, while Tweedy focused on larger conceptual and thematic issues—a tried and true division of labor that had worked well on the four releases on which they co-wrote the material.

In order to achieve the band&#x27;s musical goals, Tweedy invited Jim O&#x27;Rourke into the studio to mix &quot;I Am Trying to Break Your Heart&quot;, and the results impressed the band members. Jim O&#x27;Rourke was officially in Wilco from that point. He recorded 6 of the 12 tracks on the album. O&#x27;Rourke was then asked to mix the rest of the album. After the album&#x27;s completion, Tweedy decided to remove Bennett from the band. The album was completed in 2001, and Tweedy believed it to be ready for release. The album was given the title &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;, referencing a series of letters in the phonetic alphabet that Tweedy had heard on the Irdial box set &quot;The Conet Project: Recordings of Shortwave Numbers Stations&quot;. A clip from this Numbers Station transmission was placed in the &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; song &quot;Poor Places&quot;; Irdial later sued Wilco for copyright infringement, and a settlement was reached out of court. The cover of the album is a picture of the two Marina City complex towers in the band&#x27;s adopted hometown of Chicago.

Los Angeles photographer Sam Jones contacted Wilco in 2000 about producing a documentary film about the creation of &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;. Jones shot over 80 hours of footage for &quot;I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco&quot; beginning on the day that Coomer was dismissed from the band. The footage was edited down to 92 minutes, and the film was released to theaters in 2002. The documentary has received generally positive reviews.

==Release==
===Original release===
In 2001, AOL merged with Time Warner to form AOL Time Warner. Time Warner&#x27;s market share of the music industry had dropped almost five percent from the mid-1990s, and the new executives ordered the termination of 600 jobs. One of those jobs was Reprise Records president Howie Klein, who had been a big supporter of Wilco on the label. Klein&#x27;s dismissal placed head A&amp;R representative David Kahne in charge of the decision whether to release &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;. Kahne assigned A&amp;R representative Mio Vukovic to monitor the progress of the album. Vukovic was unhappy about the album because he felt that his suggestions were not being considered. Kahne wanted a radio single from the album, but he felt that none of the songs were suitable for commercial release. In June 2001, the album was officially rejected and Vukovic suggested that the band independently release the album.

Josh Grier, Wilco&#x27;s lawyer, was able to negotiate a buy-out of the band from Reprise. The band would keep the rights to the album if they paid Reprise $50,000. Before Wilco could accept the deal, Reprise called the band and changed their offer to give the band the rights to &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; for free. Despite Reprise&#x27;s efforts to accommodate Wilco&#x27;s departure, the process marred public relations after an article in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; described what had happened.

Wilco had planned on releasing &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; on September 11, 2001, but Tweedy did not want a change in record labels to significantly delay the release of the album. Within weeks of being released from the label and Jay Bennett leaving the band, MP3s of all tracks from the album began to appear on file sharing networks. In a decision aimed at discouraging the downloading of lower quality unlicensed MP3s and having some control over how the album was distributed, on September 18, 2001, Wilco began streaming the entirety of the album on their official website. The wilcoworld.net website registered over 50,000 hits that day, eight times as much as typical daily traffic. Traffic to the website quadrupled the normal traffic over the next few months. The following tour was a success financially, and members of Wilco observed that fans sang along with unreleased songs from the album.

===Retail release===
Both major and independent record labels made bids to release &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;, including Artemis Records and Nonesuch Records. Tweedy denied the bids of record labels that did not have a roster of signed artists that he liked. He also decided to ignore small, independent labels because he wanted to be able to put the album out for a large audience and felt that very small labels would be unable to produce more than 100,000 copies. Wilco decided to sign with Warner Music subsidiary Nonesuch Records in November 2001, basing the decision on the label&#x27;s affiliation with a large company, but also Nonesuch&#x27;s artist-friendly atmosphere. In the end, Wilco recorded and produced &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; with Reprise Records (a Warner label), received the rights to the album from Reprise for free, and then had it released by a different Warner label, Nonesuch Records.

The &quot;More Like the Moon&quot; EP (also called &quot;Bridge&quot; and &quot;Australian&quot; EP) was originally released as a bonus disc to the Australian version of &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;. The EP comprised six songs that were recorded but not released during the &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; sessions including a re-working of &quot;Kamera&quot;. On the one-year anniversary of the release of &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;, Wilco uploaded the EP onto their official website, and offered it for free to anyone who purchased the album. The band would later allow anyone to download the EP for free off the website, regardless of whether they had purchased the full-length album.

===20th anniversary reissue===
In celebration of the 20th anniversary of the album&#x27;s release, Wilco performed the album in its entirety for four nights at the United Palace in New York City and three nights at the Auditorium Theater in Chicago. The band was joined by strings and horns sections in an attempt to perform the album as it was recorded. The band also announced reissues of the album, including a Super Deluxe version spanning 11 LPs which includes the original remastered album, demos, rare live recordings, and other alternate versions of the songs. These reissues were released on September 30, 2022. Pitchfork gave the reissue a perfect 10 rating, and naming it &quot;Best New Reissue&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical===

&quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; was acclaimed by critics upon release. Brent Sirota of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave the album a perfect 10 rating, noting that the album was &quot;simply a masterpiece.&quot; David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised its resemblance to psychedelia while AllMusic writer Zac Johnson lauded its musical &quot;complexity&quot;. E! Online said that its &quot;rich, exotic flavor gets more intense the longer you chew on it&quot;, while &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; called it &quot;a great album, and an outstanding place for prospective new Wilco fans to start.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; gave it a favorable review and called it &quot;a more adventurous and rewarding release&quot;. &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; gave it four stars out of five and said that &quot;After a while -- a familiarity period if you will -- it becomes clear that these songs are not only fully realized, they&#x27;re damn near brilliant.&quot; &quot;Playlouder&quot; gave it four stars out of five and called it &quot;The most worth-the-wait long-awaited album in the world ... ever? Could be ...&quot; &quot;Uncut&quot; also gave the album four stars out of five and said, &quot;The most common description of this much-discussed album over the past few months is that YHF is Americana&#x27;s &quot;Kid A&quot;. In truth, it&#x27;s more successful than that.&quot; &quot;Blender&quot; likewise gave it four stars out of five and stated: &quot;Tweedy whittles down the arrangements and drops in enough experimental nuances to make the whole thing sound refreshingly lo-fi.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; likewise gave it four stars and called it &quot;battered, bonkers and bewitching in equal parts&quot; and that it &quot;at last finds Wilco&#x27;s &#x27;interesting&#x27; phase become downright fascinating.&quot; Yahoo! Music UK gave it eight stars out of ten and said, &quot;Tweedy takes conventional songforms birthed on his acoustic guitar and scrambles them completely, reassembled into fractured, dissonant epics with the help of the reliably brilliant Jim O&#x27;Rourke.&quot;

&quot;Trouser Press&quot; was one of the few major media outlets that did not give the album a good review, instead giving it an average review and stating that &quot;more time spent in the songwriting lab might have yielded material more suitable to the evident studio effort invested and brought Wilco closer to making a truly great album.&quot; Robert Christgau gave the album a one-star honorable mention rating, describing the music as &quot;purty&quot; but stating that he found the lyrics and vocals in general to be boring.

Though &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; was recorded before the September 11, 2001 attacks, critics noted a relevance in light of the attacks. For example, Jeff Gordinier of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; compared the two towers of Marina City to the World Trade Center towers. Also containing similar themes are the songs &quot;War on War&quot; and &quot;Ashes of American Flags&quot; which contains the line &quot;I would like to salute the ashes of American flags.&quot; The song &quot;Jesus, Etc.&quot; also contains these lyrics:
&quot;Tall buildings shake, Voices escape singing sad sad songs ... Voices whine, Skyscrapers are scraping together, your voice is smoking.&quot;

===Commercial===
&quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; was released by Nonesuch on April 23, 2002. The album sold 55,573 copies during its first week of release, peaking on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart at number 13. The album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America and has sold over 590,000 units.

===Accolades===
&quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; was voted as the best album of the year in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll. In 2008, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Tom Moon listed &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; among the &quot;1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

&quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; found a place on many lists of the greatest albums of the 2000s. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at number three on its list of the 100 Best Albums of the Decade. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; put the album at number four on the Top 200 Albums of the 2000s. The alternative music website also named &quot;Poor Places&quot; and &quot;Jesus, Etc.&quot; as the 147th and 61st best songs of the decade, respectively. &quot;Paste&quot; named the album the second-best album of the decade. Some music outlets have ranked &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2006, readers of &quot;Q Magazine&quot; voted it the 100th &quot;Greatest Album Ever&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it #493 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, saying, &quot;Wilco&#x27;s great leap forward was a mix of rock tradition, electronics, oddball rhythms and experimental gestures.&quot;, and in the 2020 reboot of the list, they elevated the album&#x27;s position to #225.

<doc id="572784" wikidata="Q6383617" url="?curid=572784" title="Keihoku, Kyoto">
<text>was a town located in Kitakuwada District, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan. The town was the second largest among the towns and villages in the Kyoto Prefecture. The town was entirely on the Tamba plateau. The town, being surrounded by mountains, had an inland climate with cool summers, cold winters, and a huge amount of precipitation.

As 90% of the area was covered in forest, forestry has been a key industry in Keihoku. The construction of Heian-kyō, capital of Imperial Japan from 794 to 1868, relied hugely on the timber imports from Keihoku. Local villagers and lumberjacks used to deliver the timber to Kyoto through Katsura River during the ancient times.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 6,362 and a density of 29.23 persons per km2. The total area was 217.68 km2. It was said that more artisans are moving to Keihoku in pursue of better quality of life.

<doc id="572788" wikidata="Q8046715" url="?curid=572788" title="Yagi, Kyoto">
<text>was a town located in Funai District, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 8,916 and a density of 179.90 persons per km2. The total area was 49.56 km2.

On January 1, 2006, Yagi, along with the towns of Hiyoshi, Sonobe (all from Funai District), and the town of Miyama (from Kitakuwada District), was merged to create the city of Nantan.

Nestled between mountains and situated in the Ōi River basin, Yagi is more a collection of small villages than a single town. The town center, situated along the river, is only a small part of Yagi&#x27;s total area. Though Yagi is decidedly rural, its proximity to Kyoto by train makes it an extended suburb of sorts. It is estimated that about 60% of Yagi&#x27;s adult working population commutes to Kyoto or Osaka daily. Yagi is easily accessible via the JR Sagano Train Line from Kyoto.

Yagi has a long history dating back at least as far as the Nara Period, when Yagi&#x27;s extant Sanin Road was a main route through the prefecture, linking Kyoto to Kameoka and Sonobe.

In 1960 Yagi and the surrounding area was hit by a massive typhoon. The banks of the Ōi River collapsed, and the town suffered extensive flooding. A number of people died during the storm and the flood that followed.

Yagi has one junior high school and five elementary schools: Yagi, Tomimoto, Shinjo, Yoshitomi and Kamiyoshi. Yagi has been a long-time participant in the JET Programme, and employs a foreigner and native speaker to teach English in the town&#x27;s schools.

== Notable attributes ==
Yagi is famous throughout the Kansai Region for its annual fireworks festival, held on or around August 14. Thousands of people gather near Yagi&#x27;s Ōi River Bridge to watch the fireworks show, the largest of its kind in Kyoto Prefecture. The festival was first held in 1947, and officially begins every year at 6 p.m. with Tōrō nagashi, a Buddhist ceremony in which paper lanterns are floated down the river. The fireworks show is now held both as celebration of summer and a commemoration for those who died in the 1960 typhoon.

Yagi is also known for several progressive environmental projects. In 1995, Yagi Junior High became the first school in Japan to be solar powered, and Yoshitomi and Shinjo elementary schools also use supplemental solar and wind energy. Additionally, Yagi&#x27;s Bio-Ecology Center turns cow manure from nearby dairy farms into electricity by utilizing the methane gas produced during decomposition.

Seigen-ji temple, in Yagi&#x27;s northern foothills, is famous because it houses 22 wood carvings created by the wandering ascetic priest Mokujiki-san. Mokujiki-san traveled throughout Japan on a pilgrimage whose purpose was to spread Buddhist teachings and carve 1,000 images of the Buddha and his disciples. Shaka, the image of Buddha at Seigen-ji, is the 1,000th carving, which Mokujiki-san completed in 1806.

Yagi&#x27;s northern foothills are also home to Kyoto Taishakuten, a Buddhist temple established in 780. Other temples and shrines are to be found throughout the region.

<doc id="572806" wikidata="Q3052881" url="?curid=572806" title="Flook (band)">
<text>Flook is an Anglo-Irish band playing traditional-style instrumental music, much of it penned by the band themselves. Their music is typified by extremely fast, sometimes percussive, flute and whistle atop complex guitar and bodhrán rhythms. Flook is made up of Brian Finnegan, Sarah Allen, Ed Boyd and John Joe Kelly.

==History==
The band was formed in 1995, originally by Becky Morris, with three flute-playing friends Sarah Allen, Brian Finnegan and Michael McGoldrick, (who left in 1997 to join Capercaillie). The band was briefly known as Three Nations Flutes.

Flook&#x27;s 10th anniversary tour included a concert at the Purcell Room (on 7 November 2005) as part of a week of &quot;Folk in the Fall&quot; on London&#x27;s South Bank and another at the new Sage Gateshead concert hall on the south bank of the River Tyne on 10 November 2005. Their third studio album, &quot;Haven&quot;, was released in October 2005.

In December 2008 the band sent a Christmas message saying they were disbanding. &quot;We wanted to wish you a very Happy Christmas and also to share some news with you,&quot; said a band press release. &quot;After 13-plus years, hundreds of gigs, millions of miles traveled together and countless brilliant times, we&#x27;ve decided to call it a day. It might be forever or a prolonged pause, who knows, but we&#x27;re all still great friends and will always remain so. This might sound like a cliché but it is deeply truthful.&quot;

The group reformed briefly for an appearance on the BBC Northern Ireland programme, &quot;Blas Ceoil&quot; and came back together again in 2013. They restarted to perform live regularly, touring the world with rapturous feedbacks: they brought their distinguishable sound in great venues such as the Kings Place in London, the &quot;Soma Festival&quot; in Belfast, the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow and the &quot;Star Pine&#x27;s cafe&quot; in Tokyo.

On Friday 12 January 2018, the group posted a photo of themselves, with the caption &quot;It’s a new year and we’re in Bath (United Kingdom) rehearsing new tunes&quot;, reported by Lynette Fay on BBC Radio Ulster&#x27;s Folk Club on 14 January 2018, who described the band as &quot;iconic, ground-breaking, progressive and all-round brilliant&quot;.

Flook&#x27;s most recent album, &quot;Ancora&quot;, was released on April 12 2019. Folk Radio UK praised the album, writing &quot;expectations more than fully met – simply a brilliant album&quot;. Bright Young Folk wrote that &quot;«Ancora» is the highest peak of their more than twenty year old career.&quot;

==Band members==
*Sarah Allen plays flute and accordion. She has also been a member of the Barely Works, Bigjig, The Happy End Big Band and The Waterboys.
*Brian Finnegan plays wooden flutes, low whistle and tin whistle. He has been a member of Upstairs in a Tent (originally Gan Ainm), Maalstroom, Aquarium and KAN.
*Ed Boyd plays guitars and bouzouki. He became a permanent member of Lunasa in 2012. He is a former member of Red Ciel.
*John Joe Kelly plays bodhrán and mandolin. He has also worked with Altan and Paul Brady and is a session musician.
* Damien O&#x27;Kane joined the band temporarily in 2008, playing banjo and tenor guitar as well as singing.
* Michael McGoldrick, plays wooden flute, low whistle, uilleann pipes and tin whistle, left Flook in 1997 to join Capercaillie.

<doc id="572813" wikidata="Q7576723" url="?curid=572813" title="Sphericon">
<text>In solid geometry, the sphericon is a solid that has a continuous developable surface with two congruent, semi-circular edges, and four vertices that define a square. It is a member of a special family of rollers that, while being rolled on a flat surface, bring all the points of their surface to contact with the surface they are rolling on. It was discovered independently by carpenter Colin Roberts (who named it) in the UK in 1969, by dancer and sculptor Alan Boeding of MOMIX in 1979, and by inventor David Hirsch, who patented it in Israel in 1980.

==Construction==
The sphericon may be constructed from a bicone (a double cone) with an apex angle of 90 degrees, by splitting the bicone along a plane through both apexes, rotating one of the two halves by 90 degrees, and reattaching the two halves.
Alternatively, the surface of a sphericon can be formed by cutting and gluing a paper template in the form of four circular sectors (with central angles formula_1) joined edge-to-edge.

==Geometric properties==
The surface area of a sphericon with radius formula_2 is given by
:formula_3.
The volume is given by
:formula_4, 
exactly half the volume of a sphere with the same radius.

==History==
Around 1969, Colin Roberts (a carpenter from the UK) made a sphericon out of wood while attempting to carve a Möbius strip without a hole.

In 1979, David Hirsch invented a device for generating a meander motion. The device consisted of two perpendicular half discs joined at their axes of symmetry. While examining various configurations of this device, he discovered that the form created by joining the two half discs, exactly at their diameter centers, is actually a skeletal structure of a solid made of two half bicones, joined at their square cross-sections with an offset angle of 90 degrees, and that the two objects have exactly the same meander motion. Hirsch filed a patent in Israel in 1980, and a year later, a pull toy named Wiggler Duck, based on Hirsch&#x27;s device, was introduced by Playskool Company.

In 1999, Colin Roberts sent Ian Stewart a package containing a letter and two sphericon models. In response, Stewart wrote an article &quot;Cone with a Twist&quot; in his Mathematical Recreations column of Scientific American. This sparked quite a bit of interest in the shape, and has been used by Tony Phillips to develop theories about mazes. Roberts&#x27; name for the shape, the sphericon, was taken by Hirsch as the name for his company, Sphericon Ltd.

==In popular culture==
In 1979, modern dancer Alan Boeding designed his &quot;Circle Walker&quot; sculpture from two crosswise semicircles, a skeletal version of the sphericon. He began dancing with a scaled-up version of the sculpture in 1980 as part of an MFA program in sculpture at Indiana University, and after he joined the MOMIX dance company in 1984 the piece became incorporated into the company&#x27;s performances. The company&#x27;s later piece &quot;Dream Catcher&quot; is based around a similar Boeding sculpture whose linked teardrop shapes incorporate the skeleton and rolling motion of the oloid, a similar rolling shape formed from two perpendicular circles each passing through the center of the other.

In 2008, British woodturner David Springett published the book &quot;Woodturning Full Circle&quot;, which explains how sphericons (and other unusual solid forms, such as streptohedrons) can be made on a wood lathe.

<text>Energy Future Holdings Corporation was an electric utility company headquartered in Energy Plaza in Downtown Dallas, Texas, United States. The majority of the company&#x27;s power generation was through coal and nuclear power plants. From 1998 to 2007, the company was known as TXU Corporation until its $45 billion leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, TPG Capital and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners. That purchase was the largest leveraged buyout in history. As of 2019, TXU Energy is a subsidiary of publicly traded Vistra Energy.

, the company has been described as &quot;struggling&quot; which resulted in the April 29, 2014 filing for bankruptcy protection under Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. On July 7, 2017, the company announced its Oncor transmission business would be acquired by Berkshire Hathaway for $9 billion but Sempra Energy&#x27;s higher $9.45 billion bid was eventually accepted instead on August 21, 2017.

==History==
The company traces its history to the beginnings of electric service in northern Texas. Predecessor companies include Dallas Power &amp; Light (DP&amp;L, founded 1917 with roots dating to 1882), which served the city of Dallas; Texas Electric Service Company (TESCO, founded 1929 with roots dating to 1885), which served Fort Worth and areas west of Abilene; and Texas Power and Light (TP&amp;L, founded 1912), which served other areas of northern and west-central Texas. All three companies were owned by the Electric Bond and Share Company, a subsidiary of General Electric.

DP&amp;L, TP&amp;L and TESCO were connected by a single grid in 1932. The three companies were deemed to be an integrated system with the passage of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. In 1945, Texas Utilities was formed as a publicly owned holding company that owned DP&amp;L, TP&amp;L and TESCO. The three operating companies continued to operate separately until 1984, when they were merged into one operating company, called TU Electric (&quot;TU&quot; meaning &quot;Texas Utilities&quot;). Following acquisitions of The Energy Group plc for $10 billion in 1998 in the United Kingdom and a power generator in Australia, Texas Utilities became TXU, and was by 2000 the fifth largest energy company in the world, after its purchase of NORWEB from United Utilities and two municipal utility companies in Germany, Stadtwerke Kiel and Braunschweiger Versorgungs AG.

=== Deregulation ===
In 1996, TXU merged with the parent company of Lone Star Gas, allowing TXU to become the largest provider of electricity and natural gas in the state of Texas, a maneuver which set the stage for deregulation. In 2002, the state of Texas deregulated the Texas electric market, and TXU lost its monopoly on retail electric sales in northern Texas.

TXU continued to own transmission and distribution facilities, but was required to open retail sales to competition. Competitors during this time period included Champion Energy, Dynowatt, Texas Power, Entrust Energy, Reliant Energy, Bounce Energy, Direct Energy, Stream Energy, Gexa Energy, Green Mountain Energy, Cirro Energy, and Commerce Energy. Surprisingly, many utility customers opted to remain with TXU despite active retail competition. [See &quot;Power to Choose: An Analysis of Consumer Behavior in the Texas Retail Electricity Market&quot; with Ali Hortacsu and Seyed Ali Madanizadeh]

=== 2002–2004 divestitures ===
TXU divested itself of its European holdings in late 2002 mainly due to the collapse of its UK holdings and then of its Australian holdings in 2004. The UK operations
had been purchased following a bidding war with PacifiCorp which pushed up the price paid substantially from opening offers but most of the cost thereof was indebted back onto the UK businesses themselves. Falling UK energy prices (which later rose substantially) and outstanding purchase debt eventually crippled the European business. TXU considered investing £250 million from its US business to bolster the equity base, but following Rating Agency pressure this was shelved in order to protect the credit ratings of the US parent. As a consequence the directors of the UK businesses appointed Administrators in September 2002. The UK retail business and several of its gas fields were purchased by Eon (owners of Powergen), who closed its commercial operations in Rayleigh, Essex and relocated them to Powergen offices in Nottingham &amp; Coventry. TXU&#x27;s incomplete new UK headquarters were not part of the deal and are now used by Suffolk County Council.

Also, in October 2004, TXU sold its natural gas properties to Atmos Energy. TXU sold its Australian assets to Singapore Power, which retained the distribution businesses (electricity and natural gas distribution networks) in the state of Victoria, and onsold the electricity retail and generation businesses to Hong-Kong-based CLP Group, trading as TRUenergy.

On May 18, 2004 TXU and Capgemini entered a limited partnership to form Capgemini Energy Limited Partnership, a new company that will initially provide business process services and information technology solutions to TXU.

=== 2007 buyout and 2014 bankruptcy ===
Private equity firms KKR, TPG Capital, and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners purchased TXU in 2007; the sale became final on October 10, 2007. As part of the buyout, the electric distribution part of the company became Oncor Electric Delivery and the electric generation business became Luminant, leaving TXU Energy as solely a retail provider of electricity, without any electrical distribution or production assets. Luminant owns and operates the Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant. The buyout, which left Dallas-based Energy Future with a debt of more than $40 billion, was a gamble that natural gas prices would rise and give its coal-fired plants a competitive advantage. Instead, natural gas prices fell sharply. Consequently, Energy Future Holdings was mired in financial problems, leading to the April 29, 2014 filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

== Subsidiaries ==
In 2012, financial ties among subsidiaries were substantially severed, securing their financial independence.
* Oncor Electric Delivery, an independent, regulated subsidiary which is the company&#x27;s electricity delivery unit, focusing on power transmission and distribution.
* Texas Competitive Electric Holdings, an independent unregulated subsidiary when engages in competitive selling in the Texas electricity market.
* Luminant

== Financial problems ==
The upcoming maturity of a significant amount of debt, coupled with sizable financial losses, had many observers predicting that EFH will ultimately file for bankruptcy, which it did on April 29, 2014. The prominent credit-rating firm Moody&#x27;s had called EFH &quot;a financially distressed company with an untenable capital structure.&quot;

The pending bankruptcy represents the biggest bankruptcy of a private equity-backed company since the failure of Chrysler Group in 2009.

== Environmental impacts ==
Energy Future Holdings owns, and has closed the mines for, four of the nation&#x27;s highest emitting coal-fired power plants, which together account for approximately one quarter of all industrial/utility air pollution reported to Texas regulators. Its Big Brown (closed), Martin Lake (mines closed), Monticello (closed), and Sandow (closed) plants have been the subject of scrutiny by environmental groups for pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, mercury, and sulfur dioxides.

The Martin Lake, Big Brown, and Monticello plants ranked first, third, and fourth, respectively, in airborne mercury pollution in the United States according to company reports submitted to the EPA. Such high levels of mercury pollution have drawn criticism for their harmful effects on child development.

NOx emissions from EFH&#x27;s coal plants help contribute to harmful levels of ozone in the air in Dallas and other parts of east Texas, and ozone pollution can trigger asthma attacks and respiratory problems.

=== &quot;Beyond TXU&quot; campaign ===
The Sierra Club and allies launched their &quot;Beyond TXU&quot; campaign to encourage retail electricity customers to switch from EFH&#x27;s TXU Energy to other retail electric providers without a connection to the EFH coal fleet. Through a variety of advertisements in the DFW area, coupled with a social media campaign, these groups have encouraged customers to visit www.powertochoose.org, a website administered by the Public Utility Commission of Texas, that provides information on retail electric providers.

=== Environmental litigation ===
EFH and its Luminant subsidiary are the subject of litigation by the Sierra Club for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act at the Big Brown Plant, and in 2013 a federal district court judge ruled in favor of Sierra Club on a motion by EFH to stop or slow the case from coming to trial. Similarly, Sierra Club has filed a Clean Air enforcement case against the Martin Lake Plant, and a magistrate judge in that case made a recommendation in 2013 in favor of Sierra Club on an EFH request to stop or slow the case. On July 13, 2012, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sent EFH&#x27;s Luminant subsidiary an enforcement notice under the Clean Air Act about alleged violations of the &quot;New Source Review&quot; provisions of the act, for actions taken by Luminant at the Big Brown and Martin Lake plants.

== Property tax litigation ==
Luminant, a subsidiary of Energy Future Holdings, sued Milam, Freestone, Rusk, and Titus counties in 2011 to challenge the taxable values that the counties had set for Luminant coal plants in each county. As a result of the lawsuits, Luminant reduced its tax liabilities by several hundred million dollars. As significant taxpayers in each county, the decisions have reduced funding to local school districts. Some have suggested that Luminant only sued over property appraisals for coal plant sites that will require pollution upgrades or changes in the near future.

<text>TXU Energy is an American retail electricity provider headquartered in Irving, Texas, serving residential and business customers in deregulated regions of Texas since the deregulation of the Texas electricity market in 2002. A subsidiary of Vistra Corp, it is one of the largest retail electricity providers in Texas.

== History ==
The first instance of electricity generation in North Texas dates to 1882 when Dallas Electric Lighting Company, an indirect TXU Energy predecessor, began providing electric light service to the city of Dallas. A few years later, in 1885, Fort Worth Electric Light and Power Company, another indirect TXU Energy predecessor, was founded and began servicing areas west of Dallas.

A number of electric companies formed in the years that followed: TXU Energy&#x27;s direct forerunners, the Texas Power &amp; Light Company (TP&amp;L); Dallas Power &amp; Light (DP&amp;L), to serve the Dallas area; and Texas Electric Service Company (TESCO) to serve Fort Worth and areas west of Abilene.

In 1984, DP&amp;L, TESCO, and TP&amp;L merged as divisions of a new principal subsidiary, Texas Utilities Electric Company.

In 1999, the company was renamed TXU Corp., positioning itself as a multinational energy company, eventually competing in electricity markets on three continents: Australia, Europe and North America. It eventually discontinued all operations outside of North America in 2002.

=== Deregulation ===
On May 21, 1999, the Texas Legislature passed Senate Bill 7 (SB 7), which required the creation of a competitive retail electricity market. TXU Energy was one of the first certified retail electricity providers to begin offering service at market open in 2002. TXU Corporation’s three main entities during the first several years of deregulation were TXU Energy, a retail electricity provider (REP), TXU Electric Delivery, a transmission and distribution utility (TDU) and TXU Power, a wholesale electricity generation provider. 

In 2007, through a private-equity acquisition led by KKR, TPG Capital and Goldman Sachs, TXU Corporation was acquired by Energy Future Holdings Corp. (EFH). TXU Energy retained its name, while TXU Power was renamed Luminant, and TXU Electric Delivery was renamed Oncor.

On April 29, 2014, Energy Future Holdings (EFH), TXU Energy’s parent company at the time, entered bankruptcy. In October 2016, certain subsidiaries of EFH, including TXU Energy, Luminant and EFH’s corporate services department, emerged from reorganization in a court-approved spin-off under parent company Texas Competitive Electric Holdings (TCEH), and a new CEO, Curt Morgan, was announced. Later in 2016, TCEH changed its name to Vistra Energy.

TXU Energy&#x27;s parent company, Vistra Energy, began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 10, 2017.

== Community and Conservation Initiatives ==
TXU Energy participates in a variety of community initiatives and environmental conservation efforts in Texas.

=== TXU Energy Aid ===
TXU Energy Aid began in 1983 to help customers who don’t have the means to pay for electricity service. Since its inception, TXU Energy Aid has aided 455,000 customers, totaling more than $84 million in assistance. Funds are raised from employee and customer donations.

=== Committed to Community Growth Program ===
Through its Committed to Community Growth program, TXU Energy partners with the Texas Trees Foundation to plant trees in communities across Texas. Located at Richland College, the TXU Energy Urban Tree Farm and Education Center is the largest nonprofit urban tree farm in the nation. The tree farm produces trees for the community and allows volunteers to log hours by planting, mulching and pruning. Through its partnership with the Texas Trees Foundation, over 240,000 trees have been planted across the state.

=== Houston Zoo ===
TXU Energy in 2014 passed the $1 million mark in donations to the Houston Zoo. The company has been the presenting sponsor of the Houston Zoo&#x27;s Chill Out program since 2011 and Zoo Lights since its inception. In addition, TXU Energy has sponsored other events such as the zoo&#x27;s annual Gift of Grub campaign, which matches donations up to $50,000.

<doc id="572822" wikidata="Q284595" url="?curid=572822" title="Laurier House">
<text>Laurier House () is a National Historic Site in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (in the Sandy Hill district). It was formerly the residence of two Canadian prime ministers: Sir Wilfrid Laurier (for whom the house is named) and William Lyon Mackenzie King. The home is now a historic house museum that is open to the public for guided tours from Victoria Day in May until Thanksgiving in October. Its address is 335 Laurier Avenue East.

==History==
The house was built in 1878, but it had significant later alterations. It now exhibits elements of the Italianate manner, as well as traces of Second Empire style.

Laurier lived there from 1897 until his death in 1919. His wife, Zoé Laurier, willed the house to Mackenzie King upon her death in 1921. King then lived there from 1923 until his death in 1950, and he willed the house to the Canadian Crown.

The Cabinet then briefly considered designating the home as the permanent official residence of the prime minister. However, the prime minister at the time, Louis St. Laurent, opposed designating it as such. Instead, 24 Sussex Drive—a property the Crown had acquired a few years earlier through expropriation—was selected and designated as the prime minister&#x27;s official residence in 1951.

Many distinguished guests of Canada were received at this house, such as King George VI, Sir Winston Churchill, Charles de Gaulle, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and others.

Under the terms of the &quot;Laurier House Act 1951&quot;, the home and its grounds were entrusted to the National Capital Commission (NCC), the Department of Public Works, and Library and Archives Canada. Since 1988, the house has been administered by Parks Canada as part of the national park system, operating it as a public museum. However, the NCC continues to maintain the grounds, and the national archives retain ownership of all archival materials in the house.

In 2022, a memorial plaque was installed to the first Canadian code-breaking unit.

<doc id="572825" wikidata="Q7806835" url="?curid=572825" title="Timmy Mallett">
<text>Timmy Mallett (born 18 October 1955) is an English television presenter, broadcaster, author and artist. He is known for his striking visual style, colourful glasses and shirts, and a giant pink foam mallet (known as &quot;Mallett&#x27;s Mallet&quot;), as well as his &quot;utterly brilliant!&quot; and &quot;blaaah!&quot; catchphrases.

==Career==

===Radio===

Mallett was born in Marple, Cheshire. He attended Rose Hill Primary School in Marple, Earnseat Prep School in Arnside, and Hyde Grammar School.

His media career started while he was a student at the University of Warwick where he worked on the student radio station, Radio Warwick. After graduating with a degree in History, he started working at BBC Radio Oxford. He later moved to Centre Radio (now Capital Midlands) as the station&#x27;s launch presenter. He also presented on Radio Luxembourg and Manchester&#x27;s Piccadilly Radio.

In 1982 Timmy was also part of the &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot; team on BBC Radio 1 

The programme he hosted at Piccadilly was &quot;Timmy on the Tranny&quot;, a weekday evening show that ran from 8.00pm–11.00pm and took its name from Mallett&#x27;s lunchtime and later afternoon shows on Radio Oxford. Among Mallett&#x27;s team of helpers were Chris Evans (known as &#x27;Nobby Nolevel&#x27;), Andy Bird (who played the pirate radio character &#x27;Radio Diggle&#x27;) and Karen Walsh (the original &#x27;Aunty Boney kneecaps&#x27;). This led to Mallett co-presenting the Manchester-based BBC2 youth music show &quot;Oxford Road Show&quot; for 1985 series .

Mallett won two Radio Academy Awards for Best Local Radio Presenter (1984) and Best Pop Music Show (1986).

===Television===
In 1983, Timmy joined TV-am, where he interviewed the musical act and bands of the day for the pop news strand, Timmy also presented &quot;Summer Run&quot; on Saturday mornings for the new breakfast television station. In Autumn 1984, he became a presenter of &quot;Wide Awake Club&quot;, a new Saturday morning children&#x27;s programme on TV-am, with co-presenters Michaela Strachan, James Baker, Arabella Warner and Tommy Boyd. Future actor Mike Myers also had a minor role alongside Neil Mullarkey. TV-am found itself lacking a school holidays programme after Roland Rat moved to the BBC, and he was offered the chance to present it. The replacement, a spin-off of &quot;Wide Awake Club&quot;, was called &quot;Wacaday&quot; (based on the addition of &#x27;aday&#x27; to the initials &#x27;WAC&#x27; for &quot;Wide Awake Club&quot;) and began broadcasting in October 1985.

In the Wide Awake Club, contestants were hit over the head by his famed mallet for getting answers wrong. In later years, a talking mini-version of the mallet called &quot;Pinky Punky&quot; was introduced (the name chosen after Mallett asked viewers to write in with their ideas) and soon became one of Mallett&#x27;s established sidekicks along with Magic, his pet cockatiel. &quot;Wacaday&quot; ended in 1992 when TV-am lost its franchise to broadcast.

Since then, Mallett has run his own production company, Brilliant TV.

In 1993, Mallett starred in The Children&#x27;s Channel&#x27;s &quot;Around the World in 80 seconds&quot; as Captain Everything.

From 1997 until 2002, he acted in &quot;Timmy Towers&quot;, for CITV.

===Other===
During 1983 until 1990 Mallett also co-presented numerous BBC School programmes included Radio series &quot;Looking at Nature&quot; and Radio Club. While on Television: Walrus. What Should I Do?, &quot;Wondermaths&quot;, Logo Gogo Logo and Questions

In 2002, Mallett made West Ham United agree to stop selling copies of their mascot, Herbie the Hammer, in their club shop after he complained that it looked too similar to Pinky Punky. West Ham United withdrew the item.

In 2004, he was a stand-in contestant for the ITV1 jungle-based reality series &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. In 2008, he entered the show as a full contestant.

In 2008, Mallett appeared on &quot;Big Brother&#x27;s Little Brother&quot;.

In September 2008, Mallett appeared on the BBC One politics show &quot;This Week&quot; talking about being positive when things get tough.

In November 2008, Mallett appeared in the eighth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. He entered the show by being captured in an oversized net and imprisoned in jungle jail. The celebrities were given an option to trade their possessions for him and David Van Day to enter. They refused. On 30 November 2008, Mallett was the fourth contestant eliminated from the show after being placed in the bottom two in the public voting and taking part in a play-off bush tucker eating trial with Brian Paddick.

==Music==
With producers Nigel Wright and Andrew Lloyd Webber, Mallett formed the band Bombalurina, named after a character in Lloyd Webber&#x27;s musical &quot;Cats&quot;. Along with female vocalists and dancers Dawn Andrews and Annie Dunkley, they released a cover of the single &quot;Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini&quot;. It reached number one in the UK Singles Chart in August 1990.

Follow up single &quot;Seven Little Girls Sitting in the Backseat&quot; reached number 18 in the UK in December 1990.

The Bombalurina album &quot;Huggin&#x27; And A Kissin&quot;&#x27; with 14 tracks was released in December 1990.

Ditching the Bombalurina name, but again working with producer Nigel Wright, Mallett released a cover of Kenny&#x27;s &quot;The Bump&quot; under the name M.C. Mallett in 1991. This failed to chart.

For &quot;Tommy&#x27;s Campaign&quot;, Mallett recorded &quot;The Laughing Policeman&quot; with producer George Martin in 1991.

==Sport==
Mallett is a supporter of Oxford United and Maidenhead United.

Mallett is a long-distance cycling adventurer. In 2022, he completed a solo circumnavigation of the coast of Britain, following in the footsteps of painter J. M. W. Turner. There is an online map from the Ordnance Survey showing the route, paintings and videos around nearly 5000 miles of coastline.

He rode through Northern Ireland in May 2015, Lincolnshire in summer 2015 and through Cumbria in May 2016.

In spring 2018, Mallett cycled alone from home in England through France and Spain along the pilgrimage route, the Camino de Santiago to Santiago de Compostela Finisterre and back, a distance of over 4000 km, inspired by his older brother Martin with Downs syndrome.
The story forms the basis for his memoirs &quot;Utterly Brilliant: My life&#x27;s Journey&quot;, published in 2020 by SPCK, which also includes some of the paintings produced on this adventure.

<text>It&#x27;s My Life is the second studio album by English band Talk Talk, released on 13 February 1984.

== Recording ==

Mike Oldfield&#x27;s bass player, Phil Spalding made an uncredited appearance on the album, substituting for Paul Webb on &quot;The Last Time&quot; – &quot;Paul was exclusively a fretless bass player and they needed a fretted bass on this particular track.&quot; Spalding admits to having played the whole session while disastrously hung-over, and that – foreshadowing the approach Talk Talk would take on subsequent recordings - Tim Friese-Greene and Mark Hollis insisted that he record a whole afternoon and evening of multiple takes, despite the simplicity of the part. Ian Curnow adds &quot;we always had to go all around the houses to get next door, just in case there was anything that turned up on the other side.&quot;

==Cover==

The cover to the album was produced by James Marsh, incorporating elements of &quot;The Boyhood of Raleigh&quot; by John Everett Millais.

== Release ==

&quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; was released in February 1984 by record label EMI.

&quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; was a top 5 hit album in several European countries, thanks to the big international success of its singles (notably &quot;Such a Shame&quot;), and was particularly successful in Switzerland, the Netherlands and Germany where the album peak-charted at numbers 2, 3 and 4, respectively. In the Netherlands, the album stayed in the charts for 64 weeks between 1984 and 1986. It also reached number 35 in the UK albums chart. In the United States, the album just missed the top 40, reaching number 42.

In 2000, it was voted number 872 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

In 2021, Rhino Entertainment re-released the album on limited edition purple vinyl.

<text>The S-IC (pronounced S-one-C) was the first stage of the American Saturn V rocket. The S-IC stage was manufactured by the Boeing Company. Like the first stages of most rockets, more than 90% of the mass at launch was propellant, in this case RP-1 rocket fuel and liquid oxygen (LOX) oxidizer. It was tall and in diameter. The stage provided of thrust at sea level to get the rocket through the first of ascent. The stage had five F-1 engines in a quincunx arrangement. The center engine was fixed in position, while the four outer engines could be hydraulically gimballed to control the rocket.

==Manufacturing==
The Boeing Co. was awarded the contract to manufacture the S-IC on December 15, 1961. By this time the general design of the stage had been decided on by the engineers at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). The main place of manufacture was the Michoud Assembly Facility, New Orleans. Wind tunnel testing took place in Seattle and the machining of the tools needed to build the stages at Wichita, Kansas.

MSFC built the first three test stages (S-IC-T, the S-IC-S, and the S-IC-F) and the first two flight models (S-IC-1 and -2).

It took roughly seven to nine months to build the tanks and 14 months to complete a stage. The first stage built by Boeing was S-IC-D, a test model.

In addition to the four test stages, NASA ordered 15 flight stages (S-IC-1 through -15) to support the initial Apollo program. In July 1967, NASA awarded Boeing a contract to begin long-lead-time item acquisition (such as propellant lines and tank components) for the 16th and 17th S-IC stages. A full contract for the construction of S-IC-16 to S-IC-25 was drafted throughout mid-1967, but stages past S-IC-15 were canceled altogether in October of that year due to budgetary restrictions. S-IC-16 to -25 would have been utilized for follow-on Apollo missions, including those from the Apollo Applications Program.

==Design==
The S-IC was composed of five major subsections.

The largest and heaviest single component of the S-IC was the thrust structure, with a mass of . It was designed to support the thrust of the five engines and redistribute it evenly across the base of the rocket. There were four anchors which held down the rocket as it built thrust. These were among the largest aluminum forgings produced in the U.S. at the time, long and in weight. The four stabilizing fins withstood a temperature of .

The five F-1 engines were ignited in 3 staggered events, where the center engine was first ignited, followed by two outer engines, and then the remaining two outer engines. These three ignition events were separated by just 300 milliseconds. This staggered ignition approach lessened the loads on the thrust structure, as an instantaneous ignition of all five engines would impart immense stress on the stage.

Above the thrust structure was the fuel tank, containing of RP-1 fuel. The tank itself had a mass of over dry and could release . Nitrogen was bubbled through the tank before launch to keep the fuel mixed. During the flight the fuel was pressurized using helium, which was stored in tanks in the liquid oxygen tank above. Both the thrust structure and fuel tank had alternating black and white paint, in order to monitor the vehicle&#x27;s roll during flight.

Between the fuel and liquid oxygen tanks was the intertank. This contained propellant fill and drain lines for the liquid oxygen tank as well as a portion of the five liquid oxygen feed lines for the engines.

The liquid oxygen tank held of LOX. It raised special issues for the designer. The lines through which the LOX ran to the engine had to be straight (as any bend would slow the flow of LOX, which would necessitate even larger and heavier piping) and therefore had to pass through the fuel tank. This meant insulating these lines inside a tunnel to stop fuel freezing to the outside and also meant adding five extra holes in the top of the fuel tank.

Atop the liquid oxygen tank sat the forward skirt, which connected the S-IC to the S-II stage and contained telemetry equipment and LOX tank vent lines.

Two solid motor retrorockets were located inside each of the four conical engine fairings. At separation of the S-IC from the flight vehicle, the eight retrorockets fired, blowing off removable sections of the fairings forward of the fins, and backing the S-IC away from the flight vehicle as the engines on the S-II stage were ignited.

The propellant tanks of the S-IC were manufactured from 2219-series aluminum panels, while the interstage, forward skirt, and thrust structure were built from 7075-series aluminum. The latter three sections also were corrugated with external stringers, providing additional structural support. The propellant tanks did not feature external stringers, as the tank pressurization provided sufficient rigidity.

The S-IC also carried the ODOP transponder to track the flight after takeoff.

<doc id="572831" wikidata="Q1006978" url="?curid=572831" title="G4 (American TV network)">
<text>G4 (also known as G4TV) was an American pay television and digital network owned by NBCUniversal and later Comcast Spectacor that primarily focused on video games.

The network was originally owned by G4 Media, a joint venture between the NBCUniversal Cable division of NBCUniversal and Dish Network by the time of the channel&#x27;s initial closure, and first launched on April 24, 2002. In late 2012, G4&#x27;s studio programming ceased in preparation for a planned relaunch as Esquire Network, as part of a licensing deal with Hearst Corporation, owner of &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine. Esquire Network would ultimately replace Style Network instead, on September 23, 2013. G4 announced in November 2014 that it would end all operations. The network was originally ceased operations on December 31, 2014. By August 2013, it was reported that approximately 61,217,000 American households (53.61% of households with television) were receiving the network.

On July 24, 2020, a revival of the G4 brand was announced; the network relaunched on November 16, 2021. On October 16, 2022, it was announced that Comcast would soon be shutting down the network. Its final day of operation was November 18, 2022.

==History==
===Original===
====Launch====

G4 was launched on April 24, 2002, under the ownership of Comcast. The initial concept was to create a service similar to rival TechTV but targeted at 12-to-34-year-olds, an elusive demographic. The channel was soft launched with a week-long series of &quot;Pong&quot; matches. It was initially available to three million Comcast subscribers, and offered 13 half-hour programs.

G4 was created and originally led by Charles Hirschhorn, a former president of Walt Disney Television and Television Animation. He expected video game creators themselves to eventually produce programming for the channel. He envisioned that G4 could follow in the footsteps of MTV, which provided music video producers with a venue for non-traditional television programming. Hirschhorn intended G4 to become a vehicle for unconventional advertising. In 2002, G4 offered advertisers wide latitude to place their products on G4&#x27;s programs, and even allowed their commercials to appear as if they were a part of the program. G4 offered what was called a &quot;2 minute unit&quot;, which was an advertising package played as if it were part of a G4 program that was long enough to run an entire movie trailer. G4 offered to sell the right to have a game showcased on the show &quot;Pulse&quot;.

====Merger with TechTV====
On March 25, 2004, Vulcan Inc. announced that G4 Media would acquire TechTV and merge the two networks. The combined network was rebranded as G4techTV. On February 15, 2005, less than a year after the merger, the &quot;TechTV&quot; brand was dropped from the channel&#x27;s name. A Canadian version of TechTV, originally launched on September 7, 2001, would also be relaunched under the &quot;G4techTV&quot; branding and would retain the brand until 2009.

In September 2005, Neal Tiles replaced Hirschhorn as the channel&#x27;s president. Tiles had previously been a senior marketing executive at DirecTV, Fox Sports and ESPN. He announced that G4 would be retooled as a male-oriented channel, stating that &quot;guys like to play games, but not necessarily watch a bunch of shows with games on the screen&quot;.

Comcast announced on October 12, 2006, that it would consolidate its west coast entertainment operations, including G4, E! and Style Network into a new group headed by Ted Harbert, who had formerly run E!. It was announced that the upper management of the G4 channel would relocate to E!&#x27;s Los Angeles office. Harbert gave his opinion at the time that the focus of the channel on &quot;gaming has been demonstrated as being too narrow.&quot;

In April 2007, G4, in association with Earth911, launched an electronic-waste-recycling campaign called Gcycle.

On February 17, 2009, it was reported that G4 intended to cut back its original programming. &quot;X-Play&quot; would be reduced to three nights a week while &quot;Attack of the Show!&quot; would be cut to four nights a week. Consequently, a number of the staff and production crew involved in the shows would be laid off. Layla Kayleigh also left G4 in April 2009 after Neal Tiles announced that her contract would not be renewed.

It was announced during Comic-Con 2010 that G4 would be the exclusive North American broadcaster of &quot;Marvel Anime&quot;, which made its television debut in 2011. During the week of July 26-August 1, 2010, G4 changed its logo to 4G as a promotion for Sprint Nextel&#x27;s next generation wireless internet service.

====2010–2014====

On November 1, 2010, DirecTV announced that it had removed G4 from its channel lineup, citing low interest among their subscriber base and low Nielsen ratings as the primary reason for dropping of the channel. DirecTV commented that it was &quot;...unable to reach an agreement to continue carrying the G4 channel and it has been removed from the DirecTV channel lineup.&quot;

It was reported that the UFC and WWE were in separate talks to buy G4 in 2011. The UFC eventually partnered with Fox, while WWE launched its own network on February 24, 2014.

On January 5, 2012, Neal Tiles stepped down as CEO. He was replaced by former NBCUniversal marketing chief Adam Stotsky. Long-time employees Adam Sessler and Kevin Pereira both departed the network during the first half of 2012.

On October 26, 2012, it was announced that &quot;X-Play&quot; and &quot;Attack of the Show!&quot; would be cancelled by the end of the year, ending G4&#x27;s studio programming.

In December 2012, NBCUniversal signed a brand licensing deal with the Hearst Corporation, owner of &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, to relaunch G4 into Esquire Network which would air shows aimed at a metrosexual audience about travel, cooking, fashion and non-sports related male programming, including the addition of acquired and archive NBCU content such as &quot;Party Down&quot;, &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, and week-delayed episodes of &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;. The rebranding was scheduled to take place on April 22, 2013, but was moved to an unspecified date in the summer on April 15, 2013. Network general manager Adam Stotsky stated the rebranding was pushed back in order to have a broader original series slate to launch with than would have been available for the April launch. Stotsky confirmed that a new season of &quot;American Ninja Warrior&quot; would air on the network in the summer. In May 2013, the launch date was pushed to September 23, 2013, with its first program being an 80th anniversary special for &quot;Esquire&quot;.

On September 9, 2013, news broke that NBCUniversal would instead replace the Style Network with Esquire Network, leaving G4 &quot;as is for the foreseeable future, though it&#x27;s highly unlikely the company will invest in more original programming&quot;. On September 23, 2013, G4 was dropped by Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks (Bright House carriage contracts were negotiated by Time Warner Cable), citing the network&#x27;s low viewership as &quot;(not a) good value for our customers&quot;. Verizon FiOS discontinued the channel on October 1, 2013, and Cablevision did so on October 10, 2013, pursuant to a filing with the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control (that state&#x27;s utility service regulator) a month prior, that NBCUniversal had plans to discontinue G4&#x27;s operations as of the October 10 date, though only the discontinuation of carriage by Cablevision occurred.

Late in October 2013, Charter Communications, which was one of the charter carriers of TechTV when it was a sister of that network under the ownership of Vulcan Ventures, announced its intention to drop G4 on December 17; sister network Cloo replaced G4 on its systems. On November 1, 2013, Dish Network removed it from the lineup with Esquire Network replacing G4, ending all carriage of the network from direct broadcast satellite services. Cox ceased carriage of G4 in all markets on December 31, 2013.

Comcast removed G4 from all its cable and satellite systems nationwide on January 6, 2014; the network continued to be carried on other cable systems.

Certain cable operators reported that the network would end all on-air operations on November 30, 2014, and the aforementioned providers continued airing the network until the alleged cutoff date (or when their contracts with G4 were fully exhausted), ending all carriage of the network from cable providers and cable television services.
The final day of G4 in its previous iteration was a marathon of the Top 100 Video Games of All Time, followed by the last program being the debut episode of &quot;X-Play&quot;. A note on the G4 website&#x27;s program schedule was added to that particular episode saying &quot;Thanks for watching G4.&quot; The network would cease broadcasting with a game of &quot;Pong&quot; on the screen, referencing the network&#x27;s launch, gradually getting smaller and smaller before becoming just a small dot, followed by the sound of San Diego Comic-Con attendee Ramses to Kevin Pereira shouting &quot;I&#x27;’M AT COMIC CON!!&quot;, (possibly alluding to G4 dying and going to Comic-Con, occasionally nicknamed &quot;nerd heaven&quot;), as the dot shut off like an analog TV alongside the Atari 2600 version of Donkey Kong&#x27;s death sounds and the Game Boy start-up chime, thus symbolically ending the network with a &quot;game over&quot;.

===Revival===
====Pre-launch and &quot;B4G4&quot;====

On July 24, 2020, the Twitter accounts of G4, &quot;Attack of the Show!&quot; and &quot;X-Play&quot; were reactivated to post a teaser video announcing a revival of the network slated for 2021. The teaser was released during &quot;Comic-Con@Home&quot;, the first virtual streaming edition of San Diego Comic-Con. G4&#x27;s website was reopened with a playable game of &quot;Pong&quot; which, if won, redirected to a mailing list to sign up for updates and a free shirt promo code. The campaign was in-reference to the network&#x27;s original launch in 2002 and their shutdown in 2014. Comcast would transfer operations of G4 from NBCUniversal to its Spectacor division (former owners of the now-defunct PRISM regional premium cable television channel).

On August 12, 2020, Olivia Munn, the former co-host of &quot;Attack of the Show!&quot;, was reportedly in final talks for a multi-year deal with G4.

On September 4, 2020, the official G4 YouTube channel uploaded a video featuring former &quot;X-Play&quot; host Adam Sessler as one of his fictional characters, Crazy Adam, asking for fans to submit applications to become a G4 host or simply nominate their favorite personalities with the hashtag, #G4NeedsTalent.

On November 16, 2020, G4 announced &quot;A Very Special G4 Holiday Reunion Special&quot;, a scripted special hosted by Ron Funches featuring interviews with Kevin Pereira, Olivia Munn, Adam Sessler, Morgan Webb, Kristin Adams, and Blair Herter. The special premiered on November 24 on Twitch and YouTube; Syfy would also air the special on November 27. At the special&#x27;s end, wrestler Xavier &quot;King&quot; Woods / Austin Creed would be the first newly announced host for G4&#x27;s relaunch, after beginning a campaign on Twitter to become a G4 personality in August 2020. On the same day of the special&#x27;s premiere, G4 launched &quot;Gravython&quot;, a charity drive that would be raising funds for a variety of community partners.

On January 28, 2021, G4 announced that both &quot;Attack of the Show!&quot; and &quot;X-Play&quot; would be revived due to high demand from fans. They also gave a tentative date of Summer 2021 for the network&#x27;s relaunch. The following day, the company launched the &quot;B4G4&quot; brand, featuring short-form experimental content on YouTube and Twitter created to gain feedback from audiences that would help determine the shows for G4&#x27;s relaunch. On February 12, 2021, the B4G4 iterations of &quot;Attack of the Show!&quot; and &quot;X-Play&quot; began, with Kevin Pereira and Adam Sessler returning to host their respective series; these involved humorous sketches for &quot;AOTS&quot; and Let&#x27;s Plays with other gaming-based streamers and YouTubers alongside Sessler for &quot;X-Play&quot;. On the same day, it was announced that Esports shoutcasters Indiana &quot;Froskurinn&quot; Black and Ovilee May would be the network&#x27;s new hosts, helming the series &quot;The Bleep Esports Show&quot; - a satirical program focusing on current gaming-related news. In March, the network also began livestreaming on both Twitch and YouTube, where its hosts interact with the audience and do watch-alongs to new B4G4 videos.

On April 2, 2021, G4 uploaded a video on their YouTube channel revealing the return of &quot;Epic April&quot;, a month dedicated to new announcements. On April 5, G4 revealed the development of a new competitive series hosted by Xavier &quot;King&quot; Woods / Austin Creed in partnership with WWE to air in the fall. On April 11, Esports shoutcaster, &quot;The Titan Games&quot; commentator and former AEW commentator Alex &quot;Goldenboy&quot; Mendez was announced to be joining the network as a new host. On April 14, 2021, G4 announced that &quot;Ninja Warrior&quot;, an English-dubbed version of the Japanese show &quot;SASUKE&quot; (itself the original Japanese version of &quot;American Ninja Warrior&quot;), would be returning to the network with 3 new tournaments and a total of 167 episodes. On April 19, comedian and YouTuber Kassem G was announced to be joining the network as a new host. On April 28, Adam Sessler and Kassem G revealed during a livestream that cosplayer Jefferson &quot;Jeffersawrus&quot; Carvey was the network&#x27;s first #G4NeedsTalent hire. Its final &quot;Epic April&quot; announcement was made on the 30th, where Virtual YouTuber and livestreamer character CodeMiko, along with her creator known only as &quot;The Technician&quot;, would be joining as a new host.

On May 5, 2021, G4 was announced to be the official broadcaster of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Live&quot;, airing on July 16 and 17. On May 14, YouTuber and podcaster Gina Darling was revealed during a livestream with Adam Sessler and Kassem G to be joining as a new host.

====Relaunch====
On October 12, 2021, it was announced that G4&#x27;s cable network would officially return on November 16, 2021.

In November 2021, it was announced that airings of select episodes of the web series &quot;Scott the Woz&quot; would air on G4 in one-hour blocks. The show was scheduled to debut on December 7, 2021, at 6:30 pm EST but due to technical difficulties involving Amazon Web Services, it did not air in that timeslot. The show would officially debut at 10:30 pm EST.

The network officially relaunched on November 16 at 6 a.m. EST, with a marathon of the original &quot;Ninja Warrior&quot;, occasionally featuring reruns of the &quot;Very Special G4 Holiday Reunion Special&quot; from the previous year. The &quot;Catastrophic Launch Special&quot; was broadcast on the network&#x27;s Twitch and YouTube channels that same evening, before airing on the cable network on the next day.

On March 7, 2022, G4 launched a FAST channel on Pluto TV called G4 Select, which carries most of G4&#x27;s regular programming. As part of an exclusive partnership, the channel would also feature new content catered to free, linear streaming audiences. The channel was later added to Vizio&#x27;s WatchFree platform on June 16, 2022.

==== End of revival ====

On October 16, 2022, it was announced that G4 would be ceasing operations after relaunching the previous year. 

Several factors that led to G4&#x27;s discontinuation ranged from low viewership, a lack of audience strategy, ever-changing and absent leadership, competition with streaming content creators on YouTube and Twitch, cord-cutting, underpromotion, and high expenditures. G4 Select would be removed from Pluto TV on October 19, 2022, during an episode of &quot;Attack of the Show: Vibe Check&quot;, the network fully sunsetting operations on October 21, ending two minutes into &quot;Smosh&quot;; G4 Select would later cease on Vizio. G4 in itself left Philo, YouTube TV, Xfinity, and Cox prior to the shutdown, with Fios being the last to carry the network until the true discontinuation date, November 18, 2022, two days after the first anniversary of the re-launch.

The final programs aired were a marathon of &quot;Xplay&quot;, with segments from other G4 programs added during commercial breaks or between episodes. Similar to how the original network ended in 2014 with the first episode of &quot;Xplay&quot; from 2003, the final full episode to air was the first episode from the &quot;Xplay&quot; relaunch in 2021. This was followed by a zoomed-out photo of former &quot;Attack of the Show&quot; host Gina Darling&#x27;s forehead, with a still game of &quot;Pong&quot; etched onto it and text reading, &quot;G4&quot; and &quot;Thanks 4 watching!,&quot; along with Kassem G&#x27;s deadpan voice saying &quot;I&#x27;m at Comic-Con.&quot; referencing the first time the network stopped transmitting. A screen reading &quot;THANK YOU FOR WATCHING!&quot; was set to appear after midnight, however Fios cut their signal just seconds prior to midnight, ending in the middle of the sign-off.

==Programming==

In addition to video game culture, G4&#x27;s programming encompassed geek, fandom, genre, and general audience shows aimed at young adults. The network primarily livestreams its original programming on their Twitch and YouTube channels. These livestreams are edited to air on the linear television channel and video on demand platforms the next day. The television channel&#x27;s programming currently features reruns of past G4 shows, as well as other acquired programs. &quot;Pulse&quot; was a prerecorded weekly news show that focused on the gaming industry that aired on G4. In November 2004, along with other G4techTV programs, the show was cancelled. News segments were merged with revamped version of &quot;The Screen Savers&quot; (later &quot;Attack of the Show&quot;), though eventually those duties were taken over by the editorial staff of &quot;X-Play&quot;.

G4&#x27;s website previously featured game trailers and reviews, select video clips of its original shows, and web original programming. The website continued providing entertainment-related news articles until May 31, 2013, with the last article posted on G4&#x27;s website as a replacement for the site&#x27;s schedule section, was a notice stating that &quot;NBCUniversal has discontinued all operations for G4&quot; seven days after the network left the air. The website was relaunched on July 24, 2020, coinciding with the announcement of the network&#x27;s revival.

<text>The Colour of Spring is the third studio album by English band Talk Talk, released on 17 February 1986. Written by Mark Hollis and producer Tim Friese-Greene, the album combines elements of jazz and art pop in an effort by Hollis to embrace more organic instrumentation and production values. Unlike previous Talk Talk albums, synthesizers are rarely featured on the album, being replaced by guitar, piano, and organ. The album went on to become Talk Talk&#x27;s greatest commercial success, spawning the hit singles &quot;Life&#x27;s What You Make It&quot; and &quot;Living in Another World&quot; and reaching the Top 20 in numerous countries (topping the Dutch charts), including the UK, where it reached No. 8 and stayed in the UK charts for 21 weeks.

==Background==

&quot;The Colour of Spring&quot; is commonly viewed as a bridge between Talk Talk&#x27;s earlier, synthesized pop sound, and their later, more improvisation-based work. Despite the extensive use of synthesizers on the previous two albums, Hollis was vocal in his distaste for them, stating that they were used primarily for economic reasons and that “if they didn’t exist, I’d be delighted.” During the recording of the album, Hollis frequently listened to the music of composers such as Erik Satie, Claude Debussy, and Béla Bartók, with the latter being a particularly significant influence on the album.

Like other Talk Talk albums, outside musicians were heavily utilized. Guests contributing to the album include Robbie McIntosh adding guitar, and Steve Winwood, who played organ on the hit &quot;Living in Another World&quot;, alongside &quot;Happiness is Easy&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Believe in You&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;The Colour of Spring&quot; became the band&#x27;s highest selling non-compilation studio album, reaching the Top 20 in numerous countries (topping the Dutch charts), including the UK, where it reached No. 8 and stayed in the UK charts for 21 weeks. It did not quite match the sales of its predecessor in the United States but was nonetheless their last album to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, reaching number 58. With the international hit &quot;Life&#x27;s What You Make It&quot;, Talk Talk expanded their fan base. The song became the band&#x27;s fourth of four American hits, along with 1982&#x27;s &quot;Talk Talk&quot; and 1984&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; and &quot;Such a Shame&quot;.

The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>The S-II (pronounced &quot;S-two&quot;) was the second stage of the Saturn V rocket. It was built by North American Aviation. Using liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) it had five J-2 engines in a quincunx pattern. The second stage accelerated the Saturn V through the upper atmosphere with of thrust.

==History==

The beginning of the S-II came in December 1959 when a committee recommended the design and construction of a high-thrust, liquid hydrogen fueled engine. The contract for this engine was given to Rocketdyne and it would be later called the J-2. At the same time the S-II stage design began to take shape. Initially it was to have four J-2 engines and be in length and in diameter.

In 1961 the Marshall Space Flight Center began the process to find the contractor to build the stage. Out of the 30 aerospace companies invited to a conference where the initial requirements were laid out, only seven submitted proposals a month later. Three of these were eliminated after their proposals had been investigated. However it was then decided that the initial specifications for the entire rocket were too small and so it was decided to increase the size of the stages used. This raised difficulties for the four remaining companies as NASA had still not yet decided on various aspects of the stage including size, and the upper stages that would be placed on top.

On September 11, 1961, the contract was awarded to North American Aviation (who were also awarded the contract for the Apollo Command/Service Module), with the manufacturing plant built by the government at Seal Beach, California. 15 flight stages were to be produced.

Plans were also developed to build 10 follow-on stages, S-II-16 through -25, but funding to assemble them never materialized. These stages would have supported later Apollo missions, including those of the Apollo Applications Program.

==Configuration==
 When fully loaded with propellant, the S-II had a mass of about . The hardware was only 7.6% of this—92.4% was liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.

At the bottom was the thrust structure supporting five J-2 engines in a quincunx arrangement. The center engine was fixed, while the other four were gimballed, similar to the engines on the S-IC stage below.

Instead of using an &quot;intertank&quot; (empty container between tanks) like the S-IC, the S-II used a common bulkhead (similar to that of the S-IV and S-IVB stages) that included both the top of the LOX tank and bottom of the LH2 tank. It consisted of two aluminum sheets separated by a honeycomb structure made of phenolic resin. It insulated a temperature differential between the two tanks. The use of a common bulkhead saved 3.6 tonnes in weight, both by eliminating one bulkhead and by reducing the overall length of the stage. The S-II&#x27;s common bulkhead design was tested in 1965 on the subscale Common Bulkhead Test Tank (CBTT), made of only 2 LH2 tank cylinders.

The LOX tank was an ellipsoidal container of 10 meters diameter and 6.7 meters high holding up to or of oxidizer. It was formed by welding 12 gores (large triangular sections) and two circular pieces for the top and bottom. The gores were shaped by positioning in a 211,000-liter tank of water with three carefully orchestrated sets of underwater explosions to shape each gore.

The LH2 tank was constructed of six cylinders: five were 2.4 meters high and the sixth was 0.69 meters high. The biggest challenge was the insulation. Liquid hydrogen must be kept colder than about 20 °C above absolute zero () so good insulation is very important. Initial attempts did not work well: there were bonding issues and air pockets. Initially, the stage was insulated with a honeycomb material. These panels had grooves milled in the back which were purged with helium during filling. The final method was to spray insulation on by hand and trim the excess. This change saved both weight and time and avoided the issues with air pockets entirely. The LH2 tank volume was for storing of liquid hydrogen.

The S-II was constructed vertically to aid welding and keep the large circular sections in the correct shape.

<text>A living wage is defined as the minimum income necessary for a worker to meet their basic needs. This is not the same as a subsistence wage, which refers to a biological minimum, or a solidarity wage, which refers to a minimum wage tracking labor productivity. Needs are defined to include food, housing, and other essential needs such as clothing. The goal of a living wage is to allow a worker to afford a basic but decent standard of living through employment without government subsidies. Due to the flexible nature of the term &quot;needs&quot;, there is not one universally accepted measure of what a living wage is and as such it varies by location and household type. A related concept is that of a family wage – one sufficient to not only support oneself, but also to raise a family.

The living wage differs from the minimum wage in that the latter can fail to meet the requirements for a basic quality of life, which leaves the worker to rely on government programs for additional income. Living wages have typically only been adopted in municipalities. In economic terms, a minimum wage is a price floor for labor created by a legal threshold, rather than a reservation wage created by price discovery. The living wage is one possible guideline for determining a target price floor, while a minimum wage is a policy to enforce a chosen price floor.
In the United Kingdom and New Zealand, advocates define a living wage to mean that a person working 40 hours a week, with no additional income, should be able to afford the basics for a modest but decent life, such as food, shelter, utilities, transport, health care, and child care. Living wage advocates have further defined a living wage as the wage equivalent to the poverty line for a family of four. The income would have to allow the family to &quot;secure food, shelter, clothing, health care, transportation and other necessities of living in modern society&quot;. The definition of a living wage used by the Greater London Authority (GLA) is the threshold wage, calculated as an income of 60% of the median, and an additional 15% to allow for unforeseen events.

Living wage campaigns came about partially as a response to Reaganomics and Thatcherism in the US and UK, respectively, which shifted macroeconomic policy towards neoliberalism. A living wage, by increasing the purchasing power of low income workers, is supported by Keynesian and post-Keynesian economics, which focuses on stimulating demand in order to improve the state of the economy.

== History ==

The concept of a living wage, though it was not defined as such, can be traced back to the works of ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. Both argued for an income that considers needs, particularly those that ensure the communal good. Aristotle saw self-sufficiency as a requirement for happiness which he defined as, &#x27;that which on its own makes life worthy of choice and lacking in nothing&#x27;. As he placed the responsibility in ensuring that the poor could earn a sustainable living in the state, his ideas are seen as an early example of support for a living wage. 
The evolution of the concept can be seen later on in medieval scholars such as Thomas Aquinas who argued for a &#x27;just wage&#x27;. The concept of a just wage was related to that of just prices, which were those that allowed everyone access to necessities. Prices and wages that prevented access to necessities were considered unjust as they would imperil the virtue of those without access.

In &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;, Adam Smith recognized that rising real wages lead to the &quot;improvement in the circumstances of the lower ranks of people&quot; and are therefore an advantage to society. Growth and a system of liberty were the means by which the laboring poor were able to secure higher wages and an acceptable standard of living. Rising real wages are secured by growth through increasing productivity against stable price levels, i.e. prices not affected by inflation. A system of liberty, secured through political institutions whereupon even the &quot;lower ranks of people&quot; could secure the opportunity for higher wages and an acceptable standard of living.
Based on these writings, Smith advocated that labor should receive an equitable share of what labor produces. For Smith, this equitable share amounted to more than subsistence. Smith equated the interests of labor and the interests of land with overarching societal interests. He reasoned that as wages and rents rise, as a result of higher productivity, societal growth will occur thus increasing the quality of life for the greater part of its members.

Like Smith, supporters of a living wage argue that the greater good for society is achieved through higher wages and a living wage. It is argued that government should in turn attempt to align the interests of those pursuing profits with the interests of the labor in order to produce societal advantages for the majority of society. Smith argued that higher productivity and overall growth led to higher wages that in turn led to greater benefits for society. Based on his writings, one can infer that Smith would support a living wage commensurate with the overall growth of the economy. This, in turn, would lead to more happiness and joy for people, while helping to keep families and people out of poverty. Political institutions can create a system of liberty for individuals to ensure opportunity for higher wages through higher production and thus stable growth for society.

In 1891, Pope Leo XIII issued a papal bull entitled &quot;Rerum novarum&quot;, which is considered the Catholic Church&#x27;s first expression of a view supportive of a living wage. The church recognized that wages should be sufficient to support a family. This position has been widely supported by the church since that time, and has been reaffirmed by the papacy on multiple occasions, such as by Pope Pius XI in 1931 &quot;Quadragesimo anno&quot; and again in 1961, by Pope John XXIII writing in the encyclical &quot;Mater et magistra.&quot; More recently, Pope John Paul II wrote, &quot;Hence in every case a just wage is the concrete means of verifying the whole socioeconomic system and, in any case, of checking that it is functioning justly.&quot;

== Contemporary thought ==

Different ideas on a living wage have been advanced by modern campaigns that have pushed for localities to adopt them. Supporters of a living wage have argued that a wage is more than just compensation for labour. It is a means of securing a living and it leads to public policies that address both the level of the wage and its decency. Contemporary research by Andrea Werner and Ming Lim has analyzed the works of John Ryan, Jerold Waltman and Donald Stabile for their philosophical and ethical insights on a living wage.

John Ryan argues for a living wage from a rights perspective. He considers a living wage to be a right that all labourers are entitled to from the &#x27;common bounty of nature&#x27;. He argues that private ownership of resources precludes access to them by others who would need them to maintain themselves. As such, the obligation to fulfill the right of a living wage rests on the owners and employers of private resources. His argument goes beyond that a wage should provide mere subsistence but that it should provide humans with the capabilities to &#x27;develop within reasonable limits all [their] faculties, physical, intellectual, moral and spiritual.&#x27; A living wage for him is &#x27;the amount of remuneration that is sufficient to maintain decently the laborer&quot;&#x27;.&quot;

Jerold Waltman, in &quot;A Case for the Living Wage,&quot; argues for a living wage not based on individual rights but from a communal, or &#x27;civic republicanism&#x27;, perspective. He sees the need for citizens to be connected to their community, and thus, sees individual and communal interests as inseparably bound. Two major problems that are antithetical to civic republicanism are poverty and inequality. A living wage is meant to address these by providing the material basis that allows individuals a degree of autonomy and prevents disproportionate income and wealth that would inevitably lead to a societal fissure between the rich and poor. A living wage further allows for political participation by all classes of people which is required to prevent the political interests of the rich from undermining the needs of the poor. These arguments for a living wage, taken together, can be seen as necessary elements for &#x27;social sustainability and cohesion&#x27;.
Donald Stabile argues for a living wage based on moral economic thought and its related themes of sustainability, capability and externality. Broadly speaking, Stabile indicates that sustainability in the economy may require that people have the means for &#x27;decent accommodation, transport, clothing and personal care&#x27;. He qualifies the statement as he sees individual necessities as contextual and therefore able to change over time, between cultures and under different macroeconomic circumstances. This suggests that the concept and definition of a living wage cannot be made objective over all places and in all times. Stabile&#x27;s thoughts on capabilities make direct reference to Amartya Sen&#x27;s work on capability approach. The tie-in with a living wage is the idea that income is an important, though not exclusive, means for capabilities. The enhancement of people&#x27;s capabilities allows them to better function both in society and as workers. These capabilities are further passed down from parents to children. Finally, Stabile analyses the lack of a living wage as the imposition of negative externalities on others. These externalities take the form of depleting the stock of workers by &#x27;exploiting and exhausting the workforce&#x27;. This leads to economic inefficiency as businesses end up overproducing their products due to not paying the full cost of labour.

Other contemporary accounts have taken up the theme of externalities arising due to a lack of living wage. Muilenburg and Singh see welfare programs, such as housing and school meals, as being a subsidy for employers that allow them to pay low wages. This subsidy, taking the form of an externality, is of course paid for by society in the form of taxes. This thought is repeated by Grimshaw who argues that employers offset the social costs of maintaining their workforce through tax credits, housing, benefits and other wage subsidies. The issue was raised during the Democratic party primary election of 2016 in the United States, when presidential candidate Bernie Sanders mentioned that &quot;struggling working families should not have to subsidise the wealthiest family in the country&quot;, and therefore, implied that the large retailer Walmart, who is owned by the wealthiest family in the country, was not paying fair wages and was being subsidised by taxpayers.

Those in favor of living wage ordinances primarily research the negative impacts of insufficient minimum wages. In a cross-comparison between minimum wage and living wage ordinances, there are profound psychological impacts to living wage implementations. Those in favor of living wage oriented policies assert that it is important to acknowledge the region-specific costs that is severely lacking in minimum wage measurements. This line of thinking argues that a living wage can both enhance engagement and performance if implemented.

== Implementations ==

=== Australia ===

In Australia, the 1907 Harvester Judgement ruled that an employer was obliged to pay his employees a wage that guaranteed them a standard of living which was reasonable for &quot;a human being in a civilised community&quot; to live in &quot;frugal comfort estimated by current... standards,&quot; regardless of the employer&#x27;s capacity to pay. Justice H. B. Higgins established a wage of 7/- (7 shillings) per day or 42/- per week as a &#x27;fair and reasonable&#x27; minimum wage for unskilled workers.

=== Bangladesh ===
In Bangladesh, salaries are among the lowest in the world. During 2012 wages hovered around US$38 per month depending on the exchange rate. Studies by Professor Doug Miller during 2010 to 2012, have highlighted the evolving global trade practices in &quot;Towards Sustainable Labour Costing in UK Fashion Retail&quot;. This white paper published in 2013 by University of Manchester, appears to suggest that the competition among buying organisation has implications to low wages in countries such as Bangladesh. It has laid down a road map to achieve sustainable wages.

=== United Kingdom ===

Municipal regulation of wage levels began in some towns in the British Isles in 1524. National minimum wage law began with Winston Churchill&#x27;s Trade Boards Act 1909, and the Wages Councils Act 1945 set minimum wage standards in many sectors of the economy. Wages Councils were abolished in 1993 and subsequently replaced with a single statutory national minimum wage by the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, which is still in force. The rates are reviewed each year by the country&#x27;s Low Pay Commission. From 1 April 2016 the minimum wage has been paid as a mandatory National Living Wage for workers over 25. It was phased in between 2016 and 2020 and was set at a significantly higher level than previous minimum wage rates. By 2020 it was expected to have risen to at least £9 per hour and represent a full-time annual pay equivalent to 60% of the median UK earnings. In practice the level remained below £9 per hour until 2022.

The National Living Wage is nevertheless lower than the value of the Living Wage calculated by the Living Wage Foundation. Some organisations voluntarily pay a living wage to their staff, at a level somewhat higher than the statutory level. From September 2014 all NHS Wales staff have been paid a minimum of the &quot;living wage&quot; recommended by the Living Wage Commission. About 2,400 employees received an initial salary increase of up to £470 above the UK-wide Agenda for Change rates.

=== United States ===

As of 2006, U.S. cities with living wage laws include Santa Fe and Albuquerque in New Mexico; San Francisco, California; and Washington, D.C. The city of Chicago, Illinois, also passed a living wage ordinance in 2006, but it was vetoed by Mayor Richard M. Daley. Living wage laws typically cover only businesses that receive state assistance or have contracts with the government.

In 2014, Wisconsin Service Employees International Union teamed up with public officials against legislation to eliminate local living wages. According to U.S. Department of Labor data, Wisconsin Jobs Now - a non-profit organization fighting inequality through higher wages - has received at least $2.5 million from SEIU organizations from 2011 to 2013.

Although these ordinances are recent, a number of studies have attempted to measure the impact of these policies on wages and employment. Researchers have had difficulty measuring the impact of these policies because it is difficult to isolate a control group for comparison. A notable study defined the control group as the subset of cities that attempted to pass a living wage law but were unsuccessful. This comparison indicates that living wages raise the average wage level in cities. However, it reduces the likelihood of employment for individuals in the bottom percentile of wage distribution.

==Impact==

Research shows that minimum wage laws and living wage legislation impact poverty differently: evidence demonstrates that living wage legislation reduces poverty. The parties impacted by minimum wage laws and living wage laws differ as living wage legislation generally applies to a more limited sector of the population. It is estimated that workers who qualify for the living wage legislation are currently between 1-2% of the bottom quartile of wage distribution. Real life implications to living wage legislation is important to address. Raising wages can decrease job opportunities for low wage workers as it cuts costs for profit seeking organizations and companies. The pool gets smaller despite an increase in wage rates.

Neumark and Adams, in their paper, &quot;Do living wage ordinances reduce urban poverty?&quot;, state, &quot;There is evidence that living wage ordinances modestly reduce the poverty rates in locations in which these ordinances are enacted. However, there is no evidence that state minimum wage laws do so.&quot;

A study carried out in Hamilton, Canada by Zeng and Honig indicated that living wage workers have higher affective commitment and lower turnover intention. Workers paid a living wage were more likely to support the organization they work for in various ways including: &quot;protecting the organizations public image, helping colleagues solve problems, improving their skills and techniques, providing suggestions or advice to a management team, and caring about the organization.&quot; The authors interpret these finding through social exchange theory, which points out the mutual obligation employers and employees feel towards each other when employees perceive they are provided favorable treatment.

Living wage policies reduce poverty by addressing financial insecurity and signaling fairness and dignity, fostering employee commitment and organizational stability.

==Living wage estimates==
As of 2003, there are 122 living wage ordinances in American cities and an additional 75 under discussion. Article 23 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that &quot;Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and for his family an existence worthy of human dignity.&quot;

In addition to legislative acts, many corporations have adopted voluntary codes of conduct. The Sullivan Principles in South Africa are an example of a voluntary code of conduct that state that firms should compensate workers to at least cover their basic needs.

In the table below, cross national comparable living wages were estimated for twelve countries and reported in local currencies and purchasing power parity (PPP). Living wage estimates for the year 2000 range from US$1.7 PPP per hour, in low-income examples, to approximately US$11.6 PPP per hour, in high-income examples.

Living wage estimates vary considerably by area, and may be calculated in different ways. In a 2019 report, the U.S. advocacy group National Low Income Housing Coalition calculated the necessary full-time hourly wage to spend 30% of income on rental of a fair-market, 2-bedroom apartment. Estimates range from a high of $36.82/hr in Hawaii (where minimum wage is $10.10/hr) to $14.26 in Arkansas (the lowest state, raising its minimum from $9.25 to $11/hr) and $9.59/hr in Puerto Rico (where minimum wage is $7.25/hr).

==Living wage movements==

===Living Wage Foundation===
The Living Wage Campaign in the United Kingdom originated in London, where it was launched in 2001 by members of the community organisation London Citizens (now Citizens UK). It engaged in a series of Living Wage campaigns and in 2005 the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate the London Living Wage, although the authority had no power to enforce it. The London Living Wage was developed in 2008 when Trust for London awarded a grant of over £1 million for campaigning, research and an employer accreditation scheme. The Living Wage campaign subsequently grew into a national movement with local campaigns across the UK. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation funded the Centre for Research in Social Policy (CRSP) at Loughborough University to calculate a UK-wide Minimum Income Standard (MIS) figure, an average across the whole of the UK independent of the higher living costs in London.

In 2011 the CRSP used the MIS as the basis for developing a standard model for setting the UK Living Wage outside of London. Citizens UK, a nationwide community organising institution developed out of London Citizens, launched the Living Wage Foundation and Living Wage Employer mark. Since 2011, the Living Wage Foundation has accredited thousands of employers that pay its proposed living wage. The living wage in London is calculated by GLA Economics and the CRSP calculates the out-of-London Living Wage. Their recommended hourly rates for 2015 are £9.40 for London and £8.25 for the rest of the UK. These rates are updated annually in November. In January 2016 the Living Wage Foundation set up a new Living Wage Commission to oversee the calculation of the Living Wage rates in the UK.

In 2012, research into the costs and benefits of a living wage in London was funded by the Trust for London and carried out by Queen Mary University of London. Further research was published in 2014 in a number of reports on the potential impact of raising the UK&#x27;s statutory national minimum wage to the same level as the Living Wage Foundation&#x27;s living wage recommendation. This included two reports funded by the Trust for London and carried out by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) and Resolution Foundation: &quot;Beyond the Bottom Line&quot; and &quot;What Price a Living Wage?&quot; Additionally, Landman Economics published &quot;The Economic Impact of Extending the Living Wage to all Employees in the UK&quot;.

A 2014 report by the Living Wage Commission, chaired by Doctor John Sentamu, the Archbishop of York, recommended that the UK government should pay its own workers a &quot;living wage&quot;, but that it should be voluntary for the private sector. Data published in late 2014 by New Policy Institute and Trust for London found 20% of employees in London were paid below the Living Wage Foundation&#x27;s recommended living wage between 2011 and 2013. The proportion of residents paid less than this rate was highest in Newham (37%) and Brent (32%). Research by the Office for National Statistics in 2014 indicated that at that time the proportion of jobs outside London paying less than the living wage was 23%. The equivalent figure within London was 19%. Research by Loughborough University, commissioned by Trust for London, shows 4 in 10 Londoners cannot afford a decent standard of living - that is one that allows them to meet their basic needs and participate in society at a minimum level. This is significantly higher than the 30% that fall below the standard in the UK as a whole. This represents 3.5 million Londoners, an increase of 400,000 since 2010/11. The research highlights the need to improve incomes through better wages, mainly, the London Living Wage, to ensure more Londoners reach a decent standard of living.

Ed Miliband, the leader of the Labour Party in opposition from 2010 until 2015, supported a living wage and proposed tax breaks for employers who adopted it. The Labour Party has implemented a living wage in some local councils which it controls, such as in Birmingham and Cardiff councils. The Green Party also supports the introduction of a living wage, believing that the national minimum wage should be 60% of net national average earnings. Sinn Féin also supports the introduction of a living wage for Northern Ireland. Other supporters include &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper columnist Polly Toynbee, Church Action on Poverty, the Scottish Low Pay Unit, and Bloomsbury Fightback!.

===Republic of Ireland===
There has been an active living wage campaign in the Republic of Ireland since 2014. It is supported by The Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice (VPSJ), Nevin Economic Research Institute (NERI), TASC, Social Justice Ireland, UCD School of Social Policy, Social Work and Social Justice, SIPTU, Unite the Union and the Society of St Vincent de Paul.

Below is a table of the hourly minimum wage (for adults), and the living wage recommended by the living wage campaign, for each year since 2014.
It is calculated on the basis of the VPSJ&#x27;s Minimum Essential Standard of Living (MESL) research, and set by the Living Wage Technical Group, benchmarked against the cost of minimum standard of living. It is supported by the political parties Sinn Féin, Labour and the Social Democrats, while Solidarity–People Before Profit recommend a living wage of €15. Aontú support a living wage, with different regional rates, and have also recommended a &quot;living pension.&quot;

It has been opposed by employers including Ibec and the Irish Small Firms Association (ISFA), while the supermarket chains Lidl and Aldi committed to pay all their employees the living wage in 2020.

In 2021, the Low Pay Commission began to study the living wage, and to decide if there should be different living wages for different age categories or regions.

===Asia Floor Wage===
Launched in 2009, Asia Floor Wage is a loose coalition of labour and other groups seeking to implement a Living Wage throughout Asia, with a particular focus on textile manufacturing. There are member associations in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Hong Kong S.A.R., India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Turkey as well as supporters in Europe and North America. The campaign targets multinational employers who do not pay their developing world workers a living wage.

=== United States living wage campaigns ===

====New York City====

The proposed law will inform tax-payers of where their investment dollars go and will hold developers to more stringent employment standards. The proposed act will require developers who receive substantial tax-payer funded subsidies to pay employees a minimum living wage. The law is designed to raise quality of life and stimulate local economy. Specifically the proposed act will guarantee that workers in large developmental projects will receive a wage of at least $10.00 an hour. The living wage will get indexed so that it keeps up with cost of living increases. Furthermore, the act will require that employees who do not receive health insurance from their employer will receive an additional $1.50 an hour to subsidize their healthcare expenses. Workers employed at a subsidized development will also be entitled to the living wage guarantee.

Many city officials have opposed living wage requirements because they believe that they restrict business climate thus making cities less appealing to potential industries. Logistically cities must hire employees to administer the ordinance. Conversely advocates for the legislation have acknowledged that when wages aren&#x27;t sufficient, low-wage workers are often forced to rely on public assistance in the form of food stamps or Medicaid.

James Parrott of the Fiscal Policy Institute testified during a May 2011 New York City Council meeting that real wages for low-wage workers in the city have declined substantially over the last 20 years, despite dramatic increases in average education levels. A report by the Fiscal Policy Institute indicated that business tax subsidies have grown two and a half times faster than overall New York City tax collections and asks why these public resources are invested in poverty-level jobs. Mr. Parrott testified that income inequality in New York City exceeds that of other large cities, with the highest-earning 1 percent receiving 44 percent of all income.

====Miami-Dade County====
The Community Coalition for a Living Wage (CCLW) was launched in 1997 in Miami, Florida, as a partnership between local anti-poverty and labor organizations Catalyst Miami, Legal Services of Greater Miami, and the South Florida AFL–CIO. The CCLW organized the successful campaign for the passage of a Miami-Dade County living wage ordinance in 1999, the first of its kind in the South. The ordinance requires Miami-Dade County and its contractors to pay all employees a living wage pegged to inflation: $12.63/hr with benefits, or $15 without (as of 2018).

====University of Virginia====
In February 2012, a Living Wage Campaign at the University of Virginia released a series of demands to University administrators calling for a living wage policy at the university. These demands included a requirement that the university &quot;explicitly address&quot; the issue by 17 February. Although University President Teresa Sullivan did respond to the demands in a mass email sent to the university community shortly before the end of the day on 17 February, the Campaign criticized her response as &quot;intentionally misleading&quot; and vowed to take action.

On 18 February, the campaign announced that 12 students would begin a hunger strike to publicize the plight of low-paid workers.

==Criticism==

Criticisms against the implementation of living wage laws have taken similar forms to those against minimum wage. Economically, both can be analyzed as a price floor for labor. A price floor, if above the equilibrium price and thus effective, necessarily leads to a surplus. This means the number of employees an employer is willing to hire at a living wage is below the number they would be willing to hire at the equilibrium wage price. Many argue that, in the context of a labor market, this would reduce the macroeconomic aggregate demand for labor across all employers, and so presume setting the minimum wage at a living wage would possibly raise unemployment.

The Rehn-Meidner model proposed a higher minimum wage would induce productivity growth from structural change, reorganizing workers into different jobs across employers with different microeconomic labor demands, rather than reducing aggregate demand for labor. A large amount of empirical study has focused on the employment effects of minimum wage, much of it following a study by David Card and Alan Krueger finding no difference in unemployment rates in two states following a minimum wage increase in one. A contention that often impedes the progression of a living wage ordinance has to do with the scope; it is controversial whether it should apply to an individual or an entire family as wages can be nuanced when there are multiple types of households among a state. Potential solutions to the complexity of a living wage ordinance include a &quot;specific employer provision&quot;, which seeks to evaluate the pros and cons to a living wage on a company to company basis. An argument In favor of this approach asserts that it can help bolster employee morale and increase social capital.

Critics have warned of not just an increase in unemployment but also price increases and a lack of entry-level jobs due to labor substitutions effects. The voluntary undertaking of a living wage is criticized as impossible due to the competitive advantage other businesses in the same market would have over the one adopting a living wage. The economic argument would be that, ceteris paribus (all other things being equal), a company that paid its workers more than required by the market would be unable to compete with those that pay according to market rates. The concept of a living wage based on its definition as a family wage has been criticized by some for emphasizing the role of men as breadwinners.

Another issue that has emerged is that living wages may be a less effective anti-poverty tool than other measures. Authors point to living wages as being only a limited way of addressing the problems of rising economic inequality, the increase of long-term low-wage jobs, and a decline of unions and legal protection for workers. Since living wage ordinances attempt to address the issue of a living wage, defined by some of its proponents as a &quot;family&quot; wage, rather than as an &quot;individual&quot; wage, many of the beneficiaries may already be in families that make substantially more than that necessary to provide an adequate standard of living; this argument focuses on the portion benefitting who are in poverty, rather than the portion in poverty who are benefitting. According to a survey of labor economists by the Employment Policies Institute in 2000, only 31% viewed living wages as a very or somewhat effective anti-poverty tool, while 98% viewed policies like the US earned income tax credit and general welfare grants in a similar vein. On the other hand, according to Zagros Madjd-Sadjadi, an economist with the State of California&#x27;s Division of Labor Statistics and Research, the living wage may be seen by the public as preferable to other methods because it reinforces the work ethic and ensures that there is something of value produced, unlike welfare, that is often believed to be a pure cash &quot;gift&quot; from the public coffers.

<text>WTVT (channel 13) is a television station licensed to Tampa, Florida, United States, serving as the Fox network outlet for the Tampa Bay area. Owned and operated by the network&#x27;s Fox Television Stations division, WTVT maintains studios on Kennedy Boulevard on Tampa&#x27;s west side, and its transmitter is located in Riverview.

==History==
===CBS affiliation===
The station first signed on the air on April 1, 1955, becoming the third television station in Tampa Bay (after WSUN-TV—channel 38, frequency now occupied by WTTA, and WFLA-TV, channel 8), it is also currently the second-oldest surviving station in the market behind WFLA. Upon its launch, WTVT took over the CBS affiliation from WSUN-TV. WTVT was originally owned by Tampa Bay radio veteran Walter Tison and his Tampa Television Company. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) originally awarded the construction permit to build a station on channel 13 to the now-defunct &quot;Tampa Times&quot; newspaper, which owned WDAE radio (then at 1250 AM, now at 620 AM). However, the FCC reversed its decision and awarded the license to the Tison group, which intended to open a studio facility in nearby St. Petersburg. The &quot;Times&quot; appealed the FCC&#x27;s decision, but lost. Although it appears that the station&#x27;s call letters stand for &quot;Television Tampa&quot;, they actually stand for the initials of Walter Tison and his wife, Virginia. Like many other stations located on &quot;unlucky&quot; channel 13, WTVT used a black cat as its mascot for several years.

In 1956, the Tampa Television Company merged with the Oklahoma City-based Oklahoma Publishing Company. OPUBCO&#x27;s broadcasting subsidiary, the WKY Radiophone Company, would later be known as Gaylord Broadcasting, named for the family that owned the company (Gaylord also owned what is present-day CBS O&amp;O KTVT in Fort Worth, but the &quot;TVT&quot; base callsign was only a coincidence).

The station&#x27;s remote broadcast facilities were chosen for network pool coverage of Alan Shepard and John Glenn&#x27;s Mercury capsule splashdowns (in 1961 and 1962, respectively). The mobile unit recorded the recoveries on videotapes that were flown to the mainland.

Through its CBS affiliation, WTVT carried Super Bowl XVIII, which was hosted at Tampa Stadium, in 1984.

In 1987, Gaylord sold the station to Gillett Communications (which made it a sister station of those Gillett acquired from KKR, most of which were stations owned by Storer Broadcasting). Gillett underwent a corporate restructuring in the early 1990s, changing its name to GCI Broadcast Services, Inc. In 1993, GCI filed for bankruptcy, and its stations (including WTVT) were sold to New World Communications. By that time, WTVT was preempting &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; for a locally produced morning newscast, as well as preempting all but one hour of the network&#x27;s Saturday morning cartoons and aired the weeknight edition of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; on a half-hour tape delay at 7 p.m. WTVT did not carry the CBS daytime dramas &quot;Capitol&quot; or &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; and instead aired &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; at 1 p.m. on a half-hour delay. This was due to the popularity of its one-hour midday newscast that dates back to the 1970s.

===As a Fox station===

On December 18, 1993, Fox outbid CBS for the rights to the NFL&#x27;s National Football Conference television package beginning with the league&#x27;s 1994 season. Most of Fox&#x27;s affiliates at the time were on the UHF band; seeking to affiliate with VHF stations to complement the new rights, Fox signed a long-term deal with New World Communications on May 23, 1994, to affiliate with twelve of the company&#x27;s major network affiliates, effective that fall.

WTVT affiliated with Fox on December 12, 1994, ending its 39-year affiliation with CBS. This resulted in a three-way affiliation swap that resulted in the market&#x27;s second Fox affiliate, WFTS-TV (channel 28), affiliating with ABC as part of a deal between the station&#x27;s owner, the E. W. Scripps Company and ABC that resulted in sister stations WMAR-TV in Baltimore and KNXV-TV in Phoenix joining the network; longtime ABC affiliate WTSP (channel 10), which was retained by Citicasters, became a CBS affiliate. The final CBS program to air on WTVT was the made-for-TV movie &quot;Reunion&quot;, which began at 9 p.m. Eastern Time on December 11, 1994. With the switch, WTVT became the third Tampa area station to have been affiliated with Fox. WTOG (channel 44) was the market&#x27;s original affiliate from the network&#x27;s launch in October 1986 until the affiliation moved to WFTS in 1988. The station chose not to renew the more expensive syndicated programs that it had run as a CBS affiliate, and instead began acquiring cheaper first-run syndicated talk and reality shows.

Albeit with a three-month interruption due to CBS losing the NFC rights (the games instead aired on WFTS for the first three months of Fox&#x27;s NFC telecasts as a lame duck affiliate), the switch allowed WTVT to retain its status as the &quot;home&quot; station for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers—a status it held since 1977, when the team moved to the NFC. Under the NFL&#x27;s contract with Fox (and before it, CBS), WTVT normally airs most of the Bucs&#x27; games, including all road games against American Football Conference opponents. However, largely due to the Bucs&#x27; lack of success on the field for most of their first 20 years, the team&#x27;s home games were almost always blacked out locally. This was especially true during the Bucs&#x27; darkest period in the 1980s and 1990s, when they had 12 consecutive 10-loss seasons; at one point, no Bucs home games were seen locally from 1982 to 1986—spanning portions of five seasons. Once the Buccaneers began to build a winning team in the late 1990s, along with a new look and the opening of Raymond James Stadium, local television blackouts decreased, thus allowing more games to be shown on WTVT. The blackout rules were lifted by the NFL in 2015 on an experimental basis, and have since been suspended indefinitely, meaning games are now shown on Channel 13 regardless of attendance. Through Fox&#x27;s contract with Major League Baseball, the station has also aired select Tampa Bay Rays games since the team&#x27;s inaugural season in 1998, including the team&#x27;s 2008 and 2020 World Series appearances.

News Corporation bought New World outright in July 1996; the purchase was finalized on January 22, 1997, making WTVT the first owned-and-operated station of a major network in the Tampa Bay area. Although New World no longer exists as a separate company, WTVT continues to use &quot;New World Communications of Tampa Bay&quot; as the copyright tag at the end of the station&#x27;s newscasts. Shortly after the purchase was announced, the station changed its branding from &quot;Channel 13&quot; to &quot;Fox 13&quot;—retaining the numerical &quot;13&quot; logo it had used since 1989 as a CBS affiliate (the font for that number has since been utilized by sister station WFLD in Chicago upon its rebranding in 2012, as well as the &quot;13&quot; itself used by former sister station WHBQ-TV in Memphis and PBS member station KERA-TV in Dallas). Under Fox ownership, the station added more higher-profile syndicated shows and a few off-network sitcoms to its lineup.

In June 2009, WTVT interviewed late television pitchman Billy Mays shortly before his death. His interview, which was conducted at the Tampa International Airport, is believed to have been his final appearance on live television.

On December 14, 2017, The Walt Disney Company, owner of WFTS-TV&#x27;s affiliated network ABC, announced its intent to buy WTVT&#x27;s parent company, 21st Century Fox, for $66.1 billion; the sale, which closed on March 20, 2019, excluded WTVT as well as the Fox network, the MyNetworkTV programming service, Fox News, Fox Sports 1 and the Fox Television Stations unit, which were all transferred to the newly-formed Fox Corporation.

==News operation==
WTVT presently broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 12 hours each weekday, hours on Saturdays and six hours on Sundays). In regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output of any television station in both the Tampa Bay market and the entire state of Florida.

Under Gaylord Broadcasting ownership, the company poured significant resources into channel 13&#x27;s news operation. In 1958, WTVT became the second station in the country to introduce daily editorials, and was also the first station in the country to run an hour-long news block, consisting of 45 minutes of local news (under the title &quot;Pulse&quot;) combined with the then-15-minute network newscast. By 1962, WTVT had overtaken WFLA-TV as the highest-rated station in the Tampa Bay market, retaining that position for over 25 years. This was largely because of the longevity of many of the station&#x27;s personalities. For instance, Roy Leep was the station&#x27;s weatherman from 1957 until his retirement on November 26, 1997, and Hugh Smith was the station&#x27;s main anchor from 1963 to 1991, spending most of that time doubling as its news director.

Channel 13 dropped the &quot;Pulse&quot; moniker from its newscasts in 1989 in favor of &quot;Eyewitness News&quot;. The &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; moniker was retained during the early years of the Fox era before being dropped in 1997.

After WTVT became a Fox affiliate in December 1994, the station adopted a news-intensive schedule, increasing its news programming output from about 30 hours a week to nearly 45 hours. Like most former Big Three affiliates that joined Fox during the 1990s, it maintained a news schedule similar to the one it had as a CBS affiliate. The station retained all of its existing newscasts. However, it expanded its weekday morning newscast from one to hours (with two hours added from 7 to 9 a.m. to make up for the loss of &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;), bridged the weeknight 5 and 6 p.m. newscasts into a two-hour early evening news block (by expanding its half-hour 6 p.m. newscast to one hour) and moved the 11 p.m. newscast to 10 p.m. and expanded it to a full hour (originally titled &quot;Channel 13 Eyewitness News Prime Time at Ten&quot;, later renamed as &quot;Fox 13 10:00 News&quot; upon Fox purchasing the station). on December 12, 2005, WTVT debuted a new 11 p.m. newscast called &quot;News Edge at 11:00&quot;, returning a newscast to that timeslot since the station was still affiliated with CBS. At one point, WTVT had the largest local newscast output of any television station in the country.

In April 2009, Fox entered into a Local News Service agreement with the E. W. Scripps Company in which Fox&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations in Tampa, Detroit and Phoenix would share news video and helicopter footage with Scripps-owned stations in those markets for use in their own reports. Locally, WTVT began pooling video with WFTS as part of the agreement; however the stations otherwise maintain separate news departments. Gannett-owned WTSP was added to the LNS agreement that June. Prior to the agreement, WTVT had been the only station in the Tampa market to use two news helicopters: a Bell 206 called &quot;SkyFox&quot; and a Robinson R44 called &quot;SkyFox 2&quot;, which was used whenever &quot;SkyFox&quot; was grounded due to mechanical reasons. When warranted, both helicopters were used to cover significant news stories. WTVT, WFTS and WTSP now utilize only one helicopter (WFTS&#x27; &quot;Action Air One&quot;) to cover news events (rival station WFLA covers news events by utilizing its own helicopter, &quot;Eagle 8&quot;).

In the summer of 2009, Fox Television Stations opened a graphics hub at the WTVT studios to distribute graphics for Fox&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations.

Starting with the 5 p.m. newscast on June 30, 2009, WTVT became the fourth and final station in the Tampa Bay market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition.

===Monsanto controversy===

In 1997, Steve Wilson and Jane Akre began work on a story regarding the agricultural biotechnology company Monsanto and recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH), a milk additive that had been approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration but also blamed for a number of health issues. Wilson and Akre planned a four-part investigative report on Monsanto&#x27;s use of rBGH, which prompted the company to write to Fox News Channel president Roger Ailes in an attempt to have the report reviewed for bias and because of the &quot;enormous damage that can be done&quot; as a result of the report.

WTVT did not run the story, and later argued in court that the report was not &quot;breakthrough journalism&quot;. Wilson and Akre then claimed that the station&#x27;s actions constituted the news broadcast telling lies, while WTVT countered looking only for fairness, and wanted to air a hard-hitting story with a number of statements critical of Monsanto. Wilson and Akre stated that they rewrote the report over 80 times over the course of 1997, and WTVT decided to exercise &quot;its option to terminate their employment contracts without cause&quot;, and did not renew their contracts in 1998. WTVT later ran a report about Monsanto and rBGH in 1998, and the report included defenses from Monsanto.

After Wilson and Akre&#x27;s contracts were not renewed, they filed a lawsuit concerning WTVT&#x27;s &quot;news distortion&quot; under Florida&#x27;s whistleblower laws, claiming their termination was retaliation for &quot;resisting WTVT&#x27;s attempts to distort or suppress the BGH story&quot;. In a joint statement, Wilson claimed that he and Akre &quot;were repeatedly ordered to go forward and broadcast demonstrably inaccurate and dishonest versions of the story&quot;, and &quot;were given those instructions after some very high-level corporate lobbying by Monsanto (the powerful drug company that makes the hormone) and also ... by members of Florida&#x27;s dairy and grocery industries&quot;. The trial commenced in the summer of 2000 with a jury dismissing all of the claims brought to trial by Wilson, but siding with one aspect of Akre&#x27;s complaint, awarding her $425,000 and agreeing that Akre was a whistleblower because she believed there were violations of the Communications Act of 1934 and because she planned on reporting the station to the Federal Communications Commission. &quot;Reason&quot; magazine, referring to the case, noted that Akre&#x27;s argument in the trial was that Akre and Wilson believed news distortion occurred, but that they did not have to prove this was the case.

An appeal was filed, and a ruling in February 2003 came down in favor of WTVT, who successfully argued that the FCC policy against falsification was not a &quot;law, rule, or regulation&quot;, and so the whistle-blower law did not qualify as the required &quot;law, rule, or regulation&quot; under section 448.102... Because the FCC&#x27;s news distortion policy is not a &quot;law, rule, or regulation&quot; under section 448.102, Akre has failed to state a claim under the whistle-blower&#x27;s statute.&quot; The appeal did not address any falsification claims, noting that &quot;as a threshold matter... Akre failed to state a claim under the whistle-blower&#x27;s statute&quot;, but noted that the lower court ruled against all of Wilson&#x27;s charges and all of Akre&#x27;s claims with the exception of the whistleblower claim that was overturned.

<text>H&amp;R Block, Inc., or H&amp;R Block, is an American tax preparation company operating in Canada, the United States, and Australia. The company was founded in 1955 in Kansas City, Missouri, by brothers Henry W. Bloch and Richard Bloch.

As of 2018, H&amp;R Block operates approximately 12,000 retail tax offices staffed by tax professionals worldwide. The company offers payroll, and business consulting services, consumer tax software, and online tax preparation/electronic filing from their website.

==History==
===Founding===
During World War II, Henry W. Bloch was a young Army Air Forces navigator who wanted to start a family business with his brothers in Kansas City. Home from the war in 1946, Henry saw a pamphlet suggesting a bright future for companies serving small businesses, and it sparked his imagination. That year, Henry and his older brother, Leon, borrowed $5,000 and opened a small bookkeeping business on Main Street in downtown Kansas City. However, four months later, they had few clients and Leon decided to seek a law degree.

Henry wanted to keep trying with the fledgling business and placed a newspaper advertisement for help-wanted. He got an unexpected response—from his mother—who proposed that Henry hire his younger brother, Richard, for the job. Henry and Richard Bloch jointly ran their United Business Company, which focused on accounting, bookkeeping and payroll, but also did some income tax work for clients. The brothers took out an ad for its $5 tax services in &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; newspaper in 1955. The ad was a success and H&amp;R Block was born. The Bloch brothers chose to spell the name &quot;Block&quot; with a K to ensure the name is not mispronounced &quot;blotch&quot;.

===Expansion (1956–1980s)===
In 1956, the Blochs decided to expand and picked New York City. Neither brother wanted to move to New York, so they agreed to sell that regional operation, creating the first H&amp;R Block franchise tax office. In the following years, H&amp;R Block grew and went public in 1962.

In 1980 H&amp;R Block purchased the Compuserve online service. By 1986, Block was handling more than 10 million tax returns annually and had opened offices in Canada and Australia. That year, the company worked with the Internal Revenue Service to introduce electronic filing.

===Recent history===
H&amp;R Block acquired MECA Software, a 1980s PFM company that created the TaxCut software, in 1993. In 1995, H&amp;R Block sold MECA, but retained TaxCut.

The company began to expand in the 1990s into the financial services arena, offering mortgage loans, banking and business services. H&amp;R Block purchased Olde Discount Stockbrokers in 1999 and operated as a full-service securities broker-dealer under the name H&amp;R Block Financial Advisors. In 2008, the company sold its H&amp;R Block Financial Advisors unit to Ameriprise Financial for $315 million. At the time, the unit managed $30 billion in assets and employed 900 financial advisors in the U.S.

RSM McGladrey Business Solutions was created in 1999 when H&amp;R Block acquired the assets of McGladrey &amp; Pullen, aside from its auditors and attest services which remained under ownership of McGladrey&#x27;s partners. Following the acquisition H&amp;R Block became the sixth-largest accounting firm in the U.S. McGladrey had 100 offices in 25 states and offered accounting, consulting, tax services, and international business services to mid-sized companies. Through an alliance with McGladrey &amp; Pullen and other accountancies, the Block subsidiary operated in 70 countries under the RSM International name. In 2011, H&amp;R Block sold the unit back to McGladrey &amp; Pullen.

H&amp;R Block hired Jeff Jones, a former Target Corporation and Uber executive, as president and CEO on October 9, 2017. He replaced Tom Gerke, who was interim CEO following the retirement of former CEO Bill Cobb. Jones has said he sees H&amp;R Block as a financial services company and a retail company, and aims to grow the company.

H&amp;R Block started its first Global Technology Center in India in October 2017. This was created with the vision to grow H&amp;R Block&#x27;s Product Engineering and IT Solutions Development platforms. It is located in Technopark, Trivandrum, Kerala.

H&amp;R Block announced in June 2019 that it would acquire Wave Financial, a Canadian financial technology company offering bookkeeping, accounting, and payroll services for small businesses. H&amp;R Block acquired Wave for US$405 million (C$537 million). Wave operates as an independent subsidiary by Wave CEO Zahir Khoja from Toronto, Ontario.

=== Controversies ===
==== H&amp;R Block&#x27;s own taxes 2005 ====
In August 2005, H&amp;R Block announced that it had overstated its earnings for 2003 and 2004 by $91.1 million. The company stated that it had &quot;insufficient resources&quot; to identify and report complex transactions in its corporate tax accounting. On February 23, 2006, the company said in its quarterly results that it had miscalculated its own state income taxes for 2005 and 2004, and that it owed an additional $32 million in back taxes.

==== Social Security numbers 2005 ====
In December 2005, H&amp;R Block sent its customers free copies of its TaxCut software, and the mailing labels on the packages mistakenly included the recipients&#x27; Social Security numbers. The company said it sent the promotional mailing to former customers and people whose names were taken from purchased lists. It said it is legally required to hold on to customers&#x27; tax information, including Social Security numbers, for three years. H&amp;R Block said no customer data has been lost or stolen as a result of the mistake, and that less than 3 percent of the mailings were involved.

==== Refund anticipation loans 2006 ====
California Attorney General Bill Lockyer sued H&amp;R Block in February 2006, alleging the company&#x27;s refund anticipation loan (RAL) business violated state and federal laws in its marketing and providing of high-cost RALs mainly to low-income clients. The lawsuit also alleged Block received a &quot;substantial portion of the loan fees&quot;, in some cases purchasing up to 49.9 percent of the loans, and further alleged that H&amp;R Block at times held onto a customer&#x27;s tax refund for purposes of paying off RAL-related debt from previous years, including that claimed by other banks or tax preparers. The complaint stated, &quot;Therefore, Block clients who are claimed to owe debt from a prior year are led to expect a loan, but instead find themselves in a collection proceeding.&quot;

The company responded that it &quot;believes the refund lending program is both fair and legal, and will vigorously defend against the complaint&quot;. On January 2, 2009, California Attorney General Edmund G. Brown Jr. reached a $4.85 million settlement with H&amp;R Block, which prohibits the company from deceptively marketing high-cost refund anticipation loans as early &quot;tax refunds&quot;. The company set aside $2.45 million in restitution for customers if they purchased a &quot;refund anticipation loan&quot; or a &quot;refund anticipation check&quot; through H&amp;R Block between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2008. In addition, H&amp;R Block agreed to pay $500,000 in penalties and $1.9 million in fees and costs. In 2011, H&amp;R Block ceased offering RALs altogether, a move praised by consumer rights activists.

==== Express IRA 2006 ====
On March 16, 2006, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer sued H&amp;R Block, accusing the company of deceptive marketing of its Express IRA retirement accounts. The lawsuit alleged the company assessed fees, including set-up fees, annual fees, and account closing fees that, for 85% of account holders, resulted in the account losing money. However, in July 2007, a New York state judge dismissed much of the lawsuit. Justice Karla Moskowitz of the State Supreme Court excused Block and five of its units from the lawsuit. She let stand the portion of the complaint concerning another unit, H&amp;R Block Financial Advisers, but dismissed allegations of common law fraud. At the time of the ruling, H&amp;R Block said it believed the remaining assertions lacked merit and that it would appeal. On January 6, 2009, a New York state appeals court overruled trial justice Karla Moskowitz&#x27;s July 2007 ruling and reinstated the lawsuit against H&amp;R Block Inc that accused the company of fraudulently marketing Express IRA retirement accounts to hundreds of thousands of lower-income clients nationwide. The matter was settled in 2009, and H&amp;R Block agreed to pay $11.4 million to $19.4 million of fees to customers and $750,000 in fees and other costs.

==Corporate affairs==

H&amp;R Block is a company headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, governed by an 11-member board of directors and led by CEO Jeff Jones and CFO Tony Bowen.

The company&#x27;s services Tax Pro Review and Tax Pro Go were launched in 2017. Tax Pro Review is an updated version of its former service Best of Both, where clients enter their information and do their returns online and are matched with Block tax professional reviews for help. H&amp;R Block Tax Pro Go is marketed to online filers who do not want to or cannot visit an H&amp;R Block office.

H&amp;R Block has 11,000 branded locations nationwide, and will recommend Xero in the locations that sell H&amp;R Block&#x27;s Small Business Program suite of services.

The company signed a deal with Walmart in 2018, to make H&amp;R Block software the only desktop tax preparation software sold at the retailer&#x27;s stores. H&amp;R Block also created a deal with Amazon.com in 2017 for better product placement of its suite of software products.

<doc id="572862" wikidata="Q156386" url="?curid=572862" title="Henri Rousseau">
<text>Henri Julien Félix Rousseau (; 21 May 1844 – 2 September 1910) was a French post-impressionist painter in the Naïve or Primitive manner. He was also known as Le Douanier (the customs officer), a humorous description of his occupation as a toll and tax collector. He started painting seriously in his early forties; by age 49, he retired from his job to work on his art full-time.

Ridiculed during his lifetime by critics, he came to be recognized as a self-taught genius whose works are of high artistic quality. Rousseau&#x27;s work exerted an extensive influence on several generations of avant-garde artists.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Rousseau was born in Laval, Mayenne, France, in 1844 into the family of a tinsmith; he was forced to work there as a young child. He attended Laval High School as a day student, and then as a boarder after his father became a debtor and his parents had to leave the town upon the seizure of their house. Though mediocre in some of his high school subjects, Rousseau won prizes for drawing and music.

After high school, he worked for a lawyer and studied law, but &quot;attempted a small perjury and sought refuge in the army.&quot; He served four years, starting in 1863. With his father&#x27;s death, Rousseau moved to Paris in 1868 to support his widowed mother as a government employee.

In 1868, he married Clémence Boitard, his landlord&#x27;s 15-year-old daughter, with whom he had six children (only one survived). In 1871, he was appointed as a collector of the octroi of Paris, collecting taxes on goods entering Paris. His wife died in 1888 and he married Josephine Noury in 1898.

===Career===
From 1886, he exhibited regularly in the Salon des Indépendants, and, although his work was not placed prominently, it drew an increasing following over the years. &quot;Tiger in a Tropical Storm (Surprised!)&quot; was exhibited in 1891, and Rousseau received his first serious review when the young artist Félix Vallotton wrote: &quot;His tiger surprising its prey ought not to be missed; it&#x27;s the alpha and omega of painting.&quot; Yet it was more than a decade before Rousseau returned to depicting his vision of jungles.

In 1893, Rousseau moved to a studio in Montparnasse where he lived and worked until his death in 1910. In 1897, he produced one of his most famous paintings, &quot;La Bohémienne endormie&quot; (&quot;The Sleeping Gypsy&quot;).

In 1905, Rousseau&#x27;s large jungle scene &quot;The Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope&quot; was exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants near works by younger leading avant-garde artists such as Henri Matisse, in what is now seen as the first showing of The Fauves. Rousseau&#x27;s painting may even have influenced the naming of the Fauves.

In 1907, he was commissioned by artist Robert Delaunay&#x27;s mother, Berthe, Comtesse de Delaunay, to paint &quot;The Snake Charmer&quot;.

===Le Banquet Rousseau===
When Pablo Picasso happened upon a painting by Rousseau being sold on the street as a canvas to be painted over, the younger artist instantly recognised Rousseau&#x27;s genius and went to meet him. In 1908, Picasso held a half serious, half burlesque banquet in his studio at Le Bateau-Lavoir in Rousseau&#x27;s honour. &quot;Le Banquet Rousseau&quot;, &quot;one of the most notable social events of the twentieth century,&quot; wrote American poet and literary critic John Malcolm Brinnin, &quot;was neither an orgiastic occasion nor even an opulent one. Its subsequent fame grew from the fact that it was a colorful happening within a revolutionary art movement at a point of that movement&#x27;s earliest success, and from the fact that it was attended by individuals whose separate influences radiated like spokes of creative light across the art world for generations.&quot;

Guests at the &quot;banquet Rousseau&quot; included: Guillaume Apollinaire, Jean Metzinger, Juan Gris, Max Jacob, Marie Laurencin, André Salmon, Maurice Raynal, Daniel-Henri Kahnweiler, Leo Stein, and Gertrude Stein.

Maurice Raynal, in &quot;Les Soirées de Paris&quot;, 15 January 1914, p. 69, wrote about &quot;Le Banquet Rousseau&quot;. Years later the French writer André Salmon recalled the setting of the illustrious banquet:

===Retirement and death===
After Rousseau&#x27;s retirement in 1893, he supplemented his small pension with part-time jobs and work such as playing a violin in the streets. He also worked briefly at &quot;Le petit Journal&quot;, where he produced a number of its covers.

An equally famous work by Rousseau, included in the collection of John Hay Whitney, is &quot;Tropical Forest with Monkeys&quot;, which was painted during the last months of his life. It shows one of his signature exotic landscapes, lush, tropical, and virgin. Many of the animals in Rousseau&#x27;s images have human faces or attributes. The central monkeys in this painting hold green sticks from which strings appear to dangle, suggesting fishing poles and human leisure activities, thereby emphasizing the quasi-human experience of the animals. In this sense Rousseau&#x27;s anthropomorphized primates can be seen not as true wild beasts, but rather as representing an escape from the &quot;jungle&quot; of Paris and the everyday grind of civilized life.

Rousseau exhibited his final painting, &quot;The Dream&quot;, in March 1910, at the Salon des Independants.

In the same month Rousseau suffered a phlegmon in his leg, one which he ignored. In August, when he was admitted to the Necker Hospital in Paris where his son had died, he was found to have gangrene in his leg. After an operation, he died from a blood clot on 2 September 1910.

At his funeral, seven friends stood at his grave: the painters Paul Signac and Manuel Ortiz de Zárate; the artist couple Robert Delaunay and Sonia Terk; the sculptor Constantin Brâncuși; Rousseau&#x27;s landlord Armand Queval, and Guillaume Apollinaire, who wrote the epitaph Brâncuși put on the tombstone:

&lt;poem&gt;
We salute you Gentle Rousseau you can hear us.
Delaunay, his wife, Monsieur Queval and myself.
Let our luggage pass duty free through the gates of heaven.
We will bring you brushes, paints and canvas.
That you may spend your sacred leisure in the
light and Truth of Painting.
As you once did my portrait facing the stars, lion and the gypsy.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Artistry==
===Paintings===
Rousseau claimed he had &quot;no teacher other than nature&quot;, although he admitted he had received &quot;some advice&quot; from two established Academic painters, Félix Auguste Clément and Jean-Léon Gérôme. Essentially, he was self-taught and is considered to be a naïve or primitive painter.

His best-known paintings depict jungle scenes, even though he never left France or saw a jungle. Stories spread by admirers that his army service included the French expeditionary force to Mexico are unfounded. His inspiration came from illustrations in children&#x27;s books and the botanical gardens in Paris, as well as tableaux of taxidermy wild animals. During his term of service, he had also met soldiers who had survived the French expedition to Mexico, and he listened to their stories of the subtropical country they had encountered. To the critic Arsène Alexandre, he described his frequent visits to the Jardin des Plantes: &quot;When I go into the glass houses and I see the strange plants of exotic lands, it seems to me that I enter into a dream.&quot;

Along with his exotic scenes there was a concurrent output of smaller topographical images of the city and its suburbs.

He claimed to have invented a new genre of &quot;portrait landscape&quot;, which he achieved by starting a painting with a specific view, such as a favourite part of the city, and then depicting a person in the foreground, most notably his early &quot;Myself, Portrait-Landscape&quot; (1890).

===Criticism and recognition===
Rousseau&#x27;s flat, seemingly childish style was disparaged by many critics; people often were shocked by his work or ridiculed it. His ingenuousness was extreme, and he always aspired, in vain, to conventional acceptance. Many observers commented that he painted like a child, but the work shows sophistication with his particular technique.

==Legacy==

Rousseau&#x27;s work exerted an extensive influence on several generations of avant-garde artists, including Pablo Picasso, Jean Hugo, Fernand Léger Jean Metzinger, Max Beckmann, and the Surrealists. According to Roberta Smith, an art critic writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Beckmann’s amazing self-portraits, for example, descend from the brusque, concentrated forms of Rousseau’s portrait of the writer Pierre Loti.&quot;

In 1911, a retrospective exhibition of Rousseau&#x27;s works was shown at the Salon des Indépendants. His paintings were also shown at the first Blaue Reiter exhibition.

Critics have noted the influence of Rousseau on Wallace Stevens&#x27;s poetry. See, for instance, Stevens&#x27;s &quot;Floral Decorations for Bananas&quot; in the collection &quot;Harmonium&quot;.

The American poet Sylvia Plath was a great admirer of Rousseau, referencing his art, as well as drawing inspiration from his works in her poetry. The poem, &quot;Yadwigha, on a Red Couch, Among Lilies&quot; (1958), is based upon his painting, &quot;The Dream&quot;, whilst the poem &quot;Snakecharmer&quot; (1957) is based upon his painting &quot;The Snake Charmer&quot;.

The song &quot;The Jungle Line&quot;, by Joni Mitchell, is based upon a Rousseau painting.

Underground comic artist Bill Griffith drew a four-page biographical sketch of Rousseau, &quot;A Couch in the Sun&quot;, which was included in issue #2 of the &quot;Arcade&quot; anthology.

The visual style of Michel Ocelot&#x27;s 1998 animation film, &quot;Kirikou and the Sorceress&quot;, is partly inspired by Rousseau, particularly the depiction of the jungle vegetation.

A Rousseau painting was used as an inspiration for the 2005 animated film &quot;Madagascar&quot;.

Rousseau&#x27;s 1908 painting &quot;Fight Between a Tiger and a Buffalo&quot; was used as the inspiration for a series of 2021 advertisements concerning the rebrand of Facebook into the metaverse company Meta.

==Exhibitions==

Two major museum exhibitions of his work were held in 1984–85 (in Paris, at the Grand Palais; and in New York, at the Museum of Modern Art) and in 2001 (Tübingen, Germany). &quot;These efforts countered the persona of the humble, oblivious naïf by detailing his assured single-mindedness and tracked the extensive influence his work exerted on several generations of vanguard artists,&quot; critic Roberta Smith wrote in a review of a later exhibition.

A major exhibition of his work, &quot;Henri Rousseau: Jungles in Paris&quot;, was shown at the Tate Modern from 3 November 2005 to 5 February 2006, organised by the Tate and the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, where the show also appeared. The exhibition, encompassing 48 of his paintings, was on display at the National Gallery of Art in Washington from 16 July to 15 October 2006 and at the Grand Palais in Paris from 15 March to 19 June 2006.

<doc id="572863" wikidata="Q1696613" url="?curid=572863" title="Spirit of Eden">
<text>Spirit of Eden is the fourth studio album by English band Talk Talk, released in 1988 on Parlophone Records. It was compiled from a lengthy recording process at London&#x27;s Wessex Studios between 1987 and 1988, with songs written by singer Mark Hollis and producer Tim Friese-Greene. Often working in darkness, the band recorded many hours of improvised performances that drew on elements of jazz, ambient, classical music, blues, and dub. These long-form recordings were then heavily edited and re-arranged into an album in mostly digital format. The results were a radical departure from Talk Talk&#x27;s earlier synth-pop recordings, and would later be credited with pioneering the post-rock genre.

Compared to the success of 1986&#x27;s &quot;The Colour of Spring&quot;, &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; was a commercial disappointment. Despite its mixed reception, the album&#x27;s stature grew more favourable in subsequent years, with contemporary critics describing &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; as an underrated masterpiece. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; at number 95 in its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Background==
Talk Talk, led by singer Mark Hollis, formed in England in the early 1980s. From the start, Hollis cited jazz and impressionist artists like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Béla Bartók and Claude Debussy as major influences, but the first two Talk Talk albums, &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over&quot; (1982) and &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; (1984), did not readily reflect such influences; critics compared the band to contemporary new wave groups, especially Duran Duran. Hollis partly attributed the shortcomings of their early music to a financial need to use synthesizers in place of acoustic instruments.

Although critics did not favour the band&#x27;s early output, the first two albums were commercially successful in Europe. This gave Talk Talk the money needed to hire additional musicians to play on their next album, &quot;The Colour of Spring&quot; (1986). The band no longer had to rely on synthesizers. Instead, musicians improvised with their instruments for many hours, then Hollis and producer Tim Friese-Greene edited and arranged the performances to get the sound they wanted. A total of sixteen musicians appeared on the album around the core of Hollis and Friese-Greene. &quot;The Colour of Spring&quot; became Talk Talk&#x27;s most successful album, selling over two million copies and prompting a major world tour. At the same time, minimalist songs like &quot;April 5th,&quot; &quot;Chameleon Day,&quot; and the B-side &quot;It&#x27;s Getting Late in the Evening&quot; pointed towards the band&#x27;s next direction.

==Music==
===Recording===
Following the commercial success of &quot;The Colour of Spring&quot;, EMI gave Talk Talk an open budget for the recording of their next album, &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot;. Talk Talk were given complete control over the recording process; their manager and EMI executives were barred from studio sessions. Recording for &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; began in 1987 at Wessex Studios, London and took about a year to complete.

The sessions took place in a blacked-out studio, with an oil projector and strobe lighting. Engineer Phill Brown said that the album, along with its successor, was &quot;recorded by chance, accident, and hours of trying every possible overdub idea.&quot; According to Brown, &quot;twelve hours a day in the dark listening to the same six songs for eight months became pretty intense. There was very little communication with musicians who came in to play. They were led to a studio in darkness and a track would be played down the headphones.&quot;

===Style===
Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Graeme Thomson described &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; as &quot;six improvised pieces full of space and unhurried rhythm,&quot; which blend together &quot;pastoral jazz, contemporary classical, folk, prog rock and loose blues into a single, doggedly uncommercial musical tapestry&quot; which would be labeled &quot;post-rock.&quot; Simon Harper of the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot; observed the album&#x27;s &quot;combination of jazz, classical, rock and the spacey echoes of dub, using silence almost as an instrument in its own right.&quot; Although the album is noted for its tranquil soundscapes, Graham Sutton of Bark Psychosis notes &quot;Noise is important. I could never understand people I knew who liked Talk Talk and saw it as something &#x27;nice to chill out to&#x27; when I loved the overwhelming intensity and the dynamics.&quot;

Mark Hollis&#x27; lyrics reflect his religious and spiritual outlook. Though he acknowledges that his lyrics are religious, he says they are not based on a specific creed, preferring to think of them as &quot;humanitarian.&quot; &quot;I Believe in You&quot; has been described as an &quot;anti-heroin song.&quot; When asked whether the lyrics are based on personal experience, Hollis replied, &quot;No, not at all. But, you know, I met people who got totally fucked up on it. Within rock music there&#x27;s so much fucking glorification of it, and it is a wicked, horrible thing.&quot;

==Contract dispute with EMI==
By early March 1988, the band had finished recording &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; and had sent a cassette of the album to EMI. After listening to the cassette, EMI representatives doubted that it could be commercially successful. They asked Hollis to re-record a song or replace material, but he refused to do so. By the time the masters were delivered later in the month, however, the label conceded that the album had been satisfactorily completed.

Despite their reservations towards &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot;, EMI chose to exercise their option to extend the recording contract. The band, however, wanted out of the contract. &quot;I knew by that time that EMI was not the company this band should be with,&quot; manager Keith Aspden told &quot;Mojo&quot;. &quot;I was fearful that the money wouldn&#x27;t be there to record another album.&quot; EMI and Talk Talk went to court to decide the issue.

The case centred on whether EMI had notified the band in time about the contract extension. As part of the agreement, EMI had to send a written notice within three months after the completion of &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot;. The band said that EMI had sent the notice too late, arguing that the three-month period began once recording had finished; EMI argued that the three-month period did not begin until they were satisfied with the recording, on the basis that the definition of an &quot;album&quot; in the contract provided that the album had to be &quot;commercially satisfactory&quot;. The band disputed this, particularly on the basis that there were no changes made to the album in the space between its recording and eventual release. Justice Andrew Morritt ruled in favour of EMI, but his decision was overturned in the Court of Appeal. Talk Talk were released from the contract and later signed to Polydor.

==Marketing and release==
&quot;Spirit of Eden&quot;&#x27;s moody, experimental nature made it a challenge to promote; one critic said it &quot;is the kind of record which encourages marketing men to commit suicide.&quot; Tony Wadsworth, Parlophone&#x27;s marketing director at the time, told &quot;Q&quot;: &quot;Talk Talk are not your ordinary combo and require sympathetic marketing. They&#x27;re not so much difficult as not obvious. You&#x27;ve just got to find as many ways as possible to expose the music.&quot; Evaluating some masterpieces of the eighties in a 2004 article for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, John Robinson calls &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot;, like David Sylvian&#x27;s &quot;Brilliant Trees&quot;, &quot;triumphant, [but] completely unmarketable.&quot;

Although the band did not originally plan to release a single, EMI issued a radio edit of &quot;I Believe in You&quot; in September 1988 (the previously unreleased &quot;John Cope&quot; was included as the B-side). The single failed to breach the UK singles chart Top 75. Around August, Tim Pope directed a music video for &quot;I Believe in You&quot;, featuring Hollis sitting with his guitar, singing the lyrics. &quot;That was a massive mistake,&quot; said Hollis. &quot;I thought just by sitting there and listening and really thinking about what it was about, I could get that in my eyes. But you cannot do it. It just feels stupid.&quot;

The band did not tour in support of the album. Hollis explained, &quot;There is no way that I could ever play again a lot of the stuff I played on this album because I just wouldn&#x27;t know how to. So, to play it live, to take a part that was done in spontaneity, to write it down and then get someone to play it, would lose the whole point, lose the whole purity of what it was in the first place.&quot; The band would never tour again.

&quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; was released worldwide in 1988. It did not enjoy nearly as much commercial success as &quot;The Colour of Spring&quot;. The album spent five weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number 19. The album cover depicts a tree festooned with seashells, snails, birds, and insects. It was illustrated by James Marsh, who did Talk Talk&#x27;s artwork throughout their recording career. The booklet provides reproductions of Hollis&#x27; handwritten lyrics. The album was digitally remastered by Phill Brown and Denis Blackham in 1997.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; has been both acclaimed and panned by numerous music critics. Among contemporary reviews of &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot;, &quot;Record Mirror&quot;″s Betty Page commented that Talk Talk had become &quot;a law unto themselves, unconstrained by narrow ideas of &#x27;what will sell&#x27;&quot;, while &quot;Q&quot;″s Mark Cooper likened the album to &quot;the pastoral epics of the early 70s&quot; and noted &quot;a range, ambition and self-sufficiency that enables Hollis and co to step out of time and into their own.&quot; &quot;No hit singles then&quot;, the latter wrote, &quot;but a brave record that is not afraid to follow its own muse and damn the consequences.&quot; In &quot;Sounds&quot;, Roy Wilkinson said that Talk Talk had &quot;evolved into contemplative muso-techs&quot;, and while finding their lyrics occasionally awkward and the album&#x27;s second half not at the level of the first&#x27;s &quot;magnificence&quot;, he deemed &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; as a whole &quot;uncommonly beautiful.&quot; Simon Williams began his review for &quot;NME&quot; with a joking dismissal of the album as an exercise in &quot;conceptualism&quot;, before going on to describe the band as &quot;resolute and determined&quot; in their flouting of &quot;commercial rules with fascinating disregard for understanding or acceptance.&quot;

In the 1992 &quot;Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, J. D. Considine rated &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; one star out of five: &quot;Instead of getting better or worse, this band simply grew more pretentious with each passing year ... by &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot;, Mark Hollis&#x27;s Pete Townshend-on-Dramamine vocals have been pushed aside by the band&#x27;s pointless noodling.&quot; Marcus Berkmann of &quot;The Spectator&quot; in a 2001 retrospective felt that the album was &quot;almost wilfully obscure&quot;, with a musical style close to free-form jazz that was too far removed from &quot;The Colour of Spring&quot; for fans to enjoy.

&quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; has received more unanimous acclaim in the decades following its release. AllMusic reviewer Jason Ankeny considered the album, in its eschewing of &quot;electronics for live, organic sounds&quot; and of &quot;structure in favor of mood and atmosphere&quot;, an &quot;unprecedented breakthrough&quot;. &quot;Mojo&quot;″s Danny Eccleston wrote in 2012 that &quot;there will never be another album like it, since the demise of the profligate old-school record industry means that no one will ever spend so much money making anything so left-field again.&quot; In a 2019 review, Jeremy D. Larson of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; lauded the record as a masterful achievement in contemporary music, stating that &quot;&quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; was the great inhale of religious feeling, one rock and pop music had been expelling for years and years. The thrill and stasis of a held breath carry the album from beginning to end.&quot;

==Legacy==
Some music critics consider &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; and its 1991 follow-up &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; influential to the post-rock genre, which developed in Britain and North America in the 1990s. In a review of Bark Psychosis&#x27; album &quot;Hex&quot;, where the term &quot;post-rock&quot; was coined, Simon Reynolds opined that &quot;Hex&quot; aspires to the &quot;baroque grandeur&quot; of &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot;. Andy Whitman of &quot;Paste&quot; magazine argued that &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; represents the beginning of post-rock: &quot;The telltale marks of the genre—textured guitars, glacial tempos, an emphasis on dynamics, electronica, ambience and minimalism—were all in place, and paved the way for bands like Sigur Rós, Mogwai, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Low and latter-period Radiohead.&quot; In the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot;, Simon Harper held that &quot;there can be little argument that Tortoise and their Chicago-based compatriots would hardly sound the same were it not for the staggering achievements of Hollis and Tim Friese-Greene&quot;. Numerous bands and artists, including Graham Coxon, Doves, Elbow and Bedhead, have praised &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; or have cited it as an influence.

In 2008 Alan McGee wrote: &quot;&quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; has not dated; it&#x27;s remarkable how contemporary it sounds, anticipating post-rock, The Verve and Radiohead. It&#x27;s the sound of an artist being given the keys to the kingdom and returning with art.&quot;

Mark Lager, writing about the album on its 30th anniversary in September 2018 for PopMatters, similarly stated that &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; &quot;influenced and inspired the three most experimental and innovative albums of the 1990s: &quot;Lazer Guided Melodies&quot; (Spiritualized), &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot; (The Verve), and &quot;Hex&quot; (Bark Psychosis). All three albums followed its patterns of dynamic intensity, free jazz improvisations, and spaces of silence.&quot;

&quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; was voted number 419 in the 2000 edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2006, &quot;Q&quot; placed &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; at number 31 in its list of the &quot;40 Best Albums of the &#x27;80s&quot; and in 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked the record at number 95 in its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

<doc id="572866" wikidata="Q2271478" url="?curid=572866" title="Reginald Manningham-Buller, 1st Viscount Dilhorne">
<text>Reginald Edward Manningham-Buller, 1st Viscount Dilhorne, (1 August 1905 – 7 September 1980), known as Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller, Bt, from 1954 to 1962 and as The Lord Dilhorne from 1962 to 1964, was an English lawyer and Conservative politician. He served as Lord Chancellor from 1962 to 1964.

==Background and education==
Born in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, Manningham-Buller was the only son of Sir Mervyn Manningham-Buller, 3rd Baronet, grandson of Sir Edward Manningham-Buller, 1st Baronet, of Dilhorne Hall, Staffordshire, a junior member of the Yarde-Buller family headed by Baron Churston. His mother was the Hon. Lilah Constance, Lady Manningham-Buller , daughter of Charles Cavendish, 3rd Baron Chesham and granddaughter of Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster.

His uncle&#x27;s seat of Dilhorne Hall having passed to an heiress ineligible for the baronetcy, Manningham-Buller grew up in Northamptonshire. (Although pronounced &quot;Dill-horn&quot; by locals in later years, he preferred the older pronunciation of &quot;Dill-urn&quot;.) He was educated at Eton College, where he caused a fellow pupil to be expelled for making advances to another boy. He then attended Magdalen College, Oxford, where he took a Third in Law, before being called to the Bar by the Inner Temple in 1927.

==Political career==
Manningham-Buller was elected to the House of Commons in a 1943 by-election as member of parliament (MP) for Daventry. He was briefly Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Works in the caretaker government of Winston Churchill before it lost power in the general election of 1945, and became a King&#x27;s Counsel in 1947. In 1950, his seat became Northamptonshire South.

=== Law officer of the Crown ===
When Churchill regained power in 1951 Manningham-Buller was knighted and became Solicitor-General; in 1954 he was sworn of the Privy Council and became Attorney General for England and Wales. In 1956 he succeeded his father as fourth Baronet.

==== John Bodkin Adams prosecution ====
In 1957, Manningham-Buller prosecuted suspected serial killer Dr John Bodkin Adams for the murder of two elderly widows in Eastbourne, Edith Alice Morrell and Gertrude Hullett. The jury acquitted Adams on the Morrell charge after deliberating for less than an hour. Manningham-Buller controversially entered a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; regarding Hullett. Not only was there seemingly little reason to enter it (Adams was not suffering from ill health), but the Hullett charge was deemed by many to be the stronger of the two cases. Mr Justice Patrick Devlin, the presiding judge, in his post-trial book termed Manningham-Buller&#x27;s act &quot;an abuse of process&quot;. Devlin also criticised Manningham-Buller for his uncharacteristic weakness at a crucial moment in the Morrell case: evidence (some nurses&#x27; notebooks) that had gone missing from the Director of Public Prosecutions&#x27;s files, turned up in the hands of the defence on the second day of the trial. Manningham-Buller claimed he had not seen them before but failed to halt their admission as evidence, or ask for time to acquaint himself with their contents. They were subsequently used by the defence to throw doubt on the accuracy of the testimony of various nurses who had worked with Adams and who had questioned his methods and intentions. This damaged the prosecution tremendously, fatally scuppering the case. Manningham-Buller&#x27;s handling of the case later provoked questions in the House of Commons.

Detective Superintendent Herbert Hannam of Scotland Yard, the chief investigator, suspected political interference due to Manningham-Buller&#x27;s membership of a government, which had no interest in seeing a doctor hang. Indeed, on 8 November 1956, Manningham-Buller himself had handed a copy of Hannam&#x27;s 187-page report to the President of the British Medical Association (BMA), effectively the doctors&#x27; trade union in Britain. This document – the prosecution&#x27;s most valuable document – was in the hands of the defence, a situation that led the Home Secretary, Gwilym Lloyd-George, to reprimand Manningham-Buller, stating that such documents should not even be shown to &quot;Parliament or to individual Members&quot;. &quot;I can only hope that no harm will result&quot; since &quot;the disclosure of this document is likely to cause me considerable embarrassment&quot;. Subsequently, on 28 November 1956, Labour MPs Stephen Swingler and Hugh Delargy gave notice of two questions to be answered in the House of Commons on 3 December regarding Manningham-Buller&#x27;s contacts with the General Medical Council (GMC) and BMA regarding the Adams case in the previous six months. Manningham-Buller was absent on the day in question but gave a written reply stating he had &quot;had no communications with the General Medical Council within the last six months.&quot; He avoided referring to the BMA directly (despite it being named in the questions) and therefore avoided lying, though it could be argued, still deliberately misled the House. Manningham-Buller then proceeded to launch an investigation into how his contact with the BMA had come to be known by the MPs. A leak from Scotland Yard was suspected and Hannam was reprimanded.

Charles Hewett, Hannam&#x27;s assistant in the investigation, has described how both officers were astounded at Manningham-Buller&#x27;s decision to charge John Bodkin Adams with the murder of Mrs. Morrell, whose body had been cremated. He believed that there were other cases against the doctor, where traces of drugs had been found in exhumed remains, which were more capable of proof. He also considered that a charge of manslaughter would have been more appropriate in the circumstances. He questioned the decision not to proceed further after Adams&#x27; acquittal and he believed that a calculating killer escaped justice as a result. Home Office pathologist Francis Camps suspected Adams of killing 163 patients.

==== &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; prosecution ====
&quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; was banned in 1928 but republished in 1960 by Penguin Books. The decision was taken to prosecute Penguin under the new Obscene Publications Act. Bernard Levin criticised the decision thus: &quot;It is surely going to be difficult for the prosecution to find anybody taken seriously by the literary or academic worlds to swear that publication of &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; is not in the public interest as a literary event and that its tendency would be to deprave and corrupt those who might read it.&quot; When Manningham-Buller saw this in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, he cabled Sir Jocelyn Simon, Solicitor-General saying: &quot;suggest seriously consider spectator 19th Reggie&quot;. He then sent a letter stating: &quot;It seems to me a clear contempt of court and the only question is should we start proceedings? My feelings is that we should.&quot; Manningham-Buller suggested prosecuting &quot;the proprietors of &quot;The Spectator&quot;, the editor and Mr Bernard Levin&quot; once the Chatterley trial itself was over. Sir Jocelyn convinced him to reconsider.

== Lord Chancellorship ==
He continued as Attorney-General under Sir Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan until July 1962, when he was rather abruptly named Lord Chancellor and sent to the House of Lords to replace Lord Kilmuir. On his appointment he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Dilhorne, &quot;of Towcester in the County of Northampton&quot; on 17 July 1962. Retained, after Macmillan&#x27;s retirement, in the cabinet of Sir Alec Douglas-Home, when the Conservatives lost the election of 1964 he was created Viscount Dilhorne, &quot;of Greens Norton in the County of Northampton&quot; on 7 December, becoming the Deputy Leader of the Conservatives in the House of Lords. In 1969 he was named a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and continued in this capacity until retiring when he turned 75, in August 1980.

Manningham-Buller wrote the first report on the Profumo affair – an internal report for the Macmillan Government (confirmed by his daughter, The Baroness Manningham-Buller, when she appeared on the &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; radio programme). Then when Lord Denning was appointed to investigate and report on the affair, Dilhorne passed his report over to Denning. Chapman Pincher in his book &quot;Inside Story&quot; published in 1978 quotes Manningham-Buller as jokingly saying he could have sued Tom Denning for breach of copyright because significant portions of Manningham-Buller&#x27;s report appeared in Denning&#x27;s report virtually unchanged. Denning did include much in his report that was not in Manningham-Buller&#x27;s report.

=== Key judgments ===
Lord Dilhorne held in &quot;Newbury District Council v Secretary of State for the Environment; Newbury District Council v International Synthetic Rubber Co. Ltd. [1981] AC 578&quot;:
&quot;The conditions imposed must be for a planning purpose and not for any ulterior one... and they must fairly and reasonably relate to the development permitted. Also they must not be so unreasonable that no reasonable planning authority could have imposed them.
In that case he also introduced the concept of the &#x27;planning unit&#x27; which extinguishes previous permitted uses on land that has in practice become a new planning unit. This has stood up the test of recent jurisprudence and a DCLG (then DoE) circular is largely based on its principles.

==Bullying manner==
In the late 1950s, Bernard Levin gave Manningham-Buller the nickname &quot;Bullying-Manner&quot; in his Parliamentary sketch. When Manningham-Buller was elevated to the peerage as Lord Dilhorne, Levin renamed him Lord Stillborn. Lord Devlin, judge in the Adams case, described Buller&#x27;s technique thus: 
&quot;He could be downright rude but he did not shout or bluster. Yet his disagreeableness was so pervasive, his persistence so interminable, the obstructions he manned so far flung, his objectives apparently so insignificant, that sooner or later you would be tempted to ask yourself whether the game was worth the candle: if you asked yourself that, you were finished.&quot;
Manningham-Buller was one of the inspirations for the character of Kenneth Widmerpool in Anthony Powell&#x27;s &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot;.

==Personal life==
Manningham-Buller married Lady Mary Lilian Lindsay (1910–2004), daughter of David Lindsay, 27th Earl of Crawford, in 1930. They had a son and three daughters:

* John Mervyn Manningham-Buller, 2nd Viscount Dilhorne (28 February 1932 – 25 June 2022)
* Hon Marion Cynthia Manningham-Buller (26 November 1934 – 10 August 2013), married Edmund Crispin Stephen James George Brudenell.
* Elizabeth Lydia Manningham-Buller, Baroness Manningham-Buller (born 14 July 1948)
* Hon Anne Constance Manningham-Buller (born 13 August 1951), married Sir John Christopher Parsons, KCVO.

Manningham-Buller died in Knoydart, in the Scottish Highlands, on 7 September 1980, aged 75, and was interred in Deene, Northamptonshire. He was succeeded in the viscountcy by his only son, John. His second daughter was the Director-General of MI5 from 2002 to 2007 and in 2008 was awarded a life peerage, becoming the Rt Hon The Baroness Manningham-Buller, DCB. His granddaughter is model and media personality Lilah Parsons.

In Parliament, Dilhorne opposed the legislation to legalise homosexual acts between consenting men.
