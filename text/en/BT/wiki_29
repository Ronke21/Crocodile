<text>In English, the word like has a very flexible range of uses, ranging from conventional to non-standard. It can be used as a noun, verb, adverb, adjective, preposition, particle, conjunction, hedge, filler, quotative, and semi-suffix.

==Uses==
===Comparisons===
&quot;Like&quot; is one of the words in the English language that can introduce a simile (a stylistic device comparing two dissimilar ideas). It can be used as a preposition, as in &quot;He runs &quot;like&quot; a cheetah&quot;; it can also be used as a suffix, as in &quot;She acts very child-&quot;like&quot;. It can also be used in non-simile comparisons such as, &quot;She has a dog &quot;like&quot; ours&quot;.

=== As a conjunction ===
&quot;Like&quot; is often used in place of the subordinating conjunction &quot;as&quot;, or &quot;as if&quot;. Examples:

* They look &quot;like&quot; they have been having fun.
* They look &quot;as if&quot; they have been having fun.

Many people became aware of the two options in 1954, when a famous ad campaign for Winston cigarettes introduced the slogan &quot;Winston tastes good—like a cigarette should.&quot; The slogan was criticized for its usage by prescriptivists, the &quot;as&quot; construction being considered more proper. Winston countered with another ad, featuring a woman with greying hair in a bun who insists that ought to be &quot;Winston tastes good &quot;as&quot; a cigarette should&quot; and is shouted down by happy cigarette smokers asking &quot;What do you want—good grammar or good taste?&quot;

The appropriateness of its usage as a conjunction is still disputed, however. In some circles, it is considered an error to use &quot;like&quot; instead of &quot;as&quot; or &quot;as if&quot; in formal prose.

===As a noun ===
Like can be used as a noun meaning &quot;preference&quot; or &quot;kind&quot;. Examples:

* She had many likes and dislikes.
* We&#x27;ll never see the like again.

When used specifically on social media, it can refer to interactions with content posted by a user, commonly referred to as &quot;likes&quot; on websites such as Twitter or Instagram.

* That picture you posted got a lot of likes!

=== As a verb ===
As a verb, &quot;like&quot; generally refers to a fondness for something or someone.

* I &quot;like&quot; riding my bicycle.

&quot;Like&quot; can be used to express a feeling of attraction between two people that is weaker than love. It does not necessarily imply a romantic attraction. Example:

* Marc &quot;likes&quot; Denise.
* I&#x27;ve taken a &quot;liking&quot; to our new neighbors.

&quot;Like&quot; can also be used to indicate a wish for something in a polite manner. Example:

* Would you like a cup of coffee?

===As a colloquial adverb ===
In some regional dialects of English, &quot;like&quot; may be used as an adverbial colloquialism in the construction &quot;be&quot; + &quot;like&quot; + &quot;to&quot; infinitive, meaning &quot;be likely to, be ready to, be on the verge of.&quot; Examples:

* He was like to go back next time.
* He was like to go mad.

As the following attest, this construction has a long history in the English language.

* But Clarence had slumped to his knees before I had half-finished, and he &quot;was like to&quot; go out of his mind with fright. (Mark Twain, 1889, &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court&quot;)
* He saw he &quot;was like to&quot; leave such an heir. (Cotton Mather, 1853, &quot;Magnalia Christi Americana&quot;)
* He &quot;was like to&quot; lose his life in the one [battle] and his liberty in the other [capture], but there was none of his money at stake in either. (Charles MacFarlane and Thomas Napier Thomson, 1792, &quot;Comprehensive History of England&quot;)
* He was in some fear that if he could not bring about the King&#x27;s desires, he &quot;was like to&quot; lose his favor. (Gilbert Burnet, 1679, &quot;History of the Reformation of the Church of England&quot;)

=== As a colloquial quotative ===
&quot;Like&quot; is sometimes used colloquially as a quotative to introduce a quotation or impersonation. This is also known as &quot;quotation through simile&quot;. The word is often used to express that what follows is not an exact quotation but instead gives a general feel for what was said. In this usage, &quot;like&quot; functions in conjunction with a verb, generally &quot;be&quot; (but also &quot;say&quot;, &quot;think&quot;, etc.), as in the following examples:

* He was like, &quot;I&#x27;ll be there in five minutes.&quot;
* She was like, &quot;You need to leave the room right now!&quot;

&quot;Like&quot; can also be used to paraphrase an implicitly unspoken idea or sentiment:

* I was like, &quot;Who do they think they are?&quot;

The marking of past tense is often omitted (compare historical present):

* They told me all sorts of terrible things, and I&#x27;m like &quot;Forget it then.&quot;

It is also sometimes used to introduce non-verbal mimetic performances, e.g., facial expressions, hand gestures, body movement, as well as sounds and noises:

* I was like [speaker rolls eyes].
* The car was like, &quot;vroom!&quot;

The use of &quot;like&quot; as a quotative is known to have been around since at least the 1980s.

=== As a discourse particle, filler or hedge ===

====History====

The word &quot;like&quot; has developed several non-traditional uses in informal speech. Especially since the late 20th century onward, it has appeared, in addition to its traditional uses, as a colloquialism across all dialects of spoken English, serving as a discourse particle, signalling either a hedge indicating uncertainty, or alternatively a marker of focus signalling that what follows is new information Although these particular colloquial uses of &quot;like&quot; became widespread among young students in the 1980s, its use as a filler is a fairly old regional practice in Welsh English and in Scotland; it was used similarly at least as early as the 19th century. It is traditionally, though not quite every time, used to finish a sentence in the Northern English dialect Geordie. It may also be used in a systemic format to allow individuals to introduce what they say, how they say and think.

Despite such prevalence in modern-day spoken English, these colloquial usages of &quot;like&quot; rarely appear in writing (unless the writer is deliberately trying to replicate colloquial dialogue) and they have long been stigmatized in formal speech or in high cultural or high social settings. Furthermore, this use of &quot;like&quot; seems to appear most commonly, in particular, among people who were children and adolescents in the 1980s, while less so, or not at all, among people who were already middle-aged or elderly at that time. One suggested explanation was that younger English speakers were still developing their linguistic competence, and, metalinguistically wishing to express ideas without sounding too confident, certain, or assertive, use &quot;like&quot; to fulfill this purpose in the cases where they were using &quot;like&quot; as a hedge.

In pop culture, such colloquial applications of &quot;like&quot; (especially in verbal excess) are commonly and often comedically associated with Valley girls, as made famous through the song &quot;Valley Girl&quot; by Frank Zappa, released in 1982, and the film of the same name, released in the following year. The stereotyped &quot;valley girl&quot; language is an exaggeration of the variants of California English spoken by people who were young in the 1980s.

This non-traditional usage of the word has been around at least since the 1950s, introduced through beat (or beatnik) and jazz culture. The beatnik character Maynard G. Krebs (Bob Denver) in the popular &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; TV series of 1959-1963 brought the expression to prominence; this was reinforced in later decades by the character of Shaggy on &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; (who was based on Krebs).

Very early use of this locution can be seen in a New Yorker cartoon of 15 September 1928, in which two young ladies are discussing a man&#x27;s workplace: &quot;What&#x27;s he got – an awfice?&quot; &quot;No, he&#x27;s got like a loft.&quot;

It is also used in the 1962 novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; by the narrator as part of his teenage slang and in the &quot;Top Cat&quot; cartoon series from 1961 to 1962 by the jazz beatnik type characters.

A common eye dialect spelling is &quot;lyk&quot;.

====Examples====
&quot;Like&quot; can be used in much the same way as &quot;um...&quot; or &quot;er...&quot; as a discourse particle. It has become common especially among North American teenagers to use the word &quot;like&quot; in this way, as in Valspeak. For example:

* I, like, don&#x27;t know what to do.

It is also becoming more often used (East Coast Scottish English, Northern England English, Hiberno-English and Welsh English in particular) at the end of a sentence, as an alternative to &quot;you know&quot;. This usage is sometimes considered to be a colloquial interjection and it implies a desire to remain calm and defuse tension:

* I didn&#x27;t say anything, like.
* Just be cool, like.

Use of &quot;like&quot; as a filler has a long history in Scots English, as in Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s 1886 novel &quot;Kidnapped&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;What&#x27;ll like be your business, mannie?&quot;
&quot;What&#x27;s like wrong with him?&quot; said she at last.&lt;/poem&gt;

&quot;Like&quot; can be used as hedge to indicate that the following phrase will be an approximation or exaggeration, or that the following words may not be quite right, but are close enough. It may indicate that the phrase in which it appears is to be taken metaphorically or as a hyperbole. This use of &quot;like&quot; is sometimes regarded as adverbial, as &quot;like&quot; is often synonymous here with adverbial phrases of approximation, such as &quot;almost&quot; or &quot;more or less&quot;. Examples:

* I have, like, no money left.
* The restaurant is only, like, five miles from here.
* I, like, almost died!

Conversely, &quot;like&quot; may also be used to indicate a counterexpectation to the speaker, or to indicate certainty regarding the following phrase. Examples:

* There was, like, a living kitten in the box!
* This is, like, the only way to solve the problem.
* I, like, know what I&#x27;m doing, okay?

In the UK reality television series &quot;Love Island&quot; the word &#x27;like&#x27; has been used an average of 300 times per episode, much to the annoyance of viewers.

<text>Booster Gold (Michael Jon &quot;Booster&quot; Carter) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Dan Jurgens, the character first appeared in &quot;Booster Gold&quot; #1 (February 1986) and has been a member of the Justice League.

He is initially depicted as a glory-seeking showboat from the future, staging high-publicity heroics through his knowledge of historical events and futuristic technology. Carter develops over the course of his publication history and through personal tragedies to become a hero weighed down by his reputation.

The character has been portrayed in live action television by Eric Martsolf in &quot;Smallville&quot; and by Donald Faison in the seventh season of the Arrowverse series &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot;. The character will appear in an upcoming self-titled television series on Max, set in the DC Universe (DCU) media franchise.

==Publication history==

Booster Gold first appeared in &quot;Booster Gold&quot; #1 (February 1986), being the first significant new character introduced into DC Universe continuity after &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. The next year, he began to appear regularly in the &quot;Justice League&quot; series remaining a team member until the group disbanded in 1996. He and his former Leaguers subsequently appeared as the &quot;Superbuddies&quot; in the &quot;Formerly Known as the Justice League&quot; miniseries and its &quot;JLA: Classified&quot; sequel &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Not the Justice League&quot;.

At Wizard World Los Angeles in March 2007, Dan DiDio announced a new ongoing series titled &quot;All-New Booster Gold&quot;, which was later published as simply &quot;Booster Gold&quot;. The series follows the events of &quot;52&quot; and was initially co-written by Geoff Johns and Jeff Katz, with art by creator Jurgens and Norm Rapmund. The series focuses primarily on Booster Gold&#x27;s clandestine time travel within the DC Universe. The series also features Rip Hunter, Skeets, and Booster&#x27;s ancestors Daniel Carter and Rose Levin as supporting characters. The tagline of the series is: &quot;The greatest hero you&#x27;ve never heard of!&quot;. Katz and Johns left the book after 12 issues (#1-10, #0, and a One Million issue). Jurgens and Rapmund stayed. Jurgens assumed writing duties following four issues by guests Chuck Dixon and Rick Remender.

In May 2010, Keith Giffen took over the &quot;Booster Gold&quot; title, linking it with the 26-week miniseries &quot;Justice League: Generation Lost&quot;, in which Booster united with Fire, Ice and Captain Atom to defeat the resurrected Maxwell Lord. From July 2010 through February 2011, Booster starred alongside Rip Hunter, Green Lantern, and Superman in the six-issue miniseries &quot;Time Masters: Vanishing Point&quot;, part of the &quot;Return of Bruce Wayne&quot; arc, which also reintroduced the Reverse-Flash and established the background for the 2011 DC crossover event &quot;&quot;. Jurgens returned to the main &quot;Booster Gold&quot; title with issue #44.

===Development===
Jurgens&#x27;s 1984 series proposal for Booster Gold compared the hero to U.S. Olympic Gold athletes such as Dorothy Hamill, Peggy Fleming, and Caitlyn Jenner, who had turned &quot;Olympic gold into commercial gold&quot;, selling multiple products based on their fame and past accomplishments. Booster&#x27;s origin as a security guard at a future Superman museum was altered when writer/artist John Byrne was brought to DC to reboot Superman&#x27;s origin in &quot;The Man of Steel&quot;.

===Legacy===
Since his origin, other characters within the DC Universe have hinted that there is a greater purpose to Booster Gold than he knows.

During the &quot;Millennium&quot; event, Harbinger reveals to Martian Manhunter that Booster is descended from the Chosen and that he must be protected. It is revealed that Booster is destined to come to the past to protect him from an unknown event in the future. In &quot;52&quot;, Rip states that the moment Booster helped save the multiverse from Mister Mind would be remembered in the future as the start of Gold&#x27;s &quot;glory years.&quot; Later, in the new &quot;Booster Gold&quot; series, Rip hints at a &quot;Carter heroic legacy.&quot; It is then revealed that Booster is important to the Time Masters, as he will train &quot;the greatest of them all&quot;, being the father and the teacher of Rip Hunter himself, who willingly chose to protect his identity against other time-travelers, to pass through history as the only loser of the clan. Despite the general distrust of Booster, Rip and his descendants apparently know the truth, always honoring him.

Due to the complicated time-travel mechanics, Booster&#x27;s future self, &quot;currently&quot; operating from an unknown era with his time-travel educated wife, still watches over his past self and his son, making sure that Rip Hunter gives his past self proper schooling. The older Booster acts in total anonymity, and has access to other &quot;time-lost&quot; equipment than his suit, such as Superboy&#x27;s seemingly-destroyed &quot;super-goggles&quot;.

Due to a temporal paradox, the future Booster is revealed to be a more experienced Time Master than his son Rip Hunter, but also that he personally tasked Rip to school his past self. It is also implied that the departure of the Hypertime concept, rather than a simple retcon, is Booster&#x27;s work, as in the future he tasked himself with the role of pruning divergent timelines from each universe in the Multiverse.

==Fictional character biography==
===From the future===
Michael Jon Carter was born poor in 25th-century Gotham City. He and his younger twin sister, Michelle, never knew their father because he left after gambling away all their money. Michael was a gifted athlete, attending Gotham University on a football scholarship. At Gotham U., Michael was a star quarterback until his father reentered his life and convinced him to deliberately lose games for gambling purposes. He was exposed, disgraced and expelled. Later, he was able to secure a job as a night watchman at the Metropolis Space Museum, where he studied displays about superheroes and villains from the past, particularly the 20th century.

Michael&#x27;s sidekick is a robot named Skeets. Skeets is a 25th-century security robot (sometimes &quot;valet unit&quot;) with artificial intelligence. He is capable of flight, cognition, and voice projection, which are all considered highly advanced for 21st century Earth. He also has historical records which give him a vast knowledge of what will happen between the 21st and 25th centuries, though its reliability has become questionable. He possesses numerous miniature tools and weapons kept within his shell, and is also equipped with a powerful energy blaster. He is apparently immune to reality and temporal manipulation.

With the help of Skeets, Michael stole devices from the museum displays, including a Legion of Super-Heroes flight ring and Brainiac 5&#x27;s force field belt. He used Rip Hunter&#x27;s Time Sphere, also on display in the museum, to travel to the 20th century, intent on becoming a superhero and forming a corporation based around himself to make a comfortable living. He is a shameless self-promoter whose obsession with fame and wealth irritates other heroes.

Carter&#x27;s nickname as a football player was &quot;Booster&quot;, but his chosen 20th century superhero name was &quot;Goldstar&quot;. After saving Ronald Reagan, Carter mangled the two names, causing Reagan to introduce him as &quot;Booster Gold&quot;. The name stuck. In a running joke throughout the DC Universe, people erroneously call him &quot;Buster,&quot; to his chagrin.

===Celebrity===
Booster is originally based in Superman&#x27;s home city, Metropolis. He starts his hero career by preventing the shapeshifting assassin Chiller, an operative of The 1000, from killing the President of the United States and replacing him. With the subsequent public exposure, Booster signs a multitude of commercial and movie deals. During his career, his sister Michelle Carter, powered by a magnetic suit, follows in his footsteps as the superheroine Goldstar. Booster is devastated when she dies battling creatures from another dimension. Amassing a small fortune, Booster founds Goldstar, Inc. (later Booster Gold International) as a holding company and hires Dirk Davis to act as his agent. During the &quot;Millennium&quot; event, Davis reveals that he is a Manhunter in disguise and that he siphoned money from Booster&#x27;s accounts in hopes of leaving him no choice but to do the Manhunters&#x27; bidding. Although the Manhunters are ultimately defeated, Booster is left bankrupt.

===&quot;Justice League&quot;===
Booster Gold is a key character in the late 1980s/early 1990s &quot;Justice League&quot; revamp by writers Keith Giffen and J. M. DeMatteis. Booster Gold is frequently partnered with fellow Justice League member Blue Beetle, and the two quickly become best friends. The duo&#x27;s notable appearances include a stint as superhero repo men, and as the minds behind the construction of a gaming resort, Club JLI, on the living island Kooey Kooey Kooey.

After one too many embarrassments and longing for his old reputation, Booster quits the League to found The Conglomerate, a superhero team whose funding is derived from corporate sponsors. Booster and his team are determined to behave as legitimate heroes, but find that their sponsors compromise them far too often. The Conglomerate reforms several times after Booster rejoins the League, though without much success.

When an alien comes to Earth on a rampage, Booster coins the name Doomsday for it. While battling the entity, Booster&#x27;s costume is destroyed. Blue Beetle is able to design a new, bulkier costume to replace it, although this costume often malfunctions. During a later battle with Devastator, a servant of the Overmaster, Booster is nearly killed and loses an arm. Again, Blue Beetle comes to his aid, designing a suit that acts as a life support system in addition to replicating the powers of Booster&#x27;s previous costumes. This suit also includes a cybernetic prosthetic for his lost arm.

===&quot;Extreme Justice&quot;===
After the Justice League falls apart, Booster Gold joins Extreme Justice, a team led by Captain Atom. While a member of this team, Booster makes a deal with the supervillain Monarch, who fully heals Booster&#x27;s wounds so that he can once again remove his battle suit. Booster dons a new costume created by Blue Beetle. Skeets acts as its systems controller, who aids Booster and is able to take control of the costume if Booster is rendered unconscious.

Following the disbanding of Extreme Justice, this suit is destroyed. Professor Hamilton subsequently creates a new one based on the designs of both the original 25th century costume and the energy containment suit Superman was wearing at this time. This costume is later tweaked to closer resemble Booster&#x27;s original costume.

===&quot;Countdown to Infinite Crisis&quot;: &quot;The OMAC Project&quot;===
After the events depicted in the limited series &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;, in which Sue Dibny is murdered, Gold retires briefly, but then helps Blue Beetle discover who is manipulating KORD Industries. Booster is badly injured in an explosion at Kord&#x27;s home, and it is revealed that his companion Skeets has been dismantled for its 25th century technology by the Checkmate organization.

In &quot;The OMAC Project&quot; limited series, Booster Gold gathers the old Justice League International heroes to investigate Blue Beetle&#x27;s disappearance. At the series&#x27; end, he is ruined physically and emotionally, having destroyed much of his gear in the fight against the OMACs. He has seen his friend Rocket Red die in battle. He discovered that another friend, Maxwell Lord, is responsible for killing Blue Beetle and that in fact, Lord always hated metahumans and superheroes. In a moment of self-reflection, he realizes that if only he had bothered to recall more of what was history in his native era, he might have been able to warn his friends. Giving a farewell kiss to the forehead of his wounded teammate Fire as she lay in a hospital bed, he drops his trademark goggles on the floor and leaves, saying only that he has decided to &quot;go home&quot;, implying a return to the 25th century.

===&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;===
In &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Gold resurfaces in the ruins of the Justice League Watchtower on the moon, along with Skeets, again branded as a criminal in his time for &quot;hijacking historical records&quot;. When Skeets fails to locate the absent Martian Manhunter, Booster searches for Jaime Reyes, the new Blue Beetle, whom he takes to the Batcave. Booster tells Batman the subject of the stolen records: Batman never finds Brother Eye, but Booster implies that, with Jaime&#x27;s aid, they can succeed. The mission is successful and Booster plays a pivotal role in the destruction of the satellite.

===&quot;52&quot; and Supernova===

In the aftermath of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman temporarily retire their costumed identities, and the remaining heroes attend a memorial for Superboy in Metropolis. Booster attends the memorial, but when Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman do not arrive as he expects, he suspects his robot sidekick Skeets is malfunctioning and becomes hysterical. After Skeets reports other incorrect historical data, Booster searches fellow time traveler Rip Hunter&#x27;s desert bunker for answers, finding it littered with enigmatic scrawled notes. Booster finds photos of himself and Skeets surrounded by the words &quot;his fault&quot; with arrows pointing toward them.

===One Year Later===

Following the events of &quot;52&quot;, Booster Gold returns in his second solo series with the first story arc &quot;52 Pick-Up&quot;. Booster puts in a request to the Justice League that they admit him and the group begrudgingly decide to monitor him over the following week. However, Rip Hunter informs Booster that history has become malleable after Mister Mind&#x27;s rampage and earlier damage to the timeline.

===&quot;Blackest Night&quot;===

In a tie-in to the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; event, Booster faces Ted Kord, who has been reanimated as a Black Lantern. At first unavailable due to reliving Ted&#x27;s funeral in the past, he returns to meet his ancestor Daniel Carter, only to find the crashed, derelict Bug at his house. Then, he finds the Black Lantern pummeling Jaime Reyes, Daniel, and Skeets. Attacked by him, he removes Daniel and Rose from the scene and heads to Kord Industries to arm himself. He uses a special light gun designed by Ted to blast the corpse and separate the ring with light, simulating the emotional spectrum.

Upon separating the corpse from the ring, he collects Ted&#x27;s remains before the ring can reanimate them and takes them into the Time Sphere to Vanishing Point Fortress to secure them. He is somewhat relieved when Skeets uses the Fortress&#x27;s special chronal surveillance equipment to display images of the days of Team Blue and Gold. Jaime promises to live up to Kord&#x27;s legacy and eventually form a new Blue and Gold team. They find evidence at the warehouse of someone else entering, even though the doors were genetically coded, with only two people cleared for access: Ted and Booster.

===&quot;Brightest Day&quot;===

Booster next finds his sister living in Coast City mere hours before its destruction. Though unable to save her boyfriend, Booster and Michelle patch up their relationship, with her agreeing not to leave him. This arc introduces an older Booster Gold, the man that trained Rip Hunter and was the master of both Time, the Multiverse, and Hypertime. Rip reveals that this Booster is not only his father, but also has been watching Rip training the young Booster Gold, aiding him when needed. Older Booster also reveals that he is still married to Rip&#x27;s mother, and that Michelle is with them in some unknown time.

In &quot;Justice League: Generation Lost&quot;, Booster is part of the manhunt to bring the resurrected Maxwell Lord to justice. He finds Max but is beaten badly. Fire, Ice, and Captain Atom find him just as Lord uses his psychic powers to the utmost to erase all memory of himself from the minds of the entire world. For some reason, Booster, Fire, Ice, and Atom are the only ones who remember Lord and see him in recorded images. Trying to convince Batman (Dick Grayson), Booster is horrified to learn that, thanks to Max, the world believes Ted Kord committed suicide. Fire, Ice, and Captain Atom are soon set up by Max to cut them off from allies, but, ironically, Booster is left alone because his reputation is already poor.

===&quot;Flashpoint&quot;===

After the &quot;Time Masters: Vanishing Point&quot; event, Rip Hunter informed them that someone snuck into the JLI base, leaving messages on a chalkboard about the altered timeline. When Earth entered an alternate timeline due to the actions of the Flash, Booster and Skeets awaken and are the only ones who remember the original timeline due to the former&#x27;s suit protecting them. Gold travels to Coast City, but US soldiers attack him mistaking him to be an Atlantean threat. Skeets is damaged when Gold is attacked by the military&#x27;s Project Six, which is revealed to be Doomsday.

During the battle in Coast City, he discovers that Doomsday is controlled by General Nathaniel Adam. He escapes from Doomsday and then saves a woman named Alexandra Gianopoulos from Doomsday&#x27;s attack. He learns the timeline has been changed, suspecting Professor Zoom. Alexandra and Booster split up, but she secretly has powers allowing her to take others&#x27; powers and follows him. Later, he flies to Gotham City when Doomsday attacks him. General Adam&#x27;s control link is destroyed by Alexandra in an attempt to rescue Booster. Doomsday&#x27;s true personality comes to the surface and he attacks Booster. During the fight, Doomsday beats him nearly to death, but he is rescued by Alexandra. He tries to prevent Doomsday from killing innocent people, and manages to put Doomsday&#x27;s helmet back on. Doomsday&#x27;s control is restored to Adam, who grabs Booster, hoping to kill him. Fortunately, Adam takes him back to the base for interrogation, allowing him to escape when the sight of &quot;Project Superman&quot; causes Doomsday&#x27;s true personality to resurface. Alexandra defeats Doomsday by using the control helmet to make Doomsday tear himself apart, subsequently asking Booster to take her with him when he restores history to normal. Alexandra subsequently sacrifices herself to save Booster from an Atlantean attack, leaving him to return to Vanishing Point as history resets without any clear memory of his time in the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; universe. Before the &quot;Time Masters: Vanishing Point&quot; event, Alexandra somehow appeared in the JLI base and left the messages regarding the altered timeline on the chalkboard before vanishing.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===

In &quot;The New 52&quot;, Booster Gold appears as part of the new &quot;Justice League International&quot; series. In the Post-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; continuity, Booster is portrayed with his original glory-seeking personality and is chosen by the U.N. to lead the JLI due to his PR sense and naiveté. He takes his leadership role seriously, and strives to become a better hero and role model. However, despite his best efforts and support from Batman, who officially defers to Booster&#x27;s leadership after supporting Booster for leader, the JLI falls apart due to a string of attacks against the group that leaves members killed or wounded. Despite his best attempts to bring in new members, Booster later watches in horror as the hero OMAC betrays the team and inflicts more carnage, including teleporting Blue Beetle to the homeworld of the villainous &quot;Reach&quot; species.

In the end, Booster is confronted with what appears to be an older version of him, an agent of A.R.G.U.S. who warns his present self to prevent Superman and Wonder Woman from dating. Failure to prevent it, without explanation, would cause Booster Gold to cease existing. As the JLI monitor reveals Superman and Wonder Woman kissing, the future Booster disappears. The present day Booster disappears moments later. A.R.G.U.S.&#x27; director Amanda Waller orders Chronos to search for the contemporary Booster through time, but Chronos is captured by the Secret Society. The older Booster Gold mysteriously reappears in other timelines, like 19th century Gotham City. In &quot;Booster Gold: Futures End&quot; #1, the older Booster clarifies he is not an older version of the &quot;New 52&quot; Booster, but an older version of him from a universe which no longer exists. The older Booster is sent careening through the timeline, eventually meeting up with his sister, Goldstar, who is in a version of Metropolis which has been sealed in a bubble by a godlike version of Brainiac from an alternative universe. They are teleported to where the younger, New 52 Booster is held captive by Brainiac. Brainiac threatens to kill Michelle unless the younger Booster gives up the location of Vanishing Point, which he concedes. The older Booster knows this could lead to the end of the Multiverse, setting up the events of &quot;Convergence&quot;.

In the two-part &quot;Convergence: Booster Gold&quot;, Booster is found by a Pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; Rip Hunter on Skartaris, where the older Booster Gold and Goldstar are in prison on the planet Telos, where Brainiac has gathered cities from across the history of the Multiverse. The &quot;New 52&quot; Booster and Rip release them both. Hunter tells older Booster that he has not traveled through the timeline, but through the cities in the planet which were now chronal anomalies that he was in conflict with, and that his body absorbed so much time travel radiation that he was aging rapidly and dying. The aged Pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; Booster transports again, and encounters the &quot;Zero Hour&quot; Ted Kord. Booster explains to Kord that he has led a good life, married and had a son. Rip, the &quot;New 52&quot; Booster and Michelle find him, and Rip forces the &quot;New 52&quot; Booster to take his father into the raw chronal field contained at Vanishing Point to cure him; Pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; Booster&#x27;s body is destroyed, but he is reborn as Waverider, an all-knowing cosmic time traveler. Waverider then emerges on Telos in the final issue of &quot;Convergence&quot;, along with the &quot;New 52&quot; Booster and Goldstar to bring back Brainiac, and they convince him to save the Multiverse from its imminent destruction. Brainiac then sends the &quot;Zero Hour&quot; Parallax and Pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; Superman to the conclusion of the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; to avert the original crisis event, restoring the Multiverse.

Alternate versions of Booster Gold and Blue Beetle as they were prior to &quot;Countdown to Infinite Crisis&quot; appear in the pages of &quot;Justice League 3000&quot; #14, where they are awaken from a 1,000-year suspended animation on Takron-Galtos in the 31st century. According to Keith Giffen, &quot;they&#x27;re J.M. DeMatteis and my Blue Beetle and Booster Gold&quot;.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===

In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to the New 52. Booster Gold and his robot partner Skeets return in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #992.

<text>Dan Jurgens (; born June 27, 1959) is an American comic book writer and artist. He is known for his work on the DC comic book storyline &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; and for creating characters such as Doomsday, Hank Henshaw, and Booster Gold. Jurgens had a lengthy run on the Superman comic books including &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot;, &quot;Superman vol. 2&quot; and &quot;Action Comics&quot;. At Marvel, Jurgens worked on series such as &quot;Captain America&quot;, &quot;The Sensational Spider-Man&quot; and was the writer on &quot;Thor&quot; for six years. He also had a brief run as writer and artist on &quot;Solar&quot; for Valiant Comics in 1995.

==Career==

===1980s===
After graduating from Minneapolis College of Art and Design in 1981, Jurgens&#x27; first professional comic work was for DC Comics on &quot;The Warlord&quot; #63 (Nov. 1982). He was hired due to a recommendation of Warlord creator Mike Grell who was deeply impressed by Jurgens&#x27; work after being shown his private portfolio at a convention. In 1984, Jurgens was the artist for the &quot;Sun Devils&quot; limited series (July 1984 – June 1985), with writers Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas. Jurgens would make his debut as a comic book writer with &quot;Sun Devils.&quot; He began scripting from Conway&#x27;s plots with #8 (Feb. 1985) and fully took over the writing duties on the title with #10 (April 1985). In 1985, Jurgens created the character Booster Gold, who became a member of the Justice League. Jurgens was one of the contributors to the &quot;DC Challenge&quot; limited series in 1986. His first work on Superman was as penciller for &quot;The Adventures of Superman Annual&quot; #1 (1987). In 1988, Jurgens provided pencil art for the Deadman short stories which were written by Mike Baron in the short-lived anthology &quot;Action Comics Weekly&quot; from issues #601–612. He then had a run as artist of &quot;Green Arrow&quot; with writer Mike Grell from 1988 to 1990. In 1989, Jurgens began working full-time on the Superman character when he took over the writing/pencilling of the monthly &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot;.

===1990s===
Jurgens was the penciller of the 1991 limited series &quot;Armageddon 2001&quot; and co-created the hero Waverider with Archie Goodwin. Jurgens helped writer Louise Simonson and artist Jon Bogdanove launch a new Superman title, &quot;&quot; in July 1991 and assumed the writing/pencilling of the main &quot;Superman&quot; comic book with issue No. 57 (July 1991). He created a supporting hero named Agent Liberty in issue No. 60 (Oct. 1991) and then worked on the &quot;Panic in the Sky&quot; crossover in 1992. During his run on &quot;Superman&quot;, Jurgens created two major villains, Doomsday and the Cyborg Superman. Doomsday was the main antagonist in &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; storyline which saw the iconic hero killed in an issue consisting entirely of splash pages. The Cyborg Superman was an existing character which Jurgens reintroduced in &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; #500 for the &quot;Reign of the Supermen&quot; storyline. Jurgens wrote and drew &quot;Justice League America&quot; (#61–77 April 1992 – July 1993) and in 1993 pencilled the &quot;Metal Men&quot; four-issue miniseries, which was a retcon of their origin story. Jurgens wrote and pencilled the crossover series &quot;Zero Hour&quot; and the &quot;Superman/Doomsday: Hunter/Prey&quot; miniseries, both in 1994.

Jurgens scripted and provided layout art for the &quot;Superman vs. Aliens&quot; miniseries. The story featured a battle between Superman and the aliens created by H. R. Giger (a.k.a. the Xenomorphs), from the titular film series. It was co-published by Dark Horse Comics and DC in 1995. In the same year, he gave up the pencilling duties on &quot;Superman&quot;. Also in 1995 he was writer/penciller on &quot;Solar&quot; with issue #46 from Valiant Comics wherein he worked with inker Dick Giordano and with penciller Tom Grindberg joining in with issues #51–54 after Jurgens relinquished penciller duties with issue #50. In 1996 Jurgens and Italian artist Claudio Castellini worked on the highly publicized crossover &quot;Marvel vs DC&quot;. Jurgens was one of the many creators who worked on the &quot;&quot; one-shot in 1996 which featured the title character&#x27;s marriage to Lois Lane. Jurgens developed the Tangent Comics imprint for DC the following year.

In January 1996, Jurgens was writer and penciller of the new Spider-Man series, &quot;The Sensational Spider-Man&quot;, at Marvel Comics. The title was initially conceived to be the flagship showcase for the new Ben Reilly Spider-Man. The initial seven issues (#0–6, January–July 1996) were written and pencilled by Jurgens. Jurgens pushed strongly for the restoration of Peter Parker as the true Spider-Man and plans were made to enact this soon, but Bob Harras, the new Editor-in-chief, demanded the story be deferred until after the &quot;Onslaught&quot; storyline. Jurgens had by this stage become disillusioned with the immense amount of group planning and constant changes of ideas and directions and took this as the last straw, resigning from the title. In a past interview several years after his &quot;Spider-Man&quot; run, Jurgens stated that he would like to have another chance on the character, since his run was with the Ben Reilly character during the &quot;Spider-Man Clone Saga&quot;, and not Peter Parker. Jurgens wrote and pencilled &quot;Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 2) for its entire two-year, 24-issue run (October 1996 – September 1998). George Pérez, the co-creator of &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; served as inker for the series&#x27; first 15 issues. After 10 years working on the Superman character, Jurgens ended his run as writer with &quot;Superman&quot; vol. 2 #150 (Nov. 1999). Also in 1999, Jurgens was writer and layout artist for the tabloid-sized graphic novel &quot;Superman/Fantastic Four&quot;, with finished art by his former &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; inker Art Thibert. Jurgens worked with Marvel Comics as writer on &quot;Thor&quot; vol. 2 with pencilling by John Romita Jr. and as writer/artist on &quot;Captain America&quot; vol. 3. Jurgens was the debut writer of the &quot;Tomb Raider: The Series&quot; comic book series licensed to Top Cow Productions and Image Comics, which in 1999. The debut issue of &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; was the number one selling comic book of that year. Jurgens was writer of the series until issue #21.

===2000s===
In 2000, Jurgens was the writer and provided layouts for the four issue prestige miniseries &quot;Titans/Legion of Super-Heroes: Universe Ablaze&quot;, with finishes provided by Phil Jimenez. Jurgens wrote &quot;Aquaman&quot; vol. 3 from issue #63 (Jan. 2000) until its cancellation with issue #75 (Jan. 2001). In November 2002, he wrote and pencilled the four-issue weekly miniseries &quot;Superman: Day of Doom&quot; (Jan. 2003), which marked the 10 year anniversary of &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; storyline from 1992. After a hiatus from comics, he returned to DC Comics, providing layouts for the lead story in the &quot;Infinite Crisis Secret Files 2006&quot; special (April 2006) and provided art for the weekly series &quot;52&quot; and to the six-issue limited series &quot;Crisis Aftermath: The Battle For Blüdhaven&quot; written by Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Grey. Jurgens collaborated with writer/creator Marv Wolfman on the &quot;Nightwing&quot; series for issues #125–128. On &quot;Metamorpho: Year One&quot;, Jurgens was writer and penciller for the first two issues with Mike Norton drawing issues #3–6. Jurgens was writer and artist of the &quot;History of the Multiverse&quot; back-up stories in the weekly &quot;&quot;Countdown&quot;&quot; which appeared in issues #49–38. At the Los Angeles Comic Con in March 2007, DC announced a new, ongoing &quot;Booster Gold&quot; series written by Geoff Johns, pencilled by Jurgens, and inked by Norm Rapmund to begin shortly after the end of &quot;52&quot;. He was the writer of &quot;Tangent: Superman&#x27;s Reign&quot; limited series in 2008, revisiting the Tangent Comics characters and wrote and illustrated an issue of &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; vol. 2 No. 23 (July 2009), which featured Booster Gold and Magog.

===2010s===

Jurgens was amongst the creative talent of DC Comics&#x27; The New 52 relaunch in 2011, becoming the writer of the new &quot;Justice League International&quot; series with artist Aaron Lopresti and the artist of the new &quot;Green Arrow&quot; series with writer J. T. Krul and inker George Pérez. He became co-writer of &quot;Green Arrow&quot; with Keith Giffen on issues #3–6. DC announced in October 2011 that Jurgens would return to Superman, co-writing and drawing, the self-titled &quot;Superman&quot; series with Giffen. Their first issue was #7 (cover dated May 2012). During 2012–2013, Jurgens was writer and artist of &quot;Fury of the Firestorms: The Nuclear Men&quot; from issues #13–20, where the series was canceled. In 2014, he and Giffen together with Jeff Lemire and Brian Azzarello co-wrote &quot;The New 52: Futures End&quot;. In 2015, Jurgens became the writer for &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;, starting with issue #1 in June 2015. He was writer of the two-issue miniseries &quot;Convergence: Superman&quot; in 2015, and was the writer for &quot;&quot; from 2015 to 2016. As part of the DC Rebirth relaunch of 2016, Jurgens wrote &quot;Action Comics&quot;, with the series returning to the previous numbering, beginning with issue #957. He contributed to &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1000 (June 2018) and then became the writer of the &quot;Green Lanterns&quot; series.

<text>Lion Feuchtwanger (; 7 July 1884 – 21 December 1958) was a German Jewish novelist and playwright. A prominent figure in the literary world of Weimar Germany, he influenced contemporaries including playwright Bertolt Brecht.

Feuchtwanger&#x27;s Judaism and fierce criticism of the Nazi Party, years before it assumed power, ensured that he would be a target of government-sponsored persecution after Adolf Hitler&#x27;s appointment as chancellor of Germany in January 1933. Following a brief period of internment in France and a harrowing escape from continental Europe, he found asylum in the United States, where he died in 1958.

== Life and career ==
=== Ancestry ===
Feuchtwanger&#x27;s Jewish ancestors originated from the Middle Franconian city of Feuchtwangen; following a pogrom in 1555, it had expelled all its resident Jews. Some of the expellees subsequently settled in Fürth, where they were called the &quot;Feuchtwangers&quot;, meaning those from Feuchtwangen. Feuchtwanger&#x27;s grandfather Elkan moved to Munich in the middle of the 19th century.

=== Early life ===
Lion Feuchtwanger was born in 1884 to Orthodox Jewish margarine manufacturer Sigmund Feuchtwanger and his wife, Johanna (née Bodenheimer). He was the oldest in a family of nine siblings of whom another two, Martin and Ludwig Feuchtwanger, also became authors; Ludwig&#x27;s son is the London-based historian Edgar Feuchtwanger (born 1924). Two of his sisters settled in Palestine following the rise of the Nazi Party. One was killed in a concentration camp, and another settled in New York.

Feuchtwanger made his first attempt at writing while still a secondary-school student and won an award. In 1903, in Munich, he passed his Abitur examinations at an elite school, the Wilhelmsgymnasium. He then studied history, philosophy and German philology in Munich and Berlin. He received his PhD in 1907, under Francis Muncker, with a study of Heinrich Heine&#x27;s unfinished 1840 novel &quot;The Rabbi of Bacharach&quot;.

=== Early career ===

After studying a variety of subjects, he became a theatre critic and founded the culture magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; in 1908 (no connection to the post-WWII magazine of the same name). The first issue appeared on 30 April. After 15 issues and six months, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; merged with Siegfried Jacobsohn&#x27;s journal &quot;Die Schaubühne&quot; (renamed in 1918 to &quot;Die Weltbühne&quot;) for which Feuchtwanger continued to write. He was one of the contributors of the Swedish avant-garde magazine &quot;Thalia&quot; between 1910 and 1913. In 1912, he married a Jewish merchant&#x27;s daughter, Marta Loeffler. She was pregnant at the wedding, but the child died shortly after birth.

After the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Feuchtwanger served in the German military (November 1914), but was released early for health reasons. His experience as a soldier contributed to his leftist writings.

In 1916, he published a play based on the story of Joseph Süß Oppenheimer, which premiered in 1917, but Feuchtwanger withdrew it a couple of years later as he was dissatisfied with it.

During the German Revolution of 1918–1919, Feuchtwanger was ill and unable to participate.

=== Association with Brecht ===
Feuchtwanger soon became a figure in the literary world, and he was sought out by the young Bertolt Brecht. Both collaborated on drafts of Brecht&#x27;s early work, &quot;The Life of Edward II of England&quot;, in 1923–1924. According to Feuchtwanger&#x27;s widow, Marta, Feuchtwanger was a possible source for the titles of two other Brecht works, including &quot;Drums in the Night&quot; (first called &quot;Spartakus&quot; by Brecht).

=== Shift from drama to novels ===
After some success as a playwright, Feuchtwanger shifted his emphasis to writing historical novels. His most successful work in this genre was &quot;Jud Süß&quot; (&quot;Süss, the Jew&quot;), written 1921–1922, published 1925, which was well received internationally. His second great success was &quot;The Ugly Duchess Margarete Maultasch&quot;. For professional reasons, he moved to Berlin in 1925 and then to a large villa in Grunewald in 1932. He published the first part of his Josephus trilogy, &quot;The Jewish War&quot;, in 1932.

In 1930, and wrote his first socio-political novel , based on the events of Beer Hall Putsch, as his reaction on the impending threat of Nazism; the novel would become the first entry in &quot;Wartesaal&quot; trilogy about the rise of Nazism in Germany. He continued the trilogy with &quot;The Oppermanns&quot; in 1933, which would become one of his best-known books.

=== Persecution by the Nazis ===
==== Early opposition ====
Feuchtwanger was one of the first to produce propaganda against Hitler and the Nazi Party. As early as 1920 he published in the satirical text &quot;Conversations with the Wandering Jew&quot;:

Towers of Hebrew books were burning, and bonfires were erected as high as the clouds, and people burnt to char, innumerable, and voices of priests sang in accompaniment: Gloria in excelsis Deo. Traces of men, women, children dragged themselves across the square, from all sides, they were naked or in rags, and they had nothing with them but bodies and the tatters of book scrolls – of torn, disgraced book scrolls, soiled with feces. And there followed them men in kaftans and women and children in the clothes of our day, countlessly, endlessly.
==== Rise of Nazism and exile ====
In 1930, Feuchtwanger published , a fictionalized account of the rise and fall of the Nazi Party (in 1930, he considered it a thing of the past) during the inflation era. The Nazis soon began persecuting him, and while he was on a speaking tour of America, in Washington, D.C., he was guest of honor at a dinner hosted by the then ambassador Friedrich Wilhelm von Prittwitz und Gaffron on the same day (30 January 1933) that Hitler was appointed Chancellor. The next day, Prittwitz resigned from the diplomatic corps and called Feuchtwanger to recommend that he not return home. Feuchtwanger, however, did not heed his advice and returned to Germany.

In 1933, while Feuchtwanger was on tour, his house was ransacked by government agents who stole or destroyed many items from his extensive library, including invaluable manuscripts of some of his projected works (one of the characters in &quot;The Oppermanns&quot; undergoes an identical experience). In the summer of 1933, his name appeared on the first of Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Ausbürgerungsliste&quot;, which were documents by which the Nazis arbitrarily deprived Germans of their citizenship and so rendered them stateless. During that time, he published the novel &quot;The Oppermanns&quot;. Feuchtwanger and his wife did not return to Germany but moved to Southern France, settling in Sanary-sur-Mer. His works were included among those burned in the 10 May 1933 Nazi book burnings held across Germany. Later &quot;Success&quot; and &quot;The Oppermanns&quot; would become the first two parts of the &quot;Wartesaal&quot; (&quot;The Waiting Room&quot;) trilogy. 

On 25 August 1933, the official German government gazette, &quot;Reichsanzeiger&quot;, included Feuchtwanger&#x27;s name on the list of those whose German citizenship was revoked because of &quot;disloyalty to the German Reich and the German people.&quot; Because Feuchtwanger had addressed and predicted many of the Nazis&#x27; crimes even before they came to power, Hitler considered him a personal enemy, and the Nazis designated Feuchtwanger as the &quot;Enemy of the state number one,&quot; as mentioned in &quot;The Devil in France&quot;.

In his writings, Feuchtwanger exposed Nazi racist policies years before the British and French governments abandoned their policy of appeasement towards Hitler. He remembered that American politicians were also among those who suggested that &quot;Hitler be given a chance&quot;. With the publication of &quot;Success&quot; in 1930 and &quot;The Oppermanns&quot; in 1933, he became a prominent spokesman in opposition to the Third Reich. Within a year, the novel was translated into the Czech, Danish, English, Finnish, Hebrew, Hungarian, Norwegian, Polish and Swedish languages. In 1936, still in Sanary, he wrote &quot;The Pretender&quot; (&quot;Der falsche Nero&quot;), in which he compared the Roman upstart Terentius Maximus, who had claimed to be Nero, with Hitler.

After leaving Germany in 1933, Feuchtwanger lived in Sanary-sur-Mer. The high sales of his books, especially in the Anglo-Saxon world, allowed him a relatively comfortable life in exile. In 1940, he finished &quot;Wartesaal&quot; with the third novel, &quot;Exil&quot; (translated into English as &quot;Paris Gazette&quot;)

==== Imprisonment and escape ====
When France declared war on Germany in 1939, Feuchtwanger was interned for a few weeks in Camp des Milles. When the Germans invaded France in 1940, Feuchtwanger was captured and again imprisoned at Les Milles. Later, the prisoners of Les Milles were moved to a makeshift tent-camp near Nîmes because of the advance of German troops. From there, he was smuggled to Marseille disguised as a woman. After months of waiting in Marseille, he fled with his wife Marta to the United States via Spain and Portugal, staying briefly in Estoril, with the help of several Americans involved in helping artists and writers in danger of persecution by Nazi Germany escape Nazi-controlled Europe. His rescuers included Varian Fry (an American journalist who helped refugees escape from occupied France); Hiram Bingham IV (US Vice Consul in Marseille); Myles Standish (US Vice Consul in Marseille); Waitstill Sharp and Martha Sharp (a Unitarian minister and his wife who were in Europe on a similar mission as Fry). 

Waitstill Sharp volunteered to accompany Feuchtwanger by rail from Marseille, across Spain, to Lisbon. Had Feuchtwanger been recognized at border crossings in France or Spain, he might have been detained and turned over to the Gestapo. Realizing that Feuchtwanger might be abducted by Nazi agents even in Portugal, Martha Sharp gave up her own berth on the &quot;Excalibur&quot; so Feuchtwanger could sail immediately for New York City with her husband.

Feuchtwanger&#x27;s arrival in New York in early October 1940 had adverse consequences on the escape organizations in France. The novelist &quot;out of an unplumbable naivete or an unforgivable and opportunistic ego&quot; described his escape in detail to &quot;The New York Times.&quot; His rescuers in France were endangered by Feuchtwanger&#x27;s indiscretions. The news story soon got to Europe with the consequence that Spain closed its borders, possibly under pressure from Nazi Germany. The closed border with Spain caused rescue operations to nearly cease for the remainder of the year. 

=== Asylum in United States ===
Granted political asylum in the United States, Feuchtwanger settled in Los Angeles in 1941, when he published a memoir of his internment, &quot;The Devil in France&quot; (&quot;Der Teufel in Frankreich&quot;).

In 1943, Feuchtwanger bought Villa Aurora in Pacific Palisades, California; he continued to write there until his death in 1958. In 1944, he cofounded the publishing house Aurora-Verlag in New York City.

=== Stalinism ===
In response to the Western Powers pursuing a policy of appeasement of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy (the Anglo-German Naval Treaty of 1935; allowing the German reoccupation of the Rhineland (1936); non-intervention against the 1936 Falangist Coup in Spain; Italy&#x27;s attack on Abyssinia in 1935), Feuchtwanger flirted with Soviet communism out of a longing to find the staunchest enemy of Germany&#x27;s National Socialism.

From November 1936 to February 1937 he travelled to the Soviet Union. In his book, &quot;Moskau 1937&quot;, he praised life under Joseph Stalin. Feuchtwanger also defended the Great Purge and the show trials which were then taking place against both real and imagined Trotskyites and &quot;enemies of the people&quot;. Feuchtwanger&#x27;s praise of Stalin triggered outrage from Arnold Zweig and Franz Werfel. The book has been criticized by Trotskyists as a work of naive apologism. Feuchtwanger&#x27;s friendly attitude toward Stalin later delayed his naturalization in the United States.

=== Postwar ===
During the McCarthy era, Feuchtwanger became the target of suspicion as a pro-Soviet intellectual. In 1947 he wrote a play about the Salem Witch Trials, &quot;Wahn oder der Teufel in Boston&quot; (&quot;Delusion, or The Devil in Boston&quot;), thus anticipating the theme of &quot;The Crucible&quot; (1953) by Arthur Miller; &quot;Wahn&quot; premiered in Germany in 1949. It was translated by June Barrows Mussey and performed in Los Angeles in 1953 under the title &quot;The Devil in Boston.&quot; In New York a Yiddish translation was shown. At the end of life, Feuchtwanger dealt with Jewish themes again (&quot;The Jewess of Toledo&quot;) and advocated for the State of Israel as a Jewish refuge.

In 1953, Feuchtwanger won the National Prize of East Germany first Class for art and literature.

=== Illness and death ===
Lion Feuchtwanger became ill with stomach cancer in 1957. After several operations he died from internal bleeding in late 1958. His wife Marta continued to live in their house on the coast and remained an important figure in the exile community, devoting the remainder of her life to the work of her husband. Before her death in 1987, Marta Feuchtwanger donated her husband&#x27;s papers, photos and personal library to the Feuchtwanger Memorial Library, housed within the Special Collections of the Doheny Memorial Library at the University of Southern California.

== Major works ==
=== &quot;Jud Süß&quot; ===

Feuchtwanger was already well known throughout Germany in 1925, when his first popular novel, &quot;Jud Süß&quot; (&quot;Jew Suss&quot;), appeared. The story of Joseph Süß Oppenheimer had been the subject of a number of literary and dramatic treatments over the course of the past century, the earliest Wilhelm Hauff&#x27;s 1827 novella. The most successful literary adaptation was Feuchtwanger&#x27;s 1925 novel, based on a play he had written in 1916 but then withdrawn. Feuchtwanger intended his portrayal of Süß not as an antisemitic slur but as a study of the tragedy caused by the human weaknesses of greed, pride, and ambition.

The novel was rejected by the major publishing houses and then was reluctantly taken on by a small publishing house. However, the novel was so well received that it went through five printings of 39,000 copies within a year as well as being translated into 17 languages by 1931. The novel&#x27;s success established Feuchtwanger as a major German author as well as giving him a royalty stream that afforded him a measure of financial independence for the rest of his life.

His drama and his hugely successful novel were adapted for the cinema screen initially in a sympathetic version produced at Denham Studios in Great Britain in 1934 under the direction of fellow German expatriate Lothar Mendes with one of Germany&#x27;s greatest actors, also a refugee from Nazi persecution, Conrad Veidt: &quot;Jew Süss&quot;.

The NSDAP party in Germany then made their own anti-Semitic version under the very same title, to undercut the British film. The Nazi film industry version was made under the direction of Veit Harlan: &quot;Jud Süß&quot; (1940). Unlike the British version, the anti-Semitic film, released in 1940, portrays Oppenheimer as an evil character.

=== &quot;The Oppermanns&quot; ===

In January 1933, Hitler becomes the Chancellor of Germany. Feuchtwanger reacted to the regime change with the novel &quot;The Oppermanns&quot;. At first, Feuchtwanger was writing it as a screenplay proposed by the British Government, however, it was never completed and instead was reworked into a novel, resulting in the book&#x27;s style, which differs with quick-cuts and literary montage sequences. After being released the same year, it instantly became popular and was translated into over 10 languages. Klaus Mann later praised the novel as the &quot;most striking, most widely read narrative description of the calamity that descended over Germany&quot;; Frederick S. Roffman wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1983 that &quot;no single historical or fictional work has more tellingly or insightfully depicted the relentless disintegration of German humanism, the insidious manner in which Nazism began to permeate the fabric of German society.&quot; 

In 2018, &quot;Deutsche Welle&quot; put the novel in their &quot;100 German Must-Reads&quot; list, called it &quot;Feutchwanger&#x27;s most recognized novel&quot; and wrote that today it is &quot;considered one of the most important literary works documenting the downfall of a democracy&quot;.

As Roffman noted, Feuchtwanger&#x27;s popularity has declined after 1950s in the English-speaking countries, while remaining strong in the German-speaking ones. In 2022, the novel was rediscovered, and a new version of the English translation of &quot;The Oppermanns&quot; was released, with an introduction by Joshua Cohen, who also noted the lack of Feuchtwanger&#x27;s popularity in English-speaking countries. In his review of the novel, Cohen calls it &quot;one of the last masterpieces of German Jewish culture&quot;.

<doc id="567175" wikidata="Q4889762" url="?curid=567175" title="Bennett buggy">
<text>A Bennett buggy was a term used in Canada during the Great Depression to describe a car which had its engine, windows and sometimes frame work taken out and was pulled by a horse. In the United States, such vehicles were known as Hoover carts or Hoover wagons, named after then-President Herbert Hoover.

The Canadian term was named after Richard Bennett, the Prime Minister of Canada from 1930 to 1935, who was blamed for the nation&#x27;s poverty.

Cars being pulled by horses became a common sight during the Depression. During the boom years of the 1920s, many Canadians had bought cheap vehicles for the first time, but during the depression, many found they did not have enough money to operate them. This was especially true in the hard-hit Prairie Provinces. The increased poverty played an important role, as farmers could not buy gasoline. The price of gas also increased. Gas taxes were also one of the best sources of revenue for the provincial governments. When these provinces went into a deficit, they increased these taxes, making gas even harder to buy.

In Saskatchewan, badly hit by the depression, similar vehicles with an additional seat over the front axle were dubbed &quot;Anderson carts&quot; after Premier James T. M. Anderson.

<text>Harry Kenneth Woolf, Baron Woolf (born 2 May 1933) is a British life peer and retired barrister and judge. He was Master of the Rolls from 1996 until 2000 and Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales from 2000 until 2005. The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 made him the first Lord Chief Justice to be President of the Courts of England and Wales. He was a Non-Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong from 2003 to 2012. He sits in the House of Lords as a crossbencher.

==Early life==
Woolf was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, on 2 May 1933, to Alexander Susman Woolf and his wife Leah (). His grandfather Harry was a naturalised Briton of Polish and Russian Jewish origins. His father had been a fine art dealer, but was persuaded to run his own building business instead by his wife. They had four children, but their first child died, and his mother was protective of the three surviving children. Woolf lived in Newcastle-upon-Tyne until he was about five years old, when his family moved to Glasgow, Scotland, where he attended Glasgow Academy going on to Fettes College, an Edinburgh public school, where he mostly enjoyed his time and had supportive friends.

Woolf formed much of his sense of justice and fairness from his experiences at Fettes College. On one occasion while combing his hair, Woolf leaned into a neighbouring dormitory cubicle to use the mirror. A prefect reported this as the school had strict rules about being in other pupils&#x27; cubicles, but Woolf felt that he had not broken the rules because he did not have his feet inside the cubicle at the time. He appealed for fairness, but his housemaster, who had been in the army, increased Woolf&#x27;s punishment from six strokes of the cane to eight.

Woolf had read books about lawyers and wanted to be a barrister. His housemaster told him that this was not a suitable career-choice for him because he had a stutter, but this only made Woolf more determined in his vocation. His A level results gained him a place at the University of Cambridge; however, he studied law at University College London (UCL) instead, as a consequence of his parents&#x27; move to London at about that time.

==Legal career==

Woolf chose to be a barrister in 1955 and began practising on the Oxford circuit. He became Junior Counsel to the Inland Revenue (Common Law) from 1973 to 1974, and was promoted to First Junior Treasury Counsel (Common Law) from 1974 to 1979.

A significant part of his practice as the &quot;Treasury Devil&quot; was in the development of the nascent Administrative Law from four ancient Prerogative Writs. Before the Administrative Court was established, almost all judicial reviews were heard before the Lord Chief Justice sitting in a Divisional Court of the Queen&#x27;s Bench Division, with Woolf commonly appearing for the Crown.
When he took silk he was almost immediately appointed as a High Court judge in that Division in 1979, aged 45, and received the customary knighthood.

He was promoted to Lord Justice of Appeal and automatically made a member of Her Majesty&#x27;s Most Honourable Privy Council (PC) in 1986.

===Woolf Inquiry===
Lord Justice Woolf was appointed to hold a five-month public inquiry with Her Majesty&#x27;s Chief Inspector of Prisons, Judge Stephen Tumim, into the disturbances at Strangeways prison, Manchester and other prisons between 11 June on 31 October 1990. His inquiry sent letters to every prisoner and prison officer in the country. The Woolf Report, quoting many of the 1700 replies, was published on 25 February 1991, and blamed the loss of control of the Strangeways prison on the prison officers abandoning the gates outside the chapel, which &quot;effectively handed the prison to the prisoners&quot;.

More fundamentally, however, Woolf blamed the &quot;intolerable&quot; conditions inside Strangeways in the months leading up to the riots and a &quot;combination of errors&quot; by the prison staff and Prison Service management as a central contributing factor. Finally, he blamed the failure of successive governments to &quot;provide the resources to the Prison Service which were needed to enable the Service to provide for an increased prison population in a humane manner&quot;. Woolf recommended major reform of the Prison Service, and made 12 key recommendations with 204 accompanying proposals. He subsequently became patron of the Rehabilitation for Addicted Prisoners Trust and an Ambassador for the Prison Advice and Care Trust.

===Master of the Rolls and Lord Chief Justice===
Woolf LJ was appointed a Law Lord on 1 October 1992, being created a life peer as Baron Woolf, of Barnes in the London Borough of Richmond. Woolf gave few judgments on the Appellate Committee, being promoted Master of the Rolls on 4 June 1996., a role in which he presided over the Chancery law in the Court of Appeal.

In 1998 Woolf was also the head of the committee that modernised civil procedure, and incidentally excised most Latin terms from English law in an effort to make it more accessible (such as changing the word &quot;plaintiff&quot; to &quot;claimant&quot;). The Civil Procedure Rules 1998 are a direct result of this work.

On 6 June 2000 he finally succeeded Lord Bingham of Cornhill as Lord Chief Justice. In this most senior judicial post, Woolf spoke out at the University of Cambridge in 2004 against the Constitutional Reform Bill that would create a Supreme Court of the United Kingdom to replace the House of Lords as the final court of appeal in the United Kingdom; and he severely questioned the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s and the Government&#x27;s handling of recent constitutional reforms. He delayed his retirement as Lord Chief Justice until these issues had been resolved.

In 2003, he was appointed a Non-Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong, which position he held until 2012.

On his retirement as Lord Chief Justice on 1 October 2005, Woolf joined Blackstone Chambers as a mediator and arbitrator. From September to December 2005 he conducted a review of the working methods of the European Court of Human Rights, and he is chairman of the Bank of England Financial Markets Law Committee.

===Other appointments===
Among other work, Woolf has been serving as Chancellor of the Open University of Israel since 2004. He is Chairman of the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, Chairman of the Council of University College, London and a visiting Professor of Law.
He is a member of the House of Lords Constitution Committee.

In 2006 he was chairman of the Judging Panel of the FIRST Responsible Capitalism Awards.
On 25 February 2007, Woolf was inaugurated as the first President of the Qatar Financial Centre Civil and Commercial Court, in Doha, Qatar.

On 15 June 2007, he took the chair of an Ethics Committee set up by BAE Systems, the UK&#x27;s largest arms company, in response to allegations of multimillion-pound bribery in arms deals with Saudi Arabia. This Woolf Committee reported in May 2008, and clearly influenced the Law Commission report proposing anti-corruption and bribery law reforms on 20 November 2008 and the Government&#x27;s consequent Bribery Bill published on 25 March 2009, which was ultimately enacted as the Bribery Act.

In 2007 he was named as co-chair, with Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, of the Commission on Settlement in International Arbitration, for the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution for which he also consults.

From 29–31 May 2009, Woolf served with Sir William Blair, a High Court Judge, as the Co-Convener of the inaugural Qatar Law Forum of Global Leaders in Law, held in Doha, Qatar.

In 2018, Woolf was appointed the Head Justice of the Astana International Financial Centre Court in Astana, Kazakhstan.

==Selected judgments==
* On 26 July 1983, Woolf&#x27;s judgment in the high court, Gillick v West Norfolk &amp; Wisbech AHA &amp; DHSS [1983] 3 WLR (QBD), clarified the law under which doctors could prescribe contraception to minors.
* On 6 February 1997, three judges, led by Woolf, Master of the Rolls, said that the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) had failed to exercise discretion when it denied Diane Blood the right to have her dead husband&#x27;s child in March 1995. The decision allowed Blood to have a child using her former husband&#x27;s sperm, which was obtained shortly before he died.
* &quot;Pearce v United Bristol Healthcare NHS Trust&quot; [1999] PIQR 53.
* In October 2000, Woolf reduced the minimum sentence of Jon Venables and Robert Thompson for the murder of James Bulger by two years in recognition of their good behaviour and remorse shown while in detention, effectively restoring the original trial judge&#x27;s eight-year recommended minimum sentence.
* In July 2002, Woolf, together with Mr Justice Curtis and Mr Justice Henriques, refused Barry George&#x27;s first appeal against his conviction for the murder of Jill Dando. However, in November 2007, the next Lord Chief Justice, Lord Phillips, in the light of further expert opinions of the forensic evidence, declared George&#x27;s conviction &quot;unsafe&quot; and also ordered a retrial. George was held in custody pending retrial and following an eight-week hearing he was acquitted on 1 August 2008.

Other judgments include:
*&quot;Vaughan v Barlow Clowes International Ltd&quot; [1991] EWCA Civ 11 - English trusts law, concerning tracing
*&quot;Fitzpatrick v British Railways Board&quot; [1992] ICR 221, [1992] IRLR 376 - UK labour law, concerning collective bargaining

<doc id="567196" wikidata="Q5730498" url="?curid=567196" title="Henry Woolf">
<text>Henry Woolf (20 January 1930 – 11 November 2021) was a British actor, theatre director, and teacher of acting, drama and theatre who lived in Canada. He was a longtime friend and collaborator of 2005 Nobel Laureate Harold Pinter, having stimulated Pinter to write his first play, &quot;The Room&quot; (1957), in 1956. Woolf served as a faculty member at the University of Saskatchewan from 1983 to 1997 and as artistic director of Shakespeare on the Saskatchewan from 1991 until 2001.

==Early life==
Henry Woolf was born to Jewish parents in Homerton, London on 20 January 1930. He was educated at Hackney Downs School, where he met Harold Pinter; he and Pinter were friends and collaborators for over 60 years. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of London and then pursued a postgraduate course in directing at the University of Bristol, before going to the United States, to earn a postgraduate diploma from the College of William and Mary, in Williamsburg, Virginia. In the process of undertaking his directing course at Bristol, he commissioned and directed Harold Pinter&#x27;s first play, &quot;The Room&quot; (1957), in which he also originated the role of Mr Kidd.

==Professional career==
Woolf&#x27;s film credits include &quot;San Ferry Ann&quot; (1965), &quot;Marat/Sade&quot; (1967), &quot;Tell Me Lies&quot; (1968), &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; (1968), &quot;Great Catherine&quot; (1968), &quot;The Bed Sitting Room&quot; (1969), &quot;Alfred the Great&quot; (1969), &quot;The Ruling Class&quot; (1972), &quot;The Love Pill&quot; (1972), &quot;Galileo&quot; (1975), &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; (1975), &quot;Rogue Male&quot; (1976), &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; (1978), &quot;Gorky Park&quot; (1983), &quot;Superman III&quot; (1983), and &quot;Maid to Order&quot; (1987). In &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot; (1978), a film by the Rutles (a fictional mock-Beatles band jointly created by Eric Idle and Neil Innes), Woolf played a character named Arthur Sultan, a fictional spoof of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. His later film appearances include in the 2004 short film, &quot;Of Note&quot; and the 2007 short film &quot;smallfilm&quot;.

On British television, Woolf played the Man in Harold Pinter&#x27;s one-man play &quot;Monologue&quot; (1973); parts in &quot;Rutland Weekend Television&quot; (1975–1976) and &quot;The Sweeney&quot; (1975); the Collector in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Sun Makers&quot; (1977); served as the host of the 1970s pre-school British educational series &quot;Words and Pictures&quot;; and performed the role of Doctor Cornelius in the BBC adaptation of &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; (1989). He also played a role in &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; (1973) as local gangster Frankie Barrow, a role which had originated in &quot;Steptoe and Son Ride Again&quot; (1973), the second film spin-off of the series.

Woolf joined the faculty of the University of Saskatchewan in 1983, was promoted to professor in 1990, also serving as head of its Drama Department, and received the university&#x27;s Master Teacher Award in 1994, before retiring in 1997, at the Canadian mandatory retirement age of 67. He served as artistic director of the annual summer Shakespeare on the Saskatchewan festival, in Saskatoon, from 1991 until his retirement from that position in 2001. In 2001 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Saskatchewan.

In March 2003, Woolf directed an all-female production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, by William Shakespeare, at the University of Winnipeg.

In April 2007, Woolf reprised his roles as Mr Kidd in a production of Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Room&quot; (1957), marking the 50th anniversary of the original production, and as the Man in Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Monologue&quot; (1973), both of which occurred at the University of Leeds conference Artist and Citizen: 50 Years of Performing Pinter. He was a member of the Saskatchewan Order of Merit. He received the Saskatchewan Centennial Medal on 17 February 2006 Saskatchewan Centennial Medal.

==Personal life==
In 1978, with his wife, actress/director Susan Williamson, whom he married in 1968, Woolf moved to Canada where he took a teaching position at the University of Alberta Drama Department. By 1983, they had settled in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, where they were resident until his death. They had four children.

Woolf died on 11 November 2021, at the age of 91.

<doc id="567203" wikidata="Q2268423" url="?curid=567203" title="GIPF (game)">
<text>GIPF is an abstract strategy board game by Kris Burm, the first of seven games in his series of games called the &quot;GIPF&quot; Project.
&quot;GIPF&quot; was recommended by Spiel des Jahres in 1998.

==Rules==

The game board has a hexagonal shape with 4 intersection points per side and 37 intersections altogether, connected by a triangular grid. The playing area is surrounded by an array of 24 dots that are used to introduce pieces into play. 

To start, players deploy three pieces each, alternating colors, at the corners of the playing area, and turn the board so that a corner with the player&#x27;s color is closest to them. In the starting position shown here, the White player is seated at the bottom of the board while the Black player is at the top. White takes the first turn. There are 18 pieces of each color; the basic game uses 15 (or more) while the standard and tournament games use all 18 for each player.

===Placing and pushing===
In each turn, players introduce a piece onto the board from one of the surrounding dots, then push the new piece into the playing area along a line connected to the dot. When a piece is pushed onto the playing area, any pieces ahead of it are pushed ahead along the same line as well. There are several restrictions on this movement:
# The &quot;push&quot; moves pieces only one space/node at a time.
# An intermediate free space/node interrupts the &quot;push&quot; and any piece(s) beyond the free space/node do not move.
# The &quot;push&quot; cannot move a piece out of the playing area. That is, if the chosen line is already &quot;full&quot; and has pieces all the way to the opposite end of the playing field, then that direction is blocked and the piece cannot be pushed.

===Basic 4-in-a-row mechanic===
In the most basic form of the game, each player has a reserve inventory of 12 pieces in addition to the 3 on the board for the starting position. To extend the length of the game, each player could add one, two, or three extra pieces to their reserves; alternatively, as a handicap, the less-experienced player could be given up to three extra pieces in their reserve.

Forming a continuous line of four pieces in the player&#x27;s color results in three actions:
# All of the pieces (friendly and opposing) in the line contiguous with the 4-in-a-row are removed from the board.
# The friendly pieces in the contiguous line are returned to the player&#x27;s reserves.
# Any opposing pieces in the contiguous line are captured and no longer available to the opposing player.

* When two groups of four in a row are created simultaneously:
** If the groups do not intersect, both are captured.
** If the groups do intersect, the player of that color may choose which group to take.
** If both players must take pieces, the player who placed and pushed chooses first.

Once one player runs out of pieces in their reserve, the other player is the winner.

=== Standard game ===

The standard game follows the basic rules but includes &quot;GIPF&quot; pieces, which are each two stacked pieces. The starting position is the same, but all six pieces on the board to start are double-stacked &quot;GIPF&quot; pieces. Each player still starts with 18 &quot;basic&quot; (single) pieces, but the revised starting position with six &quot;GIPF&quot; pieces means each player&#x27;s reserves start with 12 &quot;basic&quot; pieces.

The basic pushing and 4-in-a-row mechanics remain the same, with the following exceptions:
# Only &quot;basic&quot; pieces can be introduced and pushed onto the board. No new &quot;GIPF&quot; pieces can be created.
# When a &quot;GIPF&quot; piece is in a line to be removed from the board, the player who is removing the line can choose whether or not to leave the &quot;GIPF&quot; piece on the board. Because the winning condition requires at least one &quot;GIPF&quot; piece of the player&#x27;s color to remain on the board, it is generally advantageous to remove the opponent&#x27;s &quot;GIPF&quot; pieces.
# When two 4-in-a-row groups intersect, and the &quot;GIPF&quot; piece is at the point of intersection, the player may choose to remove one or both lines. In either case, the player also may choose to keep the &quot;GIPF&quot; piece on the board or remove it with either line.
# If a &quot;GIPF&quot; piece of the player&#x27;s color is returned to the reserve, it is separated and returned as two &quot;basic&quot; pieces.

As in the basic game, exhausting the opponent&#x27;s reserves is one winning condition. The other is eliminating all of the opponent&#x27;s &quot;GIPF&quot; pieces.

=== Tournaments ===
As a suggestion, in tournament play, the following modified rules can be used:
# The board is started without any pieces.
# Each player&#x27;s first move shall introduce and push a &quot;GIPF&quot; piece onto the board.
# An unlimited number of &quot;GIPF&quot; pieces can be introduced, if desired, on the player&#x27;s second and subsequent turns. However, once a &quot;single&quot; piece has been introduced, that player may not introduce any more &quot;GIPF&quot; pieces.

==Gameplay and strategy==
Players take turns pushing tokens (one player taking black, the other white) from the edge of the tri-gridded, hexagonal board, with pieces already in play pushed in front of the new placements rather than allowing more than one piece on any space.

The game is lost if a player has no more tokens to play, and since each starts with a set number of tokens, it is clearly necessary to recycle pieces already positioned to keep playing. This is achieved by contriving to line up four pieces of the same colour in a row on the board, at which point those tokens are returned to their owner, and any opposing tokens extending from the line of four are captured.

Because a single player will often move several pieces and change numerous on-board relationships, it is remarkably difficult to predict the state of the board more than one turn ahead, despite &quot;GIPF&quot; being a game of perfect information. Play tends to be highly fluid and there is no real concept of long term territorial or spatial development.

The game can be expanded with extra pieces (available separately) called &quot;Potentials&quot;, which allow different kinds of moves to be made. These are named for the other games in the &quot;GIPF&quot; Project, though the other games are not actually necessary in order to utilise the Potentials named after them.

<doc id="567204" wikidata="Q1502043" url="?curid=567204" title="Rules of engagement">
<text>Rules of engagement (ROE) are the internal rules or directives afforded military forces (including individuals) that define the circumstances, conditions, degree, and manner in which the use of force, or actions which might be construed as provocative, may be applied. 

They provide authorization for and/or limits on, among other things, the use of force and the employment of certain specific capabilities. In some nations, articulated ROE have the status of guidance to military forces, while in other nations, ROE constitute lawful command. Rules of engagement do not normally dictate how a result is to be achieved, but will indicate what measures may be unacceptable.

While ROE is used in both domestic and international operations by some militaries, ROE is not used for domestic operations in the United States. Instead, the use of force by the U.S. military in such situations is governed by Rules for the Use of Force (RUF).

An abbreviated description of the rules of engagement may be issued to all personnel. Commonly referred to as a &quot;ROE card&quot;, this document provides the soldier with a summary of the ROE regulating the use of force for a particular mission.

==Authoritative sources==
While many countries have their own rules of engagement documents, many others do not. There are two primary international rules of engagement manuals that are internationally available: NATO &quot;ROE Manual MC 362-1&quot; (restricted to NATO and Partnership for Peace countries); and the &quot;San Remo Rules of Engagement Handbook&quot;, which is freely available to all on the International Institute of Humanitarian Law (IIHL) website. Created for the IIHL by Commander Alan Cole, Major Phillip Drew, Captain Rob McLaughlin and Professor Dennis Mandsager, the &quot;San Remo ROE Handbook&quot; has been translated from its English original into French, Chinese, Arabic, Spanish, Hungarian, Russian, Bosnian, and Thai and several other languages. Several countries, such as the UK, have used the San Remo Manual as a model for creating their own ROE systems.

==Training==
The International Institute of Humanitarian Law in San Remo, Italy conducts rules of engagement training course at least once per year, usually in September. Taught by some of the world&#x27;s foremost authorities on ROE, the course attracts students from around the globe. Similar training by the San Remo ROE drafting team is conducted for the United Nations, staff colleges and other organizations as requested.

Its transmitter is located just off of Highway 21, southeast of the city. CITV-DT carries the full Global network schedule, and its programming is similar to sister station CICT-DT in Calgary.

==History==
The station first signed on the air on September 1, 1974. CITV was originally owned by Allarcom, owned by Dr. Charles Allard, and launched under the brand &quot;Independent Television&quot; (ITV). Allard&#x27;s proposal won out over three competing applicants for a second commercial station in Edmonton because it emphasized local programming.
In 1981, CITV became a national superstation, being offered on most cable television systems across the country through the Cancom (now Shaw Broadcast Services) service for Canadian cable television providers too distant to receive most over-the-air television signals. It continues to be carried on satellite television nationwide through Bell Satellite TV and Shaw Direct, as well as on several other cable systems across Canada outside Alberta, including in all of Newfoundland and Labrador and some areas of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Saskatchewan, British Columbia and the Yukon Territory.

From 1980 to 1982, the station&#x27;s studios were used for taping episodes of the Canadian sketch comedy &quot;SCTV&quot;; since the station itself was the focus of the storylines, CITV&#x27;s lobby and control room were often used for SCTV scenes. (The show had previously taped in Toronto at CIII-TV, Global&#x27;s flagship station, somewhat ironically.) CITV&#x27;s booth announcer, Robert Corness, also announced for &quot;SCTV&quot;, including later syndicated reruns distributed by Allarcom and WIC.

In 1987, the station launched a semi-satellite in Red Deer, Alberta, as part of a joint venture with Monarch Broadcasting (the owners of CKRD-TV). CITV-TV-1, VHF channel 10, broadcast ITV&#x27;s program schedule, with separate commercials for Red Deer and Central Alberta. The rebroadcaster, along with CKRD-TV, was purchased by Allarcom in 1989. Some programs produced at CKRD-TV&#x27;s studios were later added to CITV-TV-1&#x27;s schedule for Central Alberta viewers, such as the noon-hour program &quot;ITV Express&quot;, and the &quot;RDTV News Crew&quot; at 5:30 p.m.

In February 1991, Allarcom&#x27;s broadcast and cable assets, including CITV-TV, were purchased by WIC Western International Communications.

In July 2000, the CRTC approved the purchase of WIC&#x27;s broadcast television assets, including CITV-TV, by Canwest. CITV officially joined the Canwest-owned Global Television Network on September 4, 2000, along with fellow Alberta stations CICT in Calgary, CISA-TV in Lethbridge, and CKRD-TV Red Deer. The former WIC stations in Edmonton, Calgary, and Lethbridge had already carried Global&#x27;s programming, alongside WIC-sourced programming, since 1988.

The CRTC approved Canwest&#x27;s application to launch a transitional digital television transmitter, CITV-DT, on March 5, 2009. The transmitter launched on June 29, 2009, on UHF channel 47 (PSIP 13.1).

CITV-TV-1 was converted to a rebroadcaster of CITV-TV/DT in August 2009, relaying Global Edmonton&#x27;s program schedule and commercials without any variations; this coincided with the closure of CHCA-TV by Canwest.

On October 27, 2010, Canwest Global&#x27;s television assets, including CITV, were purchased by Shaw Communications. On August 22, 2011, the station completed its transition from analog to digital by moving CITV-DT from UHF channel 47 to VHF channel 13 and increasing its effective radiated power (its virtual channel remains at 13.1).

Corus Entertainment completed its purchase of Shaw Media, including CITV Edmonton, on April 1, 2016.

==News operation==
CITV presently broadcasts 45 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with seven hours each weekday and five hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). It currently airs the highest number of local newscast broadcast hours of any English-language television station in the Edmonton market.

The station was the first in the Edmonton market to have a news helicopter. The helicopter, called &quot;Global 1&quot;, is shared with radio station CHED for their traffic reports during the &quot;Morning News&quot; and the &quot;Early News&quot;. The helicopter is also used frequently for breaking news coverage.

On November 15, 2010, CITV became the first television station in Alberta to begin broadcasting its locally produced programming in high definition. On September 10, 2011, CITV-DT expanded its Saturday morning newscast to three hours. The following day, on September 11, the station debuted a two-hour Sunday morning newscast.

On August 27, 2012, CITV-DT expanded its weekday morning newscast to four hours, with the addition of a half-hour; in addition on September 2, 2012, the station expanded its Sunday morning newscast to three hours with an additional hour. The expansions to CITV&#x27;s morning news programming was part of a benefits package that was included as a condition of the sale of the Global Television Network to Shaw Communications.

In June 2024, Corus Entertainment enacted cuts in its news division, affecting weekend news programming at Global Edmonton and Global Calgary. As of August 10, 2024, both stations will continue to broadcast separate 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts for their respective markets; both sets of evening newscasts will utilize a shared on-air presenting team out of the Calgary studios using Global&#x27;s multi-market newscast production method that is used in other markets. It has also been announced that separate weekend morning newscasts for both stations will be done out of the Global Edmonton studios.

<doc id="567211" wikidata="Q1757301" url="?curid=567211" title="Submarine warfare">
<text>Submarine warfare is one of the four divisions of underwater warfare, the others being anti-submarine warfare, mine warfare and mine countermeasures.

Submarine warfare consists primarily of diesel and nuclear submarines using torpedoes, missiles or nuclear weapons, as well as advanced sensing equipment, to attack other submarines, ships, or land targets. Submarines may also be used for reconnaissance and landing of special forces as well as deterrence. In some navies they may be used for task force screening. The effectiveness of submarine warfare partly depends on the anti-submarine warfare carried out in response.

== American Revolution ==
The first attack by a submarine occurred on September 8, 1776, by the American submarine &quot;Turtle&quot; in an unsuccessful attack on the British warship &quot;Eagle.&quot;

==American Civil War==
The age of submarine warfare began during the American Civil War. The 1860s was a time of many turning points in terms of how naval warfare was fought. Many new types of warships were being developed for use in the United States and Confederate States Navies. Submarine watercraft were among the newly created vessels. The first sinking of an enemy ship by a submarine occurred on 17 February 1864, when the Confederate submarine , a privateer, sank the sloop in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. Shortly afterward, however, &quot;H. L. Hunley&quot; sank, with the loss of her entire crew of eight.

==World War I==

Submarine warfare in World War I was primarily a fight between German and Austro-Hungarian U-boats and merchant vessels bound for the United Kingdom, France, and Russia. British and Allied submarines conducted widespread operations in the Baltic, North, Mediterranean and Black Seas along with the Atlantic Ocean. Only a few actions occurred outside the wider European-Atlantic theatre.

The first round of major German submarine attacks on Allied merchant ships began in February 1915, but American civilian deaths, especially with the sinking of &quot;Lusitania&quot;, turned American public opinion against the Central Powers. The U.S. demanded it stop, and Germany conducted submarine attacks under prize rules from September 1915 to January 1917. Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff (1853–1919), chief of the admiralty staff, argued successfully in December 1916 to resume unrestricted attacks from February 1917 and thus starve the British. The German high command realized the resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare, now to include deliberate attacks on neutral shipping, meant war with the United States but calculated that American mobilization would be too slow to stop a German victory on the Western Front and played a large role in the United States entering the war in April 1917. Once naval convoys were implemented, sinkings did not reach the German Imperial Admiralty Staff&#x27;s optimistic projections.

The sinking of was the first combat victory of a modern submarine, and the exploits of , which sank three British cruisers in under an hour, established the submarine as an important new component of naval warfare. During World War I more than 5,000 Allied ships were sunk by U-boats.

German submarines were used to lay naval mines and to attack iron ore shipping in the Baltic. The British submarine flotilla in the Baltic operated in support of the Russians until the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. During the war, the British invested efforts into developing a submarine that could operate in conjunction with a battleship fleet – the &quot;Fleet Submarine&quot;. To achieve the necessary (surfaced) the K-class submarines were steam powered. In practice, the K class were a constant problem and could not operate effectively with a fleet.

==Interwar period==
Between the wars, navies experimented with submarine cruisers (France, ), submarines armed with battleship caliber guns (UK, ) and submarines capable of carrying small aircraft for reconnaissance ( and &quot;Surcouf&quot;).

Germany was denied submarines by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, but built some anyway. This was not legitimized until the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935, under which the UK accepted German parity in submarine numbers with the Royal Navy.

==World War II==
In World War II, submarine warfare was split into two main areas – the Atlantic and the Pacific. The Mediterranean Sea was also a very active area for submarine operations. This was particularly true for the British and French, as well as the Germans. The Italians were also involved, but achieved their greatest successes using midget submarines and human torpedoes.

===Atlantic Ocean===
In the Atlantic, where German submarines again sought out and attacked Allied convoys, this part of the war was very reminiscent of the latter part of World War I. Many British submarines were active as well, particularly in the Mediterranean and off Norway, against Axis warships, submarines and merchant shipping.

Initially, Hitler ordered his submarines to abide by the prize rules, but this restriction was withdrawn in December 1939. Although mass attacks by submarine had been carried out in World War I, the &quot;wolf pack&quot; was mainly a tactic of World War II U-boats. The main steps in this tactic were as follows:
* A number of U-boats were dispersed across possible paths of a convoy.
* A boat sighting a convoy would signal its course, speed and composition to German Naval Command.
* The submarine would continue to shadow the convoy, reporting any changes of course.
* The rest of the pack would then head to the first boat&#x27;s position.
* When the pack was formed, a coordinated attack would be made on the surface at night.
* At dawn, the pack would withdraw, leaving a shadower, and resume the attack at dusk.

With the later increase in warship and aircraft escorts, U-boat losses became unacceptable. Many boats were lost, and the earlier experienced commanders with them.

Almost 3,000 Allied ships (175 warships, 2,825 merchantmen) had been sunk by U-boats. Germany&#x27;s U-boat fleet suffered heavy casualties, losing 793 U-boats and about 28,000 submariners out of 41,000, a casualty rate of about 70%.

===Pacific Ocean===

In the Pacific, the situation was reversed, with US submarines hunting Japanese shipping. By war&#x27;s end, US submarines had destroyed over half of all Japanese merchant ships, totaling well over five million tons of shipping. British and Dutch submarines also took part in attacks on Japanese shipping, mostly in coastal waters. Japanese submarines were initially successful, destroying two US fleet aircraft carriers, a cruiser, and several other ships. However, following a doctrine that concentrated on attacking warships, rather than more-vulnerable merchantmen, the smaller Japanese fleet proved ineffectual in the long term, while suffering heavy losses to Allied anti-submarine measures. Italian submarines and one German submarine operated in the Pacific Ocean, but never enough to be an important factor, inhibited by distance and difficult relations with their Japanese ally.

===Other areas===

====Mediterranean Sea====
====Indian Ocean====

Japanese submarines operated in the Indian Ocean, forcing the British surface fleet to withdraw to the east coast of Africa. Some German and Italian submarines operated in the Indian Ocean, but never enough to play a significant role.

==Post-World War II==

Since the Second World War, several wars, such as the Korean War, Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 and the Falklands War, have involved limited use of submarines. Later submarine-launched land-attack missiles were employed against Iraq and Afghanistan. With these exceptions, submarine warfare ceased after 1945. Hence strategic thinking about the role of submarines has developed independently of actual experience.

The advent of the nuclear-powered submarine in the 1950s brought about a major change in strategic thinking about submarine warfare. These boats could operate faster, deeper and had much longer endurance. Their larger sizes also allowed them to become missile launching platforms. Nuclear power would allow submarines to have greater accuracy and the ability to use torpedoes against ships, other submarines, and land targets. In response to this the attack submarine became more important, particularly in regard to its postulated role as a hunter-killer. The US also used nuclear submarines as radar pickets for a while. There have also been major advances in sensors and weapons.

During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union played what was described as a &#x27;cat-and-mouse&#x27; game of detecting and even trailing enemy submarines.

As the likelihood of unrestricted submarine warfare has diminished, thinking about conventional submarines has focused on their use against surface warships. The mere existence of a submarine may curtail surface warships&#x27; freedom to operate. To counter the threat of these submarines, hunter submarines were developed in turn. The role of the submarine has extended with the use of submarine-launched autonomous unmanned vehicles. The development of new air independent propulsion methods has meant that the diesel-electric submarine&#x27;s need to surface, making it vulnerable, has been reduced. Nuclear submarines, although far larger, could generate their own air and water for an extended duration, meaning their need to surface was limited in any case.

In today&#x27;s more fractured geopolitical system, many nations are building and/or upgrading their submarines. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force has launched new models of submarines every few years; South Korea has upgraded the already capable Type 209() design from Germany and sold copies to Indonesia. Russia has improved the old Soviet Kilo model into what strategic analysts are calling equivalent to the 1980s-era , and so on.

At the end of his naval warfare book &quot;The Price of Admiralty&quot;, military historian John Keegan postulates that eventually, almost all roles of surface warships will be taken over by submarines, as they will be the only naval units capable of evading the increasing intelligence capabilities (space satellites, airplanes etc.) that a fight between evenly matched modern states could bring to bear on them.

However, thinking about importance of the submarine has shifted to an even more strategic role, with the advent of the nuclear ballistic missile submarine carrying Submarine-launched ballistic missiles with nuclear weapons to provide second strike capability.

==Modern submarine missions==
A modern submarine is a multi-role platform. It can conduct both overt and covert operations. In peacetime it can act as a deterrent as well as for surveillance operations and information gathering.

In wartime a submarine can carry out a number of missions including:
* Surveillance and information gathering
* Communication of data
* Landing of special operations forces
* Attack of land targets (first cruise missile fired from sub, Gulf War, , Jan 1991)
* Protection of task forces and merchant shipping
* Denial of sea areas to an enemy

<doc id="567213" wikidata="Q2626471" url="?curid=567213" title="TAMSK">
<text>TAMSK is a two-player board game designed by Kris Burm. It was originally published in 1998 as the second game in the &quot;GIPF&quot; Project series of abstract strategy games, although it was later dropped from the series in favor of TZAAR. Players move sand hourglass timers and drop plastic rings around spaces on a hexagonal board in an attempt to limit their opponent&#x27;s moves. Each player starts the game with 32 rings, and the player with the fewest remaining rings at the end of the game is the winner. The game is unique among the &quot;GIPF&quot; Project games in having time as a central game component, and the manner in which time is used is possibly unique among board games in general.

==Rules==
===Equipment===
The game board is a regular hexagon with four spaces on a side and a triangular grid with 37 playable sockets; the &quot;GIPF project&quot; games all share the triangular grid and six-sided boards.

In addition to the board, the playing equipment includes:
* 6 hourglass sand timers (3-minute), 3 in each color (black and red)
* 1 neutral hourglass timer (15-second)
* 64 identical rings, half distributed to each player
* 2 ring holders (each holds 32 rings)

The board includes sockets at each playable point that will hold an hourglass upright. The 18 sockets on the outer edge of the board has a depth that is high enough to accommodate one surrounding ring. The next rank to the inside has 12 sockets two rings high; the next rank closer to the center has 6 sockets three rings high, and the single central socket is four rings high.

===Objective===
Each player starts with 32 rings, and the objective is to discard as many rings as possible, so the winner is the player with the fewest remaining rings when the game ends. The game ends when neither player can make any more moves.

===Gameplay===

To start the game, the six hourglasses must all have their upper chambers empty (e.g., sand is not running in any hourglass) and these are placed on the corners of the board in an alternating fashion by color.

Each player&#x27;s turn consists of &quot;moving&quot; a timer of their color, then &quot;dropping&quot; a ring around the space to which it moved. Red takes the first turn.

===Moving===
A timer may be moved to an unoccupied, &quot;unfilled&quot; socket adjacent to its origin. The timer may not be moved to any sockets that have been &quot;filled&quot; with rings, which means the surrounding stack of rings are equal to the height of that socket. If the player moves to a &quot;filled&quot; socket, that player immediately loses the game.

When a player is unable to make a move, that player may pass on their turn until they can move again or until the game ends.

===Dropping===
After moving the timer, a ring may be dropped around the destination socket only (not the originating socket). If the player neglects to drop a ring around the destination, the opposing player may drop a ring around the destination socket, then proceed with their own turn. A socket is &quot;full&quot; when the height of the stack of rings surrounding that socket is equal to the height of the socket.

===Example===

Consider the illustrated example of a four-turn opening sequence:
# Red moves the hourglass at D1 to D2 and drops a ring
# Black moves an hourglass at G1 to F1 and drops a ring; the space at F1 is blocked because a single ring is sufficient to fill the perimeter sockets.
# Red continues to move the same hourglass and drops a ring at the destination E2. None of the 
# From F1, Black could move to F2, G1, or E1. Black is blocked from moving to E2 because a Red hourglass occupies that socket; moving to E1 instead blocks that socket by filling it with a ring.

As this sequence continues, if Black visits D2, or Red backtracks to D2, the second ring dropped on that spot will fill that socket. The board will continue to shrink as sockets get filled.

===Variations===
Under the most elementary version of the game, which is known as &quot;Level 1&quot;, the timer mechanic is not used and the hourglasses are never turned over.

As an intermediate version, &quot;Level 2&quot; requires both players to each move three different hourglasses for the first three turns. After the timers have been moved during each of these turns, the hourglass must be turned over, so that after both players have taken three turns, all six hourglasses are running. With each successive turn, the hourglass is turned over again, reversing the flow of sand. If an hourglass stops running, it remains on the board but cannot make any more moves. The objective in &quot;Level 2&quot; is the same (fewest remaining rings wins) but a tiebreaker mechanic is added: when there are an equal number of rings remaining, the player who is able to keep the last hourglass &quot;alive&quot; with running sand is the winner; to determine the winner, first remove the stopped hourglasses from the board, then remove and line up the remaining running hourglasses. The hourglass that stops last will determine the winner.

The advanced &quot;Level 3&quot; version introduces a 15-second move timer mechanic.
# Use of the 15-second timer is optional; it does not have to be used.
# Either player may use the 15-second timer during their opponent&#x27;s move to force the opponent to complete their move or face a penalty.
# The 15-second timer can only be turned over when the upper chamber is completely empty; a player may have to wait before using it.
# Turns started before the 15-second timer runs out can be completed (including dropping a ring at the destination), but if the 15-second timer has expired before the turn is completed, the opponent is allowed to drop two rings on the next turn as a penalty. The first ring drops at the destination, and the second ring can be dropped on any space that is not &quot;full&quot; of rings, whether occupied by an hourglass or not.
# If the turn has not started before the 15-second timer has run out, the penalty does not apply, but the player who did not start their turn forfeits that turn.

==Strategy==
A timer must have sand running through it in order to be moved, and when it is moved, it is also turned over. Thus, rather than giving a set amount of time in which to make a move, each player&#x27;s set of 3 timers all have variable amounts of time remaining in which they can be moved, and that time changes whenever a move is made. At any point during the game, it may be beneficial to delay moving or to move as quickly as possible, and an opponent can use another timer to force a move if it is in their interest. Timers that have run out cannot be moved for the remainder of the game.

Each move increasingly restricts the usable playing area of the board (a mechanic it shares with its companion games, &quot;ZÈRTZ&quot; and &quot;DVONN&quot;), which means &quot;TAMSK&quot; games move toward an inevitable conclusion in a reasonable amount of time.

==History==
&quot;TAMSK&quot; has had fewer critical plaudits than other games in the &quot;GIPF&quot; project, and its elaborate production has meant a significantly higher retail cost, but it generated enough demand and kudos to justify a second print run.

With the 2006 release of the third set of GIPF potentials, Kris Burm announced that the &quot;GIPF project&quot; was complete, but he changed his plans in 2007 with the release of &quot;TZAAR&quot;, which replaced TAMSK as part of the GIPF series. Therefore, TAMSK is no longer on the market.

<text>Sparwood is a district municipality in the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is the second-largest community on the Elk River.

Located approximately 30 kilometres from Fernie, the District Municipality of Sparwood has approximately 4,200 residents. Sparwood is quite large for its population, taking up an area of 191.01 square kilometres and incorporating the local coal mines.

In the late 1800s, there was a railroad stop known as Sparwood, which was so named because of the trees from this area being shipped to the coast for manufacturing spars for ocean vessels.

==Economy==
The local economy is heavily dependent on steel-making coal mining, one of British Columbia&#x27;s primary industries. A large part of the population either works in the mines or as tradespeople and labourers in related support industries, such as trucking or as mechanics. Logging is another important industry.

Sparwood/Elk Valley Airport is the local airport for general aviation. The closest airport with commercial service is Cranbrook/Canadian Rockies International Airport. Road access is provided by the Crowsnest Highway.

Sparwood was formed on 12 May 1966 accepting people from the nearby towns of Michel, Natal, and Middletown (an urban renewal). Since the beginning of Sparwood, it has experienced many ups and downs in coal mining, the town&#x27;s primary industry.

==Attractions==
Sparwood promotes itself extensively as the home of the Terex Titan, at one time the largest truck in the world. The green Titan, in service at Sparwood between 1978 and 1991, stands a few yards from the Crowsnest Highway where it can attract the attention of tourists and travellers. The adjacent tourist information centre serves visitors to the district municipality and the wider area.

Sparwood is distinguished by mural art which depicts something of the history of the former Michel-Natal mining communities.

==Sports==
Sparwood is home to the 2011 B.C. provincial champion boys snowboarding team. Sparwood is also home to the 2011 Junior Boys and 2012 Junior Girls Provincial Bowling champions.

Laurie Hockridge of Sparwood and Lethbridge College, is a CCAA-ACSC Hall of Fame inductee (WBB, &#x27;87–90). Her legacy includes back-to-back national championships and two national championship MVP trophies.

===Fernie Memorial Arena disaster===
On 17 October 2017 an ammonia leak at the Fernie Memorial Arena killed three workers (two City of Fernie employees and one CIMCO refrigeration employee from Calgary) during the Fernie Ghostriders&#x27; regular season. Because of this tragedy, the City of Fernie declared a state of emergency and people had to evacuate the area for days. The &#x27;Riders were relocated because of this to the Elk Valley Leisure Centre in Sparwood during the 2017–18 KIJHL season until the City of Fernie installed a new chiller unit. The Ghostriders now play at their home rink again.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Sparwood had a population of 3,990 living in 1,815 of its 2,101 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 3,646. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

=== Ethnicity ===
=== Religion ===
According to the 2021 census, religious groups in Sparwood included:
*Irreligion (2,405 persons or 58.0%)
*Christianity (1,695 persons or 40.8%)
*Islam (15 persons or 0.4%)

==Education==
There are two public schools in Sparwood; Frank J Mitchell which is an Elementary School and the new Sparwood Secondary School.
These schools are operated by School District 5 Southeast Kootenay which is based in Cranbrook.

==Climate==
Sparwood has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with relatively cold and very snowy winters combined with moderately warm summers with relatively high diurnal temperature variation. As a result of the low overnight lows in summer, September&#x27;s mean of places Sparwood just above subarctic climates (Dfc) in classification.

<doc id="567250" wikidata="Q3506917" url="?curid=567250" title="Catholic Church in Sweden">
<text>The Catholic Church in Sweden is part of the worldwide Catholic Church in communion with the Pope in Rome. It was established by Archbishop Ansgar in Birka in 829, and further developed by the Christianization of Sweden in the 9th century. King Olof Skötkonung (ca. 970–1021) is considered the first Christian king of Sweden.

In the Middle Ages, continental culture, philosophy and science spread to Sweden through the Catholic Church, which also founded schools, Uppsala University, hospitals as well as monasteries and convents. Several church representatives also became significant actors outside the religious sphere.

The Reformation in Sweden began in 1527 when King Gustav Vasa and his Riksdag of Västerås broke the full communion of the Swedish church with Rome, making it politically subservient to the kingdom. Controversies about the state of Catholicism in the Swedish church endured until the reigns of King John III (1568–1592) and the Catholic King Sigismund of Poland and Sweden (1592–1599).

At the Uppsala Synod in 1593, under the influence of Duke and future King Charles IX of Sweden, the Swedish church finally became a Lutheran state church, ratified by Charles&#x27; victory in his war against his Catholic predecessor in 1599. Governmental anti-Catholicism was imposed in Sweden, including deportations and death penalties for Catholics from 1599 to 1781.

Limited visits of individual foreign Catholics in Sweden were decriminalised through the Tolerance Act, imposed in 1781 by King Gustav III of Sweden. The conversion of Swedish citizens to the Catholic Church was decriminalized in 1860. In 1951, Swedish citizens were allowed to exit from the Lutheran Church of Sweden. In 1977, the last legislative ban on Catholic convents in Sweden was abolished. Still, however, according to the Act of Succession of the Swedish throne, only Lutheran legitimate descendants brought up in Sweden are presently entitled to succeed as monarch and the thus head of state of Sweden.

Since 1953, the Catholic Church in Sweden has been formally represented by the Diocese of Stockholm, covering the whole country, estimating some 106,873 registered members (2013), with unofficial estimates of about 150,000 Catholics in the country in total. Most of them have an immigrant background, while others are native Swede converts.
On 21 May 2017, Pope Francis named Bishop Anders Arborelius, the Ordinary of Stockholm, a Cardinal, a first for the Catholic Church in Sweden.

When the Swedish state gave &quot;registered denominations&quot; legal status in 2000, and the associations that had until that point organised the Catholic Church in Sweden became defunct, the church lost the right to the ordinary name. The administration of the diocese took it for granted that the name was the Catholic Church, that they had never applied to legally patent the name. Several smaller denominations, among them the Liberal Catholic Church, and the Old Catholic Church, opposed it calling itself the &quot;Catholic Church&quot;. The solution was similar to the United Kingdom, where &quot;Roman Catholic&quot; has long been used to disambiguate from the high church movement of the Anglican Church that refer to themselves as &quot;Anglo-Catholics&quot;. The church is therefore now registered under Swedish law as the &quot;Roman Catholic Church&quot; (Swedish: &quot;Romersk-katolska kyrkan&quot;).

== History ==
The Catholic Church was the established church of Sweden from the Middle Ages until the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, when King Gustav I severed relations with Rome. The Church of Sweden became Lutheran at the Uppsala Synod in 1593 when it adopted the Augsburg Confession to which most Lutherans adhere.

In 1654, Christina, Queen of Sweden caused much scandal when she abdicated her throne to convert to Catholicism. She is one of the few women buried in the Vatican grotto.

In the 1770s, the prominent Liberal Anders Chydenius - himself a Lutheran priest - prevailed upon King Gustav III to legalise the immigration of Catholics (as well as Jews) into Sweden. However, the Lutheran Church remained the only legal church in Sweden until the middle of the 19th century, when other churches were allowed. The Lutheran Church remained a state church until 2000.

=== First Nordic Missions (circa 829-1104) ===
When Emperor Louis the Pious was visited in 829 by two envoyés of the Swedish king, who messaged that several in their homeland were willing to convert to the Christian faith, he appointed Archbishop Ansgar for the mission. Ansgar and his assistant, the monk Witmar, followed with a convoy of merchants, but halfway they were attacked by vikings, and had to reach Birka on foot.

Archbishop Ansgar, sometimes called the &quot;Apostle of the North&quot;, arrived in the town of Birka on an island in Lake Mälaren in 829 from the Archbishopric of Bremen, and founded ostensibly the first Christian parish in Sweden. Members included Herigar, evidently the first documented Christian Swede. However, findings from a Christian graveyard at Varnhem, dated to the 9th century, indicate that Christianity may have arrived before Ansgar. In addition, it is not unlikely that Christian slaves and other foreigners inhabited Sweden before that time.

The Swedish king at this time was Björn, according to &quot;Vita Ansgari&quot;, possibly Björn at Haugi.

Thereafter, Christianity slowly grew in Sweden from the 9th century until the late 11th century by people who came in contact with Christianity in other countries, and through missionaries from the Holy Roman Empire and England.

Götaland seems to have been Christianized before Svealand.

The first significant sign that Christianity had been established on a larger scale was the baptism of King Olof Skötkonungs circa 1008. 
According to Adam of Bremen, Olof Skötkonung was granted an ultimatum at the ting in Uppsala: if he respected the faith of the pagan Nordic mythology and the blót rituals at the Temple of Uppsala, he got to choose one county to have as Christian. He chose Västergötland, and in cooperation with the Archbishopric of Bremen, which was responsible for Apostolic Vicariate of the Nordic Missions, the Diocese of Skara was established, with first bishop appointed in 1014: Thurgot of Skara (dead circa 1030).

=== Ecclesiastical province of Lund (1104–1164) ===
In a Papal document from 1120, Skara was mentioned, &quot;Liunga kaupinga&quot; (Linköping), Tuna (Eskilstuna), Strängnäs, Sigtuna, and Arosa (Västerås or possibly Östra Aros/Uppsala), all as episcopal sees. Later in the 12th century, also Växjö and Åbo. Furthermore, Sigtuna was moved to Uppsala. The dioceses were from 1104 subject to the Archdiocese of Lund, which was then Danish.

During the 12th and 13th centuries, several religious orders were established throughout Sweden. Alvastra, Nydala and Varnhem abbeys were founded by the Cistercians. The Dominicans and the Franciscans opened convents in among other places Visby and Skara.

=== Ecclesiastical province of Uppsala (1164–1557) ===

In 1164, Sweden was granted its own ecclesiastical province, with a proper archbishop seated in Uppsala. However, the ecclesiastical province of Sweden would still remain formally subject to Lund until the Protestant Reformation.

The most important figure of the church in Sweden during the 14th century was Bridget of Sweden. Her apparitions gained much renown both spiritually and politically throughout Europe. She managed to have the pope recognise the establishment of the Bridgettines order, and a convent was founded, Vadstena Abbey.

The Middle Ages also gave the Catholic Church in Sweden several saints. A few of them are still celebrated in the Catholic Church in Sweden today. Some of them are, besides Bridget, are Sigfrid of Sweden, and Helena of Skövde, but there were also local cults of for instance Catherine of Vadstena, Nils Hermansson, Ingrid of Skänninge, and Brynolf of Skara. See also: List of Swedish saints.

=== Protestant Reformation (16th century)===

During the 16th century, King Gustav Vasa broke the relations with the pope, as did several northern European monarchies. The process had its background in the reformers&#x27; criticism of Catholicism, but it was also due to a larger societal context, including attempts to foster a centralised military state under more powerful royal control.

Thus, the break with the Catholic Church and parts of its teachings, was due part to political/economical reasons, part to the theological reformation. Regarding the first, the conflict stood primarily at the Riksdag of Västerås in 1527, and the break with the pope through the abolition of the Canon law in 1536 under King Gustav Vasa.

However, these changes didn&#x27;t mean that there were no more Catholics in Sweden during the 16th century. Naturally, there were plenty who during and after the Protestant Reformation didn&#x27;t swap their loyalties so easy, yet didn&#x27;t wish to leave the country. Throughout the modern era, immigrants arrived from Catholic countries who only reluctantly made superficial professions of Lutheranism, although some might have been described as crypto-Catholics.

Catholic authorities sent representatives illegally into the country and educated Swedes to become Catholic prelates outside of Sweden, despite that they could not legally return.

Exceptions from the Reformations occurred. The reigns of King John III and his son King Sigismund and the Swedish–Polish Union 1594–1599.

King John III attempted to ease the breach. He invited a Norwegian Jesuit, Laurentius Nicolai, who was active in Sweden 1576–1580. Later, two more Jesuits arrived who were active at the Collegium regium Stockholmense college on Riddarholmen in Stockholm. John III participated in Catholic eucharist and had extensive dialogue with the Holy See in Rome of having the Swedes returning to Catholicism, but these attempts were stranded. Nonetheless, his daughter married as Catholic.

After the Reformation, it took a long time for the Catholic Church to return to Sweden. Catholic clergy was present at some Catholic embassies, but their influence remained limited for obvious reasons; Sweden had Catholicism criminalised.

==== Uppsala Synod 1593 ====

After the death of King John III in 1592, Duke Charles was appointed acting regent (Swedish: &quot;riksföreståndare&quot;). At the same time, the ideas of the Reformation were recognised along with the establishment of a national church in Sweden during the Uppsala Synod in 1593. At this point, the breach with the papacy was finally ratified. At this time in Sweden, politics was religion, and religion was politics, why the decision could be perceived as a provocative stance by the throne pretendent Duke against future King Sigismund and his supporters, which would eventually result in the War against Sigismund.

=== King Sigismund and the Swedish–Polish Union 1592–1599 ===
Due to the throne ascension of King Sigismund III and the establishment of the Swedish–Polish Union 1594-1599, the Protestant Reformation was halted, and religious freedom allowed. At this period, yet again Catholics were appointed to public offices and exiled Catholics were granted return or settlement.

=== Legally enforced anticatholicism 1599–1781 ===
Subsequent to Duke Charles victory in his War against Sigismund 1599, all Catholics were banned and exiled, enforced by death penalty.

After the death of King Charles IX in 1611, some legal suspensions were offered for ambassadors from Catholic countries and their relatives for them to live their faith, as for a few merchants and mercenaries. Now, immigrants from Catholic countries illegally partook in liturgies at the embassies. However, with the Riksdag of 1617, the rules were further restricted.

Yet, for Swedish Catholics, the death penalty was still imposed. For instance, in 1624, the Mayor Zackarias Anthelius and the royal secretary, Göran Bähr, both received the death penalty for converting to Roman Catholicism. 

King Gustavus Adolphus&#x27; daughter and successor Queen Christina had Catholic clergy invited to her court. She abdicated from the throne and converted to the Catholic faith.

In the 1670s, Father Johannes Sterck, a Jesuit, was active in Sweden. He was originally a legation priest, but when the ambassador he served died, he stayed and initiated a mission instead. He was eventually sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted and he was exiled.

In the 1720s, Catholic textile workers arrived, primarily from the Holy Roman Empire; these were granted limited freedom of religion. Their visits to the legation chapels were accepted behind closed doors in order to celebrate mass, and in this way these chapels evolved into small parishes. From this time, Catholics were termed &quot;foreign religious adherents&quot;.

At this time, Catholics in Sweden were formally represented by the Apostolic Vicariate of the Nordic Missions.

=== Apostolic Vicariate in Sweden (1783–1953)===

In 1781, King Gustav III imposed the Tolerance Act in Sweden, which gave foreign Catholics that had moved to Sweden the right to build churches and educate their issue in the Catholic tradition. First, an Apostolic prefecture was created, and in 1783 Pope Pius VI appointed a French priest, Father Nicolaus Oster, as apostolic vicar in Sweden, . However, it would last some 100 years till before Swedish conversions became decriminalised.

In 1784, a Catholic parish was formally founded in Stockholm. The members lacked suitable premises, however. Therefore, until 1837, Stockholm&#x27;s Catholics celebrated mass in the Freemasons hall inside the building of today&#x27;s Stockholm City Museum, which they were offered to rent for the purposes.

After King Oscar I married a Catholic Princess, Josephine of Leuchtenberg, the restrictions against the Catholic Church in Sweden were further eased. The Queen brought with her a chaplain, Dr Jakobus Laurentius Studach. He was a consecrated bishop and became the new apostolic vicar for Sweden. At this time also the Chapel of Eugenia was erected at Norrmalm, which stood finished in 1837, but was demolished during the Redevelopment of Norrmalm in the 1960s.

Since 1873 it has been legal also for Sweden citizens to adhere to the Catholic Church without risking death penalty or exile. Civil rights were still restricted, however. Until 1951 it was forbidden for Catholics to become Members of Parliament, teachers, physicians, or nurses.

Dr. Albert Bitter was appointed apostolic vicar in 1893. In 1899 only some 2,500 Catholics in Sweden were registered. Catholic church buildings existed in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö and Gävle. The psalm book &quot;Cecilia&quot; was published in 1902. In 1920, the first edition of the news and cultural magazine &quot;Credo&quot; was released, today known as &quot;&quot;.

During and after World War II, the Catholic population increased due to refugees and immigrants. In 1946, the Catholic aid organisation Caritas Sweden was established to provide help for refugees both in Sweden and in the rest of Europe.

29 June 1953, Pope Pius XII established the Diocese of Stockholm. Sweden was no longer considered a missionary region, but enjoyed a more independent status. The same year, the Church of St. Eric was granted the status of cathedral. The first diocesan bishop was the former apostolic vicar Johannes Erik Müller, born in Bavaria. He was succeeded by Bishop Ansgar Nelson, a Benedictine monk, Bishop John Taylor, Oblates, and Bishop Hubertus Brandenburg, along with assistant bishop William Kenney.

==Diocese of Stockholm (since 1953)==
The Diocese of Stockholm, founded in 1953, covers all of Sweden&#x27;s territory, has more than 100,000 members and is one of Sweden&#x27;s largest religious denominations. In 1998, the Catholic Church in Sweden got its first Swedish bishop since the Protestant Reformation, Anders Arborelius. The cathedral of the diocese is the Cathedral of Saint Eric, located in Södermalm in Stockholm. Its parish has about 8,500 members.

Catholic priests are educated in Uppsala, with academic studies offered by the Newman Institute (Uppsala). A part of the studies may be pursued at the Pontifical universities in Rome. The education typically lasts a total of seven years, covering studies in philosophy, theology, pastoral practical work, as well as spiritual and liturgical instruction.

In 1934, the official youth association of the diocese was founded, Sveriges Unga Katoliker.

The central administration of the diocese maintains offices in Södermalm, in the real estate that was acquired in 1857. Furthermore, a Catholic school was founded at Nytorget in Södermalm in 1795. In 1859, the school moved to the diocese offices. In 1967 it moved to Enskede.

<doc id="567253" wikidata="Q44617" url="?curid=567253" title="Coracias">
<text>Coracias is a genus of the rollers, an Old World family of near passerine birds related to the kingfishers and bee-eaters. They share the colourful appearance of those groups, blues and browns predominating. The two outer front toes are connected, but not the inner one.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Coracias&quot; was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;korakías&quot; (), derived from &quot;korax&quot; (, ‘raven, crow’). Aristotle described the &quot;coracias&quot; as a bird as big as a crow with a red beak, which some believe to be the chough. The type species was designated as the European roller (&quot;Coracias garrulus&quot;) by George Robert Gray in 1855.
===Species===
Nine species are recognized:







===Former species===
Formerly, some authorities also considered the following species (or subspecies) as species within the genus &quot;Coracias&quot;:
* Olive-backed oriole (as &quot;Coracias sagittata&quot;)
* Eurasian golden oriole (as &quot;Coracias oriolus&quot;)
* Black-hooded oriole (as &quot;Coracias xanthornus&quot;)
* Broad-billed roller (as &quot;Coracias glaucurus&quot;)
* Broad-billed roller (afer) (as &quot;Coracias afra&quot;)
* Oriental dollarbird (as &quot;Coracias orientalis&quot;)
* Australian roller (as &quot;Coracias pacifica&quot;)

==Behaviour and ecology==
&quot;Coracias&quot; rollers are watch-and wait hunters. They sit in a tree or on a post before descending on their prey and carrying it back in the beak to a perch before dismembering it. A wide range of terrestrial invertebrates, and small vertebrates such as frogs, lizards rodents and young birds, are taken. Their prey includes items avoided by many other birds, such as hairy caterpillars, insects with warning colouration and snakes. They often perch prominently whilst hunting, like giant shrikes.

<doc id="567269" wikidata="Q239657" url="?curid=567269" title="Shirley Chisholm">
<text>Shirley Anita Chisholm ( ; ; November 30, 1924 – January 1, 2005) was an American politician who, in 1968, became the first black woman to be elected to the United States Congress. Chisholm represented New York&#x27;s 12th congressional district, a district centered in Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn for seven terms from 1969 to 1983. In 1972, she became the first black candidate for a major-party nomination for President of the United States and the first woman to run for the Democratic Party&#x27;s presidential nomination. Throughout her career, she was known for taking &quot;a resolute stand against economic, social, and political injustices&quot;, as well as being a strong supporter of black civil rights and women&#x27;s rights.

Born in Brooklyn, New York, she spent ages five through nine in Barbados, and she always considered herself a Barbadian American. She excelled at school and earned her college degree in the United States. She started working in early-childhood education, and she became involved in local Democratic Party politics in the 1950s. In 1964, overcoming some resistance because she was a woman, she was elected to the New York State Assembly. Four years later, she was elected to Congress, where she led the expansion of food and nutrition programs for the poor and rose to party leadership. She retired from Congress in 1983 and taught at Mount Holyoke College while continuing her political organizing. Although nominated for the ambassadorship to Jamaica in 1993, health issues caused her to withdraw. In 2015, Chisholm was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

==Early life and education==
Shirley Anita St. Hill was born to immigrant parents on November 30, 1924, in Brooklyn, New York City. She was of Afro-Guyanese and Afro-Barbadian descent. She had three younger sisters, two born within three years of her and one later. Her father, Charles Christopher St. Hill, was born in British Guiana before moving to Barbados. He arrived in New York City via Antilla, Cuba, in 1923. Her mother, Ruby Seale, was born in Christ Church, Barbados and arrived in New York City in 1921.

Charles St. Hill was a laborer who worked in a factory that made burlap bags and as a baker&#x27;s helper. Ruby St. Hill was a skilled seamstress and domestic worker who experienced the difficulty of working outside the home while simultaneously raising her children. As a consequence, in November 1929, when Shirley turned five, she and her two sisters were sent to Barbados on the MS &quot;Vulcania&quot; to live with their maternal grandmother, Emaline Seale. Shirley later said, &quot;Granny gave me strength, dignity, and love. I learned from an early age that I was somebody. I didn&#x27;t need the black revolution to teach me that.&quot; Shirley and her sisters lived on their grandmother&#x27;s farm in the Vauxhall village in Christ Church, where Shirley attended a one-room schoolhouse. She returned to the United States in 1934, arriving in New York on May 19 aboard the SS &quot;Nerissa&quot;. As a result of her time in Barbados, Shirley spoke with a West Indian accent throughout her life. In her 1970 autobiography, &quot;Unbought and Unbossed&quot;, she wrote: &quot;Years later I would know what an important gift my parents had given me by seeing to it that I had my early education in the strict, traditional, British-style schools of Barbados. If I speak and write easily now, that early education is the main reason.&quot; In addition, she belonged to the Quaker Brethren sect found in the West Indies, and religion became important to her; however, later in life, she attended services in a Methodist church. As a result of her time on the island, and despite her U.S. birth, she always would consider herself a Barbadian American.

Beginning in 1939, she attended Girls&#x27; High School in the Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, a highly regarded, integrated school that attracted girls from throughout Brooklyn. She did well academically at Girls&#x27; High and was chosen to be vice president of the Junior Arista honor society. She was accepted at and offered scholarships to Vassar College and Oberlin College, but the family could not afford the room-and-board costs to go to either school; instead, she selected Brooklyn College, where there was no charge for tuition and she could live at home and commute to the school.

She earned her Bachelor of Arts from Brooklyn College in 1946, majoring in sociology and minoring in Spanish (a language that she would employ at times during her political career). She won prizes for her debating skills and graduated &quot;cum laude&quot;. During her time at Brooklyn College, she was a member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority and the Harriet Tubman Society. As a member of the Harriet Tubman Society, she advocated for inclusion (specifically in terms of the integration of black soldiers in the military during World War II), the addition of courses that focused on African-American history and the involvement of more women in the student government. However, this was not her first introduction to activism or politics. Growing up, she was surrounded by politics, as her father was an avid supporter of Marcus Garvey&#x27;s and a dedicated supporter of the rights of trade union members. She saw her community advocate for its rights as she witnessed the Barbados workers&#x27; and anti-colonial independence movements.

She met Conrad O. Chisholm in the late 1940s. He had migrated to the United States from Jamaica in 1946, and he later became a private investigator who specialized in negligence-based lawsuits. They married in 1949 in a large West Indian-style wedding. She subsequently suffered two miscarriages, and, to their disappointment, the couple would have no children; although, in the view of scholar Julie Gallagher, it is possible that her career goals played a role in this outcome as well.

After graduating from college, Chisholm began working as a teacher&#x27;s aide at the Mt. Calvary Child Care Center in Harlem. She would work at the center in a teaching role from 1946 to 1953. Meanwhile, she was furthering her education, attending classes at night and earning her Master of Arts in childhood education from Teachers College of Columbia University in 1951.

==Early career==
From 1953 to 1954, she was director of the Friend in Need Nursery, located in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and then, from 1954 to 1959, she was director of the Hamilton-Madison Child Care Center, located in Lower Manhattan. At the latter, there were 130 children between the ages of three and seven, and 24 employees reported to her. From 1959 to 1964, she was an educational consultant for the Division of Day Care in New York City&#x27;s Bureau of Child Welfare. There, she was in charge of supervising ten day-care centers as well as starting up new ones. She became an authority on early education and child-welfare issues.

Chisholm entered the world of politics in 1953, when she joined Wesley &quot;Mac&quot; Holder&#x27;s effort to elect Lewis Flagg Jr. to the bench as the first black judge in Brooklyn. The Flagg election group later transformed into the Bedford–Stuyvesant Political League (BSPL). The BSPL pushed candidates to support civil rights, fought against racial discrimination in housing, and sought to improve economic opportunities and services in Brooklyn. Chisholm eventually left the group around 1958 after clashing with Holder over Chisholm&#x27;s push to give female members of the group more input in decision-making.

She also worked as a volunteer for white-dominated political clubs in Brooklyn, like the Brooklyn Democratic Clubs and the League of Women Voters. With the Political League, she was part of a committee that chose the recipient of its annual Brotherhood Award. She also was a representative of the Brooklyn branch of the National Association of College Women. Furthermore, within the political organizations that she joined, Chisholm sought to make meaningful changes to the structure and make-up of the organizations, specifically the Brooklyn Democratic Clubs, which resulted in her being able to recruit more people of color into the 17th District Club and, thus, local politics.

In 1960, Chisholm joined a new organization, the Unity Democratic Club (UDC), led by former Flagg campaign member Thomas R. Jones. The UDC&#x27;s membership was mostly middle class, racially integrated, and included women in leadership positions. Chisholm campaigned for Jones, who lost the election for an assembly seat in 1960, but ran again two years later and won, becoming Brooklyn&#x27;s second black assemblyman.

==State legislator==
After Jones accepted a judicial appointment rather than seek reelection, Chisholm sought to run for his seat in the New York state assembly in 1964. Chisholm faced resistance based on her sex, with the UDC hesitant to support a female candidate. Chisholm chose to appeal directly to women, including using her role as Brooklyn branch president of Key Women of America to mobilize female voters. Chisholm won the Democratic primary in June 1964. She then won the seat in December with over 18,000 votes over Republican and Liberal Party candidates, neither of whom received more than 1,900 votes.

Chisholm was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1965 to 1968, sitting in the 175th, 176th and 177th New York State Legislatures. By May 1965, she had already been honored in a &quot;Salute to Women Doers&quot; affair in New York. One of her early activities in the Assembly was to argue against the state&#x27;s literacy test requiring English, holding that just because a person &quot;functions better in his native language is no sign a person is illiterate&quot;. By early 1966, she was a leader in a push by the statewide Council of Elected Negro Democrats for black representation on key committees in the Assembly.

Her successes in the legislature included getting unemployment benefits extended to domestic workers. She also sponsored the introduction of a SEEK program (Search for Education, Elevation and Knowledge) to the state, which provided disadvantaged students with the chance to enter college while receiving intensive remedial education.

In August 1968, she was elected as the Democratic National Committeewoman from New York State.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Initial election===
In 1968, Chisholm ran for the U.S. House of Representatives from New York&#x27;s 12th congressional district, which, as part of a court-mandated reapportionment plan, had been significantly redrawn to focus on Bedford–Stuyvesant and was thus expected to result in Brooklyn&#x27;s first black member of Congress. (Adam Clayton Powell Jr. had, in 1945, become the first black member of Congress from New York City as a whole.) As a result of the redrawing, the white incumbent in the former 12th, Representative Edna F. Kelly, sought reelection in a different district. Chisholm announced her candidacy around January 1968 and established some early organizational support. Her campaign slogan was &quot;Unbought and unbossed&quot;. In the June 18 Democratic primary, Chisholm defeated two other black opponents, State Senator William S. Thompson and labor official Dollie Robertson. In the general election, she staged an upset victory over James Farmer, the former director of the Congress of Racial Equality, who was running as a Liberal Party candidate with Republican support, winning by an approximately two-to-one margin. Chisholm thereby became the first black woman elected to Congress, and she was the only woman in the first-year class that year.

===Early terms===
Speaker of the House John W. McCormack assigned Chisholm to serve on the House Agriculture Committee. Given her urban district, she felt that the placement was irrelevant to her constituents. When Chisholm confided to Rebbe Menachem M. Schneerson that she was upset and insulted by her assignment, Schneerson suggested that she use the surplus food to help the poor and hungry. Chisholm subsequently met Bob Dole and worked to expand the food-stamp program. She later played a critical role in the creation of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). Chisholm would credit Schneerson for the fact that so many &quot;poor babies [now] have milk and poor children have food&quot;. Chisholm was then also placed on the Veterans&#x27; Affairs Committee. Soon after, she voted for Hale Boggs as House Majority Leader over John Conyers. As a reward for her support, Boggs assigned her to the much-prized Education and Labor Committee, which was her preferred committee. She was the third-highest-ranking member of this committee when she retired from Congress.

Initially, Chisholm only hired women for her office; half of them were black. In later years, she did hire some men for both her Washington office and the one in her Brooklyn district. Chisholm said that she had faced much more discrimination during her New York legislative career because she was a woman than for her race.

In 1971, Chisholm served as a founding member of both the Congressional Black Caucus and the National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus. In January 1971, Chisholm was one of 74
U.S. representatives to co-sponsor the House version of the Health Security Act, a bipartisan universal healthcare bill that supported the creation of a government health insurance program to cover every person in America.

In May 1971, Chisholm and fellow New York Congresswoman Bella Abzug introduced a bill to provide $10 billion in federal funds for child-care services by 1975. A less expensive version introduced by Senator Walter Mondale eventually passed the House and Senate as the Comprehensive Child Development Bill, but it was vetoed in December 1971 by President Richard Nixon, who said that it was too expensive and would undermine the institution of the family.

===1972 presidential campaign===
Chisholm began exploring her candidacy in July 1971 and formally announced her presidential bid on January 25, 1972, in a Baptist church in her district in Brooklyn. There, she called for a &quot;bloodless revolution&quot; at the forthcoming Democratic nominating convention for the 1972 U.S. presidential election. Chisholm became the first African American to run for a major party&#x27;s nomination for President of the United States, making her also the first woman ever to run for the Democratic Party&#x27;s presidential nomination (U.S. Senator Margaret Chase Smith having previously run for the 1964 Republican presidential nomination). In her presidential announcement, Chisholm described herself as representative of the people and offered a new articulation of American identity: &quot;I am not the candidate of black America, although I am black and proud. I am not the candidate of the women&#x27;s movement of this country, although I am a woman and equally proud of that. I am the candidate of the people and my presence before you symbolizes a new era in American political history.&quot;

Her campaign was underfunded, only spending $300,000 in total. She also struggled to be regarded as a serious candidate instead of as a symbolic political figure; the Democratic political establishment ignored her, and her black male colleagues provided little support. She later said, &quot;When I ran for the Congress, when I ran for president, I met more discrimination as a woman than for being black. Men are men.&quot; In particular, she expressed frustration about the &quot;black matriarch thing&quot;, saying, &quot;They think I am trying to take power from them. The black man must step forward, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the black woman must step back.&quot; Her husband, however, was fully supportive of her candidacy and said, &quot;I have no hangups about a woman running for president.&quot; Security was also a concern, as, during the campaign, three confirmed threats were made against her life; Conrad Chisholm served as her bodyguard until U.S. Secret Service protection was given to her in May 1972.

Chisholm skipped the initial March 7 New Hampshire contest, instead focusing on the March 14 Florida primary, which she thought would be receptive due to its &quot;blacks, youth, and a strong women&#x27;s movement&quot;. But, due to organizational difficulties and Congressional responsibilities, she only made two campaign trips there and ended with 3.5 percent of the vote for a seventh-place finish. Chisholm had difficulties gaining ballot access, but campaigned or received votes in primaries in fourteen states. Her largest number of votes came in the June 6 California primary, where she received 157,435 votes for 4.4 percent and a fourth-place finish, while her best percentage in a competitive primary came in the May 6 North Carolina contest, where she got 7.5 percent for a third-place finish. Overall, she won 28 delegates during the primaries process itself. Chisholm&#x27;s base of support was ethnically diverse and included the National Organization for Women. Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem attempted to run as Chisholm delegates in New York. Altogether, during the primary season, she received 430,703 votes, which was 2.7 percent of the total of nearly 16 million cast and represented seventh place among the Democratic contenders. In June, Chisholm became the first woman to appear in a United States presidential debate.

At the 1972 Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida, there were still efforts taking place by the campaign of former Vice President Hubert Humphrey to stop the nomination of Senator George McGovern for president. After that failed and McGovern&#x27;s nomination was assured, as a symbolic gesture, Humphrey released his black delegates to Chisholm. This, combined with defections from disenchanted delegates from other candidates, as well as the delegates that she had won in the primaries, gave her a total of 152 first-ballot votes for the presidential nomination during the July 12 roll call. (Her precise total was 151.95.) Her largest support overall came from Ohio, with 23 delegates (slightly more than half of them white), even though she had not been on the ballot in the May 2 primary there. Her total gave her fourth place in the roll-call tally, behind McGovern&#x27;s winning total of 1,728 delegates. Chisholm said that she ran for office &quot;in spite of hopeless odds ... to demonstrate the sheer will and refusal to accept the status quo&quot;.

It is sometimes stated that Chisholm won a primary in 1972, or won three states overall, with New Jersey, Louisiana and Mississippi being so identified. None of these fit the usual definition of winning a plurality of the contested popular vote or delegate allocations at the time of a state primary, caucus or state convention. In the June 6 New Jersey primary, there was a complex ballot that featured both a delegate-selection vote and a non-binding, non-delegate-producing &quot;beauty contest&quot; presidential preference vote. In the delegate-selection vote, Democratic front-runner McGovern defeated his main rival at that point, Humphrey, and won the large share of available delegates. Of the Democratic candidates, only Chisholm and former North Carolina governor Terry Sanford were on the statewide preference ballot. Sanford had withdrawn from the contest three weeks earlier. In that non-binding preference tally, which the Associated Press described as &quot;meaningless&quot;, Chisholm received the majority of votes: 51,433, which was 66.9 percent. During the actual balloting at the national convention, Chisholm received votes from only 4 of New Jersey&#x27;s 109 delegates, with 89 going to McGovern.

In the May 13 Louisiana caucuses, there was a battle between forces of McGovern and Alabama governor George Wallace; nearly all of the delegates chosen were those who identified as uncommitted, many of them black. Leading up to the convention, McGovern was thought to control 20 of Louisiana&#x27;s 44 delegates, with most of the rest uncommitted. During the actual roll call at the national convention, Louisiana passed at first, then cast 18.5 of its 44 votes for Chisholm, with the next-best finishers being McGovern and Senator Henry M. Jackson with 10.25 each. As one delegate explained, &quot;Our strategy was to give Shirley our votes for sentimental reasons on the first ballot. However, if our votes would have made the difference, we would have gone with McGovern.&quot; In Mississippi, there were two rival party factions that each selected delegates at their own state conventions and caucuses: &quot;regulars&quot;, representing the mostly white state Democratic Party, and &quot;loyalists&quot;, representing many blacks and white liberals. Each slate professed to be largely uncommitted, but the regulars were thought to favor Wallace and the loyalists McGovern. By the time of the national convention, the loyalists were seated following a credentials challenge, and their delegates were characterized as mostly supporting McGovern, with some support for Humphrey. During the convention, some McGovern delegates became angry about what they saw as statements from McGovern that backed away from his commitment to end U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia, and cast protest votes for Chisholm as a result. During the actual balloting, Mississippi went in the first half of the roll call, and cast 12 of its 25 votes for Chisholm, with McGovern coming next with 10 votes.

During the campaign, the German filmmaker Peter Lilienthal shot the documentary film &quot;Shirley Chisholm for President&quot; for the German television channel ZDF.

===Later terms===
Chisholm created controversy when she visited rival and ideological opposite George Wallace in the hospital soon after his shooting in May 1972, during the presidential primary campaign. Several years later, when Chisholm worked on a bill to give domestic workers the right to a minimum wage, Wallace helped gain votes from enough Southern congressmen to push the legislation through the House.

From 1977 to 1981, during the 95th Congress and 96th Congress, Chisholm served as Secretary of the Democratic Caucus.

Throughout her tenure in Congress, Chisholm worked to improve opportunities for inner-city residents. She supported spending increases for education, health care and other social services. She was very concerned with instances of discrimination against women, especially those against impoverished women. She also focused on land rights for Native Americans.

In the area of national security and foreign policy, Chisholm worked for the revocation of Internal Security Act of 1950. She opposed the American involvement in the Vietnam War and the expansion of weapon developments. She was a vocal opponent of the U.S. military draft. During the Jimmy Carter administration, she called for better treatment of Haitian refugees.

She was a forceful advocate for the Equal Rights Amendment, believing that the initial value of passing it would be in the social and psychological effects that it would have more than any economic or legal impact. She did not want the amendment modified to incorporate a provision that would permit laws that purportedly protected the health and safety of women, saying such a modification would continue a traditional avenue of discrimination against women. Regarding a specific argument made along these lines, that the amendment would require women to be subject to the draft, Chisholm was unperturbed, saying that if there was a draft, women could serve, and that some larger, stronger women might perform better in infantry roles than some smaller, weaker men.

At the same time, Chisholm was aware of how much of second-wave feminism in the United States focused on the concerns of middle-class white women, such as the adoption of the term &quot;Ms.&quot; At the 1973 convention of the National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus, Chisholm said that &quot;women of color&quot; were faced with &quot;double discrimination&quot; that especially affected them economically, and that the women&#x27;s movement needed to make changes to reflect better such women and their concerns. Scholar Julie Gallagher has written that Chisholm&#x27;s pressure in this regard did make some difference in the focus of the women&#x27;s movement later in the 1970s.

Chisholm&#x27;s first marriage ended in a divorce, which was granted on February 4, 1977, in the Dominican Republic. Later that year, on November 26, she married Arthur Hardwick Jr., a former New York State Assemblyman whom Chisholm had known when they both served in that body and who was now a Buffalo, New York, liquor-store owner. The ceremony was held in a Buffalo-area hotel. She indicated that while her legal name was now Hardwick, she would continue to use Chisholm in politics. She began spending some of her time in Buffalo, which brought some political criticism that she was being inattentive to her district.

By the mid- to late-1970s, there was growing dissatisfaction with Chisholm among some liberals in New York state and city politics, who felt that Chisholm too often sided with Democratic party bosses over liberal, black or feminist challengers. Instances of her doing this included supporting the incumbent conservative Democrat John J. Rooney over the liberal antiwar activist Allard Lowenstein in a 1972 congressional primary; failing to support Bella Abzug&#x27;s primary campaigns for U.S. senator in 1976 and New York mayor in 1977; failing to support the young feminist Elizabeth Holtzman&#x27;s successful primary challenge to the aging congressional incumbent Emanuel Celler in 1972; and remaining neutral during longtime African-American civil rights leader and elected official Percy Sutton&#x27;s bid in the 1977 mayoral primary, followed by endorsing Ed Koch in a runoff. This dissatisfaction was exemplified by a long 1978 piece published in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, titled &quot;Chisholm&#x27;s Compromises: Politics and the Art of Self-Interest&quot; and written by former UDC ally Andrew W. Cooper and &quot;Voice&quot; investigative reporter Wayne Barrett. Similarly, &quot;The Amsterdam News&quot; ran an editorial about the &quot;Chisholm problem&quot;. Chisholm defended herself by saying that she was selecting those candidates who could best protect the interests of, and produce government benefits for, her constituents, but critics said that her behavior put the lie to the &quot;unbossed&quot; part of her slogan. To her biographer Barbara Winslow, Chisholm, being black and a woman, had no natural political base, and she was likely siding with the Democratic machine in order to give herself a secure spot from which to speak out on the provocative progressive messages that she wanted to put forth. A later analysis in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; framed the matter by saying that, despite the celebrity stemming from her presidential campaign, &quot;Chisholm has been a lonely politician. Her unpredictability has led to an isolation that has been augmented by her pride and paranoia.&quot;

Hardwick was badly injured in an April 1979 automobile accident. Desiring to take care of her husband, and also dissatisfied with the course of liberal politics in the wake of the Reagan Revolution, Chisholm decided to leave Congress. The possibility that she would be challenged in a Democratic primary election may have also been a factor in her decision. She announced her retirement in February 1982, saying that she looked forward to &quot;a more private life&quot;. She further expressed that the Reagan administration was &quot;not responsive to our constituency. The constituency is going to be more voluble and demanding, and I find myself in a position where I can&#x27;t help them.&quot; She also lamented the tactics of the Christian right, which she said made potent use of the media and the symbols of family, morality and the national flag to quiet dissatisfaction in the people. But, overall, Chisholm felt that press reports had overemphasized her political dissatisfaction in her retirement calculus; fundamentally, she said in September 1982, &quot;I&#x27;ve been so obsessed with politics and the desire to help my people all these years, I&#x27;ve never had time to think about my personal life. I think the accident was an instrument, God&#x27;s way of making me reassess my life.&quot; She said she never intended to spend her whole career in politics and looked forward to a return to teaching.

==Later life and death==

After leaving Congress in January 1983, Chisholm made her home in Williamsville, New York, a suburb of Buffalo. Wanting to resume her career in education, she had hoped to be named a college president, in particular of Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn or of City College of New York in Manhattan, but past political opponents were influential in the selection processes and she received neither post. Similarly, a move to make her New York City Schools Chancellor was blocked by teachers-union head, and longtime foe, Albert Shanker, and she withdrew from consideration for that position.

However, she was offered a dozen possible teaching positions at colleges. She accepted being named to the Purington Chair at the all-women Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, a position that she held for the next four years. She was not a member of any particular department, but was able to teach classes in a variety of areas; those previously holding the professorship included W. H. Auden, Bertrand Russell and Arna Bontemps. When questioned why she would want to teach at an institution with mostly affluent whites as students, she replied that she enjoyed the challenge of exposing them to both her feminist viewpoint and her background and experiences. In addition, during this time, she spent the Spring 1985 semester as a visiting professor at the historically black women&#x27;s Spelman College in Atlanta. At Spelman, she taught classes titled &quot;Congress, Power and Politics&quot;, where she sought to engage students in questions about representative government, and &quot;History of the Black Woman in America&quot;.

In 1984, Chisholm and C. Delores Tucker co-founded an organization initially known as the National Black Women&#x27;s Political Caucus. This was established during the vice presidential campaign of Geraldine Ferraro. African-American women from various political organizations convened to set forth a political agenda emphasizing the needs of women of African descent. Chisholm was chosen as its first chair. Creation of the group represented a split with an earlier organization, the National Black Women&#x27;s Political Leadership Caucus, which had been co-founded by Tucker in 1971. Following a protest by the earlier group, the new one changed its name to the National Political Congress of Black Women, later simplified to the National Congress of Black Women.

During those years, she continued to give speeches at colleges, by her own count visiting over 150 campuses since becoming nationally known. She told students to avoid polarization and intolerance: &quot;If you don&#x27;t accept others who are different, it means nothing that you&#x27;ve learned calculus.&quot; Continuing to be involved politically, she traveled to visit different minority groups and urge them to become a strong force at the local level. She campaigned for Jesse Jackson during his 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns. In 1990, Chisholm, along with 15 other black women and men, formed African-American Women for Reproductive Freedom.

Her husband, Arthur Hardwick, died in August 1986. Chisholm moved to Florida in 1991. In 1993, President Bill Clinton nominated her to be United States Ambassador to Jamaica, but she could not serve due to poor health, and the nomination was withdrawn. In that same year, she was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

Chisholm died on January 1, 2005, at her home in Ormond Beach, Florida; her health had been in decline after she had suffered a series of small strokes the previous summer. At her funeral, held in Palm Coast, Florida, the minister said that Chisholm had brought about change because &quot;she showed up, she stood up and she spoke up.&quot; She is buried in the Birchwood Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buffalo, where the legend inscribed on her vault reads: &quot;Unbought and Unbossed&quot;.

==Legacy==
In February 2005, &quot;Shirley Chisholm &#x27;72: Unbought and Unbossed&quot;, a documentary film, aired on U.S. public television. It chronicled Chisholm&#x27;s 1972 bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. It was directed and produced by independent African-American filmmaker Shola Lynch. The film was featured at the Sundance Film Festival in 2004. On April 9, 2006, the film was announced as a winner of a Peabody Award.

In 2014, the first biography of Chisholm for an adult audience was published, &quot;Shirley Chisholm: Catalyst for Change&quot;, by Brooklyn College history professor Barbara Winslow, who was also the founder and first director of the Shirley Chisholm Project. Until then, only several juvenile biographies had appeared.

Chisholm&#x27;s speech &quot;For the Equal Rights Amendment&quot;, given in 1970, is listed as number 91 in American Rhetoric&#x27;s Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century (listed by rank).

===Monuments===
The Shirley Chisholm Project on Brooklyn Women&#x27;s Activism (formerly known as the Shirley Chisholm Center for Research) exists at Brooklyn College to promote research projects and programs on women and to preserve Chisholm&#x27;s legacy. The Chisholm Project also houses an archive as part of the Chisholm Papers in the college library Special Collections.

In January 2018, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced his intent to build the Shirley Chisholm State Park, a state park along of the Jamaica Bay coastline, adjoining the Pennsylvania Avenue and Fountain Avenue landfills south of Spring Creek Park&#x27;s Gateway Center section. The state park was dedicated to Chisholm that September. The park opened to the public on July 2, 2019.

In April 2023, the Vauxhall Primary School in Christ Church, Barbados, which was built in 1976 to replace the school where Chisholm received her elementary education, was renamed the Shirley Chisholm Primary School. The renaming ceremony was attended by Chisholm&#x27;s relatives, and a plaque was unveiled by Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, the island&#x27;s first female premier. The school&#x27;s Shirley Chisholm Memorial Garden contains a bust of Chisholm and a colorful mural showcasing her achievements.

A memorial monument of Chisholm is planned for the entrance to Prospect Park in Brooklyn by Parkside Avenue station, designed by artists Amanda Williams and Olalekan Jeyifous. After four years of delays and revisions, the project gained approval from the New York City Public Design Commission during 2023.

===The Shirley Chisholm Legacy Project===
The Shirley Chisholm Legacy Project, founded by Jacqueline Patterson, aims to advance climate justice for black communities through the Just Transition Framework. This initiative links frontline black leaders, especially women, with the necessary resources to drive systemic change from harmful extractive practices to an economy that acknowledges the principles of sustainable living. The project aims to address the interconnected challenges of environmental issues, poverty, racial discrimination and gender inequality.

===Political===
Chisholm&#x27;s legacy came into renewed prominence during the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, when Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton staged their historic &quot;firsts&quot; battle – where the victor would either be the first major-party African-American nominee, or the first female nominee – with at least one observer crediting Chisholm&#x27;s 1972 campaign as having paved the way for both of them.

Chisholm has been a major influence on other women of color in politics, among them California Congresswoman Barbara Lee, who stated in a 2017 interview that Chisholm had a profound impact on her career. Lee had worked for Chisholm&#x27;s 1972 presidential campaign.

By the time of the 50th anniversary of Chisholm entering Congress, &quot;The New York Times&quot; was headlining &quot;2019 Belongs to Shirley Chisholm&quot;, saying that &quot;Chisholm was a one-woman precursor to modern progressive politics&quot; and that she was &quot;enjoying a resurgence of interest 14 years after her death&quot;.

Chisholm has also inspired Vice President Kamala Harris, who recognized Chisholm&#x27;s presidential campaign by using similar typography and red-and-yellow color scheme in her own 2020 presidential campaign&#x27;s promotional materials and logo. Harris launched her presidential campaign 47 years to the day after Chisholm&#x27;s presidential campaign.

===In popular culture===
Actress Uzo Aduba portrayed Chisholm in the FX on Hulu miniseries &quot;Mrs. America&quot;, released in April 2020, for which she won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series.

In November 2020, Danai Gurira was cast as Shirley Chisholm in &quot;The Fighting Shirley Chisholm&quot;, directed by Cherien Dabis, about her 1972 run for president. However, as of 2024, the film had not appeared, and it was still considered to be in development.

Another film, &quot;Shirley&quot;, was announced in February 2021, with Regina King as Chisholm and John Ridley directing. Also announced in the cast were Lance Reddick, Lucas Hedges, Amirah Vahn, André Holland, Christina Jackson, Michael Cherrie, Dorian Missick, W. Earl Brown and Terrence Howard. &quot;Shirley&quot; was released on Netflix in March 2024.

Chisholm was also heavily featured in Mel Brooks&#x27;s 2023 satirical television series &quot;History of the World, Part II&quot;, played by Wanda Sykes. Segments throughout the series loosely detailed Chisholm&#x27;s presidential bid stylized as episodes of &quot;Shirley!&quot;, a fictional 1970s sitcom. The episodes &quot;starred&quot; other members of Chisholm&#x27;s family and friends, including Conrad Chisholm (Colton Dunn), Florynce Kennedy (Kym Whitley) and Ruby Seale (Marla Gibbs).

<text>ZÈRTZ is the third game in the &quot;GIPF&quot; Project of seven abstract strategy games. The game features a shrinking board and an object that promotes sacrifice combinations. It is impartial: since neither player owns on-board pieces, maintaining the initiative is of fundamental importance.

==Rules==

===Equipment===
The playing pieces are six white, eight gray, and ten black marbles, and (for the standard game) 37 rings, each of which can hold a marble. Initially, the game was supplied with 37 rings, but newer versions include 49 rings. The &quot;GIPF&quot; Set 2 expansion includes 12 additional rings, which can be used for larger game boards. Advanced and tournament players use up to 61 rings, which requires acquisition of a &quot;GIPF&quot; Set 2 expansion.

===Setup===
Players place the rings on a flat surface and arrange them as a packed hexagon, as regularly as possible. This composes the &quot;board&quot;. With 37 rings, this forms a perfect hexagon with four rings on a side. Starting configurations with additional rings are shown in the gallery below. The marbles go into a shared pool.
===Object===
The object is to capture a majority of one color (+1: four white, or five gray, or six black marbles), or three marbles of each color.

===Gameplay===
The two players determine who will go first. For each turn, the player may either &quot;jump&quot; or &quot;drop&quot;.
# If a &quot;jump&quot; is available, the player is required to &quot;jump&quot; instead of &quot;drop&quot;.
# &quot;Jumping&quot; means the player will capture one or more marbles through a mechanic similar to &quot;Checkers&quot;, in which one marble may jump over an adjacent marble when there is a free space on the other side.
# &quot;Dropping&quot; means the player will place a new marble on the board and take away one free ring.

====Jumping====

If any two marbles are adjacent on the board, and there is room for one to &quot;jump&quot; the other, landing on an unoccupied ring immediately opposite the other, a player must jump instead of dropping. The jumping player captures any jumped marbles. The player must continue to jump with the same marble as long as additional jumps by the same marble are possible. If at any stage of jumping more than one jump is possible, the player may choose any direction; however, the player must continue jumping with the same marble for as long as at least one other marble is jumpable by the moving marble. (This is similar to the compulsory jumping rule in Checkers.)

No rings are removed on a jumping turn.

In the example illustrated here, the following jumps (or jump sequences) are possible:
* White marble at E5: , captures grey marble at D5 and black marbles at B4 and A2
* White marble at E5: , captures grey marble at D5 and white marble at D6
* White marble at D6: , captures grey marble at D5 and white marble at E5
* Grey marble at D5: , captures white marble at E5

Notice the jump offers a choice of two directions after being taken, either or .

====Dropping====

If no jumps are available, the player whose turn it is must drop a marble of any color onto an empty ring of the board, then remove a &quot;free ring&quot; from the board. A ring is free if it is unoccupied and can be detached by sliding it away on the table surface without displacing other rings. In the example illustrated here, the free rings are [A1], [A2], [B1], [D7], [E4], [F4], [G4], and [G5].

There are two special cases:
# If removing a ring produces a cluster of one or more rings, called an &quot;island&quot;, with a marble on each ring in the cluster, all of these rings are also removed, and the player whose move created the island captures all the marbles on it.
# If no ring is free, the player&#x27;s turn ends when he drops a marble. If no marbles are available in the shared pool, the player must drop one of his captured marbles instead.

==Strategy==
The basic strategy in &quot;ZÈRTZ&quot; is sacrifice. Because a player is forced to capture when possible, a common strategy is for one player to play so that the other must capture a piece of low importance. This moves other pieces into a position where the first player can then capture one or more pieces of higher importance. In addition, sacrifices are used to arrange pieces and gain time in preparation for capture by isolation. Frequently a game will end with one player forcing the other to repeatedly jump, gaining time to win with a capture by isolation.

==Variants==

===Blitz===
A short &quot;Blitz&quot; version of the game can be played using a reduced set of 5 white marbles, 7 gray, and 9 black marbles. In this case, the goal is to capture only a majority of one set (three whites, four grays, or five blacks), or two of each color. This variant is described in the original edition as the &quot;basic rules&quot;.

===&quot;ZÈRTZ&quot;+11===
This is the game of &quot;ZÈRTZ&quot; played with 11 extra rings, forming an irregular hexagon with sides alternating between 4 and 5 rings. This is the current standard for serious tournament play.

===&quot;ZÈRTZ&quot;+24===
This is &quot;ZÈRTZ&quot; played with 24 extra rings, forming a regular hexagon with 5 rings along each side. It has been suggested that this will eventually become the tournament standard.

<text>The Majority Report with Sam Seder is a left wing, progressive internet talk radio program and podcast hosted by Sam Seder. The program focuses on the discussion of current events and political affairs from a social democratic, democratic socialist and progressive standpoint; to this end, comedy and satire are used from time to time to make key points. Originally airing on the Air America radio network, from March 2004 until July 2006 the show was hosted by Janeane Garofalo; Garofalo was reportedly originally asked by Air America to host the program and suggested Seder as a co-host.

&quot;The Majority Report&quot; was associated with the TYT Network, with which the show partnered, from the 2010 relaunch until 2020, which generally followed its original format but was rebooted as a viewer-funded production. Following those structural affiliation and funding-production changes, the show has won a string of international People&#x27;s Choice Podcast Awards, in five of the next seven annual competitions (2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2017), for the &quot;News and Politics&quot; award.

== History ==

The inspiration for &quot;The Majority Report&quot; radio program occurred on election night 2000, when Sam Seder witnessed via the television media what he perceived to be the theft of the presidency by George W. Bush. The name &quot;The Majority Report&quot; refers to Al Gore being &quot;first past the post&quot;, a plurality, on the popular vote (beating President Bush) in the election as well as a play on the popular 1956 story &quot;The Minority Report&quot; by Philip K. Dick. In February 2003, Janeane Garofalo (a longtime friend and fellow comedian of Seder) appeared as a guest with Seder on &quot;The Best Show on WFMU with Tom Scharpling&quot;, a comedy/talk radio program on the New Jersey station WFMU. In the summer of 2003, Garofalo was approached by representatives of Air America Radio to be a radio personality for their programming. She insisted that they hire Seder and that he share the hosting responsibilities. Less than one year later, on March 31, 2004, The Majority Report with Janeane Garofalo was born, and aired from 8 - 11 PM ET initially, and later in the year the time slot moved up 1 hour to 7 - 10 PM ET. Regular guests included bloggers Atrios of &quot;Eschaton&quot; and Bill Scher of &quot;LiberalOasis&quot;. Journalist Bill Crowley read the hourly news and engaged in a brief discussion at the beginning of each program&#x27;s third hour, introduced by Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Crowley.&quot;

Garofalo once said getting on the radio was an early career goal of hers. One early program advertisement read: &quot;The battle to reclaim America from the forces of darkness continues with hosts Janeane Garofalo and Sam Seder.&quot; The early days of Air America Radio are chronicled in the documentary &quot;Left of the Dial&quot;, which includes a debate between Janeane and her conservative father Carmine, who was initially a regular guest on &quot;The Majority Report.&quot;
Garofalo came under fire from her listeners for her comments on her April 28, 2006 show supporting Scientology-linked &quot;New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project&quot;, a questioned treatment for workers now suffering ailments from 9/11 clean-up efforts in New York City.

=== July 2006: Departure of Janeane Garofalo ===
After months of speculation, Garofalo announced on the broadcast of Friday, July 14, 2006 that she would be leaving her co-host position on &quot;The Majority Report&quot;; on the Wednesday, July 19 broadcast (while Seder and Garofalo were interviewing Jason Bateman), Garofalo cited her reason for leaving the show as precipitated by several &quot;unrecoverable&quot; on-air arguments with Seder; she also said that she regards Seder as a better radio broadcaster than she, and therefore a better choice to continue &quot;The Majority Report&quot;.

Although several reasons for her departure were cited (including her outside acting responsibilities, which made her largely absent from &quot;The Majority Report&quot; for several weeks prior), the relationship between Garofalo and co-host Sam Seder had become increasingly strained, owing largely to Garofalo&#x27;s promotion of the above-mentioned Scientology-linked treatment program for firefighters and rescue workers in New York City. On June 2, Garofalo responded to Seder&#x27;s opposition, suggesting that he would not have a problem with the program if it were linked to Jews rather than Scientologists. Seder, who is Jewish, and his producer walked off the set in angry protest.

Garofalo&#x27;s long stint on the final season of the NBC drama &quot;The West Wing&quot; (as Louise Thornton, media strategist for Jimmy Smits&#x27; character, presidential candidate Matt Santos) did not allow her to be in New York to co-host &quot;The Majority Report&quot; for several weeks; this allowed Sam to make the program his own, and she acknowledged that this had a part to play in her decision to leave. She mentioned that Seder was her favorite available choice for co-host when she was approached by Air America for the radio show; her first choice (as she said in obvious jest) was her favorite actor, Steve McQueen, who has been deceased for many years. Her last broadcast as co-host of &quot;The Majority Report&quot; aired on July 21, 2006.

Garofalo returned to the show occasionally, performing as Senator Katherine Harris, a comedic/satirical impersonation of Katherine Harris, former (Republican) Florida Secretary of State and Representative for FL-13.

=== September 2006: &quot;The Sam Seder Show&quot; ===
In September 2006, the original radio show ended its run. Seder, hosting by himself, then began a new mid-morning program on Air America Radio, The Sam Seder Show, in the time slot previously occupied by Jerry Springer (which was also the lead-in to &quot;The Al Franken Show&quot;). The show retained many of the elements of the original &quot;Majority Report&quot;. Seder aired &quot;The Sam Seder Show&quot;&#x27;s final broadcast on Friday, April 13, 2007.

=== November 2010: Reboot and distribution model ===
In November 2010, Seder re-launched the show as The Majority Report with Sam Seder, a self-produced independent online podcast. The format closely matches the previous Air America program (even using some of the same recorded intro announcements and bumper music), with politically oriented commentary by Seder and interviews with various guests; Garofalo participates occasionally as a guest, and Cliff Schecter, co-author of &quot;The Real McCain&quot; with Marcia Mitchell, is often a guest as well, usually on Fridays. &quot;The Majority Report&quot; also streams live, Monday - Friday at 12 PM ET on their website and various other platforms. Seder offers premium subscriptions to listeners (via the show&#x27;s re-launched website) to help with production expenses (following the business model of Mike Malloy when his program became self-syndicated, and that of Cenk Uygur of &quot;The Young Turks&quot;); this allows subscribers access to expanded commentary not on the basic podcast. On the re-launched website, Seder also offers DVDs of the 2004 TV series &quot;Pilot Season&quot;, produced and directed by Seder, starring Sarah Silverman and originally broadcast on the now-defunct Trio cable channel. Producer/Contributors Michael Brooks and Matt Binder began co-hosting M&amp;M Mondays in 2013. Producer Matt Binder left the show in October 2015 to work for the new Internet startup, CAFE. Later that month, Matt Lech and Kelly Carey were added as producers. In September 2017, Kelly Carey departed to work for TYT Politics, and Jamie Peck along with Brendan Finn were hired as producers later in October.

=== July 2020: Death of Michael Brooks ===
On July 20, 2020, co-host Michael Brooks died at the age of 36 due to a &quot;sudden medical condition,&quot; later revealed to be an undetected thrombosis in his neck. Following Brooks&#x27; death, an extended &quot;Majority Report&quot; episode was held allowing for previous guests, &quot;Majority Report&quot; contributors, and callers to mourn and remember Brooks. Seder announced that &quot;The Majority Report&quot; would be off the air for one week following Brooks&#x27; passing.

=== Fall 2020–2021: Personnel changes and other developments ===
In October 2020, it was announced that Emma Vigeland, formerly a contributor for &quot;The Young Turks&quot;, would assume Brooks&#x27; position as co-host and producer. Her first appearance took place on November 3, 2020, the date of the 2020 presidential election.

In November 2020, a one-hour version of the show began airing on the NBCUniversal streaming service Peacock, however, the show&#x27;s contract with Peacock ended in November 2021 and it was not renewed.

In March 2021, Jamie Peck announced that she would be leaving the show.

In June 2021, Brandon Sutton announced that he would be co-hosting the Majority Report on Thursdays going forward.

In July 2021, it was announced that producer Brendan Finn would be leaving the show to return to school to study health policy.

<doc id="567292" wikidata="Q620584" url="?curid=567292" title="Mental calculation">
<text>Mental calculation consists of arithmetical calculations using only the human brain, with no help from any supplies (such as pencil and paper) or devices such as a calculator. People may use mental calculation when computing tools are not available, when it is faster than other means of calculation (such as conventional educational institution methods), or even in a competitive context. Mental calculation often involves the use of specific techniques devised for specific types of problems. People with unusually high ability to perform mental calculations are called mental calculators or &quot;lightning calculator&quot;s.

Many of these techniques take advantage of or rely on the decimal numeral system. 

==Methods and techniques==

===Casting out nines===
After applying an arithmetic operation to two operands and getting a result, the following procedure can be used to improve confidence in the correctness of the result:
# Sum the digits of the first operand; any 9s (or sets of digits that add to 9) can be counted as 0.
# If the resulting sum has two or more digits, sum those digits as in step one; repeat this step until the resulting sum has only one digit.
# Repeat steps one and two with the second operand. At this point there are two single-digit numbers, the first derived from the first operand and the second derived from the second operand.
# Apply the originally specified operation to the two condensed operands, and then apply the summing-of-digits procedure to the result of the operation.
# Sum the digits of the result that were originally obtained for the original calculation.
# If the result of step 4 does not equal the result of step 5, then the original answer is wrong. If the two results match, then the original answer may be right, though it is not guaranteed to be.
Example
* Assume the calculation 6,338 × 79, manually done, yielded a result of 500,702:
# Sum the digits of 6,338: (6 + 3 = 9, so count that as 0) + 3 + 8 = 11
# Iterate as needed: 1 + 1 = 2
# Sum the digits of 79: 7 + (9 counted as 0) = 7
# Perform the original operation on the condensed operands, and sum digits: 2 × 7 = 14; 1 + 4 = 5
# Sum the digits of 500702: 5 + 0 + 0 + (7 + 0 + 2 = 9, which counts as 0) = 5
# 5 = 5, so there is a good chance that the prediction that 6,338 × 79 equals 500,702 is right.

The same procedure can be used with multiple operations, repeating steps 1 and 2 for each operation.

=== Factors ===
When multiplying, a useful thing to remember is that the factors of the operands still remain. For example, to say that 14 × 15 was 201 would be unreasonable. Since 15 is a multiple of 5, the product should be as well. Likewise, 14 is a multiple of 2, so the product should be even. Furthermore, any number which is a multiple of both 5 and 2 is necessarily a multiple of 10, and in the decimal system would end with a 0. The correct answer is 210. It is a multiple of 10, 7 (the other prime factor of 14) and 3 (the other prime factor of 15).

=== Calculating differences: &quot;a&quot; − &quot;b&quot; ===

==== Direct calculation ====
When the digits of &quot;b&quot; are all smaller than the corresponding digits of &quot;a&quot;, the calculation can be done digit by digit. For example, evaluate 872 − 41 simply by subtracting 1 from 2 in the units place, and 4 from 7 in the tens place: 831.

==== Indirect calculation ====
When the above situation does not apply, there is another method known as indirect calculation.

==== Look-ahead borrow method ====
This method can be used to subtract numbers left to right, and if all that is required is to read the result aloud, it requires little of the user&#x27;s memory even to subtract numbers of arbitrary size.

One place at a time is handled, left to right.

 Example:
 4075
 − 1844
 
 Thousands: 4 − 1 = 3, look to right, 075 &lt; 844, need to borrow.
 3 − 1 = 2, say &quot;Two thousand&quot;.
 One is performing 3 - 1 rather than 4 - 1 because the column to the right is
 going to borrow from the thousands place.
 Hundreds: 0 − 8 = negative numbers not allowed here.
 One is going to increase this place by using the number one borrowed from the
 column to the left. Therefore:
 10 − 8 = 2. It is 10 rather than 0, because one borrowed from the Thousands
 place. 75 &gt; 44 so no need to borrow,
 say &quot;two hundred&quot;
 Tens: 7 − 4 = 3, 5 &gt; 4, so 5 - 4 = 1
Hence, the result is 2231.

=== Calculating products: &quot;a&quot; × &quot;b&quot; ===

Many of these methods work because of the distributive property.

==== General Multiplication ====

The most notable technique outlined in the Trachtenberg system is cross-multiplication. Cross-multiplication can be used to reduce the multiplication of two large numbers into a series of additions and single-digit multiplications.

Example: formula_1

1) The right-most digits are multiplied together: formula_2 is the final digit of the answer.

2) (formula_3, write 5 (to the left of the first solved digit) and carry 4 to the next step.

3) (formula_4, write 0 and carry 8 to the next step.

4) (formula_5, write 2 and carry 10 to the next step.

5) (formula_6, write 0 and carry 11 to the next step.

6) (formula_7, write 1 and carry 8 to the next step.

7) (formula_8, write 8 and carry 4 to the next step.

8) (formula_9, write 3 and carry 2 to the next step.

9) (formula_10, write 8.

As a result, the product of the two five-digit numbers has been identified as 838102050 using only elementary multiplication and addition.

Cross-multiplication --- with suitable adjustments --- can also be done left-to-right or can be done using blocks of more than one digit at a time.

==== The &quot;Ends of Five&quot; Formula ====
For any 2-digit by 2-digit multiplication problem, if both numbers end in five, the following algorithm can be used to quickly multiply them together:

:formula_11

As a preliminary step simply round the smaller number down and the larger up to the nearest multiple of ten. In this case:

:formula_12

:formula_13

The algorithm reads as follows:

:formula_14

Where t1 is the tens unit of the original larger number (75) and t2 is the tens unit of the original smaller number (35).

:formula_15

==== Multiplying any 2-digit numbers ====
To easily multiply any 2-digit numbers together a simple algorithm is as follows (where a is the tens digit of the first number, b is the ones digit of the first number, c is the tens digit of the second number and d is the ones digit of the second number):

:formula_16
:formula_17

For example,

:formula_18

 800
 +120
 +140
 + 21
 1081

Note that this is the same thing as the conventional sum of partial products, just restated with brevity. To minimize the number of elements being retained in one&#x27;s memory, it may be convenient to perform the sum of the &quot;cross&quot; multiplication product first, and then add the other two elements:

:formula_19
:formula_20 [of which only the tens digit will interfere with the first term]
:formula_21

i.e., in this example
:(12 + 14) = 26, 26 × 10 = 260,
to which is it is easy to add 21: 281 and then 800: 1081

An easy mnemonic to remember for this would be FOIL. F meaning first, O meaning outer, I meaning inner and L meaning last. For example:

: formula_22

and

: formula_23

where 7 is &quot;a&quot;, 5 is &quot;b&quot;, 2 is &quot;c&quot; and 3 is &quot;d&quot;.

Consider

: formula_24

this expression is analogous to any number in base 10 with a hundreds, tens and ones place. FOIL can also be looked at as a number with F being the hundreds, OI being the tens and L being the ones.

formula_25 is the product of the first digit of each of the two numbers; F.

formula_26 is the addition of the product of the outer digits and the inner digits; OI.

formula_27 is the product of the last digit of each of the two numbers; L.

==== Multiplying by 9 ====
Since 9 = 10 − 1, to multiply a number by nine, multiply it by 10 and then subtract the original number from the result. For example, 9 × 27 = 270 − 27 = 243.

This method can be adjusted to multiply by eight instead of nine, by doubling the number being subtracted; 8 × 27 = 270 − (2×27) = 270 − 54 = 216.

Similarly, by adding instead of subtracting, the same methods can be used to multiply by 11 and 12, respectively (although simpler methods to multiply by 11 exist).

==== Multiplying by 11 ====
For single digit numbers simply duplicate the number into the tens digit, for example: 1 × 11 = 11, 2 × 11 = 22, up to 9 × 11 = 99.

The product for any larger non-zero integer can be found by a series of additions to each of its digits from right to left, two at a time.

First take the ones digit and copy that to the temporary result. Next, starting with the ones digit of the multiplier, add each digit to the digit to its left. Each sum is then added to the left of the result, in front of all others. If a number sums to 10 or higher take the tens digit, which will always be 1, and carry it over to the next addition. Finally copy the multipliers left-most (highest valued) digit to the front of the result, adding in the carried 1 if necessary, to get the final product.

In the case of a negative 11, multiplier, or both apply the sign to the final product as per normal multiplication of the two numbers.

A step-by-step example of 759 × 11:
# The ones digit of the multiplier, 9, is copied to the temporary result.
#* result: 9
# Add 5 + 9 = 14 so 4 is placed on the left side of the result and carry the 1.
#* result: 49
# Similarly add 7 + 5 = 12, then add the carried 1 to get 13. Place 3 to the result and carry the 1.
#* result: 349
# Add the carried 1 to the highest valued digit in the multiplier, 7 + 1 = 8, and copy to the result to finish.
#* Final product of 759 × 11: 8349

Further examples:
* −54 × −11 = 5 5+4(9) 4 = 594
* 999 × 11 = 9+1(10) 9+9+1(9) 9+9(8) 9 = 10989
** Note the handling of 9+1 as the highest valued digit.
* −3478 × 11 = 3 3+4+1(8) 4+7+1(2) 7+8(5) 8 = −38258
* 62473 × 11 = 6 6+2(8) 2+4+1(7) 4+7+1(2) 7+3(0) 3 = 687203

Another method is to simply multiply the number by 10, and add the original number to the result.

For example:

 17 × 11 = ?

 17 × 10 = 170
 170 + 17 = 187

 17 × 11 = 187

One last easy way:

If one has a two-digit number, take it and add the two numbers together and put that sum in the middle, and one can get the answer.

For example: 24 x 11 = 264 because 2 + 4 = 6 and the 6 is placed in between the 2 and the 4.

Second example: 87 x 11 = 957 because 8 + 7 = 15 so the 5 goes in between the 8 and the 7 and the 1 is carried to the 8. So it is basically 857 + 100 = 957.

Or if 43 x 11 is equal to first 4+3=7 (For the tens digit) Then 4 is for the hundreds and 3 is for the tens. And the answer is 473.

=== Calculating quotients: &quot;a&quot; ÷ &quot;b&quot; ===

In the same way that cross-multiplication can be utilized to reduce a large multiplication question to a series of basic arithmetical computations, the inverse of cross-multiplication --- cross-division --- can be used to reduce a division question to a series of manageable calculations.

=== Using square numbers ===

The products of small numbers may be calculated by using the squares of integers; for example, to calculate 13 × 17, one can remark 15 is the mean of the two factors, and think of it as (15 − 2) × (15 + 2), &quot;i.e.&quot; 152 − 22. Knowing that 152 is 225 and 22 is 4, simple subtraction shows that 225 − 4 = 221, which is the desired product.

This method requires knowing by heart a certain number of squares:

===Squaring numbers===

It may be useful to be aware that the difference between two successive square numbers is the sum of their respective square roots. Hence, if one knows that 12 × 12 = 144 and wish to know 13 × 13, calculate 144 + 12 + 13 = 169.

This is because (&quot;x&quot; + 1)2 − &quot;x&quot;2 = &quot;x&quot;2 + 2&quot;x&quot; + 1 − &quot;x&quot;2 = &quot;x&quot; + (&quot;x&quot; + 1)

&quot;x&quot;2 = (&quot;x&quot; − 1)2 + (2&quot;x&quot; − 1)

==== Squaring any number ====
Take a given number, and add and subtract a certain value to it that will make it easier to multiply. For example:

: 4922

492 is close to 500, which is easy to multiply by. Add and subtract 8 (the difference between 500 and 492) to get

: 492 -&gt; 484, 500

Multiply these numbers together to get 242,000 (This can be done efficiently by dividing 484 by 2 = 242 and multiplying by 1000). Finally, add the difference (8) squared (82 = 64) to the result:

: 4922 = 242,064

The proof follows:

: formula_28
: formula_29
: formula_30
: formula_31

====Squaring any 2-digit integer====

This method requires memorization of the squares of the one-digit numbers 1 to 9.

The square of &quot;mn&quot;, &quot;mn&quot; being a two-digit integer, can be calculated as

: 10 × &quot;m&quot;(&quot;mn&quot; + &quot;n&quot;) + &quot;n&quot;2

Meaning the square of &quot;mn&quot; can be found by adding &quot;n&quot; to &quot;mn&quot;, multiplied by &quot;m&quot;, adding 0 to the end and finally adding the square of &quot;n&quot;.

For example, 232:
: 232
: = 10 × 2(23 + 3) + 32
: = 10 × 2(26) + 9
: = 520 + 9
: = 529

So 232 = 529.

==== Squaring a number ending in 5 ====
#Take the digit(s) that precede the five: &quot;abc5&quot;, where &quot;a, b, &quot; and &quot;c&quot; are digits
# Multiply this number by itself plus one: &quot;abc&quot;(&quot;abc&quot; + 1)
# Take above result and attach &quot;25&quot; to the end
#* Example: 85 × 85
#*# 8
#*# 8 × 9 = 72
#*# So, 852 = 7,225
#* Example: 1252
#*# 12
#*# 12 × 13 = 156
#*# So, 1252 = 15,625
#* Mathematical explanation
==== Squaring numbers very close to 50 ====

Suppose one needs to square a number &quot;n&quot; near 50.

The number may be expressed as &quot;n&quot; = 50 − &quot;a&quot; so its square is (50−&quot;a&quot;)2 = 502 − 100&quot;a&quot; + &quot;a&quot;2. One knows that 502 is 2500. So one subtracts 100&quot;a&quot; from 2500, and then add &quot;a&quot;2.

For example, say one wants to square 48, which is 50 − 2. One subtracts 200 from 2500 and add 4, and get &quot;n&quot;2 = 2304. For numbers larger than 50 (&quot;n&quot; = 50 + &quot;a&quot;), add 100×&quot;a&quot; instead of subtracting it.

====Squaring an integer from 26 to 74====

This method requires the memorization of squares from 1 to 24.

The square of &quot;n&quot; (most easily calculated when &quot;n&quot; is between 26 and 74 inclusive) is

: (50 − &quot;n&quot;)2 + 100(&quot;n&quot; − 25)

In other words, the square of a number is the square of its difference from fifty added to one hundred times the difference of the number and twenty five. For example, to square 62:

: (−12)2 + [(62-25) × 100]
: = 144 + 3,700
: = 3,844

====Squaring an integer near 100 (e.g., from 76 to 124)====

This method requires the memorization of squares from 1 to &quot;a&quot; where &quot;a&quot; is the absolute difference between &quot;n&quot; and 100. For example, students who have memorized their squares from 1 to 24 can apply this method to any integer from 76 to 124.

The square of &quot;n&quot; (i.e., 100 ± &quot;a&quot;) is

: 100(100 ± 2&quot;a&quot;) + &quot;a&quot;2

In other words, the square of a number is the square of its difference from 100 added to the product of one hundred and the difference of one hundred and the product of two and the difference of one hundred and the number. For example, to square 93:

: 100(100 − 2(7)) + 72
: = 100 × 86 + 49
: = 8,600 + 49
: = 8,649

Another way to look at it would be like this:

: 932 = ? (is −7 from 100)
: 93 − 7 = 86 (this gives the first two digits)
: (−7)2 = 49 (these are the second two digits)
: 932 = 8649

Another example:
 822 = ? (is −18 from 100)
 82 − 18 = 64 (subtract. First digits.)
 (−18)2 = 324 (second pair of digits. One will need to carry the 3.)
 822 = 6724

==== Squaring any integer near 10&quot;n&quot; (e.g., 976 to 1024, 9976 to 10024, etc.) ====

This method is a straightforward extension of the explanation given above for squaring an integer near 100.
 10122 = ? (1012 is +12 from 1000)
 (+12)2 = 144 (&quot;n&quot; trailing digits)
 1012 + 12 = 1024 (leading digits)
 10122 = 1024144

 99972 = ? (9997 is -3 from 10000)
 (-3)2 = 0009 (&quot;n&quot; trailing digits)
 9997 - 3 = 9994 (leading digits)
 99972 = 99940009

==== Squaring any integer near &quot;m ×&quot; 10&quot;n&quot; (e.g., 276 to 324, 4976 to 5024, 79976 to 80024) ====

This method is a straightforward extension of the explanation given above for integers near 10&quot;n&quot;.
 4072 = ? (407 is +7 from 400)
 (+7)2 = 49 (&quot;n&quot; trailing digits)
 407 + 7 = 414
 414 × 4 = 1656 (leading digits; note this multiplication by &quot;m&quot; was not needed for integers from 76 to 124 because their &quot;m&quot; = 1)
 4072 = 165649

 799912 = ? (79991 is -9 from 80000)
 (-9)2 = 0081 (&quot;n&quot; trailing digits)
 79991 - 9
 79982 × 8 = 639856 (leading digits)
 799912 = 6398560081

=== Finding roots ===

==== Approximating square roots ====
An easy way to approximate the square root of a number is to use the following equation:

: formula_32

The closer the known square is to the unknown, the more accurate the approximation. For instance, to estimate the square root of 15, one could start with the knowledge that the nearest perfect square is 16 (42).

: formula_33

So the estimated square root of 15 is 3.875. The actual square root of 15 is 3.872983... One thing to note is that, no matter what the original guess was, the estimated answer will always be larger than the actual answer due to the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means. Thus, one should try rounding the estimated answer down.

Note that if &quot;n&quot;2 is the closest perfect square to the desired square &quot;x&quot; and &quot;d&quot; = &quot;x&quot; - &quot;n&quot;2 is their difference, it is more convenient to express this approximation in the form of mixed fraction as formula_34. Thus, in the previous example, the square root of 15 is formula_35 As another example, square root of 41 is formula_36 while the actual value is 6.4031...

It may simplify mental calculation to notice that this method is equivalent to the mean of the known square and the unknown square, divided by the known square root:
: formula_37

=====Derivation=====

By definition, if &quot;r&quot; is the square root of x, then

: formula_38

One then redefines the root

: formula_39

where &quot;a&quot; is a known root (4 from the above example) and &quot;b&quot; is the difference between the known root and the answer one seeks.

: formula_40

Expanding yields

: formula_41

If &#x27;a&#x27; is close to the target, &#x27;b&#x27; will be a small enough number to render the formula_42 element of the equation negligible. Thus, one can drop formula_42 out and rearrange the equation to

: formula_44

and therefore

: formula_45

that can be reduced to

: formula_46

Alternatively, this approach to square root approximation can be viewed as a single step of Newton&#x27;s method.

==== Extracting roots of perfect powers ====

Extracting roots of perfect powers is often practiced. The difficulty of the task does not depend on the number of digits of the perfect power but on the precision, i.e. the number of digits of the root. In addition, it also depends on the order of the root; finding perfect roots, where the order of the root is coprime with 10 are somewhat easier since the digits are scrambled in consistent ways, as in the next section.

=== Approximating common logarithms (log base 10)===
To approximate a common logarithm (to at least one decimal point accuracy), a few logarithm rules, and the memorization of a few logarithms is required. One must know:
*log(a × b) = log(a) + log(b)
*log(a / b) = log(a) - log(b)
*log(0) does not exist
*log(1) = 0
*log(2) ~ .30
*log(3) ~ .48
*log(7) ~ .85

From this information, one can find the logarithm of any number 1-9.
*log(1) = 0
*log(2) ~ .30
*log(3) ~ .48
*log(4) = log(2 × 2) = log(2) + log(2) ~ .60
*log(5) = log(10 / 2) = log(10) − log(2) ~ .70
*log(6) = log(2 × 3) = log(2) + log(3) ~ .78
*log(7) ~ .85
*log(8) = log(2 × 2 × 2) = log(2) + log(2) + log(2) ~ .90
*log(9) = log(3 × 3) = log(3) + log(3) ~ .96
*log(10) = 1 + log(1) = 1

The first step in approximating the common logarithm is to put the number given in scientific notation. For example, the number 45 in scientific notation is 4.5 × 101, but one will call it a × 10b. Next, find the logarithm of a, which is between 1 and 10. Start by finding the logarithm of 4, which is .60, and then the logarithm of 5, which is .70 because 4.5 is between these two. Next, and skill at this comes with practice, place a 5 on a logarithmic scale between .6 and .7, somewhere around .653 (NOTE: the actual value of the extra places will always be greater than if it were placed on a regular scale. i.e., one would expect it to go at .650 because it is halfway, but instead, it will be a little larger, in this case, .653) Once one has obtained the logarithm of a, simply add b to it to get the approximation of the common logarithm. In this case, a + b = 0.653 + 1 = 1.653. The actual value of log(45) ~ 1.65321.

The same process applies for numbers between 0 and 1. For example, 0.045 would be written as 4.5 × 10−2. The only difference is that b is now negative, so when adding one is really subtracting. This would yield the result 0.653 − 2 = −1.347.

<doc id="567323" wikidata="Q215987" url="?curid=567323" title="Senate (France)">
<text>The Senate (, ) is the upper house of the French Parliament, with the lower house being the National Assembly, the two houses constituting the legislature of France. It is made up of 348 senators (&quot;sénateurs&quot; and &quot;sénatrices&quot;) elected by part of the country&#x27;s local councillors in indirect elections. Senators have six-year terms, with half of the seats up for election every three years. They represent France&#x27;s departments (328), overseas collectivities (8) and citizens abroad (12).

Senators&#x27; mode of election varies upon their constituency&#x27;s population size: in the less populated constituencies (one or two seats), they are elected individually, whereas in more populated ones (three seats or more), they are elected on lists. It is common for senators to hold dual mandates, such as in a regional council or departmental council.

The Senate enjoys less prominence than the National Assembly, which is elected on direct universal ballot and upon the majority of which the Government relies: in case of disagreement, the Assembly can in many cases have the last word, although the Senate keeps a role in some key procedures, such as constitutional amendments. However, following the 2024 snap legislative election and the ensuing political fragmentation in the Assembly, the newly-outed Barnier government held a majority in the Senate but not in the Assembly, a first under the Fifth Republic, marking &quot;a form of strengthening of the Senate&quot;.

Bicameralism was first introduced in France amid the French Revolution in 1795; as in many countries, it assigned the upper chamber with the role of moderating the lower, although for a long time as an ally of the executive. The present selection mode of the Senate dates back to the start of the Third Republic, when it was turned into what Léon Gambetta famously called a &quot;grand council of the communes of France&quot;. Over time, it developed a sense of independence as a &quot;guardian of the institutions&quot; and &quot;guardian of liberties&quot;, favoured by the fact that senators are on average older than deputies in the Assembly, joining the Senate in the later part of their career. Debates in the Senate tend to be less tense and generally receive less media coverage. As a result of its election relying on what is often summed up as rural mayors, it has had a right-wing majority since 1958, with only a three-year exception in 2011–2014.

The President of the Senate is to step in as acting President of France in case of an incapacitation or a vacancy, which last happened in 1974. The officeholder also appoints three members of the Constitutional Council. Since 2014, Gérard Larcher has been President of the Senate.

The Senate is housed inside the Luxembourg Palace in the 6th arrondissement of Paris. Like the National Assembly, it is guarded by Republican Guards. In front of the building lies the Senate&#x27;s garden, the Jardin du Luxembourg, open to the public.

== History ==
France&#x27;s first experience with an upper house was under the Directory from 1795 to 1799, when the Council of Ancients was the upper chamber. There were Senates in both the First and Second Empires (the former being known as the , the latter as the French Senate), but these were only nominally legislative bodies – technically they were not legislative, but rather advisory bodies on the model of the Roman Senate.
With the Restoration in 1814, a new Chamber of Peers was created, on the model of the British House of Lords. At first it contained hereditary peers, but following the July Revolution of 1830, it became a body whose members were appointed for life. The Second Republic returned to a unicameral system after 1848, but soon after the establishment of the Second Empire in 1852, a Senate was established as the upper chamber. In the Fourth Republic, the Senate was replaced by the Council of the Republic, but its function was largely the same. With the new Constitution of the Fifth Republic which came into force on 4 October 1958, the older name of Senate was restored.

In 2011, the Socialist Party won control of the Senate for the first time since the foundation of the Fifth Republic. In 2014, the centre-right Gaullists and their allies won back the control of the Senate; they retained their majority in 2017.

== Powers ==
Under the Constitution of France, the Senate has nearly the same powers as the National Assembly. Bills may be submitted by the government (&quot;projets de loi&quot;) or by either house of Parliament (&quot;propositions de loi&quot;). Because both houses may amend the bill, it may take several readings to reach an agreement between the National Assembly and the Senate. When the Senate and the National Assembly cannot agree on a bill, the administration can decide, after a procedure called &quot;commission mixte paritaire&quot;, to give the final decision to the National Assembly, whose majority is normally on the government&#x27;s side, but as regarding the constitutional laws the administration must have the Senate&#x27;s agreement. This does not happen frequently; usually the two houses eventually agree on the bill, or the administration decides to withdraw it. This power however gives the National Assembly a prominent role in the law-making process, especially since the administration is necessarily of the same side as the Assembly, for the Assembly can dismiss the administration through a motion of censure.

The power to pass a vote of censure, or vote of no confidence, is limited. As was the case in the Fourth Republic&#x27;s constitution, new cabinets do not have to receive a vote of confidence. Also, a vote of censure can occur only after 10 per cent of the members sign a petition; if rejected, those members that signed cannot sign another petition until that session of Parliament has ended. If the petition gets the required support, a vote of censure must gain an absolute majority of all members, not just those voting. If the Assembly and the Senate have politically distinct majorities, the Assembly will in most cases prevail; open conflict between the two houses is uncommon.

As per article 24 of the Constitution, the Senate is the representative of the territories and defends the local elected officials. The Senate also serves to monitor the administration&#x27;s actions by publishing many reports each year on various topics.

== Composition ==
Until September 2004, the Senate had 321 members, each elected to serve for a nine-year term. In that month, the term was reduced to six years, while – to reflect a growth in the country&#x27;s population – the number of senators was set to increase progressively, to reach 348 by 2011. Senators had been elected in thirds every three years; this was also changed to one half of their number every three years.

=== President ===

The president of the Senate is elected by senators from among their members. The current incumbent is Gérard Larcher. The President of the Senate is, under the Constitution of the Fifth Republic, first in the line of succession—in case of death, resignation or removal from office (only for health reasons)—to the presidency of the French Republic, becoming Acting President of the Republic until a new election can be held. This happened twice for Alain Poher—once at the resignation of Charles de Gaulle and once at the death of Georges Pompidou.

The President of the Senate also has the right to designate three of the nine members of the Constitutional Council, serving for nine years.

=== Election ===

Senators are elected indirectly by approximately 150,000 officials, known as the &quot;grands électeurs&quot;, including regional councillors, department councillors, mayors, municipal councillors in large communes, as well as members of the National Assembly. However, 90% of the electors are delegates appointed by councillors. This system introduces a bias in the composition of the Senate favoring rural areas. As a consequence, while the political majority changes frequently in the National Assembly, the Senate has remained politically right, with one brief exception (2011–2014), since the foundation of the Fifth Republic, much to the displeasure of the Socialists.

This has spurred controversy, especially after the 2008 election in which the Socialist Party, despite controlling all but two of France&#x27;s regions, a majority of departments, as well as communes representing more than 50% of the population, still failed to achieve a majority in the Senate. The Senate has also been accused of being a &quot;refuge&quot; for politicians that have lost their seats in the National Assembly. The left, led by the Socialist Party, gained control of the Senate for the first time since 1958 during the 2011 election, leading to the election of Jean-Pierre Bel at its presidency. This proved a short-lived win, as the right, led by the Union for a Popular Movement, regained the Senate three years later.

=== Parliamentary groups ===
== Criticism ==

As an indirectly elected house, the Senate is often criticised by political parties such as La France Insoumise on the left and the National Rally on the right as not being sufficiently popularly representative. Although both La France Insoumise and the National Rally enjoy significant representation in the National Assembly, they are far less represented in the Senate, as they do not have a large number of local councillors affiliated with them, who in turn elect the senators.

The left has historically opposed the very existence of a second chamber, while the right has defended it; controversies over the Senate&#x27;s role are revived from time to time. The common phrase &quot;a senator&#x27;s pace&quot; (&quot;un train de sénateur&quot;) mocks the upper house&#x27;s perceived slow rhythm and readiness to let new legislation die.

<doc id="567339" wikidata="Q1093415" url="?curid=567339" title="Citizen Fish">
<text>Citizen Fish are an English punk rock band that has been active since 1990 and shares members with Subhumans. Citizen Fish does not emphasize the raw political statements and nihilistic viewpoint of the former, instead focusing on issues of social alienation and human interaction, viewed through a more optimistic lens. Both bands deal with themes such as anti-consumerism and vegetarianism.

==History==
Based around Bath, England, the original members were Dick Lucas (vocals), Jasper (bass), Trotsky (drums), and Larry (guitar). Following their first album, &quot;Free Souls in a Trapped Environment&quot;, Larry left the band and was replaced by Phil, who, along with Dick and Trotsky, had previously been a member of the Subhumans. Jasper and Dick had previously played together in Culture Shock.

In July 2006, Silas (formerly of Bath-based band Cooper S with Jasper and Andy Evans) replaced Trotsky on drums. In the following month, after a five-year recording hiatus, the band returned to the studio to record songs for a split album with the New York band Leftöver Crack, &quot;Deadline&quot;.

Their latest and eighth full-length studio album, 2011&#x27;s &quot;Goods&quot; was hailed as a return to form, and they remain active, releasing the &quot;Manmade&quot; EP in 2015.

<text>Allen Ravenstine (born May 9, 1950) is an American keyboard player, most recognized for his work in the experimental rock group Pere Ubu. In 1991, he quit music to become a commercial airline pilot.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
Allen Ravenstine was born on May 9, 1950. He had much exposure to music at a young age, his interest derived from his mother playing Sergei Rachmaninoff and other classical music and his father&#x27;s interest in jazz and percussion records. He played the trombone in grade school but quickly lost interest. Ravenstine&#x27;s first real experience as an artist came in 1971 after abandoning his college pursuits. He met visual artist Bob Bensick, who was experimenting with sending distortion into oscillators and out to a stereo system. Eventually, they discovered a way to attach lights and have them work in conjunction with the sounds being produced and decided to stage art shows. The act was short lived as Ravenstine moved out of the area and lost contact with Bensick. Soon after, Ravenstine purchased his first synthesizer, an ElectroComp EML 200, and began associating with the garage band Rocket from the Tombs and recording their performances.

Ravenstine owned the apartment building called &quot;The Plaza&quot;, which served as home and gathering place for the developing art and music scene in Cleveland in the early 70s.

=== Pere Ubu ===
Ravenstine first worked with Pere Ubu in 1975 after being asked to contribute to the band&#x27;s recording of &quot;30 Seconds Over Tokyo&quot;. However, he was discouraged by the thought of having to perform live shows and opted to discontinue his involvement with the band. After watching Pere Ubu perform at a few venues, Ravenstine changed his mind and returned as a full-time member of the band, replacing keyboardist Dave Taylor. He continued his work with Pere Ubu until 1989 with the release of &quot;Cloudland&quot;, when he decided to leave the group and pursue his own interests.

===Later life===
Ravenstine obtained a pilot&#x27;s license after Ubu&#x27;s initial breakup, and after leaving the band permanently, worked as a flight instructor and charter pilot. He also completed a novel which was never published. Ravenstine largely avoided musical activity of any kind after leaving Pere Ubu, once making a guest appearance at a Red Krayola show in Los Angeles in 2004. In 2012, an invitation to contribute to &quot;I Dream of Wires: The Modular Synthesizer Documentary&quot; led to the recording of an impromptu duo performance on the EML-101 and 200 synthesizers, with current Ubu synthesist Robert Wheeler. Culled from this were a pair of albums and singles, entitled &quot;City Desk/Farm Report&quot;, which were self-released in 2013. On June 29, 2018, he released a solo album entitled &quot;Waiting for the Bomb&quot; on Recommended Records.

== Influence ==
In reviewing &quot;Dub Housing&quot;, critic John Dougan writes, &quot;Ravenstine, who may be one of the all-time great synth players colors the sound with ominous whooshes of distortions, blips, and blurbs that sound like a sped-up Pong game.&quot;

<text>&quot;To A Louse, On Seeing One on a Lady&#x27;s Bonnet at Church&quot; is a 1786 Scots language poem by Robert Burns in his favourite meter, standard Habbie. The poem&#x27;s theme is contained in the final verse:
In the eight-stanza satirical poem, the speaker draws the reader&#x27;s attention to a lady in church with a louse that is roving, unnoticed by her, around in her bonnet. In the course of the poem, the speaker addresses the louse as it scurries about on &quot;Jenny&quot; who cluelessly tosses her hair and preens, not knowing the person seeing her sees a louse on her. In this last stanza, the speaker reflects on what a gift it would be for us to be able to see ourselves as others see us. How we walk and how we put on airs all would vanish. Not only that, even devotion (i.e., romance) would vanish.

<text>Pere Ubu is an American rock group formed in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1975. The band had a variety of long-term and recurring band members, with singer David Thomas being the only member staying throughout the band&#x27;s lifetime. They released their debut album &quot;The Modern Dance&quot; in 1978 and followed with several more LPs before disbanding in 1982. Thomas reformed the group in 1987, continuing to record and tour.

Describing their sound as &quot;avant-garage,&quot; Pere Ubu&#x27;s work drew inspiration from sources such as musique concrète, 60s rock, performance art, and the industrial environments of the American Midwest. While the band achieved little commercial success, they have exerted a wide influence on subsequent underground music.

==History==
===1970s===
Rocket from the Tombs was a Cleveland-based group that eventually fragmented: some members formed the Dead Boys, and others The Saucers, while David Thomas and guitarist Peter Laughner joined with guitarist Tom Herman, bass guitarist Tim Wright, drummer Scott Krauss and synthesist Allen Ravenstine to form Pere Ubu in 1975. At the time the band formed, Herman, Krauss, and Ravenstine lived in a house owned by Ravenstine. The group&#x27;s name is a reference to &quot;Ubu Roi&quot;, an avant-garde play by French writer Alfred Jarry.

Pere Ubu&#x27;s debut single (their first four records were singles on their own &quot;Hearpen&quot; label) was &quot;30 Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; (inspired by the &quot;Doolittle Raid&quot; and named after a film depicting the raid), backed with &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;; followed by &quot;Final Solution&quot; in 1976. One review noted that &quot;30 Seconds&quot; &quot;was clearly the work of a garage band, yet its arty dissonance and weird experimentalism were startlingly unique.&quot;
Laughner left the group after their first two singles, and died soon afterwards of acute pancreatic failure.

====Other recordings of the 1970s====
&quot;Street Waves&quot; b/w &quot;My Dark Ages (I Don&#x27;t Get Around)&quot; was their third single, and after their fourth single, &quot;The Modern Dance&#x27;&quot; b/w &quot;Heaven&quot; (which was pressed in very small quantities and contained a completely different mix of &quot;Modern Dance&quot; from the album version), Pere Ubu signed to Blank Records, a short-lived imprint of Mercury Records.

Tony Maimone signed on as bassist after Tim Wright left to join DNA.

Their debut album, &quot;The Modern Dance&quot; (1978), sold poorly, but has proven influential. Musicians of many types, including progressive rock, punk rock, post punk and new wave, were influenced by the dark, abstract record. With the song &quot;Sentimental Journey,&quot; the debut also introduced the practice of re-appropriating titles from well-known popular songs: Pere Ubu&#x27;s &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot; has no obvious relation to the Doris Day hit song of the same name; &quot;Drinking Wine Spodyody&quot; has no apparent connection to the Sticks McGhee song (later revived by Jerry Lee Lewis). This practice has continued through 2006&#x27;s &quot;Why I Hate Women&quot;, which has a song called &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (again, no relation to the 1963 hit song by Bobby Vinton).

While most synthesizer players tended to play the instrument as they would a piano or organ, Ravenstine generally opted instead to make sounds that were reminiscent of spooky sound effects from 1950s science fiction films, or perhaps electronic music and musique concrète. One critic writes that Ravenstine &quot;may be one of the all-time great synth players&quot; and his playing has been called &quot;utterly original&quot;.

The group briefly disbanded in 1979, but reformed soon afterwards with Herman replaced by Mayo Thompson (of Red Krayola).

===1980s===
&quot;The Art of Walking&quot; (1980) featured Thompson on guitar. For the next original album, &quot;Song of the Bailing Man&quot; (1982), Krauss was replaced by Anton Fier.

The group disbanded again soon afterwards; Krauss and Maimone formed Home and Garden, while Thomas worked on a solo career, notably with Richard Thompson and with members of Henry Cow.

By the late 1980s, one of Thomas&#x27;s solo projects eventually featured much of Pere Ubu. The band was reformed again in 1987, with Jim Jones and Chris Cutler joining for the release of &quot;The Tenement Year&quot; (1988), a far more pop-oriented album than ever before. The following year, &quot;Waiting for Mary&quot; (off &quot;Cloudland&quot;) appeared on MTV briefly. After the recording of &quot;Cloudland&quot;, Ravenstine left the group (although he made a guest appearance on &quot;Worlds in Collision&quot;) and later became an airline pilot. Eric Drew Feldman joined the band in time for the Cloudland tour and the recording of &quot;Worlds in Collision&quot;, but left afterwards, joining Frank Black.

===1990s===
In 1993, &quot;Story of My Life&quot; was released. Maimone left (once again) to join They Might Be Giants, and Michele Temple and Garo Yellin joined the band for the &quot;Story of My Life&quot; tour and feature on Ubu&#x27;s 1995 album, &quot;Ray Gun Suitcase&quot;. Robert Wheeler has played synthesizer and theremin with Pere Ubu since 1994. Krauss left the band during the &quot;Ray Gun Suitcase&quot; sessions. For the &quot;Ray Gun Suitcase&quot; tour, guitarist Jim Jones departed as a &quot;touring&quot; member (although he continued to contribute to recordings), founding guitarist Tom Herman replaced him for the tour.

Concurrent with the 1996 release of the &quot;Datapanik in Year Zero&quot; box set, Jim Jones retired due to health problems. Tom Herman returned to the band after a twenty-year absence to tour with the band in 1995, and went on to record &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; (1998), which also featured guitar contributions from Jim Jones. Guitarist Wayne Kramer of MC5 fame joined the band for their 1998 summer tour.

===2000–2010===
While much of 2000 was given over to live performances by Thomas&#x27;s side projects - David Thomas and Two Pale Boys (Andy Diagram and Keith Moliné) and The Pale Orchestra - Pere Ubu played a gig bannered &#x27;55 Years of Pain&#x27; in June at the Cleveland Rock and Roll Hall of Fame alongside 15-60-75. The band then teamed up in September 2000 with special guest Wayne Kramer for another performance of &#x27;55 Years of Pain&#x27;. This time at the Royal Festival Hall, Southbank, London.

Although Pere Ubu took a break from touring in 2001, they worked on material for a new album. Thomas also devoted himself for much of the year to live performance. This included his theatrical project &#x27;Mirror Man (A Geography of Sound in Two Acts)&#x27; as well as an extensive David Thomas and Two Pale Boys European and US tour. In February, The trio were also asked to support Goth band the Sisters of Mercy at five concerts in England. Founding member Andrew Eldritch had long cited Pere Ubu and David Thomas as a key musical influence.Speaking in 2016, Eldritch said: &quot;I remember seeing the best gig I ever saw in my life which was Pere Ubu supported by the Human League on the tiny stage of the F Club in Leeds [December, 7 1978].&quot;

&quot;St. Arkansas&quot; was released on 20 May 2002 on Glitterhouse Records. The group comprised David Thomas, Tom Herman, Robert Wheeler, Michele Temple and Steve Mehlman. Jim Jones again contributed guitar parts. In September 2002 the band undertook the 11 date &#x27;Mighty Road Tour in American and Canada. Tom Herman left again in late 2002, being replaced by Keith Moliné from David Thomas and Two Pale Boys. That same year, Thomas and Moliné were joined by Robert Wheeler, Michele Temple and Chris Cutler. They performed a live soundtrack to a 3-D screening of &#x27;It Came from Outer Space&#x27; at the Royal Festival Hall, London on October 9, 2002. This performance direction reflected a formative influence on Pere Ubu and Thomas&#x27;s long-held affection for B-Movies. 2002 was also marked by an officially release, on Feb 1, of Rocket From the Tombs&#x27; recordings on Smog Veil Records. While bootlegs of varying quality had long circulated &quot;The Day The Earth Met The Rockets From the Tombs&quot;&#x27; drew on original rehearsal and concert masters from 1974.

Pere Ubu&#x27;s &#x27;Mighty Road&#x27; tour resumed in February 2003 with 10 dates in the US. 2003 was also notable for performances in the summer and winter across the US and Canada by a revived Rocket From The Tombs. The band comprised David Thomas, Cheetah Chrome, Craig Bell, Richard Lloyd and Steve Mehlman. Of the 33 dates, one at the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland was a benefit for an increasingly ill Jim Jones. Richard Lloyd recorded and engineered live in the studio performances of the original Rockets&#x27; songs. Originally, &#x27;Rocket Redux&#x27; was sold as gig-only merchandise until it was commercially released the following year by Smog Veil Records.

Live film accompaniment came to the fore again for Pere Ubu in 2004. Firstly, the group premiered its underscore to at the &#x27;Celebrate Brooklyn&#x27; festival on 22 July. The winter of that year also saw a UK tour that revived the band&#x27;s live underscoring of &#x27;It Came from Outer Space&#x27;. American music producer Hal Willner also invited David Thomas to join two shows. The first took place on April 1 in Los Angeles, &#x27;Let&#x27;s Eat - Feasting on The Firesign Theatre&#x27;, a celebration of the anarchic comedy outfit of that name. The cast included George Wendt, John Goodman, Todd Rundgren, Chloe Webb and Loudon Wainwright among others.

Just over three weeks later Thomas, partnered by the Paleboys, joined Hal Willner&#x27;s tribute to director Federico Fellini and composer Nino Rota. &#x27;Perfect Partners&#x27; took place at London&#x27;s Barbican Theatre and the production also featured Carla Bley, Roy Nathanson, Roger Eno, Kate St John, Beth Orton and Geri Allen. 2004 also saw Pere Ubu support Spiritualized at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall on 1 August, Rocket From The Tombs played Kassel in Germany on 25 September and David Thomas and Two Pale Boys performed extensively in Europe and America with the release in April of &quot;18 Monkeys On A Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; (Smog Veil Records and Glitterhouse Records).

During the spring, Fall and winter of 2005, Pere Ubu toured a show dubbed &#x27;Live Free or Diet&#x27; as well as other concerts across America and Europe. Additionally, the band performed their live underscore to screenings of : April 9 at the Byrd Theatre, Richmond Virginia; August 12 at the Museum of Contemporary Art in North Adams, Massachusetts and November 5 at the Regent Square Theater in Pittsburgh.

2005 also saw David Thomas join Wayne Kramer and the newly monikered DKT-MC5 as well as the Sun Ra Arkestra on 25 February at the Royal Festival Hall London. When Patti Smith organised the &#x27;Meltdown Festival&#x27; in June at the Royal Festival Hall, London she invited Thomas to take part. He sang, with accompaniment from the London Sinfonietta, Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill&#x27;s &#x27;Alabama Song&#x27;. And, as was now becoming customary when the band was not on the road, Pere Ubu guitarist Keith Moliné joined David Thomas with trumpeter Andy Diagram for a series of improvisational gigs across Europe.

From May until the end of 2006 Pere Ubu gigged in Europe and America. On October 29 at the Royce Hall, Los Angeles, the group delivered a double bill consisting of that year&#x27;s concert set and their live underscore to a screening of . There was also a nine date Rocket from the Tombs American tour in the summer and Fall.

On 19 September 2006 Pere Ubu released &quot;Why I Hate Women&quot; on Smog Veil Records. The band was Thomas, Moliné, Wheeler, Temple and Mehlan with contributions from Robert and Jack Kidney, Rodolphe Burger and Andy Diagram. Thomas had teamed up with Burger earlier in the summer for four dates in France. In October, Smog Veil Records and Glitterhouse Records issued &quot;Why I Remix Women&quot; a set of band reworkings of the original tracks by Thomas, Moliné and Temple. Gagarin, an electronica instrumentalist and drummer for Nico during the 1980s, had worked for several years as live sound man for Pere Ubu as well as providing occasional on-stage contributions . His remix of &#x27;Blue Velvet&#x27; was included on the album.

In the spring of 2007, Pere Ubu hit the road once more, with six dates in America, 20 in Europe and followed in the Fall with four shows in the US and Canada. Work also started in 2007 on adapting, for performance, Alfred Jarry&#x27;s &#x27;Ubu Roi&#x27;, the play that had inspired the band&#x27;s name.

In December 2007, the download site Hearpen.com was launched providing live recordings and hard-to-source material by Pere Ubu and related acts.

During February and March 2008 Pere Ubu toured Europe and America. This included two live underscorings of : March 24 at the Neighborhood Theater, Charlotte, North Carolina and March 25 at the Plaza Theater, Atlanta, Georgia.

On February 18, 2008, Jim Jones, former guitarist, associate of the band from its earliest days and US manager for many years of the group&#x27;s online store, died at his Cleveland residence.

On April 24, 2008, the Ether festival at London&#x27;s South Bank Centre hosted the world premiere of &quot;Bring Me The Head of Ubu Roi&quot;. This adaptation by David Thomas of Alfred Jarry&#x27;s play &quot;Ubu Roi&quot; was accompanied by animations by the Brothers Quay. The production featured David Thomas as Pere Ubu and Sarah Jane Morris as Mere Ubu with the rest of the band playing various roles.

Back in 2006 musical producer Hal Willner had gathered together a host of musicians and actors for a double CD &quot;Rogue&#x27;s Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs, and Chanteys.&quot; In the summer of 2008, Willner brought a three date live show of the work to the UK and Ireland. David Thomas who had contributed versions of &#x27;Dan Dan&#x27; and &#x27;The Drunken Sailor&#x27; to the album joined the cast along with Pere Ubu guitarist Keith Moliné for all performances.

In 2009, &quot;Bring Me The Head of Ubu Roi&quot; was staged once again; this time at the Animator Festival, Poznań, Poland on July 11. The band&#x27;s new album, &quot;Long Live Père Ubu!&quot;, released September 14 on Cooking Vinyl Records with the American release issued on Hearpen Records. The disc reprised the Ubu Roi story. Sarah Jane Morris guested on the disc as did Ubu&#x27;s sound man Gagarin. The rest of the band comprised: Thomas, Moliné, Wheeler, Temple and Mehlman. During the Fall and winter the group toured extensively in Europe including material from the new album.

From February 2010, the band continued to tour the new album in the United Kingdom under the banner &#x27;Long Live Père Ubu! - The Spectacle&#x27;. The concert show also had its American première on 28 March in New York. The band also performed debut album &quot;The Modern Dance&quot; in its entirety, firstly, at the Cleveland Beachland Ballroom, March 5 then on March 24 at Chicago&#x27;s Lincoln Hall.

David Thomas once more joined the cast of Hal Willner&#x27;s live show &quot;Rogue&#x27;s Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs, and Chanteys.&quot; Thomas followed that show at the Sydney Opera House, Australia on January 28 with a concert of Pere Ubu songs, again in Sydney, on January 31 where he was backed by local band The Holy Soul. Thomas also revived his spoken word set &#x27;the Ghost Line Diaries&#x27;, originally aired at the 14th Genoa International Poetry Festival, Genoa, Italy, on June 19, 2008. Three gigs took place: Copenhagen, Denmark on October 9; Boston, USA on October 23 and in Geneva, Switzerland on December 5.

===2011–2020===
On March 19, 2011, Tom Herman, guitarist from the first Pere Ubu line up joined the band for a show at The Beachland Ballroom, Cleveland. The set included a full performance of &#x27;The Modern Dance&#x27; album. Between March and August the group played a further 18 shows in Europe incorporating &quot;The Modern Dance&quot; in a number of them. In April, David Thomas joined fellow Rocket From the Tombs musician Cheetah Chrome for the &#x27;Cleveland Confidential Book Tour&#x27;: April 11, Cleveland Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum; and April 14, The Grammy Museum, Los Angeles. A new Rocket from the Tombs album, &#x27;Barfly&#x27; appeared in September on Fire Records and Smog Veil Records. The band was: David Thomas; Cheetah Chrome; Craig Bell; Richard Lloyd and Steve Mehlman and they played seven dates in the USA throughout December.

2011 also marked the first live underscoring to a screening of &#x27;Carnival of Souls&#x27;, a horror film directed in 1962 by Herk Harvey. David Thomas and Two Pale Boys debuted the project at Cafe Oto, London on February 12, followed by further performances at Cinéma L&#x27;Univers, Lille, France (June 4) and the Duke of York&#x27;s Picture House, Brighton, England (December 2).

David Thomas and The Two Pale Boys were invited once more (as in February 2001) to support the Sisters of Mercy, this time playing at the Goth band&#x27;s 30th anniversary gig in their home town of Leeds, February 2011.

While work started on a new Pere Ubu album in 2012 - tracks in progress appearing on the band&#x27;s website &#x27;Ubu Projex&#x27; throughout the year - there were no live performances by the band. A scheduled 16-date Rocket From the Tombs tour in May 2012 was disrupted when David Thomas fell ill. The first eight gigs in Europe were cancelled, six took place before Thomas became ill again resulting in the cancellation of the final two dates. However, the band played five gigs in America and Canada in October of that year.

In 2012, Thomas published &#x27;The Book of Hieroglyphs&#x27;, in which he ruminated on America and the nature of being an American. The book drew on lyrics from Pere Ubu, The Two Pale Boys and other Thomas works, supplemented by a number of essays.

The Pere Ubu long player &quot;Lady from Shanghai&quot; was released, January 7, 2013, on Fire Records. Its title referenced &#x27;The Lady from Shanghai&#x27;, a film noir made in 1947 by Orson Welles. The band comprised David Thomas; Keith Moliné; Michele Temple; Robert Wheeler; Steve Mehlman and Gagarin. Clarinettist Darryl Boon guested on the disc. A book, &#x27;Chinese Whispers The Making of Pere Ubu&#x27;s &#x27;Lady from Shanghai&#x27;, was published at the same time. This included an account of the creation of the album modelled on the parlour game Chinese Whispers.

On February 17, 2013, Pere Ubu performed the &#x27;Modern Dance&#x27; album in full at the &#x27;I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror&#x27; festival in Melbourne, Australia. A production of Bring Me The Head of Ubu Roi: Chamber Version&#x27; aired on March 8 in Lodz, Poland. This small cast version of the play featured Thomas, Gagarin, Malgosia Sady and Kiersty Boon.

An 11-date Pere Ubu tour of England followed in April 2013. A further gig in London on June 16 launched a European tour in June and July. Then on July 13, as part of the East End Film Festival, the band once more performed their live underscore to Carnival of Souls. In September, Pere Ubu played 17 dates in America and Canada. Protracted discussions with the US Customs and Immigration Service had preceded the tour but visas were denied to Keith Moliné and Gagarin. David Cintron guitarist with a number of Cleveland bands including the Terminal Lovers took Moliné&#x27;s place. However, at a number of the shows Gagarin performed by video link from his studio in London.

Three dates followed in Europe during November before the band played several gigs in the UK and Ireland under the heading of the &#x27;Visions of the Moon tour&#x27;. The set that featured some of the material that would appear on the &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; album.

On August 4, 2013, Tim Wright, bassist in the original Pere Ubu line up, died at the age of 63.

Pere Ubu&#x27;s first performance of 2014 was at the Sons d&#x27;hiver festival in Creteil, France on February 15. On September 8 &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; was released on Fire Records. The album had its musical roots in the live accompaniment that both Pere Ubu and David Thomas and Two Pale Boys had performed for a number of years to screenings of the Herk Harvey B-movie of that name. The band comprised: David Thomas; Keith Moliné; Michele Temple; Robert Wheeler; Steve Mehlman; Gagarin;and Darryl Boon. As with &#x27;Lady From Shanghai&#x27;, a book was published to coincide with the new album. &#x27;Cogs The Making of Carnival Of Souls&#x27; contained essays by David Thomas, commentary from the musicians and album lyrics.

On September 12, the Pere Ubu Fim Group (on this occasion Thomas, Keith Moliné, Gagarin and Darryl Boon) performed their live underscore to Carnival of Souls at the L&#x27;Étrange Festival, Forum des Images in Paris, France.

The band embarked on a 13 date UK tour in November 2013 with support from the Pere Ubu Moon Unit (consisting of Thomas and other members of the main band). The 12th gig was an underscoring to Roger Corman&#x27;s &#x27;&#x27; at the Cinecity Brighton Film Festival on November 23. Between November 27 and December 6 the group played nine dates across mainland Europe. In 2015, Fire Records issued a mini-album of the Moon Unit&#x27;s November 21 performance in Leeds, England.

From late January 2015 until the end of February, the group continued touring in Europe with material from &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; with the Pere Ubu Moon Unit often providing support. Five dates in July in the UK were followed by a show at the New Horizons International Film Festival in Wroclaw, Poland on July 26. On August 21 Fire Records issued a four disc remastred vinyl box set, &quot;Elitism For the People 1975-1978.&quot; This comprised the Hearpen singles, &quot;The Modern Dance&quot;, &quot;Dub Housing&quot; and a live recording from 1977, made in New York at Max&#x27;s Kansas City. A new Rocket from the Tombs disc &quot;Black Record&quot; appeared on November 21, again on Fire Records. The band was Thomas; Craig Bell; Gary Siperko; Buddy Akita; and Steve Mehlman with contributions from Akita&#x27;s colleagues from This Moment In Black History: Lamont Thomas; Lawrence Caswell; and Chris Kulcsar.

Rocket From The Tombs played eight American dates in December 2015 followed by a show at the State-X New Forms Festival in Den Haag, Netherlands. After two appearances in England the band returned to Europe performing in Diksmuide, Belgium and at the Festival Les Aventuriers, in Paris on December 16.

On February 6, 2016, the Pere Ubu Film Unit delivered its live underscore once more to Carnival of Souls. This time, a dubbed in Spanish and colorized version of the film was screened at the Universitat Jaume I in Castelló de la Plana, Spain. Fire Records&#x27; release on March 18 of the second archival box set - &quot;Architecture of Language 1979-1982&quot; (vinyl remasters of New Picnic Time, The Art of Walking, Song of the Bailing Man and &quot;Architectural Salvage&quot; a disc of live and alternate mixes) prompted a tour drawing on songs from 1975 to 1982. Tom Herman rejoined the touring band and selected the material for the set list.

The Coed Jail! debuted on March 22, 2016, at the Ruby Lounge in Manchester, England. It ran for most of the year - there was a break in the Fall - 43 dates in total in Europe, Canada and America ending on December 10 in the Casbah, San Diego, California. The name reprised the set of gigs that Pere Ubu performed in February 1978 alongside the Suicide Commandos. Johnny Dromette (John Thompson) record store manager, promoter, designer and housemate of Thomas, had coined the phrase for the game show set he had built over night in their living room. Dromette created the first posters for the band and designed the &quot;Datapanik in Year Zero&quot; ep cover He has often provided poster, tee-shirt and packaging design as well as video production work throughout Pere Ubu&#x27;s career. His recollections of the time are shared in two interviews on Pere Ubu&#x27;s own UbuDub podcast series.

Splinter group Pere Ubu (Moon Unit) also made three appearances in 2016, one in London (Aug 25 with support from David Thomas and Two Pale Boys) and two in France (Nantes, August 27 and Brest, November 19).

The final box sets in Fire Records&#x27; series of vinyl remasters appeared in the Spring of 2017. &quot;Les Haricots Sont Pas Salés 1987-1991,&quot; April 6, contained The Tenement Year, Cloudland, Worlds In Collision and &quot;Songs From the Lost Album&quot;. &quot;Drive, He Said 1994-2002&quot; followed on May 26. It comprised Ray Gun Suitcase, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;, St. Arkansas and &quot;Back Roads&quot;, a disc of outtakes and alternate mixes.

Rocket From the Tombs played the Beachland Tavern, Cleveland on May 11, 2017, and the Ace Of Cups in Columbus, Ohio on May 13. Both Rocket From the Tombs and Pere Ubu performed at the Austin Jukebox, a regular multi band show event, in Austin Texas, on May 19 and 20 respectively.

A repeat of the Coed Jail! set took place in Jarocin, Poland on July 15. The band on this occasion was: David Thomas; Gary Siperko; Robert Wheeler; Michele Temple; and Steve Mehlman. A recording of the concert would provide the bulk of the 2020 release, on Cherry Red Records, &quot;By Order of Mayor Pawlicki (Live in Jarocin).&quot; Pere Ubu (Moon Unit) played seven European dates in August and October.

At the end of September, Pere Ubu released &quot;20 Years In A Montana Missile Silo&quot; on Cherry Red Records. The band was: David Thomas; Keith Molinè; Gary Siperko; Kristof Hahn (of The Swans); Darryl Boon; Robert Wheeler; Gagarin; Michele Temple; and Steve Mehlman. Welsh-Iranian artist Roshi Nasehi provided backing vocal to &#x27;I Can Still See&#x27;.

The &#x27;MonkeyNet Tour&#x27; in support of the new album, began in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on November 8, 2017. Thirteen more US performances took place before David Thomas became seriously ill resulting in the cancellation of seven concerts on the West Coast of America.

Marking their return to live performance in Spring 2018, Pere Ubu mounted the &#x27;Grand Guignol&#x27; show at The Borderline in London. A nine-piece band took to the stage on May 19: David Thomas; Keith Moliné; Gary Siperko; Robert Wheeler; Gagarin; Michele Temple; Steve Mehlman; Darryl Boon; and Kristof Hahn. For the rest of May and start of June a more regular-sized band played 12 dates across Europe. The &#x27;MonkeyNet Tour&#x27; then resumed with shows in New York (August 17) and Providence, Rhode Island (Aug 18). Five dates followed in September in Italy and one appearance in Tel Aviv (September 15).

Following the critical illness that had prematurely ended the original &#x27;MonkeyNet&#x27; tour, Thomas initiated work, early in 2018, on a new Pere Ubu album. While still a work in progress by the end of the year, the plan was to include versions of three tracks at two Pere Ubu (Moon Unit) shows in December. As recounted in the sleeve notes that accompany &quot;The Long Goodbye,&quot; keyboardist Gagarin suggested, two days before the first gig, that the outfit perform the album in its entirety. The material aired on December 7 at the Music Hall in Ramsgate, England. The band comprised Thomas, Keith Moliné, Gagarin and Chris Cutler. The group repeated the set the following evening at the Théâtre Municipal Berthelot in Montreuil on the outskirts of Paris, a performance eventually issued as a companion disc to &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; CD.

A few days after the Montreuil gig, David Thomas fell seriously ill again, was hospitalized and began a period of extensive recovery in 2019. However, &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; was completed and released, July 12, on Cherry Red Records. The band was: David Thomas; Keith Moliné; Gagarin; Robert Wheeler; Michele Temple; Darryl Boon; and P. O. Jørgens. Guitarist Gary Siperko also guested. Once more a book accompanied the new album. &quot;Baptized Into the Buzz&quot; contained information about the new album and the related 2017 record that Thomas had made with Danish percussionist P. O. Jørgens: &quot;Live Free or Die&quot; on Ninth World Music. There were lyrics to both releases, commentary from musicians and a short piece of family biography by Thomas.

Pere Ubu toured &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; late in 2019. Seven dates, spread over September, October and November, that took in London, Ireland, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy. The band began 2020 with a performance at the Centro Conde Duque Arts in Madrid. The day before, January 15, David Thomas ran a workshop, &#x27;How To Be A Singer&#x27;, in partnership with the band&#x27;s drummer Chris Cutler. However, further dates scheduled for 2020 were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing lockdown. In response, in May The Avant Garage Fan Attic (Official) launched on subscription platform Patreon. The exclusive content includes Datapanik TV (DPKTV), a channel of live broadcasts hosted by David Thomas.

===2021–present===
On February 11, 2022, the group played a one-off performance called &quot;Pere Ubu&#x27;s Canterbury Tales&quot; at The University of Kent&#x27;s Gulbenkain Theater in Canterbury. The group&#x27;s line-up for this was show included Thomas, Moliné, Gagarin, Cutler and new member Alex Ward on guitar and clarinet. David Thomas and The Two Pale Boys (Moliné, Gagarin, and Andy Diagram for this performance) played an opening set, as did Rats On Rafts, who performed a live cover of Pere Ubu’s &quot;Visions Of The Moon.&quot; The show was emceed by Bob Holman of the Bowery Poetry Club in New York City.

A new vinyl remasters box set, &quot;Nuke The Whales: 2006-2014&quot; was released by Fire on April 1, 2022. The box set, packaged in the same style as the previous box sets, features &quot;Why I Hate Women&quot; (retitled &quot;Why I Luv Women&quot;), &quot;Lady From Shanghai&quot;, &quot;Long Live Pere Ubu!&quot; and &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot;. All of the albums except &quot;Long Live Pere Ubu!&quot; were remixed by David Thomas in 2021, and &quot;Why I Luv Women&quot; and &quot;Long Live Pere Ubu!&quot; make their vinyl debuts via this set..

==Style==
Despite their association with genres such as art punk and post-punk, and despite being influenced by key proto-punk acts like the Velvet Underground, the Stooges, and MC5, Thomas has denied the association with punk rock, stating that Pere Ubu are &quot;just a rock band.&quot;

To define their music, Pere Ubu coined the term &quot;avant-garage&quot; to reflect interest in both experimental avant-garde music, especially musique concrète, and raw, direct blues-influenced garage rock. Thomas has stated the term is &quot;a joke invented to have something to give journalists when they yelp for a neat sound bite or pigeonhole&quot;. Their music has been called Their songs imagined 1950s and 1960s garage rock and surf music archetypes as seen in a distorting funhouse mirror, emphasising the music&#x27;s angst, loneliness and lyrical paranoia. Sometimes sounding like a demented nursery rhyme sing-along, this already bizarre blend was overlaid with Ravenstine&#x27;s ominous EML synthesizer effects and tape looped sounds of mundane conversation, ringing telephones or steam whistles. Their propulsive rhythmic pulse was similar to Krautrock, but Thomas&#x27;s yelping, howling, desperate singing was and still is peculiar when compared to most other rock and roll singers.

<text>Lucilio Vanini (15859 February 1619), who, in his works, styled himself Giulio Cesare Vanini, was an Italian philosopher, physician and free-thinker, who was one of the first significant representatives of intellectual libertinism. He was among the first modern thinkers who viewed the universe as an entity governed by natural laws (nomological determinism). He was also an early literate proponent of biological evolution, maintaining that humans and other apes have common ancestors. He was murdered in Toulouse.

Vanini was born at Taurisano near Lecce, and studied philosophy and theology at Naples. Afterwards, he applied himself to the physical studies, chiefly medicine and astronomy, which had come into vogue with the Renaissance. Like Giordano Bruno, he attacked scholasticism.

From Naples he went to Padua, where he came under the influence of the Alexandrist Pietro Pomponazzi, whom he styled his divine master. Subsequently, he led a roving life in France, Switzerland and the Low Countries, supporting himself by giving lessons and disseminating radical ideas. He was obliged to flee to England in 1612 but was imprisoned in London for 49 days.

Returning to Italy, he made an attempt to teach in Genoa but was driven again to France, where he tried to clear himself of suspicion by publishing a book against atheism: &quot;Amphitheatrum Aeternae Providentiae Divino-Magicum&quot; (1615). Though the definitions of God are somewhat pantheistic, the book served its immediate purpose. Although Vanini did not expound his true views in his first book, he did in his second: &quot;De Admirandis Naturae Reginae Deaeque Mortalium Arcanis&quot; (Paris, 1616). This was originally certified by two doctors of the Sorbonne, but was later re-examined and condemned.

Vanini then left Paris, where he had been staying as chaplain to the Marechal de Bassompierre, and began to teach in Toulouse. In November 1618, he was arrested and, after a prolonged trial, was condemned to have his tongue cut out, to be strangled at the stake and to have his body burned to ashes. The murder was carried out on 9 February 1619 by local authorities.

==Life==
===Early life (1585–1612)===

Lucilio Vanini was born in 1585 in Taurisano, Terra d&#x27;Otranto, Italy. His father was Giovan Battista Vanini, a businessman from Tresana in Tuscany, while his mother was the daughter of a man named Lopez de Noguera, a customs contractor of the Spanish royal family&#x27;s lands in Bari, Terra d&#x27;Otranto, Capitanata, and Basilicata. A document dated August 1612, discovered in the Vatican Secret Archives, describes Vanini as of Apulia, which is consistent with the native land he mentions in his own works.

The government census of the population of the hamlet of Taurisano, in 1596, includes the names of Giovan Battista Vanini, his lawful son Alexander, born in 1582, and his natural son Giovan Francesco, while there is no mention of Vanini&#x27;s wife or of another lawful son called Lucilio (or Giulio Cesare). In 1603 Giovan Battista Vanini is reported for the last time in Taurisano.

Lucilio Vanini entered the University of Naples in 1599. In 1603 he entered the Carmelite order, taking the name of Fra Gabriele. He earned a doctorate in canon and civil law from the University of Naples on 6 June 1606.

Afterwards, he remained in the Naples area for two years, apparently living as a friar, or alternatively he returned to Lecce and studied the new Renaissance sciences, chiefly medicine and astronomy. By now, he had assimilated much knowledge and &quot;speaks very good Latin and with great ease, is tall and a bit thin, has brown hair, an aquiline nose, lively eyes and a pleasant and ingenious physiognomy&quot;.
In (probably) 1606, Vanini&#x27;s father died in Naples. Vanini, now come of age, was recognised by a court in the capital as heir of Giovan Battista and guardian of his brother Alexander. With a series of deeds and power of attorney drawn up in Naples, Vanini began to settle the financial consequences of the death of his father: selling a house he owned in Ugento, a few miles from his home country; in 1607 mandating a maternal uncle to fulfil assignments of the same type; in 1608 instructing friend Scarciglia to recover a sum and sell some goods remaining in Taurisano and held in custody by the two brothers.

In 1608, Vanini moved to Padua, a town under the rule of Venice, to study theology at that university (although there is no record of him subsequently obtaining a degree). While there he came into contact with the group led by Paolo Sarpi that, with the support of the English embassy in Venice, fueled anti-papal polemics. In 1611 he participated in the Lenten sermons, attracting the suspicions of the religious authorities. During that period, the controversy over the 1606 interdict placed on the Republic of Venice by Pope Paul V was still raging, and Vanini showed himself unambiguously in favour of the Republic. Consequently, the Prior General of his order, Enrico Silvio, commanded him to return to Naples, where he would have been disciplined, probably severely, but instead Vanini sought refuge with the English ambassador to Venice in 1612.

===In England (1612–1614)===
Vanini then fled to England, along with his Genoese companion Bonaventure Genocchi. They passed through Bologna, Milan, the Swiss canton of Graubünden, and descended via the Rhine, through Germany and the Netherlands, to the North Sea coast and the English Channel, finally reaching London and the Lambeth residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Here the two remained for nearly two years, hiding their true identity from their English guests. In July 1612, they both renounced their Catholic faith and embraced Anglicanism.

By 1613, however, Vanini was having doubts, so he appealed to the Pope to be allowed back into the Catholic fold, but as a secular priest rather than as a friar; the request was granted by the Pope himself. Around the start of 1614, Vanini visited the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford and confided to some acquaintances his imminent flight from England, so in January, he and Genocchi were arrested on the orders of the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Abbot. They managed to escape however, Genocchi in February 1614 and Vanini in March. The Spanish ambassador in London and the chaplain of the embassy of the Venetian Republic were thought to have engineered their escapes. The two passed through the hands of the papal nuncio in Flanders, Guido Bentivoglio, to the papal nuncio in Paris, Roberto Ubaldini.

===In France (1614–1618)===
In Paris, in the summer of 1614, Vanini subscribed to the principles of the Council of Trent, to prove the sincerity of his return to the Catholic faith. He then journeyed to Italy, going first to Rome, where he had to face the difficult final stages of the process in the court of the Inquisition, then to Genoa for a few months, where he found his friend Genocchi and taught philosophy to children of Scipio Doria for a time.
Despite assurances, the return of Vanini and Genocchi was not entirely peaceful; in January 1615 Genocchi was arrested by the Inquisitor of Genoa. Vanini therefore, fearing the same fate, ran away again to France and headed to Lyon. There, in June 1615, he published &quot;Amphitheatrum&quot;, a book against atheism, which he hoped would clear his name with the Roman authorities.

A short time later Vanini returned to Paris, where he asked Nuncio Ubaldini to intervene on his behalf with the authorities in Rome. Insufficiently assured, Vanini decided not to return to Italy, and instead cultivated connections with prestigious elements of the French nobility.

In 1616, Vanini completed the second of his two works, &quot;De Admirandis&quot;, and got it approved by two theologians at the Sorbonne. The work was published in September in Paris. It was dedicated to François de Bassompierre, a powerful man at the court of Marie de&#x27; Medici, and was printed by Adrien Périer, a Protestant. The work was immediately successful among those aristocratic circles populated by young spirits who looked with interest to the cultural and scientific innovations that came from Italy. The &quot;De Admirandis&quot; was a summa, lively and brilliant, of the new knowledge, and became a kind of &quot;manifesto&quot; for these cultural free spirits, giving Vanini a chance to stay safe in circles close to the French court. However, a few days after the publication of the work, the two theologians at the Sorbonne who had expressed their approval were presented to the Faculty of Theology in formal session and the outcome was a &quot;de facto&quot; ban on the movement of the text.

Now, unwelcome in England, unable to return to Italy and threatened by some circles of French Catholics, Vanini saw his room for manoeuvre shrinking and his chances of finding a stable place in French society failing. Fearing that a court case would be started against him in Paris, he fled and went into hiding at Redon Abbey in Brittany, where Abbott Arthur d&#x27;Épinay de Saint-Luc acted as his protector. But other factors gave cause for concern: in April 1617 Concino Concini, favorite of Marie de&#x27; Medici, was killed in Paris, giving rise to a wave of hostility to Italian residents at court.

===Final year (1618–1619)===
In the following months, a mysterious Italian, with a strange name (Pompeo Uciglio) and in possession of great knowledge but an uncertain past, appeared in some cities of Guyenne, then the Languedoc and finally Toulouse. Duke Henri II de Montmorency, protector of &quot;esprits forts&quot; of the time, was the governor of this region and seemed to grant protection to the fugitive, who still continued to keep carefully hidden.

The presence of this mysterious character in Toulouse did not however pass unnoticed and attracted the suspicions of the authorities. In August 1618 he was apprehended and interrogated. In February 1619, the Parlement of Toulouse found him guilty of atheism and blasphemy and, in accordance with the regulations of the time, his tongue was cut out, he was strangled and his body was burned. After the execution it emerged that the stranger was in fact Vanini.

==Works==

===&quot;Amphitheatrum&quot;===
&quot;Amphitheatrum Aeternae Providentiae divino-magicum, christiano-physicum, necnon astrologo-catholicum adversus veteres philosophos, atheos, epicureos, peripateticos et stoicos&quot; (possible translation: &quot;Amphitheatre of Eternal Providence – Religio-magical, Christian-physical and Astrologico-Catholic – against the Ancient Philosophers, Atheists, Epicureans, Peripatetics and Stoics&quot;), published in Lyon in 1615, consists of 50 exercises, which aim to demonstrate the existence of God, to define His essence, to describe His providence and to examine or refute the opinions of Pythagoras, Protagoras, Cicero, Boethius, Thomas Aquinas, the Epicureans, Aristotle, Averroes, Gerolamo Cardano, the Peripatetics, the Stoics, etc. on this subject.

===&quot;De Admirandis&quot;===
&quot;De Admirandis Naturae Reginae Deaeque Mortalium Arcanis&quot; (possible translation: &quot;On the Marvelous Secrets of Nature, the Queen and Goddess of Mortals&quot;), printed in Paris in 1616 by publisher Adrien Périer, is divided into four books:

#On Sky and Air
#On Water and Land
#On Animals and Passions
#On Non-Christian Religions

These contain a total of 60 dialogues (but really only 59, as dialogue XXXV is absent), which take place between the author, in the role of disseminator of knowledge, and an imaginary Alessandro, who urges his interlocutor to list and explain the mysteries of nature found around and within man.

In a mixture of reinterpretation of ancient knowledge and the dissemination of new scientific and religious theories, the protagonist discusses: the material, figure, colour, form, energy and eternity of heaven; the motion and the central pole of the heavens; the sun, the moon, the stars; fire; comets and rainbows; lightning, snow and rain; the motion and rest of projectiles in the air; the impulsion of mortars and crossbows; winds and breezes; corrupt airs; the element of water; the birth of the rivers; the rising of the Nile; the extent and saltiness of the sea; the roar and the motion of the water; the motion of projectiles; the creation of islands and mountains, as well as the cause of earthquakes; the genesis, root and colour of the gems, as well as spots of stones; life, food, and the death of the stones; the strength of the magnet to attract iron and its direction toward the Earth&#x27;s poles; plants; the explanation to be given to certain phenomena of everyday life; semen; the reproduction, nature, respiration and nutrition of fish; the reproduction of birds; the reproduction of bees; the first generation of man; stains contracted by children in the womb; the generation of male and female; parts of monsters; the faces of children covered by larvae; the growth of man; the length of human life; sight; hearing; smell; taste; touch and tickle; the affections of man; God; appearances in the air; oracles; the Sibyls; the possessed; sacred images of the pagans; augurs; the miraculous healing of diseases reported in pagan times; the resurrection of the dead; witchcraft; dreams.

==Thought==

The naturalistic interpretation of supernatural phenomena that Pietro Pomponazzi – called by Vanini &quot;magister meus, divinus praeceptor meus, nostri seculi Philosophorum princeps&quot; – had given in the early 16th century in his treatise &quot;De Incantationibus&quot; was summarised in &quot;De Admirandis Naturae&quot;, where, in simple and elegant prose, Vanini also referred to Gerolamo Cardano, Julius Caesar Scaliger and other 16th century thinkers.

&quot;God acts on sublunary beings [humans] using the sky as a tool&quot;: hence the natural and rational explanation of the allegedly supernatural phenomena, since even astrology was considered a science. God may use such phenomena to warn the people, and especially rulers, of danger. But the real origin of supernatural phenomena is, for Vanini, the human imagination, which can sometimes change the appearance of external reality. For the ecclesiastical &quot;impostors&quot; that promulgate false beliefs to gain wealth and power, and rulers interested in dominating the people, according to Vanini, &quot;all religious things are false and fake principles to teach the naive populace that, when reason cannot be reached, at least practice religion&quot;.

Following Pietro Pomponazzi and Simone Porzio in their interpretation of the Aristotelian texts and the commentary thereon by Alexander of Aphrodisias, Vanini denied the immortality of the soul and attacked the Aristotelian cosmos-view. Like Bruno, he denied the difference between the everyday world and the celestial world, saying that both are composed of the same corruptible material. He disputed, in the physical and biological world, finality and the hylomorphic Aristotelian doctrine, and, reconnecting Epicureanism with Lucretius, prepared a new mechanistic-materialistic description of the universe where bodies are likened to a watch, and conceived a first form of universal transformation of living species. He agreed with the Aristotelian eternity of the world, especially considering the temporal aspect, but affirmed the rotation of the earth and appeared to reject the Ptolemaic system in favour of the heliocentric/Copernican system.

If the first editor of his works, Luigi Corvaglia, and historian Guido De Ruggiero, unjustly, considered his writings simply &quot;a &quot;centone&quot; devoid of originality and scientific seriousness&quot;, the Jesuit priest François Garasse, far more worried about the consequences of the spread of his writings, judged them &quot;a work of such most pernicious atheism as was never released in the last hundred years&quot;. The works of Vanini have been extensively reviewed and revalued by contemporary critics, revealing originality and insights (metaphysical, physical, biological) sometimes well ahead of their time.

Since Vanini in his works obscured his ideas, a typical ploy at the time to avoid serious conflicts with the religious and political authorities, the interpretation of his thought is difficult. However, in the history of philosophy, he has the image of an unbeliever or even an atheist. Considered as one of the fathers of libertinism, he was regarded as a lost soul by conventional Christians, despite having written a defense of the Council of Trent.

To understand the origins of Vanini&#x27;s thought one has to look to his cultural background, which was fairly typical of the Renaissance, with a prevalence of elements of Averroistic Aristotelianism but with strong elements of mysticism and Neo-Platonism. On the other hand, he drew from Nicholas of Cusa typical pantheistic elements, similar to those which are also found in Giordano Bruno, but more materialistic. His world view was based on the eternity of matter, and of a God in nature as a &quot;force&quot; that shapes, orders and directs. All forms of life, he thought, had originated spontaneously from the earth itself as their creator.

Vanini was considered an atheist, but his first work, published in Lyon in 1615, &quot;Amphitheatrum&quot;, indicates otherwise. As a precursor of libertinism there are many elements that make his teaching close to the thought of the unknown author of the Treatise of the Three Impostors, also a pantheist. Vanini thought in fact that the creators of the three monotheistic religions, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad, were nothing but impostors.

In &quot;De Admirandis&quot; are found themes from &quot;Amphitheatrum&quot;, with refinements and developments that make it his masterpiece and the summary of his philosophy. Denying creation from nothing and the immortality of the soul, he saw God in Nature as its driving force and vital force, both eternal. The stars of heaven he considered a kind of intermediary between God and Nature. The true religion is therefore a &quot;religion of Nature&quot; that does not deny God but considers Him a spirit-force.

The thought of Vanini is quite fragmented and also reflects the complexity of its origins, as he was a religious figure, a naturalist, but also a doctor and in part a magician. What characterizes the prose is the vehemently anti-clerical sentiment. Among the original aspects of his thinking there is a kind of anticipation of Darwinism, because, after a first half in which he argues that the animal species arise by spontaneous generation from the earth, in the second part he seems convinced that they can be transformed into each other and that man comes from &quot;animals related to man, such as the Barbary apes, the monkeys and apes in general&quot;.

==Reputation==
In 1623 two works appeared that started the myth of Vanini the atheist: &quot;La doctrine curieuse des beaux esprits de ce temps ...&quot; of Jesuit François Garasse, and &quot;Quaestiones celeberrimae in Genesim cum accurata explicatione ...&quot;, of Father Marin Mersenne. The two works, though, instead of turning off the voice of the philosopher, boosted it in an environment that was obviously ready to receive, discuss and recognise the validity of his claims.

In that same year the name of Vanini was again brought to the attention of French culture during the sensational trial of the poet Théophile de Viau, whose outlook had striking similarities with Vaninian thought.

In 1624, the monk Marin Mersenne returned to attacking the philosophy of Vanini, analyzing some statements in chapter X of his &quot;L&#x27;Impiétè des Déistes, Athées et Libertins de ce temps, combatuë, et renversee de point en point par raisons tirées de la Philosophie, et de la Theologie&quot;, in which the theologian expresses his judgment of the works of Girolamo Cardano and Giordano Bruno.

Even Leibniz, another opponent of libertinism, was strongly opposed to Vanini, considering him evil, a fool and a charlatan.

English intellectuals showed interest in the ideas of Vanini, and it was especially with the work of Charles Blount that Vanini&#x27;s ideas entered English culture, becoming a cornerstone of libertinism and deism in seventeenth century England.

An unpublished manuscript in the municipal library of Avignon preserves &quot;Observations sur Lucilio Vanini&quot; written by Joseph Louis Dominique de Cambis, Marquis de Velleron, but provides only uncertain information on the philosopher, largely rectified by recent studies. In this same period a manuscript copy of the &quot;Amphitheatrum&quot;, was made or commissioned by Joseph Uriot, which later came to the library of the Duke of Württemberg; currently it is in the Württembergische Landesbibliothek in Stuttgart. Another manuscript copy of the same work is in the Staats und Universitätbibliothek in Hamburg, reflecting the continued interest in the thought of Vanini in German culture.

Pierre Bayle, in his &quot;Various Thoughts on the Occasion of a Comet&quot;, cited Vanini as an example of a learned atheist, alongside the ancient figures of Diagoras, Theodorus, and Euhemerus.

In 1730, the press in London was given a biography of Vanini with an extract of his works, entitled &quot;The life of Lucilio (alias Julius Caesar) Vanini, burnt for atheism at Toulouse. With an abstract of his writings.&quot; The work debates Vanini&#x27;s ideas, recognising much merit.

Arthur Schopenhauer&#x27;s 1839 essay &#x27;On the Freedom of the Will&#x27; includes Vanini among his account of predecessors who also came to the same conclusion as that of his essay, which Schopenhauer expressed as follows: &quot;Everything that happens, from the greatest to the smallest, happens necessarily.&quot;

<text>No More Heroes is the second studio album by English new wave band the Stranglers. It was released on 23 September 1977, through record label United Artists in most of the world and A&amp;M in the United States, five months after their debut album, &quot;Rattus Norvegicus&quot;.

==Background==
&quot;No More Heroes&quot; was produced by Martin Rushent. The album consists of new material with four songs left over from the &quot;Rattus Norvegicus&quot; sessions (&quot;Something Better Change&quot;, &quot;Bitching&quot;, &quot;Peasant in the Big Shitty&quot; and &quot;School Mam&quot;).

The album cover features a photo of a wreath placed on a coffin with the tails of several rats (the Stranglers&#x27; trademark). The brass plaque on the album cover was engraved by Steven Stapleton of Nurse with Wound.

Two singles were released from the album: the title track, and a double A-side of &quot;Something Better Change&quot; and the non-album track &quot;Straighten Out&quot;.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; likened the band to &quot;Capt. Beefheart backed by the Ramones.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that &quot;a good organ sound and distinctive vocal tricks [keep] off the encroaching monotony.&quot;

AllMusic called &quot;No More Heroes&quot; &quot;faster, nastier and better [than &quot;Rattus Norvegicus&quot;]. &quot;At this point the Stranglers were on top of their game, and the ferocity and anger that suffuses this record would never be repeated.&quot; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;No More Heroes&quot; &quot;continues in the same vein [as &quot;Rattus Norvegicus&quot;], but drops whatever hint of restraint may have been in force the first time around. Rude words and adult themes abound, with no punches pulled, from the blatant sexism of &quot;Bring on the Nubiles&quot; to the sarcastic attack on racism (&quot;I Feel Like a Wog&quot;) to the suicide of a friend (&quot;Dagenham Dave&quot;). Despite the increased virulence, the music is even better than on the debut, introducing pop stylings that would later become a more common aspect of the Stranglers&#x27; character,&quot; finishing the review with &quot;&quot;No More Heroes&quot; is easily [the Stranglers&#x27;] best album.&quot;

In 2000 it was voted number 427 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

<text>Jakow Trachtenberg (17 June 1888 – 26 October 1951) was a mathematician who developed the mental calculation techniques called the Trachtenberg system.

He was born in Odessa, in the Russian Empire (today Ukraine). He graduated with highest honors from the Mining Engineering Institute in St. Petersburg and later worked as an engineer in the Obukhov arms factory. While still in his early twenties, he became Chief Engineer with 11,000 men under his supervision. The Tsarist government gave him the responsibility of supervising the formation of a well-developed navy.

Trachtenberg was a dedicated pacifist. When war broke out in 1914, he was instrumental in organising a society known as the Society of Good Samaritans. The idea was to train Russian students to take care of the wounded. It also had a special recognition from Tsar Nicholas II. He was against violence of any sort despite having a leading position in tsarist arms production.

After the Russian Revolutions of 1917, Trachtenberg fled to the Weimar Republic where he became critical of Nazi policies. He was imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp during World War II. He developed his system of mental arithmetic during his imprisonment. He later fled to Switzerland. He died in 1951

<text>The Trachtenberg system is a system of rapid mental calculation. The system consists of a number of readily memorized operations that allow one to perform arithmetic computations very quickly. It was developed by the Russian engineer Jakow Trachtenberg in order to keep his mind occupied while being a prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp.

The rest of this article presents some methods devised by Trachtenberg. Some of the algorithms Trachtenberg developed are ones for general multiplication, division and addition. Also, the Trachtenberg system includes some specialised methods for multiplying small numbers between 5 and 13.

The section on addition demonstrates an effective method of checking calculations that can also be applied to multiplication.

==General multiplication==
The method for general multiplication is a method to achieve multiplications formula_1 with low space complexity, i.e. as few temporary results as possible to be kept in memory. This is achieved by noting that the final digit is completely determined by multiplying the last digit of the multiplicands. This is held as a temporary result. To find the next to last digit, we need everything that influences this digit: The temporary result, the last digit of formula_2 times the next-to-last digit of formula_3, as well as the next-to-last digit of formula_2 times the last digit of formula_3. This calculation is performed, and we have a temporary result that is correct in the final two digits.

In general, for each position formula_6 in the final result, we sum for all formula_7:

: formula_8

People can learn this algorithm and thus multiply four-digit numbers in their head – writing down only the final result. They would write it out starting with the rightmost digit and finishing with the leftmost.

Trachtenberg defined this algorithm with a kind of pairwise multiplication where two digits are multiplied by one digit, essentially only keeping the middle digit of the result. By performing the above algorithm with this pairwise multiplication, even fewer temporary results need to be held.

Example: formula_9

To find the first (rightmost) digit of the answer, start at the first digit of the multiplicand
:The units digit of formula_10 is formula_11
:The first digit of the answer is formula_12. The tens digit formula_13 is ignored.

To find the second digit of the answer, start at the second digit of the multiplicand:
:The units digit of formula_14 plus the tens digit of formula_15 plus
:The units digit of formula_16.
:formula_17.
:The second digit of the answer is formula_18 and carry formula_19 to the third digit.

To find the third digit of the answer, start at the third digit of the multiplicand:
:The units digit of formula_20 plus the tens digit of formula_14 plus
:The units digit of formula_22 plus the tens digit of formula_16 plus
:The units digit of formula_24
:formula_25
:The third digit of the answer is formula_26 and carry formula_19 to the next digit.

To find the fourth digit of the answer, start at the fourth digit of the multiplicand:
:The units digit of formula_28 plus the tens digit of formula_20 plus
:The units digit of formula_30 plus the tens digit of formula_22 plus
:The units digit of formula_32 plus the tens digit of formula_24.
:formula_34 carried from the third digit.
:The fourth digit of the answer is formula_35 and carry formula_36 to the next digit.

Continue with the same method to obtain the remaining digits.
Trachtenberg called this the 2 Finger Method. The calculations for finding the fourth digit from the example above are illustrated at right. The arrow from the nine will always point to the digit of the multiplicand directly above the digit of the answer you wish to find, with the other arrows each pointing one digit to the right. Each arrow head points to a UT Pair, or Product Pair. The vertical arrow points to the product where we will get the Units digit, and the sloping arrow points to the product where we will get the Tens digits of the Product Pair. If an arrow points to a space with no digit there is no calculation for that arrow. As you solve for each digit you will move each of the arrows over the multiplicand one digit to the left until all of the arrows point to prefixed zeros.


Division in the Trachtenberg System is done much the same as in multiplication but with subtraction instead of addition. Splitting the dividend into smaller Partial Dividends, then dividing this Partial Dividend by only the left-most digit of the divisor will provide the answer one digit at a time. As you solve each digit of the answer you then subtract Product Pairs (UT pairs) and also NT pairs (Number-Tens) from the Partial Dividend to find the next Partial Dividend. The Product Pairs are found between the digits of the answer so far and the divisor. If a subtraction results in a negative number you have to back up one digit and reduce that digit of the answer by one. With enough practice this method can be done in your head.

==Other multiplication algorithms==

When performing any of these multiplication algorithms the following &quot;steps&quot; should be applied.

The answer must be found one digit at a time starting at the least significant digit and moving left. The last calculation is on the leading zero of the multiplicand.

Each digit has a &quot;neighbor&quot;, i.e., the digit on its right. The rightmost digit&#x27;s neighbor is the trailing zero.

The &#x27;halve&#x27; operation has a particular meaning to the Trachtenberg system. It is intended to mean &quot;half the digit, rounded down&quot; but for speed reasons people following the Trachtenberg system are encouraged to make this halving process instantaneous. So instead of thinking &quot;half of seven is three and a half, so three&quot; it&#x27;s suggested that one thinks &quot;seven, three&quot;. This speeds up calculation considerably. In this same way the tables for subtracting digits from 10 or 9 are to be memorized.

And whenever the rule calls for adding half of the neighbor, always add 5 if the current digit is odd. This makes up for dropping 0.5 in the next digit&#x27;s calculation.

: 6+6=12 (carry the 1),
: 2+2=4
: 4+4=8;

#For the leading zero, subtract 2 from half of the neighbor.

Example: 492 × 3 = 1476

Working from right to left:
: (10 − 2) × 2 + Half of 0 (0) = 16. Write 6, carry 1.
: (9 − 9) × 2 + Half of 2 (1) + 5 (since 9 is odd) + 1 (carried) = 7. Write 7.

: Half of 4&#x27;s neighbor is 1.
: Half of the leading zero&#x27;s neighbor is 2.

: Half of 3&#x27;s neighbor is 0, plus 5 because 3 is odd, is 5.
: Half of 4&#x27;s neighbor is 1.
: Half of the leading zero&#x27;s neighbor is 2.

: 5 + half of 7 (3) + 5 (since the starting digit 5 is odd) + 1 (carried) = 14. Write 4, carry the 1.
: 3 + half of 5 (2) + 5 (since 3 is odd) + 1 (carried) = 11. Write 1, carry 1.
: 0 + half of 3 (1) + 1 (carried) = 2. Write 2.
===Multiplying by 7===
Proof

formula_43
Rule:
#Double each digit.
#Add half of its neighbor to the right (dropping decimals, if any). The neighbor of the units position is 0.
#If the base-digit is even add 0 otherwise add 5. 
#Add in any carryover from the previous step.

Example: 693 × 7 = 4,851

Working from right to left:

: (3×2) + 0 + 5 + 0 = 11 = carryover 1, result 1.
: (9×2) + 1 + 5 + 1 = 25 = carryover 2, result 5.
: (6×2) + 4 + 0 + 2 = 18 = carryover 1, result 8.

Example: 456 × 8 = 3648

Working from right to left:

: (10 − 6) × 2 + 0 = 8. Write 8.
: (9 − 5) × 2 + 6 = 14, Write 4, carry 1.

Proof

formula_45

Rule:
#Subtract the right-most digit from 10.
##Subtract the remaining digits from 9.
#Add the neighbor to the sum
#For the leading zero, subtract 1 from the neighbor.

For rules 9, 8, 4, and 3 only the first digit is subtracted from 10. After that each digit is subtracted from nine instead.

Example: 2,130 × 9 = 19,170

Working from right to left:
: (10 − 0) + 0 = 10. Write 0, carry 1.
: (9 − 3) + 0 + 1 (carried) = 7. Write 7.
: (9 − 1) + 3 = 11. Write 1, carry 1.
: (9 − 2) + 1 + 1 (carried) = 9. Write 9.
: 2 − 1 = 1. Write 1.

=== Multiplying by 10 ===
Add 0 (zero) as the rightmost digit.

Proof
formula_46

===Multiplying by 11===
Proof

formula_47
Rule:
#Add the digit to its neighbor. (By &quot;neighbor&quot; we mean the digit on the right.)

Example: formula_48
: (0 + 3) (3 + 4) (4 + 2) (2 + 5) (5 + 0)
: 3 7 6 7 5

To illustrate:
: 11=10+1

Thus,
: formula_49
: formula_50

===Multiplying by 12===
Proof

formula_51
Rule: to multiply by 12:Starting from the rightmost digit, double each digit and add the neighbor. (The &quot;neighbor&quot; is the digit on the right.)

If the answer is greater than a single digit, simply carry over the extra digit (which will be a 1 or 2) to the next operation.
The remaining digit is one digit of the final result.

Example: formula_52

Determine neighbors in the multiplicand 0316:
* digit 6 has no right neighbor
* digit 1 has neighbor 6
* digit 3 has neighbor 1
* digit 0 (the prefixed zero) has neighbor 3

<text>Arun Kumar Nehru (24 April 1944 – 25 July 2013) was an Indian politician and columnist. He was member of the 9th Lok Sabha from Bilhaur as a Janata Dal leader. Earlier, he was member of the 7th and 8th Lok Sabhas from Rae Bareli on an Indian National Congress ticket.

==Personal life==
Arun Nehru was born on 24 April 1944. His father was Anand Kumar Nehru, a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family. He studied at La Martinière Boys College, Lucknow, and Lucknow Christian College. He was married in 1967 to Subhadra and had two daughters. He has 3 grandsons. Akhil Madan, Yash Madan and Vickram Tikkoo. He died on 25 July 2013 in Gurgaon.

==Career==
He worked as a businessman for 17 years before entering into politics. He was president of the paint firm Jenson and Nicholson at the time when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi persuaded him to change career. However, he rose to prominence after Sanjay Gandhi&#x27;s death. The business community regarded him as a decisive person and even termed him as &quot;one-window clearance&quot;. When Rajiv Gandhi forayed into politics in 1981, Nehru became his key advisor.

As a representative of the Indian National Congress (INC), Nehru was a member of Parliament in the 7th Lok Sabha (1980–84) and 8th Lok Sabha (1984-89) from Rae Bareli. He was Union Minister of State for Energy (December 1984—September 1985,) and for Home Affairs (September 1985—October 1986) in 10th ministry of India. Later, he left the INC for Janata Dal and was elected to the 9th Lok Sabha from Bilhaur in 1989, where he was Union Minister for Commerce and Tourism (December–November 1990).

He was also a member of various committees - Railway Convention Committee (1980–84), Consultative Committee, External Affairs and Science and Technology, 7th Lok Sabha; Member, Consultative Committee, External Affairs (1987–89)

==Controversies==
===Role in 1984 Anti-Sikh riots===
As originally reported by The Caravan Magazine, Arun Nehru reportedly played a pivotal role in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. The riots broke out after the Assassination of Indira Gandhi. According to then petroleum secretary Avtar Singh Gill, Rajiv Gandhi &#x27;s &quot;errand boy&quot;, Lalit Suri informed him at the eve of the massacre that Arun Nehru gave &quot;clearance&quot; for the killings in Delhi.. His strategy was to &quot;catch Sikh youth, fling a tyre over their heads, douse them with kerosene and set them on fire.&quot;. He further retorted, &quot;This will calm the anger of the Hindus&quot;.

===Czech pistol case===
During his tenure as minister in the Home department in 1985–86, he was allegedly involved in the Czech pistol case, where a deal with the Czechoslovakian firm Merkuria Foreign Trade Corp. had resulted in a loss of around . A 20-year investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) led to submission of a report in 2007. This found no incriminating evidence. The trial court, however, rejected the CBI report and found Nehru&#x27;s involvement enough to continue the proceedings. In March 2013, the Supreme Court stayed those proceedings, based on the report.

<doc id="567397" wikidata="Q7914894" url="?curid=567397" title="Vanidades">
<text>Vanidades (Spanish for &quot;Vanities&quot;) is one of the most popular Spanish language women&#x27;s magazines. Published by Editorial Televisa across the United States and Hispanic America, it was launched in Cuba in February 1937 by Editorial Carteles S.A. When Fidel Castro rose to power, &quot;Vanidades&quot;&#x27; headquarters moved from Havana to New York. Later, in 1961, &quot;Vanidades&quot; was relaunched as &quot;Nueva Vanidades&quot; and eventually as &quot;Vanidades Continental&quot;.

The magazine in its beginnings was aimed at women of high class, addressing them in a friendly manner and serving as a guide to help them keep up with the trends in fashion, culture, arts, health and beauty. To guarantee its market success, the magazine is edited locally in some cases, blending national preferences with international trends and always following its traditionally classical style.

The main headquarters of &quot;Vanidades&quot; are now located in Mexico. However, localized editions are released simultaneously in Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, United States, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.

&quot;Vanidades&quot; magazine stopped circulating in Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile and Argentina due to the closure of Editorial Televisa in those countries between January and February 2019. It was also distributed in Venezuela through the Bloque Dearmas, but it stopped being published due to the socioeconomic crisis that is lived in that country.

Vanidades magazine is once again published in print and digital in Chile by Alfa Editores SA, on Tuesday, April 4, 2023 after 4 years of silence.

<doc id="567398" wikidata="Q2904990" url="?curid=567398" title="Salim Ali">
<text>Sálim Moizuddin Abdul Ali (12 November 1896 – 20 June 1987) was an Indian ornithologist and naturalist. Sometimes referred to as the &quot;Birdman of India&quot;, Salim Ali was the first Indian to conduct systematic bird surveys across India and wrote several bird books that popularized ornithology in India. He became a key figure behind the Bombay Natural History Society after 1947 and used his personal influence to garner government support for the organisation, create the Bharatpur bird sanctuary (Keoladeo National Park) and prevent the destruction of what is now the Silent Valley National Park.

Along with Sidney Dillon Ripley he wrote the landmark ten volume &quot;Handbook of the Birds of India and Pakistan&quot;, a second edition of which was completed after his death. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1958 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1976, India&#x27;s third and second highest civilian honours respectively. Several species of birds, Salim Ali&#x27;s fruit bat, Salim Ali&#x27;s dwarf gecko, a couple of bird sanctuaries and institutions have been named after him.

==Early life==
Salim Ali was born into a Sulaimani Bohra family in Bombay, the ninth and youngest child of Moizuddin Abdul Ali. His father died when he was a year old and his mother Zeenat-un-nissa died when he was three. Along with his siblings, Ali was brought up by his maternal uncle, Amiruddin Tyabji, and childless aunt, Hamida Begum, in a middle-class household in Khetwadi, Mumbai. Another uncle was Abbas Tyabji, a well known Indian freedom fighter. Ali&#x27;s early interest was in books on hunting in India and he became the most interested in sport-shooting, encouraged by his foster-father Amiruddin. Shooting contests were often held in the neighbourhood in which he grew and his playmates included Iskandar Mirza, a distant cousin who was a particularly good marksman and went on in later life to become the first President of Pakistan.

Salim was introduced to the serious study of birds by W. S. Millard, secretary of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) where Amiruddin was a member, who identified an unusually coloured sparrow that young Salim had shot for sport with his toy air gun. Millard identified it as a yellow-throated sparrow, and showed Salim around the Society&#x27;s collection of stuffed birds. Millard lent Salim a few books including Eha&#x27;s &quot;Common birds of Bombay&quot;, encouraged Salim to make a collection of birds and offered to train him in skinning and preservation. Millard later introduced young Salim to (later Sir) Norman Boyd Kinnear, the first paid curator at the BNHS, who later supported Ali from his position in the British Museum. In his autobiography, &quot;The Fall of a Sparrow&quot;, Ali notes the yellow-throated sparrow event as a turning point in his life, one that led him into ornithology, an unusual career choice, especially for an Indian in those days. Even at around 10 years of age, he maintained a diary and among his earliest bird notes were observations on the replacement of males in paired sparrows after he had shot down the male.

Salim went to primary school at Zenana Bible and Medical Mission Girls High School at Girgaum along with two of his sisters and later to St. Xavier&#x27;s College, Bombay. Around the age of 13 he suffered from chronic headaches, making him drop out of class frequently. He was sent to Sind to stay with an uncle who had suggested that the dry air might help and on returning after such breaks in studies, he barely managed to pass the matriculation exam of the Bombay University in 1913.

==Burma and Germany==

Salim Ali&#x27;s early education was at St. Xavier&#x27;s College, Mumbai. Following a difficult first year in college, he dropped out and went to Tavoy, Burma (Tenasserim) to look after the family&#x27;s wolfram (tungsten) mining (tungsten was used in armour plating and was valuable during the war) and timber interests there. The forests surrounding this area provided an opportunity for Ali to hone his naturalist and hunting skills. He also made acquaintance with J C Hopwood and Berthold Ribbentrop who were with the Forest Service in Burma. On his return to India in 1917, he decided to continue formal studies. He went to study commercial law and accountancy at Davar&#x27;s College of Commerce but his true interest was noticed by Father Ethelbert Blatter at St. Xavier&#x27;s College who persuaded Ali to study zoology. After attending morning classes at Davar&#x27;s College, he then began to attend zoology classes at St. Xavier&#x27;s College and was able to complete the course in zoology. Around the same time, he married Tehmina, a distant relative, in December 1918.

Ali was fascinated by motorcycles from an early age and starting with a 3.5 HP NSU in Tavoy, he owned a Sunbeam, Harley-Davidsons (three models), a Douglas, a Scott, a New Hudson and a Zenith among others at various times. On invitation to the 1950 International Ornithological Congress at Uppsala in Sweden he shipped his Sunbeam aboard the SS &quot;Stratheden&quot; from Bombay and biked around Europe, injuring himself in a minor mishap in France apart from having several falls on cobbled roads in Germany. When he arrived on a fully loaded bike, just in time for the first session at Uppsala, word went around that he had ridden all the way from India! He regretted not having owned a BMW.

Ali failed to get an ornithologist&#x27;s position which was open at the Zoological Survey of India due to the lack of a formal university degree and the post went instead to M. L. Roonwal. He was hired as guide lecturer in 1926 at the newly opened natural history section in the Prince of Wales Museum in Mumbai with a salary of Rs 350 per month. He however tired of the job after two years and took leave in 1928 to study in Germany, where he was to work under Professor Erwin Stresemann at the Berlin&#x27;s Natural History Museum. Part of the work involved studying the specimens collected by J. K. Stanford in Burma. Stanford being a BNHS member had communicated with Claud Ticehurst and had suggested that he could work on his own with assistance from the BNHS. Ticehurst did not appreciate the idea of an Indian being involved in the work and resented even more, the involvement of Stresemann, a German. Ticehurst wrote letters to the BNHS suggesting that the idea of collaborating with Stresemann was an insult to Stanford. This was however not heeded by Reginald Spence and Prater who encouraged Ali to conduct the studies at Berlin with the assistance of Stresemann. Ali found Stresemann warm and helpful right from his first letters sent before even meeting him. In his autobiography, Ali calls Stresemann his &quot;guru&quot;, to whom all his later queries went. In Berlin, Ali made acquaintance with many of the major German ornithologists of the time including Bernhard Rensch, Oskar Heinroth, Rudolf Drost and Ernst Mayr apart from meeting other Indians in Berlin including the revolutionary Chempakaraman Pillai. Ali also gained experience in bird ringing at the Heligoland Bird Observatory and in 1959 he received the assistance of Swiss ornithologist Alfred Schifferli in India.

==Ornithology==

On his return to India in 1930, he discovered that the guide lecturer position had been eliminated due to lack of funds. Unable to find a suitable job, Salim Ali and Tehmina moved to Kihim, a coastal village near Mumbai. Here he had the opportunity to study at close hand, the breeding of the baya weaver and discovered their mating system of sequential polygamy. Later commentators have suggested that this study was in the tradition of the Mughal naturalists that Salim Ali admired and wrote about in three-part series on the Moghul emperors as naturalists. A few months were then spent in Kotagiri where he had been invited by K.M. Anantan, a retired army doctor who had served in Mesopotamia during World War I. He also came in contact with Mrs Kinloch, widow of BNHS member Angus Kinloch who lived at Donnington near Longwood Shola, and later her son-in-law R C Morris, who lived in the Biligirirangan Hills. Around the same time he discovered an opportunity to conduct systematic bird surveys in the princely states of Hyderabad, Cochin, Travancore, Gwalior, Indore and Bhopal with the sponsorship of their rulers. He was aided and supported in these surveys by Hugh Whistler who had surveyed many parts of India and had kept very careful notes. Whistler published a note on &quot;The study of Indian birds&quot; in 1929 where he mentioned that the racquets at the end of the long tail feathers of the greater racket-tailed drongo lacked webbing on the inner vane. Salim Ali wrote a response pointing out that this was in error and that such inaccuracies had been carried on from early literature and pointed out that it was incorrect observation that did not take into account a twist in the rachis. Whistler was initially resentful of an unknown Indian finding fault and wrote &quot;snooty&quot; letters to the editors of the journal S H Prater and Sir Reginald Spence. Subsequently, Whistler re-examined his specimens and not only admitted his error but became a close friend. Whistler wrote to Ali on 24 October 1938:
Whistler also introduced Salim to Richard Meinertzhagen and the two made an expedition into Afghanistan. Although Meinertzhagen had very critical views of him they became good friends. Salim Ali found nothing amiss in Meinertzhagen&#x27;s bird works but later studies have shown many of his studies to be fraudulent. Meinertzhagen made his diary entries from their days in the field available and Salim Ali reproduces them in his autobiography:


He was accompanied and supported on his early surveys by his wife, Tehmina, and was shattered when she died in 1939 following a minor surgery. After Tehmina&#x27;s death in 1939, Salim Ali stayed with his sister Kamoo and brother-in-law. In the course of his later travels, Ali rediscovered the Kumaon Terai population of the Finn&#x27;s baya but was unsuccessful in his expedition to find the mountain quail (&quot;Ophrysia superciliosa&quot;), the status of which continues to remain unknown.
Ali was not very interested in the details of bird systematics and taxonomy and was more interested in studying birds in the field. Ernst Mayr wrote to Ripley complaining that Ali failed to collect sufficient specimens: &quot;as far as collecting is concerned I don&#x27;t think he ever understood the necessity for collecting series. Maybe you can convince him of that.&quot; Ali himself wrote to Ripley complaining about bird taxonomy:

Ali later wrote that his interest was in the &quot;living bird in its natural environment.&quot;

Salim Ali&#x27;s associations with Sidney Dillon Ripley led to many bureaucratic problems. Ripley&#x27;s past as an OSS agent led to allegations that the CIA had a hand in the bird-ringing operations in India.

Salim Ali took some interest in bird photography along with his friend Loke Wan Tho. Loke had been introduced to Ali by J.T.M. Gibson, a BNHS member and Lieutenant Commander of the Royal Indian Navy, who had taught English to Loke at a school in Switzerland. A wealthy Singapore businessman with a keen interest in birds, Loke helped Ali and the BNHS with financial support. Ali was also interested in the historical aspects of ornithology in India. In a series of articles, among his first publications, he examined the contributions to natural-history of the Mughal emperors. In the 1971 Sunder Lal Hora memorial lecture and the 1978 Azad Memorial Lecture he spoke of the history and importance of bird study in India. Towards the end of his life, he began to document the lives of people in the history of the Bombay Natural History Society but did not complete the series with only four parts published.

==Other contributions==

Salim Ali was very influential in ensuring the survival of the BNHS and managed to save the then 100-year-old institution by writing to the then Prime Minister Pandit Nehru for financial help. Salim also influenced other members of his family. A cousin, Humayun Abdulali became an ornithologist while his niece Laeeq took an interest in birds and was married to Zafar Futehally, a distant cousin of Ali, who went on to become the honorary Secretary of the BNHS and played a major role in the development of bird study through the networking of birdwatchers in India. A grand-nephew Shahid Ali also took an interest in ornithology. Ali also guided several MSc and PhD students, the first of whom was Vijaykumar Ambedkar, who further studied the breeding and ecology of the baya weaver, producing a thesis that was favourably reviewed by David Lack.

Ali was able to provide support for the development of ornithology in India by identifying important areas where funding could be obtained. He helped in the establishment of an economic ornithology unit within the Indian Council for Agricultural Research in the mid-1960s although he failed to gain support for a similar proposal in 1935. He was also able to obtain funding for migration studies through a project to study the Kyasanur forest disease, an arthropod-borne virus that appeared to have similarities to a Siberian tick-borne disease. This project partly funded by the PL 480 grants of the USA however ran into political difficulties with allegations made on CIA involvement. The funding for the early bird migration studies actually came for the early studies from the US Army Medical Research Laboratory in Bangkok under the SEATO (South Atlantic Security Pact) and headed by H. Elliott McClure. An Indian science reporter wrote in a local newspaper that the collaboration was secretly exploring the use of migratory birds for spreading deadly viruses and microbes into enemy territories. India was then a non-aligned country and the news led to political upheaval and a committee was set up to examine the research and allegations. Once cleared of these allegations, the project however stopped routing the funds through Bangkok to avoid further suspicions and was directly funded by the Americans to India. In the late 1980s, Ali also headed a BNHS project to reduce bird hits at Indian airfields. He also attempted a citizen science project to study house sparrows in 1963 through Indian birdwatchers subscribed to the &quot;Newsletter for Birdwatchers&quot;.

Ali had considerable influence in conservation related issues in post-independence India especially through Prime Ministers Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. Indira Gandhi, herself a keen birdwatcher, was influenced by Ali&#x27;s bird books (a copy of the &quot;Book of Indian Birds&quot; was gifted to her in 1942 by her father Nehru who was in Dehra Dun jail while she herself was imprisoned in Naini Jail) and by the Gandhian birdwatcher Horace Alexander. Ali influenced the designation of the Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary, the Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary and in decisions that saved the Silent Valley National Park. One of Ali&#x27;s later interventions at Bharatpur involved the exclusion of cattle and graziers from the sanctuary and this was to prove costly as it resulted in ecological changes that led to a decline in the waterbirds. Some historians have noted that the approach to conservation used by Salim Ali and the BNHS followed an undemocratic process.

Ali lived for some time with his brother Hamid Ali (1880-1965) who had retired in 1934 from the Indian Civil Service and settled at Southwood, ancestral home of his father in law, Abbas Tyabji, in Mussoorie. During this period Ali became a close friend of Arthur Foot, principal of The Doon School and his wife Sylvia (referred to jocularly by Ali as the &quot;Feet&quot;). He visited the school often and was an engaging and persuasive advocate of ornithology to successive generations of pupils. As a consequence, he was considered to be part of the Dosco fraternity and became one of the very few people to be made an honorary member of &quot;The Doon School Old Boys Society&quot;.

==Personal views==
Salim Ali held many views that were contrary to the mainstream ideas of his time. A question he was asked frequently in later life was on the contradiction between the collection of bird specimens and his conservation related activism. Although once a fan of &quot;shikar&quot; (hunting) literature, Ali held strong views against sport hunting but upheld the collection of bird specimens for scientific study. He held the view that the practice of wildlife conservation needed to be practical and not grounded in philosophies like &quot;ahimsa&quot;. Salim Ali suggested that this fundamental religious sentiment had hindered the growth of bird study in India.
In the early 1960s, the national bird of India was under consideration and Salim Ali was intent that it should be the endangered Great Indian bustard, however this proposal was over-ruled in favour of the Indian peacock.

Ali was known for his frugal lifestyle, with money saved at the end of many of his projects. Shoddy jobs by people around him could make him very angry. He discouraged smoking and drinking and detested people who snored in their sleep.

==Honours and memorials==

Although recognition came late, he received several honorary doctorates and numerous awards. The earliest was the &quot;Joy Gobinda Law Gold Medal&quot; in 1953, awarded by the Asiatic Society of Bengal based on an appraisal of his work by Sunder Lal Hora (and in 1970 he received the Sunder Lal Hora memorial Medal of the Indian National Science Academy). He received honorary doctorates from the Aligarh Muslim University (1958), Delhi University (1973) and Andhra University (1978). In 1967 he became the first non-British citizen to receive the Gold Medal of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union. In the same year, he received the J. Paul Getty Wildlife Conservation Prize consisting of a sum of $100,000, which he used as a corpus for the Salim Ali Nature Conservation Fund. In 1969 he received the John C. Phillips memorial medal of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. The USSR Academy of Medical Sciences awarded him the Pavlovsky Centenary Memorial Medal in 1973 and in the same year he was made Commander of the Netherlands Order of the Golden Ark by Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. The Indian government decorated him with a &quot;Padma Bhushan&quot; in 1958 and the &quot;Padma Vibhushan&quot; in 1976. He was nominated to the Rajya Sabha in 1985.


Dr. Salim Ali died in Bombay at the age of 90 on 20 June 1987, after a protracted battle with prostate cancer. In 1990, the Sálim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (SACON) was established at Coimbatore by the Government of India. Pondicherry University established the Salim Ali School of Ecology and Environmental Sciences. The government of Goa set up the Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary and the Thattakad bird sanctuary near Vembanad in Kerala also goes by his name. The location of the BNHS headquarters in Mumbai was renamed as &quot;Dr Salim Ali Chowk&quot;. In 1972, Kitti Thonglongya discovered a misidentified specimen in the collection of the BNHS and described a new species that he called &quot;Latidens salimalii&quot;, considered one of the world&#x27;s rarest bats, and the only species in the genus &quot;Latidens&quot;. The subspecies of the rock bush quail (&quot;Perdicula argoondah salimalii&quot;) and the eastern population of Finn&#x27;s weaver (&quot;Ploceus megarhynchus salimalii&quot;) were named after him by Whistler and Abdulali respectively. A subspecies of the black-rumped flameback woodpecker (&quot;Dinopium benghalense tehminae&quot;) was named after his wife, Tehmina, by Whistler and Kinnear. Salim Ali&#x27;s swift (&quot;Apus salimalii&quot;) originally described as a population of &quot;Apus pacificus&quot; was recognised as a full species in 2011 while &quot;Zoothera salimalii&quot;, an undescribed population within the &quot;Zoothera mollissima&quot; complex, was named after him in 2016. 
On his 100th birth Anniversary (12 November 1996) Postal Department of Government of India released a set of two postal stamps.

==Writings==
Salim Ali wrote numerous journal articles, chiefly in the &quot;Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society&quot;. He also wrote a number of popular and academic books, many of which remain in print. Ali credited Tehmina, who had studied in England, for helping improve his English prose. Some of his literary pieces were used in a collection of English writing. A popular article that he wrote in 1930, &quot;Stopping by the woods on a Sunday morning&quot;, was reprinted in &quot;The Indian Express&quot; on his birthday in 1984. His most popular work was &quot;The Book of Indian Birds&quot;, written in the style of Whistler&#x27;s &quot;Popular Handbook of Birds&quot;, first published in 1941 and subsequently translated into several languages with numerous later editions. The first ten editions sold more than forty-six thousand copies. The first edition was reviewed by Ernst Mayr in 1943, who commended it while noting that the illustrations were not to the standard of American bird-books. His &quot;magnum opus&quot; was however the 10 volume &quot;Handbook of the Birds of India and Pakistan&quot; written with Dillon Ripley and often referred to as &quot;the handbook&quot;. This work began in 1964 and ended in 1974 with a second edition completed after his death by others, notably J. S. Serrao of the BNHS, Bruce Beehler, Michel Desfayes and Pamela Rasmussen. A single volume &quot;compact edition&quot; of the &quot;Handbook&quot; was also produced and a supplementary illustrative work, the first to cover all the birds of India, &quot;A Pictorial Guide to the Birds of the Indian Subcontinent&quot;, by John Henry Dick and Dillon Ripley was published in 1983. The plates from this work were incorporated in the second edition of the &quot;Handbook&quot;. He also produced a number of regional field guides, including &quot;The Birds of Kerala&quot; (the first edition in 1953 was titled &quot;The Birds of Travancore and Cochin&quot;), &quot;The Birds of Sikkim&quot;, &quot;The Birds of Kutch&quot; (later as &quot;The Birds of Gujarat&quot;), &quot;Indian Hill Birds&quot; and &quot;Birds of the Eastern Himalayas&quot;. Several low-cost book were produced by the National Book Trust including &quot;Common Birds&quot; (1967) coauthored with his niece Laeeq Futehally which was reprinted in several editions with translations into Hindi and other languages. In 1985 he wrote his autobiography &quot;The Fall of a Sparrow&quot;. Ali provided his own vision for the Bombay Natural History Society, noting the importance of conservation action. In the 1986 issue of the &quot;Journal&quot; &quot;of the BNHS&quot; he noted the role that the BNHS had played, the changing interests from hunting to conservation captured in 64 volumes that were preserved in microfiche copies, and the zenith that he claimed it had reached under the exceptional editorship of S H Prater.

A two-volume compilation of his shorter letters and writings was published in 2006, edited by Tara Gandhi, one of his last students. She also edited a collection of transcripts of radio talks given by Salim Ali, which was published in 2021.

<text>James Chance, also known as James White (born James Siegfried, April 20, 1953 – June 18, 2024), was an American saxophonist, keyboard player, and singer.

A key figure in no wave, Chance played a combination of improvisational jazz-like music and punk in the New York music scene from the late 1970s on, in such bands as Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, James Chance and the Contortions, James White and the Blacks (as he appeared in the film &quot;Downtown 81&quot;), The Flaming Demonics, James Chance &amp; the Sardonic Symphonics, James Chance and Terminal City, and James Chance and Les Contortions.

== Background ==
James Siegfried was born in Milwaukee in 1953, growing up there and in the suburb of Brookfield, Wisconsin. Siegfried attended Michigan State University, then the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music in Milwaukee. There, he joined a band named Death, which performed covers of the Stooges and the Velvet Underground before moving toward original songs. 

==Career==
At the end of 1975, Siegfried dropped out and moved to New York City after the dissolution of the band and the death of its singer. He quickly became active in both the free jazz and no wave punk rock scenes. His first band in New York in 1976 was an instrumental quartet with violin, drums and bass called Flaming Youth. He started Teenage Jesus and the Jerks with Lydia Lunch the same year. In 1977, after studying for a short time under David Murray, he formed The Contortions, who fused jazz improvisation and funky rhythms, with live shows often ending in violent confrontations with audience members. By this time, he had adopted the stage name James Chance. The Contortions reached a wider audience with their contribution to the Brian Eno-compiled &quot;No New York&quot; collection of No Wave acts. The band appeared in Rosa von Praunheim&#x27;s film &quot;Das Todesmagazin&quot; in 1979.

While Chance shared an apartment with No Wave musical luminary Lydia Lunch, the duo created seminal No Wave group Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, which Chance soon left.

Chance was noted for engaging in physical confrontations, from forcing the audience out of their seats and getting in fist fights with his New York City audience, including rock critic Robert Christgau. At first, this was just an attempt to engage the passive New York audience, but this practice is reported to have somewhat diminished after audiences came to expect the physical confrontations. He discussed issues of race and working with black musicians in a number of interviews.

In 1979, Chance collaborated with Arto Lindsay, Bradley Field, and George Scott on the soundtrack to Diego Cortez&#x27;s film &quot;Grutzi Elvis&quot;.
Chance&#x27;s stage and musical persona were finalized by romantic partner and agent Anya Phillips, who died of cancer in 1981. Frictions between Chance and band members eventually led to a breakup of the Contortions in the fall of 1979. The Contortions released one album, &quot;Buy&quot; in late 1979, and another album, &quot;Off White&quot;, under the pseudonym James White and the Blacks in 1980 (featuring Lydia Lunch under the pseudonym Stella Rico). Chance re-formed James White and the Blacks with a completely different lineup that appeared on the 1982 album &quot;Sax Maniac&quot; which was dedicated to Phillips. The group released one more album, &quot;Melt Yourself Down&quot;, a very limited Japanese release.

The first version of the Blacks was set up by Joseph Bowie. Shortly after, Defunkt emerged from the Blacks. In 1982 Chance toured with the re-formed James White and the Blacks with his brother David &quot;Tremor&quot; Siegfried and his band David and the Happenings from Carbondale, Illinois, playing Chicago, their hometown Milwaukee, and much of the Midwest.

Chance briefly relocated to Paris, returning to New York City in 1983 to record the album &quot;James White Presents The Flaming Demonics&quot;.

In 1987, he contributed saxophone to The False Prophets&#x27; &quot;Implosion&quot; album.

In 2001, Chance reunited with original Contortions members Jody Harris (guitar), Pat Place (slide guitar), and Don Christensen (drums) for a few limited engagements. Original keyboard player Adele Bertei appeared briefly, but bass player George Scott III had died of an accidental drug overdose in 1980 and his slot was filled by Erik Sanko. The reunited group played twice at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties music festival, and, in 2008, at the PS1 Warm Up series. Chance also recorded with Blondie after coming out of semi-retirement. Tiger Style records released the 4-CD box set retrospective &quot;Irresistible Impulse&quot; to critical acclaim in 2003. A live-DVD &quot;James Chance – Chance of a Lifetime: Live in Chicago 2003&quot; was released in 2005.

In addition to limited engagements with the original Contortions, Chance occasionally performed and recorded with the Chicago band Watchers. In Europe, he performed with James Chance &amp; Les Contortions, French musicians who had been his backing band since 2006. They played a 15-show Europe tour in April and May 2007 and were back in Europe in October 2007. In May 2012 they released the CD &quot;Incorrigible!&quot; on the French label LADTK, comprising seven Chance originals and two covers, all of them brand new recordings.

In 2009 Chance made occasional appearances playing keyboards in NYC with a trio, with the material restricted to close readings of jazz standards. In June 2012, Chance played in Portland, Oregon with local group Ancient Heat as his backing band. They played a number of songs from various points in his career, including a new cover of Gil Scott-Heron&#x27;s &quot;Home is Where The Hatred Is.&quot;
In 2016, 19-year-old Dylan Greenberg directed James Chance in the music video for a re-recorded version of Melt Yourself Down, his first music video in nearly 20 years. The video premiered on MOJO. He gave his final performance in 2019.

==Death==
Chance was in poor health in the final years of his life, and he died from a gastrointestinal disease at a nursing home in East Harlem on June 18, 2024, at the age of 71.

<text>Riverfront Stadium, also known as Cinergy Field from 1996 to 2002, was a multi-purpose stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was the home of the Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1970 through 2002 and the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League (NFL) from 1970 to 1999. Located on the Ohio River in downtown Cincinnati, the stadium was best known as the home of &quot;The Big Red Machine&quot;, as the Reds were often called in the 1970s.

Construction began on February 1, 1968, and was completed at a cost of less than $50 million. Riverfront&#x27;s grand opening was held on June 30, 1970, an 8–2 Reds loss to the Atlanta Braves. Braves right fielder Hank Aaron hit the first home run in Riverfront&#x27;s history, a two-run shot in the first inning which also served as the stadium&#x27;s first runs batted in. Two weeks later on July 14, 1970, Riverfront hosted the 1970 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. This game is best remembered for the often-replayed collision at home plate between Reds star Pete Rose and catcher Ray Fosse of the Cleveland Indians.

In September 1996, Riverfront Stadium was renamed &quot;Cinergy Field&quot; in a sponsorship deal with Greater Cincinnati energy company Cinergy. In 2001, to make room for Great American Ball Park, the seating capacity at Cinergy Field was reduced to 39,000. There was a huge in-play wall in center field visible after the renovations, to serve as the batter&#x27;s eye. The stadium was demolished by implosion on December 29, 2002.

==History==
Riverfront was a multi-purpose, circular &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; stadium, one of many built in the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s as communities sought to save money by having their football and baseball teams share the same facility. Riverfront, Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis, Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta, Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh, Shea Stadium in New York and Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C., all opened within a few years of each other and were largely indistinguishable from one another; in particular, it was often confused with fellow Ohio River cookie-cutter Three Rivers Stadium by sportscasters because of the two stadium&#x27;s similar names and similar designs.

One feature of Riverfront that distinguished it from other cookie-cutters was that the field level seats (&quot;blue&quot; seats) for baseball were divided in half directly behind home plate. For conversion to a football seating configuration, the third-base side stands were wheeled around clockwise on a track to the area of left field. The first-base side remained stationary. This setup provided a more rectangular zone for the football configuration. The AstroTurf panels covering the tracks could be seen in left field during Reds games.

The site Riverfront Stadium sat on originally included the 2nd Street tenement, birthplace and boyhood home of cowboy singer and actor Roy Rogers, who joked that he was born &quot;somewhere between second base and center field.&quot;

Riverfront Stadium&#x27;s scoreboard was designed by American Sign and Indicator, but in its last years was maintained by Trans-Lux. That scoreboard would be upgraded in the 1980s with the addition of an adjacent Sony JumboTron. The playing field was originally illuminated by 1,648 thousand-watt GTE Sylvania Metalarc lamps.

===Big Red Machine===
The Reds moved to Riverfront Stadium midway through the 1970 season, after spending over 86 years at the intersection of Findlay Street and Western Avenue – the last 57½ of those years at Crosley Field. Riverfront quickly earned a place in Cincinnati&#x27;s century-long baseball tradition as the home of one of the best teams in baseball history. The Reds had only won three pennants in their final 39 years at Crosley Field (1939, 1940, 1961) but made the World Series in Riverfront&#x27;s first year (1970) and a total of four times in the stadium&#x27;s first seven years, with the Reds winning back-to-back championships in 1975 and 1976. The World Series would return in 1990, with Cincinnati winning the first two of a four-game sweep of the Oakland Athletics at Riverfront.

Baseball purists disliked Riverfront&#x27;s artificial turf, but Reds&#x27; Manager Sparky Anderson and General Manager Bob Howsam took advantage of it by encouraging speed and line drive hitting that could produce doubles, triples and high-bouncing infield hits. Players who combined power and speed like Joe Morgan, Pete Rose and Ken Griffey, Sr. thrived there. On defense, the fast surface and virtually dirtless infield (see photo) rewarded range and quickness by both outfielders and infielders, like shortstop Dave Concepción who used the turf to bounce many of his long throws to first. Catcher Johnny Bench and first baseman Tony Pérez played here. The artificial turf covered not only the normal grass area of the ballpark but also most of the normally dirt-covered portion of the infield; the infield area boundary where dirt would normally be was denoted with a white lined arc. Only the pitcher&#x27;s mound, the home plate area (in two circled areas), and cutouts around first, second and third bases had dirt surfaces (which were covered in five-sided diamond shaped areas). This was the first stadium in the majors with this &quot;sliding pit&quot; configuration. Most of the new stadiums with artificial turf that would follow (Veterans Stadium, Royals Stadium, Louisiana Superdome, Olympic Stadium (Montreal), Exhibition Stadium, Kingdome, Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, B.C. Place, SkyDome) installed sliding pits as the original layout, and the existing artificial turf fields in San Francisco, Houston, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis would change to the cut-out configuration within the next few years after Riverfront&#x27;s opening.

Riverfront hosted the MLB All-Star Game twice: first on July 14, 1970, with President Richard Nixon in attendance (51,838 total attendance), and again on July 12, 1988 (55,837 attendance).

===Professional football===
Despite Cincinnati&#x27;s love of baseball, it was the prospect of a professional football team that finally moved the city to end 20 years of discussion and build a new stadium on the downtown riverfront. After playing for two seasons at Nippert Stadium on the University of Cincinnati campus, the Bengals built on the Reds&#x27; success in the stadium&#x27;s first year when they recorded their first winning season and playoff appearance in 1970, just their third year of existence.

Perhaps the most memorable football game at Riverfront Stadium was the 1981 AFC Championship Game on January 10, 1982. The game became known as the &quot;Freezer Bowl&quot; and was won by the Bengals over the San Diego Chargers, 27–7. The air temperature during the game was and the wind chill was , the coldest in NFL history. The win earned the Bengals their first of two trips to the Super Bowl (XVI) while playing at Riverfront Stadium, and the first of three in team history overall.

Riverfront Stadium hosted the 1988 AFC Championship Game, as the Bengals beat the Buffalo Bills 21–10 to advance to their second Super Bowl appearance.

During the Bengals&#x27; tenure, they defeated every visiting franchise at least once, enjoying perfect records against the Arizona Cardinals (4-0), New York Giants (4-0), and Philadelphia Eagles (3-0). They posted a 5–1 record in playoff games played in Riverfront Stadium, with victories over the Buffalo Bills (twice), San Diego Chargers, Seattle Seahawks, and Houston Oilers. Their only home playoff loss came to the New York Jets.

For most of the Bengals&#x27; tenure at the stadium, the field contained only the basic markings required for play. Until the late 1990s, there wasn&#x27;t a logo at midfield or any writing in the end zone, which had long become standard in NFL stadiums.

During the 1988 season as the Bengals were making another Super Bowl run, Riverfront Stadium was nicknamed the Jungle as the Bengals went a perfect 10-0 at home during the regular season and in the playoffs. With the new stadium nickname, the fans and team adopted the Guns N&#x27; Roses song &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; as the unofficial theme song for the Bengals. When Paul Brown Stadium (now Paycor Stadium) opened in 2000, the Jungle theme was incorporated into the stadium design.

===College football===
Between 1970 and 1990 Riverfront Stadium hosted 25 University of Cincinnati football games to accommodate higher-caliber visiting teams and local rivals which would overwhelm demand in their usual on-campus home, Nippert Stadium (which then could only hold 28,000). Among the Bearcats&#x27; opponents were the University of Maryland, University of Kentucky, University of Louisville, Boston College, West Virginia University, Penn State University, whose 1985 game took place with the Nittany Lions number one in the coaches&#x27; poll, and the University of Miami three times, twice while the Hurricanes were the defending national champions. It would be a temporary full-time home for the Bearcats during the 1990 season, when Nippert Stadium was undergoing renovations.

The Bearcats finished with a 12–13 all-time record at Riverfront.

===Final years as a baseball-only stadium===

When the Bengals moved to Paul Brown Stadium in 2000, the Reds were left as Riverfront Stadium’s only tenant. Prior to the 2001 baseball season, the stadium was remodeled into a baseball-only configuration, and the artificial turf surface being replaced with natural grass.
To allow room for the construction of Great American Ball Park (which was being built largely over the grounds the stadium already sat on), a large section of the left and center field stands was removed and the distance to the fences was shortened by . A wall was built in deep center field to prevent easy home runs. The new Great American Ball Park and old Riverfront Stadium were 26 inches apart at their closest point during this time. In the Reds&#x27; final two seasons in the stadium, ongoing construction on Great American was plainly visible just beyond the outfield walls while the team played their games. The stadium&#x27;s final game was played on September 22, 2002, as the Reds lost 4–3 to the Philadelphia Phillies before a crowd of 40,964. Reds third baseman Aaron Boone hit the final home run in Riverfront&#x27;s history in the loss, an eighth-inning solo home run off Phillies reliever Dan Plesac.

The stadium was demolished by implosion on December 29, 2002. Part of the former Riverfront Stadium site is now occupied by Great American Ball Park (which would open the following April) and the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, along with several mixed-use developments and parking facilities. A small portion of the site is now occupied by the Reds&#x27; Hall of Fame and Museum and Main Street, which was extended when the new park was built and when the old park was demolished.

<text>Cesare Cantù (; December 5, 1804March 11, 1895) was an Italian historian, writer, archivist and politician. An immensely prolific writer, Cantù was one of Italy&#x27;s best-known and most important Romantic scholars.

==Biography==
Cantù was born December 5, 1804, at Brivio, near Como in Lombardy. The eldest of ten children, he belonged to an old though impoverished family. He studied in Milan, at the Barnabite College of St. Alexander, and began his career as a teacher. In 1822 he began teaching literature at the liceo in his native Brivio. He went on to teach in Como, and in 1832 in Milan. His first literary essay (1828) was a romantic poem entitled &quot;Algiso&quot;, and in the following year, he produced a &quot;Storia della città e della diocesi di Como&quot; in two volumes (Como, 1829). Shortly afterwards appeared &quot;Ragionamenti sulla Storia Lombarda nel secolo XVII&quot; (Milan, 1832), which was published later under the title &quot;Commento storico ai Promessi Sposi di A. Manzoni, o la Lombardia nel secolo XVII&quot;. The death of his father then left him in charge of a large family, and he worked very hard both as a teacher and a writer to provide for them. His prodigious literary activity led to his falling under the suspicions of the Austrian police, who thought he was a member of Young Italy, and he was arrested in 1833.

While in prison, writing materials were denied him, but he managed to write on rags with a tooth-pick and candle smoke, and thus composed the historical novel &quot;Margherita Pusterla&quot; (Milan, 1838). On his release a year later, as he was prohibited from teaching, literature became his only recourse. In 1836 the Turinese publisher, Giuseppe Pomba, commissioned him to write a universal history, which his vast reading enabled him to do. In six years the work was completed in seventy-two volumes, and immediately achieved a general popularity; the publisher made a fortune out of it, and Cantù&#x27;s royalties amounted, it is said, to 300,000 lire (£12,000). The work was often reprinted, and has been translated into English, German, French, and Spanish. It is the first historical work by an Italian which, in a well-finished and vigorous style, gives a philosophical treatment of the development of all civilized peoples from the remotest times to the pontificate of Pius IX. In 1846 Cantù published a successful collection of poems for children entitled &quot;Fior di memoria pei bambini&quot;. He collaborated with the most important Italian academic journals, including the &quot;Annali universali di statistica&quot;, directed by Gian Domenico Romagnosi, the &quot;Antologia&quot;, directed by Giovan Pietro Vieusseux, and the &quot;Ricoglitore italiano e straniero&quot;, which mainly dealt with historical and literary subjects.
Just before the revolution of 1848, being warned that he would be arrested, he fled to Turin, but after the Five Days he returned to Milan and edited a paper called &quot;La Guardia Nazionale&quot;. Between 1849 and 1850 he published his &quot;Storia degli Italiani&quot; (Turin, 1855) and many other works. In 1857 the archduke Maximilian tried to conciliate the Milanese by the promise of a constitution, and Cantù was one of the few Liberals who accepted the olive branch, and went about in company with the archduke. This act was regarded as treason and caused Cantù much annoyance in later years. He continued his literary activity after the formation of the Italian kingdom, producing volume after volume until his death. He was a member of Parliament from 1859 to 1861. A staunch Catholic, Cantù opposed the bill establishing civil marriage and was one of the few MPs to vote against the separation of church and state. In 1873 he founded the Lombard historical society, and was appointed superintendent of the State Archives of Milan. On 27 February 1867 Cantù was elected corresponding member of the Institut de France and in 1875 he became a member of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei.

Cantù died in Milan on March 11, 1895, and was buried in his hometown of Brivio. Cantù showed the influence of the Romantic school, of which Alessandro Manzoni is the most important representative, and he sought to combine Church and State, politics and religion. The effect of the Romantic movement is particularly evident in those works in which Cantù treated the history of Italy of his own time, as in: &quot;Storia dei cent&#x27;anni, 1750-1850&quot; (5 vols., Florence, 1851); &quot;Storia degli Italiani&quot; (3 vols., Turin, 1879). His brother Ignazio (1810-1877) was, like him, a teacher and prolific writer, principally of historical and educational works of a strongly moralizing nature. His best-known fiction is the historical novel &quot;Il marchese Annibale Perrone&quot; (1842), which, like its Manzonian model, is set in the 17th century.

<text>The yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes), known also as hoiho, is a species of penguin endemic to New Zealand. It is the sole extant species in the genus Megadyptes.

Previously thought closely related to the little penguin (&quot;Eudyptula minor&quot;), molecular research has shown it more closely related to penguins of the genus &quot;Eudyptes&quot;. Like most penguins, it is mainly piscivorous.

The species breeds along the eastern and south-eastern coastlines of the South Island of New Zealand, as well as Stewart Island, Auckland Islands, and Campbell Islands. Colonies on the Otago Peninsula are a popular tourist venue, where visitors may closely observe penguins from hides, trenches, or tunnels.

On the New Zealand mainland, the species has experienced a significant decline over the past 20 years. On the Otago Peninsula, numbers have dropped by 75% since the mid-1990s and population trends indicate the possibility of local extinction in the next 20 to 40 years. While the effect of rising ocean temperatures is still being studied, an infectious outbreak in the mid-2000s played a large role in the drop. Human activities at sea (fisheries, pollution) may have an equal if not greater influence on the species&#x27; downward trend.

== Taxonomy ==
The yellow-eyed penguin was first described by Jacques Bernard Hombron and Honoré Jacquinot in 1841.

The yellow-eyed penguin is the sole species in the genus &quot;Megadyptes&quot;. It was previously thought closely related to the little penguin but new molecular research has shown it is more closely related to penguins of the genus &quot;Eudyptes&quot;. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA evidence suggests it split from the ancestors of &quot;Eudyptes&quot; around 15 million years ago. In 2019 the 1.25Gb genome of the species was published as part of the Penguin Genome Consortium, and this will help resolve the origins and aid conservation by helping to inform any future breeding programmes.

=== Subspecies ===

* &quot;M. a. antipodes&quot;, yellow-eyed penguin. The only extant subspecies. Formerly most abundant in the subantarctic Auckland and Campbell Islands, it colonised Stewart Island / Rakiura and part of the South Island after the extinction of the Waitaha penguin.
* &quot;M. a. waitaha&quot;, Waitaha penguin. Extinct. Was present in the North Island, South Island, Stewart Island, and Codfish Island / Whenua Hou. Last dated to 1347–1529 AD. It was discovered by University of Otago and University of Adelaide scientists comparing the foot bones of 500-year-old, 100-year-old and modern specimens of penguins. According to lead researcher Sanne Boessenkool, Waitaha penguins &quot;were around 10% smaller than the yellow-eyed penguin. The two species are very closely related, but we can&#x27;t say if they had a yellow crown.&quot; The penguin was named for the Māori iwi (tribe) Waitaha, whose tribal lands included the areas the Waitaha penguin are thought to have inhabited. &quot;Our findings demonstrate that yellow-eyed penguins on mainland New Zealand are not a declining remnant of a previous abundant population, but came from the subantarctic relatively recently and replaced the extinct Waitaha penguin,&quot; said team member Dr Jeremy Austin, deputy director of the Australasian Centre for Ancient DNA. Archaeological remains indicate that early Polynesian settlers hunted the species and that this, with possible additional predation by Polynesian rats and dogs, was a probable cause of extinction. As the local Māori people have no record of this subspecies, it is estimated to have perished between c. 1300 and 1500, soon after Polynesian settlers arrived in New Zealand. Described as a new species &quot;M. waitaha&quot; in 2009, but reclassified as a subspecies &quot;M. a. waitaha&quot; in studies from 2019 and 2022. After their extinction, their range was occupied by yellow-eyed penguins (now &quot;Megadyptes antipodes antipodes&quot;), previously most abundant in the subantarctic islands further south. The decrease in sea lion populations after human settlement may also have eased their expansion. Another coauthor, Dr Phil Seddon, said &quot;these unexpected results highlight ... the dynamic nature of ecosystem change, where the loss of one species may open up opportunities for the expansion of another.&quot;
* &quot;M. a. richdalei&quot;, Richdale&#x27;s penguin. Extinct. A dwarf subspecies from the Chatham Islands. Last dated after the 13th century. It was hunted to extinction.

== Description ==
The yellow-eyed penguin (&quot;M. a. antipodes&quot;) is most easily identified by the band of pale yellow feathers surrounding its eyes and encircling the back of its head. Its forehead, crown and the sides of its face are slate grey flecked with golden yellow. Its eye is yellow. The foreneck and sides of the head are light brown. The back and tail are slate blue-black. Its chest, stomach, thighs and the underside of its flippers are white in colour. Juvenile birds have a greyer head with no yellow band around their eyes.

It is the largest living penguin to breed on the mainland of New Zealand and the fourth or fifth heaviest living penguin by body mass. It stands tall and weighs . Weight varies throughout the year, with penguins being heaviest just before moulting, during which they may lose 3–4 kilograms in weight. Males at around on average are somewhat heavier than females at an average of .

The yellow-eyed penguin may be long lived, with some individuals reaching 20 years of age. Males are generally longer lived than females, leading to a sex ratio of 2:1 around the age of 10–12 years.

The yellow-eyed penguin is mostly silent. It makes a shrill bray-like call at nest and breeding sites.

==Distribution and habitat==
Until recently, it was assumed that &quot;M. a. antipodes&quot; was widespread and abundant before the arrival of Polynesian settlers in New Zealand. However, genetic analysis has since revealed that its range only expanded to include mainland New Zealand in the past 200 years. Yellow-eyed penguins expanded out of the subantarctic to replace New Zealand&#x27;s endemic Waitaha penguin (&quot;M. waitaha&quot;). The Waitaha penguin became extinct between about 1300 and 1500, soon after Polynesian settlers arrived in New Zealand. Jeremy Austin, a member of the team that discovered the Waitaha penguin, said, &quot;Our findings demonstrate that yellow-eyed penguins on mainland New Zealand are not a declining remnant of a previous abundant population, but came from the subantarctic relatively recently and replaced the extinct Waitaha penguin.&quot;

A dwarf subspecies from the Chatham Islands, &quot;M. a. richdalei,&quot; is extinct. The modern population of yellow-eyed penguins does not breed on the Chatham Islands.

Today, yellow-eyed penguins are found in two distinct populations. The northern population extends along the southeast coast of the South Island of New Zealand, down to Stewart Island / Rakiura and Codfish Island / Whenua Hou. It includes four main breeding areas in Banks Peninsula, North Otago, Otago Peninsula and the Catlins. It is also referred to as the mainland population. The southern population includes the subantarctic Auckland Islands and Campbell Island / Motu Ihupuku. There is little gene flow between the northern and southern populations as the large stretch of ocean between the South Island and subantarctic region and the subtropical convergence act as a natural barrier. Based on monitoring between 2012-2017, there are on average 577 breeding pairs per year on Enderby Island in the Auckland Islands, which comprise 37-49% of the total breeding population for the species.

== Behaviour ==

=== Breeding ===

Whether yellow-eyed penguins are colonial nesters has been an ongoing point of debate among zoologists in New Zealand. Most Antarctic penguin species nest in large, high density aggregations of birds; in contrast, yellow-eyed penguins do not nest within sight of each other. While they can be seen coming ashore in groups of four to six or more individuals, they then disperse along tracks to individual nest sites up to one kilometre inland. Accordingly, the consensus among New Zealand penguin workers is to use habitat rather than colony to refer to areas where yellow-eyed penguins nest.

First breeding occurs at three to four years of age and long-term partnerships are formed. Nest sites are selected in August and normally two eggs are laid in September. The incubation duties (lasting 39–51 days) are shared by both parents, who may spend several days on the nest at a time. For the first six weeks after hatching, the chicks are guarded during the day by one parent while the other is at sea feeding. The foraging adult returns at least daily to feed the chicks and relieve the partner. After the chicks are six weeks of age, both parents go to sea to supply food to their rapidly growing offspring. Chicks usually fledge in mid-February and are totally independent from then on. Chick fledge weights are generally between 5 and 6 kg.

=== Feeding ===

Around 90% of the yellow-eyed penguin&#x27;s diet is made up of fish, chiefly demersal species that live near the seafloor, including silversides (&quot;Argentina elongata&quot;), blue cod (&quot;Parapercis colias&quot;), red cod (&quot;Pseudophycis bachus&quot;), and opalfish (&quot;Hemerocoetes monopterygius&quot;). Other species taken are New Zealand blueback sprat (&quot;Sprattus antipodum&quot;) and cephalopods such as arrow squid (&quot;Nototodarus sloanii&quot;). They also eat some crustaceans, including krill (&quot;Nyctiphanes australis&quot;). Recently, jellyfish were found to be targeted by the penguins. While initially thought that the birds would prey on jellyfish itself, deployments of camera loggers revealed that the penguins were going after juvenile fish and fish larvae associated with jellyfish.

Breeding penguins usually undertake two kinds of foraging trips: day trips where the birds leave at dawn and return in the evening ranging up to 25 km from their colonies, and shorter evening trips during which the birds are seldom away from their nest longer than four hours or range farther than 7 km. Yellow-eyed penguins are known to be an almost exclusive benthic forager that searches for prey along the seafloor. Accordingly, up to 90% of their dives are benthic dives. This also means that their average dive depths are determined by the water depths within their home ranges, but can swim up to 240 meters below the water surface.

==Conservation==

The yellow-eyed penguin is considered one of the rarest penguin species in the world. It is listed on the IUCN Red List as being endangered. It was first included on the list in 1988 when it was listed as threatened. Its status has since been changed to endangered in the year 2000. It is estimated that in the past 15 years the population has dropped by 75%.

It had an estimated population of 4000 in 2007. The main threats include habitat degradation and introduced predators. It may be the most ancient of all living penguins.

A reserve protecting more than 10% of the mainland population was established at Long Point in the Catlins in November 2007 by the Department of Conservation and the Yellow-eyed Penguin Trust.

In August 2010, the yellow-eyed penguin was granted protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.

=== Threats ===

In spring 2004, a previously undescribed disease killed off 60% of yellow-eyed penguin chicks on the Otago Peninsula and in North Otago. The disease has been linked to an infection of &quot;Corynebacterium&quot;, a genus of bacteria that also causes diphtheria in humans. It has been described as diphtheritic stomatitis and the pathogen identified. A similar problem has affected the Stewart Island population. Treatment of chicks in hospital has proven successful with 88% of 41 chicks treated in 2022 surviving.

==Tourism==
Several mainland habitats have hides and are relatively accessible for those wishing to watch the birds come ashore. These include beaches at Oamaru, the Moeraki lighthouse, a number of beaches near Dunedin, and the Catlins. In addition, commercial tourist operations on Otago Peninsula also provide hides to view yellow-eyed penguins. However, the yellow-eyed penguin cannot be found in zoos because it will not reproduce in captivity. Studies have shown however, that human presence in their habitats negatively impacts their foraging and breeding habits.

== In culture ==
*The hoiho appears on the reverse side of the New Zealand five-dollar note.
*The yellow-eyed penguin is the mascot to Dunedin City Council&#x27;s recycling and solid waste management campaign.
*The yellow-eyed penguin is also featured in &quot;Farce of the Penguins&quot;, in which they complain about global warming.
*In 2019 the yellow-eyed penguin was crowned the Bird of the Year in New Zealand, the first win for a seabird in the competition&#x27;s 14-year history. It was again victorious in the 2024 competition.

<text>Teenage Jesus and the Jerks were an American no wave band, based in New York City, who formed part of the city&#x27;s no wave movement.

== Background ==
Lydia Lunch met saxophonist James Chance at CBGB and moved into his two-room apartment. She started to combine her poetry with acoustic guitar and was spurred to start a band after seeing one of Mars&#x27; earlier performances. Lunch found guitarist Reck at CBGB and recruited him as a drummer, later moving him to bass. They formed a band called the Scabs and briefly added Jody Harris to their line-up. Lunch knew Bradley Field through Miriam Linna and convinced him to join in early 1977.

The band put together a ten-minute set of very short songs. It released only a handful of singles.

Featured on the seminal &quot;No New York&quot; LP, a showcase of the early no wave scene, compiled and produced by Brian Eno, the group left behind little more than a dozen complete recorded songs. Most of the surviving titles were collected on the eighteen-minute career retrospective compilation &quot;Everything&quot;, released in 1995 through Atavistic Records. However, other studio versions of several songs exist, alongside a few live recordings.

The group disbanded at the end of 1979, only reuniting briefly in 2008 for a small number of performances with former bassist Jim Sclavunos on drums and Thurston Moore on bass guitar.

== Musical style and philosophy ==
In his book &quot;Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978–1984&quot;, Simon Reynolds identifies Teenage Jesus and the Jerks as an exercise in rock sacrilege:

Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, and their comrade bands Mars, Contortions and DNA, defined radicalism not as a return to roots but as deracination. Curiously, the no wave groups staged their revolt against rock tradition by using the standard rock format of guitars, bass and drums. It was as if they felt the easy electronic route to making post-rock noise was too easy. Instead, they used rock&#x27;s tools against itself. Which is why no wave music irresistibly invites metaphors of dismemberment, desecration, defiling rock&#x27;s corpse.

Lydia Lunch has voiced her disdain for punk rock, claiming in &quot;Rip It Up&quot;: &quot;I hated almost the entirety of punk rock. I don&#x27;t think that no wave had anything to do with it. Who wanted chords, all these progressions that had been used to death in rock? To play slide guitar I&#x27;d use a knife, a beer bottle... glass gave the best sound. To this day I still don&#x27;t know a single chord on the guitar.&quot;

<doc id="567438" wikidata="Q1247724" url="?curid=567438" title="Tizona">
<text>Tizona (also Tizón) is the name of one of the swords carried by Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, El Cid, according to the &quot;Cantar de Mio Cid&quot;. The name of the second sword of El Cid is &quot;Colada&quot;.

A sword identified as &quot;Tizona&quot; was given by Ferdinand II of Aragon to Pedro de Peralta, count of Santisteban de Lerín in c. 1470. This sword was long kept in Marcilla Castle, later in the Army Museum in Madrid and since 2007 in the Museo de Burgos.

==Name==
The name used in the &quot;Cantar de Mio Cid&quot; is &quot;Tizón&quot;.
The form &quot;Tizona&quot; has been in use since the late medieval period (14th century). 
The blade inscription on the Marcilla sword, presumably of the 13th or 14th century, has the form &quot;TIZONA&quot;.

The older form of the name, &quot;tizón&quot;, is a word for &quot;firebrand&quot; (&quot;leño encendido&quot;, from Latin &quot;titionem&quot;).
Sebastián de Covarrubias (1611) recognizes this as the plausible origin of the name &quot;Tizona&quot;, but also adduces possible derivation from τυχωνα, the name of the lance of Severus Alexander, or from τύχη &quot;fortuna&quot;.

James I of Aragon (r. 1213–1276) according to the &quot;Llibre dels fets&quot; had a sword named &quot;Tisó&quot;. The description of this sword makes no reference to El Cid, suggesting that &quot;tizon&quot; &quot;firebrand&quot; was in use as a generic term for &quot;sword&quot; (c.f. the same use of English &quot;brand&quot;).
The extended (feminine) form &quot;tizona&quot;, by reference to El Cid&#x27;s sword, could later also stand in as a poetic synonym of &quot;sword&quot; in general.

==Literary tradition==
According to the &quot;Cantar de Mio Cid&quot;, El Cid won the sword from its previous owner, King Yucef in Valencia. Afterward, it was given by El Cid to his sons-in-law, the Infantes de Carrión but eventually returned into the possession of El Cid.

In the poem, Tizona&#x27;s power depends on the wielder, and it frightens unworthy opponents. When the infantes of Carrión had Tizona, they underestimated the power of the sword, due to their cowardice, but when Pero Vermúdez was going to fight Ferrán González and unsheathed Tizona (a gift from El Cid), Ferrán González yelled and surrendered, cowering in terror at the sight of Tizona (verses 3642-3645):
According to legend, after his death in 1099, the body of El Cid was seated in full armour and in the monastery church of San Pedro de Cardeña, and there with the sword Tizona struck down a Jew who plucked the dead hero&#x27;s beard. The monks revived the stunned Jew, who let himself be baptized and under the name Diego Gil became the servant of El Cid&#x27;s squire Gil Diaz.

==Artefact==

===Description===
The &quot;Tizona&quot; sword was long owned by the Marquesses of Falces and kept in their Marcilla Castle; now in the Museo de Burgos, the sword has a length of long and a mass of . The broad blade is of type XIII, typical of c. the 12th century, with a narrow fuller running along less than half of the blade&#x27;s length.
The hilt is later, added in the time of the Catholic Monarchs, with the elaborate curved crossguard typical of the &quot;Hispano-Moorish&quot; style of the period.

Its blade carries acid etched inscriptions in the fullers on either side:
:&quot;YO SOY LA TIZONA ~ FUE : FECHA ~~ ENLAERA : DE : MILE : QVARENTA&quot; (&quot;&quot;, &quot;I am the Tizona, who was made in the year 1040&quot;)
:&quot;AVE : MARIA GRATIA ~~ PLENA DOMINVSSMECVN&quot; (&quot;&quot; , &quot;Hail Mary, full of grace; the Lord be with me&quot;)

Debate on the sword&#x27;s authenticity concerns the blade. If authentic, both the hilt and the inscription would have been added later (the inscription possibly in the 13th to 14th century, the hilt in the 15th century).
The date &quot;1040&quot; given in the description is traditionally identified as given in the Hispanic Era (38 BC), i.e. designating the year AD 1002. The name &quot;Tizona&quot; itself suggests a late medieval date, as early references use the name &quot;Tizón&quot;, with &quot;Tizona&quot; being recorded only from the 14th century.

Menéndez Pidal considered the entire sword to be a 16th-century forgery. By contrast, Bruhn de Hoffmeyer (1988) said that the blade may be identical to the sword listed as La Colada in the 1503 inventory. A 2001 examination performed by the Complutense University of Madrid concluded that the blade may indeed date from the 11th century.

Álvaro Soler del Campo, curator at the Museo del Ejército, points out that the sword is formed of three joined pieces and that their typology is the same as that of the handle, adornment, and the inscription, from the era of the Catholic Monarchs.

===History===
A sword identified as &quot;Tizona&quot; is listed in the treasure stock of the house of Castille, transferred by The 1st Duque de Trujillo, recovered in 1452 and placed in a 1503 inventory of the Alcázar of Segovia. 
The 1503 inventory reads &quot;a sword called Tizona, that belonged to El Cid; it has a channel in each side, with gilded lettering; it has a hilt, and cross, and a block of silver, and in relief castles and lions and a small golden lion on each part of the cross; and has a scabbard of red leather lined with green velvet.&quot;
This does not fit the description of the extant sword exhibited as &quot;Tizona&quot;, but the suggestion has been made that the sword listed as &quot;Colada&quot; in the same inventory may be the same now known as &quot;Tizona&quot; (Bruhn de Hoffmeyer 1988)

According to Prudencio de Sandoval&#x27;s &quot;Historia de los reyes de Castilla y León&quot; (1615), Ferdinand II of Aragon gave a sword identified as Tizona to Pedro de Peralta y Ezpeleta, first Count of Santisteban of Lerín (also cited as Antonio Carrillo de Peralta, 2nd Marqués de Falces), for services rendered in the negotiations that led to his marriage with Isabel of Castile in 1469. 
This sword remained in the possession of the Marqueses of Falces, from at least the 17th century kept in the Palacial Castle of Marcilla.

Marcilla Castle was plundered by the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War, but it was recovered by the Nationalist faction upon taking Figueres. The sword was properly stored in a crate, with a note &quot;Comrade, respect this sword, it is the sword of El Cid&quot; (&quot;Camarada, respeta esta espada, es la espada del Cid&quot;).
The sword was moved to the Museo del Ejército in Madrid and was on display there during 1944–2007, while remaining the property of the Marquesses of Falces.
The 14th &quot;Marqués&quot; in 1959 bequeathed ownership of the sword in equal parts to his two children, Pedro and Olga Velluti.
The siblings in 1980 confirmed the sword&#x27;s loan to the Museo del Ejército.
Pedro Velluti y Murga, 15th Marqués de Falces (1912-1987), died in 1987. In a will made two years earlier, he made Salustiano Fernández and his wife Jacinta Méndez his sole beneficiaries, &quot;for lacking forced heirs and having a sister [Olga] who abandoned him to his Luck, which could not have been better.&quot; Salustiano Fernández, an Asturias fisherman, and his wife had cared for the blind &quot;Marqués&quot; prior to his death. The marquessate passed to Olga Velluti, who became The 16th Marquesa de Falces. However, in 1997, she transferred the peerage to her son, José Ramón Suárez del Otero y Velluti, who thus became The 17th Marqués de Falces.

In 1999, The 17th Marqués de Falces announced his intention of selling the sword. The Ministry of Culture began a process of estimating the value of the artefact. The sword was declared &quot;Bien de Interés Cultural&quot; in January 2003.
In October 2003, the Ministry offered EUR 1.5 million, and The 17th Marqués de Falces accepted the offer.
However, a 2007 report cast doubt on the sword&#x27;s authenticity, and the Ministry withdrew its offer, reducing the estimated value to EUR 200,000 – 300,000. The study in question was authored by Jose Godoy, who concluded that the sword was a &quot;false relic&quot;. The Marqués de Falces voiced his disappointment to the Spanish press, stating &quot;I would dare to say that that man has never seen the sword in his life&quot;.
The sword was eventually sold in 2007/8, for a reported price of EUR 1.6 million, by the autonomous community of Castile and León and the Cabinet of Commerce and Industry of Burgos, and since then has been on display in the Museum of Burgos alongside other presumed relics of El Cid.
In 2011, a lawsuit was filed by the two daughters of Salustiano Fernández, demanding to be paid half of the purchase price, assuming that the sword after 1959 had been co-owned by Pedro, 15th Marqués de Falces, and his sister, Olga Velluti.
The lawsuit went on to the &quot;Tribunal Supremo&quot; (Supreme Court of Spain), which in 2016 finally ruled The 17th Marqués de Falces the sole owner of the sword. This judgement reversed two previous verdicts which declared the plaintiffs co-owners of the sword. The &quot;Tribunal Supremo&quot; decision was based on the uninterrupted ownership of the sword from 1987 by Olga Velluti, 16th Marquesa de Falces, following the death of her brother, The 15th Marqués de Falces, &quot;for more than the six-year period established by the Civil Code [of 1955]&quot;.

Jimmy Corrigan is a meek, lonely thirty-six-year-old man who meets his father for the first time in the fictional town of Waukosha, Michigan, over Thanksgiving weekend. Jimmy is an awkward and cheerless character with an overbearing mother and a very limited social life. After an ill-timed phone call, Jimmy agrees to meet his father without telling his mother. The experience is stressful for him as he can barely communicate with anyone other than his mother, let alone his estranged father. The two do very little together and Jimmy&#x27;s father, while well-intentioned, comes off to Jimmy as slightly racist and inconsiderate. A parallel story set in the Chicago World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893 shows Jimmy&#x27;s grandfather as a lonely little boy and his difficult relationship with an abusive father, Jimmy&#x27;s great-grandfather.

==Autobiographical content==

Elements of the novel appear to be autobiographical, particularly Jimmy&#x27;s relationship with his father. Ware met his father only once in adulthood – while he was working on this book – and has remarked that his father&#x27;s attempts at humor and casualness were not unlike those he&#x27;d already created for Jimmy&#x27;s father in the book. However, the author states it is not an account of his personal life.

==Storytelling techniques==

The novel uses numerous flashback scenes and parallel storylines. Many pages are devoid of text, and some contain complex iconic diagrams. Notable motifs in &quot;Jimmy Corrigan&quot; include a robot, a bird, a peach, a miniature horse, and a flawed superhero figure.

==Appearances in other Ware works==

In addition to the graphic novel, the character of Jimmy Corrigan has appeared in other Ware comic strips, sometimes as his imaginary child genius character, sometimes as an adult. Corrigan began as a child genius character in Ware&#x27;s early work, but as Ware continued, the child genius strips appeared less frequently, and increasingly followed Corrigan&#x27;s sad, adult existence.

==Recognition==
&quot;Jimmy Corrigan&quot; has been lauded by critics. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; cited it as &quot;the first formal masterpiece of (the) medium.&quot; It has received numerous awards, including:
* The Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Graphic Novel, 2001
* The American Book Award, 2001
* The Guardian First Book Award, 2001, &quot;the first time a graphic novel has won a major UK book award,&quot; according to &quot;the Guardian&quot;. 
* The Harvey Awards&#x27; &quot;Special Award for Excellence in Presentation&quot; and &quot;Best Graphic Album of Previously Published Work&quot;, 2001
* The Eisner Awards&#x27; &quot;Best Publication Design&quot; and &quot;Best Graphic Album: Reprint&quot;, 2001
* The Angoulême Festival&#x27;s &quot;Prize for Best Comic Book&quot; and &quot;Prix de la critique&quot;, 2003
* In 2005, &quot;Time&quot; chose it as one of the 10 best English language, graphic novels ever written.

==&quot;Family Guy&quot; similarities==
Several commentators, including Ware himself, have noted similarities between Seth MacFarlane&#x27;s Stewie Griffin character from the animated series &quot;Family Guy&quot; (which debuted after the strip) and Jimmy Corrigan. Ware has remarked, &quot;[The similarities are] a little too coincidental to be simply, well, coincidental.&quot; He further stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t want a book of seven years&#x27; worth of my stuff to become available and then be accused of being a rip-off of &quot;Family Guy&quot;.&quot; 20th Century Fox insists that Stewie is an entirely original character. In a 2003 interview, Seth MacFarlane claimed that he had never seen the comic strip before, describing the similarities as being &quot;pretty shocking&quot; and added that he &quot;understood how [Ware] would reach that conclusion.&quot;

<text>The Icelandic horse ( ), or Icelandic, is a breed of horse developed in Iceland. Although the horses are smaller (at times pony-sized) than other breeds, most registries for the Icelandic refer to it as a horse. The breed is long-lived and hardy, owing to the ruggedness of its home country. In their native Iceland they have few afflictions or diseases, thus national laws are in place preventing foreign-born horses from being imported into the country, while exported animals are not permitted to return. In addition to the gaits of walk, trot, and canter/gallop, typical of other horse breeds, many Icelandic horses can also do the tölt (ambling gait) and the flying pace. The only breed of horse in Iceland, the Icelandic is also popular internationally, and sizable populations exist in Europe and North America. The breed is still used for traditional sheepherding work in its native country, as well as for leisure, showing, and racing.

Developed from ponies brought to Iceland by Norse settlers in the 9th and 10th centuries, the breed is mentioned in various documents from throughout Icelandic history; an early reference to a named-horse appears in the 12th century. Horses were venerated in Germanic religion, a custom brought to Iceland by the country&#x27;s earliest settlers. Centuries of selective breeding have developed the Icelandic horse into its modern physical form, with natural selection having also played a role in overall hardiness and disease resistance; the harsh Icelandic climate likely eliminated many weaker horses early on due to exposure and malnourishment, with the strongest passing on their genes. In the 1780s, much of the breed was wiped out in the aftermath of a volcanic eruption at Laki. The first breed society for the Icelandic horse was created in Iceland in 1904, and the breed is represented by organizations in 22 different nations , organised under a parent association, the International Federation of Icelandic Horse Associations.

==Breed characteristics==
===Size===
Icelandic horses weigh between and stand an average of high, although the shortest measured Icelandic horse was 113cm (11.1hh), and the tallest measured 157cm (15.3hh). This is often considered pony size; however, breeders and breed registries always refer to Icelandics as horses. The official breeding goal gives room for substantial variations in size.

Several theories have been put forward as to why Icelandics are always called horses, among them the breed&#x27;s spirited temperament and large personality compared with smaller breeds. Another theory suggests that the breed&#x27;s weight, bone structure, rideability and weight-carrying abilities mean it can be classified as a horse, rather than a pony.
===Coat colours===
The breed comes in many coat colours, including chestnut, dun, bay, black, gray, palomino, pinto and roan, as well as bicolour/pied with large black/brown blotches over a white coat. There are over 100 names for various colors and color patterns in the Icelandic language. They have well-proportioned heads, with straight profiles and wide foreheads. The neck is short, muscular, and broad at the base; the withers broad and low. The chest is deep; the shoulders are muscular and slightly sloping and the back is long. The croup is broad, muscular, short and slightly sloping. The legs are strong and short, with relatively long cannon bones and short pasterns. The mane and tail are full, with coarse hair, and the tail is set low. The breed is known to be hardy and an easy keeper. The breed has a double coat developed for extra insulation in cold temperatures.
===Breeding characteristics===
Characteristics differ between various groups of Icelandic horses, depending on the focus of individual breeders. Many breed for temperament; some breed animals for pack and draft work, which are conformationally distinct from those bred for work under saddle, which are carefully selected for their ability to perform the traditional Icelandic gaits. Others are bred solely for horsemeat. Some breeders focus on favoured coat colours or patterns.

Icelandic horses are not usually ridden until they are four years old, and structural development is not complete until age seven. Their most productive years are between eight and eighteen, although they retain their strength and stamina into their twenties. An Icelandic mare that lived in Denmark reached a record age of 56, while another horse, living in Great Britain, reached the age of 42. The horses are highly fertile, and both sexes are fit for breeding up to age 25; mares have been recorded giving birth at age 27. The horses tend to not be easily spooked, probably the result of not having any natural predators in their native Iceland. Icelandics tend to be friendly, docile and easy to handle, while also being enthusiastic and self-assured. As a result of their isolation from other horses, diseases in the breed on the island of Iceland are virtually unknown, albeit with the exception of certain kinds of internal parasites. The low prevalence of disease in Iceland is attributed to strict Icelandic law preventing horses which have been exported out of the country from being returned, and by requiring that all equine equipment brought into the country be either brand-new and unused, and/or fully disinfected. Hence, Iceland-born horses have no acquired immunity to many diseases; an infection on the island would likely be devastating to the entire breed. This can create issues when showing native Icelandic horses against other foreign-born horses, as the same national laws for horses apply to all species of livestock animals; once an animal has left the country, they are not allowed to return.

===Gaits===

The Icelandic is a &quot;five-gaited&quot; breed, known for its sure-footedness and ability to cross rough terrain. As well as the typical gaits of walk, trot, and canter/gallop, the breed is noted for its ability to perform two additional gaits. Although most horse experts consider the canter and gallop to be separate gaits, on the basis of a small variation in the footfall pattern, Icelandic breed registries consider the canter and gallop one gait, hence the term &quot;five-gaited&quot;.

The first additional gait is a four-beat lateral ambling gait known as the &quot;tölt&quot;. This is known for its explosive acceleration and speed; it is also comfortable and ground-covering. There is considerable variation in style within the gait, and thus the tölt is variously compared to similar lateral gaits such as the rack of the Saddlebred, the largo of the Paso Fino, or the running walk of the Tennessee Walking Horse. Like all lateral ambling gaits, the footfall pattern is the same as the walk (left hind, left front, right hind, right front), but differs from the walk in that it can be performed at a range of speeds, from the speed of a typical fast walk up to the speed of a normal canter. Some Icelandic horses prefer to tölt, while others prefer to trot; correct training can improve weak gaits, but the tölt is a natural gait present from birth. There are two varieties of the tölt that are considered incorrect by breeders. The first is an uneven gait called a &quot;Pig&#x27;s Pace&quot; or &quot;Piggy-pace&quot; that is closer to a two-beat pace than a four-beat amble. The second is called a &quot;Valhopp&quot; and is a tölt and canter combination most often seen in untrained young horses or horses that mix their gaits. Both varieties are normally uncomfortable to ride.

The breed also performs a pace called a &quot;skeið&quot;, &quot;flugskeið&quot; or &quot;flying pace&quot;. It is used in pacing races, and is fast and smooth, with some horses able to reach up to . Not all Icelandic horses can perform this gait; animals that perform both the tölt and the flying pace in addition to the traditional gaits are considered the best of the breed. The flying pace is a two-beat lateral gait with a moment of suspension between footfalls; each side has both feet land almost simultaneously (left hind and left front, suspension, right hind and right front). It is meant to be performed by well-trained and balanced horses with skilled riders. It is not a gait used for long-distance travel. A slow pace is uncomfortable for the rider and is not encouraged when training the horse to perform the gait. Although most pacing horses are raced in harness using sulkies, in Iceland horses are raced while ridden.

==History==
The ancestors of the Icelandic horse were probably brought to Iceland by Viking Age Scandinavians between 860 and 935 AD. The Norse settlers were followed by immigrants from Norse colonies in Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Western Isles of Scotland. These later settlers arrived with the ancestors of what would elsewhere become Shetland, Highland, and Connemara ponies, which were crossed with the previously imported animals. There may also have been a connection with the Yakut pony, and the breed has physical similarities to the Nordlandshest of Norway. Other breeds with similar characteristics include the Faroe pony of the Faeroe Islands and the Norwegian Fjord horse. Genetic analyses have revealed links between the Mongolian horse and the Icelandic horse. Mongolian horses are believed to have been originally imported from Russia by Swedish traders; this imported Mongol stock subsequently contributed to the Fjord, Exmoor, Scottish Highland, Shetland and Connemara breeds, all of which have been found to be genetically linked to the Icelandic horse.

Attempts were made to introduce eastern blood into the Icelandic, resulting in a degeneration of the stock. In 982 AD the Icelandic Althing (parliament) passed laws prohibiting the importation of horses into Iceland, thus ending crossbreeding. The breed has now been bred pure in Iceland for more than 1,000 years.

The early Germanic peoples, including those living in Scandinavia, venerated horses and slaughtered and ate them at blóts throughout the Viking Age. When these settlers arrived in Iceland, they brought their beliefs, and their horses, with them. Horses play a significant part in Nordic mythology with many, including Odin&#x27;s eight-footed pacer named Sleipnir, allowing gods and other beings to travel between realms and across the sky. Skalm, a mare who is the first Icelandic horse known by name, appeared in the &quot;Book of Settlements&quot; from the 12th century. According to the book, a chieftain named Seal-Thorir founded a settlement at the place where Skalm stopped and lay down with her pack. Horses also play key roles in the Icelandic sagas &quot;Hrafnkel&#x27;s Saga&quot;, &quot;Njal&#x27;s Saga&quot; and &quot;Grettir&#x27;s Saga&quot;. Although written in the 13th century, these three sagas are set as far back as the 9th century. This early literature has influenced many riding clubs and horse herds in modern Iceland, still bearing the names of horses from Norse mythology.

Horses were often considered the most prized possession of a medieval Icelander. Indispensable to warriors, war horses were sometimes buried alongside their fallen riders, and stories were told of their deeds. Icelanders also arranged for bloody fights between stallions; these were used for entertainment and to pick the best animals for breeding, and they were described in both literature and official records from the Commonwealth period of 930 to 1262 AD. Stallion fights were an important part of Icelandic culture, and brawls, both physical and verbal, among the spectators were common. The conflicts at the horse fights gave rivals a chance to improve their political and social standing at the expense of their enemies and had wide social and political repercussions, sometimes leading to the restructuring of political alliances. However, not all human fights were serious, and the events provided a stage for friends and even enemies to battle without the possibility of major consequences. Courting between young men and women was also common at horse fights.

Natural selection played a major role in the development of the breed, as large numbers of horses died from lack of food and exposure to the elements. Between 874 and 1300 AD, during the more favorable climatic conditions of the medieval warm period, Icelandic breeders selectively bred horses according to special rules of color and conformation. From 1300 to 1900, selective breeding became less of a priority; the climate was often severe and many horses and people died. Between 1783 and 1784, around 70% of the horses in Iceland were killed by volcanic ash poisoning and starvation after the 1783 eruption of Lakagígar. The eruption lasted eight months, covered hundreds of square miles of land with lava, and rerouted or dried up several rivers. The population slowly recovered during the next hundred years, and from the beginning of the 20th century selective breeding again became important. The first Icelandic breed societies were established in 1904, and the first breed registry in Iceland was established in 1923.

Icelandics were exported to Great Britain before the 20th century to work as pit ponies in the coal mines, because of their strength and small size. However, those horses were never registered and little evidence of their existence remains. The first formal exports of Icelandic horses were to Germany in the 1940s. Great Britain&#x27;s first official imports were in 1956, when a Scottish farmer, Stuart McKintosh, began a breeding program. Other breeders in Great Britain followed McKintosh&#x27;s lead, and the Icelandic Horse Society of Great Britain was formed in 1986. The number of Icelandic horses exported to other nations has steadily increased since the first exports of the mid-19th century. Since 1969, multiple societies have worked together to preserve, improve and market these horses under the auspices of the International Federation of Icelandic Horse Associations. The Icelandic remains a breed known for its purity of bloodline, and is the only horse breed present in Iceland.

The Icelandic is especially popular in western Europe, Scandinavia, and North America. There are about 80,000 Icelandic horses in Iceland (compared to a human population of 317,000), and around 100,000 abroad. Almost 50,000 are in Germany, which has many active riding clubs and breed societies.

==Uses==
Icelandic horses still play a large part in Icelandic life, despite increasing mechanization and road improvements that diminish the necessity for the breed&#x27;s use. The first official Icelandic horse race was held at Akureyri in 1874, and many races are held throughout the country from April through June. Both gallop and pace races are held, as well as performance classes showcasing the breed&#x27;s unique gaits. Winter events are often held, including races on frozen bodies of water. In 2009 such an event resulted in both horses and riders falling into the water and needing to be rescued. The first shows, focused on the quality of animals as breeding stock, were held in 1906. The Agricultural Society of Iceland, along with the National Association of Riding Clubs, organizes regular shows with a wide variety of classes. Some horses are bred for slaughter, and much of the meat is exported to Japan. Farmers still use the breed to round up sheep in the Icelandic highlands, and tourism is a growing industry, but most horses are used for competition and leisure riding.

==Registration==
The Icelandic horse is represented by associations in 22 countries, with the International Federation of Icelandic Horse Associations (FEIF) serving as a governing international parent organization. The FEIF was founded on 25 May 1969, with six countries as original members: Austria, Denmark, Germany, Iceland, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. France and Norway joined in 1971, and Belgium and Sweden in 1975. Later, Finland, Canada, Great Britain, the United States, Faroe Islands, Luxembourg, Italy, Slovenia, Liechtenstein, Hungary, Australia and Ireland became members, but Ireland subsequently left because of a lack of members. New Zealand has been given the status of &quot;associate member&quot; as its membership base is small. In 2000, WorldFengur was established as the official FEIF registry for Icelandic horses. The registry is a web database program that is used as a studbook to track the history and bloodlines of the Icelandic breed. The registry contains information on the pedigree, breeder, owner, offspring, photo, breeding evaluations and assessments, and unique identification of each horse registered. The database was established by the Icelandic government in cooperation with the FEIF. Since its inception, around 300,000 Icelandic horses, living and dead, have been registered worldwide. The Islandpferde-Reiter- und Züchterverband is an organization of German riders and breeders of Icelandic horses and the association of all Icelandic horse clubs in Germany.

<doc id="567442" wikidata="Q838959" url="?curid=567442" title="Erect-crested penguin">
<text>The erect-crested penguin (Eudyptes sclateri; ) is a penguin endemic to the New Zealand region and only breeds on the Bounty and Antipodes Islands. It has black upper parts, white underparts and a yellow eye stripe and crest. It spends the winter at sea and little is known about its biology and breeding habits. Populations are believed to have declined during the last few decades of the twentieth century, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it as being &quot;endangered&quot;.

==Description==

This is a small-to-medium-sized, yellow-crested, black-and-white penguin, at and weighing . The male is slightly larger than the female and as in most crested penguins has a larger bill. It has bluish-black to jet black upper parts and white underparts, and a broad, bright yellow eyebrow-stripe which extends over the eye to form a short, erect crest. With a mean body mass in males of (sample size 22) and females of (sample size 22), the erect-crested penguin is the largest of the crested penguin species and as the fourth heaviest extant penguin, being nearly as heavy on average as the gentoo penguin.

Its biology is poorly studied and only little information about the species has emerged in the past decades. The only recent study conducted on the Antipodes Islands focused on aspects of the mate choice. Research on the species is hampered by logistics and restrictive permitting by the New Zealand Department of Conservation.

It presumably feeds on small fish, krill and squid like other crested penguin species.

The binomial commemorates the British zoologist Philip Lutley Sclater.

==Distribution==

Erect-crested penguins breed on the Bounty and Antipodes Islands. Previous records of small breeding populations have also been reported from Campbell Island and the Auckland Islands; in the 1940s a breeding pair was documented on the Otago Peninsula on the New Zealand mainland. The species spends extended times at sea during the pre-moult period (February–March) as well as over the winter months (March–August). Individuals have been found as far away as the Falkland Islands and it is also a vagrant to Argentina, Antarctica and Australia.

Erect-crested penguins nest in large colonies on rocky terrain. On the Antipodes Islands, the penguins breed in mono-specific colonies or sometimes sympatrically with Southern Rockhopper penguins. On the Bounty Islands, Erect-crested penguins breed in large mixed colonies with Salvin&#x27;s albatross. Erect-crested penguins breed in two-egg clutches from the months between September and late January. The first egg to be laid is typically 25% to 70% smaller than the second egg. The extreme difference in egg sizes has demonstrated asynchronous incubation habits, with the larger egg being granted more accommodation and priority than the smaller egg.

== Status ==
Populations of this species are believed to have declined drastically since the 1940s. Population estimates from the late 1970s put the total numbers of erect-crested penguins breeding on the Bounty and Antipodes Islands at 230,000 breeding pairs although the accuracy of these figures have recently been questioned. Nevertheless, there is ample evidence for substantial population declines in the second half of the 20th century although these declines seem to have slowed in recent decades. The current population is estimated at 150,000 mature individuals and is being listed as an endangered species on the IUCN Red List; the erect-crested penguin is listed as endangered and granted protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.

<text>Charles Gerard, 2nd Earl of Macclesfield ( 1659 – 5 November 1701), was an English peer, soldier and MP.

==Biography==
He was born in France, the eldest son of Charles Gerard, Baron Brandon (later 1st Earl of Macclesfield), and Jeanne, the daughter of Pierre de Civelle, equerry to Queen Henrietta Maria. He became an English national by Act of Parliament in 1677.

By 1678 he was a lieutenant-colonel in Lord Gerard&#x27;s Horse and a full colonel in 1679. That year he entered politics, being elected knight of the shire for Lancashire in both March and October, and again in 1681.

Like his father Charles, the 1st Earl, he was involved in the intrigues of the Duke of Monmouth. In 1685 he was sentenced to death for being a party to the Rye House Plot, but was pardoned by Charles II. In 1689 he was re-elected Member of Parliament for Lancashire, which he represented until 1694, when he succeeded to his father&#x27;s peerage. He was Custos Rotulorum for Lancashire from 1689 until his death in 1701. As Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire he was also Colonel of the Denbighshire Militia in 1697.

Having become a major-general in 1694, Macclesfield saw some service abroad, and in 1701 he was selected the first commissioner for the investiture of the elector of Hanover (afterwards King George I) with the order of the Garter, on which occasion he also was charged to present a copy of the Act of Settlement to the dowager electress Sophia.

He died suddenly on 5 November 1701 at about 40 years old, leaving no legitimate children.

==Family==
In March 1698, Macclesfield was divorced from his wife Anna, daughter of Sir Richard Mason of Sutton, by Act of Parliament; the first occasion on which a divorce was so granted without a previous decree of an ecclesiastical court. The countess was the mother of two children who were known by the name of Savage, and whose reputed father was Richard Savage, 4th Earl Rivers. The poet Richard Savage claimed that he was the younger of these children. The divorced countess married Colonel Henry Brett about the year 1700, and died at the age of eighty-five in 1753. Her daughter, Anna Margaretta Brett, was a mistress of George I. The 2nd earl of Macclesfield was succeeded by his brother Fitton Gerard, 3rd Earl (c. 1665–1702), on whose death without heirs the title became extinct in December 1702.

On his death, Macclesfield left most of his estate to Charles Mohun, 4th Baron Mohun. In 1691 Mohun married Charlotte Orby, a granddaughter of Charles, 1st Earl of Macclesfield. Although they were soon separated, in 1694 Mohun accompanied Macclesfield on the Brest expedition. James Douglas, 4th Duke of Hamilton also had a claim on the estate through his second wife Elizabeth Gerard, who was also a granddaughter of the 1st Earl. It seems that Macclesfield preferred Mohun, a former captain of horse in his regiment, over Hamilton whom he disliked because of his Tory sympathies. Hamilton challenged Mohun through the courts. After over a decade of legal dispute, the pair fought their famous duel in Hyde Park, which resulted in the deaths of both men.

<text>Jakob Steiner (18 March 1796 – 1 April 1863) was a Swiss mathematician who worked primarily in geometry.

== Life ==
Steiner was born in the village of Utzenstorf, Canton of Bern. At 18, he became a pupil of Heinrich Pestalozzi and afterwards studied at Heidelberg. Then, he went to Berlin, earning a livelihood there, as in Heidelberg, by tutoring. Here he became acquainted with A. L. Crelle, who, encouraged by his ability and by that of Niels Henrik Abel, then also staying at Berlin, founded his famous &quot;Journal&quot; (1826).

After Steiner&#x27;s publication (1832) of his &quot;Systematische Entwickelungen&quot; he received, through Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, who was then professor at Königsberg University, and earned an honorary degree there; and through the influence of Jacobi and of the brothers Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt a new chair of geometry was founded for him at Berlin (1834). This he occupied until his death in Bern on 1 April 1863.

He was described by Thomas Hirst as follows:
: &quot;He is a middle-aged man, of pretty stout proportions, has a long intellectual face, with beard and moustache and a fine prominent forehead, hair dark rather inclining to turn grey. The first thing that strikes you on his face is a dash of care and anxiety, almost pain, as if arising from physical suffering—he has rheumatism. He never prepares his lectures beforehand. He thus often stumbles or fails to prove what he wishes at the moment, and at every such failure he is sure to make some characteristic remark.&quot;

== Mathematical contributions ==
Steiner&#x27;s mathematical work was mainly confined to geometry. This he treated synthetically, to the total exclusion of analysis, which he hated, and he is said to have considered it a disgrace to synthetic geometry if equal or higher results were obtained by analytical geometry methods. In his own field he surpassed all his contemporaries. His investigations are distinguished by their great generality, by the fertility of his resources, and by the rigour in his proofs. He has been considered the greatest pure geometer since Apollonius of Perga.

In his &quot;Systematische Entwickelung der Abhängigkeit geometrischer Gestalten von einander&quot; he laid the foundation of modern synthetic geometry. In projective geometry even parallel lines have a point in common: a point at infinity. Thus two points determine a line and two lines determine a point. The symmetry of point and line is expressed as projective duality. Starting with perspectivities, the transformations of projective geometry are formed by composition, producing &quot;projectivities&quot;. Steiner identified sets preserved by projectivities such as a projective range and pencils. He is particularly remembered for his approach to a conic section by way of projectivity called the Steiner conic.

In a second little volume, &quot;Die geometrischen Constructionen ausgeführt mittels der geraden Linie und eines festen Kreises&quot; (1833), republished in 1895 by Ottingen, he shows, what had been already suggested by J. V. Poncelet, how all problems of the second order can be solved by aid of the straight edge alone without the use of compasses, as soon as one circle is given on the drawing-paper. He also wrote &quot;Vorlesungen über synthetische Geometrie&quot;, published posthumously at Leipzig by C. F. Geiser and H. Schroeter in 1867; a third edition by R. Sturm was published in 1887–1898.

Other geometric results by Steiner include development of a formula for the partitioning of space by planes (the maximal number of parts created by n planes), several theorems about the famous Steiner&#x27;s chain of tangential circles, and a proof of the isoperimetric theorem (later a flaw was found in the proof, but was corrected by Weierstrass).

The rest of Steiner&#x27;s writings are found in numerous papers mostly published in &quot;Crelle&#x27;s Journal&quot;, the first volume of which contains his first four papers. The most important are those relating to algebraic curves and surfaces, especially the short paper &quot;Allgemeine Eigenschaften algebraischer Curven&quot;. This contains only results, and there is no indication of the method by which they were obtained, so that, according to O. Hesse, they are, like Fermat&#x27;s theorems, riddles to the present and future generations. Eminent analysts succeeded in proving some of the theorems, but it was reserved to Luigi Cremona to prove them all, and that by a uniform synthetic method, in his book on algebraic curves.

Other important investigations relate to maxima and minima. Starting from simple elementary propositions, Steiner advances to the solution of problems which analytically require the calculus of variations, but which at the time altogether surpassed the powers of that calculus. Connected with this is the paper &quot;Vom Krümmungsschwerpuncte ebener Curven&quot;, which contains numerous properties of pedals and roulettes, especially of their areas.

Steiner also made a small but important contribution to combinatorics. In 1853, Steiner published a two-page article in &quot;Crelle&#x27;s Journal&quot; on what nowadays is called Steiner systems, a basic kind of block design.

His oldest papers and manuscripts (1823–1826) were published by his admirer Fritz Bützberger on the request of the Bernese Society for Natural Scientists.

<text>Charles Gerard, 1st Earl of Macclesfield, PC (c. 16187 January 1694) was an English aristocrat, soldier and courtier.

==Early life==
The eldest son of Sir Charles Gerard, he was a member of an old Lancashire family, his great-grandfather having been Sir Gilbert Gerard (died 1593) of Ince, in that county, one of the most distinguished judges in the reign of Elizabeth I. His mother was Penelope Fitton, sister and co-heiress of Sir Edward Fitton, of Gawsworth, Cheshire.

Nothing is known about Gerard&#x27;s education until he entered Leyden University on 23 March 1633. He was also educated in France under John Goffe of Magdalen College, Oxford, brother of Stephen Goffe. Dugdale states that he was &quot;trained in the discipline of war from his youth in the United Provinces&quot;, and that on the outbreak of the First English Civil War he joined the King at Shrewsbury, and raised a troop of horse at his own charge.

==Early Civil War battles and sieges==
At the Battle of Edgehill, Gerard commanded a brigade of Royalist foot guards, the steadiness of which largely contributed to averting absolute defeat. In this battle, as also in the operations before Lichfield in April 1643, he was wounded. He was present at the siege of Bristol (July 1643), and arranged the very rigorous terms of the capitulation. He fought with distinction in the First Battle of Newbury (20 September 1643), and took part in the relief of Newark (March 1644), when he was again wounded, thrown from his horse, and taken prisoner, but released on parole shortly before the besiegers capitulated.

==Welsh campaigns==
Shortly afterwards Gerard was appointed in succession to the Earl of Carbery in the general command in South Wales, then strongly held by Parliamentary forces, and by 19 May 1644 had succeeded in collecting a force of two thousand five hundred horse and foot with which to begin operations. He marched by Chepstow to Cardiff, which surrendered to him, and took Kidwelly. By 12 June he had already penetrated into Carmarthenshire, and before the 18th he was in possession of Carmarthen. He rapidly reduced Cardigan, Newcastle Emlyn, Laugharne, and Roch castles, and seems to have experienced no check until he was already threatening Pembroke about the middle of July, when the garrison of that place by a sortie routed a portion of his force and obtained supplies. On 22 August he took Haverfordwest, and before the end of the month had invested Pembroke and was threatening Tenby. His forces are said to have been largely composed of Irish levies, of whose barbarous atrocities loud complaint is made in the &quot;Kingdom&#x27;s Intelligencer&quot; (15–23 October 1644).

In September Gerard received orders to join Prince Rupert at Bristol, and in October he began his retreat, marching by Usk and Abergavenny, and thus evading General Edward Massey he reached Bristol towards the end of the month. November he spent in Oxford or the neighbourhood, whence in December he transferred his headquarters to Worcester, where he remained until 11 March 1645, when he marched to Cheshire to co-operate with Rupert, Maurice, and Sir Marmaduke Langdale against General Sir William Brereton. Their combined forces succeeded in relieving Beeston Castle on 17 March.

Gerard was then ordered back to South Wales, where the Parliamentary General Rowland Laugharne had gained some successes. He marched through Wales from Chester in a south-westerly direction, carrying all before him and ravaging the country as he went. After a brush with Sir John Price at Llanidloes, he fell in with Laugharne before Newcastle Emlyn on 16 May, and completely defeated him. Haverfordwest and Cardigan Castle, which had been recovered by the Roundheads, were evacuated on his approach. Picton Castle offered a stout resistance, but was carried by assault. Carew Castle also fell into his hands. Pembroke and Tenby, closely invested, alone held out.

==With King Charles after Naseby==
The ascendency of the royalists being thus re-established in South Wales, Gerard received orders to move eastward again, and was marching on Hereford at the head of five thousand horse and foot when the Battle of Naseby was fought (14 June 1645). After the battle, King Charles and Rupert, with the fragments of their army, fell back upon Hereford in the hope of effecting a junction with Gerard, who, however, seems to have been unexpectedly delayed; and Rupert, pushing on to Bristol, sent orders that part of Gerard&#x27;s forces should join him there, while the King required a portion of the cavalry to attend his person. From Hereford Charles retreated to Abergavenny and thence to Cardiff, with the hope of raising a fresh army in Wales, but found the Welsh much disaffected, owing (according to Clarendon) to the irritation engendered by the extraordinary rigour with which Gerard had treated them; so that when news came that Hereford had been invested by the Scottish army and must fall unless relieved within a month, Charles could only induce the Welsh to move by superseding Gerard, promising at the same time to make him a baron. Gerard chose the territorial designation of Brandon, for no better reason, asserts Clarendon, than &quot;that there was once an eminent person called Charles Brandon who was afterwards made a duke&quot;.

Gerard had become Lieutenant-General of all the King&#x27;s Horse, and assumed the command of his bodyguard. On the night of 4 August 1645, he escorted Charles from Cardiff to Brecknock, and thence to Ludlow, and throughout his progress to Oxford (28 August). Thence they returned to Hereford (4 September), the Scots raising the siege on their approach. At Hereford, on 14 September Charles heard of the fall of Bristol, and determined if possible to join Montrose in the north. Escorted by Gerard, he made for Chester, and succeeded in entering the city, having first detached Gerard to the assistance of Sir Marmaduke Langdale, who was endeavouring to muster the royalists in force outside the city, with the view of raising the siege. After much apparently purposeless marching and counter-marching, the royalists risked an engagement with the besiegers on Rowton Heath (23 September 1645), but were totally defeated by General Sydnam Poyntz. Gerard was carried from the field desperately wounded. The King then evacuated Chester and retired to Newark, where he arrived with Gerard on 4 October, and fixed his headquarters for the winter. Gerard was dismissed from the King&#x27;s service before the end of the month for taking part with Rupert and some other Cavaliers in a disorderly protest against the supersession of Sir Richard Willis, the governor of the place.

==With Prince Rupert and exile==
Gerard now attached himself closely to Rupert&#x27;s party, which consisted of about four hundred officers. They established themselves at Worton House, some fourteen miles from Newark-on-Trent, and made overtures to Parliament with the view of obtaining passes out of the country. Parliament, however, required that they should take an oath never again to bear arms against it. The Cavaliers, therefore, temporised, being really anxious for a reconciliation with the King on honourable terms. They were ordered to the neighbourhood of Worcester by Parliament, and there remained during the winter, but early in the following year (1646) returned to their allegiance and the King at Oxford. There Gerard raised another troop of horse, with which he scoured the adjoining country, penetrating on one occasion as far as the neighbourhood of Derby, where he was routed in a skirmish. At one time he seems to have been in command of Wallingford Castle, but when the lines of investment began to be drawn more closely round Oxford he withdrew within the city walls, where he seems to have remained until the surrender of the city on 24 June 1646). He probably left England with Rupert, as he was at the Hague on 27 December 1646.

==Early exile==
Form late 1646 until the Restoration Gerard&#x27;s movements are very hard to trace. He was at St. Germain-en-Laye in September 1647 with Rupert, Digby, and other Cavaliers. He was appointed vice-admiral of the fleet in November 1648, and on 8 December passed through Rotterdam on his way to Helvoetsluys to enter his new duties. In April 1649 he was at the Hague as Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the King Charles II. He apparently belonged to the &quot;queen&#x27;s faction&quot;, which was understood to favour the policy of coming to an understanding with the commissioners from the Scottish Parliament, who were then at the Hague, but were denied an audience by Charles. In October of the same year he was with Charles in Jersey when the celebrated declaration addressed to the English people was published, and he was a member, and probably an influential member, of the council which advised the King to treat with the Scottish Parliament as a &quot;committee of estates&quot;. He returned with the King to the Hague, where this policy was put in execution.

On 18 March 1650 Hyde wrote from Madrid to Secretary Nicholas praising Gerard somewhat faintly as a &quot;gallant young man&quot; who &quot;always wants a friend by him&quot;; to which Nicholas replied on 4 May that Gerard is &quot;the gallantest, honestest person now about the King, and the most constant to honourable principles&quot;. In the following November (1650) Nicholas writes to Gerard that he has the commission appointing him general of Kent, but that the fact must be kept secret &quot;because the King in his late declaration promised the Scots to grant none.&quot; In March 1650–1 Gerard left the Hague for Breda in attendance on the Duke of York, who was anxious to avoid certain &quot;things called ambassadors,&quot; as Nicholas scornfully terms the Scottish envoys. In the following November, he was in Paris, where he seems to have remained for at least a year.

On 13 May 1652, Gerard was appointed to the command of the corps of lifeguards then being raised. In 1653 he went to Utrecht, where Dr. Robert Creighton &quot;wrought a miracle&quot; upon him. He remained there through part of 1654, was present at the siege of Arras, serving under Marshal Turenne as a volunteer in August of that year, and then returned to Paris, where he divided his energies between quarrelling with Hyde, intriguing on behalf of Queen Henrietta Maria, and instigating his cousin, John Gerard, to assassinate the Protector. The plot (Gerard&#x27;s conspiracy), to which the King appears to have been privy (Gerard had presented his cousin to the King early in 1654), was discovered, and John Gerard was beheaded on Tower Hill.
==Exile and return==
A letter from one F. Coniers to the King, dated London, 11 January 1655, accuses Gerard of having treated with Thurloe for the poisoning of Cromwell. This the writer professes to have discovered by glancing over some papers incautiously exposed in Thurloe&#x27;s chambers. &quot;The story is obviously a mere invention&quot; . In July 1655 Gerard was at Cologne, closely watched by Thurloe&#x27;s spies. As Hyde wrote to Nicholas from Paris, 24 April 1654, Gerard was never without projects. From Cologne he went to Antwerp &quot;to attempt the new modelling of the plot&quot;, returning to Paris in September. There he appears to have resided until May 1656, busily employed in collecting intelligence. In this work he seems to have been much aided by the postal authorities, who, according to one of Thurloe&#x27;s correspondents, allowed him to intercept whatever letters he pleased. In July he was at Cologne awaiting instructions. In February 1657 he was at the Hague, corresponding under the name of Thomas Enwood with one Dermot, a merchant at the sign of the Drum, Drury Lane. The only fragment of this correspondence which remains is unintelligible, being couched in mercantile phraseology, which gives no clue to its real meaning.

From the Hague, Gerard went to Brussels, where in April he received instructions to raise a troop of horse guards at once and a promise of an allowance of four hundred guilders a day for his family. From Brussels, he returned to Paris in March 1658. He was almost immediately despatched to Amsterdam, apparently for the purpose of chartering ships, and he spent the rest of that year and the first six months of the next partly in the Low Countries and partly at Boulogne, returning to Paris between August and September 1659. There he appears to have spent the latter part of the year, joining Secretary Nicholas at Brussels in the following January.

From Brussels, in the spring of 1660 Gerard went to Breda (where the King held his court), and in May returned with the King to England. On 17 May 1660, he was commissioned Captain in the Life Guards. He rode at their head in the King&#x27;s progress to Whitehall on 29 May 1660.

==Restoration==
On 29 July 1660, Gerard received a grant in reversion of the office of Remembrancer of the Tenths and First-Fruits. On 13 September his estates, which had been forfeited by Parliament, were restored to him.

On 15 May 1661, Gerard petitioned for the post of ranger of Enfield Chase, which he obtained. His title, however, was disputed by the late ranger, James Cecil, Earl of Salisbury, and he was soon involved in litigation with Captains Thomas and Henry Batt, keepers of Potter&#x27;s Walk and bailiffs of the Chase, whose patents he refused to recognise. Both matters were referred to the lord chancellor for decision. As against the Batts, Gerard succeeded on the technical ground that their patent was under the great seal, whereas by statute it should have been under that of the duchy of Lancaster. It does not appear how the question with the Earl of Salisbury was settled.

In 1662 Gerard was granted a pension charged on the customs. Towards the end of the year, he was sent as envoy extraordinary to the French court, where he was very splendidly received. About this time he became a member of the Royal African Company, which obtained in January 1663 a grant by letters patent of the region between Port Sallee and the Cape of Good Hope for the term of one thousand years. Litigation in which he was this year engaged with his cousin, Alexander Fitton, afterwards Lord Chancellor of Ireland, was watched with much interest by his enemies. The dispute was about the title to the Gawsworth estate in Cheshire, of which Fitton was in possession, but which Gerard claimed. The title depended on the authenticity of a certain deed which Gerard alleged to be a forgery, producing the notorious forger Alexander Granger, who swore that he himself had forged it. Gerard obtained a verdict at the Chester assizes and ejected Fitton. Fitton, however, published a pamphlet in which he charged Gerard with having procured Granger&#x27;s evidence by intimidation. Gerard moved the House of Lords on the subject, and the pamphlet was suppressed. Fitton was imprisoned for &quot;scandalum magnatum&quot;, the offence of libelling a peer: he remained in prison for almost 20 years.

In March 1665 Gerard was granted a pension of £1,000 per annum to retire from the post of captain of the guard, which Charles desired to confer on the Duke of Monmouth. His retirement, however, did not take place until 1668, when Pepys says that he received £12,000 for it. Pepys also states that it was his practice to conceal the deaths of the troopers that he might draw their pay; and one of his clerks named Carr drew up a petition to the House of Lords charging him with peculation to the extent of £2,000 per annum. The petition found its way into print before presentation, and was treated by the house as a breach of privilege, voted a &quot;scandalous paper&quot;, and ordered to be burned by the common hangman. Carr was sentenced to pay a fine of £1,000, to stand in the pillory for three hours on each of three different days, and to be imprisoned in the Fleet during the king&#x27;s pleasure. Gerard subsequently indicted him as a deserter from the army.
==Post Restoration==
On 5 January 1667, Gerard had been appointed to the general command of the Hampshire and Isle of Wight militia, with special instructions to provide for the security of the Isle of Wight and Portsmouth in view of the threatening attitude of the Dutch. In this capacity, he was busily engaged during the spring and summer of 1667 in strengthening the fortifications of Portsmouth. He continued to hold the post of Gentleman of the Bedchamber, with a pension of £1,000 attached to it, during the reign of Charles II.

On 23 July 1679, he was created Earl of Macclesfield. On the occasion of the Duke of Monmouth&#x27;s unauthorised return from abroad in November 1679, Gerard was sent by Charles to him &quot;to tell him out of his great tenderness he gave him till night to be gone&quot;. The messenger was ill-chosen, Gerard being himself one of the band of conspirators of which Monmouth was the tool. His name appears in the &quot;Journal of the House of Lords&quot;, with that of the Earl of Shaftesbury, as one of the protesters against the rejection of the Exclusion Bill on 15 November 1680. Lord Grey de Werke in his &quot;Confession&quot; (p. 61) asserts that Gerard suggested to Monmouth the expediency of murdering the Duke of York by way of terrorising Charles. In August 1681 Gerard was dismissed from the post of Gentleman of the Bedchamber. On 5 September 1682, he entertained the Duke of Monmouth at his seat in Cheshire.

In 1684 the question of the Gawsworth title was revived (partly no doubt as a political move) by an application on the part of Fitton to the lord keeper, Francis, Lord Guilford, to review the case. Roger North, the 17th-century biographer, who being Guildford&#x27;s brother was well placed to know the facts, wrote that as Fitton was then in favour at court, while Macclesfield (Gerard) was &quot;stiff of the anti-court party&quot;, it was generally anticipated that the lord keeper would, independently of the merits of the case, decide in favour of Fitton. In fact, however, he refused the application on the ground that the claim was stale, a &quot;pitch of heroical justice&quot; which North cannot adequately extol, and which so impressed Macclesfield that he expended a shilling in the purchase of the lord keeper&#x27;s portrait.

The grand jury of Cheshire having presented Macclesfield on 17 September as disaffected to the government and recommended that he should be bound over to keep the peace, Macclesfield retaliated by an action of &quot;scandalum magnatum&quot; against a juryman named Starkey, laying the damages at £10,000. The case was tried in the exchequer chamber on 25 November 1684, and resulted in judgement for the defendant. On 7 September 1685, a royal proclamation was issued for Macclesfield&#x27;s apprehension. He fled to the continent, and sentence of outlawry was passed against him.

==William III==
Macclesfield spent the next three years in Germany and the Netherlands, returning to England in the revolution of 1688. During the progress of the Prince of Orange from Torbay to London, Gerard commanded his body-guard, a troop of some two hundred cavaliers, mostly English, mounted on Flemish chargers, whose splendid appearance excited much admiration. In February 1689 he was sworn of the Privy Council, and appointed lord president of the council of the Welsh Marches, and lord-lieutenant of Gloucester, Hereford, Monmouth, and North and South Wales. His outlawry was formally reversed in the following April. His political attitude is curiously illustrated by his speech in the debate on the Abjuration Bill. Lord Wharton, after owning that he had taken more oaths than he could remember, said that he should be &quot;very unwilling to charge himself with more at the end of his days&quot;, whereupon Macclesfield rose and said that &quot;he was in much the same case with Lord Wharton, though they had not always taken the same oaths; but he never knew them of any use but to make people declare against government that would have submitted quietly to it if they had been let alone&quot;. He also disclaimed having had much hand in bringing about the revolution.

In July 1690 he was one of a commission appointed to inquire into the conduct of the fleet during a recent engagement with the French off Beachy Head, which had not terminated so successfully as had been anticipated. He died on 7 January 1694 suddenly in a fit of vomiting, and was buried on the 18th in Exeter vault in Westminster Abbey. The title and his estates passed to his son and heir Charles.

== Character ==
Samuel Pepys denounced Gerard as a &quot;proud and violent man&quot; whose &quot;rogueries and cheats&quot; were notorious. Elrington Ball, in his study of his cousin and enemy Alexander Fitton, while accepting that Fitton was not a suitable character to be Lord Chancellor of Ireland, remarked that however bad Fitton&#x27;s character it cannot have been as bad as Gerard&#x27;s.

==Family==
Macclesfield married Jane, daughter of Pierre de Civelle, a Frenchman resident in England. Little is known of her except that in 1663 she was dismissed by Charles II from attendance on the queen for tattling to her about Lady Castlemaine, and that on one occasion while being carried in her chair through the city she was mistaken for the Duchess of Portsmouth, saluted as the French whore, and mobbed by the populace. They had two sons and three daughters:
*Charles ( 1659–1701), who succeeded to the title
*Fitton (1663–1702), who succeeded to the title on the death of his brother
*Elizabeth, who married Digby Gerard, 5th Baron Gerard of Bromley, and was buried in Westminster Abbey
*Charlotte
*Anne

<text>This is a list of active ships currently in service with the Royal Netherlands Navy.

==Royal Netherlands Navy ship prefix==
In Dutch, ships are given the prefix &quot;Zijner Majesteits&quot; (&quot;his majesty&#x27;s&quot;, abbreviated &quot;Zr.Ms.&quot;) or &quot;Hare Majesteits&quot; (&quot;her majesty&#x27;s&quot;, abbreviated as &quot;Hr.Ms.&quot;). In English, the Dutch prefix is translated as &quot;HNLMS&quot; for &quot;His/Her Netherlands Majesty&#x27;s Ship&quot;. Some authors translate Hr./Zr.Ms. as &quot;HNMS&quot; but that abbreviation is ambiguous: the &quot;N&quot; might stand for &quot;Netherlands&quot; or &quot;Norway&quot;. The most common way to avoid this ambiguity is to use &quot;HNLMS&quot; and &quot;HNoMS&quot; respectively.

<text>The United States Border Patrol (USBP) is a federal law enforcement agency under the United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and is responsible for securing the borders of the United States. According to its website as of 2022, its mission is to &quot;Protect the American people, safeguard our borders, and enhance the nation’s economic prosperity.&quot;

With 19,648 agents in 2019, the Border Patrol is one of the largest law enforcement agencies in the United States. For fiscal year 2017, Congress enacted a budget of $3,805,253,000 for the Border Patrol.

==History==
In the nineteenth century, United States borders were open and unrestricted; there was no systematic control or even recordkeeping of immigrants. The first legislation restricting immigration, after the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves of 1807, was the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.

Mounted watchmen of the United States Department of Commerce and Labor patrolled the border in an effort to prevent illegal crossings as early as 1904, but their efforts were irregular and undertaken only when resources permitted. The inspectors, usually called &quot;mounted guards&quot;, operated out of El Paso, Texas. Though they never totaled more than 75, they patrolled as far west as California trying to restrict the flow of illegal Chinese immigration.

In March 1915, Congress authorized a separate group of mounted guards, often referred to as &quot;mounted inspectors&quot;. Most rode on horseback, but a few operated automobiles, motorcycles, and boats. Although these inspectors had broader arrest authority, they still largely pursued Chinese aliens trying to avoid the National Origins Act and Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. These patrolmen were immigration inspectors, assigned to inspection stations, and could not watch the border at all times. U.S. Army soldiers along the southwest border performed intermittent border patrolling, but this was secondary to &quot;the more serious work of military training&quot;. Aliens encountered illegally in the U.S. by the Army were directed to the immigration inspection stations. Texas Rangers were also sporadically assigned to patrol duties by the state, and their efforts were noted as &quot;singularly effective&quot;.

The National Origins Act authorized the formation of the U.S. Border Patrol on May 26, 1924. Two days later, the &quot;Labor Appropriation Act of 1924&quot; established the Border Patrol as an agency of the U.S. Department of Labor assigned to prevent illegal entries—primarily along the Mexico–United States border, as well as the Canada–U.S. border. The first Border Patrol station began operations in Detroit, Michigan, in June 1924. A second station, in El Paso, Texas, began operations in July 1924. In 1925, coastal patrols began as well. Operations were established along the Gulf Coast in 1927 to ensure that foreign crewmen departed on the same ship on which they arrived. In 1932, the Border Patrol was divided into two offices. Mexican border operations were directed from El Paso, Texas, and Canadian border operations were directed from Detroit, Michigan. The Canadian border operations from Detroit employed more men than the El Paso operations along the Mexican border because of a focus on the prevention of liquor smuggling during prohibition. Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s Executive Order 6166 formed the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in 1933 by consolidation of the Bureau of Immigration and the Bureau of Naturalization. Following the outbreak of World War II in Europe, Border Patrol staffing doubled to 1,500 in 1940, and the INS was moved from the Department of Labor to the U.S. Department of Justice. Additional stations were temporarily added along the Gulf Coast, Florida and the Eastern Seaboard during the 1960s after Fidel Castro triumphed in the Cuban Revolution, and that was followed by the Cuban Missile Crisis. The INS was decommissioned in March 2003 when its operations were divided between U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In the wake of the attacks of September 11, 2001, the Border Patrol was placed under the umbrella of the United States Department of Homeland Security, and preventing terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the United States was added to its mission. The Border Patrol&#x27;s traditional mission continued: deterring, detecting and apprehending illegal aliens and individuals involved in the illegal drug trade who generally entered the United States at places other than through designated ports of entry. The Border Patrol also erected 33 permanent interior checkpoints near the southern border of the United States.

For fiscal year 2019, the nationwide total of Border Patrol agents was 19,648, with 16,731 patrolling the southern border. Agents primarily patrol the Mexico–United States border, where they control drug trafficking and illegal immigration.

The majority of Border Patrol agents are minorities. According to 2016 data, Latinos constitute slightly more than 50% of the Border Patrol.

In late 2021, after public criticism, the Border Patrol outfitted agents with body cameras, which it had rejected in 2015 as too expensive, bad for agent morale, and unreliable; it had previously required state and local law enforcement to turn off their body cameras during joint operations with CBP.

In September 2021, while mounted Border Patrol agents in Del Rio, Texas, responded to an influx of refugees from Haiti crossing the Mexico–United States border, a photograph was captured of an agent appearing to use his bridle reins as a whip against a Haitian migrant. U.S. President Joe Biden said, &quot;To see people treated like they did, horses barely running over, people being strapped. It&#x27;s outrageous. I promise you those people will pay. There will be an investigation underway now, and there will be consequences. There will be consequences.&quot; The photographer, when interviewed, said he did not see any whipping. Months later, in November 2021, The Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s Office of Inspector General (OIG) declined to investigate allegations against the agents on horseback.

==Strategy==

===1986: Employer sanctions and interior enforcement===

The Border Patrol&#x27;s priorities have changed over the years. In 1986, the Immigration Reform and Control Act placed renewed emphasis on controlling illegal immigration by going after the employers that hire illegal aliens. The belief was that jobs were the magnet that attracted most illegal aliens to come to the United States. The Border Patrol increased interior enforcement and Form I-9 audits of businesses through an inspection program known as &quot;employer sanctions&quot;. Several agents were assigned to interior stations, such as within the Livermore Sector in Northern California.

Employer sanctions never became the effective tool it was expected to be by Congress. Illegal immigration continued to swell after the 1986 amnesty despite employer sanctions. By 1993, Californians passed Proposition 187, denying benefits to illegal aliens and criminalizing illegal aliens in possession of forged green cards, identification cards, and Social Security numbers. It also authorized police officers to question non-nationals as to their immigration status and required police and sheriff departments to cooperate and report illegal aliens to the INS. Proposition 187 drew nationwide attention to illegal immigration.

====Checkpoint stations====
United States Border Patrol Interior Checkpoints are inspection stations operated by the USBP within of an international border (with Mexico or Canada) or any U.S. coastline.

====El Paso Sector&#x27;s Operation Hold the Line====
El Paso Sector Chief Patrol Agent Silvestre Reyes started a program called &quot;Operation Hold the Line&quot;. In this program, Border Patrol agents would no longer react to illegal entries resulting in apprehensions, but would instead be forward deployed to the border, immediately detecting any attempted entries or deterring crossing at a more remote location. The idea was that it would be easier to capture illegal entrants in the wide open deserts than through the urban alleyways. Chief Reyes deployed his agents along the Rio Grande, within eyesight of other agents. The program significantly reduced illegal entries in the urban part of El Paso by shifting them to other areas.

====San Diego sector&#x27;s Operation Gatekeeper====

Congressman Duncan Hunter became a major proponent of additional border fencing in the San Diego sector; surplus military landing mats were obtained to use as an initial border fence. Stadium lighting, ground sensors and infra-red cameras were also placed in the area. Eventually the primitive landing mat fence was replaced with a modern triple fence line that begins over one hundred yards into the Pacific Ocean at Imperial Beach, California, and ends more than 13 miles (19 km) inland on Otay Mesa where the mountains begin.

====Northern border====

Through agency whistleblowers, Agent Mark Hall and Agent Robert Lindemann, it was revealed that in 2001, the Border Patrol had approximately 324 agents assigned along the Canada–United States border. Northern border staffing had been increased by 1,128 agents to 1,470 agents by the end of fiscal year 2008, and is projected to expand to 1,845 by the end of fiscal year 2009, a six-fold increase. Resources that support Border Patrol agents include the use of new technology and a more focused application of air and marine assets.

The northern border sectors are (west to east): Blaine (Washington), Spokane (Washington), Havre (Montana), Grand Forks (North Dakota), Detroit (Selfridge ANGB, Michigan), Buffalo (New York), Swanton (Vermont), and Houlton (Maine).

===New strategy===
In November 2005, the U.S. Border Patrol published an updated national strategy. The goal of this updated strategy was operational control of the United States border. The strategy has five main objectives:
*Apprehend terrorists and terrorist weapons illegally entering the United States
*Deter illegal entries through improved enforcement
*Detect, apprehend, and deter smugglers of humans, drugs, and other contraband
*Use &quot;smart border&quot; technology
*Reduce crime in border communities, improving quality of life.

==Capabilities==
The United States border is a barely discernible line in the uninhabited deserts, canyons, or mountains and rivers. The Border Patrol utilizes a variety of equipment and methods, such as electronic sensors placed at strategic locations along the border, to detect people or vehicles entering the country illegally. Video monitors and night vision scopes are also used to detect illegal entries. Agents patrol the border in vehicles, boats, aircraft, and afoot. In some areas, the Border Patrol employs horses, all-terrain motorcycles, bicycles, and snowmobiles. Air surveillance capabilities are provided by unmanned aerial vehicles.

The primary activity of a Border Patrol agent is &quot;line watch&quot;. Line watch involves the detection, prevention, and apprehension of terrorists, illegal aliens and smugglers of aliens at or near the land border by maintaining surveillance from a covert position; following up on leads; responding to electronic sensor, television systems and aircraft sightings; and interpreting and following tracks, marks, and other physical evidence. Major activities include traffic check, traffic observation, city patrol, transportation check, administrative, intelligence, and anti-smuggling activities.

Traffic checks are conducted on major highways leading away from the border to detect and apprehend illegal aliens attempting to travel further into the interior of the United States after evading detection at the border, and to detect illegal narcotics.

Transportation checks are inspections of interior-bound conveyances, which include buses, commercial aircraft, passenger and freight trains, and marine craft.

Marine patrols are conducted along the coastal waterways of the United States, primarily along the Pacific coast, the Caribbean, the tip of Florida, and Puerto Rico and interior waterways common to the United States and Canada. The Border Patrol conducts patrol activities from 130 marine craft of various sizes. The Border Patrol maintains watercraft ranging from blue-water craft to inflatable-hull craft, in 16 sectors, in addition to headquarters and special operations components. The Border Patrol Marine Position was created in 2009 (BPA-M).

Horse and bike patrols are used to augment regular vehicle and foot patrols. Horse units patrol remote areas along the international boundary that are inaccessible to standard all-terrain vehicles. Bike patrol aids city patrol and is used over rough terrain to support line watch. Snowmobiles are used to patrol remote areas along the northern border in the winter.

==Expansion==
In 1992, the United States Border Patrol had approximately 4,139 patrol agents on the job. Attrition in the Border Patrol was normally at 5%. From 1995 to 2001 annual attrition rose to above 10%, which was a period when the Border Patrol was undergoing massive hiring. In 2002 the attrition rate climbed to 18%. The 18% attrition was largely attributed to agents transferring to the Federal Air Marshals after 9/11. In 2017, the attrition rate was at 6%.

The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (signed by President Bush on December 17, 2004) authorized hiring an additional 10,000 agents, &quot;subject to appropriation&quot;. This authorization nearly doubled the Border Patrol size, from 11,000 to 20,000 agents by 2010. As of 2016, roughly half of the agents are Latino Americans. The Border Patrol has the lowest proportion of female agents or officers of any federal agency.

The Secure Fence Act, signed by President Bush on October 26, 2006, has met with much opposition. In October 2007, environmental groups and concerned citizens filed a restraining order hoping to halt the construction of the fence, set to be built between the United States and Mexico. The act mandated that the fence be built by December 2008. Ultimately, the United States seeks to put fencing around the border, but the act requires only of fencing. DHS secretary Michael Chertoff has bypassed environmental and other oppositions with a waiver that was granted to him by Congress in Section 102 of the act, which allows DHS to avoid any conflicts that would prevent a speedy assembly of the fence.

This action has led many environment groups and landowners to speak out against the impending construction of the fence. Environment and wildlife groups fear that the plans to clear brush, construct fences, install bright lights, motion sensors, and cameras will scare wildlife and endanger the indigenous species of the area. Environmentalists claim that the ecosystem could be affected because a border fence would restrict movement of all animal species, which in turn would keep them from water and food sources on one side or another. Desert plants would also feel the impact, as they would be uprooted in many areas where the fence is set to occupy.

In 2008, property owners in these areas feared a loss of land. Landowners would have had to give some of their land over to the government for the fence. Brownsville mayor Pat Ahumada favored alternative options to a border fence. He suggested that the Rio Grande be widened and deepened to provide for a natural barrier to hinder illegal aliens and drug smugglers.

==Other specialized programs==

In 2007, the U.S. Border Patrol created the special operations group (SOG) headquartered in El Paso, Texas, to coordinate the special operations units of the agency.
The U.S. Border Patrol has a number of other specialized programs and details. Marine patrol – In the riverine environments of the northern and southwestern borders of the continental United States, the Border Patrol conducts border control activities from the decks of marine craft of various sizes. Since 2006, the U.S. Border Patrol has relinquished its littoral law enforcement missions in the Great Lakes and territorial seas to the Office of Air and Marine. The U.S. Border Patrol maintains over 130 vessels, ranging from blue-water craft to inflatable-hull craft, in 16 sectors, in addition to headquarters special operations components.

K9 units, mounted patrols, bike patrols, sign-cutting (tracking), snowmobile units, infrared-scope units, intelligence, anti-smuggling investigations unit (ASU/DISRUPT, Border Criminal Alien Program, multi-agency anti-gang task forces (regional and local units), honor guards, pipes and drums, chaplains, peer support, and mobile surveillance units.

== Deterrence ==

&quot;Operation Gatekeeper&quot; was launched in 1994 to stop aliens from crossing illegally into the United States. The strategy included increased enforcement and extensive fencing near border cities, with the two-fold purpose of deflecting aliens to remote areas where they could more easily be detected and apprehended, as well as using mountains, deserts, and Rio Grande as a deterrent to easy passage. The newly erected Mexico–United States barrier—which at some remote locations is no more than a fence—has also forced aliens and human traffickers to seek out remote desert locations in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas where they may attempt crossing. The &quot;funnel effect&quot; created by both these strategies has contributed to the deaths of thousands of aliens, whose remains are often found in the hot desert or freezing mountains.

As early as 1998, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service implemented the Border Safety Initiative in response to concerns about the number of aliens injured or killed while attempting to cross the border. It was noted that Border Patrol agents routinely supplied water, food, and medical care to aliens. That same year, Border Patrol, Search, Trauma and Rescue (BORSTAR), a specialized unit trained in emergency search and rescue, was established with the purpose of assisting injured or stranded aliens at remote locations.

In 2002, the first &quot;rescue beacons&quot; were installed in desert areas considered especially dangerous. The beacons are solar powered and highly visible, and have a button which alerts Border Patrol agents by radio signal, after which a helicopter or ground unit is dispatched. U.S. Senator Bill Frist commented in 2006: &quot;these beacons, I believe, are an absolutely vital link in our border security system... We know that beacons work: CBP has already saved dozens of people based entirely on beacon alerts.&quot; The Border Patrol frequently publishes reports about stranded and injured individuals rescued at beacon locations.

In fiscal year 2020, Border Patrol agents and Air and Marine Operations agents are credited with saving more than 5,000 people and conducted approximately 1,400 search and rescue operations.

==Sectors==

There are 20 Border Patrol sectors, each headed by a sector chief patrol agent.

==Training==
All Border Patrol agents spend a minimum of 26 weeks at the Border Patrol Academy in Artesia, New Mexico, which is a component of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC). Border Patrol Agent Trainees are instructed in courses including; Spanish, criminal law, nationality law, and administrative immigration law, police sciences, self-defense and arrest techniques, firearms training with pistol, shotgun and rifle, police vehicle driving, and other Border Patrol / federal law enforcement subjects.

Once they arrive back at their duty station, Trainees then must graduate from the Field Training program, an on-the-job training program led by a Field Training Officer (FTO), which varies in length from a minimum of 12 weeks to a maximum of over 16 weeks long, depending on the practical demands of the duty station and local management.

==Appearance==
===Uniforms===
The Border Patrol, around the year 2007, wore the following types of uniforms:

* Summer dress uniform – The summer dress uniform consists of a short-sleeve, olive-green dress shirt (which may or may not have blue shoulder straps), brass nameplate, badge, olive-green slacks with a blue stripe running the length of the seam, and black dress shoes or dress boots. A green, straw campaign hat is worn with this uniform.
* Winter dress uniform – The winter dress uniform consists of a long-sleeve, olive green dress shirt, navy-blue clip-on tie with a brass tie tack, olive-green ike jacket with blue accents (shoulder straps and cuffs), brass nameplate, badge, olive-green slacks with a blue stripe running the length of the seam, and black dress shoes or dress boots. A green, felt campaign hat with a black, leather hat band is worn with this uniform.
* Ceremonial dress uniform – Worn primarily by Border Patrol honor guard agents, the ceremonial dress uniform is roughly identical to the winter dress uniform, with the exception that a tunic is worn with this uniform, rather than an ike jacket. White, cloth gloves are also worn with this uniform. 
* Rough duty uniform – The rough duty uniform consists of a green, long-sleeve or short-sleeve work shirt, green cargo pants, and black work boots; a green baseball cap or cowboy hat is typically worn with this uniform.
** There are also specialized rough duty uniforms for marine patrol (riverine), northern border cold weather, horse patrol and bike patrol agents.
* Highland uniform – Worn by members of the United States Border Patrol Pipes and Drums in the performance of their official duties, this uniform includes a kilt made of the official Border Patrol tartan, custom made olive-green ceremonial coat, glengarry, sporran and white spats.
* Organization patches – The Border Patrol wears two:
** The CBP patch is worn on the right sleeves of the uniform. It contains the DHS seal against a black background with a &quot;keystone&quot; shape. A keystone is the central, wedge-shaped stone in an arch, which holds all the other stones in place.
** Border Patrol agents retain the circular legacy Border Patrol patch, which is worn on the left sleeve.

The Border Patrol uniform got its first makeover since the 1950s to appear more like military fatigues and less like a police officer&#x27;s duty garb. Leather belts with brass buckles have been replaced by nylon belts with quick-release plastic buckles, slacks have been replaced by lightweight cargo pants, and shiny badges and nameplates have been replaced by cloth patches.

===Ranks and insignia===
====Shoulder ornaments====

==Awards==
===Newton-Azrak Award for Heroism===
The Border Patrol&#x27;s highest honor is the Newton-Azrak Award for Heroism. This award is bestowed to Border Patrol agents for extraordinary actions, service; accomplishments reflecting unusual courage or bravery in the line of duty; or an extraordinarily heroic or humane act committed during times of extreme stress or in an emergency.

This award is named for Border Patrol inspectors Theodore Newton and George Azrak, who were murdered by two drug smugglers in San Diego County in 1967.

==Uniform devices==
==Equipment==

===Weapons===

Border Patrol agents have a choice of being issued either the Glock 47 or the Glock 19M pistol in 9mm caliber. The Glock 47 can contain as many as 18 rounds of ammunition (17 in the magazine and 1 in the chamber), while the Glock 19 can contain as many as 16 rounds. Up until 1995 the Border Patrol issued its patrol agents .357 Magnum revolvers as their duty sidearms, Smith &amp; Wesson or Ruger model large frame, six-shot revolvers. The Border Patrol preferred this weapon because it did not jam in harsh conditions, like those of the southwestern border, and also because of the strong &quot;stopping power&quot; of the .357 Magnum cartridge. Although up until 1995 patrol agents could purchase weapons from the agency list of approved authorized personal weapons for duty carry. This list included the Glock Models 17 and 19 pistols in 9 mm, the SIG Sauer P220 pistol in .45 ACP caliber, the Colt Python .357 Magnum revolver, and the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 19/66 .357 Magnum revolver. The Border Patrol adopted the Beretta Model 96D, a .40 S&amp;W caliber semi-automatic pistol (modified for double-action only) (with 11-round capacity magazines) as its duty issue sidearm in 1995. The .40 S&amp;W caliber jacketed hollow-point cartridge was adopted because of its excellent &quot;stopping power&quot; and its superior ballistic characteristics over the 9 mm cartridge. In late 2006 the H&amp;K P2000 pistol was adopted as the Border Patrol&#x27;s primary duty sidearm. The H&amp;K Model USP compact pistol, H&amp;K Model P2000SK (sub-compact) and Beretta M96D .40 S&amp;W caliber pistols are authorized as secondary sidearms.

On April 9, 2019, CBP announced that the U.S. Border Patrol would transition from the .40 caliber H&amp;K P2000 to an unnamed 9-millimeter Glock pistol, by the end of fiscal year 2021. It has since been revealed that the three Glock handguns that are to be issued to CBP officers and agents are the model G26, model G19, and the specifically manufactured for CBP model G47.

Like many other law enforcement agencies, the 12 gauge Remington Model 870 is the standard pump-action shotgun. The Border Patrol issue Model 870 has been modified by Scattergun Technologies to Border Patrol specifications including: a 14-inch barrel, a five-shot capacity magazine, a composite stock with pistol grip, and night sights with a tactical &quot;ghost-ring&quot; rear sight. The old Border Patrol &quot;anti-bandit&quot; units used to use 12-gauge, semi-automatic shotguns with sawed-off barrels. This weapon had the designated name of a &quot;Sidewinder&quot;. The USBP anti-bandit units were decommissioned in the late 1980s.

Border Patrol agents also commonly carry the Colt M4 Carbine (specifically, the updated M4A1) using agency-issued 64-grain, .223 caliber ammunition and the H&amp;K UMP .40 caliber submachine gun. The .308 caliber M14 rifle is used for ceremonial purposes and by agents who are qualified with the rifle and BORTAC.

As a less than lethal option, the Border Patrol uses the FN 303 launcher. The FN 303 fires 40mm plastic pellet balls containing OC (oleoresin capsicum) pepper dust. The plastic pellet balls burst on impact spraying the suspect with OC pepper dust and also acts as impact projectiles. The Border Patrol also issues its agents OC pepper spray canisters, tasers and a collapsible/telescopic (or telescoping) steel police baton.

===Transportation===


Unlike in many other law enforcement agencies in the United States, the Border Patrol operates over 10,000 SUVs and pickup trucks, which are known for their capabilities to move around in any sort of terrain. These vehicles may have individual revolving lights (strobes or LEDs) and/or light bars and sirens and/or have their bumpers removed or have off-road suspension and tires. An extensive modernization drive has ensured that these vehicles are equipped with wireless sets in communication with a central control room. Border Patrol vehicles may also have equipment such as emergency first aid kits. Some sectors make use of sedans like the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor or the Dodge Charger as patrol cars or high speed &quot;interceptors&quot; on highways. The U.S. Border Patrol has approximately 2,000 sedans. The Border Patrol also operates all-terrain vehicles, motorcycles, snowmobiles, and small boats in riverine environments.

In 2005, all Border Patrol and ICE aircraft operations were combined under CBP&#x27;s Office of Air and Marine. All CBP vessel operations within the Customs Waters and on the high seas are conducted by Marine Interdiction Agents of the Office of Air and Marine.

Color schemes of Border Patrol vehicles are either a long green stripe running the length of the vehicle (older vehicles) or a broad green diagonal stripe (newer vehicles) on the door. Most Border Patrol vehicles are painted predominantly white. During the 1960s to 1991 Border Patrol vehicles were painted a light green.

The Border Patrol also extensively uses horses for remote area patrols. , the U.S. Border Patrol has 205 horses. Most are employed along the Mexico–United States border. In Arizona, these animals are fed special processed feed pellets so that their wastes do not spread non-native plants in the national parks and wildlife areas they patrol.

==Killed in the line of duty==
Since 1904, the Border Patrol has had 156 inspectors/officers/agents along with 6 K9s killed in the line of duty, more than any other federal law enforcement agency during that time period.

==Armed incursions==
On March 14, 2000, 16 Mexican soldiers in two humvees chased a Border Patrol agent near Santa Teresa, New Mexico, while another agent came under gunfire. Backup arrived and nine of the soldiers were detained. The Mexican government said the soldiers were unfamiliar with the border in that area as those soldiers were normally deployed to Mexico&#x27;s interior. The U.S. State Department ordered them sent back to Mexico along with their weapons.

On August 7, 2008, Mexican troops crossed the border into Arizona and held a U.S. Border Patrol Agent at gunpoint. Agents stationed at Ajo, Arizona, said that the Mexican soldiers crossed the border into an isolated area southwest of Tucson and pointed rifles at the agent, who has not been identified. The Mexicans withdrew after other U.S. agents arrived on the scene.

On May 24, 2022, 18-year-old Salvador Rolando Ramos entered Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, and fatally shot nineteen students and two teachers with an AR-15 rifle. Ramos had legally purchased two AR-15s and ammunition a few days earlier. Agents of U.S. Customs and BORTAC responded to the scene, and within minutes of their arrival, fatally shot Ramos, ending his 70-minute rampage. One agent suffered an injury.

==Death threats==
Testifying in front of the United States Senate, Border Patrol Chief Mark Morgan said that the Border Patrol is one of the most assaulted law enforcement agencies; since 2006, over seven thousand agents of the Border Patrol were attacked. On numerous occasions USBP agents have been fired upon from the Mexican side of the international border. Intelligence gathering has discovered bounties being placed on Patrol Agents to be paid by criminal smuggling organizations upon the confirmed murder or kidnapping of a U.S. Border Patrol Agent. In 2008, intelligence learned of a two-million-dollar contract for the murder of a Border Patrol Agent. In 2009 Border Patrol Agent Rosas was murdered in an ambush while on patrol; a bounty may have been paid to the assassins.

==Criticisms==
===Payouts to settle claims of mistreatment===
Official data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows that between 2005 and 2017, the federal government paid out more than $60,000,000 in legal settlements of cases in which border agents were involved in deaths, driving injuries, alleged assaults, and wrongful detention. For example, in the 2003 case of Ricardo Olivares, the agent who fired the shot who killed him was not prosecuted, by decision of the U.S. Department of Justice, but a civil suit filed by the man&#x27;s family resulted in an award of $350,000.

===Ramos and Compean===
In February 2005, Border Patrol Agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean were involved in an incident while pursuing a van in Fabens, Texas. The driver, later identified as Aldrete Davila, was shot by Agent Ramos during a scuffle. Davila escaped back into Mexico, and the agents discovered that the van contained a million dollars worth of marijuana (about 750 pounds). None of the agents at the scene orally reported the shooting, including two supervisors: Robert Arnold, first-line Supervisor and Jonathan Richards, a higher ranking Field Operations Supervisor.
Ramos and Compean were charged with multiple crimes. Ramos was convicted of causing serious bodily injury, assault with a deadly weapon, discharge of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, and a civil rights violation. Compeán was found guilty on 11 counts, including discharging a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, which by itself carries a federally mandated 10-year minimum sentence. Without that charge, both agents involved would have received far shorter sentences. Ramos was sentenced to 11 years and a day in prison and Compean to 12 years. Jonathan Richards was promoted to the Patrol Agent in Charge of the Santa Teresa, New Mexico Border Patrol Station soon after the incident. On January 19, 2009, President Bush commuted the sentences of both Ramos and Compean, effectively ending their prison term on March 20, 2009, and they were released on February 17, 2009. The case generated widely differing opinion among various commentators and advocacy groups: civil libertarians asserted the agents used illegal and excessive force, while advocates of tighter border control defended the agents actions.

===Death of Anastasio Hernández-Rojas===

On May 30, 2010, Anastasio Hernandez-Rojas died of a heart attack while in the custody of United States Border Patrol (USBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and agents and officers at the San Diego–Tijuana border. He was beaten and then shocked by tasers at the San Ysidro Port of Entry, within view of many bystanders with cameras on the busy pedestrian bridge. Although the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation concluded on November 6, 2015, that Hernández-Rojas died of a heart attack, an offer of a million-dollar settlement was made to his family. None of the agents or officers involved were fired or disciplined for excessive use of force. In February 2017, his common-law wife and five children accepted the settlement. Hernández-Rojas&#x27;s death was profiled in a 2012 PBS report called &quot;Crossing the Line&quot;, in Nonny de la Peña&#x27;s 2013 five-minute-long virtual reality called &quot;Use of Force&quot;, and in a 2014 American Civil Liberties Union report.

===Death of Sergio Hernandez===
Sergio Adrian Hernandez was a teenager who was shot once and killed on June 7, 2010, by Border Patrol agents under a bridge crossing between El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico.

Border Patrol agents claimed that there was a mob that pelted them with rocks. For his involvement in the incident, Border Patrol agent Jesus Mesa, Jr., invoked qualified immunity in his defense. In February 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Hernandez family may not bring suit against the agent, highlighting the 1971 case &quot;Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents&quot; in the majority opinion.

On June 10, Mexican President Felipe Calderón called on the United States to launch a &quot;thorough, impartial&quot; probe into the deaths of two Mexican nationals, including the 14-year-old Hernandez, at the hands of U.S. border police: &quot;I demand the United States government conduct a thorough, impartial...investigation, concluding with an establishment of the facts and punishment of the culprits.&quot;

On June 12, 2010, the television network Univision aired cellphone video footage of the incident, after which Mexican legislators called unsuccessfully for the extradition of the officer accused of the shooting.

===Death of José Antonio Elena Rodríguez===
In October 2012, 16-year-old José Antonio Elena Rodríguez was killed in downtown Nogales, Mexico, when a Border Patrol Agent, Lonnie Swartz, opened fire at a group of people allegedly throwing rocks at him; Rodriguez was shot eight times in the back and twice in the head. Swartz was criminally charged, but in November 2018, a jury found him not guilty.

===Incidents involving use of tear gas and pepper spray===
On November 25, 2013, the San Diego Tribune reported that 100 aliens who tried to cross the border illegally near the San Ysidro port were pepper-sprayed and tear-gassed after throwing bottles and rocks at border patrol agents. A similar incident was reported in November 2018.

===Allegations of abuse===
Various civil activist and human rights organizations have alleged abuses of illegal aliens by Border Patrol agents:
According to the ACLU of Texas, between 2010 and December 13, 2021, there were 46 migrant deaths while in the custody of the Border Patrol, and 68 deaths as a result of Border Patrol-involved car chases.

In October 2021 Human Rights Watch released reports by U.S. asylum officers of over 160 reports of mistreatment by Border Patrol agents. In some cases the asylum officers apologized to the migrants for the treatment they had received from the Border Patrol. According to Clara Long, associate director of Human Rights Watch, &quot;The documents make clear that reports of grievous C.B.P. [Customs and Border Protection] abuses—physical and sexual assaults, abusive detention conditions and violations of due process—are an open secret within D.H.S. [Department of Homeland Security]. They paint a picture of D.H.S. as an agency that appears to have normalized shocking abuses at the U.S. border.&quot;

In 2018, activists alleged that water and food supplies left for illegal aliens were regularly destroyed by the Border Patrol.

June 7, 2018: On a bus travelling from Bakersfield to Las Vegas, agents from the United States Border Patrol stopped and boarded a Greyhound bus at an agricultural checkpoint near the Nevada State Line. The United States Border Patrol agents had no authorization to stop the Greyhound bus or interrogate passengers since the location was not within the 100 air mile zone of the United States Border as authorized by section 287 of the INA. A passenger recognized that the agents of the United States Border Patrol lacked authorization to conduct their interrogations. All other passengers aboard the Greyhound bus were notified that United States Border Patrol agents were not supposed to be stopping the bus or conducting interrogations. After a short argument with the passenger who alerted everybody, the United States Border Patrol agents left the bus. Later, the passenger who had argued with the United States Border Patrol agents decided to post an online petition on change.org titled &quot;Greyhound: Stop endangering migrants&quot; as a warning for passengers against unauthorised searches by agents of DHS, ICE, and United States Border Patrol. The online petition has gathered over 60,934 signatures worldwide.

Between 2010 and 2011 alleged excessive use of force by Border Patrol agents and Field Operations officers led to the death of six Mexican citizens. A PBS report, &quot;Crossing the Line&quot;, released in July 2012, profiled the case of Hernández-Rojas who died after being beaten and while in custody of the USBP, ICE, and CBP in May 2010. In 2012, in a letter to President Obama posted on the website of the Washington Office on Latin America, 118 civil society organizations criticized the Border Patrol for failing to thoroughly investigate the incident and stated that the Border Patrol &quot;is operating with very little transparency and virtual impunity, especially in the southern border region where Border Patrol and other CBP agents regularly violate the human and civil rights of those who call the border region home.&quot;

From 2008 to 2011, the Arizona organization No More Deaths interviewed nearly 13,000 illegal aliens who had been in Border Patrol custody, in the Arizona border towns of Naco, Nogales, and Agua Prieta. Their report, &quot;A Culture of Cruelty&quot;, documents alleged abuses including denial of or insufficient water and food; failure to provide medical treatment; verbal, physical and psychological abuse; separation of family members; and dangerous repatriation practices. In February 2012, Border Patrol Chief Michael Fisher stated in congressional testimony that the Border Patrol takes allegations of abuse seriously. No More Deaths testified before the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights in March 2012 that in spite of raising their concerns for several years, &quot;the agency has taken the position that such abuses simply do not occur.&quot;

There are allegations of abuse by the United States Border Patrol, such as the ones reported by Jesus A. Trevino, that concludes in an article published in the &quot;Houston Journal of International Law&quot; (2006) with a request to create an independent review commission to oversee the actions of the Border Patrol, and that creating such review board will make the American public aware of the &quot;serious problem of abuse that exists at the border by making this review process public&quot; and that &quot;illegal immigrants deserve the same constitutionally-mandated humane treatment of citizens and legal residents&quot;.

In 1998, Amnesty International investigated allegations of ill-treatment and brutality by officers of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and particularly the Border Patrol. Their report said they found indications of human rights violations during 1996, 1997, and early 1998.

An article in &quot;Social Justice&quot; by Michael Huspek, Leticia Jimenez, Roberto Martinez (1998) cites that in December 1997, John Case, head of the INS Office of Internal Audit, announced at a press conference that public complaints to the INS had risen 29% from 1996, with the &quot;vast majority&quot; of complaints emanating from the southwest border region, but that of the 2,300 cases, the 243 cases of serious allegations of abuse were down in 1997. These serious cases are considered to be distinct from less serious complaints, such as &quot;verbal abuse, discrimination, extended detention without cause.&quot;

At some Greyhound stations and along certain routes, agents from United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and United States Border Patrol have been known to stop and interrogate passengers. While DHS, ICE, and US Border Patrol Agents are legally allowed to interrogate passengers within 100 air miles of the borders of the United States, according to the ACLU and some legal experts, without a warrant, United States Border Patrol agents need the explicit consent of Greyhound to be on Greyhound property. Protesters against Greyhound Bus Lines allowing the DHS and ICE agents to board the buses have posted an online petition titled &quot;Greyhound: Stop Throwing Passengers Under the BUS&quot; on the ACLU website, which gathered 111,895 signatures as of 2019. As of February 21, 2020 Greyhound refuses unwarranted inspections. A memo addressed to all chief patrol agents and signed by then-Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost said agents can&#x27;t board private buses without consent from bus companies.

Between September 2018 and September 2019, ten aliens died in the custody of the U.S. Border Patrol or its parent agency.

===Corruption===
According to Reveal News, between 2006 and 2016 more than 130 officers employed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection were caught in alleged acts of mission-compromising corruption – often by letting drugs, undocumented immigrants, or both into the country. &quot;While that&#x27;s a tiny fraction of the total number of agents, report after report has suggested the known cases may be the tip of the iceberg.&quot;

Incidents of corruption in the U.S. Border Patrol include:
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection gave Accenture Federal Services a $297 million contract in 2017 to hire 7,500 people over five years. An audit by the Department of Homeland Security found that, as of Oct. 1, 2018, Accenture had already been paid $13.6 million but had only hired two people.
*Pablo Sergio Barry, an agent charged with one count of harboring an illegal alien (8 U.S.C. § 1324), three counts of false statements, and two counts of making a false document. He pleaded guilty.
*Christopher E. Bernis, an agent indicted on a charge of harboring an illegal alien for nine months while employed as a U.S. Border Patrol Agent.
*Jose De Jesus Ruiz, an agent whose girlfriend was an illegal alien. He was put on administrative leave pending an investigation.
*Oscar Antonio Ortiz, an illegal alien who used a fake birth certificate to get into the Border Patrol. He admitted to smuggling more than 100 illegal aliens into the U.S., some of them in his government truck. He was charged with conspiring with another agent to smuggle aliens.
*An unidentified patrol agent who was recorded on a wiretap stating that he helped to smuggle 30 to 50 aliens at a time.
* Joel Luna, a Border Patrol agent, was convicted in 2017 of engaging in criminal activity and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He was acquitted on a murder charge. He was involved in smuggling drugs into the United States and guns to Mexico.

===Facebook===

In 2019, U.S. Border Patrol supervisors discovered many employees posting inappropriate content in a private Facebook group. The &quot;group where agents posted sexist and callous references to migrants and the politicians who support them reinforced the perception that agents often view the vulnerable people in their care with frustration and contempt.&quot; Carla Provost, at the time head of the agency, was among them; she retired in 2020.

== Morale ==
According to a posting in &quot;Law Enforcement Today&quot; in August 2021, morale among Border Patrol agents was &quot;in the toilet&quot;. In Del Rio, Texas, where illegal aliens were so numerous they were detained in a squalid camp underneath the international bridge, agents were so overwhelmed with processing those arriving aliens that self-surrendered that there were no agents patrolling large stretches of the border.

In 2019, agents stated that &quot;people actively hate us&quot;.

==National council==
National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) is the labor union which represents over 17,000 Border Patrol agents and support staff. The NBPC was founded on November 1, 1965, and its parent organization is the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL–CIO. The NBPC&#x27;s executive committee is staffed by current and retired Border Patrol agents and, along with its constituent locals, employs a staff of a dozen attorneys and field representatives. The NBPC is associated with the Peace Officer Research Association of California Legal Defense Fund|California&#x27;s Legal Defense Fund.

==Foundation==
The Border Patrol Foundation was founded in 2009 to assist the survivors of agents killed in the line of duty. The foundation provides financial support to immediate family members, peer family support, and a scholarship to eligible children. The foundation recognizes community leaders who have supported the families of fallen agents, and supports programs to improve awareness of the risks faced by agents.

<doc id="567457" wikidata="Q389083" url="?curid=567457" title="Palestine (graphic novel)">
<text>Palestine is a non-fiction graphic novel written and drawn by Joe Sacco about his experiences in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in December 1991 and January 1992. Sacco&#x27;s portrayal of the situation emphasizes the history and plight of the Palestinian people, as a group and as individuals.

==Publication history==
The complete graphic novel, published in 2001 by Fantagraphics Books, collects nine issues of Sacco&#x27;s &quot;Palestine&quot; comic book, published by Fantagraphics from 1993 to 1995; the single volume edition includes an introduction by Edward Said. In 1996, Fantagraphics had released a two-part collection of the series — &quot;Palestine, a Nation Occupied&quot; (collecting &quot;Palestine&quot; #1–5) and &quot;Palestine: In the Gaza Strip&quot; (collecting issues #6–9). An expanded edition was released in 2007.

In 2023, in the wake of the Israel-Hamas conflict resuming, the book sold out and was rushed back into publication by Fantagraphics after selling out their inventory.

==Plot summary==
The book takes place over a two-month period in late 1991 / early 1992, with occasional flashbacks to the expulsion of the Arabs, the beginning of the Intifada, the Gulf War and other events in the more immediate past. Sacco spent this time meeting with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the narrative focuses on the minute details of everyday life in these areas.

In &quot;Palestine&quot; Sacco positions himself knowingly as the westerner going to the Middle East to confront a reality unfamiliar to his American audience. Sacco does not delude himself that as a &quot;neutral&quot; observer he can remain invisible and have no effect on the events around him, instead accepting his role and concentrating on his personal experience of the situation. Though his goal is to document events and interview Palestinians he is affected by the reality of the occupied territories and cannot help but participate in, and comment on, demonstrations, funerals, roadblocks and encounters with soldiers. Towards the end he becomes even more active as he shares food and lodgings with the Palestinians he interviews and even breaks curfew with them while in the Gaza Strip.

In the book Sacco references Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Under Western Eyes&quot;, &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, and Edward Said&#x27;s &quot;Orientalism&quot; to draw links between the situation he is witnessing and colonialism. Towards the end of the book, when challenged by an Israeli that he has not experienced their point of view, he responds that the Israeli point of view is what he has internalized his whole life, and although another trip would be necessary to fully experience Israel, that was not why he was there.

== Awards ==
The 1996 two-volume collection of &quot;Palestine&quot; was awarded the 1996 American Book Award by the Before Columbus Foundation. In 1999, &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; — like &quot;Palestine&quot;, also published by Fantagraphics — named &quot;Palestine&quot; as #27 in the Top 100 English-Language Comics of the Century. The book was given the 2002 Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Best Graphic Novel.

<text>Joe Sacco (; born October 2, 1960) is a Maltese-American cartoonist and journalist. He is credited as the first artist to practice rigorous, investigative journalism using the comics form, also referred to as comics journalism. His groundbreaking work documenting Palestinian life in the Occupied Territories was awarded the National Book Award in 1996 and was compiled in the graphic narrative &quot;Palestine&quot; (2001)&quot;.&quot; His other notable monographs include &quot;Footnotes in Gaza&quot; (2009) which won a Ridenhour Book Prize. Other notable works include &quot;Safe Area Goražde&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Fixer&quot; (2003) on the Bosnian War. In 2020, Sacco released &quot;&quot;, published by Henry Holt and Company. 

==Biography==
Sacco was born in Malta on October 2, 1960. His father Leonard was an engineer and his mother Carmen was a teacher. At the age of one, he moved with his family to Melbourne, Australia, where he spent his childhood until 1972, when they moved to Los Angeles. He began his journalism career working on the Sunset High School newspaper in Beaverton, Oregon. While journalism was his primary focus, this was also the period of time in which he developed his penchant for humor and satire. He graduated from Sunset High in 1978.

Sacco earned his BA in journalism from the University of Oregon in 1981 in three years. He was greatly frustrated with the journalist work that he found at the time, later saying, &quot;[I couldn&#x27;t find] a job writing very hard-hitting, interesting pieces that would really make some sort of difference.&quot; After being briefly employed by the journal of the National Notary Association, a job which he found &quot;exceedingly, exceedingly boring,&quot; and several factories, he returned to Malta, his journalist hopes forgotten. &quot;...I sort of decided to forget it and just go the other route, which was basically take my hobby, which has been cartooning, and see if I could make a living out of that,&quot; he later told the BBC.

He began working for a local publisher writing guidebooks. Returning to his fondness for comics, he wrote a Maltese romance comic named &quot;Imħabba Vera&quot; (&quot;True Love&quot;), one of the first art-comics in the Maltese language. &quot;Because Malta has no history of comics, comics weren&#x27;t considered something for kids,&quot; he told &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. &quot;In one case, for example, the girl got pregnant and she went to Holland for an abortion. Malta is a Catholic country where, at the time, not even divorce was allowed. It was unusual, but it&#x27;s not like anyone raised a stink about it, because they had no way of judging whether this was appropriate material for comics or not.&quot;

Eventually returning to the United States, by 1985 Sacco had founded a satirical, alternative comics magazine called &quot;Portland Permanent Press&quot; in Portland, Oregon. When the magazine folded fifteen months later, he took a job at &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; as the staff news writer. This job provided the opportunity for him to create and edit another satire: the comics anthology &quot;Centrifugal Bumble-Puppy&quot; (a name he took from an overcomplicated children&#x27;s toy in Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot;), published by &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;″s parent company Fantagraphics Books.
But Sacco was more interested in traveling. In 1988, he left the U.S. again to travel across Europe, a trip which he chronicled in his autobiographical comic &quot;Yahoo&quot; (also published by Fantagraphics). The trip led him towards the ongoing Gulf War (his obsession with which he talks about in &quot;Yahoo&quot; #2), and in 1991 he found himself nearby to research the work he would eventually publish as &quot;Palestine&quot;, a documentary graphic novel, which gathers testimonies of survivors of war and trauma.

The Gulf War segment of &quot;Yahoo&quot; drew Sacco into a study of Middle Eastern politics, and he traveled to the Occupied Palestinian territories to research his first long work. &quot;Palestine&quot; came about as a landmark of journalism and the art form of comics. It was based on several months of research and an extended visit to the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the early 1990s. &quot;Palestine&quot; is a major work of political and historical nonfiction and is described as an essential reading. &quot;Palestine&quot; won the American Book Award in 1996 and sold more than 30,000 copies in the UK.

Sacco next travelled to Sarajevo and Goražde near the end of the Bosnian War, and produced a series of reports in the same style as &quot;Palestine&quot;: the comics &quot;Safe Area Goražde&quot;, &quot;The Fixer&quot;, and the stories collected in &quot;War&#x27;s End&quot;; the financing for which was aided by his winning of the Guggenheim Fellowship in April 2001. &quot;Safe Area Goražde&quot; won the Eisner Award for Best Original Graphic Novel in 2001.
He has also contributed short pieces of graphic reportage to a variety of magazines, on subjects ranging from war crimes to blues, and was a frequent illustrator of Harvey Pekar&#x27;s &quot;American Splendor&quot;. In 2005 he wrote and drew two eight-page comics depicting events in Iraq published in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. He also contributed a 16-page piece in April 2007&#x27;s issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, entitled &quot;Down! Up! You&#x27;re in the Iraqi Army Now&quot;. In 2009, his &quot;Footnotes in Gaza&quot; was published, which investigates two forgotten massacres that took place in Khan Younis and Rafah in November 1956. In June 2012, a book on poverty in the United States, &quot;Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt&quot;, co-written with journalist Chris Hedges, was published. His latest work is &quot;Paying the Land&quot; (2020) discussing climate change and the indigenous Dene community of Northwest Canada, who, he says, were subject to cultural genocide by means of compulsory residential schooling, treaties, and capitalism.

Sacco currently lives in Portland, Oregon.

==Awards==
In addition to his 1996 American Book Award, and 2001 Guggenheim Fellowship, Sacco&#x27;s &quot;Safe Area Goražde&quot; brought him a Time magazine &quot;Best Comic of 2000&quot; award, followed by the 2001 Eisner Award for Best Original Graphic Novel, and 2001 Eagle Award for Best Original Graphic Novel, and 2001 Harvey Award nomination for Best Writer and Best Graphic Album of Original Work.

The &quot;Palestine&quot; collection won the 2002 Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Outstanding Graphic Novel.

His &quot;Footnotes in Gaza&quot; was nominated for the 2009 Los Angeles Times&quot; Book Prize Graphic Novel award. It received the 2010 Ridenhour Book Prize and the 2012 Oregon Book Award. In 2014, his graphic novel collection &quot;Journalism&quot; received the Pacific Northwest College of Art Graphic Literature Award in 2014 from the Oregon Book Awards.

Joe Sacco was awarded the degree of Doctor of Literature (Honoris Causa) by the University of Malta on November 17, 2023.

<text>George Parker, 2nd Earl of Macclesfield, FRS (c. 1697 17 March 1764) was an English peer and astronomer.

==Biography==
George was tutored by Welsh mathematician William Jones, who went on to become the first person to use the symbol (the Greek letter &quot;Pi&quot;) to represent the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

Styled Viscount Parker from 1721 to 1732, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Wallingford from 1722 to 1727, but his interests were not in politics. In 1722, he became a fellow of the Royal Society, and he spent most of his time in astronomical observations at his Oxfordshire seat, Shirburn Castle, which had been bought by his father in 1716; here he built an observatory and a chemical laboratory.

He was very prominent in making the case in Parliament for the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750, with which the Kingdom of Great Britain and the British Empire changed from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar in 1752.

When his son ran for parliament as a Whig in 1754, his role in the calendar reform was one of many issues raised by the son&#x27;s Tory opponents; one of Hogarth&#x27;s satirical series of paintings about these elections (1755) is the only source for the subsequent &quot;Give us our eleven days&quot; myth.

From 1752 until his death, Macclesfield was president of the Royal Society, and he made some observations on the great 1755 Lisbon earthquake.

In 1750, Macclesfield was offered the honorary position of vice president of the Foundling Hospital, which he accepted and kept until his death in 1764. The Foundling Hospital was a charitable institution created a decade earlier, dedicated to saving London&#x27;s abandoned children. The Earl seems to have taken his position seriously, as he commissioned the artist Benjamin Wilson to paint a full-size portrait of him, which he then donated to the hospital. The portrait is still in the Foundling Hospital Collection and available to view at the Foundling Museum.

In 1755, Parker was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He also was a corresponding member of the Académie des sciences.

==Family==
George Parker was born in about 1697 to Thomas Parker, 1st Earl of Macclesfield and his wife Janet née Carrier. George Parker married twice.
Firstly, on 18 September 1722 to Mary Lane daughter of Ralph Lane, Turkey merchant, of Woodbury; with issue:
* Thomas Parker, 3rd Earl of Macclesfield
* Hon. George Lane Parker
Secondly, on 20 December 1757 at St James Westminster, to Dorothy Nesbitt, with no known issue

<doc id="567470" wikidata="Q155506" url="?curid=567470" title="Emily Stowe">
<text>Emily Howard Stowe (; May 1, 1831 – April 30, 1903) was a Canadian physician who was the first female physician to practise in Canada, the second licensed female physician in Canada and an activist for women&#x27;s rights and suffrage. Stowe helped found the women&#x27;s suffrage movement in Canada and campaigned for the country&#x27;s first medical college for women.

==Early life==
Emily Howard Jennings was born in Norwich Township, Oxford County, Ontario, as one of six daughters of farmers Hannah Howard and Solomon Jennings. While Solomon converted to Methodism, Hannah (who had been educated at a Quaker seminary in the United States) raised her daughters as Quakers in a community that encouraged women to participate and receive an education. She home-schooled Stowe and her five sisters and taught them skills in herbal healing. After teaching at local schools for seven years, her public struggle to achieve equality for women began in 1852, when she applied for admission to Victoria College, Cobourg, Ontario. Refused on the grounds that she was female, she applied to the Normal School for Upper Canada, which Egerton Ryerson had recently founded in Toronto. She entered in November 1853 and was graduated with first-class honours in 1854. Hired as principal of a Brantford, Ontario public school, she was the first woman to be a principal of a public school in Upper Canada. She taught there until her marriage in 1856 (see Marriage bar).

She married John Fiuscia Michael Heward Stowe in 1856. In the next seven years she had three children: two sons and a daughter. Shortly after the birth of their third child, her husband developed tuberculosis, which led her to take a renewed interest in medicine. Having had experience with herbal remedies and homeopathic medicine since the 1840s, Emily Stowe left teaching and decided to become a doctor.

==Medical career==
Stowe was denied entrance into the Toronto School of Medicine in 1865 and was told by its Vice Principal, &quot;The doors of the University are not open to women and I trust they never will be.&quot; Unable to study medicine in Canada, Emily Stowe earned her degree in the United States from the homeopathic New York Medical College for Women in 1867. The same year, she returned to Canada and opened a medical practice in Toronto, on Richmond Street, that specialized in treating women and children. Stowe gained some local prominence through public lectures on women&#x27;s health and maintained a steady clientele through newspaper advertisements.

In the mid-1860s, Canada&#x27;s medical licensing system began requiring homeopathic doctors and doctors trained in the United States to obtain licences by taking more courses and an examination. In 1869, Stowe&#x27;s application to the University of Toronto for chemistry and physiology courses was denied. In 1870, the president of the Toronto School of Medicine, Dr. William Thomas Aikins, granted special permission to Stowe and fellow student Jennie Kidd Trout to attend classes, a requirement for medical practitioners with foreign licences. Faced with hostility from both the male faculty and students, Stowe refused to take the oral and written exams and left the school.

In 1879, one of Stowe&#x27;s patients, a nineteen-year old Sarah Lovell, died, and Stowe was charged with providing an abortion to her patient. Stowe testified that she had prescribed Lovell a one thirtieth of the full dose of drug that could cause a miscarriage, an amount too small to cause a miscarriage. Many members and male leaders of the Toronto medical community came to her defence. Though the coroner&#x27;s jury ruled that Lovell had poisoned herself, Stowe was charged with performing a medical abortion. Stowe was acquitted after a short trial during which she gained public support.

The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario granted Stowe a licence to practise medicine on July 16, 1880, based on her experience since 1850, Dr. Aikins&#x27; willingness to testify for her, and her earlier apprenticeship to Dr. Joseph J. Lancaster. This licence made Stowe the second female licensed physician in Canada, after Trout.

On June 13, 1883, Dr. Emily Stowe, a suffragist and first woman physician to practice medicine in Canada, led a group of supporters to a meeting at the Toronto Women&#x27;s Suffrage Club where the group tabled a resolution stating &quot;that medical education for women is a recognized necessity, and consequently facilities for such instruction should be provided.&quot;

Her daughter, Augusta Stowe-Gullen, was the first woman to earn a medical degree in Canada.

==Women&#x27;s rights==

While studying medicine in New York, Stowe met with Susan B. Anthony and witnessed the divisions within the American women&#x27;s suffrage movement. Stowe also attended a women&#x27;s club meeting in Cleveland, Ohio. Stowe adopted a gradualist strategy which she brought back to her work in Canada.

In 1876, Stowe founded the Toronto Women&#x27;s Literary Club, renamed the Canadian Women&#x27;s Suffrage Association in 1883. This has led some to consider Stowe the mother of the suffrage movement in Canada. The Literary Club campaigned for improved working conditions for women and pressured schools in Toronto to accept women into higher education. In 1883, a public meeting of the Suffrage Association led to the formation of the Ontario Medical College for Women, the country&#x27;s first women&#x27;s medical school. When the Dominion Women&#x27;s Enfranchisement Association was founded in 1889, Stowe became its first president and remained president until her death.

As is true for many suffragists, a tension existed between Stowe&#x27;s commitment to fellow women and class loyalty. In an episode that may demonstrate the dominance of the latter, Stowe broke the bond of doctor-patient confidentiality by disclosing the abortion request of a patient, Sara Ann Lovell, a domestic servant, to her employer. (See Abortion trial of Emily Stowe.) Stowe, however, sharply criticized the National Policy economic program in 1892. She believed that it would not help working-class Canadians and was instead a corrupt deal on behalf of major businesses.

After breaking her hip at the Columbian Exposition&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Congress in 1893, Stowe retired from medicine. In 1896, Emily and her daughter Augusta participated in an all-female &quot;mock parliament,&quot; in which the women considered a petition from a male delegation for the right to vote. Stowe, as the Attorney General, used the same arguments that the Canadian Parliament had levelled against female suffragists and denied the petition. Stowe died in 1903, fourteen years before Canadian women were granted the right to vote.

==Personal life==

While she counted herself a Quaker until 1879, she became a Unitarian in 1879 and attended the First Unitarian Congregation of Toronto.

==Legacy==
Stowe was the first female public-school principal in Ontario, the first female physician to practice medicine in Canada and a lifelong champion of women&#x27;s rights who helped to found the Canadian Women&#x27;s Suffrage Association.

Public elementary schools in her hometown of Norwich Township (Emily Stowe Public School) as well as Courtice, Ontario are named after her. A women&#x27;s shelter in Toronto, Canada, is named after her. In 2018, she was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame.
