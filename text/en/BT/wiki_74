<text>The Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6 is a turboprop aircraft engine produced by Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada.

Its design was started in 1958, it first ran in February 1960, first flew on 30 May 1961, entered service in 1964, and has been continuously updated since.

The PT6 consists of two basic sections: a gas generator with accessory gearbox, and a free-power turbine with reduction gearbox. In aircraft, the engine is often mounted &quot;backwards,&quot; with the intake at the rear and the exhaust at the front, so that the turbine is directly connected to the propeller.

Many variants of the PT6 have been produced, not only as turboprops but also as turboshaft engines for helicopters, land vehicles, hovercraft, and boats; as auxiliary power units; and for industrial uses. By November 2015, 51,000 had been produced, which had logged 400 million flight hours from 1963 to 2016. It is known for its reliability, with an in-flight shutdown rate of 1 per 651,126 hours in 2016.

The PT6A turboprop engine covers the power range between , while the PT6B/C are turboshaft variants for helicopters.

== Development==

In 1956, Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada&#x27;s (PWC) president, Ronald Riley, ordered engineering manager Dick Guthrie to hire a team of gas turbine specialists to design a small gas turbine engine. Demand for the Wasp radial engine was still strong and its production was profitable but the aim was to become Canada&#x27;s prime engine company by focusing on a small gas turbine engine. Riley gave Guthrie a modest budget of C$100,000. Guthrie recruited twelve engineers with experience gained at various places including the National Research Council in Ottawa, Orenda Engines in Ontario, Bristol Aero Engines and Blackburn Aircraft. They completed the detailed design of an engine for Canadair&#x27;s small jet trainer, the CL-41. It was a thrust turbojet but the design was taken over by P&amp;WA who developed it into the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT12. The team had to wait for market assessments to define their next engine, a turboprop for twin-engined aircraft, the PT6. The early development of the PT6, which first ran in December 1963, was beset with engineering problems, cost overruns and lack of sales. It was almost cancelled. The team lacked the ability to deal with the technical difficulties, i.e. how to develop the engine, because, as one of the team Elvie Smith recalled, they came from research and design backgrounds. They learned how to run a development program, such as testing around the clock rather than on one shift, from a PWA team which directed the development for several months.

The PT6 first flew on 30 May 1961, mounted as a third engine in the nose of a Beech 18 aircraft which had been converted by de Havilland at its Downsview facility in North York, Ontario. Full-scale production started in 1963, with service entry the following year. The Beech 18 continued as a PT6 and propeller flying test-bed until it was replaced with a Beech King Air in 1980. The King Air test-engine or propeller replaced one of the standard ones. In 1974 the Beech 18 had been unable to fly fast enough and high enough to test the PT6A-50 for the de Havilland Canada Dash 7 so a Vickers Viscount was modified as a PT6 test-bed with a Dash-7 installation in the nose.

The first production PT6 model, the PT6A-6, was certificated in December 1963. The first application was the Beech Queen Air, enticing the U.S. Army to buy a fleet of the U-21 Ute variant. This helped launch the King Air with Beechcraft selling about 7,000 by 2012. 
From 1963 to 2016 power-to-weight ratio was improved by 50%, brake specific fuel consumption by 20% and overall pressure ratio reached 14:1.
Its development continues and while today its basic configuration is the same as in 1964, updates have included a cooled first-stage turbine vane, additional compressor and turbine stages and single-crystal turbine blades in the early 1990s. Its pressure ratio is 13:1 in the AgustaWestland AW609 tiltrotor, the highest that can be used without cooled turbine blades.

In response to the General Electric GE93, in 2017 Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada started testing core technology and systems for a proposed engine to replace the most powerful versions of the PT6.
It was considered likely to be a development of the PT6C core, and would fit between the PT6C-67C/E and the PW100 family. It was expected to be ready to launch by the end of 2017 for an initial helicopter platform with a 10-15% reduction in brake specific fuel consumption.
This 2,000 hp engine would target a possible new market such as a Super PC-12, a more powerful TBM, or a bigger King Air.

=== PW100 ===
When de Havilland Canada asked for a much larger engine for the DHC-8, roughly twice the power of the Large PT6, Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada responded with a new design initially known as the PT7, later renamed Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW100.

==Design==
The rate at which parts deteriorate in a gas turbine is unbalanced insofar as the hottest parts need replacing or repairing more often than the cooler-running parts. If the hotter parts can be removed without disturbing the rest of the engine, for example without removing the complete engine from the aircraft, maintenance costs are reduced. It was achieved with the PT6 by having the hottest parts, the gas generator turbine and combustor, at the propeller end. They are removed without disturbing the rest of the engine with its connections to the aircraft. This arrangement was patented by designer Newland, one of the original PT6 team. A similar general arrangement with a free-turbine power take-off at the exhaust end (the P.181 engine) had been shown by Armstrong Siddeley Motors at the Farnborough Airshow in 1957.

An early design improvement, incorporated in the PT6A-20, was the pipe diffuser patented by Vrana, another of the original PT6 team. It replaced the vaned type diffuser used in centrifugal compressors. The pipe diffuser became standard design practice for P&amp;WC. Another design change improved the part-speed functioning of the compressor. It is common to bleed air from a compressor to make it work properly at low engine speeds. The PT6 has a bleed arrangement which reuses the bleed air by returning it in a tangential direction at the entry to the compressor, an idea patented by Schaum et al. and titled &quot;Turbine Engine With Induced Pre-Swirl at Compressor Inlet&quot;. It acts like a variable vane and is known as a &quot;Jet-Flap&quot;.

All versions of the engine consist of two sections that can be easily separated for maintenance: a gas generator supplies hot pressurized gas to a free power turbine. The starter has to accelerate only the gas generator, making the engine easy to start, particularly in cold weather. Air enters the gas-generator through an inlet screen into the low-pressure axial compressor. This has three stages on small and medium versions of the engine and four stages on large versions. The air then flows into a single-stage centrifugal compressor, through a folded annular combustion chamber, and finally through a single-stage turbine that powers the compressors at about 45,000 rpm. Hot gas from the gas generator flows into the power turbine, which turns at about 30,000 rpm. It has one stage on the small engines and two stages on the medium and large ones. For turboprop use, this powers a two-stage planetary output reduction gearbox, which turns the propeller at a speed of 1,900 to 2,200 rpm. The exhaust gas then escapes through two side-mounted ducts in the power turbine housing. The turbines are concentric with the combustion chamber, reducing overall length.

In most aircraft installations the PT6 is mounted so that the intake end of the engine is towards the rear of the aircraft, leading to it being known by many as the &quot;back-to-front&quot; engine. This places the power section at the front of the nacelle, where it can drive the propeller directly without the need for a long shaft. Intake air is usually fed to the engine via an underside mounted duct, and the two exhaust outlets are directed rearward. This arrangement aids maintenance by allowing the entire power section to be removed along with the propeller, exposing the gas-generator section. To facilitate rough-field operations, foreign objects are diverted from the compressor intake by inertial separators in the inlet. In some installation such as the PT6A-66B version in the Piaggio P.180 Avanti, the engine is reversed, with the propeller acting as a &quot;pusher&quot;, the accessory gearbox facing the front of the aircraft.

==Operational history==
By the 40th anniversary of its maiden flight in 2001, over 36,000 PT6As had been delivered, not including the other versions.
Up to October 2003, 31,606 delivered engines have flown more than 252 million hours.
Till November 2015, 51,000 have been produced.
The family logged 400 million flight hours from 1963 to 2016.
The PT6 family is known for its reliability with an in-flight shutdown rate of 1 per 333,333 hours up to October 2003,
1 per 127,560 hours in 2005 in Canada,
1 per 333,000 hours from 1963 to 2016,
1 per 651,126 hours over 12 months in 2016. Time between overhauls is between 3,600 and 9,000 hours and hot-section inspections between 1,800 and 2,000 hours.

Early PT6 versions lacked a FADEC, autothrottle could be installed as an aftermarket upgrade with an actuator, initially for single-engine aircraft like the PC-12 and potentially in twin-turboprop aircraft.
In October 2019 the PT6 E-Series was launched on the PC-12 NGX, the first general aviation turboprop with an electronic propeller and engine control system with a single lever and better monitoring for longer maintenance intervals, increased from 300 to 600 hours, and a TBO increased by 43% to 5,000 hours, reducing engine operating costs by at least 15%.
In April 2022, Daher announced that the updated SOCATA TBM-960 would be powered by the PT6E-66XT.

==Variants==

The main variant, the PT6A, is available in a wide variety of models, covering the power range between in the original series, and up to in the &#x27;large&#x27; lines. The PT6B and PT6C are turboshaft variants for helicopters. In US military use, they are designated as T74 or T101.

Several other versions of the PT6 have appeared over time:
*the Large PT6 added an extra axial compressor stage(4), and another power turbine stage(2) and a deeper output reduction, producing almost twice the power output, between .
*the Medium PT6 added another power turbine stage(2) -41 thru the -60 engines 
*the PT6B is a helicopter turboshaft model, featuring an offset reduction gearbox with a freewheeling clutch and power turbine governor, producing at 4,500 rpm.
*the PT6C is a helicopter model, with a single side-mounted exhaust, producing at 30,000 rpm, which is stepped down in a user-supplied gearbox.
*the PT6E is a large PT6A derivative equipped with digital engine control.
*the PT6T Twin-Pac consists of two PT6 engines driving a common-output reduction gearbox, producing almost at 6,000 rpm.
*the ST6 is a version intended for stationary applications, originally developed for the UAC TurboTrain, and now widely used as auxiliary power units on large aircraft, as well as many other roles.

<doc id="578753" wikidata="Q1937853" url="?curid=578753" title="Pollard's p − 1 algorithm">
<text>Pollard&#x27;s &quot;p&quot; − 1 algorithm is a number theoretic integer factorization algorithm, invented by John Pollard in 1974. It is a special-purpose algorithm, meaning that it is only suitable for integers with specific types of factors; it is the simplest example of an algebraic-group factorisation algorithm.

The factors it finds are ones for which the number preceding the factor, &quot;p&quot; − 1, is powersmooth; the essential observation is that, by working in the multiplicative group modulo a composite number &quot;N&quot;, we are also working in the multiplicative groups modulo all of &quot;N&quot;&#x27;s factors.

The existence of this algorithm leads to the concept of safe primes, being primes for which &quot;p&quot; − 1 is two times a Sophie Germain prime &quot;q&quot; and thus minimally smooth. These primes are sometimes construed as &quot;safe for cryptographic purposes&quot;, but they might be &quot;unsafe&quot; — in current recommendations for cryptographic strong primes (&quot;e.g.&quot; ANSI X9.31), it is necessary but not sufficient that &quot;p&quot; − 1 has at least one large prime factor. Most sufficiently large primes are strong; if a prime used for cryptographic purposes turns out to be non-strong, it is much more likely to be through malice than through an accident of random number generation. This terminology is considered obsolete by the cryptography industry: the ECM factorization method is more efficient than Pollard&#x27;s algorithm and finds safe prime factors just as quickly as it finds non-safe prime factors of similar size, thus the size of &quot;p&quot; is the key security parameter, not the smoothness of &quot;p-1&quot;.

==Base concepts==
Let &quot;n&quot; be a composite integer with prime factor &quot;p&quot;. By Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, we know that for all integers &quot;a&quot; coprime to &quot;p&quot; and for all positive integers &quot;K&quot;:

:formula_1

If a number &quot;x&quot; is congruent to 1 modulo a factor of &quot;n&quot;, then the will be divisible by that factor.

The idea is to make the exponent a large multiple of &quot;p&quot; − 1 by making it a number with very many prime factors; generally, we take the product of all prime powers less than some limit &quot;B&quot;. Start with a random &quot;x&quot;, and repeatedly replace it by formula_2 as &quot;w&quot; runs through those prime powers. Check at each stage, or once at the end if you prefer, whether is not equal to 1.

==Multiple factors==

It is possible that for all the prime factors &quot;p&quot; of &quot;n&quot;, &quot;p&quot; − 1 is divisible by small primes, at which point the Pollard &quot;p&quot; − 1 algorithm simply returns &quot;n&quot;.

==Algorithm and running time==
The basic algorithm can be written as follows:

:Inputs: &quot;n&quot;: a composite number
:Output: a nontrivial factor of &quot;n&quot; or failure

:# select a smoothness bound &quot;B&quot;
:# define formula_3 (note: explicitly evaluating &quot;M&quot; may not be necessary)
:# randomly pick a positive integer, &quot;a&quot;, which is coprime to &quot;n&quot; (note: we can actually fix &quot;a&quot;, e.g. if &quot;n&quot; is odd, then we can always select &quot;a&quot; = 2, random selection here is not imperative)
:# compute (note: exponentiation can be done modulo &quot;n&quot;)
:# if then return &quot;g&quot;
:# if then select a larger &quot;B&quot; and go to step 2 or return failure
:# if then select a smaller &quot;B&quot; and go to step 2 or return failure

If in step 6, this indicates there are no prime factors &quot;p&quot; for which &quot;p-1&quot; is &quot;B&quot;-powersmooth. If in step 7, this usually indicates that all factors were &quot;B&quot;-powersmooth, but in rare cases it could indicate that &quot;a&quot; had a small order modulo &quot;n&quot;. Additionally, when the maximum prime factors of &quot;p-1&quot; for each prime factors &quot;p&quot; of &quot;n&quot; are all the same in some rare cases, this algorithm will fail.

The running time of this algorithm is ; larger values of &quot;B&quot; make it run slower, but are more likely to produce a factor.

=== Example ===

If we want to factor the number &quot;n&quot; = 299.
:# We select &quot;B&quot; = 5.
:# Thus &quot;M&quot; = 22 × 31 × 51.
:# We select &quot;a&quot; = 2.
:# &quot;g&quot; = gcd(&quot;a&quot;&quot;M&quot; − 1, &quot;n&quot;) = 13.
:# Since 1 &lt; 13 &lt; 299, thus return 13.
:# 299 / 13 = 23 is prime, thus it is fully factored: 299 = 13 × 23.

==Methods of choosing &quot;B&quot;==

Since the algorithm is incremental, it is able to keep running with the bound constantly increasing.

Assume that &quot;p&quot; − 1, where &quot;p&quot; is the smallest prime factor of &quot;n&quot;, can be modelled as a random number of size less than . By the Dickman function, the probability that the largest factor of such a number is less than (&quot;p&quot; − 1)&quot;1/ε&quot; is roughly &quot;ε&quot;−&quot;ε&quot;; so there is a probability of about 3−3 = 1/27 that a &quot;B&quot; value of &quot;n&quot;1/6 will yield a factorisation.

In practice, the elliptic curve method is faster than the Pollard &quot;p&quot; − 1 method once the factors are at all large; running the &quot;p&quot; − 1 method up to &quot;B&quot; = 232 will find a quarter of all 64-bit factors and 1/27 of all 96-bit factors.

==Two-stage variant==
A variant of the basic algorithm is sometimes used; instead of requiring that &quot;p&quot; − 1 has all its factors less than &quot;B&quot;, we require it to have all but one of its factors less than some &quot;B&quot;1, and the remaining factor less than some . After completing the first stage, which is the same as the basic algorithm, instead of computing a new

:formula_4

for &quot;B&quot;2 and checking , we compute

:formula_5

where and check if produces a nontrivial factor of &quot;n&quot;. As before, exponentiations can be done modulo &quot;n&quot;.

Let {&quot;q&quot;1, &quot;q&quot;2, …} be successive prime numbers in the interval and &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot; = &quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot; − &quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 the difference between consecutive prime numbers. Since typically , are even numbers. The distribution of prime numbers is such that the &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot; will all be relatively small. It is suggested that . Hence, the values of , , , … (mod &quot;n&quot;) can be stored in a table, and be computed from , saving the need for exponentiations.

==Implementations==

* The GMP-ECM package includes an efficient implementation of the &quot;p&quot; − 1 method.
* Prime95 and MPrime, the official clients of the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search, use a modified version of the p - 1 algorithm to eliminate potential candidates.

<text>The Blue Coat School is a co education Church of England academy for 11- to 18-year-olds, located in the town of Oldham, Greater Manchester, England.

The school caters for pupils aged 11–18, offering A-level and GCSE courses. It is one of the few schools in the country to hold Leading Edge Partnership programme and &quot;science college&quot; status. Prior to becoming leading edge, Blue Coat had been a beacon school. This means the school has social responsibility to help develop other secondary schools in the area, as well as themselves.

The motto of the school is from the Latin: &quot;Semper Quaereamus Virtutem&quot; – &quot;Let us always seek virtue&quot;.

==History==

Thomas Henshaw, who died in 1810, left the sum of £40,000 (£ as of ) for the endowment of the Blue Coat School. The estate was tied up in litigation for many years but was eventually released. As no provision had been made for the cost of the building, a public meeting was held in Oldham in September 1825, when offers of land were received, and a public appeal was launched for funds to build the school. From the design of the architect Richard Lane, a start was made in 1829 when the foundation stone was laid, and the school was opened in 1834. Throughout the remainder of the 19th century, the school continued to maintain and instruct between 100 and 130 boys.

In July 1952, the trustees decided that, as the number of boarders in residence was gradually decreasing, Blue Coat should be closed as a residential school and the building converted for use as a secondary modern day school. This plan was effected, and the school became co-educational accommodating approximately 400 students.

The Oldham Henshaw and Church of England Educational Trust, constituted in 1950, had as one of its aims the building and maintenance of new secondary schools, and one of its objectives was to provide a &quot;Special Agreement&quot; secondary school by extending and reorganising the Blue Coat into a comprehensive school. This plan was realised in September 1966 when the Blue Coat School became fully comprehensive. It is now a nine form entry voluntary aided comprehensive school admitting 218 boys and girls each year, with a sixth form, the majority of whom go on to Higher Education. Voluntary aided status means that the governors of the school are responsible for the upkeep of all buildings and have to rely on the financial support and generosity of parents and friends of the school.

==Current information==
Recent government grants have enabled the school to venture into a multimillion-pound building scheme. So far additions have been a wheelchair lift to increase disabled access; and the reconstruction and further reconstruction of the school&#x27;s main entrance. In 1994 the school completed a major fund-raising campaign, enabling it to build a new science department building, which was completed in 1995. Completed in 2005, the new multimillion-pound sports hall opened on the east side of the school grounds, and due to this increase in PE space, the school has converted the old girls&#x27; gym into the new whole-school restaurant, also this building was extended with a second floor mezzanine for the 6th form students. With the whole school catered for in the restaurant, the house block which contained the old canteens was closed down. This has now been turned from a dated 1960s 6 classroom building into a 12 classroom 21st century building now housing year 7, 8 &amp; 9 rather than the 3 houses.
Also, the building near the entrance gates has been refurbished and had structural work done, forming a new building for more music activities, such as those who have music lessons (vocal, strings, brass and more) to improve musical abilities.

The Blue Coat school serves a broad catchment area, providing an education for those who live in the areas of Oldham, Manchester, Tameside and Rochdale. Physically, the school is located within easy walking distance of Oldham Town Centre. Currently, there are around 1100 pupils in the main school, with an additional 300 in the sixth form. There are also over 150 members of staff, teaching or otherwise.

During a school year, there are three communions (Christmas, Easter and end of year) and the assemblies during the school time have a strong Christian theme. Reflecting the strong Christian ethos of the school, Religious Studies continues to be compulsory taught subject for pupils at GCSE level.

As is the case in most English secondary schools, in years seven to nine, pupils study a broad range of subjects in Key Stage 3, before taking Standard Attainment Tests (SATs) in the core subjects of Mathematics, English and Science in year 9. These examinations test the competency of both the pupils&#x27; understanding of each subject as well as the standard of their teaching. Years ten and eleven Key Stage 4 involves work which leads to General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) qualifications. Pupils must take the core subjects of Mathematics, English (Language and Literature), Science (Double or Triple), and R.S (Religious Studies). In addition to these, pupils are given the option of four more subjects, one being a language and another being a Humanity, plus two extras which could be Drama Studies, Computer Science, Art (Fine Art, Photography or Textiles), Social Science, Child Development, Music, Physical Education, Business Studies, or one of several Design and Technology courses (Engineering, Product Design (both GCSE Design and Technology), Construction (Level 1/2 vocational course) or Food &amp; Nutrition). They will also choose a reserve subject, in case they cannot get in a class of one of the subjects or there isn&#x27;t enough people to make a class. The reserve subject will then replace this subject.

After finishing GCSEs, Pupils can choose to stay at the sixth form for years twelve and thirteen. Alternatively they could choose another sixth form college, such as Oldham Sixth Form College in Oldham or Ashton Sixth Form College in Ashton-under-Lyne. Should pupils stay on at Blue Coat in year 12, they will be required to choose 3 subjects to study for A-level and 1 for AS-Level. The school currently offers around 30 different and diverse courses. Students will have the option of keeping all of their subjects through A2, doing three A2-levels in year 13. The intensity of sixth-form is high, with a large amount of coursework expected in each subject, as well as exams at the end of each year. This is in-line with the narrower and more focused nature of the A-level qualifications. Having completed sixth form, students have several options. These include going to university, finding work or taking a gap year.

The most recent Ofsted inspection was in 2011. The school received an outstanding report overall, receiving an excellent rating for teaching in several areas and for management and leadership. The Blue Coat School has the most successful state Sixth Form Centre in the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, from A/AS Level Results in 2007. The school has traditionally excelled in the league tables under measures of absolute GCSE and A-Level attainment. However the achievement gap between Bluecoat and other local schools is less-stark under the new contextual value added measures of absolute educational progress, introduced by the UK government. In fact in 2008, Grange School in the town, achieved a higher level 2 CVA score than Blue Coat overall, despite having only a 28% GCSE pass rate compared with Bluecoat&#x27;s 81%. Although it is to be cautioned that small differences in overall CVA scores may not be statistically significant, it is still interesting that schools with such differing GCSE performance overall could have such similar CVA scores.

==Pastoral care==

Blue Coat School uses a &quot;house system&quot; for all students within the school. When students join the school they are allocated to one of three houses - &quot;Birley Hall&quot;, &quot;Lord Mothersill&quot; and &quot;Rountree Wrigley&quot; - all named after former governors at the school. Students whose elder family members have studied at the school are usually put within the same houses as those relatives; in some cases both parents and children have at different times been members of the same house.
There are nine &quot;forms&quot; in the School between years seven and eleven, and each house looks after three. The names of the forms are Birley, Hall, Birley Hall, Lord, Mothersill, Lord Mothersill, Rountree, Wrigley, and Rountree Wrigley, with their year number added onto the name of the form to get their exact form name e.g. Birley in year 7 is Birley 7, Rountree in year 11 is Rountree 11. In the sixth form, there are eight forms within each year.

Each house used to have a head and deputy, but despite still being allocated to houses, the students are now looked after in year groups. Each year group now has a Director of Learning. They look after pastoral care and discipline for students within that year. The school has House Coordinators to arrange and coordinate house events to ensure the school still retains its house system and to enable the students to retain their house identity.

The students have a fifteen-minute break after two one-hour lessons, and a 50-minute lunch break after a further two one-hour lessons, followed by assembly and a final one-hour lesson.

The Year Eleven and Sixth Form students are expected to offer guidance and leadership to students in the lower years of the School. Older students are more likely to take an active part in the houses&#x27; religious celebrations around Christmas and Easter.

The Sixth Form (Years 12 and 13) has an Assistant Head Teacher in overall charge supported by separate Heads of year. These take over the main pastoral responsibilities from the house heads for students within that year group. They also take on greater responsibilities for that year group such as preparing the student for external exams and guiding students on their future after leaving the School. With the help of the sixth form tutors, they also help to write the references for the students on application forms for higher education and jobs after leaving the school. Every year group has their own social facilities.

==Senior Students==
Since 2008, at the end of their lower 6th year (year 12), student&#x27;s in the sixth form are able to apply for a position as a senior student. These positions include the house captains as well as the head boy and head girl. They are responsible for taking a leading role in school life and representing the school at various community events. Senior students lead preparations for the Year 13 leavers prom, and also suggest charities the sixth form, subsequently decided through a ballet process, donate to. In 2008 this included the Head Boy Ryan Wan and Head Girl Olivia Price appearing on TV during The Royal British Legion&#x27;s &quot;Festival of Remembrance&quot;.

==Annual events==
* Founder&#x27;s Day - The commemoration of the school&#x27;s founder Thomas Henshaw. This is usually held towards the end of July and involves the school&#x27;s pupils parading in front of the residents of Oldham as they march down to the parish church. Here, there is a service which recognises the achievements of the founder, with a wreath laid at &quot;the Old Blues&#x27; Grave&quot;. The assembled school then proceeds back to the grounds of the school where a wreath is laid in front of Henshaw&#x27;s statue.
* Speech Night - Usually held on the second Friday in November, this recognises the achievements of pupils over the past academic year. Notable feature of the ceremony are the speech by the headteacher and the many awards given to pupils for the previous year&#x27;s work. Over previous years, the ceremony has taken place at Manchester Cathedral and Oldham&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Hall.
* Christmas Fayre - Until 2014 every year the student&#x27;s had a Christmas Fayre which occurred on the last academic day of the year and the pupils were encouraged to raise money for charity by paying to wear non-uniform, watch/take part in a talent show and buy items at the fayre itself. Over £6000 was raised in the one day benefiting 3 charities nominated by the pupils. There is also a staff pantomime.

==Admissions policy and criticism==
The area in Oldham where the school is based consists predominantly of the most-deprived areas in the North West. The school’s catchment area for pupil intake covers a broad geographical area, extending over much of Rochdale, Oldham, Greater Manchester and Tameside. Blue Coat’s policy, as a faith school, of religious selection for a portion of its pupils, means that children living in close proximity to the school, who apply to it, may not receive offers, with places assigned to students who live further away, but better meet the selection criteria.

Both Blue Coat and Crompton House CE School in Shaw have a consistent record of high achievement at GCSE and A-Level, in an area generally characterised by entrenched educational underachievement. Both have received criticism, unrelated to performance, for their former Christian-only admissions policies, which meant non-Anglican families were excluded from the two best schools in the Oldham area on religious grounds. This faith-based admissions policy proved controversial, and led to accusations that the predominantly white, Christian school was unrepresentative of the ethnic makeup of the local area. Approximately 25% of Oldham&#x27;s 250,000 strong population consists of Muslim families, the majority of which are originally of Pakistani and Bangladeshi extraction

These policies caused the school to be thrust uncomfortably into the glare and scrutiny of the media spotlight in the aftermath of the Oldham Riots, and the schools attracted criticism. The Liberal Democrat education spokesman Phil Willis cited Blue Coat as an example of a school which has only a few non-white pupils despite being in a predominantly ethnic-minority area. This erroneous statement was made even though he had never visited the area, which is in a predominantly white working class area. Consequently, both schools found themselves open to accusations of racism, and that they were helping to foster educational &quot;apartheid&quot; by helping to further perpetuate the high-levels of racial segregation in the town.

After 2008, major changes were made to the admissions policy, after which applications from any religion that is part of the UK Inter-Faith Network could be made for Year 7 pupils, opening the school up to applicants from Muslim, Sikh and Jewish faiths, along with non-Anglican Christian applicants. This document states that applications from members of these faiths will be judged using the same criteria as for Christian applicants.

The school&#x27;s admission policy has made it a target for critics of religious selection; Blue Coat has had this misfortune of located in an area that suffered from a race riot, which has led to a spotlight being focused on the school&#x27;s policies at a national level.

<doc id="578774" wikidata="Q333417" url="?curid=578774" title="Robert Hobart, 4th Earl of Buckinghamshire">
<text>Robert Hobart, 4th Earl of Buckinghamshire, (6 May 17604 February 1816), styled Lord Hobart from 1798 to 1804, was a British Tory politician.

==Life==
Buckinghamshire was born at Hampden House, the son of George Hobart, 3rd Earl of Buckinghamshire and Albinia, daughter of Lord Vere Bertie, younger son of Robert Bertie, 1st Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven. He was educated at Westminster School, London and later served in the American Revolutionary War.

===Political career===
Buckinghamshire was a Member of Parliament (MP) in the Irish House of Commons for Portarlington from 1784 to 1790 and thereafter for Armagh Borough from 1790 to 1797. He sat also in the British House of Commons for the rotten borough of Bramber in 1788, a seat he held until 1790, and then for Lincoln from 1790 to 1796. He acted as &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to successive Lord Lieutenants of Ireland from 1784 onwards, and from 1789 to 1793 he was chief secretary to the Lord Lieutenant, exerting his influence in this country to prevent any concessions to Roman Catholics.

In 1793 he was invested a member of the Privy Council, and appointed Governor of Madras. In 1798 he was recalled to England by the President of the Board of Control responsible for Indian affairs, Henry Dundas and summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Hobart. In the Lords, he favoured the union between England and Ireland. He was the leader of the House of Lords from March to October 1801. He later served as Secretary of State for War and the Colonies from 1801 to 1804 when it was said he had &quot;a better grasp of the local or colonial conditions, and a more active spirit than did some of his successors.&quot; He was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in 1805 and again in 1812, Postmaster General from 1806 to 1807 and President of the Board of Control, a post for which his time in India suited him, from 1812 to 1816. Hobart, the capital of Tasmania, is named after Lord Buckinghamshire.

===Family===

Lord Buckinghamshire married firstly in 1792 Margaretta (Margaret) Adderley (1766–1796), widow of Thomas Adderley (1712–91) and daughter of Edmund Bourke (Burke). She had three sons and a daughter with Adderley, 
more than 50 years her senior, whom she married at age 13.

He had two illegitimate children with Margaretta Adderley before they married:
*Charles John Robert Ellis (1786–1835), married Myra Ann Kinchant, daughter of Richard Kinchant
*Sir Henry Ellis (1788–1855)

They married in 1792.

*Lady Sarah (1793–1867), who married Prime Minister Lord Goderich and was the mother of George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon
* John Hobart (born 29 November 1795 in Madras), who died in infancy

After Margaretta&#x27;s death in 1796 in Madras, he married secondly the Hon. Eleanor Eden, daughter of William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland, in 1799. Two years earlier William Pitt the Younger had broken off what was generally believed to be an informal engagement to Eleanor. There were no children from this marriage. Lord Buckinghamshire died in February 1816 at the age of 55, after a fall from his horse. He was succeeded in the earldom by his nephew, George. Lady Buckinghamshire died in October 1851, aged 74.

<text>The Scottish Football League Premier Division was, from 1975 until 1998, the top division of the Scottish Football League and the entire Scottish football league system. It lay above the Scottish Football League First, Second and (from 1994) Third divisions.

==History==

===Background===
The Scottish Football League (SFL) was formed in 1890, initially with 12 clubs. More clubs joined the league soon afterwards, which was split into two divisions (Division One and Division Two) in 1893. A third division was added in 1923, but this lasted only three years before it collapsed under heavy financial losses. From 1926 until the Second World War, the SFL returned to two divisions. A third division, including some reserve teams, was added in 1949. The withdrawal of the reserve teams in 1955 saw a return to two divisions, with 37 clubs split almost evenly.

Following a decline in attendances in the early 1960s the SFL management committee wrote to its member clubs in early 1965 proposing change to a three division setup, with 14 clubs in the top flight. The committee proposed to allocate clubs to each division based on attendance, rather than league position at the end of the previous season, because previous proposals had failed due to uncertainty about where clubs would finish in a given season. This proposal failed to attract enough support, as did one made the following year for a 16 club top flight.

The dominance of Celtic in the late 1960s and early 1970s led to criticism that the league had become too predictable. Most of the major clubs, including Celtic, recorded drops in attendance in the 1972–73 season. In the summer of 1974, the clubs voted in favour of a three division setup, with 10 clubs in the top tier. It was decided to name the top flight as the &quot;Premier Division&quot; because many of the clubs had bad memories of the previous incarnations of Division Three, which had included reserve teams and had not lasted. The allocation of the clubs in the new divisions was determined by their league position in the 1974–75 season.

===Operation===
Initially, two clubs were relegated each season from a 10 club Premier Division. It was highly unlikely that either Celtic or Rangers would ever be involved in a relegation battle, given their historic dominance. This meant that the other eight clubs were at a very high risk of relegation each season. For example, in the first season of operation (1975–76), Dundee United and Aberdeen only avoided relegation on goal difference and Dundee did go down, for the first time since the 1930s. In the 1976–77 season, Hearts were relegated for the first time in their history.

The move to a three division system also had the effect of widening the gap in playing standards between the clubs. Writing in 1990, Bob Crampsey noted that of the 14 clubs in the 1975–76 Scottish Second Division, only one (Clydebank) had ever played in the Premier Division. Having narrowly avoided relegation from the Premier Division, Dundee United and Aberdeen gained most from the new setup, as they established an ascendancy over Rangers and Celtic in the early 1980s.

The high probability of relegation led to calls for a 12 club Premier Division, but there was insufficient support due to clubs either having to play each other three times or playing a 44-game schedule. The new setup did result in an increase in attendances, but the risk of relegation caused problems such as defensive playing styles, less young players developing and clubs were unable to plan for the long term. Aberdeen made those points in conjunction with a proposal to cut relegation to one club, but this did not attract enough support. A proposal by East Fife to revert to the old two division setup attracted nearly as much support as the Aberdeen plan.

A major change made in February 1981, that passed almost unnoticed at the time, was the abolition of gate sharing. This meant that clubs retained all of the revenue from their home attendances, and were able to vary the cost of admission for different opposing clubs.

===Formation of the SPL===
Before the start of the 1998–99 season, the clubs of the Premier Division resigned &quot;en masse&quot; to form the Scottish Premier League, following the example of English clubs who formed the FA Premier League in 1992. The Scottish Football League did not reform the Premier Division, instead leaving the league with just the First, Second and Third Divisions.

==Competition structure==
Initially and for most of its existence, the Premier Division had 10 clubs that played each other four times, giving a total of 36 games for each club in a season. There was initially two clubs automatically relegated from the Premier Division to the First Division each season.

From the 1994–95 season, a promotion and relegation two-match playoff was held each year between the second-from bottom in the Premier Division and the runner-up in the First Division. Three points for a win was also introduced in 1994.

<text>Mandaic, or more specifically Classical Mandaic, is the liturgical language of Mandaeism and a South Eastern Aramaic variety in use by the Mandaean community, traditionally based in southern parts of Iraq and southwest Iran, for their religious books. Mandaic, or Classical Mandaic, is still used by Mandaean priests in liturgical rites. The modern descendant of Mandaic or Classical Mandaic, known as Neo-Mandaic or Modern Mandaic, is spoken by a small group of Mandaeans around Ahvaz and Khorramshahr in the southern Iranian Khuzestan province.

Liturgical use of Mandaic or Classical Mandaic is found in Iran (particularly the southern portions of the country), in Baghdad, Iraq and in the diaspora (particularly in the United States, Sweden, Australia and Germany). It is an Eastern Aramaic language notable for its abundant use of vowel letters (&quot;mater lectionis&quot; with &quot;aleph&quot;, &quot;he&quot; only in final position, &quot;‘ayin&quot;, &quot;waw&quot;, &quot;yud&quot;) in writing, so-called &quot;plene&quot; spelling (Mandaic alphabet) and the amount of Iranian and Akkadian language influence on its lexicon, especially in the area of religious and mystical terminology. Mandaic is influenced by Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, Samaritan Aramaic, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, in addition to Akkadian and Parthian.

==Classification==
Classical Mandaic belongs to the Southeastern group of Aramaic and is closely related to the Jewish Babylonian Aramaic dialect in the major portions of the Babylonian Talmud, but less to the various dialects of Aramaic appearing in the incantation texts on unglazed ceramic bowls (incantation bowls) found mostly in central and south Iraq as well as the Khuzestan province of Iran. It is considered a sister language to the northeastern Aramaic dialect of Suret.

==Usage==
This southeastern Aramaic dialect is transmitted through religious, liturgical, and esoteric texts, most of them stored today in the Drower Collection, Bodleian Library (Oxford), the Bibliothèque Nationale (Paris), the British Library (London), and in the households of various Mandaeans as religious texts. More specific written objects and of linguistic importance on account of their early transmission (5th–7th centuries CE) are the earthenware incantation bowls and Mandaic lead rolls (amulets) (3rd–7th centuries CE), including silver and gold specimens that were often unearthed in archaeological excavations in the regions of their historical living sites between Wasiṭ and Baṣra, and frequently in central Iraq, for example (Bismaya, Kish, Khouabir, Kutha, Uruk, Nippur), north and south of the confluences of the Euphrates and Tigris (Abu Shudhr, al-Qurnah), and the adjacent province of Khuzistan (Hamadan). 

== Phonology ==
=== Consonants ===
* The glottal stop is said to have disappeared from Mandaic.
* and are said to be palatal stops, and are generally pronounced as and , but are transcribed as /, /, however; they may also be pronounced as velar stops [, ].
* and are noted as velar, but are generally pronounced as uvular and , however; they may also be pronounced as velar fricatives [, ].
* Sounds [, , ] only occur in Arabic and Persian loanwords.
* Both emphatic voiced sounds [, ] and pharyngeal sounds [, ] only occur in Arabic loanwords.

=== Vowels ===
* A short is often replaced by the short sound.

==Alphabet==
Mandaic is written in the Mandaic alphabet. It consists of 23 graphemes, with the last being a ligature. Its origin and development is still under debate. Graphemes appearing on incantation bowls and metal amulet rolls differ slightly from the late manuscript signs.

==Lexicography==
Lexicographers of the Mandaic language include Theodor Nöldeke, Mark Lidzbarski, Ethel S. Drower, Rudolf Macúch, and Matthew Morgenstern.

==Neo-Mandaic==
Neo-Mandaic represents the latest stage of the phonological and morphological development of Mandaic. Having developed in isolation from one another, most Neo-Aramaic dialects are mutually unintelligible and should therefore be considered separate languages. Determining the relationship between Neo-Aramaic dialects is difficult because of poor knowledge of the dialects themselves and their history.

Although no direct descendants of Jewish Babylonian Aramaic survive today, most of the Neo-Aramaic dialects spoken today belong to the Eastern sub-family of Jewish Babylonian Aramaic and Mandaic, among them Neo-Mandaic that can be described with any certainty as the direct descendant of one of the Aramaic dialects attested in Late Antiquity, probably Mandaic. Neo-Mandaic preserves a Semitic &quot;suffix&quot; conjugation (or perfect) that is lost in other dialects. The phonology of Neo-Mandaic is divergent from other Eastern Neo-Aramaic dialects.

Three dialects of Neo-Mandaic were native to Shushtar, Shah Vali, and Dezful in northern Khuzestan Province, Iran before the 1880s. During that time, Mandeans moved to Ahvaz and Khorramshahr to escape persecution. Khorramshahr had the most Neo-Mandaic speakers until the Iran–Iraq War caused many people to leave Iran. Ahvaz is the only community with a sizeable portion of Neo-Mandaic speakers in Iran as of 1993.

The following table compares a few words in Old Mandaic with three Neo-Mandaic dialects. The Iraq dialect, documented by E. S. Drower, is now extinct.

== Sample text ==
The following is a sample text in Mandaic of Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Mandaic: &quot;.&quot;

Transliteration: 

English original: &quot;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&quot;

<text>Photobiology is the scientific study of the beneficial and harmful interactions of light (technically, non-ionizing radiation) in living organisms. The field includes the study of photophysics, photochemistry, photosynthesis, photomorphogenesis, visual processing, circadian rhythms, photomovement, bioluminescence, and ultraviolet radiation effects.

The division between ionizing radiation and non-ionizing radiation is typically considered to be a photon energy greater than 10 eV, which approximately corresponds to both the first ionization energy of oxygen, and the ionization energy of hydrogen at about 14 eV.

When photons come into contact with molecules, these molecules can absorb the energy in photons and become excited. Then they can react with molecules around them and stimulate &quot;photochemical&quot; and &quot;photophysical&quot; changes of molecular structures.

== Photophysics ==
This area of Photobiology focuses on the physical interactions of light and matter. When molecules absorb photons that matches their energy requirements they promote a valence electron from a ground state to an excited state and they become a lot more reactive. This is an extremely fast process, but very important for different processes.

== Photochemistry ==
This area of Photobiology studies the reactivity of a molecule when it absorbs energy that comes from light. It also studies what happens with this energy, it could be given off as heat or fluorescence so the molecule goes back to ground state.

There are 3 basic laws of photochemistry:

1) First Law of Photochemistry: This law explains that in order for photochemistry to happen, light has to be absorbed.

2) Second Law of Photochemistry: This law explains that only one molecule will be activated by each photon that is absorbed.

3) Bunsen-Roscoe Law of Reciprocity: This law explains that the energy in the final products of a photochemical reaction will be directly proportional to the total energy that was initially absorbed by the system.

== Plant Photobiology ==
Plant growth and development is highly dependent on light. Photosynthesis is one of the most important biochemical processes for life on earth and its possible only due to the ability of plants to use energy from photons and convert it into molecules such as NADPH and ATP, to then fix carbon dioxide and make it into sugars that plants can use for their growth and development. But photosynthesis is not the only plant process driven by light, other processes such as photomorphology and plant photoperiod are extremely important for regulation of vegetative and reproductive growth as well as production of plant secondary metabolites.

=== Photosynthesis ===
Photosynthesis is defined as a series of biochemical reactions that phototrophic cells perform to transform light energy to chemical energy and store it in carbon-carbon bonds of carbohydrates. As it is widely known, this process happens inside of the chloroplast of photosynthetic plant cells where light absorbing pigments can be found embedded in the membranes of structures called thylakoids. There are 2 main pigments present in the Photosystems of higher plants: chlorophyll (a or b) and carotenes. These pigments are organized to maximize the light reception and transfer, and they absorb specific wavelengths to broaden the amount of light that can be captured and used for photo-redox reactions.

==== Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) ====
Due to the limited amount of pigments in plant photosynthetic cells, there is a limited range of wavelengths that plants can use to perform photosynthesis. This range is called &quot;Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR)&quot;. This range is interestingly almost the same as the human visible spectrum and it extends in wavelengths from approximately 400-700 nm. PAR is measured in μmol s−1m−2 and it measures the rate and intensity of radiant light in terms of micro-moles per unit of surface area and time that plants can use for photosynthesis.

==== Photobiologically Active Radiation (PBAR) ====
Photobiologically Active Radiation (PBAR) is a range of light energy beyond and including PAR. Photobiological Photon Flux (PBF) is the metric used to measure PBAR.

=== Photomorphogenesis ===
This process refers to the development of the morphology of plants which is light-mediated and controlled by 5 distinct photoreceptors: UVR8, Cryptochrome, Phototropin, Phytochrome r and Phytochrome fr. Light can control morphogenic processes such as leaf size and shoot elongation.

Different wavelengths of light produce different changes in plants. Red to Far Red light for example, regulates stem growth and straightening of the seedling shoots that are coming out of the ground. Some studies also claim that red and far red light increases the rooting mass of tomatoes as well as the rooting percentage of grape plants. On the other hand, blue and UV light regulate the germination and elongation of the plant as well as other physiological processes such as stomatal control and responses to environmental stress. Finally, green light was thought not to be available to plants due to the lack of pigments that would absorb this light. However, in 2004 it was found that green light can influence stomatal activity, stem elongation of young plants and leaf expansion.

=== Secondary Plant Metabolites ===
These compounds are chemicals that plants produce as part of their biochemical processes and help them perform certain functions as well as protect themselves from different environmental factors. In this case, some metabolites such as anthocyanins, flavonoids, and carotenes, can accumulate in plant tissues to protect them from UV radiation and very high light intensity

<doc id="578788" wikidata="Q333496" url="?curid=578788" title="Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby">
<text>Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby PC (1 September 1752 O.S. – 21 October 1834), usually styled Lord Stanley from 1771 to 1776, was a British peer and politician of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. He held office as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in 1783 in the Fox–North coalition and between 1806 and 1807 in the Ministry of All the Talents.

==Background and education==
Derby was the son of James Smith-Stanley, Lord Strange (1716–1771), son of Edward Stanley, 11th Earl of Derby (1689-1776). His mother was Lucy Smith, a daughter and co-heiress of Hugh Smith of Weald Hall, Essex. His father had assumed the additional surname and arms of Smith by private Act of Parliament in 1747. Derby entered Eton College in 1764, proceeding to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1771.

==Political career==
Derby was returned to Parliament as one of two representatives for Lancashire in 1774, a seat he held until 1776, when he succeeded his grandfather in the earldom and entered the House of Lords. He served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster between April and December 1783 in the Fox-North Coalition headed by the Duke of Portland and was sworn into the Privy Council the same year. He remained out of office for the next 23 years but was once again Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster between 1806 and 1807 in the Ministry of All the Talents headed by Lord Grenville.

Lord Derby also served as Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire between 1776 and 1834. He was also listed as a subscriber to the Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal navigation in 1791.

==Horse racing==
At a dinner party in 1778 held on his estate &quot;The Oaks&quot; in Carshalton, Lord Derby and his friends planned a sweepstake horse race, won the following year by Derby&#x27;s own horse, Bridget. The race, The Oaks, has been named after the estate since. At a celebration after Bridget&#x27;s win, a similar race for colts was proposed and Derby tossed a coin with Sir Charles Bunbury for the honour of naming the race. Derby won, and the race became known as the Derby Stakes. Bunbury won the initial race in 1780 with his horse, Diomed; Derby himself won it in 1787 with Sir Peter Teazle.

His racing colours were black with a white cap.

His influence on racing has been described as &quot;crucial&quot;.

== Cockfighting and gamefowl ==
Lord Derby&#x27;s love for racing was surpassed only by his passion for gamefowl and cockfighting. As a game fowl breeder, Derby is said to have influenced contemporaries by proving that systematic breeding could be combined with a learned familiarity of one&#x27;s fowl through daily, attentive care, to increase success.

During his lifetime, Lord Derby established a family of gamefowl, which would remain popular for nearly 200 years after his death.

Derby built a cockpit in Preston at his own expense, and fought there or at Liverpool race meets. He and fellow cocker, General Yates, held annual cockfighting contests with regular stakes between 1,000-3,000 guineas to the winner.

According to an obituary:
For much of his career, Lord Derby employed a top feeder of the time, Paul Potter, to oversee his training. Potter&#x27;s son handled these duties later in Lord Derby&#x27;s life, and would, upon Lord Derby&#x27;s death, receive possession of all Derby&#x27;s birds, spurs, bags and fighting equipment, including the silk bags used for transporting the fowl, embroidered in Lord Derby&#x27;s colours with the image of a fighting cock. He is thought to be the last member of the peerage to openly participate in the sport.

==Family==

Lord Derby married Lady Elizabeth, daughter of James Hamilton, 6th Duke of Hamilton, on 23 June 1774. They had three children:
* Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby (21 April 1775 – 30 June 1851); married his cousin Charlotte Margaret Hornby, daughter of Reverend Geoffrey Hornby by his wife, the Hon. Lucy Hornby (née Smith-Stanley)
* Lady Charlotte Stanley (17 October 1776 – 25 November 1805); married her cousin Edmund Hornby, Esq., son of Reverend Geoffrey Hornby by his wife, the Hon. Lucy Hornby (née Smith-Stanley)
* Lady Elizabeth Henrietta Stanley (29 April 1778 – 4 November 1857); married Stephen Thomas Cole, Esq., of Stoke Lyne, Oxfordshire, and Twickenham, and had issue.

In the late 1770s, Lady Derby had a very public affair with John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset. In 1779, the countess moved out of Lord Derby&#x27;s house, leaving their children behind, apparently expecting that her husband would agree to a divorce and that the Duke would then marry her. About one year after she left his house, Lord Derby made it known that he had no intention of divorcing his wife; at the same time, he continued to deny her access to her children. The countess was socially ostracised for the remainder of her life. Historian Peter Thomson suggests that the third of the couple&#x27;s children, Lady Elizabeth Henrietta, was the result of Lady Derby&#x27;s affair with Dorset. Despite this, the Earl of Derby cared for the child after his wife left him.

Lady Derby died at the age of 44 on 14 March 1797. Six weeks later, on 1 May 1797, Lord Derby married the actress Elizabeth Farren, daughter of George Farren. They had three more children:

*Lady Lucy Elizabeth Stanley (1 March 1799 – 25 April 1809), died young
*Hon. James Stanley (9 March 1800 – 3 April 1817), died young &quot;after a long and painful illness&quot;
*Lady Mary Margaret Stanley (23 March 1801 – December 1858); married Thomas Egerton, 2nd Earl of Wilton.

Lord Derby survived his second wife by five years and died on 21 October 1834, aged 82. He was succeeded in the earldom by his son from his first marriage, Edward, Lord Stanley.

<text>Carl Trumbull Hayden (October 2, 1877 – January 25, 1972) was an American politician. Representing Arizona in the United States Senate from 1927 to 1969, he was the first U.S. Senator to serve seven terms. Serving as the state&#x27;s first Representative for eight terms before entering the Senate, Hayden set the record as the longest-serving member of the United States Congress more than a decade before his retirement from politics. He was Dean of the United States Senate and served as its president pro tempore and chairman of both its Rules and Administration and Appropriations committees. He was a member of the Democratic Party. Hayden was also the last remaining member of Congress to have served during the presidencies of William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson, as he retired in 1969.

Having earned a reputation as a reclamation expert early in his congressional career, Hayden consistently backed legislation dealing with public lands, mining, reclamation, and other projects affecting the Western United States. In addition, he played a key role in creating the funding formula for the federal highway system. President John F. Kennedy said of Hayden, &quot;Every Federal program which has contributed to the development of the West—irrigation, power, reclamation—bears his mark, and the great Federal highway program which binds this country together, which permits this State to be competitive east and west, north and south, this in large measure is his creation.&quot;

Known as the &quot;Silent Senator&quot;, Hayden rarely spoke on the Senate floor. Instead his influence came from committee meetings and Senate cloakroom discussions, where his comments were &quot;given a respect comparable to canon law&quot;. A colleague said of him, &quot;No man in Senate history has wielded more influence with less oratory,&quot; while the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that Hayden had &quot;assisted so many projects for so many senators that when old Carl wants something for his beloved Arizona, his fellow senators fall all over themselves giving him a hand. They&#x27;d probably vote landlocked Arizona a navy if he asked for it.&quot;

==Background==
Hayden was born to Charles Trumbull Hayden and Sallie Calvert Davis on October 2, 1877, in Hayden&#x27;s Ferry, Arizona Territory (renamed Tempe in 1878). Charles Hayden was a Connecticut-born merchant and freight operator who had moved west due to a lung ailment and homesteaded a claim on the south bank of the Salt River. Charles Hayden had also served as a probate judge and, following Grover Cleveland&#x27;s 1884 election, had been considered for the territorial governorship. Sallie Davis was an Arkansas-born schoolteacher who served as vice president of the Arizona Territorial Suffrage Association during the 1890s.

Following the birth of their son, Charles and Sallie Hayden had three daughters: Sarah (called Sallie), Anna, and Mary (called Mapes). Anna died unexpectedly at two-and-one-half years of age. The Hayden family operated a variety of business interests including a ferry service, a gristmill, a general store, and agricultural interests.

While he was growing up, Hayden&#x27;s family took several trips, including journeys to Washington, D.C., and the 1893 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. To these, Hayden added several solo trips, including a horseback trip to the Grand Canyon and a trip to Mexico City when he was fourteen.
Hayden attended Tempe&#x27;s Eighth Street School and Arizona Territorial Normal School (now Arizona State University). After his graduation from normal school in June 1896 he was enrolled at Stanford University where he studied economics, history, language, and philosophy with an interest in attending law school after graduation. While at Stanford, he was sophomore class president and participated in debate, fiction writing, football, and track. During his junior year, Hayden suffered his only election defeat when he narrowly lost the race for student body president. He attributed his loss to overconfidence and learned to &quot;always run scared&quot; in future elections. Hayden met his future wife, Nan Downing, while at Stanford. The couple married on February 14, 1908, and produced no children.

One semester from graduation, in December 1899, Hayden was forced to drop out of school when his father became ill. Charles Hayden died on February 5, 1900, leaving his son with responsibility for the family and control of the family business interests. Hayden sold the mercantile business to pay off outstanding debts and then rented most of the family&#x27;s properties to provide an income that allowed him to move his mother and sisters to Palo Alto, California, where his sisters could attend college. In the fall of 1903, he enlisted in the Arizona Territorial National Guard and was elected captain within two months.

==Early political career==

Soon after his return from Stanford, Hayden became active in Democratic Party politics. In September 1900 he represented Tempe as a delegate at a county level convention and became chairman of the Maricopa County Democratic Central Committee in 1902. Hayden was also elected to a two-year term on the Tempe town council. Following passage of the National Reclamation Act of 1902 he was sent to Washington, D.C. by interests in Tempe to lobby for funding of the Salt River Project.

Hayden led the Arizona Territory delegation to the 1904 Democratic National Convention in St. Louis. Later in 1904 he was elected Maricopa County treasurer. Hayden&#x27;s two years as treasurer provided him practical experience with public finance and budgetary processes. After one term as county treasurer, he chose to pursue the more lucrative office of sheriff—the position providing a travel budget and a percentage of collected fees. The November 1906 election saw Hayden defeat his Republican and Prohibition party challengers by the largest margin of victory in any of the county races.

By the time Hayden became sheriff, Maricopa County had transformed from a Wild West frontier into a quiet agricultural settlement. Based in Phoenix, which had grown to a population of 10,000 people, he performed duties such as maintaining order, collecting fees from saloons and gambling halls, transportation of prisoners to other parts of the territory, and enforcing local ordinances such as a Phoenix law requiring local Indians to wear pants instead of a breechcloth when visiting town. During his time as sheriff, Hayden did not have to fire his firearm, although he did use an Apperson Jack Rabbit to pursue and capture two train robbers.

==House of Representatives==

Hayden&#x27;s first run for Congress came during a 1911 special election called in anticipation of Arizona statehood. With the Democratic Party&#x27;s influence in territorial politics, winning the party primary was tantamount to winning the general election. Hayden was considered an underdog to two other Democratic challengers and received an endorsement from only one Arizona newspaper. Due to his duties as sheriff along with his Arizona Territorial National Guard service, Hayden had become known to political leaders throughout the territory. These acquaintances, combined with the influence of his father&#x27;s good reputation, allowed Hayden a surprise win in the Democratic primary which was followed by his election to the United States House of Representatives.
The 1911 election set a number of precedents that would characterize Hayden&#x27;s later political campaigns. The first was his tradition of never mentioning his opponent&#x27;s name in public. He also began a practice of caravaning around the state with other members of his party, a pattern that continued until war-time rationing of the 1940s ended the custom. He also kept a lookout for candidates with a potential to run against him, occasionally sending letters encouraging the rumored candidates to run. With good home service of his constituents, Hayden rarely faced a strong challenge for his office.

Hayden gave the jail house keys to Deputy Jeff Adams and, with his wife, began the trip to Washington, D.C. the same day President William H. Taft signed the legislation granting Arizona statehood. Bearing credentials from Territorial Governor Richard Elihu Sloan, Hayden was sworn into the 62nd United States Congress on February 19, 1912. His goal while in Congress was to help his fledgling state develop its natural resources and infrastructure while growing the state&#x27;s population. Due to the federal government controlling the majority of the state&#x27;s land, Hayden also wished to involve the federal government in this process. Hayden&#x27;s first bill, authorizing a railroad right-of-way to Fort Huachuca, was introduced on March 1, 1912.

With the 1913 start to his first full term, Hayden supported Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s policies by voting for the Clayton Anti-Trust Act, Federal Reserve Act, Underwood Tariff Act, and creation of the Federal Trade Commission. He sponsored the Grand Canyon National Park Act, and, in honor of his mother, he introduced a joint resolution calling for women&#x27;s suffrage. In 1914, Hayden secured an extension of repayment times for loans made under the National Reclamation Act of 1902 from ten to twenty years. The extension included greater flexibility in the payment amounts during the early repayment period. An additional change in the way that reclamation projects were funded came in 1922 with passage of Hayden&#x27;s legislation authorizing revenues from sale of hydroelectric power to be credited to repayment of project debts. Favoring local control of reclamation projects, in 1917 Hayden wrote legislation transferring financial obligations and operations of the Salt River Project from the Bureau of Reclamation to a local government entity. The Bureau transferring control to local government agencies would become the model for future reclamation projects in The West. Other early efforts by Hayden included sponsoring the creation of the Grand Canyon National Park and the 1919 legislation resulting in the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
Beginning with an appropriation during his first term for the United States Army Corps of Engineers to perform a study accessing the feasibility of building a flood control dam, Hayden sought to bring a reclamation project to the Gila River. Following a favorable feasibility report on the project, Hayden introduced legislation authorizing the San Carlos Project in 1914. Bill opponents claimed that Arizona had already received an overly large share of federal reclamation funds and the legislation was defeated.

Using the fact that the Pima Indians would be one of the primary beneficiaries of the project, Hayden switched tactics and, in 1916, began inserting a series of appropriations into the annual Indian Appropriations Act that paid for the construction of a diversion dam downstream of the planned reservoir. By 1922, the diversion dam was completed and named after Hayden and Arizona Senator Henry Fountain Ashurst. Final passage of the San Carlos project came in 1924 when Senator Ralph H. Cameron, Arizona&#x27;s sole Republican in the Republican-controlled 68th Congress, reintroduced the San Carlos bill. Calvin Coolidge signed the bill into law after the name &quot;Coolidge Dam&quot; was selected for the primary dam.

Hayden voted for American entry into World War I and then successfully added an amendment to a military manpower bill that prohibited conscripted personnel from avoiding military service by buying their way out and requiring all draftees to remain in the military until the end of the war. He also favored humane treatment of conscientious objectors. In the summer of 1917 Hayden proposed to President Wilson that the Industrial Workers of the World labor union be declared an outlaw organization so that vigilantes could take care of them. As an officer in the Arizona National Guard prior to the war, Major Hayden volunteered to join his unit and served as commander of the 9th battalion, 166th Depot Brigade at Camp Lewis, Washington helping prepare his division for active duty. The war ended before his unit was transferred to Europe.

While still in the House of Representatives, Hayden became involved in a decades-long dispute over water rights for the Colorado River. California interests at the time wanted to construct a water storage dam along with an All-American Canal to allow irrigation of the Imperial Valley without routing the water through Mexico. Apportionment of the river&#x27;s waters was a contentious issue and Arizona refused to approve the Colorado River Compact designed to determine allocation of water to each of the states in Colorado&#x27;s watershed.

As a result of this disagreement when Representative Phil Swing and Senator Hiram Johnson, both from California, introduced legislation authorizing the Boulder Canyon Project, Hayden became a leader of the opposition. To this end, Hayden engaged in a variety of parliamentary procedures that prevented the Swing-Johnston bill reaching the House floor for a vote until after he had left the House of Representatives for the Senate.

==Senate==
During Hayden&#x27;s first run for the Senate in 1926, he based his campaign on his record of defending Arizona&#x27;s interests in the water rights dispute with California. To this effort his campaign poster was composed of editorial headlines from California newspapers decrying Hayden&#x27;s effectiveness at preventing passage of the Swing-Johnson Bill authorizing construction of Boulder Dam. The campaign saw allegations of misconduct raised with incumbent Ralph H. Cameron claiming Hayden had used a slush fund received from out-of-state interests. An inquiry led by Senator William H. King was begun several days before the election and found no evidence of wrongdoing. &quot;Senator Cameron&#x27;s &#x27;slush fund&#x27; charges proved to be a boomerang which added considerably to my majority&quot; observed Hayden after the election.

Upon Hayden&#x27;s election to the Senate, he received what Senator Thomas J. Walsh called &quot;choice committee assignments&quot;, including a seat on the Appropriations Committee. As a result of his seat on the Appropriations Committee, much of Hayden&#x27;s efforts in the Senate were shifted away from policy making functions and toward control, allocation, and oversight of the financial funds used to implement legislated policy. Other committee assignments that would help shape his Senate career included Interior and Insular Affairs, Post Office and Post Roads, Rules and Administration, and the United States Congress Joint Committee on Printing.

===1920s===

Upon moving to the Senate in March 1927, Hayden continued his opposition to the Boulder Canyon Project. With growing national support for the project, however, it became obvious to Hayden that passage of the bill was inevitable. Seeking time to gain terms more favorable to Arizona, he continued his opposition with the aid of two filibusters from Arizona&#x27;s other Senator, Henry F. Ashurst, and was able to delay a vote of the full Senate on the measure until the end of the 70th Congress&#x27; first session. When the Swing-Johnston bill came up for a vote on May 28, 1928, Hayden made his first speech from the floor of the Senate, a filibuster in which he spoke for nine hours during an all-night session before allowing Ashurst to take over for another twelve hours.

Passage of the Boulder Canyon Project came shortly after Congress reconvened in December 1928. Politically unpopular in Arizona, the final bill did contain several important concessions for Arizona. An amendment by Nevada Senator Key Pittman was added to the bill and set water allotments from the Colorado to per year to Nevada, per year to California and per year to Arizona with exclusive rights to all waters from the Gila River also going to Arizona. The final bill also included authorization to pay both Arizona and Nevada an amount comparable to the tax revenues that would be generated if the dam had been built by private enterprise. Following passage of the bill, Hayden switched his form of opposition by working to deny funds for the Boulder Canyon Project.

===1930s===
Hayden&#x27;s 1932 campaign saw him coming close to defeat. Votes against early payment of the World War I veterans&#x27; bonus and for prohibition, the Senate vote for repeal of prohibition not coming until 1933, caused him to lose support from his Depression-era constituents and he only won a plurality during the primary. Hayden later speculated that if he had faced only one opponent, he might not have won.

With President Franklin D. Roosevelt 1932 election and the start of the New Deal, Hayden dropped opposition of the Boulder Canyon Project and began lobbying for additional irrigation and hydroelectric projects. He actively supported the Central Valley Project and acted as floor manager for the Grand Coulee Dam&#x27;s appropriation legislation. Due to Hayden&#x27;s efforts, Senator Warren Magnuson of Washington would later call him &quot;the father of the Grand Coulee Dam&quot;. When demands for new projects during the 1930s drained the Reclamation Fund faster than repayments could replenish it, Hayden worked with Senator Joseph C. O&#x27;Mahoney of Wyoming to secure new funding by allocating revenue from offshore oil reserves to the Reclamation Fund.
Due to Hayden&#x27;s seat on the Senate Committee on Post Office and Post Roads, he worked on a number of legislative initiatives promoting highway transportation. His interest in the subject was such that President Roosevelt asked why he always wished to talk about roads, to which Hayden replied, &quot;Because Arizona has two things people will drive thousands of miles to see—Grand Canyon and the Petrified Forest. They can&#x27;t get there without roads.&quot; The first piece of legislation came in 1933 with US$400 million in federal matching funds targeted at highway construction included in the National Industrial Recovery Act. This was followed the next year when Hayden and Oklahoma Representative Wilburn Cartwright introduced the Hayden-Cartwright Act.

This act was the first that allowed for funds to be used for advanced planning of future roads. It also allowed federal funds to be used for roads in urban areas, instead of just rural routes, and created disincentives to prevent states from diverting highway funds to other projects. A second Hayden-Cartwright Act authorized use of federal funds to build roads on Indian reservations and national parks and forests. In addition to road construction, Hayden also had an interest in promoting highway safety, joining with first-term Missouri Senator Harry S. Truman in 1939 to propose legislation cutting federal funds by a third for states that failed to enact licensing requirements along with other portions of the Uniform Vehicle Code.

In addition to his support of reclamation and highway projects, Hayden was also involved in other efforts to promote economic growth during the Great Depression. A proposal made in 1932 would have allowed repayment of war debts to the United States to be made in silver at a discounted rate. The plan was intended to raise the price of silver, increasing the value of US silver holdings and silver coinage worldwide. Effects of the depression however prevented repayment of most war debts and rendered the plan moot. Hayden also sponsored legislation creating the Farmers Home Administration, authorizing government-insured loans to farmers.

===1940s===
With the 1940s and the coming of World War II, Hayden&#x27;s focus shifted from public works to war-time needs. He lobbied a variety of Arizona groups to make land available and touting the favorable year-round flying weather, he assisted with the creation of a number of military bases throughout his home state, including the Luke and Williams training bases. An Army Desert Training Center built in southwestern Arizona and southeastern California was also used by American troops preparing for the North African campaign. As the United States prepared for possible war, Hayden in August 1940 advocated the use of volunteers instead of conscription to obtain needed manpower. He also introduced amendments prohibiting payment of money to avoid military service, draftees procuring substitutes, and securing of enlistments by the paying of bounties.

In 1945, Hayden suffered a personal tragedy when his wife, Nan, had a stroke. As a result, she was able to stand but could no longer walk and required the assistance of a nurse. Her need for assistance would continue until her death on June 25, 1961.
Following a 1944 treaty with Mexico granting the nation per year of Colorado River water, Hayden began direct efforts to bring water from the river to Phoenix, Tucson, and the irrigable Arizona farmlands between the cities. To this end, he and Arizona&#x27;s other senator, Ernest McFarland, introduced legislation in 1946 to build the Central Arizona Project. Unsuccessful in their first attempt, they reintroduced the legislation in 1947 where it passed the Senate but was defeated in the House by opposition from the California delegation.

The 1940s started an era of key committee chairmanships for Hayden. Due to the declining health of Kenneth McKellar, Hayden periodically served as acting chairman of the Appropriations committee during the 1940s and the 1950s. This activity included a significant amount of behind the scenes work with the committee&#x27;s ranking Republican, Senator Styles Bridges, and enhanced Hayden&#x27;s reputation for operating in Senate cloakrooms. Starting with the 81st Congress, Hayden became chairman of the Senate Rules Committee.

===1950s===
Hayden&#x27;s efforts to gain approval for the Central Arizona Project continued into the 1950s. Hayden and McFarland reintroduced their previous legislation in 1951 but it was again defeated in the House, this time due to concerns that full appropriation of Colorado waters had not occurred. The legislative setback prompted Arizona to file suit in the United States Supreme Court seeking adjudication of the water rights issue. The case, &quot;Arizona v. California&quot;, was accepted by the court on January 19, 1953, and would take over a decade to decide. In other reclamation efforts Hayden cosponsored the Colorado River Storage Act of 1956, authorizing construction of the Glen Canyon Dam and three other water storage dams.

The stable political environment in Arizona that Hayden had enjoyed during most of his career began to change by the 1950s. Following World War II, large numbers of Midwestern expatriates moved to Arizona and bolstered the growth of the Republican Party within the state. While he was still popular with long-term Arizona residents, many of the new arrivals were unfamiliar with Hayden&#x27;s congressional record. As a result, during the 1956 election Hayden&#x27;s campaign produced a number of television and radio appearances designed to inform voters of the Senator&#x27;s accomplishments and dispel rumors of failing health and senility.
The campaign also took advantage of a &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; article that provided a complimentary portrait of Hayden&#x27;s service in the Senate.

In 1956, Hayden was involved in a legal dispute when a United States district court judge issued a restraining order blocking the publication of a Senate pamphlet. Hayden, who was then the chairman of the Joint Committee on Printing, charged the order was unconstitutional and stated, &quot;If a court can enjoin Congress from issuing a report it will only be a matter of time before our remarks on the floor of the Senate or the House of Representatives would be subject to a judicial review and a complete breakdown of the constitutional principal of separation of powers would ensue.&quot;
Following a Printing Committee vote to ignore the order, Hayden directed the Government Printing Office to &quot;disregard as unconstitutional the processes of any court in this case.&quot; The court ruling was later set aside by another federal judge stating the order had &quot;constituted an unwarranted and unauthorized action by the judiciary&quot; that interfered with the government&#x27;s legislative function.

At the beginning of the 84th Congress, Hayden gave up his chairmanship of the Senate Rules Committee in order to become chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. The year 1955 saw him become a member of the newly formed Senate Democratic Policy Committee. Hayden also set several records for length of service, breaking Adolph Sabath&#x27;s record for continuous service in Congress on October 21, 1957, and Joseph G. Cannon&#x27;s record for total length of service in Congress on February 19, 1958. Hayden&#x27;s record for longest service was not broken until November 18, 2009, by Robert Byrd.

===1960s===
During 1962, Hayden came to national attention due to a dispute over procedural issues between the Senate Appropriations Committee and House Appropriations Committee. Billed in the press as a feud between two octogenarian chairmen, Hayden and Representative Clarence Cannon, the dispute began over the issue of where conference committees to resolve appropriation issues would meet. The Constitution required that all appropriations bills must originate in the House while long-standing tradition of the time held that conference committee meetings occurred on the Senate side of the United States Capitol with a senator chairing the committee. The dispute began in January 1962 when members of the House appropriations committee passed a resolution calling for the meeting location of the conference committee to be evenly split between the House and Senate side of the Capitol building. In response to this, the Senate appropriations committee passed a resolution calling for half of all appropriations bills to originate in the Senate. By April, Hayden had arranged for a meeting room located midway between the two chambers but House members refused to discuss the issue face-to-face until July, when US$55 billion in unapproved appropriations threatened to force a government shutdown.

During Hayden&#x27;s final campaign in 1962, the Central Arizona Project was the central issue. State leaders saw his seniority as being key in gaining approval for the project. To aid his re-election, campaign staff arranged for a series of events to celebrate Hayden&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary in Congress and raise awareness of his achievements. A series of viral infections suffered by the senator over the course of the year prompted rumors that the 85-year-old senator had died. To refute these rumors, Hayden held a press conference at Bethesda Naval Hospital three days before the election. Despite a growing Republican trend in Arizona, Hayden&#x27;s Republican challenger, state representative and future governor Evan Mecham, only got lukewarm support from the state party. Arizona&#x27;s Republican establishment felt Hayden&#x27;s seniority was crucial for ensuring the project would pass. Ultimately, Hayden won a record seventh term, but only tallied 54.9 percent of the vote—easily the closest race of his Senate career, and his closest since his first bid for a full term in the House half a century earlier.

The events of the decade resulted in Hayden twice advancing to second place on the presidential line of succession. The first occurrence came on November 16, 1961, with the death of House Speaker Sam Rayburn when Hayden followed Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson and lasted until a new Speaker was elected. The second occurrence began with the November 22, 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy and continued until Hubert Humphrey became vice president on January 20, 1965. When asked of his plans if he had succeeded to the presidency, Hayden replied &quot;I&#x27;d call Congress together, have the House elect a new speaker, and then I&#x27;d resign and let him become president.&quot;

Hayden&#x27;s final legislative success was authorization of the Central Arizona Project. On June 4, 1963, one day after the Supreme Court issued a decision in &quot;Arizona v. California&quot; favorable to Arizona, Hayden joined with the rest of his state&#x27;s congressional delegation in reintroducing legislation authorizing the water project. As in the bill&#x27;s previous efforts, Hayden&#x27;s influence was able to secure passage of the legislation in the Senate while passage in the House proved difficult. Initial opposition from the California delegation subsided by early 1965 after Governor Pat Brown declared, &quot;California will not attempt to win by obstruction what it has not won by litigation&quot;, only to be replaced by opposition from Colorado Representative Wayne Aspinall. Aspinall, chairman of the House Interior Committee, refused to hold hearings on Hayden&#x27;s bill. In response to the delays, Hayden waited until Aspinall returned home for vacation and then added his proposed bill as a rider to pork barrel bill containing patronage for a large number of Congressmen. In response to Hayden&#x27;s maneuver, Aspinall returned from vacation to hold hearings on the Central Arizona Project.
Final approval for the Central Arizona Project came on September 30, 1968, a day declared by President Johnson as &quot;Carl Hayden Day&quot;. Hayden remarked on the occasion, &quot;My efforts in behalf of the Central Arizona Project, began while I was still a Congressman and I consider it ... the most significant accomplishment of my career.&quot;

==Professional disposition==
Hayden kept a considerably lower national profile than conventional wisdom would suggest for someone who spent more than half a century in Washington, including 42 years in the Senate. This came in part due to a conversation he had with Maryland Congressman Fred Talbott soon after he arrived in Washington in 1912. Talbott told him, &quot;Son, there are two kinds of Congressmen—show horses and work horses. If you want to get your name in the papers, be a show horse. But if you want to gain the respect of your colleagues, don&#x27;t do it. Be a work horse.&quot;
Hayden quickly earned a reputation as a &quot;service congressman&quot; who faithfully responded to constituent mail, inserting vegetable or flower seed packets in his replies. Hayden believed that partisanship should end on election day, and his constituent service was performed in a nonpartisan manner.

During his time in office, Hayden avoided publicity and speech making. Following his filibuster of Boulder Dam, Hayden did not make another speech from the Senate floor for 20 years. By his later years, many of his congressional colleagues had not heard him make a full speech. His avoidance of public speaking did not impair Hayden in his duties, with then Senator Lyndon B. Johnson saying &quot;He is living proof that effectiveness and statesmanship are not necessarily coupled with talkativeness&quot; and Arthur Edson of the Associated Press writing, &quot;He has kept his mouth shut while astutely pushing out invisible tentacles of power&quot;.

==After office==

Hayden announced his retirement on May 6, 1968, saying &quot;Among other things that fifty-six years in Congress have taught me is that contemporary events need contemporary men. Time actually makes specialists of us all. When a house is built there is a moment for the foundation, another for the walls, the roof and so on. Arizona&#x27;s foundation includes fast highways, adequate electric power, and abundant water, and these foundations have been laid. It is time for a new building crew to report, so I have decided to retire from office at the close of my term this year.&quot; Hayden recommended long-term aide Roy Elson to succeed him. Elson lost his election bid to former Senator Barry Goldwater.

Following his retirement from Congress, Hayden returned to Tempe and set up an office in Arizona State University&#x27;s Charles Trumbull Hayden library. In addition to organizing the papers he collected during his career, he also wrote a biography of his father and worked on a project documenting the lives of Arizona&#x27;s pioneers. He became ill in the middle of January 1972 and died on January 25, 1972. He was buried in Tempe&#x27;s Double Butte Cemetery. Speakers at Hayden&#x27;s memorial service included Goldwater and former President Lyndon B. Johnson.

In response to his long tenure in Congress, multiple projects have been named after him. On September 29, 1957, Phoenix Union High School District dedicated Carl Hayden High School. This was followed by the Maricopa County Democratic Committee lobbying for Glen Canyon Dam to be named Hayden Dam, a move that Hayden personally opposed. In 1969, the visitor center overlooking Glen Canyon Dam was named after the long-term senator. Naming efforts even continued after Hayden&#x27;s death with the US Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Carl Hayden Bee Research Center being named in 1978 followed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs&#x27; Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center in 1987. The Hayden-Rhodes aqueduct was named after Carl Hayden upon its completion in 1985 due to his involvement in the legislation that created it. A bust of Hayden was added to the Senate sculpture collection and placed in the Russell Senate Office Building in 1986. A bust of Hayden also sits outside just north of the Arizona State Capitol.

<doc id="578810" wikidata="Q5075471" url="?curid=578810" title="Charles Bathurst">
<text>Charles Bathurst PC (1754 – 13 August 1831), known as Charles Bragge from 1754 to 1804, was a British politician of the early 19th century.

==Background and education==
Born Charles Bragge, Bathurst was the son of Charles Bragge, of Cleeve Hill in Gloucestershire, and his wife Anne Bathurst, the granddaughter of Sir Benjamin Bathurst, younger brother of Allen Bathurst, 1st Earl Bathurst. He was educated at Winchester School and New College, Oxford and studied law at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1772, being called to the bar in 1778. In 1804 he assumed by royal licence the surname of Bathurst in lieu of Bragge when he inherited Lydney Park in Gloucestershire from his maternal uncle Poole Bathurst.

==Political career==
Bathurst sat as a member of parliament (MP) for Monmouth from 1790 to 1796, for Bristol from 1796 to 1812, for Bodmin from 1812 to 1818 and for Harwich from 1818 to 1823. He was invested a member of the Privy Council in 1801 and held office under Henry Addington as Treasurer of the Navy from 1801 to 1803 and as Secretary at War from 1803 to 1804. He also served under the Duke of Portland as Master of the Mint (1806–07) and under Lord Liverpool as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (1812–23) and President of the Board of Control (1821–22).

In 1796 Bathurst was made an honorary freeman of the Society of Merchant Venturers, due to his support for the slave trade.

==Family==
Bathurst died in August 1831. He had married Charlotte, daughter of Anthony Addington, in 1781 and with her had 2 sons and 2 daughters. He was succeeded in turn by their eldest son Charles and their younger son, Reverend William Hiley Bathurst who became the grandfather of Charles Bathurst, 1st Viscount Bledisloe. His wife survived him by eight years and died in May 1839.

<doc id="578812" wikidata="Q126709" url="?curid=578812" title="National Professional Soccer League (1984–2001)">
<text>The National Professional Soccer League was a professional indoor soccer league in the U.S. and Canada. It was originally called the American Indoor Soccer Association.

==History==
In November 1983, a Kalamazoo, Michigan–based group called Soccer Leagues Unlimited unveiled a plan for an indoor league composed exclusively of American players. The group&#x27;s president, Bob Lemieux (later AISA commissioner), announced that Kalamazoo, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Springfield, Illinois, were on board in what was he said was intended to be a sort of farm system, or developmental league, for the well established Major Indoor Soccer League. He added that groups in Indianapolis, Peoria, and Michigan cities, Saginaw and Flint; Kentucky cities, Lexington and Louisville; Ohio cities, Columbus Toledo and Dayton; Erie, PA; and Green Bay, Wisconsin, were all interested in joining the league.

Officially starting on April 18, 1984, the American Indoor Soccer Association&#x27;s charter franchises were Chicago, Milwaukee, Kalamazoo and Fort Wayne; however, a Fort Wayne team did not materialize until the league&#x27;s third season. Three other teams, Louisville, Canton and Columbus, all joined the league before the first season began in November 1984.

In 1990, the league changed its name to the National Professional Soccer League. Over its 17 seasons, a total of 30 franchises in 32 cities were part of the league at one time or another. During the summer of 2001, the league disbanded and the six surviving teams formed the second incarnation of the Major Indoor Soccer League.

When the league began in 1984, game rules were almost identical compared to the larger and more popular Major Indoor Soccer League. Beginning with the 1988–89 season, the AISA changed their scoring system. Goals were now worth 1, 2, or 3 points depending upon distance or game situation. Basically, all non-power play goals scored from inside the yellow line were worth 2 points while non-powerplay goals from outside the yellow line (50 feet from the goal line) were worth 3 points. Any power play goal was worth 1 point, as was any goal scored during a penalty shootout. Before the 1994–1995 season, the three-point line was changed to a 45-foot arc. Eventually, power play goals were worth either two or three points, but penalty shootouts were still kept at one point.

<doc id="578821" wikidata="Q644571" url="?curid=578821" title="Our Lady of the Angels School fire">
<text>On Monday, December 1, 1958, a fire broke out at Our Lady of the Angels School in Chicago, Illinois, shortly before classes were to be dismissed for the day. The fire originated in the basement near the foot of a stairway. The elementary school was operated by the Archdiocese of Chicago and had an enrollment of approximately 1600 students. A total of 92 pupils and three nuns ultimately died when smoke, heat, fire, and toxic gases cut off their normal means of egress through corridors and stairways. Many more were injured when they jumped from second-floor windows which, because the building had a raised basement, were nearly as high above ground as a third floor would be on level ground, approximately .

The disaster was the lead headline story in American, European, and Canadian newspapers. Pope John XXIII sent his condolences from The Vatican. The severity of the fire shocked the nation and surprised educational administrators of both public and private schools. The disaster led to major improvements in standards for school design and fire safety codes.

==Background==

Our Lady of the Angels was a grammar school comprising kindergarten through eighth-grade education. It was located at 909 North Avers Avenue in the Humboldt Park area of Chicago&#x27;s West Side, on the northeast corner of West Iowa Street and North Avers Avenue (some sources describe the school as &quot;in Austin&quot;). The neighborhood had originally been heavily Irish-American, but gradually developed in the first half of the twentieth century into a largely Italian-American middle-class community. The area was also home to several other first, second, and third-generation immigrant groups, including German Americans, Polish Americans and other Slavic Americans. Most of the families in the immediate neighborhood were Catholic.

The school was one of several buildings associated with the large Catholic parish; others included a church, a rectory, which was adjacent to the church, a convent of the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which was across Iowa Street from the school, and two buildings one block east on Hamlin Avenue referred to by the parish as Joseph Hall and Mary Hall respectively, which housed kindergarten and first-grade classes. The Hamlin Avenue buildings were not involved in the fire, and aside from some minor smoke inhalation problems (no deaths or serious injuries), neither were the first floor of the north wing, the entire south wing, or the annex.

The fire was primarily confined to the second floor of the north wing. The north wing was part of a two-story structure built in 1910, but remodeled several times over the years. That wing originally consisted of a first-floor church and a second-floor school. The entire building became a school when a new, much larger church was opened in 1939. 

=== Fire prevention and hazards ===

Due to a grandfather clause that did not require schools to retrofit to a new standard if they already met previous regulations, the school legally complied with the State of Illinois and City of Chicago fire codes of 1958 and was generally clean and well-maintained; nonetheless, several fire hazards existed. Each classroom door had a glass transom above it, which provided ventilation into the corridor but also permitted flames and smoke to enter once heat broke the glass. The school had one fire escape. The building had no automatic fire alarm, no rate-of-rise heat detectors, no direct alarm connection to the fire department, no fire-resistant stairwells, and no heavy-duty fire doors from the stairwells to the second-floor corridor. At the time, fire sprinklers were primarily found in factories or in new school construction, and modern smoke detectors did not become commercially available until 1969.

In keeping with city fire codes, the building had a brick exterior to prevent fires from spreading from building to building as in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. However, its interior was made almost entirely of combustible wooden materials—stairs, walls, floors, doors, roof, and cellulose fiber ceiling tiles. Moreover, the floors had been coated many times with both flammable varnish and petroleum-based waxes. There were only two (unmarked) fire alarm switches in the entire school, and they were both in the south wing. There were four fire extinguishers in the north wing, each mounted off the floor, out of reach for many adults and all of the children.

The single fire escape was near one end of the north wing, but reaching it required passing through the main corridor, which in this case rapidly became filled with suffocating smoke and superheated gases. Students hung their flammable winter coats on hooks in the hallway (there were no lockers). There were no limits to the number of students in a single classroom, and because of the post-World War II baby boom this number sometimes reached as many as 64 students. The school did not have a fire alarm box outside on the sidewalk, the nearest one being a block and a half away. With its ceilings and a basement that extended partially above ground level, the school&#x27;s second-floor windows were above the ground, making jumping from them extremely risky, exacerbated by the fact that the grade surface under all windows was concrete or crushed rock.

==The fire==

===Outbreak and reaction===
The fire began in the basement of the older north wing between about 2:00 p.m. and 2:20 p.m. CST. Classes were due to be dismissed at 3:00 p.m. Ignition took place in a cardboard trash barrel located a few feet from the northeast stairwell. The fire smoldered undetected for approximately 20 minutes, gradually heating the stairwell and filling it with a light gray smoke that later would become thick and black, as other combustibles became involved. At the same time, it began sending superheated air and gases into an open pipe chase very near the source of the fire. The pipe chase made an uninterrupted conduit up to the cockloft above the second-floor classrooms (see &quot;Evacuation&quot; below).

The smoke began to fill the second-floor corridor, but remained unnoticed for a few minutes. At approximately 2:25 p.m., three eighth-grade girls, Janet Delaria, Frances Guzaldo, and Karen Hobik, returning from an errand, came up a different staircase to return to their second-floor classroom in the north wing (only Delaria would survive the fire). The girls encountered thick grayish smoke, making them cough loudly. They hurriedly entered the rear door of Room 211 and notified their teacher, Sister Mary Helaine O&#x27;Neill.

O&#x27;Neill got up from her desk and began lining up her students to evacuate the building. When she opened the front door of the classroom moments later to enter the hallway, the intensity of the smoke caused O&#x27;Neill to deem it too dangerous to attempt escape down the stairs leading to Avers Avenue on the west side of the building. She remained inside the classroom with her students to await rescue. The fire continued to strengthen, and several more minutes elapsed before the school&#x27;s fire alarm rang.

About this same time, a window at the foot of the stairwell shattered due to the intense heat, giving the smoldering fire a new oxygen supply. This burst of heat also ignited a roll of material, described by the fire chief in his report as &quot;tarred building paper&quot;, stored in the area, which, along with the petroleum-based waxes on the floors, caused the thick, oily black smoke that was believed responsible for so many of the smoke inhalation deaths in the building. The wooden staircase burst into flames and, acting like a chimney, sent hot gases, fire, and very thick, black smoke swirling up the stairwell.

At approximately the same time, the school janitor, James Raymond, saw a red glow through a window while walking by the building. After running to the basement furnace room, he viewed the fire through a door that led into the stairwell. After instructing two boys who were emptying trash baskets in the boiler room to leave the area, Raymond rushed to the rectory and asked the housekeeper to call the fire department. He then ran back to the school to begin evacuation via the fire escape. The two boys meanwhile returned to their class and warned their lay teacher, which prompted her and another teacher to lead their students out of classrooms in the annex area of the second floor. The teachers had looked in vain for the school principal before deciding to act on their own to vacate the school. Unknown to them, the principal was in the other wing, covering a class for an absent teacher.

As they left the building, a teacher pulled the fire alarm, but it did not ring. Several minutes later, after leaving her students in the church, she returned to the school and attempted to activate the alarm again. This time, the alarm rang inside the school, but it was not automatically connected to the fire department. By this time, however, the students and teachers in the north wing classrooms on the second floor were essentially trapped, whether they knew about the fire or not.

Despite Raymond&#x27;s visit to the rectory soon after 2:30 p.m. to spread the alert, there was an unexplained delay before the first telephone call from the rectory reached the fire department at 2:42 p.m. One minute later, a second telephone call was received from Barbara Glowacki, the owner of a candy store on the alley along the north wing. Glowacki had noticed flames in the northeast stairwell after a passing motorist, Elmer Barkhaus, entered her store and asked if a public telephone was available to call the fire department. Police initially thought this 61-year-old man was a suspect in the blaze until Barkhaus voluntarily came forward and explained himself. Glowacki used her private telephone in her apartment behind the store to notify authorities.

===Evacuation===
The first-floor landing was equipped with a heavy wooden door, which effectively blocked the fire and heat from entering the first floor hallways. However, the northeast stairwell landing on the second floor had no fire blocking door. As a result, there was no barrier to prevent the spread of fire, smoke, and heat through the second floor hallways. The western stairwell landing on the second floor had two substandard corridor doors with glass panes propped open (possibly by a teacher) at the time of the fire. This caused further drafts of air and an additional oxygen supply to feed the flames. Two other doors were chained open when they should have been closed; these doors were at the first and second floor levels leading into the annex. The upper door was quickly closed, but the lower one remained open throughout the fire.

As the fire consumed the northeast stairway, a pipe chase running from the basement to the cockloft above the second floor false ceiling had been feeding superheated gases for some minutes on a direct route to the attic. The building&#x27;s old roof had been re-coated numerous times, and the tar had become very thick. Consequently, the heat of the fire was not able to burn quickly through the roof. If it had, it would have opened a hole that would have served to vent much of the smoke and gases. Eventually, as the temperature continued to rise in the enclosed space, the wood of the cockloft itself flashed over.

The fire then swept down through the hallway ceiling&#x27;s ventilation grates into the second floor corridor as it flashed through the cockloft above the classrooms. Glass transom windows above the doors of each classroom broke as the heat intensified, allowing superheated gases and thick black smoke in the hallway to enter the classrooms. By the time the students and their teachers in the second floor classrooms realized the danger (and the occupants of several of the rooms, until that moment, did &quot;not&quot; realize the danger), their sole escape route into the hallway was impassable. The second floor of the north wing had become an impervious fire trap.

For 329 children and five teaching nuns, the only remaining means of escape was to jump from the second floor windows to the concrete or crushed rock below, or to wait for the fire department to rescue them. Recognizing the trap they were in, some of the nuns encouraged the children to sit at their desks or gather in a semicircle and pray. But smoke, heat, and flames quickly forced them to the windows.

One nun, Sister Mary Davidis Devine, ordered her students in room 209 to place books and furniture in front of her classroom doors, and this helped to slow the entry of smoke and flames until rescuers arrived. Out of the 55 students in the room, most escaped unharmed, eight escaped with injuries and two died; Beverly Burda, the last student remaining in the room, evidently passed out from smoke inhalation and died when the roof collapsed. Another student, Valerie Thoma, died at a hospital three months later, on March 5, 1959, as a result of her extensive burn injuries.

===Rescue===
Fire department units arrived within four minutes of being called, but by then the fire had been burning unchecked for possibly as long as 40 minutes and was fully out of control. The fire department was initially hampered because they had been incorrectly directed to the rectory address around the corner at 3808 W. Iowa Street. Valuable minutes were then lost repositioning the fire trucks and hose lines. Additional firefighting equipment was summoned rapidly, as the fire situation was quickly upgraded to &quot;five alarm&quot; (all available equipment and units). In 1959, the National Fire Protection Association&#x27;s report on the blaze exonerated the rapid response of the Chicago Fire Department and its initial priority to rescue pupils rather than merely fight the flames.

The south windows of the north wing overlooked a small courtyard surrounded by the school on three sides, and a high iron picket fence on the fourth side facing Avers Avenue. Because of earlier problems with vandalism, the gate in the fence was routinely kept locked. Firefighters could not get ladders to the children at the south windows without first breaking through the gate. They spent two minutes battering the gate with sledgehammers and a ladder before they managed to smash it by backing a fire truck into it. The locked gate delayed the rescues of rooms 209 and 211.

Firefighters began rescuing children from the second-floor windows, but nightmarish conditions in some of the classrooms had already become unbearable. Children were stumbling, crawling, and fighting their way to the windows, trying to breathe and escape. Many jumped, fell, or were pushed out the windows before firemen on ladders could reach them. Children jumped with their hair and clothes on fire. Some died later as a result of the fall, and several more were seriously injured. Many of the smaller children were trapped behind frantic students at the windows.

Some younger students who managed to secure a spot at a window were then unable to climb over the high window sills, or were pulled back by others frantically trying to scramble out. The temperature continued to increase until a flashover occurred in the hallway and several of the classrooms at approximately 2:55 p.m. Firefighters struggled desperately to pull students and nuns from windows as those classrooms partially filled with screaming children exploded. Firefighters noticed that the white shirts of children in the windows changed color and turned brown.

Shortly after the flashover, a wide portion of the school&#x27;s roof collapsed over rooms 208, 209, and part of 210, and the massive downward rush of heat likely killed several other students and their teachers in rooms 208 and 210 instantly (Room 209 lost only one child in the room itself, Beverly Burda, who had been overcome by smoke inhalation before the roof collapsed).

Inside the burning school, a quick-thinking nun rolled petrified children down a stairwell when fear made them freeze. Injured students were rushed to five different hospitals, some in the cars of strangers. Priests from the rectory raced to the scene, grabbing frightened students and escorting them through the smoke to the doors. One of the priests, Fr Joseph Ognibene, and Sam Tortorice, a parent of one of the students, were able to rescue most of the students in room 209 by passing them through a courtyard window on the second floor into the annex. Janitor James Raymond, though badly injured himself from a deep glass cut on his arm, worked in tandem with Fr Charles Hund to open a locked emergency door leading to a fire escape outside room 207. Thanks to their efforts, all of the students and their teacher, Sister Geraldita Ennis, were rescued from the room.

In room 212, which was located at the opposite end of the hallway from the source of the fire, flames did not actually invade the room, but the toxic smoke and heated gases penetrated here as much as in any other second-floor room, and just over half of the 55 students inside and their teacher, Sister Mary Clare Therese Champagne, succumbed to asphyxiation. When the Chicago Fire Department&#x27;s new &quot;snorkel&quot; unit arrived, this was one of the first rooms that it began pouring water into, lowering the temperature inside the room significantly, and the children who had not asphyxiated were then rescued by firefighters with ladders.

Glowacki took injured children into her candy store beside the school to escape the cold outdoor temperature while they awaited medical attention. Neighbors and parents raced into the school to rescue students on the lower floor or erect ladders outside that proved to be too short for the second floor. 74-year-old Ed Klock suffered a stroke while attempting to assist the children. Residents of houses along Avers Avenue opened their doors to provide sanctuary and warmth for the children.

Local radio and television reports soon broadcast the news across the city. WGN-AM radio broadcast continuous updates of the fire, with Chicago Police Officer Leonard Baldy providing observations from an overhead helicopter. Panicked mothers and fathers left their homes or workplaces and raced to the school. Mothers pleaded to enter the burning structure. A crowd of more than 5,000 anxious parents and onlookers had to be held back by police lines.

This number grew in the late afternoon as news of the disaster spread and bodies of victims were slowly removed by firemen. It was first hoped that fatalities might be relatively low, under the mistaken belief that the fire alarm had been sounded early enough. The toll climbed quickly once the blaze was partially extinguished and firemen were able to explore the building. National television networks interrupted their regular programming to announce details as the scope of the disaster widened.

Between the delayed discovery and reporting of the blaze and the misdirection of the response units to the wrong address, the firefighters arrived too late. Although they rescued more than 160 children from the inferno, many of the students carried out were already dead. Some of the bodies were so badly charred that they broke into pieces while being picked up. In room 212, none of the dead had been burned; the children who perished, as well as their teacher, all died of smoke inhalation.

==Hospitalization==
On December 5, 1958, 70 were listed as hospitalized, with 13 in critical condition. By December 6, 1958, the death count was 91. By December 9, the death count was 92; 57 people were in the hospital, with 11 of them in critical condition. In the case of the 92nd death, the hospital attempted to save one boy&#x27;s life with an artificial kidney, at the time the only such one available in Chicago. The 93rd death, of a girl, occurred on December 22, 1958. A girl with burns on more than 65% of her body died on March 5, 1959, making the death count 94, and was buried on March 9. After that death, three students were still hospitalized. The final deceased victim, a boy, died on August 9, 1959.

==Investigation==

The cause of the fire was never officially determined. In 1962, a boy, who was a student at Our Lady of the Angels at the time of the fire, confessed to setting the blaze. At the time of the fire, he was 10 years old and in fifth grade. A family court judge later concluded the evidence was insufficient to substantiate the confession. Officially, the cause of the fire remains unknown.

In 1959, the National Fire Protection Association&#x27;s report on the blaze blamed civic authorities and the Archdiocese of Chicago for &quot;housing children in structures which are &#x27;fire traps,&#x27;&quot; such as Our Lady of the Angels School.

Although Our Lady of the Angels School had passed a routine fire department safety inspection weeks before the disaster, the school was not legally bound to comply with all 1958 fire safety codes due to a grandfather clause in the 1949 standards. Existing older schools, such as Our Lady of the Angels, were not required to retrofit the safety devices that were required by code in all schools built after 1949.

==Victims==

All of the deceased (92 children and three nuns) lived in Chicago and occupied classrooms on the second floor of the north wing. All of those who perished on the day of the fire died when smoke, heat, fire, and toxic gases cut off their means of escape through corridors and stairways. Many more were injured, some severely, when they jumped from second-floor windows.

===Room 208===

Room 208, a room located in the northeast corner of the north wing housing Sister Mary St. Canice Lyng&#x27;s seventh grade class, had twelve student deaths out of forty-seven students. Several ladders were placed near Room 208&#x27;s windows. Of them, the ladder placed by Mario Camerini, a janitor, successfully reached Room 208&#x27;s windows and allowed several students, including all of the remaining boys, to escape. The three boys died at their desks due to a spurt of heated gases. The conditions of 208 and the three dead boys are depicted in a black-and-white illustration by a &quot;Life&quot; magazine artist. Sister Mary St. Canice also died.

===Room 209===

Room 209, a room housing Sister Mary Davidis Devine&#x27;s eighth grade class, had two student deaths. Of all of the students, one, Beverly Burda, died in the classroom, while a second, Valerie Thoma, died in a hospital three months later. The survivors credit Devine&#x27;s decision to stack books at the door to slow entry of the smoke and an awning that provided an easier jump for their survival. Sam Tortorice, a parent of Room 209 student Rose Tortorice, climbed on the awning to assist the escapes of the Room 209 students. Father Joseph Ognibene joined Tortorice and rescued students. Devine, mistakenly under the impression that all of the students were rescued from the room, agreed to be rescued. By the time Devine and the rescue crews noticed Burda lying in the classroom, conditions made her rescue impossible, and she was killed when the roof collapsed. Devine died on October 14, 2006, at the age of 100.

===Room 210===

Room 210, housing Sister Mary Seraphica Kelley&#x27;s fourth grade class, had 28 deaths out of the 57 students inside at the time of the fire. Kelley also died, making a total of 29 deaths in Room 210—the most deaths of any of the classrooms. The smaller and weaker bodies of the fourth graders contributed to the high death toll, as many of the children were unable to scale the window ledge. The fire entered the room at a quicker rate since two boys attempted to open the door to the room. Upon discovery of the fire, the flames forced the boys away from the door, preventing closure of the door and allowing the fire to reach the children.

===Room 211===

Room 211, housing Sister Mary Helaine O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s eighth grade class, had 24 deaths out of the 48 students inside at the time of the fire. Normally 63 students occupied the room; at the time, 13 boys helped with a clothing drive at the church and 2 male students stayed home that day due to illness. A picket fence blocked firefighters and hampered the rescue of the middle schoolers in 211. The firefighters could not save all of the students before the room flashed over, killing the remaining students. Sister Mary Helaine O&#x27;Neill, the teacher, was severely burned, but survived. She died on September 27, 1975.

===Room 212===

Room 212, housing Sister Mary Clare Therese Champagne&#x27;s fifth grade class, had 26 deaths out of the 55 students. The deaths were all due to smoke inhalation. Sister Mary Clare Therese also died. Life Magazine&#x27;s picture of a firefighter carrying the body of ten-year-old John Jajkowski, who died in Room 212, became world-famous and was later used as a fire-prevention poster.

==Responses==

The funeral for the three nuns took place first. A Requiem Mass was offered in Our Lady of the Angels Church after more than 2,000 parishioners paid their respects to the deceased teachers as the closed caskets lay in repose in the convent. A color guard of 100 police officers and firefighters accompanied the coffins into the church. More than 100 nuns from the order of the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary attended from across Illinois as well as from their Motherhouse in Dubuque, Iowa. The funeral procession had several hundred vehicles. The three teachers were interred side by side in a grave next to other nuns of their religious order at the Mount Carmel Cemetery in suburban Hillside, Illinois.

For 27 of the deceased students whose families accepted the offer to participate in it, a Solemn Requiem Mass and funeral service took place at the Illinois National Guard Armory , abutting Humboldt Park, as each of the parish churches in the archdiocese was not large enough to accommodate the huge crowd. Cardinal Francis Spellman, Archbishop of New York, came to Chicago to lend his support. On December 5, 38 burials took place at Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Hillside.

The families of the other children who were victims of the fire elected to bury their children privately. Many of the young students were buried in the &quot;Shrine of the Holy Innocents&quot; plot at Queen of Heaven Cemetery, which is adjacent to Mount Carmel Cemetery. A monument there lists the names of all 95 victims. Some of the students were buried in other cemeteries: 18 in St. Joseph Cemetery, 18 in St. Adalbert Cemetery, 12 in Mount Carmel Cemetery, 1 in St. Nicholas Cemetery, and 1 in Norway Cemetery in Norway, Michigan.

A relief fund was set up to assist distraught families and to care for injured children in future years. The Chicago metropolitan area rallied to provide support. Hollywood stars such as Jack Benny visited injured children in hospitals. A city newspaper, the &quot;Chicago American&quot;, devoted its entire front page on December 5, 1958, to photographs of the deceased students under the headline, &quot;Chicago Mourns&quot;.

Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley ordered flags across the city lowered to half staff.

==Legacy==

The fire was the primary current events story in the December 15, 1958 issue of &quot;LIFE&quot;, containing photographs from the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Lee Balterman and Art Shay and reconstructed drawings of the events in the classrooms by Franklin McMahon. The first page of the article featured an image of firefighter Richard Scheidt carrying the body of 10-year-old John Michael Jajkowski, Jr. from the building. The photograph of Jajkowski, a fifth grader in Room 212, later served as a fire prevention safety poster nationwide. Jajkowski, an accomplished musician, played the accordion and served as a church choir member, and had expressed a desire to become a priest. Like 25 of his other classmates, Jajkowski was suffocated by black, oily smoke and eventually died. Steve Lasker of the &quot;Chicago American&quot; took the photograph of Scheidt and Jajkowski as the fire department was beginning to achieve control over the fire.

In particular the fire affected the Italian American community in Chicago.

Carmen Mele, sibling of a fire victim, stated that the OLA community referred to the event as &quot;the fire&quot; with no other words, since &quot;There is no need to introduce the topic with another adjective.&quot;

After the Our Lady of the Angels School fire, Percy Bugbee, the president of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) said in an interview, &quot;There are no new lessons to be learned from this fire; only old lessons that tragically went unheeded.&quot; Sweeping changes in school fire safety regulations were enacted nationwide. Some 16,500 older school buildings in the United States were brought up to code within one year of the disaster.

Ordinances to strengthen Chicago&#x27;s fire code and new amendments to the Illinois state fire code were passed. The National Fire Protection Association estimated that about 68% of all U.S. communities inaugurated and completed fire safety improvements after the Our Lady of the Angels fire, one of which was an increased number of law-mandated fire drills throughout the academic year. In addition, fire investigators came from as far away as London to study the lessons that could be learned. 

The City Council of Chicago passed a law requiring that a fire alarm box be installed in front of schools and other public assembly venues. The interior fire alarm systems of these buildings must be connected to the street fire alarm box. Another requirement was that all schools where it was deemed vital would have sprinkler systems installed. However, nine months later, in September 1959, Fire Commissioner Quinn, when interviewed by WNBQ reporter Len O&#x27;Connor, admitted that although 400 of the 1040 schools in Chicago at that time had been deemed in critical need of sprinkler systems, only two actually had sprinklers installed.

OLA students attended classes that were taught by their own teachers in nearby public school facilities, including John Hay School, Rezin Orr School, Ryerson Elementary and Cameron Elementary until the new Our Lady of the Angels School was finished in time for the school year beginning in September 1960.

The ruins of the school were dismantled in 1959 and a new Our Lady of the Angels School, located at 3814 West Iowa Street, was constructed in compliance with the latest required fire safety standards, such as installing a sprinkler system. The modern three-story building with 32 classrooms plus a kindergarten opened in September 1960. Donations from around the world helped to fund the new construction.

As a result of a steady decline in enrollment during the 1990s, the Archdiocese of Chicago closed the school after the class of 1999 graduated. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that the fire &quot;knocked the neighborhood off track and prompted an exodus of many families to the suburbs, leaving poverty in their wake.&quot; The school building now housed the Galapagos Charter School until its 2016 disestablishment; The school building, in 2022, became a multipurpose and outreach center for Mission of Our Lady of Angels, which also remains in operation in the church building next door.

A memorial to the fire was installed at OLA church, moved to Church of the Holy Family in 1999, and reinstalled at OLA church in 2022.

There was a trust established to help fire victims. The funds depleted in 1994. Some survivors were not aware of its existence until shortly before the depletion.

The fire is considered a case study in the 2009 Edition of the NFPA &quot;Life Safety Code Handbook&quot;.

==Popular culture==

Some scenes from the 2003 movie &quot;Finding John Christmas&quot; are based on the OLA fire.

The documentary film &quot;Our Obligation&quot;, made by the Los Angeles Fire Department, is a dramatization of a &quot;similar&quot; disastrous school fire, explaining all the safety measures that should have been in place and functional. The filmmakers stated that the school in the film is not supposed to be OLA, but most of the details are identical, down to the iconic image of the dead student being carried out by the fireman. Additionally, the school depicted in the film is not a Catholic school like OLA, but a &quot;regular&quot; public elementary school with typical schoolteachers and students. This film was produced in 1959 during fire tests being made at Robert Louis Stevenson Junior High School located at 725 S. Indiana St. in East Los Angeles. The building (built in 1926) was scheduled for demolition due to seismic concerns, so the LAFD used a three-story section for the tests. The school building was replaced with a one-story structure.

The play entitled &quot;When Angels Wept&quot; by playwright Charles Grippo had two productions in Chicago in 2013 and was based on the Our Lady of the Angels School fire. The story is centered around a small group of survivors of the fire and how the tragedy affected their lives until today.

The fire has been chronicled in several books, including &quot;The Immaculate Deception&quot; by Robert Chiappetta (Page Publishing, Inc., 2015), &quot;The Fire That Will Not Die&quot; by Michele McBride (ETC Publications, 1979), &quot;To Sleep with the Angels&quot; by David Cowen and John Kuenster (Ivan R. Dee, 2003), &quot;Remembrances of the Angels&quot; by John Kuenster (Ivan R. Dee, 2008), &quot;Unwanted&quot; by Mary E. Sandford (Ambassador International, 2019) and a 2003 Emmy-winning television documentary, &quot;Angels Too Soon&quot;, produced by WTTW Channel 11 Chicago. The History Channel also featured the disaster in the television documentary &quot;Hellfire&quot;, which was an episode in the cable network&#x27;s &quot;Wrath of God&quot; series.

One of the students who survived the fire was 8-year-old third-grader Jonathan Friga, who would go on to fame as Jonathan Cain, keyboard and rhythm guitarist for the rock band Journey. Cain later referenced the fire in the lyrics of the Journey song &quot;Ask The Lonely&quot;:

<text>Voskhod () is the name of several types of motorcycles produced at the Degtyaryov Plant in the Russian town of Kovrov since 1965.

All Voskhod motorcycles had a single-cylinder two-stroke engine with a displacement of 175 cm3.

Between 1973 and 1979 Voskhod was one of the makes marketed by SATRA in the United Kingdom as Cossack motorcycles.

The Voskhod was introduced in 1957. For many this was a luxury model of the Minsk (125cc) K-55. In 1964 the Voskhod was made in a racing version.

==In popular culture==
In Ken Follett&#x27;s &quot;The Edge of Eternity – The Century Trilogy 3&quot;, this is the motorcycle owned by character Dmitri Dvorkijn (Dimka). Early on in the book, Dmitri rides it when he is saving his sister Tanja in 1961. The Voskhod is presented here as a motorcycle for the privileged.

<text>Uskhal Khan (Mongolian: Усхал; Mongolian script: ; ), also called the Last Lord of Northern Yuan () or by his era name the Tianyuan Emperor (), born Tögüs Temür (; 7 March 1342 – 18 November 1388), was an emperor of the Northern Yuan dynasty, reigning from 1378 to 1388. He was the last powerful khagan of the Mongols until Dayan Khan.

Tögüs Temür was the younger brother of Biligtü Khan (Emperor Zhaozong) and son of Toghon Temür (Emperor Huizong), the last Yuan emperor. Before ascending to the Northern Yuan throne, he held the noble title of Prince of Yi (益王). He succeeded to the throne with the title of Uskhal Khan after Biligtü Khan died in 1378. During the funeral of the late emperor, the Ming court sent an embassy to participate in it and released the Northern Yuan prince, Maidarbal, who had been captured at the battle of Yingchang in 1378.

Uskhal Khan Tögüs Temür mobilized troops near Yingchang and Karakorum. He continued to press the Ming dynasty from the north, cooperating with Naghachu of the Jalayir in Manchuria. The Ming launched a massive attack on the Northern Yuan in return in 1380, sacking Karakorum. 

The Ming army crushed the Northern Yuan garrison under Iliyasan in northern China in June 1380. Uskhal Khan&#x27;s commanders, Öljei-Buqa and Nair-Buqa, invaded Lulun city, killing the Ming officer Liu Guang in the same year. The Ming dispatched a large army against the Northern Yuan the next year.

The Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty decided to exterminate Naghachu&#x27;s force in Manchuria in 1387 and two sides suffered heavier losses at a battle near Changchung city. Tögüs Temür suddenly faced a predicament in 1387 when Naghachu surrendered to the Ming due to a devastating famine. The Ming now turned their attention to the Uskhal Khan Tögüs Temür who lived in Yingchang. In 1388, he was raided by the Ming on the Buir Lake. In his escape to Karakorum, he was suddenly attacked and defeated on the Tuul River by Yesüder, a descendant of Ariq Böke, who allied with the Oirats. Yesüder&#x27;s general killed the king and his son. Uskhal Khan had intended to flee westwards to join his commander Markhas. This event marked the decline of the Kublaid power and the rise of the Oirats on the Mongolian Plateau.

<doc id="578838" wikidata="Q5075174" url="?curid=578838" title="Charles Arbuthnot">
<text>Charles Arbuthnot (14 March 1767 – 18 August 1850) was a British diplomat and Tory politician. He was Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire between 1804 and 1807 and held a number of political offices. He was a good friend of the Duke of Wellington. His second wife, Harriet, became a hostess at Wellington&#x27;s society dinners, and wrote an important diary cataloging contemporary political intrigues.

==Background==
Arbuthnot was son of John Arbuthnot, FRS of Rockfleet, and his wife Anne Stone, daughter of the banker Robert Stone; he was brother of bishop Alexander Arbuthnot, General Sir Thomas Arbuthnot and General Sir Robert Arbuthnot. He was born in Rockfleet, County Mayo, Ireland, but much of his upbringing was with Andrew Stone, his mother&#x27;s relation. He was educated at Westminster School, and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford in 1784, graduating B.A. in 1788. He then went on a Grand Tour.

==Political and diplomatic career to 1804==
Arbuthnot joined the Foreign Office in 1793, where he impressed William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville. He sat as Member of Parliament for East Looe between 1795 and 1796, after William Wellesley Pole stepped down because he could not support the war policies of William Pitt the younger.

Arbuthnot also held a number of diplomatic postings, notably as consul general in Portugal between 1800 and 1801, as Minister to Sweden. He served under Henry Addington as Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs between November 1803 and June 1804. In 1804 he was sworn of the Privy Council.

==In Constantinople==
Appointed on 6 June 1804 as Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Arbuthnot was the first ambassador in Constantinople under a new arrangement, whereby the Levant Company provided a consul-general, in this case Isaac Morier, who saw to commercial work. In 1806 Arbuthnot negotiated a trade treaty with the Reis ül-Küttab, Ahmed Vâsıf. He travelled out with William Pole-Tylney, nephew to Arthur and Richard Wellesley.

Arbuthnot was tasked in the early days of 1807 to bring Selim III into the Anglo-Russian camp opposed to France. He was unable to do that. In the context of a renewed Russo-Turkish War and tariff evasion under the commercial treaty, Arbuthnot pursued his own line, prepared to use force. 

Selim with Horace Sébastiani successfully resisted a British naval expedition in the Dardanelles operation. Arbuthnot left Constantinople on 29 January 1807.

==Politics to 1812==
Arbuthnot was Member of Parliament for Eye between 1809 and 1812, taking up the seat when Henry Wellesley resigned. He became Secretary to the Treasury in 1809, and began attempts to manage public opinion for the government, by centralising management of the press.

Under Spencer Perceval, and then Lord Liverpool, Arbuthnot was Joint Secretary to the Treasury between 1809 and 1823.

==The Liverpool ministry==
Arbuthnot sat for Orford between 1812 and 1818, a pocket borough of the 2nd Marquess of Hertford, in a deal with the Liverpool ministry on behalf of Edmond Alexander MacNaghten. Arbuthnot and Robert Jenkinson, later Lord Liverpool, had known each other in college days at Christ Church.

Arbuthnot held the position of Patronage Secretary, and also played the role of &quot;general cabinet fixer&quot;. In September 1812, John McMahon, private secretary to the Prince Regent, tried Arbuthnot in an attempt to shut down a series of scurrilous articles in the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot;. They purported to be an epic and extended review of a poem by Charlotte Dacre on the Prince and his circle, and referenced the Prince&#x27;s affair with the Marchioness of Hertford. These squibs have been attributed by David V. Erdman to Lord Byron. Liverpool disapproved of the subsidy Arbuthnot was giving Lewis Goldsmith, founder of &quot;The Anti-Gallican Monitor&quot;, a project of 1811 of Arbuthnot and John Charles Herries; and ran it down, ending it in 1814.

During Arbuthnot&#x27;s time in charge of patronage, a Treasury appointment, over 2,000 sinecure posts were abolished. He noted the effect the reforms were having on his influence on Members of Parliament. He is taken to have been the &quot;de facto&quot; Tory whip. The responsibility for party discipline was only later recognised by a seat in the Cabinet.

Subsequently Arbuthnot sat for St Germans between 1818 and 1827. The constituency was controlled by John Eliot, 2nd Baron Eliot (as he was in 1818). Under Liverpool he was First Commissioner of Woods and Forests between 1823 and 1827.

==Later life and death==
Arbuthnot was Member of Parliament for St Ives between 1828 and 1830 and for Ashburton between 1830 and 1831. At St Ives he was the favoured successor of Sir Christopher Hawkins, 1st Baronet. For a time in 1828 a rival candidate was promoted, Guy Lenox Prendergast, but he withdrew before the poll. Ashburton was controlled by landlords Robert Trefusis, 18th Baron Clinton and Sir Lawrence Vaughan Palk. Arbuthnot was elected with Palk in 1830, and resigned in 1831.

Under Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, Arbuthnot was First Commissioner of Woods and Forests in 1828 and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster between 1828 and 1830. In the 1830s he remained a major figure in the party management of the Tories, working with John Charles Herries, William Holmes and Joseph Planta.

During the last years of Arbuthnot&#x27;s life, after the death of his second wife Harriet, he turned over the family home to his eldest son, and moved into the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s London residence, Apsley House, as his confidential friend. Their story is told in &quot;Wellington and the Arbuthnots&quot; by E. A. Smith.

Charles Arbuthnot died at Apsley House in August 1850, aged 83. Spiridione Gambardella&#x27;s portrait of him is kept there. He was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery.

==Personal life and family==

Arbuthnot was first married on 28 February 1799 to Marcia Mary Anne Clapcott Lisle, at Cholmondeley House, Piccadilly. She had been Lady-in-Waiting since 1795 to Caroline of Brunswick, Princess of Wales. She died in Constantinople on 24 May 1806.

Arbuthnot married a second time on 31 January 1814 at Fulbeck, Lincolnshire, to Harriet Fane (1793–1834), daughter of the Hon. Henry Fane. Harriet was fascinated by politics. During her marriage to Arbuthnot, she became a hostess at society dinners given by Arbuthnot&#x27;s good friend, the Duke of Wellington. Smith rejects the suggestion that Harriet was Wellington&#x27;s mistress. Her diaries were published as &quot;The Journal of Mrs Arbuthnot&quot; in 1950.

With his first wife Marcia, Arbuthnot&#x27;s children were:

* Charles George James Arbuthnot (1799–1870). He married Charlotte Eliza Vivian, daughter of Hussey Vivian, 1st Baron Vivian.
* Caroline Emma Arbuthnot (1802–1852)
* Henry Arbuthnot (1803–1875), married in 1830 Charlotte Rachael Scott, daughter of Thomas Scott, 2nd Earl of Clonmell.
* Marcia Emma Georgiana Arbuthnot (1804–1878), who married William Cholmondeley, 3rd Marquess of Cholmondeley.

Arbuthnot had an illegitimate son, from the days before he first married, mentioned in correspondence with his clerical friend John Sneyd (1763–1835), brother of Walter Sneyd. These letters discuss also his nickname &quot;Gosh&quot;, which spread from his familiar circle to being generally used, and mistaken for his surname; and his interest in John de Mainauduc, Irish-Huguenot practitioner of animal magnetism. Of Arthur Paget, Arbuthnot&#x27;s replacement in 1807 at Constantinople, George Canning as incoming Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the second Portland administration wrote &quot;I must send him to repair if possible the mischief poor Gosh has been doing there.&quot;

<text>The Minor Planet Center (MPC) is the official body for observing and reporting on minor planets under the auspices of the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Founded in 1947, it operates at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.

==Function==
The Minor Planet Center is the official worldwide organization in charge of collecting observational data for minor planets (such as asteroids), calculating their orbits and publishing this information via the &quot;Minor Planet Circulars&quot;. Under the auspices of the International Astronomical Union (IAU), it operates at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, which is part of the Center for Astrophysics along with the Harvard College Observatory.

The MPC runs a number of free online services for observers to assist them in observing minor planets and comets. The complete catalogue of minor planet orbits (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Minor Planet Catalogue&quot;) may also be freely downloaded. In addition to astrometric data, the MPC collects light curve photometry of minor planets. A key function of the MPC is helping observers coordinate follow up observations of possible near-Earth objects (NEOs) via its NEO web form and blog, the Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page. The MPC is also responsible for identifying, and alerting to, new NEOs with a risk of impacting Earth in the few weeks following their discovery &quot;(see Potentially hazardous objects and )&quot;.

== History ==

The Minor Planet Center was set up at the University of Cincinnati in 1947, under the direction of Paul Herget. Upon Herget&#x27;s retirement on June 30, 1978, the MPC was moved to the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, under the direction of Brian G. Marsden. From 2006 to 2015, the director of the MPC was Timothy Spahr, who oversaw a staff of five. From 2015 to 2021, the Minor Planet Center was headed by interim director Matthew Holman. Under his leadership, the MPC experienced a significant period of reorganization and growth, doubling both its staff size and the volume of observations processed per year. Upon Holman&#x27;s resignation on February 9, 2021 (announced on February 19, 2021) Matthew Payne became acting director of the MPC.

=== Directors ===
* 1947–1978: Paul Herget
* 1978–2006: Brian Marsden
* 2006–2015: Timothy Spahr
* 2015–2021: Matthew Holman
* 2021–present: Matthew Payne

== Periodical publications ==
The MPC periodically releases astrometric observations of minor planets, as well as of comets and natural satellites. These publications are the Minor Planet Circulars (MPCs), the Minor Planet Electronic Circulars (MPECs), and the Minor Planet Supplements (MPSs and MPOs). An extensive archive of publications in a PDF format is available at the Minor Planet Center&#x27;s website. The archive&#x27;s oldest publication dates back to 1 November 1977 (MPC 4937–5016). 
* Minor Planet Circulars (M.P.C. or MPCs), established 1947, is a scientific journal that is generally published by the Minor Planet Center on the date of each full moon, when the number of reported observations are minimal due to the brighter night sky. The &quot;Circulars&quot; contain astrometric observations, orbits and ephemerides of minor planets, comets and certain natural satellites. The astrometric observations of comets are published in full, while the minor planet observations are summarised by observatory code (the full observations now being given in the &quot;Minor Planet Circulars&quot; Supplement). New numberings and namings of minor planets &quot;(also see Naming of Minor Planets)&quot;, as well as numberings of periodic comets and natural satellites, are announced in the &quot;Circulars&quot;. New orbits for comets and natural satellites appear in the &quot;Circulars&quot;; new orbits for minor planets appear in the Minor Planets and Comets Orbit Supplement &quot;(see below)&quot;.
* The Minor Planet Electronic Circulars (MPECs) are published by the Minor Planet Center. They generally contain positional observations and orbits of unusual minor planets and all comets. Monthly lists of observable unusual objects, observable distant objects, observable comets and the critical list of numbered minor planets also appear on these circulars. Daily Orbit Update MPECs, issued every day, contain new identifications and orbits of minor planets, obtained over the previous 24 hours.
* The Minor Planets and Comets Supplement (MPS) is published on behalf of IAU&#x27;s Division F (Planetary Systems and Bioastronomy) by the Minor Planet Center.
* The Minor Planets and Comets Orbit Supplement (MPO) is published on behalf of IAU&#x27;s Division F by the Minor Planet Center.

== Natural Satellites Ephemeris Service ==

The Natural Satellites Ephemeris Service is an online service of the Minor Planet Center. The service provides &quot;ephemerides, orbital elements and residual blocks for the outer irregular satellites of the giant planets&quot;.

<text>The United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) was a body under the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) tasked with overseeing the outcomes of the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development/Earth Summit. It was replaced in 2013 by the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, which meets both under the General Assembly every four years and the ECOSOC in other years.

The CSD was established in December 1992 by General Assembly Resolution A/RES/47/191 as a functional commission of the UN Economic and Social Council, implementing a recommendation in Chapter 38 of Agenda 21, the landmark global agreement reached at the June 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development/Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

==CSD 1==
CSD 1, the first or &quot;Organizational&quot; session of the CSD, was held in New York in June 1993. The Organizational Session focused on a broad range of organizational and administrative issues, reflected in topics of the commission&#x27;s documents :

*Budget implications of draft decisions
*Establishing a provisional agenda and a multi-year programme of work
*National reporting on implementation of Agenda 21
*Information exchange: UN System and donors
*UNCED follow-up: international organizations and UN coordination
*Coordination of development data
*Progress in environmentally sound technology transfer
*Government information on financial commitments
*Urgent and major emergent issues
*United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and Agenda 21 implementation
*UNEP and Agenda 21 implementation
*Future work
*Guidelines for national reporting
*Integrating sustainable development into the UN system

==CSD 5==

In its Fifth Session, the principal focus of the CSD was to prepare for the Five-Year Review of the 1992 Earth Summit, which took the form of the 19th Special Session of the General Assembly, held at UN Headquarters in New York.

==CSD 10/World Summit on Sustainable Development==

For its Tenth Session the CSD served as the Preparatory Committee for the World Summit on Sustainable Development, held in Johannesburg, South Africa, in December 2002.

&quot;See the full article World Summit on Sustainable Development&quot;

==CSD 12==

The Twelfth Session of the CSD is the first substantive session since the Johannesburg Summit - CSD-11 was an organizational session that focused on establishing priorities and an agenda for the second ten-year cycle of the commission. Text below in &quot;quotes&quot; is from the introductory note from the chair - H.E. Børge Brende, Norwegian Minister of the Environment to a description of the organization of work during CSD-12 

:&quot;The first three days of CSD-12 will serve as the preparatory meeting for the ten-year review of the Barbados Programme of Action (BPoA) for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States.

:The bulk of CSD-12 will focus on water, sanitation and human settlements. &quot;The decision of CSD-11 to focus its first Implementation Cycle on Water, Sanitation and Human Settlements bears testimony to the sense of urgency the international community ascribes to these issues.&quot;

:&quot;Today, water-borne diseases kill a person every ten seconds, the overwhelming majority children, and roughly one in two Sub-Saharan Africans and three in five South Asians lack adequate sanitation. The total number of people living in slums is close to 930 million and is growing at an accelerated rate.&quot;

:&quot;The CSD-12 Review Session will feature a number of “firsts”. Thematic reviews will feature interactive discussions and will be introduced through keynote presentations, panel discussions and moderated debates. Major Group representatives will join Ministers in interactive dialogues during the High-Level Segment.&quot;

== CSD 16 ==
The chair was H.E. Francis Nhema, Zimbabwe&#x27;s Minister of Environment and Tourism.

== CSD 18 ==
The 18th session took place in New York in May 2010, focusing on transport, chemicals, waste management, mining, and the ten-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production patterns (SCP).

== CSD 19 ==
The 19th session took place in May 2011, as part of the policy cycle from the previous year. No agreement was reached in the negotiations and they eventually collapsed.

== United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development ==
CSD 20 was suspended from its normal rotation, planned in 2012 because the General Assembly had resolved to hold the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio as the 20th anniversary to the original conference. United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development would focus on two themes:
# Green economy within the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication.
# Institutional framework for sustainable development.
With the objectives:
# Securing renewed political commitment to sustainable development.
# Assessing the progress and implementation gaps in meeting already agreed commitments.
# Addressing new and emerging challenges.

== CSD 20 ==

Member states decided in resolution 67/203 of 21 December 2012 that the CSD would have its last session immediately prior to the convening of the first meeting of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in order to ensure a smooth institutional transition. CSD-20 took place in the morning of 20 September 2013.

<doc id="578888" wikidata="Q1754273" url="?curid=578888" title="The Second Coming (poem)">
<text>“The Second Coming” is a poem written by Irish poet William Butler Yeats in 1919, first printed in &quot;The Dial&quot; in November 1920 and included in his 1921 collection of verses &quot;Michael Robartes and the Dancer&quot;. The poem uses Christian imagery regarding the Apocalypse and Second Coming to describe allegorically the atmosphere of post-war Europe. It is considered a canonical work of modernist poetry and has been reprinted in several collections, including &quot;The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry&quot;.

==Historical context==
The poem was written in 1919 in the aftermath of the First World War and the beginning of the Irish War of Independence in January 1919, which followed the Easter Rising in April 1916, and before the British government had decided to send in the Black and Tans to Ireland. Yeats used the phrase &quot;the second birth&quot; instead of &quot;the Second Coming&quot; in his first drafts.

Yeats&#x27;s cosmology is laid out in his book &quot;A Vision&quot;, where he explained his views on history and how it informed his poetry. Yeats saw human history as a series of epochs, what he called &quot;gyres.&quot; He saw the age of classical antiquity as beginning with the Trojan War and then that thousand year cycle was overtaken by the Christian era, which is coming to a close. And that is the basis of the final line of the poem: &quot;And what rough beast, its hour come round at last / Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?&quot;

The poem is also connected to the 1918–1919 flu pandemic. In the weeks preceding Yeats′s writing of the poem, his pregnant wife, Georgie, caught the virus and was very close to death, but she survived. The highest death rates of the pandemic were among pregnant women, who in some areas had a death rate of up to 70%. Yeats wrote the poem while his wife was convalescing.

==Critical engagement==
In 2009, David A. Ross identified &quot;The Second Coming&quot; as &quot;one of the most famous poems in the English language,&quot; echoing Harold Bloom who, in 1986, cited the piece as &quot;one of the most universally admired poems of our century.&quot; 

Critics agree that the poetry of Percy Shelley had a strong influence on the drafting of &quot;The Second Coming.&quot; The first stanza matches the tone, diction, and syntax of &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot;. Both Harold Bloom and Jon Stallworthy speculate that the poem&#x27;s sphinx draws on the imagery of Shelley&#x27;s Ozymandias.

Critics have also argued that &quot;The Second Coming&quot; describes what Yeats elsewhere called an &quot;antithetical dispensation&quot; to the age ushered in by the birth of Jesus Christ. Richard Ellmann understood the &quot;rough beast&quot; of the final lines as a creature to be born itself in Bethlehem, marking the cyclical (and violent) overturning of an age. Giorgio Melchiori identified this same idea in Yeats&#x27; other writings, noting that

&quot;(1) by 1896 Yeats had already some inkling of the cyclical theory of history which he was later to develop and expound in &quot;A Vision&quot;; (2) The Trojan war, the birth of Christ, and an indefinite event due to happen in our century were already considered by him as three fundamental crises in world history, each of which reverse the established order and ushered in a new cycle of civilization . . .&quot;

==Cultural influences==
=== Titles ===
Phrases in the poem have been adopted as the title in a variety of media. The words &quot;things fall apart&quot; in the third line are alluded to by Chinua Achebe in his novel &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; (1958), The Roots in their album &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; (1999), and Jon Ronson in his podcast series &quot;Things Fell Apart&quot; (2021). 

Similarly, the words &quot;the centre cannot hold&quot; in the same line are used in the title of Elyn Saks&#x27; book about her experience with schizophrenia while obtaining her PhD at Oxford, and later her JD at Yale, &quot;The Center Cannot Hold: My Journey Through Madness&quot; (2008), Jonathan Alter&#x27;s book on U.S. President Barack Obama&#x27;s first term, &quot;The Center Holds&quot; (2013), the Netflix biographical documentary &quot;Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold&quot; (2017), Sleater-Kinney&#x27;s album &quot;The Center Won&#x27;t Hold&quot; (2019), and Junkie XL&#x27;s song &quot;The Center Will Not Hold, Twenty Centuries Of Stony Sleep&quot; in the film &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot; (2021). 

Additionally, the phrase &quot;slouches towards Bethlehem&quot; in the last line is referenced in the title of Joan Didion&#x27;s collection of essays &quot;Slouching Towards Bethlehem&quot; (1968), Joni Mitchell&#x27;s musical adaptation of the poem &quot;Slouching Towards Bethlehem&quot; (1991), Robert Bork&#x27;s non-fiction work &quot;Slouching Towards Gomorrah&quot; (1996), Daniel Ravipinto and Star Foster’s interactive fiction game &quot;Slouching Towards Bedlam&quot; (2003), and Brad DeLong&#x27;s economic history &quot;Slouching Towards Utopia&quot; (2022). 

Other works whose titles come from lines in the poem includes Walker Percy’s novel &quot;The Second Coming&quot; (1980), Robert B. Parker&#x27;s novel &quot;The Widening Gyre&quot; (1983), and multiple songs in Moby&#x27;s album &quot;Everything Was Beautiful, and Nothing Hurt&quot; (2018).
The whole poem was put to music by Joni Mitchell in her song &#x27;Slouching Towards Bethlehem&#x27; on her album &#x27;Night Ride Home&#x27;, released in 1991.

=== Quotes ===

<text>Vladimir (, , pre-1918 orthography: ) is a masculine given name of Slavic origin, widespread throughout all Slavic nations in different forms and spellings. The earliest record of a person with the name is Vladimir of Bulgaria ().

==Etymology==
The Old East Slavic form of the name is Володимѣръ &quot;Volodiměr&quot;, while the Old Church Slavonic form is &quot;Vladiměr&quot;. According to Max Vasmer, the name is composed of Slavic владь &quot;vladĭ&quot; &quot;to rule&quot; and &quot;*mēri&quot; &quot;great&quot;, &quot;famous&quot; (related to Gothic element &quot;mērs&quot;, &quot;-mir&quot;, c.f. Theode&quot;mir&quot;, Vala&quot;mir&quot;).

The modern (pre-1918) Russian forms Владимиръ and Владиміръ are based on the Church Slavonic one, with the replacement of мѣръ by миръ or міръ resulting from a folk etymological association with миръ &quot;peace&quot; or міръ &quot;world&quot;.

The Bolshevik reform of Russian spelling in 1918 abolished the orthographic distinction between (peace) and (universe, world): both are now spelled as , so the name came to be spelled Владимир.

Its Germanic relative, Waldemar, almost exactly shares the same meaning with the name Robert.

==History==
The earliest known record of this name was the name of Vladimir-Rasate (died 893), ruler of the First Bulgarian Empire. Vladimir-Rasate was the second Bulgarian ruler following the Christianization of Bulgaria and the introduction of Old Church Slavonic as the language of church and state. The name of his pre-Christian dynastic predecessor, khan &quot;Malamir&quot; (r. 831–836), sometimes claimed as the first Bulgarian ruler with a Slavic name, already exhibits the (presumably Gothic) &quot;-mir&quot; suffix.

The name Vladimir also gave rise to an East Slavic adaptation, &quot;Vladimir&quot; () or &quot;Volodimir&quot; (). Following the Christianization of Kievan Rus&#x27; in 988 during the reign of Vladimir the Great, the name Vladimir, along with other pagan names, was gradually replaced with Christian names, although the name Vladimir retained its popularity within the princely family in the following centuries.

Three successors of Vladimir the Great shared his given name: Vladimir II Monomakh (1053–1125), Vladimir III Mstislavich (1132–1173) and Vladimir IV Rurikovich (1187–1239). The town Volodymyr in north-western Ukraine was founded by Vladimir and is named after him. The foundation of another town, Vladimir in Russia, is usually attributed to Vladimir II Monomakh. However some researchers argue that it was also founded by Vladimir the Great. The veneration of Vladimir the Great as a saint of the Russian Orthodox Church gave rise to the replacement of the East Slavic form of his name with the Old Church Slavonic (Old Bulgarian) one . The immense importance of Vladimir the Great as national and religious founder resulted in &quot;Vladimir&quot; becoming one of the most frequently-given Russian names. 

==Variants==
The Slavic name survives in two traditions, the Old Church Slavonic one using the vocalism &quot;Vladi-&quot; and the Old East Slavic one in the vocalism &quot;Volodi-&quot;.

The Old Church Slavonic form &quot;Vladimir&quot; (Владимир) is used in Russian, Bulgarian, Serbian, and Macedonian, borrowed into Slovenian, Croatian &quot;Vladimir&quot;, Czech and Slovak &quot;Vladimír&quot;.

The &quot;polnoglasie&quot; &quot;-olo-&quot; of Old East Slavic form &quot;Vladimir&quot; (Владимиръ) (likely pronounced as &quot;Volodymyr&quot;) persists in the Ukrainian form &quot;Volodymyr&quot; (Володимир), borrowed into Slovak &quot;Volodymýr&quot;.

Historical diminutive forms include: Vladimirko (Russian), Volodymyrko (Ukrainian).

In Belarusian the name is spelled Uladzimir (Uładzimir, Уладзімір)&quot; or &quot;Uladzimier (Uładzimier, Уладзімер)&quot;.

In Polish, the name is spelled &quot;Włodzimierz.&quot;

In Russian, shortened and endeared versions of the name are Volodya (and variants with diminutive suffixes: Volod&#x27;ka, Volodyen&#x27;ka, Volodechka etc.), Vova (and diminutives: Vovka, Vovochka, etc.), Vovchik, Vovan. In West and South Slavic countries, other short versions are used: e.g., Vlade, Vlado, Vlada, Vladica, Vladko, Vlatko, Vlajko, Vladan, Władek, Wlodik and Włodek.

The Germanic form, Waldemar or Woldemar, is sometimes traced to Valdemar I of Denmark (1131–1182) named after his Russian maternal grandfather, Vladimir II Monomakh. The Germanic name is reflected in Latvian Voldemārs and Finnic (Finnish and Estonian) &quot;Voldemar&quot;.

The Greek form is &quot;Vladimiros&quot; (Βλαδίμηρος). The name is most common in Northern Greece especially among the Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia. Diminutives of the name among these Slavic speakers are &quot;Vlade&quot; and &quot;Mire&quot;.

Wladimir for an alternative spelling of the name.

<text>The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is a ligament in each knee of humans and various other animals. It works as a counterpart to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). It connects the posterior intercondylar area of the tibia to the medial condyle of the femur. This configuration allows the PCL to resist forces pushing the tibia posteriorly relative to the femur.

The PCL and ACL are intracapsular ligaments because they lie deep within the knee joint. They are both isolated from the fluid-filled synovial cavity, with the synovial membrane wrapped around them. The PCL gets its name by attaching to the posterior portion of the tibia.

The PCL, ACL, MCL, and LCL are the four main ligaments of the knee in primates.

==Structure==
The PCL is located within the knee joint where it stabilizes the articulating bones, particularly the femur and the tibia, during movement. It originates from the lateral edge of the medial femoral condyle and the roof of the intercondyle notch then stretches, at a posterior and lateral angle, toward the posterior of the tibia just below its articular surface.

==Function==
Although each PCL is a unified unit, they are described as separate anterolateral and posteromedial sections based on where each section&#x27;s attachment site and function. During knee joint movement, the PCL rotates such that the anterolateral section stretches in knee flexion but not in knee extension and the posteromedial bundle stretches in extension rather than flexion.

The function of the PCL is to prevent the femur from sliding off the anterior edge of the tibia and to prevent the tibia from displacing posterior to the femur. The posterior cruciate ligament is located within the knee. Ligaments are sturdy bands of tissues that connect bones. Similar to the anterior cruciate ligament, the PCL connects the femur to the tibia.

==Clinical significance==
Common causes of injuries are direct blows to the flexed knee, such as the knee hitting the dashboard in a car accident or falling hard on the knee, both instances displacing the tibia posterior to the femur.

An additional test of posterior cruciate ligament injury is the &quot;posterior sag test&quot;, where, in contrast to the drawer test, no active force is applied. Rather, the person lies supine with the leg held by another person so that the hip is flexed to 90 degrees and the knee 90 degrees. The main parameter in this test is &quot;step-off&quot;, which is the shortest distance from the femur to a hypothetical line that tangents the surface of the tibia from the tibial tuberosity and upwards. Normally, the &quot;step-off&quot; is approximately 1 cm, but is decreased (Grade I) or even absent (Grade II) or inverse (Grade III) in injuries to the posterior cruciate ligament. The posterior drawer test is one of the tests used by doctors and physiotherapists to detect injury to the PCL. Patients who are suspected to have a posterior cruciate ligament injury should always be evaluated for other knee injuries that often occur in combination with an PCL injuries. These include cartilage/meniscus injuries, bone bruises, ACL tears, fractures, posterolateral injuries and collateral ligament injuries.

There are four different grades of classification in which medical doctors classify a PCL injury: 
:Grade I, the PCL has a slight tear. 
:Grade II, the PCL ligament is minimally torn and becomes loose. 
:Grade III, the PCL is torn completely and the knee can now be categorized as unstable. 
:Grade IV, the ligament is damaged along with another ligament housed in the knee (i.e. ACL). 
With these grades of PCL injuries, there are different treatments available for such injuries.

===Mechanism===
In this position, the PCL functions to prevent movement of the tibia in the posterior direction and to prevent the tilting or shifting of the patella. However, the respective laxity of the two sections makes the PCL susceptible to injury during hyperflexion, hyperextension, and in a mechanism known as a dashboard injury. Because ligaments are viscoelastic) they can handle higher amounts of stress only when the load is increased slowly. When hyperflexion and hyperextension occur suddenly in combination with this viscoelastic behavior, the PCL deforms or tears. In the third and most common mechanism, the dashboard injury mechanism, the knee experiences impact in a posterior direction during knee flexion toward the space above the tibia. These mechanisms occur in excessive external tibial rotation and during falls that induce a combination of extension and adduction of the tibia, which is referred to as varus-extension stress, or that occur while the knee is flexed.

===Treatment===
It is possible for the PCL to heal on its own. Even if the PCL does not heal normally, it is unusual for surgery to be required. Treatment is usually physiotherapy to strengthen the muscles around the knee; usually they provide adequate stability even without a functional PCL. Only if there are ongoing symptoms down the track, or if there are other injuries in the knee (e.g. posterolateral corner injury) will ligament reconstruction be required. Ligament reconstruction is used to replace the torn PCL with a new ligament, which is usually a graft taken from the hamstring or Achilles tendon from a host cadaver. An arthroscope allows a complete evaluation of the entire knee joint, including the knee cap (patella), the cartilage surfaces, the meniscus, the ligaments (ACL &amp; PCL), and the joint lining. Then, the new ligament is attached to the bone of the thigh and lower leg with screws to hold it in place. Surgery to repair the posterior cruciate ligament is controversial due to its placement and technical difficulty.

It is possible for the PCL to heal on its own without surgery when it is a Grade I or Grade II injury. PCL injuries that are diagnosed in these categories can have their recovery times reduced by performing certain rehabilitative exercises. Fernandez and Pugh(2012) found that following a PCL grade II diagnosis, a treatment that spanned the course of 8 weeks consisting of chiropractic lumbopelvic manipulation, physiotherapy, and implementing an exercise program that emphasized eccentric muscle contraction (lunges, 1-leg squats, and trunk stabilization proved to be an effective way to recover from the PCL injury. For Grades III and IV, operative surgery is recommended or is usually needed. Grafts is the method when addressing PCL injuries that are in need of operative surgery. With grafts, there are different methods such as the tibial inlay or tunnel method.

==Other animals==
In the quadruped stifle (analogous to the human knee), based on its anatomical position, it is referred to as the caudal cruciate ligament.

<doc id="578909" wikidata="Q5183695" url="?curid=578909" title="Credenza desk">
<text>A credenza desk (often simply, credenza) is a modern desk form usually placed next to a wall as a secondary work surface to that of another desk, such as a pedestal desk, in a typical executive office. 
==Uses==
===As an active work surface===
When used as an active work surface, the credenza desk is often placed against the wall immediately behind or perpendicular to the main desk, but close enough that the user can reach it from the seated position at the main desk by simply swivelling and wheeling their office chair over to it. It would typically be used for extra storage as well as an open work surface for paperwork, filing, or other tasks taking up more room than would be practical at the main desk (often due to the presence of a computer).

The credenza desk is often used as a computer desk, thus leaving the possibility of keeping the surface of the main desk completely free, when this is required. An executive desk is often the central artifact for a meeting between several persons. A computer monitor or a printer or even a simple keyboard on the surface can be impediments to the exchange.
===Less frequent usage===
When its planned use is to be less frequent, such as holding books or files which are not regularly referenced, or to act as an extra surface to help facilitate larger meetings, credenza desks are often placed on a wall in some other location of the office, such as adjacent to a conference table if one is present. Many conference rooms that have meeting tables but not desks will also have a credenza desk against one wall. 
==Shape and form==
The credenza desk is sometimes flat, like a pedestal desk, but more often than not it has a stack of shelves, small drawers and other nooks above its main working surface. The sum of these overhead amenities is usually called a hutch. Hence, the credenza desk is often called a &quot;credenza with hutch&quot;.

The credenza desk is comparable in form to but differs from the armoire desk in that it is seen for the most part in large office buildings (instead of home offices, like the armoire desk) and most of its storage spaces are wide open.
==Matching sets==
Credenza desks are often, but not always, part of a matching set that can include pieces such as a primary desk, a conference table, a cabinet for a whiteboard, a bookshelf, filing cabinets, chairs, or other items of furniture which are likely to be found in an office environment.

<doc id="578911" wikidata="Q279181" url="?curid=578911" title="Ammonite language">
<text>Ammonite is the extinct Canaanite language of the Ammonite people mentioned in the Bible, who used to live in modern-day Jordan, and after whom its capital Amman is named. Only fragments of their language survive—chiefly the 9th century BC Amman Citadel Inscription, the 7th–6th century BC Tel Siran bronze bottle, and a few ostraca. As far as can be determined from the small corpus, it was extremely similar to Biblical Hebrew, with some possible Aramaic influence including the use of the verb () instead of the more common Biblical Hebrew () for . The only other notable difference with Biblical Hebrew is the sporadic retention of feminine singular ( , but .) Ammonite also appears to have possessed largely typical correspondences of diphthongs, with words such as ( , ) both preserving and showing a shift to , and other words such as ( ) exhibiting a shift of to &quot;ē&quot; ( &lt; ) much like Hebrew.

It was first described as a separate language in 1970 by Italian Orientalist Giovanni Garbini. Subsequently, a number of inscriptions previously identified as Hebrew, Phoenician, or Aramaic were reclassified, as a result of consensus around the similarity of the Amman Theatre Inscription, Amman Citadel Inscription, Tell Siren Bottle, Heshbon Ostraca, and Tell el-Mazer Ostraca.

<doc id="578912" wikidata="Q7894174" url="?curid=578912" title="Universalis">
<text>Universalis, subtitled &quot;The Game of Unlimited Stories&quot;, is a role-playing game (RPG) published by Ramshead Publishing in 2002 that stresses interactive storytelling. The game uses a unique system, based on &quot;coins&quot; that are used to make additions to the game, which allows the entire group to participate in the creation of the setting and events in play without a traditional gamemaster. The rules also provide a means of negotiating their own alteration, allowing for unlimited customization for play. The system is meant to support any possible genre.

==System==
===Story power===
&quot;Coins&quot; are the measure of story power in &quot;Universalis&quot;. By spending coins, players can create &quot;facts&quot; in the game. These may be about characters, the setting, or the scene being played. Each player begins with a number of coins (typically 25), and gains more after each scene plays out (typically 5). Players may also gain coins by winning &quot;complications&quot; (see below).

===Setting tenets===
Unlike most RPGs, where the game setting and any setting-specific rules are either taken from a published source or created by the gamemaster, &quot;Universalis &quot;play begins with the setting of &quot;tenets&quot; which define the nature of the setting.

Going in a circle around the table, each player has the option to spend a coin to establish a tenet, or to pass. Tenets can be challenged using the rules, but it is more common for players to simply negotiate an amicable settlement when there is a disagreement about a proposed tenet. Once no more players want to establish new tenets, the initial phase is over and the game begins.

===Scenes===
&quot;Universalis&quot; is played out in scenes. Players bid coins for the privilege of establishing a new scene—the high bidder wins, and sets the location and time, and introduce characters or items into the scene. Play then proceeds around the table, with each player having the chance to narrate and spend coins. Spending coins establishes new facts in the game, which can be drawn on by the other players, and used in resolving complications. A player may interrupt the normal flow by spending a coin to do so, immediately having their turn.

===Challenges===
When a player wishes to establish a fact and another wants to oppose it, a challenge results if the two players cannot come to an agreement. Established facts can be drawn on in the challenge, and all players have the chance to weigh in with their coins. When everyone has spent the coins and called on the facts that they wish to, a die roll is then used to resolve the challenge (with the dice rolled depending on how many facts and coins each side has). The winner gains new coins, and narrates the result of the challenge.

===Modifying the rules===
Rules in &quot;Universalis&quot; are just another kind of fact, and can be established by spending coins.

==Publication history==
&quot;Universalis&quot; was created by Ralph Mazza and Mike Holmes and published by Ramshead Publishing in 2002. Ramshead released a Revised Edition in 2006.

==Reception==
In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;&quot;Universalis&quot; is a game that wants to flow past mechanical hiccups as quickly as possible and it is often preferable to handwave a solution that appeases all parties rather than looking up something in the book. The story is the focus, and keeping it going is paramount.&quot; Horvath concluded, &quot;&quot;Universalis&quot; is actually mind-blowing. It is a simple system that emphasizes creative collaboration and is versatile enough to handle literally any kind of story players can dream up. That is quite an accomplishment for a digest-sized RP{G book.&quot;

==Awards==
At the 2002 Indie RPG Awards, &quot;Universalis&quot; was the winner of the category &quot;Most Innovative Game.&quot;

<doc id="578913" wikidata="Q551661" url="?curid=578913" title="Vasily Degtyaryov">
<text>Vasily Alekseyevich Degtyaryov (; 2 January 1880, Tula – 16 January 1949, Moscow) was a Soviet and Russian engineer who specialized in weapons design. He was awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labour in 1940.

==Biography==

He was a factory worker at the Tula Arms Plant. He became married in 1905. Starting in 1918, Vasily Degtyaryov headed the first Soviet firearms design bureau at Kovrov Arms Factory.

In 1927, the Red Army was equipped with his 7.62 mm light machine gun DP-27. This design led to the development of the DT tank machine gun (1927) and two aircraft machine guns: DA and DA-2 (1928).

In 1940 he became a Doctor of Technical Sciences, and Hero of Socialist Labour (he received the second such award in its history just two weeks after Joseph Stalin). He joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1941.

During the Axis invasion of the USSR in summer 1941 he created the PTRD-41 14.5mm anti-tank rifle. In 1944 he became Major General of the Engineering and Artillery Service of the Soviet Union. He designed a belt-fed light machine gun, the RPD, chambered for the 7.62×39mm intermediate cartridge.

Vasily Degtyaryov was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1941, 1942, 1944, and 1949 (posthumously).

He died on January 16th of 1949 and was later buried in a cemetery in Kovrov.

== Inventions ==
Degtyaryov developed a total 82 types of machine guns, submachine guns and anti-tank rifles, 19 of them were officially adopted.

*Degtyaryov designed several models of submachine guns, the best of which would be adopted by the Soviet Army in 1934 (modernized in 1940) as the &quot;ППД&quot; PPD-40 (from &quot;П&quot;истолет-&quot;п&quot;улемёт &quot;Д&quot;егтярёва, &quot;Degtyaryov&#x27;s submachine gun&quot;).
*In 1930, Degtyaryov designed a 12.7 mm large-caliber machine gun, the &quot;ДК&quot;, or DK (&quot;Д&quot;егтярёва &quot;К&quot;рупнокалиберный, &quot;Large-caliber Degtyaryov&quot;). In 1938, this machine gun was upgraded by Georgy Shpagin and renamed &quot;ДШК&quot; (DShK) (&quot;Д&quot;егтярёва &quot;Ш&quot;пагина &quot;К&quot;рупнокалиберный, &quot;Large-caliber Shpagin-Degtyaryov&quot;).
*In 1939, Degtyaryov designed his heavy machine gun called &quot;ДС&quot;, or DS (&quot;Д&quot;егтярёва &quot;С&quot;танковый &quot;Heavy Degtyaryov&quot;). The DS-39 was issued to the Red Army and used in the Winter War of 1939–1940. The belt feed mechanism damaged the cartridge cases and the gun was found too complicated and liable to malfunctions and was withdrawn from service.

==Honours and awards==
* Stalin Prizes;
**1942 – 1st class and 2nd class
**1946 – 2nd class

* Order of the Red Banner of Labour
* Order of the Red Star
* Medal &quot;For the Victory over Germany in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945&quot; (1945)

==Commemoration==

On the day of the designer’s death, by a resolution of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, monthly scholarships were established in his name:
* one is for graduate students (850 rubles) and one for is students (400 rubles) of the Leningrad Military Mechanical Institute;
* two are for post-graduate students (850 rubles) and two are for students (400 rubles) of the Tula Mechanical Institute;
* five are for excellent students (350 rubles) of the Kovrov College.
On October 17, 1954, a monument was erected in Kovrov for Degtyaryov, and a bust and several plaques were installed on the territory of the weapons factory bearing his name. At the memorial for gunsmiths and designers, a bas-relief was made in his likeness. A museum was opened in Degtyaryov&#x27;s house on January 6, 1978. In addition, a technical school, a secondary school, a kindergarten, a recreation park, the House of Culture of Metal Workers and the former Komsomolskaya Street in Kovrov were named after him. A pioneer camp near the village of Sukhanikha was named after Degtyaryov. In many cities of the former USSR (Kharkiv, Novosibirsk, Lomonosov, Saint Petersburg) streets carry the name of Degtyaryov. On November 6, 1979, on the occasion of the centennial of the designer&#x27;s birth, the USSR Ministry of Communications issued a postal envelope with his image. January 2, 1980 in Kovrov held a special cancellation of these envelopes. On August 18, 2004, the Russian Post also issued an envelope depicting Degtyaryov.

==In popular culture==
*Degtyaryov appears in the 2020 Russian biographical film &quot;AK-47&quot;, played by Valery Barinov.

<doc id="578923" wikidata="Q611127" url="?curid=578923" title="Anterior cruciate ligament">
<text>The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of a pair of cruciate ligaments (the other being the posterior cruciate ligament) in the human knee. The two ligaments are called &quot;cruciform&quot; ligaments, as they are arranged in a crossed formation. In the quadruped stifle joint (analogous to the knee), based on its anatomical position, it is also referred to as the cranial cruciate ligament. The term cruciate is Latin for cross. This name is fitting because the ACL crosses the posterior cruciate ligament to form an &quot;X&quot;. It is composed of strong, fibrous material and assists in controlling excessive motion by limiting mobility of the joint. The anterior cruciate ligament is one of the four main ligaments of the knee, providing 85% of the restraining force to anterior tibial displacement at 30 and 90° of knee flexion. The ACL is the most frequently injured ligament in the knee.

==Structure==
The ACL originates from deep within the notch of the distal femur. Its proximal fibers fan out along the medial wall of the lateral femoral condyle. The two bundles of the ACL are the anteromedial and the posterolateral, named according to where the bundles insert into the tibial plateau. The tibial plateau is a critical weight-bearing region on the upper extremity of the tibia. The ACL attaches in front of the intercondyloid eminence of the tibia, where it blends with the anterior horn of the medial meniscus.

==Purpose==
The purpose of the ACL is to resist the motions of anterior tibial translation and internal tibial rotation; this is important to have rotational stability. This function prevents anterior tibial subluxation of the lateral and medial tibiofemoral joints, which is important for the pivot-shift phenomenon. The ACL has mechanoreceptors that detect changes in direction of movement, position of the knee joint, and changes in acceleration, speed, and tension. A key factor in instability after ACL injuries is having altered neuromuscular function secondary to diminished somatosensory information. For athletes who participate in sports involving cutting, jumping, and rapid deceleration, the knee must be stable in terminal extension, which is the screw-home mechanism.

==Clinical significance==

===Injury===

An ACL tear is one of the most common knee injuries, with over 100,000 tears occurring annually in the US. Most ACL tears are a result of a non-contact mechanism such as a sudden change in a direction causing the knee to rotate inward. As the knee rotates inward, additional strain is placed on the ACL, since the femur and tibia, which are the two bones that articulate together forming the knee joint, move in opposite directions, causing the ACL to tear. Most athletes require reconstructive surgery on the ACL, in which the torn or ruptured ACL is completely removed and replaced with a piece of tendon or ligament tissue from the patient (autograft) or from a donor (allograft). Conservative treatment has poor outcomes in ACL injury, since the ACL is unable to form a fibrous clot, as it receives most of its nutrients from synovial fluid; this washes away the reparative cells, making the formation of fibrous tissue difficult. The two most common sources for tissue are the patellar ligament and the hamstrings tendon. The patellar ligament is often used, since bone plugs on each end of the graft are extracted, which helps integrate the graft into the bone tunnels during reconstruction. The surgery is arthroscopic, meaning that a tiny camera is inserted through a small surgical cut. The camera sends video to a large monitor so the surgeon can see any damage to the ligaments. In the event of an autograft, the surgeon makes a larger cut to get the needed tissue. In the event of an allograft, in which material is donated, this is not necessary, since no tissue is taken directly from the patient&#x27;s own body. The surgeon drills a hole forming the tibial bone tunnel and femoral bone tunnel, allowing for the patient&#x27;s new ACL graft to be guided through. Once the graft is pulled through the bone tunnels, two screws are placed into the tibial and femoral bone tunnel. Recovery time usually ranges between one and two years, but is sometimes longer, depending if the patient chose an autograft or allograft. A week or so after the occurrence of the injury, the athlete is usually deceived by the fact that he/she is walking normally and not feeling much pain. This is dangerous, as some athletes start resuming some of their activities such as jogging, which with a wrong move or twist, could damage the bones, as the graft has not completely become integrated into the bone tunnels. Injured athletes must understand the significance of each step of an ACL injury to avoid complications and ensure a proper recovery.

===Nonoperative treatment of the ACL===

ACL reconstruction is the most common treatment for an ACL tear, but it is not the only treatment available for individuals. Some may find it more beneficial to complete a nonoperative rehabilitation program. Individuals who are going to continue with physical activity that involves cutting and pivoting, and individuals who are no longer participating in those specific activities both are candidates for the nonoperative route. In comparing operative and nonoperative approaches to ACL tears, few differences were noted between surgical and nonsurgical groups, with no significant differences in regard to knee function or muscle strength reported by the patients.

The main goals to achieve during rehabilitation (rehab) of an ACL tear is to regain sufficient functional stability, maximize full muscle strength, and decrease risk of reinjury. Typically, three phases are involved in nonoperative treatment - the acute phase, the neuromuscular training phase, and the return to sport phase. During the acute phase, the rehab is focusing on the acute symptoms that occur right after the injury and are causing an impairment. The use of therapeutic exercises and appropriate therapeutic modalities is crucial during this phase to assist in repairing the impairments from the injury. The neuromuscular training phase is used to focus on the patient regaining full strength in both the lower extremity and the core muscles. This phase begins when the patient regains full range of motion, no effusion, and adequate lower extremity strength. During this phase, the patient completes advanced balance, proprioception, cardiovascular conditioning, and neuromuscular interventions. In the final, return to sport phase, the patient focuses on sport-specific activities and agility. A functional performance brace is suggested to be used during the phase to assist with stability during pivoting and cutting activities.

===Operative treatment of the ACL===
Anterior cruciate ligament surgery is a complex operation that requires expertise in the field of orthopedic and sports medicine. Many factors should be considered when discussing surgery, including the athlete&#x27;s level of competition, age, previous knee injury, other injuries sustained, leg alignment, and graft choice. Typically, four graft types are possible, the bone-patella tendon-bone graft, the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons (quadrupled hamstring tendon), quadriceps tendon, and an allograft. Although extensive research has been conducted on which grafts are the best, the surgeon typically chooses the type of graft with which he or she is most comfortable. If rehabilitated correctly, the reconstruction should last. In fact, 92.9% of patients are happy with graft choice.

Prehabilitation has become an integral part of the ACL reconstruction process. This means that the patient exercises before getting surgery to maintain factors such as range of motion and strength. Based on a single leg hop test and self-reported assessment, prehab improved function; these effects were sustained 12 weeks postoperatively.

Postsurgical rehabilitation is essential in the recovery from the reconstruction. This typically takes a patient 6 to 12 months to return to life as it was prior to the injury. The rehab can be divided into protection of the graft, improving range of motion, decrease swelling, and regaining muscle control. Each phase has different exercises based on the patients&#x27; needs. For example, while the ligament is healing, a patient&#x27;s joint should not be used for full weight-bearing, but the patient should strengthen the quadriceps and hamstrings by doing quad sets and weight shifting drills. Phase two would require full weight-bearing and correcting gait patterns, so exercises such as core strengthening and balance exercises would be appropriate. In phase three, the patient begins running, and can do aquatic workouts to help with reducing joint stresses and cardiorespiratory endurance. Phase four includes multiplanar movements, thus enhancing a running program and beginning agility and plyometric drills. Lastly, phase five focuses on sport- or life-specific motions, depending on the patient.

A 2010 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; review of two medical studies discussed whether ACL reconstruction was advisable. One study found that children under 14 who had ACL reconstruction fared better after early surgery than those who underwent a delayed surgery. For adults 18 to 35, though, patients who underwent early surgery followed by rehabilitation fared no better than those who had rehabilitative therapy and a later surgery.

The first report focused on children and the timing of an ACL reconstruction. ACL injuries in children are a challenge because children have open growth plates in the bottom of the femur or thigh bone and on the top of the tibia or shin. An ACL reconstruction typically crosses the growth plates, posing a theoretical risk of injury to the growth plate, stunting leg growth, or causing the leg to grow at an unusual angle.

The second study noted focused on adults. It found no significant statistical difference in performance and pain outcomes for patients who receive early ACL reconstruction vs. those who receive physical therapy with an option for later surgery. This would suggest that many patients without instability, buckling, or giving way after a course of rehabilitation can be managed nonoperatively, but was limited to outcomes after two years and did not involve patients who were serious athletes. Patients involved in sports requiring significant cutting, pivoting, twisting, or rapid acceleration or deceleration may not be able to participate in these activities without ACL reconstruction.

===ACL injuries in women===
Risk differences between outcomes in men and women can be attributed to a combination of multiple factors, including anatomical, hormonal, genetic, positional, neuromuscular, and environmental factors. The size of the anterior cruciate ligament is often the most reported difference. Studies look at the length, cross-sectional area, and volume of ACLs. Researchers use cadavers, and &quot;in vivo&quot; placement to study these factors, and most studies confirm that women have smaller anterior cruciate ligaments. Other factors that could contribute to higher risks of ACL tears in women include patient weight and height, the size and depth of the intercondylar notch, the diameter of the ACL, the magnitude of the tibial slope, the volume of the tibial spines, the convexity of the lateral tibiofemoral articular surfaces, and the concavity of the medial tibial plateau. While anatomical factors are most talked about, extrinsic factors, including dynamic movement patterns, might be the most important risk factor when it comes to ACL injury.

<text>The Northrop YA-9 is a prototype attack aircraft developed for the United States Air Force A-X program. The YA-9 was passed over in preference for the Fairchild Republic YA-10 that entered production as the A-10 Thunderbolt II.

==Design and development==

Criticism that the U.S. Air Force did not take close air support seriously prompted a few service members to seek a specialized attack aircraft. In the Vietnam War, large numbers of ground-attack aircraft were shot down by small arms, surface-to-air missiles, and low-level anti-aircraft gunfire, prompting the development of an aircraft better able to survive such weapons. Fast jets such as the North American F-100 Super Sabre, Republic F-105 Thunderchief, and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II proved for the most part to be ineffective for close air support. The Douglas A-1 Skyraider was the USAF&#x27;s primary close air support aircraft.

===A-X===
In mid-1966, the U.S. Air Force formed the Attack Experimental (A-X) program office. On 6 March 1967, the Air Force released a request for information to 21 defense contractors for the A-X. The objective was to create a design study for a low-cost attack aircraft. Discussions with A-1 Skyraider pilots operating in Vietnam and analysis of the effectiveness of current aircraft used in the role indicated the ideal aircraft should have long loiter time, low-speed maneuverability, massive cannon firepower, and extreme survivability; an aircraft that had the best elements of the Ilyushin Il-2, Henschel Hs 129 and Skyraider. While turboprop engines were requested in the initial request, by May 1969, requirements had changed to specify use of turbofan engines.

In May 1970, the USAF issued a modified, and much more detailed request for proposals (RFP). The threat of Soviet armored forces and all-weather attack operations had become more serious. Now included in the requirements was that the aircraft would be designed specifically for the 30 mm cannon. The RFP also called for an aircraft with a maximum speed of , takeoff distance of , external load of , mission radius, and a unit cost of US$1.4 million. Simplicity and low cost were also vital requirements, with a maximum flyaway cost of $1.4 million based on a 600 aircraft production run. Performance was to be sacrificed where necessary to keep development and production costs under control. During this time, a separate RFP was released for A-X&#x27;s 30 mm cannon with requirements for a high rate of fire (4,000 round/minute) and a high muzzle velocity. Six companies submitted proposals to the USAF, with Northrop and Fairchild Republic selected on 18 December 1970 to build prototypes: the YA-9A and YA-10A, respectively. Meanwhile, General Electric and Philco-Ford were selected to build and test GAU-8 cannon prototypes.

===Design===
The A-9 was a shoulder-wing monoplane of all-riveted aluminum alloy construction, with honeycomb structures and chemically milled skins. The required twin turbofans were fitted in nacelles under the aircraft&#x27;s wing roots. Northrop selected the Lycoming YF102 engine for the YA-9 rather than the more powerful () General Electric TF34 used by the A-10, although either engine could be accommodated. The YF102 engine was a new design, based on the Avco Lycoming T55 turboshaft that powered the Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopter, which was selected in order to minimize costs. The aircraft had a large cruciform stabilizer in order to improve directional stability for low-level flight. Split ailerons were fitted that could be used as airbrakes. When these airbrakes were operated asymmetrically in conjunction with the aircraft&#x27;s rudder, sideways control forces could be applied (and the aircraft moved sideways) without yawing or banking, easing weapon aiming.

The pilot sat under a large bubble canopy well ahead of the leading edge of the wings. The cockpit was surrounded by a bathtub of armor (aluminum in the prototypes, which would have been replaced by titanium if production occurred) while the wing-mounted fuel tanks were self-sealing and filled with foam to minimize the potential for fires or massive fuel loss. Dual redundant hydraulic flight control systems were fitted, with a further manual backup to prevent a single hit from causing control failure. These design features were hoped to reduce combat losses by as much as 90% in Vietnam-type operations. A single 30 mm rotary cannon was to be fitted in the belly of the aircraft, with the gun barrels extending under the nose. As the gun was mounted on the aircraft&#x27;s centerline, the undercarriage nosewheel was offset to the left. As the GAU-8 Avenger cannon was not ready, both YA-9 prototypes (and the two YA-10s) were fitted with the smaller 20 mm M61 Vulcan instead. Ten underwing hardpoints were fitted, allowing up to of weapons, including bombs and AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missiles, to be carried.

===Fly-off===

The YA-9 took its first flight on 30 May 1972, with the second prototype flying on 23 August. Northrop&#x27;s flight testing was successful, with the aircraft claimed to have &quot;fighter-like&quot; handling and to be a good weapon platform. A fly-off by USAF test pilots of the two competing designs took place between 10 October and 9 December 1972. While the YA-9 fully met the USAF&#x27;s requirements, the YA-10 was declared the winner on 18 January 1973. The use of the established TF34 engine by the YA-10 rather than the untried F102 may have been preferred by the Air Force, while Fairchild had no alternative work available and was unlikely to survive if it did not win the A-X contract.

The two YA-9 prototypes were subsequently relegated to NASA for continued flight testing before being retired. When retired, the YA-9s&#x27; custom-built engines were removed and were later mated to a C-8 Buffalo airframe as part of the NASA-Boeing joint Quiet Short-haul Research Aircraft (QSRA) study into a quiet short-haul commercial aircraft.

<text>With Sympathy is the debut studio album by American industrial band Ministry, released on May 10, 1983, by Arista Records. The group was formed in 1981 by lead singer and multi-instrumentalist Al Jourgensen, with drummer Stephen George being the most notable member of its initial lineup. The album was briefly re-released overseas as Work for Love.

==Background and recording==
In late 1981, Jourgensen was living in Chicago and involved in its underground scene. He began to write and record songs in his apartment, using a newly bought ARP Omni synthesizer, a drum machine and a reel-to-reel tape recorder. At one point, a demo tape featuring the song &quot;I&#x27;m Falling&quot; gained the attention of Wax Trax! Records label co-founder and co-owner Jim Nash. Impressed by the demo, Nash offered to record its material professionally and to assemble the touring band, which Jourgensen named Ministry. At Chicago&#x27;s Hedden West Studios, Jourgensen, with co-producers Jay O&#x27;Roarke and Iain Burgess, recorded Ministry&#x27;s first material, a 12&quot; single featuring the tracks &quot;I&#x27;m Falling&quot;, &quot;Primental&quot; and &quot;Cold Life&quot;.

Jourgensen assembled the band&#x27;s first live lineup, a five-piece group including Jourgensen on vocals and guitar, bassist Martin Sorenson, keyboardists Robert Roberts and John Davis and drummer Stephen George. Jourgensen and Roberts state that Roberts&#x27; inclusion in the group occurred because their mutual friend Paul Taylor was ill and unable to join.

While touring the Midwest and the Northeast during 1982, Ministry received some commercial success with &quot;Cold Life.&quot; The band gained the attention of Arista label executives, who chose to sign them. &quot;With Sympathy&quot; was recorded in Autumn 1982 with producers Vince Ely and Ian Taylor at the Syncro Sound recording studio in Boston.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard on the W.S. recording/mixing&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==

On release, &quot;With Sympathy&quot; received mixed to negative reviews. However, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted that any lack of originality in the synth-pop concept was &quot;... hardly worth complaining about, because Ministry manages to do something many far more innovative bands neglect: they write catchy dance songs.&quot; The review further observed that Jourgensen&#x27;s singing was &quot;... charged with anger, passion and glee–real emotions instead of the vocal posturing so common in synth-pop.&quot; The album achieved commercial success, peaking at number 94 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and selling more than 100,000 copies in the U.S. by 2007. The album was promoted with three singles—&quot;Work for Love&quot;, &quot;I Wanted to Tell Her&quot; and &quot;Revenge&quot;—and the three-month tour. A music video was made for the single &quot;Revenge.&quot; Retrospectively, many Ministry fans still dislike the album, but some people now have defended or even championed it, proclaiming it to be an “underrated” or “misunderstood” album.

=== Retrospective impressions by Al Jourgensen ===
Following the tour&#x27;s completion, Jourgensen&#x27;s dissatisfaction over his record deal led the band to depart Arista in early 1984. Jourgensen later disowned the album, maintaining that he had been pressured by Arista management into the then-popular synth-pop style, which is in contrast to the harder industrial and heavy metal sounds that he would later develop. He compared the experience to that of Milli Vanilli. Jourgensen has described the album as a &quot;sonic abortion&quot;. He also claims that Arista had prevented songs that he had written in 1982 from appearing on the album; these tracks would eventually appear on &quot;The Land of Rape and Honey&quot; and &quot;Twitch&quot;.

However, according to Ian MacKaye, with whom Jourgensen formed Pailhead, Jourgensen discovered hardcore music after his synth-pop work, a statement that Jourgensen repeated in the documentary film &quot;Industrial Accident: The Story of Wax Trax! Records&quot;. Former keyboardist Robert Roberts refutes claims that Jourgensen was forced by Arista to &quot;make the record cheesy,&quot; saying that the finished product was simply watered down and did not properly capture the band&#x27;s live sound. Additionally, video recordings of Ministry concerts in Chicago several years before their signing with Arista show the band playing synth-pop and dressed in new wave and dark wave styles.

Jourgensen&#x27;s disdain for the album led him to make a comment that he would only sign the album in exchange for $1000. In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, he said that a fan presented him with the album for him to sign along with the $1000. Although surprised, he honored his promise and signed the album in exchange for the money. Jourgensen also stated that he donated the money to Rock for Kids, a Chicago based charity event, and should anyone else pay him to sign the album, he would continue to donate the money to Rock for Kids.

Jourgensen assumes a false English accent for all of the songs, for which he later expressed regret. His ex-wife Patty stated in 2013 that doing so was an homage to bands that he had liked.

Jourgensen has since made peace with the album, saying that &quot;... because of that record I wouldn’t be who I am today. I think without that record, I wouldn&#x27;t be as much of a fucking maniac douchebag. So I&#x27;m thankful for it now.&quot;

In June 2023, Jourgensen announced that Ministry would re-record four tracks from &quot;With Sympathy&quot;: &quot;Revenge&quot;, &quot;Effigy&quot;, &quot;Work for Love&quot;, and &quot;Here We Go&quot;. The new versions will be &quot;a lot more guitar-driven, but not metal.&quot;

On August 24th, 2023, Ministry performed &quot;Revenge&quot; live for the first time since 1984 in Dallas, Texas. The song was performed again in August 27th, 2023 in West Palm Beach, Florida.

In December of 2023, it was announced that Ministry would be performing at the 2024 Cruel World Festival with a setlist consisting of songs from both &quot;With Sympathy&quot; and &quot;Twitch&quot;. The setlist included &quot;Revenge&quot;, &quot;Effigy (I&#x27;m Not An)&quot; and &quot;Work for Love&quot;, the later two being performed live for the first time since 1984.

== Reissue ==
&quot;With Sympathy&quot; was out of print for many years, and Jourgensen claimed that he had destroyed the master tapes. In 2012, Eastworld Records reissued the album with three bonus tracks.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Effigy (I&#x27;m Not An)&quot; was used in a scene in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Euphoria&quot;, Season 2, Episode 3.

<text>The lowland paca (Cuniculus paca), also known as the spotted paca, is a large rodent found in tropical and sub-tropical America, from east-central Mexico to northern Argentina, and has been introduced to Cuba and Algeria.

The animal is called paca in most of its range, but tepezcuintle (original Aztec language name) in most of Mexico and Central America, tepesquintle in Guatemala, guardatinaja in Nicaragua, pisquinte in northern Costa Rica, in the Yucatán peninsula, conejo pintado in Panama, guanta in Ecuador, majás or picuro in Peru, jochi pintado in Bolivia, and boruga, tinajo, or guartinaja in Colombia. It is also known as the gibnut in Belize, where it is prized as a game animal, labba in Guyana, lapa in Venezuela, and lappe on the island of Trinidad. Although lowland pacas are not in danger of being extinct, local extinctions have occurred due to habitat destruction.

There is much confusion in the nomenclature of this and related species; see agouti. In particular, the popular term &quot;agouti&quot; or &quot;common agouti&quot; normally refers to species of the distinct genus &quot;Dasyprocta&quot; (such as the Central American agouti, &quot;Dasyprocta punctata&quot;). Sometimes the word &quot;agouti&quot; is also used for a polyphyletic grouping uniting the families Cuniculidae and Dasyproctidae, which, besides the pacas and common agoutis, includes also the acouchis (&quot;Myoprocta&quot;). &quot;Cuniculus&quot; is the appropriate genus name instead of &quot;Agouti&quot; based on a 1998 ruling of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature as the lowland paca&#x27;s genus.

== Etymology ==
The word comes from a word in the Tupi language that designates the animal but also means &#x27;awaken, alert&#x27;.
 is of Nahuatl origin, meaning &#x27;mountain-dog&#x27;, from , &#x27;mountain&#x27; + , &#x27;dog&#x27;.

== Description ==
The lowland paca has coarse fur without underfur, dark brown to black on the upper body and white or yellowish on the underbelly. It usually has three to five rows of white spots along its sides, against a dark grey background. It has thick strong legs, with four digits in the forefeet and five in the hind feet (the first and fifth are reduced); the nails function as hooves. The tail is short and hairless. The zygomatic arch is expanded laterally and dorsally and is used as a resonating chamber - a unique feature among mammals.

An adult lowland paca weighs between . Each litter has one young lowland paca, sometimes two. They usually have one to three young a year with a gestation period of about 115–120 days. Pacas are sexually mature at about 1 year. A paca usually lives up to 13 years.

The lowland paca can carry leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis.

== Habits ==
The lowland paca is mostly nocturnal and solitary and does not vocalize very much. It lives in forested habitats near water, preferably smaller rivers, and dig simple burrows about 2 m (6 ft 7 in) below the surface, usually with more than one exit. It can also sometimes live in burrows created by other animals. The lowland paca is a good swimmer and usually heads for the water to escape danger, as it can stay under water for several minutes. It also is a very good climber and it searches for fruit in the trees.

The lowland paca can be considered an important seed distributor, since its diet includes leaves, stems, roots, tubers, nuts, seeds, herbs and fruit, especially avocados, mangos and zapotes, as well as coco macaque, balata, wild chataigne, hog plum, pomerac and guava. Introduced species such as jack-fruit and buri are also eaten. It sometimes stores food. Lowland paca also have necrophagy behavior, consuming carcasses of decomposing animals, possibly to supply protein demands of their diet.

== Economic and ecological aspects ==
The lowland paca is considered an agricultural pest for yam, cassava, sugar cane, maize and other food crops. Its meat is highly prized. It is plentiful in protected habitats, and hence not in danger of extinction, but overall its numbers have been much reduced because of hunting and habitat destruction. It is easily bred and raised in farms, although the taste is said to be inferior (perhaps unpleasant) when farmed. Some of the lowland paca predators include ocelots, jaguars, coyotes, bush dogs, crocodiles, and boa constrictors.

<doc id="578942" wikidata="Q778492" url="?curid=578942" title="Sijo">
<text>Sijo () is a Korean traditional poetic form that emerged during the Goryeo dynasty, flourished during the Joseon dynasty, and is still written today. Bucolic, metaphysical, and cosmological themes are often explored. The three lines average 14–16 syllables, for a total of 42–48: theme (3, 4,4,4); elaboration (3,4,4,4); counter-theme (3,5) and completion (4,3).

&quot;Sijo&quot; may be narrative or thematic and introduces a situation in line 1, development in line 2, and twist and conclusion in line 3. The first half of the final line employs a &quot;twist&quot;: a surprise of meaning, sound, or other device. &quot;Sijo&quot; is often more lyrical and personal than other East Asian poetic forms, and the final line can take a profound turn. Yet, &quot;The conclusion of &quot;sijo&quot; is seldom epigrammatic or witty; a witty close to a sentence would have been foreign to the genius of stylized Korean diction in the great &quot;sijo&quot; periods.&quot;My close friends I count would be water and stone, pine tree, bamboo.

Moon rising on eastern peaks, there is one more so good to see!

Keeping them, beyond these five friends, what more do I need to add?

윤선도   Yun Seon Do  (1587-1671)

내 벗이 몇 인고 하니 수(水) 석(石)과 송(松) 죽(竹)이라

동산(東山)에 달 오르니 그 더욱 반갑구나

두어라 이 다섯밖에 또 더해 무엇하리

== Structure ==

=== Elements of early &quot;sijo&quot; ===
&quot;P’yong sijo&quot; prioritized its grammatical structure for recitation purposes and not writing; so, this made the “rules” of &quot;sijo&quot; structure quite strict. Authors were mostly of the higher up &quot;yangban&quot; social class and emphasized how their &quot;sijo&quot; would be sung melodically first as opposed to written down later. This meant that the rhythmic pattern in these &quot;sijo&quot;s had to be learned exactly to be considered a truthful recitation. 

Tang poetry was traditionally rhythmically segmented in its stanzas. This feature was one that was passed down onto &quot;p’yong sijo&quot; as well as other early forms of &quot;sijo&quot;. &quot;Sijo&quot; poems often follow a rhythmic structure characterized by the syllabic ways of Chinese and Hangul characters. Specifically, they follow a 3-4-3-4, 3-4-3-4, 3-5-4-3 rhythmic structure per line. An example of the strictness of early &quot;sijo&quot; is seen especially in their third lines. It sticks hard to the “3-5” syllable rule at the beginning of the third line. This is done so to further drive the rhetorical conclusion of the &quot;sijo&quot;. As David McCann puts it, syllabic counting plays “a role in patterns of syllable distribution among the four phrases or syllable groups that constitute the lines [of a &quot;sijo&quot;].” Furthermore, since most &quot;p’yong sijo&quot; were not titled and were spread mostly through recitation, their structure was much more specific and defined than the &quot;sijo&quot; forms seen later.

=== Elements of developed &quot;sijo&quot; ===
There are many variants of &quot;sijo&quot;, ranging from the standard three-line &quot;p’yong sijo&quot; to the slightly expanded &quot;ossijo&quot; and the greatly expanded narrative &quot;sasol sijo&quot;. The conventional structure of &quot;p’yong sijo&quot; consists of three lines, with each line broken by a caesura (a midline pause) into two halves. Each hemistich (or half) is further broken into pairs. As a result, there are four groups total in one line. A single group is typically made up of three to five syllables, which results in a composition of approximately forty five syllables (morae). However, these syllabic distributions are the average; variation in syllable count is the rule, not an exception. &quot;Sijo&quot; is an accentual verse form, not syllabic. A group generally corresponds to syntactic and rhythmic units and can be distinguished by mutual contrast, such as particles or verb endings. All traditional &quot;sijo&quot; were originally set to melodies that impose further regularity and cadence to each poem.

The table above illustrates that deviations from the traditional syllabic distribution occur fairly frequently, depending on the position. For example, there are 13 times that group I in line 1 has a syllable count other than 3. In contrast, the ends of the first two lines, as well as groups I and III in the third line, show very little variation. The greater regularity in these positions is directly related to the variation that precedes or follows; the increased regularity ensures the rhythm is not lost.

=== Elements of modern &quot;sijo&quot; ===
In contrast to the structure of early &quot;sijo&quot; forms such as &quot;p’yong sijo&quot;, modern &quot;sijo&quot; sticks mainly to a freer and more fluid way of writing. This is a controversial take amongst the &quot;sijo&quot; community as some argue that modern &quot;sijo&quot; focuses “on the revival of &quot;sijo&quot;, but claim that its traditional fixed form cannot be preserved.&quot; Thus, there has been a large wave of people who subscribe to the thought that modern &quot;sijo&quot; can be written without attention to rhythmic segments and the fixed form. Thus, many modern poets and artists write free-verse works and still claim them as &quot;sijo&quot;. In Oh’s work, the author states that “​​&quot;sijo&quot;, even a contemporary one, which does not obey the form, cannot be considered &quot;sijo&quot;.&quot; This has left modern &quot;sijo&quot; at a divide between those who choose to honor the strictness of fixed form &quot;sijo&quot; and those who believe an adaptive free-form version of the poetic genre may still be acceptable as traditional works. Despite the fact that early forms, such as &quot;p’yong sijo&quot;, were not as widely written and recorded, they would still follow a 3-4-3-4, 3-4-3-4, 3-5-4-3 rhythmic structure. This made them strong and strict forms of poetry that only skilled artists would be able to remember and recite. This is changed in modern &quot;sijo&quot;. Since modern &quot;sijo&quot; is first written and not as spread through word of mouth, its structure has become much more lenient and differs in its shape across different authors.

== Early &quot;sijo&quot; in the Goryeo dynasty ==
Although &quot;sijo&quot; gained much of its popularity in the Joseon dynasty, it is important to note that the roots of the &quot;sijo&quot; are attributed to the late Goryeo dynasty. In fact, the earliest existing &quot;sijo&quot; was found to have been written towards the end of the 14th century as Confucian scholars sought to overcome the existing Buddhist-dominated literary, music, and art forms. As a result, there are important differences between the &quot;sijo&quot; written at the end of the Goryeo dynasty and those written in the Joseon dynasty. The &quot;sijo&quot; of the times, mostly written by men of elite status, are very reflective of the contemporary politics; thus, to understand the importance of the themes of Goryeo dynasty &quot;sijo&quot;, it is important to understand the political climate surrounding the poetry.

Much of the Goryeo dynasty was plagued with political strife. In 1170, the military aristocracy seized power from the civil aristocracy. Instability reigned in the government and the countryside for the next 25 years as military leaders plotted against each other and peasants rebelled against landowners and local officers. It was not until 1196 that things stabilized, when Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;ung-hŏn seized power and established the rule of the Ch&#x27;oe family. Much of his power came from the parallel government he created, which was based on house institutions under his direct control staffed with people personally loyal to him. He also made effective use of &quot;mun&#x27;gaek&quot;, private military retainers of great clans.

Korea then endured repeated Mongol invasions from 1217 to 1258, and from 1270 to 1356, Korea was under Mongol domination. After Korea was liberated from Mongol control, there were still political conflicts on all sides of Goryeo. Goryeo was consistently under attack from Japanese pirates and Yuan refugees and faced two invasions from the Red Turbans. Finally, the Goryeo dynasty ended when Yi Sŏng-gye rose to power, proclaiming himself as King Taejo and renaming the state as the Joseon. This transition was quite violent and unstable, as the crown princes and members of the Wang royal house were reinstated only to be purged, and two factions arose towards the later Goryeo era – one whose loyalty to the existing regime continued, another whose loyalty shifted towards the new movement of the Joseon.

It was this incident for which the &quot;sijo&quot; poems of the late Goryeo are most well-known. The most prevalent theme of this era is loyalty to a lost cause, arising as a reaction to the rise of the new Joseon dynasty as the most powerful groups of the period struggled with where their loyalties lay. However, exacerbating the situation were the simultaneous struggles of China&#x27;s Sung dynasty and the ascending Ming dynasty, further conflicting the people&#x27;s loyalties. Thus, the ensuing confusion and chaos of the times gave way to themes of strong emotions such as regret over aging and sorrow over love, as many sought to express their mixed, complicated thoughts and harken back to the time of peace and stability.

One of the most famous &quot;sijo&quot; poems that demonstrates such political upheavals and tensions of the period is Chŏng Mong-ju&#x27;s &quot;sijo&quot;, seen below, with the English translation:

Chŏng, a great scholar of the time referred to as P&#x27;oŭn, supposedly wrote this poem in response to Yi Sŏng-gye&#x27;s son&#x27;s (Yi Pang-wŏn) suggestion to defect and join the growing Joseon movement. The very idea that one&#x27;s &quot;undivided heart&quot; remains loyal to the same despite dying &quot;a hundred times&quot; and one&#x27;s &quot;bleached bones all turn(ing) to dust&quot; clearly exhibits the overall sense of honor, integrity, and fidelity that is emblematic of this generation&#x27;s &quot;sijo&quot; poetry. In fact, this poem has become one of the prototypical examples of loyalty in Korea, even possibly one of the best known of all Korean &quot;sijo&quot; poems among Koreans. Today, this &quot;sijo&quot; (Dansimga - 단심가) has become to be known as the &quot;Song of a Loyal Heart,&quot; or the &quot;Tansim ka.&quot;When black birds fight in the dale, the pure white bird must not go there.

Angry birds deep black at heart yet shine like white, beware of them!

In clear streams, the cleanest body, once it gets stained, stays unwashed.

== Reemergence in the 18th century ==
&quot;Sijo&quot; was first written in the 14th century during the end of the Goryeo dynasty. However, it was not until the Joseon dynasty that it gained immense popularity. During the rise of the early Joseon dynasty &quot;sijo&quot; became very popular among &quot;yangban&quot; and the ruling class. In its earlier stages &quot;sijo&quot; was often written in classical Chinese by &quot;yangban&quot; and the ruling class. A lot of the poems used language which showed social hierarchy. It was not accessible to the masses due to it being written in classical Chinese characters. It was also hard to adapt to &quot;sijo-chang&quot; (&quot;sijo&quot; in song form) because of the Chinese characters.

The 18th century marked two very important events in &quot;sijo&quot;. The first being the reemergence of the term. The second being the shift from classical or traditional &quot;sijo&quot; to modern &quot;sijo&quot;. During the 18th century, the word &quot;sijo&quot; reemerged and with it came changes. &quot;Sijo&quot; was now written in Korean and was more accessible to the masses. It was no longer confined to just being a product by and for the ruling class and the &quot;yangban&quot;. &quot;Sijo&quot; was now available, created and performed by the general Korean public. New poems outside of Confucian ideal and hierarchy were being written and performed. This led to the invention of different forms of &quot;sijo&quot; such as &quot;sasol sijo&quot; (&quot;chatty&quot; sijo or &quot;narrative&quot; sijo), (&quot;slightly altered sijo&quot;), and &quot;yon sijo&quot;. The themes of &quot;sijo&quot; expanded and included more than just the narrative of the upper class.

In early to mid 18th century &quot;sijo&quot; reemerged and can be seen as traditional &quot;sijo&quot;. This is mainly due to the fact that this period signified Korea&#x27;s isolation from the outside world. After the Treaty of Ganghwa which opened Korea to a foreign nation, &quot;Sijo&quot; also shifted to become a modern poetry form. Up until the end of the Joseon dynasty, there was not a singular name for this form of poetry and &quot;sijo&quot; was not considered a literary genre. Instead, they were seen as songs and were labeled to signify what type of song it was. For example, it would have names such as &quot;sijoelga&quot; or &quot;sijeoldanga&quot; due to the situation in which it was a sung source. It was not until late 18th century that the word &quot;sijo&quot; reemerged as a literary poetic genre. It was in the 19th century that the movement of the restoration of &quot;sijo&quot; began. The activists involved in that movement took the first part of the word &quot;sijochang&quot; which historically was sung and kept the word as &quot;sijo&quot; to define this literary genre.

== &quot;Sijo chang&quot; ==
&quot;Sijo&quot; emerged in the late Goryeo Period as a performing art and eventually gained popularity through the Joseon period. Initially, it spread amongst the &quot;yangban&quot;, or upper class, and later amongst the commoners. &quot;Sijo&quot; was passed down as an oral tradition during this period as a means to preserve the art form. While &quot;sijo&quot; encompasses a wide variety of traditional Korean poetry, one specific variation that derives from it is known as &quot;sijo chang&quot;. One of the most significant differences when comparing standard &quot;sijo&quot; with &quot;sijo chang&quot; is the presence of musical instruments. &quot;Sijo chang&quot; poetry employs the use of various Korean instruments to accompany the vocalist reciting the poem.

&quot;Sijo chang&quot; is known as &quot;short song&quot; because it has slow tunes with long, drawn-out ending pronunciation. For this reason it may also be called &quot;the slowest song in the world&quot;. It demands a high level of ability and coordination between drummer and performer in order to keep the song flowing well. Throughout each &quot;sijo&quot;, the singer employs practiced techniques, such as vibrato and pitch changes.

The singer is accompanied by the &quot;daegeum&quot; (bamboo flute) and the &quot;janggu&quot; (hour-glass shaped drum). The singer uses a wide range of vibrato in addition to pitch changes. All &quot;sijo chang&quot; are sung in a very deliberate pace. The singer must be trained to extend the notes of the song for effect. Other instruments are used as the background musical support to keep the flow. For instance, the &quot;piri&quot; (bamboo oboe), &quot;daegeum&quot; (transverse flute), &quot;danso&quot; (vertical flute), and &quot;haegeum&quot; (two-fiddle zither) may also be used to accompany the vocalist. Although a wide variety of instruments may be used as an accompaniment to the &quot;sijo chang&quot; vocalist, not all may be used at one time. In more informal settings the &quot;janggu&quot; may be used as the sole instrument. Oftentimes, the sound of hitting one&#x27;s lap may also serve as the only instrumental accompaniment.

== Similarities with Tang poetry in themes and expression of emotion ==

There are many similarities between Korean &quot;sijo&quot; poetry and Chinese Tang poetry: the reason that people wrote poems, the messages that they want to deliver, and how they express their feelings by talking about natural things. The following passage shows the translation of Kwon Homun&#x27;s &quot;The Wind is Pure and Clear&quot; ():

There are only wind, moon, pine, lute and books in the poem. However, Kwon Homun used these to paint a world of himself that he dreams of. For him, a simple life like this is enough, but even this seemly simple life is hard for him to realize. Similarly, Chinese poets in the Tang dynasty also wrote poems in this way and for this reason. Here is the translation of Li Bai&#x27;s &quot;At the Yellow Crane Tower to Bid Meng Haoran Bon Voyage&quot; ():

On the surface, this poem is about the view and the landscape that Li Bai saw while he was in the tower of yellow crane superficially, but it actually expresses the deep feeling of Li Bai when he was still gazing at the river even though his friend Meng Haoran has left. The first line gives readers the background and the second line constructs a confused and sorrowful air. In the last two lines, it describes how Li Bai gazed after Meng Haoran and how he felt, metaphorizing his feelings as the Long River.

By comparing the meanings of these two poems, we know that both Korean &quot;sijo&quot; and Chinese Tang poetry often employ natural objects such as landscape, pines, bamboo, plants and flowers in order to express human emotions.

== Authors ==

=== &quot;Kisaeng&quot; ===
The &quot;Kisaeng&quot; were women who functioned as professional entertainers, performing artists, and courtesans. These women were selected at a young age from the lower class for their beauty and talents; then trained to work for the government performing-arts bureaucracy. Their presence as poets that contributed to the art of &quot;sijo&quot; is notable due to their position as lower class women. They were considered barely above beggars due to their association with prostitution. Since the Joseon period was heavily influenced by Confucianist ideals, social stratification was heavily enforced. &quot;Kisaeng&quot;″s ability to create artwork admired by the &quot;yangban&quot;—upper class men—was remarkable.

Many scholars note that the &quot;sijos&quot; written by &quot;kisaeng&quot; contain &quot;a rare blend of emotional freedom, ironic perspective, and technical mastery&quot; because they were free of the shackles of societal expectations. Their lower class standing released them from having to conform to themes of nature or filial piety. Therefore, despite the fact that the number of &quot;kisaeng&quot; authored &quot;sijo&quot; is unknown, their work is heavily associated with love poetry. Hwang Jini is one of the most notable &quot;kisaeng&quot; poets along with Yi Maechang.Winter moon, your longest night, I shall snip out your long cold waist.

Spring breeze flee beneath my quilt, put round and round, I keep your warmth!

So the day my old love comes chilled, I spread warm folds through the night.

황진이   Hwang Jin Yi  (?-1530, gisaeng)

Raining down pear blossoms there will come and catch my leaving love!

Autumn winds now dropping leaves, I also think about that day?

Far away, lonely dreams only go back and forth since he left.

이매창   Yi Mae Chang   (1513-1550, gisaeng)

==== In film ====
The title of the 2016 film &quot;Love, Lies&quot; in English refers to a famous &quot;sijo&quot;:
This follows the &quot;classic format&quot; of the three line structure and love-longing content. The title of the film literally means &#x27;flowers that understand words&#x27;, which refers to a &quot;kisaeng&#x27;s&quot; ability to understand the desire or need of men. The film gives clear facts on the connection between &quot;sijo&quot; and &quot;kisaeng&quot;. It also shows how &quot;kisaengs&quot; train from a very young age, and how they performed &quot;sijo chang&quot;.

&quot;Hwang Jin Yi&quot;, a 2007 film, gives an introduction to the well-known &quot;kisaeng&quot; Hwang Jin Yi, and her legendary life. The film shows much about kisaeng. Also, in these films, there is clear description of the well-educated &quot;kisaengs&quot;&#x27; accomplishments in literature. As one of the two classes who contributed to the composition the &quot;sijo&quot; poems, &quot;kisaeng&quot; also left numerous memorable sijo poems.

=== Kim Chŏnt&#x27;aek ===

Kim Chŏnt&#x27;aek was a prolific writer of sijo poetry and a famous singer. Scholars are almost certain that he was born in the late 1680s. In 1728 he created the first of the great sijo anthologies, 청구영언(靑丘永言), &quot;Chanted Words of the Green Hills.&quot; It is one of the oldest surviving sijo anthologies. Kim Chŏnt&#x27;aek was considered the best singer musician in the country. Kim Chŏnt&#x27;aek did well in music, but he had also mastered the art of poetry. In particular, he composed sijo about the conflict between ranks in society, informed by his own middle-class perspective. He also wrote around thirty sijo with themes of nature, with subjects such as rivers and mountains. 

One of Kim Chŏnt&#x27;aek’s poems is as follows:

흰구름 푸른 내는 골골이 잠겼는데

추풍에 물든 단풍 봄꽃도곤 더 좋왜라 

천공이 나를 위하여 뫼빛을 꾸며내도다

The blue hazy mountain sees from far away

Autumn leaves are more beautiful than spring flowers

God creates a colorful mountain for me.

This work can be seen as being based on the sense of pleasure and satisfaction of bringing nature into one&#x27;s own world. While taking advantage of the harmonious colorful beauty of the two colors, the poet glorifies the feeling of being immersed in the beauty of nature. In reading, one can feel relaxed and assimilated into the natural space of the world as a spiritual object. 

Kim Chŏnt&#x27;aek&#x27;s significance in Korean literature can be seen through Confucian compilations of poetry collections. He had great achievements in the world of literature and sijo. First, Kim Chŏnt&#x27;aek helped to transfer the lead role in writing sijo from the scholar yangban class to the commoners. Second, his compilation 청구영언 is notable, not only because Kim Chŏnt&#x27;aek was not a yangban, but because it was one of the first sijo compilations. Finally, his vigorous creativity helped contribute to the development and cultivation of a new generation of sijo poems. Additionally, Kim Chŏnt&#x27;aek recognized the Korean written language (한글). While he used Chinese characters in creating the 청구영언 and in his works commenting on other poems, he did not use them extensively in his usual verses.

== &quot;Sasol sijo&quot; ==
The &quot;sasol sijo&quot;, an expanded form of the &quot;pyeong sijo&quot; that originated in the Goryeo dynasty, became popular in the 18th century.  The word &quot;sasol&quot; means &quot;close-stitched&quot; or &quot;closely set&quot; and &quot;sasol sijo&quot; simply means &quot;chatty&quot; or &quot;narrative&quot; &quot;sijo&quot;. &quot;Sasol sijo&quot; loosely observed the basic format of &quot;sijo&quot;: fifteen-syllable lines for the first, second, and last lines. However, its middle section was expanded by adding additional phrases. During this time, most writers of &quot;sasol sijo&quot; took an interest in the life of the commoners. The writers of &quot;sasol sijo&quot; include women, &quot;yangban&quot;, &quot;chungin&quot; (the upper-middle class), and commoners. The authors tended to write in a manner that was more down to earth, and often rough and comical. Due to the themes relating to a commoner&#x27;s ordinary life, most of the writers of &quot;sasol sijo&quot; remained anonymous. There has been speculation made about their anonymity, which could possibly be because of their humbleness to not have their names remembered. Furthermore, &quot;sasol sijo&quot; is significant in terms of how it changed the structure of &quot;sijo&quot;. However, it is not a form that is still used today.

Themes varied between &quot;pyeong sijo&quot; and &quot;sasol sijo&quot;. As &quot;pyeong sijo&quot; was created in the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392), many Buddhist values could be seen in early &quot;pyeong sijo&quot;. Then, in the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910), the upper class in Korea upheld Confucian values. Meanwhile, &quot;sasol sijo&quot; was written about common life and didn&#x27;t uphold the expectations of Confucianism. There was an increase in the number of works focusing on love, whether that was carnal love, love-sickness, etc. Traditional &quot;pyeong sijo&quot; avoided discussing sex or love in this manner. Additionally, &quot;sasol sijo&quot; tended to include sarcasm, humor, and rough language associated with the common people.

While themes differ between &quot;sasol sijo&quot; and &quot;pyeong sijo&quot;, the most obvious difference between the two is their structure. Like &quot;pyeong sijo&quot;, &quot;sasol sijo&quot; consists of three lines, where the first line introduces the topic, the second line expands on the topic, and the third line provides a twist or a neat conclusion. In &quot;sasol sijo&quot;, the first and second lines are much longer than the three lines in regular &quot;sijo&quot;. If only one line of &quot;sijo&quot; is expanded, it is called &quot;os sijo&quot; meaning &quot;slightly altered &quot;sijo&quot;&quot;. More than one line expanded is &quot;sasol sijo&quot; and usually, the last line maintains the original structure of the last line in &quot;pyeong sijo&quot; and begins with a 3-syllable unit. Not having a fixed limit to the length of the &quot;sasol sijo&quot; meant that it is the content that directs the form and not the form that directs the content. This allows an unruly play of words and images. Below is an example of &quot;sasol sijo&quot;:

==Modern &quot;sijo&quot;==

===Emergence of modern &quot;sijo&quot;===

There are two established developments of &quot;sijo&quot;: before 1876 and after. Before 1876 was when traditional &quot;sijo&quot; was prevalent and after 1876 modern &quot;sijo&quot; was &quot;so-called&quot; created (p. 25). &quot;Sijo&quot; is a genre of short Korean poems with a strictly defined structure reflecting the rhythm of a traditional Korean song known as pansori. It originated from Korea in the Koryǒ dynasty which began to flourish in the Joseon dynasty. Established with the Confucian ideology, &quot;sijo&quot; became the most popular type of poetry among the ruling Confucian scholars and noblemen. During the time, &quot;sijo&quot; was sung and recorded by word of mouth or transcribed. &quot;Sijo&quot; is an official name of the genre of poems, which came to be in the period of modernism; especially after a movement for the restoration of &quot;sijo&quot; that became active in the 19th century. The activists of the movement copied the first part of the name of the music &quot;sijo chang&quot; as the term to reference the poetry as it did not previously have a name.

===Structure and comparison to traditional &quot;sijo&quot;===

Modern sijo is a further developed upon and expanded category of Korean vernacular poetry also known as sijo. The original style that was developed and used prior to the 20th century is referred to as p’yǒng sijo. This new style first emerged during &#x27;The open-door period&#x27; (개화기) (1876) and continued on to flourish during The Empire of Korea (1897–1910), Japanese Colonial Period (1910–1945), and even still is written today. It refers only to the written form. Modern sijo is generally structured the same as p’yǒng sijo with three line poems consisting of various amounts of syllables per foot. However, there are still several key differences between the two. The first being that modern sijo all have titles whereas none of the p’yǒng sijo did. Also given that sijo creation and literature in general was exclusive to the yangban class, p’yǒng sijo often used a lot of references to Chinese classics as well as focusing on the rhythm that it would be sung to as they were originally songs that were written down later on. Modern sijo was the product of literature becoming more widespread and available to the populace so it became filled with more wit, humor, and everyday life experiences. The rhythm also was not fixed as they were not focused on the performance aspect as it originally was. Instead of using Chinese characters or references to Tang dynasty classics, more colloquial language became the norm. Also, the above-mentioned structure of three lines generally stayed the same, rather than just writing one standalone sijo, modern sijo can go on for much longer and in most cases often does so. On top of this, although there was never a standard syllable count for p’yǒng sijo, in general each foot seem to be shorter than those in modern sijo. Overall, modern &quot;sijo&quot; became more free in style and departed in many ways from &quot;p’yǒng sijo&quot;.

===Writers===

* Choe Nam-sǒn (최남선) who created the first book of modern sijo titled ‘백팔번뇌’ or the ‘108 Worldly Desires’ in 1926. Not only was he a poet, he also published magazines during Japanese occupation to educate the young people. “In the mid-1920s to mid-1930s, he traveled across the homeland from Mount Paekdu down to Mount Chiri and sailed to Cheju Island, expressing his love to all the mountains and rivers and composing Sijo poems for Donga Ilbo along with his travelogues. He also compiled all Hyangga, Gasa and Sijo poems from the Three Kingdoms to Koyro and down to the Joseon Dynasties” (The Korea Times). 
* Yi Kwang-su (이광수) was a Korean writer as well as independence and nationalist activist. His pennames included both Chunwon and Goju. 
* Jeong Inpo (정인보) was a Korean scholar, historian, journalist, politician and writer during the Japanese colonial era. 
* Yi Eunsang (이은상) is a South Korean poet, historian and holds a doctorate in literature. He is also the author of “노산 시조집”. 
* Yi Byeonggi (이병기) is regarded as one of the founders and writers of sijo.
* Yi Hou (이호우) was a South Korean poet and journalist and was most known for his emotional reserve and concern with reality as he wrote about rural life and its simplicity and beauty.

===Examples===
This poem was written by Yi Byeonggi (1891–1968), a well-known author who encouraged the creation of &quot;sijo&quot;. His work is often referred to as &quot;gentle&quot;. This poem, &quot;Orchid&quot;, has a traditional moral approach about flowers and is maintained in a modern idiom (Rutt, 260). Yi Pyǒnggi was the father of &quot;sijo&quot; and came up with the three variants consisting of , &quot;sasol&quot;, and &quot;yon-sijo&quot;. He mentioned that &quot;sijo&quot; should convey modern life by the extension of the structure from the conventional single stanza to two or more.

==Examples==
&quot;Sijo&quot;, unlike some other East Asian poetic forms, frequently employs metaphors, puns, allusions and similar word play. Most poets follow these guidelines very closely although there are longer examples. An exemplar is this poem by Yun Seondo (1587–1671) :
Yun Seondo also wrote a famous collection of forty &quot;sijo&quot; of the changing seasons through the eyes of a fisherman. Following is the first verse from the Spring sequence; notice the added refrains in lines 2 and 4.

Either narrative or thematic, this lyric verse introduces a situation or problem in line 1, development (called a turn) in line 2, and a strong conclusion beginning with a surprise (a twist) in line 3, which resolves tensions or questions raised by the other lines and provides a memorable ending.

Korean poetry can be traced at least as far back as 17 BC with King Yuri&#x27;s &quot;Song of Yellow Birds&quot; but its roots are in earlier Korean culture (op. cit., Rutt, 1998, &quot;Introduction&quot;). &quot;Sijo&quot;, Korea&#x27;s favorite poetic genre, is often traced to Confucian monks of the eleventh century, but its roots, too, are in those earlier forms. One of its peaks occurred as late as the 16th and 17th centuries under the Joseon dynasty. One poem of the &quot;sijo&quot; genre is from the 14th century:

&quot;Sijo&quot; is, first and foremost, a song. This lyric pattern gained popularity in royal courts amongst the &quot;yangban&quot; as a vehicle for religious or philosophical expression, but a parallel tradition arose among the commoners. &quot;Sijo&quot; were sung or chanted with musical accompaniment, and this tradition survives. The word originally referred only to the music, but it has come to be identified with the lyrics.
Note: The English adaptations of verses by Yun Seondo and U Tak are by Larry Gross (op. cit.) The English adaptation of the verse by Hwang Jin-i is by David R. McCann (op. cit.); Some of the information on the origins of &quot;sijo&quot; are cited from The Bamboo Grove: An Introduction to Sijo, ed. Richard Rutt (U. of Michigan Press, 1998); Kichung Kim&#x27;s &quot;An Introduction to Classical Korean Literature: From Hyangga to P&#x27;ansori&quot;; and Peter H. Lee.

==Contemporary &quot;sijo&quot;==
In South Korea today, &quot;sijo&quot; is widely considered to be a dead art-form, to the point that there are more &quot;sijo&quot; written in the U.S. today than in South Korea.

===In English===
In 1986 the journal &quot;Poet&quot; dedicated an issue to &quot;classic&quot; Korean &quot;sijo&quot; translated into English by Korean-American Kim Unsong (aka William Kim). This was followed by Kim&#x27;s &quot;Classical Korean Poems (Sijo)&quot; in 1987, &quot;Sijo by Korean Poets in China&quot;, and &quot;Poems of Modern Sijo&quot; (a collection of his originals) in the mid-1990s. They found a devoted audience in American &quot;theWORDshop&quot; publisher Dr. Larry Gross and Canadian haiku poet Elizabeth St. Jacques. As a result, a volume of original English-language &quot;sijo&quot; (&quot;Around the Tree of Light&quot;) by St. Jacques appeared and soon after, Gross launched the first issue of &quot;Sijo West&quot; with St. Jacques as assistant editor. It was the world&#x27;s first poetry journal dedicated to English-language &quot;sijo&quot; and caught on well with poets dedicated to haiku and other forms of Asian verse.

&quot;Sijo West&quot; folded in 1999 reportedly due to health problems and tragedies with Gross. St. Jacques reemerged with online postings known as &quot;Sijo Blossoms&quot; (circa 2001), which, apparently, has since evolved into the &quot;Sijo In The Light&quot; section of her &quot;Poetry In The Light&quot; website. &quot;Sijo In The Light&quot;, like the defunct &quot;Sijo West&quot;, featured original English-language &quot;sijo&quot;, as well as essays and reviews. Gross, meanwhile, has maintained a significant presence for &quot;sijo&quot; on his website &quot;Poetry in theWORDshop&quot;, which includes translations from Korean masters as well as original contributions by contemporary poets.

<doc id="578943" wikidata="Q1180052" url="?curid=578943" title="Williams sisters">
<text>The Williams sisters are two American professional tennis players: Venus Williams (b. 1980), a seven-time major singles champion, and Serena Williams (b. 1981), a 23-time major singles champion, both of whom were coached from an early age by their parents Richard Williams and Oracene Price.

The Williams sisters partake in “one of the elite ‘country club’ sports in America,” a sport that was not—along with many others—open to female participation in the past (Smith &amp; Hattery, 75). When the sport was introduced as a form of leisurely activity in the United States, “many clubs would not allow women to be members” (Smith &amp; Hattery, 76). Furthermore, their status as successful African American athletes within a historically White sport—in spite of openly racist backlash they encountered during their careers—has been credited with opening up the sport of tennis to a truly multicultural audience.

Both sisters have been ranked by the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association at the world No. 1 position in both singles and doubles. In 2002, after the French Open, Venus and Serena Williams were ranked world No. 1 and No. 2 on singles, respectively, marking the first time in history that sisters occupied the top two positions. On 21 June 2010, Serena and Venus again held the No. 1 and No. 2 rankings spots in singles, respectively, some eight years after first accomplishing this feat. At the time, Serena was three months shy of her 29th birthday and Venus had just celebrated her 30th birthday.

There was a noted professional rivalry between the sisters in singles — between the 2001 US Open and the 2017 Australian Open, they contested nine major finals. They became the first two players, female or male, to contest four consecutive major singles finals, from the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian Open; Serena famously won all four to complete the first of two &quot;Serena Slams&quot; (non-calendar year Grand Slams). Between 2000 and 2016, they collectively won 12 Wimbledon singles titles (Venus five, and Serena seven). Nonetheless, they remain very close, often watching each other&#x27;s matches in support, even after one of them had been knocked out of a tournament.

By winning the 2001 Australian Open doubles title, they became the fifth pair of women to complete the career Grand Slam in doubles, and the first pair to complete the career Golden Slam in doubles. At the time, Venus and Serena were only 20 and 19 years old, respectively. Since then, they went on to add another two Olympic gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2012 London Olympics. Moreover, the duo achieved a non-calendar year Grand Slam in doubles between 2009 Wimbledon and 2010 Roland Garros, which made them the co-No. 1 doubles players on 7 June 2010. Their last major doubles title came at the 2016 Wimbledon Championships.

Both players won four gold medals at the Olympics, one each in singles and three in doubles— all won together— the most of any tennis players. Venus also won a silver in mixed doubles at the 2016 Rio Olympics. As a duo, they completed the double career Golden Slam in doubles. Between the two of them, they have completed the Boxed Set, winning all four major events in singles, women&#x27;s doubles, and mixed doubles; they split the four mixed doubles titles in 1998.

===Women&#x27;s doubles===

* Neither withdrawals nor walkovers are included in wins and losses.

Note: Serena Williams did not play at the 2004 Olympics because of injury. Venus partnered with American Chanda Rubin and lost in the first round to eventual gold-medalists Sun Tiantian and Li Ting.

==Boycott of the Indian Wells Open==
During the 2001 Indian Wells Open tournament in Indian Wells, California, Venus Williams withdrew four minutes prior to her semifinal match with her sister Serena.

The following day, Serena played Kim Clijsters in the final. As Richard Williams and Venus made their way to their seats, the crowd booed, and some spectators yelled verbal jabs. Serena was booed often during the match, which she won 4–6, 6–4, 6–2, and the booing continued into the presentation ceremony.

Richard accused the crowds at Indian Wells of overt racism, saying, &quot;The white people at Indian Wells, what they&#x27;ve been wanting to say all along to us finally came out: &#x27;Nigger, stay away from here, we don&#x27;t want you here&#x27;&quot;. When Venus was asked about her father&#x27;s statements, she said, &quot;I heard what he heard.&quot; Oracene Price (mother and coach of Venus and Serena) accused the crowd of &quot;taking off their hoods&quot;.

===Effects and criticism===
After the initial controversy, neither Williams sister played the tournament in Indian Wells for 14 years. The Women&#x27;s Tennis Association currently classifies the Indian Wells tournament as a Premier Mandatory event for all eligible players. Exceptions are made when players engage in tournament promotions, but Venus and Serena both declined to promote the tournament; WTA Tour CEO Larry Scott agreed he would not, promotionally, &quot;put them in a position that is going to be awkward&quot;, and tournament director Charlie Pasarell has stated he would accept the WTA tour&#x27;s ruling.

Allegations had been made before Venus&#x27;s withdrawal that Richard Williams decided who won the matches between his daughters. Those allegations continued and increased as a result of her withdrawal.

Richard has said that racial epithets were used against him and Venus as they sat in the stands during the final.

Serena discusses what happened in her view at Indian Wells in detail in an entire chapter titled &quot;The Fiery Darts of Indian Wells&quot; in her 2009 autobiography, &quot;On the Line&quot;. She says that on the morning of the semifinal, Venus told the tour trainer that she had injured her knee and didn&#x27;t think she could play and tried for hours to get approval from the trainer to withdraw, but the tournament officials kept stalling.

What got me most of all was that it wasn&#x27;t just a scattered bunch of boos. It wasn&#x27;t coming from just one section. It was like the whole crowd got together and decided to boo all at once. The ugliness was just raining down on me, hard. I didn&#x27;t know what to do. Nothing like this had ever happened to me. What was most surprising about this uproar was the fact that tennis fans are typically a well-mannered bunch. They&#x27;re respectful. They sit still. And in Palm Springs, especially, they tended to be pretty well-heeled, too. But I looked up and all I could see was a sea of rich people—mostly older, mostly white—standing and booing lustily, like some kind of genteel lynch mob. I don&#x27;t mean to use such inflammatory language to describe the scene, but that&#x27;s really how it seemed from where I was down on the court. Like these people were gonna come looking for me after the match. ... There was no mistaking that all of this was meant for me. I heard the word &quot;nigger&quot; a couple times, and I knew. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. That&#x27;s just not something you hear in polite society on that stadium court ... Just before the start of play, my dad and Venus started walking down the aisle to the players&#x27; box by the side of the court, and everybody turned and started to point and boo at them ... It was mostly just a chorus of boos, but I could still hear shouts of &#x27;Nigger!&#x27; here and there. I even heard one angry voice telling us to go back to Compton. It was unbelievable ... We refused to return to Indian Wells. Even now, all these years later, we continue to boycott the event. It&#x27;s become a mandatory tournament on the tour, meaning that the WTA can fine a player if she doesn&#x27;t attend. But I don&#x27;t care if they fine me a million dollars, I will not play there again.

However, on February 3, 2015, Serena Williams wrote an exclusive column for &quot;Time&quot; magazine stating her intentions to return to Indian Wells for a tournament on March 9, 2015. She did indeed return and won her opening match. Williams withdrew before her semi-final match with Simona Halep because of a knee injury.

The WTA announced on January 27, 2016, that Venus would return to Indian Wells for the first time in 15 years.

<text>The domain name mil is the sponsored top-level domain (sTLD) in the Domain Name System of the Internet for the United States Department of Defense and its subsidiary or affiliated organizations. The name is derived from &quot;military&quot;. It was one of the first top-level domains, created in January 1985. As in the case with .gov, the United States is the only country that has a top-level domain for its military, a direct result of the United States&#x27; military&#x27;s role in the creation of the Internet.

Other countries often use second-level domains for this purpose, e.g., &quot;mod.uk&quot; for the United Kingdom&#x27;s Ministry of Defence. Canada uses &quot;norad.mil&quot; with the United States as they jointly operate the North American Aerospace Defense Command.

Despite having a dedicated top-level domain, the US military also uses &quot;com&quot; domains for some of its recruitment sites, such as &quot;goarmy.com&quot;, as well as for the Defense Commissary Agency&#x27;s website &quot;www.commissaries.com&quot; and most non-appropriated fund instrumentalities such as military MWR organizations and military exchanges. Also, the military uses &quot;edu&quot; domains for its service academies: the United States Military Academy, United States Coast Guard Academy, United States Naval Academy, and the United States Air Force Academy can all be reached using either an &quot;edu&quot; or a &quot;mil&quot; domain name. The official athletic program sites of the three academies that are members of NCAA Division I (Army, Navy, Air Force) use &quot;com&quot; domains, as well as Coast Guard, which is a member of NCAA Division III. The Department of Defense itself uses &quot;gov&quot; for its home page, with at least three second-level domains within &quot;mil&quot; (&quot;defense&quot;, &quot;dod&quot;, and &quot;pentagon&quot;) redirecting to its domain name &quot;www.defense.gov&quot;.

The United States Coast Guard, like other military services, uses the &quot;mil&quot; domain, although during statutory peacetime the service falls under the United States Department of Homeland Security.

<doc id="578961" wikidata="Q861979" url="?curid=578961" title="Mahdi Army">
<text>The Mahdi Army () was an Iraqi Shia militia created by Muqtada al-Sadr in June 2003 and disbanded in 2008.

The Mahdi Army rose to international prominence on April 4, 2004, when it spearheaded the first major armed confrontation against the US forces in Iraq from the Shia community. This concerned an uprising that followed the ban of al-Sadr&#x27;s newspaper and his subsequent attempted arrest, lasting until a truce on June 6. The truce was followed by moves to disband the group and transform al-Sadr&#x27;s movement into a political party to take part in the 2005 elections; Muqtada al-Sadr ordered fighters of the Mahdi Army to cease fire unless attacked first. The truce broke down in August 2004 after provocative actions by the Mahdi Army, with new hostilities erupting. The group was disbanded in 2008, following a crackdown by Iraqi security forces.

At its height, the Mahdi Army&#x27;s popularity was strong enough to influence local government, the police, and cooperation with Sunni Iraqis and their supporters. The group was popular among Iraqi police forces. The National Independent Cadres and Elites party that ran in the 2005 Iraqi election was closely linked with the army. The Mahdi Army was accused of operating death squads.

The group was armed with various light weapons, including improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Many of the IEDs used during attacks on Iraqi security forces and Coalition forces used infrared sensors as triggers, a technique that was used widely by the IRA in Northern Ireland in the early-to-mid-1990s.

The group was semi-revived in 2014 as Saraya al-Salam in order to fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and was still active as of 2016. It participated in the recapture of Jurf Al Nasr and the Second Battle of Tikrit.

==Nomenclature==
In the Twelver school of Shia Islam, the Mahdī is believed to have been a historical figure identified with the Twelfth Imam, Hujjat Allah al-Mahdi, and is therefore called &quot;al-Imām al-Mahdī&quot;. It is believed that he is still present on earth in occultation, and will emerge again in the end times. Those Shias of this school believe that Imam Mahdi is the rightful ruler of the Islamic community (&quot;Ummah&quot;) at any given time, and he is therefore also called &quot;Imām al-Zamān&quot;, meaning &quot;Imam of the Era&quot;.

==History==

===Early history===
Created by Muqtada al-Sadr and a small fraction of Shias, the Mahdi Army began as a group of roughly 500 seminary students connected with Muqtada al-Sadr in the Sadr City district of Baghdad, formerly known as Saddam City. The group moved in to fill the security vacuum in Sadr City and in a string of southern Iraqi cities following the fall of Baghdad to U.S.-led coalition forces on April 9, 2003. The group was involved in dispensing aid to Iraqis and provided security in the Shi&#x27;ite slums from looters.

Gradually, the militia grew and al-Sadr formalized it in June 2003. The Mahdi Army grew into a sizable force of up to 10,000 who even operated what amounted to a shadow government in some areas. Al-Sadr&#x27;s preaching is critical of the American occupation, but he did not initially join the Sunni Islamist and Ba&#x27;athist guerrillas in their attacks on coalition forces. Iranian Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani played a significant role in the establishment of Mahdi Army as soon as the Iraq War broke out in 2003.

===2004 Shia uprising===
====Uprising begins====
Sadr&#x27;s position changed dramatically, however, by the beginning of April 2004. Following the closure of the Sadr-owned newspaper &quot;al-Hawza&quot; and the arrest of one of his senior aides, Sadr gave an unusually heated sermon to his followers on April 2. The next day, violent protests occurred throughout the Shi&#x27;ite south that soon spilt over into a violent uprising by Mahdi Army militiamen, fully underway by April 4.

====April hostilities====
The Mahdi Army forces began an offensive in Najaf, Kufa, Kut, and Sadr City, seizing control of public buildings and police stations while clashing with coalition forces. The militants gained partial control of Karbala after fighting there. Other coalition forces came under attack in Nasiriyah, Amarah and Basra. Najaf and Kufa were quickly seized after a few firefights with Spanish troops, and Kut has seized after clashes with Ukrainian troops soon afterwards.

After sporadic clashes, coalition forces temporarily suppressed most militia activity in Nasiriyah, Amarah, and Basra. Mahdi rebels expelled Iraqi police from three police stations and ambushed U.S. forces in Sadr City, killing seven U.S. troops and wounding several more. U.S. forces subsequently regained control of the police stations after running firefights with the fighters, killing dozens of Mahdi militiamen. However, Mahdi Army members still maintained some influence over many of the slum areas of Sadr City.

On April 16, Kut was retaken by US forces, and several dozen Mahdi Army members were killed in the battle. However, the area around Najaf and Kufa along with Karbala remained under the control of Sadr&#x27;s forces. Sadr himself was believed to be in Najaf. Coalition troops cordoned off Najaf with 2,500 troops but reduced the number of forces to pursue negotiations with the Mahdi Army. At the beginning of May, coalition forces estimated that there were 200–500 militants still present in Karbala, 300–400 in Diwaniyah, an unknown number still left in Amarah and Basra, and 1,000–2,000 still in the Najaf-Kufa region.

On May 4, coalition forces began a counter-offensive to eliminate the Mahdi Army in southern Iraq following a breakdown in negotiations. The first wave began with simultaneous raids in Karbala and Diwaniyah on militia forces, followed by a second wave on May 5 in Karbala and more attacks that seized the governor&#x27;s office in Najaf on May 6. 86 militiamen were estimated killed in the fighting along with 4 U.S. soldiers. Several high-ranking militia commanders were also killed in a separate raid by US Special Operations units. On May 8, U.S. forces launched a follow-up offensive into Karbala, launching a two-pronged attack into the city. U.S. tanks also launched an incursion into Sadr City. At the same time, perhaps as a diversionary tactic, hundreds of Mahdi Army members swept through Basra, firing on British patrols and seizing parts of the city. Two militants were killed and several British troops were wounded.

On May 24, after suffering heavy losses in weeks of fighting, Mahdi Army forces withdrew from the city of Karbala. This left the only area still under their firm control being the Najaf-Kufa region, also under sustained American assault. Several hundred Mahdi Army militia in total were killed. Unfazed by the fighting, Muqtada al-Sadr regularly gave Friday sermons in Kufa throughout the uprising.

====June truce====
On June 6, 2004, Muqtada al-Sadr issued an announcement directing the Mahdi Army to cease operations in Najaf and Kufa. Remnants of the militia soon ceased bearing arms and halted the attacks on U.S. forces. Gradually, militiamen left the area or went back to their homes. On the same day, Brigadier General Mark Hertling, a top US commander in charge of Najaf, Iraq, stated &quot;The Muqtada militia is militarily defeated. We have killed scores of them over the last few weeks, and that is in Najaf alone. [...] The militia have been defeated, or have left.&quot; June 6 effectively marked the end of Shi&#x27;ite uprising. The total number of Mahdi Army militiamen killed in the fighting across Iraq is estimated at between 1,500 and 2,000. 

The return of Najaf to Iraqi security forces following the cease-fire left Sadr City as the last bastion of Mahdi Army guerrillas still pursuing violent resistance. Clashes continued periodically in the district following the end of the Najaf-Kufa battles. On June 24, Mahdi Army declared an end to operations in Sadr City as well, effectively ending militia activity, at least for the time being.

After the June 4 truce with the occupation forces, al-Sadr took steps to disband the Mahdi Army. In a statement, he called on militia members from outside Najaf to &quot;do their duty&quot; and go home. US forces in Najaf were then replaced by Iraqi police. Al-Sadr told supporters not to attack Iraqi security forces and announced his intention to form a party and enter the 2005 elections. He said the interim government was an opportunity to build a unified Iraq. Interim President Ghazi Yawer gave assurances that al-Sadr could join the political process provided he abandoned his militia. Iraqi officials also assured al-Sadr that he was not to face arrest.

====August hostilities====
After Sadr&#x27;s militia besieged a police station in Najaf and the local governor called for assistance, the US military intervened again. US troops arrested Sadr&#x27;s representative in Karbala, Sheikh Mithal al Hasnawi on July 31 and surrounded al-Sadr&#x27;s home on August 3. British troops in Basra also moved against al-Sadr followers, arresting four on August 3. After the expiration of a noon deadline to release them on August 5, the Basra militiamen declared holy war on British forces.

On August 5, via his spokesman Ahmed al-Shaibany, al-Sadr re-affirmed his commitment to the truce and called on US forces to honour the truce. He announced that if the restoration of the cease-fire failed &quot;then the firing and igniting of the revolution will continue&quot;. The offer was rejected by the governor of Najaf, Adnan al-Zurufi (&quot;There is no compromise or room for another truce&quot;) and US officials (&quot;This is one battle we really do feel we can win&quot;).

In the days that followed fighting continued around the old city of Najaf, in particular at the Imam Ali shrine and the cemetery. The Mahdi Army, estimated at 2,000 in Najaf, was outnumbered by some 2,000 US troops and 1,800 Iraqi security forces, and at a disadvantage due to the vastly superior American tactics, training, firepower and airpower, such as helicopters and AC-130 gunships. On August 13, the militia was trapped in a cordon around the Imam Ali shrine. While negotiations continued between the interim government and the Mahdi Army, news came that al-Sadr had been wounded.

On August 12, British journalist James Brandon, a reporter for the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; was kidnapped in Basra by unidentified militants. A videotape was released, featuring Brandon and a hooded militant, threatening to kill the British hostage unless US forces withdrew from Najaf within 24 hours. In a feature, Brandon describes being beaten, pistol-whipped, and forced to participate in mock executions. He said he escaped after holding a woman at knife-point, to a government building where guards found him, but they phoned his kidnappers, who arrived to collect him. Despite telling them repeatedly that he was a journalist, they assumed he was a spy or agent for the occupation until they saw a report about the kidnap on al-Arabiya television. Afterwards, Brandon&#x27;s treatment improved markedly and he was released after less than a day, following intervention by al-Sadr. At a press conference, Brandon commented on his treatment and thanked his kidnappers: &quot;Initially I was treated roughly, but once they knew I was a journalist I was treated very well and I want to say thank you to the people who kidnapped me.&quot; A spokesman for al-Sadr said: &quot;We apologise for what happened to you. This is not our tradition, not our rules. It is not the tradition of Islam.&quot; Brandon was delivered to the British military police who gave him medical treatment and escorted him to Kuwait the following day. Brandon planned to see his family and go on holiday but said he wanted to return to Iraq : &quot;Only next time, I just want to do the reporting. I have no desire to be the story again.&quot;

The fact that American troops surrounded the Shrine led to an impasse as the Mahdi army could not leave the shrine and US troops did not want to offend Islam by setting foot inside the shrine. The standoff did not end for three weeks until Sistani emerged from convalescence in London and brokered an agreement between the two forces.

====Iraqi reactions====
The uprising seemed to draw an ambivalent reaction from the Iraqi population, which for the most part neither joined nor resisted the rebels. Many Iraqi security forces melted away, wishing to avoid confrontation. In a sign of Mahdi Army&#x27;s unpopularity in Najaf, however, which follows more traditionalist clerics, a small covert movement sprung up to launch attacks on the militants. The uprising did receive a good deal of support from Shiite radicals in Baghdad, however, who were galvanized by the simultaneous siege of the city of Fallujah.

===2005===
Loyalists to al-Sadr ran under the National Independent Cadres and Elites banner in the 2005 Iraqi election. Though a number of the movement&#x27;s supporters felt that the election was invalid. The party finished sixth overall in the election and was represented in the transitional legislature. Another twenty or so candidates aligned with al-Sadr ran for the United Iraqi Alliance.

The movement is believed to have infiltrated the Iraqi police forces, and to have been involved in the September 2005 arrest of two British soldiers by Iraqi police.

On December 4, 2005, former Prime Minister Iyad Allawi was assaulted by a mob in Najaf, where the Mahdi Army is influential.

=== October 2006 battle ===
In mid-October, a roadside bomb killed Qassim al-Tamimi, the chief of investigations for the provincial police force and a member of the rival Badr Organization. Badr fighters blamed the Mahdi Army for the killing and in response to this, the police captured a brother of the suspected bomber, who was a member of the Mahdi Army. Fighting began on October 17, when 800 masked members of the Mahdi army stormed three police stations in Amarah. Several firefights occurred between the militia and police over the course of the next four days.

By the morning of October 20, 2006, local leaders and residents said that victorious Mahdi fighters were patrolling the city on foot and in commandeered police vehicles and were setting up roadblocks. Sheik al-Muhamadawi stated early October 20 that &quot;there is no state in the city. Policemen do not have enough weapons and ammunition compared with the militia, which has all kinds of weapons.&quot; At least 27 people were killed and 118 wounded in the clashes.

The Mahdi Army eventually withdrew from their positions in Amarah following negotiations between local tribal and political leaders and representatives from the Baghdad offices of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. A battalion from the Iraqi Army sent from Basra then took control of the city.

The stunning and defiant display of militia strength underscored the weaknesses of the Iraqi security forces and the potency of the Mahdi Army, which had been able to operate virtually unchecked in Iraq. This caused many to accuse the Mahdi Army of starting the Civil War in Iraq.

===August 2007 – March 2008 ceasefire===
In August 2007, during fighting between the Mahdi Army and Iraqi police in Karbala, Muqtada al-Sadr called for a ceasefire and urged Mahdi Army members to stop fighting. The cease-fire has been credited with helping to reduce violence in Iraq between the Mahdi Army and Iraqi Army since August 2007. Amid fears of the ending of the ceasefire in February 2008, it was extended for a further six months by al-Sadr on February 22, 2008.

===March 2008 Iraqi security forces crackdown===

On March 25, 2008, thousands of Iraqi troops carried out a military strike against the Mahdi Army in their stronghold of Basra. This operation, code-named Operation Charge of the Knights, was the first of its kind since British troops withdrew from the city centre.

Clashes took place between security forces and the militants loyal to Muqtada al-Sadr after a dawn military offensive in the southern city. In Al-Sadr&#x27;s headquarters of Najaf, the cleric ordered the field commanders of his Mahdi Army militia to go to &#x27;maximum alert&#x27; and prepare &quot;to strike the occupiers&quot;. Gunmen also reportedly clashed with Iraqi police in the southern city of Kut.

The Mahdi Army launched a nationwide civil disobedience campaign across Iraq to protest raids and detentions against the Mahdi Army. The discord threatened to unravel al-Sadr&#x27;s ceasefire, spark renewed sectarian violence, and prompt the United States to delay troop withdrawals. Violent rivalries among Shiites had been predicted by many observers ahead of the 2008 Iraqi governorate elections, which were to be held by October 1, 2008.

Concurrently, on April 6, Iraqi and U.S. forces moved into the southern third of Sadr City to prevent rocket and mortar fire from the area against the Green Zone. U.S. engineers began construction of a concrete barrier along al-Quds Street to seal the southern third of the city off and allow reconstruction to take place. Over the next month, the Mahdi Army launched a number of attacks on the troops building the barrier but sustained heavy losses. On May 11, al-Sadr concluded a cease-fire agreement with Iraqi security forces, ending the battle. Mahdi Army losses were estimated at between 700 and 1,000 casualties.

===Disbandment and resurgence in 2014===
On August 28, 2008, al-Sadr ordered the Mahdi Army to suspend military activity indefinitely. Later, however, al-Sadr created either two or three new organizations to take the place of the Mahdi Army: the Promised Day Brigades, established in November 2008 as a militia, and the Muhamidoon, which focuses on social work and religious education. A 2010 Associated Press report also mentioned a third wing, the Monaseroun, responsible for &quot;the mobilization of supporters&quot;.

Since 2008, rumors of a Mahdi Army resurgence have cropped up periodically. In April 2010, after winning 40 of 325 seats in the 2010 parliamentary elections, Sadr called for its reestablishment.

In 2014 al-Sadr announced the formation of the &quot;Peace Companies&quot;, to protect Shia shrines from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

==Iran&#x27;s influence==
Although Muqtada Al-Sadr has historically had close ties to Iran, he has generally opposed Iranian clerical and political influence in Iraq. Unlike the Al-Hakim family, of the Supreme Iraqi Islamic Council and many leaders of the Dawa party who fled to Iran following the Persian Gulf War and remained there in exile until the American invasion in 2003, Muqtada al-Sadr and his family remained in Iraq throughout Saddam&#x27;s rule. The refusal to leave Iraq garnered the Sadr family much support during and after the collapse of Saddam&#x27;s regime. Early 2006, al-Sadr pledged military support to Iran and other neighboring Islamic countries if they were to be attacked by a foreign nation. Since then, however, Al-Sadr has opposed the Dawa Party, and in 2006 Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki ordered a major offensive targeting the Mahdi Army in Basra.

In late 2007 or 2008, Muqtada al-Sadr moved to Iran and spent several years studying Shia jurisprudence in Qom before returning to Najaf in 2011.

==Activities==
As of August 2006, the Mahdi Army rarely challenged coalition troops on a wide scale. Neither the coalition nor the Iraqi government made any move to arrest al-Sadr. The Mahdi Army participated in battles against Sunni insurgents and operated its own justice system in the areas it controlled. The Mahdi Army operated death squads that frequently killed Sunni civilians particularly during the civil war phase of the Iraq war.

==Structure==
When reporting on an early October 2006 clash between the Mahdi Army and Coalition troops in Diwaniyah, BBC news suggested that at the time, the Mahdi Army was not a homogeneous force, with local groups apparently acting on own initiative.

In September 2006, a senior coalition intelligence official had remarked to reporters how there were political fractures within Al-Sadr&#x27;s organization in protest of his relatively moderate political course of action, with one coalition intelligence official claiming that at least six major leaders no longer answer to al-Sadr and as many as a third of the army was now out of his direct control.

<doc id="578965" wikidata="Q2943854" url="?curid=578965" title="Greenbelt (Ottawa)">
<text>The Greenbelt is a protected green belt traversing Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It includes green space, forests, farms, and wetlands from Shirleys Bay in the west and to Green&#x27;s Creek in the east. It is the largest publicly owned green belt in the world and the most ecologically diverse area in Eastern Ontario. The National Capital Commission (NCC) owns and manages , and the rest is held by other federal government departments and private interests. Real estate development within the Greenbelt is strictly controlled.

The Greenbelt lies within eight kilometers of Parliament Hill in downtown Ottawa and ranges in width from two to ten kilometers. It encircles many of the oldest communities in the City of Ottawa, and covers the same amount of land as the urbanized area of Ottawa that it surrounds.

==History==
The Greenbelt was proposed by Jacques Gréber in 1950 as part of his master plan for Ottawa, and the federal government started expropriating land in 1956. The majority of the lands were purchased by 1966 at an approximate cost of million (in 1966 dollars), of which around were acquired through expropriation. 

Its original purpose included the prevention of urban sprawl (which was threatening the rural areas surrounding the city), as well as to provide open space for the future development of farms, natural areas and government campuses. At the time, the greenbelt was &quot;intended to circumscribe an area large enough for the accommodation of some 500,000 persons. The inner limit was chosen by considering what area could be economically provided with municipal services.&quot;

Growth beyond the 500,000 to 600,000 limit anticipated within the Greenbelt was planned to take place in satellite towns in rural areas beyond it, although these areas were not designated by the master plan. This proposal to build satellite towns was based on Ebenezer Howard&#x27;s 1898 Social Cities scheme and also drew on Patrick Abercrombie&#x27;s &quot;Greater London Plan&quot;, especially in the proposals for the Greenbelt to be implemented by development regulations.

Prior to the completion of the Greber Plan, the Ottawa Area Planning Board (OAPB) was created in 1947 to control unregulated suburban expansion. Despite its creation, suburban townships continued to approve low-density subdivisions without municipal services. In an effort to stop low-density suburban expansion, the City of Ottawa successfully annexed rural township lands to the future proposed inside boundary of the Greenbelt in 1948. The rural townships fought the annexation and continued to refuse to zone parts of their land to accommodate a Greenbelt after their loss. After six years of conflict with the rural townships, it became clear that unlike in the &quot;Greater London Plan&quot;, it would not be possible to establish a Greenbelt using Ontario and Quebec planning legislation alone. As a result, in 1956 the Government of Canada decided to buy or expropriate Greenbelt lands as required.

Despite these efforts, research planner H.A. Hossé noted as early as 1960 that there were signs that the Ottawa Greenbelt would not be able to restrain urban sprawl. The surrounding rural townships of Nepean and Gloucester retained zoning jurisdiction on lands outside the Greenbelt and encouraged their continuing development to increase municipal tax revenues. The Greenbelt was easily crossed by car in a few minutes, and this did not stop civil servants from seeking more affordable homes outside of it. He concluded that without an active program of planning control by the local municipalities involved, or by the province, growth would continue unabated outside the Greenbelt. 
At the same time the Greenbelt was being assembled, developers were purchasing land beyond the belt for future use. The population grew much faster than Gréber had predicted, and his population forecast for the year 2000 was reached as early as 1970. In 1965, the suburb of Kanata was built west of the Greenbelt in the Township of March, and the suburban communities of Orleans (Gloucester/Cumberland Township) and Barrhaven (Nepean Township) grew up quickly to the east and south of Greenbelt lands, even before the inner city had filled out. Highway development followed this suburban population growth, with Ontario Highway 417 to Montreal built through the eastern Greenbelt in 1975 and Ontario Highway 416 extended south through the southwestern Greenbelt in 1996.

The rapid population increase encouraged suburban politicians to press for more development outside Greenbelt lands. With the formation of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa–Carleton in 1969, suburban and rural politicians, who had a majority on the regional council used their power to press for urban expansion. Urban boundaries were continually expanded to incorporate further development on former farmland. This general pattern continued following municipal amalgamation in 2001.
The result of these ongoing policies can be seen in local settlement patterns. In 1971, 90 per cent of Ottawa homes were inside the Greenbelt. Seven per cent were in rural areas and only three per cent were in the suburbs. By 2007, only 65 per cent of households were inside the Greenbelt, while suburbs were home to 26 per cent of the city&#x27;s total households. In that time, 60 per cent of Ottawa&#x27;s population growth was outside the Greenbelt. From 2005 to 2016 it was typical for there to be roughly twice as many housing starts outside the Greenbelt than inside.

One outcome of this pattern of development outside the Greenbelt is an increased infrastructure burden on the city. While homes inside the Greenbelt pay the full cost of their development, it has been estimated that those in the suburbs receive the equivalent of a taxpayer subsidy due the gap between development charges and infrastructure costs to the city. Urban planner and geographer Barry Wellar has estimated that this subsidy may be as high as per house when the long-term maintenance costs of roads, bridges, pipes and transit equipment are factored in.

==Development==
The City of Ottawa is undergoing an Official Plan Review which, among other things, examines the need for additional land for urban purposes. It considers whether a discussion of urban land should include the option of some development within the Greenbelt and it is intended that this discussion will feed into the NCC’s review of the Greenbelt Master Plan. All views expressed in [the] White Paper are those of the City of Ottawa and not those of the National Capital Commission which owns and operates the Greenbelt. The City of Ottawa has identified more than of the Greenbelt, worth about $1.6 billion, that could be developed, and in their view, without damaging its overall integrity. Environment Minister Jim Prentice, opposed development in what he considered an important part of the city&#x27;s heritage. Prentice vowed to fight any such move.

In 2020, columnist Randall Denley of the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; described the Greenbelt as &quot;a failed attempt to contain growth, not a collection of natural treasures&quot;, and supported development within the Greenbelt because &quot;it would give the city the land capacity it requires and deliver all the environmental, transportation and practical benefits that environment groups envision&quot;, while Ottawa city staff stated &quot;Expanding urban lands within the Greenbelt is a more efficient use of resources than beyond it.&quot;

==Conservation==
Throughout its history, the NCC has acted to preserve or enhance the natural environment of Greenbelt lands. In 1961, they entered into a 50 year forest management agreement with the Government of Ontario, which lead to the reforestation of abandoned and marginal farmland. The Pine Grove and Pinhey forests were largely the result of that initiative. In the 1970s, the ecological significance of areas such as the Mer Bleue and Stony Swamps were recognized and efforts were taken to protect them. Additional parts of Mer Bleue swamp were acquired and the overall biodiversity of the Greenbelt increased. Walking and ski trails were also created to allow for increased recreational use of these natural areas.

==Wildlife==
The Greenbelt is home to a variety of wildlife:

*Mammals: bat, bear, beaver, coyote, cottontail rabbit, fisher, muskrat, porcupine, raccoon, red fox, red squirrel, snowshoe hare, skunk, white-tailed deer, rarely moose
*Birds: barred owl, screech owl, great grey owl, Canada goose, sandhill crane, great blue heron, red-tailed hawk, American kestrel, spruce grouse, woodcock, blue jay, chickadee
*Insects: walking stick, praying mantis, butterflies
*Reptiles/Amphibians: common garter snake, painted turtle, snapping turtle

==Communities==
Communities located within the Greenbelt:
*Ashdale
*Bells Corners
*Blackburn Hamlet
*Kempark
*Merivale Gardens

==Places of interest==
Places of interest within the Greenbelt are from east to west:
*Green&#x27;s Creek Conservation Area – a nature reserve of a small tributary of the Ottawa River, cutting through a lush clay valley. 
*Hornets Nest soccer fields – 11 soccer fields and an air-supported dome for indoor soccer. 
*Pine View Golf Course – 36-hole public golf course 
*Mer Bleue Conservation Area – sphagnum peat bog. There are some of walking trails, including a boardwalk, through a remarkable boreal-like ecosystem normally not found this far south. Stunted black spruce, tamarack, together with bog rosemary, blueberry, and cottongrass, are some of the unusual species that have adapted to the acidic waters of the bog. The Mer Bleue bog (French for &quot;Blue Sea&quot;) got its name from the autumn morning fogs that make it appear as a blue sea. 
*Pine Grove Forest – of mixed-use forest for hiking, wildlife reserve, and forestry. 
*Conroy Pit – a site on a former sand/gravel pit off Conroy Road near Hunt Club Road, now used primarily as an off-leash dog park and for tobogganing in the winter. It has several kilometres (miles) of urban forest trails and wide open areas. The north end of the pit features a large toboggan hill. 
*Hylands Golf Club – 36-hole public golf course 
*Macdonald-Cartier International Airport – Ottawa&#x27;s main airport for domestic, international, and general aviation. 
*Agriculture Canada Research Farms – site for research in animal disease prevention and treatment. 
*The Log Farm – a restored homestead from 1857, with guided tours. 
*Bruce Pit – a second former sand/gravel pit off Cedarview Road between Hunt Club Road and Baseline Road. It is now used as an off-leash dog park, and has a cross-country trail system and a toboggan hill. 
*Lime Kiln (Trail) – trail to remains of 19th-century Flood industrial lime kiln.
*Stony Swamp Conservation Area – of provincially significant wetland. It is also the largest forested area within the Greenbelt and is popular for hiking and outdoor recreation. It is also the study area for the Macoun Field Club.
*Wesley Clover Parks (formerly the Nepean National Equestrian Park and the Ottawa Municipal Campground ) - an equestrian facility and public campground with 127 serviced sites
*The 19th Tee Driving Range – golf driving range and 18 hole mini-putt park. 
*Connaught National Army Cadet Summer Training Centre – Military and cadet training centre, also used by private shooting associations. 
*Shirleys Bay – an important wetland on the Ottawa River, home to migratory birds and water fowl. This location is ideally suited for bird watching.

<doc id="578968" wikidata="Q1340479" url="?curid=578968" title="Air Sinai">
<text>Air Sinai ( &quot;&quot;) was an airline based in Cairo, Egypt. It operated as a &#x27;paper airline&#x27; for parent company Egyptair under a wet lease-like agreement to serve flights exclusively between Egypt and Israel.

==History==
The Egypt–Israel peace treaty signed in March 1979 stipulated that there must be active civilian aviation routes between Egypt and Israel. To fulfill the treaty, Air Sinai was established in 1982 to fly scheduled services between Egypt and Israel (on routes previously flown by Nefertiti Aviation), which for political reasons could not be handled by parent company Egyptair.

Services started using a Boeing 737-200 leased from Egyptair and new routes from Egypt&#x27;s tourist destinations followed. By the mid-1980s a Fokker F27 Friendship was also in use on these services. During 1982, a Boeing 707-320C was leased and operated on behalf of Egyptair on their flights to Europe, especially twice weekly from Cairo to Copenhagen.

Due to the tense Egypt–Israel relations, the airline operated discreetly: for a long time it had no website, public schedule of flights, markings on planes, signs at the airports, or a way to make online bookings. Air Sinai ceased airline operations in its own right in 2002 and from then on operated as a &#x27;paper airline&#x27; for its parent company, Egyptair, using their aircraft without any markings identifying either carrier, although some aircraft were spotted during this era in Tel Aviv in full Egyptair branding. Flights were not listed in Egyptair schedules and did not appear on their website or route maps either. As of 2014, Air Sinai flights were displayed on arrival and departure boards at Cairo Airport using the IATA code 4D. In February 2020, online booking was introduced via a website run by a third-party travel agency based in the United Kingdom.

On October 3, 2021, Egyptair commenced operating direct flights from Cairo to Tel Aviv under its livery, bringing an end to the Air Sinai era.

==Destinations==
Until 2021, Air Sinai served the following destinations on behalf of Egyptair.

;Egypt
* Cairo – Cairo International Airport

;Israel
* Tel Aviv – Ben Gurion International Airport

==Fleet==
Due to the nature of its operations, Air Sinai used two unmarked Airbus A220 aircraft, SU-GFA &amp; SU-GFD owned by Egyptair to operate its flights. Other types, including larger aircraft were also used based on operational requirements, with Egyptair markings then being removed. On some occasions, Egyptair branded aircraft have also been utilised.

In September 2019, it was announced the airline would replace Embraer 170 operations with Airbus A220 aircraft operated by Egyptair from 1 March 2020. In December 2019, the first Airbus A220 flight was moved forward to 9 December 2019.

In May 2021, Air Sinai&#x27;s Airbus A220 have been removed from service, and subsequently begun flying for Nigeria&#x27;s Ibom Air.

<doc id="578971" wikidata="Q5606522" url="?curid=578971" title="Gregg Easterbrook">
<text>Gregg Edmund Easterbrook (born March 3, 1953) is an American writer and a contributing editor of both &quot;The New Republic&quot; and &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;. He has authored ten books (six nonfiction, one of humor, and three literary novels), and writes for op-ed pages, magazines, and journals.

==Early life and education==
Gregg Easterbrook was born in Buffalo, New York, the son of George Easterbrook, a dentist, and Vimy Hoover Easterbrook, a teacher. Easterbrook attended Kenmore West High School in Tonawanda, New York. He has a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from Colorado College and a master&#x27;s in journalism from Northwestern University.

==Career==
In 1979, Easterbrook became an editor of &quot;The Washington Monthly&quot;. In 1981, he joined &quot;The Atlantic&quot; as a staff writer, later becoming national correspondent; since 1988, he has been a contributing editor.

Easterbrook has been a political columnist for Reuters, a senior editor and then contributing editor to &quot;The New Republic&quot;, and a fellow in economic studies and then in governance studies at the Brookings Institution (that fellowship lasted for nine years up until 2011). He has lectured at the Aspen Institute and Chautauqua Institution, and spoken at many colleges.

Easterbrook&#x27;s journalistic style has been characterized as &quot;hyper-logical&quot; and he himself as &quot;a thoughtful, deliberate, and precise journalist ... a polymath and a quick study.&quot; His areas of interest include environmental policy, global warming, space policy, social science research, Christian theology, and sports — especially professional football. In 2017, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences.

===Football column===
Easterbrook writes the eclectic football column &quot;Tuesday Morning Quarterback&quot; (TMQ), originally published by &quot;Slate&quot; in 2000, and then on ESPN.com starting in 2002. TMQ was published for two weeks on the independent website Football Outsiders, and then by NFL.com, moving back to ESPN.com prior to the 2006 season. The column relocated to the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 2015, then to &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; in 2017. The column went on hiatus for the 2019 season and resumed with the 2023 season, as a newsletter. 

Fans of the TMQ column include journalist Chuck Todd who has described it as &quot;the best and most compelling sports column anywhere&quot;. Detractors include Drew Magary (then an editor at the website Deadspin) who said of one Easterbrook column that his thesis lacks &quot;any basis in reality&quot;.

===&quot;A Moment on the Earth&quot;===
Easterbrook wrote the book &quot;A Moment on the Earth&quot; (1995), subtitled &quot;the coming age of environmental optimism,&quot; which presaged Bjørn Lomborg&#x27;s book &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot;, first published in Danish three years later; Easterbrook argued that many environmental indicators, with the notable exception of greenhouse gas production, are positive. He called the environmental movement &quot;among the most welcome social developments of the twentieth century,&quot; but criticized environmentalists who promoted what he saw as overly pessimistic views that did not accept signs of improvement and progress.

&quot;A Moment on the Earth&quot; proved to be very controversial, especially among environmentalists. Easterbrook was accused of mischaracterizing data concerning environmental health, using faulty logic, and being overly optimistic. Other reviewers, like Michael Specter in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, had praise for the book&#x27;s efforts to raise positive points in the debate over environmental policy.

Norman Borlaug, one of the most important figures in the Green Revolution, was the subject of an admiring Easterbrook article in 1997, and again in 2009 marking Borlaug&#x27;s passing. Both articles said that Borlaug had disproved the earlier dire predictions of Paul R. Ehrlich, author of the 1968 book &quot;The Population Bomb&quot;. Ehrlich has severely criticized Easterbrook&#x27;s 1995 book &quot;A Moment on the Earth&quot;.

Until 2006, Easterbrook was skeptical about whether global warming was a serious manmade problem, pointing out several times that even the National Academy of Sciences had expressed doubt about whether global warming was caused by humans. He publicly modified his position in 2006 as a result of scientific developments. Easterbrook wrote:

[T]he science has changed from ambiguous to near-unanimous. As an environmental commentator, I have a long record of opposing alarmism. But based on the data I&#x27;m now switching sides regarding global warming, from skeptic to convert. Once global-warming science was too uncertain to form the basis of policy decisions — and this was hardly just the contention of oil executives. ... Clearly, the question called for more research. That research is now in, and it shows a strong scientific consensus that an artificially warming world is a real phenomenon posing real danger. ...

He says that greenhouse gas emissions must be curbed in order to win the fight against climate change. Easterbrook anticipates that climate change could benefit some regions, even while causing drastic problems elsewhere.

===Other books===
Easterbrook has written three novels: &quot;This Magic Moment&quot; (1986), &quot;The Here and Now&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Leading Indicators&quot; (2012). &quot;This Magic Moment&quot; is a love story as well as a philosophical work about the meaning of life. The second novel (&quot;The Here and Now&quot;) was called &quot;moving&quot; by both the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and tells a &quot;satisfying tale of disillusionment and redemption&quot; in the opinion of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. According to Kirkus Reviews, &quot;The Leading Indicators&quot; provides social commentary in the form of literary fiction, filtering &quot;leveraged buyouts, derivatives marketing and multimillion-dollar CEO bonuses through the lens of one ... family.&quot;

Among his nonfiction books, &quot;Beside Still Waters&quot; (1998) is a work of Christian theology, discussing whether religion matters as much as it did before we gained so much knowledge about ourselves and the world. The book &quot;Tuesday Morning Quarterback&quot; (2001) — not to be confused with his similar column of the same name — uses haiku and humor to analyze pro football.

 Another of Easterbrook&#x27;s books, focusing on social science, is &quot;The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse&quot; (2003), which explores people&#x27;s perception of their own well-being. The book cites statistical data indicating that Americans are better off in terms of material goods and amount of free time but are not happier than before. Easterbrook argues that this has occurred due to choice anxiety (too many decisions to make) and abundance denial (not realizing how well we are doing). His proposed remedy is to make our lives more meaningful by doing good while living well.

His book &quot;Sonic Boom: Globalization at Mach Speed&quot; (2009) asserts that globalization has only just begun and is a good thing to look forward to. Another book, &quot;The King of Sports: Football&#x27;s Impact on America&quot; (2013) says that American football in many ways reflects the cultural contradictions of the United States.

===Other activities and areas of interest===
Easterbrook was a longtime critic of the Space Shuttle program. After the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster in 1986, his prescience made him a frequent commentator on space issues. He has also been critical of the International Space Station, because of its expense and the feasibility of conducting the same experiments on Earth instead of in orbit. Easterbrook has called a proposed crewed mission to Mars &quot;ridiculously impractical&quot;, and has written that the rationale for a proposed permanent base on the Moon is closely tied to pork barrel politics. He has supported other NASA projects such as using uncrewed space probes and protecting Earth from asteroids.

Easterbrook had a blog at &quot;The New Republic Online&quot;, until mid-2004. In October 2003, he wrote a blog post critical of what he considered to be the senseless violence in the Quentin Tarantino film &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, saying that, &quot;Recent European history alone ought to cause Jewish [movie] executives to experience second thoughts about glorifying the killing of the helpless as a fun lifestyle choice.&quot; This caused an uproar, and Easterbrook wrote that he &quot;mangled&quot; his own ideas by his choice of words, and apologized. &quot;The New Republic&quot; accepted blame for the piece in a further apology, and denied that his comments were intentionally anti-Semitic. Disney, the parent of the film&#x27;s distributor Miramax Films and ESPN, fired Easterbrook in October 2003.

Besides writing for many magazines, journals, and op-ed pages on a wide variety of subjects, and producing books of his own, Easterbook has also written various book chapters. An example is a book chapter about the 9-11 terrorist attacks.

==Personal==
Easterbrook is married to Nan Kennelly, an American diplomat. He is the brother of Judge Frank H. Easterbrook and Neil Easterbrook, English professor at Texas Christian University. Gregg Easterbrook lives in Bethesda, Maryland.

<text>Andria (English: &quot;The Woman from Andros&quot;) is a Roman comedy adapted by Terence from two Greek plays by Menander the first being &quot;Samia&quot; and the other being &quot;Perinthia&quot;. It was the first play by Terence to be presented publicly, and was performed in 166 BC during the Ludi Megalenses. 

By the time of Cicero, roughly a century later (56 BC), the play had become well-known as the source of (or along with) the line &quot;Hinc illae lacrimae!&quot; (&quot;hence those tears!&quot;; act 1, scene 1, v. 126), as the orator made use of this latter in a speech (&quot;Pro Caelio&quot;) defending his erstwhile student Marcus Caelius Rufus; and even thirty-six years thence—in 20 BC—the play and the phrase were evidently still popular enough that Horace could quote it in his &quot;Epistulae I&quot; and expect the allusion to be recognized. 

&quot;Andria&quot; became the first of Terence&#x27;s plays to be performed post-antiquity, in Florence in 1476, and it was adapted by Machiavelli, whose &quot;Andria&quot; was likewise the author&#x27;s first venture into playwriting and was the first of Terence&#x27;s plays to be translated into English ca. 1520. The second English translation was by the Welsh writer Morris Kyffin in 1588.

*Simo – Athenian nobleman, father of Pamphilus. From &#x27;simos&#x27;, flat-nosed.
*Sosia – Simo&#x27;s freedman, party to Simo&#x27;s initial plans but is not seen after the first scene. From &#x27;sozo&#x27;, saved in war.
*Pamphilus – Simo&#x27;s son publicly betrothed to Philumena but privately promised to Glycerium. From &#x27;pan&#x27; and &#x27;philos&#x27;, a friend to all.
*Davus – Pamphilus&#x27; slave. From Dacia, his native country.
*Chremes – Athenian nobleman friend and peer of Simo, father of Philumena.
*Charinus – friend of Pamphilus, in love with Philumena. From &#x27;charis&#x27;, grace.
*Byrrhia – Charinus&#x27; slave. From &#x27;purrhos&#x27;, red-haired. 
*Mysis – Glycerium&#x27;s slave. From Mysia, her native country.
*Lesbia – An old nurse or midwife who attends Glycerium. From Lesbos, her native country.
*Dromo – presumably also a slave of Simo&#x27;s, has two short lines and is undeveloped as a character. From &#x27;dromo&#x27;, a race.
*Crito – Andrian nobleman, an acquaintance of Glycerium and a friend of her father.
*Chrysis – an unseen character who dies before the start of the play, Glycerium&#x27;s sister. She immigrated to Athens from Andros and after a time of eking out a living at the loom became a harlot.
*Glycerium – an unseen character, beloved of Pamphilus. From &#x27;glukeros&#x27;, sweet.

According to the ancient commentator Donatus, the characters of Charinus and Byrrhia were not in the original Menander play, but were copied by Terence from a different Menander play (the &quot;Perinthian&quot;) so that Philumena would not be left without a husband when Pamphilus married Glycerium. Another part of the &quot;Perinthian&quot; apparently used by Terence was the dialogue in the first scene, with the substitution of the freedman Sosia for the old man&#x27;s wife. It seems that the original &quot;Andrian&quot; of Menander began with a soliloquy.

==Plot==
Pamphilus has a secret relationship with Glycerium (the eponymous but unseen girl from Andros) and has made her pregnant. But meanwhile his father has arranged for him to marry Chremes&#x27;s daughter Philumena. However, following Pamphilus&#x27; behaviour at the funeral of Glycerium&#x27;s sister Chrysis, a woman of loose morals, Chremes withdraws his permission for the union.

Wishing to publicly shame his son for his dalliance with a woman of low birth, Simo pretends that not only will the match still go ahead but that it is scheduled for that same day. Pamphilus, on the advice of the cunning slave Davus, who has learnt of Simo&#x27;s scheme, accepts the proposal willingly in order to wrong-foot his father. However, the plan goes wrong, since Simo persuades Chremes to again accede to giving his daughter away. This leaves Pamphilus in an awkward position as he has promised Glycerium&#x27;s sister Chrysis on her death bed to protect Glycerium, Glycerium is pregnant with their child and in addition Pamphilus&#x27; friend Charinus is in love with Philumena. Davus faces the three-way wrath of Pamphilus (for his advice), Charinus (for causing the loss of his beloved) and Simo (for double-dealing between him and his son).

The situation is saved by the fortuitous arrival of a stranger from Andros called Crito. He tells the protagonists that Glycerium was not Chrysis&#x27; natural sister. She had been left in her family&#x27;s care when her uncle Phania, while searching for his lost brother, was shipwrecked on Andros and died. Chremes realises that Phania was his brother and therefore he himself is Glycerium&#x27;s true father. He gives Glycerium&#x27;s hand in marriage to Pamphilus which leaves Philumena free to marry Charinus and absolves Davus from fault.

===Prologue===
The poet defends himself against his critics who have accused him of adding parts of Menander&#x27;s play the Perinthian Girl to his Andrian Girl.

===Act one===
Simo tells his freedman Sosia that the nuptials he is preparing for his son Pamphilus are a sham. When Sosia enquires as to the purpose of the sham, Simo tells him of Pamphilus&#x27; shameful secret attachment to Glycerium, the sister of a harlot. While Chremes had previously been so impressed by Pamphilus&#x27; moderate and upright behaviour he had offered his daughter unprompted; but following the uncovering of the affair between Pamphilus and Glycerium at Chrysis&#x27; funeral he has withdrawn his offer. Simo is outraged that Pamphilus does not feel abashed by his private admonition of Pamphilus&#x27; behaviour and is continuing with the appearance of the nuptials so that he will be seen as publicly defying his father. He also hopes he might draw out the roguish plotting of Pamphilus&#x27; slave Davus.

Davus comes out talking to himself and is overheard by Simo. Having made himself known he is told by Simo to ensure the planned nuptials go to plan, as any hint that Davus&#x27; scheming had caused the wedding&#x27;s cancellation will result in Davus being severely punished. After Simo&#x27;s departure Davus vows to undermine Simo&#x27;s plan. He also reveals that in order to curry favour with Simo, Glycerium has concocted a story that she is a free-born citizen of Athens who was shipwrecked as a child on Andros and thus is not of base birth. Davus heaps scorn on this idea.

Glycerium is soon to give birth. Mysis leaves her mistress&#x27; house to make some preparations for this when she overhears Pamphilus bemoaning the fact that his marriage to Philumena is still going ahead. Mysis reveals herself to him. Pamphilus earnestly repeats that he will not desert Glycerium. Mysis leaves to find a midwife.

===Act two===
Charinus and Byrrhia talk, Byrrhia confirms the rumour that Pamphilus is still proceeding with the marriage to Philumena. Charinus declares his love of Philumena and as he is unsure why Pamphilus is going ahead with the match he vows to go and beg him at least to delay. Byrrhia warns him not to as it might appear to Pamphilus that Charinus is effect telling him that he will cuckold him at the first opportunity.

Charinus catches up with Pamphilus and begs him to break-off or delay the wedding. Pamphilus tells him that he would love nothing better than acquiesce to this request and is endeavouring to bring about its termination. Charinus is relieved by this. He dismisses Byrrhia for his poor counsel. Davus approaches them and they surmise from his happy disposition that Davus is unaware of their fated heartbreak. Davus tells them that in fact the planned nuptials are a ruse and that he has checked Chremes&#x27; house and there is no sign of preparations. Charinus leaves happy that he will have his beloved Philumena.

Davus counsels Pamphilus to accept Simo&#x27;s wish to marry. This will cause the match to be publicly ended by Chremes. As a disclosed libertine Simo will be willing to let him marry Glycerium rather than no one at all. Pamphilus agrees but asks Davus to ensure his father does not discover that he has agreed to bring up Glycerium&#x27;s child.

Simo enters to set his trap. Byrrhia enters and hides himself as he is under orders to watch Pamphilus&#x27; movements in regard to Philumena. Simo tells Pamphilus he must marry today. Pamphilus surprises him by agreeing. Byrrhia believes that Pamphilus is betraying his master.

Simo collars Davus and voices his suspicions of Pamphilus&#x27; volte face. Davus parries these queries and the accusation that Davus is somehow plotting against him. Davus says that any unhappiness Simo might have detected was due to Simo&#x27;s mean expense on the celebrations.

===Act three===
Simo and Davus overhear Mysis and Lesbia, who in the course of their conversation reveal that Pamphilus has made a pledge to support Glycerium&#x27;s child. Simo believes that this is a ruse concocted by his son to anger Chremes and thereby end his wedding to Philumena. While they are talking, they hear a cry while Glycerium gives birth to a son.

Simo accuses Davus of advising his master in this deception. Davus denies this. To avoid suspicion as to his true plans, Davus tells Simo this is a plan by Glycerium to keep the attentions of his son and the next move of Glyceium&#x27;s servants will be to place the new-born son on Simo&#x27;s doorstep so as to prevent the wedding.

Simo meets Chremes in the street. Chremes asks why there is a rumour about town that their children will still be wed. Simo implores Chremes to reagree to the match. He reveals that, as Davus has said, Glycerium is faking a birth in order to get back together with Pamphilus. Believing Simo appraisal of the situation Chremes agrees. Simo meets Davus and thanks him for helping with his plans. He &#x27;reveals&#x27; the nuptials had been a sham and says if they now go ahead it is wholly due to Davus&#x27; good advice. Davus privately berates himself. Pamphilus searches for Davus seeking to imprison or kill him for putting him in an intractable situation. Davus implores him to let him redeem himself and promises to come up with something to stop the wedding, but no plan comes to mind.

===Act four===
Charinus on hearing that the wedding will proceed believes that his friend has betrayed him taking Philumena only because he had revealed his love of the girl. He comes on Davus and Pamphilus and accuses his friend. Pamphilus says that it was not his doing but down to the plotting of Davus. Facing a two-time wrath Davus doubles his promise that, somehow, he will extricate Pamphilus from the union. Mysis enters telling Pamphilus that Glycerium needs his presence. Davus tells Charinus that he has a plan but there may not be enough time to pull it off, but he should go and wait in his house.

Davus bids Mysis to stay a moment, and returns with the child. He tells her to place it on the doorstep of Simo&#x27;s household. Davus retires into the background as Chremes comes onto the scene, and then reappears after Chremes has seen what Mysis was doing. Chremes hides himself not realising that Davus knows he is present. Davus berates a confused Mysis for her actions, saying that it would be terrible if Chremes had come on the scene and not him. Chremes reveals himself and says the wedding is off.

Crito arrives in Athens, and on learning of Chrysis&#x27; death berates his ill fortune because, as Glycerium is in reality an orphan, he is Chrysis&#x27; closest relative and will need to take a case to law to claim her estate ahead of Glycerium who will no doubt be defended by some gallant protector.

===Act five===
Chremes berates Simo for enticing him into giving permission for the wedding again. Simo mollifies his rage saying what he saw was a ruse orchestrated by Glycerium and that Davus had even warned him beforehand that this would be attempted in order to break the wedding off. They then spy Davus exiting Glycerium&#x27;s house. They ask him why he was there. Davus replies that he was attending Pamphilus and that there is news that claims Glycerium is an Athenian citizen. Not believing him Simo has Davus arrested. Pamphilus arrives and Simo berates him for breaking his word. Pamphilus responds that he will indeed break his word but that his father ought to listen to Crito&#x27;s story before he scolds him. Crito tells all present that Glycerium is the niece of an Athenian nobleman shipwrecked on Andros while searching for his brother. Chremes reveals that he was that brother and, approving of the match, gives a dowry of ten talents.

==Metrical structure==
The majority (98%) of lines in the &quot;Andria&quot; consist of the following metres:
*iambic senarii (ia6): 52% (this metre was unaccompanied, while the others were sung)
*trochaic septenarii (tr7): 22%
*iambic octonarii (ia8): 18%
*iambic septenarii (ia7): 4%
*cretic quaternarii (cr4): 1%
*trochaic octonarii (tr8): 0.7%

Many Roman comedies, such as Terence&#x27;s Phormio, have a clear metrical structure, with sections generally in the order A = iambic senarii, B = other metres, C = trochaic septenarii. The Andria does not follow this scheme exactly. In several places the iambic senarii are preceded not by trochaic septenarii, but by iambic octonarii and once by iambic septenarii. There are no fewer than 11 polymetric passages with different metres (ia8, ia4, tr7, tr8, tr4) following each other in rapid succession. (The Andria has 90 changes of metre, which is more than any other Terence play.) 

The &quot;Andria&quot; also differs from Plautus&#x27;s plays by its unusually large use of the iambic octonarius metre. Another unusual feature is that it contains a short passage (481–484) in bacchiac quaternarii and another passage (626–639) in various cretic metres, which Terence otherwise mostly avoided.

The different metres are used for different purposes, reflecting the emotional content of the words. The iambic senarii passages are used for narrative and giving background information. They are also used five times in short sections to emphasise a point or give important information. Trochaic septenarii move the plot forward. Iambic octonarii are common when characters express their anxieties. Iambic septenarii, the &quot;metre of love&quot;, are used especially in passages singing about love and marriage. The bacchiac metre, used briefly when the midwife Lesbia comes out of the house, is a solemn metre often sung by women characters.

Compared with a Plautus play such as &quot;Epidicus&quot;, Terence&#x27;s &quot;Andria&quot; has many more changes of metre. Thus the metrical scheme is:
:(1) Davus is warned not to interfere: ABAB, ABC
:(2) Davus suggests a plan: BAB, B(A)C
:(3) Davus carries out his plan: ABABC
:(4) Davus&#x27;s plan goes wrong: ABAB, BBBC, BC, BABBBB 
:(5) Davus escapes punishment: ACB, AC, BC

Overall, however, there is a similarity of plot. In both a wily slave tricks his master and his master&#x27;s friend; in both, the plan goes badly wrong, but the slave escapes punishment in the nick of time by a lucky chance. In the end, in both plays the two old men are placated, a long-lost daughter is found, and the young man of the house gets to keep his girlfriend.

He explains that three years previously a woman had come to the neighbourhood from the island of Andros, and she had had various lovers. When she died, it became obvious that Pamphilus had a relationship with the dead girl&#x27;s sister, whereupon Simo&#x27;s friend Chremes, whose daughter Pamphilus was to marry, had cancelled the engagement.

::– Meanwhile Glycerium&#x27;s slave Mysis approaches with the midwife, Lesbia. Simo and Davus overhear Mysis saying that the young man has promised to bring the baby up. The two women go into Glycerium&#x27;s house. Shortly afterwards Simo and Davus hear Glycerium&#x27;s cries as she gives birth.

<text>John Russell Hind FRS FRSE LLD (12 May 1823 – 23 December 1895) was an English astronomer.

== Life and work ==

John Russell Hind was born in 1823 in Nottingham, the son of lace manufacturer John Hind and Elizabeth Russell, and was educated at Nottingham High School. At age 17 he went to London to serve an apprenticeship as a civil engineer, but through the help of Charles Wheatstone he left engineering to accept a position at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich under George Biddell Airy.
Hind remained there from 1840 to 1844, at which time he succeeded W. R. Dawes as director of the private George Bishop&#x27;s Observatory. In 1853 Hind became Superintendent of the Nautical Almanac, a position he held until 1891.

Hind is notable for being one of the early discoverers of asteroids. He also discovered and observed the variable stars R Leporis (also known as Hind&#x27;s Crimson Star), U Geminorum, and T Tauri (also called Hind&#x27;s Variable Nebula), and discovered the variability of μ Cephei. Hind discovered Nova Ophiuchi 1848 (V841 Ophiuchi), the first object of its type discovered since 1670.

Hind&#x27;s naming of the asteroid 12 Victoria caused some controversy. At the time, asteroids were not supposed to be named after living persons. Hind somewhat disingenuously claimed that the name was not a reference to Queen Victoria, but the mythological figure Victoria.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1863 and President of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1880.

He died in 1895 in Twickenham, London. Hind had married Fanny Fuller in 1846; he and his wife had six children. 
== Honours and legacy ==

* Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1853)
* Fellow of the Royal Society (1863)
* The crater Hind on the Moon
* Asteroid 1897 Hind. Details: 
* Comets C/1847 C1 (Hind) and C/1846 O1 (de Vico-Hind).
* Hind&#x27;s Crimson Star – The red-giant variable star R Leporis
* Hind&#x27;s Variable Nebula – A reflection nebula in Taurus, also known as NGC 1555, associated with the young, irregular variable star T Tauri.

==Notes==
Some sources give his name as John Russel Hind with only one &quot;L&quot;. However, civil records and 19th century British astronomical magazines consistently spell his name with two &quot;L&quot;s.

<doc id="578979" wikidata="Q609090" url="?curid=578979" title="Mark White (Texas politician)">
<text>Mark Wells White Jr. (March 17, 1940 – August 5, 2017) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the 43rd governor of Texas from 1983 to 1987. He also held office as Secretary of State of Texas (1973–1977), and as Texas Attorney General (1979–1983).

White was elected governor in the 1982 gubernatorial election, defeating the incumbent Bill Clements. A member of the Democratic Party, White sought to improve education, transportation, water resources, law enforcement, and taxes to attract new industry to Texas. He appointed the first Hispanic woman to serve as a judge of a district court in Texas, Elma Salinas Ender. In the 1986 gubernatorial election, White lost to former Republican governor Clements, 52.7% to 46.0%.

==Early life==
White was born in Henderson, Texas, to Mark Wells White Sr. and Sarah Elizabeth White. In Houston, he attended Woodrow Wilson Elementary School (now Baker Montessori School), Lanier Junior High School and Lamar High School.

White attended Baylor University in Waco, Texas, where he was a member of the Tryon Coterie Club (now the Texas Lambda chapter of Phi Delta Theta). He subsequently graduated from Baylor Law School in 1965. He was a member of University Masonic Lodge 1190 in Austin, Texas.

==Early roles in state government==
White served as the state&#x27;s assistant attorney general from 1966 to 1969. He later returned to Houston to begin private practice. By 1972, he was working for the Joe Reynolds firm in Houston. White became interested in state government again upon the election of Dolph Briscoe to the Governor&#x27;s Mansion in 1972.

==Texas Secretary of State==

In 1973, White was appointed as Texas Secretary of State under Governor Briscoe and also served in the 36th Infantry Division of the Texas National Guard.

Briscoe explained on his appointment of White as the 74th Texas Secretary of State: &quot;When I began to consider candidates for secretary of state, I realized that it was crucial to appoint someone with legal training who shared my political views and who was loyal, energetic, and personable,&quot; Briscoe wrote in his memoirs. &quot;Mark was a brilliant and ambitious young lawyer as well as an extremely personable young man. I felt that he would make an excellent secretary of state.&quot; Briscoe asked White to come to Austin. But White, Briscoe later recalled, thought the conversation would be about serving in the secretary&#x27;s office and not actually being secretary and was &quot;shocked&quot; to be chosen for the office.

Briscoe wrote:
&quot;In my opinion, Mark White made a fine secretary of state as any governor has ever had... During the legislative sessions, he served as my liaison with [Lieutenant Governor] Bill Hobby. Whenever things weren&#x27;t going well with one of our bills in the Senate, Mark was always ready to go to work on the senators who were having problems supporting the bill. He was a persuasive advocate for our program... He enjoyed doing it, and he had excellent relations with members of the Senate. Mark White&#x27;s talent and ambition would eventually lead to his election as attorney general in 1978 and governor in 1982.&quot;

During his tenure as the state&#x27;s chief elections officer, he streamlined the legal operations and made the services more responsive to the public during his tenure. White was elected president of the National Association of the Secretaries of State in 1977, this was the association&#x27;s highest office — and White was elected secretary and treasurer earlier.

==Texas State Attorney General==
White served as secretary of state until 1977, when he resigned to run for state attorney general, where he served until 1983. First, White defeated former State House Speaker Price Daniel Jr., the son of former Texas Governor Price Daniel, in the Democratic primary and in general election, he comfortably defeated the Republican choice, James A. Baker, III, a Houston lawyer, businessman, and power broker affiliated with the Bush family of Houston. White polled 1,249,846 votes and (55.13 percent) to Baker&#x27;s 999,431 votes and (44.08 percent). The State Attorney General&#x27;s position has been used as a launching pad for gubernatorial candidates.

As the state&#x27;s chief enforcement officer, he co-chaired the Federal-State Enforcement Coordinating Committee and was a member of the Governor&#x27;s Organized Crime Prevention Council. On the national level, he was elected Chairman of the Southern Conference of Attorneys General in May 1981.

==Governor (1983–1987)==
=== 1982 gubernatorial election ===

White declined to seek a second term as state attorney general, but chose to seek the governorship in 1982 against fellow Democrat Bob Armstrong, who was the outgoing state Land Commissioner, who vacated the General Land Office following twelve years, and then the incumbent Bill Clements, Texas&#x27; first Republican governor since Reconstruction. In November 1982, he defeated Clements over concerns about the governor&#x27;s poor economic numbers and lack of support from minority groups. White received 1,697,870 votes (53.2 percent) to Clements&#x27; 1,465,537 (45.9 percent) in a year where Texas Democrats swept all the statewide offices up for grabs; led by U.S. senator Lloyd Bentsen (who won a third six-year term to the Senate) and the legendary Lieutenant Governor of Texas William P. Hobby Jr.

=== Tenure ===
As the state&#x27;s 43rd chief executive from January 18, 1983, to January 20, 1987, White worked to &quot;preserve and enhance... resources so that Texas would not fall back, but go forward as a state of the future&quot;. His main concerns were the economy and education. By focusing on Texas&#x27; resources, White was able to work on many problems facing the state in the early 1980s. The Texas economy during the early and mid-1980s was volatile. The price of oil declined and pushed Texas into a recession. This led Governor White to &quot;lay the groundwork for a more diversified economy—one less reliant upon the ... swings of a single industry&quot;.

White served as governor during Texas&#x27; sesquicentennial in 1986 and oversaw a number of the celebrations concerning that anniversary.

Among White&#x27;s appointments was Elma Salinas Ender as the first Hispanic woman to serve as judge of a district court in Texas. From 1983 until her retirement in 2012, Ender was judge of the 341st Judicial District, based in Laredo. White also appointed Myra McDaniel as the first African American to serve as general counsel to the governor in 1983 and later appointed her as Texas Secretary of State in 1984.

When he took office, Texas was ranked as one of the lowest performing states for the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) also in teachers&#x27; salaries. After taking office, White immediately appointed a committee on Public Education, called a special session of the legislature in 1984, and worked with lawmakers to pass the Educational Opportunity Act (EOA).

By focusing on education, White was able to make Texas a &quot;state of the future&quot; with regard to its most important resource, its children. Through his diligent work as Governor of Texas, many of the problems of the present and future were alleviated.

==== Alaska ====
In 1983 Gov. White reportedly used the phrase &quot;cold, barren place&quot; about the largest American state. The words &quot;we’ll split Alaska in two and make Texas the third largest state&quot; predate this by over a decade. In 1994 &quot;The Economist&quot; printed about &quot;Texas representatives who were trying to block Alaska&#x27;s 
statehood&quot; and a similar threat: &quot;we&#x27;ll divide Alaska.&quot;

=== 1986 gubernatorial election ===

In the 1986 gubernatorial election, White lost to former Republican governor Clements, 52.7% to 46.0%. Some believe that the wildly unpopular &quot;no-pass, no-play&quot; policies of the White administration, which prohibited any high school student athletes from participating in varsity sports if they were failing any single element of their overall class load, sealed the doom of a second term. Clements polled 1,813,779 votes (52.7%) to White&#x27;s 1,584,515 votes (46.1%) in the November 1986 general election and left office on January 20, 1987.

===Post-governorship===
Following his departure from office, White worked for the law firm Keck, Mahin &amp; Cate. White attempted to run for governor again in 1990, but he was defeated in the Democratic primary by state Treasurer Ann Richards, who then defeated Jim Mattox in a runoff election and the Republican Clayton W. Williams, Jr., in the general election. During the 1990 campaign, a campaign commercial depicted White &quot;walking down a hallway displaying larger-than-life photos of the men put to death during his administration in 1983-1986. &#x27;Only a governor can make executions happen,&#x27; White declared as ominous music played in the background. &#x27;I did, and I will.&#x27;&quot; Richards went on to narrowly win the 1990 general election, but was defeated for reelection in 1994.

White practiced law and was chairman of the board of the Houston Independent School District Foundation, a non-profit organization which supports the public schools. White endorsed Houston City Council candidate Jolanda Jones in the 2003 and 2007 city elections. The latter endorsement helped lead to Jones winning an at-large seat on the council. He also endorsed then-United States Senator Barack Obama (D-Illinois) in the Texas primaries for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, which Obama went on to win the presidency.

In 2010, White voiced support for a posthumous exoneration of Cameron Todd Willingham, who is believed by many to be wrongfully convicted and executed for arson and murdering his three daughters. For the first time, White, who had before been a strong supporter of the death penalty and presided over 22 executions as governor, expressed openness to abolition of the death penalty under the reason of the possibility of innocent people being wrongfully executed.

In 2011, White publicly opposed Texas A&amp;M&#x27;s potential departure from the Big 12 conference to join the Southeastern Conference (SEC).

==Death==
White died from a heart attack at his home in Houston on August 5, 2017. He was survived by his wife Linda Gale and his three children. At the time of his death, White had been suffering from kidney cancer for many years.

At his funeral on Wednesday, August 9, 2017 at Second Baptist Church Worship Center in Houston, the officiant was Pastor Homer Edwin Young and among the attendees who were there also included White&#x27;s fellow governors: former U.S. president George W. Bush, United States Secretary of Energy Rick Perry and incumbent governor Greg Abbott. Mourners included former lieutenant governor of Texas William P. Hobby Jr., then-Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, Mayor of Houston Sylvester Turner, former U.S. Congressman Craig Washington, and many others.

On August 10, 2017, White&#x27;s remains lay in state for three hours in the Texas State Capitol. Luci Baines Johnson, daughter of U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, paid tribute to her friend White, who she said &quot;may have left public office, but he never left public service. ... He welcomed the big tent of folks. He was not a divider; he was a unifier.&quot;

He is interred at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin, where a private graveside ceremony was held.

==Legacy==
Mark White Elementary School, a Houston Independent School District elementary school, opened in August 2016.

Mark White&#x27;s son Andrew announced a run for Governor of Texas in 2018. In the March 6, 2018 Democratic Party primary, he placed second, forcing a runoff with former Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez on May 22, 2018. White lost the runoff election, 52% to 47%.

<doc id="578986" wikidata="Q1072539" url="?curid=578986" title="Intentional base on balls">
<text>In baseball, an intentional base on balls, usually referred to as an intentional walk and denoted in baseball scorekeeping by &quot;IBB&quot;, is a walk issued to a batter by a pitcher with the intent of removing the batter&#x27;s opportunity to swing at the pitched ball. A pitch that is intentionally thrown far outside the strike zone for this purpose is referred to as an &quot;intentional ball&quot;.

Beginning with the 2017 season, Major League Baseball has removed the requirement to throw four intentional balls. In MLB and in amateur baseball, such as high school and college games, and in most levels of Little League Baseball, the manager of the team on the field now simply asks the plate umpire to let the batter go to first base. However, beginning in 2023, Little League restricted the procedure to once per game to a single batter. If a batter is to be intentionally walked a second time, four intentional balls must be thrown.

==Strategy==

The purpose of an intentional walk is to bypass the current batter in order to face the following batter, whom the defensive team expects to be easier to put out. The risk to the fielding team issuing an intentional walk is that they turn the batter into a baserunner, which runs counter to the fielding team&#x27;s objective of making outs.

Situations that may call for an intentional walk include the following:
*With one out and a runner on second or third base, converting a powerful batter to a runner on first base means that a subsequent ground ball may become a double play that ends the scoring threat. With a runner on second, this move lets fielders put the lead runner out using a force play rather than the more difficult tag play.
*In the bottom of the ninth or an extra inning, having a runner on first base might not affect the outcome of the game at all. For example, if the game is tied and there is a runner on third base, the game is over if that runner scores. The benefit of an intentional walk is as set out above, and in this case, the risk is minimal.
*Prior to the adoption of the designated hitter rule, if the designated hitter has been discontinued because of substitution rules, or if a defensive replacement has been inserted into the game late, if there were a runner on base, the defense might walk a hitter to instead pitch to the next player if he is an opposing pitcher or a defensive replacement late in a game. This would give the offensive manager a dilemma: the manager could pinch-hit for the pitcher to capitalize on the offensive threat, but at the cost of removing the pitcher or defensive replacement from the game.

The intentional walk disfavors a team that has one batter who is much better than the others, as it often lets opponents &quot;take the bat out of his hands&quot; and opt to pitch to the next batter.

==Rules and scoring==
An intentional base on balls — whether achieved through intentional balls or through declaration — has the effect of any other base on balls. The batter is entitled to take first base without being put out. Any runner already on first base is awarded second base, and so on; if the bases are loaded, an intentional base on balls results in the scoring of a run.

Statistically, receiving an intentional base on balls does not count as an official at bat for a batter, but does count as a plate appearance and a base on balls. An intentional ball is counted as a ball in the count of the pitcher&#x27;s balls and strikes thrown.

===Semi-intentional walk===
Even in leagues where a team can walk a batter by declaration, the pitcher may be instructed to &quot;pitch around&quot; the batter. The manager defers the decision to intentionally walk the pitcher to see whether the batter swings at bad pitches. If the count goes to three balls, where the pitcher would have to deliver an attractive pitch to hit, the manager elects the intentional base on balls. A base on balls counts as an intentional base on balls if and only if the final pitch thrown in the plate appearance is an intentional ball. For example, on August 17, 2004, following an unintentional ball, called strike, and unintentional ball, Barry Bonds was walked with two intentional balls on his third plate appearance. This was scored an intentional walk.

==Technique==
In leagues where a pitcher must throw balls to issue an intentional walk, the catcher signals the intent to walk the batter by standing up in the catcher&#x27;s box and extending one arm straight to the side away from the batter. The pitcher then throws the ball, usually over the opposite batter&#x27;s box, and the catcher usually has to step to the side to catch the ball. This process is repeated four times, or fewer if the decision to issue an intentional walk is made when there are already one or more balls already on the count.

Pitching an intentional ball, like a point after touchdown in football and a free throw in basketball, is designed not to be automatic. The rules on pitcher, catcher, and batter positioning at the time of the pitch still apply, and a pitcher could potentially balk or throw a wild pitch or a passed ball.

The batter can swing at an intentional ball, but cannot leave the batter&#x27;s box to follow the pitch. Swinging is rarely to the batter&#x27;s advantage unless it could yield a better result than the batter reaching first base. An example of such a situation would be if there was a runner on second or third base that would not be forced to advance on an intentional walk, but could advance or even score on a base hit, sacrifice fly, or fielding error. In the Major Leagues, there were 12 cases from 1900 through 2011 of a batter making contact with an intentional ball. In 9 of these cases, the batter reached first base safely (six by hits, one by fielder&#x27;s choice, and two by errors). The batter&#x27;s team won in all nine of those instances. Most recently, on September 10, 2016, the Tampa Bay Rays opted to walk Gary Sanchez of the hosting New York Yankees. He drove an intentional ball to left field for a sacrifice fly.

==History==
Before the 1920 season, the catcher was allowed to set up anywhere within a roughly right triangle behind home plate, the back line being behind the plate. The catcher could stand at a corner of this triangle to receive the four wide pitches, too far away for the batter to have any chance at hitting the ball. As the intentional walk became more frequent following the end of the dead ball era, batters such as Babe Ruth complained about the unfairness of it.

To give the batter a better chance (and to potentially increase scoring and attendance), major league baseball team owners (at the annual rules meeting in Chicago on February 9, 1920) initially attempted to ban the intentional base on balls by instituting a penalty that an intentional ball be counted as a balk (which would award each runner the next base). Veteran NL umpire Hank O&#x27;Day argued successfully against the proposal and the owners succeeded only in mandating that &quot;the catcher must stand with both feet within the lines of the catcher&#x27;s box until the ball leaves the pitcher&#x27;s hand,&quot; a rule still in force today. The newly-redrawn catcher&#x27;s box reduced the back line from behind the plate, and with sides apart.

Intentional walks have been an officially tracked statistic only since 1955.

Prior to the 2017 season, as part of Major League Baseball&#x27;s efforts to improve the pace of play, the rules were amended to allow a manager to order an intentional walk by simply signaling the umpire.

In 2023, Little League made a rule change (Rule 6.08 (2)(a)) restricting the number of intentional walks on a batter by informing the umpire to one per game. If a batter is to be intentionally walked a second time, the catcher must give the signal and four intentional balls must be pitched.

==Records and notable occurrences==

Barry Bonds holds most of the records for intentional walks, including four in a nine-inning game (2004), 120 in a season (2004), 668 in his career—more than the next two players on the all-time list, Albert Pujols (309) and Hank Aaron (293), combined— and 21 in the postseason. Bonds, a prolific home run hitter, was a common target for the intentional walk. In the first month of the 2004 baseball season, Bonds drew 43 walks, 22 of them intentional. He broke his previous record of 68 intentional walks, set in 2002, on July 10, 2004 in his last appearance before the All-Star break.

There are claims that Mel Ott was also intentionally walked four times in a game against the Phillies in 1929 (see below).

Hideki Matsui drew five consecutive intentional walks in a game in Japanese High School Baseball Championship at Koshien Stadium in 1992 and became a nationwide topic of conversation.

===With the bases loaded===
With the bases loaded, an intentional base on balls forces in a run. This might be advisable if a team with a lead of two to four runs elects to concede one run of its lead so as not to have to pitch to a batter who might hit a home run to tie the game or take the lead.

The following table shows each batter who has gotten this treatment in the history of Major League Baseball. Cases before 1955 are researched from newspaper reports, which may be subjective.
The Mel Ott case, which is not included in the &quot;Baseball Almanac&quot; list, was not a result of in-game strategy. On October 5, 1929, in the first game of a Giants-Phillies doubleheader, Chuck Klein took the lead for the season home run title (box score). The Phillies&#x27; manager told the pitcher to pitch around Ott so he wouldn&#x27;t challenge Klein for the title. In the top of the ninth inning of the second game, the bases were full and the Giants were already well ahead of the Phillies. &quot;The sign came from the bench to walk Ott.&quot; When the count got to 3–0, Ott swung at two wide ones but then accepted ball four and a run was forced in.

A disputed anecdote says that, in 1926, the Cleveland Indians elected to walk Babe Ruth with the bases loaded. This angered Ruth; he swung anyway, and the result of the time at bat was a strikeout. This may refer to the game on July 10, in which Cleveland pitcher Joe Shaute purposely walked Ruth three times. Ruth was also called out once for stepping out of the batter&#x27;s box. Contemporary newspaper accounts give no indication that Ruth was walked with the bases full in that game.

==Slang==
The intentional base on balls is often referred to as a &quot;four-fingered salute.&quot; This reference stems from the manager&#x27;s holding up four fingers to signal an intentional walk to the pitcher or catcher. It is a &quot;salute&quot; to the batter that the manager admits to wanting to pitch to someone else instead.

<doc id="578989" wikidata="Q1475612" url="?curid=578989" title="Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft">
<text>Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA) is the name given to a British project to procure a fleet of Airbus A330 MRTT (Multi-Role Tanker Transport) aerial refuelling (AR) and air transport (AT) aircraft for the Royal Air Force (RAF), to replace their then existing older models such as the Vickers VC10s and Lockheed TriStars.

After evaluation of bids, the Royal Air Force selected the AirTanker consortium, owned by Cobham plc, EADS, Rolls-Royce plc, Thales UK and VT Group plc, in 2004 offering the Airbus A330 MRTT.

==Background==

The project was to provide a replacement of the Royal Air Force&#x27;s fleet of Vickers VC10s from 2008 and the Lockheed TriStars around 2012. The need for a new fleet of air-to-air refuelling aircraft was first identified in 1997. The chosen aircraft were to operate from the same RAF air transport hub, RAF Brize Norton, Oxfordshire as the replaced aircraft.

The use of a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) rather than outright purchase by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) was chosen in 2000. Under the PFI, the Royal Air Force (via the MoD) will pay for aerial refuelling and air transport missions as required. The Royal Air Force will continue to retain responsibility for all military missions, whilst the contractor will own, manage and maintain the aircraft, and also provide training facilities and some personnel. The private company will also be able to earn extra revenue by using aircraft for commercial operations when not required by the Royal Air Force; the most suitable of which would be leased air-refuelling missions for other European air forces. The RAF however will always have the &#x27;first call&#x27; on aircraft, being able to mobilise the entire fleet in times of crisis.

===Competition===
Final bids for the project were received from the two competing consortia on 30 April 2003.

*Air Tanker Limited offered a mix of new and used Airbus A330-200s, the consortium composed of:
**Rolls-Royce — Trent 700 turbofans
**Cobham — aerial refuelling hose and drogue system
**EADS — Airbus A330-200
**Thales Group — avionics and training.
*Tanker Transport Services Consortium (TTSC) offered converted British Airways Boeing 767s:
**British Airways — aircraft
**Boeing — conversion technology, using the KC-767 as the basis of the design
**BAE Systems — conversion of majority of aircraft and mission systems
**Marshall Aerospace
**Serco
**Spectrum Capital

===Selection and contract negotiations===
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) announced on 26 January 2004 that Air Tanker had been selected to enter into final negotiations to provide the RAF&#x27;s Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA).

Following aircraft selection, the MoD began exclusive negotiations with the AirTanker consortium. However, beginning in April 2004, there were rumours about the fragile state of the contract negotiations. With continuing doubts over the FSTA programme, Marshall Aerospace, responsible for the conversion of the RAF&#x27;s original TriStars, offered to buy and convert some of the large number of surplus commercial TriStars.

On 28 February 2005, the MoD named AirTanker as its preferred bidder for the £13 billion contract.

==Development==
The Ministry of Defence announced on 6 June 2007 that AirTanker had been given the approval it needed to continue with the project, allowing the company to seek the £2 billion private financing required to begin funding the aircraft. On 27 March 2008, a PFI deal was agreed with AirTanker, worth £10.5 billion over the course of the contract, and will involve fourteen converted A330-200 aircraft, being delivered from 2011, and being operated until at least 2035. The contract will be paid for at £390 million per annum. Of this, running costs are £80 million, and the remainder covers the consortium&#x27;s financing and profit and the capital cost of the project, including aircraft and infrastructure.

All aircraft will be equipped with a pair of wing-mounted aerial-refuelling pods, while only seven FSTAs will be fitted for centreline flight refuelling units (FRUs); each conversion will take about nine months. The AirTanker facility is based at RAF Brize Norton, where a two-bay hangar and support building will provide a maintenance facility, flight operations centre and office headquarters for the programme. Lufthansa Technik will provide support, repair, and overhaul services.

The first two development aircraft went through a comprehensive military conversion process and initial flight testing programme at Airbus Military&#x27;s facility near Madrid. It was intended that the remaining twelve aircraft destined for the FSTA fleet would be converted by Cobham Aviation Services at their facility in Bournemouth, but in June 2012, it was announced that the final ten aircraft would be converted in Spain to ensure that they were delivered on time and to cost. The first aircraft to be converted in the UK arrived at Bournemouth Airport on 26 August 2011. Cobham held a ceremony to formally open the newly refurbished A330 conversion facility in Bournemouth on 2 September 2011. In a naming ceremony at RAF Fairford during the 2011 Royal International Air Tattoo, it was announced that the aircraft will be known as &#x27;Voyager&#x27; in RAF service.

In November 2010, it was suggested that the French Air Force might buy spare FSTA capacity.

The first completed aircraft arrived at RAF Brize Norton in December 2011; after a prolonged certification process, it began training flights in April 2012. Following technical issues with the new Cobham-designed High Speed-Variable Drag Drogue when refuelling the Panavia Tornado, the drogues on the wing tip pods were replaced in early 2012 with standard Sargent Fletcher drogues, delaying the Release To Service clearance required to conduct air-to-air refuelling (AAR) operations. Certification was finally granted on 16 May 2013, and the first operational tanker flight launched on 20 May 2013.

The Voyager started test flights refuelling the F-35B in 2015, with certification expected by mid-June 2015. This followed the Australian KC-30 variant completing refuelling trials with the F-35A in late 2015.

==Non-core fleet==

By May 2014, nine aircraft had been delivered, completing the &#x27;core&#x27; fleet of Royal Air Force aircraft. The remaining five aircraft represent a &#x27;surge&#x27; capability, available to the RAF when needed, but otherwise available to AirTanker for tasks such as &#x27;release to the civil market, less its military equipment or to partner nations in a military capacity with the MoD&#x27;s agreement&#x27;. In June 2014, Thomas Cook Airlines entered into an agreement to lease one of the five surge aircraft from AirTanker. The aircraft will differ from the Voyager fleet by having 32 more seats, different seats with in flight video, and they will receive Thomas Cook livery.

==Financial reviews==
In March 2010, the National Audit Office (NAO) published a review of the scheme, which was unable to conclude that the Ministry of Defence achieved value for money. Despite managing the later stages of the procurement well, the MOD&#x27;s ability to get the best deal it could was undermined by shortcomings in the way it conducted the procurement and assessed alternative options. Although the project to provide air-to-air refuelling and military transport aircraft has achieved its delivery milestones since contract signature, it is still likely to be delivered five and a half years later than planned. 
However, all the follow-on milestones have been achieved on or ahead schedule, and in particular the delivery of each of the fourteen aircraft. The FSTA programme has been the first UK aircraft programme delivering on schedule and on budget since World War 2.

The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) found that the aircraft specification did not feature the adequate protection required for flights into Afghanistan, and would therefore mean the Lockheed TriStar would continue to fulfil this role until 2016. This had been caused by the FSTA scheme beginning prior to the commencement of military operations in Afghanistan, and a significant delay in any decision being made on including the required protection systems within the contract. However, the FSTA aircraft were quickly modified to fulfil the adequate protection, and Voyagers started operations into Afghanistan in December 2013.

The Lockheed TriStar retired from RAF service in March 2014 and the VC10 in September 2013.

<text>Massasoit Sachem ( ) or Ousamequin (1661) was the sachem or leader of the Wampanoag confederacy. &quot;Massasoit&quot; means &quot;Great Sachem&quot;. Although Massasoit was only his title, English colonists mistook it as his name and it stuck.

Massasoit&#x27;s people had been seriously weakened by a series of epidemics and were vulnerable to attacks by the Narragansetts, and he formed an alliance with the colonists at Plymouth Colony for defense against them. It was through his assistance that the Plymouth Colony avoided starvation during the early years.

==English at Plymouth==
At the time of the pilgrims&#x27; arrival in Plymouth, the realm of the Wampanoag, also known as the Pokanokets, included parts of Rhode Island and much of southeastern Massachusetts. Massasoit lived in Sowams, a village at Pokanoket in Warren, Rhode Island. He held the allegiance of lesser Pokanoket sachems. In 1621, he sent Squanto to live among the colonists at Plymouth.

Outbreaks of an unidentified disease had devastated the Pokanokets, and Massasoit sought an alliance with the colonies of New England against the neighboring Narragansetts who controlled an area west of Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island. Samoset was a minor Abenaki sachem (&quot;sagamore&quot;) who hailed from the Muscongus Bay area of Maine, and he learned to speak English from fishermen who plied those waters. Massasoit sent him to approach the colonists to find out whether their intentions were peaceful.

Massasoit forged critical political and personal ties with colonial leaders William Bradford, Edward Winslow, Stephen Hopkins, John Carver, and Myles Standish, ties which grew out of a peace treaty negotiated on March 22, 1621. The alliance ensured that the Pokanokets remained neutral during the Pequot War in 1636. According to English sources, Massasoit prevented the failure of Plymouth Colony and the starvation that the Pilgrims faced during its earliest years.

==Lasting alliance==

Some tension continued between Massasoit and the colonists when they refused to give up Squanto, whom Massasoit believed to have betrayed him. This was resolved in March 1623 when Massasoit was gravely ill and Edward Winslow nursed him back to health. After his recovery, Winslow reports that Massasoit said, &quot;the English are my friends and love me... whilst I live I will never forget this kindness they have showed me.&quot; In return for their kindness, Massasoit warned them of a plot against them. He had learned that a group of influential Massachusett warriors intended to destroy both the Wessagusset and Plymouth colonies, and he warned the Pilgrims in time.

The alliance came under other tension in later years, as the colonists expanded into new lands in order to support their growing colony. Massasoit sold a tract of land 14 miles square to Myles Standish and others of Duxbury in 1649 to alleviate tension and maintain the peace. The sale took place atop Sachem Rock, an outcropping on the Satucket River in East Bridgewater, Massachusetts. The site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Children==
Massasoit had five children: son Wamsutta, who was born between 1621 and 1625; son Pometecomet, Metacomet, or Metacom; son Sonkanuchoo; and daughters Amie and Sarah. Soon after his death, Wamsutta and Metacomet went to Plymouth and asked the Pilgrims to give them English names. The court named them Alexander and Philip. Wamsutta, the eldest, became sachem of the Pokanokets on the death of his father. He died within a year, and his brother Metacom succeeded him in 1662. Amie married Tispaquin and was the only one of Massasoit&#x27;s five children to survive King Philip&#x27;s War in 1676.

==Legacy==

Roger Williams fled the Massachusetts Bay Colony to avoid arrest and deportation for religious reasons and stayed the winter of 1635–36 with Massasoit, who gave him land along the Seekonk River the following spring. Governor Winslow advised Williams to move his settlement to the other side of the river because his current location was within the bounds of Plymouth Colony. Williams did so and founded Providence Plantations, which later became part of the Colony of Rhode Island.

The half century of peace that Massasoit so assiduously maintained collapsed soon after his death. Wamsutta broke away from his father&#x27;s diplomacy and began an alliance with Connecticut Colony.

Massasoit was humane and honest, kept his word, and endeavored to imbue his people with a love for peace. He kept the Pilgrims advised of any warlike designs toward them by other tribes. It is unclear when Massasoit died. Some accounts claim that it was as early as 1660; others contend that he died as late as 1662. He was anywhere from 80 to 90 at the time.

Wamsutta died suddenly within a year of his succession, and Massasoit&#x27;s second son Metacom became sachem of the Pokanokets and chief sachem of the Greater Wampanoag Confederacy. He believed that Wamsutta had been murdered at the hands of the Colonists, and this was one of the factors that led to King Philip&#x27;s War, one of the bloodiest wars in Colonial American history.

A statue of Massasoit by sculptor Cyrus E. Dallin stands near Plymouth Rock, with others outside the Utah State Capitol building, on the campus of Brigham Young University, at the Springville Museum of Art in Springville, Utah, and in Kansas City, Missouri at the corner of Main Street and Emanuel Cleaver II Blvd. In Massachusetts, both Massasoit Community College and Massasoit State Park are named for him.

<text>General elections were held in India in four phases between 20 April and 10 May 2004. Over 670 million people were eligible to vote, electing 543 members of the 14th Lok Sabha. Seven states also held assembly elections to elect state governments. They were the first elections fully carried out with electronic voting machines.

On 13 May the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the lead party of the National Democratic Alliance conceded defeat. The Indian National Congress, which had governed India for all but five years from independence until 1996, returned to power after a record eight years out of office. It was able to put together a comfortable majority of more than 335 members out of 543 with the help of its allies. The 335 members included both the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance, the governing coalition formed after the election, external support from the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Samajwadi Party (SP), Kerala Congress (KC) and the Left Front.

After facing criticism from her own party and from the country, Congress President Sonia Gandhi asked the 22nd Finance Minister Manmohan Singh, an economist, to head the new government. Singh had previously served in the Congress government of Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao in the early 1990s, when he was seen as one of the architects of India&#x27;s first economic liberalisation plan, which staved off an impending monetary crisis. Despite the fact that Singh had never won a Lok Sabha seat, his considerable goodwill and Sonia Gandhi&#x27;s nomination won him the support of the UPA allies and the Left Front. Manmohan Singh became the first Sikh and non-Hindu prime minister of India.

==Background==
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had recommended premature dissolution of the 13th Lok Sabha (in accordance with a provision of the Constitution) to pave the way for early elections apparently in view of the recent good showing of the BJP in the Assembly elections in four states.

==Organisation==

The election dates for the parliamentary elections were:

*20 April – 141 constituencies
*26 April – 137 constituencies
*5 May – 83 constituencies
*10 May – 182 constituencies

Counting began simultaneously on 13 May. Over 370 million of the 675 million eligible citizens voted, with election violence claiming 48 lives, less than half the number killed during the 1999 election. The Indian elections were held in phases in order to maintain law and order. A few states considered sensitive areas required deployment of the armed forces. The average enrolment of voters in each constituency was 1.2 million, although the largest constituency had 3.1 million.

The Election Commission of India is responsible for deciding the dates and conducting elections according to constitutional provisions. The Election Commission employed more than a million electronic voting machines for these elections.

According to &quot;India Today&quot;, 115.62 billion rupees were expected to have been spent in campaigning for the elections by all political parties combined. Most of the money was spent on the people involved in the election. The Election Commission limited poll expenses to Rs. 2.5 million per constituency. Thus, the actual spending is expected to have been approximately ten times the limit. About 6.5 billion rupees are estimated to have been spent on mobilising 150,000 vehicles. About a billion rupees are estimated to have been spent on helicopters and aircraft.

==Pre-poll alliances==
In these elections, compared to all the Lok Sabha elections of the 1990s, the battle was more of a head-to-head contest in the sense that there was no viable third front alternative. Largely the contest was between BJP and its allies on one hand and Congress and its allies on the other. The situation did, however, show large regional differences.

The BJP fought the elections as part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), although some of its seat-sharing agreements were made with strong regional parties outside of the NDA such as Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in Andhra Pradesh and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) in Tamil Nadu.

Ahead of the elections there were attempts to form a Congress-led national level joint opposition front. In the end, an agreement could not be reached, but on regional level alliances between Congress and regional parties were made in several states. This was the first time that Congress contested with that type of alliances in a parliamentary election.

The left parties, most notably the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Communist Party of India, contested on their own in their strongholds West Bengal, Tripura and Kerala, confronting both Congress and NDA forces. In several other states, such as Punjab and Andhra Pradesh, they took part in seat sharings with Congress. In Tamil Nadu they were part of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)-led Democratic Progressive Alliance.

Two parties refused to go along with either Congress or BJP, Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi Party. Both are based in Uttar Pradesh, the largest state of India (in terms of population). Congress made several attempts to form alliances with them, but in vain. Many believed that they would become the &#x27;spoilers&#x27; that would rob Congress of an electoral victory. The result was a four-cornered contest in UP, which didn&#x27;t really hurt or benefit Congress or BJP significantly.

==Forecast and campaigns==
Most analysts believed the NDA would win the elections. This assessment was also supported by opinion polls. The economy had shown steady growth in the last few months and the disinvestment of government owned production units (a continuation of India&#x27;s liberalisation policies initiated in the early 1990s) had been on track. The Foreign Exchange Reserves of India stood at more than US$100 billion (7th largest in the world and a record for India). The service sector had also generated a lot of jobs. The party was supposed to have been riding on a wave of the so-called &quot;feel good factor&quot;, typified by its promotional campaign &quot;India Shining&quot;.

In the past, BJP has largely been seen as a hardline Hindu right wing party with close ties with the hardline organisations the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Vishva Hindu Parishad. Over the years, the party under Vajpayee has slightly distanced itself from hardline policies in order to accommodate a variety of parties within the NDA, like Trinamool Congress (a Congress-breakaway party), breakaway factions of the Janata Dal like INLD, RLD, JD(U) and BJD, Dravidianist parties like DMK (which left the alliance in December 2003), PMK (which left the alliance in January 2004) and AIADMK (which joined after DMK left) and parties largely representing non-Hindus like SAD and JKNC (which joined the alliance in 2002), a change that was being questioned after the party&#x27;s poor showing in the assembly elections. These elections were marked by the campaign&#x27;s emphasis on economic gains instead of communal issues involving religious polarisation like ban on cow-slaughter, implementation of a Uniform Civil Code, construction of Ram-mandir at the disputed site of Ayodhya, abolition of the provisions of secularism in order to make Hinduism the country&#x27;s state religion etc that characterised BJP&#x27;s campaign in the 1996 election. From the last few elections, BJP had realised that its voter base had reached a ceiling and had concentrated on pre-poll rather than post-poll alliances. The foreign origin of Sonia Gandhi also constituted part of the NDA&#x27;s campaign.

==Analysis==

Though pre-poll predictions were for an overwhelming majority for the BJP, the exit polls (immediately after the elections and before the counting began) predicted a hung parliament. However, even the exit polls could only indicate the general trend and nowhere close to the final figures. There is also the general perception that as soon as the BJP started realising that events might not proceed entirely in its favour, it changed the focus of its campaign from &quot;India Shining&quot; to issues of stability. The Congress, who was regarded as &quot;old-fashioned&quot; by the ruling BJP, was largely backed by poor, rural, lower-caste and minority voters that did not participate in the economic boom of previous years that created a wealthy middle class and thus achieved its overwhelming victory on grounds of wealth inequality. 

==Impact==
The rout of the ruling parties in the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala in the general elections led to calls for the dissolution of the governments of these states.

The stock market (Bombay Stock Exchange) fell in the week prior to the announcement of the results due to fears of an unstable coalition. As soon as counting began, however, it became clear that the Congress coalition was headed for a sizeable lead over the NDA and the market surged, only to crash the following day when the left parties, whose support would be required for government formation, announced that it was their intention to do away with the disinvestment ministry. Following this, Manmohan Singh, the Prime Minister (in office 2004–14) and the prime architect of the economic liberalisation of the early 1990s, hurried to reassure investors that the new government would strive to create a business-friendly climate.

==Events==
*13 May - The Congress and allies win a plurality of seats in the Lok Sabha (219 seats against 188 for the BJP).
*13 May - Counting of votes in the parliamentary elections begins.
*11 May - Congress wins the Assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh by 2/3 majority.
*10 May - The fourth and final phase of elections comes to an end. Results will come out for 542 of the 543 parliament seats with elections to be held again in Chhapra.
*5 May - Third phase of polling comes to an end with the ruling coalition government gaining seats according to exit polls but still off the victory target. Reports of booth capturing in Chhapra capture headlines.
*26 April - Second phase of elections sees 55-60% polling. This is the final phase for assembly elections. Polling covers 136 parliamentary constituencies in 11 states. The share market starts to crash as it becomes evident that the NDA government may find it hard to come back to power—raising doubts about the continuation of economic reforms initiated by the NDA government.
*22 April - Tripura, where polling was delayed because of a local holiday, votes for its two MPs. A turnout of close to 60% is reported, despite calls for abstention made by separatist militants.
*20 April - The first phase of the vote is held, with average turnouts of between 50% and 55%. Voting is reported as brisk, and the day unfolds relatively smoothly, albeit with some glitches reported with the electronic voting machines. Isolated violent incidents take place in Kashmir, Jammu, Manipur, and Jharkhand.
*8 April - The NDA&#x27;s top leaders meet in New Delhi to adopt its manifesto for the elections, &quot;Agenda for Development and Good Governance&quot;.
*7 April - Ram Jethmalani says he will contest the elections against Prime Minister Vajpayee as an independent candidate from Lucknow. He claims he will be supported by the Congress and some other parties.
*6 April - The BJP and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) tell the Election Commission that they will not stop raising the issue of the foreign origin of Congress president Sonia Gandhi.
*4 April - A First Information Report is lodged against external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha for alleged violation of election code of conduct during a poll meeting in Ranchi. Besides Sinha, FIRs were lodged against three other BJP leaders who participated in the meeting.

<text>The agouti (, ) or common agouti is many of several rodent species of the genus Dasyprocta. They are native to Central America, northern and central South America, and the southern Lesser Antilles. Some species have also been introduced elsewhere in the West Indies. They are related to guinea pigs and look quite similar, but they are larger and have longer legs. The species vary considerably in colour, being brown, reddish, dull orange, greyish, or blackish, but typically with lighter underparts. Their bodies are covered with coarse hair, which is raised when alarmed. They weigh and are in length, with short, hairless tails.

The related pacas were formerly included in genus &quot;Agouti&quot;, but these animals were reclassified in 1998 as genus &quot;Cuniculus&quot;.

The Spanish term is &quot;agutí.&quot; In Mexico, the agouti is called the &#x27;. In [[Panama]], it is known as the&#x27; and in eastern Ecuador, as the &quot;&quot;.
==Etymology==
The name &quot;agouti&quot; is derived from either Guarani or Tupi, both South American indigenous languages, in which the name is written variously as &quot;agutí&quot;, &quot;agoutí&quot;, &quot;acutí&quot;, &quot;akuti&quot; and &quot;akuri&quot;. The Portuguese term for these animals, &quot;cutia&quot;, is derived from this original naming.

==Description==

Agoutis have five toes on their front feet and three toes on their hind feet; the first toe is very small. The tail is very short or nonexistent and hairless. The molar teeth have cylindrical crowns, with several islands and a single lateral fold of enamel. Agoutis may grow to be up to in length and in weight. Most species are brown on their backs and whitish or buff on their bellies; the fur may have a glossy appearance and then glimmers in an orange colour. Reports differ as to whether they are diurnal or nocturnal animals.

===Behaviour and habits===
In the wild, they are shy animals and flee from humans, while in captivity they may become trusting. In Trinidad, they are renowned for being very fast runners, able to keep hunting dogs occupied with chasing them for hours.

Agoutis are found in forested and wooded areas in Central and South America. Their habitats include rainforests, savannas, and cultivated fields. They conceal themselves at night in hollow tree trunks or in burrows among roots. Active and graceful in their movements, their pace is either a kind of trot or a series of springs following one another so rapidly as to look like a gallop. They take readily to water, in which they swim well.

When feeding, agoutis sit on their hind legs and hold food between their forepaws. They may gather in groups of up to 100 to feed. They eat fallen fruit, leaves and roots, although they may sometimes climb trees to eat green fruit. They hoard food in small, buried stores. They sometimes eat the eggs of ground-nesting birds and even shellfish on the seashore. They may cause damage to sugarcane and banana plantations. They are regarded as one of the few species (along with macaws) that can open Brazil nuts without tools, mainly thanks to their strength and exceptionally sharp teeth. In southern Brazil, their main source of energy is the nut of &quot;Araucaria angustifolia&quot;.

==Breeding==
Agoutis give birth to litters of two to four young (pups) after a gestation period of three months. Some species have two litters a year in May and October, while others breed year round. The pups are born in burrows lined with leaves, roots and hair. They are well developed at birth and may be up and eating within an hour. Fathers are barred from the nest while the young are very small, but the parents pair bond for the rest of their lives. They can live for as long as 20 years, a remarkably long time for a rodent.

<text>Aaron Joseph Neville (born January 24, 1941) is an American R&amp;B and soul singer. With Art, Charles, and Cyril, he is a member of the Neville Brothers. On his own, he has had four platinum albums and four Top 10 hits in the United States, including three that reached number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Adult Contemporary chart.

==Career==
The first of Neville&#x27;s singles that was given airplay outside of New Orleans was &quot;Over You&quot;, released in 1960. His first hit single was &quot;Tell It Like It Is&quot;, released by local musician/arranger George Davis, a friend from school, and band-leader Lee Diamond. The song topped &quot;Billboard&quot;″s R&amp;B chart for five weeks in 1967 and also reached on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (behind &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot; by the Monkees). It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.

Neville released his first solo album since the late 1960s in 1986 with the independent release &quot;Orchid in The Storm&quot;. In 1989, Neville teamed up with Linda Ronstadt on the album &quot;Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind&quot; which included four duets by the pair. Amongst them were the No. 1 Grammy-winning hits &quot;Don&#x27;t Know Much&quot; and &quot;All My Life&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t Know Much&quot; reached No. 2 on the Hot 100, and was certified Gold for selling a million copies, while the album was certified Triple Platinum for US sales of more than three million.

Following the success of &quot;Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind&quot;, Ronstadt produced his 1991 album &quot;Warm Your Heart&quot; including the hit single &quot;Everybody Plays the Fool&quot;, a cover of the 1972 Main Ingredient song, which reached No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and another duet with Ronstadt &quot;Close Your Eyes&quot;. &quot;Warm Your Heart&quot; was certified platinum in 1997 for more than a million sales in the U.S.

During 1993 and 1994, Neville expanded his repertoire as a recording artist and ventured into making country music. In 1993, Neville released the platinum-selling &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; on A&amp;M Records with lead single &quot;Don&#x27;t Take Away My Heaven&quot; reaching No. 4 on the Adult Contemporary chart (where previous hits &quot;Don&#x27;t Know Much&quot;, &quot;All My Life&quot;, and &quot;Everybody Plays the Fool&quot; all reached number one). The follow-up single &quot;The Grand Tour&quot;, a cover of country music legend George Jones&#x27; 1974 hit, peaked at No. 38 on the Billboard country singles chart, and was highly acclaimed by fans and critics, resulting in a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance at the 36th Annual Grammy Awards in 1994. He followed the album up with another platinum seller &quot;Aaron Neville&#x27;s Soulful Christmas.&quot;

Neville&#x27;s next country music project involved appearing on 1994&#x27;s &quot;Rhythm, Country and Blues&quot;, an album of duets featuring R&amp;B and Country artists performing renditions of classic country and R&amp;B songs. Neville recorded a version of &quot;I Fall to Pieces&quot;, a major crossover hit for Patsy Cline originally released in 1961, with Trisha Yearwood that resulted in Neville and Yearwood winning the Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals at the 37th Annual Grammy Awards. As a result, Neville became one of the only African American recording artists to win a Grammy within the Country genre.
In April 1994, Neville appeared on Sesame Street to sing the song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Live on the Moon&quot; as a duet with Ernie.

Neville&#x27;s 1995 release, &quot;The Tattooed Heart&quot;, featuring covers of classics by Bill Withers and Kris Kristofferson went gold, while 1997&#x27;s pop-orientated &quot;...To Make Me Who I Am&quot; included songwriting contributions from contemporary hitmakers Babyface and Diane Warren as well as two new duets with Ronstadt, including a cover of &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot;. This was followed by a 2000 gospel album &quot;Devotion&quot; which topped the US gospel album chart, and his 2003 debut for Verve Records entitled &quot;Nature Boy: The Standards Album&quot; which topped the US jazz album chart. The album saw Neville covering selections from the Great American Songbook, including another Ronstadt duet &quot;The Very Thought of You&quot;.

In August 2005, Neville&#x27;s home in Eastern New Orleans was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina; he evacuated to Memphis, before the hurricane hit. He went to Austin to visit his friend Clifford Antone, then moved to Nashville. He performed Randy Newman&#x27;s &quot;Louisiana 1927&quot; on NBC&#x27;s &quot;A Concert for Hurricane Relief&quot; on September 2, 2005, and &quot;A Change is Gonna Come&quot; at the New York benefit concert &quot;From the Big Apple to the Big Easy&quot;. When he didn&#x27;t return to the city by early 2008, the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival temporarily changed its tradition of having the Neville Brothers close the festival. However, the band, including Aaron, returned for the 2008 Jazzfest, which returned to its traditional seven-day format for the first time since Katrina. He then moved back to New Orleans area, to the nearby city of Covington. 

Neville signed to SonyBMG&#x27;s new Burgundy Records label in late 2005 and recorded an album of songs by Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye, Curtis Mayfield, Sam Cooke and others for &quot;Bring It On Home...The Soul Classics&quot;, released on September 19, 2006. The album, produced by Stewart Levine, features collaborations between Neville and Chaka Khan, Mavis Staples, Chris Botti, David Sanborn, Art Neville, and others. The album&#x27;s first single was a remake of The Impressions&#x27; 1963 classic &quot;It&#x27;s All Right&quot;. 

Neville&#x27;s career has included work for television, movies and sporting events. Neville sang the US national anthem in the movie &quot;The Fan&quot; starring Robert De Niro and Wesley Snipes. He also sang the anthem at the WWF&#x27;s SummerSlam 1993 and at WCW&#x27;s Spring Stampede 1994. Neville sang the theme music to the children&#x27;s TV series Fisher-Price &quot;Little People&quot; and the songs for the sixth volume, &quot;Discovering Seasons.&quot; He also sang a new version of &quot;Cotton&quot;, for Cotton Incorporated which was introduced during the 1992 Summer Olympics. In 1988 he recorded &quot;Mickey Mouse March&quot; for &quot;Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films&quot;, one of Various Artists. In 2006, Neville performed a rendition of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, alongside Aretha Franklin and Dr. John on keyboards at Super Bowl XL in Detroit, Michigan. In addition, Neville (along with brothers Art and Cyril) did background vocals for the songs &quot;Great Heart&quot;, &quot;Bring Back the Magic&quot;, &quot;Homemade Music&quot;, &quot;My Barracuda&quot;, and &quot;Smart Woman (in a Real Short Skirt)&quot; on Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s &quot;Hot Water,&quot; released in 1988.

Neville is interviewed on screen and appears in performance footage with the Neville Brothers in the 2005 documentary film &quot;Make It Funky!&quot;, which presents a history of New Orleans music and its influence on rhythm and blues, rock and roll, funk and jazz. The Nevilles perform &quot;Fire on the Bayou&quot; in the film.

On October 27, 2006, Neville made a guest appearance on an episode of the soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. He sang &quot;Stand by Me&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Sunshine&quot;, from his album, &quot;Bring It On Home ... The Soul Classics&quot;. 

In 2008 he released &quot;Gold&quot;, which includes a double album of his hits.
He also released an album of traditional carols called &quot;Christmas &amp; Hits Duos&quot;. The song Christmas Prayer was featured on the &quot;ER&quot; episode &quot;The High Holiday&quot;.

In 2009, Neville, along with the Mt. Zion Mass Choir, released a version of the song &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come&quot; on the compilation album &quot;Oh Happy Day&quot;.

In 2010, Neville and his brother Art performed with The Meters.

Neville was the featured artist for the 100th Anniversary Celebration of the University of Memphis Centennial Concert September 30, 2011, at the Cannon Center for the Performing Arts. That year, Neville toured New Zealand with The Blind Boys of Alabama and Mavis Staples.

In January 2013, paying tribute to the songs of his youth, Blue Note Records released Neville&#x27;s &quot;My True Story,&quot; a collection of 12 doo-wop tunes, produced by Don Was and Keith Richards, with backing by musicians such as Benmont Tench and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.

In March 2015, he was named the year&#x27;s recipient of the Laetare Medal.

In October 2015, Keith Richards selected the song &quot;My True Story&quot; as one of his Desert Island Discs.

In May 2021, the 80-year old Neville announced his retirement from touring, but said he may still record albums or perform occasionally for special events or festivals.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Neville at number 104 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

==Personal life==
Neville is from New Orleans, Louisiana. He has mixed African-American, white, and Choctaw heritage. His uncle, George &quot;Big Chief Jolly&quot; Landry, was lead singer of the Mardi Gras Indian group the Wild Tchoupitoulas.

Neville got his facial tattoo (of a sword) when he was 16 years old. Speaking to &quot;Billboard&quot; in 2019, he recalled that &quot;My dad made me scrub it with Brillo Pads and Octagon Soap. The skin came off, but the tattoo stayed. But some years later, I had an album out called &quot;The Tattooed Heart&quot; [in 1995], and we were doing a special thing in a tattoo parlor, so I let them go over it and outline it – freshen it up.&quot;

Neville married Joel (pronounced Jo-EL) Roux Neville (1941–2007) on January 10, 1959. Together they had four children Ernestine, Aaron &quot;Fred&quot; Jr., and musicians Ivan and Jason. Neville is also the uncle of journalist Arthel Neville.

In 2008, during a &quot;People&quot; magazine photo shoot, Neville met photographer Sarah Ann Friedman. They were married in New York on November 13, 2010.

Neville is Catholic, with a devotion to St. Jude, to whom he has credited his success and survival. He wears a St. Jude Medal as a left earring.

<doc id="579026" wikidata="Q1544012" url="?curid=579026" title="Gravitational potential">
<text>In classical mechanics, the gravitational potential is a scalar potential associating with each point in space the work (energy transferred) per unit mass that would be needed to move an object to that point from a fixed reference point in the conservative gravitational field. It is analogous to the electric potential with mass playing the role of charge. The reference point, where the potential is zero, is by convention infinitely far away from any mass, resulting in a negative potential at any distance. Their similarity is correlated with both associated fields having conservative forces.

Mathematically, the gravitational potential is also known as the Newtonian potential and is fundamental in the study of potential theory. It may also be used for solving the electrostatic and magnetostatic fields generated by uniformly charged or polarized ellipsoidal bodies.

==Potential energy==

The gravitational potential (&quot;V&quot;) at a location is the gravitational potential energy (&quot;U&quot;) at that location per unit mass:

formula_1

where &quot;m&quot; is the mass of the object. Potential energy is equal (in magnitude, but negative) to the work done by the gravitational field moving a body to its given position in space from infinity. If the body has a mass of 1 kilogram, then the potential energy to be assigned to that body is equal to the gravitational potential. So the potential can be interpreted as the negative of the work done by the gravitational field moving a unit mass in from infinity.

In some situations, the equations can be simplified by assuming a field that is nearly independent of position. For instance, in a region close to the surface of the Earth, the gravitational acceleration, &quot;g&quot;, can be considered constant. In that case, the difference in potential energy from one height to another is, to a good approximation, linearly related to the difference in height:
formula_2

==Mathematical form==
The gravitational potential &quot;V&quot; at a distance &quot;x&quot; from a point mass of mass &quot;M&quot; can be defined as the work &quot;W&quot; that needs to be done by an external agent to bring a unit mass in from infinity to that point:

formula_3
where &quot;G&quot; is the gravitational constant, and F is the gravitational force. The product &quot;GM&quot; is the standard gravitational parameter and is often known to higher precision than &quot;G&quot; or &quot;M&quot; separately. The potential has units of energy per mass, e.g., J/kg in the MKS system. By convention, it is always negative where it is defined, and as &quot;x&quot; tends to infinity, it approaches zero.

The gravitational field, and thus the acceleration of a small body in the space around the massive object, is the negative gradient of the gravitational potential. Thus the negative of a negative gradient yields positive acceleration toward a massive object. Because the potential has no angular components, its gradient is
formula_4
where x is a vector of length &quot;x&quot; pointing from the point mass toward the small body and formula_5 is a unit vector pointing from the point mass toward the small body. The magnitude of the acceleration therefore follows an inverse square law:
formula_6

The potential associated with a mass distribution is the superposition of the potentials of point masses. If the mass distribution is a finite collection of point masses, and if the point masses are located at the points x1, ..., x&quot;n&quot; and have masses &quot;m&quot;1, ..., &quot;m&quot;&quot;n&quot;, then the potential of the distribution at the point x is
formula_7

If the mass distribution is given as a mass measure &quot;dm&quot; on three-dimensional Euclidean space R3, then the potential is the convolution of with &quot;dm&quot;. In good cases this equals the integral
formula_8
where is the distance between the points x and r. If there is a function &quot;ρ&quot;(r) representing the density of the distribution at r, so that , where &quot;dv&quot;(r) is the Euclidean volume element, then the gravitational potential is the volume integral
formula_9

If &quot;V&quot; is a potential function coming from a continuous mass distribution &quot;ρ&quot;(r), then &quot;ρ&quot; can be recovered using the Laplace operator, :
formula_10
This holds pointwise whenever &quot;ρ&quot; is continuous and is zero outside of a bounded set. In general, the mass measure &quot;dm&quot; can be recovered in the same way if the Laplace operator is taken in the sense of distributions. As a consequence, the gravitational potential satisfies Poisson&#x27;s equation. See also Green&#x27;s function for the three-variable Laplace equation and Newtonian potential.

The integral may be expressed in terms of known transcendental functions for all ellipsoidal shapes, including the symmetrical and degenerate ones. These include the sphere, where the three semi axes are equal; the oblate (see reference ellipsoid) and prolate spheroids, where two semi axes are equal; the degenerate ones where one semi axes is infinite (the elliptical and circular cylinder) and the unbounded sheet where two semi axes are infinite. All these shapes are widely used in the applications of the gravitational potential integral (apart from the constant &quot;G&quot;, with 𝜌 being a constant charge density) to electromagnetism.

==Spherical symmetry==
A spherically symmetric mass distribution behaves to an observer completely outside the distribution as though all of the mass was concentrated at the center, and thus effectively as a point mass, by the shell theorem. On the surface of the earth, the acceleration is given by so-called standard gravity &quot;g&quot;, approximately 9.8 m/s2, although this value varies slightly with latitude and altitude. The magnitude of the acceleration is a little larger at the poles than at the equator because Earth is an oblate spheroid.

Within a spherically symmetric mass distribution, it is possible to solve Poisson&#x27;s equation in spherical coordinates. Within a uniform spherical body of radius &quot;R&quot;, density ρ, and mass &quot;m&quot;, the gravitational force &quot;g&quot; inside the sphere varies linearly with distance &quot;r&quot; from the center, giving the gravitational potential inside the sphere, which is
formula_11
which differentiably connects to the potential function for the outside of the sphere (see the figure at the top).

==General relativity==
In general relativity, the gravitational potential is replaced by the metric tensor. When the gravitational field is weak and the sources are moving very slowly compared to light-speed, general relativity reduces to Newtonian gravity, and the metric tensor can be expanded in terms of the gravitational potential.

==Multipole expansion==

The potential at a point is given by
formula_12
The potential can be expanded in a series of Legendre polynomials. Represent the points x and r as position vectors relative to the center of mass. The denominator in the integral is expressed as the square root of the square to give
&lt;math display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;\begin{align}
V(\mathbf{x}) &amp;= - \int_{\R^3} \frac{G}{ \sqrt

Compare the gravity at these locations.

<doc id="579030" wikidata="Q2318266" url="?curid=579030" title="Dear Brother">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Riyoko Ikeda. It was adapted into an anime series that aired on the channel NHK-BS2 from July 14, 1991, to May 31, 1992.

The series originally started out as a manga in the early to mid-1970s. The story is about a 16-year-old girl, , who attends a prestigious academy and deals with life as a high school student via writing letters to her &quot;brother&quot;. The manga has been translated into French, Italian and Polish. The series spans 39 anime episodes and three manga volumes, ending when Nanako is eighteen.

==Plot==
Nanako Misonoo is a young high school freshman at the exclusive girls&#x27; school Seiran Academy. When she begins her first year at this school, she falls into a world of female rivalry, love, chaos, and heartbreak. She narrates the story of the series in a chain of letters to a young man named Takehiko Henmi, who she calls &quot;Oniisama&quot; (Brother). In reality, Takehiko was her teacher at the cram school she went to earlier. She feels such a strong bond with Takehiko that she asks to continue corresponding with him. Takehiko agrees, and soon Nanako begins addressing him as &quot;brother&quot; in her letters. When Nanako starts her new school year at the all-girl Seiran Academy, she is unexpectedly inducted into the school&#x27;s Sorority despite having none of the looks, talents, or background needed to become a member. As the series progresses, she becomes involved in the lives of the &quot;Magnificent Three&quot;, the three most popular girls in the school.
As Nanako interacts with these women, she becomes attached to the great but troubled Rei Asaka, whom she wants to help, but cannot get close to due to Rei&#x27;s obsession with Fukiko Ichinomiya, the Sorority president. Nanako also becomes friends with a beautiful and lonely young girl named Mariko Shinobu, who is determined to get into the Sorority and make Nanako her best friend at all costs. Meanwhile, Nanako has problems of her own; she is constantly being bullied by her peers due to her unlikely membership in the Sorority, especially by one Aya Misaki who feels that she should have been the one chosen for it. Throughout these problems Nanako is supported by her childhood friend Tomoko, the athletic but secretly ailing Kaoru Orihara, the passionate and troubled Mariko Shinobu and the correspondence with her &quot;brother&quot;, who just happens to have some secrets of his own. The series chronicles her first year at Seiran Academy as she uncovers the past of some of the most popular girls in school, learning of love, loss, and her own family&#x27;s secrets, including her true relationship with Takehiko.

==Characters==
:
:The main character of the story, Nanako Misonoo is suddenly and unexpectedly chosen to join &quot;The Sorority&quot;, an elite group at her new high school, eliciting the wrath and jealousy of her classmates. Like many shōjo heroines, Nanako is innocent, caring, sometimes insecure, but always determined to do what is right. She begins the story hoping only to be liked by her peers, but is soon dragged into the lives and secrets of Seiran Academy&#x27;s most elite students. She falls in love with Rei &quot;Saint-Juste&quot; Asaka, and their relationship is one of the major driving plots of the series. 
:
:Tomoko is Nanako&#x27;s childhood friend and arguably the only &quot;normal-themed&quot; character in the series. In the manga, Mariko manipulates her into ending her friendship with Nanako, which Tomoko later rekindles when she realizes the misunderstanding. In the anime, Mariko attempts to end the friendship too and almost succeeds, but Tomoko ultimately remains by Nanako&#x27;s side and protects her from Aya Misaki&#x27;s bullying, and the three of them become best friends for the entire duration of the show, with Tomoko acting as the series&#x27; main comedic relief.
:
:Rei &quot;Saint-Juste of the Flowers&quot; Asaka is a second year student and one of the &quot;Magnificent Three&quot; known for her social indifference and her many artistic talents, especially artistic (she plays the guitar and sings in the manga, and plays the piano, the flute and violin and acts in the anime). She is also shown playing basketball in the anime, replacing Kaoru in at least one game (Episode 16 &quot;Comeback&quot;). Incredibly loyal and devoted to the ones she loves, Rei&#x27;s destructive relationship with Fukiko Ichinomiya leads her to be troubled, obsessed with death, and drug-addicted. She is Kaoru&#x27;s best friend, with them exchanging playful insults at times and loyally helping each other at others, and shows a soft spot for Nanako when they interact, but her relationship with Fukiko prevents her from comfortably maintaining other friendships. The secrets between the two, and Nanako&#x27;s involvement in them, is one of the major driving plots of the series. She dies late in the series; in the manga she dies by suicide via pill overdose, but in the anime her death is an accident as she falls off of a commuter bridge, into the path of a train (Episode 34 &quot;Ablution&quot;). She does this while trying to catch a bouquet of flowers that she purchased for Nanako, which she accidentally drops. In the anime her death deeply influences the other characters, as Kaoru begins to have suicidal feelings and the Ichinomiya family feel guilty for not doing anything for her, despite their wealth and their relationship to her. Ironically, Rei is the only one allowed, and who has ever seen Fukiko cry (Episode 25 &quot;The Scarlet Lipstick&quot;). Rei&#x27;s nickname comes from Louis de Saint-Just, a French Revolutionary, known as the &quot;Angel of Death&quot;. 
:
:Nanako&#x27;s classmate, a fellow Sorority member and a former student of the junior high school attached to Seiran, Mariko becomes one of Nanako&#x27;s best friends. Mariko distrusts all men because of her troubled family life: her father Hikawa is an erotica author who has an affair with an actress and later divorces Mariko&#x27;s mother Hisako, who keeps her sadness bottled up as she raises Mariko practically on her own. As a result she is terrified of abandonment to the point where she becomes obsessed with the ones around her. She is also extremely beautiful, with red lips and long black hair as well as a curvy body, and shows an odd mix of vanity about her good looks and lack of regard for her own health if upset. On one occasion, Mariko becomes extremely possessive towards Nanako when Nanako tries to leave the Shinobu Residence. This later leads to Mariko refusing to eat until Nanako accepts her apology and forgives her. She collapses after three days due to hunger, before returning to eating as normal once the two friends have resolved the situation.. Mariko greatly admires Kaoru due to her strength and the emotional support she gives her as well, and at some point she admits to loving Karou (Episode 16&quot;Comeback&quot;). She also has odd interactions with Fukiko&#x27;s brother Takashi, especially in the anime where she comically insults him (Episode 21). Almost at the end, Mariko injures Aya after Aya makes fun of her family problems in front of the class, leading Mariko to be suspended from school and expelled from the Sorority, which partially triggers the call for the Sorority to be abolished after Nanako declares that Fukiko&#x27;s judgement on Mariko was too harsh, as she did not hear Mariko&#x27;s side of the story. In the anime Mariko eventually comes to terms with her rivalry with Aya, realising they were both lonely and self-centred.
:Near the end of the series, Mariko&#x27;s parents finally divorce. At first Mariko is extremely distraught, and reminisces about how her father was never there for her on her birthday, and Nanako observes how difficult it must be for her to choose a parent to live with as she loves both of them deeply. Furthermore, she feels shame about her father&#x27;s profession deepens her self-loathing. After the incident with Aya and Mariko&#x27;s expulsion from the Sorority, her father tells her that he believes there is good in everyone, including himself and Mariko, so she should love herself. She is able to resolve her feelings of shame towards her father&#x27;s profession when Takashi hands her an old novel by her father, which is a sincere novel about his love towards his mother and his belief to live life in a way that will not be regretted.
:
:&quot;Kaoru-no-Kimi&quot; (&quot;Prince Kaoru&quot;) Orihara is one of the &quot;Magnificent Three&quot;, the class representative of Nanako and her friend&#x27;s class and the star of the basketball team, known for her tomboyish way of dress and her great athletic skills. She has a mysterious and deadly illness (breast cancer) kept secret from most of her classmates; it&#x27;s only known in public that she was held back a year due to unnamed health problems. As Rei&#x27;s best friend, she greatly dislikes Fukiko for everything she has done to Rei and hates the very existence of the Sorority. She spends the series trying to live her life to the fullest in spite of her disease, and is the one who supports Nanako the most when she is bullied, and helps Rei when she gets into major trouble. She was romantically involved with Nanako&#x27;s &quot;brother&quot;, Takehiko Henmi, but broke it off after her mastectomy. However, both Kaoru and Takehiko still have strong feelings for each other near the end of the series. Fukiko, who is also in love with Takehiko, encourages Kaoru to take up their relationship again after Rei&#x27;s death, pointing out that Rei lived her life to the fullest until the last day, so she should too. In both anime and manga Kaoru marries Takehiko and emigrates to Germany with him. In the anime, she recovers from her cancer and gives birth to a child at the end of the series, but in the manga she dies two years after she and Takehiko leave. Kaoru&#x27;s nickname comes from the anti-hero character, Kaoru Genji, of &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;.
:
:One of the &quot;Magnificent Three&quot;, Fukiko &quot;Miya-sama&quot; (&quot;Princess&quot;) Ichinomiya is a senior year student, the Student Council President, leader of the Sorority Club, member of the flower arrangement and horse riding club, and known for her elegance and dignity. She appears to be calm and generous, but is cruel and manipulative, often psychologically and physically torturing Rei for several ambiguous reasons, such as her desire that Rei should only have eyes for her and no one else. It is also revealed that she and Rei are full sisters, daughters of the Ichinomiya leader and a maid of the family mansion, although she was adopted by the Ichinomiya family and Rei was not. The annual Sorority candidate selections always cause extreme fighting and jealousy among the lower-classmen, which she promotes, believing that in competition one finds strength, so Fukiko sponsors Nanako&#x27;s entry into the Sorority due to secret and ulterior motives: she is in love with Takehiko, does not know that Takehiko is really Nanako&#x27;s stepbrother and confidant, and sees Nanako as a potential obstacle. She jealously tries to destroy their relationship by making Nanako love her instead (she believes that Nanako is writing to Hemni with romantic intentions and tries to make her stop writing him letters). In the anime, her love for Takehiko is given a backstory: she met and fell in love with him when she was twelve and he spent several days with her in the Ichinomiya mansion, but he unknowingly broke her heart by not showing up to her birthday party, which she had prepared a violin piece for, which emotionally splintered young Fukiko; Fukiko has since been stuck in that sense of love that she felt when she was twelve. Her room from that period remains the same as it was on the very day that she met Henmi (Episode 22 &quot;A Summer Serenade&quot;). In the end, she is able to overcome her childhood love and move forward, and in the anime she greatly laments Rei&#x27;s death.
:
:The daughter of a famous lawyer, a fervent (her mother was in the sorority so it would shame the family if she were not chosen) Sorority aspirant and Mariko&#x27;s rival ever since junior high, she tries to make life miserable for Nanako and Mariko when she fails to gain entry. In the anime, she is almost always seen with Miyuki Sonobe and Megumi Furuta, the only friends she seems to have at Seiran Academy. Mean-spirited and conniving, her cruelty belies an intense self-loathing. In the anime, after she is wounded in an altercation with Mariko in Episode 27, &quot;An Incident of Bloodshed&quot;, she experiences intense guilt for her actions and ultimately repents. When Megumi and Miyuki are manipulated by older Sorority girls, Aya takes the blame to protect her friends and later attempts to commit suicide by throwing herself into the sea, but is saved by Nanako and her friends. By the series&#x27; end, she and her group appear to be on good terms with the main characters.
:
:Takehiko is a favourite tutor of Nanako, whom she asks to be her &quot;Oniisama&quot;—a trusted older-brother figure. He is a graduate student at Gakuin University along with Fukiko&#x27;s brother Takashi Ichinomiya, and has aspirations to study abroad in Germany. Takehiko is actually Nanako&#x27;s stepbrother, the son of Mr. Misonoo&#x27;s first marriage, though he keeps this secret from Nanako so as not to air the family&#x27;s dirty laundry in a society that still looks down on divorce. He was involved with Kaoru approximately two years prior to the series&#x27; start, though after she was diagnosed she ended their relationship so neither of them would suffer. He is acquainted with the Ichinomiya family through his best friend, Takashi. He appears to know of the situation with Rei, though if this information was revealed through Kaoru or Takashi is not stated. By the end of the series he rekindles his relationship with his father and marries Kaoru, before moving to Germany.
:
:Takashi is introduced as a friend of Takehiko, and is often seen accompanying him. Takashi is good-natured and caring, showing considerable interest in the well-being of his younger sisters and especially the troubled Rei. Takashi is incredibly supportive of Takehiko, frequently driving him around and going so far as to plan and pay for his friend&#x27;s entire wedding at the show&#x27;s conclusion. It is hinted that he has a strained relationship with his father. He also seems to be impressed by Mariko&#x27;s fiery personality (though his reactions are mixed in the anime), and supports her when she runs off after attacking Aya.
;Miyuki Sonobe
:An anime-exclusive character, introduced as one of Aya Misaki&#x27;s two friends. She has pigtails and hair decorations, and is almost never seen without either Aya or their common friend Megumi Furuta. She and Megumi are seen as few more than Aya&#x27;s &quot;girl posse&quot;, supporting her bullying of Nanako and Mariko. In episode 27, it&#x27;s revealed that she and Megumi actually do care for Aya&#x27;s well-being instead of just liking her high status; this leads Komabayashi and Ogiwara to manipulate them both for their benefit
;Megumi Furuta
:An anime-exclusive character, of Aya Misaki&#x27;s other friend. She has short hair and a deep voice, and is almost never seen without either Aya or Miyuki. She and Miyuki are seen as few more than Aya&#x27;s &quot;girl posse&quot;, supporting her bullying of Nanako and Mariko. Like Miyuki, her motivations (misguided but genuine affection for Aya) are revealed in episode 27.
;Junko Nakaya
A girl from another first-year classroom, was chosen to be in the Sorority alongside Mariko and Nanako. She becomes the first member of the Sorority who is expelled from it due to her bad grades, despite having a reasonable excuse (her bad health); Fukiko further humiliates her by exposing her case to everyone in the Sorority and then demanding for her to resign, despite Nanako&#x27;s objections. She ultimately does so, and later confesses to Nanako that she had begun to feel uncomfortable in the Sorority itself. In the anime she is given some more spotlight, as she is introduced via speaking to a friend about Nanako&#x27;s qualifications to be in the Sorority, which angers Mariko; few later, she rejoins the cast and befriends Nanako more properly. Later in the series, she returns to support to motion to abolish the sorority.
;Mr. and Mrs. Misonoo
Nanako&#x27;s parents, or more exactly, Nanako&#x27;s mother and stepfather. Mr. Misonoo, a well-known and respected college professor, was formerly married to Takehiko Henmi&#x27;s mother, and after a very bitter divorce, he took to drinking his sorrows away; Nanako&#x27;s mother was the waitress of the pub that he attended the most, and once the professor sobered up, they fell in love and got married. Ever since then Professor Misonoo has been a kind father figure to Nanako, though he was not able to rekindle his bonds to Takehiko as well; he and his new wife still worked hard to both be able to support themselves and help Takehiko after his mother&#x27;s death. When Nanako is chosen as a Sorority member, one of the reasons she was questioned the most for was the assumption that her mother was a homewrecker, which was obviously false.
;Hisako and Hikawa Shinobu
Mariko Shinobu&#x27;s parents. Hikawa Shinobu is a rich and popular erotica writer, and his work is used by Aya and her group to bully Mariko at school; not to mention, his affair with an ex-actress is very well known, as well as the reason why Mariko hates men of all kinds. Hisako attempts to take care of Mariko as much as she can while ignoring her own troubles, but while Mariko loves her deeply, her forceful personality sometimes is too much to handle. In the manga, Hikawa never made proper apparitions; in the anime, however, he and his mistress show up in person.

===The Sorority===
:The Seiran Sorority is an amalgamation of a student government, an extracurricular club, and an elite society, and is a school tradition that is said to date back to at least the 1930s. Similar to western fraternities and sororities, prospective members seem to be nominated by those already in the Sorority, and undergo a pledge period in which they are interviewed for fitness. Family legacy, appropriate extracurricular activities, and attractive appearances are the main considerations for admission. The Sorority appears to have around forty or fifty members, though several of the senior members are given prominence and special nicknames. They are primarily referred to by these nicknames, though later in the series their surnames are revealed. Their given names were never shown.

;&quot;Lady Borgia&quot; Ogiwara
:Borgia is a senior member of the Sorority, and is commonly seen wearing her hair in a chignon. Her position in the Sorority is never expressly stated. During the Petition Arc, she is presented as the most adamant member of the plot to discredit Fukiko, with intentions of taking over as President, herself. She holds a strong dislike of Fukiko and shows frustration with the other girl&#x27;s staunch pride.
;&quot;Lady Mona Lisa&quot; Komabayashi
:Mona Lisa is a senior member of the Sorority, and resembles her namesake, possessing long black hair and an enigmatic expression. She is stated as being the Sorority&#x27;s Vice-President and a good friend of Ogiwara. Reserved and mysterious, she is quite invested in the Sorority. She eventually goes along with the other members during the Petition Arc, though contests Borgia when she realizes their machinations have gone too far.
;&quot;Lady Medusa&quot; Katsuragi
:Medusa is a senior member of the Sorority, and briefly serves as Vice-President after Mona Lisa&#x27;s resignation. She has bushy brown hair. She appears to be Fukiko&#x27;s only friend within the Sorority; the two are often seen conversing pleasantly, and during the Petition Arc she is the last member to remain on Fukiko&#x27;s side.
;&quot;Lady Cattleya&quot; Yamamoto
:Cattleya is a senior member of the Sorority, and has curly brown hair with side-swept bangs. Cattleya plays a role in the conspiracy to discredit Fukiko, though she pulls out when Borgia&#x27;s schemes prove too ridiculous. She seems fairly kind, and willingly helps Nanako with the petition after resigning.
;&quot;Lady Vampanella&quot; Hoshino
:Vampanella is a senior Sorority member, and wears her dark hair in a ponytail with a bow. She appears close with Cattleya; the two both abandon Borgia to her schemes during the Petition Arc. She is seen to be a smoker outside of school.

==Themes==
The show&#x27;s themes revolve around suicide, incest, lesbianism, drug addiction, violence, divorce, and disease. Rei Asaka has a deep love for Fukiko Ichinomiya which can be seen as incestuous due to later revelations about their actual relationship and early interactions with each other. Lesbianism is mentioned due to heavy overtones of female interaction at an all girls school, as well as Nanako&#x27;s romantic feelings towards Rei, and Mariko&#x27;s feelings towards Kaoru.

===Anime===

The series was dubbed and released in Italy, Spain, Arabia and France, though it was pulled after seven episodes in France, due to strong adult content. A Greek version is also known to have existed, with its broadcast halted between the commercial breaks in the third episode. The anime series is available online to viewers in the United States through Viki.com, Hulu, and YouTube. Anime Sols has successfully crowdfunded the entire the show for North American DVD. Under the title &quot;Dear Brother&quot;, three DVD box sets were released between July 29, 2014, and April 7, 2015. RetroCrush started streaming in United States and Canada from October, 2020 via streaming app and website under the title &quot;Dear Brother&quot;. Discotek Media has re-licensed the series.

==Reception==
Lynzee Loveridge of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; noted that in the series &quot;everyone&#x27;s off their rockers and has beautiful clothes&quot; and called the Seiran Academy&#x27;s Sorority &quot;relentless&quot; and slighting anyone who is not &quot;perfect&quot;. Erica Friedman of &quot;Okazu&quot; described the series as &quot;extraordinarily dark&quot; and centered around one person: Ichinomiya Fukiko. Carlos Ross of &quot;THEM Anime Reviews&quot; said that the series is not known in the United States, but the subject matter, the &quot;cruel machinations of high-school age girls&quot; is treated frankly in this &quot;character-driven story&quot;. Ross did say that some newcomers to the series may not like the enka which &quot;might be a bit slow and plaintive for Western ears&quot;, while saying the music is appropriate, and noted that the series has a &quot;reputation...for having lesbian overtones&quot;, adding that the anime is a &quot;classic&quot;.

<text>Jeffrey Michael Tambor (born July 8, 1944) is an American actor. He is known for his television roles such as Jeffrey Brookes, the uptight neighbor of Stanley and Helen Roper in the television sitcom &quot;The Ropers&quot; (1979–1980), as Hank Kingsley on &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; (1992–1998), George Bluth Sr. and Oscar Bluth on &quot;Arrested Development&quot; (2003–2006, 2013, 2018–2019) and Maura Pfefferman on &quot;Transparent&quot; (2014–2017). For his role in the latter, Tambor earned two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series out of three nominations. In 2015, he was also awarded a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Pfefferman.

His film roles include Jay Porter in &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; (1979), Jinx Latham in &quot;Mr. Mom&quot; (1983), Sully in &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot; (1998), Mayor Augustus May Who in &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; (2000), Tom Manning in &quot;Hellboy&quot; (2004) and its sequel &quot;Hellboy II: The Golden Army&quot; (2008), Sid Garner in &quot;The Hangover&quot; trilogy (2009–2013), Francis Silverberg in &quot;The Accountant&quot; (2016), and Georgy Malenkov in &quot;The Death of Stalin&quot; (2017).

Tambor has done voice acting for &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot; (2004), &quot;Monsters vs. Aliens&quot; (2009), &quot;Tangled&quot; (2010), and &quot;Trolls&quot; (2016). For his voice role in &quot;The Lionhearts&quot; (1998), he was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award. From 2002 to 2003, he was an announcer for &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;.

==Early life==
Tambor was born on July 8, 1944, in San Francisco, California, the son of Eileen (), a homemaker, and Bernard Tambor, a flooring contractor. He grew up in a Conservative Jewish family with roots in Hungary and Ukraine. Tambor is a graduate of Abraham Lincoln High School and San Francisco State University, where he studied acting and then went on to receive a master&#x27;s degree from Wayne State University.

==Career==
Tambor first moved to repertory theater in Milwaukee, later making his Broadway debut in the comedy &quot;Sly Fox&quot; (1976), appearing with George C. Scott and directed by Arthur Penn. He appeared in &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; in the same year. In 1979, he starred in Norman Jewison&#x27;s &quot;...And Justice For All&quot;, as a lawyer friend of the protagonist, Arthur Kirkland (Al Pacino). In an early TV job, an ad for Avis Rent a Car System, he was seen running through an airport, mocking O. J. Simpson&#x27;s &quot;Go, O.J., go!&quot; ads for Hertz. On television, he made guest appearances on shows including &quot;Taxi&quot;, &quot;Kojak&quot;, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, and &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;. In 1979, he got his first role as a main character in television in the short-lived show &quot;The Ropers&quot;. Throughout the 1980s, he had a recurring role on &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; playing a defense attorney who eventually becomes a judge. In 1981, he appeared in an episode of &quot;Barney Miller&quot; as a man who was trying to bring exposure to the members of the Trilateral Commission in charge of the coming New World Order. In 1987, and 1988, he appeared as a regular on the prime time ABC series &quot;Max Headroom&quot; as Murray, Edison&#x27;s editor. In 1990, he appeared in the music video for the Phil Collins song &quot;I Wish It Would Rain Down&quot;.

Tambor played Hank Kingsley, the narcissistic sidekick of fictional talk show host Larry Sanders on &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; (1992–1998). Tambor received four Emmy nominations for his performance on the show—all of which he would lose, to Michael Richards for &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, David Hyde Pierce for &quot;Frasier&quot;, and his co-star Rip Torn.

Beginning in 2003, Tambor starred in the television comedy &quot;Arrested Development&quot; as George Bluth Sr. and in some episodes as his twin brother Oscar Bluth. The show was cancelled in 2006, after three seasons, but a fourth season was released on Netflix in 2013. In 2004, Tambor received his fifth Emmy nomination for his work on the show. He lost to David Hyde Pierce for the final season of the sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot;. Tambor was nominated for a sixth time in 2005 but lost to Brad Garrett for the final season of &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;. The second episode of &quot;Arrested Development&quot;″s third season lampooned this loss: Tambor&#x27;s character&#x27;s son describes his acting ability by saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a wonderful performance, Dad. You&#x27;re a regular Brad Garrett.&quot;

Tambor was the announcer for the game show &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; in 2002 and 2003. He was the voice of King Neptune in 2004&#x27;s &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot;. In the spring of 2005, he starred as George Aaronow in the Broadway revival of &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; alongside Alan Alda, Liev Schreiber, and Gordon Clapp. After the cancellation of &quot;Arrested Development&quot; in April 2006, Tambor signed on to a series with John Lithgow called &quot;Twenty Good Years&quot; about two men who ponder the preceding 20 years of their lives. The show premiered on NBC on October 11, 2006, but was taken off the air after only a few episodes. Also in 2006, he portrayed George Washington on &quot;The Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd&quot;. He starred as &quot;Uncle&quot; Saul in the CBS comedy &quot;Welcome to The Captain&quot; until its cancellation in March 2008. He has made several cameo appearances on &quot;Entourage&quot; as a fictionalized version of himself who regularly annoys his agent, Ari Gold. For several years, based on his availability, Tambor has taught a class for actors. He was a longtime teaching associate of acting coach Milton Katselas.

In 2009, Tambor appeared in the animated film &quot;Monsters vs. Aliens&quot; and in the comedy &quot;The Hangover&quot;. In 2009, Tambor began playing the recurring character Len Trexler in the sardonic comedy &quot;Archer&quot;, an animated television series on the FX network. He is a major love interest to Malory Archer played by Jessica Walter – the two formerly playing husband and wife in &quot;Arrested Development&quot;. Tambor replaced Kelsey Grammer as Georges in the Broadway revival of the musical &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; on February 15, 2011, but withdrew from the production after the February 24 performance. Also in 2011, Tambor starred in an indie comedy, &quot;Lucky&quot;. That same year, he had a minor role in the film &quot;Paul&quot; with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, reprised his &quot;Hangover&quot; role for its sequel, and was featured in &quot;Flypaper&quot;, with Patrick Dempsey and Ashley Judd.

In 2012, Tambor co-starred as Walt, Pete&#x27;s aspiring musician father on the sitcom &quot;Bent&quot; starring Amanda Peet and David Walton. In May 2013 he returned to &quot;Arrested Development&quot; for season 4 and subsequently, season 5 in 2018–2019. In 2017 he played Georgy Malenkov in &quot;The Death of Stalin&quot;. In May 2017, Tambor released a book entitled &quot;Are You Anybody? A Memoir&quot;.

In February 2014, Amazon premiered its original series &quot;Transparent&quot;, which starred Tambor as Maura Pfefferman (born Morton Pfefferman), a divorced transgender Jewish parent of three. Tambor won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy for his portrayal and thanked the transgender community in his speech. He won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series for his performance in season 1 of the show, his first win in 7 Primetime Emmy Award nominations. This made him the first actor to win an Emmy for portraying a transgender character. For the show&#x27;s second season, Tambor again received positive reviews, as well as a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy, and wins for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series and the Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Comedy Series. Following allegations of sexual harassment, Tambor said he would not return for the show&#x27;s fifth season, which was later confirmed on February 15, 2018, when Amazon confirmed to &quot;Deadline&quot; that Tambor was not coming back and that the harassment investigation was recently concluded.

==Personal life==
Tambor and his wife Kasia have a son Gabriel Kasper, born circa 2006, younger daughter Eve Julia, born circa 2007, and twin sons Hugo Bernard and Eli Nicholas, born October 2009. Tambor also has adult daughters from earlier relationships.

In 2007, Tambor was reported to be a Scientologist. In February 2008, he expressed concern about &quot;Internet reports&quot; about his alleged involvement with Scientology and stated that he &quot;took some Scientology classes at one time, studied Scientology for a while, but no more. I have nothing against it, but I am no longer a Scientologist.&quot; In 2017, Tambor disclosed that he had left Scientology abruptly &quot;when he was pressured to leave his second wife.&quot;

===Sexual misconduct allegations===
On November 8, 2017, Tambor was accused of sexual misconduct by his former assistant, Van Barnes. On November 16, 2017, actress Trace Lysette additionally made accusations against Tambor. Both of his accusers are trans women, a fact which later influenced Tambor’s decision to leave &quot;Transparent&quot;. Tambor responded, &quot;I am deeply sorry if any action of mine was ever misinterpreted by anyone as being sexually aggressive or if I ever offended or hurt anyone. But the fact is, for all my flaws, I am not a predator and the idea that someone might see me in that way is more distressing than I can express.&quot; Days later, makeup artist Tamara Delbridge also accused Tambor of sexual improprieties on the set of the 2001 film &quot;Never Again&quot;. Tambor said he did not recall the incident, but apologized &quot;for any discomfort or offense I may have inadvertently caused her.&quot;

By this time, Tambor had left &quot;Transparent&quot;, saying in a statement on November 19, &quot;Playing Maura Pfefferman on &quot;Transparent&quot; has been one of the greatest privileges and creative experiences of my life. What has become clear over the past weeks, however, is that this is no longer the job I signed up for four years ago. I&#x27;ve already made clear my deep regret if any action of mine was ever misinterpreted by anyone as being aggressive, but the idea that I would deliberately harass anyone is simply and utterly untrue. Given the politicized atmosphere that seems to have afflicted our set, I don&#x27;t see how I can return to &quot;Transparent&quot;.&quot; The allegations came after filming for the fifth season of &quot;Arrested Development&quot; had been completed that same month. &quot;Arrested Development&quot;″s team supported Tambor in his defense against the allegations and his scenes remained within the show.

In his first interview after leaving &quot;Transparent&quot;, Tambor, speaking to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; in May 2018, continued to deny allegations that he had sexually harassed his former assistant or Trace Lysette on the series, but admitted to having anger issues throughout his life. He also said that while he was on the show he &quot;worried [himself] to death&quot; about whether he was portraying his transgender character truthfully, and that the stress sometimes made him &quot;difficult&quot; and &quot;mean&quot;. Tambor mentioned one &quot;blowup&quot; he had with &quot;Arrested Development&quot; co-star Jessica Walter during the show&#x27;s production.

On May 23, 2018, Walter said in a &quot;New York Times&quot; cast interview that Tambor had verbally harassed her. &quot;He never crossed the line on our show with any, you know, sexual whatever. Verbally, yes, he harassed me, but he did apologize ... In like almost 60 years of working, I&#x27;ve never had anybody yell at me like that on a set.&quot; When asked whether she had reservations about working with Tambor again, Walter said, &quot;Of course not.&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t want to walk around with anger,&quot; she added. &quot;I respect him as an actor. We&#x27;ve known each other for years and years and years. Of course, I would work with him again in a heartbeat.&quot;

<doc id="579034" wikidata="Q7490444" url="?curid=579034" title="Sharpstown scandal">
<text>The Sharpstown scandal was a stock fraud scandal in the state of Texas in 1971 and 1972 involving the highest levels of the state government. The name came from the involvement of the Sharpstown area of Houston.

==Background==
The scandal revolved around Houston banker and insurance company manager Frank Sharp and his companies, the Sharpstown State Bank and the National Bankers Life Insurance Corporation (NBL). Sharp granted $600,000 in loans from his bank to state officials who would, in turn, purchase stock in National Bankers Life, to be resold later at a huge profit, after Sharp artificially inflated the company&#x27;s value. One of the victims of the scandal, Strake Jesuit College Preparatory, lost $6,000,000 and a portion of the school&#x27;s land following the advice of Sharp. The school bought the resold stock at $20–$26 a share. Using the stock as encouragement, Sharp pushed for legislation that would benefit National Bankers Life, increasing the value of the company to its investors—the very people who would push the legislation through.

The scheme succeeded in generating profits for the investors on the order of a quarter of a million dollars, but the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stepped in early in 1971, filing criminal and civil charges against former state attorney general Waggoner Carr (D), former state insurance commissioner John Osorio, Frank Sharp, and a number of others. By the middle of 1971, anyone in the state government who might have been connected to Sharp was heavily pressured politically. Allegations of bribery to push the favorable bills through the government spread to House Speaker Gus Mutscher Jr. (D), State Representative Thomas Clifton “Tommy” Shannon (D), state Democratic chairman and state banking board member Elmer Baum, Lieutenant Governor Ben Barnes (D), and even Governor Preston Smith (D).

==Outcome==
Gus Mutscher was indicted by the SEC in late 1971, and subsequently tried in Abilene in 1972. He was found guilty of conspiracy for accepting a bribe from Sharp, and sentenced to five years’ probation. As a convicted felon, he was forced to resign his seat. Mutscher appealed the charges, and after the scandal had calmed down, the charges were overturned. He was then elected to county judge of Washington County, and worked as a political consultant and lobbyist until his death in 2023. Sharp was also found guilty of violating federal banking and securities laws, and was sentenced to three years’ probation and a $5,000 fine. 

State Representative Tommy Shannon and Rush McGinty (one of Mutscher’s aides) were also convicted of accepting a bribe from Sharp, and sentenced to five years’ probation. 

Although none of the other elected officials were found guilty, the damage had already been done to the two Democratic politicians. 1972 was an election year, and everyone who was remotely connected to the scandal was defeated by more moderate Democrats, Republicans, or other reform candidates.

Although not brought to trial, Governor Preston Smith and Lieutenant Governor Ben Barnes saw their political careers effectively ended. Smith, who called the special session to consider the NBL-favorable legislation and then sold his NBL stock for a $62,500 profit before vetoing the legislation, was defeated in the primaries by businessman Dolph Briscoe of Uvalde.

Attorney General Crawford Martin, who in 1967 issued a legal opinion that was said to have allowed a 2,200% increase in the bank’s capitalization, was defeated in the Democratic Primary for renomination by John L. Hill.

The final impact of the stock fraud scandal on Texas politics occurred during the regular session of the legislature in 1973. The lawmakers, led by new House Speaker Price Daniel Jr. of Liberty, a political moderate and son of a former governor, supported by Attorney General Hill, Lieutenant Governor Hobby, and Governor Briscoe, passed a series of far-reaching reform laws. The legislation required state officials to disclose their sources of income, forced candidates to make public more details about their campaign finances, opened up most governmental records to citizen scrutiny, expanded the requirement for open meetings of governmental policy-making agencies, and imposed new disclosure regulations on paid lobbyists.

==The &quot;Dirty Thirty&quot;==
&quot;Dirty Thirty&quot; was the name given, by Dan Cain, House Committee Clerk, to thirty members of the 1971 Texas House of Representatives who grouped against Texas Speaker of the House Gus Mutscher and other Texas officials charged in the Sharpstown scandal. The coalition of thirty Democrats and Republicans, conservatives and liberals, has been given credit for keeping the Sharpstown stock fraud scandal alive as a political issue.

<text>Tortellini is a type of stuffed pasta typical of the Italian cities of Bologna and Modena, in the Emilia-Romagna region. Traditionally it is stuffed with a mix of meat (pork loin, prosciutto, mortadella), Parmesan cheese, egg and nutmeg and served in capon broth ().

In the area of origin it is usually sold fresh or home-made. Industrially packaged, dried, refrigerated, or frozen tortellini appear in many locations around the world, especially where there are large Italian communities.

==Origins==
The origin of tortellini is disputed; both Bologna and Modena, cities in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, claim to be its birthplace. The etymology of is the diminutive form of , itself a diminutive of (). 

The recipe for a dish called appears in 1570 from Bartolomeo Scappi. Vincenzo Tanara&#x27;s writings in the mid-17th century may be responsible for the pasta&#x27;s renaming to tortellini. In the 1800s, legends sprang up to explain the recipe&#x27;s origins, offering a compromise. Castelfranco Emilia, located between Bologna and Modena, is featured in one legend, in which Venus stays at an inn. Overcome by her beauty, the innkeeper spies on her through a keyhole, through which he can only see her navel. He is inspired to create a pasta in this shape. This legend would be at the origin of the term (), occasionally used to describe tortellini. In honour of this legend, an annual festival is held in Castelfranco Emilia. Another legend posits that the shape comes from Modena&#x27;s architecture, which resembles a turtle.

==Comparison with ==
 is pasta in a similar shape, but larger, typically 5 g, vs. 2 g for tortellini. While tortellini has a meat-based filling, is filled with ricotta and sometimes with parsley or spinach. Moreover, while tortellini is traditionally cooked in and served with broth, is cooked in water, stir-fried (traditionally with butter and sage) and served dry.

<doc id="579041" wikidata="Q1266982" url="?curid=579041" title="Magnetomotive force">
<text>In physics, the magnetomotive force (abbreviated mmf or MMF, symbol formula_1) is a quantity appearing in the equation for the magnetic flux in a magnetic circuit, Hopkinson&#x27;s law. It is the property of certain substances or phenomena that give rise to magnetic fields:
formula_2
where is the magnetic flux and formula_3 is the reluctance of the circuit. It can be seen that the magnetomotive force plays a role in this equation analogous to the voltage in Ohm&#x27;s law, , since it is the cause of magnetic flux in a magnetic circuit:
# formula_4 where is the number of turns in a coil and is the electric current through the coil.
# formula_5 where is the magnetic flux and formula_3 is the magnetic reluctance
# formula_7 where is the magnetizing force (the strength of the magnetizing field) and is the mean length of a solenoid or the circumference of a toroid.

==Units==
The SI unit of mmf is the ampere, the same as the unit of current (analogously the units of emf and voltage are both the volt). Informally, and frequently, this unit is stated as the ampere-turn to avoid confusion with current. This was the unit name in the MKS system. Occasionally, the cgs system unit of the gilbert may also be encountered.

==History==
The term &quot;magnetomotive force&quot; was coined by Henry Augustus Rowland in 1880. Rowland intended this to indicate a direct analogy with electromotive force. The idea of a magnetic analogy to electromotive force can be found much earlier in the work of Michael Faraday (1791–1867) and it is hinted at by James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879). However, Rowland coined the term and was the first to make explicit an Ohm&#x27;s law for magnetic circuits in 1873.

&quot;Ohm&#x27;s law for magnetic circuits&quot; is sometimes referred to as Hopkinson&#x27;s law rather than Rowland&#x27;s law as some authors attribute the law to John Hopkinson instead of Rowland. According to a review of magnetic circuit analysis methods this is an incorrect attribution originating from an 1885 paper by Hopkinson. Furthermore, Hopkinson actually cites Rowland&#x27;s 1873 paper in this work.

<text>The Haggadah (, &quot;telling&quot;; plural: Haggadot) is a foundational Jewish text that sets forth the order of the Passover Seder. According to Jewish practice, reading the Haggadah at the Seder table fulfills the mitzvah incumbent on every Jew to recount the Egyptian Exodus story to their children on the first night of Passover.

==History==
===Authorship===
According to Jewish tradition, the Haggadah developed during the Mishnaic and Talmudic periods, although the exact timeframe is unknown. It is unlikely that it was assembled before the time of Judah bar Ilai (), the latest tanna quoted therein. It is usually assumed that a set text did not exist prior to a crucial dispute about the Haggadah&#x27;s arrangement recorded in the Babylonian Talmud. The Vilna edition of the Talmud identifies the participants in that dispute as Abba Arika and Samuel of Nehardea (), but the later was more likely Rava (c. 280-352 CE). From a statement of Rav Nachman, it appears he was aware of a set Haggadah text, but there is a dispute about which Rav Nachman the Talmud referred to, Rav Nachman bar Yaakov (), or Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak (c. 360 CE). A minority of commentators, including Naftali Maskil LeAison, author of the &quot;Malbim Haggadah,&quot; believe that the Haggadah&#x27;s text was already complete at the time of Abba Arika and Samuel and that they were arguing about the Haggadah&#x27;s interpretation rather than its arrangement. The &quot;Malbim Haggadah&quot; theorizes that the Haggadah was written by the compiler of the Mishnah, Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi (c. 135-217 CE).
One of the most ancient parts is the recital of the &quot;Hallel&quot;, which, according to the Mishnah (Pesachim 5:7), was sung at the sacrifice in the Temple in Jerusalem, and of which, according to the school of Shammai, only the first chapter shall be recited. After the Psalms a blessing for the Redemption is to be said. This blessing, according to Rabbi Tarfon, runs as follows: &quot;Praised art Thou, O Lord, King of the Universe, who hast redeemed us, and hast redeemed our fathers from Egypt.&quot;

Another part of the oldest ritual, as is recorded in the Mishnah, is the conclusion of the &quot;Hallel&quot; (up to Psalms 118), and the closing benediction of the hymn &quot;Birkat ha-Shir&quot;, which latter the &quot;Amoraim&quot; explain differently, but which evidently was similar to the benediction thanking God, &quot;who loves the songs of praise,&quot; used in the present ritual.

These blessings, and the narrations of Israel&#x27;s history in Egypt, based on Deuteronomy 26:5–9 and on Joshua 24:2–4, with some introductory remarks, were added in the time of the early &quot;Amoraim&quot; in the third century CE.

In post-Talmudic times, during the era of the &quot;Geonim&quot;, selections from midrashim were added; most likely Rabbi Amram Gaon () was the originator of the present collection, as he was the redactor of the daily liturgy in the siddur. Of these &quot;midrashim&quot; one of the most important is that of the four children, representing four different attitudes towards why Jews should observe Passover. This division is taken from the Jerusalem Talmud and from a parallel passage in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael; it is slightly altered in the present ritual. Other rabbinic quotes from the aggadah literature are added, as the story of Eliezer ben Hurcanus, who discussed the Exodus all night with four other rabbis, which tale is found in an altogether different form in the Tosefta.

While the main portions of the text of the Haggadah have remained mostly the same since their original compilation, there have been some additions after the last part of the text. Some of these additions, such as the cumulative songs &quot;One little goat&quot; (חד גדיא) and &quot;Who Knows One?&quot; (אחד מי יודע), which were added sometime in the fifteenth century, gained such acceptance that they became a standard to print at the back of the Haggadah.

The text of the Haggadah was never fixed in one, final form, as no rabbinic body existed which had authority over such matters. Instead, each local community developed its own text. A variety of traditional texts took on a standardized form by the end of the medieval era on the Ashkenazi (Eastern European) and Sephardi (Spanish, North African, and Middle Eastern) communities.

The Karaites and also the Samaritans developed their own Haggadot which they use to the present day.

During the era of the Enlightenment the European Jewish community developed into groups that reacted in different ways to modifications of the Haggadah.
* Orthodox Judaism accepted certain fixed texts as authoritative and normative, and prohibited any changes to the text.
* Modern Orthodox Judaism and Conservative Judaism allowed for minor additions and deletions to the text, in accord with the same historical-legal parameters as occurred in previous generations. Rabbis within the Conservative Judaism, studying the liturgical history of the Haggadah and Siddur, conclude that there is a traditional dynamic of innovation, within a framework conserving the tradition. While innovations became less common in the last few centuries due to the introduction of the printing press and various social factors, Conservative Jews take pride in their community&#x27;s resumption of the traditional of liturgical creativity within a halakhic framework.
* Reform Judaism holds that there are no normative texts, and allowed individuals to create their own Haggadot. Reform Jews take pride in their community&#x27;s resumption of liturgical creativity outside a halakhic framework. 

===Manuscript history===
The oldest surviving complete manuscript of the Haggadah dates to the 10th century. It is part of a prayer book compiled by Saadia Gaon. It is now believed that the Haggadah first became produced as an independent book in codex form around 1000 CE. Maimonides (1135–1204) included the Haggadah in his code of Jewish law, the Mishneh Torah. Existing manuscripts do not go back beyond the thirteenth century. When such a volume was compiled, it became customary to add poetical pieces.
The earliest surviving Haggadot produced as works in their own right are manuscripts from the 13th and 14th centuries, such as the Golden Haggadah (probably Barcelona , now British Library) and the Sarajevo Haggadah (late fourteenth century). Other significant medieval illustrated haggadot are the Birds&#x27; Head Haggadah and the Washington Haggadah.

It is believed that the first printed Haggadot were produced in 1482, in Guadalajara, Spain; however, this is mostly conjecture, as there is no printer&#x27;s colophon. The oldest confirmed printed Haggadah was printed in Soncino, Lombardy in 1486 by the Soncino family.

Although the Jewish printing community was quick to adopt the printing press as a means of producing texts, the general adoption rate of printed Haggadot was slow. By the end of the sixteenth century, only twenty-five editions had been printed. This number increased to thirty-seven during the seventeenth century, and 234 during the eighteenth century. It is not until the nineteenth century, when 1,269 separate editions were produced, that a significant shift is seen toward printed Haggadot as opposed to manuscripts. From 1900 to 1960 alone, over 1,100 Haggadot were printed.
It is not uncommon, particularly in America, for haggadot to be produced by corporate entities, such as coffee maker Maxwell House – see Maxwell House Haggadah – serving as texts for the celebration of Passover, but also as marketing tools and ways of showing that certain foods are kosher.

===Illuminated manuscripts===

The earliest Ashkenazi illuminated Haggada is known as the Birds&#x27; Head Haggadah, made in Germany around the 1320s and now in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.
The Rylands Haggadah (Rylands Hebrew MS. 6) is one of the finest Haggadot in the world. It was written and illuminated in Spain in the 14th century and is an example of the cross-fertilisation between Jewish and non-Jewish artists within the medium of manuscript illumination. In spring and summer 2012 it was exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, in the exhibition &#x27;The Rylands Haggadah: Medieval Jewish Art in Context&#x27;.

The British Library&#x27;s 14th century Barcelona Haggadah (BL Add. MS 14761) is one of the most richly pictorial of all Jewish texts. Meant to accompany the Passover eve service and festive meal, it was also a status symbol for its owner in 14th-century Spain. Nearly all its folios are filled with miniatures depicting Passover rituals, Biblical and Midrashic episodes, and symbolic foods. A facsimile edition was published by Facsimile Editions of London in 1992.

Published in 1526, the is known for its attention to detail in lettering and for introducing many of the themes still found in modern texts. Although illustrations had often been a part of the Haggadah, it was not until the Prague Haggadah that they were used extensively in printed text. The Haggadah features over sixty woodcut illustrations picturing &quot;scenes and symbols of the Passover ritual; ... biblical and rabbinic elements that actually appear in the Haggadah text; and scenes and figures from biblical or other sources that play no role in the Haggadah itself, but have either past or future redemptive associations&quot;.

Other illuminated Haggadot include the Sarajevo Haggadah, Washington Haggadah, and the 20th-century Szyk Haggadah.

==Passover Seder according to the Haggadah==
===&quot;Kadeish&quot; (blessings and the first cup of wine)===
&quot;Kadeish&quot; is the Hebrew imperative form of &quot;Kiddush&quot;. This &quot;Kiddush&quot; is a blessing similar to that which is recited on all of the pilgrimage festivals, but also refers to matzot and the exodus from Egypt. Acting in a way that shows freedom and majesty, many Jews have the custom of filling each other&#x27;s cups at the Seder table. The Kiddush is traditionally said by the father of the house, but all Seder participants participate by reciting the Kiddush and drinking at least a majority of a cup of wine. On Shabbat, it is preceded by a reading from the Book of Genesis recounting God&#x27;s rest on the seventh day of creation and includes an extended doxology on the blessings of Shabbat.

===&quot;Ur&#x27;chatz&quot; (wash hands)===
Partakers wash their hands in preparation for eating wet fruit and vegetables, which happens in the next stage. Technically, according to Jewish law, whenever one partakes of fruit or vegetables dipped in liquid, one must wash one&#x27;s hands, if the fruit or vegetable remains wet. However, this situation does not often arise at other times of the year because either one will dry fruits and vegetables before eating them, or one has already washed one&#x27;s hands, because one must also wash one&#x27;s hands before eating bread.

According to most traditions, no blessing is recited at this point in the Seder, unlike the blessing recited over the washing of the hands before eating bread. However, followers of Rambam or the Gaon of Vilna do recite a blessing.

===&quot;Karpas&quot;===

Each participant dips a sprig of parsley or similar leafy green into either &quot;salt water&quot; (Ashkenazi custom said to serve as a reminder of the tears shed by their enslaved ancestors), &quot;vinegar&quot; (Sephardi custom) or &quot;charoset&quot; (older Sephardi custom; still common among Yemenite Jews).

===&quot;Yachatz&quot; (breaking of the middle matzah)===
Three matzot are stacked on the seder table; at this stage, the middle matzah of the three is broken in half. According to the custom of the Vilna Gaon and others, only two matzot are used, and the top one is broken. The larger piece is hidden, to be used later as the &quot;afikoman&quot;, the &quot;dessert&quot; after the meal. The smaller piece is returned to its place between the other two matzot.

===&quot;Magid&quot; (relating the Exodus)===
The story of Passover, and the change from slavery to freedom is told. At this point in the Seder, Sefardic Jews (North African) have a custom of raising the Seder plate over the heads of all those present while chanting: Moroccan Jews sing &quot;Bivhilu yatzanu mimitzrayim, halahma anya b&#x27;nei horin&quot; (In haste we went out of Egypt [with our] bread of affliction, [now we are] free people), Algerian Jews sing &quot;Ethmol &#x27;ayinu abadim, hayom benei &#x27;horin, hayom kan, leshana habaa bear&#x27;a deYisrael bene &#x27;horin&quot; (Yesterday we were slaves, today we are free, today we are here -in exile-, next year we will be in Israel free&quot;.

===&quot;Ha Lachma Anya&quot; (invitation to the Seder)===
The matzot are uncovered, and referred to as the &quot;bread of affliction&quot;. Participants declare in Aramaic an invitation to all who are hungry or needy to join in the Seder. Halakha requires that this invitation be repeated in the native language of the country.

===&quot;Ma Nishtanah&quot; (The Four Questions)===

The Mishnah details questions one is obligated to ask on the night of the Seder. It is customary for the youngest child present to recite the four questions. Some customs hold that the other participants recite them quietly to themselves as well. In some families, this means that the requirement remains on an adult &quot;child&quot; until a grandchild of the family receives sufficient Jewish education to take on the responsibility. If a person has no children capable of asking, the responsibility falls to the spouse, or another participant. The need to ask is so great that even if a person is alone at the seder he is obligated to ask himself and to answer his own questions.

Why is this night different from all other nights?
# Why is it that on all other nights during the year we eat either leavened bread or matza, but on this night we eat only matza?
# Why is it that on all other nights we eat all kinds of vegetables, but on this night we eat bitter herbs?
# Why is it that on all other nights we do not dip [our food] even once, but on this night we dip them twice?
# Why is it that on all other nights we dine either sitting upright or reclining, but on this night we all recline?

=== &quot;Avadim Hayinu&quot; ===
The opening line of Maggid following the Four Questions reads: עֲבָדִים הָיִינוּ לְפַרְעֹה בְּמִצְרָיִם, וַיּוֹצִיאֵנוּ יְיָ אֱלֹהֵינוּ מִשָּׁם בְּיָד חֲזָקָה וּבִזְרֹעַ נְטוּיָה, &quot;We were slaves (Avadim Hayinu) to Pharoah in Egypt, and the Lord our God took us out of there with a strong hand and an outstretched arm&quot;. This is not a scriptual verse, but rather a combination of two verses from Deuteronomy, 6:12 (which precedes the question of the Wise Son), and 5:15 (part of the Ten Commandments). A respona of Natronai Gaon mentions that this traditional opening sentence is not in the Torah, drawing the objection of Karaites. According to the &quot;Scholar&#x27;s Haggadah&quot;, the intentional mistranslation of Deuteronomy 6:12 in the Septuagint, the 3rd century BCE Greek translation of the Torah, makes specific reference to &quot;Avadim Hayinu&quot;.

=== The Four Sons ===
The traditional Haggadah speaks of &quot;four sons—one who is wise, one who is wicked, one who is simple, and one who does not know to ask&quot;. The number four derives from the four passages in the Torah where one is commanded to explain the Exodus to one&#x27;s son. Each of these sons phrases his question about the seder in a different way. The Haggadah recommends answering each son according to his question, using one of the three verses in the Torah that refer to this exchange.

The wise son asks &quot;&quot;What are the statutes, the testimonies, and the laws that God has commanded you to do?&quot; One explanation for why this very detailed-oriented question is categorized as wise, is that the wise son is trying to learn how to carry out the seder, rather than asking for someone else&#x27;s understanding of its meaning. He is answered fully: &quot;You should reply to him with [all] the laws of pesach: one may not eat any dessert after the paschal sacrifice.&quot;

The wicked son, who asks, &quot;What is this service to you?&quot;, is characterized by the Haggadah as isolating himself from the Jewish people, standing by objectively and watching their behavior rather than participating. Therefore, he is rebuked by the explanation that &quot;It is because God acted for my sake when I left Egypt.&quot; (This implies that the Seder is not for the wicked son because the wicked son would not have deserved to be freed from Egyptian slavery.) Where the four sons are illustrated in the Haggadah, this son has frequently been depicted as carrying weapons or wearing stylish contemporary fashions.

The simple son, who asks, &quot;What is this?&quot; is answered with &quot;With a strong hand the Almighty led us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage.&quot;

And the one who does not know to ask is told, &quot;It is because of what the Almighty did for me when I left Egypt.&quot;&quot;

Some modern Haggadot mention &quot;children&quot; instead of &quot;sons&quot;, and some have added a fifth child. The fifth child can represent the children of the Shoah who did not survive to ask a question or represent Jews who have drifted so far from Jewish life that they do not participate in a Seder.

===&quot;Go and learn&quot;===
Four verses in Deuteronomy (26:5–8) are then expounded, with an elaborate, traditional commentary. (&quot;5. And thou shalt speak and say before the thy God: &#x27;A wandering Aramean was my parent, and they went down into Egypt, and sojourned there, few in number; and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous. 6. And the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage. 7. And we cried unto the , the God of our parents, and the heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil, and our oppression. 8 And the brought us forth out of Egypt with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders.&quot;)

The Haggadah explores the meaning of those verses, and embellishes the story. This telling describes the slavery of the Jewish people and their miraculous salvation by God. This culminates in an enumeration of the Ten Plagues:
# &quot;Dam&quot; (blood) – All the water was changed to blood
# &quot;Tzefardeyah&quot; (frogs) – An infestation of frogs sprang up in Egypt
# &quot;Kinim&quot; (lice) – The Egyptians were afflicted by lice
# &quot;Arov&quot; (wild animals) – An infestation of wild animals (some say flies) sprang up in Egypt
# &quot;Dever&quot; (pestilence) – A plague killed off the Egyptian livestock
# &quot;Sh&#x27;chin&quot; (boils) – An epidemic of boils afflicted the Egyptians
# &quot;Barad&quot; (hail) – Hail rained from the sky
# &quot;Arbeh&quot; (locusts) – Locusts swarmed over Egypt
# &quot;Choshech&quot; (darkness) – Egypt was covered in darkness
# &quot;Makkat Bechorot&quot; (killing of the first-born) – All the first-born sons of the Egyptians were slain by God

With the recital of the Ten Plagues, each participant removes a drop of wine from his or her cup using a fingertip. Although this night is one of salvation, the sages explain that one cannot be completely joyous when some of God&#x27;s creatures had to suffer. A mnemonic acronym for the plagues is also introduced: &quot;D&#x27;tzach Adash B&#x27;achav&quot;, while similarly spilling a drop of wine for each word.

At this part in the Seder, songs of praise are sung, including the song &quot;Dayenu&quot;, which proclaims that had God performed any single one of the many deeds performed for the Jewish people, it would have been enough to obligate us to give thanks. After this is a declaration (mandated by Rabban Gamliel) of the reasons of the commandments concerning the Paschal lamb, matzah, and &quot;maror&quot;, with scriptural sources. Then follows a short prayer, and the recital of the first two psalms of Hallel (which will be concluded after the meal). A long blessing is recited, and the second cup of wine is drunk.

===&quot;Rachtzah&quot; (ritual washing of hands)===
The ritual hand-washing is repeated, this time with all customs including a blessing.

===&quot;Motzi Matzah&quot; (blessings over the Matzah)===
Two blessings are recited. First one recites the standard blessing before eating bread, which includes the words &quot;who brings forth&quot; (motzi in Hebrew). Then one recites the blessing regarding the commandment to eat Matzah. An olive-size piece (some say two) is then eaten while reclining.

===&quot;Maror&quot; (bitter herbs)===
The blessing for the eating of the &quot;maror&quot; (bitter herbs) is recited and then it is dipped into the &quot;charoset&quot; and eaten.

===&quot;Koreich&quot; (sandwich)===
The &quot;maror&quot; is placed between two small pieces of matzo, similarly to how the contents of a sandwich are placed between two slices of bread, and eaten. This follows the tradition of Hillel, who did the same at his Seder table 2,000 years ago (except that in Hillel&#x27;s day the Paschal sacrifice, matzo, and &quot;maror&quot; were eaten together.)

===&quot;Shulchan Orech&quot; (the meal)===

The festive meal is eaten. Traditionally it begins with the charred egg on the Seder plate.

===&quot;Tzafun&quot; (eating of the &quot;afikoman&quot;)===

The &quot;afikoman&quot;, which was hidden earlier in the Seder, is traditionally the last morsel of food eaten by participants in the Seder.

Each participant receives an at least olive-sized portion of matzo to be eaten as &quot;afikoman&quot;. After the consumption of the &quot;afikoman&quot;, traditionally, no other food may be eaten for the rest of the night. Additionally, no intoxicating beverages may be consumed, with the exception of the remaining two cups of wine.

===&quot;Bareich&quot; (Grace after Meals)===
The recital of Birkat Hamazon.

===&quot;Kos Shlishi&quot; (the Third Cup of Wine)===
The drinking of the Third Cup of Wine.

Note: The Third Cup is customarily poured before the Grace after Meals is recited because the Third Cup also serves as a Cup of Blessing associated with the Grace after Meals on special occasions.

===&quot;Kos shel Eliyahu ha-Navi&quot; (cup of Elijah the Prophet)===
In many traditions, the front door of the house is opened at this point. Psalms 79:6–7 is recited in both Ashkenazi and Sephardi traditions, plus Lamentations 3:66 among Ashkenazim.

Most Ashkenazim have the custom to fill a fifth cup at this point. This relates to a Talmudic discussion that concerns the number of cups that are supposed to be drunk. Given that the four cups are in reference to the four expressions of redemption in Exodus 6:6–7, some rabbis felt that it was important to include a fifth cup for the fifth expression of redemption in Exodus 6:8. All agreed that five cups should be poured but the question as to whether or not the fifth should be drunk, given that the fifth expression of redemption concerned being brought into the Land of Israel, which—by this stage—was no longer possessed of an autonomous Jewish community, remained insoluble. The rabbis determined that the matter should be left until Elijah comes (in reference to the notion that Elijah&#x27;s arrival would precipitate the coming of the Messiah, at which time all halakhic questions will be resolved) and the fifth cup came to be known as the &quot;Kos shel Eliyahu&quot; (&quot;Cup of Elijah&quot;). Over time, people came to relate this cup to the notion that Elijah will visit each home on Seder night as a foreshadowing of his future arrival at the end of the days, when he will come to announce the coming of the Jewish Messiah.

In the late 1980s, Jewish feminists introduced the idea of placing a &quot;Cup of Miriam&quot; filled with water (to represent the well that existed as long as Miriam, Moses&#x27; sister, was alive in the desert) beside the Cup of Elijah. Many liberal Jews now include this ritual at their seders as a symbol of inclusion.

===&quot;Hallel&quot; (songs of praise)===
The entire order of Hallel which is usually recited in the synagogue on Jewish holidays is also recited at the Seder table, albeit sitting down. The first two psalms, 113 and 114, are recited before the meal. The remaining psalms 115–118, are recited at this point (in the &quot;Hallel&quot; section, after &quot;Bareich&quot;). Psalm 136 (the Great Hallel) is then recited, followed by &quot;Nishmat&quot;, a portion of the morning service for Shabbat and festivals.

There are a number of opinions concerning the paragraph &quot;Yehalelukha&quot; which normally follows Hallel, and &quot;Yishtabakh&quot;, which normally follows &quot;Nishmat&quot;. Most Ashkenazim recite &quot;Yehalelukha&quot; immediately following the Hallel proper, i.e. at the end of Psalm 118, except for the concluding words. After Nishmat, they recite &quot;Yishtabakh&quot; in its entirety. Sephardim recite &quot;Yehalelukha&quot; alone after Nishmat. The minhag of the French Jews in the Middle Ages, as well as Italian Jews until fairly recently was to recite both blessings.

Afterwards the Fourth Cup of Wine is drunk and a brief Grace for the &quot;fruit of the vine&quot; is said. In some Ashkenazic communities following in the tradition of Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg, the fourth cup is not drunk until after the recitation of some of the piyyutim of Nirtzah.

===&quot;Nirtzah&quot;===

The Seder concludes with a prayer that the night&#x27;s service be accepted. A hope for the Messiah is expressed: &quot;&quot;L&#x27;Shana Haba&#x27;ah b&#x27;Yerushalayim!&quot; – Next year in Jerusalem!&quot; Jews in Israel, and especially those in Jerusalem, recite instead &quot;&quot;L&#x27;shanah haba&#x27;ah b&#x27;Yerushalayim hab&#x27;nuyah!&quot; – Next year in the rebuilt Jerusalem!&quot;

Although the 15 orders of the Seder have been completed, the Haggadah concludes with additional songs which further recount the miracles that occurred on this night in Ancient Egypt as well as throughout history. Some songs express a prayer that the Beit Hamikdash will soon be rebuilt. The last song to be sung is &quot;Chad Gadya&quot; (&quot;One Kid [young goat]&quot;). This seemingly childish song about different animals and people who attempted to punish others for their crimes and were in turn punished themselves, was interpreted by the Vilna Gaon as an allegory of the retribution God will levy over the enemies of the Jewish people at the end of days.

Following the Seder, those who are still awake may recite the Song of Songs, engage in Torah learning, or continue talking about the events of the Exodus until sleep overtakes them.

<text>The , located in Ise, Mie Prefecture of Japan, is a Shinto shrine dedicated to the solar goddess Amaterasu Ōmikami and the grain goddess Toyouke-hime (Toyouke Omikami). Also known simply as , Ise Shrine is a shrine complex composed of many Shinto shrines centered on two main shrines, and .

The Inner Shrine, Naikū (also officially known as &quot;Kōtai Jingū&quot;), is dedicated to the worship of Amaterasu and is located in the town of Uji-tachi, south of central Ise, where she is believed to dwell. The shrine buildings are made of solid cypress wood and use no nails but instead joined wood. The Outer Shrine, &quot;Gekū&quot; (also officially known as &quot;Toyouke Daijingū&quot;), is located about six kilometers from Naikū and dedicated to Toyouke-Ōmikami, the god of agriculture, rice harvest and industry. Besides Naikū and Gekū, there are an additional 123 Shinto shrines in Ise City and the surrounding areas, 91 of them connected to Naikū and 32 to Gekū.

Purportedly the home of the Sacred Mirror, the shrine is one of Shinto&#x27;s holiest and most important sites. Access to both sites is strictly limited, with the general public not allowed beyond sight of the thatched roofs of the central structures, hidden behind four tall wooden fences. However, visitors are free to roam the forest, including its ornamental walkways which date back to the Meiji period.

During the Edo period, it is estimated that one out of ten Japanese conducted an &quot;Okage Mairi&quot; pilgrimage to the shrine. Accordingly, pilgrimage to the shrine flourished in both commercial and religious frequency. According to historical documents, 3.62 million people visited the shrine in 50 days in 1625, and 1.18 million people visited the shrine in three days in 1829 when the grand festival held every 20 years was held. Because the shrine is considered sanctuary, no security checkpoints were conducted, as it was considered sacrilege by the faithful. The two main shrines of Ise are joined by a pilgrimage road that passes through the old entertainment district of Furuichi.

The chief priest or priestess of Ise Shrine must be related to the Imperial House of Japan and is responsible for watching over the Shrine. The current High Priestess of the shrine is the daughter of Emperor Emeritus Akihito, former Princess Sayako Kuroda.

== Establishment of the Shrine ==
According to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, around 2000 years ago the divine Yamatohime-no-mikoto, daughter of the Emperor Suinin, set out from Mt. Miwa in modern Nara Prefecture in search of a permanent location to worship the goddess Amaterasu, wandering for 20 years through the regions of Omi and Mino. Her search eventually brought her to Ise, in modern Mie Prefecture, where she is said to have established Naikū after hearing the voice of Amaterasu saying &quot;(Ise) is a secluded and pleasant land. In this land I wish to dwell.&quot; Before Yamatohime-no-mikoto&#x27;s journey, Amaterasu had been worshiped at the imperial residence in Yamato, then briefly at Kasanui in the eastern Nara basin. When Princess Yamatohime-no-mikoto arrived at the village of Uji-tachi, she set up fifty bells to designate the area as enshrined for the goddess Amaterasu, which is why the river is called the Isuzu, or &quot;fifty bells&quot;.

Geku was founded after Emperor Yuryaku dreamt that he saw Amaterasu. She said she was unable to get food and asked him to bring Toyouke-hime from Tanba help her with food.
Besides the traditional establishment date of 4 BC, other dates of the 3rd and 5th centuries have been put forward for the establishment of Naikū and Gekū respectively. The first shrine building at Naikū was erected by Emperor Tenmu (678–686), with the first ceremonial rebuilding being carried out by his wife, Empress Jitō, in 692.

The shrine was foremost among a group of shrines which became objects of imperial patronage in the early Heian period. In 965, Emperor Murakami ordered imperial messengers to be sent to report important events to the guardian kami of Japan. These &quot;heihaku&quot; were initially presented to 16 shrines including the Ise Shrine.

== Chief priestess / chief priest ==

From the late 7th century until the 14th century, the role of chief priestess of Ise Shrine was carried out by a female member of the Imperial House of Japan known as a Saiō. According to the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, the first saiō to serve at the shrine was Princess Ōku, daughter of Emperor Tenmu, during the Asuka period. Mention of Ise Shrine&#x27;s saiō is also made in the Aoi, Sakaki and Yugao chapters of &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; as well as in the 69th chapter of &quot;The Tales of Ise&quot;. The saiō system ended during the turmoil of the Nanboku-chō period.

During the Empire of Japan and the establishment of State Shinto, the position of chief priest of the Ise Shrine was fulfilled by the reigning emperor and the Meiji, Taisho and Shōwa Emperors all played the role of chief priest during their reigns.

Since the disestablishment of State Shinto during the Occupation of Japan, the offices of chief priest and most sacred priestess have been held by former members of the imperial family or their descendants. The current chief priest of the shrine is , adoptive son of Takatsukasa Kazuko. He succeeded Kitashirakawa Michihisa, a great-grandson of Emperor Meiji, in 2007. Takatsukasa Kazuko was succeeded by her younger sister, Ikeda Atsuko. In 2012, Ikeda was joined by her niece Sayako Kuroda, sole daughter of Emperor Akihito, to serve as a high priestess under her. On 19 June 2017, Sayako officially replaced her aunt as supreme priestess.

== Shrine architecture ==

The architectural style of the Ise shrine is known as &quot;shinmei-zukuri&quot;, characterized by extreme simplicity and antiquity; its basic principles date back to the Kofun period (250–538 C.E.). The shrine buildings use a special variant of this style called , which may not be used in the construction of any other shrine. &quot;Yuitsu-shinmei-zukuri&quot; style replicates the architectural features of early rice granaries. The old shrines are dismantled and new ones built on an adjacent site to exacting specifications every 20 years at exorbitant expense, so that the buildings will be forever new and forever ancient and original. The present buildings, dating from 2013, are the 62nd iteration to date and are scheduled for rebuilding in 2033.
The shrine at Naikū is constructed of Japanese cypress. Built on pillars set directly in the ground, the shrine building measures 10.9 by 5.5 meters and includes a raised floor, verandas all the way around the building and a staircase leading to a single central doorway. The Naikū does not have any windows. The roof is made of thatched reed with ten billets (&quot;katsuogi&quot;) located on the ridge of the roof, the bargeboards of which project beyond the roof to form the distinctive forked finials (&quot;chigi&quot;) at the ends of the ridge. The &quot;chigi&quot; on the roof of the Naikū are flat on top, rather than pointed, which serves as a distinction for the gender of the deity being represented. In the case of Ise, Amaterasu, a female deity, is represented at the shrine, which is why the &quot;chigi&quot; are flat. The roof ridge is supported by two free-standing columns called the &quot;munamochi-bashira&quot;. The &quot;katsuogi&quot;, &quot;chigi&quot; and &quot;munamochi-bashira&quot; are stylised forms of older storehouse building techniques that pre-date the introduction of Buddhist architecture in Japan.

The empty site beside the shrine building, the site where the previous shrine once stood and where the next will be built, is called the &quot;kodenchi&quot;. This area is strewn with large white pebbles and is left totally empty apart from the &quot;oi-ya&quot;, a small wooden hut containing a wooden pole a little over 2 metres in height called the &quot;shin-no-mihashira&quot; (new sacred central pole). When a new shrine is built, it is built around the sacred central pole before the removal of the oi-ya, so that the central pole is never seen. The central pole of the old shrine will then have a new &quot;oi-ya&quot; erected so that the &quot;shin-no-mihashira&quot; also remains unseen.
== Rebuilding the Shrine ==
The shrine buildings at Naikū and Gekū, as well as the Uji Bridge, are rebuilt every 20 years as a part of the Shinto belief in &quot;tokowaka&quot; (常若), which means renewing objects to maintain a strong sense of divine prestige in pursuit of eternity, and as a way of passing building techniques from one generation to the next. The twenty-year renewal process is called the Shikinen Sengū. Although the goal of Sengū is to get the shrine built within the 20-year period, there have been some instances, especially because of war, where the shrine building process is postponed or delayed. The original physical purpose of the Sengu process is unknown. However, it is believed that it serves to maintain the longevity of the shrine, or possibly as a gesture to the deity enclosed within the shrine. Historically, this cyclical reconstruction has been practiced for many years in various shrines throughout Japan, meaning that it is not a process exclusive to Ise. The entire reconstruction process takes more or less 17 years, with the initial years focusing on project organization and general planning, and the last 8 years focusing on the physical construction of the shrine.

The shrine has evolved throughout the years in its reconstruction, while maintaining some of its key features. The shrine was not originally constructed with gold copper adornments; however, because of advancements in technology as well as Buddhist influence, it gained them over the years. Another example of Buddhist influence on the shrine is the use of &quot;Suedama&quot;, which are Buddhist orbs seen on various religious structures. It symbolizes a sacred jewel, and is comparable to &quot;nyoi-shu&quot;, orbs which many Buddhist figures are displayed holding. Initially, the shrine was constructed of locally sourced Hinoki wood, which served as an ideal building material due to its physical properties. The abundance of local Hinoki wood was short lived, and the shrine currently obtains the wood through other domestic producers, who ensure that only the best wood is being used for the construction. Before the wood is usable in building the shrine, it must be put through a lengthy seasoning and drying process where it is in a pond for several years and then dried.

The team which builds the shrine is typically formed around a few factors. Since many of the building techniques haven&#x27;t changed since the creation of the Ise Shrine, the workers who are hired to build the shrine must be skilled in specific techniques. Power tools are not allowed within the area of the shrine, which means that skilled artisans and carpenters known as &quot;miyadaiku&quot; are necessary in the construction process. The unit of workers is also organized around relative skill levels, and less experienced workers will work on smaller tasks than more experienced workers. The importance of hiring specifically local artisans has decreased throughout time, for the pool of available miyadaiku has thinned out. Specialized work and the specific materials come with a cost; in 2013, the shrine was built from private donations alone, totaling 57 billion Japanese Yen (US$550 million).
In August, in a long-standing tradition, the people who live in Ise are allowed to enter the area around the Inner Sanctum of the Naiku as well as the Geku. Some villages drag a wooden carriage laden with white stones up the Isuzu River onto the grounds of the Naiku. Each participant gets two white stones in a white handkerchief and these allow them to place the stones in the area around the Inner Sanctum. Other villages drag a huge wooden cart or Noburi Kuruma laden with white stones to the Uji bridge at the entrance of the grounds of the Naiku. Participants receive two white stones which are also placed in the sacred space around the Inner Sanctum. The entire tradition is called Shiraisshiki and it is very colourful with every participant wearing a happi coat representing a particular village. The rebuilding of the main shrine takes place on a site adjacent to the old, and each rebuilding alternates between the two sites. The next scheduled rebuilding of Naikū is due in 2033 on the lower, northern site. Various other religious ceremonies are held with the completion of the shrine, each serving different purposes.

In the lead-up to the rebuilding of the shrines, a number of festivals are held to mark special events. The Okihiki Festival is held in the spring over two consecutive years and involves people from surrounding towns dragging huge wooden logs through the streets of Ise to Naikū and Gekū. In the lead-up to the 2013 rebuilding, the Okihiki festival was held in 2006 and 2007. A year after the completion of the Okihiki festival, carpenters begin preparing the wood for its eventual use in the Shrine.

== Annual festivals ==

From the late seventh century, when the festivals and offerings of Ise Shrine became more formalised, a number of annual events have been performed at both Naikū and Gekū. The Tsukinamisai, which was held in June and December, as well as the Kannamesai Festival in September, were the only three offerings performed by the Saiō, an imperial princess who served as high priestess of the shrine until the 14th century. These offerings are based on the cycle of the agricultural year and are still performed today.

The first important ceremony of the modern calendar year is the Kinen-sai, where prayers are offered for a bountiful harvest. Kazahinomisai, where prayers for fair weather and sufficient rains are made, is held twice a year in May and August at both Naikū and Gekū.

The most important annual festival held at Ise Shrine is the . Held in October each year, this ritual makes offerings of the first harvest of crops for the season to Amaterasu. An imperial envoy carries the offering of rice harvested by the Emperor himself to Ise, as well as five-coloured silk cloth and other materials, called &quot;heihaku.&quot;

Besides the agricultural ceremonies already mentioned, ceremonies and festivals are held throughout the year at both Naikū and Gekū to celebrate things such as the new year, the foundation of Japan, the past emperors, purification rituals for priests and court musicians, good sake fermentation and the Emperor&#x27;s birthday. There are also daily food offerings to the shrine kami held both in the mornings and evenings.

== Gekū – the outer shrine ==
 is a shrine to Toyoukebime, the food goddess, located in Ise Grand Shrine. it is also colloquially known as . In pilgrimage customs people traditionally visit this shrine first and then Kotai jingu which is located 4 km to the south

The shrine was founded after Emperor Yuryaku dreamt that he saw Amaterasu. She said she was unable to get food and asked him to bring Toyouke-hime from Tanba help her with food.

=== Daiichi-torii-guchi Sando ===
Daiichi-torii-guchi Sando is the primary route into the shrine. It is a Sandō that starts at the Hiyokebashi bridge entrance, and beyond this bridge, the Temizusha (ablution font) is visible on the left side.

=== Temizusha ===
A Temizusha is present at the shrine for worshippers to purify .

=== Kitamikado-guchi Sando ===
An alternative entrance path for the shrine.

=== Saikan and Anzaisho ===
Saikan and Anzaisho are the Purification Hall and Hall for Imperial Household Visitors respectively. They are on the right side of the pilgrimage path. The Saikan, which is surrounded by fences, is used by Shinto priests to purify themselves. They stay here for one or two nights to cleanse their minds from worldly concerns before performing rituals, as they bathe and eat meals prepared with sacred fire to achieve spiritual serenity; adjacent to Saikan, there is a building called Anzaisho, which serves as the Hall for the Emperor and Empress.

=== Kaguraden ===
There is a large Kaguraden at Geku.

=== Honden ===
Toyouke Omikami is enshrined at the Honden. It lies in the most sacred area enclosed by four rows of fences, and the structure remains unchanged from 1500 years ago. Worshippers can only approach the first gate.

=== History ===
In Japanese mythology Toyouke-hime was either killed by Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto or by Susanoo-no-Mikoto. Amaterasu mourned the death of her and in the Nihon Shoki the reason the sun and the moon are on opposite sides of the sky is that Amaterasu was unwilling to go near Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto the moon god after he committed the murder. Amaterasu is linked with Toyouke-hime as the sun is necessary for food to grow. This was prior to the Tenson Korin and the establishment of Ise Jingu. Emperor Suinin is said to have established the shrine to worship Amaterasu at a permanent location after many temporary locations. In contrast with , this shrine is not explicitly mentioned in the Kojiki or the Nihon Shoki.

Besides the traditional establishment date of 4 BC, it has also been proposed as having been made in the 5th century. The shrine officially states it was created 1500 years ago in response to a revelation from Amaterasu that the shrine was needed.

The shrine has been traditionally rebuilt every 20 years.

There is a separate shrine dedicated to Toyouke&#x27;s Ara-mitama, or called (Takamiya) inside this shrine.

== Naikū – the inner shrine ==

The official name of the main shrine of Naikū is Kotaijingu and is the place of worship of the goddess Amaterasu. The grounds of Naikū contain a number of structures, including the following:

=== The Uji Bridge ===

This 100 meter wooden bridge, built in a traditional Japanese style, stretches across the Isuzu River at the entrance of Naikū. Like the shrine buildings of Naikū, it is rebuilt every 20 years as a part of the Shikinen Sengū ceremony. The bridge is typically built by carpenters with less experience to gain more skills before moving on to take on the task of working on the main shrine. On crossing the bridge, the path turns to the right along the banks of the Isuzu river and passes through large landscaped gardens.

=== Temizusha ===

After crossing a short, wide bridge, pilgrims to the shrine encounter the Temizusha, a small, roofed structure containing a pool of water for use in ritual purification. Visitors are encouraged to wash their hands and rinse their mouths at Temizusha as a symbolic act to clean the mind and body of impurity. The first of two large torii gates stands just beyond the Temizusha.

=== Saikan and Anzaisho ===
After passing the first large torii gate, the Purification Hall (Saikan), and the hall for visitors from the imperial household (Anzaisho) is located to the left. The Saikan is used by shrine priests to purify themselves before performing ceremonies at the shrine. They are required to spend one or two nights to free their minds of worldly issues, partaking in baths and eating meals cooked with the sacred fire.

=== Kaguraden ===

This hall for special prayer, located just after the second large torii gate, is open to the public for the offering of individual prayers to the kami, the giving of donations and the purchase of special talisman of protection, amulets and hanging scrolls of Amaterasu Omikami.
=== Imibiyaden ===

This hall contains the sacred fire used to cook all of the food offerings to the kami of Ise Shrine. Rice and other offerings cooked on the sacred fire are stored in a box made of Japanese cypress, then purified at the Haraedo immediately in front of the Imibiyaden before being offered to the kami.

=== Kōtai Jingū – the main shrine ===
The pilgrimage path then approaches the fence of the inner sanctum (昇殿, shōden) of Naikū by a set of large stone steps. Within another set of fencing inside the gate is the main shrine (正宮, seigū) itself. Visitors are supposed to keep to the sides of the path as the middle is set aside for the goddess Amaterasu. Etiquette is the same as for most Shinto shrines. Though the actual shrine is hidden behind a large fence, pilgrims can approach the gate to offer their prayers. Photographs in this area are prohibited and this restriction is strictly policed.

Kotai Jingū is said to hold the Sacred Mirror, one of three Imperial Regalia of Japan said to have been given to the first Emperor by the gods. From a path that follows the line of the outer wall, the distinctive roof of the shrine building can be seen through the trees. In front of the walled shrine compound can be seen an open area which was the location of the rebuilding of the shrine in 2013.

== Pilgrimage at Ise ==

The pilgrimage to the Ise shrine, also known as &quot;Sangū&quot;, gained immense popularity during the Edo Period, where hundreds of thousands of pilgrims would travel there every year. The growth was exponential, 5 million pilgrims visiting the shrine in the year 1830 alone. By the late 19th century, tourists from abroad began to visit and document Ise. The popularity of making a trip to Ise resulted in vast networks and groups of travelers, which ultimately led to businesses working to benefit from this influx of interest for the shrine. Travel guidebooks were made to aid travelers in their navigation, as well to let them know of specific important places to visit while at Ise. They also included woodblock prints of the shrine that were very appealing to those who had made the long trek to the shrine. Additionally, people wanted souvenirs, which resulted in a variety of vendors at Ise selling general goods and specialty items. There were also various post stations which had specific gifts, many of which were woodblock prints. The pilgrimage had multiple purposes and appeals. It was seen as a purification process, and by visiting Ise, pilgrims were purified and aided in receiving a good afterlife. It also was seen as a vacation, the journey to the shrine itself being almost as important as actually getting there. In the 21st century, Ise is still an important destination both to foreign tourists and especially to the Japanese community; 9 million Japanese tourists visited the shrine in 2013.

<text>Dolph Briscoe Jr. (April 23, 1923 – June 27, 2010) was an American rancher and businessman from Uvalde, Texas, who was the 41st governor of Texas between 1973 and 1979. He was a member of the Democratic Party.

Because of his re-election following an amendment to the Texas Constitution doubling the Governor&#x27;s term to four years, Briscoe became both the last governor to serve a two-year term and the first to serve a four-year term.

A lifelong resident of Uvalde, Briscoe was first elected to the Texas Legislature in 1948 and served as a state representative from 1949 to 1957. As part of the reform movement in state politics stemming from the Sharpstown scandal, Briscoe won election as governor in 1972. During his six years as governor, Briscoe presided during a period of reform in state government as Texas&#x27;s population and commerce boomed.

Following his two terms as governor, Briscoe returned to the ranching and banking business in Uvalde. He is recognized as having been one of the leading citizens of the state and a benevolent supporter of many civic, cultural, and educational institutions in Texas and the nation. Most recently before his death the former Texas governor established the Dolph and Janey Briscoe Fund for Texas History at the University of Texas at Austin.

He was the last Democratic Texan to be re-elected to the Governor&#x27;s Mansion with his reelection landslide victory in 1974; fellow Democratic governors Mark White and Ann Richards lost their re-election bids respectively, in 1986 and 1994.

==Early years==
Dolph Briscoe Jr., was born on April 23, 1923, the only child of Dolph Sr. and Georgie Briscoe in Uvalde, Texas. His father was a descendant of Texas Declaration of Independence signer Andrew Briscoe. Briscoe was first attracted to politics at an early age. Thanks to his father&#x27;s friendship with Governor Ross Sterling, the young Briscoe traveled to Austin and the Texas Governor&#x27;s Mansion in 1932. At the age of nine, Governor Sterling invited Briscoe to stay at the mansion and sleep in Sam Houston&#x27;s bed.

After graduation from Uvalde High School as valedictorian, Briscoe attended the University of Texas at Austin. He was active in many campus organizations, including the Friar Society, the Texas Cowboys, Chi Phi fraternity, and was editor of &quot;The Cactus&quot; yearbook. While at the university, he met fellow student Betty Jane &quot;Janey&quot; Slaughter (1923 – 2000) of Austin. They married in 1942 and had three children.

After graduation from the University of Texas in 1943 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, Briscoe enlisted as a private in the United States Army. He served in the China Burma India Theater during World War II and advanced in rank to become an officer.

==Political career==
When Briscoe returned from military service, he returned home to Uvalde and the ranching business. He soon rekindled his interest in politics. Briscoe counted Vice President John Nance Garner, President Lyndon Baines Johnson, House Speaker Sam Rayburn, and Governor Sterling as his political mentors.

Briscoe&#x27;s first step into elective politics began with a race for state representative in the Texas House of Representatives in 1948. He won his first election and was re-elected in 1950, 1952 and 1954 and served from 1949 to 1957. He became best known as the co-author of the Colson-Briscoe Act, which appropriated funding for the state&#x27;s farm-to-market road system.

==1968 campaign for Governor==
In 1968, Briscoe attempted to reenter the political arena, when he joined a list of candidates seeking to replace retiring Texas Gov. John Connally, who chose not to seek a fourth term. Briscoe finished fourth in the Democratic gubernatorial primary that year.

There was a runoff between the more liberal contender, Don Yarborough of Houston (no relation to U.S. Senator Ralph Yarborough), and Lieutenant Governor Preston Smith of Lubbock. Smith won the runoff and then defeated Republican Paul Eggers by a margin of 57 percent to 43 percent in the November general election and was subsequently re-elected defeating Eggers in their 1970 rematch, 53 percent to 46 percent.

==Governorship==
Briscoe was inaugurated as the forty-first governor of Texas on January 16, 1973.

During his two terms as governor, Briscoe balanced increasing demands for more state services and a rapidly growing population. As the governor elected during a period of social unrest and skepticism about the motives of elected officials, he helped restore integrity to a state government fallen into disgrace as a result of the Sharpstown scandals. Briscoe&#x27;s terms as governor led to a landmark events and achievements, including the most extensive ethics and financial disclosure bill in state history, passage of the Open Meetings and Open Records legislation, and strengthened laws regulating lobbyists. Briscoe also presided over the first revision of the state&#x27;s penal code in one hundred years.

Briscoe added $4 billion in new state funds for public education and higher education, increased teacher salaries by the highest percentage in history, and raised salaries for state employees as well. He expanded services to handicapped Texans by the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, and established the first toll-free hotline for runaway children. He appointed a larger number of women and minorities to positions in Texas state government than any previous governor, appointed the first African American members to state boards, and named the first African American district judge. No new state taxes were passed during Briscoe&#x27;s terms as governor, making him the first governor since World War II to hold the line on both new state taxes or increasing existing ones.

As governor, he focused on the maintenance and efficiency of existing government agencies as opposed to the creation of new ones. As a veteran rancher, Briscoe also worked to help the farmers and ranchers of the state during his tenure. This included the eradication of the screw worm on both sides of the Rio Grande.

Dolph Briscoe also advocated a reduction of the state speed limit to 55 mph in the aftermath of the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo. The Texas Highway Commission voted 3-0 in favor of his recommendation on December 4, 1973. The measure was overturned in the Texas Supreme Court two days later. Briscoe, along with the Texas legislature adopted the 55 mph speed limit passed by congress in January 1974.

Briscoe ran for a third term in 1978, but lost to then-Texas Attorney General John Luke Hill in the 1978 Democratic primary. Hill would go on to narrowly lose to businessman Bill Clements in the general election, marking the first time the Democratic Party had lost the Texas governorship since Reconstruction.

==Philanthropy==

The former governor was also active in the philanthropic community, having given several million dollars to various Texas institutions, mostly centered in and around the San Antonio area. In 2006, he gave a sizeable gift to the Witte Museum, a local gallery which features exhibits specifically geared towards Children. In 2008 he donated $5 million to the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio in support of cardiology research and women&#x27;s health. This gift was made in honor of his late wife, Janey. Also, that year, he donated $15 million to the Center for American History, which was subsequently renamed the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History and for which he served on the Advisory Council. The Briscoe Center holds the Briscoe Papers, which include his gubernatorial records as well as Briscoe family business records.

In June 2008, Briscoe donated $1.2 million in memory of his late granddaughter, Kate Marmion, to found the Kate Marmion Regional Cancer Medical Center. The CMC will serve patients of southwest Texas counties (Uvalde, Real, Zavala, Edwards, Medina, Maverick, Val Verde, Dimmit and Kinney) who otherwise would have to drive to San Antonio for radiation therapy.

==Death==
Briscoe died on the evening of June 27, 2010 at his home in Uvalde, Texas following complications of heart and kidney failure at the age of 87. A public viewing for the former Texas Governor was held at the Rushing-Estes-Knowles Funeral Home chapel on Wednesday, June 30, 2010 and funeral services were held at the Saint Phillip&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Uvalde on July 1, 2010 where thousands of mourners including former Governor Mark White, then-Governor Rick Perry, then-Railroad Commissioner Elizabeth Ames Jones, former Houston Mayor Bill White and others attended the service. He was buried at the Briscoe Rio Frio Ranch Cemetery at the family ranch next to his wife.

In 2011, the Garner Museum in Uvalde, part of the Briscoe Center of American History at the University of Texas at Austin, was renamed the Briscoe-Garner Museum, and the second floor converted for commemoration of Briscoe&#x27;s life and career.
