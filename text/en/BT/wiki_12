<text>The Faces of Janus is a book by A. James Gregor, a eugenicist and political scientist with a focus on fascism, published in 2000 by Yale University Press. In it, he argues that there are fundamental errors in Marxist analyses of fascism and that the political spectrum identifying the Left as progressive and the Right as reactionary was (in the words of Franklin Hugh Adler) a dishonest way of &quot;privileging purported movements of the Left and demonizing movements of the Right&quot;.

Reviewer Harry V. Willems of the Southeast Kansas Library System writes: &quot;Gregor [...] takes issue with 20th-century historians who make fascism and communism the opposing faces of Janus. [...] Gregor is the first to use Marxist theory systematically to bend the political spectrum from a linear to a circular form. That is, fascism and communism meld into each other. Fascism had its origins in communism, and communism exhibited facets of fascism from its inception.&quot;

In a review for the &quot;Journal of Libertarian Studies&quot;, Hunt Tooley of Austin College described Gregor&#x27;s book as &quot;an outstanding work of careful scholarship which speaks directly to issues long of interest to students of liberty.&quot;

<doc id="564361" wikidata="Q2642668" url="?curid=564361" title="Site-directed mutagenesis">
<text>Site-directed mutagenesis is a molecular biology method that is used to make specific and intentional mutating changes to the DNA sequence of a gene and any gene products. Also called site-specific mutagenesis or oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, it is used for investigating the structure and biological activity of DNA, RNA, and protein molecules, and for protein engineering.

Site-directed mutagenesis is one of the most important laboratory techniques for creating DNA libraries by introducing mutations into DNA sequences. There are numerous methods for achieving site-directed mutagenesis, but with decreasing costs of oligonucleotide synthesis, artificial gene synthesis is now occasionally used as an alternative to site-directed mutagenesis. Since 2013, the development of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, based on a prokaryotic viral defense system, has also allowed for the editing of the genome, and mutagenesis may be performed &quot;in vivo&quot; with relative ease.

==History==
Early attempts at mutagenesis using radiation or chemical mutagens were non-site-specific, generating random mutations. Analogs of nucleotides and other chemicals were later used to generate localized point mutations, examples of such chemicals are aminopurine, nitrosoguanidine, and bisulfite. Site-directed mutagenesis was achieved in 1974 in the laboratory of Charles Weissmann using a nucleotide analogue N4-hydroxycytidine, which induces transition of GC to AT. These methods of mutagenesis, however, are limited by the kind of mutation they can achieve, and they are not as specific as later site-directed mutagenesis methods.

In 1971, Clyde Hutchison and Marshall Edgell showed that it is possible to produce mutants with small fragments of phage ΦX174 and restriction nucleases. Hutchison later produced with his collaborator Michael Smith in 1978 a more flexible approach to site-directed mutagenesis by using oligonucleotides in a primer extension method with DNA polymerase. For his part in the development of this process, Michael Smith later shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in October 1993 with Kary B. Mullis, who invented polymerase chain reaction.

==Basic mechanism==
The basic procedure requires the synthesis of a short DNA primer. This synthetic primer contains the desired mutation and is complementary to the template DNA around the mutation site so it can hybridize with the DNA in the gene of interest. The mutation may be a single base change (a point mutation), multiple base changes, deletion, or insertion. The single-strand primer is then extended using a DNA polymerase, which copies the rest of the gene. The gene thus copied contains the mutated site, and is then introduced into a host cell in a vector and cloned. Finally, mutants are selected by DNA sequencing to check that they contain the desired mutation.

==Approaches==

The original method using single-primer extension was inefficient due to a low yield of mutants. This resulting mixture contains both the original unmutated template as well as the mutant strand, producing a mixed population of mutant and non-mutant progenies. Furthermore, the template used is methylated while the mutant strand is unmethylated, and the mutants may be counter-selected due to presence of mismatch repair system that favors the methylated template DNA, resulting in fewer mutants. Many approaches have since been developed to improve the efficiency of mutagenesis.

A large number of methods are available to effect site-directed mutagenesis, although most of them have rarely been used in laboratories since the early 2000s, as newer techniques allow for simpler and easier ways of introducing site-specific mutation into genes.

=== Kunkel&#x27;s method ===
In 1985, Thomas Kunkel introduced a technique that reduces the need to select for the mutants. The DNA fragment to be mutated is inserted into a phagemid such as M13mp18/19 and is then transformed into an &quot;E. coli&quot; strain deficient in two enzymes, dUTPase (&quot;dut&quot;) and uracil deglycosidase (&quot;udg&quot;). Both enzymes are part of a DNA repair pathway that protects the bacterial chromosome from mutations by the spontaneous deamination of dCTP to dUTP. The dUTPase deficiency prevents the breakdown of dUTP, resulting in a high level of dUTP in the cell. The uracil deglycosidase deficiency prevents the removal of uracil from newly synthesized DNA. As the double-mutant &quot;E. coli&quot; replicates the phage DNA, its enzymatic machinery may, therefore, misincorporate dUTP instead of dTTP, resulting in single-strand DNA that contains some uracils (ssUDNA). The ssUDNA is extracted from the bacteriophage that is released into the medium, and then used as template for mutagenesis. An oligonucleotide containing the desired mutation is used for primer extension. The heteroduplex DNA, that forms, consists of one parental non-mutated strand containing dUTP and a mutated strand containing dTTP. The DNA is then transformed into an E. coli strain carrying the wildtype &quot;dut&quot; and &quot;udg&quot; genes. Here, the uracil-containing parental DNA strand is degraded, so that nearly all of the resulting DNA consists of the mutated strand.

=== Cassette mutagenesis===
Unlike other methods, cassette mutagenesis need not involve primer extension using DNA polymerase. In this method, a fragment of DNA is synthesized, and then inserted into a plasmid. It involves the cleavage by a restriction enzyme at a site in the plasmid and subsequent ligation of a pair of complementary oligonucleotides containing the mutation in the gene of interest to the plasmid. Usually, the restriction enzymes that cut at the plasmid and the oligonucleotide are the same, permitting sticky ends of the plasmid and insert to ligate to one another. This method can generate mutants at close to 100% efficiency, but is limited by the availability of suitable restriction sites flanking the site that is to be mutated.

===PCR site-directed mutagenesis===
The limitation of restriction sites in cassette mutagenesis may be overcome using polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide &quot;primers&quot;, such that a larger fragment may be generated, covering two convenient restriction sites. The exponential amplification in PCR produces a fragment containing the desired mutation in sufficient quantity to be separated from the original, unmutated plasmid by gel electrophoresis, which may then be inserted in the original context using standard recombinant molecular biology techniques. There are many variations of the same technique. The simplest method places the mutation site toward one of the ends of the fragment whereby one of two oligonucleotides used for generating the fragment contains the mutation. This involves a single step of PCR, but still has the inherent problem of requiring a suitable restriction site near the mutation site unless a very long primer is used. Other variations, therefore, employ three or four oligonucleotides, two of which may be non-mutagenic oligonucleotides that cover two convenient restriction sites and generate a fragment that can be digested and ligated into a plasmid, whereas the mutagenic oligonucleotide may be complementary to a location within that fragment well away from any convenient restriction site. These methods require multiple steps of PCR so that the final fragment to be ligated can contain the desired mutation. The design process for generating a fragment with the desired mutation and relevant restriction sites can be cumbersome. Software tools like SDM-Assist can simplify the process.

===Whole plasmid mutagenesis===
For plasmid manipulations, other site-directed mutagenesis techniques have been supplanted largely by techniques that are highly efficient but relatively simple, easy to use, and commercially available as a kit. An example of these techniques is the &quot;Quikchange&quot; method, wherein a pair of complementary mutagenic primers are used to amplify the entire plasmid in a thermocycling reaction using a high-fidelity non-strand-displacing DNA polymerase such as &quot;Pfu&quot; polymerase. The reaction generates a nicked, circular DNA. The template DNA must be eliminated by enzymatic digestion with a restriction enzyme such as &quot;Dpn&quot;I, which is specific for methylated DNA. All DNA produced from most &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; strains would be methylated; the template plasmid that is biosynthesized in &quot;E. coli&quot; will, therefore, be digested, while the mutated plasmid, which is generated &quot;in vitro&quot; and is therefore unmethylated, would be left undigested. Note that, in these double-strand plasmid mutagenesis methods, while the thermocycling reaction may be used, the DNA is not exponentially amplified if the two primers are designed such that they bind symmetrically to the same region around the mutagenesis site, as described in the original protocol. In this case the amplification is linear, and it is therefore inaccurate to describe the procedure as a PCR, since there is no chain reaction. However, if the primers are designed to bind in an offset manner such that mutagenesis site is close to the 5&#x27; end of both primers, the 3&#x27; region of the primers can bind also to the amplified products and thus exponential product formation is observed. The name &quot;Quikchange&quot; originates from the registered trademark &quot;QuikChange mutagenesis&quot; of Stratagene, now Agilent Technologies , for site directed mutagenesis kits. The method was developed by scientists working at Stratagene.

Note that &quot;Pfu&quot; polymerase can become strand-displacing at higher extension temperature (≥70 °C) which can result in the failure of the experiment, therefore the extension reaction should be performed at the recommended temperature of 68 °C. In some applications, this method has been observed to lead to insertion of multiple copies of primers. A variation of this method, called SPRINP, prevents this artifact and has been used in different types of site directed mutagenesis.

Other techniques such as scanning mutagenesis of oligo-directed targets (SMOOT) can semi-randomly combine mutagenic oligonucleotides in plasmid mutagenesis. This technique can create plasmid mutagenesis libraries ranging from single mutations to comprehensive codon mutagenesis across an entire gene.

=== CRISPR ===

Since 2013, the development of CRISPR-Cas9 technology has allowed for the efficient introduction of various mutations into the genome of a wide variety of organisms. The method does not require a transposon insertion site, leaves no marker, and its efficiency and simplicity has made it the preferred method for genome editing.

==Applications==
Site-directed mutagenesis is used to generate mutations that may produce a rationally designed protein that has improved or special properties (i.e.protein engineering).

Investigative tools – specific mutations in DNA allow the function and properties of a DNA sequence or a protein to be investigated in a rational approach. Furthermore, single amino-acid changes by site-directed mutagenesis in proteins can help understand the importance of post-translational modifications. For instance changing a particular serine (phosphoacceptor) to an alanine (phospho-non-acceptor) in a substrate protein blocks the attachment of a phosphate group, thereby allows the phosphorylation to be investigated. This approach has been used to uncover the phosphorylation of the protein CBP by the kinase HIPK2 Another comprehensive approach is site saturation mutagenesis where one codon or a set of codons may be substituted with all possible amino acids at the specific positions.

Commercial applications – Proteins may be engineered to produce mutant forms that are tailored for a specific application. For example, commonly used laundry detergents may contain subtilisin, whose wild-type form has a methionine that can be oxidized by bleach, significantly reducing the activity the protein in the process. This methionine may be replaced by alanine or other residues, making it resistant to oxidation thereby keeping the protein active in the presence of bleach.

== Gene synthesis ==

As the cost of DNA oligonucleotides synthesis falls, artificial synthesis of a complete gene is now a viable method for introducing mutation into gene. This method allows for extensive mutagenesis over multiples sites, including the complete redesign of the codon usage of gene to optimise it for a particular organism.

<doc id="564364" wikidata="Q1887921" url="?curid=564364" title="University of Notre Dame Australia">
<text>The University of Notre Dame Australia is a public Roman Catholic university with campuses in Perth, Sydney and Broome. It was established in 1989 by the Archdiocese of Perth with early support from its founding partner and namesake the University of Notre Dame (NDUS) in the United States. It was originally proposed as a means to train teachers and nurses for the Catholic Church&#x27;s extensive school and hospital network, but has since expanded into other fields.

Its largest campus in Perth is in the port city of Fremantle where it expanded into colonial-era maritime buildings in the West End heritage area, later becoming ubiquitous with the precinct as a university town. Although controversial for its use of heritage property, its restoration work and the influx of students has formed a symbiotic relationship with the local economy, culture and tourism industry. Its campus in Sydney is divided between St Benedict&#x27;s Church on Broadway and the Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Darlinghurst. It also has a regional campus in Broome and eight clinical schools across New South Wales and Victoria.

Notre Dame&#x27;s academic activities are organised into three faculties, which are subdivided into constituent schools, centres and research divisions. In 2023, it had a total revenue of and a total expenditure of . It also enrolled 11,579 students mostly divided between Perth and Sydney. Its interstate presence allows students to transfer between the two cities and Broome throughout their studies. It also has a reciprocal agreement with the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, allowing approved students to study abroad at the other while retaining grades and without additional tuition. This includes NDUS&#x27; Global Gateways, which has campuses in Europe, Asia and Latin America.

The university crest displays open Bible at its core with the opening verse from the Gospel of John inscribed in Latin. The verse was chosen as the university motto to symbolise everything that exists beginning as an idea. The waves below the open Bible and the Commonwealth Star represent the port city of Fremantle, where the university was founded, and Australia as a nation surrounded by water. The symbols are affixed to an Oxford Blue badge over a Cambridge Blue Greek cross. The university is affiliated with the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities, the International Council of Universities of Saint Thomas Aquinas, the International Federation of Catholic Universities and St John of God Health Care.

==History==
=== Early discussions ===
Following the end of World War II in 1945, a Congregation of Holy Cross priest serving as a U.S. Navy chaplain at Naval Base Sydney was travelling between parishes to provide lectures and sermons. Cardinal Norman Gilroy, then the Archbishop of Sydney and a skeptic of secular universities, befriended the Holy Cross chaplain Father Patrick Duffy and they discussed the idea of the University of Notre Dame in the United States (NDUS) and the Congregation of Holy Cross being involved in the establishment of the first Catholic university in Australia. Father Duffy in the same year wrote a letter to the superior general of the Congregation of Holy Cross, Father Albert Cousineau, outlining its feasibility and reasons supporting it.

At the time, a fifth of the Australian population was Catholic and there was an established network of Catholic primary and secondary schools. Cardinal Gilroy believed that there was a strong appetite for a Catholic university and that it would enable the education of an &quot;elite Catholic laity that had been the glory of the church in the United States&quot;. Additionally, the archdiocese expressed openness in providing financial support and land for the university should the proposal be successful. In a report, Father Duffy included that almost all of the federal cabinet members were Catholic and noted the influence of Irish Australians in the governing structure of the country, resembling it with the Irish history of NDUS.

Following months of internal discussions, Father Cousineau and the Holy Cross&#x27; assistant provincial, Father Chris O&#x27;Toole, visited Sydney in 1946 to investigate the viability of the institution in a precursory report, outlining its opportunities and possible setbacks. While the report highlighted Australia&#x27;s existing Catholic school system and potential to increase opportunities for the Catholic faith and its members, the report had also found possible obstacles. These included the lack of universal support or enthusiasm between interstate bishops, distance between major cities, perceived competition from existing institutions and the substantial government lobbying required for support or funding. There was also the limitations of technology and issue of distance between the American institutions and Sydney, a future cause for stagnation of progress in the university&#x27;s establishment.

They concluded that while the potential for an Australian institution undertaken by the congregation existed, they should start smaller from a single faculty and the cardinal would need to lobby other bishops to raise enough funds. Additionally, existing commitments in the development of educational institutions elsewhere by the Holy Cross and NDUS limited the personnel and funding available to support the project. The Holy Cross order also sent additional personnel in the following years to evaluate the future university&#x27;s plans. This included the proposed name &quot;University of St. Mary&quot;, faculties, locations and fundraising options.

The project was pursued for a few more years and was purchased in 1948 on behalf of the Holy Cross for a future campus. Ultimately, political opposition from the press and the further stretching of Holy Cross resources due to the Korean War led to the required charter to establish the university not being acquired at the time. Despite positive reception from Pope Pius XXI and the then dominance of Catholics in the governing Labor Party&#x27;s hierarchy, non-Catholics were more sceptical of the plans. This included concerns from other religious denominations over the level of academic freedom at a denominational institution and its potential to segregate Australian society. The endeavour was abandoned some time in 1953 and the land was later leased to Warrane College.

=== Re-emergence and establishment ===
In the mid-1980s, concerns were raised by the Catholic Education Commission of Western Australia and the Archdiocese of Perth that present state universities may not be able to sufficiently train school teachers and nurses to work in the state&#x27;s Catholic education and healthcare network. This was partly due to the lack of public Catholic teaching colleges in the state found in the rest of the mainland, and their concern that the schools may eventually lose their Catholic identity. The idea of a private Catholic university again surfaced this time on the opposite side of the Australian continent.

Peter Tannock, who headed the Catholic Education Office of Western Australia, discussed these concerns with William Foley, the then Archbishop of Perth. They enlisted the help of Catholic businessperson Denis Horgan, also a childhood friend to Peter and founder of the Leeuwin Estate, who they hoped would provide financial assistance in establishing the university. Horgan, who had also previously envisioned a private university in the state, was supportive of the idea so long as the institution would provide more than just teacher education.

A planning committee with Tannock, Horgan, Foley and Michael Quinlan, a Catholic physician, was created and developed a plan for a private Catholic university with multiple sites in the state that could extend to other fields including nursing and medicine. Additionally, a feasibility study was conducted by Geoffrey Kiel, a professor from the University of Queensland, and discussions with various Catholic institutions in North America and Europe.

Father Ted Hesburgh and Father Ned Joyce, who had recently completed extensive tenures as the president and vice president of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, visited Fremantle and met with the planning committee in February 1988. They discussed the potential for involvement by the American university in the establishment of the planned institution. In the following months, members of the planning committee met with the newly appointed president, Edward Malloy, and other NDUS leaders in both Perth and Indiana. An agreement was reached for NDUS to commit in becoming involved in the development and governing body of the university, provide on-going guidance and staff and student exchanges.

Increasing the confidence of the state government of Western Australia in the feasibility of the institution, the proposal received support from both the WA Labor premier Peter Dowding and Liberal opposition leader Barry MacKinnon paving the way for obtaining a charter for establishment. Prior to state legislation, the decision to name the planned university &quot;The University of Notre Dame Australia&quot; was made, after its founding partner the University of Notre Dame in the United States. It would occupy heritage buildings in Fremantle in need of restoration, which were cheaper following the 1987 America&#x27;s Cup as the colonial-era buildings didn&#x27;t have many alternative use cases.

The university was established through the passage of the &quot;University of Notre Dame Australia Act 1989&quot; in the Parliament of Western Australia, where it received support from both sides. The Archdiocese of Perth, Catholic Education Commission and the Sisters of St John of God provided initial loans and donations for property, mainly old unutilised buildings in Fremantle in need of repair. The act was given royal assent on 9 January 1990 and the university was inaugurated at St Patrick&#x27;s Basilica on 2 July 1991 where it was issued a canonical statute. The basilica now serves as one of three Graduation Mass venues, with the homonymous St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Perth and St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney later also used.

Prior to the decision to select Fremantle as the sole campus, the state government had offered the university a land grant in the Alkimos region north in Greater Perth. Under the plan, its main campus would have been built on publicly owned land and would have been treated in effect as any other university in the state. The state government believed that the campus could potentially increase the land value and population of the then sparse region, creating potential income and increasing investment from the private sector.

The planning committee saw the main Alkimos campus as vital to the expansion of the university, with the existing development in Fremantle being perceived as limiting to student population growth and subsequent funding. Although the proposal was discussed extensively between the university and both sides of the state parliament, it led to a collapse of the Labor majority when the disillusioned Frank Donovan left the party. Support for the deal was later rescinded by the Liberal-National coalition and a parliamentary investigation was launched against the Lawrence government. Following a motion of no confidence and the subsequent election of Richard Court as Premier of Western Australia in 1993, the proposal was formally withdrawn. As a result, Notre Dame remains the only university established in Western Australia to not receive a land grant by the state.

=== Growth and development ===
Notre Dame had 50 postgraduate students in its first year, including teachers from the state&#x27;s Catholic school system, and the NDUS also sent 25 study abroad students to spend a semester at the campus. The latter program was repeated each semester and the students were accompanied by a staff member. Classes commenced in February 1992 and the first graduations were held at Fremantle Town Hall later that year. Undergraduate programs began in 1994, when the university first enrolled school leavers, with approximately 570 students during the first year. It also opened a regional campus in Broome that same year located in the northern Kimberley region. Additional schools were founded soon after opening in other fields of study. A target was set by the university to reach 2000 students by 2000 in Fremantle.

The university was also itself responsible for securing funding to restore and convert purchased buildings, its growth and restoration work contributing to it becoming ubiquitous with the West End heritage area of Fremantle as a university town. The influx of staff and students formed a symbiotic relationship with the city&#x27;s culture and economy, and the restoration of neglected heritage buildings improved its status as a tourism precinct. In 2012, a Memorandum of Understanding &quot;&quot;town and gown concordat&quot;&quot; was signed between the university and the City of Fremantle to promote closer ties between them. The relationship has not been free of controversy.

In 2004, Notre Dame became the second Western Australian university to receive accreditation from the Australian Medical Council. This was achieved with following a partnership with the University of Queensland Medical School that included the purchase of its curriculum. It also received support from Curtin University to develop its biomedical science courses. Its first medical school, which drew initial controversy for its private and religious affiliations, was formally opened by then Minister for Education Tony Abbott with an initial 80 postgraduate students. In 2007, it entered a joint partnership with the University of Western Australia to establish and collaborate on the Rural Clinical School of Western Australia. The university also established its &quot;objects&quot; that codify its Catholic identity around this time.

=== Expansion to New South Wales ===
Following an invitation by the Archdiocese of Sydney, a third campus was opened in 2006 by then Prime Minister John Howard on the site of the St Benedict&#x27;s Church on Broadway in Sydney. This was followed by another Sydney site in 2008 on the sites of the Sacred Heart Catholic Church and Sacred Heart Hospice in Darlinghurst. Notre Dame was chosen partly for its prior experience in restoring deteriorating historical landmarks and high-density campus planning.

The Darlinghurst site included its second medical school, which made it the only university in Australia to have more than one medical school. The medical school, which now has clinical and training sites across multiple states, had an initial enrolment of 100 students from New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria. Pope Benedict XVI also visited the newly opened medical school that same year at the Sacred Heart Catholic Church and adjoining Benedict XVI Medical Library, which is named after him. The buildings together with the Sacred Heart Health Service and adjacent St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital forms key components of the St Vincent&#x27;s Integrated Healthcare Campus.

The establishment of the Sydney campus was funded primarily by the Archdiocese of Sydney and the Sydney Catholic Education Office, with additional funding from the federal government. Existing property surrounding the sites such as Pioneer House on Broadway were also restored and new buildings were built to accommodate the future growth of student population. The Sydney Catholic Education Office also donated property including the now-called Canavan Hall building, which houses the St Benedict&#x27;s Library among other facilities. Constituent schools were founded and developed separately in Sydney and included a share-use agreement with University of Technology Sydney for facilities and curriculum for biomedical sciences. In 2024, it acquired UTS&#x27; neighbouring Blackfriars campus.

== Campuses and buildings ==
Notre Dame has three campuses. Its largest campus is located in Fremantle, the port city for the Greater Perth region meanwhile its Sydney campus is split across two sites in the Inner West of the city. It also has a regional campus in Broome, far north in Western Australia in the Kimberley region. It is the only university in Australia to have major campuses on both the east and west coasts and students can apply to switch between campuses during their studies. Additionally, the School of Medicine in Sydney also has eight clinical schools located across New South Wales and Victoria. Notre Dame also offers a range of online courses and programs available through Open Universities Australia.

=== Fremantle ===
The Fremantle campus is the founding campus of Notre Dame and comprises some of Perth&#x27;s oldest buildings. The campus is omnipresent of the Fremantle West End heritage area and includes colonial-era maritime buildings that were restored and converted for university use. The wider precinct is surrounded in clockwise by several harbours, Bathers Beach facing the Indian Ocean and the Fremantle Ports along the inlet of the Swan River.

The campus director Terry Craig, architect Marcus Collins, interior designer Angela Chaney and builder Bill Fairweather were largely responsible for renovating much of the early campus. Subsequent purchases of surrounding buildings over the following decades expanded the campus to later becoming ubiquitous with the precinct as a university town. It is served by three libraries including St Teresa&#x27;s Library, the Galvin Medical Library and the Craven Law Library.

==== Notable buildings ====
Some notable buildings on campus include:

* Customs House was constructed as a warehouse in 1888 and extended twice in 1896 and 1903. It was used as a warehouse for P. Falk and Company and later the United States Navy during World War II. Today, only its ornate façades remain with the interior of the building re-built in 1985. Notre Dame purchased the site in 2017.
* Frank Cadd Building is a rendered stone structure constructed in 1890 with an arched entrance, windows and a bracketed parapet with low pier balustrading. Its namesake is former Mayor of Fremantle Frank Cadd.
* The Kreglinger Buildings include the former Westpac Building built in 1892 and the semi-detached Commercial Building. They were designed by architect Talbot Hobbs in the Federation Academic Classical style and now used for health courses.
* Dalgety Building is a stone and brick structure constructed in 1899 for the Bank of New South Wales. It is built in the Federation Free Classical architecture style.
* Howard Smith Building is a brick and stone structure constructed in 1900 for Howard Smith Limited, then a shipping company. It has a parapet with two decorative pediments. It used by the School of Nursing and Midwifery.
* P&amp;O Building was constructed in 1903 as a brick and stone structure in the Federation Free Classical style with an imposing façade and arches around a central pediment. It was built for the Australian Union Steamship Navigation Company, which was taken over by its current namesake P&amp;O soon after in 1913. It is now occupied by the School of Nursing and Midwifery but was previously shared with Maersk and the Danish Consul.

=== Sydney ===
The Sydney campus is spread across two sites in the city&#x27;s Inner West. This includes its main site on Broadway and the Darlinghurst site which specialises in healthcare. It is also expected to open a third site in Liverpool.

==== Broadway ====

The larger site on Broadway, where the Sydney campus provides most of its programs, is located on and around St Benedict&#x27;s Church. It was opened in 2006 following an invitation by the Archdiocese of Sydney to establish campuses on church sites in need or restoration. Notre Dame&#x27;s prior experience in restoring deteriorating historical landmarks and high-density campus planning played a role in its selection over the Australian Catholic University.

Existing property surrounding the sites such as Pioneer House were also restored and new buildings were built to accommodate the future growth of student population. The Sydney Catholic Education Office also donated property including the now-called Canavan Hall building, which houses the St Benedict&#x27;s Library among other facilities. In 2024, it acquired the neighbouring Blackfriars campus from the University of Technology Sydney.

==== Darlinghurst ====
The Darlinghurst site was opened in 2008 and is home to the Schools of Medicine and Nursing in Sydney. It is located on the sites of the Sacred Heart Catholic Church and Sacred Heart Hospice in Darlinghurst. It is adjacent to St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital and the Sacred Heart Health Service, with which it forms key components of the wider St Vincent&#x27;s Integrated Healthcare Campus. It is served by the Benedict XVI Medical Library, which is named after Pope Benedict XVI who blessed the site following its opening.

==== Liverpool ====
Notre Dame and the Liverpool City Council reached an agreement in late 2024 for the university to expand its footprint to the Liverpool CBD. It is expected to be its third Sydney site and the first to be located in its western suburbs.

==== Clinical schools ====

Whilst not formal campuses, the School of Medicine in Sydney operates eight clinical schools across New South Wales and Victoria. In New South Wales, clinical schools in Greater Sydney are located in Darlinghurst, Auburn and Hawkesbury and regional sites are located in Lithgow and Riverina.

In Victoria, clinical schools are located in Melbourne and Ballarat.

=== Broome ===
The Broome campus is the only campus of Notre Dame to be located outside of a state capital. It was opened in 1994 in the Kimberley region north in Western Australia. It received funding from and was established by the Sisters of St John of God on the former site of a Catholic boarding school. The buildings are located near the epicentre of the town and was restored and renovated for use. The campus has its own library, some limited student accommodation and grew to offer vocational and baccalaureate courses in nursing, teaching and commerce.

=== Affiliated institutions ===
Notre Dame also offers studies at affiliated institutions outside of its three campuses. In spite of their co-ordinated academic programs and courses, they are still separate institutions that are operated independently.

==== Catholic Institute of Sydney ====

The Catholic Institute of Sydney (CIS) is the sole ecclesiastical faculty of the Catholic Church in Australia. It is located in Strathfield in Sydney&#x27;s Inner West and offers baccalaureate, postgraduate and doctoral studies in ministry and theology. Its courses are provided in co-ordination with Notre Dame, which is its accrediting and awarding body for civil awards recognised in Australia. Although erected under canon law, Notre Dame itself isn&#x27;t a pontifical university and CIS confers its own ecclesiastical degrees. The dual-award structure allows studies to be recognised in both Australia and by the Holy See.

Students at CIS have access to all of the amenities at Notre Dame and its academic programs are also provided at Notre Dame&#x27;s campuses. Students at both institutions are able to switch between campuses throughout their enrolment. CIS also offers courses at Vianney College in Wagga Wagga, a regional city in New South Wales.

==== Te Kupenga – Catholic Theological College ====

Located in Auckland, the Catholic Theological College (Te Kupenga) is the sole Roman Catholic theological college in New Zealand. Its courses are also provided in co-ordination with Notre Dame and qualifications issued are recognised under the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Agreement. It offers religious education programs including ministry and theology.

==== Campion College ====

Campion College is a Roman Catholic liberal arts college. It is located in Toongabbie, in the western suburbs of Sydney, and named in honour of Saint Edmund Campion. It provides studies in the liberal arts and religious education, including some pathways into Notre Dame with advanced standing.

=== Finances ===
The net assets owned by the university at the end of 2023 stood at . The university completed 2023 with revenues of and expenses of , for an excess in revenue of . In 2023, the largest source of revenue came from annual grants provided by the federal, state and local governments followed by student fees. Notre Dame is registered as an educational charitable organisation in Australia, with most of its revenue dedicated to the management and maintenance of the university.

During its early years, Notre Dame relied on private tuition and fundraising for scholarships. Starting in 1998, the federal government gradually began subsidising tuition and providing low-interest loans for students at the university, eventually leading to it being granted Table A status in 2021. The change in designation under the &quot;Higher Education Support Act 2003&quot; reclassified Notre Dame from a private university to a public university, allowing it to access additional funding.

=== Insignia ===
Notre Dame&#x27;s crest is based on design notes taken by Father John Neill, a Trustee of the university from 1990 to 2009. The crest displays an open Bible at its core with the opening verse from the Gospel of John inscribed in Latin that reads &quot;in principio erat verbum&quot; translated &quot;In the beginning was the Word&quot;. The verse was chosen as the motto to symbolise everything that exists beginning as an idea.

The waves below the open Bible and the Commonwealth Star represent the port city of Fremantle, where the university was founded, and Australia as a nation surrounded by water. The symbols are affixed to an Oxford Blue badge over a Cambridge Blue Greek cross surrounded by a gold band that reads the university name. The shades are not exact and are also used in branding as &quot;Navy Blue&quot; and &quot;Sky Blue&quot; respectively, which together with Gold forms its brand colours.

The badge is also used separately for sports but the full crest is used in official documents, including degree parchments. Additionally, the Broome campus also has its own crest which uses different colours and integrates Aboriginal art.

== Academic profile ==

=== Library system ===
Notre Dame has six libraries that are spread across its three campuses. In addition to its own collections, staff and students at the university have online access to journals and other electronic resources. It also has reciprocal borrowing arrangements with other university libraries in Australia and New Zealand and participates in the AARNet Eduroam Wi-Fi roaming service.

In Fremantle, libraries include the main St Teresa&#x27;s Library, the Galvin Medical Library and the Craven Law Library. Libraries on the Sydney campus include St Benedict&#x27;s Library on the Broadway site and the Benedict XVI Medical Library on the Darlinghurst site. The Broome Campus Library is the sole library on the Broome campus.

==== St Teresa&#x27;s Library ====
St Teresa&#x27;s Library in Fremantle was converted from a heritage-listed warehouse constructed in 1900 on land owned by John Bateman for Bateman Hardware. It is named after the former St Teresa&#x27;s College in Minnesota (United States) from where 170,000 printed works were purchased for the library. The NDUS Librarian had informed UNDA of the closure in 1989 and US$1 million was raised to acquire its collection. The building was first adapted to become a university library in 1994 when only limited, low cost adaptive re-use works could be afforded, and was renovated in 2011 when a second floor was fitted into the site. , it is closed for further renovations and is expected to re-open in time for the 2025 academic year. It will form part of a re-developed student hub situated in the Bateman Courtyard, in between Henry and Mouat Street.

==== Craven Law Library ====
The Craven Law Library is the law library on the Fremantle campus. It is co-located with St Teresa&#x27;s Library in one of several Bateman Buildings forming part of the Bateman Courtyard. Established in 1997, the library holds a print collection of legal works from Australian and overseas sources. In 2003, it was renamed to the Craven Law Library after Greg Craven, the founding dean of Notre Dame&#x27;s law school. The library underwent renovations in 2024 to include a new moot court and three tutorial rooms to form part of the wider Craven Law Centre. During restoration works in 2023, the original hand-painted signage reading &quot;J &amp; W Bateman Ltd.&quot; was revealed preserved under several layers of removed paint. The shipping company, which was dominant in the early colony, had previously used the buildings as a storage site since the 1890s.

==== Galvin Medical Library ====
The Galvin Medical Library in Fremantle is contained within the School of Medicine, a heritage listed building designed by architect Frederick Burwell. It is home to the books and other resources in the fields of medicine, nursing and allied health. Constructed from 1900 onward, the building was known as Fowler&#x27;s Warehouse and served as the principal premises in Western Australia for D. &amp; J. Fowler Ltd., the wholesale grocery company. The library was opened in 2005 after Notre Dame took over its lease from the City of Fremantle. It is named after the Galvin family, an early donor to the School of Medicine&#x27;s establishment, and extends from 38 to 40 Henry Street to the adjacent Pakenham Street. Its has a wide entrance which at was originally designed to accommodate two loaded horse-drawn wagons.

==== St Benedict&#x27;s Library ====
St Benedict&#x27;s Library, on the Broadway site, is one of two libraries on the Sydney campus. It is home to the books and other resources in the fields of commerce, education, law, philosophy, theology, the arts and sciences. It was initially located in the main academic building but moved to the Canavan Hall, situated on Grafton Street, in late 2011. The new library was converted from an old warehouse which was donated by the Sydney Catholic Education Office. The library underwent substantial renovations in 2020.

==== Benedict XVI Medical Library ====
The Benedict XVI Medical Library, on the Darlinghurst site, is one of two libraries on the Sydney campus. It is housed in the Darlinghurst Hall of the former Sacred Heart School, which was constructed in 1880 and was used by the school until it ceased operations in 1986. The school, and the adjacent St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, were both originally operated by the Sisters of Charity of Australia. Notre Dame assumed control of the site some time between 2004 and 2005, though the Darlinghurst site didn&#x27;t open until 2008. It houses books and other resources in the fields of medicine, nursing, pre-clinical sciences, ethics, philosophy and theology. It is situated on 160 Oxford Street, next to the Sacred Heart Catholic Church, and named after Pope Benedict XVI who blessed the site following its opening.

==== Broome Campus Library ====
The Broome Campus Library is Notre Dame&#x27;s sole library at the Broome campus. The original library was opened in 1994 at the former student residences of Nulungu Catholic College. The secondary boarding school merged with other entities and renamed to St Mary&#x27;s College the following year, opening a new residential facility in 2008. Due to space limitations, the library moved into a new purpose-built building in 2005. It also hosts a collection of Aboriginal artwork, sculptures and other artefacts, some of which are on display.

Its law programs are accredited by the relevant lawyer registration boards in New South Wales and Western Australia. Its two medical schools are accredited individually by the Australian Medical Council, and other healthcare programs with the relevant National Board of the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency or their affiliated agencies. In mid-2024, Notre Dame launched its first computer science program which is in the process of being accredited by the Australian Computer Society. Most programs are also recognised in other states, territories and New Zealand through reciprocal arrangements.

=== Academic calendar ===
The academic year at Notre Dame is divided into two semesters, with summer and winter terms in-between. The first semester runs from February to May and the second semester from July to October, each followed by two study weeks and two examination weeks. All terms start on a Monday excluding national or state-specific public holidays. The weeks of term are called &quot;Teaching Weeks&quot;, numbered from 1 to 13, although this excludes study and examination weeks. Additionally, there is an &quot;Orientation Week&quot;, informally known as &quot;O-Week&quot;, for first year students prior to the start of each semester.

Certain courses in healthcare and education adopt different academic calendars. Students in these courses also have mandatory attendance requirements, including placements and clinical practicums, required to meet their academic requirements at the university. As such deans must be satisfied that each student has attended all necessary tutorials, workshops and practical work throughout the semester and non-standard study periods.

=== Tuition, loans and financial aid ===
For international students starting in 2025, tuition fees range from to per academic year depending on the field of study. Domestic students may be offered a federally-subsidised Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP) which substantially decreases the student contribution amount billed to the student. The maximum student contribution amount limits that can be applied to CSP students are dependent on the field of study.

Since 2021, Commonwealth Supported Places have also been limited to 7 years of equivalent full-time study load (EFTSL), calculated in the form of Student Learning Entitlement (SLE). Students may accrue additional SLE under some circumstances (e.g. starting a &quot;separate&quot; one-year honours program) or every 10 years. Domestic students are also able to access the HECS-HELP student loans scheme offered by the federal government. These are indexed to the Consumer or Wage Price Index, whichever is lower, and repayments are voluntary until the recipient passes an income threshold.

Notre Dame also offers several scholarships, which come in the form of bursaries or tuition fee remission.

=== Admissions ===
Notre Dame offers two routes for students to apply: a direct application and an application submitted through a shared admissions portal. Applicants who want an earlier, binding decision can apply via the Young Achievers Early Offer Program; others apply through regular decision. The Tertiary Institutions Service Centre (TISC) is the administrative body processing applications for prospective students in Western Australia and the Universities Admissions Centre (UAC) manages applications in New South Wales. Additionally, students applying for postgraduate medicine can apply via the Graduate Entry Medical School Admissions System (GEMSAS) or the Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre (VTAC).

Notre Dame considers various factors in its admissions process including a competitive Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) or equivalent, a Grade Point Average (GPA) from prior higher education, vocational qualifications, competitive scores from a Skills for Tertiary Admissions Test (STAT) and prior work experience. Additionally, the Tertiary Pathway Program is a bridging program that provide direct entry into most courses, including a nursing stream. The program, which is free for domestic students, is available during ordinary semesters or over an intensive summer school prior to the start of the formal academic year. It is also open for concurrent studies to high school students during Year 12 as part of the &quot;UniPath&quot; program.

==== Widening access ====
Direct applications don&#x27;t have a fee and can include a portfolio used to determine individual qualities about the applicant. Areas assessed include personal qualities, contribution to community and life experiences. These factors can affect the applicant&#x27;s selection rank by means of additional points granted to their selection rank. Some adjustment factors include participation in extracurricular activities, the creative arts, volunteer work, sports, elite athlete status, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status, work experience, military service in the Australian Defence Force and socio-economic disadvantage. Overall, a total of up to 10 adjustment factor points may be granted.

The median ATAR for undergraduates admitted into Notre Dame programs in the first semester of 2024 was 82.5 (84.85 with adjustment factors), with a low of 59.25 (65.15 with adjustment factors) and high of 99.65 (99.95 with adjustment factors).

=== Academic reputation ===
Notre Dame is placed lower than almost all Australian universities on ranking publications, attributable to its low research output.
; National publications
In the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; Best Universities Ranking 2024, Notre Dame was ranked 36th amongst Australian universities.

; Global publications

In the 2025 &quot;Quacquarelli Symonds&quot; World University Rankings (published 2024), Notre Dame was ranked #1400+ in the world.

=== Student outcomes ===
The Australian Government&#x27;s QILT conducts national surveys documenting the student life cycle from enrolment through to employment. These surveys place more emphasis on criteria such as student experience, graduate outcomes and employer satisfaction than perceived reputation, research output and citation counts.

In the 2023 Employer Satisfaction Survey, Notre Dame graduates had an overall employer satisfaction rate of 84.9%.

In the 2023 Graduate Outcomes Survey, Notre Dame had a full-time employment rate of 86.5% for undergraduates and 94.1% for postgraduates. The initial full-time salary was for undergraduates and for postgraduates.

In the 2023 Student Experience Survey, Notre Dame undergraduates rated the quality of their entire educational experience at 78% meanwhile postgraduates rated their overall education experience at 78.3%.

=== Graduation ===
Although the practice of graduating in cathedrals is common in some countries, Notre Dame splits the tradition into two events. Students receive a jarrah cross during graduation Mass and their testamurs at a second graduation ceremony.

In Perth, graduation events are held at St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Perth, for the graduation Mass and the Perth Convention and Exhibition Centre for the graduation ceremony. The Mass is also occasionally held at St Patrick&#x27;s Basilica, Fremantle which is closer to the campus.

In Sydney, graduation events are held at St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney, for graduation Mass and the International Convention Centre Sydney for the graduation ceremony.

In Broome, graduation events are held on the same day at Nulungu Chapel for graduation Mass and another area on campus for the graduation ceremony.

Graduates wear a gown, over a semi-formal dress code, during graduation Mass and the full academic regalia during the following graduation ceremony.

==== Honours, distinction and medals ====
High-performing students at Notre Dame can have their scholastic distinctions be recognised at graduation on their testamurs and official transcripts. Graduates must achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.25/4 to graduate &quot;with Distinction&quot; or a cumulative GPA of 3.5/4 or higher to graduate &quot;with High Distinction&quot;.

Students who achieve a 70% or higher weighed average mark (WAM) may be invited to complete an honours supervised research program. These are graded in classes (e.g. First Class Honours) and qualify students to enrol in research degrees such as Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) programs. Students receive an additional 1 SLE for appended honours.

Graduates who achieve the highest WAM in each state also receive the University Medal. There are also additional medals for students of each teaching school at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.

== Student life ==
=== Religious atmosphere ===
While having a religious affiliation is not a criterion for admission, Notre Dame identifies as a Roman Catholic university with a Catholic core curriculum and extracurricular activities outside of academic studies. The university also follows the &quot;Ex corde Ecclesiae&quot;, an apostolic constitution for Catholic universities.

==== Chaplaincy ====
Notre Dame has a church or chapel across its four main sites, each with a designated chaplain. These include the Holy Spirit Chapel in Fremantle, St Benedict&#x27;s Catholic Church on Broadway, the Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Darlinghurst and the Nulungu Chapel in Broome. The sites in Fremantle and Sydney are also open to the public as places of worship and run regular Mass services throughout the week.

The stated purpose of the Chaplaincy is to &quot;[provide] opportunities for all Notre Dame students to explore and develop a life of faith&quot;. It offers programming for Catholic liturgical services and traditions including Mass, sacraments, communal prayer, worship, group bible study, choir, music and social ministry. Its traditions include a Month of Remembrance, to commemorate those who has passed away, and the annual Blessing of the Fleet in Fremantle.

==== Core curriculum ====
All students at Notre Dame are required to complete the Catholic-inspired core curriculum, which aim to develop graduate attributes within a liberal arts context. For undergraduates pursuing bachelor&#x27;s degrees, this includes two courses in philosophy and theology. During the first year, it includes &quot;Foundations of Wisdom&quot; which aims to &quot;explore the ideas, beliefs and means of thinking in the Catholic Liberal intellectual and spiritual tradition&quot;. In the subsequent years, students have the option to enrol in a cognate elective, pilgrimage, charity, community service or an &quot;international experience&quot;. The latter includes travel to either Broome or an overseas location and can be undertaken within an intensive four-week period. Postgraduate students are only required to complete one core curriculum elective from the same options.

==== Study retreats ====
The chaplaincy also runs study retreats each semester outside of its campuses. These usually last four days during the pre-examination study week and allow students to prepare or work on assignments outside of the city centres. The retreats also include scenic walks, social activities and time for prayer, sacraments and spiritual reflection.

For students in Perth, study retreats are held at the New Norcia Benedictine Community in New Norcia located approximately north of the city. Founded in 1847 by Spanish Benedictine monks, it is the only monastic town in Australia and is home to several heritage and religious sites.

For students in Sydney, venues alternate between Mount Carmel Retreat Centre during the first semester and the Hartzer Park Conference and Retreat Centre during the second. The Mount Carmel Retreat Centre was founded in 1965 by Carmelitre Friars and is located in Varroville on the outer fringes of Western Sydney. The Hartzer Park Conference and Retreat Centre is a site in Bowral, a town in the Southern Highlands of regional New South Wales. It is named after Marie Louise Hartzer, the first superior general of the Daughters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, who have owned the site since 1947.

==== Personal development ====
The Notre Dame Volunteer Network in Fremantle oversees volunteer projects in Perth and the surrounding area. It connects staff and student volunteers to non-profit organisations in need of support. Similar opportunities are also available to students in Sydney through partner organisations. There is also a student mentorship program.

Students can also participate in the &quot;In Altum&quot; personal and career development program offered by the Chaplaincy. It incorporates volunteering and leadership skills with the stated aim to help students &quot;develop spiritually, to identify their own passions and gifts, and to serve the Church in a meaningful way&quot;. The program involves contributing with Chaplaincy activities or a project of choice, attending formation sessions and group meetings, receiving mentorship from the Chaplaincy, taking part in a Chaplaincy Spiritual Retreat and committing to a personal prayer. Personal projects can include liturgical activities, music ministry, organising events, leading small groups, community outreach, running movie and game nights or creating arts, crafts or other media. The program lasts for one semester and runs outside of formal academic programs.

&quot;In Altum&quot;, from the Latin &quot;duc in altum&quot;, translates to &quot;into the deep&quot; or &quot;into higher things&quot; from Luke 5:4. It is a quote attributed to Jesus which is similar to the &quot;give a man a fish&quot; proverb but within a religious context.

=== Student demographics ===
In the 2023 academic year, Notre Dame had an enrolment of 11,579 students divided between its three campuses including 4,367 commencing students. The equivalent full-time study load (EFTSL) was 6,486 for undergraduate students and 1,884 for postgraduate students. The student population is largely made up of domestic students, with a total of 411 EFTSL international students. These statistics don&#x27;t take into account external students enrolled via Open Universities Australia. The university has been allocated an international student cap of 700 enrolments for 2025, the second-highest increase relative to 2023 figures.

=== Student association ===
The &quot;Student Association of the University of Notre Dame Australia&quot; has two branches, each representing students in Perth or Sydney. They operate both as the representative voice for students and as a provider of a wide range of services. They are democratically controlled through General Meetings and elections, and are run by elected student officers. The associations also support a range of services, including numerous clubs and societies, events, sports and advice services.

The Sydney branch of the Student Association of the University of Notre Dame Australia (SAUNDA) represents students at the Sydney sites meanwhile the Perth branch in Fremantle is abbreviated as the Notre Dame Student Association (NDSA). Both associations have separate student-run clubs and societies, and are governed independently.

From 2025, both branches will be funded through the Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF) similarly to other public universities in Australia. The fee is expected to increase the their resources and will be allocated though a staff and student committee. For domestic students, it will be deferable through a SA-HELP student loan and international students will be able to apply for the Student Hardship Fund or other support services.

==== Clubs and societies ====
, there are 22 clubs and societies affiliated with the student association at the Sydney branch and 17 at the Perth branch. Students can also organise new clubs and societies by registering them with the association, which is responsible for funding and monitoring their activities. This approval process does not authorise them to act on behalf of the university or student association, nor does approval indicate their agreement with their purpose. Additionally, the student association is responsible to ensure their compliance with the university objects and other policies.

=== Sport and athletics ===
Notre Dame competes in inter-university fixtures in the UniSport Nationals competition in a range of sports, including beach volleyball, futsal, golf, hockey, netball, rowing, squash, ten-pin bowling, touch football and volleyball among other events. It also competes in the state-level NSW Intervarsity in New South Wales and the Western Series in Western Australia.

The university is also a member of the Elite Athlete University Network and provides additional adjustment factors, early entry and greater flexibility during studies to registered elite athletes and coaches.

=== Student accommodation ===
The university has limited on-campus housing capacity and relies on external student accommodation providers.

==== Western Australia ====
The Port Lodge student housing facility is located at 28 Marine Terrace in Fremantle and comprises 25 beds in single and shared rooms. It was originally established as &quot;Sailors&#x27; Rest&quot; in 1892 for seafarers travelling to the port city. It began construction in 1899 when then state premier John Forrest laid the foundation stone. It was the precursor to the &quot;Flying Angel Club&quot; on Queen Victoria Street and was run by Rosa Henriques Smith, a social worker who was active at the ports.

There are also other private student accommodation providers situated closer to the Perth CBD and most residential colleges at the University of Western Australia also accept applicants from other universities.

The Broome campus occupies the site of a former boarding school. It includes a Village, comprising nine houses with five bedrooms each, and a Hostel with single and shared rooms.

==== New South Wales ====
The Sydney sites are located closer to the CBD where there are more private student accommodation providers located within proximity. The Sancta Sophia College at the University of Sydney also accepts applicants from Notre Dame and St Paul&#x27;s College accepts applications from medical students at the university.

=== Exchange programs ===
Notre Dame offers students the opportunity to study abroad at partner institutions with which it maintains international exchange agreements. The exchanges are open to students who have completed at least one semester at the university and whose degree permits studies abroad with a suitable course combination that can be credited towards their program. Applicants are usually required to have achieved a Grade Point Average (GPA) of 2.5/4 or higher and must study full-time when abroad. Additionally, students enrolled in some healthcare courses have restrictions in place. Students enrolled in a Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP) can also apply for OS-HELP student loans to cover travel, accommodation and study-related costs. There is a lifetime limit of two OS-HELP loans, with higher caps for students opting to study in Asia. OS-HELP loans are indexed similarly to HECS-HELP student loans with compulsory repayments over an income threshold.

==== Notre Dame USA ====
The university had maintained student exchange arrangements with the University of Notre Dame in Indiana since its inception. The arrangements were expanded in 2022 to allow students from both institutions to study abroad at the other while retaining grades and without additional tuition. This included NDUS&#x27; Global Gateways in Europe, Asia and Latin America.

==== Partner institutions ====
In the Asia–Pacific, partner institutions include the Catholic University of Korea, Fu Jen Catholic University, Lasalle College of the Arts (University of the Arts Singapore), Parahyangan Catholic University, Sogang University and Sophia University.

In Europe, partner institutions include the Catholic University of Lyon, HU University of Applied Sciences Utrecht, Leeds Trinity University, Mary Immaculate College (University of Limerick), Maynooth University (National University of Ireland), Paderborn University, Pázmány Péter Catholic University, St Mary&#x27;s University (Twickenham), the Catholic University of the West, the University of Navarra and the University of Lucerne.

In Latin America, partner institutions include the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.

In Northern America, partner institutions include Boston College, the Catholic University of America, the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John&#x27;s University, DaSales University, King&#x27;s University College (University of Western Ontario), Purdue University, St. Edward&#x27;s University, St. Mary&#x27;s University (Calgary) the University of Notre Dame (Indiana), the University of Portland and the University of San Francisco.

In addition to overseas exchange partners, students can also apply to transfer between campuses.

=== Transportation ===
In Perth, the Fremantle campus is served by the adjacent Fremantle railway station which is the terminus for the Fremantle line. The railway station, which also has bus services, connects the university to the rest of the Transperth network.

The Sydney sites are served by buses connecting to nearby railway stations and other parts of the city. The Broadway campus is closest to the Central and Redfern railway stations meanwhile the Darlinghurst campus is near Kings Cross railway station.

The regional Broome campus has limited public transport infrastructure.

<text>Miodrag Bulatović (; 20 February 1930 – 15 March 1991) was a writer, novelist, journalist and playwright. 

==Biography==
Bulatović began in 1956 with a book of short stories, &quot;Djavoli dolaze&quot; (&quot;The Devils Are Coming&quot;, translated as &quot;Stop the Danube&quot;), for which he received the Serbian Writers Union Award. His novel &quot;The Red Rooster Flies Heavenwards&quot;, set in his homeland of northeastern Montenegro, was translated into more than twenty foreign languages. He then stopped publishing for a time, to protest against interference in his work.

His next novel, &quot;Hero on a Donkey&quot;, &quot;A dark hot nightmare of a war novel...&quot;, was first published abroad and only four years later (1967) in Yugoslavia.

Common themes in his works are demons, evil, grotesque and black humor.

In 1975, Bulatović won the NIN Award for novel of the year for &quot;People with Four Fingers&quot;, an insight into the émigré&#x27;s life. &quot;The Fifth Finger&quot; was a sequel to that book. His last novel was &quot;Gullo Gullo&quot;, which brought together various themes from his previous books.

A library in Rakovica is named after him.

Bulatović was known &quot;for his fierce Serbian nationalism, which earned him the enmity of other ethnic groups in Yugoslavia, and he was an official of Serbia&#x27;s Socialist Party.&quot; His candidature for the President of the Association of Writers of Yugoslavia in 1986 was rejected by Slovenian, Kosovan, Montenegrin and Croatian branch of the Association contributing to the subsequent dissolution of the Association in 1989.

<doc id="564370" wikidata="Q2112329" url="?curid=564370" title="Project Prevention">
<text>Project Prevention (formerly Children Requiring a Caring Kommunity or CRACK) is an American non-profit organization that pays drug addicts cash for volunteering for long-term birth control, including sterilization. Originally based in California and now based in North Carolina, the organization began operating in the United Kingdom in 2010. The organization offers US$300 (£200 in the UK) to each participant. Barbara Harris founded the organization in 1997 after she and her husband adopted the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth child of a drug-addicted mother. As of July 2024, the organization had paid 8,122 people.

== History ==
Barbara Harris founded the organization in Anaheim, California in 1997 as Children Requiring a Caring Kommunity (CRACK) after she and her husband adopted four children, one-by-one as each was born, from a drug-addicted mother. Each of the four adopted children is separated in age by only one year. With the experience of helping the children through withdrawal and other health problems, she tried to get legislation passed in California that would have mandated long-term birth control for mothers who gave birth to babies who were exposed to cocaine as fetuses. After this failed, she started what is now called Project Prevention.

== Activities ==
Project Prevention says their main goal is to promote awareness of the dangers of using drugs during pregnancy. They are better known, however, for paying drug addicts cash for volunteering for long-term birth control, including sterilization. The organization offers US$300 (£200 in the UK) to each participant. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reports that the organization initially offered more money to women who chose tubal ligations and men who chose vasectomies than to those who chose long-term birth control like intrauterine devices, but criticism forced them to adopt a flat rate. To receive the money, clients must show evidence they have been arrested on a drug-related offence, or provide a doctor&#x27;s certificate saying they use drugs, and further evidence is needed confirming that the birth-control procedure has taken place. The organization keeps statistics on its activities through survey forms that all participants fill out, before any procedure is completed. As of July 2024, out of 8,122 clients it had paid: 4,956 (61%) were white; 1,714 (21.1%) black; 845 (10.4%) Hispanic; 597 (7.4%) other.

==Criticism and response==

The organization has used slogans such as &quot;Don&#x27;t let pregnancy get in the way of your crack habit&quot; and &quot;She has her Daddy&#x27;s eyes and her Mommy&#x27;s heroin addiction&quot;. In interviews Harris said &quot;We don&#x27;t allow dogs to breed. We spay them. We neuter them. We try to keep them from having unwanted puppies, and yet these women are literally having litters of children&quot;, and that &quot;we campaign to neuter dogs and yet we allow women to have 10 or 12 kids that they can&#x27;t take care of&quot;. On the television news program &quot;60 Minutes II&quot; Harris was asked about these comments and said, &quot;Well, you know my son that goes to Stanford said &#x27;mom, please don&#x27;t ever say that again,&#x27; but it&#x27;s the truth, they don&#x27;t just have one and two babies, they have litters.&quot; More recently, Harris has offered a softer response to criticism: &quot;I guess it depends on where your heart is. Some people are so into the women and their rights to get pregnant that they seem to forget about the rights of the kids. They act like these children don&#x27;t matter. People need to realize these women don&#x27;t want to have babies that are taken away from them. Nothing positive comes to the woman who has eight children taken away from her.&quot;

Opponents of the organization often argue that it should instead focus on addiction treatment or lobbying for government health care. The organization responds by saying that they do not have the resources to solve &quot;national problems of poverty, housing, nutrition, education and rehabilitation services. Those resources we do have are spent to prevent a problem for $300 rather than paying millions after it happens in cost to care for a potentially damaged child.&quot; Weaning one opioid-addicted baby off drugs costs about $500,000.

The organization has been harshly criticized by many as potentially leading to eugenic outcomes.

== United Kingdom ==
Project Prevention began operating in the UK in 2010. In May 2010 a woman, not an addict, was leaving a clinic in Glasgow in what she described as &quot;the Possilpark area—it&#x27;s a well-known area for drugs&quot; accompanied by her nine-year-old son when she was approached by three women who said they were from the organization and who offered her £200 if she agreed to be sterilized. The woman said the same group had been approaching other women, and she later informed Strathclyde police, who advised anyone approached in a similar way to contact them. The first UK client was &quot;John&quot;, a drug user since the age of 12, who accepted money to have a vasectomy, saying he should never be a father.

The organization has been criticized in the UK. Addaction, an addiction charity, said its practices are &quot;morally reprehensible and irrelevant&quot;. Martin Barnes, CEO of DrugScope, said the organization&#x27;s activities were exploitative, ethically dubious, and morally questionable. Harris admitted her methods amounted to bribery, but said it was the only way to stop babies being physically and mentally damaged by drugs during pregnancy. The British Medical Association (BMA) said it did not have a view on the organization:

As with all requests for treatment, doctors need to be confident that the individual has the capacity to make the specific decision at the time the decision is required. The BMA&#x27;s ethics committee also believes that doctors should inform patients of the benefits of reversible contraception so that the patients have more reproductive choices in the future.
 On 18 October 2010, the BBC broadcast a program, &quot;Sterilising the Addicts&quot;, about the organization. A similar program, &quot;Addicts: No Children Allowed&quot;, was broadcast in Scotland by BBC Scotland.

== Ireland ==
Harris said in 2010 that Project Prevention might expand their activities to Ireland. In response Fiona Weldon, clinical director of Dublin addictions treatment facility, the Rutland Centre, said it was &quot;absolutely horrendous&quot;, and that the organization was misguided and could be leaving itself open to litigation in the future. Tony Geoghegan, CEO of drug addiction and homeless charity Merchants Quay Ireland, said it was inappropriate to sterilize addicts.

As she states in her &quot;Author&#x27;s Note&quot;, Fraser aims to test the truth or falsehood of the many legends on Mary and to set her in the context of the age in which she lived. The portrayal is largely sympathetic. Fraser stresses what she sees as Mary&#x27;s key virtues but believes that Scotland at the time required an extraordinarily strong ruler to pull the nobles into line.

The book dismantles several myths and popular legends that have sprung up about Mary during and after her lifetime. Fraser recounts the circumstances on the plot to murder Mary&#x27;s second husband, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, in detail. At the Conference of York, Regent James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray, produced the casket letters, presented as love letters from Mary to her third husband, James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, with whom she had allegedly plotted to kill Darnley. After rigorous research, Fraser concludes that they were forgeries, most likely an amalgamation of real letters that Mary wrote and of love letters written to Bothwell by one of his mistresses.

The book had Fraser awarded the 1969 James Tait Black Memorial Prize.

<text>Tell Me Your Dreams is a 1998 novel by American writer Sidney Sheldon on Dissociative Identity Disorder or Split Personality.

==Plot summary==

The main characters of the book are Ashley Patterson, an introverted workaholic, her co-workers, Toni Prescott, an outgoing singer and dancer, shy artist Alette Peters and Ashley&#x27;s father, Dr. Steven Patterson.

The three women do not get along very well, because of their dissimilar natures. Toni and Alette generally maintain a friendship, with Alette a calming influence, but Toni dislikes Ashley and criticizes her harshly. All three have issues with their mothers having told them they&#x27;d never amount to anything.

Ashley fears that somebody is following her. She finds her house lights turned on when she returns from work, her personal effects in disarray, and someone has written &quot;You will die&quot; on her mirror with a lipstick. She thinks someone&#x27;s broken into her house. She requests a police escort, but the next morning, the police officer assigned to this duty is found dead in her apartment. Two other murders have already taken place, with an identical pattern. All the murdered men had been castrated and were having sex before being murdered. Evidence points to the same woman being involved in all three cases. When a gift from one of the murdered men to Toni is found among Ashley&#x27;s things, she is identified as the killer and arrested. At this point, it is revealed that the three women are three selves of a woman suffering from multiple personality disorder (MPD).

Ashley&#x27;s father persuades an attorney friend, David Singer, to represent Ashley. The second half of the novel deals with the trial, complete with endless squabbling between opposing psychiatrists as to whether or not MPD is real. Finally when David introduces Toni, the violent alter of Ashley, the court is convinced that Ashley is innocent. Ashley is committed to an insane asylum and in the course of therapy is introduced to her two &quot;alters&quot; and relives the horrific events that shattered her mind. She was sexually abused during her childhood, and this made her develop a strong hatred towards men.

In the asylum, Ashley is treated for MPD by Dr. Gilbert and Dr. Otto Lewis. Gilbert falls for her and during her crisis, he too feels her pain and wants to comfort her. It is revealed that her father, Dr. Steven, was the one who sexually abused her, causing her to develop Dissociative Identity Disorder resulting in the creation of the alter Toni, and becomes a thing of her mother&#x27;s detest. While living in Italy during her teenage years, she was once again assaulted by her father, leading to the creation of Alette. The structuring of both the alters is very interesting. The first alter represents her struggle and fear as a helpless child without sexual maturity, and (Toni) develops into a protective one and becomes murderous when encountered with similar conditions. While the second alter (Alette) represents her feeling of shame and pain of being breached, thus developing into a source of console exhibiting warmth and motherly love who has good rapport with Ashley.

However, Toni is enraged when she learns that the woman her father is about to marry has a three-year-old daughter and is afraid that the girl would suffer the same fate she had. Dr. Gilbert drains anger out of Toni by showing the news everyday, making Toni softer with each passing day.

This softer side of Toni is only a front to show Dr. Gilbert she has finally accepted everything so she and Alette can get out of the asylum to kill her father, who is staying in The Hamptons for Christmas. Soon, Dr. Gilbert releases her from the asylum as he believes she is cured.

In the end, Ashley is shown to be traveling on a train to The Hamptons, where her father is staying, when Toni suddenly shows up to kill him.

<doc id="564375" wikidata="Q11682814" url="?curid=564375" title="Yeshu">
<text>Yeshu (Hebrew: &quot;Yēšū&quot;) is the name of an individual or individuals mentioned in rabbinic literature, thought by some to refer to Jesus when used in the Talmud. The name &quot;Yeshu&quot; is also used in other sources before and after the completion of the Babylonian Talmud. It is also the modern Israeli spelling of Jesus.

The identification of Jesus with any number of individuals named &quot;Yeshu&quot; has numerous problems, as most of the individuals are said to have lived in time periods far detached from that of Jesus;
Yeshu the sorcerer is noted for being executed by the Hasmonean government which lost legal authority in 63 BCE, Yeshu the student is described being among the Pharisees who returned to Israel from Egypt in 74 BC, and Yeshu ben Pandera/ben Stada&#x27;s stepfather is noted as speaking with Rabbi Akiva shortly before the rabbi&#x27;s execution, an event which occurred in c. 134 AD. During the Middle Ages, Ashkenazi Jewish authorities were forced to interpret these passages in relation to the Christian beliefs about Jesus of Nazareth. As historian David Berger observed,

However, a probable answer is that rabbinic literature is often not literal but allegorical, thus stories can be made up to conjure a deeper meaning or a secret message that requires insider knowledge to fully understand.

In 1240, Nicholas Donin, with the support of Pope Gregory IX, referred to Yeshu narratives to support his accusation that the Jewish community had attacked the virginity of Mary and the divinity of Jesus. In the Disputation of Paris, Yechiel of Paris conceded that one of the Yeshu stories in the Talmud referred to Jesus of Nazareth, but that the other passages referred to other people. In 1372, John of Valladolid, with the support of the Archbishop of Toledo, made a similar accusation against the Jewish community; Moses ha-Kohen de Tordesillas argued that the Yeshu narratives referred to different people and could not have referred to Jesus of Nazareth. Asher ben Jehiel also asserted that the Yeshu of the Talmud is unrelated to the Christian Jesus.

There are some modern scholars who understand these passages to be references to Christianity and the Christian figure of Jesus, and others who see references to Jesus only in later rabbinic literature. Johann Maier argued that neither the Mishnah nor the two Talmuds refer to Jesus.

==Etymology==
Bauckham notes that the spelling &quot;Yeshu&quot; is found on one ossuary, Rahmani 9, which supports that the name &quot;Yeshu&quot; was not invented as a way of avoiding pronouncing the name &quot;Yeshua&quot; or &quot;Yehoshua&quot; in relation to Jesus, but that it may still be that rabbinical use of &quot;Yeshu&quot; was intended to distinguish Jesus from rabbis bearing the biblical name &quot;Joshua&quot;, &quot;Yehoshua&quot;. Foote and Wheeler considered that the name &quot;Yeshu&quot; was simply a shortened form of the name &quot;Yehoshua&quot; or Joshua.

Another explanation given is that the name &quot;Yeshu&quot; is actually an acronym for the formula (&quot;&quot;), meaning &quot;may his name and memory be obliterated&quot;. There &quot;are&quot; instances in the Talmud where the name &quot;Yeshu&quot; is written with &quot;gershayim&quot;, a punctuation mark used to indicate acronyms or abbreviations, however, this only occurs in a single tractate. The earliest known example of this theory comes from medieval &quot;Toledot Yeshu&quot; narratives. This has led to the accusation, first voiced by the anti-Judaist writer Johann Andreas Eisenmenger in his &quot;Entdecktes Judenthum&quot;, that &quot;Yeshu&quot; was always such a deliberately insulting term for Jesus. Eisenmenger claimed that Jews believed that they were forbidden to mention names of false gods and instead were commanded to change and defame them and did so with Jesus&#x27; name as they considered him a false god. He argued that Jesus&#x27; original name was &quot;Yeshua&quot; and as Jews did not recognize him as saviour (&quot;moshia`&quot;) or that he had even saved (&quot;hoshia`&quot;) himself, they left out the &quot;ayin&quot; from the root meaning &quot;to save&quot;. Eisenmenger&#x27;s book against Judaism was denounced by the Jews as malicious libel, and was the subject of a number of refutations.

Early-20th-century writers such as and Klausner assume that references to &quot;Yeshu&quot; and &quot;Yeshu ha Notzri&quot; in the Talmud relate to Jesus. Indeed, in the Septuagint and Greek language Jewish texts such as the writings of Josephus and Philo of Alexandria, &quot;Jesus&quot; is the standard Greek translation of the common Hebrew name &quot;Yehoshua&quot; (Joshua), Greek having lost the &quot;h&quot; sound, as well as of the shortened form &quot;Yeshua&quot; which originated in the Second Temple period. &quot;Jesus&quot; was also used for the name &quot;Hoshea&quot; in the Septuagint in one of the three places where it referred to Joshua son of Nun.) The term &quot;Yeshu&quot; is not undisputedly attested prior to the Talmud and Tosefta, let alone as a Hebrew original for &quot;Jesus&quot;. (In the case of the Jesus of Christianity, Clement of Alexandria and St. Cyril of Jerusalem claimed that the Greek form itself was his original name and that it was not a transliteration of a Hebrew form.) Adolf Neubauer (19th century), aware of the problem but believing the term to be a reference to Jesus, argued that it was a shortened form of &quot;Yeshua&quot; resulting from the final letter &quot;ayin&quot; no longer being pronounced. Hugh J. Schonfield argued in a similar fashion that it was the northern pronunciation resulting from a silent &quot;ayin&quot;. This view was shared by Joachim Jeremias and who argue that it was the Galilean pronunciation. The views of these theological scholars however are contradicted by the studies of Hebrew and Aramaic philologist E. Y. Kutscher, Professor of Hebrew Philology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and member of the Hebrew Language Academy, who noted that although the &quot;ayin&quot; became a silent letter it is never dropped from written forms nor is its effect on the preceding vowel lost (the change of the &quot;u&quot; to the diphthong &quot;ua&quot;) as would have had to occur if &quot;Yeshu&quot; were derived from &quot;Yeshua&quot; in such a manner. Kutscher noted moreover that the guttural &quot;ayin&quot; was still pronounced in most parts of Galilee.

==Talmud and Tosefta==
The earliest undisputed occurrences of the term Yeshu are found in five anecdotes in the Tosefta (&quot;c&quot; 200 CE) and Babylonian Talmud (&quot;c&quot; 500 CE). The anecdotes appear in the Babylonian Talmud during the course of broader discussions on various religious or legal topics. The Venice edition of the Jerusalem Talmud contains the name Yeshu, but the Leiden manuscript has a name deleted, and &quot;Yeshu&quot; added in a marginal gloss. writes that due to this, Neusner treats the name as a gloss and omitted it from his translation of the Jerusalem Talmud.

===The Talmudic accounts in detail===

====Yeshu ben Pandera====

In the Tosefta, &quot;Chullin&quot; 2:22-24 there are two anecdotes about the &quot;min&quot; (heretic) named Jacob naming his mentor &quot;Yeshu ben Pandera&quot; (Yeshu son of Pandera).

*&quot;Chullin&quot; 2:22-23 tells how Rabbi Eleazar ben Damma was bitten by a snake. Jacob came to heal him (according to Lieberman&#x27;s text) &quot;on behalf of Yeshu ben Pandera&quot;. (A variant text of the Tosefta considered by Herford reads &quot;Yeshua&quot; instead of &quot;Yeshu&quot;. This together with anomalous spellings of Pandera were found by Saul Lieberman who compared early manuscripts, to be erroneous attempts at correction by a copyist unfamiliar with the terms.)
:The account is also mentioned in corresponding passages of the Jerusalem Talmud (&quot;Avodah Zarah&quot; 2:2 IV.I) and Babylonian Talmud (&quot;Avodah Zarah&quot; 27b) The name Yeshu is not mentioned in the Hebrew manuscripts of these passages but reference to &quot;Jeshu ben Pandira&quot; is interpolated by Herford&#x27;s in his English paraphrasing of the Jerusalem Talmud text. Similarly the Rodkinson translation of the Babylonian Talmud account interpolates &quot;with the name of Jesus&quot;.
*&quot;Chullin&quot; 2:24 tells how Rabbi Eliezer was once arrested and charged with &quot;minuth&quot;. When the chief judge (&quot;hegemon&quot;) interrogated him, the rabbi answered that he &quot;trusted the judge.&quot; Although Rabbi Eliezer was referring to God, the judge interpreted him to be referring to the judge himself, and freed the Rabbi. The remainder of the account concerns why Rabbi Eliezer was arrested in the first place. Rabbi Akiva suggests that perhaps one of the &quot;minim&quot; had spoken a word of &quot;minuth&quot; to him and that it had pleased him. Rabbi Eliezer recalls that this was indeed the case, he had met Jacob of the town of Sakhnin in the streets of Sepphoris who spoke to him a word of &quot;minuth&quot; in the name of Yeshu ben Pandera, which had pleased him. (A variant reading used by Herford has &quot;Pantiri&quot; instead of &quot;Pandera&quot;.)
*&quot;Avodah Zarah&quot;, 16b-17a in the Babylonian Talmud essentially repeats the account of &quot;Chullin&quot; 2:24 about Rabbi Eliezer and adds additional material. It tells that Jacob quoted Deuteronomy 23:19: &quot;You shall not bring the fee of a whore or the price of a dog into the house of the Lord your God in fulfillment of any vow.&quot; Jacob says that he was taught this by Yeshu. Jacob then asked Eliezer whether it was permissible to use a whore&#x27;s money to build a retiring place for the High Priest? (Who spent the whole night preceding the Day of Atonement in the precincts of the Temple, where due provision had to be made for all his conveniences.) When Rabbi Eliezer did not reply, Jacob quoted Micah 1:7, &quot;For they were amassed from whores&#x27; fees and they shall become whores&#x27; fees again.&quot; This was the teaching that had pleased Rabbi Eliezer.

The surname ben Pandera is not found in the Talmud account. (Rodkinson&#x27;s translation drawing on the Tosefta account paraphrases the reference to Yeshu having taught Jacob by &quot;so taught Jeshu b. Panthyra&quot;, in this case not translating &quot;Yeshu&quot; as &quot;Jesus&quot;.) The name is found again in the Midrashic text &quot;Kohelet Rabba&quot; 10:5 where a healer of the grandson of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi is described as being of ben Pandera. The source of this account is &quot;Shabbat&quot; 14:4-8 and &quot;Avodah Zarah&quot; 40 in the Jerusalem Talmud, but there ben Pandera is not mentioned. The word &quot;Yeshu&quot; is however found as a secondary marginal gloss to the first passage in the Leiden manuscript which together with the Midrashic version show that the account was understood to be about a follower of Yeshu ben Pandera. (Herford again takes liberty and adds &quot;in the name of Jeshu Pandera&quot; to his translation of the Talmud passages despite these words not being in the original text. Schäfer similarly provides a paraphrased translation mentioning &quot;Jesus son of Pandera&quot; which he admittedly has constructed himself by combining the Talmudic and Midrashic texts and the marginal glosses.) &quot;Kohelet Rabba&quot; also relates the account of Rabbi Eliezer (&quot;Kohelet Rabba&quot; 1:24) in this case some copies mention &quot;Yeshu ben Pandera&quot; as in the Tosefta passage but others instead read &quot;peloni&quot; a placeholder name equivalent to English &quot;so-and-so&quot;.

Jeffrey Rubenstein has argued that the accounts in &quot;Chullin&quot; and &quot;Avodah Zarah&quot; reveal an ambivalent relationship between rabbis and Christianity. In his view the tosefta account reveals that at least some Jews believed Christians were true healers, but that the rabbis saw this belief as a major threat. Concerning the Babylonian Talmud account in &quot;Avoda Zarah&quot;, Dr. Boyarin views Jacob of Sechania as a Christian preacher and understands Rabbi Eliezer&#x27;s arrest for minuth as an arrest by the Romans for practising Christianity (the text uses the word for heretic). When the Governor (the text uses the word for chief judge) interrogated him, the rabbi answered that he &quot;trusted the judge.&quot; Boyarin has suggested that this was the Jewish version of the Br&#x27;er Rabbit approach to domination, which he contrasts to the strategy of many early Christians, who proclaim their beliefs in spite of the consequences (i.e. martyrdom). Although Rabbi Eliezer was referring to God, the Governor interpreted him to be referring to the Governor himself, and freed the rabbi. According to them the account also reveals that there was greater contact between Christians and Jews in the 2nd century than commonly believed. They view the account of the teaching of Yeshu as an attempt to mock Christianity. According to Dr. Rubenstein, the structure of this teaching, in which a biblical prooftext is used to answer a question about Biblical law, is common to both the rabbis and early Christians. The vulgar content, however, may have been used to parody Christian values. Dr. Boyarin considers the text to be an acknowledgment that rabbis often interacted with Christians, despite their doctrinal antipathy.

A medieval account of Jesus, in which Jesus is described as being the son of Joseph, the son of Pandera (see translation of the 15th-century Yemenite manuscript: ), gives a contemporary view of Jesus and where he is portrayed as an impostor.

=====Meaning and etymology of Pandera=====
The meaning and etymology of this name are uncertain. Besides the form Pandera, variations have been found in different Tosefta manuscripts for example &quot;Pantiri&quot; and &quot;Pantera&quot;. Saul Lieberman&#x27;s investigation of Tosefta variations revealed Pandera to be the original form. (Some authors such as Herford spell it &quot;Pandira&quot; in English.)

Celsus in his discourse &quot;The True Word&quot; gives the name as &quot;Panthera&quot; in Greek. This name is not known from any graves or inscriptions, but the surname Pantera (a Latin rendering) is known from the 1st-century tombstone of Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera. Origen (c. 248 CE) responded to Celsus&#x27; claim by saying that &quot;Pantheras&quot; was the patronymic of Joseph the husband of Mary on account of his father, Jacob, being called Panther. An alternative claim was made in the &quot;Teaching of Jacob&quot; (634 CE) where Panther is said to be the grandfather of Mary. Friedrich August Nitzsch (1840) suggested that the name may refer to a panther being a lustful animal and thus have the meaning of &quot;whore&quot;, additionally being a pun on &quot;parthenos&quot; meaning virgin. Herford also considered the Greek &quot;pentheros&quot; meaning father-in-law, however he dismissed all of these forms including Celsus&#x27; &quot;Panthera&quot; as spurious explanations of the Hebrew Pandera as they do not match phonetically. He noted that Hebrew would have represented the sounds correctly if any of these were the origin. The interpolated form &quot;Panthyra&quot; appearing in the Rodkinson translation of the Talmud suffers the same problem.

Neubauer understand the name to be Pandareus. The &quot;Toledot Yeshu&quot; narratives contain elements resembling the story of Pandareus in Greek mythology, namely stealing from a temple and the presence of a bronze animal.

Robert Eisler considered the name to be derived from Pandaros. He also argued that it may not have been a real name but instead as a generic name for a betrayer. He notes that in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Pandaros betrays the Greeks and breaks a truce confirmed by solemn oath. He argues that the name came to be used as a generic term for a betrayer and was borrowed by Hebrew. The name is indeed found in &quot;Genesis Rabba 50&quot; in the expression &quot;qol Pandar&quot; (literally &quot;voice of Pandaros&quot; denoting false promises of a betrayer) used as a derogatory placeholder name for a judge of Sodom. The &quot;-a&quot; at the end of the form Pandera can be understood to be the Aramaic definite article.

====Yeshu Ha-Notzri====
In the surviving pre-censorship Talmud manuscripts, &quot;Yeshu&quot; is sometimes followed by the epithet &quot;Ha-Notzri&quot;. R. Travers Herford, Joseph Klausner and others translated it as &quot;the Nazarene&quot;. The term does not appear consistently in the manuscripts and Menachem Meiri (1249 – c. 1310) in his commentary on the Talmud &quot;Beit HaBechirah&quot; regarded it as a late interpolation.

Klausner noted objections by other scholars on grammatical and phonetic grounds to the translation of &quot;Notzri&quot; as &quot;Nazarene&quot; meaning a person from Nazareth (Hebrew &quot;Natzrat&quot;), however the etymology of &quot;Nazarene&quot; is itself uncertain and one possibility is that it is derived from &quot;Notzri&quot; and did not mean a person from Nazareth.

In 1180 CE Maimonides in his &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;, &quot;Hilchos Melachim&quot; 11:4 briefly discusses Jesus in a passage later censored by the Church. He uses the name &quot;Yeshua&quot; for Jesus (an attested equivalent of the name unlike &quot;Yeshu&quot;) and follows it with &quot;HaNotzri&quot; showing that regardless of what meaning had been intended in the Talmudic occurrences of this term, Maimonides understood it as an equivalent of Nazarene. Late additions to the Josippon also refer to Jesus as &quot;Yeshua HaNotzri&quot; but not &quot;Yeshu HaNotzri&quot;.

Among other passages, the Talmud names &quot;Yeshu HaNotzri&quot; (Jesus the Nazarene) as a character who was sentenced by God to spend his afterlife in boiling excrement for having “mocked the words” of the Jewish sages:

====Yeshu the sorcerer====
&quot;Sanhedrin 43a&quot; relates the trial and execution of Yeshu and his five disciples. Here, Yeshu is a sorcerer who has enticed other Jews to apostasy. A herald is sent to call for witnesses in his favour for forty days before his execution. No one comes forth and in the end he is stoned and hanged on the eve of Passover. His five disciples, named Matai, Nekai, Netzer, Buni, and Todah, are then tried. Word play is made on each of their names, and they are executed. It is mentioned that excessive leniency was applied because of Yeshu&#x27;s influence with the royal government (&quot;malkhut&quot;).

In the Florence manuscript of the Talmud (1177 CE) an addition is made to &quot;Sanhedrin 43a&quot; saying that Yeshu was hanged on the eve of the Sabbath.

====Yeshu summoned by Onkelos====
In &quot;Gittin 56b, 57a&quot; a story is mentioned in which Onkelos summons up the spirit of a Yeshu who sought to harm Israel. He describes his punishment in the afterlife as boiling in excrement, but encourages Onkelos to convert to Judaism, prompting the Talmud to praise &quot;the sinners of Israel.&quot; The current standard text does not name the individual Onkelos summons, but a footnote cites a textual variant that identifies the tormented spirit as &quot;Yeshu&quot;.

====Yeshu the son who burns his food in public====
&quot;Sanhedrin 103a&quot; and &quot;Berachot 17b&quot; talk about a Yeshu who burns his food in public, possibly a reference to pagan sacrifices. The account is discussing Manasseh the king of Judah, infamous for having turned to idolatry and having persecuted the Jews (2 Kings 21). It is part of a larger discussion about three kings and four commoners excluded from paradise. These are also discussed in the Shulkhan Arukh where the son who burns his food is explicitly stated to be Manasseh.

====Yeshu the student of Joshua ben Perachiah====
In &quot;Sanhedrin 107b&quot; and &quot;Sotah 47a&quot; a Yeshu is mentioned as a student of Joshua ben Perachiah who was sent away for misinterpreting a word that in context should have been understood as referring to the inn; he instead understood it to mean the innkeeper&#x27;s wife. His teacher said &quot;Here is a nice inn&quot;, to which he replied &quot;Her eyes are crooked&quot;, to which his teacher responded &quot;Is this what you are occupied in?&quot; (This happened during their period of refuge in Egypt during the persecutions of Pharisees 88–76 BCE ordered by Alexander Jannæus. The incident is also mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud in &quot;Chagigah 2:2&quot;, but there the person in question is not given any name.) After several returns for forgiveness he mistook Perachiah&#x27;s signal to wait a moment as a signal of final rejection, and so he turned to idolatry (described by the euphemism &quot;worshipping a brick&quot;). The story ends by invoking a Mishnaic era teaching that Yeshu practised black magic, deceived and led Israel astray. This quote is seen by some as an explanation in general for the designation &quot;Yeshu&quot;.

According to Dr. Rubenstein, the account in &quot;Sanhedrin&quot; 107b recognizes the kinship between Christians and Jews, since Jesus is presented as a disciple of a prominent rabbi. But it also reflects and speaks to an anxiety fundamental to Rabbinic Judaism. Prior to the destruction of the Temple in 70, Jews were divided into different sects, each promoting different interpretations of the law. Rabbinic Judaism domesticated and internalized conflicts over the law, while vigorously condemning any sectarianism. In other words, rabbis are encouraged to disagree and argue with one another, but these activities must be carefully contained, or else they could lead to a schism. Although this story may not present a historically accurate account of Jesus&#x27; life, it does use a fiction about Jesus to communicate an important truth about the rabbis. Moreover, Rubenstein sees this story as a rebuke to overly harsh rabbis. Boyarin suggests that the rabbis were well aware of Christian views of the Pharisees and that this story acknowledges the Christian belief that Jesus was forgiving and the Pharisees were not (see Mark 2:1–2), while emphasizing forgiveness as a necessary rabbinic value.

====Ben Pandera and ben Stada====
Another title found in the Tosefta and Talmud is &quot;ben Stada&quot; (son of Stada). However, in &quot;Shabbat 104b&quot; and &quot;Sanhedrin 67a&quot; in the Babylonian Talmud, a passage is found that some have interpreted as equating ben Pandera with ben Stada. The passage is in the form of a Talmudic debate in which various voices make statements, each refuting the previous statement. In such debates the various statements and their refutations are often of a Midrashic nature, sometimes incorporating subtle humour and should not always be taken at face value. The purpose of the passage is to arrive at a Midrashic meaning for the term Stada.

&quot;Shabbat 104b&quot; relates that a ben Stada brought magic from Egypt in incisions in his flesh. &quot;Sanhedrin 67a&quot; relates that a ben-Stada was caught by hidden observers and hanged in the town of Lod on the eve of Passover. The debate then follows. It begins by asking if this was not ben Pandera rather than ben Stada. This is refuted by the claim that it is both, his mother&#x27;s husband was Stada but her lover was Pandera. This is countered with the claim the husband was Pappos ben Yehuda (a 2nd-century figure elsewhere remembered as having locked up his unfaithful wife and visiting Rabbi Akiva in jail after the Bar-Kokhba revolt) and that the mother was named Stada. This is then refuted by the claim that the mother was named Miriam, the dresser of women&#x27;s hair, but that she had gone astray from her husband (a Miriam the daughter of Bilgah, is mentioned elsewhere as having had an affair with a Roman soldier). In Aramaic, &quot;gone astray&quot; is &quot;satat da&quot;, thus a Midrashic meaning for the term Stada is obtained. Real historical relationships between the figures mentioned cannot be inferred due to the Midrashic nature of the debate. Pappos and Miriam might have been introduced simply as a result of their being remembered in connection with a theme of a woman having gone astray.

Ben-Stada is also mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud. In &quot;Shabbat 12:4 III&quot; he is mentioned as having learnt by cutting marks in his flesh. In &quot;Sanhedrin 7:12 I&quot; he is mentioned as an example of someone caught by hidden observers and subsequently stoned. This information is paralleled in the Tosefta in &quot;Shabbat 11:15&quot; and &quot;Sanhedrin 10:11&quot; respectively.

===Interpretation===

====Tannaim and Amoraim====
The Tannaim and Amoraim who recorded the accounts in the Talmud and Tosefta use the term &quot;Yeshu&quot; as a designation in &quot;Sanhedrin&quot; 103a and &quot;Berakhot&quot; 17b in place of King Manasseh&#x27;s real name. &quot;Sanhedrin&quot; 107b uses it for a Hasmonean era individual who in an earlier account (Jerusalem Talmud &quot;Chagigah&quot; 2:2) is anonymous. In &quot;Gittin&quot; 56b, 57a it is used for one of three foreign enemies of Israel, the other two being from past and present with &quot;Yeshu&quot; representing a third not identified with any past or present event.

====Early Jewish commentators (Rishonim)====
These accounts of Celsus and the &quot;Toledot Yeshu&quot; do not form part of Orthodox Jewish interpretation. The only classical Jewish commentator to equate Yeshu with Jesus was the Rishon (early commentator) Abraham Ibn Daud who held the view that the Jesus of Christianity had been derived from the figure of Yeshu the student of ben Perachiah. Ibn Daud was nevertheless aware that such an equation contradicted known chronology but argued that the Gospel accounts were in error.

Other Rishonim, namely Rabbi Jacob ben Meir (Rabbeinu Tam), Nachmanides, and Yechiel of Paris explicitly repudiated the equation of the Yeshu of the Talmud and Jesus. Menachem Meiri observed that the epithet &quot;Ha-Notzri&quot; attached to Yeshu in many instances was a late gloss.

====The Church====
Friar Raymond Martini, in his anti-Jewish polemical treatise &quot;Pugio Fidei&quot;, began the accusation echoed in numerous subsequent anti-Jewish pamphlets that the &quot;Yeshu&quot; passages were derogatory accounts of Jesus.

In 1554 a papal bull ordered the removal of all references from the Talmud and other Jewish texts deemed offensive and blasphemous to Christians. Thus the &quot;Yeshu&quot; passages were removed from subsequently published editions of the Talmud and Tosefta. Nevertheless, several church writers would refer to the passages as evidence of Jesus outside the Gospels.

====Later Jewish commentators (Acharonim)====

Jehiel Heilprin held that Yeshu the student of Yehoshua ben Perachiah was not Jesus. Jacob Emden&#x27;s writings also show an understanding that the Yeshu of the Talmud was not Jesus.

====Contemporary Orthodox scholars====
Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz translates &quot;Yeshu&quot; as &quot;Jesus&quot; in his translation of the Talmud. Elsewhere he has pointed out that Talmudic passages referring to Jesus had been deleted by the Christian censor.

====Theosophists and esotericists====
The interpretation of &quot;Yeshu&quot; as a proto-Jesus first seen in Abraham ibn Daud&#x27;s work would be revisited by Egyptologist Gerald Massey in his essay &quot;The historical Jesus and Mythical Christ&quot;, and by G. R. S. Mead in his work &quot;Did Jesus Live 100 B.C.?&quot;. The same view was reiterated by Rabbi Avraham Korman. These views reflect the theosophical stance and criticism of tradition popular at the time but was rejected by later scholars. It has been revived in recent times by Alvar Ellegård.

====Critical scholarship====
Modern critical scholars debate whether Yeshu does or does not refer to the historical Jesus, a view seen in several 20th-century encyclopedia articles including &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;, Joseph Dan in the &quot;Encyclopaedia Judaica&quot; (1972, 1997). and the &quot;Encyclopedia Hebraica&quot; (Israel). R. Travers Herford based his work on the understanding that the term refers to Jesus, and it was also the understanding of Joseph Klausner. They agree that the accounts offer little independent or accurate historical evidence about Jesus. Herford argues that writers of the Talmud and Tosefta had only vague knowledge of Jesus and embellished the accounts to discredit him while disregarding chronology. Klausner distinguishes between core material in the accounts which he argues are not about Jesus and the references to &quot;Yeshu&quot; which he sees as additions spuriously associating the accounts with Jesus. Recent scholars in the same vein include Peter Schäfer, 

Recently, some scholars have argued that Yeshu is a literary device, and that the Yeshu stories provide a more complex view of early Rabbinic-Christian interactions. Whereas the Pharisees were one sect among several others in the Second Temple era, the Amoraim and Tannaim sought to establish Rabbinic Judaism as the normative form of Judaism. Like the rabbis, early Christians claimed to be working within Biblical traditions to provide new interpretations of Jewish laws and values. The sometimes blurry boundary between the rabbis and early Christians provided an important site for distinguishing between legitimate debate and heresy. Scholars like Jeffrey Rubenstein and Daniel Boyarin argue that it was through the Yeshu narratives that rabbis confronted this blurry boundary.

According to Jeffrey Rubenstein, the account in &quot;Sanhedrin&quot; 107b recognizes the kinship between Christians and Jews, since Jesus is presented as a disciple of a prominent rabbi. But it also reflects and speaks to an anxiety fundamental to Rabbinic Judaism. Prior to the destruction of the Temple in 70, Jews were divided into different sects, each promoting different interpretations of the law. Rabbinic Judaism domesticated and internalized conflicts over the law, while vigorously condemning any sectarianism. In other words, rabbis are encouraged to disagree and argue with one another, but these activities must be carefully contained, or else they could lead to a schism. Although this story may not present a historically accurate account of Jesus&#x27; life, it does use a fiction about Jesus to communicate an important truth about the rabbis. Moreover, Rubenstein sees this story as a rebuke to overly harsh rabbis. Boyarin suggests that the rabbis were well aware of Christian views of the Pharisees and that this story acknowledges the Christian belief that Jesus was forgiving and the Pharisees were not (see Mark 2), while emphasizing forgiveness as a necessary rabbinic value.

An intermediate view is that of Hyam Maccoby, who argues that most of these stories were not originally about Jesus, but were incorporated into the Talmud in the belief that they were, as a response to Christian missionary activity.

====Skeptical writers====
Dennis McKinsey has challenged the view that the term refers to Jesus at all and argues that Jewish tradition knew of no historical Jesus. Similar views have been expressed by skeptical science writer Frank R. Zindler in his polemical work &quot;The Jesus the Jews Never Knew: Sepher Toldoth Yeshu and the Quest of the Historical Jesus in Jewish Sources&quot;, deliberately published outside the realm of Christian and Jewish scholarship.

====Points on which writers have differed====
Writers have thus differed on several distinct but closely related questions:
*whether Yeshu was intended to mean Jesus or not (e.g. Herford vs Nahmanides)
*whether the core material in the accounts regardless of the name was originally about Jesus or not (e.g. Herford vs Klausner)
*whether the core material is derivative of Christian accounts of Jesus, a forerunner of such accounts or unrelated (e.g. Herford vs Ibn Daud vs McKinsey)
*whether Yeshu is a real name or an acronym (e.g. Flusser vs Kjaer-Hansen)
*whether Yeshu is a genuine Hebrew equivalent for the name Jesus, a pun on the name Jesus or unrelated to the name Jesus (e.g. Klausner vs Eisenmenger vs McKinsey)

==The Toledot Yeshu==

The &quot;Toledot Yeshu&quot; are not part of rabbinic literature and are considered neither canonical nor normative. There is no one authoritative &quot;Toledot Yeshu&quot; story; rather, various medieval versions existed that differ in attitudes towards the central characters and in story details. It is considered unlikely that any one person wrote it, and each version seems to be from a different set of storytellers. In these manuscripts, the name &quot;Yeshu&quot; is used as designation of the central character. The stories typically understand the name &quot;Yeshu&quot; to be the acronym &quot;&quot;, but justify its usage by claiming that it is wordplay on his real name, Yehoshua (i.e. Joshua, a Hebrew equivalent of &quot;Jesus&quot;). The story is set in the Hasmonean era, reflecting the setting of the account of Yeshu the student of Yehoshuah ben Perachiah in the Talmud. Due to the Gospel parallels, the Toledot Yeshu narratives are typically viewed as a derogatory account of the life of Jesus resulting from Jewish reaction to persecution by Christians.

==Other occurrences==
The name Yeshu has also been found on the 1st-century CE ossuary of a &quot;Yeshua bar Yehoseph&quot;, published by E. L. Sukenik in 1931, and catalogued by L. Y. Rahmani in 1994. Although Sukenik considered this the same as the term in the Talmud, he also entertained the possibility that the final letter &quot;ayin&quot; was left out due to lack of space between the decorations between which it was inscribed. The fully spelled out name &quot;Yeshua&quot; and the patronymic are also found on the ossuary. Richard Bauckham considers this a legitimate, if rare, form of the name in use at the time, and writes that this ossuary shows that the name Yeshu &quot;was not invented by the rabbis as a way of avoiding pronouncing the real name of Jesus of Nazareth&quot;.

The name Yeshu has also been found in a fragment of the Jerusalem Talmud from the Cairo Genizah, a depository for holy texts which are not usable due to age, damage or errors. Flusser takes this as evidence of the term being a name; however, the standard text of the Jerusalem Talmud refers to one of the numerous Rabbi &quot;Yehoshua&quot;s of the Talmud and moreover the fragment has the latter name at other points in the text.

Yeshu is also mentioned in Isaac Luria&#x27;s &quot;Book of the Reincarnations&quot;, chapter 37. Within the long list of Jewish Tzadiks it is written:

A similar legend was reported by a Spanish monk when he visited Safed in 1555, with the difference in that the place was not where he was buried but where he hid.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.zadikim.com/?catID=70766&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in modern Hebrew as a name for Jesus==
The term &quot;Yeshu&quot; was used in Hebrew texts in the Middle Ages then through Rahabi Ezekiel (1750) and Elias Soloweyczyk (1869) who identified Jesus with the character of the Toledoth Yeshu narratives. Likewise &quot;Yeshu Ha-Notzri&quot; is the modern Hebrew equivalent for &quot;Jesus the Nazarene&quot; although in Christian texts the spellings &quot;Yeshua&quot; (i.e. &quot;Joshua&quot;) and &quot;Yeshua Ha-Notzri&quot; are preferred, as per the Hebrew New Testaments of Franz Delitzsch (BFBS 1875) and Isaac Salkinsohn (TBS 1886). In Israeli Hebrew &quot;Yeshu&quot; is used for Jesus of Nazareth as in Aaron Abraham Kabak&#x27;s novel &quot;On the narrow path&quot; &quot;Ba-Mishcol Ha-Tsar&quot; (1937). As with Bauckham&#x27;s observation of medieval sources, the name Yeshu is still never applied to any of the other Joshuas in modern Hebrew, and lexicographers such as Reuben Alcalay distinguish &quot;Yeshua&quot; (&quot;Joshua&quot;) and &quot;Yeshu&quot; (&quot;Jesus&quot;).

<text>Keimyung University (), abbreviated as KMU or Keimyung (), is a private university located in Daegu, the fourth largest city in South Korea. The university was founded in 1954 with the support of the leaders of the Northern Presbyterian Church of the U.S. as a Christian university. KMU is composed of three campuses in the city of Daegu, South Korea. They are named for their locations within the city; Daemyeong, which is near the downtown area, Seongseo, which is in the western part of the city, and also Dongsan campus which includes Dongsan Medical Center.

Keimyung University has relationships with more than 400 research and educational organizations worldwide as well as one of the largest communities of international professors in South Korea.

==History==
Keimyung University originated from Keimyung Christian College, which was founded in 1954, by Reverend Edward Adams, an American missionary of the Northern Presbyterian Church of the U.S., and by Reverends Choi Jaehwa and Kang Ingu, two local Presbyterian Church leaders. The founding principle guiding their concerted efforts was to provide Koreans with higher education firmly anchored in Christianity. 1978, the year of Keimyung&#x27;s elevation to the status of a university, marked the beginning of a new period of rapid development. In October 1980, the university acquired Dongsan Hospital, a prestigious local hospital with 81-year history of service, and re-opened it as Keimyung University Medical Center. The development of Keimyung acquired a new dimension in the early 1980s when it added a new campus built on 550,000 pyeong (181,500 sq. meters) at Seongseo in Sindang-dong, Dalseo-gu, to its existing Daemyeong and Dongsan campuses.

==Facilities==

===Dormitory===

===Dongsan Library===

The Dongsan Library, originally known as the Library of Keimyung Christian College, was established in July 1958. It was moved to its current site at the Seongseo Campus in March 1993 to facilitate expansion into a much larger facility that meets the needs of the information age. The Dongsan Library comprises three separate libraries: the main Dongsan Library at Seongseo Campus (seven stories above and two below ground level, with a total floor space of 6,538 pyeong), the second Dongsan Library at the Daemyung Dong Campus (seven stories above and two below ground level, with a total floor space of 5,392 pyeong) and the Medical Library at Dongsan Medical Center. Equipped with multi-media functions and an advanced information retrieval network, the Dongsan Library is now the focal point for research activities of faculty members as well as students. At present, the Dongsan Library houses around one and a half- million books, including specialized reference books, scientific journals, theses, ancient documents, micro-data, CD-ROMs and multi-media materials. The information or data owned by the Dongsan Library is made available for users around the world through the Keimyung University Library Integrated Information Management System (KIMS).

===Dongsan Medical Center===
Keimyung University Dongsan Medical Center consists of a medical school, Dongsan hospital, and Gyeongju Dongsan hospital. The history of the medical center began when American Presbyterian missionary Dr. Woodbridge O. Johnson arrived to Daegu on December 25, 1897. Two years later, in 1899, he turned a small cottage that used to be occupied by servants into what he named American Pharmacy, and began to distribute medicine to local people. This was the first modern medical service provided in Daegu. Subsequently, he ordered medicine from the US and began to offer treatment full-time, under the name Jaejungwon. In 1906 Jaejungwon was relocated to its current address in Dongsandong, and was renamed Dongsan Hospital. In 1980 Keimyung University acquired Dongsan Hospital, renamed it Keimyung University Dongsan Medical Center, and established a medical school. Currently, the medical center has over 1000 patient beds and over 1700 employees. Due to the acquisition of the medical center, Keimyung University now regards its foundation to be in 1899. 

===Hengso Museum===
Since it was established on May 20, 1978, the Museum has devoted its efforts to studying the historical and cultural heritage of the local region with a special focus on Kaya, an ancient civilization that once flourished in Korea, but which left few records. Since then, the museum has accomplished much, including the excavation of the royal tombs of the Kaya Dynasty.Many Kaya artifacts uncovered through those efforts are on display in the Museum. Currently, a plan is under way to construct a new museum on a 9,900 square-meter site with a total floor space of 5,940 square meters. The opening is scheduled for May 2004, which will also mark the 50th anniversary of the university. The new museum building will feature a university history gallery, Korean history gallery, curatorial department, a conservation science laboratory, and other accommodations including a museum shop and a café.

===Edward Adams Hall of Worship and Praise (Adams Chapel)===

Located high on the flank of Kungsan Hill above the Seongseo Campus of Keimyung University, the Edward Adams Hall of Worship and Praise (known as the Adams Chapel) was built to honor the achievements of missionary Edward Adams, one of the founders of Keimyung University. The Adams Hall of Worship and Praise has three towers on the facade and a central domed tower. Those three towers in front (the two to the right of the center and one to the left) represent Keimyung University&#x27;s educational precept, &quot;truth&quot;, &quot;justice&quot;, and &quot;love&quot;, and the central dome represents &quot;the Kingdom of God&quot;. The seven round columns in the main chapel represent the 7 early churches in Asia referred to in the Book of Revelation in the New Testament. In the main chapel there is a beautiful pipe organ built by the Karl Schuke company of Germany. On the front of the organ are three crowns, underneath each of which are arranged seven pipes. These represent the Holy Trinity, as well as the seven angels with seven trumpets as recorded in the Book of Revelation. In addition, the Adams Chapel has over 160 stained glass windows of various sizes. The stained glass window depict the twelve disciples of Christ, the three Wise Men, the Ten Commandments, the judgement of Solomon and other stories from the Bible. The pipe organ, the stained glass, the chapel chairs, and the marble of the columns of the Adams Chapel were all made through the generous donation from the friendly Keimyung University.

===International Lounge===

The Keimyung University International Lounge (KMUIL) is a self-access learning center that opened in March 2005. It serves as a hub for promoting independent learning and meaningful engagement, fostering interactions among students, faculty, staff, and the wider community. The lounge offers a comprehensive range of language and cultural programs for both Korean and international students, as well as community outreach initiatives designed for local middle and high school students and senior citizens. In 2018, the space was expanded and remodeled to accommodate a greater number of visitors.

<text>An expression vector, otherwise known as an expression construct, is usually a plasmid or virus designed for gene expression in cells. The vector is used to introduce a specific gene into a target cell, and can commandeer the cell&#x27;s mechanism for protein synthesis to produce the protein encoded by the gene. Expression vectors are the basic tools in biotechnology for the production of proteins.

The vector is engineered to contain regulatory sequences that act as enhancer and promoter regions and lead to efficient transcription of the gene carried on the expression vector. The goal of a well-designed expression vector is the efficient production of protein, and this may be achieved by the production of significant amount of stable messenger RNA, which can then be translated into protein. The expression of a protein may be tightly controlled, and the protein is only produced in significant quantity when necessary through the use of an inducer. In some systems, however, the protein may be expressed constitutively. &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; is commonly used as the host for protein production, but other cell types may also be used. An example of the use of expression vector is the production of insulin, which is used for medical treatments of diabetes.

==Elements==

An expression vector has features that any vector may have, such as an origin of replication, a selectable marker, and a suitable site for the insertion of a gene like the multiple cloning site. The cloned gene may be transferred from a specialized cloning vector to an expression vector, although it is possible to clone directly into an expression vector. The cloning process is normally performed in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. Vectors used for protein production in organisms other than &quot;E.coli&quot; may have, in addition to a suitable origin of replication for its propagation in &quot;E. coli&quot;, elements that allow them to be maintained in another organism, and these vectors are called shuttle vectors.

===Elements for expression===

An expression vector must have elements necessary for gene expression. These may include a promoter, the correct translation initiation sequence such as a ribosomal binding site and start codon, a termination codon, and a transcription termination sequence. There are differences in the machinery for protein synthesis between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, therefore the expression vectors must have the elements for expression that are appropriate for the chosen host. For example, prokaryotes expression vectors would have a Shine-Dalgarno sequence at its translation initiation site for the binding of ribosomes, while eukaryotes expression vectors would contain the Kozak consensus sequence.

The promoter initiates the transcription and is therefore the point of control for the expression of the cloned gene. The promoters used in expression vector are normally inducible, meaning that protein synthesis is only initiated when required by the introduction of an inducer such as IPTG. Gene expression however may also be constitutive (i.e. protein is constantly expressed) in some expression vectors. Low level of constitutive protein synthesis may occur even in expression vectors with tightly controlled promoters.

===Protein tags===

After the expression of the gene product, it may be necessary to purify the expressed protein; however, separating the protein of interest from the great majority of proteins of the host cell can be a protracted process. To make this purification process easier, a purification tag may be added to the cloned gene. This tag could be histidine (His) tag, other marker peptides, or a fusion partners such as glutathione S-transferase or maltose-binding protein. Some of these fusion partners may also help to increase the solubility of some expressed proteins. Other fusion proteins such as green fluorescent protein may act as a reporter gene for the identification of successful cloned genes, or they may be used to study protein expression in cellular imaging.

===Other Elements===
The expression vector is transformed or transfected into the host cell for protein synthesis. Some expression vectors may have elements for transformation or the insertion of DNA into the host chromosome, for example the &quot;vir&quot; genes for plant transformation, and integrase sites for chromosomal integration .

Some vectors may include targeting sequence that may target the expressed protein to a specific location such as the periplasmic space of bacteria.

==Expression/Production systems==
Different organisms may be used to express a gene&#x27;s target protein, and the expression vector used will therefore have elements specific for use in the particular organism. The most commonly used organism for protein production is the bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. However, not all proteins can be successfully expressed in &quot;E. coli&quot;, or be expressed with the correct form of post-translational modifications such as glycosylations, and other systems may therefore be used.

===Bacterial===

The expression host of choice for the expression of many proteins is &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; as the production of heterologous protein in &quot;E. coli&quot; is relatively simple and convenient, as well as being rapid and cheap. A large number of &quot;E. coli&quot; expression plasmids are also available for a wide variety of needs. Other bacteria used for protein production include &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;.

Most heterologous proteins are expressed in the cytoplasm of &quot;E. coli&quot;. However, not all proteins formed may be soluble in the cytoplasm, and incorrectly folded proteins formed in cytoplasm can form insoluble aggregates called inclusion bodies. Such insoluble proteins will require refolding, which can be an involved process and may not necessarily produce high yield. Proteins which have disulphide bonds are often not able to fold correctly due to the reducing environment in the cytoplasm which prevents such bond formation, and a possible solution is to target the protein to the periplasmic space by the use of an N-terminal signal sequence. Another possibility is to manipulate the redox environment of the cytoplasm. Other more sophisticated systems are also being developed; such systems may allow for the expression of proteins previously thought impossible in &quot;E. coli&quot;, such as glycosylated proteins.

The promoters used for these vector are usually based on the promoter of the &quot;lac&quot; operon or the T7 promoter, and they are normally regulated by the &quot;lac&quot; operator. These promoters may also be hybrids of different promoters, for example, the Tac-Promoter is a hybrid of &quot;trp&quot; and &quot;lac&quot; promoters. Note that most commonly used &quot;lac&quot; or &quot;lac&quot;-derived promoters are based on the &quot;lac&quot;UV5 mutant which is insensitive to catabolite repression. This mutant allows for expression of protein under the control of the &quot;lac&quot; promoter when the growth medium contains glucose since glucose would inhibit gene expression if wild-type &quot;lac&quot; promoter is used. Presence of glucose nevertheless may still be used to reduce background expression through residual inhibition in some systems.

Examples of &quot;E. coli&quot; expression vectors are the pGEX series of vectors where glutathione S-transferase is used as a fusion partner and gene expression is under the control of the tac promoter, and the pET series of vectors which uses a T7 promoter.

It is possible to simultaneously express two or more different proteins in &quot;E. coli&quot; using different plasmids. However, when 2 or more plasmids are used, each plasmid needs to use a different antibiotic selection as well as a different origin of replication, otherwise one of the plasmids may not be stably maintained. Many commonly used plasmids are based on the ColE1 replicon and are therefore incompatible with each other; in order for a ColE1-based plasmid to coexist with another in the same cell, the other would need to be of a different replicon, e.g. a p15A replicon-based plasmid such as the pACYC series of plasmids. Another approach would be to use a single two-cistron vector or design the coding sequences in tandem as a bi- or poly-cistronic construct.

===Yeast===
A yeast commonly used for protein production is &quot;Pichia pastoris&quot;. Examples of yeast expression vector in &quot;Pichia&quot; are the pPIC series of vectors, and these vectors use the AOX1 promoter which is inducible with methanol. The plasmids may contain elements for insertion of foreign DNA into the yeast genome and signal sequence for the secretion of expressed protein. Proteins with disulphide bonds and glycosylation can be efficiently produced in yeast. Another yeast used for protein production is &quot;Kluyveromyces lactis&quot; and the gene is expressed, driven by a variant of the strong lactase LAC4 promoter.

&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; is particularly widely used for gene expression studies in yeast, for example in yeast two-hybrid system for the study of protein-protein interaction. The vectors used in yeast two-hybrid system contain fusion partners for two cloned genes that allow the transcription of a reporter gene when there is interaction between the two proteins expressed from the cloned genes.

===Baculovirus===
Baculovirus, a rod-shaped virus which infects insect cells, is used as the expression vector in this system. Insect cell lines derived from Lepidopterans (moths and butterflies), such as &quot;Spodoptera frugiperda&quot;, are used as host. A cell line derived from the cabbage looper is of particular interest, as it has been developed to grow fast and without the expensive serum normally needed to boost cell growth. The shuttle vector is called bacmid, and gene expression is under the control of a strong promoter pPolh. Baculovirus has also been used with mammalian cell lines in the BacMam system.

Baculovirus is normally used for production of glycoproteins, although the glycosylations may be different from those found in vertebrates. In general, it is safer to use than mammalian virus as it has a limited host range and does not infect vertebrates without modifications.

===Plant===
Many plant expression vectors are based on the Ti plasmid of &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot;. In these expression vectors, DNA to be inserted into plant is cloned into the T-DNA, a stretch of DNA flanked by a 25-bp direct repeat sequence at either end, and which can integrate into the plant genome. The T-DNA also contains the selectable marker. The &quot;Agrobacterium&quot; provides a mechanism for transformation, integration of into the plant genome, and the promoters for its &quot;vir&quot; genes may also be used for the cloned genes. Concerns over the transfer of bacterial or viral genetic material into the plant however have led to the development of vectors called intragenic vectors whereby functional equivalents of plant genome are used so that there is no transfer of genetic material from an alien species into the plant.

Plant viruses may be used as vectors since the &quot;Agrobacterium&quot; method does not work for all plants. Examples of plant virus used are the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), potato virus X, and cowpea mosaic virus. The protein may be expressed as a fusion to the coat protein of the virus and is displayed on the surface of assembled viral particles, or as an unfused protein that accumulates within the plant. Expression in plant using plant vectors is often constitutive, and a commonly used constitutive promoter in plant expression vectors is the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter.

===Mammalian===
Mammalian expression vectors offer considerable advantages for the expression of mammalian proteins over bacterial expression systems - proper folding, post-translational modifications, and relevant enzymatic activity. It may also be more desirable than other eukaryotic non-mammalian systems whereby the proteins expressed may not contain the correct glycosylations. It is of particular use in producing membrane-associating proteins that require chaperones for proper folding and stability as well as containing numerous post-translational modifications. The downside, however, is the low yield of product in comparison to prokaryotic vectors as well as the costly nature of the techniques involved. Its complicated technology, and potential contamination with animal viruses of mammalian cell expression have also placed a constraint on its use in large-scale industrial production.

Cultured mammalian cell lines such as the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), COS, including human cell lines such as HEK and HeLa may be used to produce protein. Vectors are transfected into the cells and the DNA may be integrated into the genome by homologous recombination in the case of stable transfection, or the cells may be transiently transfected. Examples of mammalian expression vectors include the adenoviral vectors, the pSV and the pCMV series of plasmid vectors, vaccinia and retroviral vectors, as well as baculovirus. The promoters for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and SV40 are commonly used in mammalian expression vectors to drive gene expression. Non-viral promoter, such as the elongation factor (EF)-1 promoter, is also known.

===Cell-free systems===
&quot;E. coli&quot; cell lysate containing the cellular components required for transcription and translation are used in this &quot;in vitro&quot; method of protein production. The advantage of such system is that protein may be produced much faster than those produced &quot;in vivo&quot; since it does not require time to culture the cells, but it is also more expensive. Vectors used for &quot;E. coli&quot; expression can be used in this system although specifically designed vectors for this system are also available. Eukaryotic cell extracts may also be used in other cell-free systems, for example, the wheat germ cell-free expression systems. Mammalian cell-free systems have also been produced.

==Applications==

===Laboratory use===
Expression vector in an expression host is now the usual method used in laboratories to produce proteins for research. Most proteins are produced in &quot;E. coli&quot;, but for glycosylated proteins and those with disulphide bonds, yeast, baculovirus and mammalian systems may be used.

===Production of peptide and protein pharmaceuticals===
Most protein pharmaceuticals are now produced through recombinant DNA technology using expression vectors. These peptide and protein pharmaceuticals may be hormones, vaccines, antibiotics, antibodies, and enzymes. The first human recombinant protein used for disease management, insulin, was introduced in 1982. Biotechnology allows these peptide and protein pharmaceuticals, some of which were previously rare or difficult to obtain, to be produced in large quantity. It also reduces the risks of contaminants such as host viruses, toxins and prions. Examples from the past include prion contamination in growth hormone extracted from pituitary glands harvested from human cadavers, which caused Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease in patients receiving treatment for dwarfism, and viral contaminants in clotting factor VIII isolated from human blood that resulted in the transmission of viral diseases such as hepatitis and AIDS. Such risk is reduced or removed completely when the proteins are produced in non-human host cells.

===Transgenic plant and animals===

In recent years, expression vectors have been used to introduce specific genes into plants and animals to produce transgenic organisms, for example in agriculture it is used to produce transgenic plants. Expression vectors have been used to introduce a vitamin A precursor, beta-carotene, into rice plants. This product is called golden rice. This process has also been used to introduce a gene into plants that produces an insecticide, called Bacillus thuringiensis toxin or Bt toxin which reduces the need for farmers to apply insecticides since it is produced by the modified organism. In addition expression vectors are used to extend the ripeness of tomatoes by altering the plant so that it produces less of the chemical that causes the tomatoes to rot. There have been controversies over using expression vectors to modify crops due to the fact that there might be unknown health risks, possibilities of companies patenting certain genetically modified food crops, and ethical concerns. Nevertheless, this technique is still being used and heavily researched.

Transgenic animals have also been produced to study animal biochemical processes and human diseases, or used to produce pharmaceuticals and other proteins. They may also be engineered to have advantageous or useful traits. Green fluorescent protein is sometimes used as tags which results in animal that can fluoresce, and this have been exploited commercially to produce the fluorescent GloFish.

===Gene therapy===

Gene therapy is a promising treatment for a number of diseases where a &quot;normal&quot; gene carried by the vector is inserted into the genome, to replace an &quot;abnormal&quot; gene or supplement the expression of particular gene. Viral vectors are generally used but other nonviral methods of delivery are being developed. The treatment is still a risky option due to the viral vector used which can cause ill-effects, for example giving rise to insertional mutation that can result in cancer. However, there have been promising results.

<doc id="564384" wikidata="Q199301" url="?curid=564384" title="Clock face">
<text>A clock face is the part of an analog clock (or watch) that displays time through the use of a flat [[dial (measurement)|dial]] with reference marks, and revolving pointers turning on concentric shafts at the center, called hands. In its most basic, globally recognized form, the periphery of the dial is numbered 1 through 12 indicating the hours in a 12-hour cycle, and a short hour hand makes two revolutions in a day. A long minute hand makes one revolution every hour. The face may also include a &quot;second hand&quot;, which makes one revolution per minute. The term is less commonly used for the time display on digital clocks and watches.

A second type of clock face is the 24-hour analog dial, widely used in military and other organizations that use 24-hour time. This is similar to the 12-hour dial above, except it has hours numbered 1–24 (or 0–23) around the outside, and the hour hand makes only one revolution per day. Some special-purpose clocks, such as timers and sporting event clocks, are designed for measuring periods less than one hour. Clocks can indicate the hour with Roman numerals or Hindu–Arabic numerals, or with non-numeric indicator marks. The two numbering systems have also been used in combination, with the prior indicating the hour and the latter the minute. Longcase clocks (grandfather clocks) typically use Roman numerals for the hours. Clocks using only Arabic numerals first began to appear in the mid-18th century. 

The clock face is so familiar that the numbers are often omitted and replaced with unlabeled graduations (marks), particularly in the case of watches. Occasionally, markings of any sort are dispensed with, and the time is read by the angles of the hands.

==Reading a modern clock face==

Most modern clocks have the numbers 1 through 12 printed at equally spaced intervals around the periphery of the face with the 12 at the top, indicating the hour, and on many models, sixty dots or lines evenly spaced in a ring around the outside of the dial, indicating minutes and seconds. The time is read by observing the placement of several &quot;hands&quot;, which emanate from the centre of the dial:

* A short, thick &quot;hour&quot; hand;
* A long, thinner &quot;minute&quot; hand;
* On some models, a very thin &quot;second&quot; or &quot;sweep&quot; hand

All three hands continuously rotate around the dial in a clockwise direction – in the direction of increasing numbers.

* The second, or sweep, hand moves relatively quickly, taking a full minute (sixty seconds) to make a complete rotation from 12 to 12. For every rotation of the second hand, the minute hand will move from one minute mark to the next.
* The minute hand rotates more slowly around the dial. It takes one hour (sixty minutes) to make a complete rotation from 12 to 12. For every rotation of the minute hand, the hour hand will move from one hour mark to the next.
* The hour hand moves slowest of all, taking half a day (twelve hours) to make a complete rotation. It starts from &quot;12&quot; at midnight, makes one rotation until it is pointing at &quot;12&quot; again at noon, and then makes another rotation until it is pointing at &quot;12&quot; again at midnight of the next morning.

==Historical development==
The word &quot;clock&quot; derives from the medieval Latin word for &quot;bell&quot;; , and has cognates in many European languages. Clocks spread to England from the Low Countries, so the English word came from the Middle Low German and Middle Dutch &quot;Klocke&quot;. The first mechanical clocks, built in 13th-century Europe, were striking clocks: their purpose was to ring bells upon the canonical hours, to call the local community to prayer. These were tower clocks installed in bell towers in public places, to ensure that the bells were audible over a wide area. Soon after these first mechanical clocks were in place clockmakers realized that their wheels could be used to drive an indicator on a dial on the outside of the tower, where it could be widely seen, so the local population could tell the time between the hourly strikes.

Before the late 14th century, a fixed hand (often a carving literally shaped like a hand) indicated the hour by pointing to numbers on a rotating dial; after this time, the current convention of a rotating hand on a fixed dial was adopted. Minute hands (so named because they indicated the small, or &quot;minute&quot;, divisions of the hour) only came into regular use around 1690, after the invention of the pendulum and anchor escapement increased the precision of time-telling enough to justify it. In some precision clocks, a third hand, which rotated once a minute, was added in a separate subdial. This was called the &quot;second-minute&quot; hand (because it measured the &quot;secondary minute&quot; divisions of the hour), which was shortened to &quot;second&quot; hand. The convention of the hands moving clockwise evolved in imitation of the sundial. In the Northern hemisphere, where the clock face originated, the shadow of the gnomon on a horizontal sundial moves clockwise during the day. 

===French decimal time===


During the French Revolution in 1793, in connection with its Republican calendar, France attempted to introduce a decimal time system. This had 10 decimal hours in the day, 100 decimal minutes per hour, and 100 decimal seconds per minute. Therefore, the decimal hour was more than twice as long (144 min) as the present hour, the decimal minute was slightly longer than the present minute (86.4 seconds) and the decimal second was slightly shorter (0.864 sec) than the present second. Clocks were manufactured with this alternate face, usually combined with traditional hour markings. However, it did not catch on, and France discontinued the mandatory use of decimal time on 7 April 1795, although some French cities used decimal time until 1801.

==Stylistic development==
Until the last quarter of the 17th century, hour markings were etched into metal faces and the recesses filled with black wax. Subsequently, higher contrast and improved readability was achieved with white enamel plaques painted with black numbers. Initially, the numbers were printed on small, individual plaques mounted on a brass substructure. This was not a stylistic decision, rather enamel production technology had not yet achieved the ability to create large pieces of enamel. The &quot;13-piece face&quot; was an early attempt to create an entirely white enamel face. As the name suggests, it was composed of 13 enamel plaques: 12 numbered wedges fitted around a circle. The first single-piece enamel faces, not unlike those in production today, began to appear .

It is customary for modern advertisements to display clocks and watches set to approximately 10:10 or 1:50, 
as this V-shaped arrangement roughly makes a smile, imitates a human figure with raised arms, and leaves the watch company&#x27;s logo unobscured by the hands.

In the 1970s, German designer Tian Harlan invented the Chromachron, a wristwatch with a clock face that has no dials but a disc with pie-shaped pattern rotating by the minute over color patterns representing both hours and minutes.

==Technological obsolescence==
In the 2010s, some United Kingdom schools started replacing analogue clocks in examination halls with digital clocks because an increasing number of pupils were unable to read analogue clocks. Smartphone and computer clocks are often digital rather than analogue, and proponents of replacing analogue clock faces argue that they have become technologically obsolete. However, reading analogue clocks is still part of American elementary school curricula; proponents of analogue clocks argue that their inclusion in the curriculum reinforces basic mathematical concepts that are taught in elementary school.

<doc id="564387" wikidata="Q750449" url="?curid=564387" title="Flow (psychology)">
<text>Flow in positive psychology, also known colloquially as being in the zone or locked in, is the mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. In essence, flow is characterized by the complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting transformation in one&#x27;s sense of time. Flow is the melting together of action and consciousness; the state of finding a balance between a skill and how challenging that task is. It requires a high level of concentration. Flow is used as a coping skill for stress and anxiety when productively pursuing a form of leisure that matches one&#x27;s skill set.

First presented in the 1975 book &quot;Beyond Boredom and Anxiety&quot; by psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi, concept has been widely referred to across a variety of fields (and is particularly well recognized in occupational therapy).

The flow state shares many characteristics with hyperfocus. However, hyperfocus is not always described in a positive light. Some examples include spending &quot;too much&quot; time playing video games or becoming pleasurably absorbed by one aspect of an assignment or task to the detriment of the overall assignment. In some cases, hyperfocus can &quot;capture&quot; a person, perhaps causing them to appear unfocused or to start several projects, but complete few. Hyperfocus is often mentioned &quot;in the context of autism, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder – conditions that have consequences on attentional abilities.&quot;

Flow is an individual experience and the idea behind flow originated from the sports-psychology theory about an Individual Zone of Optimal Functioning. The individuality of the concept of flow suggests that each person has their subjective area of flow, where they would function best given the situation. One is most likely to experience flow at moderate levels of psychological arousal, as one is unlikely to be overwhelmed, but not understimulated to the point of boredom.

==Etymology==
Flow is so named because, during Csíkszentmihályi&#x27;s 1975 interviews, several people described their &quot;flow&quot; experiences using the metaphor of a water current carrying them along:
==History==
Mihaly Csikszentmihályi and others began researching flow after Csikszentmihályi became fascinated by artists who would essentially get lost in their work. Artists, especially painters, got so immersed in their work that they would disregard their need for food, water and even sleep. The theory of flow came about when Csikszentmihályi tried to understand the phenomenon experienced by these artists. Flow research became prevalent in the 1980s and 1990s, with Csikszentmihályi and his colleagues in Italy still at the forefront. Researchers grew interested in optimal experiences and emphasizing positive experiences, especially in places such as schools and the business world. They also began studying the theory of flow at this time.

The cognitive science of flow has been studied under the rubric of effortless attention.

==Components==
Jeanne Nakamura and Csíkszentmihályi identify the following six factors as encompassing an experience of flow:

# Intense and focused concentration on the present moment
# Merging of action and awareness
# A loss of reflective self-consciousness
# A sense of personal control or agency over the situation or activity
# A distortion of temporal experience, as one&#x27;s subjective experience of time is altered
# Experience of the activity as intrinsically rewarding, also referred to as experience

Those aspects can appear independently of each other, but only in combination do they constitute a so-called &quot;flow experience&quot;. Additionally, psychology writer Kendra Cherry has mentioned three other components that Csíkszentmihályi lists as being a part of the flow experience:
# Immediate feedback
# Feeling the potential to succeed
# Feeling so engrossed in the experience that other needs become negligible
Just as with the conditions listed above, these conditions can be independent of one another.

In 2021, Cameron Norsworthy and colleagues aimed to address the inconsistencies and concerns of many of the flow-related models and studies, and proposed a framework that differentiated the flow antecedents and experiential dimensions. Norsworthy et al identified a core experience of flow including overarching antecedent constructs:

# Optimal challenge: A perceived capability to meet the challenging demands of the situation
# High motivation: A high motivational force

And recurring characteristics of the flow experience itself included:

# Absorption: A state of absorption in the task characterized by focused, undistracted attention, and a merging of action and awareness
# Effort-less control: A high sense of control in which the task feels less effortful than is typical for that person, characterized by fluidity of performance and an absence of concern over losing control
# Intrinsic reward: An intrinsically rewarding experience characterized by positive valence and optimal levels of arousal

The proposed definition of flow: Flow is an intrinsically rewarding state of absorption in a task in which a high degree of control feels more effort-less than normal.

==Mechanism==
In any given moment, a great deal of information is made available to each individual. Psychologists have found that one&#x27;s mind can attend to only a certain amount of information at a time. According to Csikszentmihályi&#x27;s 2004 TED talk, that number is about &quot;110 bits of information per second.&quot; That may seem like a lot of information, but simple daily tasks take quite a lot of information. Just decoding speech takes about 40–60 bits of information per second, which is why when having a conversation, one cannot focus as much attention on other things.

Generally, people have the ability to decide what they will give their full attention to. This excludes basic distinctive feelings, such as hunger and pain. However, when one is in the flow state, they are completely engrossed with the one task at hand and, without making the conscious decision to do so, lose awareness of all other things: time, people, distractions, and even basic bodily needs. According to Csikszentmihályi, this event occurs because all of the attention of the person in the flow state is on the task at hand; there is no more attention to be allocated.

The flow state has been described by Csikszentmihályi as the &quot;optimal experience&quot; in that one gets to a level of high gratification from the experience. Achieving this experience is considered to be personal and &quot;depends on the ability&quot; of the individual. One&#x27;s capacity and desire to overcome challenges in order to achieve their ultimate goals leads not only to the optimal experience but also to a sense of life satisfaction overall.

=== Operationalizing flow ===
Despite the attraction of flow and the varying flow interventions (e.g., mindfulness, goal-setting, visualisation) there has existed no gold standard intervention to promote flow experiences. Recently, Norsworthy et al. found continued evidence that it may be possible to ‘train’ flow through an educational intervention of flow.

==Measurement==
There are three common ways to measure flow experiences: the flow questionnaire (FQ), the experience sampling method (ESM), and the &quot;standardized scales of the componential approach.&quot;

===Flow questionnaire===
The FQ requires individuals to identify definitions of flow and situations in which they believe that they have experienced flow, followed by a section that asks them to evaluate their personal experiences in these flow-inducing situations. The FQ identifies flow as multiple constructs, therefore allowing the results to be used to estimate differences in the likelihood of experiencing flow across a variety of factors. Another strength of the FQ is that it does not assume that everyone&#x27;s flow experiences are the same. Because of this, the FQ is the ideal measure for estimating the prevalence of flow. However, the FQ has some weaknesses that more recent methods have set out to address. The FQ does not allow for a measurement of the intensity of flow during specific activities. This method also does not measure the influence of the ratio of challenge to skill on the flow state.

===Experience sampling method===
The ESM requires individuals to fill out the experience sampling form (ESF) at eight randomly chosen time intervals throughout the day. The purpose of this is to understand subjective experiences by estimating the time intervals that individuals spend in specific states during everyday life. The ESF is made up of 13 categorical items and 29 scaled items. The purpose of the categorical items is to determine the context and motivational aspects of the current actions (these items include: time, location, companionship/desire for companionship, activity being performed, reason for performing activity). Because these are open-ended questions, the answers need to be coded by researchers. This needs to be done carefully so as to avoid any biases in the statistical analysis. The scaled items are intended to measure the levels of a variety of subjective feelings that the individual may be experiencing. The ESM is more complex than the FQ and contributes to the understanding of how flow plays out in a variety of situations, however the possible biases make it a risky choice.

===Standardized scales===
Some researchers are not satisfied with the methods mentioned above and have set out to create their own scales. The scales developed by Jackson and Eklund are the most commonly used in research. Mainly because they are still consistent with Csíkszentmihályi&#x27;s definition of flow and consider flow as being both a state and a trait. Jackson and Eklund created two scales that have been proven to be psychometrically valid and reliable: the flow state scale-2 (which measures flow as a state), and the dispositional flow scale-2 (designed to measure flow as either a general trait or domain-specific trait). The statistical analysis of the individual results from these scales gives a much more complete understanding of flow than the ESM and the FQ. More recently, the Psychological Flow Scale (PFS) that was designed to be utilized across domains and scientific disciplines so future flow reseacrh could be compatible and comparable was validated. It offers a parsimonious model of flow that assesses the core aspects of the flow state.

==Characteristics==

The flow state can be entered while performing any activity; however, it is more likely to occur when the task or activity is wholeheartedly engaged for intrinsic purposes. Passive activities such as taking a bath or even watching TV, usually do not elicit a flow experience because active engagement is prerequisite to entering the flow state. While the activities that induce flow vary and may be multifaceted, Csikszentmihályi asserts that the experience of flow is similar whatever the activity.

Flow theory postulates that three conditions must be met to achieve flow:
# The activity must have clear goals and progress. This establishes structure and direction.
# The task must provide clear and immediate feedback. This helps to negotiate any changing demands and allows adjusting performance to maintain the flow state.
# Good balance is required between the &quot;perceived&quot; challenges of the task and one&#x27;s &quot;perceived&quot; skills. Confidence in the ability to complete the task is required.

It has been argued that the antecedent factors of flow are interrelated, and as such, a balance between perceived challenges and skills requires that the goals are clear and feedback is effective. Thus, such balance can be identified as the central precondition of flow experience.

In 1987, Massimini, Csíkszentmihályi and Carli published the eight-channel model of flow. Antonella Delle Fave, who worked with Fausto Massimini at the University of Milan, calls this graph the Experience Fluctuation Model. The model depicts the channels of experience that result from different levels of perceived challenges and perceived skills. The graph illustrates another aspect of flow: it is more likely to occur when the activity is a higher-than-average challenge (above the center point) and the individual has above-average skills (to the right of the center point). The center of the graph where the sectors meet represents the average level of challenge and skill across all individual daily activities. The further from the center an experience is, the greater the intensity of that state of being, whether it is flow or anxiety or boredom or relaxation.

Several problems of the model have been discussed in literature. One is that it does not ensure the perceived balance between challenges and skills which is said to be the central precondition of flow experience. Individuals with a low average level of skills and a high average level of challenges, (or the converse) do not necessarily experience a match between skills and challenges when both are above their individual average. Another study found that low challenge situations which were surpassed by skill were associated with enjoyment, relaxation, and happiness, which, they claim, is contrary to flow theory.

Schaffer (2013) proposed seven flow conditions:
# Knowing what to do
# Knowing how to do it
# Knowing how well one is doing
# Knowing where to go (if navigation is involved)
# High perceived challenges
# High perceived skills
# Freedom from distractions

Schaffer published a flow condition questionnaire (FCQ), to measure each of these seven flow conditions for any given task or activity.

===Challenges to maintaining flow===
Some of the challenges to staying in flow include states of apathy, boredom, and anxiety. The state of apathy is characterized by easy challenges and low skill level requirements, resulting in a general lack of interest in the activity. Boredom is a slightly different state that occurs when challenges are few, but one&#x27;s skill level exceeds those challenges causing one to seek higher challenges. A state of anxiety occurs when challenges are high enough to exceed perceived skill level, causing distress and uneasiness. These states in general prevent achieving the balance necessary for flow. Csíkszentmihályi has said, &quot;If challenges are too low, one gets back to flow by increasing them. If challenges are too great, one can return to the flow state by learning new skills.&quot;

===The autotelic personality===
Csíkszentmihályi hypothesized that people with certain personality traits may be better able to achieve flow than the average person. These traits include curiosity, persistence, low egotism, and a high propensity to perform activities for intrinsic reasons. People with most of these personality traits are said to have an &quot;autotelic personality&quot;, i.e. a disposition to actively seek challenges and flow experiences. The term &quot;autotelic&quot; derives from two Greek words, &quot;autos&quot; (&quot;self&quot;) and &quot;telos&quot; (&quot;end&quot; or &quot;goal&quot;).

There is scant research on the &quot;autotelic personality&quot;, but results of the few studies that have been conducted suggest that indeed some people are more likely to experience flow than others. One researcher (Abuhamdeh, 2000) found that people with an autotelic personality have a greater preference for &quot;high-action-opportunity, high-skills situations that stimulate them and encourage growth&quot; compared to those without an autotelic personality. It is in such high-challenge, high-skills situations that people are most likely to experience flow.

Experimental evidence shows that a balance between individual skills and demands of the task (compared to boredom and overload) only elicits the flow experience in individuals having an internal locus of control or a habitual action orientation. Several correlational studies found need for achievement to be a personal characteristic that fosters flow experiences.

Autotelic Personality also has been shown in studies to correlate and show overlapping of flow in personal life and the Big Five Personality Traits of Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Openness to Experience. More particularly the traits of agreeableness and extraversion. Study of Autotelic Personality is difficult as most studies are performed through self-evaluation, as an Autotelic Personality is difficult to observe.

==Group==
More than one type of flow exists. Group flow (or team flow) is notably different from independent flow, as it is inherently mutual. Group flow is attainable when the performance unit is a group, such as a team or musical group. When groups cooperate to agree on goals and patterns, social flow, commonly known as group cohesion, is much more likely to occur. If a group still has not entered flow, a team-level challenge may stimulate the group to harmonize. Group flow is different from synchronized solitary flow, in which a group is simultaneously experiencing individual flow. Group Flow occurs in an interpersonal manner, in which the act of others being present is inherent to the cause of the state of flow.

In research presented in a review written by PLoS ONE, it is stated, &quot;Group contexts introduce many additional variables that cause individuals to act, think, and feel differently during group situations compared to solitary situations.&quot; Due to these additional variables, the cause and effect of flow are vastly different and unique to the experience of individual flow, hence providing evidence for the existence of a separate flow state: group flow.

=== Physiology of Group Flow ===
Snijdewint studies the correlation of the physiological effect of a group that simultaneously reports a &quot;flow&quot; state. This research concludes that between many similar studies when a participant reports a feeling of flow state (in synchronization or due to a group environment), there are similarities in the cardiovascular triggers that the participant&#x27;s experience.

==Applications==

===Applications suggested by Csíkszentmihályi versus other practitioners===
Only Csíkszentmihályi seems to have published suggestions for extrinsic applications of the flow concept, such as design methods for playgrounds to elicit the flow experience. Other practitioners of Csíkszentmihályi&#x27;s flow concept focus on intrinsic applications, such as spirituality, performance improvement, or self-help.

===Education===

Flow state theory suggests that when individuals are in a state of flow, they experience deep immersion, focus, and intrinsic motivation in their activities. In the context of education, flow has been associated with increased student engagement, which is a key determinant of learning success.

Numerous studies have examined the relationship between flow and student engagement, demonstrating positive associations. For example, Csikszentmihalyi and Larson (1984) found that students who reported experiencing flow during their academic tasks exhibited higher levels of engagement, concentration, and enjoyment. Similarly, Cho and Lee (2017) discovered that flow experiences positively correlated with student engagement in a college classroom setting.

Flow state research has also explored its impact on learning outcomes, such as knowledge acquisition, skill development, and creativity. When students are in a state of flow, they are more likely to experience a heightened sense of focus, concentration, and intrinsic motivation, which can lead to improved learning outcomes.

Studies have shown that flow experiences can enhance cognitive processes related to learning. For instance, Schüler and Brunner (2009) found that university students who reported being in a state of flow while studying demonstrated better information recall and problem-solving abilities. In addition, studies by Simons and Dewitte (2004) and Jackson and Csikszentmihalyi (1999) revealed that flow experiences positively influenced creativity and innovation among students.

==== Applications ====
The concept of flow has been applied to various educational settings and practices, offering valuable insights for teaching and learning. Here are a few notable applications:
* Skill development: Flow state theory can inform the design of curricula and learning activities that promote the development of specific skills. By structuring tasks to align with students&#x27; skill levels and providing immediate feedback, educators can facilitate skill acquisition and mastery.
* Optimal learning environments: Flow state research suggests that the design of learning environments can significantly impact student engagement and learning outcomes. Creating environments that are challenging, supportive, and tailored to students&#x27; interests can facilitate flow experiences and foster deep learning.
* Motivation and well-being: Flow state theory emphasizes the role of intrinsic motivation in optimal performance and well-being. Educators can encourage students&#x27; intrinsic motivation by promoting autonomy, competence, and relatedness in the learning process, thus facilitating flow experiences.
* Classroom management: Understanding flow state dynamics can help educators manage classroom activities more effectively. By providing clear instructions, structuring tasks, and offering appropriate challenges, educators can create conditions conducive to flow, leading to improved classroom experiences.

These applications demonstrate the potential benefits of integrating flow state theory into educational practices. However, further research is needed to explore the specific strategies and interventions that effectively foster flow in educational settings.

==== History ====
In education, the concept of overlearning plays a role in a student&#x27;s ability to achieve flow. Csíkszentmihályi states that overlearning enables the mind to concentrate on visualizing the desired performance as a singular, integrated action instead of a set of actions. Challenging assignments that (slightly) stretch one&#x27;s skills lead to flow.

In the 1950s British cybernetician Gordon Pask designed an adaptive teaching machine called SAKI, an early example of &quot;e-learning&quot;. The machine is discussed in some detail in Stafford Beer&#x27;s book &quot;Cybernetics and Management&quot;. In the patent application for SAKI (1956), Pask&#x27;s comments (some of which are included below) indicate an awareness of the pedagogical importance of balancing student competence with didactic challenge, which is quite consistent with flow theory:

Around 2000, it came to the attention of Csíkszentmihályi that the principles and practices of the Montessori Method of education, seemed to purposefully set up continuous flow opportunities and experiences for students. Csíkszentmihályi and psychologist Kevin Rathunde embarked on a multi-year study of student experiences in Montessori settings and traditional educational settings. The research supported observations that students achieved flow experiences more frequently in Montessori settings.

===Music===
Musicians, especially improvisational soloists, may experience a state of flow while playing their instrument.
Research has shown that performers in a flow state have a heightened quality of performance as opposed to when they are not in a flow state. In a study performed with professional classical pianists who played piano pieces several times to induce a flow state, a significant relationship was found between the flow state of the pianist and the pianist&#x27;s heart rate, blood pressure, and major facial muscles. As the pianist entered the flow state, heart rate and blood pressure decreased, and the major facial muscles relaxed. This study further emphasized that flow is a state of effortless attention. In spite of the effortless attention and overall relaxation of the body, the performance of the pianist during the flow state improved.

Groups of drummers go through a state of flow when they sense a collective energy that drives the beat, something they refer to as &quot;getting into the groove&quot; or entrainment. Likewise, drummers and bass guitarists often describe a state of flow when they are feeling the downbeat together as being &quot;in the pocket.&quot; Researchers have measured flow through subscales; challenge-skill balance, merging of action and awareness, clear goals, unambiguous feedback, total concentration, sense of control, loss of self-consciousness, transformation of time and autotelic experience.

===Sports===

The concept of &quot;being in the zone&quot; during an athletic performance fit within Csíkszentmihályi&#x27;s description of the flow experience. Theories and applications of &quot;being in the zone&quot; and its relationship with an athletic competitive advantage are topics studied in the field of sport psychology. In a qualitative study of NCAA Division I athletes on the experience of flow, 94% of the athletes described flow state as causing a merging of action and awareness, and that it was effortless and automatic.

Timothy Gallwey&#x27;s influential works on the &quot;inner game&quot; of sports, such as golf and tennis, described the mental coaching and attitudes required to &quot;get in the zone&quot; and fully internalize mastery of the sport.

Roy Palmer suggests that &quot;being in the zone&quot; may also influence movement patterns as better integration of the conscious and subconscious reflex functions improves coordination. Many athletes describe the effortless nature of their performance while achieving personal bests.

In many martial arts, the term Budō is used to describe psychological flow. Mixed martial arts champion and Karate master Lyoto Machida uses meditation techniques before fights to attain mushin, a concept that, by his description, is in all respects equal to flow.

The Formula One driver Ayrton Senna, during qualifying for the 1988 Monaco Grand Prix, explained: &quot;I was already on pole, [...] and I just kept going. Suddenly I was nearly two seconds faster than anybody else, including my team mate with the same car. And suddenly I realised that I was no longer driving the car consciously. I was driving it by a kind of instinct, only I was in a different dimension. It was like I was in a tunnel.&quot;

Former 500 GP rider Wayne Gardner talking about his victory at the 1990 Australian Grand Prix on &quot;The Unrideables 2&quot; documentary said: &quot;During these last five laps I had this sort of above body experience where actually raised up above and I could see myself racing. It was kind of a remote control and it&#x27;s the weirdest thing I&#x27;ve ever had in my life. [...]&quot; After the race Mick [Doohan] and in fact Wayne Rainey said: &quot;How the hell did you do that?&quot; and I said: &quot;I have no idea.&quot;

===Religion and spirituality===
In yogic traditions such as Raja Yoga, reference is made to a state of &quot;flow&quot; in the practice of Samyama, a psychological absorption in the object of meditation.

===Games and gaming===

Flow in games and gaming has been linked to the laws of learning as a part of the explanation for why learning-games (the use of games to introduce material, improve understanding, or increase retention) have the potential to be effective. In particular, flow is intrinsically motivating, which is a part of the law of readiness. The condition of feedback, required for flow, is associated with the feedback aspects of the law of exercise. This is exhibited in well designed games, in particular, where players perform at the edge of their competency as they are guided by clear goals and feedback. The positive emotions associated with flow are associated with the law of effect. The intense experiences of being in a state of flow are directly associated with the law of intensity. Thus, the experience of gaming can be so engaging and motivating as it meets many of the laws of learning, which are inextricably connected to creating flow.

In games often much can be achieved thematically through an imbalance between challenge level and skill level. Horror games often keep challenges significantly above the player&#x27;s level of competency in order to foster a continual feeling of anxiety. Conversely, so called &quot;relaxation games&quot; keep the level of challenges significantly below the player&#x27;s competency level, in order to achieve an opposite effect. The video game &quot;Flow&quot; was designed as part of Jenova Chen&#x27;s master&#x27;s thesis for exploring the design decisions that allow players to achieve the flow state, by adjusting the difficulty dynamically during play.

It improves performance; calling the phenomenon &quot;TV trance,&quot; a 1981 &quot;BYTE&quot; article discussed how &quot;the best seem to enter a trance where they play but don&#x27;t pay attention to the details of the game.&quot; The primary goal of games is to create entertainment through intrinsic motivation, which is related to flow; that is, without intrinsic motivation it is virtually impossible to establish flow. Through the balance of skill and challenge, the player&#x27;s brain is aroused, with attention engaged and motivation high. Thus, the use of flow in games helps foster an enjoyable experience, which in turn increases motivation and draws players to continue playing. As such, game designers strive to integrate flow principles into their projects. Overall, the experience of play is fluid and is intrinsically psychologically rewarding independent of scores or in-game successes in the flow state.

===Design of intrinsically motivated computer systems===
A simplified modification to flow has been combined with the technology acceptance model (TAM) to help guide the design of and explain the adoption of intrinsically motivated computer systems. This model, the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) is modelled to improve the understanding of hedonic-motivation systems (HMS) adoption. HMS are systems used primarily to fulfill users&#x27; intrinsic motivations, such for online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, online pornography, gamified systems, and for general gamification. Instead of a minor, TAM extension, HMSAM is an HMS-specific system acceptance model based on an alternative theoretical perspective, which is in turn grounded in flow-based concept of cognitive absorption (CA). The HMSAM further builds on van der Heijden&#x27;s (2004) model of hedonic system adoption by including CA as a key mediator of perceived ease of use (PEOU) and of behavioral intentions to use (BIU) hedonic-motivation systems. Typically, models simplistically represent &quot;intrinsic motivations&quot; by mere perceived enjoyed. Instead, HMSAM uses the more complex, rich construct of CA, which includes joy, control, curiosity, focused immersion, and temporal dissociation. CA is a construct grounded in the seminal flow literature, yet CA has traditionally been used as a static construct, as if all five of its subconstructs occur at the same time—in direct contradiction to the flow literature. Thus, part of HMSAM&#x27;s contribution is to return CA closer to its flow roots by re-ordering these CA subconstructs into more natural process-variance order as predicted by flow. Empirical data collection along with mediation tests further support this modeling approach.

=== Workplace ===

Conditions of flow, defined as a state in which challenges and skills are equally matched, play an important role in the workplace. Because flow is associated with achievement, its development may have specific implications for increased workplace satisfaction and achievement. Flow researchers, such as Csikszentmihályi, believe that certain interventions may be performed to enhance and increase flow in the workplace, through which people would gain &#x27;intrinsic rewards that encourage persistence&quot; and provide benefits. In his consultation work, Csikszentmihályi emphasizes finding activities and environments that are conducive to flow, and then identifying and developing personal characteristics to increase experiences of flow. Applying these methods in the workplace can improve morale by fostering a sense of greater happiness and accomplishment, which may be correlated with increased performance. In his review of Mihály Csikszentmihályi&#x27;s book &quot;Good Business: Leadership, Flow, and the Making of Meaning,&quot; Coert Visser introduces the ideas presented by Csikszentmihályi, including &quot;good work&quot; in which one &quot;enjoys doing your best while at the same time contributing to something beyond yourself.&quot; He then provides tools by which managers and employees can create an atmosphere that encourages good work. Some consultants suggest that the experience sampling form (EMS) method be used for individuals and teams in the workplace in order to identify how time is currently being spent, and where focus should be redirected to in order to maximize flow experiences.

In order to achieve flow, Csikszentmihályi lays out the following three conditions:
* Goals are clear
* Feedback is immediate
* A balance exists between opportunity and capacity

Csikszentmihályi argues that with increased experiences of flow, people experience &quot;growth towards complexity&quot;. People flourish as their achievements grow and with that comes development of increasing &quot;emotional, cognitive, and social complexity.&quot; Creating a workplace atmosphere that allows for flow and growth, Csikszentmihályi argues, can increase the happiness and achievement of employees. An increasingly popular way of promoting greater flow in the workplace is using the &quot;serious play&quot; facilitation methods.

=== Implications ===
In the study &quot;Predicting flow at work: Investigating the activities and job characteristics that predict flow states at work&quot;, Karina Nielsen and Bryan Cleal used a 9-item flow scale to examine predictors of flow at two levels: activity level (such as brainstorming, problem solving, and evaluation) and at a more stable level (such as role clarity, influence, and cognitive demands). They found that activities such as planning, problem solving, and evaluation predicted transient flow states, but that more stable job characteristics were not found to predict flow at work. This study can help us identify which task at work can be cultivated and emphasized in order to help employees experience flow on the job. In her article in &quot;Positive Psychology News Daily&quot;, Kathryn Britton examines the importance of experiencing flow in the workplace beyond the individual benefits it creates. She writes, &quot;Flow isn&#x27;t just valuable to individuals; it also contributes to organizational goals. For example, frequent experiences of flow at work lead to higher productivity, innovation, and employee development (Csikszentmihályi, 1991, 2004). So finding ways to increase the frequency of flow experiences can be one way for people to work together to increase the effectiveness of their workplaces.&quot;

== Effects ==

Books by Csikszentmihályi suggest that enhancing the time spent in flow makes our lives more happy and successful. Flow experiences are predicted to lead to positive affect as well as to better performance. For example, delinquent behavior was reduced in adolescents after two years of enhancing flow through activities.

People who have experienced flow, describe the following feeling:
# Completely involved in what we are doing – focused, concentrated.
# A sense of ecstasy – of being outside everyday reality.
# Great inner clarity – knowing what needs to be done, and how well we are doing.
# Knowing that the activity is doable – that our skills are adequate to the task.
# A sense of serenity – no worries about oneself, and a feeling of growing beyond the boundaries of the ego.
# Timelessness – thoroughly focused on the present, hours seem to pass by the minute.
# Intrinsic motivation – whatever produces flow becomes its own reward.
However, further empirical evidence is required to substantiate these preliminary indications, as flow researchers continue to explore the problem of how to directly investigate causal consequences of flow experiences using modern scientific instrumentation to observe the neuro-physiological correlates of the flow state.

=== Satisfaction ===
Flow is an innately positive experience known to &quot;produce intense feelings of enjoyment&quot;. An experience that is so enjoyable should lead to positive affect and happiness in the long run. Also, Csikszentmihályi stated that happiness is derived from personal development and growth– and flow situations permit the experience of personal development.

Several studies found that flow experiences and positive affect go hand in hand, and that challenges and skills above the individual&#x27;s average foster positive affect. However, the causal processes underlying those relationships remain unclear at present.

=== Performance and learning ===
Flow experiences imply a growth principle. When one is in a flow state, they are working to master the activity at hand. To maintain that flow state, one must seek increasingly greater challenges. Attempting these new, difficult challenges stretches one&#x27;s skills. One emerges from such a flow experience with a bit of personal growth and great &quot;feelings of competence and efficacy&quot;. By increasing time spent in flow, intrinsic motivation and self-directed learning also increases.

Flow has a documented correlation with high performance in the fields of artistic and scientific creativity, teaching, learning, and sports;

Flow has been linked to persistence and achievement in activities while also helping to lower anxiety during various activities and raise self-esteem.

However, evidence regarding better performance in flow situations is mixed. For sure, the association between the two is a reciprocal one. That is, flow experiences may foster better performance but, on the other hand, good performance makes flow experiences more likely. Results of a longitudinal study in the academic context indicate that the causal effect of flow on performance is only of small magnitude and the strong relationship between the two is driven by an effect of performance on flow.
In the long run, flow experiences in a specific activity may lead to higher performance in that activity as flow is positively correlated with a higher subsequent motivation to perform and to perform well.

==Criticism==
Research on flow experiences is well established, however there are still unresolved, critical issues with the universal definitions and measurements associated with the concept. In recent years, the language, definitions, measurement approaches, and models of flow state in the research community continually increased. A comprehensive review of flow state studies conducted from 2012 to 2019 took one of the first steps towards determining a potential universalization of terminology for future use in research of flow. Despite the varied approaches to flow evident in this review, a common set of overarching antecedent constructs included “optimal challenge” and “high motivation,” and recurring characteristics of the flow experience itself included “absorption,” “effort-less control,” and “intrinsic reward.” By separating the antecedents of flow from the experience of flow itself, and utilising a language accessible to all scientific disciplines, Norsworthy et al.&#x27;s three dimensonal conceptualsiation of flow offers a contemporary framework that can be used for the study of flow across scientific disciplines.

Psychological flow state research has made significant strides in understanding the concept and its implications. However, like any scientific field, it is not without its criticisms and areas that require further investigation.

This section explores the criticisms of flow state research and highlights the potential directions for future research.

# Lack of Clarity and Operationalization: One common criticism of Csikszentmihalyi&#x27;s flow theory pertains to the lack of clarity and operationalization of its components. Flow is described as a state of complete immersion, but there is ongoing debate regarding the specific dimensions and criteria that constitute flow experiences. Some researchers argue that the theory lacks clear and consistent guidelines for measuring flow, which limits comparability across studies and hinders the establishment of a standardized framework
# Homogeneity of flow experiences: Critics have raised concerns about the assumption that flow experiences have consistent qualities and outcomes across different individuals and activities. While Csikszentmihalyi&#x27;s theory posits a universal nature of flow, some argue that flow experiences might vary depending on personal characteristics, cultural factors, and situational contexts. This criticism highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the diversity and contextual nuances of flow experiences. Keller and Landhäußer advocate for a flow intensity model because many models of flow have trouble predicting the intensity of flow experiences that can occur under various circumstances where skill and task demands fit together to produce flow. Cowley found that because self-reported flow happens after-the-fact, it does not really capture the aspect of flow that happens in the moment. Furthermore, that aspect of flow is prone to change, so the self-reported experience of flow cannot be trusted as much.
# Limited attention to negative aspects: Csikszentmihalyi&#x27;s flow theory primarily focuses on positive aspects of the flow experience, emphasizing enjoyment, intrinsic motivation, and optimal performance. However, some researchers argue that neglecting the potential negative aspects of flow, such as potential conflicts, negative emotions, or overuse leading to burnout, limits the comprehensiveness of the theory. Critics call for a more balanced approach that considers both positive and negative dimensions of flow experiences.

The lack of standardized definitions, measurement approaches, and terminologies hampers the cumulative progress of flow state research and poses challenges in synthesizing and comparing findings across studies. It also limits the development of comprehensive theoretical models that can encompass the complexity and nuances of flow experiences. Addressing these critical issues is essential to enhance the scientific rigor and validity of flow state research, enabling a deeper understanding of this intriguing psychological phenomenon. Despite these criticisms and challenges, the study of flow states continues to evolve and expand. Researchers are actively working towards refining the conceptualization, measurement, and theoretical frameworks of flow. Through ongoing efforts to establish consensus and develop standardized guidelines, the field aims to overcome these limitations, paving the way for more robust and comprehensive investigations into the nature and significance of psychological flow states.

Csikszentmihályi writes about the dangers of flow himself:...enjoyable activities that produce flow have a potentially negative effect: while they are capable of improving the quality of existence by creating order in the mind, they can become addictive, at which point the self becomes captive of a certain kind of order, and is then unwilling to cope with the ambiguities of life.
Further, he writes:
The flow experience, like everything else, is not &quot;good&quot; in an absolute sense. It is good only in that it has the potential to make life more rich, intense, and meaningful; it is good because it increases the strengths and complexity of the self. But whether the consequence of any particular instance of flow is good in a larger sense needs to be discussed and evaluated in terms of more inclusive social criteria.

Keller and Landhäußer (2012, p. 56) advocate for a flow intensity model because many models of flow have trouble predicting the intensity of flow experiences that can occur under various circumstances where skill and task demands fit together to produce flow.

Cowley et al. found that because self-reported flow happens after-the-fact, it does not really capture the aspect of flow that happens in the moment. Furthermore, that aspect of flow is prone to change, so the self-reported experience of flow cannot be trusted as much.

Cameron et al. found that there is not a lot of information on group flow, and this may be hindering development in managerial and theoretical contributions.

Goddard et al. found that interventions such as hypnosis, mindfulness, and imagery were found to be unsuccessful in stimulating flow experiences in individuals; however, these strategies were found to increase the state of flow.

Braxton Soderman&#x27;s 2021 monograph &quot;Against Flow: Video Games and the Flowing Subject&quot; points out that flow exists on ideological grounds as an individualist counterpoint to socialism. Furthermore, the application of flow via gamification has brought work and play into ever closer relationship. Play is, therefore, converted into a form of unpaid labor.

Norsworthy et al. proposed a parsimonious model of three core dimensions of flow, reflecting the findings from the largest review on flow science to date, synthesising flow research across scientific disciplines and addressing conceptual criticisms of flow science regarding construct validity, theoretical compatibility, relational ambiguity, and definitional inconsistency. A new Psychological Flow Scale (PFS) to measure the core aspects of the flow state that could be utilized across domains and scientific disciplines was validated.

== Global-cultural perspectives ==
In a global context, there is a gap in understanding how flow manifests within various socio-cultural contexts. Cross-cultural comparative studies, as suggested by Engeser and Rheinberg (2008), could delve into how flow experiences differ across societies, deepening our understanding of the concept&#x27;s universality or cultural specificity.

Longitudinal studies, capable of tracking flow experiences over extended periods, could offer insights into the sustained effects of flow on personal development, well-being, and performance. As Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi (2000) have suggested, such research could offer a more nuanced understanding of the concept&#x27;s long-term impact.

== Technology ==

The impact of technological advancements on flow experiences represents another noteworthy research direction. As digital technology increasingly permeates our lives, exploring how immersive technologies such as virtual reality or augmented reality facilitate or hinder flow states could be an enlightening line of study. The potential of such research has been discussed by Csikszentmihalyi and Csikszentmihalyi (2014), emphasizing the need to understand how digital distractions may disrupt flow and how these effects could be mitigated. Another critical avenue for future research is the role of flow in online learning. The rise of digital education platforms, as discussed by Csíkszentmihályi and Nakamura (2018), necessitates investigations into how flow can be fostered in these contexts and how it might influence learning outcomes.

The neuroscientific underpinnings of flow are a developing field with significant potential. With advancements in neuroimaging technologies, as highlighted by Linden (2021), the opportunity to correlate psychological experiences of flow with their physiological counterparts becomes increasingly feasible.

=== Ethics ===
Additional research into how flow impacts ethical decision-making across professional fields could have extensive implications. An exploratory study by Nielsen and Cleal (2010) hints at the potential role of flow in influencing ethical judgments, suggesting the necessity more extensive research in this domain.

=== Other areas of research ===
Cameron et al. proposed a research program that focuses on how group flow is different from individual flow, and how group flow affects group performance. These ideas will address some of the issues in group flow research such as poor data collection and interpretation. Sridhar &amp; Lyngdoh suggested that research should investigate how mobility affects the ethical performance of sales professionals. Furthermore, there should be longitudinal studies done in various fields to understand the ethical implications of flow in sales.

<text>The Catalan solids are the dual polyhedra of Archimedean solids. The Archimedean solids are thirteen highly-symmetric polyhedra with regular faces and symmetric vertices. The faces of the Catalan solids correspond by duality to the vertices of by Archimedean solids, and vice versa. One way to construct the Catalan solids is by using the Dorman Luke construction.

The Catalan solids are face-transitive or &quot;isohedral&quot; meaning that their faces are symmetric to one another, but they are not vertex-transitive because their vertices are not symmetric. Their dual, the Archimedean solids, are vertex-transitive but not face-transitive. Each Catalan solid has constant dihedral angles, meaning the angle between any two adjacent faces is the same. Additionally, two Catalan solids, the rhombic dodecahedron and rhombic triacontahedron, are edge-transitive, meaning their edges are symmetric to each other. Some Catalan solids were discovered by Johannes Kepler during his study of zonohedra, and Eugene Catalan completed the list of the thirteen solids in 1865. 

Two Catalan solids, the pentagonal icositetrahedron and the pentagonal hexecontahedron, are chiral, meaning that these two solids are not their own mirror images. They are dual to the snub cube and snub dodecahedron respectively, which are also chiral.

Eleven of the thirteen Catalan solids are known to have the Rupert property that a copy of the same solid can be passed through a hole in the solid.

<text>The Doomsday Conspiracy is a thriller novel by American writer Sidney Sheldon published in 1991. The story concerns an American naval officer who encounters a murderous and 
mysterious force and actions during an investigation in a balloon accident in the Swiss Alps.

==Synopsis==
Robert Bellamy, an agent of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), receives a mission on behalf of the NSA: to locate the witnesses of the crash of an experimental meteorological balloon in Switzerland, for which he is only given the date, the place where it happened, and the fact that the witnesses were passengers of a bus tour. He is given an unlimited budget but is told he must work strictly undercover. After he finds the first witness, he discovers that the meteorological balloon was actually an alien spaceship. He tracks the witnesses one by one and reports their names to the NSA. Without his knowledge, the names of the witnesses are then communicated to the intelligence organizations of their respective countries, and each of them is assassinated shortly after. These actions are coordinated under the name &quot;Operation Doomsday&quot;, under the leadership of a figure known only as Janus.

Robert&#x27;s personal history is shown through flashbacks: he rose in the military ranks under the mentorship of Admiral Ralph Whittaker, and during a combat flight in Vietnam his plane was taken down, with Whittaker son&#x27;s dying in the crash and Robert being badly injured. Doctors declare that he has no chance of survival, but a nurse named Susan convinces them to operate on him and encourages him to keep his fighting spirit. He and Susan fall in love after his recovery and marry. Robert is then recruited to become a spy for the ONI, but this job takes over his personal life until Susan divorces him and marries a business tycoon named Monte Banks, while Robert isolates himself and dedicates even more to his work.

In a conversation with the last witness, he mentions to Robert an additional one, a woman whom he had not seen in the bus. When Robert tries to contact the other bus passengers to corroborate this information, he finds out that all of them are dead. He deduces that this is an international effort since they died in different countries, and he also concludes that the final step of the operation would be his own death to eliminate all knowledge about the alien ship. He then goes into hiding right as Janus sends an instruction to kill him.

Robert goes for help to Li, one of his friends who lives in Paris. Li explains to him about Operation Doomsday, revealing that aliens have been in communication with the governments of Earth for a while, demanding a stop of industrial pollution to save the Earth&#x27;s environment, before revealing that he is a member of the operation and shooting Robert. Robert wins the fight and kills him, but he is badly wounded and realizes that he will eventually be killed unless he negotiates.

The mysterious last witness is revealed to be an alien who survived the crash of the spaceship and disguised herself as a woman. She contacts Robert through a piece of the spaceship that he got from one of the witnesses, and they arrange to meet back in Switzerland where the ship crashed. Robert also calls the NSA and asks to meet Janus there. In the final confrontation, Janus is revealed to be Admiral Whittaker, Robert&#x27;s mentor. He also confesses that he sabotaged Robert&#x27;s marriage to keep him at the ONI, and eventually decided to have him killed for not being committed enough to his job. Monte Banks is revealed to be part of the Doomsday conspiracy, as he owns many industries that would lose money if they were not able to pollute. Both are abducted by the aliens, who task Robert with the mission of spreading environmental awareness on Earth.

==Influence==
Dan Brown, the author of &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, named &quot;The Doomsday Conspiracy&quot; as the book that inspired him to write thriller fiction, citing its &quot;simplicity of the prose and efficiency of the storyline&quot;.

MF Doom adapted part of the text for samples in his debut album, &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="564402" wikidata="Q2472406" url="?curid=564402" title="Ammanford">
<text>Ammanford ( ) is a town and community in Carmarthenshire, Wales. At the 2021 census the community had a population of 5,445, and the wider built up area had a population of 8,285.

Ammanford is served by the A483 and A474 roads. Ammanford railway station is a stop on the Heart of Wales Line, with trains to Llanelli and Swansea to the south and Shrewsbury to the north.

Ammanford is twinned with Breuillet, Essonne.

== History ==
The town of Ammanford is a relatively modern settlement. It was originally known as Cross Inn, named after an inn that was located at a location where a number of roads converged. During the nineteenth century, as a result of the growth of both the tinplate and anthracite coal trades, a village grew around the Cross Inn (which later became known as Ammanford Square).

As the settlement expanded, prominent residents came to the view that its name should be changed since there were a number of other places named Cross Inn in Carmarthenshire alone. In 1880, a number of public meetings were held, and in November 1880 it was resolved that the name Ammanford (i.e. &quot;Ford of the River Amman&quot;) adopted. The meeting was chaired by Watcyn Wyn. It took several years for the new name to be widely adopted, but the decision of the Great Western Railway to change the name of the Cross Inn station to Ammanford in June 1883 was welcomed by residents and tradesmen.

Ammanford hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1922 and 1970.

===Anthracite Strike===

In 1925 the Ammanford Anthracite Strike took place, where anthracite miners took control of the town by force and violence for 10 days. 200 Glamorgan police were ambushed by strikers at Pontamman Bridge during the so-called &#x27;Battle of Ammanford&#x27;.

===School Stabbing Incident===

On 24 April 2024, Ysgol Dyffryn Aman, the local comprehensive school, was the site of a stabbing incident in which two teachers and a student were injured. A teenage girl was arrested.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Ammanford, at community (town) and county level: Ammanford Town Council (Cyngor Tref Rhydaman) and Carmarthenshire County Council (Cyngor Sir Gâr). The town council is based at Ammanford Town Hall on Iscennen Road. The neighbouring communities are Llandybie, Betws, and Llanedi, all being in Carmarthenshire.

===Administrative history===
The Ammanford area historically straddled the parishes of Llandybie and Betws in Carmarthenshire. Carmarthenshire had a county council from 1889. When elected parish and district councils were established in 1894, both parishes were given a parish council and included in the Llandilo Fawr Rural District. As a result of the rapid growth of the town, in 1903 Ammanford was made its own urban district and civil parish, taking in areas ceded from both Llandybie and Betws parishes.

The town was then administered by Ammanford Urban District Council from 1903 until 1974. The council built the Town Hall in 1964 to serve as its headquarters.

Ammanford Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A community called Ammanford was created instead, covering the area of the abolished urban district, with its community council taking the name Ammanford Town Council. District-level functions passed to Dinefwr Borough Council. Carmarthenshire County Council was abolished as part of the same reforms, with county-level functions passing to the new Dyfed County Council. Dinefwr and Dyfed were both abolished in 1996 and their councils&#x27; functions passed to a re-established Carmarthenshire County Council.

===Parliamentary elections===
Ammanford was part of the Carmarthenshire county constituency until it was divided in 1885 whereupon the town was located in the East Carmarthen constituency which was held until its abolition in 1918 by the Liberal Party. The Labour Party captured Llanelli in 1922 and have held it ever since. The MP from 1936 until 1970 was Jim Griffiths, a native of nearby Betws. However, in 1997, Ammanford was transferred to the new Carmarthen East and Dinefwr seat which was captured in 2001 by Adam Price of Plaid Cymru. Price remained the MP until 2010 before being replaced by Johnathan Edwards, also of Plaid Cymru.

=== Senedd elections ===
Ammanford has been in the Carmarthen East and Dinefwr constituency at Senedd Cymru since devolution in 1999. Rhodri Glyn Thomas was the constituency&#x27;s first representative at the new assembly before being replaced by Adam Price in 2016. Price would lead the Plaid Cymru from 2018 until 2023.

==Religion==
Ammanford is in the ecclesiastical parish of Ammanford and Betws. Ammanford formed part of the ancient parish of Llandybie although the parish church at Betws was much closer to the town. The established church was, however, slow to react to the growth of an urban community.

The nonconformist denominations, in contrast, were far more active and Ammanford was an important location as the 1904–1905 Welsh Revival unfolded. Prominent chapels include Ebeneser (Baptist), Gellimanwydd (Christian Temple) (Independent) and Bethany (Presbyterian Church of Wales). There is an active Christadelphian community based in the town centre, in addition to various Evangelical and Apostolic Churches. The global Apostolic Church grew out of this area and until recently still held the Annual Apostolic Convention at nearby Penygroes.

==Developments==
On 4 July 2002, Ammanford was granted Fairtrade Town status. This status was renewed by the Fairtrade Foundation on 27 December 2003.

<text>The grey-breasted prinia or Franklin&#x27;s prinia (Prinia hodgsonii) is a wren-warbler belonging to the family of small passerine birds found mainly in warmer southern regions of the Old World. This prinia is a resident breeder in the Indian subcontinent, Sri Lanka and southeast Asia. Like other prinias, it often holds the tail upright but it is easily told by a smoky grey band across the breast which contrasts with a white throat. The beak is all black while the legs are pink. The tail is graduated as in other prinias and the grey feathers are tipped in white. In the breeding plumage the upperparts are grey while non-breeding birds are pale above with rufous wings and a weak supercilium. It is found in scrub, forest clearings and other open but well vegetated habitats. It can be confused with the rufescent prinia.

==Taxonomy==
This species was named by James Franklin as &quot;Prinia gracilis&quot; in 1831 based on a specimen that he obtained on the Ganges between Calcutta and Benares. It was renamed as &quot;Prinia hodgsonii&quot; by Edward Blyth in 1844 since the name &quot;Sylvia gracilis&quot; had been in use for the graceful prinia (described earlier in 1823 by Martin Lichtenstein) clashed when treated in the same genus &quot;Prinia&quot;. It was also described as &quot;Prinia adamsi&quot; by Jerdon and as &quot;Prinia humilis&quot; by Hume. This was placed in a separate genus &quot;Franklinia&quot; by Blyth and this treatment was followed by Jerdon and by others including Hugh Whistler who separated this species from the genus &quot;Prinia&quot; and placed it in the genus &quot;Franklinia&quot; which he considered distinct on the basis of having twelve tail feathers rather than ten and in having distinct breeding and non-breeding plumages. The merging of &quot;Prinia&quot; and &quot;Franklinia&quot; was supported by H. G. Deignan. The species has a widespread distribution and populations that show distinct plumages have been described as subspecies:

* &quot;P. h. hodgsonii&quot; - the nominate subspecies is a resident of the Indian Peninsula from the Gangetic plains to Mysore in the south and extending east to Bangladesh. This loses the breast band in the non-breeding season and moults into grey-olive upperparts.
* &quot;P. h. rufula&quot; - is a resident in the Himalayan foothills from lower Swat in Pakistan to Arunachal Pradesh in eastern India. It makes altitudinal movements descending south in winter. This has a tinge of rufous on the flanks and on the upper-body.
* &quot;P. h. albogularis&quot; - of the Western Ghats has the broadest and darkest breast band. 
* &quot;P. h. pectoralis&quot; - is resident in the eastern and southeastern part of Sri Lanka. It sports the grey breast-band throughout the year. The band is incomplete in the middle for females. An alternate name of &quot;P. h. leggei&quot; was proposed due to the idea that it might clash with the name of &quot;Malcorus pectoralis&quot; but the original name is retained since the other species is placed in a different genus.
* &quot;P. h. erro&quot; - geographic range from East Myanmar to Thailand and South Indochina.
* &quot;P. h. confusa&quot; - geographic range from South China to Northeast Laos and N Vietnam.

==Description==

These long warblers have a longish grey tail with graduated feathers that are tipped in white, they have strong pinkish legs and a short black bill. The eye ring is orange. The sexes look alike in most populations except in &quot;P .h. pectoralis&quot; of Sri Lanka where the female can be told apart by the incomplete breast band. 
The underparts are buff white and the grey breast band contrasts with the white throat in the breeding season. They have a rufous wing panel and the upperparts are smoky grey during the breeding season and olive brown in the non-breeding period. Non-breeding birds have a short indistinct white supercilium and often lack the breast band. Young birds are like non-breeding adults but more rufous above. The distinctive greyer endemic race in Sri Lanka, &quot;P. h. pectoralis&quot;, retains the summer-type plumage all year round. Young birds have a pale lower mandible. The tail feathers are shorter in summer than in the non-breeding winter plumage.

==Habitat and distribution==
This skulking passerine bird is typically found in open woodland, scrub jungle, bushes and hedgerows amidst cultivation. Also found in bamboo jungle, mangrove swamps and reeds. &quot;P. h. rufula&quot; has been observed in patches of sugarcane near Kathmandu valley.

It is a common resident of the Indian peninsula. It migrates slightly south during winter. The distribution extends from Himalayan foothills to Southern India and to eastern Indian states Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya and Assam. The species distribution extends to Pakistan, Burma, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Yunnan province in southern China. Its altitude ranges from plains and goes up to 1000 meters (3280 ft) &quot;P. h. hodgsonii&quot; and up to 1800 meters (5900 ft) &quot;P. h. rufula&quot; in Meghalaya.

==Behavior and ecology==

Like most warblers, grey-breasted prinias are insectivorous. They feeds mainly on insects like ants, small beetles, caterpillars which are found among twigs and foliage of small trees. They also feeds on nectar from blossoms of trees like &quot;Erythrina&quot; and &quot;Bombax&quot; and during summer their forehead is sometimes sprinkled with pollen giving them an orange or yellowish head that can lead to mistaken identification.

Usually found in pairs or small groups, they sometimes forms parties of five or more (up to twenty) individuals. It jerks its tail as it flits between branches.

The breeding season begins with the rains. The male sings from a high perch and also performs aerobatic manoeuvers with rising and falling before diving with song notes. The song is a squeaky series of calls: &#x27; (or &#x27;). The nest is a cup of grass placed between leaves that are sewn together with cobwebs and resembles the nest of a common tailorbird but tends to be placed closer to the ground. The typical clutch consists of three or four eggs. The eggs vary in colour and they include glossy blue, pinkish white, greenish-blue or even pure white. They usually have reddish brown speckles at the broad end. Both parents incubate the eggs which hatch after about ten to eleven days. More than one brood may be raised in a season.

==References==
==Call==
In breeding season, the male gives a spirited performance from an exposed perch excitedly warbling his squeaky yousee-yousee-yousee-which-which-which song. A conversational call-note, zee zee zee is uttered as the birds move along.

<text>Mubarak Awad () is a Palestinian-American psychologist and an advocate of nonviolent resistance.

==Early life and move to the United States==
Awad, a Palestinian Christian (a member of the Greek Orthodox Church), was born in 1943 in Jerusalem when it was under the British Mandate. When Awad was five years old, his father was killed during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and he became a refugee in the Old City of Jerusalem. His mother was a pacifist and argued against revenge. He was given the right to Israeli citizenship in 1967 when East Jerusalem was annexed by Israel after the Six-Day War but refused and kept his Jordanian citizenship.

Mennonite and Quaker missionaries influenced Awad&#x27;s views in his youth. In the 1960s he moved to the United States to study at the Mennonite Bluffton University and received a BA in social work and sociology. He went on to obtain an MS in education from Saint Francis University and a PhD in psychology from the International Graduate School of Saint Louis University.

He was granted U.S. citizenship in 1978 and settled in a small town in Ohio.

==Career==
===National Youth Advocate Program===
Awad was the founder and former president of the National Youth Advocate Program (NYAP) in the United States. The organization developed from the Ohio Youth Advocate Program (OYAP) established by Awad in 1978 with support from the Ohio Youth Commission (now the Department of Youth Services), the state department responsible for finding placements for &quot;at risk&quot; youth referred to the state from county juvenile courts.

As an offshoot of NYAP, he later founded and directed Youth Advocate Program International, headquartered in Washington, DC. According to the website, &quot;The Youth Advocate Program International, Inc. (YAP International) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. It established its headquarters and advocacy center in Washington, DC in 1996. YAP International&#x27;s mission is to promote and protect the rights and well-being of the world&#x27;s youth, giving particular attention to children victimized by conflict, exploitation, and state and personal violence.&quot;

===Palestinian Centre for the Study of Nonviolence===

In 1983 Awad returned to Jerusalem and established the Palestinian Centre for the Study of Nonviolence (PCSN). Before the &quot;intifada&quot;, Awad published papers and lectured on nonviolence as a technique for resisting the Israeli occupation. He wrote that nonviolence could be used as a means of resistance. The Centre also sponsored a number of nonviolent actions during the early months on the first &quot;intifada&quot;. Among the tactics employed was the planting of olive trees on proposed Israeli settlements, asking people not to pay taxes and encouraging people to eat and drink Palestinian products. In the Middle East he is often referred to as the Arab Gandhi due to the similarity between his teachings of the power of nonviolence and those of Mahatma Gandhi in India during the British Raj. He believed these tactics could be used to resist the Israeli military occupation. He also drew upon the methodologies of Gene Sharp&#x27;s trilogy, &quot;The Politics of Non-Violence&quot;. Using this knowledge and his experience, Awad prepared his own &quot;12-page blueprint for passive resistance in the territories,&quot; eventually published in the &quot;Journal of Palestine Studies&quot;. He has translated into Arabic the teachings of Mohatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King. In 1998 Mubarak Awad&#x27;s nephew, Sami Awad founded the &quot;Holy Land Trust&quot; (HLT) out of &quot;PCSN&quot;. 
====Deportation by Israel====
In 1987, Awad attempted to renew the residency permit he had been issued in 1967. His application was declined and he was ordered to leave the country when his tourist visa expired. Awad claimed, with support from U.S. consular officials, that under international conventions Israel did not have the right to expel him from his place of birth and he refused to leave. The Israeli government stayed the deportation order mainly at the insistence of the U.S. In May 1988, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir ordered Awad arrested and expelled. Officials charged that Awad broke Israeli law by inciting &quot;civil uprising&quot; and helping to write leaflets that advocated civil disobedience that were distributed by the leadership of the First Intifada. No evidence was provided to support the charge and Awad appealed the decision to the Supreme Court. The court ruled that he had forfeited his right to residence status in Israel when he became a U.S. citizen and he was deported in June 1988. U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz&#x27;s appeal to Shamir to revoke the deportation order was declined. Ian Lustick, professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania, cited the ruling in Awad&#x27;s case as one of a number of examples that he argues demonstrate that &quot;[t]here has never been an official act that has declared expanded East Jerusalem as having been annexed by the State of Israel.&quot;

=== Criticism ===
Critics argue that Awad advocated violence under the guise of calling it civil disobedience. In a 1984 article for the &quot;Journal of Palestine Studies&quot;, Awad stated, &quot;for the Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza the most effective strategy is nonviolence. This does not apply to the Palestinians living outside. Nor is it a rejection of the concept of armed struggle. This is nothing short of war.&quot; Awad called to &quot;block roads, prevent communications, cut electricity, telephone, and water lines, prevent the movement of equipment, and in other ways obstruct the government.&quot; The article speaks openly about throwing stones. Awad&#x27;s article called for a campaign of harassment against Israelis and for &quot;psychological warfare&quot; to &quot;demoralize&quot; the population. He also called for &quot;the destruction of Israeli fences and power lines,&quot; according to &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

Awad has called for Israel to be replaced with Palestine. In a Jerusalem speech to Palestinian students he said &quot;the PLO wants the entire Palestine and I agree. Palestine for me is the Galilee, Akko, Ashdod, everything. This is Palestine for me.&quot; Dr. Shlomo Riskin, founding chief rabbi of the Israeli settlement of Efrat in the West Bank, called him &quot;an articulate wolf in sheep`s clothing&quot; who &quot;clearly represents a threat to the lives of Israeli citizens.&quot; Israeli diplomat Moshe Arad in a New York Times article decried Awad who he claimed took American citizenship, in accordance with immigration law, which required that he &#x27;intends to reside permanently in the U.S. and then turned around and claimed to the Israeli Supreme Court that his intention was always to reside in Jerusalem. &quot;Nonviolence as merely a convenient tactic... incitement and acts of violence - are these the watchwords of a man truly committed to peace and moderation? No. Western audiences do not hear these Awad views in English. But his local audiences hear them in Arabic,&quot; Arad said.

===Nonviolence International===
In 1989, Awad founded Nonviolence International, a non-governmental organization in Special Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. Nonviolence International&#x27;s stated mission is to promote nonviolent action and seek to reduce the use of violence worldwide.

===Academic career===
Awad has taught at the American University in Washington, D.C. since the early 1990s. He is an adjunct professor in the School of International Service where he teaches classes in the theories and methods of nonviolence.

<doc id="564413" wikidata="Q13534575" url="?curid=564413" title="Henry Venn (Clapham Sect)">
<text>Henry Venn (1725 in Barnes, Surrey, England – 1797), was an English evangelical minister and one of the founders of the Clapham Sect, an influential evangelical group within the Church of England.

==Life==
He was the third son of Richard Venn, vicar of St Antholin, Budge Row in London. He was educated at the University of Cambridge from 1742, studying at St John&#x27;s and then Jesus College where he was a Rustat scholar. He graduated B.A. in 1745 and M.A. in 1749. He also played cricket, for All England against Surrey.

In 1749 Venn was ordained as a priest in the Church of England and was elected fellow of Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge. After holding a curacy at Barton, Cambridgeshire, he became curate of both St Matthew, Friday Street, in the City of London, and of West Horsley, Surrey, in 1750. Local clergy already considered him a &quot;Methodist&quot; (in later terms, an evangelical), since he taught Scripture in his home and the number of communicants at West Horsley increased from twelve to sixty. However, it was only at this time that his beliefs moved from the High Church views of &quot;The Whole Duty of Man&quot; to the more evangelical position of &quot;A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life&quot;. In 1754 he became curate of Clapham and was also elected lecturer of St Swithin, London Stone and St Alban, Wood Street.

From 1759 to 1771, Venn was vicar of Huddersfield Parish Church. He found a small group of like-minded Yorkshire clergy: Richard Conyers, William Grimshaw of Haworth, James Stillingfleet. In 1771 he exchanged to the living of Yelling, Huntingdonshire where he drew as visitors William Faris, Joseph Jowett, Thomas Robinson and Charles Simeon. He died in the rectory, and is commemorated by a plaque over the pulpit of the parish church.

Henry is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 1 July.

==Works==
Venn was well known as the author of &quot;The Compleat Duty of Man&quot; (London, 1763), a work in which he intended to supplement the teaching embodied in the anonymous &quot;Whole Duty of Man&quot; from an evangelical perspective.

==Family==
He married (1757) a daughter of the Rev. Thomas Bishop, D.D., a divine of Ipswich. Henry Venn&#x27;s descendants also came to prominence over the succeeding generations. His son John Venn was one of the founders of the Church Missionary Society (CMS).

His granddaughter, by his eldest daughter Eling, was Charlotte Elliott, writer of numerous hymns, most notably &#x27;&quot;Just as I Am&quot;. Her brothers were clergymen Edward Bishop Elliott and Henry Venn Elliott, 

A grandson, also named Henry Venn (1796 - 1873), was honorary secretary of the Church Missionary Society from 1841 to 1873. He expounded the basic principles of indigenous Christian missions made widespread by the Lausanne Congress of 1974. A great-grandson was the logician and philosopher John Venn, famed for the Venn diagram.

<text>Norodom Suramarit (, ; 6 March 1896 – 3 April 1960) was King of Cambodia from 3 March 1955 until his death in 1960. He was the father of King Norodom Sihanouk and the grandfather of Cambodia&#x27;s current king, Norodom Sihamoni. Suramarit was born in Phnom Penh to Prince Norodom Sutharot. When his grandfather King Norodom died in 1904, Norodom&#x27;s brother Sisowath took the throne. King Sisowath died in 1927 and was succeeded by his son Monivong.

Suramarit married Monivong&#x27;s daughter Sisowath Kosamak. Upon Monivong&#x27;s death in 1941, Sihanouk, Suramarit&#x27;s son and Monivong&#x27;s grandson, was selected as the new king. In 1955, Sihanouk abdicated in favor of his father. He was formally crowned on 6 March 1956, which coincided with his 60th birthday.

Following Suramarit&#x27;s death in 1960, Sihanouk became Chief of State, while Suramarit&#x27;s wife Sisowath Kosamak became Queen. Suramarit was given the posthumous title of &quot;Preah Karuna Preah Norodom Suramarit Preah Moha Kachanakkot&quot; ().

In the 2021 edition of the Research Excellence Framework, 77 per cent of research submitted by the university was ranked as world-leading or internationally excellent, with impacts across society, health, culture and the environment.

==History==

=== 19th century ===
The University of Portsmouth traces its roots back to 1 June 1870 (or 1869 according to some sources) when it was first established as the &quot;Portsmouth and Gosport School of Science and Art&quot;. During the late 19th century, the school occupied several buildings in Old Portsmouth and Southsea. The main premises, located at the Crown Sale Rooms in Pembroke Street, was attended by both male and female students. Due to its coastal location, the school provided technical instruction to engineers and skilled workers, who often graduated to work at the city docks, including for the Royal Navy at the Portsmouth Royal Dockyard. The curriculum comprised a range of skills including practical geometry, artistic anatomy, and architectural and mechanical drawing. Additionally, the school provided evening classes for local artisans.

==== Portsmouth Municipal Technical Institute and the College of Art ====
In 1894, following education reforms which vested local authorities with control over technical and manual education, the Borough of Portsmouth established the &quot;Portsmouth Municipal Technical Institute.&quot; Having acquired the school&#x27;s science and technology courses, the &quot;Portsmouth and Gosport School of Science and Art&quot; was restructured to become the &quot;College of Art&quot;.

=== 20th century ===

==== Portsmouth Municipal College and construction of the Park Building ====
In 1903, following the enactment of the Education Act 1902, construction began on a site behind the Portsmouth Guildhall. Designed by local architect G.E. Smith and completed in 1908, the building incorporates a combination of Flemish and Renaissance architectural styles. In the same year, the &quot;Portsmouth Municipal Technical Institute&quot; was succeeded by the newly established &quot;Portsmouth Municipal College&quot;. Providing a range of further and higher education courses in chemistry and engineering, the college occupied the building together with the College of Art, the Portsmouth Day Training College, and a public reference library.&quot;&quot; Today, the grade II listed building remains in use by the university and has since become known as the Park Building, having been named after an adjacent urban park known as Victoria Park.
In 1911, male and female Students&#x27; union were established. In autumn of 1911, the first addition of student magazine &quot;The Galleon,&quot; reported the creation of a women&#x27;s Basketball team and expressed discontent over the state of the common room.

Following World War II, there was a decline in the need for engineering skills in Britain. In response, the college diversified its curriculum to include the arts and humanities.&quot;&quot;

==== Portsmouth College of Technology ====
In 1953, the &quot;Portsmouth Municipal College,&quot; having changed its name to the &quot;Portsmouth College of Technology&quot;, became the Regional College for Southern England. 

==== Polytechnic status ====
The college was renamed Portsmouth Polytechnic after it gained polytechnic status in 1969 and by the late 1980s was one of the largest polytechnics in the UK.

==== University status ====
On 7 July 1992 the inauguration of the University of Portsmouth was celebrated at a ceremony at Portsmouth Guildhall. As a new university, it could validate its own degrees, under the provision of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992.

=== 21st century ===
On Friday 4 May 2018, the University of Portsmouth was revealed as the main shirt sponsor of Portsmouth F.C. for the 2018–19, 2019–20 and 2020–21 seasons.

In December 2022, an employment tribunal ruled that when the university failed to reappoint Kajal Sharma to her job, it had racially discriminated against her.

==Campuses==
The university is split between the University Quarter, which is centred around the Portsmouth Guildhall area, and the Langstone Campus.

===Langstone campus===
Langstone is the smaller of the two campuses, located in Milton on the eastern edge of Portsea Island. The campus overlooks Langstone Harbour and it is home to the university&#x27;s sports grounds.

Langstone Campus used to be home of the university&#x27;s School of Languages and Area Studies, which has since moved into Park Building in the University Quarter. It also used to be home to three halls of residence: Queen Elizabeth Queen Mother (QEQM), Trust Hall and Langstone Flats. These used to house 565 students, however these have now been closed, in favour of those closer to the majority of the university buildings. These have now been demolished.

In 2024, parts of the university&#x27;s Langstone campus were reopened. The two remaining halls of residence at Langstone campus are now home to roughly 250 students.

===University Quarter===
The University Quarter is a collection of university buildings located around the centre of the city. This area contains most of the university&#x27;s teaching facilities and nearly all of the Student Halls of residence (except the Langstone student village and two halls (Rees Hall and Burrell House) located on Southsea Terrace).

The University Library (formerly the Frewen Library) was extended in 2006 at a cost of £11 million. It was opened by the crime writer P. D. James. The university has also recently invested in the Faculty of Science, in particular by renovating the aluminium-clad main building, St Michael&#x27;s.

A new faculty called &quot;Creative and Cultural Industries&quot; was opened in September 2006.

===Military Technological College of Oman===
On 7 June 2013, the University of Portsmouth announced its partnership with the Military Technological College of Oman. This involves the University of Portsmouth providing academic guidance and academic accreditation for the education of 4,200 students with technical roles in armed services and a few civilian employers in the Sultanate of Oman. This has been criticised by the student Amnesty International Society and by Campaign Against the Arms Trade who consider Oman an authoritarian regime, likely to use military capabilities on their own citizens or in regional conflicts.

===London Campus===
On 15 September 2023, the University of Portsmouth launched its London campus in Walthamstow, E17. The London campus offers a block teaching model which offers fixed timetables and linear module progression with assignments integrated into the teaching process. The aim of the London campus is to boost the local economy by an estimated £372 million by 2043, and create over 500 new jobs.

==Organisation and structure==
===Governance===
The university is ceremonially headed by Karen Blackett, who was installed as chancellor in 2017. The university is, however, run day-to-day by the vice-chancellor, presently Professor Graham Galbraith, along with a single integrated decision-making body known as the university executive board. This includes deputy vice-chancellors, the provost, the chief financial officer and the executive deans of faculties, together with the chief people officer and the executive director of corporate governance.

The university&#x27;s board of governors is the university’s governing body and is ultimately responsible for the university and all of its activities.

<doc id="564424" wikidata="Q124057" url="?curid=564424" title="Dolores del Río">
<text>María de los Dolores Asúnsolo y López Negrete (3 August 1904 – 11 April 1983), known professionally as Dolores del Río (), was a Mexican actress. With a career spanning more than 50 years, she is regarded as the first major female Latin American crossover star in Hollywood. Along with a notable career in American cinema during the 1920s and 1930s, she was also considered one of the most important female figures in the Golden Age of Mexican cinema, and one of the most beautiful actresses of her era.

After being discovered in Mexico, she began her film career in Hollywood in 1925. She had roles in a string of successful films, including &quot;Resurrection&quot; (1927), &quot;Ramona&quot; (1928) and &quot;Evangeline&quot; (1929). Del Río came to be considered a sort of feminine version of Rudolph Valentino, a ‘female Latin Lover’ , in her years during the American silent era.

With the advent of sound, she acted in a range of film genres, from contemporary crime melodramas to musical comedies and romantic dramas. Her most successful films of that decade include &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot; (1932), &quot;Flying Down to Rio&quot; (1933) and &quot;Madame Du Barry&quot; (1934). In the early 1940s, when her Hollywood career began to decline, Del Río returned to Mexico and joined the Mexican film industry, which at that time was at its peak.

When Del Río returned to her native country, she became one of the more important stars of the Golden Age of Mexican cinema. A series of Mexican films starring Del Rio are considered classic masterpieces and helped boost Mexican cinema worldwide. Of them stands out the critically acclaimed &quot;María Candelaria&quot; (1943). Del Río remained active mainly in Mexican films throughout the 1950s. In 1960 she returned to Hollywood. During the next years she appeared in Mexican and American films. From the late 1950s until the early 1970s she also successfully ventured into theater in Mexico and appeared in some American TV series.

Del Río is considered a quintessential representation of the female face of Mexico in the world.

==Early life and education==
María de los Dolores Asúnsolo y López Negrete, was born in Victoria de Durango, Mexico on 3 August 1904, daughter of Jesús Leonardo Asúnsolo Jacques, son of wealthy farmers and director of the Bank of Durango, and Antonia López Negrete, who belonged to one of the richest families in the country, whose lineage went back to Spain and the viceregal nobility.

Her parents were members of the Mexican aristocracy that existed during the Porfiriato (period in the history of Mexico when the dictator Porfirio Díaz was the president). On her mother&#x27;s side, she was a cousin of the filmmaker Julio Bracho and of actors Ramón Novarro (one of the ‘Latin Lovers’ of the silent cinema) and Andrea Palma (another prominent actress of the Mexican cinema). On her father&#x27;s side, she was a cousin of the Mexican sculptor Ignacio Asúnsolo and the social activist and model María Asúnsolo. Additionally, she was the aunt of the actress Diana Bracho.

Del Río&#x27;s family lost all its assets during the Mexican Revolution that spanned from 1910 to 1920. Durango aristocratic families were threatened by the insurrection that Pancho Villa was leading in the region. The Asúnsolo family decided to escape, her father to the United States, and she and her mother to Mexico City on a train, disguised as peasants. In 1912, the Asúnsolo family reunited in Mexico City and lived under the protection of then-president Francisco I. Madero, who was a cousin of Mrs. Asúnsolo.

Del Río attended the Collège Français de Saint-Joseph, a college run by French nuns and located in Mexico City. She also developed a great taste for dance, that awakened in her when her mother took her to one of the performances of the Russian dancer Ana Pavlova, where she was fascinated by seeing her dance and decided to become a dancer herself. She confirmed her decision later when she witnessed the performances of Antonia Mercé &quot;La Argentina&quot; in Mexico City. She then persuaded her mother to allow her to take dance lessons with the respected teacher Felipita López. However, she suffered from great insecurity and felt like an ‘ugly duckling’. Her mother commissioned the renowned painter Alfredo Ramos Martínez (famous painter of the Mexican aristocracy) to paint a portrait of her daughter. The portrait helped her overcome her insecurities. In 1921, aged 17, del Río was invited by a group of Mexican women to dance in a party to benefit a local hospital. At this party, she met Jaime Martínez del Río y Viñent, son of a wealthy family. Jaime had been educated in the United Kingdom and had spent some time in Europe. After a two-month courtship, the couple wed on 11 April 1921. It was from him that she inherited her artistic surname.

Her honeymoon with Jaime lasted two years and they carried it out traveling through Europe, where in a stop at Spain, Del Río danced for the kings of Spain (Alfonso XIII and Victoria Eugenie), who were fascinated to see her perform a dance for the soldiers of the war in Morocco.The kings thanked her deeply and the queen gave her a photograph. Returning to Mexico, Jaime decided to dedicate himself to growing cotton at his ranch called Las Cruces, in Nazas, Durango. However, a fall in the world cotton market in 1924, caused an economic crisis for both and had to settle in Mexico City under the economic protection of their respective families. For her part, she had to sell her jewelry to try to recover some of the fortune she had lost with her husband. In addition to this, Dolores arrived pregnant when they returned to the country and had complications that could not be overcome, which caused a miscarriage and after which the doctors recommended not to get pregnant again since it would be very dangerous, taking away the possibility of having children.

==Career==
=== 1925–1929: Silent film stardom ===

In early 1925, the painter Adolfo Best Maugard, close friend of del Río and her husband, visited their home and with him was an American filmmaker Edwin Carewe, an influential director at First National Pictures, who was in Mexico for the wedding of actors Bert Lytell and Claire Windsor. Carewe was fascinated with del Río and became determined to have her, so he invited the couple to work in Hollywood. He convinced Jaime, saying he could turn his wife into a movie star, “The female equivalent of Rudolph Valentino.” Jaime thought that this proposal was a response to their economic needs. Deep down, he could also fulfill his old dream of writing screenplays in Hollywood. Breaking with all the canons of Mexican society at that time and against their families wishes, they journeyed by train to the United States to start a career in film within that country. They arrived in Hollywood on 27 August of that year, where del Río was contracted by Carewe and he began to act as her agent, manager, producer and director. Her name was shortened to ‘Dolores Del Rio’ (with an incorrect capital ‘D’ in the word ‘del’). Seeking to get her wide public attention, Carewe made a report dedicated to del Río in the major magazines in Hollywood which said:

She made her film debut in &quot;Joanna&quot; (1925), directed by Carewe and released that year. In the film del Río plays the role of Carlotta De Silva, a vamp of Spanish-Brazilian origin, but she appeared for only five minutes. While continuing with his advertising campaign for del Río, Carewe cast her in a secondary role in the film &quot;High Steppers&quot; (1926), starring Mary Astor. In the same year, Carl Laemmle, the head of Universal Studios, cast del Río in the comedy &quot;The Whole Town&#x27;s Talking&quot;. These films were not big hits, but helped increase her profile with the movie-going public. Del Rio got her first starring role in the comedy &quot;Pals First&quot; (1926) also directed by Carewe.

In 1926, the filmmaker Raoul Walsh called del Río to cast her in the war film &quot;What Price Glory?&quot;. The film was a commercial success, becoming the second highest-grossing title of the year, grossing nearly $2 million in the United States alone. That same year, thanks to the remarkable progress in her career, she was selected as one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars of 1926, along with fellow newcomers Joan Crawford, Mary Astor, Janet Gaynor, Fay Wray and others.

In 1927, United Artists became interested in del Río&#x27;s career and signed a contract with her and Carewe. Under the production of the studio, the film &quot;Resurrection&quot; (1927), was filmed. Rod La Rocque was chosen to play her co-star. Due to the success of the film, del Río quickly began shooting &quot;The Loves of Carmen&quot;, again directed by Raoul Walsh.
In 1928, del Río filmed &quot;No Other Woman&quot; (1928), directed by Lou Tellegen. When actress Renée Adorée began to show symptoms of tuberculosis, del Río was selected for the lead role of the MGM film &quot;The Trail of &#x27;98&quot;, directed by Clarence Brown. The film was a huge success and brought favorable reviews from critics. Also in 1928, she was hired again by United Artists for the third film version of the successful novel &quot;Ramona&quot;, directed again by Carewe. The success of the film was helped by the same name musical theme, written by L. Wolfe Gilbert and recorded by del Río. &quot;Ramona&quot; was the first United Artists film with synchronized sound and it is also one of the first Hollywood films to feature a soundtrack.

In late 1928, Hollywood was concerned with the conversion to sound films. On 29 March, at Mary Pickford&#x27;s bungalow, United Artists brought together Pickford, del Río, Douglas Fairbanks, Charles Chaplin, Norma Talmadge, Gloria Swanson, John Barrymore, and D. W. Griffith to speak on the radio show &quot;The Dodge Brothers Hour&quot; to prove they could meet the challenge of talking movies. Del Río surprised the audience by singing ‘Ramona’ proving to be an actress with the skills needed for sound cinema.

Although her career blossomed, her personal life was turbulent. Her marriage to Jaime Martínez ended in 1928. After a brief separation, Dolores filed for divorce. Six months later, she received news that Jaime had died in Germany. As if this were not enough, del Río had to suffer incessant harassment from her discoverer, Edwin Carewe, who did not cease in his attempt to conquer her. Del Río never felt attracted to Carewe. She only felt gratitude for his support and his romantic advances began to bother her. In the same year, del Rio made her third film with Raoul Walsh, &quot;The Red Dance&quot; (1928).

 Her next project was &quot;Evangeline&quot; (1929) a new production of United Artists also directed by Carewe and inspired by the epic poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The film was accompanied again by a theme song written by Al Jolson and Billy Rose and played by del Río. Like &quot;Ramona&quot;, the film was released with a Vitaphone disc selection of dialogue, music and sound effects.
Edwin Carewe still had ambitions to marry del Río, with the intent that they become a famous Hollywood couple. Carewe prepared his divorce from his wife Mary Atkin and seeded false rumors about a romance with del Río in campaigns of his films. During the filming of &quot;Evangeline&quot;, del Río considered separating professionally from Carewe, seeking support and advice from United Artists lawyers, since Carewe had an exclusivity contract signed by her.

In New York, following the successful premiere of &quot;Evangeline&quot;, and upon recommendation of the firm&#x27;s lawyers, del Río declared to the reporters: &quot;Mr. Carewe and I are just friends and companions in the art of the cinema. I will not marry Mr. Carewe.&quot; Eventually, she canceled her contract with him. Furious, Carewe filed criminal charges against del Río alleging breach of contract. Advised by United Artists lawyers, del Río reached an agreement with Carewe out of court, paying compensation. In spite of this settlement, Carewe started a campaign against her. In order to eclipse her, he filmed a new sound version of &quot;Resurrection&quot; starring Lupe Vélez, another popular Mexican film star and with whom the public assumed that del Río had a rivalry.

Having finally broken off professionally from Carewe, del Río was prepared for the filming of her first talkie: &quot;The Bad One&quot;, directed by George Fitzmaurice. The film was released in June 1930 with great success. Critics said that del Río could speak and sing in English with a charming accent. She was a suitable star for the talkies.

===1930–1936: Transition to sound films===

In 1930, del Río met Cedric Gibbons, an art director at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and one of the most influential men in Hollywood, at a party at Hearst Castle. The couple began a romance and married on August 6, 1930. Shortly after her marriage, del Río fell seriously ill with a severe kidney infection. The doctors recommended long bed rest. This caused the end of her contract with United Artists because the studio considered that if actresses were inactive they were not profitable. When she regained her health, she was hired exclusively by the producer David O. Selznick as an exclusive star of RKO Pictures. Her first film with the studio was &quot;Girl of the Rio&quot; released in 1931, and directed by Herbert Brenon.

In 1932, Selznick entrusted filmmaker King Vidor with a new and ambitious project. Selznick told Vidor: &quot;I want del Río and Joel McCrea in a love story in the South Seas. I didn&#x27;t have much of a story for the film, but be sure that it ends with del Río jumping into a volcano.&quot; The film &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot; (1932) was shot in Hawaii and del Río became a beautiful Polynesian native. The film premiered on 13 September 1932 in New York, earning rave reviews. &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot; became somewhat controversial due to del Rio&#x27;s daring costumes, as well as a revealing swimming scene. This film was made before the Production Code was strictly enforced.


As RKO got the result they expected, in 1933 they quickly decided to have del Rio do another film, a musical comedy directed by Thornton Freeland: &quot;Flying Down to Rio&quot;. In the film, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers first appeared as dance partners. It featured del Río opposite Fred Astaire in an intricate dance number called &quot;Orchids in the Moonlight&quot;. In this film, del Rio became the first major actress to wear a two-piece women&#x27;s bathing suit on-screen. But after the premiere, RKO were worried about their economic problems and decided not to renew del Río&#x27;s contract.

Jack Warner offered her a starring role in two films for Warner Bros. The studio was interested in promoting del Río as the answer to MGM&#x27;s Greta Garbo and Paramount&#x27;s Marlene Dietrich. Del Río&#x27;s first project with Warner was the musical comedy &quot;Wonder Bar&quot; (1934), directed by Lloyd Bacon. Busby Berkeley was the choreographer and Al Jolson her co-star. Del Río shared the female lead role with Kay Francis. But del Río and Jolson were gradually stealing the show. Del Río&#x27;s character grew, while the character of Francis was reduced so she threatened several times to leave filming. The film was released in March 1934 and was a success for Warners.
Her second film with Warners was &quot;Madame Du Barry&quot; (also 1934) with William Dieterle as director. Dieterle focused on her beauty with the help of an extraordinary wardrobe designed for Dolores by Orry Kelly (considered one of the most beautiful and expensive at the time). But &quot;Madame Du Barry&quot; was a major cause of dispute between the studio and the Hays Code office, primarily because it presented the court of Louis XV as ‘a sex farce centered around del Rio’. The film was severely mutilated by censorship and was not the success anticipated. Even so, the film is considered one of the most popular del Río films in her period in Hollywood cinema.

In the same year, del Río, along with the Mexican Hollywood stars Ramón Novarro and Lupe Vélez, attended a special screening of the Mexican film &quot;¡Que viva México!&quot; in Los Angeles. The film was directed by the Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein, and was accused of promoting Communism in California with nationalist sentiment and socialist overtones. It was the first time that del Río was accused of being a communist in the United States, a circumstance that would eventually have consequences in her career inside the American film industry.

Warner called her again in 1935 to star in another musical comedy called &quot;In Caliente&quot; (1935), where she portrayed a sultry Mexican dancer who has an affair with the character of actor Pat O&#x27;Brien. Around the same time, she starred in &quot;I Live for Love&quot; (also 1935), with Busby Berkeley as director. The film had dance numbers and Berkeley focused on her glamour with a sophisticated wardrobe. The last film she made with Warners was &quot;The Widow from Monte Carlo&quot; of 1936, which went unnoticed. The studio terminated its contract with del Río after expectations were not met.

===1937–1942: Decline in Hollywood===
With the support of Universal Studios, in 1937 del Río filmed &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Playground&quot; opposite Chester Morris and Richard Dix. However, despite the popularity of the three stars, the film was a failure. Del Río would decide to emigrate and sign a contract with 20th Century Fox to star in two films with George Sanders. She appeared with him in &quot;Lancer Spy&quot; of 1937 and &quot;International Settlement&quot; of 1938. Both films were box-office failures. These cinematographic failures caused her to focus on advertising, becoming known for advertisements in &quot;Lucky Strike&quot; (a cigarettes brand) and &quot;Max Factor&quot; (a makeup brand).

Cedric Gibbons used his influence with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and gained for del Río the main female role in the 1940 film &quot;The Man from Dakota&quot;. But despite his position in the studio, Gibbons was never able to help his wife achieve a higher profile, as the main figures of that company at the time were Garbo, Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford and Jean Harlow. Studio executives admired del Río&#x27;s beauty, but her career did not interest them, as at the time, Latin stars had few opportunities to shine at the studio. She was put on a list entitled &quot;box office poison&quot;, (along with stars like Crawford, Garbo, Katharine Hepburn, Marlene Dietrich, Mae West and others). The list was submitted to Los Angeles newspapers by an independent movie theater whose point was that these stars&#x27; high salaries and public prominence did not counteract the low ticket sales for their movies.
Amid the decline of her career, her marriage with Gibbons began to experience a crisis and the two began to drift apart. In 1940 del Río met actor and filmmaker Orson Welles at a party organized by Darryl Zanuck. The couple felt a mutual attraction and began a discreet affair, which caused her divorce from Gibbons. While looking for ways to resume her career, she accompanied Welles in his shows across the United States, in works on radio and performances at the Mercury Theatre. Del Río was at his side during the filming and controversy of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941). The film, considered a masterpiece today, caused a media scandal by directing open criticism against the media magnate William Randolph Hearst, who began to boycott Orson&#x27;s projects.

At the beginning of 1942, she started working on &quot;Journey into Fear&quot; (released in 1943) with Norman Foster as director and Welles as producer. Her relationship with Welles, in the midst of the &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; scandal, somehow affected her, as her character was drastically reduced in the film. Nelson Rockefeller, in charge of the Good Neighbor policy (and also associated with RKO through his family investments), hired Welles to visit South America as an ambassador of goodwill to counter fascist propaganda about Americans. Welles left the film four days later and traveled to Rio de Janeiro as part of his goodwill tour. Welles, involved in filming the carnival in Rio de Janeiro, falling into the party and excesses, and the news came soon to the United States. Offended and outraged, del Río decided to end her relationship with Welles through a telegram that he never answered. Weeks later, her father died in Mexico. Due to these personal and professional crises, she decided to return to Mexico, commenting:

===1943–1959: Mexican Cinema===
Del Río had been sought by Mexican film directors since the late 1930s. She was considered to star in the Mexican films &quot;La Noche de los Mayas&quot; and &quot;Santa&quot;. Of the latter, Orson Welles himself helped correct the script. But economic circumstances were not favorable for the entry of del Río to the Mexican cinema. She also maintained friendly ties with figures of Mexican art and culture (such as Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo). After breaking off her relationship with Welles, del Río returned to Mexico.

As soon as she returned to her country, del Río began to listen to movie offers. Mexican filmmaker Emilio &quot;El Indio&quot; Fernández invited her to film &quot;Flor silvestre&quot; (1943). Fernandez was a great admirer and he was eager to direct her. &quot;Flor silvestre&quot; was del Río&#x27;s first Spanish-language film. The film gathers a successful film crew consisting of Fernandez, the cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa, the screenwriter Mauricio Magdaleno and del Río and Pedro Armendariz as the stars. The film was a huge box office success and allowed del Río to maintain her prestige as an actress.

Subsequently, del Río and Fernández’ film crew filmed &quot;María Candelaria&quot;. The film tells the story of a native indigenous woman from the lake region of Xochimilco, who is despised by her people. Fernández has said that he wrote an original version of the plot on 13 napkins while sitting in a restaurant. He was anxious because he was in love with del Río and could not afford to buy her a birthday present. However, there were tense moments during the filming of the film. Fernández could not hide his love for del Río and, faced with her rejection of his advances, he began to be very demanding and violent. Del Río showed great professionalism and finished filming, despite several threats to abandon the film. &quot;María Candelaria&quot; was the first Mexican film to be screened at the Cannes International Film Festival where it won the Grand Prix (now known as the Palme d&#x27;Or) becoming the first Latin American film to do so.
Her third film with Fernández &quot;Las Abandonadas&quot; (1944), was a then controversial film where del Río plays a woman who gives up her son and falls into the world of prostitution. The film was about to be banned due to protests from the Mexican army, because the film spoke of a criminal gang infiltrated in the Mexican armed forces. These controversies ensured the film&#x27;s box office success. Her performance as an actress was recognized by the Mexican Film Academy and she received the Silver Ariel Award for Best Actress.

&quot;Bugambilia&quot; (1944) was her fourth movie directed by Fernández. As del Rio did not respond to the director&#x27;s love advances, &quot;Bugambilia&quot; filming became a torture for both and for the rest of the team, who had to endure the mood swings of the director and the constant threats of del Río leaving the film. When the film was completed in January 1945, del Río announced that she would never again work with Fernández.

In 1945, del Río filmed &quot;La selva de fuego&quot; (1945) directed by Fernando de Fuentes. The script of this film came to her in error, because of a confused messaging. The film had been specially created for María Félix, another notable Mexican movie star. Félix meanwhile, received the script for &quot;Vértigo&quot; (1946), a film originally created for del Río. When the two stars realized the mistake they refused to return the scripts. Del Río was fascinated by playing a different character in which she showed off with a provocative costume, remembering her time as a sex symbol in Hollywood. Because of this anecdote the press began speculating a strong rivalry between del Río and Felix.

After breaking off her film collaboration with Emilio Fernández, del Río began a film partnership with director Roberto Gavaldón. Del Río plays twin sisters in the film &quot;La Otra&quot; (1946), her first film under Gavaldón&#x27;s direction. This film later inspired the movie &quot;Dead Ringer&quot;, starring Bette Davis in 1964.
In 1947, del Río was invited by the film director John Ford to play the role of an indigenous woman who falls in love with a fugitive priest (Henry Fonda) in the film &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, an adaptation of the novel &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; by Graham Greene. The movie was filmed in Mexico and Emilio Fernández also served as associate producer. But from the beginning of its filming, the film caused controversy in the United States, accusing it of being a promoter of communism. Del Río was attacked again for having taken part in what was being called &quot;a communist project&quot;. 
After the filming of &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, del Río traveled to Argentina to film &quot;Story of a Bad Woman&quot; (&quot;Historia de una mala mujer&quot;, 1948), a film adaptation of the Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;, directed by Luis Saslavsky. While shooting in Buenos Aires, del Río was pursued by none other than First Lady Evita Peron. Peron invited del Río to tea, but del Río declined because of her filmmaking schedule. The next day, the government issued an order that the film industry was to shut down completely so del Río could have tea with Mrs. Peron. But her friendship with Evita was not viewed favorably by Hollywood&#x27;s communist hunters either. In an interview with Hedda Hopper from Argentina, del Río claimed to be unconcerned about the controversy surrounding her two last films. According to Hopper, &quot;Del Río said controversy added millions of dollars to the profit of the pictures&quot;.

Del Río accepted working again with Emilio Fernández and her film team in the film &quot;La Malquerida&quot; (1949). The film is based on the novel of the Spanish writer Jacinto Benavente. Del Río gained good notices for her portrayal of &quot;Raymunda&quot;, a woman confronted by her own daughter for the love of a man. The role of her daughter was played by actress Columba Dominguez. Domínguez was Fernández&#x27;s new romantic partner, and this situation caused tension on the set and speculation from the press. 

In 1949, del Río met the American millionaire Lewis A. Riley in Acapulco. Riley was well known in Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s for his collaboration with the Hollywood Canteen and his brief romance with Bette Davis. They started a romance. That same year, del Río&#x27;s cousin, activist and feminist Maria Asúnsolo, asked her to sign a document for a ‘conference for the world peace’. Del Río never imagined that this document would point her out again as a supporter of international communism.

Del Río starred in &quot;Doña Perfecta&quot; (1951), based on the novel by Benito Perez Galdos. For this work she won her second Silver Ariel Award for Best Actress. Gavaldón directed her again in the film &quot;El Niño y la Niebla&quot; (1953). Her portrayal of an overprotective mother with a mental instability attracted critical acclaim and she was honored with her third Silver Ariel Award.

In 1954, del Río was slated to appear as the wife of Spencer Tracy&#x27;s character in the 20th Century Fox film &quot;Broken Lance&quot;. But the U.S. government denied her permission to work in the United States, accusing her of being sympathetic to international communism. The document signed by her cheering for world peace, as well as her links with figures openly communist (as Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo were) and her past relationship with Orson Welles, had been interpreted in the United States as sympathy with communism. She was replaced in the film by Katy Jurado. Del Río was one of the many on the blacklist of McCarthyism. She reacted by sending a letter to the U.S. government, stating:

While her situation was being remedied in the United States, del Río accepted the proposal of filming in Spain another adaptation of a novel by Benavente, &quot;Señora Ama&quot; (1955), directed by her cousin, the filmmaker Julio Bracho. Unfortunately the prevailing censorship in the Spanish cinema caused the film to be seriously truncated during editing.

In 1956, her political situation in the United States was resolved. She began to listen with interest to theatrical offerings. Del Río was already thinking that the play &quot;Anastasia&quot; of Marcelle Maurette, would be a good choice for her debut. To prepare for this new facet of her career, she engaged the services of Stella Adler as her acting coach. Del Río debuted successfully at the theater on the Falmouth Playhouse in Massachusetts on July 6, 1956 and to continue with a tour of seven other theaters throughout New England. She took advantage of her return to the United States and granted an interview to Louella Parsons to make clear her political position: &quot;In Mexico we are worried and fighting against communism.&quot; In 1957, she was selected as vice president of the jury of the 1957 Cannes Film Festival. She was the first woman to sit on the jury. In 1957, she debuted in television in the role of a Spanish lady in the American television series &quot;Schlitz Playhouse of Stars&quot;, opposite Cesar Romero.

In 1959, Mexican filmmaker Ismael Rodríguez brought del Río and her alleged rival María Félix together in the film &quot;La Cucaracha&quot;. The meeting of the two actresses, considered the main female stars of Mexican cinema, was a success at the box office. Although the press speculated that a war would break out between the two actresses, the truth is that the filming went smoothly and both ended up forming friendly ties. That same year, she married Lewis Riley in a private ceremony in New York.

===1960–1970: Return to Hollywood, television and theatre===

Del Río and Riley founded their own production company called Producciones Visuales. and they produced numerous theater projects featuring del Río. Mexican writer Salvador Novo became the translator of her plays. Her first production in Mexico City was Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;, which she had made as a film in Argentina a decade earlier. She toured Mexico in the play, an enterprise that was both financially and critically successful, and she later took it to Buenos Aires. In 1958, the play &quot;The Road to Rome&quot;, would mark the reunion in the theater of the film couple del Río-Pedro Armendáriz. But the temperamental Armendáriz left the project in rehearsals due to differences with the director. He was replaced by another actor, but the project did not prosper and was a failure at the box office.

Del Río returned to Hollywood after 18 years. She was hired by Fox to play the role of the mother of Elvis Presley&#x27;s character in the film &quot;Flaming Star&quot; (1960), directed by Don Siegel. Her arrival in Hollywood caused excitement and she was warmly received by fellow actors, the press and staff members, some of whom she had known since her arrival in Hollywood in 1925. In 1964 she appeared in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Cheyenne Autumn&quot;, playing the role of the Cheyenne mother of Sal Mineo. Figures like Richard Widmark, Karl Malden, James Stewart and Edward G. Robinson also appear in the film. In 1967, the Italian filmmaker Francesco Rosi invited her to be part of the movie &quot;More Than a Miracle&quot; (also 1967) with Sophia Loren and Omar Sharif. She played Sharif&#x27;s character&#x27;s mother.
Throughout the 1960s, del Río produced and starred in Mexico in theater projects such as &quot;Ghosts&quot; (1962), &quot;Dear Liar: A Comedy of Letters&quot; (1963), &quot;La Voyante&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Queen and the Rebels&quot; (1967)

She also appeared in the American TV shows &quot;The Dinah Shore Chevy Show&quot; (1960), &quot;I Spy&quot;, &quot;Branded&quot; (1966) and in the TV movie &quot;The Man Who Bought Paradise&quot; (1965), opposite Angie Dickinson and Buster Keaton. In 1968, del Río first performed on Mexican television in an autobiographical documentary narrated by her.

In 1970, she produced and starred in theater &quot;The Lady of the Camellias&quot;. The project was originally directed by the Broadway producer José Quintero. However, despite having received a high salary, the producer did not commit to the project and constantly appeared drunk. Del Río and her husband decided to fire him and were legally sued by the director. The matter was cleared up in court and delayed the premiere of the play, which was a great box office success, despite production problems. Del Río was acclaimed at daring to play a 65-year-old &quot;Marguerite Gautier&quot;. Her last appearance on television was in a 1970 episode of &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;.

===1970–1983: Philanthropy and cultural ambassador===
Since the late 1950s, del Río became a main promoter of the Acapulco International Film Review, serving as host on numerous occasions. In 1966, del Río was co-founder of the Society for the Protection of the Artistic Treasures of Mexico with the philanthropist Felipe García Beraza. The society was responsible for protecting buildings, paintings and other works of art and culture in México.

On January 8, 1970, she, in collaboration with other renowned Mexican actresses and performers, such as Adela Peralta Leppe, founded the union group &quot;Rosa Mexicano&quot;, which provided a day nursery for the children of the members of the Mexican Actor&#x27;s Guild. Del Río was responsible for various activities to raise funds for the project and she trained in modern teaching techniques. She served as the president from its founding until 1981. After her death, the day nursery adopted the official name of &quot;Estancia Infantil Dolores del Río (The Dolores del Río Day Nursery&quot;), and today remains in existence.

In 1972, she helped found the Cultural Festival Cervantino in Guanajuato. Her deteriorating health led her to cancel two television projects in 1975. The American television series &quot;Who&#x27;ll See the Children?&quot; and Mexican telenovela &quot;Ven Amigo&quot;. In her work in supporting children she became a spokeswoman of UNICEF in Latin America and recorded a series of television commercials for the organization. 

In 1976, del Río was invited to serve as president of the jury of the San Sebastian International Film Festival, in Spain. There she generated a controversy about her position before the Mexican film &quot;The Heist&quot;. When the film was shown, del Río suddenly got up from her seat, disgusted by what for her was a repulsive film, &quot;&quot;a filth of such magnitude wrapped in the patriotic banner&quot;.&quot; In the face of this scandal, the film was denied the opportunity to win an award.

In 1978, Dolores made her last film appearance in &quot;The Children of Sanchez&quot;, directed by Hall Bartlett and starring Anthony Quinn. There she interprets the role of the grandmother. In the same year, the Mexican American Institute of Cultural Relations and the White House gave Dolores a diploma and a silver plaque for her work in cinema as a cultural ambassador of Mexico in the United States. During the ceremony she was remembered as a victim of McCarthyism.

At the age of 76, del Río appeared on the stage of the Palace of Fine Arts theater the evening of October 11, 1981 for a tribute at the 25th San Francisco International Film Festival. During the ceremony, filmmakers Francis Ford Coppola, Mervyn LeRoy and George Cukor spoke, with Cukor declaring del Rio as one of the &quot;First Ladies of American Cinema&quot;. This was her last known public appearance. In 1982, she was awarded the George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film.

== Personal life ==
=== Public image and character ===

Del Río always projected a special elegance with her beauty, more than just a ‘Latin bombshell’ such as other actresses like Lupe Vélez. Del Rio&#x27;s intrinsic elegance was apparent even off-screen. Del Río strongly identified with her Mexican heritage despite her growing fame and her transition to ‘modernity’. She also felt strongly about being able to play Mexican roles and bemoaned the fact that she was not cast in them. She never relinquished her Mexican citizenship and said in 1929 (at the height of her popularity) that she wanted &quot;to play a Mexican woman and show what life in Mexico really is. No one has shown the artistic side – nor the social&quot;.

Del Río was considered one of the prototypes of female beauty in the 1930s. In 1933, the American film magazine &quot;Photoplay&quot; conducted a search for &quot;the most perfect female figure in Hollywood&quot;, using the criteria of doctors, artists and designers as judges. The ‘unanimous choice’ of these selective arbiters of female beauty was Del Río. The question posed by the search for the magazine and the methodology used to find ‘the most perfect female figure’ reveal a series of parameters that define femininity and feminine beauty at that particular moment in US history. Larry Carr (author of the book &quot;More Fabulous Faces&quot;) said Del Río&#x27;s appearance in the early 1930s influenced Hollywood. Women imitated her style of dress and makeup. A new kind of beauty occurred, and Del Río was the forerunner. She is also considered the pioneer of the two piece swimsuit.

According to Austrian-American filmmaker Josef von Sternberg, stars such as Del Río, Marlene Dietrich, Carole Lombard and Rita Hayworth helped him to define his concept of glamour in Hollywood.

When Del Río returned to Mexico, she radically changed her image. In Hollywood, she had lost ground to the modernity of the faces. In Mexico, she had the enormous fortune that filmmaker Emilio Fernández emphasized her Mexican indigenous features. She did not come to Mexico as the Hollywood ‘Latin bombshell’ transforming her makeup to highlight her indigenous features. Del Río defied the change that her appearance suffered in her native country: &quot;I took off my furs and diamonds, satin shoes and pearl necklaces; all swapped by the shawl and bare feet.&quot;

Del Río&#x27;s contemporaries comment about her image:

American actress Joan Crawford: &quot;Dolores became, and remains, as one of the most beautiful stars in the world&quot;.

German-American actress and singer Marlene Dietrich: &quot;Dolores del Río was the most beautiful woman who ever set foot in Hollywood&quot;. “Ah, this is the real beauty. We blondes have to work at it&quot;.

Playwright George Bernard Shaw: &quot;The two most beautiful things in the world are the Taj Mahal and Dolores del Río&quot;.

Fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli: &quot;I have seen many beautiful women in here, but none as complete as Dolores del Río!&quot;

Mexican painter Diego Rivera: &quot;The most beautiful, the most gorgeous of the west, east, north and south. I&#x27;m in love with her as 40 million Mexicans and 120 million Americans who can&#x27;t be wrong&quot;.

Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes: &quot;Garbo and Dietrich were women turned into goddesses. Del Río was a goddess about being a woman&quot;.

American photographer Jerome Zerbe: &quot;Dolores del Río and Marlene Dietrich are the most beautiful women I&#x27;ve ever photographed&quot;.

Russian-American photographer George Hoyningen-Huene: “The bone structure of her head and body is magnificent. Her skin is like ripe fruit”.

Australian-American costume designer Orry-Kelly: &quot;I draped her naked body in jersey. She wanted no underpinnings to spoil the line. When I finished draping her she became a Greek goddess as she walked close to the mirror and said, &quot;It is beautiful&quot;. Gazing into the mirror, she said in a half-whisper, &quot;Jesus, I am beautiful&quot;. Narcissistic? Probably yes, but she was right. She looked beautiful&quot;.

Mexican cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa: &quot;I have had great beauties in front of my camera. But the facial bones of Dolores del Río are incomparable. That has been said many times. What has not been said is that she had a privileged smooth skin, a beautiful brown color and a body really perfect&quot;.

American actor and director Orson Welles: &quot;Del Río represented the highest erotic ideal with her performance in the film &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot;.

Del Río herself commented on her face and image: &quot;Take care of your inner beauty, your spiritual beauty, and that will reflect in your face. We have the face we created over the years. Every bad deed, every bad fault will show on your face. God can give us beauty and genes can give us our features, but whether that beauty remains or changes is determined by our thoughts and deeds.&quot;

In 1952, she was awarded the Neiman Marcus Fashion Award and was called the &quot;best-dressed woman in America&quot;.

=== Relationships ===
Del Río married Jaime Martínez del Río in 1921. Her marriage ended in 1928. The differences between the couple emerged after settling in Hollywood. In Mexico she had been the wife of Jaime Martinez del Río, but in Hollywood Jaime became husband of a movie star. The trauma of a miscarriage added to the marital difficulties and del Río was advised not to have children. After a brief separation, Dolores filed for divorce. Six months later, she received news that Jaime had died in Germany.

In 1930, del Río met Cedric Gibbons, an art director at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and one of the most influential men in Hollywood, at a party at Hearst Castle. The couple began a romance and finally married on August 6, 1930. The del Rio-Gibbons were one of the most famous couples of Hollywood in the early thirties. They organized &#x27;Sunday brunches&#x27; in their Art Deco house at 757 Kingman Avenue in the Rustic Canyon neighborhood of Pacific Palisades. Many celebrities would attend and play tennis or swim in the pool including Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, Gary Cooper and Cary Grant. The couple divorced in 1941. Del Río alleged before the judge in her divorce that her relationship with her husband had become cold and distant due to their work commitments.

In 1949 she met the American millionaire Lewis A. Riley in Acapulco. Riley was known in the Hollywood cinema in the forties for being a member of the Hollywood Canteen, an organization created by movie stars to support relief efforts in World War II. At that time Riley was engaged in a torrid affair with Bette Davis. Del Río and Riley started a romance. In 1959, the couple married in New York after ten years of relationship. They remained together until her death in 1983.

Regardless of her marriages, at different times in her life some attribute romances with actor Errol Flynn, filmmaker John Farrow, writer Erich Maria Remarque, film producer Archibaldo Burns, and actor Tito Junco.
Mexican filmmaker Emilio Fernández was one of her admirers. He said that he had appeared as an extra in several films of del Río in Hollywood just to be near her. The beauty and elegance of del Río had impressed him deeply. Fernández said: &quot;I fell in love with her, but she always ignored me. I adored her ... really I adored her.&quot;

=== Orson Welles ===

Del Río met actor and filmmaker Orson Welles at a party organized by Darryl Zanuck. The couple felt a mutual attraction and began a discreet affair. Welles had been infatuated with her since adolescence. He declared: &quot;That&#x27;s when I fell in love with her&quot;. He later said: &quot;She changed my life&quot;. Their relationship was kept secret until 1941, when del Río filed for divorce from Cedric Gibbons. They openly appeared together in New York while Welles was directing the Mercury stage production &quot;Native Son&quot;. After del Río filed for divorce, she threw herself into Welles&#x27; chaotic world, considering his intellect &quot;second to none, not even Shakespeare.&quot; Welles was equally complimentary. &quot;She lives so graciously. Everyone around her loves her. She is the one girl you can be with and not feel the need for conversation. She has a mind full of talk, though, when she wants&quot;. Throughout the filming of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, del Río was often at the difficult Welles&#x27; side, soothing him when he banged his head against the wall and dealing with his insomnia as he abused Dexedrine. They acted together in the movie &quot;Journey into Fear&quot; (1943).

Her relationship with Welles ended after four years largely due to his infidelities. Welles, involved in filming the carnival in Rio de Janeiro, behaved promiscuously and the news came soon to the United States. Offended and outraged, del Río decided to end her relationship with Welles through a telegram that he never answered. He later married Rita Hayworth, &quot;The New Dolores del Río of Hollywood&quot;.

But Welles never got over her completely, and off and on he went to Mexico in usually fruitless attempts to see her, or sent his children, whom she did receive.
Rebecca Welles, the daughter of Welles and Hayworth, expressed her desire to travel to Mexico to meet Dolores on her 18th birthday. In 1962, Dolores received her at her home in Acapulco. After their meeting, Rebecca said: &quot;My father considered Dolores the great love of his life. She is a living legend in the history of my family.&quot; According to Rebecca, until the end of his life, Welles felt for del Río a kind of obsession. 
For the rest of her life del Río kept a card with two beautiful slanted eyes (easily identifiable as Dolores&#x27;s own) and a dove drawing along a banner inscribed with the word &quot;always&quot; and signed &quot;Orson&quot;.

===Alleged rivalries===
There are many anecdotes about her rivalry with fellow Mexican actress Lupe Vélez. Del Río never understood the quarrel that Vélez kept with her. Vélez hated del Río, and called her &quot;bird of bad omen&quot;. Del Río was terrified to meet her in public places. When this happened, Vélez was scathing and aggressive. Vélez openly mimicked del Río, ironically making fun of her elegance. But the prestige of del Río was known and respected, and Vélez could not ignore this. Vélez wore spectacular costumes, but never reached del Río&#x27;s supreme elegance. Vélez was popular, had many friends and devoted fans, but never attended the social circle in Hollywood, where del Río was accepted without reservations. Vélez spoke ill of del Río, but del Río never mentioned her name in an offensive way. Vélez evidently resented Del Rio&#x27;s success during the years in which both met in Hollywood.

There was media speculation about a strong rivalry between del Rio and María Félix, another successful actress of the Mexican Cinema. Félix said in her autobiography: &quot;With Dolores I don&#x27;t have any rivalry. On the contrary. We were friends and we always treated each other with great respect. We were completely different. She [was] refined, interesting, soft on the deal, and I&#x27;m more energetic, arrogant and bossy&quot;. Félix said in another interview: &quot;Dolores del Río was a great lady. She behaved like a princess. A very intelligent and very funny woman. I appreciate her very much and I have great memories of her&quot;.

=== Final years and death ===

In 1978, she was diagnosed with osteomyelitis. Del Río used to give herself vitamin injections periodically. One of the syringes is believed to have been contaminated and was diagnosed with hepatitis C in 1981. In 1982, del Río was admitted to Scripps Hospital, La Jolla, California, where hepatitis led to cirrhosis.

Del Río spent the last two years of her life at her Newport Beach residence with her husband Lew and only received visits from a few friends and family. The last two years of her life were spent seriously ill, with prolonged hospital stays. Before her death, she designated her husband Lew as her heir, ensuring that her portraits and art objects were placed in various museums after her death. 

On April 11, 1983, Dolores del Río died from liver failure at the age of 78 in Newport Beach, California. It is said that the day she died, an invitation to attend the Oscars was sent to her. She was cremated and her ashes were moved from the United States to Mexico where they were buried at the Panteón de Dolores in Mexico City, Mexico. Lew Riley died in Newport Beach in 2005.

In 2004, to commemorate the centenary of her birth, and as part of a series of posthumous tributes, the Mexican government interred her remains at the Rotunda of Illustrious Persons, located in the same cemetery and where the remains are found of some of the most outstanding Mexican personalities of art and culture.

== Legacy ==

Del Río was the first Mexican actress to succeed in Hollywood. In her wake others followed including Lupe Vélez and Katy Jurado. In recent years other Mexican stars that have achieved a place in Hollywood include Salma Hayek, and Eiza González.

=== In art and literature ===
The physical characteristics of del Río made her a figure of veneration even beyond death. From a young age, del Río had the intelligence to know how to surround herself with personalities of the intellectual environment. The Hollywood myth placed del Río in another area, as she became one of the women related to the renaissance of Mexican culture and customs.

The face of del Río was also the object of veneration for many artists who shaped her image on their canvases. In 1916, when del Río was 11 years old, she was first portrayed by Alfredo Ramos Martínez, a very popular artist among Mexican high society. In the 1920s, del Río was also embodied in the canvases of Mexican painters Roberto Montenegro and Ángel Zárraga. In 1938, the actress was portrayed by her close friend, the famous Mexican artist Diego Rivera. The portrait was made in New York. It was del Río&#x27;s favorite portrait and occupied a special place in her home in Mexico. Rivera also captured the image of del Río in some of his paintings and murals, highlighting &quot;La vendedorea de flores&quot;, &quot;La pollera&quot; and &quot;La Creacion&quot;.

In 1941, del Río was also portrayed by the famous Mexican muralist José Clemente Orozco. The portrait was made at the request of Orson Welles. Unfortunately, when the artist painted the portrait he was already losing his sight. Del Río said: &quot;He painted his tragedy on my face!&quot; Although the portrait was not liked by the actress, it had a very important place in her home. Other artists who recorded her image in her paintings were Miguel Covarrubias, Rosa Rolanda, Antonieta Figueroa, Frances Gauner Goshman, Adolfo Best Maugard and John Carroll.

In 1970, the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura, the Mexico&#x27;s Screen Actors Guild, the Humane Society of the Artistic Treasures of Mexico and the Motion Picture Export Association of America paid her a tribute titled &quot;Dolores del Rio in the Art&quot; in which her main portraits and a sculpture by Francisco Zúñiga were exhibited.
In her will, del Río stipulated that all her artworks be donated to the National Institute of Fine Arts and Literature of Mexico, for display in various museums in Mexico City, including the National Museum of Art, the Museum of Art Carillo Gil and the Diego Rivera &amp; Frida Kahlo House-Studio.

Del Río was the model of the statue of &quot;Evangeline&quot;, the heroine of Longfellow&#x27;s romantic poem located in St. Martinville, Louisiana. The statue was donated by del Río, who played Evangeline in the 1929 film.

Poet Salvador Novo wrote her a sonnet and translated all her stage plays. She inspired Jaime Torres Bodet&#x27;s novel &quot;La Estrella de Día&quot; (&quot;Star of the Day&quot;), published in 1933, which chronicles the life of an actress named &quot;Piedad&quot;. Vicente Leñero was inspired by del Río to write his book, &quot;Señora&quot;. Carlos Pellicer also wrote her a poem in 1967. In 1982, del Río and Maria Félix were parodied in the novel &quot;Orchids in the Moonlight: Mexican Comedy&quot; by Carlos Fuentes. Other authors who wrote her poems were Xavier Villaurrutia, Celestino Gorostiza and Pita Amor. Carlos Monsiváis and Jorge Ayala Blanco also made her a tribute book on the occasion of the Ibero-American Film Festival of Huelva, in 1983. The book contains an essay by Monsiváis entitled &quot;Responsibilities of a face&quot;. Vicente Leñero also pays tribute to the book &quot;Señora&quot;.

After her death, her photo archive was given to the Carso Center for the Study of Mexican History by Lewis Riley.

<text>The Wolastoqiyik, also Wəlastəkwewiyik, Malecite or Maliseet () are an Algonquian-speaking First Nation of the Wabanaki Confederacy. They are the Indigenous people of the Wolastoq (Saint John River) valley and its tributaries. Their territory extends across the current borders of New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada, and parts of Maine in the United States.

The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their historical homeland, are—since 19 July 1776—the first foreign treaty allies with the United States of America. They are a federally recognized tribe of Wolastoqey people. Today Wolastoqey people have also migrated to other parts of the world. The Wolastoqiyik have occupied areas of forest, river and coastal areas within their 20,000,000-acre, 200-mile-wide, and 600-mile-long homeland in the Saint John River watershed.

==Name==
The people call themselves &quot;Wəlastəkwewiyik&quot; and &quot;Wolastoqiyik&quot;&#x27;. &quot;Wəlastəkw&quot; means &quot;bright river&quot; or &quot;shining river&quot; (&quot;wəl-&quot; = good, &quot;-as-&quot; shining, &quot;-təkw&quot; = river; &quot;-iyik&quot; = people of). Wəlastəkwiyik therefore simply means &quot;People of the Bright River&quot; in their native language. The Wolastoqiyik have long been associated with the Saint John River, from which they draw their name. Their territory still extends as far as the Saint Lawrence River. Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Miꞌkmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot, and on the south by the Passamaquoddy, who also still speak related Algonquian languages.

&quot;Malesse&#x27;jik&quot; was a Miꞌkmaq word believed to mean &quot;He speaks slowly,&quot; or differently, and was term that Miꞌkmaq people used to describe people from other nations. The meaning of the word today is unknown but it is commonly mistranslated to &quot;he speaks badly, lazy, or broken&quot;. This term is the exonym by which the Miꞌkmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans. The French met the Miꞌkmaq people before the Wəlastəkwewiyik, and transliterated &quot;Malesse&#x27;jik&quot; to &quot;Malécite&quot;, not understanding that it was not their name. The later English colonists anglicized this term as Maliseet.

Beginning in 1758, the terms &quot;Marichites&quot; in French and in English &quot;Maricheets&quot; increased in use.

==History==

===17th century===
At the time of European encounter, the Wəlastəkwewiyik were living in walled villages and practicing horticulture (corn, beans, squash and tobacco). In addition to cultivating and growing crops, the women gathered and processed fruits, berries, nuts and natural produce. The men contributed by fishing and hunting, and the women cooked these finds. Written accounts in the early 17th century, such as those of Samuel de Champlain and Marc LesCarbot, refer to a large Wolastoqey village at the mouth of the Saint John River. Later in the century, sources indicate their headquarters had shifted upriver to &quot;Meductic&quot;, on the middle reaches of the Saint John River.

The French explorers were the first to establish a fur trade with the Wəlastəkwewiyik, which became important in their territory. Some European goods were desired because they were useful to Wəlastəkwewiyik subsistence and culture. The French Jesuits also established missions, where some Wəlastəkwewiyik converted to Catholicism. After years of colonialism, many learned the French language. The French called them &quot;Malécite&quot;, a transliteration of the Mi&#x27;kmaq name for the people.

Local histories depict many encounters with the Iroquois, five powerful nations based south and east of the Great Lakes, and the Innu located to the north. Contact with European fisher-traders in the early 17th century and with specialized fur traders developed into a stable relationship which lasted for nearly 100 years. Despite devastating population losses to European infectious diseases, to which they had no immunity, these Atlantic First Nations held on to their traditional coastal or river locations for hunting, fishing and gathering. They lived along river valleys for trapping.

==== Colonial wars ====

As both the French and English increased the number of their settlers in North America, their competition grew for control of the fur trade and physical territory. In addition, wars were carried out that reflected war in Europe. The lucrative eastern fur trade faltered with the general unrest, as French and English hostilities concentrated in the region between Québec and Port-Royal. Increasing sporadic fighting and raiding also took place on the lower Saint John River.

In this period, Wolastoqey women took over a larger share of the economic burden and began to farm, raising crops which previously had been grown only south of Wolastoqey territory. Men continued to hunt, though with limited success. They became useful allies to the French as support against the English. For a short period during the late 17th and early 18th centuries, Wolastoqey warriors were engaged frequently in armed conflict, becoming virtually a military organization.

=== 18th century ===
With the gradual cessation of hostilities in the first quarter of the 18th century, and with the beaver supply severely diminished, fur trading declined. There was little possibility for the Wolastoqiyik to return to their traditional ways of life. Their style of seasonal, shifting agriculture on the river was curtailed by the encroachment of European settlers. All the while, the land was becoming well known to wealthy elites, who took advantage of the quality hunting and sport-fishing spots scattered throughout the province. They took all the farmland along the Saint John River, which was previously occupied by the Wolastoqiyik, displacing many Aboriginal people from more than a million and a half acres of prime land.

===19th century===
The Wolastoqiyik practised some traditional crafts as late as the 19th century, especially building wigwams and birchbark canoes. They had made changes during the previous two centuries while acquiring European metal cutting tools and containers, muskets and alcohol, foods and clothing. In making wood, bark or basketry items, or in guiding, trapping and hunting, the Wolastoqiyik identified as engaging in &quot;Indian work&quot;.

The Europeans developed potato farming in Maine and New Brunswick, which created a new market and demand for Wolastoqey baskets and containers. Other Wolastoqiyik worked in pulp mills, construction, nursing, teaching and business. With evidence that many Wolastoqiyik suffered widespread hunger and were wandering, government officials established the first Indian reserves at The Brothers, Oromocto, Fredericton, Kingsclear, Woodstock, Tobique, Madawaska (pre-1800s), and Cacouna.

Silas Tertius Rand was a linguist missionary who translated some Bible Selections into Wolastoqey which were published in 1863 and then the Gospel of John in 1870.

===20th century===
The Wolastoqiyik of New Brunswick struggled with problems of unemployment and poverty common to Indigenous people elsewhere in Canada, but they have evolved a sophisticated system of decision making and resource allocation. They support community enterprises in economic development, scouting and sports. Some are successful in middle and higher education and have important trade and professional standings; individuals and families are prominent in Indigenous and women&#x27;s rights; and others serve in provincial and federal native organizations, in government and in community development. There were 4,659 registered Wolastoqiyik in 1996.

==Culture==
The customs and language of the Wolastoqiyik are very similar to those of the neighbouring Passamaquoddy (&quot;Peskotomuhkati&quot;). They are also close to those of the Algonquian-speaking Miꞌkmaq and Penobscot peoples.

The Wəlastəkwewiyik differed from the Miꞌkmaq by pursuing a partial agrarian economy. They also overlapped territory with neighbouring peoples. The Wəlastəkwewiyik and Passamaquoddy languages are similar enough that linguists consider them slightly different dialects of the same language. Typically they are not differentiated for study.

In 1907, Natalie Curtis collected and published two traditional Wolastoqey songs: a dance song and a love song.
As transcribed by Curtis, the love song demonstrates a meter cycle of seven bars and switches between major and minor tonality.

Many other songs were recorded by anthropologist William H. Mechling, whose wax cylinder recordings of Wolastoqey songs are held by the Canadian Museum of History. Many of these songs were lost to the community, as the pressures to assimilate into mainstream Canadian culture led the Wolastoqiyik to stop passing their songs on to youth; in the 2010s, however, Wolastoqew musician Jeremy Dutcher undertook a project of listening to the wax cylinder recordings and reviving the songs. His album &quot;Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa&quot; was released in 2018, and won the 2018 Polaris Music Prize.

=== Ethnobotany ===
The Wolastoqiyik use the balsam fir tree (&quot;Abies balsamea&quot;) in many ways. Its juice is a laxative, its pitch is medical, and an infusion of its bark, sometimes mixed spruce and tamarack bark, can treat gonorrhea. They have used the fir&#x27;s needles and branches as pillows and bedding, the roots as thread, and its pitch to waterproof seams in canoes.

==Current situation==

Today, in New Brunswick, there are approximately 7,700 Wolastoqiyik with status in the Madawaska, Tobique, Woodstock, Kingsclear, Saint Mary&#x27;s and Oromocto First Nations. There are also 1700 in the Houlton Band in Maine, and 1200 in the in Quebec. The Brothers is a reserve made up of two islands in the Kennebecasis River; they are uninhabited but available for hunting and fishing.

About 650 native speakers of Wolastoqey remain, and about 500 of Passamaquoddy, living on both sides of the border between New Brunswick and Maine. Most are older, although some young people have begun studying and preserving the language. An active program of scholarship on the Wolastoqey-Passamaquoddy language takes place at the Mi&#x27;kmaq - Maliseet Institute at the University of New Brunswick, in collaboration with the native speakers. David Francis Sr., a Passamaquoddy elder living in Sipayik, Maine, has been an important resource for the program. The institute has the goal of helping Native American students master their native languages. The linguist Philip LeSourd has done extensive research on the language.

The Houlton Band of Maliseet was invited to take a nonvoting seat in the Maine Legislature, starting with the 126th Legislature in 2013. Henry John Bear, a treaty rights educator, tribal lawyer, fisherman and forester, was elected by his people to this seat.

There have been centuries of intermarriage between the Wolastoqiyik and European colonists and settlers. Surnames associated with Wolastoqey ancestry include: Denis, Sabattis, Gabriel, Saulis, Atwin, Launière, Athanase, Nicholas, Brière, Bear, Ginnish, Jenniss, Solis, Vaillancourt, Wallace, Paul, Polchies, Tomah, Sappier, Perley, Aubin, Francis, Sacobie, Nash, Meuse. Also included are DeVoe, DesVaux, DeVou, DeVost, DeVot, DeVeau.

The Wolastoqiyik own the Kataskomiq reserve.

==Notable Wolastoqiyik==
*Gabriel Acquin was the founder of the Reserve created in 1867, which is now part of St. Mary&#x27;s First Nation.
*Sarah Anala, social worker, awardee of the Order of Canada and the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal
*Noel Bear, active during the &quot;Aroostook War&quot; of (1838–39)
*Noël Bernard, Wolastoqew leader; fl. 1781–1801
*Jeremy Dutcher, musician, winner of the 2018 Polaris Music Prize for his album &quot;Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa&quot;
*Shayne Michael, poet
*Graydon Nicholas was the Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick, Canada, from 2009 to 2014. In this Viceregal position he acted as the Queen&#x27;s representative in the province.
*Sandra Lovelace Nicholas, a Wolastoqew activist, is known for challenging discriminatory provisions of the &quot;Indian Act&quot; in Canada, which deprived Aboriginal or Indigenous women of their status when they married non-Aboriginals. It imposed a patriarchal idea of descent and identity on peoples who traditionally had matrilineal kinship systems, whereby children belonged to the mother&#x27;s people and took their social status from her family. Nicholas was instrumental in bringing the case before the United Nations Human Rights Commission and lobbying for the 1985 legislation which reinstated some rights of First Nation women and their children in Canada via Bill C31 (1985). Retaining Aboriginal status for future generations is still an issue for the Wolastoqiyik and all Aboriginal groups. Nicholas was appointed to the Senate of Canada on September 21, 2005
*Peter Lewis Paul was a Wolastoqew oral historian (1902–1989) who lived on the Woodstock Reserve (N.B.) on the Saint John River. He shared information with numerous academic linguists, ethnohistorians, and anthropologists. The recipient of many honours, he was awarded a Centennial Medal in 1969, received an honorary Doctor of Law degree from the University of New Brunswick, and the Order of Canada in 1987.
*David Slagger represented the Wolastoqey people to the Maine House of Representatives

<text>Gaucher&#x27;s disease or Gaucher disease () (GD) is a genetic disorder in which glucocerebroside (a sphingolipid, also known as glucosylceramide) accumulates in cells and certain organs. The disorder is characterized by bruising, fatigue, anemia, low blood platelet count and enlargement of the liver and spleen, and is caused by a hereditary deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (also known as glucosylceramidase), which acts on glucocerebroside. When the enzyme is defective, glucocerebroside accumulates, particularly in white blood cells and especially in macrophages (mononuclear leukocytes, which is often a target for intracellular parasites). Glucocerebroside can collect in the spleen, liver, kidneys, lungs, brain, and bone marrow.

Manifestations may include enlarged spleen and liver, liver malfunction, skeletal disorders or bone lesions that may be painful, severe neurological complications, swelling of lymph nodes and (occasionally) adjacent joints, distended abdomen, a brownish tint to the skin, anemia, low blood platelet count, and yellow fatty deposits on the white of the eye (sclera). Persons seriously affected may also be more susceptible to infection. Some forms of Gaucher&#x27;s disease may be treated with enzyme replacement therapy.

The disease is caused by a recessive mutation in the &quot;GBA&quot; gene located on chromosome 1 and affects both males and females. About one in 100 people in the United States are carriers of the most common type of Gaucher disease. The carrier rate among Ashkenazi Jews is 8.9% while the birth incidence is 1 in 450.

Gaucher&#x27;s disease is the most common of the lysosomal storage diseases. It is a form of sphingolipidosis (a subgroup of lysosomal storage diseases), as it involves dysfunctional metabolism of sphingolipids.

The disease is named after the French physician Philippe Gaucher, who originally described it in 1882.

==Signs and symptoms==
* Painless hepatomegaly and splenomegaly: the size of the spleen can be , as opposed to the normal size of . Splenomegaly may decrease the affected individual&#x27;s capacity for eating by exerting pressure on the stomach. While painless, enlargement of the spleen increases the risk of splenic rupture.
* Hypersplenism and pancytopenia, the rapid and premature destruction of blood cells, leads to anemia, neutropenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia (with an increased risk of infection and bleeding).
* Cirrhosis of the liver is rare.
* Severe pain associated with joints and bones occurs, frequently presenting in hips and knees.
* Neurological symptoms occur only in some types of Gaucher&#x27;s (see below):
* Type I: impaired olfaction and cognition
* Type II: serious convulsions, hypertonia, intellectual disability, and apnea
* Type III: muscle twitches known as myoclonus, convulsions, dementia, and ocular muscle apraxia
* Parkinson&#x27;s disease is recognized as being more common in Gaucher&#x27;s disease patients and their heterozygous carrier relatives.
* Osteoporosis: 75% of patients develop visible bony abnormalities due to the accumulated glucosylceramide. A deformity of the distal femur in the shape of an Erlenmeyer flask is commonly described.
* Yellowish-brown skin pigmentation

==Genetics==
The three types of Gaucher&#x27;s disease are autosomal recessive. Both parents must be carriers for a child to be affected. If both parents are carriers, the chance of the disease is one in four, or 25%, with each pregnancy for an affected child.

Each type has been linked to particular mutations. In all, about 80 known &quot;GBA&quot; gene mutations are grouped into three main types:
* Type I (N370S homozygote), the most common, also called the &quot;non-neuropathic&quot; type occurs mainly in Ashkenazi Jews, at 100 times the occurrence in the general populace. The median age at diagnosis is 28 years of age, and life expectancy is mildly decreased.
* Type II (one or two alleles L444P) is characterized by neurological problems in small children. The enzyme is hardly released into the lysosomes. The prognosis is poor: most die before the age of three.
* Type III (also one or two copies of L444P, possibly delayed by protective polymorphisms) occurs in Swedish patients from the Norrbotten region. This group develops the disease somewhat later, but most die before their 30th birthday.

The Gaucher-causing mutations may have entered the Ashkenazi Jewish gene pool in the early Middle Ages (48–55 generations ago).

==Pathophysiology==

The disease is caused by a defect in the housekeeping gene for lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (also known as beta-glucosidase, , ) on the first chromosome (1q22). The enzyme is a 55.6-kilodalton, 497-amino acid-long protein that catalyses the breakdown of glucocerebroside, a cell membrane constituent of red and white blood cells. In Gaucher disease, the enzyme is unable to function correctly and glucocerebroside accumulates. The macrophages that clear these cells are unable to eliminate the waste product, which accumulates in fibrils and turn into &#x27;Gaucher cells&#x27;, which appear on light microscopy to resemble crumpled-up paper.

The exact mechanism of neurotoxicity is not understood, but it is thought to involve a reaction to glucosylsphingosine.

Different mutations in the GBA (beta-glucosidase) gene determine the remaining activity of the enzyme. In type I, there is some residual activity of the enzyme, accounting for the lack of neuropathology in this type. Although there is some correlation between genotype and phenotype, neither the amount of stored lipids nor the residual enzyme activity correlates well with disease symptoms. This circumstance has called for alternative explanations accounting for disease symptoms including
* jamming of the endo/lysosomal system
* ER stress
* altered lipid composition of membranes throughout the cell, including the plasma membrane, and consequent changes in the dynamic and signaling properties of the cell membrane
* inflammation caused by cytokine secretion as a result of sphingolipid accumulation, and neurodegeneration caused by the accumulation of glucosylsphingosine, a neurotoxin
Heterozygotes for particular acid beta-glucosidase mutations carry about a five-fold risk of developing Parkinson&#x27;s disease, making this the most common known genetic risk factor for Parkinson&#x27;s.

Cancer risk may be increased, particularly myeloma. This is thought to be due to accumulation of glucosylceramide and complex glycosphingolipids.

The role of inflammatory processes in Gaucher disease is poorly elucidated. However, sphingolipids are known to participate in inflammation and apoptosis, and markers of macrophage activation are elevated in people with Gaucher disease. These markers include angiotensin-converting enzyme, cathepsin S, chitotriosidase, and CCL18 in the blood plasma; and tumor necrosis factor alpha in splenic Gaucher cells (engorged macrophages).

==Diagnosis==

Gaucher disease is suggested based on the overall clinical picture. Initial laboratory testing may include enzyme testing. As a result, lower than 15% of mean normal activity is considered to be diagnostic. Decreased enzyme levels will often be confirmed by genetic testing. Numerous different mutations occur; sequencing of the beta-glucosidase gene is sometimes necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Prenatal diagnosis is available and is useful when a known genetic risk factor is present.

A diagnosis can also be implied by biochemical abnormalities such as high alkaline phosphatase, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and immunoglobulin levels, or by cell analysis showing &quot;crinkled paper&quot; cytoplasm and glycolipid-laden macrophages.

Some lysosomal enzymes are elevated, including tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, hexosaminidase, and a human chitinase, chitotriosidase. This latter enzyme has proved to be very useful for monitoring Gaucher&#x27;s disease activity in response to treatment and may reflect the severity of the disease

===Classification===
Gaucher&#x27;s disease (GD) has three common clinical subtypes. These subtypes have come under some criticism for not taking account of the full spectrum of observable symptoms (the phenotypes). Also, compound heterozygous variations occur which considerably increase the complexity of predicting disease course.

GD type I (non-neuropathic) is the most common and least severe form of the disease. Symptoms may begin early in life or adulthood and mainly affect the liver, spleen, and bone. Enlarged liver and grossly enlarged spleen (together hepatosplenomegaly) are common; the spleen can rupture and cause additional complications. Skeletal weakness and bone disease may be extensive. Spleen enlargement and bone marrow replacement cause anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. The brain and nervous system are not affected pathologically, but lung and, rarely, kidney impairment may occur. Patients in this group usually bruise easily (due to low levels of platelets) and experience fatigue due to low numbers of red blood cells. Depending on disease onset and severity, type I patients may live well into adulthood. The range and severity of symptoms can vary dramatically between patients.

GD type II (acute infantile neuropathic) typically begins within six months of birth and has an incidence rate of around 1 in 100,000 live births. Symptoms include an enlarged liver and spleen, extensive and progressive brain damage, eye movement disorders, spasticity, seizures, limb rigidity, and a poor ability to suck and swallow. Affected children usually die by age two.

GD type III (chronic neuropathic) can begin at any time in childhood or even in adulthood and occurs in about 1 in 100,000 live births. It is characterized by slowly progressive, but milder neurologic symptoms compared to the acute or type II version. Major symptoms include an enlarged spleen and/or liver, seizures, poor coordination, skeletal irregularities, eye movement disorders, blood disorders including anemia, and respiratory problems. Patients often live into their early teen years and adulthood.

==Treatment==
For those with type-I and most type-III, enzyme replacement treatment with intravenous recombinant glucocerebrosidase can decrease liver and spleen size, reduce skeletal abnormalities, and reverse other manifestations. This treatment costs about US$200,000 annually for a single person and should be continued for life. The rarity of the disease means dose-finding studies have been difficult to conduct, so controversy remains over the optimal dose and dosing frequency. Due to the low incidence, this has become an orphan drug in many countries, meaning a government recognizes and accommodates the financial constraints that limit research into drugs that address a small population.

The first drug for Gaucher&#x27;s was alglucerase (Ceredase), which was a version of glucocerebrosidase that was harvested from human placental tissue and then modified with enzymes. It was approved by the FDA in 1991 and has been withdrawn from the market due to the approval of similar drugs made with recombinant DNA technology instead of being harvested from tissue; drugs made recombinantly are preferable since there is no concern about diseases being transmitted from the tissue used in harvesting, there are fewer risks of variations in enzyme structure from batch to batch, and they are less expensive to manufacture.

Available recombinant glucocerebrosidases are:
* Imiglucerase (approved in 1995)
* Velaglucerase (approved in 2010)
* Taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso) (approved in 2012)

Miglustat is a small molecule, oral medication that was first approved for Gaucher&#x27;s disease in Europe in 2002. It works by preventing the formation of glucocerebroside, the substance that builds up and causes harm in Gaucher&#x27;s. This approach is called substrate reduction therapy.

Eliglustat (Cerdelga) (approved in 2014) is also a small molecule. The compound is believed to work by inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase.

==Epidemiology==
The National Gaucher Foundation (United States) states the incidence of Gaucher&#x27;s disease is about one in 20,000 live births. Around one in 100 people in the general US population is a carrier for type I Gaucher&#x27;s disease, giving a prevalence of one in 40,000. Among Ashkenazi Jews, the rate of carriers is considerably higher, at roughly one in 15.

Type II Gaucher&#x27;s disease shows no particular preference for any ethnic group.

Type III Gaucher&#x27;s disease is especially common in the population of the northern Swedish region of Norrbotten, where the incidence of the disease is one in 50,000.

==History==
The disease was first recognized by the French doctor Philippe Gaucher, who originally described it in 1882 and lent his name to the condition. In 1902, its mode of inheritance was discovered by Nathan Brill. The neuronal damage associated with the disease was discovered in the 1920s, and the biochemical basis for the disease was elucidated in the 1960s by Roscoe Brady. The first effective treatment for the disease, the drug alglucerase (Ceredase), was approved by the FDA in April 1991. An improved drug, imiglucerase (Cerezyme), was approved by the FDA in May 1994 and has replaced the use of Ceredase.

October is National Gaucher&#x27;s Disease Awareness Month in the United States.

<text>John Russell (29 March 1745 – 20 April 1806) was an English painter renowned for his portrait work in oils and pastels, and as a writer and teacher of painting techniques.

==Life and work==
Russell was born in Guildford, Surrey, the son of John Russell Snr., book and print seller and four times mayor of the town; his father was something of an artist, and drew and published two views of Guildford. Russell was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, and soon showed a strong inclination for art. He trained under Francis Cotes RA (of Cavendish Square, London), one of the pioneers of English pastel painting, and, like Cotes, was an admirer of the pastel drawings of Rosalba Carriera whose methods influenced his technique of &quot;sweetening&quot;. At the age of 19 he converted to Methodism, which was the cause of tension with his family and with his teacher; he made no secret of his strong evangelical leanings and would attempt to preach and convert at every opportunity.

Russell set up his own studio, in London, in 1767. He made the acquaintance of the notorious Dr. William Dodd, whose portrait he painted in 1768. He was introduced to Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, who unsuccessfully attempted to persuade him to give up painting and attend her Methodist ministers&#x27; training college at Trevecca in Wales. On 5 February 1770, he married Hannah Faden, daughter of a Charing Cross print and map seller, whom he had converted. They lived at No. 7 Mortimer Street, Cavendish Square, where he had moved in 1770.

Russell&#x27;s work caused him to travel extensively around Britain. In 1772, he wrote &quot;Elements of Painting with Crayons&quot;, by which time he had won premiums for his drawings from the Society of Arts in 1759 and 1760, and entered the Royal Academy school of art in 1770, winning its gold medal for figure drawing the same year. He exhibited at the Society of Artists of Great Britain in 1768 and showed 330 works at the Academy between 1769 until and his death.
In 1770, Russell painted Methodist minister, George Whitefield (engraved by James Watson) and the future philanthropist, William Wilberforce, then only eleven years old. In 1771, he exhibited a portrait in oils of Charles Wesley at the Royal Academy and, in 1772, painted Selina, Countess of Huntingdon in pastel. This was a symbolic picture, and was lost on its voyage out; but it was engraved, and he later also painted her in oils. Also in that year he was elected an associate of the Royal Academy. The following year, 1773, he painted John Wesley (engraved by Bland).

In 1788, after a long wait, Russell was elected a royal academician, in the same year painting a portrait of the naturalist Sir Joseph Banks. In 1789, he was commissioned to portray the royal physician Francis Willis. The results obviously pleased the monarch as, in 1790, he was appointed Crayon (pastel) Painter to King George III, Queen Charlotte, the Prince of Wales (both of whom Russell also painted) and the Duke of York. With such royal patronage, he developed a large and fashionable clientele.

Russell was a man of deep religious beliefs, a devout follower of George Whitefield. He began an elaborate introspective diary in John Byrom&#x27;s shorthand in 1766 and continued it to the time of his death. In it, he recorded his own mental condition and religious exercises, and occasionally information concerning his sitters. Though his religion appears to have become less militant after his marriage, his diary bears witness to his anxiety with regard to his spiritual welfare. Not only would he not work on Sunday, but he would allow no one to enter his painting-room. He was afraid to go out to dinner on account of the loose and blasphemous conversation which he might hear. He was on good terms with Sir Joshua Reynolds, with whom he dined at the academy, the Dilettanti Society, and the Literary Club (now The Club), but he records that on these or other festive occasions he always left early.

He was troubled by ill-health for much of his life, and in 1803 became almost deaf following a bout of cholera. He died in Hull in 1806 after contracting typhus.

Russell&#x27;s work can be viewed at many galleries in the UK and around the world, but the largest collection is held by Guildford House Art Gallery in Guildford. Many of his portraits were engraved by, amongst others, Joseph Collyer, Charles Turner, James Heath, Dean, Bartolozzi and Trotter.

==Astronomy==
Russell was interested in astronomy and made, with the assistance of his daughter, a lunar map, which he engraved on two plates which formed a globe showing the visible surface of the Moon – it took twenty years to finish. He also invented an apparatus for exhibiting the phenomena of the Moon, which he called &quot;Selenographia&quot;. Russell&#x27;s large and highly detailed pastel drawing of &quot;The Face of the Moon&quot; (1793–1797) is &quot;the most faithful early representation of the lunar sphere&quot;. Some of his best portraits were of the era&#x27;s acclaimed scientists, such as his friend William Herschel, who he depicted holding a stellar chart showing his discovery of Uranus. It was Herschel who provided the powerful telescope that Russell used for his painstaking lunar observations.

==Family==
Of his twelve children (of which four died in infancy), William Russell (1780–1870), exhibited portraits at the Royal Academy from 1805 to 1809. The National Portrait Gallery contains a portrait of Judge Sir John Bayley by him. He was ordained in 1809, and gave up painting. He was forty years rector of Shepperton, Middlesex, and died on 14 September 1870. Two of John&#x27;s daughters, Anne
and Jane, became artists as well.

<text>Tenentism () was a political philosophy of junior army officers (, , &quot;lieutenants&quot;) who significantly contributed to the Brazilian Revolution of 1930 that ended the First Brazilian Republic.

==Background==

The first decades of the 20th century saw marked economic and social change in Brazil. With industrialization on the rise, the federal government — dominated by the coffee oligarchs and the old order of &quot;café com leite&quot; politics and &quot;coronelismo&quot; — came under threat from the political aspirations of new urban groups: the proletariat, government and white-collar workers, merchants, bankers, and industrialists. In parallel, growing prosperity encouraged a rapid rise of a new working class of Southern and Eastern European immigrants who contributed to the growth of trade unionism, anarchism, and socialism in Brazil. In the post-World War I period, Brazil saw its first wave of general strikes and the establishment of the Communist Party in 1922.

A new class of junior army officers () had emerged. They were trained in European war standards and believed themselves superior to their senior officers who still held antiquated ideas of the past. In addition, various senior officers had become complacent or sided with the government and its political structure, which sparked criticism from the &quot;tenentes&quot;.

Meanwhile, the divergence of interests between the coffee oligarchs and the burgeoning, dynamic urban sectors was intensifying. According to historian Benjamin Keen, the task of transforming society &quot;fell to the rapidly growing urban bourgeois groups, and especially to the middle class, which began to voice even more strongly its discontent with the rule of the corrupt rural oligarchies&quot;. In contrast, despite a wave of general strikes in the post-war years, the labour movement remained small and weak, lacking ties to the peasantry, who constituted the overwhelming majority of the Brazilian population. As a result, rather disparate and disjointed social reform movements cropped up in the 1920s.

==July 1922: the first revolt==

What became known as the &quot;tenentist&quot; movement came to public notice on 5 July 1922 when a group of young army officers began a rebellion against the First Brazilian Republic at Fort Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro. Sparked initially by the punishment and brief imprisonment of marshal Hermes da Fonseca by president Epitácio Pessoa, the &quot;tenentes&quot; attempted to prevent Artur Bernardes, winner of the 1922 presidential election, from taking office. The &quot;tenentes&quot; demanded various forms of social modernization, calling for agrarian reform, the formation of cooperatives, and the nationalization of mines. Their early-morning rebellion was taken up by a garrison in São Paulo but not by others; only &quot;scattered units around Rio de Janeiro revolted: the Escola Militar, some elements of the First Infantry Regiment and the Battalion of Engineers, and the garrisons of Forts Copacabana and Vigia. However, the remainder of the First Army Division stayed loyal and, with General Setembrino de Carvalho supervising the operations, easily crushed the revolt&quot;. Twenty-four hours later, just 200 rebels remained when the navy dreadnought &quot;Minas Geraes&quot; shelled the Copacabana barracks, after which two navy aircraft bombed the barracks in the first use of naval aircraft in combat in Latin America. The defenders were driven from their positions. A group known subsequently as the 18 of the Copacabana Fort revolt were led down Avenida Atlântica by Antônio de Siqueira Campos and Eduardo Gomes to confront the army loyalists; the eighteen made a last stand on the beach, where sixteen were killed and two, Gomes and Campos, survived. In the aftermath, the government imposed a state of emergency, 1,000 cadets were expelled from the army school and many officers were sent to remote garrisons.

==São Paulo Revolt of 1924==
The São Paulo Revolt of 1924 was the second tenentist revolt and the largest conflict in the city of São Paulo. It began in the early hours of July 5 and ended on 28 July 1924. The revolt was motivated by the discontent of the military with the economic crisis and the concentration of power at the hands of politicians from São Paulo and Minas Gerais. Commanded by retired General Isidoro Dias Lopes, with the participation of several lieutenants, the main objective of the uprising was to depose President Artur Bernardes (considered to be an enemy of the military since the crisis of the fake letters). Among the demands was the adoption of the secret ballot, free justice and the introduction of compulsory public education.

Raised in the capital of São Paulo on 5 July 1924 (the 2nd anniversary of the 18 Revolt of the Copacabana Fortress, the first tenentist revolt), the revolt occupied the city for 23 days, forcing the president of the state, Carlos de Campos, to flee to the neighborhood of Penha, in the east zone of São Paulo, on July 9, after the Campos Elíseos Palace, seat of the São Paulo government at that time, was bombarded. Carlos de Campos was installed in an adapted train car at the Guaiaúna station in Central Brazil, where the federal troops that came from Mogi das Cruzes were located. Rebellions broke out in several cities in the interior of the state of São Paulo, with many prefectures being taken over by the rebels.

The city of São Paulo was bombarded by Federal Government aircraft and artillery. The loyalist Army (loyal to President Artur Bernardes) used the so-called &quot;terrifying bombardment&quot;, reaching various parts of the city, especially working-class neighborhoods such as Mooca and Brás, and the middle class, such as Perdizes. Without equivalent military equipment (artillery or aircraft) to confront government troops, the rebels retired to Bauru in the early hours of July 28, where Isidoro Dias Lopes heard news that the legalist army was concentrated in the city of Três Lagoas, Mato Grosso do Sul. At 10 o&#x27;clock on the morning of July 28, Carlos de Campos returned to his office in the Government Palace. Isidoro Dias Lopes and Juarez Távora then planned an attack on that city. The defeat at Três Lagoas, however, was the greatest defeat of this revolt. A third of the revolting troops died, were seriously injured or captured. Overthrown, the rioters then marched south, where, in the city of Foz do Iguaçu, in Paraná, they joined Gaucho officers led by Luís Carlos Prestes, in what became the greatest guerrilla feat in Brazil until then: the Prestes Column. The final balance indicates the death of 1,000 people, 4,000 injured and an estimated 300,000 temporarily driven into the outskirts of the city.
==July 1924 – February 1927: the second revolt and the long march of the Prestes Column==

Two years later, on 5 July 1924, another group of army officers mounted a rebellion in São Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul. The date was chosen to honour the 1922 rebels; the uprising &quot;was better prepared and was intended to bring down the Bernardes government&quot;. The formal leader was retired General Isidoro Dias Lopes, with others including Eduardo Gomes, Newton Estillac Leal, João Cabanas and Miguel Costa. The rebellion began well, with control of São Paulo being secured after the governor and forces loyal to him abandoned the city early on 9 July. The rebels in the city were put under siege by government forces, and prevented from linking up with other uprisings which were breaking out in places such as Bela Vista, Mato Grosso, Aracaju, Sergipe and Manaus. The city was then subjected to a several-week artillery and aerial bombardment, of which civilians bore the brunt. On 26 July, army aircraft dropped leaflets over the city warning the remaining civilians to leave so that loyalist forces would have a free hand against the rebels. 

Isidoro&#x27;s various attempts at securing an agreement with the government that would at least give the rebels amnesty were rebuffed. The leaders understood that they would be wiped out, along with a good part of the city, if they stayed. On the night of 27 July they staged a careful withdrawal of 3,000 troops on thirteen trains, via the Northwest Railroad, toward Mato Grosso, where they hoped to link up with sympathetic units. This withdrawal was executed so smoothly that it went unnoticed by the government forces until the morning. However, with their route to Mato Grosso blocked, the rebels retired to an area bordering Argentina and Paraguay close to Foz do Iguaçu.

Having escaped to the interior and joined by others from Rio Grande do Sul, they began a campaign as a guerrilla force led by Luís Carlos Prestes and Miguel Costa. They became known as the Prestes Column, and covered some 25,000 kilometres from October 1924 to February 1927 as they roamed through the interior of the country seeking unsuccessfully to promote mass rebellion or at any rate to act as a moral gadfly to the nation&#x27;s conscience. After losing significant numbers to desertion and sickness, escaping encirclement at Palmeira, Rio Grande do Sul, in January 1925, making a successful stand at the Iguazu Falls in February and after some initial disagreements about strategy, the rebels adopted one that amounted less to a war of movement than a moving &quot;armed protest demonstration&quot; that would serve as a constant call to action against the hated president Bernardes. The idea was not to defeat the forces sent against them, much less so the old objective of seizing power in Rio de Janeiro: the objective now was to stay alive, keep the column moving and seemingly invincible. In that, they succeeded as they moved through state after state from Mato Grosso to Maranhão and back, before seeking refuge in Bolivia in 1927&quot;.

Regarding the &quot;Long March&quot;, Prestes subsequently wrote that &quot;the tactics of swift marches, evasion as far as possible of contact with superior enemy forces and surprise attacks aimed at demoralizing the enemy and capturing arms and ammunition, demonstrated that in Brazilian conditions it was possible to stage a protracted struggle&quot;. However, years later he was critical of the futility of his own strategy, writing that &quot;I also defended the column&#x27;s march tactics, claiming that they presented opportunities for recruiting new fighters. This, however, was not the case. The farmers sympathised with us for the simple reason that we were against the oppressors, they admired our heroism and devotion, but had no intention (with rare exceptions of some young people) of committing themselves to a struggle in whose success they could not believe&quot;.

==Legacy==

The &quot;tenente&quot; revolts heralded the end of the &quot;café com leite&quot; politics and &quot;coronelismo&quot; and the beginning of social reforms. The actions and ideas that grew out of the revolts inspired other individuals, such as Getúlio Vargas, to lead the 1930 revolution against the Brazilian Government and bring down the First Brazilian Republic. The impact of the Prestes Column placed insurgents in contact with the rural peasantry of Brazil and the surrounding countryside; a contact that made the soldiers aware, for the first time, of the wretched conditions of their own countrymen. &quot;The &quot;tenentes&quot; became the most visible proponents for revolution and helped convince Vargas that the use of force would be necessary&quot;. Subsequently, with the help of the &quot;tenentes&quot;, whom he restored to the army, often with significant promotions, Vargas &quot;forged a highly personalised dictatorship&quot;. Prestes, however, &quot;proclaimed his opposition to the 1930 coup and formally applied for membership of the Communist Party&quot;.

<text>Prime7, formerly Prime Television and other names, was an Australian television network. Prime Television launched on 17 March 1962 as &quot;CBN-8&quot; in Orange, and later expanded to cover regional New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. It was initially an independent affiliate owned by Prime Media Group before the network, and its sister GWN7, were acquired by Seven West Media on 31 December 2021.

Prime7 along with GWN7 national broadcast facilities were based in Canberra, with playout facilities (since 2021) shared with hybrid-funded broadcaster SBS Television at a facility operated by Australian telecommunications provider Telstra. Seven West Media head office/administration is located in Pyrmont, Sydney.

==History==
===Origins===
Prime Television originally began as a group of separate stations and networks – Midstate Television in Orange, Dubbo and Griffith; RVN/AMV in Wagga Wagga and Albury; and 9-8 Television in Tamworth and Taree.

CBN-8 Orange first aired on 17 March 1962, followed by CWN-6 Dubbo on 1 December 1965, and MTN-9 Griffith began on 15 December 1965. CBN and CWN were both licensed to Country Television Services (also the owner of radio station 2GZ in Orange). CWN was a full-time relay of CBN—the first Australian television station to relay another. The two stations thus formed the country&#x27;s first regional television network.

RVN-2 Wagga Wagga began broadcasting on 19 June 1964, while AMV-4 Albury launched on 7 September 1964. The two stations merged in 1971 as the Riverina and North East Victoria Television Service Pty Ltd with the callsign RVN/AMV on air.

In northern New South Wales, NEN-9 Tamworth began transmission on 27 September 1965, with a relay in Armidale (NEN-1, later NEN-10) on 15 July 1966. ECN-8 Taree started on 27 May 1966. At one stage, ECN-8 merged with NRN-11 Coffs Harbour (now owned by WIN Corporation), however the two stations eventually split. NEN later merged with ECN as 9-8 Television.

===Television 6-8-9===
As a result of the financial difficulties that many independent stations faced, MTN-9 joined CWN-6 and CBN-8 to form Television 6-8-9 in 1973. Relays were launched in Portland, Lithgow, Mudgee, Cobar, Kandos and Rylstone and Bathurst. In 1981, 6-8-9 changed its name to Midstate Television.

Colour television was introduced at the same time as the rest of the country, on 1 March 1975 – one of the single most expensive processes undertaken by CBN to date. The station was a prominent broadcaster of local sporting events including tennis and rugby. In 1979, a documentary titled &quot;Goin&#x27; Down The Road&quot;, about the 1978 National Rodeo Titles won the network a Logie award for an &#x27;Outstanding Contribution by a Regional Station&#x27;.

Midstate produced a number of local programs, including the &quot;Weekend Report&quot;, &quot;Early Shift&quot;, &quot;Rural Roundup&quot; and &quot;Around the Schools&quot;. From 1968, CBN was able to access a Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department microwave link for national news bulletins and major events.

===Aggregation===

Midstate Television was bought out by media magnate Paul Ramsay&#x27;s Ramcorp in October 1987. It was soon merged with Ramcorp&#x27;s other stations, RVN/AMV and NEN/ECN. In 1988, Midstate Television was renamed Prime Television and began to show increased Seven Network programming in readiness for aggregation.

When aggregation took place, Prime began broadcasting to both southern New South Wales and northern Victoria. Transmission problems meant that aggregation in southern New South Wales took place in two stages – first the Australian Capital Territory and NSW south coast on 31 March 1989, followed by Orange, Dubbo, and Wagga Wagga on 31 December 1989. These changes led to the de-merger of RVN-AMV, with RVN becoming CBN-2.

Griffith remained a one-station market, however instead of taking programming from Prime in line with the network&#x27;s other stations, MTN-9 relayed programming mainly from WIN Television in southern New South Wales. A supplementary licence, AMN-31, was successfully bid for by MTN in 1996, providing a relay of Prime Television. Soon after the station was purchased by WIN Television, which undertook a number of minor changes – mainly changing the news service to WIN News, and using entirely WIN branding. AMN-31 remains a relay of Prime. Similarly, the Mildura licence area remained separate from the remainder of Victoria, albeit with a single station, STV-8, later bought out by WIN Television in 1996. In 1997 Prime was successful in bidding for a new licence for the area at a cost of $3.2 million. PTV-31 began broadcasting the following year.

Although advertising revenue increased post-aggregation, local programming declined as a result of the costs incurred by the network&#x27;s expansion – an estimated $45 million had been spent by Ramcorp during and in the lead-up to aggregation. After losses of $50 million, it was not until 1993 that the renamed Prime Television posted a profit.

In November 1996, Prime&#x27;s parent company, Prime Television, purchased the Golden West Network, a merged group of four stations in regional Western Australia; BTW-3 Bunbury, VEW-8 Kalgoorlie, GTW-11 Geraldton and GSW-9 Albany. Western Australia, similar to Griffith and Mildura, remained a one-station commercial market until 1999 when GWN became a Seven Network affiliate, after WIN Television began transmission as an affiliate of both the Nine Network and Network Ten.

The network began to expand into New Zealand in 1997, when a number of licences were purchased from United Christian Broadcasters for an estimated $3.6 million. Prime Television New Zealand began broadcasting on 30 August 1998, with a nightly local news program in both Waikato and Christchurch. Prime also expanded into Argentina with the purchase of the Canal 9 network.

===2000s===

The renamed Argentine network Azul Televisión was sold for $108 million in early 2000 due to lower-than-expected performance. During the same year, Prime benefited greatly from its affiliation with the Seven Network throughout its carriage of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. The network&#x27;s relationship with Seven was further developed throughout the early 2000s, leading to the introduction of &quot;7onPrime&quot; promotional branding for Seven Network-produced programs on 11 February 2001.

Local news bulletins for Newcastle, the Gold Coast, Canberra, and Wollongong were axed on 9 June 2001 due to falling ratings and the anticipated costs of the switch to digital television. This, and the closure of a number of news bulletins by Southern Cross Broadcasting, prompted the Australian Broadcasting Authority to investigate the adequacy of regional news services The ABA later mandated that stations broadcast a minimum level of local content, based on a points systemtwo points per minute for local news, and one point per minute for other local content, excluding paid advertisements.

Prime formed a partnership with the Nine Network (affiliated in Australia to competitor WIN Television), giving its owner, PBL Media the option to purchase a 50% share of Prime Television New Zealand in return for access to original programming, and cross-promotion in PBL&#x27;s New Zealand magazine titles. Following this, Prime Television New Zealand began to take on branding and programming similar to that of the Nine Network. In November 2005, Prime Television New Zealand was purchased by subscription television provider Sky Network Television for , completed after approval by New Zealand&#x27;s Commerce Commission in February 2006.

Mildura Digital Television, a digital-only station in Mildura began transmissions in 2006 as a joint venture between Prime Television and WIN Corporation. Section 38B of the &quot;Broadcasting Services Act&quot; allowed for the provision of a third station owned by either one or both existing networks. MDT is a direct relay of 10 Melbourne, albeit with local advertising.

Prime Television announced on 21 December 2009 that it would start broadcasting 7two on 23 December 2009.

===2010s===
On 25 September 2010, Prime began transmission of the new HD digital channel 7mate aimed at men 16–49. The first program to be broadcast was the drawn 2010 AFL Grand Final. On 15 January 2011, Prime Media Group reported that Prime and GWN were set to rebrand as Prime7 and GWN7 respectively. Their news bulletins had quickly changed their names to Prime7 News and GWN7 News, while 7two dropped the &quot;Prime&quot; logo on the multichannels. Prime and GWN relaunched on 16 January 2011 at 18:00 (6pm). Prime7 began broadcasting 4ME (then Television 4) on 18 September 2011 on LCN 64. Prime7 began broadcasting ishop TV on 30 April 2013 on LCN 65.

Prime7 ceased to broadcast 4ME on 30 April 2016, due to financial problems.

In December 2016, Prime7 transferred its playout facilities to MediaHub Australia located within the Sydney suburb of Ingleburn. The facility is a joint venture between public broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corporation and rival regional network WIN Television. Network officials noted that its existing Canberra facilities cannot be upgraded with technological advancements, causing Prime7 to be incapable of relaunching its HD simulcast as well as introducing 7flix to its viewers.

On 3 August 2017, 18 months after launching in metropolitan areas, Prime7 announced that it would carry 7flix to its regional stations in northern and southern New South Wales, regional Victoria and Mildura from 3 September 2017. The channel became available on digital channel 66 in MPEG-4 format. On 15 January 2018, Prime7 quietly relaunched its primary HD service, Prime7 HD, on digital channel 60 in MPEG-4 format.

===2021: Merger with Seven===
On 1 November 2021, Seven West Media announced that it would acquire all the shares and subsidiaries of Prime Media Group, including Prime7. This was Seven West Media&#x27;s second attempt at purchasing Prime, after its previous attempt in 2019 was thwarted by Australian Community Media boss Antony Catalano and rival WIN Corporation owner Bruce Gordon, who cited Seven&#x27;s debt problems at the time and its poor ratings performance as their reason for their refusal. This development would mark an end to the Prime branding after 33 years in favour of the Seven Network&#x27;s branding, and would see all news bulletins carry the &quot;Seven News&quot; brand. Prior to this, Prime7 (and sister GWN7 in regional and remote Western Australia), as well as Nine affiliate Imparja Television were the only networks not to fully use its metro affiliate branding despite carrying Seven (Nine for Imparja) branded promos, since WIN Television (except for WIN News) and Southern Cross Austereo use full Nine, Ten and Seven branding on their stations. It was also announced that Seven would look to expand its investment in local news following the merger. The majority of Prime&#x27;s shareholders voted in favour of the deal on 23 December, with the sale completed on 31 December.

On 23 May 2022, Seven West Media announced that the current branding of Prime7 and GWN7 would be unified into Seven Network branding across all stations including for Prime7 Local News, officially retiring the Prime7 name.

In June 2022 the Prime7 brand was retired.

On 22 July 2022 the final retirement of the Prime7 branding took place with all local news bulletins becoming &quot;7NEWS (region)&quot; for example &quot;7NEWS Border&quot; as of Monday 25 July.

==Programming==
Prime&#x27;s programming schedule was almost identical to those of Seven Network metropolitan counterparts ATN in Sydney and HSV in Melbourne, with some differences. Since the Prime network&#x27;s inception it featured a broad range of original local programming, which included children&#x27;s program &quot;Possum&#x27;s Club&quot; with Madelaine Collignon and station mascot &quot;Prime Possum&quot; as well as community service segment &quot;Prime7 InfoNet&quot;, a series of short updates listing local community events.

Prime7&#x27;s overnight schedule also differed from the Seven Network feed, containing infomercials from Danoz Direct, Home Shopping, and a feed from pay television channel Expo. Past programming from Prime Television has been recognised nationally, with some local productions winning the Logie Award for &#x27;Outstanding Contribution by a Regional Television Station&#x27;. The network has won Logies for &quot;Goin&#x27; Down The Road&quot; (CBN-8, 1979), &quot;Naturally&quot; (NEN-9/ECN-8, 1984), &quot;Stranded&quot; (Prime Television, 1993), &quot;Rest in Peace&quot; (Prime Television, 1994), and &quot;No Time For Frailty&quot; (Prime Television, 1996).

==Prime7 News==
&quot;Seven News Regional&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Prime7 News&quot; and &quot;Prime News&quot;) was the network&#x27;s local news service. Full bulletins were produced for the towns and surrounding regions originally covered by the stations &quot;Midstate 6,8,9 Television&quot;, Dubbo/Orange, &quot;RVN-2/AMV-4&quot;, Wagga Wagga/Albury and &quot;9/8 Television&quot; (NEN-9/ECN-8) Tamworth/Taree, prior to the aggregation of regional television services in New South Wales that occurred in the early 1990s. In other areas two-minute news updates were shown at various times of the day.

&quot;Prime7 News&quot; bulletins were presented from Canberra weeknightly as Prime7 Local News at 18:00 (6pm) in the Albury and Wodonga Border, North West, North Coast, Central West and Wagga Wagga broadcast areas. &quot;Prime7 News at 6:30 (with Daniel Gibson)&quot; (at 18:30) also came from the Canberra news centre.

==Availability==
Prime7 was available in standard definition digital format. Since June 2007 a 1080i high definition simulcast had also been available, replacing the network&#x27;s former 576p service. Prime7 was viewed mainly through free-to-air terrestrial transmitters, although subscription cable also provided by TransACT and Neighbourhood Cable in the Australian Capital Territory and Ballarat, respectively.

Prime7 broadcast to southern New South Wales through stations based in Orange and Dubbo, northern New South Wales from stations in Tamworth and Taree, Victoria from its Albury-Wodonga-based station AMV and Mildura via PTV.

===Prime7 HD===
Prime7 HD originally launched on 15 October 2007 as a sister to the Seven Network&#x27;s high definition simulcast, Seven HD. Then-known as &quot;Prime HD&quot;, it broadcast in 1080i high definition on digital channel 60 on Prime&#x27;s regional stations NEN Northern New South Wales, CBN Southern New South Wales, AMV Victoria and PTV Mildura. The channel broadcast breakaway programming from 10 December 2007 until 4 October 2009, when it was turned into a straight HD simulcast. Prime HD fully ceased broadcasting on 25 September 2010 with the launch of the HD channel 7mate. Prime7 re-launched their HD simulcast service, now known as &quot;Prime7 HD&quot; on 15 January 2018.

===PTV===
PTV was an Australian television station licensed to, and serving the regions surrounding Mildura, Victoria. The station commenced transmissions in 1997, after Prime Television won the second television licence for Mildura, a non-aggregated market, in competition with WIN Television, for a cost of $3.2 million, in October 1996.
Analogue transmission ceased on 30 June 2010 as part of the national conversion to digital television.

In the Mildura regional market, short two-minute updates are presented by rotating presenters with weather forecasts presented by Karl Lijnders, Daniel Gibson or Craig Moore. Some of the reports aired in these updates are drawn on the resources of Mildura-based WIN News operation.

==Logos==
Prime Television became a network in May 1988, with shared logos produced and used across the regional stations, featuring the word &quot;Prime Television&quot; either above an outlined triangle or rectangle. Aggregation occurred across the network on 31 March 1989, along with the introduction of a green logo featuring the word &quot;Prime&quot; with the letter &quot;i&quot; dotted with a stylised globe, introduced in December 1988. This logo was used on its own across the network until 1996, when a new circular logo was introduced in 1990. Following a decade in use, 2001 saw the launch of a new simplified yellow logo, with the removal of the circle. This logo was launched concurrently with a similarly design logo on the Golden West Network. Following the 2011 relaunch, a new red logo was introduced which incorporates the Seven Network logo. The relaunch logo featuring Seven Network was revised in 2012 from multi colour to be a single colour logo.

<text>The I-SPY books are spotters&#x27; guides written for British children, particularly successful in the 1950s and 1960s in their original form and again when relaunched by Michelin in 2009 after a seven-year gap in publishing. A search engine set to look for images, with the words - &quot;i-spy&quot; News Chronicle Daily Mail Michelin, can illustrate that a range of styles was used. 

==Concept==
The I-SPY books are a series of around forty small volumes that have sold hundreds of thousands of copies each, totalling sales of 25 million worldwide by 2010. Each book in the &quot;I-Spy&quot; series covers a different subject, such as &quot;I-SPY Cars&quot;, &quot;I-SPY on the Pavement&quot;, &quot;I-SPY Churches&quot;, &quot;I-SPY on a Train Journey&quot;, and so on. As children spot the objects listed, they record the event in the book and gain points, varying according to how unusual the sight. In the early years of the series, completed books could be sent to Charles Warrell, (known as Big Chief I-SPY) for a feather and order of merit. The children participating in the game were known as The I-SPY Tribe, and by 1953 the I-SPY Tribe had half a million members.

==History==
The company was supposedly run by a Red Indian chief called Big Chief I-Spy. The original Big Chief I-Spy was Charles Warrell, a former headmaster who created I-Spy towards the end of his working life. He retired in 1956, but lived until 1995 when he died at the age of 106. After Warrell&#x27;s retirement his assistant Arnold Cawthrow became the second Big Chief, and served in this role until 1978. For part of this time he also worked as an antiques dealer in Islington. He died in 1993, and is commemorated by a stone plaque placed on the outside of the Boatmen&#x27;s Rooms, the house where he spent some of his last years in Deal, Kent. 

The books were originally self-published in 1948 by Charles Warrell but, after a brief period when they were published by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, they were taken over by the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; newspaper and based in the paper&#x27;s building in Bouverie Street. The regular I-SPY column, which appeared in the &quot;News Chronicle&quot;, reverted to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; when the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; ceased publication in 1960, and continued to appear until the late 1980s. The books have had various publishers over the years including the Dickens Press, a company set up to continue the book publishing interests of the &quot;News Chronicle&quot;, and Polystyle Publications, a publisher of children&#x27;s comics.

The books became very popular, with print runs well into six figures. Big Chief I-Spy had a succession of assistants, usually known as &quot;Hawkeye&quot;. In the early 1970s, this position was held by Ralph Mills. Earlier assistants included Max Heinz and John Tagholm. In the 1980s, following a short-lived third Big Chief, Robin Tucek. David Bellamy replaced Big Chief I-Spy as the person to whom completed books were sent, and the earlier Red Indian connections were quietly dropped.

Michelin Travel Publications acquired and published the series from 1991 until 2002 when they effectively ceased publication. There were ad-hoc sales after that date to clear stocks.

The series was relaunched by Michelin in December 2009 with 12 new titles, followed by a further 12 in Spring 2010. &quot;The Bookseller&quot; announced the launch in October 2009 with an interview with Michelin Commercial Director Ian Murray. Murray confirmed that the initial 12 titles would include &quot;I Spy Birds&quot;, &quot;Cars&quot;, &quot;Trees&quot;, &quot;On a Car Journey&quot; and &quot;On a Train Journey&quot;. The new I-Spy titles are faithful to the original concept but are fully updated and include all new colour images. 

The relaunch of the books and subsequent multiple expansions of the title list suggested that their popularity is being enjoyed by a new generation of children.

==&quot;Daily Mail&quot; Series==

==&quot;National I-Spy Ranger Association&quot; Series==

American editions, published by TAB Books Inc, pricing was 15c

==&quot;News Chronicle&quot; Series==

I-Spy 6d Series

These followed the same basic format as the early spotter books, as well as keeping the concept of a Big Chief I-Spy, but were issued in a more standard portrait format 4&quot; by 5&quot; (13cm by 10cm). Pocket sized, with thinner covers, each I-Spy title had fifty pages or so of pen drawings and descriptive text. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; dropped their involvement after the previous series, and the new look books were launched in conjunction with &quot;News Chronicle&quot; around 1951. By 1952 the first six of the new titles were in print, with four more planned. The series was in print until 1966, with older titles refreshed every so often and updated.

The &quot;News Chronicle&quot; was taken over by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in 1960 and closed, but the I-SPY books were by now so popular that the &quot;Mail&quot; decided to re-associate themselves with the publication once more. The covers were redesigned to remove the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; name, but the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; logo was only seen inside the books. Around 1963 even this was removed and the titles were simply published by the Dickens Press (who printed the &quot;Mail&quot;). With all these changes, up to five distinct editions of some titles exist.

I-Spy Colour Series

A companion range of 1/- books, the I-Spy Colour Series was the same size and actually had the same number of pages as their 6d cousins, but used better, thicker quality paper and some inside pages in full colour. Launched probably in 1952 with the first two titles, the colour series issued two new titles each year for a while. The colour books were all natural history subjects and the aim seems to have been to emulate similar but more expensive offerings from publishers like Ladybird and Observer&#x27;s. Eight titles were issued with the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; name, and only with the last did they move into more familiar I-Spy territory with &quot;In The Garden&quot;. When the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; closed, four further colour titles followed under the Dickens Press name. These were new editions of titles which had originally appeared in the 6d black and white series but been discontinued. The last title came out in 1963 and the 12 books were never numbered. The listing below is the order in which the titles were released. The covers of some of the titles were later updated, and then appeared without the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; logo.

<text>Agioi Theodoroi () is a town and a former municipality in Corinthia, Peloponnese, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform, it is part of the municipality Loutraki-Perachora-Agioi Theodoroi, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of .

Agioi Theodoroi is located around east of Corinth and about W of Athens in the easternmost part of Corinthia. Its population was 4,643 inhabitants at the 2011 census. The well known &quot;Pefkakia&quot;, an organized beach is in the eastern part of the town with many pine trees and golden sand. The west is bounded by the massive Corinth Refinery which is the country&#x27;s largest industrial complex operated by Motor Oil Hellas with the Kalamaki hills and mountains dominating the northern part, and the Attica boundary with Kineta to its east. The municipality is bounded with Loutraki in the west and Megara in the east. Agriculture used to dominate before the 1960s and the 1970s. Now most of the agricultural land is in the north and the east. Some of the houses are summer homes. It has a beautiful pedestrian street by the sea. Many coffee shops, restaurants and beach bars are lining the sea front of the town. The central avenue of the town is part of the old Athens - Corinth highway. It has many shops and services, supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, restaurants etc. and two historical churches.

==History==
Northwest of the city of Agioi Theodoroi, in 1961, archaeologists unearthed the ruins of ancient Krommyona. Important discoveries were made like a statue of Apollo, many black-figured vases, geometric and lakoeideis graves. According to Stravona, the entire coastal region of the Saronic and the Eleusinian Gulf was named Krommyona. Krommyona until the 6th century. BC belonged to Megara and then to Corinth.

There are two versions of the name of the ancient Krommyonas. The first version is that it got its name because of the onion production and the second version is that it got its name from the son of Poseidon Krommo.

The area was known from the legend of Faias, the fearsome boar that the legendary hero Theseus killed on his way from Trizina to Athens.

An important finding is also a small circular area which has not been determined whether it was a worship place or a small orchestra theater.

===Historical population===

==Transportation==

Agioi Theodoroi is served by the A8 motorway (Athens - Corinth - Patras) and a rail station of Proastiakos suburban railway connecting it directly to the city of Athens, to the Athens International Airport and Corinth. Also intercity buses between Athens and the Peloponnese stop here and tourist buses during the summer period.

<doc id="564470" wikidata="Q1344054" url="?curid=564470" title="Enrique V. Iglesias">
<text>Enrique Valentín Iglesias García (born 29 March 1930 in Arancedo, Asturias) is a Spanish-Uruguayan economist. He served as the first president of the Central Bank of Uruguay from 1967 to 1969. He has also served as President of the Inter-American Development Bank from 1988 to 2005, an international institution dedicated to furthering economic development in the Western Hemisphere through investment and policy formulation. He was appointed as Special Adviser for Venezuela to Federica Mogherini, the European Union&#x27;s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission, on 28 May 2019.

==Biography==
Enrique was born in Asturias, Spain, in 1930 to Manuel Iglesias and Isabel García. His parents emigrated to Uruguay in 1934 and Enrique was naturalized as a Uruguayan citizen, he currently holds Uruguayan-Spanish dual citizenship. By university, Iglesias had established an interest in government and economics; in 1953, he graduated from Uruguay&#x27;s Universidad de la República with a degree in economics and business administration. After graduation, he went on to private-sector banking, which led to a term as the president of Uruguay&#x27;s Central Bank (1967-1969). Iglesias held a variety of influential posts, including Minister of Foreign Relations, before being elected president of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in 1988.

During Iglesias&#x27;s first and second terms as president, the IDB concluded negotiations for its Seventh (1989) and Eighth (1994) General Increase in Resources. Respectively, these negotiations increased the Bank&#x27;s ordinary capital by US$26.5 billion and $101 billion.

Iglesias is an honorary member in The Club of Rome, promoting a one world government.

He is also a member of the Fondation Chirac&#x27;s honour committee, ever since the foundation was launched in 2008 by former French president Jacques Chirac in order to promote world peace.

==Political views and controversy==

Iglesias is a strong proponent of open markets and multilateralism, with a strong interest in energy reform. Under Iglesias&#x27; tenure, the IDB has received criticism about its funding of the project. In a report recently leaked by U.S. Amazon lobby group Amazon Watch, Peru&#x27;s Ministry of Health found that &quot;22 indigenous people died after exposure to respiratory illnesses from gas pipeline workers and 30% of the 500-strong Nanti tribe has died since 1995&quot;. The subject is especially delicate since many of the indigenous people in question have little contact with the developed world and do not possess the antibodies to contagious diseases brought by outsiders. The IDB met in Lima, Peru, the week of March 29, 2004 to discuss this and other problems.

==Post-IDB Career==
On June 1, 2005, Iglesias announced his resignation from the IDB, effective September 30, 2005. Later in 2005 he became secretary-general of the Ibero-American General Secretariat, a new organization to facilitate cooperation between Latin America, Spain, and Portugal.

Enrique Igleasias is a Member of the Global Leadership Foundation, an organization which works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today&#x27;s national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organization composed of former heads of government, senior governmental and international organization officials who work closely with Heads of Government on governance-related issues of concern to them. He is also a member of Washington D.C.–based think tank, the Inter-American Dialogue.

Staryi Ostropil is located at latitude 49°48&#x27; N, longitude 27°34&#x27; E and is situated at an altitude of 742.5 feet (225 m). The town of Lyubar is 11.1 miles (18.5 km) from Staryi Ostropil.

Ostropil was an important Jewish center in the 17th century and was mentioned in many contemporary texts including the birthplace of the noted Rabbi, Kabbalist and martyr Samson ben Pesah Ostropoli. Its Jewish population was wiped out along with that of Starokostiantyniv by the Nazis in 1942 before being liberated by the Red Army in 1945. The 5200 murdered Jews have since been commemorated at the Holocaust Memorial Park in Brooklyn, New York.

Until 18 July 2020, Staryi Ostropil belonged to Starokostiantyniv Raion. The raion was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Khmelnytskyi Oblast to three. The area of Starokostiantyniv Raion was merged into Khmelnytskyi Raion.

There are two cemeteries, one across the street from the other. Both are in a dilapidated condition.

<doc id="564484" wikidata="Q1786400" url="?curid=564484" title="The Breakers">
<text>The Breakers is a Gilded Age mansion located at 44 Ochre Point Avenue, Newport, Rhode Island, US. It was built between 1893 and 1895 as a summer residence for Cornelius Vanderbilt II, a member of the wealthy Vanderbilt family.

The 70-room mansion, with a gross area of and of living area on five floors, was designed by Richard Morris Hunt in the Renaissance Revival style; the interior decor was by Jules Allard and Sons and Ogden Codman Jr.

The Ochre Point Avenue entrance is marked by baroque forged wrought iron gates, and the walkway gates are part of a limestone-and-iron fence that borders the property on all but the ocean side. The footprint of the house covers approximately or 43,000 square feet of the estate on the cliffs overlooking Easton Bay of the Atlantic Ocean.

The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1994. It is also a contributing property to the Bellevue Avenue Historic District. The property is owned and operated by the Newport Preservation Society as a museum and is open for visits all year.

==History==

Cornelius Vanderbilt II purchased the grounds in 1885 for $450,000 (equivalent to $ in ). The previous mansion on the property was owned by Pierre Lorillard IV; it burned on November 25, 1892, and Vanderbilt commissioned famed architect Richard Morris Hunt to rebuild it in splendor. Vanderbilt insisted that the building be made as fireproof as possible, resulting in a structure composed of masonry and steel trusses, with no wooden parts. He even required that the boiler be located away from the house in an underground space below the front lawn.

The designers created an interior using marble imported from Italy and Africa, and rare woods and mosaics from countries around the world. It also included architectural elements purchased from chateaux in France, such as the library mantel. Expansion was finally finished in 1892.

The Breakers is the architectural and social archetype of the &quot;Gilded Age&quot;, a period when members of the Vanderbilt family were among the major industrialists of America. It was the largest, most opulent house in the Newport area upon its completion in 1895.

Vanderbilt died from a cerebral hemorrhage caused by a stroke in 1899 at age 55, leaving The Breakers to his wife Alice Gwynne Vanderbilt. She outlived him by 35 years and died at the age of 89 in 1934. She left The Breakers to her youngest daughter Countess Gladys Széchenyi (1886–1965), essentially because Gladys lacked American property; in addition, none of her other children were interested in the property, while Gladys had always loved the estate.

In 1948, Gladys leased the high-maintenance property to The Preservation Society of Newport County for $1 per year. The Preservation Society bought The Breakers and approximately 90% of its furnishings in 1972 for $365,000 (equivalent to $ in ) from Countess Sylvia Szapary, Gladys&#x27;s daughter, although the agreement granted her life tenancy. Upon her death in 1998, The Preservation Society agreed to allow the family to continue to live on the third floor, which is not open to the public. This occupancy ended in 2018.

, it was the most-visited attraction in Rhode Island, with approximately 450,000 visitors annually.
==Gardens==
The pea-gravel driveway is lined with maturing pin oaks and red maples. The trees of The Breakers&#x27; grounds act as screens that increase the sense of distance between The Breakers and its Newport neighbors. Among the more unusual imported trees are two examples of the Blue Atlas Cedar, a native of North Africa. Clipped hedges of Japanese yew and Pfitzer juniper line the tree-shaded footpaths that meander about the grounds. Informal plantings of arbor vitae, taxus, Chinese juniper, and dwarf hemlock provide attractive foregrounds for the walls that enclose the formally landscaped terrace.

The grounds also contain several varieties of other rare trees, copper and weeping beeches. Today’s pattern for the south parterre garden was determined from old photographs and laid out in pink and white alyssum and blue ageratum. The wide borders paralleling the wrought iron fence are planted with rhododendrons, mountain laurel, dogwoods, and many other flowering shrubs that effectively screen the grounds from street traffic and give visitors a feeling of seclusion.

==Layout==

===Basement===
*Laundry
*Staff&#x27;s restrooms

===First floor===
*Entrance foyer
*Gentlemen&#x27;s reception room
*Ladies&#x27; reception room
*Great hall () – Over each of the six doors that lead from the Great Hall are limestone figure groups celebrating humanity&#x27;s progress in art, science, and industry: Galileo, representing science; Dante, representing literature; Apollo, representing the arts; Mercury, representing speed and commerce; Richard Morris Hunt, representing architecture; and Karl Bitter, representing sculpture.
*Main staircase
*Arcade 
*Library – The library has coffered ceilings painted with a dolphin, symbolic of the sea and hospitality, supported by Circassian walnut paneling impressed with gold leaf in the form of a leather-bound book. Between the ceiling and the gold paneling lies green Spanish leather embossed with gold, which continues into the library from the alcove used for cards. Inside the central library are two busts: a bronze of William Henry Vanderbilt II, the oldest child of Cornelius II and Alice, who died of typhoid at the age of 21 while attending Yale University; and a marble of Cornelius Vanderbilt II. The fireplace, taken from a 16th-century French chateau (Arnay-le-Duc, Burgundy), bears the inscription &quot;I laugh at great wealth, and never miss it; nothing but wisdom matters in the end.&quot;
*Music room – The room&#x27;s open interior was used for recitals and dances. Its woodwork and furnishings were designed by Richard Van der Boyen and completed by Jules Allard and Sons. The room has a gilt coffered ceiling lined with silver and gold, as well as an elliptical ceiling molding which bears the inscription in French of song, music, harmony and melody. Around the edge are the names of well-known composers. The fireplace is of Campan marble and the tables were designed to match. Mr. Vanderbilt was known to play the violin and Mrs. Vanderbilt the piano, which is a Second Empire French mahogany ormolu mounted piano.
*Morning room – Designed by the French company head Jules Allard, this communal sitting room faces east to admit the morning sun, and was used throughout the day. Placed around the room are platinum-leafed panels illustrated with 8 of the 9 muses. All interior woodwork and furnishings were designed and constructed in France, then shipped to America before assembly.
*Lower loggia
*Billiards room – Designed in the style of ancient Rome, this room shows m Richard Morris Hunt’s competence in stone works. The great slabs of Cippolino marble from Italy form the walls, while rose alabaster arches provide contrast. Throughout the room there is an assortment of semi-precious stones, forming mosaics of acorns (the Vanderbilt family emblem, intended to show strength and longevity) and billiards balls on the top walls. The Renaissance style mahogany furniture provides further contrast with that of the colored marble.
*Dining room – The dining room is the house&#x27;s grandest room and has 12 freestanding rose alabaster Corinthian columns supporting a colossal carved and gilt cornice. Rich in allegory, this room serves as an exemplar of what 19th-century technology could do with Roman ideas and 18th-century inspiration. On the ceiling, the goddess Aurora is depicted bringing in the dawn on a four-horse chariot as Greek figures pose majestically. A 16th-century style table of carved oak seats up to 34. Two Baccarat crystal chandeliers light the room with either gas or electricity, and 18, 22 or 24 carat gold gilt is adhered to the wall with rabbit-skin glue.
*Breakfast room – The breakfast room, with its modified Louis XV style paneling and furnishings, was used for family morning meals. The furnishings, colors and gilt, although still extravagant in their use, contrast with the dining room&#x27;s more lavish decoration.
*Pantry – A central dumbwaiter brought additional china and glassware down from the mezzanine level. The pantry was also used for the storage of the family&#x27;s table silver; this was brought with the family when they traveled, and stored in a steel vault. An intercom system allows the butler to direct the necessary servants to their needed locations, and each number on the caller corresponds to a number on a room.
*Kitchen – The kitchen, unlike others in the time period, was situated on the first floor away from the main house to prevent the possibility of fires and cooking smells reaching the main parts of the house. The well-ventilated room supports a cast iron stove, which heats up as a single element through a coal burning stove. The work table is made of zinc, a metal which served as the forerunner to stainless steel; in front of it is a marble mortar used to crush various ingredients. Ice cut in winter from the local ponds kept the side rooms cool where food was stored, and facilitated a colder room for the assembling of confections. The kitchen and baking pantry each have one dumbwaiter that travels to the basement level where groceries were delivered and refuse removed.

===Second floor===
*Mr. Vanderbilt&#x27;s bedroom – As with the rest of the second floor, Ogden Codman designed this room, choosing Louis XIV Style. The bed is made of carved walnut and the mantel is of rouge royal marble, which hosts a large mirror above to bring more light into the room. There is much memorabilia of family and friends, though Cornelius Vanderbilt II lived only a year at the Breakers in good health, before dying the following year, 1899, of a stroke.
*Mrs. Vanderbilt&#x27;s bedroom – A perfect oval, Alice Vanderbilt&#x27;s room has multiple doors connecting it to other bedrooms. Four closets allowed for her possible seven clothing changes per day, and a pager to administer and delegate family needs to the servants. This room also served as her study and had many bookshelves. Additionally, there are discreetly designed corridors that permitted female servants to maintain the laundry and costume needs of the family in a seemingly invisible fashion.
*Miss Gertrude Vanderbilt&#x27;s bedroom – Gertrude, daughter of Cornelius II and Alice, was a less conforming character who wished to be loved for her personality rather than her wealth and family; later she found her match in Harry Payne Whitney and became an artist. Multiple pieces of her artwork are featured in the room, including &quot;The Engineer&quot;, which was inspired by her brother during World War I, &quot;Laborer&quot;, and another that commemorates the American Expeditionary Force of World War I. She moved into The Breakers when she was 19. Above her bed is a portrait of her at age 5 by Raimundo de Madrazo y Garreta, and beside it, to the left of the bed, a sketch of her as a young woman.
*Upper loggia – Opening east to the Atlantic, the upper loggia served as an informal living room. During the summer the glass doors overlooking the great hall could be opened to allow a breezeway. The walls are painted marble, and the ceiling is designed to depict three canopies covering the sky. The lawn, designed by James and Ernest Bowdwitch, hosted many parties and was well kept by a gardening staff of 20, who also introduced and maintained various non-indigenous trees.
*Guest bedroom – This room exemplifies the Louis XVI style through furniture, woodwork and light fixtures, with Neoclassical style abounding in the interior. The wall paneling has never been retouched, though the rest of the room has been restored by the preservation society.
*Countess Szechenyi&#x27;s bedroom – Designed by Ogden Codman in 18th-century simple elegance style, this room features an ivory and cream-colored motif.
*There are also two other rooms located on the second floor, possibly a nursery and a nanny&#x27;s bedroom.

===Third floor===
The third floor contains eight bedrooms and a sitting room decorated in Louis XVI style walnut paneling by Ogden Codman. The north wing of the third-floor quarters were reserved for domestic servants. Using ceilings nearly , Richard Morris Hunt created two separate third floors to allow a mass aggregation of servant bed chambers. This was because of the configuration of the house, built in Italian Renaissance style, which included a pitched roof. Flat-roofed French classical houses built in the area at the time allowed a concealed wing for staff, whereas the Breakers&#x27; design did not permit this feature.

A total of 30 bedrooms are located in the two third-floor staff quarters. Three additional bedrooms for the butler, chef, and visiting valet are located on the mezzanine &quot;entresol&quot; floor, located between the first and second floor just to the rear of the main kitchen.

===Attic floor===
The attic floor contained more staff quarters, general storage areas, and the innovative cisterns. One smaller cistern supplied hydraulic pressure for the 1895 Otis elevator, still functioning in the house even though the house was wired for electricity in 1933. Two larger cisterns supplied fresh and salt water to the many bathrooms in the house.

Over the grand staircase is a stained glass skylight designed by artist John La Farge. Originally installed in the Vanderbilts&#x27; 1 West 57th Street (New York City) townhouse dining room, the skylight was removed in 1894 during an expansion of that house.

===Materials===
*Foundation: brick, concrete, and limestone
*Trusses: steel
*Walls: Indiana limestone
*Roof: red terra cotta tile
*Wall panels: platinum leaf (eight reliefs of mythological figures only)
*Other: marble (plaques), wrought iron (gates and fences)

===The architect===
The Breakers was designed by Richard Morris Hunt, one of the country&#x27;s most influential architects. It is regarded as 
a definitive expression of American Beaux-Arts architecture. Hunt&#x27;s final project, it is also one of his few surviving works, and is valued for its architectural excellence. The home made Hunt the &quot;dean of American architecture&quot;, as he was called by his contemporaries, and helped define the Gilded Era in American history.

==Media==
The house makes an appearance at the end of the establishing shot of the 1990 American drama Reversal of Fortune, where it stands in as the Newport mansion of Sunny and Claus von Bulow, which was instead the nearby Clarendon Court.

The Music room was used in the HBO series The Gilded age (2022–present), the room was featured on the season 1 finale as the Russels&#x27; ballroom when they threw a coming out ball for their daughter Gladys.

== The Great Elephant Migration - A Coexistence Story ==

Between July 2024 and July 2025, The Great Elephant Migration will display a herd of 100 elephants – sculpted from the vines of Lantana camara – across the United States.  Various sites around Newport, Rhode Island – including The Breakers, Salve Regina, and other spaces along the Cliff Walk – will host the collection before it is moved to New York, Miami, Montana, and Los Angeles.  Lantana camara is an invasive weed in India, and threatens elephants and other herd populations by restricting their access to more viable vegetation necessary for survival.  By harvesting and making use of these weeds for the elephant sculptures, more than 200 indigenous artists are able to both promote and live a path of coexistence and conservation, and the funds raised by the sale of these elephants goes to help further that initiative.

<text>Altered Carbon is a 2002 British cyberpunk novel by the English writer Richard K. Morgan. Set in a future in which interstellar travel and relative immortality is facilitated by transferring consciousnesses between bodies (&quot;sleeves&quot;), it follows the attempt of Takeshi Kovacs, a former U.N. elite soldier turned private investigator, to investigate a rich man&#x27;s death. It is followed by the sequels &quot;Broken Angels&quot; and &quot;Woken Furies&quot;.

The book was adapted as a Netflix television series, also titled &quot;Altered Carbon&quot;, in 2018. In 2019 a graphic novel was created with Dynamite Comics.

==Premise==

In the future, humans have achieved virtual immortality. Most people have cortical stacks in their spinal columns that store their consciousness. If their body dies, their stack can be stored indefinitely. Their stacks can be downloaded into new bodies, or &quot;sleeves&quot;, after death. Roman Catholics do not allow their stacks to be re-sleeved after death, as they believe that the soul goes to Heaven when they die, and so would not pass on to the new sleeve. This makes Catholics easy targets for murder, since killers know their victim may not be re-sleeved to testify. At the start of the novel, UN Resolution 653 is being debated. This proposition reverses precedent and would allow authorities to temporarily re-sleeve a deceased Catholic woman to testify in a murder trial. Dual-sleeving, or controlling two bodies with one personality, is strictly prohibited by U.N. law.

While most people can afford to get resleeved at the end of their lives, they are unable to update their bodies and must go through the full aging process each time, which discourages most from re-sleeving more than once or twice. Thus, while people can live indefinitely in theory, most choose not to. Only the wealthy are able to acquire replacement bodies on a continual basis. Those who have lived for multiple lifespans are called Meths, a reference to the Biblical figure Methuselah. The very rich are also able to keep copies of their minds in remote storage, which they update regularly. This ensures that even if their stack is destroyed, they can be re-sleeved. People who commit serious crimes are imprisoned &quot;on stack&quot;. Their consciousness is preserved and stored virtually, sometimes for decades, while their body is sold to the highest bidder to be used for re-sleeving another person.

Numerous colony planets exist apart from Earth; many were previously inhabited by an extinct alien civilization referred to as the Elders. In order to deal with the challenges of interspace warfare, the U.N. created the Envoys. They are an elite military group with extensive training in re-sleeving and psychological modification, as well as combat. Envoys are so successful and dangerous that they are generally prohibited from holding elected office on any world.

==Plot summary==

On the colony planet of Harlan&#x27;s World, Takeshi Kovacs and his partner Sarah Sachilowski, former Envoys who had returned to a life of crime, are killed by a U.N. colonial commando unit. Kovacs is sentenced to a long term in stack storage. On Earth, a Meth named Laurens Bancroft has died in mysterious circumstances in Bay City (formerly San Francisco). The re-sleeved Bancroft has no memories of the previous two days, including his own death. Though police officer Kristin Ortega believes he committed suicide, Bancroft is convinced he was murdered. He uses his influence to have Kovacs temporarily released from storage, then hires him to investigate. Kovacs discovers that Bancroft has been involved with numerous prostitutes, including recent murder victim Elizabeth Elliot. Elizabeth&#x27;s mother Irene was imprisoned for illegally hacking Bancroft&#x27;s memories. Elizabeth&#x27;s father is too poor to re-sleeve Elizabeth or to free his wife from the stacks.

Laurens&#x27; wife, Miriam, seduces Kovacs and bribes him to end the investigation. A high-level Russian operative named Kadmin tries to assassinate Kovacs, but fails and is captured. Kovacs investigates the brothel where Elizabeth worked. He learns he is wearing the sleeve of Elias Ryker, a corrupt police officer and Ortega&#x27;s lover. He is tortured by physicians from the Wei Clinic, who deal in black market sleeve theft. He tells his interrogators that he is an Envoy and they release him. A mysterious woman named Trepp says she will bring Kovacs to Ray, who is behind the clinic&#x27;s operations. Kovacs escapes, destroys the brothel and clinic, and murders the employees in the process.

Kovacs and Ortega are injured in an explosion orchestrated by Kadmin, who has escaped police custody. Trepp brings Kovacs to &quot;Ray&quot;, or Reileen Kawahara. Kawahara is a Meth mob boss with whom Kovacs has dealt in the past. He had rejected her offers of partnership, believing her to be cruel and manipulative. Kawahara orders Kovacs to end his investigation, or she will torture Sarah, who is currently in virtual storage.

Kovacs and Ortega begin sleeping together and form a partnership. Kovacs agrees to convince Bancroft he committed suicide. His version of the story is as follows. Bancroft contracted the Rawlings virus from a brothel. The Rawlings virus is designed to scramble cortical stacks and prevent re-sleeving, causing permanent death. To prevent it from contaminating his clones, Bancroft committed suicide. Kawahara agrees to procure a copy of the virus for Kovacs. With Kawahara&#x27;s help, he retrieves Irene Elliot from stack, and hires her to implant the Rawlings virus into a brothel.

Kovacs learns that Bancroft went to an airship-turned-brothel named Head in the Clouds on the night he died. This establishment is run by Kawahara. Kadmin kidnaps Ortega and threatens to kill her unless Kovacs trades himself for her. Ortega is released, and Kovacs is forced to fight in a duel against Kadmin. Trepp and the police arrive, killing Kadmin. Kovacs destroys Kadmin&#x27;s stack.

Kovacs double-sleeves, controlling both Ryker and a second body simultaneously. The copy in Ryker&#x27;s sleeve leaves with Miriam to draw away surveillance. Ortega and Kovacs infiltrate Head in the Clouds. Irene spikes Kawahara&#x27;s personality backup with the Rawlings virus, destroying all of her clones. Kovacs forces a confession from Kawahara. After a Catholic prostitute was murdered at Head in the Clouds, her resurrection would have revealed Kawahara&#x27;s illegal activity. As part of her cover-up, Kawahara framed Ryker for corruption, since he was investigating the murder. She asked Bancroft to help her kill Resolution 653 to prevent the prostitute from testifying, but he refused. Kawahara and Miriam had Bancroft drugged; out of his mind, he killed a prostitute and then killed himself in order to erase the memory out of guilt and self-preservation. With his memories gone, Kawahara&#x27;s involvement could not be traced.

Assisted by Trepp, Kovacs blows out the side of the airship. As he and Kawahara fall to the ocean below, he uses a grenade to destroy Kawahara&#x27;s stack, ensuring her permanent death.

In the aftermath, Bancroft is cleared by the U.N. for his involvement with Kawahara. The copy of Kovacs that stayed with Miriam is erased, as double sleeving is illegal, but he makes the surviving copy of Kovacs promise to cover up Miriam&#x27;s involvement. Irene Elliot gets her body back, Elizabeth and Ryker are freed from the stacks, Resolution 653 passes, and Kovacs is freed and returned to Harlan&#x27;s World.

==Reception==
Describing the book, &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; said that &quot;The body count is high, the gadgetry pure genius, the sex scenes deliriously overwrought, and the worn cynicism thoroughly distasteful: a welcome return to cyberpunk&#x27;s badass roots.&quot;

The book won the Philip K. Dick Award for Best Novel in 2003.

==In other media==
===Television===

A television adaptation was announced in 2016. An initial 10-episode season had been ordered by Netflix. The first season premiered on Netflix on 2 February 2018.

Extensive and significant changes to the source material were made in the adaptation.

In the series Envoys are presented as having been trained, deployed and led by Quellcrist Falconer as part of a revolution (called &quot;the Uprising&quot;) that she leads on Harlan&#x27;s World (Kovacs&#x27; home planet). Kovacs is shown as having been trained as an Envoy by, and serving as a revolutionary under, Falconer. The Quellist Revolution is crushed by the Protectorate (the established, inter-planetary government) in an apocalyptic assault. Kovacs, the only survivor, is presented as the last Envoy.
In the books, Envoys were and are the elite forces of the Protectorate (which would have been fighting against the revolution); Falconer did lead a revolution but died long before Kovacs was born; Kovacs trained as an Envoy under a different woman; and the Envoy Corps is still very much in use by the Protectorate and remains widely feared, although Kovacs is no longer a member of Corps.

The makers of the show have also chosen to expand the roles of many characters, particularly female characters.

In the book, the hotel in which Kovacs stays while investigating Bancroft&#x27;s murder is themed after Jimi Hendrix. Since the Hendrix estate does not approve of licensing his image for anything they consider violent, the show instead chose the figure of Edgar Allan Poe and named the hotel The Raven.

===Film===
On 8 November 2018, Netflix announced an animated companion film, &quot;Altered Carbon: Resleeved&quot;, set in the same universe and exploring new elements of the story mythology. On 10 February 2020, it was unveiled that the exclusive Netflix &quot;anime featured&quot; spin-off would debut on 19 March 2020. The film was directed by Jo Nakajima at Anima; Yoshiyuki Okada designed the characters, Ren Kikuchi supervised the CG animation, and MONACA composed the music. The Japanese cast includes Tatsuhisa Suzuki as Takeshi Kovacs, Rina Satou as Gina, Ayaka Asai as Holly Togram, Jouji Nakata as Ogai, Kenji Yamauchi as Hideki Tanaseda, Kanehira Yamamoto as Shinji, and Kōji Ishii as Genzo.

Regional elections in were held in France on 21 and 28 March 2004. At stake were the presidencies of each of France&#x27;s 26 regions which, although they do not have legislative powers, manage sizeable budgets. The results were a triumph for the parties of the left, led by the French Socialist Party (PS) in alliance with minor parties, including the French Communist Party (PCF), the Left Radical Party (PRG) and The Greens (&quot;Les Verts&quot;). The left has usually fared moderately well in regional elections, but this was their best result since the regional system was introduced.

The left won control of twenty of the twenty-two regions of metropolitan France, defeating the parties of the mainstream right, the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) and the Union for French Democracy (UDF), and the extreme right National Front (FN). The results were seen as a major setback for the then President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin.

Since no candidate gained a majority in any region, a second round was held on 28 March, in which only candidates who polled more than 10% in the first round were eligible to run (except in Corsica, where the threshold is 5%). The UMP seat numbers are compared to those of the RPR and RPR dissidents together in 1998, the UDF seat numbers are compared to those of the UDF and UDF dissidents together in 1998.

<text>Yellow Red Koninklijke Voetbalclub Mechelen (), often simply called KV Mechelen () or KVM, or by their former French name FC Malinois, is a Belgian professional football club based in Mechelen in the Antwerp province. KV Mechelen plays in the Belgian Pro League. They have won four Belgian championships and twice the Belgian Cup, as well as the 1987–88 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and the 1988 European Super Cup. They collected most of their honours in the 1940s and in the 1980s.

KV Mechelen was founded in 1904 and, in 1921–22, promoted to the first division. After two successive relegation and promotion, they were back for good between 1928–29 and 1955–56. In the 1960s and 1970s, the club had several promotions and relegations between the first and second division. From 1983–84 to 1996–97, they had a successful first division spell, with a title and several second- and third-place finishes. During that period, they also won a European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and they reached the same competition semi-finals as well as the European Cup quarter-finals.

KV Mechelen declined in the late 1990s though they had two more spells at the highest level from 1999–2000 to 2000–01 and in 2002–03. At the end of that season, the club did not receive their Belgian professional football license. They were therefore relegated to the third division with a nine-point penalty. After two promotions in 2004–05 and in 2006–07, KV Mechelen returned to the first division.

The club&#x27;s outfits are a striped yellow and red shirt with black shorts and socks. They play their home matches at the AFAS-stadion Achter de Kazerne, where AFAS is their stadium sponsor and &quot;Achter de Kazerne&quot; means &#x27;Behind the Barracks&#x27;. The stadium has been named so because there used to be barracks next to stadium. KV Mechelen fans have a long-standing rivalry with KRC Mechelen.

==History==

===Early days===
The club was founded in 1904, a few months after the birth of city rival KRC Mechelen. The club had a first successful period in the 1940s. During World War II, in 1943, the club won their first domestic title. The second title came a few years later, in 1946, and in 1948 the club was successful again. After that, the club fell back. In 1954, they managed to finish third, only one point behind champions Anderlecht, but that was their last good season. Two years later, Mechelen was relegated to second division. During the 1960s and the 1970s, Mechelen went up and down between the first and second division.

=== High days ===

The club enjoyed a spell of both domestic and European success in the period from 1987 to 1992. During these five seasons, Mechelen won one Belgian championship and one Belgian cup title. They also finished second in the Belgian league twice and lost the Belgian Cup final twice. After winning the domestic cup title in 1987, and hence qualifying for the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, they completed the extraordinary achievement of winning this tournament in 1988. Coached by Aad de Mos, the well balanced team with international players like Michel Preud&#x27;Homme, Lei Clijsters, Erwin Koeman, Marc Emmers and Eli Ohana defeated Ajax in the final 1–0. In the 1988–89 season, the team also won the European Super Cup against another Dutch side, PSV Eindhoven. Mechelen are the last Belgian team that has won a European trophy.

KV Mechelen seemed to be on its way to becoming one of the top clubs in Belgium, but quickly declined when their chairman John Cordier (who owned the rights to most of their players) was forced to sell many players due to his company&#x27;s bad results. A few years in a row, Anderlecht, located in nearby Brussels, attracted top players from Mechelen such as Graeme Rutjes, Johnny Bosman, Marc Emmers, Bruno Versavel, Philippe Albert and Glen de Boeck. Coach de Mos also made the switch. 

In 1997, Mechelen finished second to last again, and was therefore relegated to the Second Division.

===Since 2000===
On 10 June 2007, the team achieved promotion to the Belgian First Division. Two years later in 2009, KV Mechelen played the final of the Belgian Cup, losing it 2–0 to Genk. One year after that, they stranded in the semi-finals with a 2–2 draw and a 1–0 loss against KAA Gent.

After a successful 2010 and four seasons for the yellow reds, coach Peter Maes decided to leave Malinwa and signed a four-year contract with Lokeren. Malinwa made a deal with Marc Brys to take over from Maes. Marc Brys was coach of FC Den Bosch, a second division team in the Netherlands. After two seasons he was sacked and Harm Van Veldhoven was appointed for the 2012–13 season. Van Veldhoven also could not lead KV Mechelen to Play-off 1, the clubs&#x27; recent unspoken ambition. He was fired in December 2013. At the end of the 2013–14 season KV Mechelen appointed Aleksandar Janković as head coach. Despite Janković&#x27;s inability to lead the club to Play-off 1, Janković left for topclub Standard Liège and Mechelen had to appoint a new manager. The club ended up choosing Yannick Ferrera for the vacant job, who had just been fired as manager of Standard Liège.

===Match-fixing and 2017–19 Belgian football fraud scandal===
2017 through 2019 proved to be a tumultuous period for the club. After eleven seasons at the highest level, the club was relegated on the last day of the 2017–18 season as a 2–0 win over Waasland-Beveren left them in last place on goal difference, due to Eupen beating Moeskroen by a bigger margin (4–0). During the following season, while the club was very successful on the pitch, winning both the 2018–19 Belgian First Division B and the 2018–19 Belgian Cup, the 2017–19 Belgian football fraud scandal emerged in which the club was accused of match-fixing their final match of the 2017–18 season, allegedly having attempted to bribe certain players and officials of Waasland-Beveren. 

In March 2019, the club was found guilty and forced to relegate back to the First Division B despite winning promotion, and also denied to take part in the 2019–20 Belgian Cup and 2019–20 UEFA Europa League, the latter for which they had qualified by winning the cup. The club appealed the decision at the Belgian Arbitration Court for Sports which ruled on 10 July 2019 that, in accordance with the rules set by the Royal Belgian Football Association, relegation was not a possible punishment in the circumstances. As a result, the club was punished with a one-season ban from European football and the Belgian Cup. The proceedings were plagued with controversy, with evidence (including witness statements) from an investigation into financial crimes in Belgian football not being made available during these disciplinary proceedings, as well as the impartiality of the prosecutor being called into question.

=== Second Belgian Cup ===

In May 2019, more than 30 years after their last major trophy, second division side Mechelen won the Belgian Cup after a 2-1 victory over Gent in the final at the King Baudouin Stadium. Germán Mera scored the winning goal after Nikola Storm made the equalizer.

==Rivalries==
KV Mechelen&#x27;s most traditional rival is Racing Mechelen. However the two have sparingly met in the modern era, the last time in 2005, where the game had to be stopped due to crowd violence. Traditionally KV Mechelen was the club of the catholic elite in the city while Racing was set up by the secular, liberal classes, with nationalist sympathies. KV Mechelen has since taken on a more broader support from the Antwerp province and beyond while Racing&#x27;s support has died down due to being in inferior divisions.

KV Mechelen also have a rivalry with football clubs from the neighbouring town of Lier (mainly Lierse SK and its successors). They additionally have a rivalry with Beerschot Antwerp, which was heightened during the Match fixing scandal of 2017–2019, due to Mechelen&#x27;s promotion instead of Beerschot despite being found guilty of match fixing in the previous season.

It proved to be a highly successful campaign, with Mechelen reaching the final undefeated by winning seven of their eight matches &quot;en route&quot;. They then went on to defeat Ajax 1–0 in the final, Piet den Boer scoring the decisive goal early in the second half. The following season Mechelen played 1988 European Cup winners PSV in the UEFA Super Cup, and defeated the Dutch side 3–1 on aggregate. Mechelen remain the last Belgian club team to have won a European club competition.

<text>London &#x27;66–&#x27;67 is an EP and film of Pink Floyd music, containing two &quot;lost&quot; tracks—an extended version of &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; and a previously unreleased track &quot;Nick&#x27;s Boogie&quot;. These tracks were originally recorded for Peter Whitehead&#x27;s film &quot;Tonite Let&#x27;s All Make Love in London&quot; in 1967, and the former appeared in edited form on the soundtrack album. Originally released in full on the 1990 See for Miles Records UK reissue of the soundtrack album, they were the earliest Pink Floyd recordings available commercially before the limited release of &quot;1965: Their First Recordings&quot; in 2015.

The EP was originally issued in 1995, then reissued by Snapper Music (SMACD924X, 2005) on 13 September 2005, as a remastered CD and a DVD featuring the entire film plus excerpts from the original movie. The EP is considered an early example of the jazz fusion genre, incorporating jazz-influenced improvisation to their psychedelic compositions.
