<text>St Helen&#x27;s (previously known as the Aviva Tower or the Commercial Union building) is a commercial skyscraper in London, United Kingdom. It is tall and has 23 floors. The postal address is No. 1, Undershaft, though the main entrance fronts onto Leadenhall Street, in the City of London financial district.

The building was designed by the Gollins Melvin Ward Partnership in the international style: the stark rectilinear geometry and detailing of the building was influenced by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and is somewhat reminiscent of his Seagram Building in New York City. It was built by Taylor Woodrow Construction as one of only four high-rise buildings in London using a top-down engineering design where the lower office floors are suspended from above rather than supported from below.

In 1992, the building was heavily damaged in the Baltic Exchange bombing carried out by the Provisional IRA, as a result of which it was substantially renovated.

The building was sold in 2003 by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority to property developer Simon Halabi. In 2007, it was reported that Halabi was considering plans to demolish the building and replace it with a much taller tower, but this plan was not fulfilled. In 2011, it was reported that the building had been sold to an undisclosed Far Eastern private investor for £288 million. Plans for the site submitted in February 2016 feature a tall, 72-floor tower largely given to office space. In November 2016, planning permission was granted for the Trellis Tower, which will house up to 10,000 workers and which, upon completion, would bave been the tallest building in the City of London and the second tallest building in the UK, after The Shard, but this design was ultimately discarded in favour of a quad-segmented tower revealed in August 2023.

==History==
===Design and development===
In 1961, the Commercial Union Assurance Company had acquired a site in St Mary Axe, in the City of London, which it desired to develop as its new headquarters. The site comprised adjacent properties in St Mary Axe and the former Shell building in Great St Helens. At the same time, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company was planning to redevelop its city offices in Leadenhall Street.

Due to a number of issues affecting both sites, notably poor access to the Commercial Union site and the restricted width of the Peninsular and Oriental site, it was not possible to obtain planning consents that would optimise the amount of floor space desired by either company. As a result, the two companies decided to participate in a joint development that would involve the reallocation of site boundaries and the creation of an open concourse area at the junction of Leadenhall Street and St Mary Axe. Both companies were to have frontages on the new concourse and would retain site areas equivalent to those enclosed by the original boundaries.

The architect for the project was the Gollins Melvin Ward Partnership, who acknowledged the influence of Mies van der Rohe. The design was an elongated cube in the modernist international style. The original cladding (apart from the windows) was anodidized aluminium, whose colour changed in varying lighting conditions from dark grey to dark bronze.

The tower has 24 usable office floors. In addition there are two double-height plant floors; the boiler rooms on one of the plant floors also serviced the neighbouring Peninsular and Oriental building. The floor-to-site-area ratio is 5.5:1. There were five underground levels, providing the staff restaurant, garage and three levels of storerooms and strongrooms.

Below the lowest office floor, the design was broken by an open podium which was designed to provide elevated pedestrian access via the City of London Pedway Scheme. Pedway was an ambitious but ultimately unfulfilled scheme to improve traffic flow in the City of London by means of the construction of a network of elevated pedestrian walkways. From the mid-1960s to the 1980s, developers of major sites were required to provide access to the Pedway network as a condition of obtaining planning consent. The requirement was unpopular with designers, who regarded the results as visually unappealing unused space that often provided pedestrians with dead ends. In the case of this development, a podium-level walkway was constructed that linked the Commercial Union building with its neighbour, the Peninsular and Oriental building.

===Construction===

The construction of the Commercial Union building was undertaken by Taylor Woodrow Construction.

The structure comprises a central concrete service core, surrounded by a steel framework suspended from projecting steel truss sections at the mid- and roof-level plant floors. The office floors are suspended from these steel frameworks; the roof section supports twelve floors while the midsection supports 13 floors. The steel hangers are installed in alternate window mullions and vary in size: × . This suspended construction design was aimed at maximising floor space by largely eliminating the need for support columns.

The new piazza in front of the two new buildings was below street level, and steps were constructed on two sides. Air intake louvres for ventilating the building&#x27;s five sub-surface levels were built into the treads of the steps. The piazza was planted with semi-mature lime trees.

===Awards===
In 1970, the Commercial Union and Peninsular &amp; Oriental buildings won the Civic Trust Award for townscape and design co-ordination. In the same year the Commercial Union building was awarded the Structural Steel Design Special Award, sponsored by the British Steel Corporation and the British Constructional Steelwork Association.

<text>The ashy prinia or ashy wren-warbler (Prinia socialis) is a small warbler in the family Cisticolidae. This prinia is a resident breeder in the Indian subcontinent, ranging across most of India, Nepal, Bangladesh, eastern Pakistan, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and western Myanmar. It is a common bird in urban gardens and farmlands in many parts of India and its small size, distinctive colours and upright tail make it easy to identify. The northern populations have a rufous rump and back and have a distinct breeding and non-breeding plumage while other populations lack such variation.

==Description==
These 13–14 cm long warblers have short rounded wings and a longish graduated cream tail tipped with black subterminal spots. The tail is usually held upright and the strong legs are used for clambering about and hopping on the ground. They have a short black bill. The crown is grey and the underparts are rufous in most plumages. In breeding plumage, adults of the northern population are ash grey above, with a black crown and cheek with no supercilium and coppery brown wings. In non-breeding season, this population has a short and narrow white supercilium and the tail is longer. They are found singly or in pairs in shrubbery and will often visit the ground.

In winter, the northern subspecies, &quot; P. s. stewartii&quot; Blyth, 1847, has warm brown upperparts and a longer tail and has seasonal variation in plumage. The other races retain summer plumage all year round. West Bengal and eastwards has the race &quot;inglisi&quot; Whistler &amp; Kinnear, 1933, which is slatier above than the nominate race of the Peninsula and deeper rufous on the flanks with a finer and shorter beak. The distinctive endemic race in Sri Lanka, &quot; P. s. brevicauda&quot; Legge, 1879, has a shorter tail and the juveniles have yellowish underparts apart from a distinct call.

==Distribution and habitat==
This passerine bird is found in dry open grassland, open woodland, scrub and in home gardens in many cities. The northern limits of the species are along the Himalayan foothills extending into the upper Indus river system. The species is absent from the dry desert zone of the west of India and extends east into Burma. The Sri Lankan population is found mainly in the lowlands but going up into the hills to about 1600 m.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Like most warblers, the ashy prinia is insectivorous. Their song is a repetitive &#x27; or &#x27;. Another call is a nasal &quot;&quot;. It also makes a sound like &quot;electric sparks&quot; during its fluttery flight, which is thought to be produced by the wings, although one author suggests that it is made by the beak.

The non-migratory genus &quot;Prinia&quot; shows biannual moult, which is rare among passerines. One moult occurs in spring (April to May) and another moult occurs in autumn (October to November). Biannual moult is theorized to be favoured when ectoparasite loads are very high; however, no investigations have been made. &quot;Prinia socialis&quot; moults some remiges twice a year and is termed to have a partially biannual moult; however, some authors describe &quot;P. socialis socialis&quot; as having two complete moults.

Birds stay in pairs but roost singly on the branch of a small tree or shrub.

===Breeding===
The song is sung from the top of a bush and males make fluttery display flights with the tail held up. The ashy prinia builds its nest close to the ground in a shrub or tall grass. Several types of nests have been described, including a flimsy cup made by sewing several large leaves, an oblong purse-like structure with grass stems inside it, and a flimsy ball of grass. The usual nest is built low in a bush and consists of leaves stitched together with webs, lined with hair and having an entrance on the side. It lays 3 to 5 glossy, somewhat oval-shaped eggs which hatches in about 12 days. They vary in colour from brick-red to rich chestnut. The broad end of the egg is generally darker than the remainder of the shell, and exhibits a cap or zone. The eggs measure in length, and in breadth.

The breeding season varies with locality and has been recorded around the year, but mostly after the monsoons. In northern India it is mainly June to September and in Sri Lanka mainly December to March or August to October. Breeding season is during May to June in the Nilgiris. The species is believed to be monogamous, and both the male and the female take part in incubation and feeding, though to varying extents. Parents may spend more time at the nest during cool days. Plaintive and grey-bellied cuckoos are known to be brood parasites of this species. When the nest is threatened by predators such as cats, adults have been observed feigning injury.

Rare cases of birds reusing material from a nest to build a nest at a new location have been noted.

<text>USS &quot;Little Rock&quot; (CL-92/CLG-4/CG-4) is a -class light cruiser and one of 27 completed for the United States Navy during or shortly after World War II. She is one of six to be converted to guided missile cruisers and the first US Navy ship to be named for Little Rock, Arkansas. Commissioned in mid-1945, she was completed too late to see combat duty during World War II and was retired post-war, becoming part of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet in 1949.

In the late 1950s, she was converted to a guided-missile cruiser, removing her aft six-inch and five-inch guns to accommodate the Talos missile system. Like three other of her sister &quot;Cleveland&quot; ships converted to missile ships, she was also extensively modified forward to become a flagship. This involved removal of most of her forward armament to allow for an enlarged superstructure and was recommissioned in 1960 as CLG-4 (redesignated CG-4 in 1975). In this configuration, she served in the Mediterranean, often as the Sixth Fleet flagship.

She decommissioned for the final time in 1976 and is now a museum ship, located in Buffalo, New York. She is the last surviving Cleveland-class cruiser.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Little Rock&quot; was laid down by William Cramp &amp; Sons Shipbuilding Company, Philadelphia, 6 March 1943; launched 27 August 1944, sponsored by Mrs Sam Wassell and commissioned 17 June 1945.

==Service history==

===Cleveland Class Light Cruiser CL-92 (1945-1949)===
&quot;Little Rock&quot; departed Philadelphia on 13 July 1945, and sailed via Naval Operating Base Norfolk, Portsmouth, Va., for her shakedown training cruise to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. She returned to Philadelphia, on 30 August for post-shakedown repairs until 26 September, when she commenced local operations out of Newport, R.I., for the training of the prospective crew of the aircraft carrier Princeton (CV-37). On 21 October 1945, &quot;Little Rock&quot; departed Newport, for a cruise to South America, steaming via San Juan, P.R., to arrive at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 10 November 1945. She then called at the ports of Chile, including Concepcion Bay; thence to Callao, Peru; and Santa Elena, Ecuador. She completed the transit of the Panama Canal (11-15 March) and after a visit to Cartagena, Colombia (16-18 March), returned to Norfolk on 23 March 1946.

&quot;Little Rock&quot; sailed on 19 April 1946 for maneuvers with units of the Eighth Fleet in the Caribbean and returned to Philadelphia, on 12 May for repairs. &quot;Little Rock&quot; then departed on 4 June 1946, for an extended cruise in European waters. On 11 June, she arrived at Plymouth, England. After a voyage to Gibraltar, she visited ports around northern Europe. She returned to Plymouth on 31 July, and then visited Lisbon, Portugal, before arrival at the British Crown Colony of Gibraltar, on 22 August, to commence a tour of the Mediterranean. She called at Naples, Italy (27 August-3 September); Piraeus, Greece; Valletta, Malta; and Bone, Algeria. She departed Valletta, on 17 September, and returned to Norfolk, on 27 September 1946. From November 21–27, 1946, was en route to Davis Strait as part of Task Group 20.2. Between 27 November and 4 December, she participated in cold-weather exercises, between Greenland and Baffin Island, as part of Task Group 20.2.

During the deployment, she was firing 5-inch star shells off the port side of &quot;Missouri&quot; for illumination, when there was a misfire. As the gunner began to point the barrel toward the water, as per standard procedure, the round cooked-off, (thermally induced firing) and struck &quot;Missouri&quot; on the signal bridge, killing Coxswain Robert Fountain and starting a fire involving an acetylene tank lashed to the railings. &quot;Missouri&quot; did not return to Norfolk until 13 December 1946.

&quot;Little Rock&quot; conducted local operations at Norfolk until 21 November 1946, and after operations with Missouri (BB-63) to Argentia, Newfoundland, returned to New York on 13 December 1946. She commenced local operations at Newport, on 9 January 1947, then steamed to Charleston, S.C., arriving on 8 February. She embarked Naval Reservists here for a training cruise, departing 10 February for San Juan. She debarked her reservists at Charleston, on 22 February, and sailed that same day for New York, arriving on 25 February 1947.

&quot;Little Rock&quot; underwent overhaul in the New York Naval Shipyard, Brooklyn, N.Y., until 3 July 1947. After local training operations at Newport, she departed Boston on 22 July for a training cruise to Guantanamo Bay, returning to Newport for further local operations on 30 August 1947.She sailed for the Mediterranean on 10 November, and arrived at Gibraltar to commence operations with the Sixth Fleet on 20 November 1947. During this tour, she visited such ports as Augusta Bay, Naples and Tangiers. During this tour while in Greece, &quot;Little Rock&quot; participated in helping to suppress communist attempts to take over the country. Upon leaving Greece, &quot;Little Rock&quot; was sent to Palestine to help re-establish stability after the bombing of the King David Hotel. To enforce this Captain Mee of the &quot;Little Rock&quot; ordered the ship close to shore and then trained all turrets and 6 in guns on Tel Avia as a deterrent against more attacks against the British and Allies. Afterwards, &quot;Little Rock&quot; was ordered to Gibraltar, and then departed on 2 March returning to Newport on 11 March 1948. &quot;Little Rock&quot; actions during her latest cruise constituted one of the first Cold War Naval Actions against communist forces in Europe as well as provided US support and intervention for the yet new nation of Israel.

&quot;Little Rock&quot; conducted operations while based at Newport until 13 September 1948. During this time she made four training cruises to the respective ports of Port-au-Prince, Haiti; San Juan Quebec, Canada and St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands (30 July-15 August). On 13 September 1948, she departed Newport for another tour in the Mediterranean, arriving at Gibraltar on 23 September. During this tour, she again visited the principal ports of the Mediterranean and took part in maneuvers with units of the Sixth Fleet in the operating areas off Malta and Crete. She departed Gibraltar on 14 January 1949, and arrived at Newport on 23 January 1949. She arrived at the Naval Ammunition Depot, Earle, N.J., on 4 February, and after unloading ammunition, entered the New York Naval Shipyard for pre-inactivation overhaul on 8 February 1949. She was placed out of commission on 24 June 1949 and joined the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at New York.

===Service as &quot;Galveston&quot;-class guided missile cruiser CLG-4/CG-4 (1957-1976)===
&quot;Little Rock&quot; arrived at the yard of the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, N.J., on 13 January 1957, which began conversion of the ship to a guided missile light cruiser on 30 January 1957. Change in classification and hull number from CL-92 to CLG-4 became effective on 23 May 1957. As converted, &quot;Little Rock&quot; had a full-load displacement of 15,142 tons and was configured as a fleet flagship. New weapon control devices and radars directed her missile battery. &quot;Little Rock&quot; was delivered to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 6 May 1960, where she was commissioned on 3 June 1960, Capt. Jewett O Phillips Jr. in command. Sen. J. William Fulbright (D-Ark) delivered the address at the commissioning ceremony, attended by 2,000 people.

&quot;Little Rock&quot; remained in Philadelphia until 25 July 1960, when she had sea trials off of Virginia. Her tests completed, &quot;Little Rock&quot; sailed for Guantanamo Bay, arriving there on 5 September to begin shakedown training. She also visited Port-au-Prince (17-19 September). She left Guantanamo Bay on 15 October, to proceed to the missile firing range off the coast of Puerto Rico. &quot;Little Rock&quot; also visited St. Thomas (21-23 October). She returned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and spent two months at Philadelphia undergoing post-shakedown outfitting.

&quot;Little Rock&quot; got underway for Norfolk, on 4 January 1961, and left on 9 January 1961, to participate in Atlantic Fleet Exercise l-61, which lasted until 20 January. Departing Philadelphia, on 9 February 1961, &quot;Little Rock&quot; sailed for her first European cruise in her new role. Upon her arrival in the Mediterranean, she was designated flagship for Commander, Cruiser Division Four (ComCruDiv4). She was relieved by Newport News (CA-148) as flagship in August 1961, and returned to the U.S., at Naval Operating Base, Norfolk, Va. in September. A month later, she was designated the flagship for Second Fleet.

&quot;Little Rock&quot; departed for Bayonne, N.J., on 12 February 1962, and then to Nassau, Bahamas. This was her last at-sea period before entering the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Va., on 15 March, and received a new bow-mounted sonar installation and electronic detection equipment.

The cruiser steamed for the Mediterranean on 1 May 1963, for another deployment with the Sixth Fleet. She relieved Springfield (CLG-7) as fleet flagship on 11 May. During her eight-month deployment, she visited seventeen ports in eight different countries. She was relieved by Springfield on 15 December, at Rota, Spain and returned to her homeport at Norfolk, on 24 December, in time for the crew to celebrate Christmas. Leave and maintenance occupied the next two months.

The cruiser steamed up the Chesapeake Bay from Norfolk, on 2 June 1963, to the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md. After embarking midshipmen for their summer cruise, she steamed into the North Atlantic on 4 June, and returned to Norfolk on 24 July. Through the fall, she carried out local operations and on 28 November, she departed Norfolk, bound for missile trials in the Caribbean. She rejoined the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean, on 14 December, where she relieved Boston (CAG-1). During this 1965 deployment, she visited 13 ports in six countries. During this assignment, she participated in Operation Fairgame, cooperating with ships of the French Navy and other Sixth Fleet units. &quot;Little Rock&quot; was relieved by Albany (CG-10) on 2 June, and began her return to Norfolk, arriving on 10 June. Ten days later, on 20 June, Vice Adm. Kleber S. Masterson broke his flag on board &quot;Little Rock&quot; as Commander, Second Fleet and NATO Striking Force, Atlantic. She departed on 24 August, for a six-week training exercise in the North Atlantic, during which she visited ports in Europe. Back at Norfolk on 7 October, &quot;Little Rock&quot; spent the remainder of 1965, in local operations and maintenance. While operating in the Caribbean, on 18 November 1965, &quot;Little Rock&quot; was ordered to the waters off Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, during the uncertainty and unrest in that country after the assassination of the Dominican president, Rafael Leónidas Trujillo.

&quot;Little Rock&quot; entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 18 January 1966 for an extensive overhaul. Upon the completion in late September, &quot;Little Rock&quot; returned to the Norfolk Naval Base. During the months of October and November 1966, the ship training and guided missile trials in the waters off Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and afterward, she returned to Norfolk. Departing on 16 January, she steamed for Rota, Spain, and there she relieved Springfield as Sixth Fleet flagship.

Leaving Rota, the ship steamed to Casablanca, Morocco, arriving on 30 January, and departing again on 3 February. &quot;Little Rock&quot; entered Gaeta, Italy, her new home port, not only for &quot;Little Rock&quot;, but also for ComSixthFlt, who had previously been home-ported at Villefranche-sur-Mer, France. From 4 February until 14 July, &quot;Little Rock&quot; spent port time in Gaeta, a three-day visit to Rota, Spain, in April. She participated in distant readiness related to the coup in Greece, and the June Arab-Israeli war. From 31 March to 4 April, &quot;Little Rock&quot; participated in Operation Dawn Clear, a NATO exercise in anti-air (AAW), anti-submarine (ASW), and anti-surface warfare. The flagship participated as a unit of Task Force (TF) 502. A month later, from 2 May-11 May, the cruiser took part in Fairgame VI, providing AAW, ASW, and anti-surface protection to units of TF 502 and TF 503. This time the ship operated with the French cruiser Colbert (C-611), flagship of the French Mediterranean fleet.

====1967: Six-Day War, USS Liberty incident====
During the late spring and early summer, &quot;Little Rock&quot; was involved in three contingency operations arising out of international events in the Mediterranean. The first occurred in April during the Greek coup. The flagship left Rota, Spain, to join the task force to evacuate U.S. nationals, if necessary. The second and most volatile situation was the June war between the Arab nations and Israel. The ship had been scheduled to get underway on 25 May, for Missilex 14–68, to return on the 27th. On 23 May 1967, the Sixth Fleet received orders to move into the eastern Mediterranean, four days after the United Arab Republic (UAR) [Egypt] had ordered the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) to withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula. On 26 May 1967, the UAR remilitarized the Sinai and declared a blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba off the Israeli port of Eilat. An increased Soviet naval presence appeared soon thereafter, as the first Soviet warships transited the Dardanelles from the Black Sea and began more aggressive shadowing of U.S. naval movements. On the night of 24 May, she received news of impending hostilities. &quot;Little Rock&quot; left Gaeta, on schedule, at 1100, 25 May, but not for the exercise. The ship joined TF 60 and exercised in the central Mediterranean as a part of the task force until 3 June. The war broke out ashore on 5 June 1967, and TF 60 maintained a readiness and Vice Adm. Martin was instructed to keep ships and aircraft &quot;at least 100 [nautical miles] away from the coasts of Lebanon, Syria, and Israel, and the United Arab Republic [Egypt], and at least 25 nautical miles away from Cyprus&quot;. On 8 June the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; (AGTR-5) was in international waters off the northern coast of the Sinai Peninsula in the afternoon on 8 June 1967, when she was attacked by the Israeli Defense Forces. Thirty-four crewmen were killed and 174 wounded and though she was severely damaged with a 39-by-24-foot hole amidships and a twisted keel, &quot;Liberty&quot; crew kept her afloat. At 1719 that same day, Davis (DD-937) and Massey (DD-778) received verbal orders to proceed at once to assist &quot;Liberty&quot;. Davis conducted a brief helo transfer of two people and equipment from America (CV-66) between 1806 and 1808 and increased speed.

While &quot;Liberty&quot; steamed slowly away from the coastline, her bloodied captain remaining on the bridge to inspire his crew, and his men toiling to minimize her damage and keep her afloat, her &quot;black gang&quot; getting and keeping her underway and her small but providentially spared medical department succoring the wounded, Davis (Capt. Harold G. Leahy, Commander Destroyer Squadron 12, embarked) and Massey raced to her aid. Davis worked up to 30 knots during the first watch on 8 June, and maintained that speed during the mid watch on 9 June 1967.

The two destroyers reached the limping &quot;Liberty&quot; during the morning watch on 9 June 1967, finding her listing to starboard, while the plethora of shell and fragment holes topside, the burned and scarred paintwork, and the gaping torpedo hole in her hull bore mute testimony to the unbridled ferocity of the attack of the previous afternoon.

Davis rang down &quot;all stop&quot; at 0632 on 9 June 1967 and lay-to, launching her motor whaleboat. The boat then made runs between Davis and &quot;Liberty&quot;, transferring medical and damage control parties. At 1030, two helicopters from America rendezvoused with &quot;Liberty&quot; and began transferring the more seriously wounded to the carrier. An hour later, about 350 miles east of Souda Bay, Crete, America rendezvoused with &quot;Liberty&quot;. The carrier&#x27;s crew, as well as &quot;Little Rock&quot;, lined every topside vantage point, silent, watching the helicopters bring 50 wounded and nine dead from &quot;Liberty&quot; to America. As &quot;Liberty&quot; drew alongside, listing, her sides pocked and perforated with shell, nearly 2,000 of the carrier&#x27;s crew were on the flight deck and, spontaneously moved by the sight, gave the battered &quot;Liberty&quot; and her crew a cheer.

America&#x27;s medical team worked around the clock removing shell fragments, and treating various wounds and burns.

Once on the scene &quot;Little Rock&quot; transferred Lt. John C. Cockram, her damage control assistant, in addition to two corpsmen, to &quot;Liberty&quot;, and took on board some of the less seriously wounded men. Later, after Davis had transferred two photographers to the ship by helicopter at 1402, Ens. David P. Breuer, Davis&#x27;s main propulsion assistant, was transferred to the battered ship by helo at 1606. As the destroyer&#x27;s ship&#x27;s historian later noted proudly, &quot;Davis...established vital ship functions, assisted in cleaning up the ship and provided hot food for the &quot;Liberty&quot; crew...&quot; and handled all communications. Lt. Cmdr. William R. Pettyjohn, chief staff officer, ComDesRon 12, assumed the duties as &quot;Liberty&quot; executive officer (9-14 June) replacing Lt. Cmdr. Armstrong, who had died of his grievous wounds suffered in the attack. Vice Adm. Martin visited &quot;Liberty&quot; on 9 June, arriving and departing by helicopter to see the damage for himself.

&quot;Little Rock&quot; sick bay also aided the stricken ship. Most of the seriously wounded men were taken to America, where two &quot;Little Rock&quot; corpsmen were dispatched to help in the operating room. Eight of the less seriously wounded, however, were cared for in &quot;Little Rock&quot; sick bay. The cruiser returned to Gaeta on 19 June, many days after her scheduled return.

====Continued exercises====
After the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War, &quot;Little Rock&quot; increased the pace of visits to friendly ports of call.&quot;Little Rock&quot; called at various Mediterranean ports and was afterwards engaged in Amphibious Exercise (PHIBLEX) 2-68, 13 August. A major amphibious landing conducted on the coast of Sardinia culminated the exercise. &quot;Little Rock&quot; participated as a unit of TF 60 and protected the amphibious ships from air and submarine attack and surface raiders during the transit to the beachhead. While at Monaco, the ship was visited by Prince Rainier and Princess Grace.

&quot;Little Rock&quot; spent the next three weeks in Gaeta. These were followed by more than two weeks of operations Deep Furrow, Eager Beaver, and Dense Crop (22 September-6 October). These were NATO exercises conducted by ComStrikForSouth and held in the Ionian and Aegean seas. The exercise units included British, Greek, Italian, and Turkish ships participating in major war games between U.S. and Turkish land forces. &quot;Little Rock&quot;, as a member of TF 502, assisted in supporting the amphibious task force against attack in transit to and landing on Turkish soil. This exercise was followed by a five-day visit to Istanbul (7-12 October). Upon anchoring in the Bosporus, &quot;Little Rock&quot; was met with hostile demonstrations. The government would not guarantee the safety of U.S. sailors ashore. After 15 days at sea, liberty was cancelled on the first night in Istanbul for all except a small number. The liberty party was forced to take a long boat trip to the Golden Horn to a temporary landing. The normal fleet landing was in the hands of Communist-led demonstrators. The cruiser visited Athens (13-18 October). While there, the ship hosted a luncheon for His Majesty, King Constantine of the Hellenes. The ship next visited Barcelona, Spain, (9-14 November). &quot;Little Rock&quot; entered a tender availability period in Naples from 15 to 27 November. &quot;Little Rock&quot; returned to Gaeta to spend the Christmas and New Year&#x27;s holidays in port.

&quot;Little Rock&quot; was still at her homeport on 1 January 1969. Departing Gaeta on 4 January, she supported the amphibious assault and live firing exercises as a part of PHIBLEX 10–68 at Porto Scudo and Capo Teulada, Sardinia. The amphibious assault was preceded by an opposed transit to the objective area from 5–7 January, in the Tyrrhenian Sea. As a unit of Task Group (TG) 61.5 &quot;Little Rock&quot; operated in direct support of TF 61 and under operational control of CTF 61. She provided AAW and ASW, as well as playing the part of a surface raider Komar (Fast Patrol Boat of Soviet design)--for protection of the amphibious task force landing during the opposed transit and naval gunfire support upon arrival in the amphibious objective area.

On 1 March 1968, &quot;Little Rock&quot; began Fairgame VI, a bilateral exercise with the French military, conducted in the western Mediterranean. She joined U.S. and French ships at Lovo Santo, Corsica, France, and observers were exchanged. At 1600 on 2 March, &quot;Little Rock&quot; sortied as part of TF 502, while the French Hunter-Killer (HUK) Group (TG 514.1) proceeded independently under French command. TF 502, supported by the HUK group, conducted simulated conventional attacks and photo reconnaissance against targets in France, while operating in a hostile submarine area. The French Southern Region Air Defense Forces opposed U.S. Air Opposition and French tactical air force and naval aircraft conducted reconnaissance and attacks against 502 and TG 514.1. Phase Bravo (AAW/ASW) was conducted (3-6 March). Phase Charlie, the opposed transit and combined amphibious landing phase, lasted from 7–10 March. As part of TF 502, &quot;Little Rock&quot; supported Amphibious Task Force 503 in an opposed transit through the Straits of Bonificio to the Amphibious Objective Area. During the transit, TF 502 and TG 514.1.1 provided AAW and ASW protection against attacks opposing aircraft, submarines, and simulated missile patrol boats. On 10 March, bendex was called and all attacks and all units entered the anchorage at Lovo Santo. The exercise resolved coordination issues between Sixth Fleet and French forces.

&quot;Little Rock&quot; participated in Operation Dawn Patrol 68 (29 April-10 May). &quot;Little Rock&quot; primary role was AAW and ASW support for two amphibious squadrons, TG 503.1 and TG 503.2. Shangri-La (CVA-38) provided aircraft for both Strike and Combat Air Patrol (CAP) and Italian and British forces also participated. At the completion of the exercise, the cruiser steamed to Athens (11-14 May), then to Naples (15-17 May), before returning to Gaeta. While in port, she underwent an operational readiness inspection. The ship departed Gaeta on 17 June, conducting type training in the Ionian and Tyrrhenian Seas until 22 June. She participated in the Sixth Fleet&#x27;s 20th anniversary commemoration of the fleet&#x27;s founding on 25 June, and then spent a time at Gaeta (26 June-9 July). Departing her homeport, she participated in a submarine opposed transit exercise on 10 July, and was visited by Secretary of the Navy Paul R. Ignatius on 10–11 July. After being back at Gaeta (13-22 July), &quot;Little Rock&quot; got underway on 23 July, and visited Valencia, Spain (25-29 July) and Palma, Mallorca, Spain (30 July-3 August), before returning to Gaeta, on 5 August. The ship participated in the Sixth Fleet change of command at Naples, on 14 August, and after a return to Gaeta (15-18 August), she got underway to participate in Exercise Deep Furrow 68 as part of TG 502.1 (17-23 August). 

Departing Gaeta on 4 January 1969, &quot;Little Rock&quot; participated in PHIBLEX 8-69, an exercise for the Amphibious Task Force to conduct an opposed transit and assault landing at Capo Teulada, Sardinia. &quot;Little Rock&quot; operated as a surface raider, simulating a Soviet Sverdlov-class cruiser conducting simulated surface attacks on the Amphibious Task Force until 8 January. Later, she became a part of the friendly forces, entered the Amphibious Objective Area and conducted Naval Gunfire Support (NGFS), in support of the Amphibious Assault. &quot;Little Rock&quot; was detached late on 8 January, for transit to Taranto, for a port visit, (10-13 January). Underway again, she shifted to Villefranche (15-18 January), and then back to Gaeta on 19 January. The flagship again took leave of Gaeta on 2 March, to join TF 60 in the Ionian Sea, for participation in Exercise National Week II. Affecting her rendezvous on 3 March, the flagship defended the task force from air and surface attacks, &quot;while maintaining a sustained anti-submarine posture. She detached late on 5 March, to proceed to Souda Bay, in order that ComSixthFlt could visit the naval base there. Departing Souda Bay, the following day, the flagship steamed for Gaeta, conducting Engineering Casualty Control Exercises en route, arriving on 8 March.

&quot;Little Rock&quot; remained in port until 15 April 1969, when she got underway bound for Palma, conducting type training while en route. She conducted a port visit (17-21 April) and upon her departure, sped to join TG 60.2 in the Ionian Sea for the NATO Exercise Dawn Patrol 69. The flagship joined TG 60.2 and transferred to NATO control, becoming part of TG 502.2 and provided support for the amphibious task force. She operated with the carrier unit, providing air defense to the task group and in-depth ASW surface support. On 30 April, &quot;Little Rock&quot; detached from the supporting group (TG 502.2) and joined the Amphibious Task Force (TF 503) in the objective area, providing simulated naval gunfire support for the assault forces. During the exercise, the flagship was visited by Adm.Thomas H. Moorer, Chief of Naval Operations. &quot;Little Rock&quot; detached and transferred to national control on 30 April, for transit to Gaeta, arriving on May 1. She departed Gaeta, on 12 May, she proceeded to join TF 60 in the Ionian Sea, for Exercise National Week III, joining the task force on 22 May, upon the commencement of the exercise. She operated as an AAW picket station, providing air, surface, and sub-surface defense. Detaching on 25 May, &quot;Little Rock&quot; returned to Gaeta, the next afternoon. The flagship was again underway on 3 June conducting various exercises en route to join TG 502.2 in the Ionian Sea for Exercise Olympic Express, one of a series of major exercises in the southern European region, involving NATO land, sea, and air forces employed in the defense of a NATO country from aggression. The basic concept involved a NATO Amphibious Task Force (TF 503) forming at Souda Bay, and conducting an opposed transit into the .Aegean Sea for an amphibious assault at Kavalla, Greece. The flagship reverted to NA&#x27;IO control on 4 June, joining TG 502.2. Task Unit (TU) 502.2.4 (Defense Unit Bravo) was formed, in which &quot;Little Rock&quot; operated, remaining in the vicinity of the carrier to provide AAW, missile, ASW, and surface defense to the carrier group.

&quot;Little Rock&quot; steamed out of Gaeta on 7 July 1969, bound for the Malta Missilex Area in the Ionian Sea, to fire two Talos missiles and conduct exercises on 8 July. Afterward, she steamed to Monaco, and conducted a port visit (11-15 July), where she was again visited by the Prince and Princess of Monaco. At the conclusion of the port call, she returned to Gaeta on the 17th, refueling en route. Getting underway on 28 July, and conducting training en route, she arrived at Rota, on 1 August. &quot;Little Rock&quot; departed on 5 August, en route to Exercise PHIBLEX 2-70, which began on 6 August. During the exercise, the flagship simulated a Soviet Kresta-class guided-missile cruiser with surface-to-surface cruise missiles. From 6–9 August, she carried out her role, conducting surface-to-surface missile attacks against the Amphibious Task Force and its supporting forces. On 10 August, she switched roles and became a part of the &quot;Blue&quot; forces entering the Amphibious Objective Area to observe the assault landing to conduct live naval gunfire support for the landing. Detaching on 10 August, she proceeded to Gaeta, arriving there on 11 August. &quot;Little Rock&quot; received a grade of outstanding on her Annual Nuclear Weapons Proficiency Inspection on 19 August. The cruiser was again underway on 25 August, to join TF 60 in the Ionian Sea for Exercise National Week IV. She joined the task force in the Ionian Sea on 26 August, to operate as an AAW picket, controlling interceptor aircraft and defending TF 60 from air, surface, and sub-surface missile attacks. She detached and refueled on 28 August 28, returning to Gaeta, the following day.
On 30 August 1969, the emergency recall bill was affected in response to the Palestinian hijacking of an American jetliner. &quot;Little Rock&quot; proceeded to sea on 4 September, for special contingency operations with TF 60. The operation was highlighted by the sighting of the Soviet helicopter carrier Moskva. These special operations were terminated for the flagship on 10 September, at which time she proceeded to Taranto, for a ComSixthFlt briefing. She arrived the morning of 11 September, and departed the same day, arriving in Gaeta, on the 13th. Underway again on 23 September, she was bound for a visit to Dubrovnik. She departed on 29 September, en route to Athens (1-6 October). Afterward, she steamed back to Gaeta (8-15 October). Underway again, she joined TG 60.1 in the Ionian Sea on 16 October for Deep Furrow 69. The major concept of the exercise was for an Amphibious Task Force to form at Souda Bay, and conduct an opposed transit through the Aegean Sea, and conduct an assault landing at Saros Bay, Turkey. &quot;Little Rock&quot; operated under NATO control from 17 to 25 October, as part of the supporting group (TG 502.1) providing air, ASW, and surface defense for the Amphibious Task Force and its supporting elements. &quot;Little Rock&quot; was assigned many duties, including air intercept control, Grumman F-14 Tomcat control, plane guard duties, ASW screening duties and NGFS of the assault landing. Deep Furrow 69 completed for U.S. forces on 25 October, and immediately a special contingency operation was placed in effect in the Ionian Sea and was carried out until 4 November 4, at which time TG 60.1, including &quot;Little Rock&quot;, entered Athens for rest and relaxation. The flagship remained in Athens until 8 November, when she got underway en route to Naples for a scheduled tender availability with Grand Canyon (AD-28). The flagship arrived in Naples on 10 November 10. She completed the tender availability and got underway for Gaeta on 22 November, arriving the same day. On 2 December, she got underway for Valletta, arriving the next day. Getting underway again on 6 December, &quot;Little Rock&quot; steamed for a missile exercise with TG 60.2. Due to adverse weather, however, the exercise was cancelled and the cruiser proceeded to Toulon, arriving on the 9th. En route the flagship rendezvoused with Neosho (AO-143) and units of Task Force 60 for refueling. After only a one-day operational visit, the flagship got underway on 10 December, to participate in Exercise Mediterranean, a U.S.-French bilateral exercise. The exercise was a combined operation which involved land, sea and air forces. &quot;Little Rock&quot; operated with the &quot;Blue&quot; forces as an AAW picket ship, providing air, missile, and anti-submarine protection. During the course of the exercise, she assumed tactical command of the Blue supporting forces for the opposed transit of the Strait of Bonificio. On completion of the transit, the cruiser returned to the assigned AAW picket station. She detached on 13 December and proceeded to Lovo Santo, to join the Amphibious Task Force and provided pre-H-hour simulated NGFS. On completion of the scheduled firing, the flagship detached and proceeded to Gaeta. Arriving on 13 December, the flagship began a holiday leave period which lasted into January 1970.
&quot;Little Rock&quot; was underway again on 7 January 1970, bound for Villefranche. En route, she conducted a successful gunfire exercise with Hoist (AFS-40) and rearmed from Suribachi (AE-21). John Warner, Under Secretary of the Navy, was embarked in the ship from Villefranche to Genoa, Italy. After visiting Genoa (13-15 January), &quot;Little Rock&quot; proceeded to Gaeta, arriving 16 January. En route, an underway replenishment (UNREP) was conducted from Sylvania (AFS-2) and Concord (AFS-5). She refueled at the Nata fuel pier on 26 January, and the ship got underway for the first exercise of the year, National Week V, on 30 January. This exercise required a great deal of coordination among units of the Sixth Fleet. On 2 February, &quot;Little Rock&quot; joined TG 60.l in the Ionian Sea. She conducted an UNREP from Neosho, and once again rearmed from Suribachi. En route to the rendezvous, the flagship conducted an anti-air gunfire exercise utilizing a sleeve towed by an aircraft. At 0800 on 3 February, National Week V commenced and shortly thereafter, &quot;Little Rock&quot; gained a sonar contact. Robert H. McCard (DD-822), which was in company with the cruiser, was vectored over the contact for a simulated attack. During subsequent events, the contact was classified as a submarine by the sighting of a periscope. On completion of the exercise, she returned to Gaeta, arriving on 6 February. She cleared Gaeta on 20 February, for her annual western swing of the Mediterranean, and en route to Tangier, she successfully completed another anti-air gunfire exercise. After a four-day visit in Tangier (23-26 February), she shifted to Gibraltar (27-28 February), before moving on to Lisbon (3-6 March), Rota (8 March), and Barcelona (10-13 March) &quot;Little Rock&quot; departed on 14 March for Gaeta, refueling from Neosho en route. The cruiser was once again underway on 3 April, to participate in National Week VI. She participated in this exercise (4-5 April) in the Ionian Sea. On commencement of the exercise, &quot;Little Rock&quot; operated as a unit of Task Group 60.1, but she shifted to Task Group 60.2 on 5 April, for refueling from Waccamaw (AO-109). She rejoined TG 60.1, the next day and on the 7th, Adm. Bernard A. Clarey, Vice Chief of Naval Operations, arrived by helicopter to confer with ComSixthFlt. At the conclusion of the conference, Adm. Clarey departed by highline to King (DDG-3). During the time Admiral Clarey was on board, &quot;Little Rock&quot; participated in a surface multiple ship tracking exercise and an air-intercept control exercise. Because of the ship&#x27;s primary mission as a flagship, independent operations, there were few opportunities for conducting competitive exercises. On completion of all exercises on 7 April, the ship proceeded to Valletta, refueling again from Waccamaw en route. 
&quot;Little Rock&quot; got underway for Palma on 23 May 1970. The ship spent five days in Palma, departing on 30 May. That same day, &quot;Little Rock&quot; arrived at Ciudadella, Minorca, Spain, to participate in ceremonies honoring Adm. David G. Farragut. She set a course for Athens, and departed on 31 May, briefly participating in NATO Exercise Dawn Patrol 70, which consisted of providing anti-air and surface warfare support for a U.S. Amphibious Task Group transiting from Naples, to Porto Scudo, Sardinia. The ship provided simulated shore bombardment support to the amphibious assault force, which was simulating the evacuation of U.S. nationals from Porta Scudo. She, on 5 June, proceeded to Athens, and arrived on the 8th. She refueled from Mississinewa (AO-144) en route and on 1 June, while transiting Kitharan Passage, she was taken under simulated attack by four Greek fast patrol boats operating as enemy units in Dawn Patrol. The flagship remained in Athens four days, getting underway on 12 June, to resume participation in the NATO exercise. The ship&#x27;s assignment was to provide simulated shore bombardment for the amphibious assault group at Pythron, Greece. At 0446, on 13 June, a collision occurred with an errant Greek destroyer, Longhi (DD.656), which was also participating in the exercise. After an assessment of damage, considered minor, both ships continued with their assigned missions. 
&quot;Little Rock&quot; departed for Valencia on 29 July 1970, for a five-day port visit. On 4 August, the flagship departed Valencia for Capo Teulada, where she participated in a live shore bombardment on 5 August. The cruiser proceeded for Gaeta, that same day, for the last time as Sixth Fleet flagship. On 20 August, &quot;Little Rock&quot; was joined in Gaeta by Springfield and at 1000, on 22 August, Commander, Sixth Fleet shifted his flag from &quot;Little Rock&quot; to Springfield. The former departed Gaeta for the last time, en route to the ship&#x27;s new homeport at Newport. She embarked 36 dependents for transport to Newport, a trip authorized by the Chief of Naval Operations as a pilot program for possible future endeavors. She arrived at Rota on 27 August, at which time she transferred from U.S. Naval Forces, Europe (USNAVEUR) to Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT) after 44 months of duty as flagship for Commander, Sixth Fleet. After refueling at Rota, the cruiser proceeded on a course of eight days of steady steaming and arrived in Newport on 8 September. She remained in port, until 5 October, during which time, she was given a Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV) (14-18 September) and numerous other inspections in preparation for a shipyard overhaul. On 5 October, &quot;Little Rock&quot; proceeded to Naval Weapons Station, Yorktown (Va.), where she off-loaded all ammunition from 6–8 October. Upon completion, the ship proceeded to Norfolk for a short visit. Afterward, on 10 October, &quot;Little Rock&quot; steamed for Boston, where she arrived on 12 October to commence a much-needed overhaul. She shifted, on 13 November, to Drydock No. 3, South Annex, Boston Naval Shipyard, where she remained through the remainder of the year.

During the major shipyard overhaul, which concluded in April 1971, most of the electronic and operational equipment aboard &quot;Little Rock&quot; was reworked or replaced and the primary new installation was the Anti-Ship Missile Defense (ASMD) System. At the completion of her yard work, &quot;Little Rock&quot; undocked and cleared the Boston Navy Yard, on 19 April and returned to Newport the next day. She remained in port until the 28th, when she got underway for at-sea operations in the operating area off Newport. Returning on the 29th, she remained in port until 3 May. During this time, on 1 May, &quot;Little Rock&quot; was assigned to Commander, Flotilla 10, Commander, Cruiser Destroyer Squadron, Atlantic Fleet (ComCruDesLant). Underway on 4 May, she conducted training on the operation of the ASMD system in the Newport area until the 6th, then steamed south to Yorktown, for ammunition load-out, continuing AASMD training en route. After taking on her ammunition on 10–11 May, she shifted to Norfolk (12-16 May) to conduct NGFS, mine warfare, and ASW training at the Fleet Training Center facilities. She got underway on 17 May and conducted additional training in the Virginia Capes Operating Area on AAW, seamanship and ASMD. With her training completed on 20 May, she steamed north to Newport. Arriving on 21 May, she remained in port until June.

&quot;Little Rock&quot; steamed out of Newport on 11 June, for a ten-week refresher-training period in the Caribbean. During that time, her administrative organization was changed on 1 July 1971, to the Cruiser Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet. During her Caribbean deployment she made port visits and conducted training at Guantanamo Bay, Roosevelt Roads, P.R., Culebra, P.R., and St. Thomas, having fired her NGFS qualification at Culebra, on 16 August, the cruiser steamed back to Newport, arriving on 20 August. While in port, extensive habitability improvements were made to the ship. Departing on 22 September, en route to Yorktown, she loaded ammunition at Yorktown (23-25 September), before setting her course for the Caribbean and four weeks of operations and weapons training off Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. With her training completed, she returned to Yorktown on 22 October, to conduct missile transfer and departed that same day, for a return to Newport. Arriving on 23 October, she remained in port through November. She sortied on 1 December, bound for another Sixth Fleet deployment. Crossing the Atlantic with the carrier John F. Kennedy (CVA-67), the fast replenishment ship Seattle (AOE-3), and the ships of DesRon2, the ships conducted extensive seamanship and tactical drills during the crossing and after touching at Rota on 9 December, she was transferred to the operational control of the Sixth Fleet and returned to the Mediterranean. During ASW exercises while en route to Naples, on 12 December, &quot;Little Rock&quot; received congratulations from ComSixthFlt for her sonar proficiency. Arriving at Naples, on 16 December, she was assigned to TG 60.2. She spent the Christmas holiday in port at Naples, then got underway on the 26th, bound for a port visit to Malaga (29 December) and then to at-sea special operations to year&#x27;s end.

At the start of 1972, &quot;Little Rock&quot; was underway conducting special operations in the western Mediterranean until 11 January. Afterward, she visited Livorno, Italy (12-17 January), then steamed to conduct operations with TG 60.2 in the Ionian Sea (18-26 January). She then anchored at Phaleron Bay, Athens (27 January-3 February) before getting underway on 4 February to participate in National Week XII through the 8th. Anchoring in Augusta Bay, Sicily, Italy, on 9 February, she steamed to Trieste for a port visit (12-16 February). Getting underway again on 17 February, she steamed to the Ionian Sea and conducted operations with TG 60.2 to 23 February, and then anchored at Phaleron Bay (24 February-8 March). Returning to sea, she conducted operations in the Aegean Sea (11-13 March), before making a port visit to Thessaloniki, Greece (14-17 March). Weighing anchor and getting underway on 18 March, she steamed independently in the eastern Mediterranean until the 23rd, and then returned to Phaleron Bay, where she anchored until 3 April. Departing on the 4th, &quot;Little Rock&quot; operated in the Tyrrhenian Sea until 9 April. Involved in the Operation Rivets training exercise on 10 April, she received orders cutting short her Mediterranean deployment. She was being recalled to the U.S. to relieve Newport News (CA-148), which had been ordered to Vietnam. Steaming independently for a return home, she refueled at Rota, on 15 April, then continued across the Atlantic. &quot;Little Rock&quot; moored at Norfolk on 23 April, and on the same day Vice Adm. Vincent P. de Poix, Commander, Second Fleet, embarked and broke his flag on board. The cruiser departed the next day and steamed to Newport (25 April-1 May), before returning to Norfolk on 4 May. The flagship resumed operations on 15 May to participate in Operation Exotic Dancer V. Upon the exercise&#x27;s completion on 22 May, she steamed to Yorktown, to conduct her ammunition load-out (23 May) and shifted to Norfolk. She was soon underway again on 25 May, steaming north for a return to Newport. Arriving on 26 May, she conducted a post-deployment stand-down and remained in port until 20 June.

&quot;Little Rock&quot; resumed operations underway on 21 June 1972, when she set a course for New York for a port visit (23-25 June), en route to an ammunition load-out at Yorktown (27 June), and an in port period at Norfolk into July. Vice Adm. Douglas C. Plate relieved Vice Adm. de Poix, as ComSecondFlt on 19 July, and the next day, the cruiser was underway en route to Newport, where she stood in port from 21 July-9 August. Clearing Newport on 1 August, she steamed south to Norfolk, where she arrived on the 10th, and remained in port until 16 August. After independent steaming exercises on 17–18 August, she returned to Norfolk, and prepared for a deployment to European waters. Departing on 24 August, she crossed the Atlantic and raised Liverpool, England, on 1 September. She remained there until 3 September, when she departed for port visits to Cherbourg, France (5-7 September) and Rotterdam, Netherlands (9-11 September), prior to participating in Exercise Strong Express (14-28 September). With the completion of the exercise, she entered the harbor at Rosyth, Scotland, on 30 September, and conducted a port visit to 4 October. She then continued her itinerary of calls at European ports with visits to Bergen, Norway (5-8 October), Hamburg, West Germany [Germany] (10-13 October), and Lisbon (15-19 October). Clearing the Portuguese capital, &quot;Little Rock&quot; steamed back across the Atlantic and arrived at Norfolk on 25 October, where she remained in port until the 31st. En route to Newport, she arrived the next day and remained in port until 13 November. She then got underway bound for Yorktown and an ammunition load out (15 November), before she steamed back northward. Arriving at Melville, R.I., on 16 November, she shifted to Newport, the next day and remained there until 6 December. Getting underway, she steamed to the Boston Navy Yard, and docked for a restricted availability through the end of the year.

&quot;Little Rock&quot; began 1973 at the Boston Naval Shipyard for conversion to the Navy Distillate Fuel System and installation of satellite communication equipment, as well as other yard work. She completed her maintenance period and undocked on 13 May. Departing the next day, she shifted to Newport, where she underwent preparation for overseas deployment to 10 August. She steamed to Yorktown, on 11 August, and conducted her ammunition on-load (13-14 August). Having shifted to Norfolk, she steamed through the Virginia capes during the afternoon on 15 August, bound for a return to the Sixth Fleet. Touching at Rota, on 26 August, she arrived at Gaeta, on the 29th, and relieved Springfield as flagship two days later. The ship&#x27;s initial visit as flagship was to Athens (13-18 September) before shifting to Antalya, Turkey, for an Operation Deep Furrow 73 pre-exercise brief. Departing on the 19th, she participated in Deep Furrow 73 (20-29 September) before arriving at Istanbul, for a port visit (30 September-5 October). Having passed through the Dardanelles en route to Gaeta, she received orders on 6 October, directing her to join TF 60 for special operations stemming from the Arab countries&#x27; attack on Israel (Yom Kippur/Ramadan War). With the unexpected outbreak of the war, &quot;Little Rock&quot; answered the call for an accelerated condition of combat readiness. She sailed in eastern Mediterranean waters throughout the Arab-Israeli conflict as a deterrent against possible outside intervention, as well as to provide evacuation assistance to U.S. citizens in the endangered area. She continued in this capacity until 4 November, when she detached from TF 60 and steamed to Gaeta, arriving on the 6th. Departing two days later, she rejoined TF 60 (9-17 November) before returning to Gaeta, on 17 November. She steamed to Tunis on 5 December, and arriving the next day she became the first American ship to visit an Arab port since the outbreak of the war.
&quot;Little Rock&quot; participated with units of TF 60, TF 63, TF 69, and TF 67 in National Week XVI (15-20 February 1974), a Sixth Fleet exercise which evaluated the fleet&#x27;s capability to locate and track units of potentially hostile forces in the Mediterranean. After returning to Gaeta (22-26 February), she called at Palma (28 February-3 March), before participating in PHIBLEX 9-74 (5-7 March) at Porto Scudo. The exercise involved an opposed amphibious transit supported by carrier striking forces, surface and submarine photo reconnaissance of the amphibious objective area, mine sweeping, and underwater demolition team (UDT) operations. The landing assault phase included naval gunfire support and close air support followed by troop maneuvers ashore. Afterward, she returned to Gaeta (8 March-19 April) before getting underway to conduct a Missilex (21-23 April) at Namfi, Greece, before moving on to Mykonos, Greece (28 April-1 May). The cruiser then got underway to participate in Dawn Patrol (3-8 May), the major NATO exercise which included AAW, ASW, and anti-surface raider training, with an opposed transit that culminated in an amphibious assault. After returning to Gaeta (9-20 May), &quot;Little Rock&quot; visited Split, Yugoslavia [Croatia] (23-26 May) and Corfu, Greece (28-31 May), then conducted training at Souda Bay (2-3 June) before participating in International Week II (4-9 June) with allied forces for combined training. The cruiser had time in port at Gaeta (11-24 June), then moved to Villefranche (27-30 June) and Toulon (1-4 July) for port visits, before returning to her homeport on 6 July. With the outbreak of the Cyprus Crisis between Greece and Turkey, the flagship conducted special operations in the eastern Mediterranean (15-22 July). En route to a return home, she visited Alexandria, Egypt (29 July-1 August), and raised Gaeta, on 4 August. She got underway and conducted additional operations in response to the Cyprus Crisis (15-22 August), before returning to Gaeta and remaining in port (23 August-17 September), with a routine rest of the year.

&quot;Little Rock&quot; was in port on New Year&#x27;s Day 1975, and remained there until 15 January, when she shifted to Palermo, Italy (16-19 January) before beginning her annual western Mediterranean cruise. She got underway only once before June, to conduct a second Missilex at Salto DiGuirra (22-23 April). &quot;Little Rock&quot; designation was changed to CG-4 on 1 July, in accordance with a navy-wide re-classification of all naval vessels. Departing on 4 July, the cruiser was at Port Said, Egypt the next day, and was the only U.S. vessel present at the re-opening of the Suez Canal, after Sixth Fleet ships had cleared the canal of mines and debris from the 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli wars. She transited through the canal and arrived at Ismailia, Egypt, the next day. From the canal she visited Alexandria (7-9 July), then proceeded to Dubrovnik (12-14 July), before participating in Dawn Patrol with TG 60.2 and TF 61. From 17 to 19 June, she was in training at the anchorage at Taranto, then on 23 June, she was at the training anchorage at Porto Scudo. At the conclusion of the exercise, she returned to Gaeta, where she remained until 7 August, getting underway for National Week XVIII to train with units of TG 60.1 and TG 60.2 (10-14 August). &quot;Little Rock&quot; returned to Gaeta, on 16 August, where she remained in port into September, but for a visit to Rota (28-31 August). She underwent a tender availability at Naples, from 10 September through 18 October, then steamed to Rota (22-25 October), before returning to her homeport on 28 October. While at Gaeta, she underwent INSURV and then got underway for a third Missilex, this time at Namfi (13-14 November). She made her return to Gaeta, via Izmir (17-20 November), arriving on 22 November. The cruiser spent most of December in port, with the exception of her participation in PHIBLEX 6-76, with units from TG 60.1 and TF 61 (17-22 December).

====Final year in service====
&quot;Little Rock&quot; resumed operations underway on 16 January 1976, when she cleared Gaeta, bound for Casablanca (20-23 January) and Villefranche (27-30 January). Returning to Gaeta (31 January-2 February), she shifted to Naples on 2 February and underwent a tender availability until the 21st. After a time at her home port (21 February-1 March), the cruiser made the first port visit to Athens (3-6 March) since the 1973 Cyprus Crisis. Upon leaving Athens, she participated in National Week XX (10-15 March), which saw &quot;Little Rock&quot; at the center of the tight circular formation maneuvering with the other ships of the Sixth Fleet. The ships then proceeded into port at Gaeta, and dropped anchor, then engaged in commemorative events for the U.S. Bicentennial.

She remained in port into April and then got underway on 3 April 1976, to visit Toulon (5-9 April), conducting training en route. She returned to Gaeta (10-25 April), and then participated in Exercise Dixie Jargon (25-27 April), in the western Mediterranean. After time in port at Gaeta (27-30 April), she was underway en route to the eastern Mediterranean to participate in Dawn Patrol 1976, when she experienced an engineering casualty, causing her spend time at Naples (2-7 May) undergoing repairs. At the completion of that work, she was underway, returning to the eastern Mediterranean for Dawn Patrol (7-13 May), before returning to Gaeta, on the 13th. Departing on 5 June, she steamed to Dubrovnik, and conducted a port visit (8-13 June) and then she conducted a dependents&#x27; cruise to Bari, Italy (13-16 June). Afterward, she was involved in extended operations off the coast of Lebanon, Operation Fluid Drive (17-25 June), directing the evacuation of U.S. civilians and foreign nationals from Beirut, during the Lebanese Civil War. Touching at Catania, Italy (25-26 June), she returned to Gaeta, on 27 June. &quot;Little Rock&quot; was relieved by Albany as Sixth Fleet flagship effective 1 July 1976, and departing three days later, she steamed to sea for training and a visit to Cannes (6-7 July), returning to Gaeta, later on the 7th. Getting underway on 13 July, she conducted on last Missilex in the eastern Mediterranean (15-16 July). Returning to her homeport (19-21 July), she returned to the eastern Mediterranean for additional operations as part of Fluid Drive (22-29 July). She returned to Gaeta, and remained there until 19 August. During this time in port, on 1 August, she received orders changing her homeport to the Philadelphia Navy Yard. After a visit to Augusta Bay (21-22 August), she conducted operations as part of National Week XXI (23-27 August), then returned to Gaeta, for the final time. While in port, ComSixthFlt shifted his flag to Albany on 7 September.

====Decommissioning and award====
Departing Gaeta on 9 September, &quot;Little Rock&quot; steamed out of the Mediterranean past Gibraltar and into the Atlantic. Arriving at Lisbon (13-16 September), she conducted one last port visit. Clearing the Portuguese capital on 16 September, she steamed westward for her return to the United States. Arriving at Naval Weapons Station, Yorktown, on 25 September, she berthed and off-loaded her ordnance. She returned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, on 1 October, and began preparations for decommissioning.

&quot;Little Rock&quot; (CLG-4) was awarded the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for her service during the period 20–26 January 1962, and the Navy &quot;E&quot; for the period 1 July 1974 – 30 June 1975.

===Museum ship (1979-present)===
Decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 22 November 1976, &quot;Little Rock&quot; was donated to the Buffalo Naval and Servicemen&#x27;s Park, later renamed the Buffalo and Erie County Naval and Military Park, in Buffalo, N.Y., to serve as a museum ship. She was towed from Philadelphia, via the St. Lawrence Seaway, to Buffalo, and arrived in July 1977.

She is currently open to the public at the Buffalo Naval &amp; Military Park. On 16 December 2017, &quot;Little Rock&quot; was present for the commissioning of , the first time a U.S. Navy ship commissioned alongside her namesake.

<text>EM gauge (named after the track gauge of a nominal Eighteen Millimetres) is a variant of 4 mm to a foot (1:76) scale used in model railways.

EM was developed because OO gauge, favoured by manufacturers of British prototype models, utilised track that was too narrow. OO was developed in the UK in the 1930s as a response to manufacturers finding they were unable to fit the motors of the time into British prototype small boilered locomotives when scaled at the globally popular HO scale&#x27;s 3.5 mm to a foot (1:87). As the scale was increased to 4 mm to the foot to make the locomotives larger, the track gauge was left at , and hence is too narrow (by a scale ) to correctly depict the prototype&#x27;s track gauge of .

EM gauge was founded in the 1950s, originally with gauge track and rolling stock wheelsets based upon the crude and massively out-of-scale products of the contemporary OO model manufacturers. 

18 mm gauge was still undersize by almost a millimetre. With the limitations of modelling at this time, particularly the width of tyres, the largest gauge that could fit within the outline of a scale model would be 18.5 mm, no larger. This was mostly an issue for steam locomotives, where the popular technique at the time of making connecting and coupling rods from rail required an excessive spacing between wheel faces and the cylinders. 

Attempts to make finer tyre and flange standards were thwarted initially by the overscale rail sections available commercially, it being impractical for an individual modeller to make smaller rails – although some did attempt to, by cutting down commercial rail. Smaller flange and tyre dimensions were also unsuccessful, as the narrow tyres tended to detach from the wheel centres. More critically, small flanges required comparably smaller rail, trackwork gaps and point frogs in order to work reliably.

Wheelset standards did become more fine in time, allowing EM to evolve into gauge track (for a while called EEM gauge until it was adopted into the mainstream standard). Some modellers were still not happy with this, it is still a scale too narrow, and developed the P4 standards ( gauge).

Most EM modellers will have started off using OO gauge and having acquired the necessary modelling skills, then advanced into EM. Modellers in EM typically re-wheel their rolling stock and hand-build their trackwork, although pre-built track is available from specialist suppliers. There are also many 4 mm scale kits which can be used by all 4 mm scale gauges, and since the advanced skills, advanced kitbuilding and scratchbuilding are also common.

EM standards are set by the EM Gauge Society, defining gauge and wheel dimensions to ensure compatibility across layouts.

<text>Lucienne Boyer (18 August 1901 – 6 December 1983) was a French diseuse and singer, best known for her song &quot;Parlez-moi d&#x27;amour&quot;. Her impresario was Bruno Coquatrix. According to the New York Times, she &quot;reigned as queen of Paris nightlife during the 1930s&quot;.

==Early career==
She was born Émilienne-Henriette Boyer in Montparnasse, Paris, France. Her melodious voice gave her the chance to begin singing in cabarets at age 16, while also working as a part-time model. An office position at a prominent Parisian theater opened the door for her and within a few years, under the name Lucienne Boyer, she began singing in major Parisian music halls.

==Popular success==

In 1927, Boyer sang at a concert featuring Félix Mayol, where she was seen by the American impresario Lee Shubert, who immediately offered her a contract to work on Broadway. Boyer spent nine months in New York City, returning to perform there and to South America numerous times throughout the 1930s.

By 1933, she had made a large number of recordings for Columbia Records of France, including her signature song, &quot;Parlez-moi d&#x27;amour&quot; (Speak to Me of Love). Written by Jean Lenoir, the song won the first-ever Grand Prix du Disque of the Charles Cros Academy.

==Personal life==
Boyer&#x27;s father died while he served as a soldier in World War I. Due to the loss, she worked in a munitions factory to provide for her family.

In 1939, she married the cabaret singer Jacques Pills of the musical duo Pills et Tabet. Their daughter, Jacqueline, was born on 23 April 1941. Following in their footsteps, Jacqueline became a singer who went on to win the Eurovision Song Contest in 1960.

Throughout World War II, Boyer continued to perform in France, but for her Jewish husband, it was a very difficult time. Following the Allied Forces liberation of France, her cabaret career flourished and for another thirty years, she maintained a loyal following. At the age of 73, she sang with her daughter at the famous Paris Olympia and appeared on several French television shows. 

==Death==
She died in Paris in 1983 and was interred in the Cimetière de Bagneux in Montrouge.

==History==
The building is named after the Empress Hall which formerly stood on the site, and in tribute to the Empire State Building. It was completed in 1962 for the Admiralty on the site of the former Empress Hall and ice rink as a commercial building and was tall with 28 floors, designed by Stone, Toms &amp; Partners and was briefly the tallest commercial building in London until Millbank Tower was built in 1962. It was renovated in 2003 to a design by Wilkinson Eyre Architects. Three floors and were added to its height. Plus a frontal extension of 5 meters &#x27;Orbit&#x27; is the name given to the private revolving bar on the top floor which offers panoramic views of London.The revolving bar element was shut down

This building was originally designed as a hotel but was first used by the Admiralty and GCHQ. The Directorate of Naval Shore Telecommunications (formerly the Naval Shore Telecommunications Authority) had their national headquarters in the building in the 1980s and 90, as did the Directorate of Fleet Supply Duties.

== Metropolitan Police offices ==
The building is occupied by staff from the Metropolitan Police Service who refer to it as ESB. Among other things, until 2020 the building was home to the assessment centre for prospective police officers. Some of the upper floors were occupied by staff from Transport for London until 2010. An annexe at the entrance to the site housed the Metropolitan Police Heritage Centre until January 2020.

In March 2018 the London mayor&#x27;s office agreed to buy the ESB estate for its MPS operations from Capco Plc, the developer of the adjacent Earl&#x27;s Court regeneration scheme, for £250 million to house a new Counter Terrorism Operations Centre. Funding for that project was confirmed in November 2020, from 23rd December 2024 the building is designated as a Prohibited Place under The National Security Act 2023, it is expected to re-open in that role by late 2025.

On 15 October 2019 the building received a certificate of immunity from listing by the then Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Nicky Morgan, which expired on 14 October 2024.

<text>Protofour or P4 is a set of standards for model railways allowing construction of models to a scale of 4 mm to (1:76.2), the predominant scale of model railways of the British prototype. For historical reasons almost all manufacturers of British prototype models use 00 gauge (1:76.2 models running on gauge track). There are several finescale standards which have been developed to enable more accurate models than 00, and P4 is the most accurate in common use.

The P4 standards specify a scale model track gauge of for standard gauge railways. Joe Brook Smith was the first to propose use of an exact scale track gauge in July 1964, when also the term &quot;Protofour&quot; was invented by Malcolm Cross. The standards were later published in &quot;Model Railway News&quot; by the Model Railway Study Group in August 1966.

Just as in the prototype railway, on a model the wheel-rail interface is the fundamental aspect of reliable operation. So as well as a track gauge, P4 also specifies the wheel profile and track parameters to use, which are largely a scaled-down version of real-life standards with some allowances for practical manufacturing tolerances.

P4 standards have been extended to several other prototypes. Broader than standard gauges have been modelled using P4 standards, including Brunel&#x27;s gauge, modelled with track and Irish P4, the Irish broad gauge modelled in P4 in 4 mm scale with gauge track. Several successful models of narrow gauge prototypes with a correspondingly accurate track gauges have also been produced to P4 standards.

P4 standards are promoted worldwide by the Scalefour Society, which is based in the United Kingdom. The EM Gauge Society also provides support for modelling to P4 standards: many P4 modellers belong to both societies. The standards document is hosted by the Scalefour Society and the society&#x27;s Central London Area Group (CLAG) make a HTML version available.

== S4 Standard ==
The S4 Standard is maintained as part of the P4 standards. The S4 Standard removes an allowance in the P4 standards for the tight (compared to the prototype) curves used on model railways. The wheel back to back in S4 is therefore slightly wider than P4, and the related track work dimensions are dead-scale.

<text>The third USS &quot;Los Angeles&quot; (CA-135) was a , laid down by the Philadelphia Navy Yard, Philadelphia, on 28 July 1943 and launched on 20 August 1944. She was sponsored by Mrs. Fletcher Bowron and commissioned on 22 July 1945, with Captain John A. Snackenberg in command.

==Service history==

===1944–1948===
After a shakedown cruise out of Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, &quot;Los Angeles&quot; sailed on 15 October for the Far East via the west coast and arrived at Shanghai, China, on 3 January 1946. During the next year she operated with the 7th Fleet along the coast of China and in the western Pacific to the Marianas. She returned to San Francisco, California, on 21 January 1947, and was decommissioned at Hunters Point on 9 April 1948, and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

===1951–1953===
&quot;Los Angeles&quot; was recommissioned on 27 January 1951, Capt. Robert N. McFarlane in command. In response to the American efforts in the Korean War, she sailed for the Far East 14 May and joined naval operations off the eastern coast of Korea on 31 May as flagship for Rear Admiral Arleigh A. Burke&#x27;s CRUDIV 5. During the next six months she ranged the coastal waters of the Korean Peninsula from Hungnam in the east to Haeju in the west while her guns pounded enemy coastal positions. After returning to the United States on 17 December for overhaul and training, she made her second deployment to Korean waters on 9 October 1952 and participated on 11 October in a concentrated shelling of enemy bunkers and observation points at Koji-ni. During the next few months, she continued to provide off-shore gunfire support for American ground operations, and cruised the Sea of Japan with fast carriers of the 7th Fleet. While participating in the bombardment of Wonsan late in March and early in April 1953, she received minor damage from enemy shore batteries, but continued operations until sailing for the west coast in mid-April. She arrived at Long Beach on 15 May.

===1953–1963===
Between November 1953 and June 1963 &quot;Los Angeles&quot; made eight more deployments to the Far East where she served as a cruiser division flagship with the 7th Fleet in support of &quot;keeping the peace&quot; operations in that troubled part of the world. Her operations sent her from the coast of Japan to the Sea of Japan, the Yellow Sea, and the East and South China Seas; and with units of the 7th Fleet she steamed to American bases in the Philippines and Okinawa, as well as to Allied bases in South Korea, Hong Kong, Australia, and Taiwan. During the Quemoy-Matsu crisis in 1956, she patrolled the Taiwan Strait to help protect ROC Army units from possible landing offenses from Communist China. When not deployed in the western Pacific, &quot;Los Angeles&quot; operated out of Long Beach along the west coast and in the Pacific to the Hawaiian Islands. She returned to Long Beach from her final Far East deployment on 20 June 1963.

==Decommissioning and sale==
While some consideration was made to convert &quot;Los Angeles&quot; into a single-end Talos missile cruiser, with flagship facilities (in essence a heavy cruiser version of the &quot;Oklahoma City&quot;) funds were not appropriated for this or for a general overhaul to enable her continued fleet service, so she was decommissioned at Long Beach on 15 November 1963 and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Diego. Stricken on 1 January 1974, and sold on 16 May 1975 (sale #16-5049) to the National Steel Corporation for $1,864,380.21, and scrapped in San Pedro, California.

The flying bridge and a small portion of the bow section of the Los Angeles is on display at the Los Angeles Maritime Museum in San Pedro, CA.

==In popular culture==
* An event to promote the July 1943 bond drive to finance the ship was held at the Hollywood Bowl on June 30, 1943. A recording of the event is available to stream on archive.org.
* USS &quot;Los Angeles&quot; was featured in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; comic &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot; by Hergé. She is shown patrolling in the Red Sea and is involved in the rescue of Tintin and his friends from a post-war Type II U-boat operated by slave traders.
* In a scene (approximately 47:40–53:00) from the 1977 film &quot;MacArthur&quot; depicting a Pearl Harbor shipboard strategy meeting between President Roosevelt, Nimitz, and MacArthur, a painting of the USS &quot;Los Angeles&quot; is clearly seen on the bulkhead.

<text>The Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) is an inter-regional supportive network of independent emergency units throughout the Caribbean region. Formed on September 1, 2005, as the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA), it underwent a name change to CDEMA in September 2009.

== Members ==
The participating member states and agencies of the CDEMA include:

== Activities ==
The stated role of the CDEMA is to coordinate disaster response to member countries. CDEMA personnel worked in Grenada and Jamaica in early September 2004 after the passage of Hurricane Ivan.

During the mid-1990s, CDEMA provided disaster support for the eruption of the Soufriere Hills volcano in Montserrat. The CDEMA also regularly monitors the Soufriere Hills volcano, in addition to the active undersea volcano named Kick &#x27;em Jenny, to the north of Grenada. Members of the Regional Security System have also requested military and logistical assistance through the agency after natural disasters.

== Background ==
The Pan-Caribbean Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Project (PCDPPP) was established in July 1984 to minimize the damage caused by severe weather conditions in the Caribbean region and the Gulf of Mexico. Prior to the establishment of the PCDPPP, disasters in the area were addressed by private donors.
The PCDPPP was a collection of international sponsors such as the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Canadian International Development Agency, the Government of the Netherlands, and the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization (UNDRO). The PCDPPP failed to break the Caribbean&#x27;s direct and indirect dependence on Europe and the United States. Ultimately, the PCDPPP failed to achieve full participation from Caribbean countries.

In 1989, after the widespread destruction of Hurricane Hugo, there was a focus on creating more effective natural disaster management and preparedness. In 1991, the Caribbean Disaster and Emergency Response Agency (CDERA) was created. CDERA was formed by 16 participating Caribbean nations. With this organization, Caribbean countries had regional support along with international support. This increased the probability of aid coming from regional sources. CDERA would later change its name to CDEMA, the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency.

== History ==

In 1989, Hurricane Hugo struck the Caribbean. Relief still relied on foreign aid from countries such as the United States. By 1990, the insurance companies were criticizing the PCDPPP and how it was necessary to revise the way in which the Caribbean responded to natural disasters. The construction industry, in particular, was criticized for not enforcing enough standards to ensure that structures could withstand disasters in the Caribbean. In 1991, the PCDPPP ceased to exist, and for about a month, the insurance agencies in the region were looking for a replacement. The Caribbean region met the deadline of June 1, 1991. Funding for disaster relief in the Caribbean has been an issue. In September 1991, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) was finally able to take the initiative and set up CDERA.

The growth of CDERA is said to have been very slow throughout the 1990s. In 2003, studies showed that the Caribbean Metrological organization based in Trinidad and Tobago, had developed earlier warning systems in the Caribbean that were saving lives. There was still controversy over whether the people had confidence in this system.

In 2005, CDERA was planning to better coordinate with the tourism industry by preparing a response strategy for natural or man-made disasters. CDERA was also formulating plans to better train their employees and improve the spread of information. The Caribbean Tourism Organization (CTO) claimed the current system CDERA was using needed to become more integrated to avoid a &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; effect occurring. Also, later that year, CDERA coordinator Jeremy Collymore started putting pressure on the individual countries of the Caribbean Union to become more self-sustainable in case of an emergency, while aid from Japan was used to help develop the community&#x27;s early warning systems and hazard management ability. With the recent tsunamis in Thailand and Somalia, aid was sought from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center to develop earlier tsunami warning systems in the Caribbean. Research was done within the Caribbean, at places such as the University of Puerto Rico and the University of the Virgin Islands.

In 2006, financial aid from the European Commission granted CDERA 3.4 million. CDERA&#x27;s projects are still being funded from outside sources. As of 2010, approximately 90% of funding for CDERA&#x27;s projects comes from international donors. Along with funds being heavily dependent on foreign sources, staffing for CDERA has been a major hurdle. It has been said that some staff members of CDERA lack backgrounds in disaster management, and those in charge are low in the bureaucracy&#x27;s chain of command.

In 2010, CDERA underwent a name change to the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA). They have recently focused on improving results through better connections with policymakers and technical officials.

<text>Southbank Tower (formerly South Bank Tower, and the King&#x27;s Reach Tower until 2013) is a high-rise building in Stamford Street, Southwark, London. It was originally a thirty-storey structure high and was completed in 1972, designed by the architect Richard Seifert and built by John Laing. In recent years, the tower has undergone extensive redevelopment and a height increase.

The tower is similar in design to Tower 42, which was designed by the same architect.

==Previous tenants==
The tower was the headquarters of IPC Media, one of the biggest publishing companies in Europe. In the late 1970s, the tower became part of the mythos surrounding the British comic 2000 AD, published by IPC, and the building was depicted as a disguised spaceship, and home to the &#x27;Nerve Centre&#x27; of its alien editor, Tharg. IPC moved to the Blue Fin Building in nearby Bankside in 2007.

==Redevelopment==
In February 2005 the then owners Capital &amp; Counties Properties applied for planning permission with a design by Make Architects to remodel the tower by extending it to 34 floors along with replacement buildings for the T-shaped building at its base. Permission was granted in July 2005. However no redevelopment took place.

Capital and Counties sold the property to Simon Halabi&#x27;s Buckingham Securities in 2006 for a reported £80m.

As part of their joint venture, CIT and Jadwa Investment purchased the property for £60m in 2010. In July 2011 CIT was awarded planning permission to convert the building to residential use along with additional mixed uses. The redevelopment of the building commenced in January 2013. Six new floors were originally planned to be added to the tower, increasing its height to around . The new tower was to house 173 apartments, with retail units to be built around the base and the existing podium building increased in height and transformed into new office space.

In mid 2013, CIT requested permission to increase the tower&#x27;s height by a further 5 floors (bringing the total to 11) which would bring the tower to . 18 additional apartments would be made available with this increase. The plans were approved by Southwark councillors on 16 July 2013.

In September 2012 the joint venture secured £250m of funding from a consortium of Middle Eastern financial institutions.

In 2015 the building was purchased by Hermes Central London Limited Partnership who commissioned TPBennett llp to carry out a CAT A fit out design for all of the commercial space, to redesign the retail frontages not already completed and to remodel the entrance to the central street and both of the office entrances. These works also incorporated a new 9 storey feature staircase suspended from the side of the tower building. The additional works were completed in 2017.

<doc id="562408" wikidata="Q747130" url="?curid=562408" title="USS Macon (CA-132)">
<text>USS &quot;Macon&quot; (CA-132), a &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class heavy cruiser of the United States Navy, was laid down on 14 June 1943 by the New York Shipbuilding Corp., Camden, New Jersey; launched on 15 October 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Charles F. Bowden, wife of the mayor of Macon, Georgia; and commissioned on 26 August 1945 at Philadelphia, Captain Edward Everett Pare in command.

== 1946 – 1950 ==
&quot;Macon&#x27;s&quot; first fleet assignment was with the 8th Fleet, which she joined soon after her shakedown cruise. Sailing with the fleet for maneuvers in the Caribbean, she departed Norfolk on 19 April 1946, returning to New York City on 7 May. On 4 June &quot;Macon&quot; arrived at Norfolk for duty as a test ship for the operational development force.

Over the next four years the cruiser periodically received experimental equipment in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, conducted tests of the new equipment while she served as an anti-aircraft gunnery schoolship, and training naval reservists off the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. She also participated in a midshipmen summer cruise to Europe in 1948. Her experimental duties continued until 12 April 1950 when she decommissioned and went into reserve at Philadelphia.

== 1950 – 1961 ==

With the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, &quot;Macon&quot; was ordered reactivated. As she had just entered into a decommissioned status in April (3 months earlier) her reactivation went extremely quickly, and in reality consisted of minor repairs, loading a crew, stores, and ammunition. She recommissioned at Philadelphia 16 October 1950, Capt. Victor Dismukes Long in command and, upon completion of refresher training, became the flagship of Cruiser Division 6 in the Atlantic. She patrolled in the eastern Mediterranean during the Suez Crisis of 1956; took part in the International Naval Review celebrating the 350th Anniversary of the foundation of Jamestown, Virginia, 12 June 1957; and participated in the NATO exercise operation &quot;Strikeback&quot;, conducted in the North Sea and Arctic Ocean in September 1957.

Besides these duties, &quot;Macon&quot; continued to receive experimental equipment for testing throughout the period. Having also received missile equipment during January–March 1956, she launched the first Regulus missile from an Atlantic Fleet cruiser on 8 May while anchored off the North Carolina coast, and then continued tests of the missile as she completed her cycle of Atlantic Fleet operations. On the night of 19–20 January 1959, &quot;Macon&quot;, steaming from Cartagena to Marseille, diverted from her course and sped to the aid of burning Italian merchant ship &quot;Maria Amata&quot;. &quot;Macon&quot;″s crew fought the flames, but the ship was soon beyond salvage. &quot;Macon&quot; then carried the merchantman&#x27;s crew to Valencia, Spain.

&quot;Macon&quot; participated in Operation Inland Seas, which was a United States Navy operation to celebrate the completion of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1959. By the end of 1959 &quot;Macon&quot; had conducted six midshipmen summer cruises and had spent the fall and winter season of almost every year with the 6th Fleet.

The following January, &quot;Macon&quot;, carrying the U.S. Navy Band, departed Norfolk for a goodwill cruise to South American ports. While on this tour, 19 members of the band perished in a plane crash en route to perform at a state dinner for Brazilian President Juscelino Kubitschek. With Argentine Naval personnel participating, &quot;Macon&quot;″s crew held memorial services in Buenos Aires Harbor on 28 February. Completing this cruise at Rio de Janeiro on 10 March, &quot;Macon&quot; returned to Boston to resume her cycle of operations with the Atlantic Fleet.

&quot;Macon&quot; was placed out of commission in reserve at Philadelphia on 10 March 1961. Stricken on 1 November 1969, and sold to the Union Minerals and Alloys Corporation, New York City, on 5 July 1973 and scrapped in Port Newark, New Jersey.

<text>Peter Murray James, (born 19 September 1925), known professionally as Pete Murray, is a British radio and television presenter and actor. He is known for his career with the BBC including stints on the Light Programme, Radio 1, Radio 2 and Radio 4. In the 1950s, Murray became one of Britain&#x27;s first pop music television presenters, hosting the rock and roll programme &quot;Six-Five Special&quot; (1957–1958) and appearing as a regular panellist on &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; (1959–1967). He was a recurring presence in the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the Eurovision Song Contest. Murray returned to broadcasting for a Boom Radio special on Boxing Day 2021, over 70 years after his career began. He returned to the station on Boxing Day 2022 where he presented a two-hour show alongside his friend David Hamilton.

==Career==
Murray first joined the English service of Radio Luxembourg in 1949 or 1950 as one of its resident announcers in the Grand Duchy, and remained there until 1956. Back in London, and now calling himself &quot;Pete&quot; rather than &quot;Peter&quot;, he continued to be heard frequently on Radio Luxembourg for many years, introducing recorded sponsored programmes. He also presented popular music on the BBC Light Programme, particularly in the programme &quot;Pete Murray&#x27;s Party&quot; from 1958 to 1961 and co-hosted one of BBC Television&#x27;s earliest pop music programmes, the skiffle-based &quot;Six-Five Special&quot; (1957–1958); other regular presenters were Jo Douglas and Freddie Mills. He was a regular panellist on the same channel&#x27;s &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; (1959–1967). He was the &quot;guest DJ&quot; on several editions of ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot; (1961–1966) and he later hosted &quot;Come Dancing&quot;. He was among the first regular presenters of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; when it began in January 1964. In 1961, he co-starred with Dora Bryan in a TV sitcom about two newly weds entitled &quot;Happily Ever After&quot;.

During the early 1960s, Murray co-hosted the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; Poll Winners&#x27; Concert, annually held at Empire Pool, Wembley, with acts such as the Beatles, Cliff Richard and the Shadows, Joe Brown and the Bruvvers, the Who and many others. These were shown on television. In September 1968, he stood in for Alan Freeman on &quot;Pick of the Pops&quot;, while Freeman was in New York. Murray linked up with him for a look at the American pop scene during the two shows that he did.

Murray hosted the UK heat of the Eurovision Song Contest in 1959 and provided the British commentary for the contest itself on both radio and television in 1959 until 1961 and in 1968 and again in 1972 until 1973 for radio, and television commentary for the 1975 and 1977 contest. He was an occasional compère of variety shows at the London Palladium.

Murray was one of the original BBC Radio 1 disc-jockeys when the station started in 1967. By 1969, he was one of the mainstays of BBC Radio 2, where for over ten years he anchored the two-hour magazine show &quot;Open House&quot; five days a week, heard by 5.5 million listeners. One April Fools&#x27; Day he pretended that the show was being televised. In 1973 and 1976, he was voted BBC Radio Personality of the Year. In 1974, he was featured on the Emerson, Lake and Palmer live album &quot;Welcome Back My Friends to the Show That Never Ends – Ladies and Gentlemen&quot; as the master of ceremonies, at the beginning of the album.

In 1980, Radio 2 moved Murray from weekday to weekend programming. In 1981, he began a move into more serious, speech-only radio with a stint as presenter of &quot;Midweek&quot; on BBC Radio 4. In 1984, he started afresh as a presenter for LBC, a local talk radio station in London. He later won the Variety Club of Great Britain award for his show. He introduced his last programme there on 22 December 2002 and has not broadcast regularly since. In August 2008 he returned as a presenter on an Internet-only station, UK Light Radio.

Murray also worked as an actor. He attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and is a RADA Gold Medallist. On the London stage he co-starred with David Hughes and Edward Woodward in the musical &quot;Scapa!&quot; (1962). During the 1960s, he starred in the British sitcoms &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; (1961-64), opposite Dora Bryan, and &quot;Mum&#x27;s Boys&quot; (1968), opposite Bernard Bresslaw and Irene Handl. He had roles in several films including &quot;Caravan&quot; (1946)&quot;, &quot;Hungry Hill&quot; (1947), My Brother Jonathan&quot; (1948), &quot;Portrait from Life&quot; (1948), &quot;No Highway in the Sky&quot; (1951), &quot;Escort for Hire&quot; (1960), &quot;A Taste of Money&quot; (1960), &quot;Design for Loving&quot; (1962), &quot;The Cool Mikado&quot; (1962), &quot;Simon, Simon&quot; (1970) and &quot;Cool It Carol!&quot; (1970), and played Philippe in &quot;My Friend the Inspector&quot;, a 1961 episode of BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Maigret&quot;. He appeared as himself in several productions including the 1962 British musical comedy &quot;It&#x27;s Trad, Dad!&quot; alongside fellow BBC disc jockeys Alan Freeman and David Jacobs and in &quot;The Writer&quot;, an episode of ATV&#x27;s &quot;Hancock&quot; (1963).

Murray also appeared in pantomime, and guested on many radio and TV panel games. In 1984 and 1985, he was a team captain on the ITV panel game &quot;Vintage Quiz&quot;. In 2015, he appeared as a guest on a chat show on Big Centre TV hosted by his friend and former radio colleague David Hamilton. Murray returned to radio to host a special show for Boom Radio on Boxing Day 2021. In 2022, he appeared in the Channel 5 documentary &quot;TOTP: Secrets &amp; Scandals&quot;. He returned to Boom Radio on Boxing Day 2022 for another show, this time alongside Hamilton.

==Personal life==
Murray was born in Hackney, London on 19 September 1925. He married his first wife, Germain, in Luxembourg, in 1952, but they divorced. He was in a relationship with Valerie Singleton, before marrying Patricia Crabbe, a former barrister. He once broke down on live television after his son, Michael Murray James, who had been a pupil at Wycliffe College, also an actor, committed suicide at the age of 27, and afterwards he gave talks on coping with family tragedy.

Murray is a lifelong teetotaller. In 1983, he appeared as a guest newspaper reviewer on the BBC TV&#x27;s early-morning magazine show &quot;Breakfast Time&quot;. During an outburst, he told viewers how to vote at the upcoming election, saying that &quot;a vote for Labour is a vote for communism. May God have mercy on your soul if you don&#x27;t vote Conservative&quot;. At the end of 1983, the BBC cancelled his radio shows, describing his style of broadcasting as too old-fashioned.

<text>USS &quot;Minneapolis&quot; (CL/CA-36) was a built for the United States Navy before the outbreak of World War II, the second ship named for Minneapolis, Minnesota. She served in the Pacific Theater during World War II.

==Construction==
The &quot;New Orleans&quot;-class cruisers were the last U.S. cruisers built to the specifications and standards of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. Such ships, with a limit of 10,000 tons standard displacement and 8-inch calibre main guns may be referred to as &quot;treaty cruisers.&quot; Originally classified a light cruiser, because of her thin armor, she was reclassified, soon after being laid down, a heavy cruiser, because of her 8-inch guns. The term &quot;heavy cruiser&quot; was not defined until the London Naval Treaty in 1930.

She was laid down on 27 June 1931 by Philadelphia Navy Yard; launched on 6 September 1933; sponsored by Miss Grace L. Newton; and commissioned on 19 May 1934, Captain Gordon W. Haines in command.

== Inter-war period ==
After shakedown in European waters from July–September 1934 and alterations in Philadelphia Navy Yard, the new heavy cruiser departed on 4 April 1935 for the Panama Canal and San Diego, arriving on 18 April to join Cruiser Division 7 (CruDiv 7), Scouting Force. She operated along the west coast, aside from a cruise to the Caribbean early in 1939, until arriving at Pearl Harbor in 1940.

== World War II ==
When Japan attacked her base on 7 December 1941, &quot;Minneapolis&quot; was at sea for gunnery practice about from Pearl Harbor. She immediately took up patrol until late January 1942 when she joined a carrier task force about to raid the Gilberts and Marshalls. While screening on 1 February, she helped turn back an air attack in which three Japanese Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Betty&quot; medium bombers were shot down. She screened the carriers during their successful raids on 20 February and again on 10 March, when they attacked Japanese shipping at Lae and Salamaua, disrupting enemy supply lines to those garrisons.

=== Battle of the Coral Sea ===
&quot;Minneapolis&quot; took part in the Battle of the Coral Sea from 4–8 May 1942, screening &quot;Lexington&quot; through the great air engagement and shooting down three Japanese bombers. She rescued survivors when &quot;Lexington&quot; was lost, part of the price for preserving the vital lines of communication to Australia and New Zealand and stopping further Japanese expansion southward.

=== Battle of Midway ===
The cruiser was also engaged in the second key battle of the early phase of the Pacific War, the Battle of Midway from 3–6 June 1942, again protecting the carrier&#x27;s task force from Japanese air attack.

=== Battle of Tassafaronga ===
After replenishing and repairing at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Minneapolis&quot; sailed to protect the carriers as they covered the landings on Guadalcanal and Tulagi from 7–9 August. Remaining with the carriers, she went to the aid of on 30 August, when the carrier took a torpedo hit, and towed her from the danger area. Through September and October, she supported landings west of Lunga Point and on Funafuti.

As flagship of Task Force 67 (TF 67), she sortied on 29 November to intercept a Japanese destroyer force attempting to reinforce Guadalcanal. At 23:05 the next night, she spotted six Japanese ships, and the Battle of Tassafaronga was opened by her fire. She scored many hits on the destroyer , which sank. However, the gunfire failed to sink &quot;Takanami&quot; before she could fire her torpedoes, and in a twist of revenge two of these torpedoes hit &quot;Minneapolis&quot;, one on the port bow, the other in her number two fireroom, causing loss of power and severe damage; her bow collapsing back to the hawsepipes, her port side badly ruptured, and two firerooms open to the sea. Of the battle, American naval historian Samuel Eliot Morison wrote, &quot;It is a painful truth that the Battle of Tassafaronga was a sharp defeat inflicted on an alert and superior cruiser force by a partially surprised and inferior destroyer force.&quot; Of her crew, 37 were killed in action while 36 were wounded.

The ship was saved however by skillful damage control work and seamanship that kept her afloat and enabled her to reach Tulagi. There, camouflaged with palm fronds and shrubs to protect her from frequent air raids, she was temporarily repaired by her own crew with the help of Seabees of the 27th Naval Construction Battalion stationed on the island, and was able to sail for extensive repairs at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. A new bow was built for her during her transit back to the shipyard and was almost ready to be mated on by the time of her arrival. While there she received a remodeling of her forward bridge and added new radars and numerous 20 mm and 40 mm anti-aircraft guns.

By August 1943, &quot;Minneapolis&quot; was back in the Pacific for 20 months of frontline duty, which would include every major Pacific operation by American forces save Iwo Jima. Her first was the bombardment of Wake on 5 October, then from 20 November to 4 December she joined in the assault and capture of Makin in the Gilberts. In December, she screened a carrier group in the pre-invasion strikes against Kwajalein and Majuro, serving on in the capture of the Marshalls into mid-February 1944. With the carriers blasting the Marianas and the Carolines, &quot;Minneapolis&quot; continued to guard them through raids on the Palaus, Truk, Satawan, Ponape, and other key Japanese bases into April, including a surface action off Truk during Operation Hailstone where she assisted in sinking the destroyer &quot;Maikaze&quot; and the armed trawler &quot;Shonan Maru&quot;. The latter raids were coordinated with the landings at Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura), New Guinea.

=== Battle of the Philippine Sea ===
In May, &quot;Minneapolis&quot; prepared at Majuro for the assaults in the Marianas, firing on Saipan in preinvasion bombardment on 14 June. As word came that a large Japanese force was sailing to attempt a disruption of the operation, &quot;Minneapolis&quot; rejoined TF 58 to screen the carriers during the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19–20 June. As American aviators won another great victory, &quot;Minneapolis&quot; screened the carriers and provided antiaircraft fire. After taking a bomb miss close aboard, her crew again patched her up.

=== Guam ===
From 8 July to 9 August, &quot;Minneapolis&quot; brought her heavy guns to the support of the Marines winning Guam back from the enemy. Firing deep support, night harassing, and call fire, she won grateful praise from General Allen H. Turnage, commanding the 3rd Marine Division: &quot;...a prime factor in the success of this operation...a job well done.&quot; From 6 September to 14 October, she gave similar essential aid to the capture of the Palaus, her operations at the close of that period preparing directly for the assault on Leyte. In the preinvasion bombardment force, she entered Leyte Gulf on 17 October, and she downed five enemy planes during the initial resistance to the assault.

=== Battle of Surigao Strait ===

As the Japanese launched the three-pronged naval attack which would develop into the Battle for Leyte Gulf, &quot;Minneapolis&quot; was assigned on 24 October to Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf&#x27;s bombardment group with other cruisers and older battleships. With them, she deployed across Surigao Strait that night, alert to any sign of contact with the enemy by the plucky PT-boats and destroyers fanned out ahead. As the Japanese ships steamed in column, they ignored the flank attacks of the smaller ships, heading straight for Oldendorf&#x27;s battleline, which opened fire with an enormous coordinated salvo, quickly sinking the Japanese old battleship &quot;Yamashiro&quot;. The battleline, including &quot;Minneapolis&quot;, also crippled the heavy cruiser &quot;Mogami&quot; and the destroyer &quot;Shigure&quot; (the drifting &quot;Mogami&quot; was sunk by aircraft later that day). Admiral Oldendorf, in this Battle of Surigao Strait, had performed the classic maneuver of &quot;crossing the T&quot;, meeting the individual fire of the enemy with his own massed fire.

Continuing to alternate carrier screening and bombardment duties in the Philippines, &quot;Minneapolis&quot; was on the scene for the attack and landings at Lingayen Gulf, Luzon from 4–18 January 1945 and the landings on Bataan and Corregidor from 13–18 February. During March, she was assigned to Task Force 54 (TF 54) for the invasion of Okinawa, off which she arrived for preinvasion bombardment on the 25th. She fired at once on Kerama Retto, seized first in a move to provide a safe haven for ships during the assault on Okinawa proper. When the main invasion began 1 April, &quot;Minneapolis&quot; bombarded the Japanese airfield at Naha, rendering it useless to the enemy, then began call fire as ground forces pinpointed her targets by radio.

After months of such action, her gun barrels were worn so badly as to need replacement, and she prepared to sail on 12 April. Her departure was delayed that day by the largest air attack yet of the Okinawa operation, during which she downed four would-be &quot;kamikazes&quot; and watched three others crash harmlessly into the sea. At nightfall, she sailed for Bremerton, Washington, where she repaired and replaced the linings of her gun barrels. Headed back for more action, she was in Subic Bay, Philippines, at the end of hostilities.

She flew the flag of Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid as he accepted the Japanese surrender of Korea on 9 September, then patrolled the Yellow Sea, covering the landing of Marines at Taku and Qinhuangdao, China. After carrying homeward bound veterans to the west coast, she sailed on 14 January 1946 for the Panama Canal and Philadelphia. Here she was placed in commission, in reserve, on 21 May, and out of commission on 10 February 1947. She was sold for scrapping on 14 August 1959 to Union Metals and Alloys Corp.

== Awards ==
&quot;Minneapolis&quot; received 17 battle stars for World War II service, placing her among the most decorated US ships of World War II.

<text>OO9, often also denoted as 009 or 00-9 and commonly pronounced as Double-Oh Nine, is a model railway scale and gauge combination of 4 mm scale and gauge tracks, which models a prototype track gauge of . It is a common choice in the United Kingdom for the modelling of narrow-gauge railways whose prototype gauges lie approximately between and . The track gauge is used by N gauge model railways, a common commercial scale, which means that a selection of wheels, track, and mechanisms is readily available.

 gauge railways were common in Britain, but the gauge implied by 9 mm at 4 mm scale - - was quite rare - today only the Talyllyn and Corris railways in the UK use this gauge. However at 4 mm/foot scale, the differences to gauge required to correct this are barely perceptible by eye, and the wide use of 9 mm gauge in the modelling community is generally accepted to be an appropriate compromise. For example, the correct gauge for a 2-foot prototype would be 8 mm, but the resulting 1 mm difference from the OO9 standard is usually treated as insignificant by most modellers.

The 009 Society exists to connect modellers, issues a monthly colour newsletter (&quot;009 NEWS&quot;), commissions its own range of kits, and provides a popular second hand resale service.

There is a growing range of commercially available ready to run support for OO9, with a number of manufacturers announcing ranges of products, and small manufacturers making limited runs of models from time to time. 

In November 2012, Peco announced the launch, during 2013, of a range of ready to run 009 coaches and wagons, based on prototypes of the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway. This was followed in the March 2013 edition of Railway Modeller Magazine, by Danish manufacturer Heljan announcing an 009 locomotive based on the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway Manning Wardle 2-6-2Ts. Peco have since released ready to run carriages for the Glyn Valley Tramway (GVT), Ffestiniog Railway slate waggons and other general stock such as V tipper and 4 wheel flat wagons.

In July 2014, Bachmann announced a range of ready to run 009 products, starting with a Baldwin Class 10-12-D locomotive and a number of wagons, primarily used by the British War Department during World War I. To date a range of Baldwin liveries have been released including models representing prototypes from the WHR, Ashover, Snailbeach, GVT and War Department. These have been launched alongside a range of wagons and a &#x27;might have been&#x27; fictional Lynton and Barnstaple Baldwin locomotive named &quot;Sid&quot;. Further Bachmann models representing Quarry Hunslet locomotives, small industrial diesels alongside further coaches and wagons are expected to arrive in the next couple of years after announcements in Bachmann catalogues. In 2015 Bachmann also introduced an OO9 line (marketed as &quot;HO Scale on N-gauge track&quot;) based on the Skarloey Railway from their Thomas and Friends line. As part of their Skarloey line, Bachmann has introduced &quot;Skarloey&quot; and &quot;Rheneas&quot; products based on the Talyllyn Railway&#x27;s two Fletcher, Jennings &amp; Co. locomotives (&quot;Talyllyn&quot; and &quot;Dolgoch&quot; respectively) along with a &quot;Peter Sam&quot; model based on the Talyllyn&#x27;s &quot;Edward Thomas&quot;. A 3rd party industry emerged to offer replacement parts to convert the Bachmann locomotives into their real world inspirations, and Bachmann has announced plans to release modified tooling for a more realistic Talyllyn. 

In late 2019 Peco announced a new joint venture with Japanese manufacturer Kato, together they plan to release models of the Ffestiniog Railway England and Double Fairlie locomotives. Peco are also planning to release Ffestiniog rolling stock including bug boxes, quarrymens coaches and larger bogie &#x27;Bowsider&#x27; coaches.

The modeller can also choose from a wide range of plastic, white metal and etched brass kit manufacturers such as Dundas Models, Meridian Models, Mercian Models, GEM, Rodney Stenning, Worsley works, Light Railway Stores, Nigel Lawton etc. Many of these companies attend narrow gauge focussed exhibitions - a diary of events is available to all on the OO9 society website (link below).

Some modellers also adapt models originally made for OO or utilise scratch building techniques. Many OO9 modellers also use H0e equipment, which although built for 3.5mm scale, not 4mm, is often close enough to work alongside OO9.

Standard H0e &#x27;bemo&#x27; style loop couplings are most often used. A slimmer alternative also with a loop is the Greenwich coupling which is compatible with these standard couplings and can be magnetically operated. Some modellers use chopper couplings or repurpose couplers made originally for other scales such as DG couplings. MicroTrains or Kadee couplings intended for N gauge can also been used.

==Related scales==
Using N gauge 9 mm track to model narrow-gauge prototypes is also popular in HO scale model railways. In Europe, this is known as H0e while in the United States this is called HOn30 or HOn2. As the latter indicates, 9 mm in HO scale is in the theoretical prototype, closer to gauge.

 gauge lines (common in Ireland and the Isle of Man) are generally modelled in 4 mm scale but with gauge track, which is known as OOn3.

<text>99 Bishopsgate is a commercial skyscraper in London. It is located on Bishopsgate, a major thoroughfare in the City of London financial district. The building is tall and has 25 office floors, with a total net lettable floor space of circa . There are a further three plant floors at levels LG, 14 and 27.

The original core and steelwork was completed in 1976. At the time, it had the fastest lifts in Europe, running at up to 6.5 metres per second. The building was occupied solely by HSBC until the organisation moved to 8 Canada Square at Canary Wharf (that building subsequently became known as the HSBC Tower).

99 Bishopsgate was extensively damaged in 1993 by a truck bomb exploded by the Provisional IRA, which also damaged the neighbouring Tower 42.

The building was fully refurbished over a period of 14 months, which resulted in substantially improved cladding and a façade overrun which increased its overall height slightly. Larger, open plan floorplates were also created. It re-opened in mid-1995 as a multi-let office tower and is currently owned (leasehold) by Hammerson and managed by CBRE Group.

CBRE has produced an energy performance certificate (EPC) for 99 Bishopsgate which has resulted in a &#x27;C&#x27; rating for the building. The factors that influenced the rating are the impact of specifying energy efficient plant and equipment during refits and the standard of building-related information made available for the purposes of EPC calculation. Considering the age of the building, a &#x27;C&#x27; rating is considered impressive.

A public right of way exists through the building as part of the City of London &#x27;highwalk&#x27; system, connecting a pedestrian bridge over London Wall to the walkways around Tower 42.

On 31 January 2025, the City of London approved plans for the construction of a new 54-storey tower at the site. Demolition of the current building is planned to commence in 2026.

<text>The Jamie Kennedy Experiment is a half-hour-long American hidden camera/practical joke reality television series that debuted in 2002 and was broadcast on The WB. The host and star of the show is Jamie Kennedy, a comedian who presented a reality TV format which combined hidden camera with sketch comedy. The show was a production of Bahr-Small Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television and Big Ticket Television and ran from January 13, 2002 until April 29, 2004.

==Format==
The show&#x27;s format vaguely resembled that of earlier TV shows like &quot;Candid Camera&quot;.

In the show, Kennedy travelled across the U.S. and found people to participate in his on-camera practical jokes (&quot;experiments&quot;). Usually there was at least one person who was in on the joke and the &quot;mark&quot; or victim of the prank (usually a friend or relative of the accomplice). Kennedy dons one of several disguises and assumed a character of his own creation to be part of the gag, often using a different voice. The mark then finds him/herself in some bizarre, unbelievable situation. When it appeared that the mark has had as much nonsense as he or she could tolerate, Kennedy delivered his punchline: &quot;You&#x27;ve been X&#x27;ed!&quot;

=== Recurring sketches ===
* &quot;Brad &quot;B-Rad&quot; Gluckman&quot; – A skit where Jamie portrayed a stereotypical white rapper, often trying to convince the mark to let him stay at his/her house. The &quot;B-Rad&quot; character was later spun off into a movie, &quot;Malibu&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;. 
* &quot;Pizza Delivery&quot; – A skit where a mark was hired as a pizza delivery boy to a pizza shop run by the mafia.
* &quot;Judge Jamie&quot; – A parody on numerous judge shows, Jamie played the role of James W. Leighland, an old, confused, and incompetent judge, often with perverted tendencies.
* &quot;Jaw Surgery&quot; – A skit where Jamie &quot;X&#x27;es&quot; his marks by pretending to have just had jaw surgery, and had to wear a metal-wire contraption that keeps his mouth open. He played different characters in different skits, but they have all just had the same gag. 
* &quot;Virginia Hamm&quot; – A parody of daytime talk shows, Jamie would undergo an entire transformation and become a heavyset black female talk show host.
* &quot;You Be the Judge&quot; – Another parody on judge shows, a mark was picked to be the judge for an episode, and had to preside over a case with an extremely unusual plaintiff or defendant.
* &quot;Lou Hollander&quot; – A skit where Jamie portrayed a driving school teacher, with the student as his mark, and had to &quot;take a detour&quot; during the lesson due to family/marital issues. Also used during the second season, but with Lou Hollander having a paper route instead.
* &quot;Old Rascal&quot; – A skit where Jamie dressed up as Mario, the world&#x27;s oldest waiter, and the gag on the mark was that Mario was retiring, and he/she would be his last table.

==Syndication==
In September 2004, ABC Family added the series to its lineup. G4 also aired the show in 2006 for a brief period. It has not been seen on TV since. Distribution rights are held by Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution, but they are not currently offering the show to any station.

==Home media==
Paramount Home Media Distribution released all three seasons of &quot;The Jamie Kennedy Experiment&quot; on DVD.

<doc id="562432" wikidata="Q3160773" url="?curid=562432" title="Jamaat al Muslimeen">
<text>The Jammat-al-Muslimeen (, also transliterated as Jamaat-ul Muslimeen or Jama&#x27;at al-Muslimeen, &quot;&quot;School of Muslims&quot;, &quot;Group of Muslims&quot;, &quot;The Muslim Group&quot;, &quot;The Muslim Assembly&quot;, &quot;The Muslim Society&quot;, &quot;The Muslim Community&quot;&quot;) is an Islamist fundamentalist group in Trinidad and Tobago. 

The organisation is responsible for the Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt of July 1990, in which its leader, Imam Yasin Abu Bakr, led members of the Jamaat in an attempted &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; against the unpopular Government of Trinidad and Tobago. Over a six-day period, members of the government, including then-Prime Minister A.N.R. Robinson, were held hostage at gunpoint, while the group occupied a television station and parliament, and chaos and looting broke out in the streets of the capital, Port of Spain.

==Origins==
The movement had its social origins in a widespread presence of black racism and supremacy, the division of community on the basis of race, the illicit drug trade and ideology of extremist jihad. The next step was a development of a militant Islamic discourse which insisted that liberation for especially Afro-Trinidadians and Tobagonians was only found within the ambit of Islam. As a result, a group called Jamaat al Muslimeen (JAM) was founded. With regards to the Trinidadian Muslim communities, it found support among Afro-Trinidadian Muslims, rather than the older group of Indian Muslims who have traditionally been &quot;well-integrated moderates&quot;. The movement initially found inspiration in the Nation of Islam&#x27;s vision of black consciousness, but increasingly moved towards salafism.

On the international stage, JAM received training and support from the Libyan leader Muammar Ghaddafi through the latter&#x27;s .

==Coup attempt==

In July 1990, forty-two insurgents stormed the parliament, taking Prime Minister Arthur Napoleon Raymond (ANR) Robinson and most of his staff hostage. Seventy-two insurgents stormed a local police station, and at 6:00 PM, JAM leader Yasin Abu Bakr told the public the government had been overthrown. During the four-day siege, in which 24 people were killed, JAM agreed to surrender in exchange for amnesty. Abu Bakr and 114 of his followers were granted presidential pardons, which were later retracted, but no JAM members from the coup have ever served jail time in connection with the attack. 

A court ruling upheld an amnesty agreement obtained during the incarceration of parliament by the group. This led to the non-prosecution of its members for this crime despite the contention that the fact that guns and force were used to obtain said amnesty constituted duress. After the attempted coup, it aligned itself publicly first with the United National Congress (in the run-up to the 1995 General Elections) and later with the People&#x27;s National Movement (PNM), the party which formed the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago until May 2010.

==Other crimes==
Before and since those elections, however, present and past members have been connected to or prosecuted for serious violent crimes. These crimes include drug and gang related killings, rape and a spree of kidnappings for ransom of members of the local upper and middle class. The organisation&#x27;s leader is currently being prosecuted for conspiracy to murder several of the group&#x27;s former members who had spoken out publicly against the Jamaat al Muslimeen and its practices, and who were suspected of becoming witnesses in legal proceedings against its members.

In 2005, the group was suspected of being linked to a series of bombings in Port-of-Spain; a group member was arrested in the United States for attempting to ship 70 assault rifles from Fort Lauderdale to Trinidad.

Abu Bakr was investigated in 2007 when the reports of an attempted bombing attempt at John F. Kennedy (JFK) Airport linked JAM to one of the perpetrators, a Trinidadian national. The suspects reportedly asked Abu Bakr for assistance in carrying out this plot. Abu Bakr and JAM deny any connection to the plot.

In 2006, businesswoman Vindra Naipaul-Coolman was kidnapped, raped and murdered. Three JAM members later admitted involvement in the killing.

In 2014, the independent senator Dana Seetahal - who had been involved years earlier as a court prosecutor against JAM - was assassinated. The eleven men who were arrested for the murder in 2015 were all members of a JAM-affiliated mosque in Carapo, Tunapuna–Piarco. During the trial, a Special Branch intelligence memo featuring an unconfirmed report was leaked to social media. The report indicated that law enforcement feared violence from JAM, amid reports the group may have been moving arms in preparation for an attack on police stations. No attack materialised, however.

On 14 July 2015, an armed jailbreak took place in a prison in Port of Spain. Multiple of the escapees were JAM members. One of them, Allan Martin, was a gang member connected to the murder of Naipaul-Coolman, whereas another escapee was the brother of one of the suspects in the Dana Seetahal killing. During a shoot-out, Martin and police officer Sherman Maynard were killed. Abu Bakr was detained for questioning in relation to the incidents. The JAM leadership responded by threatening the government and posing a 24-hour ultimatum to liberate Abu Bakr; he was released before the ultimatum passed. Online conspiracy theories claimed that JAM itself organized the jailbreak, but this was never proven.

Abu Bakr collapsed and died at his home on 21 October 2021 at the age of 80. His successor as imam, Sadiq al Razi (who had participated in the 1990 coup attempt), called for conciliation between the JAM and the rest of the country in 2024; he also announced that the organization would partake in the upcoming Emancipation Day procession.

<text>Patricia Jane Duncan (born April 8, 1960) is a Canadian politician from Yukon. Duncan served as leader of the Yukon Liberal Party from 1998 to 2005 and as the sixth premier of Yukon from 2000 until 2002. Duncan was the first Liberal premier of the Yukon and the first female premier in the Yukon, the second woman in Canadian history to win the premiership of a province or territory through a general election, the first to do so by defeating an incumbent premier, and the first to do so by defeating a male opponent.

Duncan was appointed to the Senate of Canada on December 12, 2018.

==Life before politics==
Duncan was born in Edmonton, Alberta in 1960, and moved with her family to Whitehorse, Yukon in 1964. She graduated from Carleton University with a Bachelor of Arts in political science.

==Professional background==
Prior to entering politics, Duncan was a small business owner. She also served as executive director of the Whitehorse Chamber of Commerce. In the mid-1980s, Duncan served as a special assistant to Progressive Conservative Deputy Prime Minister Erik Nielsen. Duncan remained in this position until Nielsen&#x27;s retirement in 1987.

==Yukon politics==
Duncan was first elected to the Yukon Legislative Assembly in the 1996 general election. Duncan was elected as a Liberal to represent the Porter Creek South riding, a riding located in Whitehorse. In the 1996 general election, Piers McDonald (New Democratic Party) won a majority government. Duncan was one of three Liberals elected. Liberal leader at the time, Ken Taylor, was unsuccessful in winning his Mount Lorne riding.

In 1998, Duncan was elected leader of the Yukon Liberal Party. From 1998-2000, Duncan served as the Leader of the Official Opposition in the legislature. In the 2000 general election Duncan led the Yukon Liberal Party to a majority government, defeating New Democratic incumbent Piers McDonald. The Liberals were elected in 10 ridings and received 42.7% of the popular vote. Early in 2002, the Liberal majority was reduced to a minority after the defection of three Liberal MLAs, Mike McLarnon, Don Roberts and Wayne Jim. The catalyst for the defections was reported to be Duncan&#x27;s allegedly heavy-handed and secretive leadership style.

On October 4, 2002, only two years into Duncan&#x27;s five-year term, she called a general election for November 4, 2002. The rationale for the election was to achieve certainty in the legislature, however many Yukoners were angered at the quick election. The Yukon Liberals were reduced to only one seat after the election - Duncan&#x27;s own riding of Porter Creek South. Yukon Party leader Dennis Fentie, a former NDP MLA, led his new party to victory. The Liberals were reduced to third party status with Duncan as the sole Liberal MLA.

At the 2005 Yukon Liberal Party leadership convention, Duncan was defeated by Arthur Mitchell by a margin of 357 votes to 303. Citing health concerns, she did not seek re-election in the 2006 general election.

<text>Spanish literature is literature (Spanish poetry, prose, and drama) written in the Spanish language within the territory that presently constitutes the Kingdom of Spain. Its development coincides and frequently intersects with that of other literary traditions from regions within the same territory, particularly Catalan literature, Galician intersects as well with Latin, Jewish, and Arabic literary traditions of the Iberian Peninsula. The literature of Spanish America is an important branch of Spanish literature, with its own particular characteristics dating back to the earliest years of Spain’s conquest of the Americas (see Latin American literature).

==Overview==
The Roman conquest and occupation of the Iberian Peninsula beginning in the 3rd century BC brought a Latin culture to Spanish territories. The Muslim conquest in 711 CE brought the cultures of West Asia and the North Africa to the peninsula, creating Andalusi literary traditions. In medieval Spanish literature, the earliest recorded examples of a vernacular Romance-based literature mix Muslim, Jewish, and Christian culture. One of the notable works is the epic poem Cantar de Mio Cid, composed some time between 1140 and 1207. Spanish prose gained popularity in the mid-thirteenth century. Lyric poetry in the Middle Ages includes popular poems and the courtly poetry of the nobles. During the 15th century the pre-Renaissance occurred and literary production increased greatly. In the Renaissance important topics were poetry, religious literature, and prose.

In the 16th century the first Spanish novels appeared, &quot;Lazarillo de Tormes&quot; and &quot;Guzmán de Alfarache&quot;. In the Baroque era of the 17th century important works were the prose of Francisco de Quevedo and Baltasar Gracián. A notable author was Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, famous for his masterpiece &quot;Don Quixote de la Mancha&quot;. In this novel Cervantes consolidated the form of literature that the picaresque novel had established in Spain to a fictional narrative that became the template for many novelists throughout the history of Spanish literature. 

In the Enlightenment era of the 18th century, notable works include the prose of Feijoo, Jovellanos, and Cadalso; the lyric of Juan Meléndez Valdés, Tomás de Iriarte and Félix María Samaniego), and the theater, with Leandro Fernández de Moratín, Ramón de la Cruz, and Vicente García de la Huerta. In Romanticism (beginning of the 19th century) important topics are: the poetry of José de Espronceda and other poets; prose; the theater, with Ángel de Saavedra (Duke of Rivas), José Zorrilla, and other authors. In Realism (end of the 19th century), which is mixed with Naturalism, important topics are the novel, with Juan Valera, José María de Pereda, Benito Pérez Galdós, Emilia Pardo Bazán, Leopoldo Alas (Clarín), Armando Palacio Valdés, and Vicente Blasco Ibáñez; poetry, with Ramón de Campoamor, Gaspar Núñez de Arce, and other poets; the theater, with José Echegaray, Manuel Tamayo y Baus, and other dramatists; and the literary critics, emphasizing Menéndez Pelayo.

In Modernism several currents appear: Parnasianism, Symbolism, Futurism, and Creationism. The destruction of Spain&#x27;s fleet in Cuba by the U.S. in 1898 provoked a crisis in Spain. A group of younger writers, among them Miguel de Unamuno, Pío Baroja, and José Martínez Ruiz (Azorín), made changes to literature&#x27;s form and content. By the year 1914—the year of the outbreak of the First World War and of the publication of the first major work of the generation&#x27;s leading voice, José Ortega y Gasset—a number of slightly younger writers had established their own place within the Spanish cultural field. Leading voices include the poet Juan Ramón Jiménez, the academics and essayists Ramón Menéndez Pidal, Gregorio Marañón, Manuel Azaña, Eugenio d&#x27;Ors, and Ortega y Gasset, and the novelists Gabriel Miró, Ramón Pérez de Ayala, and Ramón Gómez de la Serna. Around 1920 a younger group of writers—mostly poets—began publishing works that from their beginnings revealed the extent to which younger artists were absorbing the literary experimentation of the writers of 1898 and 1914. Poets were closely tied to formal academia. Novelists such as Benjamín Jarnés, Rosa Chacel, Francisco Ayala, and Ramón J. Sender were equally experimental and academic.

The Spanish Civil War had a devastating impact on Spanish writing. Among the handful of civil war poets and writers, Miguel Hernández stands out. During the early dictatorship (1939–1955), literature followed dictator Francisco Franco&#x27;s reactionary vision of a second, Catholic Spanish golden age. By the mid-1950s, just as with the novel, a new generation which had only experienced the Spanish Civil War in childhood was coming of age. By the early 1960s, Spanish authors moved towards a restless literary experimentation. When Franco died in 1975, the important work of establishing democracy had an immediate impact on Spanish letters. Over the next several years a wealth of young new writers, among them Juan José Millás, Rosa Montero, Javier Marías, Luis Mateo Díez, José María Merino, Félix de Azúa, Cristina Fernández Cubas, Enrique Vila-Matas, Carme Riera, and later Antonio Muñoz Molina and Almudena Grandes, would begin carving out a prominent place for themselves within the Spanish cultural field.

==Pre-medieval literature==
The Roman conquest and occupation of the peninsula, spanning from the 3rd century BCE to the 5h century CE, brought a fully developed Latin culture to Spanish territories. While the invasion of Germanic tribes in the fifth century CE put an end to Roman Spain, the tribes’ relative lack of advanced culture, including any kind of literary tradition, meant that any written literature produced in the Iberian Peninsula continued along Romanized lines. Outstanding amongst the works produced is Saint Isidore of Seville’s () &quot;Etymologiae&quot;, an attempted summa of all classical knowledge. Called “the last scholar of the ancient world&quot;, St. Isidore penned theological and proto-scientific treatises, letters, and a series of histories that would serve as models for the rest of Western Europe throughout the Middle Ages.

The arrival of Muslim invaders in 711 CE brought the cultures of the Middle and Far East to the Iberian Peninsula and ultimately to all of Europe. During the era of relative religious tolerance that followed, writers such as the Jewish theologian Maimonides (1135–1204) or the Muslim polymath (1126–1198) Averroes penned works of theology, science, philosophy, and mathematics that would have lasting impacts on Hebrew and Muslim philosophy and prove essential to the flowering of the European Renaissance centuries later. While none of their works can be considered direct ancestors of a Spanish literary tradition, it was out of the cultural milieu fostered by such intellectual energy that the first written manifestations of a Spanish literature proper arise.

==Medieval Spanish literature==
=== Andalusi literature ===

The period of Islamic rule in Iberia from 711 to 1492 brought many new literary traditions to Spain. Most literature at this time was produced in standard Arabic, though poetry and other forms of literature of the Jewish golden age found expression in Judeo-Arabic or Hebrew. Maimonides, for example, wrote his magnum opus &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot; in Arabic with Hebrew script.

Other major literary figures of the time include Ibn Arabi, Al-Mu&#x27;tamid ibn Abbad, Ibn al-Khatib, Ibn Zaydún and Hafsa Bint al-Hajj al-Rukuniyya.

Important literary styles include the muwashah, maqama, and nawba.

Important works include &quot;Al-ʿIqd al-Farīd&quot;, &quot;Hayy ibn Yaqdhan&quot;, &quot;The Incoherence of the Incoherence&quot;, and &quot;Hadith Bayad wa Riyad&quot;.

===The kharjas===

The earliest recorded examples of a vernacular Romance-based literature date from the same time and location, the rich mix of Muslim, Jewish, and Christian cultures in Muslim Spain, in which Maimonides, Averroes, and others worked. The Jarchas, dating from the 9th to the 12th centuries C.E., were short poems spoken in local colloquial Hispano-Romance dialects, known as Mozarabic, but written in Arabic script. The Jarchas appeared at the end of longer poetry written in Arabic or Hebrew known as muwashshah, which were lengthy glosses on the ideas expressed in the jarchas. Typically spoken in the voice of a woman, the jarchas express the anxieties of love, particularly of its loss.

This combination of Hispano-Romance expression with Arabic script, only discovered in 1948, locates the rise of a Spanish literary tradition in the cultural heterogeneity that characterized Medieval Spanish society and politics. However, the Mozarabic language of the Jarchas appears to be a separate Romance language whose evolution from Vulgar Latin paralleled that of Castilian Spanish rather than deriving from or fusing into the latter. Hence, while the relatively recent discovery of the Jarchas challenges pride of chronological place that belonged for so long to the &quot;Poema del Cid&quot; (El Cantar de mío Cid) (1140 CE) in the history of Spanish literature, they cannot be seen as a precursor to Spain&#x27;s great epic poem. What the discovery of the jarchas makes clear instead is that from its origins, the literature of Spain has arisen out of and born witness to a rich, heterogeneous mix of cultures and languages.

===Cantar de Mio Cid===

The epic poem Cantar de Mio Cid was written about a real man—his battles, conquests, and daily life. The poet, name unknown, wrote the epic in about 1140 and Cid supposedly died forty years before in 1099. This epic represents realism, because nothing was exaggerated and the details are very real, even the geography correctly portrays the areas in which Cid traveled and lived. Unlike other European epics, the poem is not idealized and there is no presence of supernatural beings. It has assonance instead of rhyme and its lines vary in length, the most common length being fourteen syllables. This type of verse is known as &quot;mester de juglaria&quot; (verse form of the minstrels). The epic is divided into three parts, also known as cantos.

===Mester de Juglaría===

Medieval Spanish poets recognized the Mester de Juglaría as a literary form written by the minstrels (juglares) and composed of varying line length and use of assonance instead of rhyme. These poems were sung to uneducated audiences, nobles and peasants alike.

===Mester de Clerecía===

This Castilian narrative poetry known as the Mester de Clerecía became popular in the thirteenth century. It is the verse form of the learned poets, usually clerics (hence the name &#x27;clerecía&#x27;). The poetry was formal, with carefully counted syllables in each line. Popular themes were Christian legends, lives of saints and tales from classical antiquity. The poems were recited to villagers in public plazas. Two traits separate this form from the mester de juglaría: didacticism and erudition. Gonzalo de Berceo was one of the greatest advocates of this school, writing on religious subjects.

===Spanish prose===

Spanish prose gained popularity in the mid-thirteenth century when King Alfonso X of Castile gave support and recognition to the writing form. He, with the help of his groups of intellectuals, directed the composition of many prose works including &quot;Las siete partidas,&quot; the first modern book of laws of the land written in the people&#x27;s language. Another work was La primera crónica general which accounted for the history of Spain from the creation until the end of Alfonso&#x27;s father&#x27;s reign, San Fernando. For his direction of these works and many others he directed, Alfonso X is called the father of Spanish prose. His nephew, Don Juan Manuel is famous for his prose work &quot;El Conde Lucanor&quot; which is a frame story or short stories within an overall story. In this work, the Conde Lucanor seeks advice from his wise counselor, Patronio, who gives the advice through the telling of stories. Juan Manuel also wrote lesser-known works such as &quot;El libro de los estados&quot; on the social classes and &quot;El libro del caballero y escudero&quot; on philosophical discussions. Toward the end of the Middle Ages, writer Fernando del Pulgar (1436-1490?) created a new type of prose named the &quot;verbal portrait.&quot; This form is demonstrated by Pulgar&#x27;s work &quot;Claros varones de Castilla&quot; in which he represents the detailed lives of twenty-four distinguished contemporaries. He explores their moral and psychological natures as well as physical traits. Pulgar was the official historian of the monarchs Fernando and Isabel, the famous Catholic Monarchs of Spain. This position gave him close encounters with the characters in this book, making the work realistic and detailed.

===Lyric poetry of the Middle Ages===

Lyric poetry in the Middle Ages can be divided into three groups: the &quot;jarchas,&quot; the popular poems originating from folk-songs sung by commoners, and the courtly poetry of the nobles. Alfonso X of Castile fits into the third group with his series of three hundred poems, written in Galician: &quot;Las cantigas de Santa María.&quot; Another poet, Juan Ruiz, or the Arcipreste de Hita is an outstanding lyricist of the fourteenth century. His only work, &quot;Libro de buen amor&quot; is a framework tale in which he includes translations from Ovid, satires, little poems called &quot;serranillas&quot;, twenty-nine fables, a sermon on Christian armor, and many lyric poems that praise the Virgin Mary. Poet &quot;Íñigo López de Mendoza,&quot; the Marqués de Santillana (1398–1458), begins to show the movement away from the traditions of the Middle Ages. He shows a knowledge of Latin authors and familiarity with the works of Dante and Petrarch. Mendoza was also the first to introduce the sonnet into Spanish literature. The last great poet of the Middle Ages is Jorge Manrique. He is famous for his work which laments the death of his father, Coplas a la muerte de su padre. In this piece, Manrique shows classical feelings by expressing himself in a universal manner (all things come to an end). He is still considered a poet of the Middle Ages in that he finds peace and finality in religion.

==Renaissance==
The 15th century may be thought of as a pre-Renaissance period. Literary production increases greatly. Outstanding poets of this century include Juan de Mena and Íñigo López de Mendoza (Marquess of Santillana). Spanish literature of the Middle Ages concludes with &quot;La Celestina&quot; by Fernando de Rojas.

Important Renaissance themes are poetry, with Garcilaso de la Vega and Juan Boscán; religious literature, with Fray Luis de León, San Juan de la Cruz, and Santa Teresa de Jesús; and prose, with the anonymous &quot;El Lazarillo de Tormes&quot;. Among the principal features of the Renaissance were the revival of learning based on classical sources, the rise of courtly patronage, the development of perspective in painting, and advances in science.
The most important characteristics of the Renaissance are:
* The prevalence of natural, uncomplicated language, avoiding affectation, &quot;amaneramiento&quot; and the over-refined phrase, producing simple vocabulary and straightforward syntax.
* Themes such as love - conceived from the platonic point of view; nature - as somewhat idyllic (bucolic); pagan mythology - concerned with female beauty and the histories of the gods, following always the same classical ideal. In relation to these themes, various Renaissance points exist (???) some of them taken from the classical world:
** &quot;Carpe Diem&quot;, (&quot;seize the day&quot; or &quot;take advantage of the moment&quot;), which recommends the enjoyment of life before the arrival of old age.
** &quot;Collige, virgo, rosas&quot; which literary means &quot;Pick virgin the roses&quot; and is a metaphor similar to &quot; Carpe Diem&quot; but applied to female beauty, described always following the same plan: a young blonde, with serene, clear eyes, white skin, red lips, rosy cheeks, etc.
** The &quot;Beatus Ille&quot; or praise of rural life, away from material things, as opposed to life in the city, with its dangers and intrigues.
** The &quot;Locus Amoenus&quot; or description of nature in all its idyllic perfection.

==Baroque==

In the Baroque of the 17th century important topics are the prose of Francisco de Quevedo and Baltasar Gracián; the theater is notable (Lope de Vega, Pedro Calderón de la Barca, and Tirso de Molina); and poetry with Luis de Góngora (who is a Culteranist) and Francisco de Quevedo (who is a Conceptist). In the works of Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra notable novels are &quot;La Galatea&quot; and &quot;Don Quixote de la Mancha&quot;. The Baroque style used exaggerated motion and clear, easily interpreted detail to produce drama, tension, exuberance, and grandeur in sculpture, painting, literature, dance, and music.

The Baroque is characterized by the following points:
* Pessimism: The Renaissance had not achieved its purpose of imposing harmony and perfection in the world, as the humanists intended, nor had it made man happier; wars and social inequality continued to be present; pain and calamities were commonplace throughout Europe. An intellectual pessimism took hold, which increased as time passed. This was shown by the angry character of the comedies of that epoch, and by rascal characters on which the picaresque novels are based.
* Disillusionment: As the Renaissance ideals failed, and, in the case of Spain, political power was being dispelled, disillusionment continued to arise in literature. Many cases recall those of two centuries before, with the &quot;Danza de la Muerte&quot; or Manrique&#x27;s &quot;Coplas a la muerte de su padre&quot;. Quevedo said that life is formed by &quot;successions of deceased&quot;. Newborns turn into the deceased, and diapers into the shroud that covers lifeless bodies. This leads to the conclusion that nothing is important except obtaining eternal salvation.
* Worry about the passing of time.
* Loss of confidence in the Renaissance ideals.

==Enlightenment==
In the Enlightenment of the 18th century, with the arrival of &quot;the lights&quot; to Spain, important topics are the prose of Fray Benito Jerónimo Feijoo, Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, and José Cadalso; the lyric of the Salmantine school (with Juan Meléndez Valdés), the lyric of the Madrilenian group (with the story-tellers Tomás de Iriarte and Félix María Samaniego), and the lyric of the Sevillian school; and also the theater, with Leandro Fernández de Moratín, Ramón de la Cruz and Vicente García de la Huerta. Enlightenment thinkers sought to apply systematic thinking to all forms of human activity, carrying it to the ethical and governmental spheres in exploration of the individual, society and the state.

Three phases in the Spanish literature of the 18th century are distinguished:
* Anti-Baroquism (until approximately 1750): It fights against the style of the preceding Baroque, which is considered excessively rhetorical and twisted. The recreational literature is not cultivated, but they are more interested in the essay and satire, utilizing the language with simplicity and purity.
* Neoclassicism (until the end of the 18th century): It is strongly influenced by French and Italian classicism. The writers also imitate the old classics (Greek and Roman); its boom extended since the reign of Fernando VI until the end of the century.
* Pre-Romanticism (end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century): The influence of the English philosopher John Locke, together with that of the French Étienne Bonnot of Condillac, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Denis Diderot, will cause a new feeling, dissatisfaction with the tyranny of reason, that emphasizes the right of the individuals to express their personal emotions (repressed then by the neoclassicals), among which figures fundamentally love. This current announces the decline of Neoclassicism and opens the door to Romanticism.

==Romanticism==

Early Romanticism appeared with the singular figure of Manuel José Quintana.

In Romanticism (beginning of the 19th century) important topics are: the poetry of José de Espronceda and other poets; prose, which can have several forms (the historical novel, scientific prose, the description of regional customs, journalism —where Mariano José de Larra can be mentioned—; the theater, with Ángel de Saavedra (Duke of Rivas), José Zorrilla, and other authors. In the latter romanticism (post-romanticism) some appear:Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer and Rosalía de Castro. Some anti-romantic poets are Ramón de Campoamor and Gaspar Núñez de Arce. In part a revolt against aristocratic, social, and political norms of the Enlightenment period and a reaction against the rationalization of nature, in art and literature Romanticism stressed strong emotion as a source of aesthetic experience, placing new emphasis on such emotions as trepidation, horror, and the awe experienced in confronting the sublimity of nature. It elevated folk art, nature and custom.

The characteristics of the works of Romanticism are:
* Rejection of Neoclassicism. Contrary to the scrupulous severity and order with which the rules were observed in the 18th century, the romanticist writers combine the genres and verses of different measures, at times mixing verse and prose; in theater, the rule of the three units (place, space and time) is despised and they alternate comedy with drama.
* Subjectivism. Whatever kind of work it is, the exalted soul of the author pours into it all his feelings of dissatisfaction against a world that limits and breaks the flight of his desire about love, society, patriotism, etc. They do so in such a way that nature fuses with their state of spirit and it is melancholic, tetric, mysterious, dark... as opposed to the neoclassicals, who barely showed interest in the landscape. The longings for passionate love, desire for happiness, and possession of the infinite, cause a discomfort in the romanticist, an immense deception that from time to time carries them to suicide, as is the case of Mariano José de Larra.
* Attraction to the nocturnal and mysterious. The romantics situate their aching and disillusioned feelings in mysterious or melancholic places, such as ruins, forests, cemeteries... Similarly they feel an attraction toward the supernatural, things that escape any logic, such as miracles, apparitions, visions of the afterlife, the diabolic and the witchlike...
* Escape from the world that surrounds them. Rejection of the bourgeois society in which they are forced to live makes the romanticist be evaded from his circumstances, imagining passed epochs in which their ideals prevailed over the others, or being inspired in the exotic. In contrast with the neoclassicals, who admired the Greco-Latin antiquity, the romanticists prefer the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Among their more frequent kinds of works, they cultivate the novel, legend and historic drama.
Various are the themes of the romanticist works:
* Oneself. In Espronceda&#x27;s &quot;Song to Teresa,&quot; a heartwrenching confession of love and disillusion, he has managed to poeticize his feelings with great success.
* Passionate love, with sudden, total deliveries and quick abandonments. Exaltation and distaste.
* They are inspired in legendary and historic themes.
* Religion, although it is often in defiance of the consequent compassion and even exaltation of the devil.
* Social demands (revaluation of marginalized types, such as the beggar).
* Nature, shown in all its modalities and variations. Usually set in mysterious places, such as cemeteries, storms, the rough sea, etc.
* Satire, connected with political or literary events.

== Realism ==

In Realism (end of the 19th century), which is mixed with Naturalism, important topics are the novel, with Juan Valera, José María de Pereda, Benito Pérez Galdós, Emilia Pardo Bazán, Leopoldo Alas (Clarín), Armando Palacio Valdés, and Vicente Blasco Ibáñez; poetry, with Ramón de Campoamor, Gaspar Núñez de Arce, and other poets; the theater, with José Echegaray, Manuel Tamayo y Baus, and other dramatists; and the literary critics, emphasizing Menéndez Pelayo. Realism offered depictions of contemporary life and society &#x27;as they were&#x27;. In the spirit of general &quot;Realism,&quot; Realist authors opted for depictions of everyday and banal activities and experiences, instead of a romanticized or similarly stylized presentation.

The realistic works of this period are characterized by:

* Objective vision of reality through the direct observation of customs or psychological characters. They eliminate any subjective aspect, fantastic events, and every feeling that moves away from reality: &quot;The novel is the image of life&quot; (Galdós), &quot;an artistic copy of reality&quot; (Clarín).
* Defense of a thesis: the narrators write their works approaching reality from their moral conception. They are the so-called omniscient narrators. The defense of a thesis usually compromises the objectivity of the novel.
* Themes that are familiar to the reader: marital conflicts, infidelity, defense of ideals, etc.
* The popular and colloquial language acquires great importance since it situates the characters in their real environment.

==Modernist literature==

In Modernism several currents appear: Parnassianism, Symbolism, Futurism, and Creationism. Literary Modernism in Spain was influenced by the &quot;disaster of &#x27;98&quot;, Regenerationism, and the Free Institution of Education (founded by &quot;Giner de los Ríos&quot;). Modernism was rooted in the idea that &quot;traditional&quot; forms of art, literature, religious faith, social organization, and daily life had become outdated; therefore it was essential to sweep them aside.
The intellectual movement that thinks objectively and scientifically about the causes of the decadence of Spain as a nation between the 19th and the 20th century is called Regenerationism. It expresses a pessimist judgement about Spain. The regenerationist intellectuals divulgated their studies in journals with a big diffusion, so the movement expanded.
Some important Modernist authors are Salvador Rueda, Juan Ramón Jiménez, Miguel de Unamuno and Rubén Darío.

==20th century literature==
=== The Generation of 1898 ===

The destruction of Spain&#x27;s fleet in Cuba by U.S. gunboats in 1898 provoked a general cultural crisis in Spain. The &quot;Disaster&quot; of 1898 led established writers to seek practical political, economic, and social solutions in essays grouped under the literary heading of &quot;Regeneracionismo&quot;. For a group of younger writers, among them Miguel de Unamuno, Pío Baroja, and José Martínez Ruiz (Azorín), the Disaster and its cultural repercussions inspired a deeper, more radical literary shift that affected both form and content. These writers, along with Ramón del Valle-Inclán, Antonio Machado, Ramiro de Maeztu, and Ángel Ganivet, came to be known as the &quot;Generation of 98&quot;. The label from its outset was controversial and even Azorín, the source of its origin, came to reject it. Nevertheless, it stuck as a way to describe a group of writers who turned in content from the more general exploration of universal middle class values characteristic of Nineteenth Century Realism to an obsession with questions of a more national nature. Their articles, essays, poems, and novels exploring Spanish history and geography carried existential overtones, expressing overall a sense of deep malaise at the social injustice, political bungling, and cultural indifference evident in contemporary Spanish society.

Within a matter of years, these young authors had transformed their nation’s literary landscape. To be sure, established nineteenth century realists, such as Benito Pérez Galdós, continued to write novels and theater into the second decade of the twentieth century, and, again in the case of Galdós, were much admired by the new generation of writers. Nevertheless, with the novels of Unamuno, Azorín, Pío Baroja, and Valle Inclán, the theater of the latter, and the poetry of Antonio Machado and Unamuno, a definitive literary shift had taken place—a shift in both form and content—pointing towards the more celebrated experimental writings of Spain&#x27;s vanguard writers of the 1920s.
Thanks to Azorín&#x27;s designation of his fellow writers as a “generation&quot;, contemporary critics and later literary historians were to catalogue and then interpret the arrival of new batches of authors in such generational terms for nearly the next one hundred years. Certainly, the terminology possesses a certain organizational elegance and indeed, recognizes the significant impact of major political and cultural events on changing literary expressions and tastes (for example, the 1898 connection, or a 1927 literary celebration that briefly united nearly every major vanguard poet in Spain).

=== The Generation of 1914 or Novecentismo ===

The next supposed “generation&quot; of Spanish writers following those of ´98 already calls into question the value of such terminology. By the year 1914—the year of the outbreak of the First World War and of the publication of the first major work of the generation&#x27;s leading voice, José Ortega y Gasset—a number of slightly younger writers had established their own place within the Spanish cultural field. Leading voices include the poet Juan Ramón Jiménez, the academics and essayists Ramón Menéndez Pidal, Gregorio Marañón, Manuel Azaña, Eugenio d&#x27;Ors, and Ortega y Gasset, and the novelists Gabriel Miró, Ramón Pérez de Ayala, and Ramón Gómez de la Serna. While still driven by the national and existential questions that obsessed the writers of ´98, they approached these topics with a greater sense of distance and objectivity. These writers had enjoyed more formal academic training than their predecessors, many taught within the walls of academia, and one, Azaña, was to become President and face of the Second Republic. Their genre of choice were the essay and the article, their arguments more systematic, and their tastes, more European.

In contrast to Unamuno&#x27;s existential obsessions or Machado&#x27;s conceptual, earth-bound verse, Juan Ramón&#x27;s poetry pursued a more esoteric version of beauty and truth above all, while still manifesting an internalized sense of the existential dilemmas that plagued intellectuals in the first half of the twentieth century. Juan Ramón was Spain&#x27;s great modernist poet and the maestro of the coming vanguardist Generation of 1927. In 1957 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. José Ortega y Gasset became the spokesman for this and essential every generation of writers in the first half of the twentieth century. In essays like “Meditations on the Quijote,&quot; “The Rebellion of the Masses,&quot; and most famously, “The Dehumanization of Art,&quot; Ortega laid out theories of art and society that lucidly explained and celebrated twentieth century vanguard experimentation while holding fast to an elitist social vision whose eclipse this art ironically expressed. The most elusive voice of this generation, and arguably, unclassifiable within this group was the novelist Ramón Gómez de la Serna who carried the narrative experiments of Unamuno and Valle Inclán to absurd extremes, such as in his 1923 novel, &quot;El novelista&quot;, where varieties of plays with narrative subjectivity result in chapters envisioned through the eyes and voice of street lamps. More approachable and enduring are Gómez de la Serna&#x27;s “Greguerías,&quot; an original form of aphorism that he described as “humor plus metaphor.&quot;

=== The Generation of 1927 ===

Around 1920 a younger group of writers—mostly poets—began publishing works that from their beginnings revealed the extent to which younger artists were absorbing the literary experimentation of the writers of 1898 and 1914. Poets Pedro Salinas, Jorge Guillén, Federico García Lorca, Vicente Aleixandre, Dámaso Alonso, Rafael Alberti, Luis Cernuda, Manuel Altolaguirre were likewise the most closely tied to formal academia yet. Novelists such as Benjamín Jarnés, Rosa Chacel, Francisco Ayala, and Ramón J. Sender were equally experimental and academic. Many of this generation were full-time university professors, while others spent periods as guest teachers and students. All were scholars of their national literary heritage, again evidence of the impact of the calls of “Regeneracionistas&quot; and the Generation of 1898 for Spanish intelligence to turn at least partially inwards.

This group of poets continues to be, without contest, the most celebrated and studied of Spain&#x27;s twentieth century writers. Their work provides a capstone to what some have called the “Silver Age&quot; of Spanish Letters, a period that began with the veritable explosion of novel production following the bloodless coup of 1868 and that would come to a tragic end with the outbreak of civil war in July 1936.

The writing of this supposed generation can be roughly divided into three moments. In their early years their work arises still out of mostly local and national traditions, culminating in their united celebration of the tri-centennial of the death of Golden Age poet Luis de Góngora. From mid decade until the arrival of Spain&#x27;s Second Republic in 1931, the Generation&#x27;s poets reached the apex of their experimental writings, manifesting a clear awareness of the international vanguard “—isms&quot; sweeping major Western capitals of the day. After 1931, the Generation&#x27;s writing increasingly displays the imprint of the political and social stresses that would lead to Spain&#x27;s bloody civil war.

=== The Spanish Civil War ===
The Spanish Civil War, lasting from July 1936 to April 1939, had a devastating impact on the trajectory of Spanish letters. In July 1936, Spain was at the height of its Silver Age. Every major writer of the three major generations—1898, 1914, and 1927—was still alive and productive. Those of 1914 and 1927 were at the height or just reaching the height of their literary powers. Several were recognized among Western civilization&#x27;s most talented and influential writers. But by April 1939, Miguel de Unamuno, Antonio Machado, and Federico García Lorca, among others, were dead. All but a small handful of the remaining writers had fled into exile, dispersed across the length of the American continent, most never to enjoy the close associations of conferences, tertulias, and theater premiers that had so often united them in pre-war Madrid.

Among the handful of civil war poets and writers, Miguel Hernández stands out. A young disciple and associate of the Generation of 1898, Hernández, like Lorca, became a martyr to the Republican cause but this time as a post-war prisoner, fighting and writing as a soldier poet throughout the war and then languishing and dying in one of Franco&#x27;s prisons in 1942. Among his important works, Perito en lunas (1933) from his pre-war surrealist days and Viento del pueblo (1937), evidence of the work of a soldier-poet, stand out.

=== Witnessing the early dictatorship (1939–1955) ===

The earliest years of the post-war were characterized more by hunger, repression, and suffering than by any significant literature. The published works of this period were true to pseudo-fascist dictator Francisco Franco&#x27;s reactionary vision of a second Spanish golden age than to the material and existential anguish facing the majority of the country&#x27;s population of the time. Neo-baroque poetry and paeans to Franco&#x27;s Spain satisfied the censors but has enjoyed no subsequent critical shelf-life.

Ironically, the narrative production of one of Franco&#x27;s censors would provide the first sign of literary revival in post-war Spain. In 1942, Camilo José Cela&#x27;s novel, , used just enough experimental arrangement (temporally disjointed narrative development to problematize simple accusations of political cause-effect critique; prefaces and post-scripts that confuse authorial intentions) to avoid the censors´ cuts and to present to discerning Spanish readers an exposé of a spiritually troubled, socially impoverished, and structurally violent society. Cela was to remain for the next five decades as one of Spain&#x27;s most important novelists, eventually receiving the Nobel Prize for literature in 1989.

With the 1945 publication of the Nadal Prize winning by Carmen Laforet and the 1947 release of Miguel Delibes&#x27;s , readers of intelligent Spanish narrative at last had cause for hope. While the fresh, joyful experimentation of Spain&#x27;s &quot;Silver Age&quot; writers had disappeared, Cela, Laforet, and Delibes at least showed a renewed commitment to a kind of writing that first, was connected to Spain&#x27;s material reality, and second, would stretch itself aesthetically in its attempts to capture the experience.

By the middle of the next decade, a whole new generation of novelists was latching onto the early models laid down by Cela and Laforet. Equally influenced by the films of the Italian neorealists, novelists such as Luis Romero (, 1951), Rafael Sánchez Ferlosio (, 1956), Jesús Fernández Santos (, 1956), Carmen Martín Gaite (, 1957), Ignacio Aldecoa (, 1954), and Juan Goytisolo (, 1954) produced a social realist tradition that was as celebrated as it was short-lived.

Spanish poetry experienced renewal along similar lines. Dámaso Alonso&#x27;s poem, &quot;Insomnia&quot; (1947) captures much of the angst and sense of violence that informed the works of Cela &quot;et al.&quot; and that would infuse the Spanish poetry of the era:

Poems by José Hierro, Blas de Otero, and Gabriel Celaya were more direct, penning poems with such transparent titles as (Hierro), (Otero), or (Celaya).

=== Economic and cultural renewal (1955–1975) ===

However, by the mid-1950s, just as with the novel, a new generation which had only experienced the Spanish civil war in childhood was coming of age. While still informed by the material social and political conditions of Spanish society, the works of Ángel González, Claudio Rodríguez, José Ángel Valente, José Agustín Goytisolo, Francisco Brines, and Gloria Fuertes among others are less politically committed. Scholars differentiate these poets´ social focus as one of communication of experience versus Hierro&#x27;s and Celaya&#x27;s representation of experience. That is, while these younger poets were still interested in talking about Spain, they were at least equally focused on the interactive processes of communication with the reader who was contemporaneously living these experiences. Rather than passively ingest the poet&#x27;s vision of contemporary society, the poets of what came to be called variously the generation of 1956 or “of the 1960s&quot; produced poetry that engaged the reader in the interpretation if not the production of that vision.

By the early 1960s, the brief social realist burst in narrative was already growing stale. Numerous novelists took a brief hiatus from writing. The general consensus as a new decade began was that the straightforward “realism&quot; of the previous decade, while manifesting the brutal “truth&quot; of contemporary Spanish life under Franco, ultimately failed politically in that it directly modeled the very transparent discourse used so effectively by the authoritarian regime to crush the very opposition to which these writers aspired. Shaped in part by the French &quot;nouveau roman&quot; of writers like Alain Robbe-Grillet, the French &quot;La Nouvelle Vague&quot; cinema of Godard and Truffaut, and Latin American “Boom&quot;, Spanish novelists and poets, beginning perhaps with Luis Martín Santos&#x27;s novel, &quot;Tiempo de silencio&quot; (1961), returned to the restless literary experimentation last seen in Spanish letters in the early 1930s. Among Spain&#x27;s most celebrated “New Novels&quot; of this period, Juan Benet&#x27;s &quot;Volverás a Región&quot; (1967), Camilo José Cela&#x27;s &quot;San Camilo, 36&quot; (1969), Miguel Delibes&#x27;s &quot;Cinco horas con Mario&quot; (1966), Juan Goytisolo&#x27;s so called “Trilogy of Treason&quot; consisting of &quot;Señas de identidad&quot; (1966), &quot;Reivindicación del conde Don Julián&quot; (1970), and &quot;Juan sin tierra&quot; (1975), Gonzalo Torrente Ballester&#x27;s &quot;La saga/fuga de J.B.&quot; (1972), Juan Marsé&#x27;s &quot;Si te dicen que caí&quot; (1973), and Luis Goytisolo&#x27;s tetralogy &quot;Antagonía&quot; (1973–1981) stand out. While arguably pulling Spanish narrative by the collar from the relative dark of social realism towards the aesthetic standards of Europe&#x27;s most elite avant-garde, many of these novels proved almost unreadable to much of the public, a reality nicely embodied at the end of Juan Goytisolo&#x27;s trilogy when an already deconstructed Spanish prose gradually transforms into an unreadable Arabic.

The novel&#x27;s experimentation was shadowed in Spanish poetry. José María Castellet&#x27;s publication of &quot;Nueve novísimos poetas españoles&quot; recognized a group of artists whose works had similarly returned to early century experimentation. The works of Pere Gimferrer, Guillermo Carnero, and Leopoldo Panero, arguably the most important poets of the group, manifest a decidedly baroque style full of oblique cultural references, metapoetic devices, and other forms of extreme poetic self-consciousness spilling into the precious. Like the works of the New Novelists, this poetry was for a select group of readers, if not exclusive to the poets themselves.

=== Writing in the democracy (1975–1999) ===

When Franco at last died in November 1975, the important work of establishing democracy had an immediate impact on Spanish letters. Elitist narrative and poetry quickly gave way to narrative and poetry interested anew in not merely teaching (via content or style) but in delighting. Storytelling became the mantra for a new generation of Spanish novelists. Eduardo Mendoza&#x27;s &quot;The Truth about the Savolta Case&quot; (1975) invited readers to escape to the roaring 1920s of Spain&#x27;s pre-political, culturally vibrant Silver Age. While availing itself of various “New Novel&quot; experiments such as narrative fragmentation, the use of mixed media, and the presence of numerous often contradictory narrative voices, Mendoza&#x27;s novel could be read and enjoyed as an adventure story with romantic and dramatic appeal.

Carmen Martín Gaite&#x27;s 1978 novel, &quot;El cuarto de atrás&quot;, was another manifestation of the happy melding of experiment with old-fashioned storytelling, pulling readers down through various narrative levels to explore dark memories of Spain&#x27;s recent political past but with the light, ironic touch of a romance novel. Over the next several years a wealth of young new writers, among them Juan José Millás, Rosa Montero, Javier Marías, Luis Mateo Díez, José María Merino, Félix de Azúa, Cristina Fernández Cubas, Enrique Vila-Matas, Carme Riera, and later Antonio Muñoz Molina and Almudena Grandes, would begin carving out a prominent place for themselves within the Spanish cultural field. During the 1980s, Spanish narrative began appearing regularly on best seller lists for the first time since the pre-war era and many of this new generation became literary and cultural celebrities, living off their work as writers with all its blessing and curses, including the obligation to publish or perish.

By the 1990s, the pressure to produce for the large publishing houses was clearly diminishing the early literary promise of some of these writers. On the other hand, some like Javier Marías, after publishing since the early 1970s, finally achieved international fame, appearing on best-seller lists throughout Europe. Marías&#x27;s novels &quot;Corazón tan blanco&quot; (1992) and &quot;Mañana en la batalla piensa en mí&quot; (1994), and his ever-expanding experiment with real fiction (begun with 1989&#x27;s &quot;Todas las almas&quot; and continued through weekly newspaper columns, 1998&#x27;s &quot;Negra espalda del tiempo&quot;, and extended in his 21st century trilogy, &quot;Tu rostro mañana&quot;), placed him on numerous critics´ Nobel Prize shortlists.

The big money available through novel publishing manifest itself in the 1990s in the explosion of literary prizes, awarded in Spain, unlike the UK&#x27;s Man Booker or the U.S.´s Pulitzer, to unpublished works. Literary prizes became little more than publicity opportunities. The long-standing Planeta and Nadal prizes, already media events, grew in importance and remuneration. They were joined during the decade by the Primavera, Alfaguara, and Lara Prizes, the return of the Café Gijón and the Biblioteca Breve prizes. Most carried large sums for the winners and guaranteed—often obligated—long international book tours.

Into this economically charged mix stepped two new phenomena, the literary superstar and the literary celebrity. The former is almost entirely embodied by journalist turned novelist Arturo Pérez-Reverte who has managed to merit a certain critical acclaim while topping the sales charts with nearly every novel he writes. Many of his novels have been converted into popular films. A lesser figure as far as novel sales, but still important to the overall industry is the literary celebrity. These celebrities range from politically powerful figures like Antonio Muñoz Molina and Jon Juaristi to brief media flashes like Ray Loriga, José Ángel Mañas, and Lucía Etxebarría. The latter three were the most representative members of the last of the twentieth century&#x27;s supposed literary “generations.&quot; The “Generación X,&quot; as critics dubbed them, brought black humor to a certain kind of post-political social realism focused principally on sex, drugs, rock-n-roll and the mental illness that accompanies it. These writers proved an excellent marketing phenomenon. That their works will endure is doubtful.

New novelists whose work is more likely to endure that began publishing in this period include Rafael Chirbes, Belén Gopegui, David Trueba, the Basques writers Bernardo Atxaga and Álvaro Bermejo, the Galician&#x27;s Manuel Rivas and Suso de Toro among others. In the final decade of the 1990s, then, arguably five generations of writers—from Cela, to Sánchez Ferlosio, to Mendoza, to Muñoz Molina, to the Generation X authors—were sharing the expanding literary space of Spanish narrative. Notwithstanding the plethora of prize money that threatened to drown out quality with media-generated noise, the Spanish literary field at the end of the twentieth century was as promising as it had been since the 1920s.

==Contemporary literature==
Javier Marías is widely considered as the most distinguished author in contemporary Spanish literature. Other acclaimed and widely read writers both nationally and internationally are Enrique Vila-Matas, Rosa Montero, Antonio Muñoz Molina, as well as more commercial authors like Carlos Ruiz Zafón. In recent years authors such as Elvira Navarro and Javier Cercas have published acclaimed best-selling novels.

In the spring of 1939, &quot;Nashville&quot; carried American representatives to the Pan American Defense Conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, returning them to Annapolis, Maryland, on 20 June 1939. On 23 June, she steamed westwards from Norfolk, Virginia, for the Pacific via the Panama Canal, arriving at San Pedro, California, on 16 July for two years of operations. In February 1941, she and three other cruisers carried US Marines to Wake Island. On 20 May, she departed Pearl Harbor for the east coast, arriving Boston on 19 June to escort a convoy carrying Marines to Iceland.

===World War II===
From August–December 1941, &quot;Nashville&quot; was based at Bermuda for the Neutrality Patrol in the Central Atlantic. With the bombing of Pearl Harbor, &quot;Nashville&quot; steamed to Casco Bay, Maine, where she joined with a troop and cargo convoy to escort them to Iceland. She continued escort duty to Bermuda and Iceland until February 1942.

====Doolittle Raid====
On 4 March 1942, she rendezvoused with off the Virginia Capes, and then escorted the aircraft carrier to the West Coast via the Panama Canal, arriving on 20 March at San Diego. &quot;Hornet&quot; and &quot;Nashville&quot; steamed from San Francisco on 2 April, with the carrier laden with 16 Army B-25 Mitchell medium bombers on her flight deck, bombers under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle, USAAF, for the Doolittle Raid on Japan. On 13 April, they rendezvoused with other US Navy warships, under Vice Admiral William F. Halsey Jr., north of Midway Atoll, and then they set course for Japan. When about away from Japan on 17 April, the destroyers of the task force were detached due to lack of fuel, and then &quot;Nashville&quot;, the other escorting cruisers, and &quot;Hornet&quot; and made a high-speed dash to the air raid launching point from Japan. The next day, the task force was sighted by a Japanese picket boat, which reported the presence of the carrier task force before being sunk by scout planes from &quot;Enterprise&quot;. A second picket boat was then sunk by gunfire from &quot;Nashville&quot;, but the advantage of surprise was lost. The B–25s were launched short of the intended launching point in heavy seas. Immediately after the launch, the strike force reversed course and steamed eastwards for Honolulu. The &quot;Shangri-La&quot; task force returned to Pearl Harbor on 25 April.

====Flagship====
&quot;Nashville&quot; left Hawaii on 14 May 1942 to become the flagship of Task Force 8 (TF 8) defending Alaska and the Aleutians, and arrived at Dutch Harbor, Alaska, on 26 May. She steamed for Kodiak, Alaska two days later to join with other units of the task force, including USS St Louis and her sister USS Honolulu as well as two heavy cruisers and 6 destroyers. On 3–4 June, Japanese carrier planes struck Dutch Harbor. &quot;Nashville&quot; and her accompanying warships were unable to make contact with the enemy due to heavy fog. Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto withdrew his diversionary force from the Aleutians after his defeat at the Battle of Midway. As the Japanese departed, they left occupying forces behind on Attu and Kiska Islands in the Aleutians. From June–November, &quot;Nashville&quot; patrolled the North Pacific Ocean, and participated in the attack on Kiska on 7 August, in which heavy damage was inflicted on Japanese shore installations.

&quot;Nashville&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 22 November and proceeded south to the Fiji Islands on 24 December. At Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, she became flagship of TF 67. After escorting troopships to Guadalcanal, &quot;Nashville&quot;, , and inflicted heavy damage on the Japanese air base at Munda on the night of 4 January 1943. Subsequent attacks were made on Kolombangara and New Georgia in the next several months. While shelling Vila airfield on Kolombangara on the night of 12 May, she suffered a powder charge explosion in one of her forward turrets, killing 18 and injuring 17.

Leaving Espiritu Santo on 22 May, &quot;Nashville&quot; arrived at Mare Island Naval Shipyard for repairs and modernization. Departing from San Francisco on 6 August, she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 12 August to join carrier task forces for strikes on Marcus Island and Wake Island during the next two months.

&quot;Nashville&quot; returned to Espiritu Santo on 25 October and for the next seven months, she shelled targets on New Guinea and the Admiralty Islands. Against the Japanese, &quot;Nashville&quot; provided fire support for the landings on Bougainville Island and Cape Gloucester, New Britain. After bombarding Wake Island on 21–22 April 1944, &quot;Nashville&quot; provided fire support and carried General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to the amphibious operations at Hollandia (present-day Jayapura), Tanahmerah Bay, and Aitape, on 22–23 April. On 27 May, the light cruiser was a member of the assault force shelling Biak, Schouten Islands, where on 4 June, she sustained moderate damage from a near miss while repelling a Japanese air attack.

After repairs at Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, &quot;Nashville&quot; twice more carried General MacArthur and his staff to the invasion of Morotai, Dutch East Indies in mid-September. She carried General MacArthur on his return to the Philippines, for which she sailed from Manus on 16 October. She provided fire support for the Leyte Island landings on 20 October, and she remained on station at the mouth of Leyte Gulf until 25 October, guarding the troops on the beachhead and the nearby transports. Returning to Manus Island for brief repairs, &quot;Nashville&quot; left the Admiralties on 28 November as the flagship for the Commander, Visayan Attack Force, &quot;en route&quot; to the invasion of Mindoro.

====Kamikaze attack====

On 13 December, she was struck by a &quot;kamikaze&quot; off Negros Island. The aircraft crashed into her port 5 in/127mm gun mount, with both bombs exploding about 10 ft (3 m) off her deck. Gasoline fires and exploding ammunition made her midships area an inferno, but although 133 sailors were killed and 190 wounded, her remaining 5 in (127 mm) guns continued to provide anti-aircraft fire.

The Attack Group Commander, Rear Admiral Arthur Dewey Struble, shifted his flag to , and &quot;Nashville&quot; steamed via San Pedro Bay in the Philippines and Pearl Harbor, Oahu, to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, arriving on 12 January 1945, for heavy repairs. Underway on 12 March, &quot;Nashville&quot; departed westward from San Diego, California, on 15 April after training exercises.

Arriving at U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay, on 16 May, &quot;Nashville&quot; became the flagship of TF 74. The closing months of the war were spent providing fire support for the landings at Brunei Bay, Borneo, and protecting aircraft carriers in the Makassar Straits, Dutch East Indies. On 29 July, &quot;Nashville&quot; made a brief sortie from Subic to intercept a Japanese convoy reported off Indochina, but the sortie was soon canceled, ending her final wartime operation.

===Post-war===

&quot;Nashville&quot;, with Commander TF 73 (CTF 73) embarked, entered Shanghai harbor on 19 September 1945, to resume Yangtze River Patrol. CTF 73 hauled down his flag on 17 November, and &quot;Nashville&quot; sailed for the US West Coast with 450 returning soldiers, as part of Operation Magic Carpet. Picking up 90 more soldiers in Hawaii, she reached San Pedro, California, on 3 December, and then immediately steamed west to Eniwetok and Kwajalein to pick up more returning troops and Marines. Nearing the US West Coast on 3 January 1946, &quot;Nashville&quot; came to the aid of , laboring in heavy seas with engine breakdowns and 1,800 men aboard. The cruiser took &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; in tow, pulling her to safety to the tugs at the San Francisco Lightship on 6 January 1946.

===Chilean Navy===
&quot;Nashville&quot; departed eastward from San Francisco on 21 January 1946, and she arrived at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a pre-inactivation overhaul. Decommissioned on 24 June, she remained in reserve until 1950. After an overhaul at the Philadelphia Naval Yard, she was sold to Chile on 9 January 1951, and she served in the Chilean Navy as the Chilean cruiser &quot;Capitán Prat&quot; (CL-03) until the arrival of the Chilean destroyer &quot;Capitán Prat&quot; (1967) in 1982. Then, the old &quot;Prat&quot; was renamed &quot;Chacabuco&quot; and served until 1985.

She saw service during the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;etat, where she secured Federico Santa María Technical University alongside the destroyer &quot;Aldea&quot;.

<text>Portland House is a skyscraper in Westminster, London. It is tall with 29 floors. The building was the central feature of the redevelopment of the six acres old Watney&#x27;s Brewery site. The architects were Howard, Fairbairn &amp; Partners, and the development took place from 1959 to 1963. Pevsner notes that the architectural form of Portland House was influenced by the Pirelli Tower (1955–58) in Milan by architect Gio Ponti. The development was known as Stag Place. Today the site is Cardinal Place.

The building has two banks of lifts — the first serving the first up to the fifteenth floor, and the second the fifteenth floor upwards.

Firms that have at one point occupied Portland House for office space include American Express, Crossrail, HomeAway UK, Owners Direct, Direct Ferries Orbus Software, Increase the Wedge, NetBooster, Somo Global, TradeDoubler, Wunder2, uSwitch, Upmystreet.com, Reef Television, Rentokil Initial, AkzoNobel, Monica Vinader and IWG. The building also once contained the head offices of British United Airways.

The building is a five-minute walk from London Victoria station (rail and tube) and a ten-minute walk from Victoria Coach Station. The surrounding area was redeveloped between 2003 and 2005, with a new shopping and refreshments area called Cardinal Place. The building also has a gym in the basement.

The building is part of the Cardinal Place Estate, which includes the shopping centre and development around the building. Retail establishments such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Boots, Thorntons, Zara, Ha Ha Bar and Zizzi have taken retail space in the complex.

The ground floor has a portico arrangement of pillars which reflect the octagonal cross-section of the building.

The Portland House is substantially similar in design to the MetLife Building in New York City. The two buildings were under construction at the same time.

As of June 2021, the building is entirely vacant, with the ground floor behind hoardings, pending renovation by Land Securities.

The book details the conflict between two rival gangs of White Americans divided by their socioeconomic status: the working-class &quot;Greasers&quot; and the upper-middle-class &quot;Socs&quot; (pronounced —short for &quot;Socials&quot;). The story is told in first-person perspective by teenage protagonist Ponyboy Curtis, and takes place in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1965, although this is never explicitly stated in the book.

Hinton began writing the novel when she was 15 and wrote the bulk of it when she was 16 and a junior in high school. She was 18 when the book was published. She released the work using her initials rather than her feminine given names (Susan Eloise) so that her gender would not lead male book reviewers to dismiss the work.

A film adaptation was directed in 1983 by Francis Ford Coppola, and a short-lived television series appeared in 1990, picking up where the movie left off. A dramatic stage adaptation was written by Christopher Sergel and published in 1990. A Tony Award-winning stage musical adaptation of the same name premiered in San Diego in 2023 then on Broadway in 2024.

==Plot==
Ponyboy Curtis, a fourteen-year-old boy who is a member of a &quot;gang of greasers&quot;, is leaving a movie theater when he is jumped by &quot;Socs&quot;, the greasers&#x27; rival gang. Several greasers, including Ponyboy&#x27;s two older brothers—the paternal Darry and the popular Sodapop—come to his rescue. The next night, Ponyboy and two greaser friends, the hardened Dally and the quiet Johnny, meet Cherry and Marcia, a pair of Soc girls, at a drive-in movie theater. Cherry scorns Dally&#x27;s rude advances, but Ponyboy speaks civilly with Cherry, emotionally connecting with a Soc for the first time in his life.

Afterward, Ponyboy, Johnny, and their wisecracking friend Two-Bit begin to walk Cherry and Marcia home, when they are stopped by Cherry&#x27;s boyfriend Bob, who badly beat up Johnny a few months back. Bob and the greasers exchange taunts, but Cherry prevents a fight by willingly leaving with Bob. Ponyboy gets home at two in the morning, enraging Darry until he suddenly slaps Ponyboy. As Darry tries to apologize, Pony runs out the door and meets up with Johnny, expressing his anger at Darry&#x27;s increasing coldness in the wake of his parents&#x27; recent deaths in a car crash.

Running away from home, Ponyboy and Johnny wander into a park, where Bob and four other Socs surround them. After some heated talk, Ponyboy spits at the Socs, prompting them to attempt to drown him in a nearby fountain, but Johnny stabs Bob, killing him and dispersing the rest. Terrified as to what to do next, Ponyboy and Johnny rush to find Dally, who gives them money and a loaded firearm, directing them to hide in an abandoned church in Windrixville. During their stay there, Pony cuts and dyes his hair as a disguise, reads &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; to Johnny, and, upon viewing a beautiful sunrise, recites the poem &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot; by Robert Frost.

Days later, Dally comes to check on them, revealing that violence between the greasers and Socs has escalated since Bob&#x27;s death into all-out city-wide warfare, with Cherry acting out of guilt as a spy for the greasers. Johnny decides to turn himself in and Dally agrees to take the boys back home. As they attempt to leave, they notice the church has caught fire and several local schoolchildren have become trapped inside. The greasers run inside the burning church to save the children, but Ponyboy is rendered unconscious by the fumes. At the hospital he discovers that he and Dally are not badly injured, but a piece of the church roof fell on Johnny and broke his back. Sodapop and Darry come to the hospital; Darry breaks down and cries. Ponyboy then realizes that Darry cares about him, and is only hard on him because he loves him and cares about his future.

The following morning the newspapers declare Pony and Johnny heroes, but Johnny will be charged with manslaughter for Bob&#x27;s death. Two-Bit tells them that the greaser–Soc rivalry is to be settled in a final rumble. Ponyboy and Two-Bit are approached by a Soc named Randy, Bob&#x27;s best friend, who expresses remorse for his involvement in the gang war, lacks confidence about the rumble ending the feud, and says he will not participate.

Later, Ponyboy visits Johnny at the hospital, where he is in critical condition. On their way home, Pony spots Cherry and they talk. Cherry says she is unwilling to visit Johnny in the hospital because he killed her boyfriend. Pony calls her a traitor, but after she explains herself they end on good terms. After escaping the hospital, Dally shows up just in time for the rumble. The greasers win the fight. Afterward, Pony and Dally hurry back to the hospital to see Johnny, but he dies moments later and a hysterical Dally runs out of the room. Pony returns home that night feeling confused and disoriented. Dally calls the house to say that he has robbed a store and is running from the police. The greasers find Dally deliberately pointing an unloaded firearm at the police, causing them to shoot and kill him. Overwhelmed, Ponyboy faints and is sick in bed for many days due to the resulting concussion from the rumble. When the hearing finally comes, the judge frees Ponyboy from responsibility for Bob&#x27;s death and allows Pony to remain at home with Darry and Sodapop.

Ponyboy returns to school, but his grades drop. Although he is failing English, his teacher, Mr. Syme, says he will pass him if he writes a decent theme. In the copy of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; that Johnny gave him before dying, Ponyboy finds a letter from Johnny describing how he will die proudly after saving the kids from the fire. Johnny also urges Ponyboy to &quot;stay golden&quot;. Ponyboy decides to write his English assignment about the recent events, and begins his essay with the opening line of the novel: &quot;When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house, I had only two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home&quot;.

==Controversy==
&quot;The Outsiders&quot; was a controversial book at the time of its publication; it is still currently challenged and debated. It was ranked #38 on the American Library Association’s Top 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–1999. This book has been banned from some schools and libraries because of the portrayal of gang violence, underage smoking and drinking, strong language/slang, and family dysfunction. However, in many U.S. schools, the book is part of the English curriculum at the middle- or high-school level.

==Critical reception==
On November 5, 2019, the &quot;BBC News&quot; listed &quot;The Outsiders&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

== Legacy ==
Ponyboy Curtis appears in Hinton&#x27;s later novel &quot;That Was Then, This Is Now&quot; (1971).

The 1983 film adaptation, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, has retained a fanbase since its release. The film is notable for casting young actors before their rise to fame, which includes C. Thomas Howell, Ralph Macchio, Matt Dillon, Patrick Swayze, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, Tom Cruise, and Diane Lane.

A television series based on the characters of the novel and film aired in 1990. It consists of a different cast playing the same characters. It picks up right after the events of the film&#x27;s ending and lasted only one season.

In Rockstar Games&#x27; 2006 video game &quot;Bully&quot;, The Greasers and the Preppies/Preps, are based on &quot;The Outsiders&quot;.

A stage musical of the same name held its world premiere at La Jolla Playhouse in February/March 2023. The production will be directed by Danya Taymor from a libretto by Adam Rapp, with songs by Jamestown Revival and music supervision, arrangements, and orchestrations by Justin Levine. The show began previews on Broadway at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre on March 16, 2024 and officially opened on April 11. It received 12 nominations at the 77th Tony Awards, winning 4 including Best Musical.

=== Museum and film locations ===
The Outsiders House Museum opened in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on August 9, 2019. In 2009, hip-hop artist Danny Boy O&#x27;Connor discovered the house that was used for the Curtis Brothers&#x27; home. Moving forward O&#x27;Connor kept the thought of buying it, which he eventually did in 2016. O&#x27;Connor said he bought it sight unseen and when he first went inside that it was falling apart. With the help of friends, the Oklahoma Film and Music Office, the City Council, local business and individuals who volunteered the restoration started. After raising funds the house went through extensive renovations to restore it and maintain its authenticity from the film. A GoFundMe was set up for additional funds, notable donors include Jack White who donated $30,000 and Billy Idol. Also to raise funds, screenings of the film were organized that actor C. Thomas Howell attended. Also in 2016, the street signs on the corner were changed to &quot;The Outsiders way&quot; and &quot;The Curtis Brothers Lane&quot;. Since its opening, the museum now contains a collection of &quot;The Outsiders&quot; memorabilia. Aside from Howell, between its restoration and opening, other stars of the films visited this includes Rob Lowe, Ralph Macchio, and Matt Dillon. For his efforts on preserving a cultural landmark O&#x27;Connor received a key to the city of Tulsa.

In 2022, in Sperry, Oklahoma, the group Upward Sperry restored the now un-operational DX gas station seen in the film. The group&#x27;s president Gary Coulson said, &quot;It&#x27;s really growing. I almost hate to say, but it&#x27;s almost like a cult following. They stream through here – what that does is get people here.&quot; With O&#x27;Connor they are planning to revitalize &quot;Outsiders&quot; nostalgia in Sperry.

<text>The London Hilton on Park Lane is a hotel situated on Park Lane, overlooking Hyde Park, in the exclusive Mayfair district of London. It is tall, has 28 storeys and 453 rooms including 56 suites.

==History==
The hotel opened as the London Hilton on 17 April 1963. It is a concrete-framed building, designed by William B. Tabler, an American architect who designed numerous Hilton hotels. The building was the first skyscraper hotel to be built in London, containing more than 500 bedrooms and six restaurants.

In 1965, The London Hilton&#x27;s Food and Beverage Director Lim Ewe Hin opened a James Bond themed bar due to the 1964 Goldfinger craze in London, the &quot;007 Room&quot;. It was furnished with props brought from Pinewood Studios When it was opened Harold Sakata who played Oddjob in Goldfinger was a host to greet guest. The venue closed in the 1970s.

On 24 August 1967, the Beatles met Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at the Hilton and subsequently went to Uttar Pradesh with him in order to meditate.

On 5 September 1975, the London Hilton was the target of an IRA bomb which killed two people and injured 63 others.

During the 1990s, the Pools Panel met each Saturday in a meeting room in the hotel.

A fire broke out in the hotel on 1 July 2011. The cause was a grease build up in one of the vents in the Trader Vic&#x27;s BBQ ovens. There were no fatalities or injuries, and damage was limited to water damage in Trader Vic&#x27;s requiring a refurb of the soft materials. The wooden carvings were intact from this and required no repair.

The London Hilton Park Lane served as the Olympic Family Hotel during the 2012 London Olympics, hosting members of the International Olympic Committee and other dignitaries attending the 2012 Games.

The hotel is also the site of the death of the Cranberries lead singer Dolores O&#x27;Riordan on 15 January 2018, aged 46. She had drowned in her room&#x27;s bathtub after drinking an excessive amount of alcohol.

In September 2018, Peter Pilotto hosted a fashion show event in Trader Vic&#x27;s.

On 28 November 2022, Trader Vic&#x27;s Worldwide announced the closure of their oldest running location inside the London Hilton Park Lane. This sparked an online campaign to reverse the Hilton&#x27;s decision, due to the valuable Polynesian interior that predated the hotel. The campaign was led by an online petition which received over 7,500 signatures, and an Instagram page. There was also a community Facebook group. Many celebrities became involved with the campaign, including presenter Jonathan Ross, and filmmaker Edgar Wright, who both made statements in support of keeping the restaurant open. The restaurant closed on 31 December 2022 with no comment from the Hilton regarding the campaign.

In April 2023, the hotel closed the WYLD nightclub at the site formerly known as Drama Park Lane and Whisky Mist.

Originating from a restaurant in Amsterdam, Mr Porter has expanded from its initial location at Amsterdam&#x27;s W Hotel to its first London site. The new venue will replace the Old Trader Vic&#x27;s at the Hilton, and will feature a main bar, wine library, chef&#x27;s table, and open kitchen. However, due to delays it is planned to open in 2025.

In June 2024, it was announced that Shanghai Me, a restaurant with locations in Dubai and Doha, would take over the rooftop restaurant and bar space at the hotel, following the closure of the Galvin Brothers&#x27; restaurant after an 18-year tenure. The new restaurant will feature a 1930s Shanghai design and a Pan-Asian menu, including dishes like lobster with Singapore sauce, sushi platters, Cantonese roast duck, and Mongolian lamb chops. Shanghai Me is known for high-end offerings such as roast duck with foie gras and caviar, and a Wagyu sub.

The London Hilton on Park Lane, known as the London Hilton when first built, was regarded as a modern landmark of its era and was prominently referenced in popular culture during that time.

In the 1974 novel &quot;The Forever War&quot; by Joe Haldeman, the main character, William Mandella, takes a leisure cruise in a &quot;dirigible&quot;, a floating hotel which crosses the Atlantic Ocean in three days and docks atop the London Hilton.

In 1978 Warren Zevon released the song Werewolves of London mentioned the Trader Vic&#x27;s bar which was located in the basement of the hotel. The songs lyric was &quot;I saw a werewolf drinkin&#x27; a piña colada at Trader Vic&#x27;s, And his hair was perfect&quot;. For fans of Warren Zevon this made this bar a popular place to go to and drink a piña colada. 

The hotel is mentioned in &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, in the episode titled &quot;A Royal Flush&quot;, which was the Christmas special of 1986. In this episode, Del Boy attempts to integrate Rodney into high society after Rodney starts dating a young woman named Vicky, whose family is quite wealthy. During one of the scenes, Del Boy makes a reference to staying at the London Hilton, trying to impress Vicky&#x27;s aristocratic family and fit into their world of affluence.

&quot;The Crown&quot; used Trader Vic&#x27;s as a backdrop for one of the destinations of the fictional Prince Charles during one of his international scenes. The scene was ultimately cut from the series.

The post-credits scene in &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; of Eddie Brock drinking in a bar was filmed in the Trader Vic&#x27;s, a bar which was located in the hotel&#x27;s basement.

==Tragic incidents==

Due to its height and prominent areas, there have been several tragic incidents at the London Hilton on Park Lane:

In October 1992, Darren Newton died from a failed BASE jumping attempt from the top of the London Hilton on Park Lane.

In September 2000, Alastair Morris was found dead on the pavement, having jumped from the 25th floor.

In September 2001, Ajay Goyal, a director of a cosmetics company, jumped to his death from the 14th floor of the hotel.

After the Goyal incident, Hilton said that it had &quot;permanently&quot; locked all bedroom balcony doors. A spokesman said this week: &quot;Security is of utmost importance to Hilton. All windows can only be opened by five inches, and balconies can only be opened if there is more than one registered guest in the room.&quot;

In September 2002, Jason Kiernan, suffering from psychological illness, jumped to his death from the 25th floor. His suicide note was found outside his room.

On 21 September 2007, a man in his 20s fell to his death from the 19th floor after a three-hour standoff with police negotiators. Emergency services responded to reports of the man standing on a ledge early in the morning, after the man had broken a window to gain access to the ledge. Despite efforts by negotiators to prevent the fall, the man landed on the roof of a second-floor building and was pronounced dead shortly afterward. Police did not disclose the man&#x27;s identity or details regarding the circumstances leading to his fall.

In April 2012, Darren Liddle, a Credit Suisse employee, died by suicide from the 19th floor due to work-related stress and substance abuse issues.

In March 2014, an unidentified man fell from the 28th floor. Despite efforts, police were unable to identify him, though his Oyster card suggested connections to South London.

These incidents have prompted the Hilton to implement stricter security measures, including permanently locking balcony doors and limiting window openings, in efforts to prevent further incidents.

<text>USS &quot;Newport News&quot; (CA–148) was the third and last ship of the of heavy cruisers in the United States Navy. She was the first fully air-conditioned surface ship and the last active all-gun heavy cruiser in the United States Navy.

== Construction and career ==
&quot;Newport News&quot; was laid down 1 November 1945, launched on 6 March 1948 by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Newport News, Virginia, sponsored by Eliza S. Ferguson and commissioned on 29 January 1949, with Captain Roland N. Smoot in command.

===1950–1962===

In addition to annual deployments to the Mediterranean from 1950 to 1961 for duty with the Sixth Fleet, she participated in major fleet exercises and midshipman training cruises in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic.

On 4 January 1956 she steamed for a tour of duty in the Mediterranean as the flagship of Vice Admiral Ralph A. Ofstie, Commander Sixth Fleet. Vice Admiral Ofstie was relieved on board by Vice Admiral Harry Donald Felt on 12 April in Barcelona, Spain. Commander Sixth Fleet transferred his flag to on 21 May at Gibraltar. The ship returned to Norfolk, Virginia on 29 May 1956. The ship visited the city of Newport News over the Fourth of July holiday, leaving Norfolk on 2 July and returning on 5 July. During the trip from Norfolk to Newport News, 250 dependents took part in the first dependents&#x27; cruise in the ship&#x27;s history. From 16 July to 24 August, she participated in Midshipman Cruise Charlie as flagship of Commander Cruiser Division TWO. Visits were made at New Orleans, Louisiana, Balboa, Canal Zone, and Guantanamo Bay. While transiting the Panama Canal, Rear Admiral Ira H. Nunn relieved Rear Admiral E. R. McLean, Jr. as Commander Cruiser Division TWO. On 19 September she entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for overhaul, remaining at Norfolk through December 1956. Commander Cruiser Division TWO transferred to on 20 September and his staff returned aboard on 1 November 1956.

In early September 1957, &quot;Newport News&quot; was on station in the Eastern Mediterranean in preparation for any contingency during the Syrian crisis. In March 1960, while steaming 75 miles northeast of Sicily, &quot;Newport News&quot; was ordered to proceed to Agadir, Morocco, to render assistance to the survivors of the 1960 earthquake. She steamed 1,225 miles in 40.5 hours at an average speed of 31 knots, arriving on 3 March to provide medical and material aid. After the assassination of General Rafael Trujillo and the resulting instability in Santo Domingo, &quot;Newport News&quot; was underway on short notice on 4 June 1961, and proceeded to a station in international waters off the Dominican Republic to await further orders. When the crisis terminated, the ship conducted training exercises off Puerto Rico before returning to Norfolk.

&quot;Newport News&quot;″ berthing and communications facilities were modified in the winter of 1962 to accommodate Commander United States Second Fleet and his staff. In August 1962, she participated in NATO Exercise RIPTIDE III, and upon the end of the exercise, made a month-long tour of Northern European ports as flagship of the Commander Striking Fleet Atlantic (COMSTRIKFLTLANT), the NATO role of the Commander of the Second Fleet.

Within a month after return to Norfolk, &quot;Newport News&quot; was underway on 22 October as the flagship of the Atlantic Fleet for the Cuban Missile Crisis, with as her destroyer escort. The two ships stopped the Soviet vessel &quot;Labinsk&quot; and ordered her away from Cuban waters. For the next month, acting as flagship for ComSecondFlt, &quot;Newport News&quot; was on station northeast of Cuba. When the Soviet MRBMs were dismantled and removed from Cuba, &quot;Newport News&quot; assisted in the missile count. Upon cancellation of the quarantine, she returned to her homeport of Norfolk the day before Thanksgiving.

===1963–1974===
Operations from 1963 through 1967 consisted primarily of NATO exercises in the North Atlantic, gunnery and amphibious exercises off the Eastern seaboard and Caribbean, and midshipman cruises. When the Dominican Republic crisis of 1965 developed, &quot;Newport News&quot; sortied from Norfolk on 29 April for Santo Domingo, where she was flagship for Commander Joint Task Force 122. &quot;Newport News&quot; remained on station off Santo Domingo until 7 May 1965 when JTF 122 was dissolved, and command was shifted to the Army ashore in the Dominican Republic. She returned to Norfolk, where in June alterations were made to increase her combat capabilities. On 28 June 1965, Newport News entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Norfolk, Virginia for a five-month period of refitting and overhaul. Shakedown was in Guantanamo, Cuba, over Christmas and New Year of 1965. Upon her return from Gitmo, she again became Flagship for Second Fleet, with Vice Admiral Masterson taking command.

1 September 1967, Commander Second Fleet shifted his flag to the light cruiser , and &quot;Newport News&quot; departed Norfolk 5 September for a six-month deployment to Southeast Asia.

Arriving Da Nang, South Vietnam, on the morning of 9 October, she became the flagship of ComCruDesFlot 3. That night, at 2300, she fired her eight-inch guns for the first time in anger against shore targets in North Vietnam as part of Operation Sea Dragon.

&quot;Newport News&quot; spent 50 days patrolling the coast of North Vietnam as part of Operation Sea Dragon – the Navy&#x27;s effort to destroy waterborne logistics craft, military supply routes and installations in North Vietnam. During this period, the ship conducted 156 strikes with 325 North Vietnamese coastal defense sites taken under fire. According to spotters, &quot;Newport News&quot; sank 17 waterborne logistics craft, damaged another 14 and destroyed several enemy bunkers and radar sites, bridges, barges, trucks and roads. The ship was subjected to return fire on several occasions, but each time countered enemy batteries. On 19 December 1967, &quot;Newport News&quot; exchanged fire with 20–28 separate shore batteries, simultaneously, off the coast of North Vietnam. During this engagement, over 300 enemy rounds bracketed the cruiser&#x27;s position, but she suffered no direct hits. This encounter led to forward observers to nickname &quot;Newport News&quot; &quot;The Gray Ghost from the East Coast,&quot; a moniker she retained throughout her three Vietnam deployments.
Subsequent to the end of Operation Sea Dragon and for the remaining several months of this deployment, &quot;Newport News&quot; participated in Naval Gunfire Support operations near the DMZ. In support of Third Marine Division forces on the coastal area, firing around the clock for periods sometimes lasting several weeks.

During this deployment, &quot;Newport News&quot; expended 59,241 rounds of high-explosive ammunition, while conducting 239 observed and 602 unobserved missions. She came under fire of enemy coastal defense batteries on seventeen separate occasions, hit by shrapnel but never suffered a direct hit.

The cruiser departed Subic Bay on 21 April and arrived at her homeport of Norfolk, Virginia, on 13 May 1968, via the Panama Canal.

Following an extensive yard overhaul period to prepare her for further combat operations, on 21 November 1968 &quot;Newport News&quot; departed Norfolk to commence a second deployment to Vietnam. Combat operations during this tour commenced on 25 December 1968, focused on providing naval gunfire support to the 7th and 9th ARVN in Vĩnh Bình Province and the DMZ. &quot;Newport News&quot; departed Da Nang on 3 June 1969, via San Francisco and the Panama Canal, to arrive at her homeport in Norfolk, Virginia, in early July.

In May 1972, &quot;Newport News&quot; returned for her third and final combat tour. Along with the guided missile cruisers and , as well as several screening destroyers, the ship took part in a high-speed night bombardment of Haiphong harbor known as Operation Custom Tailor. In June 1972, New York Times reporter Fox Butterfield, who was aboard the ship, detailed its role in Operation Linebacker. &quot;Along with 64 other aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers and supply ships of the Seventh Fleet—the biggest armada organized since World War II, Navy officers say—the Newport News is part of Operation Linebacker, the Nixon Administration&#x27;s air and naval campaign to prevent North Vietnamese supplies from getting to South Vietnam.&quot;

On 27 August 1972, &quot;Newport News&quot;, , and made a night raid into Haiphong Harbor shelling the port area from a distance of . After leaving the harbor two Vietnam People&#x27;s Navy torpedo boats engaged the ships southeast of Haiphong with one sunk by the &quot;Newport News&quot; and the other set on fire by the &quot;Rowan&quot; and then sunk by a Navy A-7 jet.

At 1 a.m. on 1 October 1972, while in action off the Demilitarized Zone, &quot;Newport News&quot; sustained an in-bore explosion in her center 8-inch gun of number two turret. A defective auxiliary detonating fuze caused the projectile to detonate almost immediately upon firing. A total of 20 sailors were killed and another 36 suffered serious injuries from toxic gas inhalation. The barrel proper was blown forward from the gun. After making its way to Subic Bay in the Philippines, the ship was out of commission for several weeks as its damaged gun was removed and its port plated over. The explosion had caused extensive damage to the center gun mount. It was proposed to replace the damaged mount with one from sister ships &quot;Des Moines&quot; (CA-134) or &quot;Salem&quot; (CA-139), both of which had been decommissioned, but this was rejected as being too expensive. As a result, the damage was not repaired and the turret was simply closed off for the remainder of the ship&#x27;s career.

Operations near Vietnam resumed 21 October and continued until December 1972 when the ship was recalled to Norfolk. During 1973 and 1974 the ship undertook training cruises and visited many ports around the world before being recalled for decommissioning. While there was some interest in retaining her &quot;big-gun&quot; capability in the fleet, a survey to determine further service indicated the ship was beyond economical refitting.

;Modifications
&quot;Newport News&quot; underwent several refits which changed her appearance and increased her capabilities. During the mid-1950s her forward bridge was enclosed on both levels with roofs and glass windows creating a navigation bridge above, and a flag bridge below. Later in the 1950s more capable radars for navigation and gunnery were fitted. The biggest change for her came in 1962 when a large deckhouse was added midships which gave her enhanced flagship accommodation and office spaces. This would result in her becoming the United States Second Fleet flagship for most of the rest of her career, save for her gunfire support stints during the Vietnam War.

===Decommissioning===
&quot;Newport News&quot; was decommissioned on 27 June 1975 during the Ford Administration and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 July 1978 during the Carter Administration. She spent her later years as a member of the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard&#x27;s Mothball Fleet and was sold for scrap in New Orleans, Louisiana, on 25 February 1993 during the Clinton Administration. The museum ship, in Quincy, Massachusetts contains her bell and other items dedicated to &quot;Newport News&quot; and her crew.

In the Hampton Roads Naval Museum&#x27;s The Ten Thousand-Day War at Sea: The U.S. Navy in Vietnam, 1950–1975 section of the museum, a large model of Newport News in her Vietnam configuration is displayed.

==Museum and Memorial Foundation==
In June 2000, three sailors from the USS &quot;Newport News&quot; visited the USS &quot;Salem&quot;, the sister ship of the &quot;News&quot; which is preserved as a museum ship. Discussions began on providing the USS &quot;Newport News&quot; shipmates space to set up a display and museum of the &quot;News&quot;. In July 2000, an agreement was reached between the USS Salem Museum and the USS Newport News Museum and Memorial Foundation. Donations of items, memorabilia, audio/visual material, and more began to flow in.
Between 2000 and 2002, multiple work parties were held to get the museum displays organized, installed, and arranged. In 2001, the USS Newport News Museum and Memorial Foundation were able to secure a mooring bit that was preserved from the &quot;News&quot;, as well as the memorial plaque honoring the fallen shipmates who perished in the October 1972 turret explosion. In 2002, the foundation also secured the ship&#x27;s bell from the Mariners Museum in Newport News, VA. Also in 2002, the Foundation organized a working party to restore Turret 2 on the USS &quot;Salem&quot; and dedicated it to the &quot;Newport News&quot; sailors who perished in the explosion. Decades of congealed hydraulic fluid were removed, brass polished, and paint applied.

<text>Julie Victoria Jones (born 1963) is an American/British fantasy author.

== Personal life ==
Julie Victoria Jones was born in Liverpool in 1963. Jones was an avid reader from an early age and has cited numerous literary influences, including Charles Dickens, Mark Twain, Jane Austen, Jack London, J. R. R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, and Ursula K. Le Guin.

In her youth, Jones worked as a barmaid in a pub in Liverpool. At age 20 she began to work for a local record label. She later moved to San Diego, California, where she ran an export business for several years and then served as a computer consultant, software developer, and marketing director for a interactive software company.

== Literary career ==
Jones&#x27;s literary career began with the publication of the fantasy novel &quot;The Baker&#x27;s Boy&quot; in 1995. The manuscript that was to become &quot;The Baker&#x27;s Boy&quot; was initially submitted as &quot;Immortal Longings&quot; to Warner Books in 1993. In a joint essay, &quot;The Road to a First Novel&quot;, Jones and editor Betsy Mitchell described the editing process that followed the arrival of the manuscript in the publisher&#x27;s slush pile.

&quot;The Baker&#x27;s Boy&quot; achieved bestseller status and was followed by two sequels, &quot;A Man Betrayed&quot; (1996) and &quot;Master and Fool&quot; (1997), both achieving similar levels of success and established Jones as &quot;one of the biggest new names in fantasy&quot;. Following the completion of this trilogy, dubbed &quot;The Book of Words&quot;, Jones wrote a standalone fantasy novel, &quot;The Barbed Coil&quot; (1997). She has since written the &quot;Sword of Shadows&quot; series of fantasy novels, set in a different area of the same world as &quot;The Book of Words&quot;, though considerably grimmer in tone.

In addition to writing fantasy novels, Jones has also written science fiction short stories on various subjects, including the internet and virtual reality, though she has never tried to get any of them published.

<doc id="562468" wikidata="Q5305869" url="?curid=562468" title="Drapers' Gardens">
<text>Drapers&#x27; Gardens is a site in the City of London at the junction of Throgmorton Avenue and Copthall Avenue on land owned by the Drapers&#x27; Company. Originally a garden space, it was largely built over by the early 20th century. It has been the site of two major office blocks since the 1960s.

==Before the 1960s==

Before the building of a comprehensive sewage system in London during the late 19th century, the site had been largely undeveloped since Roman times as it was waterlogged by tributaries of the River Walbrook. During the period from the first occupation by the Drapers&#x27; Company in 1544, it was a market garden and place of recreation. After the Great Fire of London, the west side was built over. Over the following 200 years, the remainder of the gardens remained a largely open space but were finally built over in 1873 (except for a small patch to the east of Throgmorton Avenue, now the gardens of Drapers&#x27; Hall). The buildings standing within the boundary of the Drapers&#x27; Company property line on the west side of Throgmorton Avenue were demolished to make way for the Seifert Tower.

==Seifert&#x27;s Drapers&#x27; Gardens==

The original Drapers&#x27; Gardens was a skyscraper in the City of London, designed by architect Richard Seifert. It stood at tall and had 30 storeys. It was completed in 1967 and demolished in 2007 by Keltbray.

After completion, the building was leased by the National Provincial Bank and continued to be used by the successor National Westminster Bank until the 1990s. It was used as overflow office space for the bank&#x27;s nearby head office at 41 Lothbury.

There were those who cited the building as a fine example of its period and one of the few genuinely well-designed towers of the 1960s. Seifert, its designer as well as the architect of Tower 42, described the Drapers&#x27; Gardens skyscraper as his proudest achievement.

When the tower was demolished in 2007, it was the tallest building to have ever been demolished in the United Kingdom. As of 2018, it remains the joint-tallest demolished building in the country, alongside the subsequent Southwark Towers, demolished the year after Drapers&#x27; Gardens.

==New development==
During the 1980s, it became apparent that Seifert&#x27;s building was not suitable as a modern office space. The sole occupant, National Westminster Bank, sought to end its lease and there was a weak market for replacement tenancies. The new office development was designed by Foggo Associates. The replacement Drapers&#x27; Gardens is tall with 16 floors, three roof terraces and a pocket park. At it has more floor space than the Seifert&#x27;s design. The building’s stepped profile was developed in response to local and long-distance views, and landscaped roof gardens were to provide amenity space for the building&#x27;s occupiers.

The developers were Exemplar Developments and Canary Wharf Developments. It was completed in Autumn 2009. The development was then sold on to Evans Randall in 2010 for £242.5 million. Most of the floors of the building were originally taken by Macquarie, however BlackRock subsequently made a higher offer.

Between the demolition and rebuilding, an archaeological dig by Pre-Construct Archaeology Ltd found Roman remains dating from 63 AD to 383 AD. These included a well with 19 metal vessels in an exceptional state of preservation, a ruler, and the skull of a bear.

<doc id="562477" wikidata="Q1329536" url="?curid=562477" title="Gatha (Zoroaster)">
<text>The Gathas () are 17 hymns in the Avestan language from the Zoroastrian oral tradition of the Avesta. The oldest surviving text fragment dates from 1323 CE, but they are believed by scholars to have been composed before 1000 BCE and passed down orally for centuries. They are traditionally believed to have been composed by the prophet Zarathushtra (Zoroaster) himself. They form the core of the Zoroastrian liturgy (the Yasna). They are arranged in five different modes or metres.

The Avestan term &quot;&quot; (𐬔𐬁𐬚𐬁 &quot;hymn&quot;, but also &quot;mode, metre&quot;) is cognate with Sanskrit &quot;gāthā&quot; (गाथा), both from the Proto-Indo-Iranian word &quot;*gaHtʰáH&quot;, from the root &quot;*gaH-&quot; &quot;to sing&quot;.

== Structure and organization ==

The Gathas are in verse, metrical in the nature of ancient Iranian religious poetry, that is extremely terse.

The 17 hymns of the Gathas consist of 238 stanzas, of about 1300 lines or 6000 words in total. They were later incorporated into the 72-chapter &quot;Yasna&quot; (chapter: &quot;ha&quot; or &quot;had&quot;, from the Avestan &quot;ha&#x27;iti&quot;, &#x27;cut&#x27;), that in turn is the primary liturgical collection of texts within the greater compendium of the Avesta. The 17 hymns are identified by their chapter numbers in the &quot;Yasna&quot;, and are divided into five major sections:
With the exception of &quot;Ahunavaiti&quot; Gatha, that is named after the &quot;Ahuna Vairya&quot; prayer (&quot;Yasna&quot; 27, not in the Gathas), the names of the Gathas reflect the first word(s) of the first hymn within them. The meter of the hymns is historically related to the Vedic &quot;tristubh-jagati&quot; family of meters. Hymns of these meters are recited, not sung.

The sequential order of the Gathas is structurally interrupted by the &quot;Yasna Haptanghaiti&quot; (&quot;seven-chapter &quot;Yasna&quot;&quot;, chapters 35–41, linguistically as old as the Gathas but in prose) and by two other minor hymns at &quot;Yasna&quot; 42 and 52.

== Language ==
The language of the Gathas, &quot;Gathic&quot; or &quot;Old&quot; Avestan, belongs to the old Iranian language group that is a sub-group of Eastern families of the Indo-European languages. Although arising from the same family, it is still not possible to translate them using Proto Sanskrit or Pali. Sassanid era translations and commentaries (the &quot;Zend&quot;) have been used to interpret the Gathas, but by the 3rd century the Avestan language was virtually extinct, and a dependency on the medieval texts is often discouraged as the commentaries are frequently conjectural. While some scholars argue that an interpretation using younger texts is inadvisable (Geldner, Humbach), others argue that such a view is excessively skeptical (Spiegel, Darmesteter). The risks of misinterpretation are real, but lacking alternates, such dependencies are perhaps necessary.

&quot;The Middle Persian translation seldom offers an appropriate point of departure for a detailed scholarly approach to the Gathas, but an intensive comparison of its single lines and their respective glosses with their Gathic originals usually reveals the train of thought of the translator. This obviously reflects the Gatha interpretation by the priests of the Sasanian period, the general view of which is closer to the original than what is sometimes taught about the Gathas in our time.&quot;

The problems that face a translator of the Avestan Gathas are significant: &quot;No one who has ever read a stanza of [the Gathas] in the original will be under any illusions as to the labour that underlies the effort [of translating the hymns]. The most abstract and perplexing thought, veiled further by archaic language, only half understood by later students of the seer&#x27;s own race and tongue, tends to make the Gathas the hardest problem to be attempted by those who would investigate the literary monuments.&quot;

== Content ==
Some of the verses of the Gathas are directly addressed to the Omniscient Creator Ahura Mazda. These verses, devotional in character, expound on the divine essences of truth (&quot;Asha&quot;), the good-mind (&quot;Vohu Manah&quot;), and the spirit of righteousness. Some other verses are addressed to the public that may have come to hear the prophet, and in these verses, he exhorts his audience to live a life as Ahura Mazda has directed, and pleads to Ahura Mazda to intervene on their behalf.

Other verses, from which some aspects of Zoroaster&#x27;s life have been inferred, are semi-(auto)biographical, but all revolve around Zarathustra&#x27;s mission to promote his view of the Truth (again &quot;Asha&quot;). For instance, some of the passages describe Zarathustra&#x27;s first attempts to promote the teachings of Ahura Mazda, and the subsequent rejection by his kinsmen. This and other rejection led him to have doubts about his message, and in the Gathas he asked for assurance from Ahura Mazda, and requests repudiation of his opponents.

<doc id="562478" wikidata="Q1321757" url="?curid=562478" title="The Secret Life of Us">
<text>The Secret Life of Us is an Australian television drama series set in the beachside neighbourhood of St Kilda, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It is primarily a drama with some comedic moments. The series was produced by Southern Star Group and screened in Australia from 2001 to 2005 on Network Ten and on Channel 4 in the UK. Initially the drama series was co-funded by the two networks. However, Channel 4 pulled out after the third series and the fourth series was not aired in the UK. The series won three silver Logie Awards.

It has been shown in other countries such as New Zealand (TV3) where it is rated R16 for offensive language and sex scenes; Ireland (RTÉ Two), Canada (SuperChannel3), the Netherlands (Yorin), France (Canal Plus, France 4), Estonia (ETV, Kanal 11), Norway (NRK), Serbia (B92, TV Avala), Russia (TNT, Muz TV), Israel (Channel 2), South Africa (M-Net), and the United States (Hulu).

==Plot==
The show revolves around a group of friends in their mid 20s to early 30s who live in a St Kilda block of flats. Their interaction with one another, relationships with other friends, and romantic interests, along with their personal and career developments, are featured.

The actual block is 14A Acland Street, St. Kilda and the rooftop is at the Belvedere Flats on the Esplanade in the same suburb.

==History and popularity==
The series had its genesis in a telemovie; a 22-episode first season was commissioned by the Ten Network before the movie screened. As its popularity rose, issues arose between the show&#x27;s creators and Network Ten, which saw higher ratings when it screened before 9:30. This necessitated cutting scenes with sexual themes.

The inclusion of a prominent Aboriginal character (Kelly Lewis, played by Deborah Mailman) attracted comment at the time of the series&#x27; broadcast, and has since been cited as a landmark in the history of media representations of Indigenous Australians.

The series has been noted as significant for its inclusion of a central, gay coming out narrative in its first season (Richie Blake, played by Spencer McLaren).

The show&#x27;s ratings began to dwindle following the departure of several key actors and the introduction of new characters and cast members. This began in the second season with the departure of Joel Edgerton and Damian De Montemas. It was the third season that featured a particularly high character turnover, and included the departure of key original cast members Claudia Karvan and Abi Tucker.

Five main cast members – Sibylla Budd, Spencer McLaren, Dan Spielman, Nina Liu, and Gigi Edgley – left at the end of season three and original lead Samuel Johnson left early in season four, followed by Michael Dorman three episodes later. Original cast members Deborah Mailman and David Tredinnick continued, and seven new regular characters were added for season four. The changes were part of a larger overhaul which had the arrival of a new producer, a new script producer, and a new writing team.

==Cancellation==
Production ended in 2004 with the completion of the fourth season. The decision had been made to discontinue production after the first three episodes of the fourth season aired in Australia to disastrously low ratings. At that time, the program was removed from its primetime slot. The unscreened episodes from that final season were broadcast with little publicity in late 2005.

<text>The Alutiiq (pronounced in English; from Promyshlenniki Russian Алеутъ, &quot;Aleut&quot;; plural often &quot;Alutiit&quot;), also called by their ancestral name  ( or ; plural often &quot;Sugpiat&quot;), as well as Pacific [[Eskimo]] or Pacific Yupik, are a Yupik peoples, one of eight groups of Alaska Natives that inhabit the southern-central coast of the region.

Their traditional homelands date back to over 7,500 years ago, and include areas such as Prince William Sound and outer Kenai Peninsula (), the Kodiak Archipelago and the Alaska Peninsula (). In the early 1800s there were more than 60 Alutiiq villages in the Kodiak archipelago, with an estimated population of 13,000 people. Today more than 4,000 Alutiiq live in Alaska.

== Terminology ==
At present, the most commonly used title is (singular), (dual), (plural). These terms derive from the names (, ) that the &quot;promyshlenniki&quot; (indigenous Siberian and Russian fur traders and settlers) gave to the native people in the region. Russian occupation began in 1784, following the Awa&#x27;uq Massacre by Grigory Shelikhov, a fur trader, of hundreds of Sugpiat at Refuge Rock () just off the coast of Sitkalidak Island near the present-day village of Old Harbor ().

Given the violence underlying the colonial period, and confusion because the Sugpiaq term for Aleut is , some Alaska Natives from the region have advocated use of the terms that the people themselves use to describe their people and language: (singular), (dual), (plural) — to identify the people (meaning &quot;the real people&quot;), and , or to refer to the language. All three names (Alutiiq, Aleut, and Sugpiaq) are used now, according to personal preference. Over time, many other ethnonyms were used to refer to this people. 

== Culture ==

=== Fishing and subsistence ===
The people traditionally lived a coastal lifestyle, subsisting primarily on ocean resources that were supplemented with rich land resources, such as berries and land mammals. The exact methods of subsistence would change throughout the seasons. &quot;Ugnerkaq&quot;, or spring, was often regarded as the most difficult season to survive in due to the winter&#x27;s limiting of resources. During this time, the Alutiiq would turn to the shore, collecting shellfish, hunting octopuses, and pick greens during low tide. As the season furthered, fish and sea mammals would gradually move closer to shore to feed. Alutiiq would then hook cod and halibut, collect herring eggs, and hunt for seals. As &quot;Kiak&quot;, or summer, approached, activity increased out on the open ocean. Fishing for halibut and cod would continue to remain prevalent, along with the hunting and harvest at seal and sea lion haulouts, and bird rookeries even common feeding grounds for humpback whales. Trees and shrubs such as cedar (&quot;Qar’usiq&quot;; &quot;Qasrulek&quot;, &quot;Thuja plicata&quot;, &quot;Callitropsis nootkatensis&quot;), Kenai birch, Sitka spruce (&quot;Napaq&quot;), and other were harvested for their medical and nutritional value. During this time trade would emerge with the natives of mainland Alaska for materials such as antler, ivory, caribou pelts, and glassy stone, not available on Kodiak. During &quot;Uksuaq&quot;, or fall, much of the work that was done was in preparation for winter. They pick berries sweetened by the first frosts; harvest large quantities of salmon spawning in local streams; hunt fat bears headed for hibernation, and shoot ducks migrating south for the winter. Much of their harvest would be preserved for winter. This was done a variety of ways: from drying, smoking, storing in oil, or freezing foods. During the harsh storms of &quot;Uksuq&quot;, or winter, most of the season would be spent insides, with occasional breaks in the storms allowing for the trapping of foxes and ermine, hunting ducks, or fishing through lake or river ice. While inside, celebrations and festivals would be held in honor of the harvest, and ancestors

=== Housing ===
Before contact with Russian fur traders, they lived in semi-subterranean homes called &quot;ciqlluaq.&quot; Today, in the 21st century, the Alutiiq live in coastal fishing communities in more modern housing. They work in all aspects of the modern economy, while also maintaining the cultural value of subsistence.

=== Cultural arts ===
Traditional Alutiiq art are sources of pride for many as they typically highlight the importance of ancestors, the endurance and preservation of tradition, and the beauty of the natural world that sustain Alutiiq life. Physical medians of expression include &quot;pinguat&quot;–beads (made from shell, bone, ivory, amber, coal, shale, slate and fish vertebrae), woodcarvings in relation to Alutiiq religion, skin sown articles of clothing for celebratory and traditional use, and grass weaving of both artistic expression and functional application. During festivals, story telling, singing and dancing were all important means of passing down history through generations as Alutiiq lacked a formal system of writing.

=== Language ===
In 2010 the high school in Kodiak responded to requests from Alutiiq students and agreed to teach the Alutiiq language. It is one of the Eskaleut languages, belonging to the Yup&#x27;ik branch of these languages. The Kodiak dialect of the language was being spoken by only about 50 persons, all of them elderly, and the dialect was in danger of being lost entirely.

<doc id="562489" wikidata="Q6307083" url="?curid=562489" title="Julian Critchley">
<text>Sir Julian Michael Gordon Critchley (8 December 1930 – 9 September 2000) was a British journalist, author and Conservative Party politician. He was the member of parliament for Rochester and Chatham from 1959 to 1964 and Aldershot from 1970 to 1997.

==Early life==
Born in Islington, the son of distinguished neurologist Macdonald Critchley, CBE (1900–1997) and his first wife, midwife Edna Audleth (née Morris), Critchley was brought up in Swiss Cottage, North London, and in Shropshire, where he attended Brockhurst School, a preparatory school in Church Stretton, and later Shrewsbury School. He returned to London to take his Higher Certificate and was rejected from National Service after contracting polio. After a year living and studying at the Sorbonne in Paris he went up in 1951 to Pembroke College, Oxford, where he read Politics, Philosophy and Economics. In 1953 he was part of a team of Oxford undergraduates lobbying Vickers shipyard workers against nationalisation; the others were Michael Heseltine, Guy Arnold and Martin Morton. In 1955, he married Paula Baron, with whom he had two daughters.

==Political career==

Critchley served as a Conservative Member of Parliament, first for Rochester and Chatham from 1959 to 1964 and then for Aldershot from 1970 until his retirement in 1997. While he was out of Parliament between 1964 and 1970 he worked as a journalist, including as a TV critic for &quot;The Times&quot;, and he continued to be active as a journalist and author throughout the remainder of his career. Having lost Rochester and Chatham in 1964, he stood again for the seat in the 1966 election, but was once again defeated by the Labour candidate Anne Kerr. In 1965, after his first marriage ended in divorce, he married Heather Goodrick, who was close friends with his first wife; they had two children. 

Critchley was considered to be on the left wing of the Conservative Party (one of the &quot;wets&quot; in Thatcherite terminology) and never attained ministerial rank. He became identified as a prominent Tory critic of Margaret Thatcher. In 1980 he sparked controversy by writing an anonymous article in &quot;The Observer&quot; signed &quot;by a Tory&quot;, in which he criticised Thatcher&#x27;s &quot;A level economics&quot; and called her &quot;didactic, tart and obstinate&quot;. He was later forced to admit authorship. He also memorably referred to Thatcher as &quot;the great she-elephant&quot; and claimed responsibility for the currency of the phrase &quot;one of us&quot;, which she used privately to refer to any colleague whom she saw as loyal and supportive of her policies. (It was used by Hugo Young as the title of his biography of Thatcher.) Critchley was, however, supportive of Thatcher&#x27;s stance at the time of the Falklands War.

Critchley was a long-standing friend of Michael Heseltine, having met him first at preparatory school. Both then went on to Shrewsbury and Pembroke College, Oxford, and Critchley was best man at Heseltine&#x27;s wedding. Their friendship waned in the 1960s, but Critchley still supported Heseltine in the 1990 leadership election.

From the early 1990s Critchley became severely restricted in mobility from complications arising from the polio from which he had suffered as a young man. Still, he successfully re-contested Aldershot at the election in 1992. He then became an infrequent attender at the House of Commons until his retirement in 1997. He was knighted in 1995. By this time, his health was in further decline; he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer.

==Later life==

After his retirement he was expelled from the mainstream Conservative party for backing the Pro-Euro Conservative Party in the 1999 European Parliament election. In later life he settled in Shropshire at Ludlow. Having separated from his second wife, he lived with Prue Bellak, with whom he had previously been in a relationship many years earlier, at the Sorbonne; they reunited by chance towards the end of his time as an MP. In 2000, he was further diagnosed with bone cancer and a brain tumour. His health declined steadily and he died in hospital at Hereford on 9 September 2000, at the age of 69. He was buried in the parish churchyard at Wistanstow near Craven Arms.

Critchley became highly regarded as a witty and acerbic political writer and journalist, increasingly so towards the end of his life. His 1994 volume of memoirs, &quot;A Bag of Boiled Sweets&quot;, was described by Jeremy Paxman as &quot;the most entertaining set of political memoirs to have been published in years&quot;. He also wrote two mystery novels set in Parliament, &quot;Hung Parliament&quot; and &quot;Floating Voter&quot;, which feature an MP turned sleuth apparently based on Critchley himself along with a mixture of real and invented MPs, the latter providing the victims and suspects.

<text>The Wahhabi war, also known as the Ottoman–Saudi war, was fought from early 1811 until 1818 between the Ottoman Empire, its vassal the Eyalet of Egypt, and the Emirate of Diriyah, the First Saudi State, resulting in the destruction of the latter.

== Names ==
The war is also referred to by several other names, such as the &quot;Ottoman–Wahhabi war&quot;, &quot;Egyptian–Wahhabi war&quot;, &quot;Egyptian–Saudi war&quot;, &quot;Ottoman/Egyptian–Wahhabi war&quot;, etc.

==Background==
Although Muhammad Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab, the leader of the Wahhabi movement, had indirectly expressed critiques on the Ottoman dynasty in his letters, he had decided not to publicly challenge the legitimacy of the empire as a precautionary measure. Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab did not acknowledge their caliphate claims, an assertion made by Sultan Abdul Hamid I after Ottoman defeat in the 1770s Russo-Turkish war, to portray himself as the leader of Muslim world. However, this did not imply that Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab sought a conflict with Ottomans, as classical Wahhabi doctrines did not view the establishment of caliphate as a necessity upon individual Muslims. Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab was rather alarmed by the erosion of religious morality in neighboring Ottoman vilayets and found fault with the administrative functioning of the Ottoman empire, which he criticized for not properly enforcing &quot;Shari&#x27;ah&quot; (Islamic law) in its territories. The Wahhabis offered an alternative religious and political model to that of the Ottomans and they also claimed Islamic leadership on a different basis.

Political hostilities and distrust would eventually lead the Wahhabis and the Ottomans to declare mutual exchanges of &quot;Takfir&quot; (excommunication), many years after Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab&#x27;s death. By the 1790s, the &quot;Muwahhidun&quot; had consolidated their rule over most regions of Central Arabia. The growing Wahhabi influence alarmed Ghaleb, the Sharif of Mecca, who responded by initiating warfare with the Saudis in 1793; until his surrender in 1803. Intending to form an armed coalition to defeat the &quot;Muwahhidun&quot;, he corresponded with the Ottoman authorities in Istanbul and sought to turn them hostile against his rivals by portraying them as disbelievers. Similar overtures were also made by the ruler of Baghdad. Such reports eventually succeeded in turning the Ottoman bureaucratic opinion significantly hostile against the Wahhabis. In 1797, Sulayman the Great, the Mamluk governor of Iraq, invaded Diriyah with around 15,000 troops in co-ordination with Ghalib and laid a one-month siege to Al-Ahsa. However, re-inforcements led by Saud ibn &#x27;Abd al-Azeez would force the Ottomans to retreat. After three days of skirmish, Sulayman the Great and the Saudis came to a peace settlement which was to last for six years. However, the peace would be broken in 1801, when a caravan of pilgrims protected by a Saudi convoy was plundered near Hail; upon orders from the Mamluk administration in Baghdad. This attack would completely break down the already deteriorating Saudi-Ottoman diplomatic relations, and the Emirate of Dirʿiyya sent a large-scale expedition towards Iraq.

In 1802, 12,000 Wahhabis sacked Karbala in Iraq killing up to 5,000 people and plundering the Imam Husayn shrine. Saudi forces led by &#x27;Abd al Aziz entered Mecca in 1803 after defeating Ghalib. The assassination in November 1803 of Saudi Emir &#x27;Abd al-&#x27;Aziz during prayers in al-Dir&#x27;iyya by an Iraqi; was suspected of being orchestrated by the Mamluk governor of Baghdad, which greatly deteriorated the Saudi-Ottoman relations. Ghalib had worked hard to dampen the prospects of reconciliation between the Emirate of Diriyah and Ottoman Empire. In the ensuing conflict, the Wahhabis had controlled Mecca and Medina by 1805. The Saudi emir denounced the Ottoman sultan and called into question the validity of his claim to be caliph and guardian of the sanctuaries of the Hejaz. The Wahhabis also attacked Ottoman trade caravans which interrupted Ottoman finances.

In response, the Ottoman sultan, Mahmud II, ordered Muhammad &#x27;Ali, governor of Egypt, to attack the Wahhabi state in December 1807. Ali had embarked on an extensive modernisation program that included a significant expansion of Egypt&#x27;s military forces. The Ottomans had grown increasingly wary of Ali&#x27;s reign. ordering him to go to war with the Wahhabi state would serve their interests regardless as the destruction of either would be beneficial to them. Tensions between Ali and his troops also prompted him to send them to Arabia and fight against the Wahhabi movement where many would die. Events within Egypt delayed delayed the expedition until 1811.

==Campaigns==
In 1811, the Ottomans landed in Yanbu and took over the city after a bloodless confrontation in the Battle of Yanbu where all Saudi forces surrendered. The Ottoman troops then moved south to attempt a recapture of Medina, however the Ottomans were decisively defeated at the Battle of Al-Safra in 1812. 5,000 Ottoman troops were killed by the Saudis who successfully defended the area. The Ottomans were forced to retreat back to Yanbu. Muhammad Ali Pasha sent 20,000 troops to help Tusun Pasha recapture Medina. The Ottomans successfully captured the city after the Battle of Medina in November 1812. This combined force captured from the Saudi forces the city of Jeddah, In January 1813, Ottoman troops captured Mecca.

In 1815, one of the main rebels, Bakhroush bin Alass of Zahran tribe, was killed and beheaded by Muhammad Ali forces in Al Qunfudhah. In the spring of 1815, Ottoman forces inflicted large-scale defeat upon the Saudis, forcing them to conclude a peace treaty. Under the terms of treaty, the Saudis had to let go of Hijaz. Abdullah ibn Saud was forced to acknowledge himself as the vassal of the Ottoman Empire and obey the Turkish Sultan unquestionably. However, neither Muhammad Ali nor the Ottoman Sultan had confirmed the treaty.
Suspicious of Abdullah, the Wahhabi Emir, the Ottomans resumed the war in 1816, with the assistance of French military instructors. The Egyptian troops were led by Muhammad Ali&#x27;s elder son, Ibrahim Pasha, and penetrated into the heart of Central Arabia, besieging the chief centres of Qasim and Najd. Waging a war of extermination between 1816 and 1818, the invading armies pillaged various towns and villages, forcing the inhabitants to flee and seek refuge in remote regions and oases. By 1817, the armies had overrun Rass, Buraida and Unayza. Saudi armies put up a fierce resistance at Al-Rass where they withstood a siege of 3 months. Faced with the advance of Egyptian Ottomans, Abdullah, the Saudi Emir retreated to Diriya.

The Ottomans began the Najd Expedition in 1818, involving a series of military conflicts. En route to Dariyya, the Ottoman armies executed everyone over ten years age in Dhurma. Ibrahim&#x27;s forces would march towards Diriyya during the early months of 1818, easily routing Saudi resistances and arrive at the capital by April 1818. The Siege of Diriyah would last until September 1818, with the Ottoman forces waiting for Saudi supplies to run out. On 11 September 1818, Abdullah Ibn Saud would sue for peace, offering his surrender, in exchange for sparing Diriyya. However, Al Diriyya would be razed to ground under orders of Ibrahim Pasha.

It was not until September 1818 that the Wahhabi state ended with the surrendering of its leaders and the head of the Wahhabi state, Abdullah bin Saud, who was sent to Istanbul to be executed. Thus, the Emirate of Diriyah formally ended with the surrendering of its leaders and the head of the Wahhabi state, Abdullah bin Saud, was taken captive and sent to Istanbul. In December, Emir Abdullah ibn Saud was executed with the public display of his corpse, upon the orders of the Ottoman Sultan.

The British Empire welcomed Ibrahim Pasha&#x27;s siege of Diriyah with the goal of promoting trade interests in the region. Captain George Forster Sadleir, an officer of the British Army in India was dispatched from Bombay to consult with Ibrahim Pasha in Dariyya.

== Aftermath ==

George Forster Sadleir left a record on the aftermath of the former capital of the First Saudi state:

&quot;The site of Deriah is in a deep ravine north-west of Munfooah, about ten miles distant. It is now in ruins, and the inhabitants who were spared, or escaped from the slaughter, have principally sought shelter here ... Munfooah ... was surrounded with a wall and ditch which the Pacha ordered to be razed ... Riad is not so well peopled ... The inhabitants were at that time in a more wretched state than at any prior period since the establishment of the power of the Wahabees. Their walls, the chief security for their property, had been razed ... The year&#x27;s crop had been consumed by the Turkish force&quot;Saudi ruler &#x27;Abdullah ibn Saud was transported first to Cairo and then to Istanbul, wherein he was beheaded alongside several other Wahhabi &quot;Imams&quot;. Other than &#x27;Abdullah, most of the political leaders were treated well but the Ottomans were far harsher with the religious leaders that inspired the Wahhabi movement, executing Sūlayman ibn &#x27;Abd Allah Aal-Shaykh and other religious notables, as they were thought to be uncompromising in their beliefs and therefore a much bigger threat than political leaders. The executions were also motivated by Ottoman resentment of Wahhabist views.

After the Destruction of Diriyya, Ibrahim Pasha rounded up the prominent survivors of the Saudi family and the scholarly Al ash-Sheikh many of whom were deported to Egypt. As per Ottoman estimates, over 250 members related to the Saudi family and 32 members related to the Al ash-Sheikh were exiled. Ottomans were far harsher with the religious leaders that inspired the Wahhabi movement, than with the members of the Saudi family. Prominent scholars such as the &quot;Qadi&quot; of Dir&#x27;iyya, Sulayman ibn &#x27;Abd Allah (the grandson of Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhaab) were tortured, forced to listen to guitar (knowing the Najdi prescriptions and customs that prohibited music) and executed by a firing-squad. Other &quot;ulema&quot; such as Abd Allah ibn Muhammad Aal Al-Shaikh and his nephew Abd al Rahman ibn Hasan Aal Al-Shaikh would be exiled to Egypt. (the latter would return to Najd in 1825, to revive and lead the Wahhabi movement). Some other &quot;Qadis&quot; and scholars were hunted down and executed. Abd al Aziz ibn Hamad al Mu&#x27;ammar managed to settle in Bahrain, where the ruler welcomed him. Few scholars managed to escape to the remote Southern corners of Arabia. The executions reflected the deep Ottoman resentment of Wahhabi movement and also how seriously they viewed its threat. Altogether, the Najdis lost about two dozen scholars and men from the &quot;ulema&quot; families in the aftermath of the invasion. However, the suppression of Wahhabites in Central Arabia ultimately proved to be a failed campaign.

Later, Ibrahim Pasha and his troops went on to conquer Qatif and el-Hasa. Remnants of Saudi fortifications were demolished across Najd. Emir&#x27;s relatives and important Wahhabi leaders were made captives and sent to Egypt. In December 1819, Ibrahim Pasha returned to Egypt after formally incorporating Hejaz into the Ottoman Empire. However, they were unable to totally subdue the opposition forces and Central Arabia became a region of permanent Wahhabi uprisings. In the 1820s, Prince Turki ibn &#x27;Abd Allah ibn Muhammed ibn Saud, gathering growing support from tribes and groups that opposed the Turkish occupation, would lay Siege to Riyadh in 1823. By August 1824, Saudi forces would capture Riyadh in a Second Siege, thus establishing the Second Saudi State with Riyadh as its capital.

Following the fall of Emirate of Dirʿiyya, the British empire launched their Persian Gulf campaign of 1819. A formidable force consisting of 2,800 British soldiers and 3 warships fought the Qasimi tribesmen allied to Dir&#x27;iyya. Their city Ras al Khaimah was demolished in 1819. The General Maritime treaty was concluded in 1820 with the local chieftains, which would eventually transform them into a protectorate of Trucial States; heralding a century of British supremacy in the Gulf.

This war had formed the basic hatred of the Wahhabi movement amongst the Ottomans, and continues to influence modern Turkey wherein many Turkish Islamic preachers consider Wahhabism to be un-Islamic. The Saudis, who would form the nation a century later, considered it as the first struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire, and continued to view Turkey with suspicion. The current state of Saudi-Turkey relations are still influenced by this hostile past. To the present day, both Saudi and Turkish nationalist writers accuse each other of engaging in systematic campaigns to rewrite history.

<doc id="562505" wikidata="Q385841" url="?curid=562505" title="The McCoys">
<text>The McCoys were a rock group formed in Union City, Indiana, United States, in 1962. They are best known for their 1965 hit single &quot;Hang On Sloopy&quot;. Originally named Rick and the Raiders, they changed their name to &quot;The McCoys&quot; from the B-side of The Ventures&#x27; hit record &quot;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run&quot; titled &quot;The McCoy&quot;.

==Career==
The original members were all from Union City; however, the Zehringer boys were initially from Fort Recovery, Ohio. The band members were guitarist and lead singer Richard Zehringer (later known as Rick Derringer), his brother Randy (later known as Randy Z) on drums, and bassist Dennis Kelly. This first line-up was known as The Rick Z Combo, and later known as Rick and the Raiders. When Kelly left for college, the Zehringers were joined by bassist Randy Jo Hobbs, saxophonist Sean Michaels, and keyboardist Ronnie Brandon. This was the line-up that took the name of &quot;The McCoys&quot;. Brandon left the group in 1965 and was replaced by Bobby Peterson on keyboards.

Their best-known hit is &quot;Hang On Sloopy&quot;, which was #1 in the United States in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in October 1965 and is the official rock song of the state of Ohio. It also is the unofficial fight song of the Ohio State Buckeyes and is played at many Ohio State athletic events by the OSU bands. Sales of the single in the US alone were over one million copies. Other hits include a top 10 cover of &quot;Fever&quot; (&quot;Billboard&quot; #7) and a top 40 cover of Ritchie Valens&#x27;s &quot;Come On, Let&#x27;s Go&quot; (&quot;Billboard&quot; #21).

A cover of &quot;Sorrow&quot;, the B-side of their version of &quot;Fever&quot;, was a hit in the United Kingdom for The Merseys and later covered by David Bowie. Its opening line, &quot;with your long blonde hair and eyes of blue&quot; was quoted by George Harrison in the fadeout of &quot;It&#x27;s All Too Much&quot;, featured on the 1969 soundtrack of &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;.

&quot;The McCoys&quot; performed as part of Murray the K&#x27;s Christmas show on December 18, 1965 at the Brooklyn Fox Theater. Also performing on the program were Peter &amp; Gordon, Wilson Pickett, The Fortunes, the Moody Blues, The Toys, Lenny Welch, Cannibal and the Headhunters, The Vibrations, The Spinners, The O&#x27;Jays, Bloodless Revolutionaries, Patti Michaels, Bobby Diamond, and Diane Langan.

The McCoys were being labeled as a bubblegum pop act, much to the disdain of the band. In 1967, after the death of Bert Berns, The McCoys broke free from Bang Records in hopes of recording more serious music. They ended up signing a deal with Mercury Records and recorded their last two records, &quot;Infinite McCoys&quot; (1968) and &quot;Human Ball&quot; (1969), for the label. The albums were The McCoys&#x27; attempt at making psychedelic music that would appeal to the mature listeners of that time. Both were commercial failures and did not chart anywhere.

The two Zehringer brothers (then known as Rick Derringer and Randy Z) and Hobbs became Johnny Winter&#x27;s band for the albums &quot;Johnny Winter And&quot; and &quot;Live Johnny Winter And&quot; in 1970 and 1971 respectively. At first, the band was supposed to be called Johnny Winter &amp; The McCoys, but was changed due to management warning Winter about their bubblegum past, and how it could hurt his reputation as a serious musician. As backing musicians, both Derringer and Hobbs contributed to Winter&#x27;s later releases &quot;Still Alive and Well&quot; (1973), &quot;Saints &amp; Sinners&quot; (1974), and &quot;John Dawson Winter III&quot; (1974). Derringer and Hobbs later played with Edgar Winter as well as appeared on &quot;&quot; (1976). Hobbs later toured with Johnny Winter, but without Derringer, on Winter&#x27;s &quot;Captured Live!&quot; (1976). Derringer also played with Steely Dan and Cyndi Lauper and formed bands such as DNA, with drummer Carmine Appice.

Hobbs died of drug-related heart failure on 5 August 1993 (Derringer&#x27;s birthday) at the age of 45. Peterson died in Gainesville, Florida on 21 July 1993 at the age of 47.

<text>CHMI-DT (channel 13) is a television station licensed to Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, Canada, broadcasting the Citytv network to the Winnipeg area. Owned and operated by Rogers Sports &amp; Media, the station has studios at 8 Forks Market Road (near Fort Gibraltar Trail and Waterfront Drive) in downtown Winnipeg, and its transmitter is located adjacent to Bohn Road (near Provincial Road 245) in Cartier.

CHMI signed on the air in 1986 as the Manitoba Television Network (MTN) by Craig Broadcast Systems. Broadcasting from studios downtown in the historic Canadian National Railway Power House at The Forks, it was the first new commercial TV station in Winnipeg since 1975. The station then joined the A-Channel system in 1999; its style of news and programming was young and aggressive. Ratings settled into third place, above the CBC but behind the established stations in town, CKY and CKND.

Craig, overextended by its launch of Toronto 1 in 2003, sold itself to CHUM Limited, then-owner of Citytv, in 2004. In 2005, the A-Channel stations took on the Citytv brand. Due to poor ratings and as part of a wave of layoffs, CHUM reduced the size of its local operation in Winnipeg in 2006, cancelling the station&#x27;s evening newscast. CHUM sold most of its assets to Bell Globemedia that same year; as Bell owned the CTV Television Network, the Citytv stations were spun off to Rogers and for a brief period, it was paired with religious station CIIT (Omni 11) before being sold to S-VOX in 2008. The station continued producing a morning newscast under the &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; brand until 2015 when it was replaced with a simulcast of CITI-FM&#x27;s morning show and reinstated evening local news programs in 2017.

==Craig Media==
===MTN===
In August 1980, Western Manitoba Broadcasters Ltd., owner of Brandon-based CKX-TV, met with community and business leaders to reveal their plan to start a new Portage la Prairie-based television station, with transmitter in Elie, Manitoba. The new station would employ about 20 people. There was no mention of what network it would connect to, but Craig hoped for ease of regulations that would allow him to pull in a network from the U.S. via satellite for programming. Originally some of the television programming would come from CBC Television, as like CKX, but after the CBC said they would not allow another competitive CBC broadcaster in the region because it would duplicate and cannibalize ad revenue of CBWT, Western Manitoba Broadcasters withdrew this part of the application.

An application was made in 1981 for a 287,000-watt station transmitting on VHF channel 13. Their application for a television license was denied by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) in 1981 due to &quot;vague&quot; programming promises.

When CKND-TV applied to the CRTC for extension of their signal into the Westman area via a transmitter in Minnedosa, CKX-TV filed an intervention opposing it, saying it would harm CKX&#x27;s ad revenue. The regulatory body decided in CKX&#x27;s favour. Despite this, CKND-TV-2 Minnedosa was granted a license and began broadcasting at 6 p.m. September 1, 1982.

Western Manitoba Broadcasters Ltd. applied to the CRTC again in 1985, this time promising to create a larger news department, with news bureaus in Winnipeg, Portage, Brandon and Dauphin. They intended on using call letters CPLP-TV, but later decided on CHMI-TV. The station would be seen on VHF channel 13, the last available clear channel in the region. Future licensed television stations would have to broadcast on UHF frequencies. The licensing hearing was held on December 3, 1985, in Winnipeg.

The station was licensed by the CRTC on May 8, 1986, and owned by Craig Media with a condition of licence that the station would not solicit advertising from businesses located in Winnipeg. This was to protect existing Winnipeg television stations. The station went on the air on October 17, 1986 where it was originally branded as the &quot;Manitoba Television Network&quot; or &quot;MTN&quot;. Although it has always been a Winnipeg station for all intents and purposes, for its first decade it was not allowed to sell advertising in Winnipeg.

Mark Evans was initially MTN&#x27;s news director, before being replaced a year later by Al Thorgeirson.
MTN was well known for its &quot;Prairie Pulse News&quot; (later retitled &quot;MTN Pulse News&quot;, and then &quot;MTN News&quot;), &quot;MTN Kids Club&quot;, and &quot;Prime Ticket Movies&quot;, the last of which would carry over to the A-Channel system. The station&#x27;s initial slogan was &quot;Very independent, very Manitoba!&quot;

===A-Channel===

In the fall of 1999, Craig Media moved the station&#x27;s production facilities to the refurbished former Canadian National Railway Power House at The Forks in Winnipeg and rebranded the station as A-Channel, joining CKEM-TV in Edmonton and CKAL-TV in Calgary—effectively uniting Craig&#x27;s non-CBC affiliates under the A-Channel banner. Technical operations for the station remained in Portage la Prairie.

At a CRTC hearing in Saskatoon in November 1999, Craig Broadcast Systems applied to take over the IMTV transmitter located in Dauphin on VHF channel 6. The signal would extend CHMI&#x27;s reach into the Parkland region with a 44,000 watt signal. The former IMTV transmitter began broadcasting A-Channel in 2000.

===Acquisition by CHUM===
On April 12, 2004, CHUM Limited announced a deal to purchase Craig Media for $265 million. The move came more than a month after the CRTC denied CHUM&#x27;s applications for new Calgary and Edmonton stations because the market did not have sufficient advertising revenue to support a new entrant. The sale was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on November 19, 2004. CHUM had to sell off Toronto 1 because it already owned stations in Toronto (CITY) and nearby Barrie (CKVR); Toronto 1 was sold to Quebecor Media, owners of the media units TVA and Sun Media.

==Citytv==
===Rebrand and news cuts===
In addition to launching The Bounce and becoming the sole owner of Access Media Group in February 2005 in Albea, CHUM announced that it would rebrand the three A-Channel stations—in Calgary, Edmonton, and Winnipeg—as Citytv, aligning with the stations it already owned in Toronto and Vancouver. No other significant changes were made, since the A-Channel stations&#x27; on-air look had always been very similar to that of Citytv; they initially retained their local programs, relaunched under Citytv&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; morning brand and &quot;CityNews&quot; news brand. CHUM hoped to lift the stations&#x27; ratings with the new moniker. The change took effect on August 2 of the same year, when the A-Channel name was transferred to CHUM&#x27;s NewNet stations.

On June 13, 2006, CHUM announced that it would dramatically reduce its newsgathering operations in Edmonton, Calgary, and Winnipeg, as well as in several other cities. It laid off 195 part- and full-time employees. The evening newscasts were cancelled, while the noon newscast and &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; remained on the air. In a coincidental development, that same day, BCE Inc., the parent company of CTV, announced it would buy CHUM Limited.

===Under Rogers ownership===
The CRTC announced its approval of CTVglobemedia&#x27;s purchase of CHUM Limited on June 8, 2007, but the commission added a condition that CTVglobemedia sell off CHUM&#x27;s Citytv stations to another buyer while allowing it to retain the A-Channel stations. The CRTC was not willing to allow CTV-Citytv twinsticks. The following Monday, Rogers Communications agreed to buy the five Citytv stations. The sale was approved by the CRTC on September 28, 2007, and Was completed on October 31, 2007. For a short period, it was paired with sister station, CIIT-TV (Omni 11 Winnipeg), a religious Omni station, before it was sold to S-VOX in 2008.

Between October 2012 and 2018, the station began branding itself on promos and on-screen logos as &quot;City&quot;, removing the &quot;tv&quot; portion from its identification. Since 2018, they have reverted to the original &quot;Citytv&quot; branding.

==News operation==
When 13MTN began broadcasting in 1986, two local newscasts were presented, one at 5:30 to 6:30 p.m., the other newscast from 10 to 11 p.m. Both programs were called &quot;Prairie Pulse Tonight&quot;. The first two news anchors were Michael Gligor and Barbara Higgins. Ron Thompson presented the weather forecast from Brandon&#x27;s CKX studio via a live coaxial cable video link to the Portage studio leased from MTS. Ted Deller replaced Gligor in 1987–88. Diana Ottasen replaced Barbara Higgins. Sports anchor was Keith McMahon.

CHMI-DT currently broadcasts 14 hours of local news, which consists of hour-long broadcasts daily at 6 and 11 p.m. since September 4, 2017. CityNews programs previously aired until July 12, 2006, when it was announced that CTVglobemedia would acquire then-owner CHUM Limited. CHMI also aired a local version of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; until 2015, when it was discontinued and replaced with a television simulcast of sister radio station CITI-FM&#x27;s morning show &quot;Wheeler in the Morning&quot;. Former &quot;BT&quot; hosts Drew Kozub and Jenna Khan remained as contributors, hosting television-exclusive news and entertainment segments.

==Technical information==
===Subchannel===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
On August 31, 2011, when Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts, CHMI-TV flash cut its digital signal into operation on VHF channel 13.

<doc id="562511" wikidata="Q3489375" url="?curid=562511" title="USS Oakland (CL-95)">
<text>USS &quot;Oakland&quot; (CL-95), was a modified light cruiser, the first of a group of four sometimes referred to as the &quot;&quot;Oakland&quot;-class&quot;. She was laid down by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, San Francisco, California, on 15 July 1941; launched on 23 October 1942; sponsored by Dr. Aurelia Henry Reinhardt, president of Mills College, Oakland, California; and commissioned on 17 July 1943. She was named for the city of Oakland, California. Like the &quot;Atlanta&quot; class, the &quot;Oakland&quot; class was designed as an anti-aircraft cruiser, with a main battery of dual-purpose guns, the principal difference between the two classes being that the Oakland-class did not have the Atlanta class&#x27;s two-beam twin 5 in (127 mm)/38 cal gun turrets. They were removed for the sake of stability and the limited arcs of fire experienced by the wing turrets on the Atlantas. 
&quot;Oakland&quot; sustained three casualties during World War II.

== Service history ==

=== World War II ===
==== 1943 ====
Following a shakedown and training cruise off San Diego in the summer of 1943, &quot;Oakland&quot; sailed back to Pearl Harbor arriving on 3 November. Joining with three heavy cruisers and two destroyers, she linked up with Task Group 50.3 (TG 50.3) near Funafuti in the Ellice Islands, for support of Operation Galvanic, the amphibious push into the Gilbert Islands. The carriers launched initial air strikes against Kwajalein Atoll on 19 November. More than fifty Japanese G4M torpedo bombers were left intact on Kwajalein, yet despite objections of the involved air crews the carriers failed to follow up on the raid. This inaction allowed the previously identified wing of torpedo bombers from Kwajalein to attack the formation during the evening and night of the 20th. In this action, the skipper of the &quot;Oakland&quot; asked for clearance to fall back from the formation and activate &quot;Oakland&quot;’s running lights in order to draw the attention away from the task force. The ploy succeeded, and the &quot;Oakland&quot; scored two kills and two assists in fighting off the raiders.

On 26 November, northeast of the Marshall Islands, &quot;Oakland&quot; again fought off strong coordinated torpedo plane attacks. At 2332 on 4 December, a torpedo tore into the side of , damaging steering control and &quot;Oakland&quot; covered her slow withdrawal, arriving Pearl Harbor on 9 December.

==== 1944 ====
&quot;Oakland&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 16 January 1944 with the carriers of TG 58.1 headed for the Marshall Islands. The task group launched strikes against Maloelap on 29 January and against Kwajalein on the 30th. An amphibious assault was made on Kwajalein on 1 February. &quot;Oakland&quot; with her carriers supported American operations ashore until they entered Majuro Lagoon on 4 February.

Weighing anchor on 12 February, the ships of TG 58.1 sailed from Majuro and launched air strikes against Truk on 16–17 February, greatly damaging the important Japanese naval base there.

Then, despite a night-long series of Japanese aerial attacks on 21–22 February, to hit the Marianas with damaging blows, &quot;Oakland&quot;″s gunners bagged two more enemy planes and assisted in splashing two others before returning to Majuro.

&quot;Oakland&quot; sortied with TG 58.1 on 7 March, bound for Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides. The group skirted the Solomons and covered the occupation of Emirau Island, north of New Britain, on the 20th. On the 27th, the task group swept on to the western Carolines. Heavy air attacks greeted the carriers, but &quot;Oakland&quot; and her partners in the screen fought them off before any damage was incurred. They pounded Palau on 30 March, Yap on the 31st and Woleai on 1 April, before returning to Majuro on 6 April.

Through April the group carried out similar operations at Wake Island and Samar. They again hammered Truk on the 29th-30th, as well as hitting Satawan on the later date. Allied surface and aerial bombardment battered Ponape on 1 May, before &quot;Oakland&quot; retired to Kwajalein on 4 May.

Following anti-aircraft training, &quot;Oakland&quot; helped to attack Guam on 11 June, then steamed north to hit the Volcano and Bonin Islands by the 14th.

West of the embattled Marianas, Task Force 58 (TF 58) sped to intercept a large Japanese surface force approaching from the Philippines. In the ensuing Battle of the Philippine Sea, the famed &quot;Turkey Shoot&quot; took place as US planes decimated the trained air groups of three Japanese carrier divisions, almost eliminating Japanese naval aviation.

Toward the end of the battle, as darkness was creeping in, the returning American pilots were scanning the sea for their carriers. Admiral Mitscher, on the bridge of his flagship, concerned about his men, gave the order &quot;Turn on the lights.&quot; In response, &quot;Oakland&quot;″s searchlights were turned on, helping to light up the Philippine Sea.

TG 58.1 next struck at Pagan Island on 23 June and Iwo Jima the next day. On the 27th, the units gathered at Eniwetok Atoll for replenishment, and on the 30th nosed northwest to the Bonin Islands. The group delivered a withering air-sea bombardment against Iwo and Chichi Jima on 3–4 July, and by the 5th was speeding south for a return engagement in the Marianas.

On 7 July, the carriers began launching a series of alternating strikes against Guam and Rota. &quot;Oakland&quot; and teamed up to recover downed pilots off Guam, and fired at targets on Orote Peninsula.

At 0800 on 4 August, search planes reported a Japanese convoy zig-zagging out of Chichi Jima Bonin Islands. Two hours later, the carriers&#x27; planes reported they were attacking enemy vessels. An attack group was quickly formed, consisting of &quot;Oakland&quot;, , and , and Destroyer Division 91.

Detached from the task group at 1241, the killer band raced at between Ototo and Yome Jima and arrived on the scene at about 1730. The destroyers formed an attack group ahead of the cruisers and, at 1845, sank a small oiler. Another straggler from the convoy, later identified as the destroyer &quot;Matsu&quot;, was sighted at 1924 and subsequently sunk.

At 2145, &quot;Oakland&quot; and company contacted a 7500-ton supply ship and sank her, before turning south to rake Chichi Jima. &quot;Oakland&quot; made three runs shelling shipping in Chichi&#x27;s harbor of Funtami Ko, and helped to silence a shore battery before she retired at 1119 on 5 August. Several Japanese ships had been sunk, a seaplane base damaged, and fires started among the wharves and warehouses.

From 6–8 September, &quot;Oakland&quot;″s task group hit the Palau Islands, Peleliu being the main target. On the evening of the 8th, they steamed west to raid enemy airfields in the Philippines through the 22nd.

On 6 October, &quot;Oakland&quot; departed Ulithi shepherding her own carriers toward the Ryukyu Islands and hit Okinawa on the 10th. They attacked installations on Formosa and the Pescadores on 12 October and, at 1835, as they were withdrawing, fought off Japanese air counterattack.

They hit Formosa again on 13 October, and again the Imperial Air Force lashed out in full fury as the task force withdrew at nightfall. &quot;Oakland&quot; assisted in turning back the aerial opponents but, at 1835, in TG 38.1 was damaged by a torpedo, and on the 14th received a torpedo hit. &quot;Oakland&quot; then covered the withdrawal of the two hit ships, before participating in the strikes against Luzon from 17–19 October and supporting the landings on Leyte the 20th.

En route to Ulithi on the 24th, &quot;Oakland&quot; received orders to backtrack at once to help stop the Japanese Fleet which was converging on Leyte Gulf. By the time she arrived on the scene, the enemy had been repulsed, and the carriers began long range strikes against the retreating enemy. The Battle for Leyte Gulf was essentially the end of the Imperial Navy as an effective fighting force.

From November–December, &quot;Oakland&quot; operated with various task groups of TF 38 supporting the Philippine liberation campaign. On 18 December, she rode out a raging typhoon in the Philippine Sea escaping serious damage.

==== 1945 ====
&quot;Oakland&quot; returned to San Francisco on 11 January 1945. She remained for repairs and trial runs until sailing for Hawaii on 4 March. Arriving Pearl Harbor on the 9th, &quot;Oakland&quot; began additional training south of Oahu. She received movement orders on the 14th and sailed for Ulithi, the staging area for Okinawa.

Reaching Ulithi on 30 March, she sailed again with other units the following day. On tap was the most ambitious amphibious assault of the Pacific war. On 2 April, the group separated, &quot;Oakland&quot; going ahead to join TG 58.4. For five days, she engaged in hitting Sakashima Gunto in the southern Nansei Shoto and then proceeded to Okinawa.

On 10 April, &quot;Oakland&quot; was reassigned to TG 58.3 for the remainder of the Okinawa campaign. She came under air attack again on 11 April with her gunners splashing a dive bomber.

With other groups of TF 58, &quot;Oakland&quot; moved northward on 15 April to launch strikes against airfields at Kyūshū. Enemy planes tried time and again to pierce the task force&#x27;s protective fighter umbrella. Twice &quot;Oakland&quot;″s guns opened up, aiding in the destruction of one &quot;Frances&quot; and driving off another.

Okinawan defenses were struck again on the 17th. &quot;Kamikazes&quot; evaded the combat air patrol in the morning and &quot;Oakland&quot; took two under fire as they passed over the ship. Both were dropped within the formation, with &quot;Oakland&quot; scoring one. On the 29th, &quot;Oakland&quot; drove away another enemy aircraft. TG 58.3 had taken the best the Imperial Air Force had to offer during 11 days of April. The rest of the month was utilized in making additional strikes against Okinawa and conducting gunnery exercises with drones and towed sleeves.

Snooper planes began winging near the group early in the morning on 11 May. After breakfast, the &quot;Oakland&quot; crew scrambled to General Quarters but an attack failed to materialize at that time. Two &quot;kamikazes&quot; plummeted into the flight deck of from the cruiser. A trio of life rafts were cut loose from &quot;Oakland&quot; to aid in the rescue of &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; survivors sighted ahead.

The task force struck again at airfields on Kyūshū on 13 May. On the 14th, the Japanese reciprocated. Shortly after breakfast, a lone Zero was spotted circling through the clouds and &quot;Oakland&quot;″s guns quickly opened fire, but their quarry just as quickly disappeared from view. Then he came back like a comet. bore the brunt of his crash-dive as he blew up in a blossom of flame on her flight deck.

Shortly, a flock of &quot;kamikazes&quot; appeared, and within the space of 15 minutes, &quot;Oakland&quot; took four separate &quot;kamikazes&quot; under fire. &quot;Oakland&quot;″s claim of two assists was substantiated by the task group commander.

For the duration of May, &quot;Oakland&quot; remained with the task group off Okinawa. On the 29th she shifted back to TG 38.1 under Admiral Halsey and made for Leyte Gulf, anchoring in San Pedro Bay on 1 June.

On 10 July, TG 38.1 commenced raids on the Japanese mainland beginning with Honshū and then thundering north to Hokkaidō. From 17–20 July, &quot;Oakland&quot; participated in strikes against Tokyo and 24–27 July against Kure and Kobe. Tokyo was hit again on the 30th along with Nagoya. On 7 August, the ships turned north to strike the Honshū-Hokkaido area for a second time. 15 August brought the long-awaited &quot;cease all offensive operations&quot; order. &quot;Oakland&quot; then proceeded to her assigned operating area for the occupation of Japan.

She moved to Tokyo Bay on 30 August and, while anchored near the Yokosuka Naval Base. Berthed several thousand yards away from , &quot;Oakland&quot; provided a box seat for her sailors to witness the unforgettable climax to their war.

=== Post-war ===
While &quot;Oakland&quot; lay at anchor in Tokyo Bay on the night of 27 September, a typhoon swept close to the harbor entrance. A tanker dragged anchor and struck &quot;Oakland&quot;″s bow, causing minor damage.

On 1 October, &quot;Oakland&quot; sailed for Okinawa to embark homeward bound veterans for a &quot;magic carpet&quot; voyage to San Francisco. Leaving Okinawa on 3 October, she arrived at San Francisco on 20 October. Navy Day (27 October) observances at Oakland, California, were highlighted by the presence of &quot;Oakland&quot;. &quot;Magic carpet&quot; duty in November and December took &quot;Oakland&quot; back to the Pacific twice, first to Eniwetok and then to Kwajalein. At the year&#x27;s end, the Navy turned the task of bringing home the veterans solely over to its transportation service, and &quot;Oakland&quot; was ordered to an inactivation area at Bremerton, Washington.

Reprieve came in the form of a change in orders and, instead of inactivation, &quot;Oakland&quot; was slated to continue as an active postwar fleet unit. A thorough overhaul was afforded her at the Puget Sound Navy Yard to erase the effects of long months of battle.

On 6 January 1947, &quot;Oakland&quot; got underway for her first post-war cruise to the Far East. After a stop at Pearl Harbor on the 14th, the light cruiser conducted a two-month fleet exercise in the Marianas and Marshall Islands, visiting Guam, Saipan and Kwajalein before returning to Pearl Harbor on 11 March. Instead of returning to San Diego, however, &quot;Oakland&quot; was ordered east to China, where American support for the Nationalist Chinese in the Civil War against the communist Chinese was growing following the collapse of mediation efforts. Arriving at Tsing-tao on 30 March, &quot;Oakland&quot; became the flagship of Capt. Sherman R. Clark, commander, Destroyer Flotilla Three. The light cruiser operated out of that port and Shanghai, for the next three months, conducting almost a dozen patrols in the East China Sea. Tensions were particularly high in May, as communist forces threatened the U.S. consulate at Peking, and American forces in China were placed on high alert. As part of that response, &quot;Oakland&quot; supplied a small landing force of sailors to help out the Marines in Tsing-tao. Tensions eased in June and the light cruiser departed China on 20 July, stopping at Yokosuka and Pearl Harbor before arriving at San Diego on 8 August.

On 18 March, &quot;Oakland&quot; was reclassified CLAA-95. On 1 July 1949, &quot;Oakland&quot; decommissioned at San Francisco. Struck on 1 March 1959, she was sold to Louis Simons on 1 December for scrapping. Scrapping was completed by the end of 1962.

&quot;Oakland&quot;″s mast and nameplate were restored and given to the city of Oakland. In July 2002, they were installed in the Port of Oakland&#x27;s Middle Harbor Shoreline Park, on the western waterfront, at the site of the former Fleet and Industrial Supply Center.

<text>USS &quot;Oregon City&quot; (CA-122), the lead ship of the of heavy cruisers, was laid down 8 April 1944 by Bethlehem Steel Company, Quincy, Massachusetts; launched 9 June 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Raymond P. Canfield, wife of the City Commissioner of Oregon City, Oregon. Newspapers showed pictures of celebrated radio, film and television personality Bing Crosby adding a bit of glamor to the launching. The &quot;Oregon City&quot; was commissioned 16 February 1946.&quot;Oregon City&quot; was named for the city in the state of Oregon. &quot;Oregon City&quot; departed Boston 31 March 1946 for shakedown out of Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, then returned to Boston in mid-May.
&quot;Oregon City&quot; became flagship of the United States Fourth Fleet on 3 July and the following month began dockside training of reservists in Philadelphia. From 6 to 19 October she made a post-war Reserve Training Cruise, to Bermuda, then sailed to Boston and remained until the following March with a somewhat reduced complement. Reassigned to the 2nd Fleet in January 1947, &quot;Oregon City&quot;″s crew had returned to full strength by the time she sailed for Guantanamo Bay 30 March. After three weeks of exercises she returned to Boston, not sailing again until 6 June. She embarked midshipmen at Annapolis on the 21st, then sailed for the Canal Zone and the Caribbean on an annual summer training cruise.

&quot;Oregon City&quot; debarked her midshipmen at Norfolk in mid-August and sailed for Philadelphia and deactivation. She was decommissioned on 15 December 1947. She was the only &quot;Oregon City&quot;-class ship to be decommissioned soon after completion, and was not selected for conversion to a missile ship. Her bell was sent back to Oregon where it is on display at the Museum of the Oregon Territory in Oregon City, Oregon. She was stricken 1 November 1970, and sold 17 September 1973 to Union Minerals and Alloys Corporation, NYC, and scrapped in Kearny, New Jersey the following year. Her 5&quot; gun houses could still be seen well into the 90s at Philadelphia Navy Yard.

The bell originally from USS Oregon City was presented to Portland Area Naval Reserve through the people of Oregon City, Oregon on 8 March 1975 and it is now on display at Museum of Oregon Territory. A model of her is also on displayed there.

<text>Mester de juglaría (&quot;Ministry of jongleury&quot;) is a Spanish literature genre from the 12th and 13th centuries, transmitted orally by &quot;juglares&quot; who made their living by reciting and singing these stories for the recreations of nobles, rulers, and the general public. These were people of humble origins, traveling comedians who also engaged in circus acts like juggling, tightrope walking, and acrobatics, or acted as clowns who told jokes or played simple instruments, or danced and sang versions of simple mime or puppet pieces, or, importantly, recited verses composed by other authors, called troubadours, either in public places (town squares, above all), or in castles of feudal lords for whom they were housed; much of the time they also supported themselves by the visual arts.

According to Ramón Menéndez Pidal, in his study of the poetry of juglares and the origins of romantic literature (Madrid 1957), the word &quot;juglar&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;jocularis&quot;, &quot;joculator&quot;, and it signifes &quot;joker, or man of jokes.&quot; The word &quot;mester&quot; is also said to derive from Latin &quot;ministerium&quot;, meaning &quot;minister&quot; and, at that time, &quot;official.&quot;

There were two types of juglares: epic juglares, who recited narrative poetry, and lyrical juglares, who dedicated themselves to the cultivation of sentimental poetry and performed poetic compositions such as serenades, couplets, songs of troubadours, etc. From the 10th to 13th centuries, the former type were more numerous, whereas the latter half of the 13th century to the 14th century were dominated by the latter type.

According to Menéndez Pidal, there were different specializations. There was the &quot;remedador&quot; who was dedicated to imitation; the &quot;cazurro&quot; who practiced the plebeian arts; the &quot;juglar de gesta&quot;, the &quot;goliardo&quot;, somewhere between student and vagabond, who understood musical instruments and how to compose for them. Also included in the word is the concept of a musician, the types of which were quite diverse, from tavern singers and the richly adorned ones who sang in palaces and accompanied nobles on voyages, to those who sang and played dramas in churches with all sorts of musical instruments (the flute, the dulcimer, the drum, and handheld stringed instruments like the vihuela or the rabel). Although some composed their own lyrics, generally they repeated other people&#x27;s texts.

These anonymous stories were mostly cantar de gesta. Although versified to make
it easier to memorize, juglares probably often changed the story a little bit as they passed it to others.

There are more theories regarding the origin of these texts. The &quot;individualist theory&quot; states that these texts
were the creation of one poet and they didn&#x27;t change much. On the other hand, the &quot;traditionalist theory&quot;
says that it is a collective work of the public and it was totally changed on its route.

Compared to the Mester de Clerecía the authors weren&#x27;t educated, treated popular topics, used simple language and the metrics of the verses is irregular.

The most known examples of the works that can be classified as Mester de Juglaría is El Cantar de Mio Cid and Representación de los Reyes Magos.</text><links>

<text>The Yazoo land scandal, Yazoo fraud, Yazoo land fraud, or Yazoo land controversy was a massive real-estate fraud perpetrated, in the mid-1790s, by Georgia governor George Mathews and the Georgia General Assembly. Georgia politicians sold large tracts of territory in the Yazoo lands, in what are now portions of the present-day states of Alabama and Mississippi, to political insiders at very low prices in 1794. Although the law enabling the sales was overturned by reformers the following year, its ability to do so was challenged in the courts, eventually reaching the US Supreme Court. In the landmark decision in &quot;Fletcher v. Peck&quot; (1810), the Court ruled that the contracts were binding and the state could not retroactively invalidate the earlier land sales. It was one of the first times the Supreme Court had overturned a state law, and it justified many claims for those lands. Some of the land sold by the state in 1794 had been shortly thereafter resold to innocent third parties, greatly complicating the litigation. In 1802, because of the ongoing controversy, Georgia ceded all of its claims to lands west of its modern border to the U.S. government. In exchange the government paid cash and assumed the legal liabilities. Claims involving the land purchases were not fully resolved until legislation was passed in 1814 establishing a claims-resolution fund.

The Yazoo land fraud is often conflated with the Pine Barrens speculation, another land scandal that took place in east Georgia at about the same time. In this case, the state&#x27;s high-ranking officials were making multiple gifts of land grants for the same parcels, resulting in the issuance of grants totaling much more land than was available in the state of Georgia.

==Background==

The origins of the Yazoo land scandal lay in the desire of the U.S. state of Georgia to firm up its territorial claims after the American Revolutionary War, and to satisfy a great demand for land to develop. The territory claimed by Georgia ran as far west as the Mississippi River, and included most of the present states of Alabama and Mississippi (from 31° N to 35° N, excepting only the coastal areas of those states). Some of this territory was claimed and occupied by Native Americans, and southern portions of the territory were also claimed by Spain as part of Spanish Florida. Lands along the Mississippi River near present-day Natchez, Mississippi had been settled during the British administration of West Florida, and had a strong Loyalist presence. Some Georgia authorities and speculators thought these developed lands could be seized.

===Previous development attempts===
The first attempt of Georgia to organize settlement in this area was a 1784 proposal to establish Houstoun County in the Muscle Shoals area. This attempt never got off the ground because its major proponents became involved instead in an effort to establish the State of Franklin in present-day eastern Tennessee.

In 1785 Governor George Mathews signed the Bourbon County Act, which organized Bourbon County, Georgia in the area east of the Mississippi and south of the Yazoo River. This area included the Natchez area and was in the area also claimed by Spain. The state appointed civil and judicial officers for the new county, but under pressure from the federal government, Georgia dissolved Bourbon County in 1788. The federal government opposed Bourbon County because of the unresolved Spanish claim, and because claims to the area by the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations had not been extinguished.

In about 1789, a secret society called the Combined Society was formed; the members&#x27; sole purpose was to make money by land speculation. This group secured influence in the Georgia legislature to further its aims. In 1789 three companies, The South Carolina Yazoo Company, The Virginia Yazoo Company (which was headed by Patrick Henry), and the Tennessee Company were formed by Combined Society interests to buy land from the Georgia legislature. Governor Edward Telfair signed a deal to sell of land to the Yazoo companies for $207,000, or about 1 cent per acre. These lands were located north of the mouth of the Yazoo River and extended eastward from the Mississippi. The deal collapsed in 1792 when the companies sought to pay with depreciated old currency, which the state refused to accept. The existence of the Combined Society was also exposed in 1792; some of its principals continued to be active in attempts to develop Georgia lands.

==Yazoo land sales==
In 1794, four new companies were formed: the Georgia Company, the Georgia-Mississippi Company, the Upper Mississippi Company, and the new Tennessee Company. Their principals included individuals active in the 1789 purchases, as well as leading Georgia politicians such as James Gunn and United States Supreme Court Associate Justice James Wilson. These companies persuaded the Georgia state assembly to sell more than of land for $500,000. Many Georgia officials and legislators were offered shares in these companies or bribes to secure their agreement to the sale. On January 7, 1795, Governor Mathews signed into law a bill authorizing the sale of the , known as the Yazoo Act.

The territory that was the subject of these purchases included most of the land that had been the subject of the 1789 purchase attempt, and a significant portion of it was resold to buyers in other parts of the country who were not aware of the shaky nature of the transactions.

==Repeal of sale==

When the details of the sale were revealed, public outrage was widespread, and people protested to federal officials and Congressmen. Jared Irwin and U.S. Senator James Jackson led the reform efforts: Irwin was elected Governor of Georgia and, less than two months after taking office, signed a bill on February 13, 1796 nullifying the Yazoo Act. The state burned all copies of the bill except for one that had been sent to President George Washington. Jackson resigned as Senator to run for office as next Governor of Georgia. He was elected and took office two years later.

But the matter was not over. The state refunded money to people who had purchased land, but some refused the money, preferring to keep the land. The state did not recognize their claims, and the matter was to wind through courts for the next decade. In 1802 the state ceded to the federal government all claim to lands west of its present border (which were organized into the Mississippi Territory), along with the ongoing legal disputes. Claims by third-party owners who had innocently purchased land from the original companies were not fully resolved until 1816. Spanish claims to the Georgia territory were resolved with the 1795 Treaty of San Lorenzo; Native American claims to the area were extinguished by a series of treaties ending in the 1820s.

Legal challenges to Georgia&#x27;s attempt to repeal the sale reached the Supreme Court in 1810. The landmark &quot;Fletcher v. Peck&quot; decision marked one of the first times the Court overturned a state law, deciding that the land sales were binding contracts and could not be retroactively invalidated by the passage of superseding legislation.

==Pine Barrens speculation==
During the same period, in what was called the Pine Barrens speculation, the governors and legislature of Georgia made overlapping land grants in the eastern part of the state, effectively granting three times more land than existed in the state. Although land grants were supposed to be limited to per individual, the state awarded multiple grants of to certain people.

<text>Michele Mercati (8 April 1541 – 25 June 1593) was a physician who was superintendent of the Vatican Botanical Garden under Popes Pius V, Gregory XIII, Sixtus V, and Clement VIII. He was one of the first scholars to recognise prehistoric stone tools as human-made rather than natural or mythologically created thunderstones. 

==Biography==
Mercati was born in San Miniato, Tuscany, the son of Pietro Mercati, physician to Popes Pius V and Gregory XIII. He was educated at the University of Pisa, where he took degrees in medicine and philosophy. He was interested in natural history, mineralogy, palaeontology, medicine, and botany, and produced a book on these subjects entitled the &quot;Metallotheca&quot;, which was not published until 1717.

Mercati collected curious objects - fossils, minerals and so on - as well as &#x27;ceraunia&#x27; or &#x27;thunderstones&#x27;. Mercati was particularly interested in Ceraunia cuneata, &quot;wedge-shaped thunderstones,&quot; which seemed to him to be most like axes and arrowheads, which he now called ceraunia vulgaris, &quot;folk thunderstones,&quot; distinguishing his view from the popular one. Mercati examined the surfaces of the ceraunia and noted that the stones were of flint and that they had been chipped all over by another stone. By their shapes, Mercati deduced that the stones were intended to be hafted. He then showed the similarities between the &#x27;ceraunia&#x27; and artifacts from the New World that explorers had identified as implements or weapons.

Mercati posited that these stone tools must have been used when metal was unknown and cited Biblical passages to prove that in Biblical times stone was the first material used. He also revived the Three-age system of Lucretius, which described a succession of periods based on the use of stone (and wood), bronze and iron respectively.

==Legacy==
Due to lateness of publication, Mercati&#x27;s ideas were already being developed independently by other antiquarians, however, his writing served as a further stimulus. He was lauded shortly after publication by Antoine de Jussieu and his importance continues to be recognised. David Clarke described Mercati as &quot;the archaeological counterpart of Cardano in mathematics, Vesalius in anatomy, Galileo in the physical sciences and Copernicus in astronomy.&quot; He is sometimes described as a polymath.

<text>The Quba Mosque (, , ) is a mosque located in Medina, in the Hejaz region of Saudi Arabia, first built in the lifetime of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in the 7th century C.E. It is thought to be the first mosque in the world, established on the first day of Muhammad&#x27;s emigration to Medina. Its first stone is said to have been laid by the prophet, and the structure completed by his companions. The mosque was subsequently modified across the centuries until the 1980s, when it was completely replaced by a new building that stands today.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
According to historical Islamic texts, during the &quot;hijrah&quot; (migration) of Muhammad from Mecca to Medina (Yathrib), he stopped in the village of Quba&#x27; near Medina. Depending on the sources, he stayed there for 3 to 22 days. Two different accounts of the mosque&#x27;s foundation exist in relation to this event. In one, Muhammad founded the mosque himself, though there are varying explanations for how the site was chosen: it was either a (place for drying dates) that belonged to Muhammad&#x27;s host, Kulthum, or it was the place where a woman named Labba had tethered her donkey. Another version, probably a later legend inspired by the foundation story of the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque in Medina, tells that Muhammad made Ali get on a camel and then built the mosque where the camel went. Muhammad is said to have laid the first stone himself, with the next ones laid by Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman. He is also said to have visited the mosque every Saturday afterwards and conducted religious service there. In another account, the mosque had been built prior to Muhammad&#x27;s arrival by the first Muslim emigrants from Mecca and some of the &quot;Anṣār&quot; of Medina. Muhammad then prayed in the mosque with them.

Some scholars have debated the historicity of the mosque&#x27;s foundation story. Leone Caetani questioned whether Muhammad recognized other mosques in this way and argued that the story is likely a later invention, part of a trend by later Muslims to associate various mosques with Muhammad&#x27;s life. Johannes Pedersen supported the story&#x27;s plausibility, arguing that there are indications in the Qur&#x27;an and other traditional sources that other mosques indeed existed and were recognized in Muhammad&#x27;s time.

Initially, the mosque was built from Medina in the village of Quba&#x27;, before Medina expanded to include this village. The first mosque would have been oriented towards Jerusalem and Muhammad most likely rebuilt it when the &quot;qibla&quot; (direction of prayer) was changed toward the Kaaba in Mecca.

=== Modifications ===
The mosque was repeatedly modified and expanded in later periods. It was expanded under Caliph Uthman (). Another expansion occurred in 684 CE, during the reign of the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. Under his successor, al-Walid I (), the mosque was rebuilt. Its first &quot;minaret&quot; was added under Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz ().

Another renovation occurred in 1044, when a mihrab (niche symbolizing the &quot;qibla&quot;) was added by Sharif Abu Ya&#x27;la Ahmad ibn Hasan (or Abu Yali al-Husayni). Further additions were made around 80 years later. Later renovations were made by the Zengid vizier Jamal al-Din al-Isfahani in 1160. During the Mamluk era, Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad ibn Qalawun reconstructed the mosque in 1333, the ceiling was redone under al-Ashraf Barsbay in 1436, and Qaytbay made renovations in 1476.
During the Ottoman era, Sultan Suleiman sponsored the reconstruction of the minaret and the mosque&#x27;s ceiling in 1543. Sultan Mustafa II renovated these same elements again in 1699. Major renovations and modifications took place in 1829 and in the following decade or so during the reigns of Mahmud II () and Abdülmecid I ().

=== Modern reconstruction ===

==== King Faisal Expansion (1968) ====
In 1968 (1388 AH), during the reign of King Faisal bin Abdulaziz, the mosque&#x27;s exterior walls were refurbished, and the northern portico, facing Medina, was extended to include a dedicated women&#x27;s entrance. Additionally, the minaret, previously located in the northwestern corner as a standalone structure, was integrated into the main building. This renovation, costing approximately 800,000 Saudi Riyals, resulted in a square-shaped mosque with dimensions of 40 by 40 meters.

==== King Fahd Expansion (1984–1986) ====
The present-day mosque is the result of a complete reconstruction that began in 1984 under Saudi king Fahd bin Abdulaziz. It expanded the mosque&#x27;s size. The Egyptian architect Abdel-Wahed El-Wakil was commissioned to conceive a larger mosque. He initially intended to incorporate the old structure into his design, but it was eventually decided to tear down the old mosque and replace it entirely with the new one. The project aimed to maintain the mosque&#x27;s traditional Islamic architectural elements while significantly increasing its capacity to accommodate 20,000 worshipers. 

King Fahd laid the foundation stone for the expansion on November 3, 1984, and the project was completed two years later, with its inauguration on November 2, 1986. This expansion reshaped the mosque from a square to a rectangular layout, featuring a central courtyard accessible from all entrances. A dedicated women&#x27;s prayer area was established in the northern section, spanning two floors and accommodating approximately 7,000 female worshipers.Following this expansion, the mosque featured four minarets and 56 domes. It also included accommodations for Imams and Muezzins, and a library. The mosque&#x27;s land area measured 13,500 square meters, with the building itself covering 5,860 square meters.

==== King Salman Expansion ====
On April 8, 2022, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced the launch of the largest expansion in the history of the Quba Mosque, along with the development of its surrounding area. The project was named after King Salman bin Abdulaziz. This expansion aims to increase the mosque&#x27;s total area tenfold, from 5,035 square meters to 50,000 square meters, increasing its capacity to 66,000 worshipers. The project focuses on connecting the existing mosque with covered plazas on all four sides, functionally and visually linked to independent prayer areas not structurally attached to the existing building. It will also provide all necessary services for the mosque, improve the efficiency of the existing building and its associated services, and enhance the surrounding road network and infrastructure to improve crowd management, accessibility, and the safety and security of worshipers. Additionally, it aims to develop and revitalize several historical sites and landmarks within the mosque and its surrounding areas.

In March 2023, the responsibility for overseeing and operating the Quba Mosque was transferred to the Al Madinah Region Development Authority from the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Dawah, and Guidance.

== Religious significance ==
Performing &quot;Wuḍūʾ&quot; (&#x27;ablution&#x27;) in one&#x27;s home, then offering two &quot;Rakaʿāt&quot; of &quot;Nafl&quot; (optional) prayers in the Quba Mosque, is considered to be equal to performing one &quot;ʿUmrah&quot;. Muhammad used to go there, riding or on foot, every Saturday and offer a two &quot;rakaʿāt&quot; prayer. He advised others to do the same, saying, &quot;Whoever makes ablutions at home and then goes and prays in the Mosque of Quba, he will have a reward like that of an &#x27;Umrah.&quot; This &quot;ḥadīth&quot; was reported by Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Al-Nasa&#x27;i, Ibn Majah and Hakim al-Nishaburi.
=== Mention in the Qur&#x27;an ===
The mosque is believed to be the one which the Quran mentions as being founded on piety and devoutness (&quot;Masjid al-Taqwa&quot;):
=== Mentions in &quot;hadith&quot;s ===
The merits of the mosque are mentioned in nineteen &quot;Sahih al-Bukhari&quot; hadiths; thirteen &quot;Sahih Muslim&quot; hadiths; two &quot;Sunan Abi Dawud&quot; hadiths; six &quot;Al-Muwatta&quot; hadiths.

Muhammad frequented the mosque and prayed there. This is referred to in a number of hadith:


== Architecture ==

=== Early form ===

The original mosque is said to have been a square or rectangular walled enclosure with an open court inside it. In Muhammad&#x27;s time, a roofed area supported by columns was added on the qibla side. Other historical descriptions of the mosque mostly date from periods after it had already been expanded by others. For much of its history prior to the 1980s reconstruction, it maintained its generally Umayyad form, with a covered prayer hall and an internal courtyard surrounded by galleries with rows of arches.

The Umayyad structure at the time of Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz&#x27;s renovations (early 8th century) was made from cut stone and lime, with a ceiling made of valuable timber. It was also decorated with mosaics, probably created with the help of Byzantine craftsmen who also worked on a renovation of the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque in Medina around the same time. According to descriptions in the Abbasid period, such as those of , the mosque measured approximately and contained an interior courtyard measuring around , while Its walls were around high and its minaret was roughly .

The early 19th-century renovations initated by Mahmud II replaced the originally flat ceiling of the mosque with a new ceiling of shallow domes supported by arches and columns. Prior to its modern reconstruction, the mosque&#x27;s western entrance was also fronted by a façade with Ottoman &quot;tughras&quot; (calligraphic signatures) and an inscription recording Mahmud II&#x27;s works. In the late 19th century, the writer Ibrahim Rifat Pasha reported that the mosque measured some with a ceiling around high.

=== Present-day mosque ===

The new mosque consists of a rectangular prayer hall raised on a second story platform. The prayer hall connects to a cluster containing residential areas, offices, ablution facilities, shops and a library.

The recent new construction of the Quba Mosque that happened in 1984 include many new additions, such as 7 main entrances, 4 parallel minarets, and the 56 mini domes that surround the perimeter of the mosque from an overhead point of view. The courtyard of this mosque is composed of black, red, and white marble, and majority of the structure and interior structures such as the minbar and mihrab are all composed of white marble. Originally, there was one minaret, the new renovations included the addition of the other three minarets, they rest on square bases, have octagonal shafts which take on a circular shape as they reach the top.

The prayer hall is arranged around a central courtyard, characterised by six large domes resting on clustered columns. A portico, which is two bays in depth, borders the courtyard on the east and west, while a one-bayed portico borders it on the north, and separates it from the women&#x27;s prayer area.

The women&#x27;s prayer area, which is surrounded by a screen, is divided into two parts as a passageway connects the northern entrance with the courtyard. When Quba Mosque was rebuilt in 1986, the Medina architecture was retained – ribbed white domes, and basalt facing and modest exterior – qualities that recalls Madina&#x27;s simplicity. The courtyard, is flagged with black, red and white marble. It is screened overhead by day from the scorching heat with shades. Arabesque latticework filters the light of the palm groves outside. Elements of the new building include work by the Egyptian architect Abdel-Wahed El-Wakil, Pakistani architect Hassan Khan Sayyid and the Stuttgart tensile architect Mahmoud Bodo Rasch, a student of Frei Otto.

<text>175 (one hundred [and] seventy-five) is the natural number following 174 and preceding 176.

==In mathematics==
Raising the decimal digits of 175 to the powers of successive integers produces 175 back again: 

175 is a figurate number for a rhombic dodecahedron, the difference of two consecutive fourth powers: It is also a decagonal number and a decagonal pyramid number, the smallest number after 1 that has both properties.

<text>Leung Long Chau (, 1911–December 1998) was a Chinese poet and calligrapher. Born in the early 1910s in Guangdong Province, he graduated at the Guangdong Medical Research Institute. In the late 1920s, he married Ho Wing Yuet and settled down in Hong Kong.

Under colonial rule, his Chinese qualification as a medical practitioner was not recognized; he thus had to turn to business to make a living. His work for a local company just made up the living expenses for his large family. In his spare time he continued to offer free medical advice to his compatriots, and to write poems and practice calligraphy—both hobbies of his since childhood.

Through the years he written many poems about Hong Kong, but at the time they remained unpublished. This changed in 1984, when his children decided to compile his works and published &quot;Lang Yin Xiao Cao&quot; () for non-commercial purposes. It was never sold in bookstores, but managed to get the attention of the close circle of Chinese poets in Hong Kong and was widely acclaimed as valuable for anyone seriously interested in Chinese literature and Hong Kong culture.

In 1998, the Leung family decided to publish a sequel to &quot;Lang Yin Xiao Cao&quot; (朗吟小草續集), compiling his major works written after 1984. In the same year, the low-profile poet received his first and only prize for Chinese literature from the Hong Kong Government. He died in December 1998.

<doc id="562526" wikidata="Q4625944" url="?curid=562526" title="Sugar alcohol">
<text>Sugar alcohols (also called polyhydric alcohols, polyalcohols, alditols or glycitols) are organic compounds, typically derived from sugars, containing one hydroxyl group attached to each carbon atom. They are white, water-soluble solids that can occur naturally or be produced industrially by hydrogenating sugars. Since they contain multiple groups, they are classified as polyols.

Sugar alcohols are used widely in the food industry as thickeners and sweeteners. In commercial foodstuffs, sugar alcohols are commonly used in place of table sugar (sucrose), often in combination with high-intensity artificial sweeteners, in order to offset their low sweetness. Xylitol and sorbitol are popular sugar alcohols in commercial foods.

==Structure==
Sugar alcohols have the general formula . In contrast, sugars have two fewer hydrogen atoms, for example, or . Like their parent sugars, sugar alcohols exist in diverse chain length. Most have five- or six-carbon chains, because they are derived respectively from pentoses (five-carbon sugars) and hexoses (six-carbon sugars), which are the more common sugars. They have one −OH group attached to each carbon. They are further differentiated by the relative orientation (stereochemistry) of these −OH groups. Unlike sugars, which tend to exist as rings, sugar alcohols do not, although they can be dehydrated to give cyclic ethers (e.g. sorbitan can be dehydrated to isosorbide).

==Production==
Sugar alcohols can be, and often are, produced from renewable resources. Particular feedstocks are starch, cellulose and hemicellulose; the main conversion technologies use as the reagent: &quot;hydrogenolysis&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot; the cleavage of single bonds, converting polymers to smaller molecules, and &quot;hydrogenation&quot; of double bonds, converting sugars to sugar alcohols.

===Sorbitol and mannitol===
Mannitol is no longer obtained from natural sources; currently, sorbitol and mannitol are obtained by hydrogenation of sugars, using Raney nickel catalysts. The conversion of glucose and mannose to sorbitol and mannitol is given as

===Erythritol===
Erythritol is obtained by the fermentation of glucose and sucrose.

==Health effects==
Sugar alcohols do not contribute to tooth decay; in fact, xylitol deters tooth decay.

Sugar alcohols are absorbed at 50% of the rate of sugars, resulting in less of an effect on blood sugar levels as measured by comparing their effect to sucrose using the glycemic index.

==Common sugar alcohols==

*Ethylene glycol (2-carbon)
*Glycerol (3-carbon)
*Erythritol (4-carbon)
*Threitol (4-carbon)
*Arabitol (5-carbon)
*Xylitol (5-carbon)
*Ribitol (5-carbon)
*Mannitol (6-carbon)
*Sorbitol (6-carbon)
*Galactitol (6-carbon)
*Fucitol (6-carbon)
*Iditol (6-carbon)
*Inositol (6-carbon; a cyclic sugar alcohol)
*Volemitol (7-carbon)
*Isomalt (12-carbon)
*Maltitol (12-carbon)
*Lactitol (12-carbon)
*Maltotriitol (18-carbon)
*Maltotetraitol (24-carbon)
*Polyglycitol
Both disaccharides and monosaccharides can form sugar alcohols; however, sugar alcohols derived from disaccharides (e.g. maltitol and lactitol) are not entirely hydrogenated because only one aldehyde group is available for reduction.

==Sugar alcohols as food additives==
This table presents the relative sweetness and food energy of the most widely used sugar alcohols. Despite the variance in food energy content of sugar alcohols, the European Union&#x27;s labeling requirements assign a blanket value of 2.4 kcal/g to all sugar alcohols.
===Characteristics===
As a group, sugar alcohols are not as sweet as sucrose, and they have slightly less food energy than sucrose. Their flavor is similar to sucrose, and they can be used to mask the unpleasant aftertastes of some high-intensity sweeteners.

Sugar alcohols are not metabolized by oral bacteria, and so they do not contribute to tooth decay. They do not brown or caramelize when heated.

In addition to their sweetness, some sugar alcohols can produce a noticeable cooling sensation in the mouth when highly concentrated, for instance in sugar-free hard candy or chewing gum. This happens, for example, with the crystalline phase of sorbitol, erythritol, xylitol, mannitol, lactitol and maltitol. The cooling sensation is due to the dissolution of the sugar alcohol being an endothermic (heat-absorbing) reaction, one with a strong heat of solution.

===Absorption from the small intestine===
Sugar alcohols are usually incompletely absorbed into the blood stream from the small intestine which generally results in a smaller change in blood glucose than &quot;regular&quot; sugar (sucrose). This property makes them popular sweeteners among diabetics and people on low-carbohydrate diets. As an exception, erythritol is actually absorbed in the small intestine and excreted unchanged through urine, so it contributes no calories even though it is rather sweet.

===Side effects===
Like many other incompletely digestible substances, overconsumption of sugar alcohols can lead to bloating, diarrhea and flatulence because they are not fully absorbed in the small intestine. Some individuals experience such symptoms even in a single-serving quantity. With continued use, most people develop a degree of tolerance to sugar alcohols and no longer experience these symptoms.

<text>The Ga–Fante War in 1811 was a war fought by the Ashanti Empire. The war was started when an Ashanti ally started a war against the Fante Confederacy, and resulted in victory, albeit an inconclusive one, for the Ashanti. The Fante enjoyed significant material and military support from the British throughout the early stages of the war.

It involved a series of battles between the Ashanti, also known as Asante, and their allies, the Ga people of 
Accra, against an alliance of the rival Akan states of the Fante. In a series of conflicts, the Ashanti won the initial battles but were unable to hold their gains due to the adoption of asymmetrical tactics by the Fante. Despite being eventually forced to withdraw, the Ashanti managed to capture a British fort at Tantamkweri.

<doc id="562539" wikidata="Q1040417" url="?curid=562539" title="Kick Out the Jams">
<text>Kick Out the Jams is the debut album by American rock band MC5. A live album, it was recorded at the Grande Ballroom in Detroit over two nights, October 30 and 31, 1968, and released in February 1969, by Elektra Records.

The LP peaked at No. 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, with the title track peaking at No. 82 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Although the album initially received an unfavorable review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine upon its release, it has gone on to be considered an important forerunner to punk rock music, and was ranked number 294 in both 2003 and 2012 editions of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; lists, and at number 349 in a 2020 revised list.

==Release==
The album peaked at number 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart, &quot;in the wake of a publicity blitz&quot;, wrote Robert Christgau in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981). In Canada, the album reached #37.

While &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Rose&quot; and &quot;Motor City Is Burning&quot; open with the band&#x27;s typical leftist and revolutionary rhetoric, it was the opening line to the title track that stirred up controversy. Vocalist Rob Tyner shouted, &quot;And right now... right now... right now it&#x27;s time to... kick out the jams, motherfuckers!&quot; before the opening riffs. Elektra Records executives were offended by the line and had preferred to edit it out of the album (replacing the offending words with &quot;brothers and sisters&quot;), while the band and manager John Sinclair adamantly opposed this.

However in 2002, Wayne Kramer explained to Terry Gross on her show, Fresh Air, the band understood and accepted the single needed to be recorded without the profanity. 

The original release had &quot;kick out the jams, Motherfuckers!&quot; printed on the inside album cover, but was soon pulled from stores. Two versions were then released, both with censored album covers, with the uncensored audio version sold behind record counters.

Making matters worse, Hudson&#x27;s department stores refused to carry the album. Tensions between the band and the Hudson&#x27;s chain escalated to the point that the department stores refused to carry any album from the Elektra label after MC5 took out a full-page ad that, according to Danny Fields, &quot;was just a picture of Rob Tyner, and all it said was &#x27;Fuck Hudson&#x27;s.&#x27; And it had the Elektra logo&quot;. To end the conflict and to avoid further financial loss, Elektra dropped MC5 from their record label.

Later the same year, Jefferson Airplane recorded the song &quot;We Can Be Together&quot; for their &quot;Volunteers&quot; album, a song containing the word &quot;motherfucker&quot;. Unlike Elektra, RCA Records released the album wholly uncensored.

==Title meaning==

&quot;Kick out the jams&quot; has been taken to be a slogan of the 1960s ethos of revolution and liberation, an incitement to &quot;kick out&quot; restrictions in various forms. To quote MC5 guitarist Wayne Kramer from his interview with Caroline Boucher in &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot; magazine on August 8, 1970:

People said &quot;oh wow, &#x27;kick out the jams&#x27; means break down restrictions&quot; etc., and it made good copy, but when we wrote it we didn&#x27;t have that in mind. We first used the phrase when we were the house band at a ballroom in Detroit, and we played there every week with another band from the area. [...] We got in the habit, being the sort of punks we are, of screaming at them to get off the stage, to kick out the jams, meaning stop jamming. We were saying it all the time and it became a sort of esoteric phrase. Now, I think people can get what they like out of it; that&#x27;s one of the good things about rock and roll.

The title has also been reinterpreted as an establishment message masquerading as a revolutionary anthem. David Bowie sings in the song &quot;Cygnet Committee&quot;: &quot;[We] stoned the poor on slogans such as/Wish You Could Hear/Love Is All We Need/Kick Out the Jams/Kick Out Your Mother&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Upon its release, critic Lester Bangs, writing his inaugural review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, called &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot; a &quot;ridiculous, overbearing, pretentious album&quot;. In contrast to this view, modern opinion of the album generally holds it in very high regard, noting its influence on rock music that has followed. Mark Deming of AllMusic called it &quot;one of the most powerfully energetic live albums ever made&quot; in a retrospective review. &quot;PopMatters&quot; reviewer Adam Williams wrote, &quot;For my money, &#x27;Kick Out the Jams&#x27; is one of the greatest records ever pressed. It is a magnificent time portal into the past, a fleeting glimpse of a band that actually had the balls to walk it like they talked it&quot; and that &quot;no live recording has captured the primal elements of rock more than the MC5&#x27;s inaugural effort.&quot; Bangs himself would change his mind about the album, writing in a footnote in his Troggs essay &quot;James Taylor Marked for Death&quot;: 

==Legacy==
In March 2005, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed the song &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot; at number 39 in its &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Tracks&quot; list. The same track was named the 65th best hard rock song of all time by VH1.

&quot;The MC5 were a mercurial band,&quot; remarked guitarist Wayne Kramer. &quot;We were inconsistent. All of a sudden, this was &quot;the&quot; night. It was a lot of pressure for us to be under. I hear it every time I listen to the record. I hear me making clumsy mistakes on the guitar; I hear Dennis all over on the tempos; I hear Rob not quite in the perfect voice he was capable of.&quot;

<text>Mester de Clerecía (&quot;Ministry of Clergy&quot;) is a Spanish literature genre that can be understood as an opposition and surpassing of Mester de Juglaría. It was cultivated in the 13th century by Spanish learned poets, usually clerics (hence the name &#x27;clerecía&#x27;).

Unlike Mester de Juglaría, Mester de Clerecía was written on paper, not anonymous, with regular metre (the &quot;cuaderna vía&quot;) and done by educated authors. Also the topics are more serious: religious, historical and novelesque. The stanzas in them are composed of 4 alexandrine lines which contain 14 syllables each.

The most famous authors of this period are Gonzalo de Berceo and Arcipreste de Hita. The &quot;Poema de Fernán González&quot; is an example of anonymous mester de clerecía.

These poets carefully counted the number of syllables in each line and strived to achieve perfect lines. The line form is the Alexandrine line (14 syllables) with consonantal rhyme in stanzas of four lines each. This form is also known as the &quot;cuaderna vía&quot; or the fourfold way, and was borrowed from France and was popular until the late fourteenth century. Popular themes of these poets were Christian legends, lives of saints, and tales from classical antiquity. The poems were recited to villagers in public plazas. Two traits separate this form from the mester de juglaría: didacticism and erudition. Castilian priest and poet Gonzalo de Berceo was one of the greatest followers of the mester de clerecía. All of his works were religious; two of the most well known are &quot;Milagros de Nuestra Señora&quot; (about the miracles worked by the Virgin Mary) and &quot;Vida de Santa Oria&quot;. Fourteenth-century poet Juan Ruíz, also known as the Arcipreste de Hita, used the cuaderna vía in parts of his famous work &quot;Libro de buen amor&quot;. He introduced sixteen-syllable lines.</text><links>

<text>The Ark is an office building located in Hammersmith, London, England.

==Original building==
The building lies immediately south of the Hammersmith Flyover. Named in reference to its hull-like profile, the Ark was designed by architect Ralph Erskine, for Swedish developers Ake Larson and Pronator.

Erskine, based in Sweden, worked from a small office in collaboration with other trusted architects in order to retain design freedom. In the case of the Ark, Erskine and Vernon Gracie (who worked with Erskine on Byker Wall in Newcastle) collaborated with London architects Rock Townsend and latterly Lennart Bergstrom in Stockholm.

Planning permission for the building was granted on 19 September 1989; building commenced the same day and the complex was completed in 1992. Owing to the difficult economic circumstances at the time, Ake Larson&#x27;s UK division did not survive to occupy the building. Drinks company Seagram subsequently occupied the Ark from 1996 until it was bought by Vivendi Universal in 2000.

==Refurbishment==

In 2006 German property company Deka sold the Ark to Landid backed by GE Real Estate and O&amp;H Properties, who saw the building required a refit to make the interior better suited for multiple tenants.

The ensuing £20 million conversion was carried out by DN-A architects, comprising the stripping out of the central “village” and connecting walkways which spanned the atrium and the floorplates filled in creating two smaller atriums turning “the doughnut plan into a pretzel” in the words of DN-A director Stuart McLarty.

A new double height atrium was created on the ground floor, and a new fifth and sixth floor were erected, while the seventh floor was extended as an open mezzanine. As a result, net lettable floor space was increased by 30%, from to . Each floor can be subdivided into two spaces and the open balustrading has been replaced with partially glazed partitions.

The building remained unoccupied until 2009.

<text>Alexander Edmund Batson Davie, QC, referred to as A. E. B. Davie (November 24, 1847 – August 1, 1889), was the eighth premier of British Columbia. He served in office from 1887 until his death in 1889.

Called to the bar in 1873, he was the first person to receive his entire law education in British Columbia. Davie was first elected to the provincial legislature in 1875 from the riding of Cariboo as independent opposition candidate. He lost his seat in 1877 after a brief stint in the cabinet of Premier Andrew Charles Elliott, as provincial secretary. Davie returned to the legislature in 1882, this time from the riding of Lillooet, and became attorney-general under Premier William Smithe. He went to Ottawa and argued before the Supreme Court of Canada in favour of provincial rights pleading that the province had a right to regulate its liquor sales.

When Smithe died in 1887, the lieutenant-governor asked Davie to become premier but he fell ill within months and left for California to recuperate. In his absence, Provincial Secretary John Robson ran the government on a day-to-day basis, though Davie attempted to direct policy in his letters to Robson. He returned in May 1888, but his health was in a poor state, and he ultimately died in office the following August.

Davie Street in Vancouver is named for him. He was appointed a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in September 1883. His brother, Theodore Davie, later became premier in 1892.

Davie was married December 3, 1874, to Constance Langford Skinner of Maple Bay, British Columbia. They had four children. Alexander Edmund Batson Davie is interred in the Ross Bay Cemetery in Victoria, British Columbia.

<text>The Eclipse Foundation AISBL is an independent, Europe-based not-for-profit corporation that acts as a steward of the Eclipse open source software development community, with legal jurisdiction in the European Union. It is an organization supported by over 350 members, and represents the world&#x27;s largest sponsored collection of Open Source projects and developers. The Foundation focuses on key services such as intellectual property (IP) management, ecosystem development, and IT infrastructure.

== Projects ==
The Eclipse Project was originally created by IBM in November 2001 and was supported by a consortium of software vendors. In 2004, the Eclipse Foundation was founded to lead and develop the Eclipse community. It was created to allow a vendor-neutral, open, and transparent community to be established around Eclipse. The Foundation utilizes a hierarchical project structure. Each project stems from a primary parent project and may have sub-projects. The uppermost projects, which do not have a parent project, are called Top Level Projects.

The Eclipse Foundation is considered a &quot;third generation&quot; open-source organization, and is home to Jakarta EE, and over 425 open source projects, including runtimes, tools, and frameworks for a wide range of technology domains such as the internet of things (IoT), cloud and edge computing, automotive, systems engineering, digital ledger technologies, and open processor designs. The Foundation is best known for developing Eclipse IDE, an IDE primarily targeted at developing in Java. The Foundation as a whole is largely centred around Java development, with more than 90% of its codebase written in Java.

As of January 2024, the Eclipse Foundation hosts more than 415 open-source projects. The Foundation also hosts 22 Industry Collaborations, including groups devoted to the Eclipse IDE, Internet of Things, and scientific research.

The Eclipse Foundation hosts DemoCamps, Hackathons, and conferences; its flagship event is EclipseCon.

== Membership ==
There are four types of membership in the Eclipse Foundation: Strategic, Contributing, Associate, and Committer. Each member organization pays annual dues based on its membership level.

Strategic Members are organizations that invest in developers and other resources to further develop the Eclipse technology. Each strategic member has a representative on the Eclipse Foundation Board of Directors. Strategic Members include the European Space Agency, Microsoft, and Oracle.

Contributing Members are organizations that participate in the development of the Eclipse ecosystem and offer products and services based on, or with, Eclipse. Contributing Members include ARM, BMW Group, NXP, Witekio, and more. 

Associate Members are non-voting members who can submit requirements, participate in project reviews, and participate in the Annual Meeting of the Membership at Large and scheduled quarterly update meetings. Committer Members are committers who become full members of the Eclipse Foundation. Committers are the core developers of Eclipse projects and can commit changes to project source code. Committer Members have representation on the board of directors.

A majority of Foundation members contribute to the Foundation by creating new applications and tools based on previous Eclipse applications, while a third of Foundation members interact with multiple Foundation projects.

<doc id="562574" wikidata="Q309498" url="?curid=562574" title="Cryptococcus">
<text>Cryptococcus is a genus of fungi in the family Cryptococcaceae that includes both yeasts and filamentous species. The filamentous, sexual forms or teleomorphs were formerly classified in the genus &quot;Filobasidiella&quot;, while &quot;Cryptococcus&quot; was reserved for the yeasts. Most yeast species formerly referred to &quot;Cryptococcus&quot; have now been placed in different genera. The name &quot;Cryptococcus&quot; comes from the Greek for &quot;hidden sphere&quot; (literally &quot;hidden berry&quot;). Some &quot;Cryptococcus&quot; species cause a disease called cryptococcosis.

==Taxonomy==
The genus was described by French mycologist Jean Paul Vuillemin in 1901, when he failed to find ascospores characteristic of the genus &quot;Saccharomyces&quot; in the yeast previously known as &quot;Saccharomyces neoformans&quot;. Over 300 additional names were subsequently added to the genus, almost all of which were later removed following molecular research based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences. As a result, some ten species are currently recognized in &quot;Cryptococcus&quot;.

The teleomorph was first described in 1975 by K.J. Kwon-Chung, who obtained cultures of the type species, &quot;Filobasidiella neoformans&quot;, by crossing strains of the yeast &quot;Cryptococcus neoformans&quot;. She was able to observe basidia similar to those of the genus &quot;Filobasidium&quot;, hence the name &quot;Filobasidiella&quot; for the new genus. Following changes to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, the practice of giving different names to teleomorph and anamorph forms of the same fungus was discontinued, meaning that &quot;Filobasidiella&quot; became a synonym of the earlier name &quot;Cryptococcus&quot;.

==General characteristics==
The cells of species that produce yeasts are covered in a thin layer of glycoprotein capsular material that has a gelatin-like consistency, and that among other functions, serves to help extract nutrients from the soil. The &quot;C. neoformans&quot; capsule consists of several polysaccharides, of which the major one is the immunomodulatory polysaccharide called glucuronoxylomannan (GXM). GXM is made up of the monosaccharides glucuronic acid, xylose and mannose and can also contain O-acetyl groups. The capsule functions as the major virulence factor in cryptococcal infection and disease.

Some &quot;Cryptococcus&quot; species have a huge diversity at the infraspecific level with different molecular types based on their genetic differences, mainly due to their geographical distribution, molecular characteristics, and ecological niches.

&quot;Cryptococcus&quot; species are not known to produce distinct, visible fruitbodies. All teleomorph forms appear to be parasites of other fungi. In teleomorphs the hyphae are colourless, are clamped or unclamped, and bear haustorial cells with filaments that attach to the hyphae of host fungi. The basidia are club-shaped and highly elongated. Spores arise in succession from four loci at the apex (which is sometimes partly septate). These spores are passively released and may remain on the basidium in chains, unless disturbed. In the type species, the spores germinate to form yeast cells, but yeast states are not known for all species.

==Habitat, distribution and species==

&quot;Cryptococcus neoformans&quot; is cosmopolitan and is the most prominent medically important species. It is best known for causing a severe form of meningitis and meningoencephalitis in people with HIV/AIDS. It may also infect organ-transplant recipients and people receiving certain cancer treatments. In its yeast state &quot;C. neoformans&quot; is found in the droppings of wild birds, often pigeons; when dust of the droppings is stirred up, it can infect humans or pets that inhale the dust. Infected humans and animals do not transmit their infection to others. The taxonomy of &quot;C. neoformans&quot; has been reviewed: it has now been divided into two species: &quot;Cryptococcus neoformans&quot; sensu stricto and &quot;Cryptococcus deneoformans&quot;.
&quot;Cryptococcus gattii&quot; (formerly &quot;C. neoformans&quot; var. &quot;gattii&quot;) is endemic to tropical parts of the continent of Africa and Australia. It is capable of causing disease in non-immunocompromised people. In its yeast state it has been isolated from eucalyptus trees in Australia. The taxonomy of &quot;C. gattii&quot; has been reviewed; it has now been divided into five species: &quot;C. gattii&quot; sensu stricto, &quot;C. bacillisporus&quot;, &quot;&#x27;C. deuterogattii&quot;, &quot;C. tetragattii&quot;, and &quot;C. decagattii&quot;.

&quot;Cryptococcus depauperatus&quot; is parasitic on &quot;Lecanicillium lecanii&quot;, an entomopathogenic fungus, and is known from Sri Lanka, England, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, and Canada. It is not known to produce a yeast state. This species grows as long, branching filaments and is self-fertile, i.e. it is homothallic. It can reproduce sexually with itself throughout its life cycle.

&quot;Cryptococcus luteus&quot; is parasitic on &quot;Granulobasidium vellereum&quot;, a corticioid fungus, and is known from England and Italy. It too is not known to produce a yeast state.

&quot;Cryptococcus amylolentus&quot; was originally isolated as a yeast from beetle tunnels in South African trees. It forms a basidia-bearing teleomorph in culture.

<text>This is a list of major political scandals in Canada.

==Federal==
==Alberta==

* Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal — a 1910 scandal that resulted in the resignation of the premier, Alexander Cameron Rutherford
* The Liberal Government over-spending on telephone poles and other unneeded expenses prior to its forced departure from power in 1921
* &quot;Sexual Sterilization Act&quot; of Alberta — a 1928 law that, over a period of four decades, resulted in close to 3,000 young people being classified as &quot;mentally unfit&quot; and without their knowledge or consent were sterilized to prevent them from breeding their &quot;bad blood.&quot;
* John Brownlee sex scandal — John Edward Brownlee, Premier of Alberta, sued for the seduction of a young woman and found guilty (1935) forcing his resignation
* Dar Heatherington — forced to resign from Lethbridge City Council in 2004 after being convicted of public mischief.
* Alison Redford&#x27;s expense scandal — forced to resign Premiership in 2014 after multiple expense scandals came to light
*Kamikaze campaign scandal — an investigation into allegations that Jason Kenney orchestrating Jeff Callaway&#x27;s campaign for the leadership of the United Conservative Party in an attempt to harm Kenney&#x27;s biggest rival, Brian Jean.

== British Columbia ==
* Sommers Affair (British Columbia Social Credit Party) — influence peddling and abuse of privilege on timber licenses by Forest Minister
* Gracie&#x27;s Finger (Social Credit Party) — gerrymandering in Vancouver-Little Mountain
* Lillooet Cattle Trail — cost overruns, poor design and other scandalous aspects on most expensive provincial infrastructure project in the 19th century
* Fantasy Gardens (Social Credit Party) — improper sale of property and influence-peddling by Premier Bill Vander Zalm, in connection with Asian gambling lord Tan Yu
* Stephen Rogers (Social Credit Party) — resigned as environment minister after a conflict of interest due to owning shares in a company
* Cliff Michael (Social Credit Party) — resigned from cabinet due to conflict of interest over the sale of some land
* Reid Affair (Social Credit Party) — Bill Reid forced to resign after a report showed that he was diverting lottery funds into a company owned by his former campaign manager
* Bud Smith (Social Credit Party) — resigned after tapes and transcripts of him talking disparagingly about a lawyer hired by the opposition NDP to investigate the Reid Affair.
* Robin Blencoe (New Democratic Party of British Columbia) — allegations of harassing an office employee.
* Phil Gaglardi (Social Credit Party) — improper use of expenses
* British Columbia Resources Investment Corporation (BCRIC or &quot;Brick&quot;) (BC Social Credit Party) — public boondoggle involving publicly distributed and soon-worthless shares of the former Crown Corporation
* Bingogate (NDP), 1990s — former MLA and MP David Stupich used money that was raised by a charity bingo to fund the Party. Mike Harcourt resigned as premier in February 1996 as result.
* Doman Scandal (Social Credit Party) — insider trading; Premier Bill Bennett and his brother Russell James Bennett had trading sanctions imposed against them and Harbanse Singh Doman, and were ordered to pay the British Columbia Securities Commission $1 million to cover the costs of an insider trading case that spanned 11 years
* Coquihalla Highway (Social Credit Party) — cost overruns and graft
* Casinogate (NDP) — Premier Glen Clark was charged but acquitted of breach of trust in connection with his official duties. Collusion between Global television and the RCMP in trying to incriminate Clark is alleged by many commentators. Dimitros Pilarinos was convicted of providing a benefit to the Premier, and the BC Conflict of Interest Commissioner concluded &quot;Receipt of such a benefit left Mr. Clark, albeit perhaps unwillingly, indebted to Mr. Pilarinos and meant that he might properly be considered to have an interest in seeing Mr. Pilarinos compensated in some way.&quot; 
* FastCat Fiasco (aka &quot;Ferrygate&quot; or simply &quot;the Fast Ferries&quot;), 1990s — construction of a fleet of high speed ferry vessels that ended up being massively over-budget and actually slower than existing ferries
* Wilson–Tyabji Affair (British Columbia Liberal Party) — semi-secret romance between Opposition Leader Gordon Wilson and his House Whip Judy Tyabji leads to their downfall

*BC Premier arrested in Hawaii for DUI (Liberals), 2003 — BC Premier Gordon Campbell was arrested and pleaded no contest for driving under the influence of alcohol while vacationing in Hawaii. Campbell was also implicated in Railgate (see previous).
* 2012–2013: Misfire Scandal: Under the leadership of Margaret MacDiarmid, BC Liberal Minister, Ministry of Health fires a number of employees and contractors on false pretences in what was dubbed the biggest Human Resources scandal in the history of British Columbia. The Ombudsperson investigated the matter and found that the BC Health Ministry, under the leadership of Margaret MacDiarmid, committed a number of wrongdoings. The case resulted in financial compensations, government apology and an endowment educational funding by the BC Government in memory of a worker who committed suicide after false accusations were laid against him, and led to his dismissal.
* Quick Wins ethnic outreach scandal (Liberals), 2013 — resignation of Minister John Yap and Deputy Chief of Staff for Premier Christy Clark due to use of public servants&#x27; time and resources for partisan purposes.
* Triple-Delete scandal (Liberals): In May 2015, it was revealed that over a dozen government emails relating to the RCMP investigation about the Highway of Tears were deleted by government staff following a freedom of information request. This was in violation of BC&#x27;s freedom of information act.
* CleanBC grants scandal (NDP): In April 2024, an investigation was initiated by the Minister of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation, Josie Osborne, into MNP LLP&#x27;s administration of two grant programs funded through the provincial carbon tax. The allegation was that one of MNP&#x27;s teams working in the province acted in the capacity as both the administrator and grant application consultant on the CleanBC grant program.

==Manitoba==

* Legislature scandal (Conservatives), 1915 — the construction of the Manitoba Legislative Building came with allegations of materials being stolen and over-expenditure of public funds by the Manitoba Conservatives.

* New Orleans Saints bounty scandal (2012) – the NFL discovered that the New Orleans Saints had operated a secret slush fund from 2009 to 2011 that paid &quot;bounties&quot; to defensive players for big plays during games, most controversially for injuring opponents. The scheme was allegedly organized by a number of players plus defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, with the acquiescence of head coach Sean Payton. Shortly after the investigation came to light, Williams was accused of running similar schemes while he was defensive coordinator of the Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans and Washington Redskins, as well as the head coach of the Buffalo Bills. The league suspended Williams indefinitely and Payton for one year and suspended the Saints&#x27; general manager and another assistant for parts of the 2012 season. Jonathan Vilma, a Saints player who had a major role in the scheme and reportedly offered a $10,000 bounty on Brett Favre, was suspended for the entire season and three other players were suspended for parts of the season. However, in September 2012, an arbitrator overturned the suspensions of the players involved in the affair. Williams&#x27; suspension ultimately lasted one year.
* Deflategate (2015) – during the AFC Championship Game, 11 of the 12 footballs under the Patriots&#x27; control during the first half were found to be inflated below the level mandated by the rulebook.

==Skating scandals==

=== Figure skating scandals ===
* Attack on Nancy Kerrigan - Nancy Kerrigan was attacked after a practice session at the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships. Kerrigan&#x27;s main team competitor, Tonya Harding, was accused of being involved in the attack.
* Kamila Valieva&#x27;s failed drug test - Kamila Valieva failed a drug test for a banned heart medication in December 2021. This drug test result only surfaced after the figure skating team event in the 2022 Beijing Olympic Games, in which she competed for the ROC. Despite the result of the drug test, Kamila Valieva was cleared to skate in the Beijing 2022 singles event by the Court of Arbitration for Sport the following week, as she was considered a protected person due to being only 15 years of age. This decision was highly controversial and has resulted in the minimum age for competing in the Olympic Games for figure skating to rise from 15 years of age to 17 years of age.

=== Short track speed skating scandals ===
* Cho Jae-beom was convicted for 10.5 years in jail in January 2021 of sexual abuse of multiple Olympic gold medalist Shim Suk-hee.

== Gliding scandals ==

* During the 2020 Women&#x27;s World Gliding Championships at Lake Keepit, Australia, the home team captain Terry Cubley (Executive Officer of the GFA) was charged with unsporting behaviour for hacking the official tracking system to bypass the mandatory 15 minute delay and forward real time competitors&#x27; positions to his team, granting a tactical advantage. An investigation revealed that Matt Gage had been closely involved with the developers of the tracking system, and was aware of an undocumented back door that allowed the team captain (Terry Cubley) to bypass the 15 minute delay. This real-time information was relayed by the team captain over the radio to the Australian pilots. This was the first time in the sport&#x27;s history that an entire team had been penalised for unsporting behaviour, with the Competition Director applying a penalty of 25 points per pilot per day. Controversially the pilots involved were spared disqualification only receiving a relatively trivial points reduction (compared to a competing pilot who was disqualified for infringing airspace earlier in the competition). Following a subsequent GFA investigation two of the Australian Team admitted to cheating and the GFA made a formal apology to the FAI and the wider gliding community. Terry Cubley was removed from his role as Vice President of the IGC, but chose to remain as Executive Officer of the GFA . The pilots involved chose to appeal against this decision, resulting in the longest and most comprehensive investigation in the FAIs history. The final judgement described the actions of the pilots as ‘reprehensible’, increased the penalty to disqualification and removed their flights from the competition record. The Appeal Tribunal also recommended the FAI to take further disciplinary action against those involved. Following the Tribunals verdict Lisa Turner (the Australian pilots’ representative to the tribunal) issued a press release re-iterating their denial of cheating, accused the tribunal of bias against the Australian team and announced a further appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport CAS.

== Golf scandals ==
* Jane Blalock cheating controversy – one of the LPGA Tour&#x27;s top players, Jane Blalock, was accused of illegally marking her golf ball on the green. She was suspended and fined by the tour, but Blalock in turn filed suit and won an injunction that allowed her to continue playing. Blalock eventually won her lawsuit and she and the LPGA reached an out-of-court settlement.
* Vijay Singh, a former number one golfer in the world, was suspended from the PGA Tour for using deer antler spray, which violated the PGA Tour Anti-Doping Policy. Likewise in 1985, Vijay Singh was caught erasing his score on a hole and replacing it with a lower score after the scorecard had been signed. Once the rules officials confirmed the allegations, Singh was banned from the Asian Tour. To this day, Singh has not acknowledged that he cheated.

<doc id="562584" wikidata="Q1056981" url="?curid=562584" title="Childe Cycle">
<text>The Childe Cycle is an unfinished series of science fiction novels by American writer Gordon R. Dickson. The name Childe Cycle is an allusion to &quot;Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came&quot;, a poem by Robert Browning, which provided inspiration for elements in the work. The series is sometimes referred to as the Dorsai series, after the Dorsai people who are central to it. The related short stories and novellas all center on the Dorsai, primarily members of the Graeme and Morgan families.

In addition to the six science fiction novels of the Cycle, Dickson had also planned three historical novels and three novels taking place in the present day. In an essay in his book &quot;Steel Brother&quot;, Dickson describes how he conceived the Childe Cycle, the panoramic &quot;consciously thematic&quot; treatment of the evolution of the human race, and the planned contents of the six never-written novels. Each group of three novels would include one focused on each of three &quot;archetypes, the Philosopher, the Warrior, or the Faith-Holder&quot;. The first novel&#x27;s protagonist would be mercenary John Hawkwood, who lived from the 1320s to 1394. Hawkwood &quot;has been referred to as the first of the modern generals&quot;. He defeated a Milanese ruler who might have stymied the Renaissance. The second historical novel was to deal with the poet John Milton (author of Paradise Lost) in the period he served as a &quot;Faith-Holder&quot; and &quot;Fanatic&quot;, a &quot;propagandist for the Cromwellian government&quot;. The third historical novel&#x27;s focus would have been on Robert Browning whose &quot;poetry is a vehicle for his philosophy&quot;. The three twentieth century novels would have focused on: &quot;the life and character of George Santayana to showcase a Philosopher&quot;, a World War II &quot;Warrior&quot;, and a female &quot;Faith-Holder&quot; in the 1980s. The latter novel was expected to deal with issues of space colonization, beginning a thread continuing through &quot;Necromancer&quot; and concluding with the full formation of the Splinter Cultures.

As originally envisioned, the Cycle was to stretch from the 14th century to the 24th century; the completed books begin in the 21st century. The cycle deals with the conflict between progress and conservatism. It also deals with the interaction and conflict among humanity&#x27;s traits, most importantly Courage, Faith, and Philosophy.

== Novels and shorter works ==
The science fiction novels of the main Childe Cycle include:

* &quot;Dorsai!&quot; (alternate title: &quot;The Genetic General&quot;) (1959)
* &quot;Necromancer&quot; (1962) (issued under the title &quot;No Room for Man&quot; between 1963 and 1974)
* &quot;Soldier, Ask Not&quot; (1967)
* &quot;Tactics of Mistake&quot; (1971)
* &quot;The Final Encyclopedia&quot; (1984)
* &quot;The Chantry Guild&quot; (1988)

The final book, to have been titled &quot;Childe&quot;, had not been completed at the time of Dickson&#x27;s death, and has never been published. Dickson&#x27;s essay in &quot;Steel Brother&quot; says it was to chronicle a battle &quot;in which the adventurous part of the id family wins its identity over the conservative part, and the human identity is made whole again&quot;.

In addition, there are four shorter pieces and three novels that take place in the same fictional universe as the Childe Cycle, but are not part of the core cycle.

* &quot;Lost Dorsai&quot; (novella) and &quot;Warrior&quot; (short story), published together in &quot;Lost Dorsai&quot; (1980)
* &quot;Amanda Morgan&quot; (novella) and &quot;Brothers&quot; (short story), published together in &quot;The Spirit of Dorsai&quot; (1979)

In the latter volume, the stories are framed by a conversation between Hal Mayne and Amanda Morgan, during the events of &quot;The Final Encyclopedia&quot;. &quot;Warrior&quot; (1965) and &quot;Brothers&quot; (1973) had previously appeared in other publications. The four works have since been collected in one volume as &quot;The Dorsai Companion&quot; (1986).

The three other novels are:

* &quot;Young Bleys&quot; (1991)
* &quot;Other&quot; (1994)
* &quot;Antagonist&quot; (with David W. Wixon) (2007)

These three novels concern the background and development of Bleys Ahrens, the antagonist of &quot;The Final Encyclopedia&quot; and &quot;The Chantry Guild&quot;. They take place in the decades leading up to those books, and were apparently added to the original series outline to provide more detail of the ultimate conflict in &quot;Childe&quot;. The year 2007 saw the publication of &quot;Antagonist&quot;, finished by Dickson&#x27;s long-time assistant David W. Wixon.

The first published reference to the Dorsai appeared in &quot;Lulungomeena&quot;, a 1954 short story published in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; and later dramatized on the &quot;X Minus One&quot; radio program. The narrator is a man from &quot;the Dorsai planets,&quot; who has been working far from home for a long time. The story portrays the Dorsai people as tough and matter-of-fact, but says little else about them.

== Chronology ==
The main sequence novels basically fall into four periods approximately a century apart.

* &quot;Necromancer&quot;: Late 21st century, shortly before humanity begins star travel
* &quot;Tactics of Mistake&quot;: Late 22nd century, in the early development of the splinter cultures. &quot;Amanda Morgan&quot; takes place at the same time as the crisis of this book.
* &quot;Soldier, Ask Not&quot; and &quot;Dorsai!&quot; occur around the same time as each other, and overlap, with some events described in both novels. Late 23rd century, after the splinter cultures have fully developed.
* &quot;The Final Encyclopedia&quot;, followed by &quot;The Chantry Guild&quot;: Mid-24th century, as the final conflict develops among the cultures.
* The final planned volume, &quot;Childe&quot;, was to resolve the conflict which had been set up in the last two books. Its events would immediately follow the events of &quot;The Chantry Guild&quot;.

== Splinter cultures ==
By the late 21st century, human culture begins to fragment into different aspects. Following the events of &quot;Necromancer&quot;, humanity has colonized some 14 Younger Worlds. The inhabitants of these worlds have evolved culturally, and to some extent, genetically, into several specialized Splinter Cultures. This was done by the racial collective unconscious itself as an experiment to see what aspects of humanity are the most important. The inhabitants of Earth (now called Old Earth, since New Earth is one of the Younger Worlds) remain &quot;full spectrum humans&quot; as a control.

The interstellar economy is based on the exchange of specialists, which puts Old Earth, the jack of all trades, at something of a disadvantage.

Of all the Splinter Cultures, three are the most successful:
* The Dorsai (Courage): The Dorsai, inhabitants of a Younger World also called Dorsai, are honorable, elite mercenaries. Given the book-selling nature of their occupation, the Childe Cycle focuses mainly on their exploits, to the extent that the Cycle is sometimes called the &quot;Dorsai series&quot;. The culture tends to have a number of Gaelic influences, including a love for the bagpipes, although their ancestry is drawn from all races and cultures. Dickson also mentioned in lectures that the &quot;ethnic food&quot; of the Dorsai is fish and chips, due to the great amount of surface water and oceans on their homeworld, with mutton being the most common red meat in the Dorsai diet.
* The Exotics (Philosophy): The Exotics are the inhabitants of Mara and Kultis. They are peaceful philosophers, the descendants of the 21st century Chantry Guild. The traits which Dickson assigns to the Exotics in many ways mirror the Human Potential Movement of the 1960s, in combining elements of Eastern philosophy and religion with psychology. The Exotics clearly have some vaguely described level of paranormal powers. They can, among other things, communicate between star systems far more quickly than a ship can travel, an ability no other culture has. The Exotics hire themselves out as psychiatrists and mediators, among other things. The paranormal ability of the Exotics is never shown definitively (save for Donal levitating with Exotic encouragement in &quot;Dorsai!&quot; and the events of &quot;Necromancer&quot;), and &quot;The Final Encyclopedia&quot; reveals that their rapid communications ability is based on the use of a carefully hidden network of spaceships used innovatively, rather than on paranormal abilities.
* The Friendlies (Faith/Fanaticism): The somewhat ironically named Friendlies inhabit the worlds of Harmony and Association. Friendlies can be true &quot;faith-holders&quot;, or they can be fanatics. The difference, according to the Cycle, is that true faith-holders are guided by their faith, while fanatics use their faith to justify their actions. The Friendly homeworlds experience continual sectarian civil war. On their home planets, they are primarily agrarian, but, like the Dorsai, they earn interstellar credit as mercenaries, fighting in other people&#x27;s wars. Unlike the Dorsai, Friendly mercenaries are drafted as cannon-fodder, with largely green troops and high casualty rates. However, they are tenacious defenders. While the Friendlies are sometimes presented as villains, their faith is co-equal in importance to humanity with the Courage of the Dorsai and the Philosophy of the Exotics. A recurring theme in the series is the experience of a young man placed among Friendlies, forced to gain respect for them. Dickson based the Friendlies on Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s &quot;Roundheads&quot; of the English Civil War.

Other Splinter Cultures include the hard scientists of Newton and Venus, the miners of Coby, the fishermen of Dunnin&#x27;s World, the engineers of Cassida, the Catholic farmers of St. Marie, and the merchants of Ceta.

The internal consistency of the series suggests that the resolution to be sought in &quot;Childe&quot; is the evolution of Responsible Man, individuals who integrate the three disciplines of the Dorsai, the Exotics, and the Friendlies to the overall advancement of humanity, and who do possess explicit if not yet well-defined paranormal abilities. As of &quot;The Chantry Guild&quot;, only Donal Graeme/Hal Mayne has achieved the full status of Responsible Man. The conflict which drives this evolution is the developing war between Old Earth, supplemented by the Dorsai and the Exotics, and the organization of Others led by Bleys Ahrens, with the aid of the Friendlies and a powerful (but largely irrelevant to the psychological conflict) coalition of the technically inclined younger worlds. The strength of the Others is that they are hybrids of two of the Splinter Cultures (Ahrens is of Friendly and Exotic extraction), and while less capable than the emerging Responsible Men they are significantly more numerous, and more interested in gaining power for themselves (as by Ahrens using his combined background to manipulate the entire Friendly culture to support his war against the Dorsai, Exotics, and Old Earth).

== Planets of the Childe Cycle ==

Dickson has admitted that he was frequently inconsistent on the total number of inhabited worlds. The correct total is sixteen, under nine stars (counting Alpha Centauri A and B separately). Some uninhabited planets also play a role in the series.
* Sol
** Mercury: Site of Project Springboard during the 21st century. Not a major inhabited world.
** Venus: Hard science culture. Research stations were set up early, expanded, and eventually became connected together.
** Old Earth: Homeworld of humanity, and most populated and richest of the worlds. Politically not very united.
** Mars: First human colony to be terraformed. Cold, and is not a major power.
* Alpha Centauri: Has 12 planetary bodies.
** Newton: Hard science culture, the leading world in science. It is also known to have the best physicists.
** Cassida: Hard science culture, known for its technicians and engineers. A poor world, it also provided mercenaries.
* Altair
** Dunnin&#x27;s World: A harsh, dry world, with low population and resources.
* Epsilon Eridani: Both Harmony and Association are ruled by the Joint Church Council (United Council of Churches). The two worlds are known for their cheap but poor mercenaries.
** Association: Poor world, lacking in many resources and has poor soil for growing crops.
** Harmony: Similar to Association.
* Fomalhaut
** Dorsai: A watery world of primarily island settlements. Known for having the highest quality professional mercenaries, and for producing soldiers unlike any other.
* Procyon: Mara and Kultis are ruled by the Exotics, and are known for producing the best psychologists.
** Mara
** Kultis
** Ste. Marie: A small Roman Catholic farming world.
** Zombri: An uninhabitable small world. Despite this, it is a strategic location.
** Coby: Mining planet. A world of tunnels and mines, where the surface is uninhabitable. Since all the other settled worlds, unlike Earth, are metal-poor, Coby is the primary source of metals for the other planets.
* Sirius
** New Earth: Once had an atmosphere of hydrogen sulphide. By the late 23rd Century, it had long been terraformed with a more breathable atmosphere. Has a large variety of cultures. Atland, a territory of New Earth, had a civil war fought between the North and South Partitions.
** Freiland
** Oriente: an uninhabited planet, airless with a highly eccentric orbit. It is important only as a strategic military base in &quot;Dorsai!&quot;
* Tau Ceti
** Ceta: Commercial low-gravity planet.

<doc id="562589" wikidata="Q131924" url="?curid=562589" title="Cryptococcus neoformans">
<text>Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated basidiomycetous yeast belonging to the class Tremellomycetes and an obligate aerobe that can live in both plants and animals. Its teleomorph is a filamentous fungus, formerly referred to &quot;Filobasidiella neoformans&quot;. In its yeast state, it is often found in bird excrement. It has remarkable genomic plasticity and genetic variability between its strains, making treatment of the disease it causes difficult. &quot;Cryptococcus neoformans&quot; causes disease primarily in immunocompromised hosts, such as HIV or cancer patients. In addition it has been shown to cause disease in apparently immunocompetent hosts, especially in developed countries.

==Classification==
&quot;Cryptococcus neoformans&quot; has undergone numerous nomenclature revisions since its first description in 1895. It formerly contained two varieties: &quot;C. neoformans &quot;var.&quot; neoformans&quot; and &quot;C. neoformans &quot; var.&quot; grubii&quot;. A third variety, &quot;C. neoformans &quot;var.&quot; gattii&quot;, was later defined as a distinct species, &quot;Cryptococcus gattii&quot;. The most recent classification system divides these varieties into seven species. &quot;C. neoformans&quot; refers to &quot;C. neoformans &quot; var.&quot; grubii&quot;. A new species name, &quot;Cryptococcus deneoformans&quot;, is used for the former &quot;C. neoformans &quot;var.&quot; neoformans&quot;. &quot;C. gattii&quot; is divided into five species.

The teleomorph was first described in 1975 by K.J. Kwon-Chung, who obtained cultures of &quot;Filobasidiella neoformans&quot; by crossing strains of the yeast &quot;C. neoformans&quot;. She was able to observe basidia similar to those of the genus &quot;Filobasidium&quot;, hence the name &quot;Filobasidiella&quot; for the new genus. Following changes to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, the practice of giving different names to teleomorph and anamorph forms of the same fungus was discontinued, meaning that &quot;Filobasidiella neoformans&quot; became a synonym of the earlier name &quot;Cryptococcus neoformans&quot;.

==Characteristics==
&quot;Cryptococcus neoformans&quot; typically grows as a yeast (unicellular) and replicates by budding. It makes hyphae during mating, and eventually creates basidiospores at the end of the hyphae before producing spores. Under host-relevant conditions, including low glucose, serum, 5% carbon dioxide, and low iron, among others, the cells produce a characteristic polysaccharide capsule. The recognition of &quot;C. neoformans&quot; in Gram-stained smears of purulent exudates may be hampered by the presence of the large gelatinous capsule which apparently prevents definitive staining of the yeast-like cells. In such stained preparations, it may appear either as round cells with Gram-positive granular inclusions impressed upon a pale lavender cytoplasmic background or as Gram-negative lipoid bodies. When grown as a yeast, &quot;C. neoformans&quot; has a prominent capsule composed mostly of polysaccharides. Under the microscope, the India ink stain is used for easy visualization of the capsule in cerebral spinal fluid. The particles of ink pigment do not enter the capsule that surrounds the spherical yeast cell, resulting in a zone of clearance or &quot;halo&quot; around the cells. This allows for quick and easy identification of &quot;C. neoformans&quot;. Unusual morphological forms are rarely seen. For identification in tissue, mucicarmine stain provides specific staining of polysaccharide cell wall in &quot;C. neoformans&quot;. Cryptococcal antigen from cerebrospinal fluid is thought to be the best test for diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis in terms of sensitivity, though it might be unreliable in HIV-positive patients.

The first genome sequence for a strain of &quot;C. neoformans&quot; (var. &quot;neoformans&quot;; now &quot;C. deneoformans&quot;) was published in 2005.

Studies suggest that colonies of &quot;C. neoformans&quot; and related fungi growing within the ruins of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant may be able to metabolize ionizing radiation.

==Pathology==
Infection with &quot;C. neoformans&quot; is termed cryptococcosis. Most infections with &quot;C. neoformans&quot; occur in the lungs, as the fungus enters its host through the respiratory route. Because it is normally a harmless soil fungus, &quot;C. neoformans&quot; must first adapt to its new environment inside the human body, making several virulent transformations, including the formation of a polysaccharide capsule. The specific factors that enable this transformation involve sensory receptor proteins common to most soil fungi (pH sensors, carbon dioxide sensors, and intracellular iron detectors) which have been adapted to induce &quot;C. neoformans&quot; cells into rapidly becoming a dangerous, disease-causing organism.

The fungus is a facultative intracellular pathogen that can utilize host phagocytes to spread within the body. &quot;C. neoformans&quot; was the first intracellular pathogen for which the non-lytic escape process termed vomocytosis was observed. It has been speculated that this ability to manipulate host cells results from environmental selective pressure by amoebae, a hypothesis first proposed by Arturo Casadevall under the term &quot;accidental virulence&quot;.

In human infection, &quot;C. neoformans&quot; is spread by inhalation of aerosolized basidiospores or dehydrated fungal cells, and can disseminate to the central nervous system, where it can cause meningoencephalitis. In the lungs, &quot;C. neoformans&quot; cells are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages. Macrophages produce oxidative and nitrosative agents, creating a hostile environment, to kill invading pathogens. However, some &quot;C. neoformans&quot; cells can survive intracellularly in macrophages because of the protective nature of the polysaccharide capsule as well as its ability to produce melanin. Intracellular survival appears to be one of the factors contributing to latency, disseminated disease, and resistance to eradication by antifungal agents. One mechanism by which &quot;C. neoformans&quot; survives the hostile intracellular environment of the macrophage involves upregulation of expression of genes involved in responses to oxidative stress.

Traversal of the blood–brain barrier by &quot;C. neoformans&quot; plays a key role in meningitis pathogenesis. However, precise mechanisms by which it passes the blood-brain barrier are still unknown; a 2014 study in rats suggested an important role of secreted serine proteases. The metalloprotease Mpr1 has been demonstrated to be critical in blood-brain barrier penetration.

=== AIDS ===
Fungal meningitis and encephalitis are frequently associated with HIV-positive patients with low T-cell counts. &quot;C. neoformans&quot; is one of the illnesses that definitionally marks the point at which a person with HIV may be considered to have AIDS. Infections with this fungus were thought to be rare in people with fully functioning immune systems, hence &quot;C. neoformans&quot; is often referred to as an opportunistic pathogen. However, a study from 2024 done in Australia and New Zealand showed the vast majority of recorded infections to be in non-HIV patients.

=== Changes in reproductive pattern ===
The vast majority of environmental and clinical isolates of &quot;C. neoformans&quot; are mating type alpha. Filaments of mating type alpha have haploid nuclei ordinarily, but these can undergo a process of diploidization (perhaps by endoduplication or stimulated nuclear fusion) to form diploid cells termed blastospores. The diploid nuclei of blastospores are able to undergo meiosis, including recombination, to form haploid basidiospores that can then be dispersed. This process is referred to as monokaryotic fruiting. Required for this process is a gene designated &quot;dmc1&quot;, a conserved homologue of genes &quot;recA&quot; in bacteria, and &quot;rad51&quot; in eukaryotes (see articles recA and rad51). &quot;Dmc1&quot; mediates homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis and repair of double-strand breaks in DNA. One benefit of meiosis in &quot;C. neoformans&quot; could be to promote DNA repair in the DNA-damaging environment caused by the oxidative and nitrosative agents produced in macrophages. Thus, &quot;C. neoformans&quot; can undergo a meiotic process, monokaryotic fruiting, that may promote recombinational repair in the oxidative, DNA-damaging environment of the host macrophage, and this may contribute to its virulence.

==Serious complications of human infection==
Infection begins in the lungs, and from there the fungus can disseminate to the brain and other body parts via macrophages. An infection of the brain caused by &quot;C. neoformans&quot; is referred to as cryptococcal meningitis, which is most often fatal when left untreated. Cryptococcal meningitis causes more than 180,000 deaths annually. CNS (central nervous system) infections may also be present as a brain abscesses known as &quot;cryptococcomas&quot;, subdural effusions, dementia, isolated cranial nerve lesions, spinal cord lesions, and ischemic stroke. The estimated one-year mortality of HIV-related people who receive treatment for cryptococcal meningitis is 70% in low-income countries versus 20–30% for high-income countries. Symptoms include headache, fever, neck stiffness, nausea and vomiting, photophobia. Diagnosis methods include a serum cryptococcal antigen test and lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination to detect &quot;C. neoformans&quot;.

==Treatment==

Cryptococcosis that does not affect the central nervous system can be treated with fluconazole alone.

It was recommended in 2000 that cryptococcal meningitis be treated for two weeks with intravenous amphotericin B 0.7–1.0 mg/kg per day and oral flucytosine 100 mg/kg per day (or intravenous flucytosine 75 mg/kg per dayday if the patient is unable to swallow), followed by oral fluconazole 400–800 mg daily for ten weeks and then 200 mg daily for at least one year and until the patient&#x27;s CD4 count is above 200 cells/mcl. Flucytosine is a generic, off-patent medicine, but the cost of two weeks of flucytosine therapy is about US$10,000, so that flucytosine has been unavailable in low- and middle-income countries. In 1970, flucytosine was available in Africa. A dose of 200 mg/kg per day of flucytosine is associated with more side effects but is not more effective.

A single high dose of liposomal amphotericin B with 14 days of flucytosine and fluconazole is recommended by the newest WHO guideline for cryptococcal meningitis. A new study found that brain glucose can trigger amphotericin B (AmB) tolerance of &quot;C. neoformans&quot; during meningitis which means it needs longer treatment time to kill the fungal cells. The study found that the brain glucose induced AmB tolerance of &quot;C. neoformans&quot; via glucose repression activator Mig1. Mig1 inhibits the production of ergosterol, the target of AmB, and promotes the production of inositol phosphoryl ceramide (IPC), which competes with AmB for ergosterol to limit AmB efficacy in mouse brain and human CSF. Strikingly, Results of this study indicated that IPC synthase inhibitor aureobasidin A (AbA) can enhance the anti-cryptococcal activity of AmB. AbA+AmB AmB had an even better therapeutic effect in a mouse model of cryptococcal meningitis than AmB+flucytosine which may bring new hope for the treatment of Cryptococcal meningitis.

In Africa, oral fluconazole at a rate of 200 mg daily is often used. However, this does not result in cure, because it merely suppresses the fungus and does not kill it; viable fungus can continue to be grown from cerebrospinal fluid of patients not having taken fluconazole for many months. An increased dose of 400 mg daily does not improve outcomes, but prospective studies from Uganda and Malawi reported that higher doses of 1200 mg per day have more fungicidal activity. The outcomes with fluconazole monotherapy have 30% worse survival than amphotericin-based therapies, in a recent systematic review.

The current treatment options for cryptococcosis are not optimal for treatment. AmB is highly toxic to humans, and both fluconazole and flucytosine have been shown to cause development of drug resistanse in &quot;C. neoformans&quot;. A recent study from 2024 suggested brilacidin as an alternative treatment option. Brilacidin was shown to be non-toxic and it caused no drug resistance development in &quot;C. neoformans&quot;, while still being efficient at causing fungal mortality. Brilacidin enhances permiability of the cell wall and membrane by binding to ergosterol and disrupting its distribution. It also affects the cell wall integrity pathway and disrupts calsium metabolism. Through these methods it not only causes cell mortality on its own, but also enables more effective use of other antifungal agents such as AmB against &quot;C. neoformans.&quot;

<doc id="562592" wikidata="Q106247012" url="?curid=562592" title="History of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict">
<text>The history of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] traces back to the late 19th century when Zionists sought to establish a homeland for the Jewish people in Ottoman-controlled Palestine, a region roughly corresponding to the Land of Israel in Jewish tradition. The Balfour Declaration of 1917, issued by the British government, endorsed the idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, which led to an influx of Jewish immigrants to the region. Following World War II and the Holocaust, international pressure mounted for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, leading to the creation of Israel in 1948.

The establishment of Israel, and the war that followed and preceded it, led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who became refugees, sparking a decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people. The Palestinians seek to establish their own independent state in at least one part of historic Palestine. Israeli defense of its own borders, control over the West Bank, the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip, and Palestinian internal politics currently make the Palestinians&#x27; goal out of reach.

Numerous peace negotiations have taken place over the years, but a long-term peace agreement has not been reached. The conflict has been marked by violence, including Palestinian political violence and military operations by Israel. The United States and other countries have played a key role in attempting to broker peace, but many obstacles remain, including the issue of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, the status of Jerusalem, and the ultimate fate of Palestinian refugees.

==Background==
===National movements===

Before World War I, the Middle East region, including the Ottoman Syria (the southern part of which are regarded as Palestine), was under the control of the Ottoman Empire for nearly 400 years. Towards the end of the 19th century, Palestine, which was divided between the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem, Syria Vilayet and Beirut Vilayet, was inhabited predominantly by Arab Muslims, both farmers and Bedouin (principally in the Negev and Jordan Valley), with smaller numbers of Christians (mostly Arabs), Druze, Circassians and Jews (predominantly Sephardic). At that time most of the Jews worldwide lived outside Palestine, predominantly in eastern and central Europe, with significant communities in the Mediterranean, the Middle East and the Americas.
The roots of the conflict can be traced to the late 19th century, with the rise of national movements, including Zionism and Arab nationalism. Though the Jewish aspiration to return to Zion had been part of Jewish religious thought for more than a millennium, the Jewish population of Europe and to some degree Middle East began to more actively discuss immigration back to the Land of Israel, and the re-establishment of the Jewish Nation, only between 1859 and the 1880s, largely as a solution to the widespread persecution of Jews, and antisemitism in Russia and Europe. As a result, the Zionist movement, the modern movement for the creation of a homeland for the Jewish people, was established as a political movement in 1897.

The Zionist movement called for the establishment of a nation state for the Jewish people in Palestine, which would serve as a haven for the Jews of the world and in which they would have the right for self-determination. Zionists increasingly came to hold that this state should be in their historic homeland, which they referred to as the Land of Israel. The World Zionist Organization and the Jewish National Fund encouraged immigration and funded purchase of land, both under Ottoman rule and under British rule, in the region of Palestine while Arab nationalism, at least in an early form, and Syrian nationalism were the dominant tendencies, along with continued loyalty to the Ottoman state, in the area.

According to Benny Morris, among the first recorded violent incidents between Arabs and the newly immigrated Jews in Palestine was the accidental shooting death of an Arab man in Safed, during a wedding in December 1882, by a Jewish guard of the newly formed Rosh Pinna. In response, about 200 Arabs descended on the Jewish settlement throwing stones and vandalizing property. Another incident happened in Petah Tikva, where in early 1886 the Jewish settlers demanded that their tenants vacate the disputed land and started encroaching on it. On March 28, a Jewish settler crossing this land was attacked and robbed of his horse by Yahudiya Arabs, while the settlers confiscated nine mules found grazing in their fields, though it is not clear which incident came first and which was the retaliation. The Jewish settlers refused to return the mules, a decision viewed as a provocation. The following day, when most of the settlement&#x27;s men folk were away, fifty or sixty Arab villagers attacked Petach Tikva, vandalizing houses and fields and carrying off much of the livestock. Four Jews were injured and a fifth, an elderly woman with a heart condition, died four days later.

By 1908, thirteen Jews had been killed by Arabs, with four of them killed in what Benny Morris calls &quot;nationalist circumstances&quot;, the others in the course of robberies and other crimes. In the next five years twelve Jewish settlement guards were killed by Arabs. Settlers began to speak more and more of Arab &quot;hatred&quot; and &quot;nationalism&quot; lurking behind the increasing depredations, rather than mere &quot;banditry&quot;.

Zionist ambitions were increasingly identified as a threat by the Arab leaders in Palestine region. Certain developments, such as the acquisition of lands from Arab owners for Jewish settlements, which led to the eviction of the fellaheen from the lands which they cultivated as tenant farmers, aggravated the tension between the parties and caused the Arab population in the region of Palestine to feel dispossessed of their lands. Ottoman land-purchase regulations were invoked following local complaints in opposition to increasing immigration. Ottoman policy makers in the late 19th century were apprehensive of the increased Russian and European influence in the region, partly as a result of a large immigration wave from the Russian Empire. The Ottoman authorities feared the loyalty of the new immigrants not so much because of their Jewishness but because of concern that their loyalty was primarily to their country of origin, Russia, with whom the Ottoman Empire had a long history of conflicts: immigrant loyalty to Russia might ultimately undermine Turkish control in the region of Palestine. This concern was fomented by the example seen in the dismantling of Ottoman authority in the Balkan region. European immigration was also considered by local residents to be a threat to the cultural make-up of the region. The regional significance of the anti-Jewish riots (&quot;pogroms&quot;) in Russia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and anti-immigration legislation being enacted in Europe was that Jewish immigration waves began arriving in Palestine (see First Aliyah and Second Aliyah). As a result of the extent of the various Zionist enterprises which started becoming apparent, the Arab population in the Palestine region began protesting against the acquisition of lands by the Jewish population. As a result, in 1892 the Ottoman authorities banned land sales to foreigners. By 1914 the Jewish population in Palestine had risen to over 60,000, with around 33,000 of these being recent settlers.

===World War I and aftermath (1917–20)===

As a result of a mutual defense treaty that the Ottoman Empire made with Germany, during World War I the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers opposed to Great Britain and France. The possibility of releasing Palestine from the control of the Ottoman Empire led the new Jewish population and the Arab population in Palestine to support the alignment of the United Kingdom, France, and Russia during World War I. In 1915, the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence was formed as an agreement with Arab leaders to grant sovereignty to Arab lands under Ottoman control to form an Arab state in exchange for the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottomans. However, the Balfour Declaration in 1917 proposed to &quot;favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, but that nothing should be done to prejudice the civil and religious rights of the existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine.&quot; In 1916, the Anglo-French Sykes–Picot Agreement allocated to the British Empire the area of present-day Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian territories, and the area of present-day Iraq. The Balfour Declaration was seen by Jewish nationalists as the cornerstone of a future Jewish homeland on both sides of the Jordan River, but increased the concerns of the Arab population in the Palestine region.

In 1917, the British succeeded in defeating the Ottoman Turkish forces and occupied the Palestine region. The land remained under British military administration for the remainder of the war.

On January 3, 1919, future president of the World Zionist Organization Chaim Weizmann and the future King Faisal I of Iraq signed the Faisal-Weizmann Agreement in which Faisal provisionally accepted the Balfour Declaration conditional on the fulfillment of British wartime promises of Palestine being included in the area of Arab independence.

At the 1919 Paris Peace Conference and Treaty of Versailles, Turkey&#x27;s loss of its Middle East Empire was formalized.

===Intercommunal violence in Mandatory Palestine===

====Before World War II====
After World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, in April 1920 the Allied Supreme Council meeting at San Remo granted to Britain the mandates for Palestine and Transjordan (the territories that include the area of present-day Israel, Jordan, West Bank and the Gaza Strip), endorsing the terms of the Balfour Declaration. Historian Laura Robson has described this as part of the &quot;colonial practice of territorializing sectarian identity&quot; whereby the &quot;designation &quot;Jewish&quot; would carry with it all sorts of political baggage totally absent from the prior experience of the many Jewish communities of the Arab Ottoman world and their Muslim and Christian compatriots&quot;.

In August 1920, this was officially acknowledged in the Treaty of Sèvres. Both Zionist and Arab representatives attended the conference, where they met and signed an agreement to cooperate. The agreement was never implemented. The borders and terms under which the mandate was to be held were not finalized until September 1922. Article 25 of the mandate specified that the eastern area (then known as Transjordan or Transjordania) did not have to be subject to all parts of the Mandate, notably the provisions regarding a Jewish national home. This was used by the British as one rationale to establish an autonomous Arab state under the mandate, which it saw as at least partially fulfilling the undertakings in the Hussein-McMahon Correspondence. On April 11, 1921, the British passed administration of the eastern region of the British Mandate to the Hashemite Arab dynasty from the Hejaz region (a region located in present-day Saudi Arabia) and on May 15, 1923 recognized it as an autonomous state, thereby eliminating Jewish national aspirations on that part of the Mandatory Palestine. The mandate over Transjordan ended on May 22, 1946, when the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan (later Jordan) gained independence.

Palestinian nationalism was marked by a reaction to the Zionist movement and to Jewish settlement in Palestine as well as by a desire for self-determination by the Arab population in the region. Jewish immigration to Palestine continued to grow significantly during the period of the British Mandate in Palestine, mainly due to the growth of anti-Semitism in Europe. Between 1919 and 1926, 90,000 immigrants arrived in Palestine because of the anti-Semitic manifestations, such as the pogroms in Ukraine in which 100,000 Jews were killed. Some of these immigrants were absorbed in Jewish communities established on lands purchased legally by Zionist agencies from absentee landlords. In some cases, a large acquisition of lands, from absentee landlords, led to the replacement of the fellahin tenant farmers with European Jewish settlers, causing Palestinian Arabs to feel dispossessed. Jewish immigration to Palestine was especially significant after the rise of the Nazis to power in Germany, following which the Jewish population in Palestine doubled.
The Arab population in Palestine opposed the increase of the Jewish population because the new immigrants refused to lease or sell land to Palestinians, or hire them. During the 1920s relations between the Jewish and Arab populations deteriorated and the hostility between the two groups intensified.

From 1920, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Haj Mohammad Amin al-Husayni became the leader of the Palestinian Arab movement and played a key role in inciting religious riots against the Jewish population in Palestine. The Mufti stirred religious passions against Jews by alleging that Jews were seeking to rebuild the Jewish Temple on the site of the Dome of the Rock and Jami Al-Aqsa.

The first major riots against the Jewish population in Palestine were the Jaffa riots in 1921. As a result of the Jaffa riots, the Haganah was founded as a defense force for the Jewish population of the British Mandate for Palestine. Religious tension over the Kotel and the escalation of the tensions between the Arab and Jewish populations led to the 1929 Palestine riots. In these religious-nationalist riots, Jews were massacred in Hebron. Devastation also took place in Safed and Jerusalem. In 1936, as Europe was preparing for war, the Supreme Muslim Council in Palestine, led by Amin al-Husayni, instigated the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine in which Palestinian Arabs rioted and murdered Jews in various cities. In 1937 Amin al-Husayni, who was wanted by the British, fled Palestine and took refuge successively in Lebanon, Iraq, Italy and finally Nazi Germany.

The British responded to the outbreaks of violence with the Haycraft Commission of Inquiry (1921), the Shaw Report (1930), the Peel Commission of 1936–1937, the Woodhead Commission (1938) and the White Paper of 1939.

The Peel Commission of 1937 was the first to propose a two-state solution to the conflict, whereby Palestine would be divided into two states: one Arab state and one Jewish state. The Jewish state would include the coastal plain, Jezreel Valley, Beit She&#x27;an and the Galilee, while the Arab state would include Transjordan, Judea and Samaria, the Jordan Valley, and the Negev. The 2 main Jewish leaders, Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion convinced the Zionist Congress to approve continued negotiations with the British even though it rejected the detailed plan. The Arab leadership in Palestine rejected the conclusions and refused to share any land in Palestine with the Jewish population. The rejection of the Peel Commission&#x27;s proposal by The Arabs led to the establishment of the Woodhead Commission. The Woodhead Commission considered three different plans, one of which was based on the Peel plan. Reporting in 1938, the Commission rejected the Peel plan primarily on the grounds that it could not be implemented without a massive forced transfer of Arabs (an option that the British government had already ruled out). With dissent from some of its members, the Commission instead recommended a plan that would leave the Galilee under British mandate, but emphasised serious problems with it that included a lack of financial self-sufficiency of the proposed Arab State. The British Government accompanied the publication of the Woodhead Report by a statement of policy rejecting partition as impracticable due to &quot;political, administrative and financial difficulties&quot;.

In May 1939 the British government released a new policy paper which sought to implement a one-state solution in Palestine, significantly reduced the number of Jewish immigrants allowed to enter Palestine by establishing a quota for Jewish immigration which was set by the British government in the short-term and which would be set by the Arab leadership in the long-term. The quota also placed restrictions on the rights of Jews to buy land from Arabs, in an attempt to limit the socio-political damage. These restrictions remained until the end of the mandate period, a period which occurred in parallel with World War II and the Holocaust, during which many Jewish refugees tried to escape from Europe. As a result, during the 1930s and 1940s the leadership of the Yishuv arranged a couple of illegal immigration waves of Jews to the British Mandate of Palestine (see also Aliyah Bet), which caused even more tensions in the region.

Ben-Gurion said he wanted to &quot;concentrate the masses of our people in this country [Palestine] and its environs.&quot; When he proposed accepting the Peel proposals in 1937, which included a Jewish state in part of Palestine, Ben-Gurion told the twentieth Zionist Congress, &quot;The Jewish state now being offered to us is not the Zionist objective. [...] But it can serve as a decisive stage along the path to greater Zionist implementation. It will consolidate in Palestine, within the shortest possible time, the real Jewish force, which will lead us to our historic goal&quot;. In a discussion in the Jewish Agency he said that he wanted a Jewish-Arab agreement &quot;on the assumption that after we become a strong force, as a result of the creation of the state, we shall abolish partition and expand to the whole of Palestine.&quot;

====During World War II====
In May 1941, the exiled Palestinian leader Amin al-Husayni issued a fatwa for a holy war against Britain. In 1941 during a meeting with Adolf Hitler Amin al-Husayni asked Germany to oppose, as part of the Arab struggle for independence, the establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine. He received a promise from Hitler that Germany would eliminate the existing Jewish foundations in Palestine after the Germans had gained victory in the war. During the war al-Husayni served as a propagandist for Germany.

====After World War II====
After World War II, as a result of the British policies, the Jewish resistance organizations united and established the Jewish Resistance Movement which coordinated armed attacks against the British military which took place between 1945 and 1946. Following the King David Hotel bombing (in which the Irgun blew up the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, the headquarters of the British administration), which shocked the public because of the deaths of many innocent civilians, the Jewish Resistance Movement was disassembled in 1946. The leadership of the Yishuv decided instead to concentrate their efforts on the illegal immigration and began to organize a massive immigration of European Jewish refugees to Palestine using small boats operating in secrecy, many of which were captured at sea by the British and imprisoned in camps on Cyprus. About 70,000 Jews were brought to Palestine in this way in 1946 and 1947. Details of the Holocaust had a major effect on the situation in Palestine and propelled large support for the Zionist movement.

====1947 partition====
On May 15, 1947, the General Assembly of the newly formed United Nations resolved that a committee, (United Nations Special Committee on Palestine), be created &quot;to prepare for consideration at the next regular session of the Assembly a report on the question of Palestine&quot;. The Committee was to consist of the representatives of Australia, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Guatemala, India, Iran, Netherlands, Peru, Sweden, Uruguay and Yugoslavia.

In Chapter VI of the report of September 3, 1947, the majority of the Committee proposed recommendations for consideration by the General Assembly that &quot;Palestine within its present borders, following a transitional period of two years from September 1, 1947, shall be constituted into an independent Arab State, an independent Jewish State, and the City of Jerusalem&quot;. The Arab state was supposed to comprise roughly and would contain a tiny Jewish population. The Jewish State was supposed to be roughly in size and was supposed to contain a sizable Arab minority population. Neither state would be contiguous. Jerusalem and Bethlehem were to be put under the control of the United Nations. Neither side was satisfied with the Partition Plan. The Jews disliked losing Jerusalem—which had a majority Jewish population at that time—and worried about the tenability of a noncontiguous state. However, most of the Jews in Palestine accepted the plan, and the Jewish Agency (the de facto government of the Yishuv) campaigned fervently for its approval. The more extreme Jewish groups, such as the Irgun, rejected the plan. The Arab leadership argued that it violated the rights of the majority of the people in Palestine, which at the time was 67% non-Jewish (1,237,000) and 33% Jewish (608,000). Arab leaders also argued a large number of Arabs would be trapped in the Jewish State. Every major Arab leader objected in principle to the right of the Jews to an independent state in Palestine, reflecting the policies of the Arab League.

On November 29, 1947, the General Assembly adopted a resolution recommending &quot;to the United Kingdom, as the mandatory Power for Palestine, and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation, with regard to the future government of Palestine, of the Plan of Partition with Economic Union&quot;, (a slightly amended version of the plan in Chapter VI of the report of September 3, 1947), as Resolution 181(II)). Thirty-three states voted in favor of the resolution, while 13 countries opposed it. Ten countries abstained from the vote. The Yishuv accepted the plan, but the Arabs in Palestine and the surrounding Arab states rejected the plan. The Arab countries (all of which had opposed the plan) proposed to query the International Court of Justice on the competence of the General Assembly to partition a country against the wishes of the majority of its inhabitants, but were again defeated.

The Plan (PART I A., Clause 3.) provided that &quot;Independent Arab and Jewish States and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem, should come into existence in Palestine two months after the evacuation of the armed forces of the mandatory Power has been completed but in any case not later than October 1, 1948 ...&quot;

====1947–1948 war: Conflict between the Yishuv and Palestinian Arabs====
The approval of the plan sparked attacks carried out by Arab irregulars against the Jewish population in Palestine. Fighting began almost as soon as the Resolution of November 29, 1947 was approved. Shooting, stoning, and rioting continued apace in the following days. The consulates of Poland and Sweden, both of whose governments had voted for partition, were attacked. Bombs were thrown into cafes, Molotov cocktails were hurled at shops, and a synagogue was set on fire. Arab gunmen attacked Jewish cars and trucks, snipers in Jaffa began firing at passers-by in Tel Aviv and Jaffa Arabs attacked close Tel Aviv neighborhood.

As the British evacuation from the region progressed, the violence became more prevalent. Murders, reprisals, and counter-reprisals came fast on each other&#x27;s heels, resulting in dozens of victims killed on both sides in the process. The Deir Yassin massacre took place on April 9, 1948, when around 120 fighters from the Irgun Zevai Leumi and the Israeli Stern Gang Zionist paramilitary groups attacked Deir Yassin near Jerusalem, a Palestinian Arab village of roughly 600 people. The sanguinary impasse persisted as no force intervened to put a stop to the escalating cycles of violence. During the first two months of the war, about 1,000 people were killed and 2,000 injured. By the end of March, the figure had risen to 2,000 dead and 4,000 wounded.
On May 14, 1948, one day before the British Mandate expired, Ben-Gurion declared &quot;the establishment of a Jewish State in Eretz-Israel, to be known as the State of Israel&quot;. The declaration was stated to be &quot;by virtue of our natural and historic right and on the strength of the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly&quot;. The Declaration stated that the State of Israel would &quot;ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex; it will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture; it will safeguard the Holy Places of all religions; and it will be faithful to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations&quot;.

==The conflict==
===1948–49 war: Israel and the Arab states===

The termination of the British mandate over Palestine and the Israeli Declaration of Independence sparked a full-scale war (1948 Arab–Israeli War) which erupted after May 14, 1948. On 15–16 May, the four armies of Jordan, Syria, Egypt and Iraq invaded/intervened in what had been the area of the British Mandate followed not long after by units from Lebanon.

In the introduction to the cablegram from the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States to the UN Secretary-General on May 15, 1948, the Arab League gave reasons for its &quot;intervention&quot;, &quot;On the occasion of the intervention of Arab States in Palestine to restore law and order and to prevent disturbances prevailing in Palestine from spreading into their territories and to check further bloodshed&quot;. Clause 10.(a) of the Cablegram provided:
:&quot;10. Now that the Mandate over Palestine has come to an end, leaving no legally constituted authority behind in order to administer law and order in the country and afford the necessary and adequate protection to life and property, the Arab States declare as follows:
:&quot;(a) The right to set up a Government in Palestine pertains to its inhabitants under the principles of self-determination recognized by the Covenant of the League of Nations as well as the United Nations Charter&quot;.

While Arab commanders ordered villagers to evacuate for military purposes in isolated areas, there is no evidence that the Arab leadership made a blanket call for evacuation and in fact most urged Palestinians to stay in their homes. Assaults by the Haganah on major Arab population centers like Jaffa and Haifa as well as expulsions carried out by groups like the Irgun and Lehi such as at Deir Yassin and Lydda led to the exodus of large portions of the Arab masses. Factors such as the earlier flight by the Palestinian elite and the psychological effects of Jewish atrocities (stories which both sides propagated) also played important roles in the Palestinian flight.

The war resulted in an Israeli victory, with Israel annexing territory beyond the partition borders for a proposed Jewish state and into the borders for a proposed Palestinian Arab state. Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt signed the 1949 Armistice Agreements with Israel. The remaining territories, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, were occupied by Egypt and Transjordan, respectively. Jordan also annexed East Jerusalem while Israel administered West Jerusalem. In 1950, the West Bank was unilaterally incorporated into Jordan.

===Refugees===
Between 700,000 and 750,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled from the area that became Israel and became what is known today as the Palestinian refugees. The Palestinian refugees were not allowed to return to Israel and most of the neighboring Arab states, with the exception of Transjordan, denied granting them—or their descendants—citizenship. In 1949, Israel offered to allow some members of families that had been separated during the war to return, to release refugee accounts frozen in Israeli banks, and to repatriate 100,000 refugees. The Arab states rejected this compromise, at least in part because they were unwilling to take any action that might be construed as recognition of Israel. As of today, most of them still live in refugee camps and the question of how their situation should be resolved remains one of the main issues of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

Due to the 1948 Arab–Israeli war, about 856,000 Jews fled or were expelled from their homes in Arab countries and most were forced to abandon their property. Jews from Libya, Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and North Africa left due to physical and political insecurity, with the majority being forced to abandon their properties. 260,000 reached Israel in 1948–1951, 600,000 by 1972.

While most of the Palestinian Arab population that remained in Israel after the war was granted an Israeli citizenship, Arab Israelis were subject to martial law up to 1966. A variety of legal measures facilitated the transfer of land abandoned by Arabs to state ownership. In 1966, security restrictions placed on Arab citizens of Israel were lifted completely, the government set about dismantling most of the discriminatory laws, and Arab citizens of Israel were granted the same rights as Jewish citizens.

After the 1948 war, some of the Palestinian refugees who lived in camps in the West Bank within Jordanian controlled territory, the Gaza Strip Egyptian controlled territory and Syria tried to return by infiltration into Israeli territory, and some of those Palestinians who had remained in Israel were declared infiltrators by Israel and were deported. Ben-Gurion emphatically rejected the return of refugees in the Israeli Cabinet decision of June 1948 reiterated in a letter to the UN of August 2, 1949 containing the text of a statement made by Moshe Sharett on August 1, 1948 where the basic attitude of the Israeli Government was that a solution must be sought, not through the return of the refugees to Israel, but through the resettlement of the Palestinian Arab refugee population in other states.

===1950–67, Six-Day War===

Violence was ongoing during almost the entire period from 1950 through 1967. It includes attacks on civilians in Israel carried out by the Jordanian Army, such as the Ramat Rachel archaeologists shooting attack, mass-casualty attacks on Israeli civilians carried out by Palestinian militants then usually called fedayeen, include the Yehud attack, the Ma&#x27;ale Akrabim massacre, the Beit Oved attack, the Shafir shooting attack, the 1956 Eilat bus ambush, the Ein Ofarim killings, and the Negev desert road ambush; major Israeli attacks include the Beit Jalla, the Qibya massacre, the Nahalin reprisal raid, and the Rantis and Falameh reprisal raids. The Lavon Affair led to a deeper distrust of Jews in Egypt, from whose community key agents in the operation had been recruited, and as a result Egypt retaliated against its Jewish community. After Israel&#x27;s raid on an Egyptian military outpost in Gaza in February 1955 killed 37 Egyptian soldiers the Egyptian government began to actively sponsor, train, and arm the Palestinian volunteers from Gaza as fedayeen units which committed raids into Israel.

In 1967, after years of Egyptian-aided Palestinian fedayeen attacks stemming from the Gaza Strip, the Egyptian expulsion of UNEF, Egypt&#x27;s amassing of an increased number of troops in the Sinai Peninsula, and several other threatening gestures from other neighboring Arab nations, Israel launched a preemptive strike against Egypt. The strike and the operations that followed became known as the Six-Day War. At the end of the Six-Day War, Israel had captured, among other territories, the Gaza Strip from Egypt and the West Bank from Jordan (including East Jerusalem). Shortly after Israel seized control over Jerusalem, Israel asserted sovereignty over the entire city of Jerusalem and the Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem were given a permanent resident status in Israel. The status of the city as Israel&#x27;s capital and the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip created a new set of contentious issues in the conflict. This meant that Israel controlled the entire former British mandate of Palestine that under the Balfour Declaration was supposed to allow a Jewish state within its borders. Following the Six-Day War, the United Nations Security Council issued a resolution with a clause affirming &quot;the necessity ... for achieving a just settlement of the refugee problem,&quot; referring to the Palestinian refugee problem.

At the end of August 1967, Arab leaders met in Khartoum in response to the war, to discuss the Arab position toward Israel. They reached consensus that there should be no recognition, no peace, and no negotiations with the State of Israel, the so-called &quot;three no&#x27;s&quot;. [56]

Following years of attacks by the Palestinian fedayeen, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was established in 1964. Its goal was the liberation of Palestine through armed struggle. The original PLO Charter stated the desire for a Palestinian state established within the entirety of the borders of the British mandate prior to the 1948 war (i.e. the current boundaries of the State of Israel) and said it is a &quot;national duty ... to purge the Zionist presence from Palestine.&quot; It also called for a right of return and self-determination for Palestinians.

===1967–93===

The defeat of the Arab countries in the Six-Day War prompted fractured Palestinian political and militant groups to give up any remaining hope they had placed in pan-Arabism. In July 1968 armed, non-state actors such as Fatah and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine achieved the majority of the Palestinian National Council votes, and on February 3, 1969, at the Palestinian National Council in Cairo, the leader of the Fatah, Yasser Arafat was elected as the chairman of the PLO. From the start, the organization used armed violence against civilian and military targets in the conflict with Israel. The PLO tried to take over the population of the West Bank, but the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) deported them into Jordan, where they began to act against the Jordanian rule (Palestinians in Jordan comprised about 70% of the total population, which mostly consisted of refugees) and from there attacked Israel numerous times, using the infiltration of terrorists and shooting Katyusha rockets. This led to retaliations from Israel.

In the late 1960s, tensions between Palestinians and the Jordanian government increased greatly. In September 1970 a bloody military struggle was held between Jordan and the Palestinian armed organizations. King Hussein of Jordan was able to quell the Palestinian revolt. During the armed conflict, thousands of people were killed, the vast majority of whom were Palestinians. The fighting continued until July 1971 with the expulsion of the PLO to Lebanon. A large number of Palestinians immigrated to Lebanon after Black September and joined the tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees already there. The center of PLO activity then shifted to Lebanon, where they established bases to stage attacks on Israel and launch an international terror campaign, largely aimed at abducting airplanes. The 1969 Cairo agreement gave the Palestinians autonomy within the south of the country, increasing the Palestinian control of the area. The area controlled by the PLO became known by the international press and locals as &quot;Fatahland&quot;, which created tensions with local Lebanese and contributed to the 1975–1990 Lebanese Civil War.

The PLO took advantage of its control of southern Lebanon in order to launch Katyusha rocket attacks at Galilee villages and execute terror attacks on the northern border. At the beginning of the 1970s the Palestinian terror organizations, headed by the PLO and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine waged an international terror campaign against Israelis, primarily in Europe. In an attempt to publicize the Palestinian cause, frustrated Palestinian guerrilla groups in Lebanon attacked Israeli civilian &#x27;targets&#x27; like schools, buses and apartment blocks, with occasional attacks abroad—for example, at embassies or airports—and with the hijacking of airliners. The peak of the Palestinian terrorism wave against Israelis occurred in 1972 and took form in several acts of terrorism, most prominently the Sabena Flight 572 hijacking, the Lod Airport massacre and the Munich massacre.

On March 15, 1972 King Hussein of Jordan unveiled his plan for a &quot;United Arab Kingdom&quot;, which would have been a federation consisting of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and a federal district in the West Bank which was formerly under Jordan&#x27;s control. According to King Hussein&#x27;s proposal each state would have its own parliament and would be united under one monarch. Hussein conditioned the establishment of the UAK on a treaty between Jordan and Israel in which Israel would concede the control of East Jerusalem to the Jordanian-Palestinian federation so that it would become the capital of the Palestinian Arab federal district. The plan was eventually ruled out after the PLO and other Arab states strongly opposed the plan and after Israel rejected the notion of transferring the control of East Jerusalem to such a federation.

The 1972 also saw increasing Soviet involvement. Defector Ion Mihai Pacepa claimed that the KGB and Securitate organized trainings on covert bombing and plane hijacking for PLO and published propaganda (such as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion) in Arabic language to further fuel the conflict.

The Munich massacre was perpetrated during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. 11 members of the Israeli team were taken hostage by Palestinian terrorists. A botched German rescue attempt led to the death of all 11 Israeli athletes and coaches. Five of the terrorists were shot and three survived unharmed. The three surviving Palestinians were released without charge by the German authorities a month later. The Israeli government responded with an assassination campaign against the organizers and a raid on the PLO headquarters in Lebanon. Other notable events include the hijacking of several civilian airliners, the Savoy Hotel attack, the Zion Square explosive refrigerator and the Coastal Road massacre. During the 1970s and the early 1980s, Israel suffered attacks from PLO bases in Lebanon, such as the Avivim school bus massacre in 1970 and the Ma&#x27;alot massacre in 1974 in which Palestinians attacked a school in Ma&#x27;alot killing twenty-two children.

In 1973 The Syrian and Egyptian armies launched the Yom Kippur War, a well-planned surprise attack against Israel. The Egyptians and Syrians advanced during the first 24–48 hours, after which momentum began to swing in Israel&#x27;s favor. Eventually a Disengagement of Forces agreement was signed between the parties and a ceasefire took effect that ended the war. The Yom Kippur War paved the way for the Camp David Accords in 1978, which set a precedent for future peace negotiations.

In 1974 the PLO adopted the Ten Point Program, which called for the establishment of a national authority &quot;over every part of Palestinian territory that is liberated&quot; with the aim of &quot;completing the liberation of all Palestinian territory&quot;. The program implied that the liberation of Palestine may be partial (at least, at some stage), and though it emphasized armed struggle, it did not exclude other means. This allowed the PLO to engage in diplomatic channels, and provided validation for future compromises made by the Palestinian leadership.

In the mid-1970s many attempts were made by Gush Emunim movement to establish outposts or resettle former Jewish areas in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Initially the Israeli government forcibly disbanded these settlements. However, in the absence of peace talks to determine the future of these and other occupied territories, Israel ceased enforcement of the original ban on settlement, which led to the founding of the first settlements in these regions.
In July 1976, an Air France plane carrying 260 people was hijacked by Palestinian and German terrorists and flown to Uganda. There, the Germans separated the Jewish passengers from the Non-Jewish passengers, releasing the non-Jews. The hijackers threatened to kill the remaining 100-odd Jewish passengers (and the French crew who had refused to leave). Israel responded with a rescue operation in which the kidnapped Jews were freed.

The rise of the Likud party to the government in 1977 led to the establishment of a large number of Israeli settlements in the West Bank.

On March 11, 1978, a force of nearly a dozen armed Palestinian terrorists landed their boats near a major coastal road in Israel. There they hijacked a bus and sprayed gunfire inside and at passing vehicles, killing thirty-seven civilians. In response, the IDF launched Operation Litani three days later, with the goal of taking control of Southern Lebanon up to the Litani River. The IDF achieved this goal, and the PLO withdrew to the north into Beirut. After Israel withdrew from Lebanon, Fatah forces resumed firing rockets into the Galilee region of Israel. During the years following operation Litani, many diplomatic efforts were made which tried to end the war on the Israeli–Lebanese border, including the effort of Philip Habib, the emissary of Ronald Reagan who in the summer of 1981 managed to arrange a lasting cease-fire between Israel and the PLO which lasted about a year.

Israel ended the ceasefire after an assassination attempt on the Israeli Ambassador in Britain, Shlomo Argov, in mid-1982 (which was made by Abu Nidal&#x27;s organization that was ostracized from the PLO). This led Israel to invade Lebanon in the 1982 Lebanon War on June 6, 1982 with the aim to protect the North of Israel from terrorist attacks. IDF invaded Lebanon and even occupied Beirut. To end the siege, the US and European governments brokered an agreement guaranteeing safe passage for Arafat and Fatah—guarded by a multinational force—to exile in Tunis. During the war, Israeli allied Phalangist Christian Arab militias carried out the bloody Sabra and Shatila Massacre in which 700–3,500 unarmed Palestinians were killed by the Phalangist militias while the Israeli troops surrounded the camps with tanks and checkpoints, monitoring entrances and exits. For its involvement in the Lebanese war and its indirect responsibility for the Sabra and Shatila Massacre, Israel was heavily criticized, including from within. An Israeli Commission of Inquiry found that Israeli military personnel, among them defense minister and future prime minister Ariel Sharon, had several times become aware that a massacre was in progress without taking serious steps to stop it, leading to his resignation as Israel&#x27;s Defense Minister. In June 1985, Israel withdrew most of its troops from Lebanon, leaving a residual Israeli force and an Israeli-supported militia in southern Lebanon as a &quot;security zone&quot; and buffer against attacks on its northern territory.

Meanwhile, the PLO led an international diplomatic front against Israel in Tunis. Following the wave of terror attacks including the murder on MS Achille Lauro in October 1985, Israel bombed the PLO commandership in Tunis during Operation Wooden Leg.

According to information obtained from the Israeli Department of Defense, Israel revoked the residency status of more than 100,000 residents of the Gaza Strip and of around 140,000 residents of the West Bank during the 27 years between Israel&#x27;s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967 and the establishment of the Palestinian Authority in 1994. Working in secret, the Israeli government revoked the residency status of Palestinians who studied or lived abroad for longer than a period of time and the revocations have barred nearly a quarter of a million Palestinians and their descendants from returning to Israel/Palestine. Israel is now employing a similar residency right revocation procedure for Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem.

The first Palestinian Intifada (uprising) erupted in December 1987 and lasted until the Madrid Conference of 1991, despite Israeli attempts to suppress it. It was a partially spontaneous uprising, but by January 1988, it was already under the direction from the PLO headquarters in Tunis, which carried out ongoing terrorist attacks targeting Israeli civilians. The riots escalated daily throughout the territories and were especially severe in the Gaza Strip. The Intifada was renowned for its stone-throwing demonstrations by youth against the heavily armed Israeli Defense Forces. Over the course of the First Intifada, a total 1,551 Palestinians and 422 Israelis were killed. In 1987, Ahmed Yassin co-founded Hamas with Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi. Since then, Hamas has been involved in what it calls &quot;armed resistance&quot; against Israel, which includes mainly terrorist acts against Israeli civilian population.

On November 15, 1988, a year after the outbreak of the first intifada, the PLO declared the establishment of the Palestinian state from Algiers, Algeria. The proclaimed &quot;State of Palestine&quot; is not and has never actually been an independent state, as it has never had sovereignty over any territory in history. The declaration is generally interpreted to have recognized Israel within its pre-1967 boundaries, and its right to exist. Following this declaration, the United States and many other countries recognized the PLO.

During the Gulf War in 1990–91, Arafat supported Saddam Hussein&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait and opposed the US-led coalition attack on Iraq. After the Gulf War, Kuwaiti authorities forcibly pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to leave Kuwait. The policy which partly led to this exodus was a response to the alignment of PLO leader Yasser Arafat with Saddam Hussein. Arafat&#x27;s decision also severed relations with Egypt and many of the oil-producing Arab states that supported the US-led coalition. Many in the US also used Arafat&#x27;s position as a reason to disregard his claims to being a partner for peace. After the end of hostilities, many Arab states that backed the coalition cut off funds to the PLO which brought the PLO to the brink of crisis.

In the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War, the coalition&#x27;s victory in the Gulf War opened a new opportunity to advance the peace process. The U.S launched a diplomatic initiative in cooperation with Russia which resulted in the October 1991 Madrid peace conference. The conference was hosted by the government of Spain and co-sponsored by the US and the USSR. The Madrid peace conference was an early attempt by the international community to start a peace process through negotiations involving Israel and the Palestinians, as well as Arab countries including Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. The Palestinian team due to Israeli objections, was initially formally a part of a joint Palestinian-Jordanian delegation and consisted of Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza without open PLO associations.

===1993–2000: Oslo peace process===

In January 1993, Israeli and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) negotiators began secret negotiations in Oslo, Norway. On September 9, 1993, Yasser Arafat sent a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, stating that the PLO officially recognized Israel&#x27;s right to exist and officially renouncing terrorism. On September 13, Arafat and Rabin signed a Declaration of Principles in Washington, D.C., on the basis of the negotiations between Israeli and Palestinian teams in Oslo, Norway. The declaration was a major conceptual breakthrough achieved outside of the Madrid framework, which specifically barred foreign-residing PLO leaders from the negotiation process. After this, a long process of negotiation known as the &quot;Oslo peace process&quot; began. One of the main features of the Oslo Peace Process was the establishment of the autonomous governmental authority, the Palestinian Authority and its associated governing institutions to administer Palestinian communities in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.

In February 1994, Baruch Goldstein, a follower of the Kach party, murdered 29 Palestinians and wounded 125 at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, which became known as the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. In an act of revenge for the massacre, in April 1994, Hamas launched suicide attacks targeting the Israeli civilian population in many locations throughout Israel, and it has since become one of the regular methods Hamas uses to attack Israel.

On September 28, 1995, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat signed an interim agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in Washington. The agreement marked the conclusion of the first stage of negotiations between Israel and the PLO. The agreement allowed the PLO leadership to relocate to the occupied territories and granted autonomy to the Palestinians with talks to follow regarding final status. In return, the Palestinians recognized Israel&#x27;s right to exist and promised to abstain from the use of terror.

Tensions in Israel, arising from the continuation of terrorism and anger at the loss of territory, led to the assassination of Rabin by Yigal Amir, a right-wing Jewish extremist, on November 4, 1995. Upon Rabin&#x27;s assassination, the Israeli prime minister&#x27;s post was filled by Shimon Peres. Peres continued Rabin&#x27;s policies in supporting the peace process.

In 1996, increasing Israeli doubts about the peace process led to Benjamin Netanyahu of the Likud Party winning the election, mainly due to his promise to use a more rigid line in the negotiations with the Palestinian Authority. Netanyahu raised many questions about many central premises of the Oslo process. One of his main points was disagreement with the Oslo premise that the negotiations should proceed in stages, meaning that concessions should be made to Palestinians before any resolution was reached on major issues, such as the status of Jerusalem, and the amending of the Palestinian National Charter. Oslo supporters had claimed that the multi-stage approach would build goodwill among Palestinians and would propel them to seek reconciliation when these major issues were raised in later stages. Netanyahu said that these concessions only gave encouragement to extremist elements, without receiving any tangible gestures in return. He called for tangible gestures of Palestinian goodwill in return for Israeli concessions.
In January 1996, Israel assassinated the chief bombmaker of Hamas, Yahya Ayyash. In reaction to this, Hamas carried out a wave of suicide attacks in Israel. Following these attacks, the Palestinian Authority began to act against the Hamas and oppress their activity.

In January 1997, Netanyahu signed the Hebron Protocol with the Palestinian Authority, resulting in the redeployment of Israeli forces in Hebron and the turnover of civilian authority in much of the area to the Palestinian Authority.

In 1997, after two deadly suicide attacks in Jerusalem by Hamas, Israeli secret agents were sent to Jordan to eliminate the political head of the Department of Hamas, Khaled Mashal, using a special poison. The operation failed and the secret agents were captured. In return for their release Israel sent over the medicine which saved his life and freed a dozen Palestinian prisoners including Sheikh Ahmad Yassin. This release and the increase of the security forces of the Palestinian Authority led to a cease-fire in the suicide attacks until the outbreak of the Second Intifada.

The lack of progress in the peace process led to new negotiations, which produced the Wye River Memorandum, which detailed the steps to be taken by the Israeli government and Palestinian Authority to implement the earlier Interim Agreement of 1995. It was signed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, and on November 17, 1998, Israel&#x27;s 120 member parliament, the Knesset, approved the Wye River Memorandum by a vote of 75–19.
In 1999, Ehud Barak was elected prime minister. Barak continued Rabin&#x27;s policies in supporting the peace process. In 2000, 18 years after Israel occupied Southern Lebanon in the 1982 Lebanon War, the occupation ended as Israel unilaterally withdrew its remaining forces from the &quot;security zone&quot; in southern Lebanon.

As the violence increased with little hope for diplomacy, in July 2000 the Camp David 2000 Summit was held which was aimed at reaching a &quot;final status&quot; agreement. The summit collapsed after Yasser Arafat would not accept a proposal drafted by American and Israeli negotiators. Barak was prepared to offer the entire Gaza Strip, a Palestinian capital in a part of East Jerusalem, 73% of the West Bank (excluding eastern Jerusalem) raising to 90–94% after 10–25 years, and financial reparations for Palestinian refugees for peace. Arafat turned down the offer without making a counter-offer.

===2000–05: Second Intifada===


After the failure of the 2000 Camp David Summit, which was expected to reach a final agreement on the Israeli–Palestinian peace process in July 2000, the Second Intifada, a major Palestinian uprising against Israel, erupted. The outbreaks of violence began in September 2000, after Ariel Sharon, then the Israeli opposition leader, made a provocative visit to the Al-Aqsa compound on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.

After the collapse of Barak&#x27;s government, Ariel Sharon was elected Prime Minister on February 6, 2001. Sharon invited the Israeli Labor Party into the coalition to shore up support for the disengagement plan. Due to the deterioration of the political situation, he refused to continue negotiations with the Palestinian Authority at the Taba Summit, or under any aspect of the Oslo Accords.

At the Beirut Summit in 2002, the Arab League proposed an alternative political plan aimed at ending the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Later on the proposal was formulated as a political plan widely accepted by all Arab states as well as the Arab League. As part of this plan all Arab states would normalize their relations with Israel and bring to an end to the Arab–Israeli conflict in exchange for a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip and West Bank (including East Jerusalem). In addition, the plan required Israel to allow the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and, what the plan describes as a &quot;just solution&quot; for the Palestinian refugees in accordance with UN General Assembly Resolution 194. Israel rejected the wording of the initiative, but official spokespersons expressed gladness about an Arab initiative for peace and Israel&#x27;s normalization in the region.

Following a period of relative restraint on the part of Israel, after a lethal suicide attack in the Park Hotel in Netanya which happened on March 27, 2002, in which 30 Jews were murdered, Sharon ordered Operation Defensive Shield, a large-scale military operation carried out by the Israel Defense Forces between March 29 until May 10, 2002 in Palestinian cities in the West Bank. The operation contributed significantly to the reduction of Palestinian terror attacks in Israel.

As part of the efforts to fight Palestinian terrorism, in June 2002, Israel began construction of the West Bank barrier. After the barrier went up, Palestinian suicide bombings and other attacks across Israel dropped by 90%. However, this barrier became a major issue of contention between the two sides as 85% of the wall is within territory that is Palestinian according to the 1948 Green Line.

Following the severe economic and security situation in Israel, the Likud Party headed by Ariel Sharon won the Israeli elections in January 2003 in an overwhelming victory. The elections led to a temporary truce between Israel and the Palestinians and to the Aquba summit in the May 2003 in which Sharon endorsed the Road map for peace put forth by the United States, European Union, and Russia, which opened a dialogue with Mahmoud Abbas, and announced his commitment to the creation of a Palestinian state in the future. Following the endorsing of the Road Map, the Quartet on the Middle East was established, consisting of representatives from the United States, Russia, EU and UN as an intermediary body of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

On March 19, 2003, Arafat appointed Mahmoud Abbas as the Prime Minister. The rest of Abbas&#x27;s term as prime minister continued to be characterized by numerous conflicts between him and Arafat over the distribution of power between the two. The United States and Israel accused Arafat of constantly undermining Abbas and his government. Continuing violence and Israeli &quot;target killings&quot; of known terrorists forced Abbas to pledge a crackdown in order to uphold the Palestinian Authority&#x27;s side of the Road map for peace. This led to a power struggle with Arafat over control of the Palestinian security services; Arafat refused to release control to Abbas, thus preventing him from using them in a crackdown on militants. Abbas resigned from the post of Prime Minister in October 2003, citing lack of support from Israel and the United States as well as &quot;internal incitement&quot; against his government.

In the end of 2003, Sharon embarked on a course of unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, while maintaining control of its coastline and airspace. Sharon&#x27;s plan has been welcomed by both the Palestinian Authority and Israel&#x27;s left wing as a step towards a final peace settlement. However, it has been greeted with opposition from within his own Likud party and from other right-wing Israelis, on national security, military, and religious grounds. In January 2005, Sharon formed a national unity government that included representatives of Likud, Labor, and Meimad and Degel HaTorah as &quot;out-of-government&quot; supporters without any seats in the government (United Torah Judaism parties usually reject having ministerial offices as a policy). Between August 16 and 30, 2005, Sharon controversially expelled 9,480 Jewish settlers from 21 settlements in Gaza and four settlements in the northern West Bank. The disengagement plan was implemented in September 2005. Following the withdrawal, the Israeli town of Sderot and other Israeli communities near the Gaza strip became subject to constant shelling and mortar bomb attacks from Gaza with only minimal Israeli response.

=== 2005–2019 ===
Following the November 2004 death of long-time Fatah party PLO leader Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat, Fatah member Mahmoud Abbas was elected President of the Palestinian National Authority in January 2005.

In the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections, Hamas won a majority in the Palestinian Legislative Council, prompting the United States and many European countries to cut off all funds to Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, insisting that Hamas must recognize Israel, renounce violence and accept previous peace pacts. Israel refused to negotiate with Hamas, since Hamas never renounced its denial of Israel&#x27;s right to exist. EU countries and the United States threatened an economic boycott if Hamas does not recognize Israel&#x27;s existence, renounce terrorism and support the peace agreements signed between the PLO and Israel in the past. Hamas officials openly stated that the organization does not recognize Israel&#x27;s right to exist, even though the organization expressed openness to hold a long-term truce. Hamas is considered by Israel and 10 other countries to be a terrorist organization and therefore not entitled to participate in formal peace negotiations.
In June 2006, during a well-planned operation, Hamas managed to cross the border from Gaza, attack an Israeli tank, kill two IDF soldiers and kidnap wounded Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit back into the Gaza Strip. Following the incident and in response to numerous rocket firings by Hamas from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, fighting broke out between Hamas and Israel in the Gaza Strip.

In the summer of 2007, a Fatah–Hamas conflict broke out, which eventually led to Hamas taking control of the Gaza Strip, which in practice divided the Palestinian Authority into two. Various forces affiliated with Fatah engaged in combat with Hamas, in numerous gun battles. Most Fatah leaders escaped to Egypt and the West Bank, while some were captured and killed. Fatah remained in control of the West Bank, and President Abbas formed a new governing coalition, which some critics of Fatah said subverts the Palestinian Constitution and excludes the majority government of Hamas.
In November 2007, the Annapolis Conference was held. The conference marked the first time a two-state solution was articulated as the mutually agreed-upon outline for addressing the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The conference ended with the issuing of a joint statement from all parties.

A fragile six-month truce between Hamas and Israel expired on December 19, 2008. Hamas and Israel could not agree on conditions to extend the truce. Hamas blamed Israel for not lifting the Gaza Strip blockade, and for an Israeli raid on a purported tunnel, crossing the border into the Gaza Strip from Israel on November 4, which it held constituted a serious breach of the truce. Israel accuses Hamas of violating the truce citing the frequent rocket and mortar attacks on Israeli cities.
The Israeli operation began with an intense bombardment of the Gaza Strip, targeting Hamas bases, police training camps, police headquarters and offices. Civilian infrastructure, including mosques, houses, medical facilities and schools, were also attacked. Israel has said many of these buildings were used by combatants, and as storage spaces for weapons and rockets. Hamas intensified its rocket and mortar attacks against targets in Israel throughout the conflict, hitting previously untargeted cities such as Beersheba and Ashdod. On January 3, 2009, the Israeli ground invasion began. The operation resulted in the deaths of more than 1,300 Palestinians. The IDF released a report stating that the vast majority of the dead were Hamas militants. The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights reported that 926 of the 1,417 dead had been civilians and non-combatants.

From 2009 onwards, the Obama administration repeatedly pressured the Israeli government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to freeze the growth of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and reignite the peace process between Israel and the Palestinian people. During President Obama&#x27;s Cairo speech on June 4, 2009 in which Obama addressed the Muslim world Obama stated, among other things, that &quot;The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements&quot;. &quot;This construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace. It is time for these settlements to stop.&quot; Following Obama&#x27;s Cairo speech Netanyahu immediately called a special government meeting. On June 14, ten days after Obama&#x27;s Cairo speech, Netanyahu gave a speech at Bar-Ilan University in which he endorsed, for the first time, a &quot;Demilitarized Palestinian State&quot;, after two months of refusing to commit to anything other than a self-ruling autonomy when coming into office. The speech was widely seen as a response to Obama&#x27;s speech. Netanyahu stated that he would accept a Palestinian state if Jerusalem were to remain the united capital of Israel, the Palestinians would have no army, and the Palestinians would give up their demand for a right of return. He also claimed the right for a &quot;natural growth&quot; in the existing Jewish settlements in the West Bank while their permanent status is up to further negotiation. In general, the address represented a complete turnaround for his previously hawkish positions against the Israeli–Palestinian peace process. The overture was quickly rejected by Palestinian leaders such as Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri, who called the speech &quot;racist&quot;.

On November 25, 2009, Israel imposed a 10-month construction freeze on all of its settlements in the West Bank. Israel&#x27;s decision was widely seen as due to pressure from the Obama administration, which urged the sides to seize the opportunity to resume talks. In his announcement Netanyahu called the move &quot;a painful step that will encourage the peace process&quot; and urged the Palestinians to respond. On September 2, United States launched direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority in Washington.

During September 2011 the Palestinian Authority led a diplomatic campaign aimed at getting recognition of the State of Palestine within the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, by the Sixty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly. On September 23 President Mahmoud Abbas submitted a request to recognize the State of Palestine as the 194th UN member to the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The Security Council has yet to vote on it. The decision was labeled by the Israeli government as a unilateral step.
In 2012, the Palestinian Authority applied for admission as a United Nations non-member state, which requires only a majority vote by the United Nations General Assembly. Hamas also backed the motion. The draft resolution was passed on November 29, 2012 by a vote of 138 to 9, with 41 abstentions. Regardless of the UN recognition, as of this writing, no Palestinian state exists except on a symbolic level. Israel indicated that an actual, real-world Palestinian state can only come into existence if Palestinians succeed in negotiating peace with Israel.

On November 14, 2012 Israel began Operation Pillar of Defense in the Gaza Strip with the stated aims being to halt the indiscriminate rocket attacks originating from the Gaza Strip and to disrupt the capabilities of militant organizations. The operation began with the targeted killing of Ahmed Jabari, chief of Hamas military wing. The IDF stated it targeted more than 1,500 military sites in Gaza Strip, including rocket launching pads, smuggling tunnels, command centers, weapons manufacturing, and storage buildings. According to Palestinians sources civilian houses were hit and Gaza Health officials state that 167 Palestinians had been killed in the conflict by November 23. The Palestinian militant groups fired over 1,456 Iranian Fajr-5, Russian Grad rockets, Qassams and mortars into Rishon LeZion, Beersheba, Ashdod, Ashkelon and other population centers; Tel Aviv was hit for the first time since the 1991 Gulf War, and rockets were aimed at Jerusalem. The rockets killed four Israeli civilians—three of them in a direct hit on a home in Kiryat Malachi—two Israeli soldiers, and a number of Palestinian civilians. By November 19, over 252 Israelis were physically injured in rocket attacks. Israel&#x27;s Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted about 421 rockets, another 142 rockets fell on Gaza itself, 875 rockets fell in open areas, and 58 rockets hit urban areas in Israel. A bomb attack against a Tel Aviv bus that wounded over 20 civilians received the &quot;blessing&quot; of Hamas. On November 21 a ceasefire was announced after days of negotiations between Hamas and Israel mediated by Egypt.
In October 2011, a deal was reached between Israel and Hamas, by which the captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit would be released in exchange for 1,027 Palestinians and Arab-Israeli prisoners, 280 of whom had been sentenced to life in prison for planning and perpetrating various terror attacks against Israeli targets. The military Hamas leader Ahmed Jabari was quoted later as confirming that the prisoners released as part of the deal were collectively responsible for the killing of 569 Israeli civilians.

In 2014, another war between Israel and Gaza occurred resulting in over 70 Israeli casualties and over 2000 Palestinians casualties.

===2020s===
In 2021, another war between Israel and Gaza occurred resulting in over 250 casualties. As the war went on, violent conflict was ignited within Israel as well. Policy analysts believe that the war decreased the chances of Israeli-Palestinian bilateral talks.

In November 2022, with the election of the 37th government of Israel, a coalition government led by Benjamin Netanyahu and notable for its inclusion of far-right politicians, violence in the conflict has increased, with a rise in military actions such as the July 2023 Jenin incursion and Palestinian political violence producing the highest death toll in the conflict since 2005.

On October 7, 2023, the Israel–Hamas war began when Hamas launched a large-scale attack on Israel, during which Hamas initially fired at least 2,200 rockets at Israel from the Gaza Strip. Simultaneously, hundreds of Palestinian militants breached the border, entering Israel on foot and with motor vehicles. They engaged in gun battles with Israeli security forces, killed Israeli civilians and took over Israeli towns and military bases. The attack resulted in more than 1,139 Israelis and foreign nationals killed, including 766 civilians and 373 security forces; an additional 253 Israelis and foreign nationals were kidnapped to Gaza. Following the initial onslaught, Israeli forces cleared Hamas militants from southern Israel before launching extensive airstrikes on the Gaza Strip followed by a large-scale ground invasion, leading to more than 40,000 Palestinian casualties and a humanitarian crisis.

<text>Faddey Faddeyevich Bellingshausen or Fabian Gottlieb Benjamin von Bellingshausen ( – ) was a Russian cartographer, explorer, and naval officer of Baltic German descent, who attained the rank of admiral. He participated in the first Russian circumnavigation of the globe, and subsequently became a leader of another circumnavigation expedition that discovered the continent of Antarctica. Like Otto von Kotzebue and Adam Johann von Krusenstern, Bellingshausen belonged to a cohort of prominent Baltic German navigators which helped Russia launch its naval expeditions.

Bellingshausen was born on the Estonian island of Saaremaa (Ösel), to the . He started his service in the Russian Baltic Fleet, and after distinguishing himself joined the first Russian circumnavigation of the Earth in 1803–1806, serving on the merchant ship &quot;Nadezhda&quot; under the captaincy of Adam Johann von Krusenstern. After the journey, he published a collection of maps of the newly explored areas and islands of the Pacific Ocean. Subsequently, he commanded several ships of the Baltic and Black Sea Fleets.

As a prominent cartographer, Bellingshausen was appointed to command the Russian circumnavigation of the globe in 1819–1821, intended to explore the Southern Ocean and to find land in the proximity of the South Pole. Mikhail Lazarev prepared the expedition and was made Bellingshausen&#x27;s second-in-command and the captain of the sloop &quot;Mirny&quot;, while Bellingshausen himself commanded the sloop &quot;Vostok&quot;. During this expedition, Bellingshausen and Lazarev became the first explorers to see the land of Antarctica on 27 January 1820 (New Style), disproving James Cook&#x27;s contention that it was impossible to find land in the southern ice-fields. They circumnavigated the continent twice and never lost each other from view. The expedition discovered and named Peter I, Zavodovski, Leskov, Alexander, and Visokoi Islands, the Antarctic Peninsula, and made other discoveries in the tropical waters of the Pacific.

Made on his return, Bellingshausen participated in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829. Promoted to vice admiral, he again served in the Baltic Fleet in the 1830s. From 1839, he was a military governor of Kronstadt, and gained the rank of admiral in 1843. In 1831, he published the book on his Antarctic travels, called &quot;Double Investigation of the Southern Polar Ocean and the Voyage Around the World&quot;. 

==Early life and career==

Bellingshausen was born into the Baltic German noble Bellingshausen family in the , Ösel County in the Governorate of Livonia of the Russian Empire; now Saare County, Estonia. His paternal family had Holsteinish origins; the surname Bellingshausen was first recorded in Lübeck. He enlisted as a cadet in the Imperial Russian Navy at the age of ten. After graduating from the Kronstadt naval academy at age eighteen, Bellingshausen rapidly rose to the rank of captain.

==First Russian circumnavigation==
A great admirer of Cook&#x27;s voyages, Bellingshausen served from 1803 in the first Russian circumnavigation of the Earth. He was one of the officers of the vessel &quot;Nadezhda&quot; (&quot;Hope&quot;), commanded by Adam Johann von Krusenstern. The mission was completed in 1806. After the journey, Bellingshausen published a collection of maps of the newly explored areas and islands of the Pacific Ocean.

==Service as captain==

Bellingshausen&#x27;s career continued with the command of various ships in the Baltic and Black Seas. From 1812 to 1816, he commanded the frigate &quot;Minerva&quot; and from 1817 to 1819 the frigate &quot;Flora&quot;, both in the Black Sea Fleet. During 1812 he met on Macquarie Island, half-way between New Zealand and Antarctica, Richard Siddins, the Australian captain of the ship &quot;Campbell Macquarie&quot;.

==First Russian Antarctic expedition==

When Emperor Alexander I authorized an expedition to the south polar region in 1819, the authorities selected Bellingshausen to lead it as an experienced captain and explorer, and a prominent cartographer. The expedition was intended to explore the Southern Ocean and to find land in the proximity of the South Pole. The preparation work on the two ships, the 985-ton sloop-of-war &quot;Vostok&quot; (&quot;East&quot;) and the 530-ton support vessel &quot;Mirny&quot; (&quot;Peaceful&quot;) was carried out by Mikhail Lazarev, who had captained his own circumnavigation of the globe before. Bellingshausen became the captain of &quot;Vostok&quot;, and Lazarev captained &quot;Mirny&quot;. The journey started from Kronstadt on 4 June 1819. They stopped briefly in England, where Bellingshausen met with Sir Joseph Banks, the president of the Royal Society. Banks had sailed with Captain James Cook fifty years earlier and supplied the Russians with books and charts for their expedition.

Leaving Portsmouth on 5 September 1819 the expedition crossed the Antarctic Circle (the first to do so since Cook) on 26 January 1820 (New Style). On 27 January, the expedition discovered the Antarctic mainland approaching the Antarctic coast at a point with coordinates 69º21&#x27;28&quot;S 2º14&#x27;50&quot;W and seeing ice-fields there. The point in question lies within twenty miles of the Antarctic mainland. Bellingshausen&#x27;s diary, his report to the Russian Naval Minister on 21 July 1821 and other documents, available in the Russian State Museum of the Arctic and Antarctic in Saint Petersburg, Russia, were carefully compared with the log-books of other claimants by the British polar historian A. G. E. Jones in his 1982 study &quot;Antarctica Observed&quot;. Jones concluded that Bellingshausen, rather than the Royal Navy&#x27;s Edward Bransfield on 30 January 1820 or the American Nathaniel Palmer on 17 November 1820, was indeed the discoverer of the sought-after Terra Australis.

During the voyage Bellingshausen also visited Meretoto / Ship Cove in New Zealand, the South Shetland Islands, and discovered and named Peter I, Zavodovski, Leskov and Visokoi Islands, and a peninsula of the Antarctic mainland that he named the Alexander Coast, but that has more recently borne the designation of Alexander Island.
Bellingshausen and Lazarev managed to twice circumnavigate the continent and never lost each other from view. Thus, they disproved Cook&#x27;s assertion that it was impossible to find land in the southern ice fields. The expedition also made discoveries and observations in the tropical waters of the Pacific Ocean.

==Admiral==

Returning to Kronstadt on 4 August 1821, Bellingshausen was made , and received the rank of counter admiral from tsar Nicholas I in 1826. He fought in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829, — particularly in the siege of Varna, was promoted to vice admiral in 1830, served as a military governor of port Kronstadt at the approaches to St Petersburg, and gained the rank of admiral in 1843. In 1831, he published the book on his Antarctic travel, called &quot;Double Investigation of the Southern Polar Ocean and the Voyage Around the World&quot;.

==Military governor of Kronstadt==
In 1839 he became a military governor of Kronstadt, the main base of Russian Baltic Fleet, and died there in 1852.
==Legacy==
Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen is remembered in Russia as one of its greatest admirals and explorers. In the Antarctic, multiple geographical features and locations, named in honor of Bellingshausen, remind of his role in exploration of the southern polar region.

<doc id="562601" wikidata="Q1156048" url="?curid=562601" title="Gonzalo de Berceo">
<text>Gonzalo de Berceo ( 1197 – before 1264) was a Spanish poet born in the Riojan village of Berceo, close to the major Benedictine monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla. He is celebrated for his poems on religious subjects, written in a style of verse which has been called Mester de Clerecía, shared with more secular productions such as the &quot;Libro de Alexandre&quot;, the &quot;Libro de Apolonio&quot;. Berceo wrote in the Old Riojan dialect.

Gonzalo is recorded as being a deacon in his home parish in the early 1220s, and as a priest from 1237 on. It has been surmised that he may have studied in the nascent university of Palencia, and may have served in the curia of the bishop of Calahorra.

He wrote devotional and theological works. The devotional may be divided into two sub-sections: the Marian (the long &quot;Milagros de Nuestra Señora&quot; (Miracles of Our Lady - perhaps influenced by Gautier de Coincy), the &quot;Duelo de la Virgen&quot; (the Mourning of the Virgin, a dialogue between the Blessed Virgin Mary and Saint Bernard of Clairvaux) and &quot;Loores de la Virgen&quot; (the Praises of the Virgin, which is a type of salvation history); and the hagiographical (the &quot;Vida de San Millán de la Cogolla&quot;, &quot;Vida de Santo Domingo de Silos&quot; and the &quot;Vida de Santa Oria&quot;: the lives of Aemilian of la Cogolla, Dominic of Silos, and Aurea (Oria)). These three saints have a strong regional attachment: Aemilian, a Visigothic saint, was patron of the nearby monastery; Dominic, 11th century abbot of Silos and one of the most important saints in thirteenth-century Iberia, was born in the town of Cañas, near to Berceo; and Aurea was an anchoress who lived in the monastery of San Millán during the late eleventh century. He also wrote the fragmentary &quot;Martirio de San Lorenzo&quot; (the Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence, a Roman martyr of the third century), which may be connected to a shrine of Saint Lawrence supposedly built by Aemilian himself, at the top of the mountain below which the monastery of San Millán is situated.
The theological works are the &quot;Del sacrificio de la misa&quot; (On the Sacrifice of the Mass), a verse-compendium of the significance of the priest&#x27;s actions during the eucharist; and &quot;Los signos del juicio final&quot; (the Signs of the Last Judgement), a description of the prodigies that will be witnessed before the return of Christ to judge the living and the dead.

His proximity to San Millán and his composition of hagiographies which seem to support the monastery&#x27;s interests, have led him to be considered a propagandist for the narrow interests of the monastery of San Millán. This view has been propounded above all by Professor Brian Dutton, editor of Gonzalo de Berceo&#x27;s collected works, although some critics (notably Fernando Baños and Isabel Uría Maqua) have taken a view which presents the poet as less motivated by his concerns for the monastery; others (particularly Gregory Andrachuk) have linked him to the Lateran reforms.

==Biography==
Hoerni was born on September 26, 1924, in Geneva, Switzerland. He received his B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Geneva and two Ph.D.s in physics; one from the University of Geneva and the other from the University of Cambridge.

In 1952, he moved to the United States to work at the California Institute of Technology, where he became acquainted with William Shockley, a physicist at Bell Labs who was intimately involved with the creation of the transistor.

A few years later, Shockley recruited Hoerni to work with him at the newly founded Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory division of Beckman Instruments in Mountain View, California. But Shockley&#x27;s strange behavior compelled the so-called &quot;traitorous eight&quot; (Hoerni, Julius Blank, Victor Grinich, Eugene Kleiner, Jay Last, Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce and Sheldon Roberts) to leave his laboratory and create the Fairchild Semiconductor corporation.

In 1955 Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derrick discovered and patented surface passivation by silicon dioxide. Frosch and Derrick were able to manufacture the first silicon dioxide field effect transistors, the first transistors in which drain and source were adjacent at the surface. At Shockley Semiconductor, Shockley had circulated the preprint of their article in December 1956 to all his senior staff, including Jean Hoerni. Later, Hoerni attended a meeting where Atalla presented a paper about passivation based on the previous results at Bell Labs.

The planar process was invented by Jean Hoerni, with his first patent filed in May 1959, while working at Fairchild Semiconductor. The planar process was critical in the invention of Silicon Integrated circuit by Robert Noyce. Noyce built on Hoerni&#x27;s work with his conception of an integrated circuit, which added a layer of metal to the top of Hoerni&#x27;s basic structure to connect different components, such as transistors, capacitors, or resistors, located on the same piece of silicon. The planar process provided a powerful way of implementing an integrated circuit that was superior to earlier conceptions of the device. With Noyce, Jack Kilby from Texas Instruments is usually credited with the invention of the integrated circuit, but Kilby&#x27;s IC was based on germanium. As it turns out, Silicon ICs have numerous advantages over germanium. The name &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; refers to this silicon.

Along with the &quot;traitorous eight&quot; alumni Jay Last and Sheldon Roberts, Hoerni founded Amelco (known now as Teledyne) in 1961.

In 1964, he founded Union Carbide Electronics, and in 1967, he founded Intersil, where he became a pioneer of low-voltage CMOS-Integrated Circuits.

He was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal from the Franklin Institute in 1969 and the McDowell Award in 1972.

Hoerni died of myelofibrosis on January 12, 1997, in Seattle, Washington. He was 72.

==Personal life==
He was married to Anne Marie Hoerni and had three children: Annie Blackwell, Susan Killham, and Michael Hoerni. He had one brother, Marc Hoerni. His second marriage to Ruth Carmona also ended in divorce. Hoerni married Jennifer Wilson in 1993.

== Philanthropy ==
An avid mountain climber, Hoerni often visited the Karakoram Mountains in Pakistan and was moved by the poverty of the Balti mountain people who lived there. He contributed the lion&#x27;s share, $30,000, to Greg Mortenson&#x27;s project to build a school in the remote village of Korphe, and later founded the Central Asia Institute with an endowment of $1 million to continue providing services for them after his death. Hoerni named Greg Mortenson as the first Executive Director of the organization, which continues to build schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

In December 2007, an article was published by Michael Riordan on Hoerni and his planar process in &quot;IEEE Spectrum&quot;. The author claimed that Jay Last pointed out that Hoerni had incredible stamina and could hike for hours on little food or water.
