<text>Onjo (?–28, reigned c. 18 BC – AD 28) was the founding monarch of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. According to the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, he founded the royal family of Baekje.

== Background ==
There are a few theories and legends of Onjo&#x27;s parentage. One is that he was the third son of King Dongmyeong (Jumong), the founder of the northern Korean kingdom Goguryeo. He was the younger brother of Yuri, who became Goguryeo&#x27;s second king, and younger brother of Biryu who built small state in Michuhol.

The second theory is that he is the son of Wutae, his mother&#x27;s first husband. A third legend says that his older brother Biryu was his mother&#x27;s son with Wutae but Onjo was born after the second marriage with King Dongmyeong.

== Founding and expansion of Baekje ==
Dongmyeong had three sons: Yuri, Biryu, and Onjo. When Yuri, born from Dongmyeong&#x27;s previous wife in Dongbuyeo, came to Goguryeo and became the heir to the throne, Biryu and Onjo moved south to found their own kingdoms. According to the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, Biryu founded his kingdom in Michuhol (), but his didn&#x27;t last long. Biryu&#x27;s people joined Sipje after Biryu&#x27;s death and Onjo renamed it to Baekje. After that, the capital city of Baekje was moved southward from Habuk Wiryeseong because the Malgal were located at the North and Nangnang was located to the East. Both capital cities correspond to land within current Seoul. In 13 BC and 8 BC, the Malgal tribes attacked from the north, and both times, Onjo directly led his armies and won victories over the invaders. In 5 BC, Onjo moved the capital city to a more defensible location south of the Han River, renaming it Hanam Wiryeseong, and sent a messenger to the king of the Mahan confederacy telling him of the recent action.

At this time, Onjo already had plans of conquering Mahan and Jinhan. By 7 AD, he was already preparing his armies for war and finally attacked during 8 AD. In 8 AD, he secretly took his armies across the border, laying the deceit that he was going to hunt in the forests. Soon, all of Mahan except for two fortresses were conquered. The citizens of the last two Mahan fortresses surrendered to Onjo and were given mercy. The Mahan King, however, committed suicide and left a letter for Onjo, asking him to take in Mahan&#x27;s people with kindness and mercy. Onjo respected the Mahan King&#x27;s last request and took his people in.

However, according to a recent study, Baekje conquered Mahan&#x27;s Mokji after the mid-3rd century. In fact, it is presumed to be an article written for the founder about the events of later generations.

Baekje had expanded greatly, and several fortresses were being built every year. Peace lasted for 8 years until 16 AD, when a former Mahan general caused a rebellion. Onjo directly led an army of 5,000 and successfully destroyed the rebellion. Soon after this, the Malgal tribes invaded again during 22 AD, but were once again defeated by Onjo and his army.

== Death and succession ==
Onjo died of natural causes in 28 AD, during the 46th year of his reign. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Daru. Onjo laid the foundations for a powerful dynasty that would last for 678 years and 31 rulers.

==Samguk sagi==

&quot;The first ancestor of the Baekje [kings] was King Onjo. His father was Chumo, also known as Jumong. From Bukbuyeo he escaped peril and arrived in Jolbon Buyeo. The king of Buyeo was without a male child, and only had three daughters. Upon seeing Jumong, they knew he was not an ordinary man, and made his second daughter [Jumong&#x27;s] wife. Shortly thereafter, the king of Buyeo died. Jumong succeeded him to the throne and had two children. The oldest was called Biryu, and the next was called Onjo (it is also said that Jumong went to Jolbon and married a woman from Wolgun, and that he had two sons [by her]). Now Jumong, when he was in Bukbuyeo, had one son, who came and became the crown prince. Biryu and Onjo were afraid that they would not be treated well by the one who had become crown prince, and so with Ogan, Mayeo, and some other ten ministers went south with a large number of commoners following them. Then they reached Mt. Hansan and climbed themselves to the summit to look upon the land where they were. Biryu wanted to settle on the beach, and the ten ministers admonished him, saying &quot;But the land to the south of the river: in the north it is bordered by the Han river, and the East occupied by high mountain peaks; the south faces marshland, and the west is guarded by the sea. This benefits of this divinely strategic land possess a fate not easily acquired. Why should you not make your capital in this place? However Biryu did not listen, and divided the people, and he reverted to Michuhol and settled there. Onjo made his capital south of the river in Wiryeseong, and the ten ministers assisted him, and the country was called Sipje. This happened in the third year of Hongjia, during the reign of Emperor Cheng of the Early Han. Biryu was in Michu, where the earth was wet and the rivers salty, and could not dwell in security. Then he returned to look upon Wirye, where the capital and its villages were stable as a three-legged cauldron, and the people dwelt in security. Then he was ashamed and died. His ministers and people all returned to Wirye. Afterwards in the times that came the people were happy and obedient, and the name [of the kingdom] was changed to Baekje. Its lineage and that of Kogyureo are both out of Buyeo, therefore they took the surname Buyeo.
One version says, the first ancestor was King Biryu, and that his father was Utae, an illegitimate grandson of the king of Bukbuyeo Hae Buru. His mother was Soseono, a daughter of Yeon Ta-bal (延陀勃), a man of Jolbon. She was married to Utae and gave birth to two sons. The oldest was called Biryu, and the younger called Onjo. Utae died and she was widowed, and settled in Jolbon. After some time Jumong was not well-treated in Buyeo – this was during the second year of Jianzhao in early Han [during the reign of Emperor Yuan]. In spring of the second month, he fled south to Jolbon and established the capital of Goguryeo. He married Soseono and she became his consort, and because she, in the creation of his realm, rendered great assistance, Jumong especially favored them and received Biryu and the other as if they were his own sons. When Jumong was in Buyeo he had a child Yuryu by a woman of the Ye clan, and when he came he was made crown prince and the one who would succeed him. Therefore, Biryu asked his younger brother Onjo, saying &quot;Originally the great king fled the difficulties in Buyeo and escaped here. Our mother&#x27;s clan poured out the riches of their house to aid in the endeavor [of creating the kingdom], and her toils were many. Now the great king has left this world, and the state has fallen to Yuryu, and if we were to follow along here it would be as depressing as a tumor. Would it not be respectful to our mother&#x27;s clan if we went to the south and divined the land, and established a separate capital?&quot; Then he and his brother many factions, and crossed the Pae and Dae rivers, and arrived in Michuhol and settled there.
The Pei Shih and Book of Sui both tell that one descendant of Dongmyeong was Gutae who was sincere in his benevolence. When he first established his country in the territory of the former commandery of Daifang, the prefect of the Han territory of Liaodong, Gongsun Du, had his daughter marry [Gutae]. Afterwards [his country] became a powerful state among the Eastern Barbarians.
It is unknown which is true [of these accounts].&quot;
* 18 BC, spring, fifth month. The court of King Dongmyeong was established.
* 17 BC, spring, first month. The king asked the myriad ministers, saying, &quot;The Mohe assemble on my northern border, and these people are fierce and have many tricks.

Over 500 were killed or captured. Autumn, seventh month. The fort of Masuseong was constructed, and a palisade was erected at Mt. Byeongsan. The prefect of Lelang sent a messenger to report: &quot;Recently you inquired about connecting in good favor, with the intention of making us like the same family. But now at the boundary of our territory you have built a fortress and a palisade. Is this some scheme to munch away [our territory] like a silkworm? If there is no change in our former good relations, then destroy the fort and tear down the palisade, and accordingly we will feel no more doubt. However, if you do not approve, then we request a battle to decide winner and loser.
Then the king said, &quot;Doing construction at strategic points and protecting the country has been the usual way of things from the past up to now. How dare you change our peaceful relations because of this. You should not have any doubts about this matter! If you presume to lead out a force because of this, then accordingly our tiny country will await you.&quot; Therefore, peaceful relations with Lelang were lost.

Days of peace are few, and now there are incidents of strange omens that are seen again and again. Also, the country&#x27;s mother has passed, and things will not settle down on their own. It is necessary to move the country. Earlier I went took a look at the land south of the Han river where the soil is fertile and suitable for our capital. There we can plan to have long-lasting stability.&quot; Autumn, seventh month. At the foot of Mt. Chwihan a palisade was built, and they relocated the households of Wiryeseong. Eighth month.

The king of Mahan sent envoys to reproach him, saying &quot;When the king first crossed the river and had no place set foot, I ceded him 100 ri of land in the northeast in peace. This reception of the king was not ungenerous, and should be thought of and mutually returned. Now in your country your people have completely assembled, and you say that we are not enemies. However, you construct fortresses and moats, and invade our borders. Is this righteousness?&quot; The king was ashamed and destroyed the palisade.
* 6 AD, spring, second month. The waters of the well in the palace overflowed violently. In the house of a man in Hanseong a horse gave birth to a cow with one head and two bodies. A fortune-teller said, &quot;The well water overflowed, and this is an omen of prosperity for the great king. The cow with one head and two bodies means the great king should annex the neighboring countries. The king heard this and was pleased. Afterwards he had the intention to swallow up Chin[han] and Ma[han].
* 7 AD, autumn, seventh month. The king said, &quot;Mahan is gradually weakening, and the hearts of the upper and lower classes are moving apart. This condition cannot continue for long.

Regret [over not acting] would not make up for it, and so we should act first and take it, and thereby avoid later troubles. Winter, tenth month.

<doc id="566280" wikidata="Q1928913" url="?curid=566280" title="Video Cassette Recording">
<text>Video Cassette Recording (VCR) is an early domestic analog recording format designed by Philips. It was the first successful consumer-level home videocassette recorder (VCR) system. Later variants included the VCR-LP and Super Video (SVR) formats.

The VCR format was introduced in 1972, just after the Sony U-matic format in 1971. Although at first glance the two might appear to have been competing formats, they were aimed at very different markets. After failing as a consumer format, U-matic was marketed as a professional television production format, whilst VCR was targeted particularly at educational but also domestic users. Unlike some other early formats such as Cartrivision, the VCR format does record a high-quality video signal without resorting to Skip field.

Home video systems had previously been available, but they were open-reel systems (such as the Sony CV-2000) and were expensive to both buy and operate. They were also unreliable and often only recorded in black and white such as the EIAJ-1. The VCR system was easy to use and recorded in colour but was still expensive: when it was introduced in 1972 the N1500 recorder cost nearly £600 (). By comparison, a small car (the Morris Mini) could be purchased for just over £600.
The VCR format used large square cassettes with 2 co-axial reels, one on top of the other, containing chrome dioxide magnetic tape. Three playing times were available: 30, 45 and 60 minutes. The 60-minute videocassettes proved very unreliable, suffering numerous snags and breakages due to the very thin video tape. Tapes of 45 minutes or less contained thickness tape. The mechanically complicated recorders themselves also proved somewhat unreliable. One particularly common failing occurred should tape slack develop within the cassette; the tape from the top (takeup) spool may droop into the path of the bottom (supply) spool and become entangled in it if rewind was selected. The cassette would then completely jam and require dismantling to clear the problem, and the tape would then be creased and damaged.

The system predated the development of the slant azimuth technique to prevent crosstalk between adjacent video tracks, so it had to use an unrecorded guard band between tracks. This required the system to run at a tape speed of . was the speed of the long play variant.

The Philips VCR system brought together many advances in video recording technology to produce the first truly practical home video cassette system. The very first Philips N1500 model included all the essential elements of a domestic video cassette recorder:
* Simple loading of cassette and simple operation using &quot;Piano Key&quot; controls, with full auto-stop at tape ends.
* A tuner for recording off-air television programmes.
* A clock with timer for unattended recordings.
* A modulator to allow connection to a normal (for the time) television receiver without audio and video input connectors.

The Philips VCR system was marketed only in the UK, mainland Europe, Australia and South Africa. In mid-1977, Philips announced they were considering distribution of the format in North America, and it was test marketed for several months. Because the format was initially designed only for use with the 625-line PAL system, VCR units had to be modified in order to work with the NTSC system. Unfortunately, for mechanical and electronic reasons, the tape speed had to be increased by 20%, which resulted in a 60-minute PAL tape running for 50 minutes in a NTSC machine. DuPont announced a thinner videotape formulation that would allow a 60-minute NTSC VCR tape (and roughly 70 minutes in PAL), but the tape was even less reliable than previous formulations. Ultimately, Philips abandoned any hope of trying to sell their VCR format in North America, partly because of the reliability issues, and partly because of the introduction of VHS that same year.

==Variants==
VCR later evolved into a related format known as VCR-LP. This exploited slant azimuth to greatly increase the recording time. Although both formats used identical VCR cassettes, the recordings were incompatible between the two systems, and few if any dual-format recorders existed. Philips N1700, released in 1977, supported the VCR-LP format.

A later even longer-playing variant, Super Video (SVR) was manufactured by Grundig exclusively. SVR was designed to exclusively use BASF- and Agfa-manufactured chrome-dioxide tape in cassettes that were identical to the earlier Philips ones, with the exception of a small actuator added to the bottom of the cassette. This meant that only the BASF/Agfa tapes would work in SVR machines, but that such tapes could also be used in the older VCR and VCR-LP machines. Just as VCR-LP recordings are incompatible with VCR, so SVR recordings are incompatible with both VCR and VCR-LP. The only model to be built was the Grundig SVR4004, with a few detail variations such as optional audio/video connectors, plus a rebadged ITT 240.

== Cassette playing times ==
This chart provides an overview of playing times (in minutes) for the most common cassettes released for standard VCR, VCR-LP and SVR.

VC cassettes were originally developed for standard VCR. LVC cassettes were developed for VCR-LP, but are physically identical to VC cassettes. SVC cassettes were specifically developed for SVR.
*) LVC 180 was not recommended for use in a standard VCR machine due to a thin tape base.

**) VC and LVC cassettes do not work in a SVR machine. However, SVC cassettes may be used in VCR and VCR-LP machines.

==Models==

=== N1500 (1972) ===
The first Philips machine was model number N1500, after which the format is also known. This had &quot;first generation&quot; mechanics including magnetic braking servo systems applied to relatively large mains voltage induction motors. The outer edge of the cabinet was wooden. The power cable was detachable, but used an obscure connector for which replacements are not readily available.
The N1520 was a N1500 without TV tuner and timer, but with editing functions assemble and insert (using four video heads), 2 track linear audio (not stereo but independent mono channels) and direct AV in/out connections.

===N1460 (Released 1973)===
Often found in schools and colleges where a few master VCR recorders made off-air recordings and the cheaper N1460s were used for playback. In Poland, a slightly modified version was made under the name Unitra magnetowid kasetowy MTV-20.

===N1501 (Released 1974)===

AC Mains present all over the place inside: mains motors, mains clock etc. Slightly improved colour circuitry compared to the original N1500, also modified field blanking to reduce flyback interference on some televisions. Cosmetic variations on the N1500, with black replacing the silver frontage and black plastic surround rather than wood.

===N1502 (Released 1976)===
The later model N1502 had a totally different mechanism using DC motors and more advanced electronics, and was somewhat more reliable. A later version again was still called N1502 but had further significant mechanical and electronic advances, and in particular had a worm drive for operation of the loading mechanism rather than a fragile plastic gearbox assembly. Earlier machines had a hardwired mains cable, later ones were fitted with a standard &quot;Figure-8&quot; C7 power socket.

===N1512 (Released 1976)===
The N1512 model offered composite video input and output connectors, but was otherwise the same as the N1502. The VCR-LP model N1700 was closely related to the later N1502 variant. Other, rarer Philips models included stereo sound and editing capabilities.

Circuitry and internal layout was much more modular than the first generation Philips VCRs. Used quiet DC motors (First generation VCRs used hefty synchronous AC mains motors). Basically this model was the same as the Philips N1502 with an extra board for video in / out. Channel button 8 selected video in.

===N1700 (Released 1977)===
Superficially similar to the Philips N1502 both externally and internally. Some components were interchangeable between the two models. Slower tape-speed and a slant-azimuth recording technique (to almost eliminate cross-talk between video tracks without using tape-wasting guard-bands) made possible the longer playing time without a noticeable loss in picture quality. The mains lead was hard-wired into the machine; however later releases of the N1700 had a removable lead - this would become standard on the N1702 model. Also on later models, presumably as the company had already started production of the N1702, the internal Video Head is also sometimes labelled as N1702 instead of N1700. The price in the UK was around £700 which would be over £5,500 in 2023. A Skantic branded clone model VCR 1209281 had the silver top design of the later N1702 model.

Denis Norden promoted this model in the industrial video &quot;The Philips Time Machine&quot;.

===N1702 (Released 1979)===
Similar to the Philips model N1700, the N1702 had a lighter coloured top cover (N1702 was silver and black whilst the N1700 was grey). A 4-digit counter, a 9-day timer, separate mains lead (not hardwired in), and a test-pattern generator to aid TV tuning. Tape transport legends in slightly different position on later N1702&#x27;s.

===Grundig models===
Grundig built a VCR4000 VCR-LP model which had microprocessor control and so treated the tapes more gently than the purely mechanical decks, and the SVR4004 (longer running SVR format) model was very similar. Other Grundig models included the VCR3000 (believed to be VCR format) and VCR5000AV (believed to be the only dual format VCR and VCR-LP machine).

==Replacement==
In the late 1970s, the VCR formats were superseded altogether by Video 2000 (also known as &#x27;Video Compact Cassette&#x27; or VCC). Due to the similar initialisms, and the fact that both were designed by Philips, the &#x27;VCC&#x27; and &#x27;VCR&#x27; formats are often confused. However, the two systems are incompatible, and there are significant differences between them. Some Video 2000 machines carry a modified version of the (such as had appeared on the N1500 and N1700 machines), adding further to this confusion.

<text>Marc-André Fleury (; born November 28, 1984) is a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender for the Minnesota Wild of the National Hockey League (NHL). Drafted out of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) first overall by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft, Fleury played major junior for four seasons with the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles, earning both the Mike Bossy Trophy as the league&#x27;s top prospect and the Telus Cup as the top defensive player in 2003. He joined the Penguins in 2003–04 and during his 13 seasons with the team won Stanley Cup championships in 2009, 2016, and 2017. He received the William M. Jennings Trophy and the Vezina Trophy in 2021. He is the third goaltender to ever reach the 500 victories mark in the NHL, after Patrick Roy and Martin Brodeur, and the fourth goaltender to reach 1,000 games played, after Roy, Brodeur, and Roberto Luongo.

Internationally, Fleury has represented Canada twice as a junior, winning back-to-back silver medals at the World Junior Championships in 2003 and 2004. He won a gold medal with Team Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Fleury is known by the nickname &quot;Flower&quot;, derived from the English translation of his last name (&quot;fleuri&quot; means &quot;in bloom&quot;, or &quot;in flower&quot;, in French).

Following the retirement of Craig Anderson in 2023, Fleury is the last active goaltender to have played in the NHL before the 2004–05 lockout, and one of two active players overall (alongside Brent Burns).

==Playing career==

As a youth, Fleury played in the 1998 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the College-Français Rive-Sud minor ice hockey team from South Shore, Montreal.

Fleury played junior ice hockey in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League for the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles, beginning in 2000–01. After a strong 2002–03 campaign that included a silver medal with Team Canada at the World Junior Championships and QMJHL Second Team All-Star honours, he was chosen first overall in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft by the Pittsburgh Penguins. The Penguins acquired the first overall pick from the Florida Panthers in a trade that sent the first and 73rd overall picks to the Penguins in exchange for Mikael Samuelsson and the third and 55th picks. He is only the third goalie to be chosen first overall in the NHL draft, after Michel Plasse and Rick DiPietro. Playing four seasons total with Cape Breton, Fleury&#x27;s jersey number 29 was later retired by the club in his fourth NHL season on January 25, 2008.

===Pittsburgh Penguins (2003–2017)===
Fleury immediately made his NHL debut in 2003–04 as the youngest goaltender in the league at 18 years old (three years younger than the second-youngest, Rick DiPietro of the New York Islanders). He appeared in his first NHL game on October 10, 2003, against the Los Angeles Kings, recording an impressive 46-save performance, which included a penalty shot save, in a 3–0 loss. Fleury recorded his first NHL win in his very next start, on October 18, with 31 saves in a 4–3 win over the Detroit Red Wings. His first NHL shutout came on October 30, in a 1–0 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks. Fleury shared time with goaltenders Jean-Sébastien Aubin and Sébastien Caron and lived up to first-overall-pick expectations early, earning Rookie of the Month honours in October with a 2–2–2 record, 1.96 goals against average (GAA) and .943 save percentage. As the season progressed, however, his performance began to sink, mainly due to Pittsburgh&#x27;s poor defence. The team regularly gave up over 30 shots per game, and rarely managed to become an offensive threat. He was loaned to Team Canada for the 2004 World Junior Championships in December and, upon returning with a second consecutive silver medal, he was sent back to the QMJHL on January 29, 2004. In light of financial difficulties for the franchise, it is believed Fleury&#x27;s $3 million contract bonus, which he would have potentially received if he stayed and met several performance goals, was a factor in the decision to return him to Cape Breton. To no avail, Fleury offered to forfeit his bonus to remain with the club. Fleury finished the QMJHL season with Cape Breton in a first round elimination and was subsequently assigned to Pittsburgh&#x27;s American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, and appeared in two postseason games.
As NHL play was postponed due to the labour dispute, Fleury continued to play with Wilkes-Barre/Scranton in 2004–05, where he posted a 26–19–4 record, a 2.52 GAA and a .901 save percentage. When NHL play resumed in 2005–06, Fleury started the season once more in the minors, but was quickly called up by Pittsburgh for a game against the Buffalo Sabres on October 10 to replace an injured Jocelyn Thibault. He continued to play between Wilkes-Barre/Scranton and Pittsburgh until November 28, after which he remained with Pittsburgh. With the Penguins finishing last in the Eastern Conference and allowing a league-worst 316 goals, Fleury recorded a 3.25 GAA and a .898 save percentage. Competing for time with Sébastien Caron and Jocelyn Thibault, Fleury emerged as the Penguins&#x27; starting goalie.

Despite playing behind a shaky defense, Fleury was able to impress the team management with his technique and performance and signed a two-year contract extension worth $2.59 million in the off-season. In the proceeding campaign, Fleury&#x27;s stats improved significantly. Playing behind a better Penguins team, which featured rising superstars Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin, he recorded five shutouts and a 2.83 GAA. He earned his 40th win in a 2–1 victory over the New York Rangers in the season finale, joining Tom Barrasso as the only Penguins goaltenders to record 40 wins in a season. He also broke Johan Hedberg&#x27;s single season franchise record for most games and minutes played. Fleury made his NHL playoff debut against the Ottawa Senators, the eventual Stanley Cup finalists, in the first round and recorded his first playoff win in Game 2, recording 34 saves in a 4–3 win at Scotiabank Place.

Fleury started the 2007–08 season slowly, then won four straight games before suffering a high-ankle sprain against the Calgary Flames on December 6. He returned as a starter on March 2, after a brief conditioning stint in the AHL with Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. While sidelined, he decided to change the colour of his goaltending equipment from the bright yellow that had become his signature to plain white, to gain an optical advantage over shooters. He was also influenced and challenged by the very strong play of Ty Conklin, who took the team&#x27;s starting job after being promoted from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton in Fleury&#x27;s absence. Upon his return from injury, Fleury helped the Penguins win the Atlantic Division, going 10–2–1 with a 1.45 GAA en route to a 12–2 playoff run to the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals against the Detroit Red Wings. In Game 5 of the Finals at Detroit, he stopped 55 of 58 shots in a triple overtime win for the Penguins to stave off elimination. The Penguins lost the series in six games. Fleury&#x27;s attempt to cover an unseen loose puck by sitting on it in Game 6 resulted in him propelling the puck into the net; the own goal turned out to be the Stanley Cup-winner, credited to Henrik Zetterberg. At the start of the following season, he said: Fleury completed the playoffs with three shutouts – a new team record for one playoff season – and a 14–6 record. His .933 save percentage was also tops in the playoffs. In the off-season, Fleury signed a seven-year, US$35 million contract with the Penguins, on July 3. It included a no-movement clause, and a limited no-trade clause that triggered in the 2010–11 season.
Fleury compiled a 35–18–7 record in 2008–09 to help the Penguins to a fourth-place finish in the Eastern Conference, entering the 2009 playoffs as the defending Prince of Wales champions. Fleury was a major factor in the first round against the Penguins&#x27; intrastate rivals the Philadelphia Flyers. In Game 2 at home, with a 2–1 deficit late in the third, Fleury made a key toe save against Flyers top goal scorer Jeff Carter which was eventually pivotal as the Penguins tied the game late in the 3rd and won late in overtime. After the Flyers won Game 3 comfortably, Fleury once again stole a game for the Penguins in Game 4, stopping 43 shots to keep a surging Flyers line-up at bay and ensure a 3–1 lead. The Flyers won in Pittsburgh in Game 5, but Fleury saved another performance for the final period of Game 6. After initially letting in 3 goals, Fleury did not allow another as the Penguins rallied from a 3–0 deficit to win 5–3. The Penguins went the full distance in the second round against the Washington Capitals. In the deciding game seven, Fleury made a key breakaway glove save early in the contest against Capitals superstar Alexander Ovechkin, helping the Penguins eliminate Washington by a 6–2 score. Fleury and the Penguins then swept the Carolina Hurricanes in the Conference Finals to return to the Stanley Cup Finals against the Detroit Red Wings for the second consecutive year. After being pulled in game five after allowing five goals, Fleury made another momentous breakaway save in game six, this time with 1:39 minutes left in regulation against Dan Cleary to preserve a 2–1 lead and help the Penguins force a game seven. Playing the series-deciding game in Detroit, Fleury played an integral role in the Penguins 2–1 victory to capture the franchise&#x27;s third Stanley Cup, making two critical saves in the final seconds. After stopping an initial Henrik Zetterberg shot from the right faceoff circle, the rebound came loose to Nicklas Lidström at the left faceoff circle, forcing Fleury to make a diving stop with 1.5 seconds remaining to preserve the win and the Stanley Cup.

Fleury recorded a 37–21–6 record during the 2009–10 season, as the defending Stanley Cup champions Pittsburgh again finished fourth in the Eastern Conference. After dispatching Ottawa in six games, the Penguins were upset by the eighth-seeded Montreal Canadiens in round two, ending their chance of a Stanley Cup repeat, with game 7 marked the last game at the Mellon Arena. Fleury recorded a 2.78 goals against average during the Playoffs.
With Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin sidelined with injuries for much of the 2010–11 season, Fleury and the Penguins&#x27; defence were relied on to carry the team to the playoffs. Fleury finished with a 36–20–5 record, and the Penguins finished fourth in the Eastern Conference. The Penguins squared off against the Tampa Bay Lightning in the first round of the playoffs, where they were defeated in seven games despite taking a 3–1 series lead early. Fleury posted a .899 save percentage in the series.

Backup goalies Brent Johnson and Brad Thiessen struggled through much of the 2011–12 season, leaving Fleury as the only viable goaltending option. Fleury played 67 games in the season, starting 23 consecutive games at one point leading up to the All-Star break, and finished the season with 42 wins, second only to the Nashville Predators&#x27; Pekka Rinne. Despite the impressive regular season campaign, Fleury had a less-than-impressive playoff run, being eliminated by the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round and posting a .834 save percentage and 4.63 goals against average, as the Flyers advanced in six games.

Fleury returned to the net after the lockout season with a vengeance, putting some of the best marks of his career in the shortened season. He finished with a record of 23–8, tying him for fourth in the league, while his save percentage and goals against average continued to place him in the top half of starting goaltenders. His playoff troubles continued, however; after posting a shutout in his playoff game, he was less than impressive in following starts, leaving backup Tomáš Vokoun to start for the remainder of the 2013 playoffs. The Penguins promising 2012–13 season ended abruptly with a 4–0 loss to the Boston Bruins in the Eastern Conference Finals. After the season, however, Penguins officials confirmed that Fleury remained the team&#x27;s starting goaltender.
Fleury&#x27;s performance during the regular season during 2013–14 was similar to his performance the year before. He finished with a record of 39–18–5 and posted a save percentage of .915 and a goals against average of 2.37. Despite a marked improvement in his playoff performance over the prior year, the Penguins lost in the second round to the New York Rangers despite taking an early 3–1 lead in the series.

On November 5, 2014, the Penguins signed Fleury to a four-year extension with an average annual value of $5.75 million. On November 18, 2014, he earned his first shutout against the Montreal Canadiens, making 27 saves for a league-leading fourth shutout of the season, with a final score of 4–0. On November 24, 2014, Fleury recorded his 300th NHL win, becoming the third-youngest and third-fastest player to reach the milestone. On April 11, Fleury recorded his league leading tenth shutout in a 2–0 victory against the Buffalo Sabres to secure the last wild card spot in the East.

In the 2015–16 season, the team struggled through the first half, resulting in the firing of head coach Mike Johnston and the hiring of new coach Mike Sullivan. Fleury played a great second half of the season before suffering a season ending concussion. He finished the season with an impressive 35 wins in 58 games played. The team made a final push with up-and-comer Matt Murray in goal and qualified for the playoffs.
Despite the Penguins qualifying for the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs, Fleury was unable to play due to post-concussion syndrome until Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Final against the Tampa Bay Lightning where he subbed in for Murray at the start of the third period. Fleury then started Game 5, which the Penguins lost 4–3 in overtime. Fleury was then benched in favour of Murray. The Penguins would go on to win the Stanley Cup with Murray in goal, defeating the San Jose Sharks in six games.
In the 2016–17 season Fleury played 38 games and accumulated 18 wins. When Matt Murray was injured during warm-ups of Game 1 of the playoffs versus the Columbus Blue Jackets, Fleury took the starting position and led the Penguins to a 3–1 win. Fleury continued to lead the Penguins through the series, and his 49 saves on 51 shots in Game 5 helped the Penguins win the series against the Blue Jackets 4–1. With Murray out, Fleury continued to be the starter for the Penguins through the second round versus the back-to-back Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning Washington Capitals. The Penguins defeated the Capitals for the second consecutive time, this time in seven games, with Fleury shutting them out in Game 7, and advanced to face the Ottawa Senators in the Eastern Conference Finals. Following a 5–1 loss in Game 3, the Penguins opted to go with a healthy Murray, who remained the team&#x27;s starter en route to a Stanley Cup championship victory, defeating the Nashville Predators in six games. The win was the third Stanley Cup of Fleury&#x27;s career.

===Vegas Golden Knights (2017–2021)===
On June 21, 2017, with the emergence of Matt Murray, Fleury willingly waived his no trade and no movement clauses to be left exposed by the Penguins for the 2017 NHL Expansion Draft, where he was subsequently selected by the Vegas Golden Knights. Pittsburgh also traded their second round pick in the 2020 Entry Draft as an incentive for Vegas to select Fleury, in order for the team to be relieved of his nearly $6 million cap hit. He stopped 45 of 46 shots in the Golden Knights&#x27; first NHL game, a 2–1 victory over the Dallas Stars. On October 15, 2017, Fleury was placed on Long Term Injury Reserve (LTIR) after taking a knee to the head from Anthony Mantha of the Detroit Red Wings on October 13. He was activated off LTIR on December 10, 2017, after missing 25 games. Fleury was chosen to represent Las Vegas during the 2018 NHL All-Star Game. During the NHL All-Star Weekend, he won the inaugural Save Streak competition where he saved 14 consecutive shootout attempts. On March 12, 2018, against the Philadelphia Flyers, Fleury earned his 400th career win with a final score of 3–2.

Fleury started for the Knights during the first round of the 2018 playoffs. On April 17, 2018, the Golden Knights were able to secure a 4–0 record over the Los Angeles Kings to sweep the first round. On May 6, after Fleury posted a shutout, the Golden Knights were able to move on to the Western Conference finals by beating the San Jose Sharks in Game 6 of their playoff series. On May 20, 2018, Fleury led the Golden Knights to a victory over the Winnipeg Jets in the Western Conference Finals, which allowed Fleury to earn a shot at a fourth Stanley Cup. 
During the playoffs a Vegas casino created a chocolate sculpture showing him doing a butterfly. Fleury was in goal for each game of the Knights&#x27; five game loss to the Washington Capitals in the 2018 Stanley Cup Finals.

In the 2018 off-season, Fleury re-signed with the Knights on a three-year, $21 million contract. Nearly halfway through the 2018–19 season, Fleury played 45 games and led the NHL in wins (27) and shutouts (6). Because of his stellar play, he was again selected to represent the Golden Knights in the 2019 NHL All-Star Game for the second straight year. In Game 7 of Las Vegas&#x27;s first round playoff series against the San Jose Sharks, Fleury and the Golden Knights gave up four goals in four minutes after a controversial 5-minute major penalty was assessed to the Golden Knights because of teammate Cody Eakin cross-checking Sharks&#x27; forward Joe Pavelski. The Golden Knights ultimately lost Game 7 and the series to the Sharks.

With Vegas unable to find a stable backup, Fleury was frequently overplayed during the 2019–20 season, posting a 2.77 goals against average and .905 save percentage. Vegas would eventually trade for Robin Lehner during the season, allowing Fleury to share the net as a tandem with Lehner. Fleury played sparingly during the 2020 playoffs, largely serving as Lehner&#x27;s backup as the Golden Knights returned to the conference finals, losing to the Dallas Stars in five games.

The pandemic-shortened 2020–21 season saw Fleury have a bounce back from a mediocre 2019–20 campaign. At the age of 36, Fleury recorded a career-best 1.98 goals against average and a .928 save percentage, helping the Golden Knights to their third final four appearance in four seasons. In Game 3 of the semifinals against the Montreal Canadiens, Fleury misplayed the puck behind his net, coughing up the puck to Josh Anderson, who tied the game with 1:55 left in regulation time and later scored the overtime winner to give the Canadiens a 2–1 series lead. As a result, Lehner started in net for the Golden Knights in Game 4, which they won in overtime to even the series at 2. Fleury returned in Game 5, but the Golden Knights lost 4–1 and the Canadiens took a 3–2 series lead, so Lehner played in Game 6 which the Canadiens won in overtime to eliminate the Golden Knights and advance to the 2021 Stanley Cup Finals. At the end of the season, Fleury was named to the Second All-Star Team, and awarded his first Vezina Trophy and first William M. Jennings Trophy.

===Chicago Blackhawks (2021–2022)===
On July 27, 2021, with the Golden Knights in need of salary cap space, Fleury was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for minor league forward Mikael Hakkarainen, making Fleury the first goaltender since Dominik Hašek to be traded as the defending Vezina Trophy winner. According to both Fleury and his agent Allan Walsh, Fleury was not notified by the Golden Knights about the trade, and the two learned about it on Twitter. After being traded, Fleury reportedly contemplated retirement. However, on August 1, Fleury announced that he intended to play for the Blackhawks in the 2021–22 season.

After the team began the season with a historically poor 0–7–2 start that would ultimately lead to the firing of coach Jeremy Colliton, Fleury recorded his first win as a Blackhawk on November 1, 2021, in a 5–1 win against the Ottawa Senators. On December 9, Fleury reached his 500th win in a shutout against the Montreal Canadiens, becoming the third goaltender in NHL history to reach the mark (after Patrick Roy and Martin Brodeur). On January 8, 2022, Fleury became the first goaltender in NHL history to beat all 32 teams in a win against the Vegas Golden Knights.

With the Blackhawks struggling and pivoting into a team rebuild, the possibility of trading Fleury became a subject of intense speculation in the leadup to the 2022 trade deadline, given his elite reputation and the impending expiration of his contract. Any such trade was complicated by a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement that former Blackhawks general manager Stan Bowman had made with Fleury in convincing him not to retire, wherein he would not be traded without his consent. New general manager Kyle Davidson stated that he intended to honour that arrangement. For his part, Fleury said &quot;If I move, I would love a chance to win. That&#x27;s what I play for, and that&#x27;s what I love. But it&#x27;s still a big &#x27;if&#x27; at this point.&quot;

===Minnesota Wild (2022–present)===
On March 21, 2022, Fleury was traded to the Minnesota Wild in exchange for a conditional 2022 second-round pick, which would become a first-round pick if the Wild reached the 2022 Western Conference Final with Fleury winning four games in the process. Bill Guerin, the general manager of the Wild, was formerly a teammate of Fleury&#x27;s on the Penguins. Fleury made his debut with the Wild in a March 26 game against the Columbus Blue Jackets, backstopping them to a 3–2 overtime victory. After the game a fan threw a bouquet of flowers on the ice. Fleury stated that was the first time that has ever happened.

Fleury recorded a 9–2–0 record with a .910 save percentage in 11 regular season games with the Wild. The team&#x27;s other goaltender, Cam Talbot, had gone 8–0–3 with a .925 save percentage since Fleury&#x27;s arrival, as a result of which there was debate as to who the team would choose to start the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs against the St. Louis Blues. Ultimately, the nod was given to Fleury. With Fleury in net the Wild initially took a 2–1 series lead, before losing the fourth and fifth games to face elimination in Game 6. Fleury was replaced by Talbot, but the Wild were eliminated by the Blues 4 games to 2.

On July 7, 2022, Fleury opted to forgo free agency and signed a two-year, $7 million contract extension to remain with the Wild. The Wild&#x27;s decision to extend Fleury caused conflict with Talbot, who was subsequently traded to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Filip Gustavsson. On October 30, Fleury earned his 62nd shootout win and became the leader in NHL career shootout wins when the Wild defeated the Blackhawks. Gustavsson would outperform Fleury for much of the middle of the season, leading to some speculation as to who would serve as the team&#x27;s starter. Fleury himself acknowledged his difficulties, assessing that he &quot;been in my head probably too much.&quot; His play improved as the Wild headed into March, embarking on a lengthy points streak.
On December 31, 2023, Fleury played his 1,000th NHL game, becoming just the fourth goaltender to reach the mark. On January 15, 2024, Fleury became the second-winningest goaltender in NHL history after earning his 552nd win in the Wild&#x27;s 5–0 victory against the New York Islanders.

On April 9, 2024, the Wild were eliminated from playoff contention, ending Fleury&#x27;s 17-year playoff streak, as he had last missed the playoffs with Pittsburgh in 2006. On April 17, he signed a 1-year, $2.5 million extension with the Wild. He has stated that he will retire at the end of the 2024–25 season.

==International play==




Fleury won two silver medals with Team Canada at the IIHF World Junior Championships. He made his first appearance in 2003 in Halifax. Although Canada was defeated by Russia 3–2 in the gold medal game, Fleury posted a 1.57 GAA and was named the Top Goaltender and tournament MVP.

Although Fleury was playing in the NHL the next year leading up to the tournament, the Pittsburgh Penguins lent him to Team Canada. Fleury expressed a desire to remain with his NHL club, but Penguins management decided the high-profile tournament would be good for his development. He led Team Canada to the gold medal game for the second consecutive year, but made a costly mistake that lost his team the championship. With the game tied 3–3 with less than five minutes remaining in regulation, Fleury left his net to play the puck and avert a breakaway opportunity for Patrick O&#x27;Sullivan of Team USA. Fleury&#x27;s clearing attempt, however, hit his own defenceman, Braydon Coburn, and trickled into the net. This proved to be the difference, as the Americans held on for a 4–3 win.

On December 30, 2009, Fleury was named to Team Canada for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. He did not play in the tournament, however, as the goaltending duties were split between Martin Brodeur and Roberto Luongo, but still received a gold medal as Canada defeated the United States 3–2 in the final.

==Personal life==

Fleury was born to André and France Fleury in Sorel-Tracy, Quebec, a town near Montreal. He has one sibling, his younger sister Marylène.

When he was first drafted, he lived with Mario Lemieux for a brief period of time as he searched for more permanent living arrangements.

Fleury married his longtime girlfriend Véronique Larosee in 2012, and the couple have two daughters and a son. She is of Abenaki and Mi&#x27;kmaq descent. In November 2023 the NHL forbade Fleury from wearing a custom mask he had had made in honor of his wife&#x27;s native heritage on his team&#x27;s Native American Heritage Night. In spite of the threat of fines for himself and the team, he wore the helmet during warm-ups, though he did not start the game.

Fleury is known by the nickname &quot;Flower&quot;, derived from the English translation of his last name (&quot;fleuri&quot; is &quot;in bloom&quot;, or &quot;in flower&quot;, in French). His goaltender masks always feature a fleur-de-lis on the backplate (in addition to the initials EFGT, honouring his four grandparents &quot;&quot;), and have frequently featured some sort of flower on the front artwork as well.

<doc id="566291" wikidata="Q707646" url="?curid=566291" title="Rick DiPietro">
<text>Richard W. DiPietro Jr. (born September 19, 1981) is an American former professional ice hockey goaltender and current co-host of ESPN 98.7 FM New York&#x27;s &quot;DiPietro and Rothenberg&quot; with Dave Rothenberg. He is also an analyst on National Hockey League (NHL) telecasts on ESPN having started the 2021–22 season.

On June 24, 2000, DiPietro became the second goaltender in history selected first overall in an NHL Entry Draft when he was chosen by the New York Islanders. In 2006, the team signed him to a groundbreaking 15-year, $67.5 million contract, but a string of injuries beginning in 2008, which limited him to 50 NHL appearances over the next five seasons, led to a contract buyout on July 2, 2013, with eight years remaining on his contract. DiPietro retired after being released by the Charlotte Checkers of the American Hockey League (AHL) on November 26, 2013, with whom he had signed a tryout contract on October 25. Multiple hockey writers consider him to be a draft bust. As a result of his contract buyout, the Islanders will continue to pay DiPietro $1.5 million annually until the end of the 2028–29 season.

==Playing career==
Born in Lewiston, Maine, Rick DiPietro moved to Winthrop, Massachusetts when he was 10. As a youth, he played in the 1994 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Beverly, Massachusetts.

===Collegiate===
DiPietro attended Saint Sebastian&#x27;s School. He played one season (1999–2000) with Boston University in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)&#x27;s Hockey East. In that one year, DiPietro was named to the All-Rookie Team, named Second Team All-Hockey East, awarded the team&#x27;s co-MVP and was named Hockey East&#x27;s Rookie of the Year. In addition, DiPietro nearly set the NCAA record for most saves in a game when he stopped 77 out of 80 shots in a 3–2 quadruple overtime loss to St. Lawrence University during the NCAA regional final. In his one and only Beanpot Tournament, DiPietro was named MVP and won the Eberly Trophy awarded to the tournament&#x27;s top goaltender.

===Professional===

DiPietro was drafted first overall by the New York Islanders in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft, out of Boston University. Islanders general manager Mike Milbury traded incumbent goalie Roberto Luongo to create room for the highly touted DiPietro, who was known for his mobility and puckhandling skills. DiPietro became the fourth American to occupy the top draft position in the NHL Entry Draft.

A groin injury during training camp resulted in DiPietro starting the season with the Bridgeport Sound Tigers, the Islanders minor league affiliate in the American Hockey League (AHL). He was subsequently called up twice to join the Islanders, but did not play a game until January 27, 2001, when he debuted against the Buffalo Sabres. DiPietro&#x27;s NHL debut was widely anticipated, but in 20 games in the 2000–01 season he managed just three wins against 15 losses for a struggling Islanders team. He played ten games the next season, as well as one playoff game, before being called up permanently in the 2003–04 season. His goals against average (GAA) improved from 3.49 in the 2000–01 season to 2.36 in the 2003–04 season.

On September 12, 2006, DiPietro signed a 15-year, $67.5 million contract with the Islanders, topping former teammate Alexei Yashin&#x27;s contract signed before the start of the 2001–02 season of 10 years. &quot;Newsday&quot; reported that the team offered him a 15-year contract in September 2005, but the NHL front office discouraged the Islanders from making such an offer. Instead, DiPietro had signed on a one-year deal with the Islanders.

DiPietro&#x27;s contract, the longest under the 2005 NHL collective bargaining agreement, was nearly surpassed during the 2010 off-season, when the New Jersey Devils attempted to sign Ilya Kovalchuk to a 17-year contract, but that offer was rejected by the NHL on the grounds of salary cap circumvention.

On March 5, 2007, DiPietro broke an Islanders franchise record by making 56 saves in a 2–1 shootout loss to the New York Rangers. The previous record was 55 saves, held by both Félix Potvin and Billy Smith. The record was later broken by Dwayne Roloson in 2009.

On March 13, 2007, DiPietro suffered a concussion after a collision with Montreal Canadiens forward Steve Bégin, when DiPietro raced out to poke check a puck at the blueline at 15:41 of the first period. DiPietro returned for four games but then missed the rest of the regular season after he sustained another concussion in a game against the Rangers. He returned to play games two through five of the Islanders&#x27; first round playoff series against the Buffalo Sabres.

The concussion was the start of a string of injuries. DiPietro underwent surgery in the 2007 off season to fix a torn labrum in his hip.

In 2007, DiPietro expressed a desire to become more of a team leader. He said, &quot;I&#x27;m a competitive person, and I have a tendency to have a short fuse with guys sometimes. That&#x27;s something, as a leader, that you just can&#x27;t do.&quot;

On November 19, 2007, DiPietro recorded his 100th NHL career win when the Islanders beat the New York Rangers 2–1.

DiPietro was selected to appear in his first and only All-Star Game in 2008 as a reserve, but was later named the starter after New Jersey Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur dropped out. During the skills competition the night before, DiPietro injured his hip during the shootout competition. DiPietro continued to play until the Islanders no longer had a chance to make the playoffs and on March 19, it was announced that DiPietro would miss the remainder of the 2007–08 season because of the hip surgery.

On June 3, 2008, DiPietro went on a Sirius satellite radio show being hosted by &quot;Bubba the Love Sponge,&quot; where he told Bubba he would be undergoing knee surgery later that day. The surgery was done on the meniscus in his left knee. DiPietro sat out the first four games of the 2008–09 season (or, controversially, was on the bench as the backup) before starting the team&#x27;s fifth game in Florida. He played two games after that, but left after the first period his third game back. After that, he was placed on injured reserve for an &quot;undisclosed lower body injury.&quot; On November 1, it was announced DiPietro had undergone another knee surgery after injuring his meniscus. It is unknown whether it is the same knee that was operated on earlier that year. DiPietro returned to the team on December 26, 2008. He won his first game back and earned an assist, which broke Billy Smith&#x27;s team record for points by a goaltender. On January 20, 2009, Islanders general manager Garth Snow announced that DiPietro would miss the rest of the 2008–09 season due to post-arthroscopic surgical swelling in his right knee.

On January 8, 2010, DiPietro returned from injury in a 4–3 loss to the Dallas Stars. His last start of 2010 came against the Carolina Hurricanes on February 6. He earned his fifth loss in seven starts, as the Islanders fell 3–1. On February 13, he was listed as day-to-day with the flu, and less than a month later, swelling in his left-knee caused him to be placed on the injured reserve list effective March 2, 2010; he did not return for the rest of the season.

DiPietro started the 2010–11 season apparently healthy and worked in a &quot;platoon&quot; tandem with Dwayne Roloson. On December 21, 2010, he was placed on injured reserve, however, due to knee swelling. He returned in December, though due to the strong play of Roloson, he was primarily used as a backup. He made his first start since returning on December 29 in a game against the Pittsburgh Penguins. DiPietro and the Islanders defeated Pittsburgh in a 2–1 shootout decision behind the sharp play of DiPietro. On December 31, the Islanders traded Roloson to the Tampa Bay Lightning, confirming the starting job for DiPietro. On February 2, 2011, In his first game against the Penguins since his shootout win, DiPietro engaged in a rare &quot;goaltender fight&quot; against Pittsburgh&#x27;s Brent Johnson in the final seconds of the game. He suffered a concussion and was knocked out and had his jaw broken by a single punch to the face by Johnson. The injuries kept him off the ice for weeks. It is not known if the knee swelling was from the fight or another reason. DiPietro returned shortly to finish the season, wearing the old helmet and cage combo worn by former Islanders goaltender Chris Osgood.

The start of the 2011–12 season featured DiPietro in a three-way tandem with Al Montoya and Evgeni Nabokov. Due to a strong pre-season and his performances in DiPietro&#x27;s absence the previous year, Montoya started the first two games and DiPietro was the backup. During practice for the Islanders&#x27; third game, DiPietro took a hard shot to his mask from Brian Rolston, which concussed him and sidelined him indefinitely. DiPietro returned to action in late October, returning to the more conventional one piece goaltender mask he sported for the majority of his career. On November 5, 2011, DiPietro made 25 saves to earn his first win of the 2011–12 season. Shortly after, he injured his groin and was again out indefinitely; he later required surgery to repair a hernia in the area, sidelining him for the remainder of the season.

After playing only three games in the lockout shortened 2012–13 season, DiPietro was waived by the Islanders and was sent to their AHL affiliate, the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. He had eight years remaining on his NHL contract. DiPietro started his first game as a member of the Sound Tigers on March 1, 2013. He allowed two goals on the first two shots of the game and five in the first period. He did not return from the locker room for the second period of play as the game eventually ended 7–3 in favor of the opposing Connecticut Whale.

DiPietro&#x27;s series of injuries during the latter part of his NHL career earned him the nickname &quot;Rickety&quot;.

On July 1, 2013, the Islanders announced that DiPietro would be placed on unconditional waivers and have the remainder of his contract bought out on a compliance. The buyout was completed 2 days later with DiPietro agreeing to be paid 2/3s of the $36 million he would have been owed over the next 8 years at a rate of $1.5 million per year over the next 16 years. DiPietro signed a professional tryout contract on October 25, 2013, with the Carolina Hurricanes&#x27; AHL affiliate, Charlotte Checkers, playing his first game 5 days later in which he stopped 25 of 29 shots in a 5–2 loss to the Grand Rapids Griffins. He was cut by the Checkers on November 26.

==Post-playing career==
After retiring DiPietro turned to radio broadcasting. He is a co-host of &quot;DiPietro and Rothenberg&quot; with Dave Rothenberg from 6–10 AM each weekday morning on WEPN-FM (98.7 ESPN NY).

In 2019, DiPietro was named the Head Boys&#x27; Hockey Coach at the Portledge School. He was officially announced as an analyst on National Hockey League (NHL) telecasts on ESPN beginning with the upcoming season on June 29, 2021.

==International play==
DiPietro made his international debut at the junior level for the United States at the 1999 IIHF World U18 Championships. He would then play in the two following World Junior Championships in 2000 and 2001, awarded in the former as the tournament&#x27;s best goaltender and selected to the All-Star Team.

He made his full international debut soon after his WJC experience with the United States at the 2001 World Championships. He would go on to compete for Team USA in the 2004 World Cup of Hockey and the 2005 World Championships.

Along with former Islanders teammates Jason Blake and Mark Parrish, DiPietro was named to the United States national hockey team at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, in February 2006. DiPietro was the U.S.&#x27; number one goaltender for the tournament, starting four of the team&#x27;s six games. DiPietro played well, sporting a 2.28 GAA, but went 1–3 in the men&#x27;s tournament.

<text>The Ndwandwe–Zulu War of 1817–1819 was a war fought between the expanding Zulu Kingdom and the Ndwandwe tribe in South Africa. 

The Zulus were originally a tiny tribe that had migrated to the eastern plateau of present-day South Africa; they became a strong tribal nation largely due to the efforts of an ambitious chieftain named Shaka (c. 1787–1828, reigned 1816–1828). A rebellious young man, Shaka was estranged from his father, who was a Zulu chief named Senzangakhona, and became a warrior with the Mthethwa people. The Mthethwa paramount chieftain Dingiswayo helped Shaka become recognized as head of the Zulus after Senzangakhona died in 1816. The two chieftains were close friends, and their warriors fought together against common enemies, such as the Ndwandwe headed by King Zwide. After Dingiswayo was captured and executed by Zwide, the Mthethwa people placed themselves under Shaka and took the Zulu name. Shaka revolutionized traditional ways of fighting by introducing the iklwa, a short stabbing spear, as a weapon and by organizing warriors into disciplined units that fought in close formation behind large cowhide shields.

The Ndwandwe and the Zulus met in combat at the Battle of Mhlatuze River in 1819. By this time the Ndwandwe had adopted Zulu battle tactics and weapons so Shaka wore the invaders down with guerrilla tactics before launching his major attack when the Ndwandwe army was divided during the crossing of the Mhlatuze River. Zulu warriors arrived at Zwide&#x27;s headquarters near present-day Nongoma before news of the defeat, and approached the camp singing Ndwandwe victory songs to gain entry. Zwide himself escaped with a handful of followers, and most of the Ndwandwe abandoned their lands and migrated north establishing Zulu-like (named Ngoni after the ethno-linguistic name &quot;Nguni&quot;) kingdoms in Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania. This was the final phase of the Mfecane, a catastrophic, bloody civil war and eventual migration of many different tribes in the area, initially (ca. 1802) caused by famine but ultimately as a result of escaping from the Zulus. The Ngoni groups caused their own havoc by using Zulu tactics in war. They established stronger political units in other countries and thus posed a threat to European colonisation, for example during the Maji-Maji Rebellion in German East Africa (1905–1907). Shaka was the ultimate victor, and his people still live today throughout Zululand, with customs and a way of life that can be easily traced to Shaka&#x27;s day.

<doc id="566294" wikidata="Q992943" url="?curid=566294" title="Eurystomus">
<text>Eurystomus is a genus of roller, one of the two genera in that family of birds.
The name means ‘broad mouth’, from the Greek &quot;eurus&quot; (, ‘broad, wide’) and &quot;stoma&quot; (, ‘mouth’).

&quot;Eurystomus&quot; contains four broad-billed species, which breed in Africa, Asia and Australasia. Two species are restricted to Africa, one of which, the broad-billed roller, is migratory. The oriental dollarbird has a large distribution ranging from India to Japan and Australia and it too, is migratory over the northern and southern extremes of its range. The final species, the azure dollarbird, is endemic to the Moluccas in Indonesia. In general they are open country foragers, occurring in woodland, savanna and farmland. The azure dollarbird and the broad-billed roller are both associated with rainforests but nevertheless require open areas in which to forage.

The species of the genus &quot;Eurystomus&quot; vary from the other genus of rollers, &quot;Coracias&quot;, in having proportionally longer wings and shorter legs. These morphological differences are reflected in differences of foraging techniques. &quot;Coracias&quot; rollers forage from a fixed perch and take prey by swooping down onto it on the ground, while the faster and more agile &quot;Eurystomus&quot; rollers catch their prey on the wing. Unlike the species of the genus &quot;Coracias&quot;, they do not perform the &quot;rolling&quot; display which gives the family its common name.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Eurystomus&quot; was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot to accommodate the Oriental dollarbird. The name is from Classical Greek &quot;eurustomos&quot; meaning &quot;wide-mouthed&quot;.

A molecular phylogenetic study by Ulf Johansson and collaborators published in 2018 found that the azure dollarbird (&quot;Eurystomus azureus&quot;) was nested in a clade containing subspecies of the Oriental dollarbird (&quot;Eurystomus orientalis&quot;).

<text>Mombasa Island is a coral outcrop located on Kenya&#x27;s coast on the Indian Ocean, which is connected to the mainland by a causeway. Part of the city of Mombasa is located on the island, including the Old Town.

==History==
The old town of Mombasa is located at the eastern, seaward end of the island. Kilindini and Port Reitz, the modern deepwater harbour and port separates the island from the Kenyan mainland to the south. The old harbour, which is named Port Tudor and guarded by Fort Jesus, and Tudor Creek separate the island from the northern mainland. Modern residential sprawl and industrial areas now occupy the rest of the island.

Mombasa is linked to the mainland by the Makupa Causeway to the northwest, by the Nyali Bridge to the east and by the Likoni Ferry to the south. A road and rail bridge also serve the mainland container port near Port Reitz.

Port Tudor and Tudor Creek were named by Owen Tudor the Royal Navy captain who first surveyed the area.

==Geography==
Mombasa Island is one of the four divisions of Mombasa County. The division has a population of 1,208,333 (2019 census). It is divided into six subdivisions:
* Ganjoni
* Railway
* Tononoka
* Tudor
* Majengo
* Old Town

<doc id="566318" wikidata="Q238809" url="?curid=566318" title="Trienio Liberal">
<text>The , () or Three Liberal Years, was a period of three years in the modern history of Spain between 1820 and 1823, when a liberal government ruled Spain after a military uprising in January 1820 by the lieutenant-colonel Rafael de Riego against the absolutist rule of Ferdinand VII.

It ended in 1823 when, with the approval of the crowned heads of Europe, a French army invaded Spain and reinstated the King&#x27;s absolute power. This invasion is known in France as the &quot;Spanish Expedition&quot; () and in Spain as &quot;The Hundred Thousand Sons of St. Louis&quot;.

==Revolution of Cabezas de San Juan==

King Ferdinand VII provoked widespread unrest, particularly in the army, by refusing to accept the liberal Spanish Constitution of 1812. The King sought to reclaim the Spanish colonies in the Americas that had recently revolted successfully, consequently depriving Spain from an important source of revenue.

In January 1820, soldiers assembled at Cádiz for an expedition to South America, angry over infrequent pay, bad food and poor quarters, mutinied under the leadership of Rafael del Riego. Pledging fealty to the 1812 Constitution, they seized their commander.

Subsequently, the rebel forces moved to nearby San Fernando, where they began preparations to march on the capital, Madrid.

== Liberal government ==

Despite the rebels&#x27; relative weakness, Ferdinand accepted the constitution on 9 March 1820, granting power to liberal ministers and ushering in the so-called Liberal Triennium (&quot;el Trienio Liberal&quot;), a period of liberal rule. However, political conspiracies of both right and left proliferated in Spain, as was the case across much of the rest of Europe. Liberal revolutionaries stormed the King&#x27;s palace and seized Ferdinand VII, who was a prisoner of the Cortes in all but name for the next three years and retired to Aranjuez. The elections to the Cortes Generales in 1822 were won by Rafael del Riego. Ferdinand&#x27;s supporters set themselves up at Urgell, took up arms and put in place an absolutist regency, the Urgel Regency.

Ferdinand&#x27;s supporters, accompanied by the Royal Guard, staged an uprising in Madrid that was subdued by forces supporting the new government and its constitution. Despite the defeat of Ferdinand&#x27;s supporters at Madrid, civil war erupted in the regions of Castile, Toledo, and Andalusia.

Three years of liberal rule (the &quot;Trienio Liberal&quot;) followed. The Progresista government reorganized Spain into 52 provinces, and it intended to reduce the regional autonomy that had been a hallmark of Spanish bureaucracy since Habsburg rule in the 16th and 17th centuries. Opposition of the affected regions, in particular, Aragon, Navarre, and Catalonia, shared in the king&#x27;s antipathy for the liberal government. The anticlerical policies of the Progresista government led to friction with the Catholic Church, and attempts to bring about industrialisation alienated old trade guilds. The Spanish Inquisition, which had been abolished by both Joseph Bonaparte and the Cortes of Cádiz during the French occupation, was ended again by the government, which led to accusations of it being nothing more than &quot;afrancesados&quot; (francophiles), who, only six years earlier, had been forced out of the country.

More radical liberals attempted to revolt against the entire idea of a monarchy, regardless of how little power it had. In 1821, they were suppressed, but the incident served to illustrate the frail coalition that bound the government together.The election of a radical liberal government in 1823 further destabilized Spain. The army, whose liberal leanings had brought the government to power, began to waver when the Spanish economy failed to improve, and in 1823, a mutiny in Madrid had to be suppressed. The Jesuits, who had been banned by Charles III in the 18th century, only to be rehabilitated by Ferdinand VII after his restoration, were banned again by the government. For the duration of liberal rule, Ferdinand (still technically head of state) lived under virtual house arrest in Madrid. The Congress of Vienna, ending the Napoleonic Wars, had inaugurated the &quot;Congress system&quot; as an instrument of international stability in Europe. Rebuffed by the Holy Alliance of Russia, Austria, and Prussia in his request for help against the liberal revolutionaries in 1820, by 1822, the &quot;Concert of Europe&quot; was so concerned by Spain&#x27;s liberal government and its surprising hardiness that it was prepared to intervene on Ferdinand&#x27;s behalf.

In 1822, the Congress of Verona authorized France to intervene. Louis XVIII of France was only too happy to put an end to Spain&#x27;s liberal experiment, and a massive army, the 100,000 Sons of Saint Louis, was dispatched across the Pyrenees in April 1823. The Spanish army, fraught by internal divisions, offered little resistance to the well organised French force, who seized Madrid and reinstalled Ferdinand as absolute monarch. The liberals&#x27; hopes for a new Spanish War of Independence were dashed.

Regarding the policy for America in the absolutist period, the new government changed political repression into negotiation. Sending troops was replaced by commissioners to attract pro-independence leaders, who were invited to submit to royal authority in exchange for recognition by Spain. With that in mind, the government announced a ceasefire for negotiations with the rebels until the 1812 Constitution, which ironically, had been superseded by Ferdinand&#x27;s actions, was accepted.

According to the ceasefire, Spain would end the persecution and would issue a blanket amnesty for the insurgents; otherwise, the war would continue. The 11 commissioners failed, since the patriots demanded recognition of their independence from Spain.

==French intervention==

In 1822, Ferdinand VII applied the terms of the Congress of Vienna, lobbied for the assistance of the other absolute monarchs of Europe, in the process joining the Holy Alliance formed by Russia, Prussia, Austria and France to restore absolutism. In France, the ultra-royalists pressured Louis XVIII to intervene. To temper their counter-revolutionary ardour, the Duc de Richelieu deployed troops along the Pyrenees Mountains along the France-Spain border, charging them with halting the spread of Spanish liberalism and the &quot;yellow fever&quot; from encroaching into France. In September 1822, the &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; became an observation corps and then very quickly transformed itself into a military expedition.
The Holy Alliance (Russia, Austria and Prussia) refused Ferdinand&#x27;s request for help, but the Quintuple Alliance (United Kingdom, France, Russia, Prussia and Austria), at the Congress of Verona in October 1822, gave France a mandate to intervene and restore the Spanish monarchy. On 22 January 1823, a secret treaty was signed at the congress of Verona, allowing France to invade Spain to restore Ferdinand VII as an absolute monarch. With that agreement from the Holy Alliance, on 28 January 1823, Louis XVIII announced that &quot;a hundred thousand Frenchmen are ready to march, invoking the name of Saint Louis, to safeguard the throne of Spain for a grandson of Henry IV of France&quot;.

<doc id="566319" wikidata="Q125614" url="?curid=566319" title="Patrik Štefan">
<text>Patrik Štefan (born 16 September 1980) is a Czech former professional ice hockey player who was drafted as the first overall pick by the Atlanta Thrashers in the 1999 NHL entry draft.

==Playing career==
Prior to being drafted by the Thrashers, Štefan played for Sparta Praha in the Czech Republic, and the Long Beach Ice Dogs of the IHL.

Štefan played six seasons for the Atlanta Thrashers scoring 177 points. During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Štefan played for Ilves Tampere in the SM-liiga. In 37 games, Štefan collected a total of 41 points including 28 assists. In the playoffs, Štefan had six assists and a goal in seven games.

On 24 June 2006, Štefan was traded to the Dallas Stars along with Jaroslav Modrý for Niko Kapanen and a seventh-round draft pick in 2006.

After Štefan&#x27;s contract expired in 2007, the Stars chose not to re-sign him. Štefan signed with SC Bern of the Nationalliga A, but he only played three games for them before retiring in October 2007, largely due to a serious hip injury, the latest of several chronic injuries that plagued his career.

===Empty net blunder===
Štefan gained notoriety on 4 January 2007, for a blunder during a game against the Edmonton Oilers. With seconds left in the game, and Dallas already ahead by a goal, Štefan gained possession of the puck and found himself on a breakaway towards an empty net. Štefan continued skating towards the crease rather than immediately shooting, then attempted a casual backhand into the net from close quarters. The puck hit bad ice and bounced up and over his stick, causing him to miss the goal, trip, and fall against the ice. To compound the error, he then cleared the puck in the direction of the Oilers. This allowed a play to develop where fellow Czech Aleš Hemský scored with two seconds remaining to tie the game 5–5; ultimately, Dallas won in a shootout.

==Personal life==
He is currently a player agent in the Detroit area, and a youth coach with 15U Little Caesars Hockey.

Štefan&#x27;s son James is a prospect for the Edmonton Oilers.

<text>Ahmed Abitai Santos (born February 19, 1974, in Los Mochis, Sinaloa, Mexico) is a newspaper columnist and former boxer.

==Boxing career==
Santos debuted professionally on October 2, 1992, with a ten-round draw against Francisco Sandoval in Los Mochis. Santos then won seven fights in a row, including a second-round knockout of Sandoval in a rematch held at Culiacán, before moving to Phoenix in 1995.

He kept his winning streak going until April 22, 1996, when he lost to former world title challenger David Sample by a ten-round decision at Tempe, after having reached thirteen wins in a row.

He then won six of his next fights, drawing the other two, with two knockouts. After that, he challenged Pete Talliaferro for the IBA&#x27;s light welterweight title. He won that belt on September 10, 1997, with a nine-round knockout in Las Vegas. He defended the title only once, losing to Antonio Diaz by a twelve-round decision on December 20 of the same year.

Santos then won three of his next four bouts before challenging for the North American Boxing Federation light welterweight title. Among the three boxers he beat during that span were former world title challenger Billy Irwin and Ricky Quiles.

On April 16, 1999, at Bossier City, Louisiana, he beat Patrick Thomas by a twelve-round decision. On February 12, 2000, he received a shot at WBC light welterweight champion Kostya Tszyu. Santos lost that fight by a knockout in eight rounds.

He went on to lose two of his next three fights before retiring. Santos had a ring record of 26 wins, 5 losses and 4 draws, with 14 wins by knockout.

==Writing career==
After retiring from boxing, Santos started to write articles for the Phoenix edition of the American Spanish language newspaper, &quot;Prensa Hispana&quot;. 
In 2003, &quot;Prensa Hispana&#x27;s&quot; main Phoenix competitor, &quot;La Voz&quot;, lured him to their roster of writers.

He lives in Phoenix, Arizona.

<text>Oymyakon is a rural locality (a &quot;selo&quot;) in Oymyakonsky District of the Sakha Republic, Russia, located in the Yana-Oymyakon Highlands, along the Indigirka River, northwest of Tomtor on the Kolyma Highway. Oymyakon is the coldest permanently inhabited human settlement on Earth, with an average winter temperature of around .

==Etymology==
The settlement is named after the Oymyakon River, whose name reportedly comes from the Even word &quot;kheium&quot;, meaning &quot;unfrozen patch of water; place where fish spend the winter&quot;. However, another source states that the Even word &quot;heyum&quot; (hэjум, хэюм; &quot;kheium&quot; may be a misspelling), which means &quot;frozen lake&quot;, may be where it gets its name.

==Geography==
Oymyakon has two main valleys beside it. These valleys trap wind inside the town and create a colder climate. The temperatures here are extremely cold for most of the year, and it snows frequently in spring and autumn, but rarely in summer and winter, due to the Siberian High in winter, and temperatures being commonly above in summer. Schools are closed if it is colder than .

==History==

During World War II, an airfield was built in the district of Aeroport, for the Alaska-Siberian (ALSIB) air route, used to ferry American Lend-Lease aircraft to the Eastern Front. Oymyakon is located near the historic Road of Bones. Over the last few decades, the population of Oymyakon has shrunk significantly. The village had a peak population of roughly 2,500 inhabitants, but that number has dwindled to fewer than 900 in 2018. The local economy is mostly fur trading and ice fishing.

==Religion==
Most inhabitants of Oymyakon are either Orthodox Christians or non-religious. Aiyy Faith and Shamanism also have a presence in the area.

==Climate==
With an extreme subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfd&quot;, Trewartha climate classification &quot;Ecle&quot;), Oymyakon is known as one of the places considered the Northern Pole of Cold, the other being the town of Verkhoyansk, located away by air. The weather station is in a valley between Oymyakon and Tomtor. The station is at above sea level and the surrounding mountains, at , cause cold air to pool in the valley: in fact, recent studies show that winter temperatures in the area &quot;increase&quot; with altitude by as much as . The ground is permanently frozen (continuous permafrost).

There is a monument built around the town square commemorating an unofficial reading in January 1924 of . This was shown on the Australian program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in a 2012 documentary. On 6 February 1933, a temperature of was recorded at Oymyakon&#x27;s weather station. This was almost the coldest officially recorded temperature in the Northern Hemisphere (Verkhoyansk had recorded on 5 and 7 February, 1892). Only Antarctica and Greenland have recorded lower official temperatures (the lowest being , recorded at Vostok Station on 21 July 1983). The unofficial record cold temperature is roughly warmer than the sublimation point of carbon dioxide.

During some years, the temperature drops below in late September and remains below freezing until mid-April. Oymyakon has never recorded an above-freezing temperature between 26 October and 16 March inclusive. In Oymyakon sometimes the average minimum temperature for December, January, and February falls below : in the record coldest month of January 1931 the monthly mean was . Sometimes summer months can also be quite chilly, but in June, July, and August, the temperature has never dropped below , while in June and July, the temperature has never dropped below . Oymyakon and Verkhoyansk are the only two permanently inhabited places in the world that have recorded temperatures below for every day in January. By the contrast July is the month where every day has had temperatures above . Every day of the year has a record low below freezing, with 9 July having the highest record low at . In contrast, 4 January has the lowest record high at .

Although winters in Oymyakon are long and extremely cold, summers are mild to warm, sometimes hot, with cool to cold summer nights. The warmest month on record was July 2022 with an average temperature of . In June, July, and August, temperatures over are not rare during the day. On 7 July 2022, the warmest night on record was observed, with an overnight minimum of . On 28 July 2010, Oymyakon recorded a record high temperature of , yielding a temperature range of . Verkhoyansk, Yakutsk, Delyankir, Tegyulte, and Fort Vermilion, Canada are the only other known places in the world that have a temperature amplitude higher than . Fort Yukon, Alaska, falls 1 degree C short of this threshold. Also, Oymyakon is tied with Verkhoyansk for the highest temperature amplitude in the world, and Verkhoyansk is tied with Fort Yukon for the warmest temperature above the Arctic Circle ever, .

The climate is quite dry, but as average monthly temperatures are below freezing for seven months of the year, substantial evaporation occurs only in summer months. Summers are much wetter than winters. Due to its harsh winters, the plant hardiness zone in Oymyakon is 0a. A small number of trees such as the Dahurian larch can still grow nonetheless.

<doc id="566329" wikidata="Q2975313" url="?curid=566329" title="Ottoman–Persian War (1821–1823)">
<text>The Ottoman–Persian War of 1821–1823 was fought between the Ottoman Empire and Qajar Iran from 1821 to 1823.

==Background==
Tensions between the two empires had been rising due to the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s harboring of rebellious tribesmen from the Iranian Azerbaijan Province. The issues concerning the Kurdish borderland tribes such as the Haydaran and Sipki tribes had complicated the relations between the two empires. For instance, Iran launched a military campaign against Dervish Pasha, the &quot;muhafiz&quot; of Van, when he refused to return the Sipki Kurdish who took refuge and settled in Archesh.

The Ottoman-Persian War that began in 1821 was also part of a series of wars between the two empires, which was attributed to the influences of foreign powers, particularly Great Britain and the Russian Empire. The Persians and the Ottomans were within their respective spheres of influence and were drawn to their rivalry. The Russian Empire was attempting to put pressure on the Ottoman Empire, which was then at war with the Greeks.

==War==

Crown Prince Abbas Mirza of Persia, at the instigation of the Russian Empire, invaded Western Armenia and the areas surrounding the Iranian province of Azerbaijan. On 10 September 1821, the Iranian forces marched out of Tabriz towards the border. On 16 September, Iranian forces crossed the border at Gürbulak and stormed the Bayezid Fortress in November 1821, securing Persian supply routes. As the Iranian army marched into the region, they went after the Heydaran tribesmen, who would flee to Diyarbakir.

After Abbas Mirza&#x27;s successful winter campaign, he withdrew most of his forces to Tabriz while leaving garrisons in significant towns and cities. The Turks began to organize a counterattack, organized under the new serasker, Mohammad Amin Rauf Pasha. They planned to steamroll the garrisons in Eastern Anatolia and occupy parts of Azerbaijan to prevent Iran from gathering their troops, and force a peace on Ottoman terms. However, the fortress of Toprah Kaleh stood in the way of Ottoman plans due to its strategic location. The Sardar of Erevan kept raiding Ottoman positions around Toprah Kaleh, allowing Abbas Mirza precious time to recover forces to relieve the fortress. The resulting battle in May 1822 was a defeat for the Ottomans, but the Iranians were unable to take advantage of their success.

In 1821, the Qajar army besieged Baghdad with 40,000 infantry and artillery, but Dawud Pasha successfully defended the city with 3,900 infantry and 8,800 cavalry, preventing the Qajars from breaking through. Combined with the effects of disease, Mohammad Ali Mirza was ultimately forced to lift the siege. Meanwhile, Abbas Mirza marched into eastern Anatolia with 30,000 troops and met an Ottoman army of 50,000 at the Battle of Erzurum. Abbas Mirza scored a crushing victory over the Ottomans despite being severely outnumbered and his army suffering from a cholera epidemic.

==Result==
Peace was not concluded until the Treaty of Erzurum two years later; both sides recognized the previous borders established by the Treaty of Zuhab in 1639, with no territorial changes. Also included in the treaty, was the guaranteed access for Persian pilgrims to the holy sites of Mecca and Medina within the Ottoman Empire.

===Tampa Bay Lightning (1998–2013)===
Lecavalier was drafted first overall by Tampa Bay in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft, during which new Lightning owner Art Williams proclaimed that Lecavalier would be &quot;the Michael Jordan of hockey&quot;.

On March 1, 2000, following his sophomore season, he was named captain, becoming the youngest captain in NHL history at 19 years and 314 days (since surpassed by Sidney Crosby in May 2007, Gabriel Landeskog in September 2012, and Connor McDavid in October 2016). Previously, Steve Yzerman had held that honour, having been named captain of the Detroit Red Wings at 21 years, 5 months.

However, Lecavalier did not fulfill expectations and was later stripped of the captaincy before the 2001–02 NHL season when Lightning management decided he was too young even as a high calibre player. Around that time, he clashed frequently with head coach John Tortorella.

Tortorella has since noted that Lecavalier matured since losing the team captaincy. During the 2003–04 NHL season, while Martin St. Louis led in regular season scoring and Brad Richards led in the playoffs, Lecavalier played a key role in the team&#x27;s Stanley Cup victory, assisting on the Cup-clinching goal by Ruslan Fedotenko in the deciding seventh game of the Stanley Cup Finals against the Calgary Flames. He was named MVP of the Canadian National Team in the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, which Canada won.

During the lock-out which cancelled the 2004–05 NHL season, Lecavalier, along with Lightning teammates Nikolai Khabibulin and Brad Richards, played for Ak Bars Kazan in the Russian Superleague. Lecavalier scored 15 points as Kazan finished 4th in the league and lost in the first round of the playoffs.

Lecavalier was chosen to play for Team Canada at the 2006 Olympics, but returned to Tampa without a medal.

Lecavalier broke the all-time Tampa Bay Lightning record for most points in a season by scoring his 95th point on March 16, 2007, against the Buffalo Sabres. The record was previously held by Martin St. Louis, who had 94 points during the 2003–04 NHL season. His record of 108 points was since surpassed by future Lightning forward Nikita Kucherov, who recorded Art Ross trophy-winning 128 points (41 goals, 87 assists) during the Lightning&#x27;s Presidents Trophy-winning 2018–19 season and holds the record at this point. On March 30, 2007, in a game against the Carolina Hurricanes, Lecavalier became the first Lightning player to record 50 goals in a season. He finished the season with 52 goals, edging Ottawa&#x27;s Dany Heatley, who scored 50 goals, to earn the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s top goal scorer for the 2006–07 season.

During the 2007–08 season, Lecavalier recorded eight straight multipoint games, being the first to do so since Jaromír Jágr in 1996. The scoring streak put him first in the NHL scoring race, until he was surpassed by Ottawa Senators&#x27; captain, Daniel Alfredsson, who scored seven points in the final game before the All-Star break. He was named captain of the Eastern Conference at the 2008 NHL All Star Game. At the end of the season he was named the winner of both the King Clancy Memorial Trophy and the NHL Foundation Player Award for his tremendous charity work in the community.
On July 12, 2008, Lecavalier agreed to an eleven-year, $85 million contract extension with the Lightning. His new contract began after the 2008–09 season, and ran through the 2019–20 season. He was renamed captain of the Tampa Bay Lightning on September 18, 2008. In mid-January 2009, rumours were swirling around a possible trade which would send Lecavalier to the Montreal Canadiens, his hometown, but Brian Lawton later stated that Lecavalier would rather stay in Tampa Bay for the rest of his career. Lecavalier confirmed in his own words his preference of playing in Tampa Bay over his native Montreal. On January 24, at the NHL&#x27;s superskills competition, Lecavalier received the loudest ovation from the Montreal crowd when he was being introduced. Lecavalier underwent season-ending wrist surgery on April 3, 2009.

Lecavalier ended the 2010–11 season with 25 goals and 29 assists for 54 points in 65 games as the Lightning made a heavy resurgence as a team having finished the season as the fifth seed in the East and qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since 2007 as a result. In the 2011 playoffs, Lecavalier and the Lighting recovered from a 3–1 series deficit in the first round against the fourth-seeded Pittsburgh Penguins and defeated them in seven games and would go on to sweep the top-seeded Washington Capitals in the second round before falling in the third round to the third-seeded and eventual Stanley Cup champion Boston Bruins in seven games, one win short from clinching a spot the Stanley Cup Finals. Lecavalier finished the playoffs with six goals and 13 assists for 19 points in all 18 games.

On January 21, 2013, Lecavalier played in his 1000th NHL game in a 4–3 loss to the New York Islanders, becoming the 280th NHL player to reach that milestone. The team honoured him on January 25, their next home game, a 6–4 win against the Ottawa Senators, with several gifts including an engraved silver stick.

In June 2013, the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that the Lightning and Toronto Maple Leafs had discussed a trade which would have sent Lecavalier to Toronto; the Maple Leafs would receive an asset in exchange for buying out Lecavalier&#x27;s contract and he would then be free to re-sign with Tampa as an unrestricted free agent at a lower salary cap hit. Though the Maple Leafs denied the report, NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly promptly sent out a memo to all 30 league teams, warning them to avoid transactions deemed a circumvention of the collective bargaining agreement. The CBA prevents teams from re-signing players they&#x27;ve bought out for a minimum of one year. One day later, the Lightning announced that it was buying out Lecavalier&#x27;s contract, allowing their longest serving player to become an unrestricted free agent. The buyout would pay Lecavalier a total of $32.67 million and rid the Lightning of his $7.727 million salary cap hit.

===Philadelphia Flyers (2013–2016)===
On July 2, 2013, less than a week after being bought out by the Lightning, Lecavalier signed with the Philadelphia Flyers who agreed to pay him $22.5 million over a five-year contract; which is in addition to the $2.33 million he will receive annually from the Lightning for the next 14 years. Lecavalier chose to wear number 40 with the Flyers as his usual number 4 had been retired by the Flyers in honour of Barry Ashbee. On November 27, 2013, Lecavalier made his first return to Tampa as a member of the visiting team and was welcomed with a tribute video as well as a long, standing ovation from Lightning fans. He scored a goal in his homecoming and was awarded the game&#x27;s 3rd star. Lecavalier finished the season registering 20 goals and 17 assists, and scored his 400th career goal against the Boston Bruins on March 30, 2014. The Flyers qualified for the 2014 playoffs, before being eliminated in seven games by the New York Rangers in the first round, in which Lecavalier had one goal and an assist in the series.

The 2014-15 NHL season began quite poorly for Lecavalier, and on December 2, 2014 he was a healthy scratch for the first time in his career. On April 9, 2015, in a game against the Carolina Hurricanes, Lecavalier fought twice against Hurricanes rookie Keegan Lowe, who was playing his first NHL game. Lecavalier didn&#x27;t play the third period and suffered a concussion.

===Los Angeles Kings (2016)===
During the 2015–16 season, having played sparingly for the previous two seasons within the Flyers organization, Lecavalier was traded alongside Luke Schenn to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for Jordan Weal and a third round pick on January 6, 2016. One of the stipulations of the trade was that Lecavalier would retire at the end of the season to keep the Kings from being saddled with his hit to the salary cap. With number 4 being retired for Rob Blake, Lecavalier chose number 44 for the Kings. He officially announced his retirement on June 21, 2016.

==Personal life==
Lecavalier went to John Rennie High School in Pointe-Claire, Quebec for two years (1992–1993) before transferring to Athol Murray College of Notre Dame in Wilcox, Saskatchewan. He has been friends with former teammate Brad Richards, who won the Conn Smythe Trophy in 2004 as Most Valuable Player of the NHL playoffs, since the age of 14, when they met at Notre Dame, where they were roommates and became best friends. Since then they have gone on to become teammates with the Rimouski Océanic, the Tampa Bay Lightning and also with Ak Bars Kazan. Lecavalier currently resides in Tampa&#x27;s Davis Island.

Lecavalier began dating Caroline Portelance in 2001. After ten years of dating, the two were married in 2011. The couple have three children together, Olivia, Gabe, and Amelia.

He is featured in &quot;The Rocket: The Maurice Richard Story&quot; where he portrayed legendary Montreal Canadiens centre, Jean Béliveau. He wore number 4 to honour Béliveau.

EA Sports&#x27; video game &quot;NHL 06&quot; featured Lecavalier as the cover athlete.

In October 2007, Lecavalier pledged $3 million to a new All Children&#x27;s Hospital facility under construction in St. Petersburg, Florida. The facility was named the Vincent Lecavalier Pediatric Cancer and Blood Disorders Center in his honour.

On February 10, 2018, the Tampa Bay Lightning retired Lecavalier&#x27;s number 4 jersey. Lecavalier is the second player in franchise history to have his jersey retired, the first being Martin St. Louis.

On March 17, 2023, Lecavalier was inducted into the Tampa Bay Lightning Hall of Fame, as a member of its inaugural class.

<doc id="566371" wikidata="Q948857" url="?curid=566371" title="Racing Rules of Sailing">
<text>The Racing Rules of Sailing (often abbreviated to RRS) govern the conduct of yacht racing, windsurfing, kitesurfing, model boat racing, dinghy racing and virtually any other form of racing around a course with more than one vessel while powered by the wind. A new revision is published every four years (after the Olympic Games) by World Sailing, the sport&#x27;s world governing body. Full information on the rules can be viewed at World Sailing.

== Contents of the Rules ==

The &quot;Racing Rules of Sailing&quot; were most dramatically simplified in 1997 since the 1940s. The new document contains four main rules [Part 2, Section A]:

# Boats on a port tack shall keep clear of boats on starboard tack (Rule 10).
# When boats are on the same tack and overlapped, the boat to windward (the boat closest to the wind) shall keep clear of a leeward boat (Rule 11).
# When boats are on the same tack and not overlapped, the boat that is astern shall keep clear of the boat ahead. (Rule 12).
# When a boat is tacking (changing tack) it shall keep clear of boats that are not tacking (Rule 13).

Four rules about general limitations: [Part 2, Section B]

# Even if you have right-of-way, it is your duty to avoid a collision, once it becomes apparent that the other boat is not keeping clear (Rule 14).
# If you acquire right of way, you must initially give the other boat room to keep clear, unless you get right of way because of the other boat&#x27;s actions. (Rule 15)
# A boat that changes course, even if it has the right-of-way, shall do so in a manner that gives the burdened boat a chance to &quot;keep clear&quot; (Rule 16).
# If you catch up with another boat and you want to pass it to leeward, you may not sail above your proper course &quot;i.e.&quot; you shall not luff higher than you would have done if that boat wasn&#x27;t there (Rule 17)

Three rules about marks and obstructions [Part 2, Section C]
plus some other rules about starting errors, taking penalties, moving astern, when you are capsized or anchored or run aground, and interfering with another boat.

In total there are 91 rules but (since the major simplification in 1997) only 15 rules govern what boats do when they meet on the water (part 2 rules). It is not necessary to know all of the rules to successfully compete in a dinghy race, but a knowledge of the basics is recommended.

Sailboat racing is a self-regulated sport. As stated by the &quot;Racing Rules of Sailing&quot;, &quot;Competitors in the sport of sailing are governed by a body of rules that they are expected to follow and enforce. A fundamental principle of sportsmanship is that when competitors break a rule they will promptly take a penalty, which may be to retire.&quot;.

Depending on the nature of the infraction, the penalty may be either: (1) performing a turn consisting of one tack and one gybe or (2) performing two turns consisting of two tacks and two gybes (except for windsurfing).

For most rules infractions, a competitor may be absolved from disqualification from the race by taking such a penalty. However, if the infraction caused injury or serious damage, or produced a significant advantage in the race or series, the penalty shall be to retire. If a competitor fails to take penalty turn(s) they may be disqualified after a hearing by the Protest Committee. The aforementioned principles do not apply to match racing (like the America&#x27;s Cup) where on-the-water umpires impose penalties immediately after an infraction occurs.

== Race signals ==

Sail races are governed with flags and sound signals to indicate flag changes. The flags used are taken from the International maritime signal flag set. During a race and for any signal concerning the race, these flags are defined in the &quot;Racing Rules of Sailing&quot; but the signal can be modified by the Sailing Instructions.

The raising (hoisting) or removing of a visual signal is accompanied by the emission of a sound signal to draw attention to the new signal. The type of the sound signal (one short sound, two short sounds, one long sound, etc.) is described by the rule according to the type of signal.
The usual meanings of these flags are as follows:

=== Postponement signal ===

The Answering Pennant (AP) with or without a numerical pennant is used to indicate a postponed race.
A numerical pennant below the AP denotes the time, in hours, of the race postponement.

=== Preparatory signal ===

These signal flags are used before a race start and most commonly as part of a start sequence/procedure.
=== Start signal ===
These signal flags are used in the pre-start procedure. Class flags can be numeral pennants 1 , 2 , and 3 however they can be substituted to avoid confusion with the postponement signals relating to a particular class.

=== Recall signal ===

=== Course change signal ===

=== Abandonment signal ===

=== Other signals ===

==History==
The Water Club of Cork Harbour, founded in 1720, and oldest member-led yacht club in the world, had a set of rules for members. The earliest were largely concerned with conduct and flags used to signal between yachts as the earliest club meetings sailed in formation like naval manoeuvres.

The Yacht Club, which became the Royal Yacht Squadron was similar, initially its members divided into two squadrons of equal numbers, who were supposed to sail behind the Commodore. By 1819 individual matches were being held, as sporting bets, between particular yachts.

In 1828 the Royal Yacht Squadron introduced more sailing related regulations, including forbidding the shifting of ballast, receiving outside assistance and that a yacht on the port tack should in all cases give way to one on a starboard tack. 

Other yacht clubs were similarly introducing rules, the Royal Thames Yacht Club having one allowing a yacht to signal a protest by raising the club ensign. The New York Yacht Club published its rules in 1846, many of them similar to, but expanding on the RYS rules.

As yachts around Britain began to meet and race against each other the need for a common set of rules became apparent. The Royal Yachting Association was founded in 1875, and with the Prince of Wales as its Commodore, its rules were accepted by all the national clubs. The rules continued to evolve from the originals, via the Tonnage Rule and the Sail Area Rule.

Worldwide similar national yacht racing authorities were formed, each having its own, largely similar rules. The sport of sailing is sufficiently technical that which set of rules are used can make a significant difference to results, particularly in relation to measurement and definition of waterline length. Major Brooke Heckstall-Smith, secretary of the Yacht Racing Association, brought together the associations of 11 European countries in 1906 to discuss common measurement standards. The continuing discussions led to the formation of the International Yacht Racing Union (IYRU) in 1907. Renamed to International Sailing Federation (ISAF) in 1996 and World Sailing in 2015, this continues to be the rule-setting body for the sport of sailing.

<doc id="566381" wikidata="Q37351" url="?curid=566381" title="Langues d'oïl">
<text>The langues d&#x27;oïl ( , , ) are a dialect continuum that includes standard French and its closest autochthonous relatives historically spoken in the northern half of France, southern Belgium, and the Channel Islands. They belong to the larger category of Gallo-Romance languages, which also include the historical languages of east-central France and western Switzerland, southern France, portions of northern Italy, the Val d&#x27;Aran in Spain, and under certain acceptations those of Catalonia.

Linguists divide the Romance languages of France, and especially of Medieval France, into two main geographical subgroups: the &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot; to the North, and the &quot;langues d&#x27;oc&quot; in the Southern half of France. Both groups are named after the word for &quot;yes&quot; in their recent ancestral languages. The most common modern &quot;langue d&#x27;oïl&quot; is standard French, in which the ancestral &quot;oïl&quot; has become &quot;oui&quot;.

==Terminology==
&quot;Langue d&#x27;oïl&quot; (in the singular), &quot;Oïl dialects&quot; and &quot;Oïl languages&quot; (in the plural) designate the ancient northern Gallo-Romance languages as well as their modern-day descendants. They share many linguistic features, a prominent one being the word &quot;oïl&quot; for &quot;yes&quot;. (&quot;Oc&quot; was and still is the southern word for &quot;yes&quot;, hence the &quot;langue d&#x27;oc&quot; or &quot;Occitan languages&quot;). The most widely spoken modern Oïl language is French (&quot;oïl&quot; was pronounced or , which has become , in modern French &quot;oui&quot;).

There are three uses of the term &quot;oïl&quot;:
#Langue d&#x27;oïl
#Oïl dialects
#Oïl languages

===Langue d&#x27;oïl===
In the singular, &quot;langue d&#x27;oïl&quot; refers to the mutually intelligible linguistic variants of &quot;lingua romana&quot; spoken since the 8th century in northern France and southern Belgium (Wallonia), since the 10th century in the Channel Islands, and between the 11th and 14th centuries in England (the Anglo-Norman language). &quot;Langue d&#x27;oïl&quot;, the term itself, has been used in the singular since the 12th century to denote this ancient linguistic grouping as a whole. With these qualifiers, &quot;langue d&#x27;oïl&quot; sometimes is used to mean the same as Old French (see &quot;History&quot; below).

===Oïl dialects===
In the plural, &quot;Oïl dialects&quot; refer to the varieties of the ancient &quot;langue d&#x27;oïl&quot;.

===Oïl languages===
&quot;Oïl languages&quot; are those modern-day descendants that evolved separately from the varieties of the ancient &quot;langue d&#x27;oïl&quot;. Consequently, &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot; today may apply either: to all the modern-day languages of this family &quot;except&quot; the French language; or to this family &quot;including&quot; French. &quot;&quot;Oïl&quot; dialects&quot; or &quot;French dialects&quot; are also used to refer to the &quot;Oïl languages except French&quot;—as some extant Oïl languages are very close to modern French. Because the term &quot;dialect&quot; is sometimes considered pejorative, the trend today among French linguists is to refer to these languages as &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot; rather than &quot;dialects&quot;.

==Varieties==

Five zones of partially mutually intelligible Oïl dialects have been proposed by Pierre Bec:
===Frankish zone (&quot;zone francique&quot;)===
*Picard
*Walloon
*Lorrain
*Northern Norman (spoken north of the Joret line) including: &quot;Anglo-Norman; Dgèrnésiais (spoken in Guernsey), Jèrriais (spoken in Jersey), Auregnais (spoken in Alderney), Sercquiais (spoken in Sark)&quot;
*Eastern Champenois

===Francien zone (&quot;zone francienne&quot;)===
*Standard French

Non-standard varieties:
*Orléanais
*, not to be confused with the 
*Berrichon
*Bourbonnais
*Western Champenois (or Eastern Francien)

===Burgundian zone (&quot;zone burgonde&quot;)===
*Bourguignon
*Franc-Comtois

===Armorican zone (&quot;zone armoricaine&quot;)===
*Eastern Armorican: Angevin; ; Manceau ( and ); Southern Norman (spoken south of the Joret line)
*Western Armorican: Gallo
Gallo has a stronger Celtic substrate from Breton. Gallo originated from the oïl speech of people from eastern and northern regions: Anjou; Maine (Mayenne and Sarthe); and Normandy; who were in contact with Breton speakers in Upper Brittany. See Marches of Neustria

===Poitevin-Saintongeais zone (&quot;zone poitevine&quot; and &quot;zone saintongeaise&quot;)===
Named after the former provinces of Poitou and Saintonge

==Development==
&quot;For the history of phonology, orthography, syntax and morphology, see &quot;History of the French language&quot; and the relevant individual Oïl language articles.&quot;

Each of the Oïl languages has developed in its own way from the common ancestor, and division of the development into periods varies according to the individual histories. Modern linguistics uses the following terms:
*9th–13th centuries
**Old French
**Old Norman
**etc.
*French
**Middle French for the period 14th–15th centuries
**16th century: &quot;français renaissance&quot; (Renaissance French)
**17th to 18th century: &quot;français classique&quot; (Classical French)

==History==
===Romana lingua===

In the 9th century, &quot;romana lingua&quot; (the term used in the &quot;Oaths of Strasbourg&quot; of 842) was the first of the Romance languages to be recognized by its speakers as a distinct language, probably because it was the most different from Latin compared with the other Romance languages (see &quot;History of the French language&quot;).

Many of the developments that are now considered typical of Walloon appeared between the 8th and 12th centuries. Walloon &quot;had a clearly defined identity from the beginning of the thirteenth century&quot;. In any case, linguistic texts from the time do not mention the language, even though they mention others in the Oïl family, such as Picard and Lorrain. During the 15th century, scribes in the region called the language &quot;Roman&quot; when they needed to distinguish it. It is not until the beginning of the 16th century that we find the first occurrence of the word &quot;Walloon&quot; in the same linguistic sense that we use it today.

===Langue d&#x27;oïl===
By late- or post-Roman times Vulgar Latin within France had developed two distinctive terms for signifying assent (&quot;yes&quot;): &quot;hoc ille&quot; (&quot;this (is) it&quot;) and &quot;hoc&quot; (&quot;this&quot;), which became &quot;oïl&quot; and &quot;oc&quot;, respectively. Subsequent development changed &quot;oïl&quot; into &quot;oui&quot;, as in modern French. The term &quot;langue d&#x27;oïl&quot; itself was first used in the 12th century, referring to the Old French linguistic grouping noted above. In the 14th century, the Italian poet Dante mentioned the &quot;yes&quot; distinctions in his &quot;De vulgari eloquentia&quot;. He wrote in Medieval Latin: &quot;nam alii oc, alii si, alii vero dicunt oil&quot; (&quot;some say &#x27;oc&#x27;, others say &#x27;sì&#x27;, others say &#x27;oïl&#x27;&quot;)—thereby distinguishing at least three classes of Romance languages: &quot;oc languages&quot; (in southern France); &quot;si languages&quot; (in Italy and Iberia) and &quot;oïl languages&quot; (in northern France).

Other Romance languages derive their word for &quot;yes&quot; from the classical Latin &quot;sic&quot; , such as the Italian &quot;sì&quot;, Spanish and Catalan &quot;sí&quot;, Portuguese &quot;sim&quot;, and even French &quot;si&quot; (used when contradicting another&#x27;s negative assertion). Sardinian is an exception in that its word for &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;eja&quot;, is from neither origin. Similarly Romanian uses &quot;da&quot; for &quot;yes&quot;, which is assumed to be of Slavic origin, but may be from Latin &quot;ita vero&quot;, &quot;truly so&quot;.

However, neither &quot;lingua romana&quot; nor referred, at their respective time, to a single homogeneous language but to mutually intelligible linguistic varieties. In those times, spoken languages in Western Europe were not codified (except Latin and Medieval Latin), the region&#x27;s population was considerably lower than today, and population centers were more isolated from each other. As a result, mutually intelligible linguistic varieties were referred to as one language.

===French (Old French/Standardized Oïl) or lingua Gallicana===
In the 13th century these varieties were recognized and referred to as &quot;dialects&quot; (&quot;idioms&quot;) of a single language, the &quot;langue d&#x27;oïl&quot;. However, since the previous centuries a common literary and juridical &quot;interdialectary&quot; langue d&#x27;oïl had emerged, a kind of koiné. In the late 13th century this common langue d&#x27;oïl was named &quot;French&quot; (&quot;françois&quot; in French, &quot;lingua gallica&quot; or &quot;gallicana&quot; in Medieval Latin). Both aspects of &quot;dialects of a same language&quot; and &quot;French as the common langue d&#x27;oïl&quot; appear in a text of Roger Bacon, &quot;Opus maius&quot;, who wrote in Medieval Latin but translated thus: &quot;Indeed, idioms of a same language vary amongst people, as it occurs in the French language which varies in an idiomatic manner amongst the French, Picards, Normans and Burgundians. And terms right to the Picards horrify the Burgundians as much as their closer neighbours the French&quot;.

It is from this period though that definitions of individual Oïl languages are first found. The Picard language is first referred to by name as &quot;langage pikart&quot; in 1283 in the &quot;Livre Roisin&quot;. The author of the &quot;Vie du bienheureux Thomas Hélye de Biville&quot; refers to the Norman character of his writing. The &quot;Sermons poitevins&quot; of around 1250 show the Poitevin language developing as it straddled the line between oïl and oc.

As a result, in modern times the term &quot;langue d&#x27;oïl&quot; also refers to that Old French which was not as yet named &quot;French&quot; but was already—before the late 13th century—used as a literary and juridical &quot;interdialectary language&quot;.

The term &quot;Francien&quot; is a linguistic neologism coined in the 19th century to name the hypothetical variant of Old French allegedly spoken by the &quot;late 14th century&quot; in the ancient province of &quot;Pays de France&quot;—the then Paris region later called &quot;Île-de-France&quot;. This &quot;Francien&quot;, it is claimed, became the Medieval French language. Current linguistic thinking mostly discounts the &quot;Francien&quot; theory, although it is still often quoted in popular textbooks. The term &quot;francien&quot; was never used by those people supposed to have spoken the variant; but today the term could be used to designate that specific &quot;10th-and-11th centuries&quot; variant of langue d&#x27;oïl spoken in the Paris region; both variants contributed to the koine, as both were called &quot;French&quot; at that time.

===Rise of French (Standardized Oïl) versus other Oïl languages===
For political reasons it was in Paris and Île-de-France that this koiné developed from a written language into a spoken language. Already in the 12th century Conon de Béthune reported about the French court who blamed him for using words of Artois.

By the late 13th century the written koiné had begun to turn into a spoken and written standard language, and was named &quot;French&quot;. Since then French started to be imposed on the other Oïl dialects as well as on the territories of &quot;langue d&#x27;oc&quot;.

However, the Oïl dialects and &quot;langue d&#x27;oc&quot; continued contributing to the lexis of French.

In 1539 the French language was imposed by the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts. It required Latin be replaced in judgements and official acts and deeds. The local Oïl languages had always been the language spoken in justice courts. The Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts was not intended to make French a national language, merely a chancery language for law and administration. Although there were competing literary standards among the Oïl languages in the mediæval period, the centralisation of the French kingdom and its influence even outside its formal borders sent most of the Oïl languages into comparative obscurity for several centuries. The development of literature in this new language encouraged writers to use French rather than their own regional languages. This led to the decline of vernacular literature.

It was the French Revolution which imposed French on the people as the official language in all the territory. As the influence of French (and in the Channel Islands, English) spread among sectors of provincial populations, cultural movements arose to study and standardise the vernacular languages. From the 18th century and into the 20th century, societies were founded (such as the &quot;Société liégoise de Littérature wallonne&quot; in 1856), dictionaries (such as George Métivier&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire franco-normand&quot; of 1870) were published, groups were formed and literary movements developed to support and promote the Oïl languages faced with competition. The Third Republic sought to modernise France and established primary education where the only language recognised was French. Regional languages were discouraged, and the use of French was seen as aspirational, accelerating their decline. This was also generally the case in areas where Oïl languages were spoken. French is now the best-known of the Oïl languages.

==Literature==
Besides the influence of French literature, small-scale literature has survived in the other Oïl languages. Theatrical writing is most notable in Picard (which maintains a genre of vernacular marionette theatre), Poitevin and Saintongeais. Oral performance (story-telling) is a feature of Gallo, for example, while Norman and Walloon literature, especially from the early 19th century tend to focus on written texts and poetry (see, for example, &quot;Wace&quot; and &quot;Jèrriais literature&quot;).

As the vernacular Oïl languages were displaced from towns, they have generally survived to a greater extent in rural areas - hence a preponderance of literature relating to rural and peasant themes. The particular circumstances of the self-governing Channel Islands developed a lively strain of political comment, and the early industrialisation in Picardy led to survival of Picard in the mines and workshops of the regions. The mining poets of Picardy may be compared with the tradition of rhyming Weaver Poets of Ulster Scots in a comparable industrial milieu.

There are some regional magazines, such as &quot;Ch&#x27;lanchron&quot; (Picard), &quot;Le Viquet&quot; (Norman), &quot;Les Nouvelles Chroniques du Don Balleine&quot; (Jèrriais), and &quot;El Bourdon&quot; (Walloon), which are published either wholly in the respective Oïl language or bilingually with French. These provide a platform for literary writing.

==Status==

Apart from French, an official language in many countries (see list), the Oïl languages have enjoyed little status in recent times.

Currently Walloon, Lorrain (under the local name of &quot;Gaumais&quot;), and Champenois have the status of regional languages of Wallonia.

The Norman languages of the Channel Islands enjoy a certain status under the governments of their Bailiwicks and within the regional and lesser-used language framework of the British-Irish Council. The Anglo-Norman language, a variant of Norman once the official language of England, today holds mostly a place of ceremonial honour in the United Kingdom (now referred to as &quot;Law French&quot;).

The French government recognises the Oïl languages as languages of France, but the Constitutional Council of France barred ratification of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.

==Influence==
The &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot; were more or less influenced by the native languages of the conquering Germanic tribes, notably the Franks. This was apparent not so much in the vocabulary (which remained overwhelmingly of Latin origin) as in the phonology and syntax; the invading Franks, Burgundians and Normans became the rulers and their accents were imposed as standard on the rest of the population. This accounts in large part for the relative distinctiveness of French compared to other Romance languages.
The English language was heavily influenced by contact with Norman following the Norman Conquest and much of the adopted vocabulary shows typically Norman features.

Portuguese was heavily influenced by more than a millennium of perennial contact with several dialects of both Oïl and Occitan language groups, in lexicon (up to 15–20% in some estimates, at least 5000 word roots), phonology and orthography. The influence of Occitan was, nevertheless, the most marked, through the status Provençal in particular achieved in southwestern Europe around the troubadour apex in the Middle Ages, when Galician-Portuguese lyric was developed. Aside the direct influence of Provençal literature, the presence of languages from modern-day France in the Galician-Portuguese area was also strong due to the rule of the House of Burgundy, the establishment of the Orders of Cluny and Cister, the many sections of the Way of St. James pilgrimage route that come from elsewhere in Europe out of the Iberian Peninsula, and the settlement in Iberia of people from the other side of the Pyrenees, arriving during and after the Reconquista.

The anti-Portuguese factor of Brazilian nationalism in the 19th century led to an increased use of the French language in detriment of Portuguese, as France was seen at the time as a model of civilization and progress. The learning of French has historically been important and strong among the Lusophone elites, and for a great span of time it was also the foreign language of choice among the middle class of both Portugal and Brazil, only surpassed in the globalised postmodernity by English.

The French spoken in Belgium shows some influence from Walloon. 

The development of French in North America was influenced by the speech of settlers originating from northwestern France, many of whom introduced features of their Oïl varieties into the French they spoke. (See also &quot;French language in the United States, French language in Canada&quot;)

*Anglic languages (Oïl influences on vocabulary, transmitted via the Anglo-Norman language spoken by the upper classes in England in the centuries following the Norman Conquest, and later from French)
*Portuguese (Oïl and Occitan influences on lexicon, phonology—especially European, Macanese and Europeanized Brazilian and African dialects—, and orthography)
*Franco-Italian, a mixed language of Old French and Venetian or Lombard used in literary works of northern Italy in the 13th and 14th centuries.

<text>Duhok (; ; , ) is a city in Kurdistan Region, Iraq. It is the capital city of Duhok Governorate.

== Name ==
The city of Duhok received its name from the Kurdish word ’du’ (two) and ’hok’ (lump) as a tax payment of two lumps from the basket of each passing caravan that often carry wheat and barley. According to a tradition presented by Sasson Nahum, Dohuk was initially named &quot;Dohuk-e Dasinya&quot;, signifying &quot;Dohuk of the Yezidis&quot;. However, after a massacre of the Yezidis, the town was abandoned, leading to the settlement of Kurdish Muslims, Assyrian Christians, and Jews in the area.

== Demographics ==
The city is home to diverse ethnic groups, including Kurds who are the majority, while other minorities include Assyrians, Yazidis and Arabs. The city also hosts tens of thousands of refugees from Syria, mostly Syrian Kurds, and internally displaced persons (IDPs), most of whom are Yazidis and Assyrians who fled after ISIS took control of Sinjar and Mosul, Iraq.

According to the Kurdistan Regional Government, as of March 2024, the Kurdistan Region hosts 631,174 IDPs, with 40% of them living in Duhok Governorate. Additionally, there are 251,475 Syrian refugees, of which 131,000 reside in Duhok Governorate.

== History ==

The city of Duhok has an ancient Assyrian and Hurrian history attached to it from the time of the Middle Assyrian Empire and Urartu and was originally Assyrian inhabited and called Nuhadra.

The city joined the Kurdish principality of Badinan sometime in the 13th or 14th centuries under the foundation of the Kurdish Hakkari tribe. As observed by Evliya Celebi in &quot;Seyahatnâme&quot; (Book of Travels), the principality was divided into: Akre, Zaxo, Shixoyi, Duhok, Zibari, and Muzuri.

=== Ottoman period ===
In 1820, Rich described Duhok as a small town comprising 300 houses, serving as the principal site for the Doski tribe, accompanied by eighty additional villages. The missionary Henry Aaron Stern (1851) observed Dohuk&#x27;s diverse population, which included Jewish residents. Stern further noted that the &quot;kiahya&quot;, or village mayor, was an Assyrian Christian of Chaldean Catholic affiliation. By 1859, Rabbi Yehiel found two &quot;minyans&quot; of Aramaic-speaking Jews in the area. The Muslim and Assyrian Christian communities comprised around a hundred households.

In 1929, the settled population reached approximately 3,500 inhabitants, with Kurds forming the majority. Among the 550 households, 65 were Assyrian Christian, and 30 were Jewish.

=== Modern times ===
The University of Duhok was founded on 31 October 1992.

== Archaeology ==
In 2020, researchers discovered in the Balyuz hills, ten kilometers west of Duhok City, an ancient tablet with Greek inscription which dates back to 165 B.C. The inscriptions refer to Demetrius, the region&#x27;s ruler during that time.

Seven kilometers southwest of Duhok, Halamata Cave is an archaeological site containing the Assyrian relief carvings known as the Maltai Reliefs, associated with the northern canal system built by the Assyrian king Sennacherib (r. 704–681 BCE) to carry water to his capital city of Nineveh&quot;.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system, Duhok, like most of Upper Mesopotamia, has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) featuring sweltering, virtually rainless summers and cool to cold, wet winters. Precipitation falls in the cooler months, being heaviest in late winter and early spring. The city can get around two or three snowy days yearly, with more severe falls in the uplands. Summers are virtually rainless, with rain returning in late autumn.

<doc id="566385" wikidata="Q1886338" url="?curid=566385" title="Makeover">
<text>A makeover is a radical change in appearance. When the word is used to describe a change in human physical appearance, it may imply a change in clothing, haircut, or cosmetics. A personal makeover might also include weight loss, plastic surgery, dental veneers, or contact lenses. Sometimes a makeover is used to refer to non-physical things, such as a makeover of character, personality or attitude. It can also refer to a dramatic change in construction, such as when a building is renovated or is refurbished. Makeovers are usually referred to in a positive manner, as a way to start fresh or improve your life.

== In media ==

=== Television ===
Makeovers are often popular television subjects. Long a staple subject of daytime talk shows, they have recently moved into the limelight in television shows such as &quot;Queer Eye&quot;. Other popular makeover shows include &quot;What Not to Wear&quot;, &quot;How to Look Good Naked&quot;, &quot;Plain Jane&quot;, &quot;Extreme Makeover&quot;, &quot;MADE&quot;, &quot;Ambush Makeover&quot; and &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot;. There is also a category of reality TV based on giving makeovers to homes, such as &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot;, &quot;60 Minute Makeover&quot; and &quot;Property Brothers&quot;.

See makeover reality television series.

Computer software and online tools can also be used for performing what are known as virtual makeovers. Using a photograph of a human face, software can apply cosmetics, hairstyles, and various eyewear such as contact lenses and sunglasses in order to allow users to visualize different looks without physically trying them on. Today, virtual makeup works in real-time using phone camera tracking, and examples are Visage Technologies&#x27;s MakeApp, L&#x27;Oréal&#x27;s Makeup Genius, and Oriflame&#x27;s Makeup Wizard.

=== Film ===

In film there is a trope of a character, usually a girl, undergoing a dramatic makeover in appearance or personality. Some examples include:
* &quot;Now, Voyager&quot; (1942)
* &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1950)
* &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1964)
* &quot;Grease&quot; (1978)
* &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; (1985)
* &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot; (1985)
* &quot;Moonstruck&quot; (1987)
* &quot;Clueless&quot; (1995)
* &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot; (1999)
* &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; (2000)
* &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; (2001)
* &quot;Mean Girls&quot; (2004)
* &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; (2006)
* &quot;The House Bunny&quot; (2008)

=== Books ===
There is also a series of books, aimed at teenage girls, called &quot;The Makeover Series&quot;, written by Suzanne Weyn. There are several experts who perform the art of makeovers. Usually makeover artists specialize in hair styling, make-up or clothing.

&quot;The Makeover Guy&quot; is a registered trademark for author and makeover expert Christopher Hopkins who is known for his television head-to-toe makeovers. He has a book called &quot;Staging Your Comeback: A Complete Beauty Revival for Women Over 45&quot;.

<text>City of London Freemen&#x27;s School (CLFS) is a co-educational private school for day and boarding pupils, located at Ashtead Park in Surrey, England. It is the sister school of the City of London School and the City of London School for Girls, which are both independent single-sex schools located within the City of London itself. All three schools receive funding from the City&#x27;s Cash. The school&#x27;s head is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference.

The &quot;Good Schools Guide&quot; described the school as &quot;A traditional academic and sporty school in a stunning setting with impressive facilities but not at all elitist – in fact quite the opposite.&quot; In 2024, 33% of grades in A Levels were A* and 72% of grades were A*-A. In GCSEs, 40% of grades were 9, 67% were 8-9 (equivalent to A*) and 86% achieved 9-7 in GCSEs.

== History ==

The school was founded in 1854 by the Corporation of London, and was originally located in Brixton, London to educate orphans of freemen of the city. It is still possible for such children to be educated as &quot;Foundationers&quot; at the school with the costs of their education borne by the City of London Corporation. The school is set in of Ashtead Park in Surrey, having moved from Brixton to Ashtead in 1926.

== Boarding house ==

The boarding house is next to Main House and the junior school.

== Old Freemen&#x27;s ==
Once pupils leave school they become part of &quot;Old Freemen’s Association&quot;, which includes the Old Freemen&#x27;s Rugby Football Club, Cricket Club and Hockey Club. There is also a Guild of Scholars of the City of London, which was formed to encourage former pupils from the three ‘City schools’ to develop links with the City of London. Membership is open to all former pupils, staff, and retired staff, who must have obtained their ‘Freedom of the City of London’ but there is no subscription.

In addition any pupil aged 14–17 who is still at school may apply to become an apprentice to a Freeman of the City. They will then be entitled, at the age of 21, to apply for the Freedom of the City and membership of the Guild of Scholars.

<text>A piconet is an ad hoc network that links a wireless user group of devices using Bluetooth technology protocols. A piconet consists of two or more devices occupying the same physical channel (synchronized to a common clock and hopping sequence). It allows one &quot;master&quot; device to interconnect with up to seven active &quot;slave&quot; devices. Up to 255 further slave devices can be inactive, or &quot;parked&quot;, which the master device can bring into active status at any time, but an active station must go into parked first.

Some examples of piconets include a cell phone connected to a computer, a laptop and a Bluetooth-enabled digital camera, or several PDAs that are connected to each other.

==Overview==
A group of devices are connected via Bluetooth technology in an ad hoc fashion. A piconet starts with two connected devices, and may grow to eight connected devices. Bluetooth communication always designates one of the Bluetooth devices as a main controlling unit or &quot;master&quot; unit. Other devices that follow the master unit are &quot;slave&quot; units. This allows the Bluetooth system to be non-contention based (no collisions). This means that after a Bluetooth device has been added to the piconet, each device is assigned a specific time period to transmit and they do not collide or overlap with other units operating within the same piconet.

Piconet range varies according to the class of the Bluetooth device. Data transfer rates vary between about 200 and 2100 kilobits per second.

Because the Bluetooth system hops over 79 channels, the probability of interfering with another Bluetooth system is less than 1.5%. This allows several Bluetooth piconets to operate in the same area at the same time with minimal interference.

<text>The saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) is a crocodilian native to saltwater habitats, brackish wetlands and freshwater rivers from India&#x27;s east coast across Southeast Asia and the Sundaland to northern Australia and Micronesia. It has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 1996. It was hunted for its skin throughout its range up to the 1970s, and is threatened by illegal killing and habitat loss. It is regarded as dangerous to humans.

The saltwater crocodile is the largest living reptile. Males can grow up to a weight of and a length of , rarely exceeding . Females are much smaller and rarely surpass . It is also called the estuarine crocodile, Indo-Pacific crocodile, marine crocodile, sea crocodile, and, informally, the saltie. A large and opportunistic hypercarnivorous apex predator, they ambush most of their prey and then drown or swallow it whole. They will prey on almost any animal that enters their territory, including other predators such as sharks, varieties of freshwater and saltwater fish including pelagic species, invertebrates such as crustaceans, various amphibians, other reptiles, birds, and mammals.

== Taxonomy and evolution ==

&quot;Crocodilus porosus&quot; was the scientific name proposed by Johann Gottlob Theaenus Schneider who described a zoological specimen in 1801. In the 19th and 20th centuries, several saltwater crocodile specimens were described with the following names:
*&quot;Crocodilus biporcatus&quot; proposed by Georges Cuvier in 1807 were 23 saltwater crocodile specimens from India, Java and Timor.
*&quot;Crocodilus biporcatus raninus&quot; proposed by Salomon Müller and Hermann Schlegel in 1844 was a crocodile from Borneo.
*&quot;Crocodylus porosus australis&quot; proposed by Paulus Edward Pieris Deraniyagala in 1953 was a specimen from Australia.
*&quot;Crocodylus pethericki&quot; proposed by Richard Wells and C. Ross Wellington in 1985 was a large-bodied, relatively large-headed and short-tailed crocodile specimen collected in 1979 in the Finnis River, Northern Territory. This purported species was later considered to be a misinterpretation of the physiological changes that very large male crocodiles undergo. However, Wells and Wellington&#x27;s assertion that the Australian saltwater crocodiles may be distinctive enough from northern Asian saltwater crocodiles to warrant subspecies status, as could &quot;raninus&quot; from other Asian saltwater crocodiles, has been considered to possibly bear validity. 

Currently, the saltwater crocodile is considered a monotypic species.

=== Evolution ===
Fossil remains of a saltwater crocodile excavated in northern Queensland were dated to the Pliocene. The saltwater crocodile&#x27;s closest extant (living) relatives are the Siamese crocodile and the mugger crocodile.

The genus &quot;Crocodylus&quot; was thought to have evolved in Australia and Asia. Results of a phylogenetic study supports its likely origin in Africa and later radiation towards Southeast Asia and the Americas; it genetically diverged from its closest recent relative, the extinct &quot;Voay&quot; of Madagascar, around near the boundary between the Oligocene and Miocene.

===Phylogeny===
Below is a cladogram based on a 2018 tip dating study by Lee &amp; Yates simultaneously using morphological, molecular (DNA sequencing), and stratigraphic (fossil age) data, as revised in 2021 after a paleogenomics study using DNA extracted from the extinct &quot;Voay&quot;.
==Description==
The saltwater crocodile has a wide snout compared to most crocodiles. However, it has a longer snout than the mugger crocodile (&quot;C. palustris&quot;); its length is twice its width at the base. A pair of ridges runs from the eyes along the centre of the snout. The scales are oval in shape and the scutes are either small compared to other species or commonly are entirely absent. In addition, an obvious gap is also present between the cervical and dorsal shields, and small, triangular scutes are present between the posterior edges of the large, transversely arranged scutes in the dorsal shield. The relative lack of scutes is considered an asset useful to distinguish saltwater crocodiles in captivity or in illicit leather trading, as well as in the few areas in the field where sub-adult or younger saltwater crocodiles may need to be distinguished from other crocodiles. It has fewer armour plates on its neck than other crocodilians.

The adult saltwater crocodile&#x27;s broad body contrasts with that of most other lean crocodiles, leading to early unverified assumptions the reptile was an alligator.

Young saltwater crocodiles are pale yellow in colour with black stripes and spots on their bodies and tails. This colouration lasts for several years until the crocodiles mature into adults. The colour as an adult is much darker greenish-drab, with a few lighter tan or grey areas sometimes apparent. Several colour variations are known and some adults may retain fairly pale skin, whereas others may be so dark as to appear blackish. The ventral surface is white or yellow in colour in saltwater crocodiles of all ages. Stripes are present on the lower sides of their bodies, but do not extend onto their bellies. Their tails are grey with dark bands.

===Size===
The weight of a crocodile increases approximately cubically as length increases (see square–cube law). This explains why individuals at weigh more than twice as much as individuals at . In crocodiles, linear growth eventually decreases and they start getting bulkier at a certain point.

Saltwater crocodiles are the largest extant riparian predators in the world. However, they start life fairly small. Newly hatched saltwater crocodiles measure about long and weigh an average of . These sizes and ages are almost identical to those at average sexual maturity in Nile crocodiles, despite the fact that average adult male saltwater crocodiles are considerably larger than average adult male Nile crocodiles.

The largest skull of a saltwater crocodile that could be scientifically verified was of a specimen in the Muséum national d&#x27;Histoire naturelle, collected in Cambodia. Its skull was long and wide near its base, with long mandibles; its length is not known, but based on skull-to-length ratios of large saltwater crocodiles its length was presumably in the range, though it could have had an exceptionally large skull or may not have the same skull-to-total-length ratios as other large saltwater crocodiles. If detached from the body, the head of a large male crocodile can weigh over , including the large muscles and tendons at the base of the skull that lend the crocodile its massive biting strength. The largest tooth measured in length.
Other crocodilians like the gharial (&quot;Gavialis gangeticus&quot;) and the false gharial (&quot;Tomistoma schlegelii&quot;) have a proportionately longer skull, but both their skulls and their bodies are less massive than in the saltwater crocodile.

==== Male size ====
An adult male saltwater crocodile, from young adults to older individuals, typically ranges in length and weighs . On average, adult males range in length and weigh . However average size largely depends on the location, habitat, and human interactions and thus varies from one study to another. In 1993, in a study conducted (published in 1998), eleven saltwater crocodiles were found to have measured and weighed between . Very large, aged males can exceed in length and presumably weigh up to .

The largest confirmed saltwater crocodile on record drowned in a fishing net in Papua New Guinea, in 1979. Its dried skin plus head measured in length and it was estimated to have been when accounting for shrinkage and a missing tail tip. Projected from their skull lengths, multiple specimens from Singapore were estimated to belong in life to male crocodiles measuring more than . A large Vietnamese saltwater crocodile was reliably estimated, based on its skull after its death, at . However, according to evidence in the form of skulls coming from some of the largest crocodiles ever shot, the maximum possible size attained by the largest members of this species is considered to be . A governmental study from Australia accepts that the very largest members of the species are likely to measure in length and weigh . Furthermore, a research paper on the morphology and physiology of crocodilians by the same organisation estimates that saltwater crocodiles reaching sizes of would weigh around . Due to the extreme size and highly aggressive nature of the species, weight in larger specimens is frequently poorly documented. A long individual named &quot;Sweetheart&quot; was found to have weighed . Another large crocodile named &quot;Gomek&quot;, measuring in length weighed around . In 1992, a notorious man-eater, named &quot;Bujang Senang&quot; was killed in Sarawak, Malaysia. It measured in length and weighed more than . A saltwater–siamese hybrid named &quot;Yai&quot; (, meaning big; born 10 June 1972) at the Samutprakarn Crocodile Farm and Zoo, Thailand was claimed to be the largest crocodile ever held in captivity. It measured in length and weighed approximately . In 1962, a large male saltwater crocodile was shot in Adelaide River, Northern Territory. It was recorded to be long and weighed . A large male in the Philippines, named Lolong, was one of the largest saltwater crocodile ever caught and placed in captivity. He was long and weighed . Following his death in 2013, the largest living crocodile in captivity was &quot;Cassius&quot;, who was kept at Marineland Crocodile Park, a zoo located at Green Island, Queensland, Australia. He measured 5.48 m (18 ft 0 in) in length and weighed approximately 1,300 kg (2,870 lb) before his own death in November 2024. 

====Female size====
Adult females typically measure from in total length and weigh . Large mature females reach and weigh up to . The largest female on record measured about in total length. Female are thus similar in size to other species of large crocodiles and average slightly smaller than females of some other species, like the Nile crocodile. The saltwater crocodile has the greatest size sexual dimorphism, by far, of any extant crocodilian, as males average about 4 to 5 times as massive as adult females and can sometimes measure twice her total length. The reason for the male skewered dimorphism in this species is not definitively known but might be correlated with sex-specific territoriality and the need for adult male saltwater crocodiles to monopolise large stretches of habitat. Due to the extreme sexual dimorphism of the species as contrasted with the more modest-sized dimorphism of other species, the average length of the species is only slightly more than some other extant crocodilians at .

==Distribution and habitat==

The saltwater crocodile inhabits coastal brackish mangrove swamps, river deltas and freshwater rivers from India&#x27;s east coast, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh to Myanmar, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, Philippines, Timor Leste, Palau, Solomon Islands, Singapore, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and Australia&#x27;s north coast. The southernmost population in India lives in Odisha&#x27;s Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary; in northern Odisha, it has not been recorded since the 1930s. It occurs along the Andaman and Nicobar Islands coasts and in the Sundarbans. In Sri Lanka, it occurs foremost in western and southern parts of the country.

In Myanmar, it inhabits the Ayeyarwady Delta.
In southern Thailand, it was recorded in Phang Nga Province.
In Singapore, it inhabits the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve and marshes near Kranji and Mandai. It is locally extinct in Cambodia, China, Seychelles, Thailand and Vietnam.

In China, it may have once inhabited coastal areas from Fujian province in the north to the border of Vietnam. References to crocodile attacks on humans and livestock during the Han and Song dynasties indicate that until the 18th century, it may have occurred in lower Pearl River and Macau, Han River, Min River, portions of coastal Guangxi province and Hainan Island.

Three historical records of saltwater crocodiles being found in Japanese coastal waters exist; an individual was found off the coast of Iwo Jima in 1744, another was found off Amami Ōshima in 1800, and finally, a third individual was caught by fishermen in Toyama Bay in 1932. All other occurrences of the species being present within Japanese territory are from World War II, and were found in areas that were formerly controlled by the Empire of Japan.

In Malaysia, it was recorded in Klias, Segama and Kinabatangan Rivers in Sabah. In Sarawak, it was recorded by a camera trap in Kuching Wetlands National Park. In the Lesser Sunda Islands, it is present along the coasts of Sumba, Lembata Island, Flores, Menipo, Rote Island, and Timor. Its status along Alor Island is unknown, where one individual was captured in the 2010s. In the Maluku Islands, it is present around the Kai Islands, the Aru Islands, and many other islands in the region, including the Torres Strait Islands. In Papua New Guinea, it is common within the coastal reaches of every river system, such as the Fly River and in the Bismarck Archipelago.
In the Philippines, it occurs in a few coastal sites like eastern Luzon, Palawan, the Liguasan Marsh, and Agusan River on Mindanao.
In northern Australia, the saltwater crocodile is thriving, particularly in the multiple river systems near Darwin such as the Adelaide, Mary, and Daly Rivers, along with their adjacent billabongs and estuaries. The saltwater crocodile population in Australia is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000 adults. Its range extends from Broome, Western Australia through the entire Northern Territory coast all the way south to Rockhampton, Queensland. The Alligator Rivers in the Arnhem Land region are misnamed due to the resemblance of the saltwater crocodile to alligators as compared to freshwater crocodiles, which also inhabit the Northern Territory.

Because of its ability to swim long distances at sea, individual saltwater crocodiles appeared occasionally in areas far away from their general range, up to Fiji.
Saltwater crocodiles generally spend the tropical wet season in freshwater swamps and rivers, moving downstream to estuaries in the dry season. Crocodiles compete fiercely with each other for territory, with dominant males in particular occupying the most eligible stretches of freshwater creeks and streams. Junior crocodiles are thus forced into marginal river systems and sometimes into the ocean. This explains the large distribution of the species, as well as its being found in the odd places on occasion such as the Sea of Japan. Like all crocodiles, they can survive for prolonged periods in only warm temperatures, and crocodiles seasonally vacate parts of Australia if cold spells hit.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The primary behaviour to distinguish the saltwater crocodile from other crocodiles is its tendency to occupy salt water. Though other crocodiles also have salt glands that enable them to survive in saltwater, a trait that alligators do not possess, most other species do not venture out to sea except during extreme conditions.

Saltwater crocodiles use ocean currents to travel long distances. In Australia, 20 crocodiles were tagged with satellite transmitters; 8 of them ventured out into open ocean, and one of them traveled along the coast in 25 days from the North Kennedy River on the eastern coast of Far North Queensland, around Cape York Peninsula, to the west coast in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Another individual swam in 20 days. Without having to move around much, sometimes simply by floating, the current-riding behaviour allows for the conservation of energy. They interrupted their movements and resided in sheltered bays for a few days until the current changed direction. Sometimes, they also swam up and down river systems.
Generally very lethargic, a trait that helps it survive months at a time without food, the saltwater crocodile will usually loiter in the water or bask in the sun during much of the day, preferring to hunt at night. A study of seasonal saltwater crocodile behaviour in Australia indicated that they are more active and more likely to spend time in the water during the Australian summer; conversely, they are less active and spend relatively more time basking in the sun during the winter. Saltwater crocodiles, however, are among the most active of all crocodilians, spending more time cruising and active, especially in water. They are much less terrestrial than most species of crocodiles, spending less time on land except for basking. At times, they tend to spend weeks at sea in search of land and in some cases, barnacles have been observed growing on crocodile scales, indicative of the long periods they spend at sea.

While crocodilian brains are much smaller than those of mammals (as low as 0.05% of body weight in the saltwater crocodile), saltwater crocodiles are capable of learning difficult tasks with very little conditioning, learning to track the migratory route of their prey as the seasons change, and may possess a deeper communication ability than currently accepted.

===Hunting and diet===
Like most species in the crocodilian family, saltwater crocodiles are not fastidious in their choice of food, and readily vary their prey selection according to availability. Nor are they voracious, as they are able to survive on relatively little food for a prolonged period. Because of their size and distribution, saltwater crocodiles hunt the broadest range of prey species of any modern crocodilian. The diet of hatchling, juvenile, and subadult saltwater crocodiles has been subject to extensively greater scientific study than that of fully-grown crocodiles, in large part due to the aggression, territoriality, and size of adults that make them difficult for biologists to handle without significant risk to safety, for both humans and the crocodiles themselves. The main method used for capturing adult saltwater crocodiles is a huge pole with large hooks, meant for shark capture, that restrict the crocodile&#x27;s jaws, but these can cause damage to their snouts; and even this is unproven to allow successful capture for crocodiles in excess of . While for example 20th century biological studies rigorously cataloged the stomach contents of &quot;sacrificed&quot; adult Nile crocodiles in Africa, few such studies were done on behalf of saltwater crocodiles despite the plethora that were slaughtered due to the leather trade during that time period. Therefore, the diet of adults is more likely to be based on reliable eye-witness accounts. Hatchlings are restricted to feeding on smaller animals, such as small fish, frogs, insects and small aquatic invertebrates. In addition to these prey, juveniles also take a variety of freshwater and saltwater fish, various amphibians, crustaceans, molluscs, such as large gastropods and cephalopods, birds, small to medium-sized mammals, and other reptiles, such as snakes and lizards. When crocodiles obtain a length of more than , the significance of small invertebrate prey fades in favour of small vertebrates, including fish and smaller mammals and birds.
Among crustacean prey, large mud crabs of the genus &quot;Scylla&quot; are frequently consumed, especially in mangrove habitats. Ground-living birds, such as the emu and different kinds of water birds, especially the magpie goose, are the most commonly preyed upon birds, due to the increased chance of encounter. Even swift-flying birds and bats may be snatched if close to the surface of water, as well as wading birds while these are patrolling the shore looking for food, even down to the size of a common sandpiper. Mammalian prey of juveniles and subadults are usually as large as the smaller species of ungulates, such as the greater mouse-deer (&quot;Tragulus napu&quot;) and hog deer (&quot;Hyelaphus porcinus&quot;). Prey species recorded include primate species such as crab-eating macaques, proboscis monkeys, and gibbons. It preys on agile wallabies, golden jackals, viverrids, turtles, flying foxes, hares, rodents, badgers, otters, chevrotains and pangolins. A rare incidence of an adult long saltwater crocodile preying on an Indian porcupine was reported in Sri Lanka. Unlike fish, crabs and aquatic creatures, mammals and birds are usually found only sporadically in or next to water; so crocodiles seem to search for places where such prey may be concentrated, e.g. the water under a tree holding a flying fox colony, or spots where herds of water buffaloes feed, in order to capture small animals disturbed by the buffalo or (if a large adult crocodile is hunting) weaker members of the buffalo herd.

Studies have shown that, unlike freshwater crocodiles (which can easily die from eating poisonous toads), saltwater crocodiles are partially resistant to cane toad toxins and can consume them, but in only small quantities and not enough to provide effective natural control for this virulent introduced pest. Large crocodiles, even the oldest males, do not ignore small species, especially those without developed escape abilities, when the opportunity arises. On the other hand, sub-adult saltwater crocodiles weighing only (and measuring ) have been recorded killing and eating goats weighing 50 to 92% of their own body mass in Orissa, India, and so are capable of attacking large prey from an early age. It was found that the diet of specimens in juvenile to subadult range, since they feed on any animals up to their own size practically no matter how small, was more diverse than that of adults, which often ignored all prey below a certain size limit.

Large animals taken by adult saltwater crocodiles include sambar deer, wild boar, Malayan tapirs, kangaroos, feral pigs, humans, orangutans, dingos, tigers, and large bovines, such as banteng, water buffalo, and gaur. However, larger animals are taken only sporadically because only large males typically attack very large prey, and large ungulates and other sizeable wild mammals are only sparsely distributed in this species&#x27; range, outside of a few key areas such as the Sundarbans. Off-setting this, goats, water buffalo and wild boar/pigs have been introduced to many of the areas occupied by saltwater crocodiles and returned to feral states to varying degrees, and thus can amply support large crocodiles. In Australia, the saltwater crocodile&#x27;s taste for feral pigs and buffalo was a key factor in their recovery for hunting pressures over the last fifty years according to studies published in 2022 by Dr. Marianna Campbell &quot;et al.,&quot;. Isotopes taken from the bones of crocodiles collected over five decades ago when crocodiles populations were low and comparisons to specimens from modern populations suggest that initially, Australian saltwater crocodiles subsisted on a more estuarine diet, and both hunting pressures by humans and a reduction in aquatic prey in places like the Top End resulted in a dietary switch to more terrestrial prey that allowed them to grow and recover more rapidly from population declines. Any type of livestock, such as chicken, sheep, pigs, horses and cattle, and domesticated animals/pets may be eaten if given the opportunity. As a seagoing species, the saltwater crocodile also preys on a variety of saltwater bony fish and other marine animals, including sea snakes, sea turtles, sea birds, dugongs, rays (including large sawfish), and small sharks. Most witnessed acts of predation on marine animals have occurred in coastal waters or within sight of land, with female sea turtles and their babies caught during mating season when the turtles are closer to shore, and bull sharks being the only largish shark with a strong propensity to patrol brackish and fresh waters. However, there is evidence that saltwater crocodiles do hunt while out in the open seas, based upon the remains of pelagic fishes that dwell only miles away from land being found in their stomachs.

The hunting methods utilised by saltwater crocodiles are indistinct from any other crocodilian, with the hunting crocodile submerging and quietly swimming over to the prey before pouncing upwards, striking suddenly. Unlike some other crocodilians, such as American alligators and even Nile crocodiles, they are not known to have hunted on dry land. Young saltwater crocodiles are capable of breaching their entire body into the air in a single upward motion while hunting prey that may be perched on low hanging branches. While hunting rhesus macaques, they have been seen to knock the monkeys off a bank by knocking them with their tail, forcing the macaque into water for easy consumption. However, whether tail use in hunting is intentional or just an accidental benefit is not definitely clear. As with other crocodilians, their sharp, peg-like teeth are well-suited to seize and tightly grip prey, but not to shear flesh. Small prey are simply swallowed whole, while larger animals are dragged into deep water and drowned or crushed. Large prey is then torn into manageable pieces by &quot;death rolling&quot;, the spinning of the crocodile to twist off hunks of meat or by sudden jerks of the head. Occasionally, food items will be stored for later consumption once a crocodile eats its fill, although this can lead to scavenging by interlopers such as monitor lizards.

====Bite====
Saltwater crocodiles have the strongest bite of any living animal. A saltwater crocodile has been confirmed as having the highest bite force quotient ever recorded for an animal in a laboratory setting, with a value of surpassing the previous record of made by an American alligator (&quot;Alligator mississippiensis&quot;). Based on the regression of mean body mass and mean bite force, the bite forces of multiple crocodile species, individuals were estimated at . The extraordinary bite of crocodilians is a result of their anatomy. The space for the jaw muscle in the skull is very large, which is easily visible from the outside as a bulge at each side. The nature of the muscle is extremely stiff, almost as hard as bone to the touch, such that it can appear to be a continuation of the skull. Another trait is that most of the muscle in a crocodile&#x27;s jaw is arranged for clamping down. Despite the strong muscles to close the jaw, crocodiles have extremely small and weak muscles to open the jaw. The jaws of a crocodile can be securely shut with several layers of duct tape.

===Reproduction===
Males reach sexual maturity around at around 16 years of age, while females reach sexual maturity at and 12–14 years of age.
Saltwater crocodiles mate in the wet season, when water levels are at their highest. In Australia, the male and female engage in courtship in September and October, and the female lays eggs between November and March. It is possible the rising temperatures of the wet season provoke reproductive behaviour in this species. While crocodilians generally nest every year, there have been several recorded cases of female saltwater crocodiles nesting only every other year and also records of a female attempting to produce two broods in a single wet season. The female selects the nesting site, and both parents will defend the nesting territory, which is typically a stretch of shore along tidal rivers or freshwater areas, especially swamps. Nests are often in a surprisingly exposed location, often in mud with little to no vegetation around, and thus limited protection from the sun and wind. The nest is a mound of mud and vegetation, usually measuring long and high, with an entrance averaging in diameter. Some nests in unlikely habitats have occurred, such as rocky rubble or in a damp low-grass field. The female crocodile usually scratches a layer of leaves and other debris around the nest entrance and this covering is reported to produce an &quot;astonishing&quot; amount of warmth for the eggs (coincidentally these nesting habits are similar to those of the birds known as megapodes that nest in upland areas of the same Australasian regions where saltwater crocodiles are found).

The female typically lays from 40 to 60 eggs, but some clutches have included up to 90. The eggs measure on average and weigh on average in Australia and in India. These are relatively small, as the average female saltwater crocodile weighs around five times as much as a freshwater crocodile, but lays eggs that are only about 20% larger in measurement and 40% heavier than those of the smaller species. The average weight of a new hatchling in Australia is reportedly . Although the female guards the nest for 80 to 98 days (in extreme high and low cases from 75 to 106 days), the loss of eggs is often high due to flooding and occasionally to predation. As in all crocodilians, the sex of the hatchlings is determined by temperature. At 28–30 degrees all hatchlings will be female, at 30–32 degrees 86% of hatchlings are male, and at 33 or more degrees predominantly female (84%). In Australia, goannas (&quot;Varanus giganteus&quot;) commonly eat freshwater crocodile eggs (feeding on up to 95% of the clutch if discovered), but are relatively unlikely to eat saltwater crocodile eggs due to the vigilance of the imposing mother, with about 25% of the eggs being lost to goannas (less than half as many Nile crocodile eggs are estimated to be eaten by monitors in Africa). A majority of the loss of eggs of saltwater crocodiles occurs due to flooding of the nest hole.

As in most crocodilian species, the female saltwater crocodile exhibits a remarkable level of maternal care for a reptile. She excavates the nest in response to &quot;yelping&quot; calls from the hatchlings, and even gently rolls eggs in her mouth to assist hatching. The female will then carry the hatchlings to water in her mouth (as Nile crocodile and American alligator females have been observed doing when their eggs hatch) and remains with the young for several months. Despite her diligence, losses of baby crocodiles are heavy due to various predators and unrelated crocodiles of their own species. Only approximately 1% of the hatchlings will survive to adulthood. By crocodilian standards, saltwater crocodile hatchlings are exceptionally aggressive to one another and will often fight almost immediately after being transported to water by their mother. The young naturally start to disperse after around 8 months, and start to exhibit territorial behaviour at around 2.5 years old. They are the most territorial of extant crocodilians and, due to their aggressiveness to conspecifics, from the dispersed immature stage on, they are never seen in concentrations or loose groups as are most other crocodilians. However, even females will not reach proper sexual maturity for another 10 years. Saltwater crocodiles that survive to adulthood can attain a very long maximum life span, with an estimated life expectancy upwards of 70 years, and some individuals possibly exceed 100 years, although no such extreme ages have been verified for any crocodilian.

While adults have no natural predators, baby saltwater crocodiles may fall prey to monitor lizards (occasionally, but not commonly, the numerous goanna in Australia, and the Asian water monitor (&quot;Varanus salvator&quot;) further north), predatory fish (especially the barramundi (&quot;Lates calcarifer&quot;)), wild boars, rats, various aquatic and raptorial birds (e.g. black-necked storks (&quot;Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus&quot;) and white-bellied sea eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus leucogaster&quot;)), pythons, larger crocodiles, and many other predators. Pigs and cattle also occasionally inadvertently trample eggs and nests on occasion and degrade habitat quality where found in numbers. Juveniles may also fall prey to tigers and leopards (&quot;Panthera pardus&quot;) in certain parts of their range, although encounters between these predators are rare, and cats are likely to avoid areas with saltwater crocodiles.

==Conservation status==

The species is considered of minimal concern for extinction but is protected from the effects of international trade under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) as follows:
* Appendix I (prohibiting all commercial trade in the species or its parts/derivatives): All wild populations except for those of Australia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea;
* Appendix II (commercial trade allowed with export permit; import permits may or may not be required depending on the laws of the importing country): Australia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea wild populations, plus all worldwide populations bred in captivity for commercial purposes.

The saltwater crocodile was often hunted for its meat and eggs, and its skin is the most commercially valuable of any crocodilian. Unregulated hunting during the 20th century caused a dramatic decline in the species throughout its range, with the population in northern Australia reduced by 95% by 1971. The years from 1940 to 1970 were the peak of unregulated hunting and may have regionally caused irreparable damage to saltwater crocodile populations. The species currently has full legal protection in all Australian states and territories where it is found – Western Australia (since 1970), Northern Territory (since 1971) and Queensland (since 1974). Illegal hunting still persists in some areas, with protection in some countries being grossly ineffective, and trade is often difficult to monitor and control over such a vast range. However, many areas have not recovered; some population surveys have shown that although young crocodiles are present, fewer than 10% of specimens spotted are in adult size range and do not include any particularly large males, such as Sri Lanka or Palau. This is indicative of both potential continued persecution and exploitation and a non-recovered breeding population. In a more balanced population, such as those from Bhitarkanika National Park or Sabah on Borneo, 28% and 24.2% of specimens observed were in the adult size range of more than .

Habitat loss continues to be a major problem for the species. In northern Australia, much of the nesting habitat of the saltwater crocodile is susceptible to trampling by feral water buffalo, although buffalo eradication programs have now reduced this problem considerably. Even where large areas of suitable habitat remain, subtle habitat alterations can be a problem, such as in the Andaman Islands, where freshwater areas, used for nesting, are being increasingly converted to human agriculture. After the commercial value of crocodile skins waned, perhaps the greatest immediate challenge to implementing conservation efforts has been the occasional danger the species can pose to humans, and the resulting negative view of the crocodile.

==Relationship with humans==

===Attacks on humans===

Of all the crocodilians, the saltwater crocodile and Nile crocodile have the strongest tendencies to treat humans as prey. The saltwater crocodile has a long history of attacking humans who unknowingly venture into its territory. As a result of its power, intimidating size and speed, survival of a direct predatory attack is unlikely if the crocodile is able to make direct contact. In contrast to alligators where a degree of coexistence may be the policy, the only recommended policy for dealing with saltwater crocodiles is to completely avoid their habitat whenever possible, as they are exceedingly aggressive when encroached upon.

Exact data on attacks are limited outside Australia, where one or two fatal attacks are reported per year. From 1971 to 2013, the total number of fatalities reported in Australia due to saltwater crocodile attack was 106. The low level of attacks may be due to extensive efforts by wildlife officials in Australia to post crocodile warning signs at numerous at-risk billabongs, rivers, lakes and beaches. Less-publicised attacks have been reported in Borneo, Sumatra, Eastern India (Andaman Islands), and Burma. In Sarawak, Borneo, the average number of fatal attacks is reportedly 2.8 annually for the years from 2000 to 2003. In the Northern Territory in Australia, attempts have been made to relocate saltwater crocodiles who have displayed aggressive behaviour towards humans but these have proven ineffective as the problem crocodiles are apparently able to find their way back to their original territories. In the Darwin area from 2007 to 2009, 67–78% of &quot;problem crocodiles&quot; were identified as males.

Many attacks in areas outside Australia are believed to go unreported, with one study positing up to 20 to 30 attacks occur every year. This number may be conservative in light of several areas where humans and saltwater crocodiles co-exist in relatively undeveloped, low-economy and rural regions, where attacks are likely to go unreported. However, claims in the past that saltwater crocodiles are responsible for thousands of human fatalities annually are likely to have been exaggerations and were probably falsified to benefit leather companies, hunting organisations and other sources that may have benefited from maximising the negative perception of crocodiles for financial gain. Despite their reputations, many wild saltwater crocodiles are normally quite wary of humans and will go out of their way to submerge and swim away from them, even large adult males, if previously subject to harassment or persecution. Some attacks on humans appear to be territorial rather than predatory in nature, with crocodiles over two years in age often attacking anything that comes into their area (including boats). Humans can usually escape alive from such encounters, which comprise about half of all attacks. Non-fatal attacks usually involve crocodiles of or less in length. Fatal attacks, more likely to be predatory in motivation, commonly involve larger crocodiles with an average estimated size of . Under normal circumstances, Nile crocodiles are believed to be responsible for a considerably greater number of fatal attacks on humans than saltwater crocodiles, but this may have more to do with the fact that many people in Africa tend to rely on riparian areas for their livelihood, which is less prevalent in most of Asia and certainly less so in Australia. In the Andaman Islands, the number of fatal attacks on humans has reportedly increased, possibly due to habitat destruction and reduction of natural prey.

During the Japanese retreat in the Battle of Ramree Island on 19 February 1945, saltwater crocodiles may have been responsible for the deaths of over 400 Japanese soldiers. British soldiers encircled the swampland through which the Japanese were retreating, condemning the Japanese to a night in the mangroves, which were home to thousands of saltwater crocodiles. Many Japanese soldiers did not survive this night, but the attribution of the majority of their deaths to crocodile attacks has been doubted. Another reported mass attack involved a cruise in eastern India where a boat accident forced 28 people into the water where they were reportedly consumed by saltwater crocodiles. Another notorious crocodile attack was in 1985, on ecofeminist Val Plumwood, who survived the attack and learned that the advice she had received that crocodiles do not attack canoes was inaccurate.

In July 2018, a 600-strong mob slaughtered 292 saltwater and New Guinea crocodiles in Papua province in Indonesia in a revenge attack after a man who encroached upon the sanctuary was devoured.

===Cultural references===

The saltwater crocodile is considered holy on Timor. According to legend, the island was formed by a giant crocodile. The Papuan people have a similar and very involved myth and traditionally the crocodile was described as a relative (normally a father or grandfather).

According to Wondjina, the mythology of Indigenous Australians, the saltwater crocodile was banished from the fresh water for becoming full of bad spirits and growing too large, unlike the freshwater crocodile, which was somewhat revered. Aboriginal rock art depicting the saltwater crocodile is rare, although examples of up to 3,000 years old were found in caves in Kakadu and Arnhem land, roughly matching the distribution of the species. It is however depicted in contemporary aboriginal art.
The Larrakia people think of themselves as crocodile descendants, and regard it as their totem. They respect crocodiles as protectors of harbours and do not eat crocodile meat.

The species is featured on several postage stamps, including an 1894 State of North Borneo 12-cent stamp; a 1948 Australian 2 shilling stamp depicting an aboriginal rock artwork of the species; a 1966 Republic of Indonesia stamp; a 1994 Palau 20-cent stamp; a 1997 Australian 22-cent stamp; and a 2005 1 Malaysian ringgit postage stamp.

The saltwater crocodile has featured in contemporary Australian film and television including the &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; series of films, horror films &quot;Black Water&quot; and &quot;Rogue&quot; and &quot;The Crocodile Hunter&quot; television series. There are now several saltwater crocodile–themed parks in Australia.

===Examples of large unconfirmed saltwater crocodiles===
The largest size recorded for a saltwater crocodile has always been a subject of considerable controversy. The reason behind unverified sizes is either the case of insufficient/inconclusive data or exaggeration from a folkloric point of view. This section is dedicated to examples of the largest saltwater crocodiles recorded outside scientific norms measurement and estimation, with the aim of satisfying the public interest without creating data pollution, as well as serving an educational purpose of guiding the reader to separate fact from possible fiction. Below, in descending order starting from the largest, are some examples of large unconfirmed saltwater crocodiles, recorded throughout history.

* A crocodile shot in the Bay of Bengal in 1840 was reported at . Furthermore, this specimen was claimed to have a belly girth of and a body mass estimated . However, the skull of this specimen was examined by Guinness Records and found to be only in length, indicating the above size was considerably exaggerated and the animal would have probably measured no more than .
* James R. Montgomery, who ran a plantation near to the Lower Kinabatangan Segama Wetlands in Borneo from 1926 to 1932, claimed to have netted, killed, and examined numerous crocodiles well over there, including a specimen he claims measured . However, no one scientifically confirmed any of Montgomery&#x27;s specimens and no voucher specimens are known.
* A crocodile shot in Queensland in 1957, nicknamed Krys the croc (named after the woman that shot the crocodile in July 1957; Krystina Pawlowski), was reported to be long, but no verified measurements were made and no remains of this crocodile exist. A &quot;replica&quot; of this crocodile has been made as a tourist attraction.
* A crocodile killed in 1823 at Jalajala on the main island of Luzon in the Philippines was reported at . However the skull of the specimen is long indicating an animal of approximately .
* A crocodile shot in Odisha, India, was claimed to measure in life, but its skull, when given scholarly examination, was thought to have come from a crocodile of a length no greater than .
* A reported crocodile was killed in the Hooghly River in the Alipore District of Calcutta. However, examinations of the animal&#x27;s skull, one of the largest skulls known to exist for the species at long, actually indicating it could have measured .
* In 2006, Guinness accepted a , male saltwater crocodile living within Bhitarkanika Park in Odisha. Due to the difficulty of trapping and measuring a very large living crocodile, the accuracy of these dimensions is yet to be verified. These observations and estimations have been made by park officials over the course of ten years, from 2006 to 2016, however, regardless of the skill of the observers it cannot be compared to a verified tape measurement, especially considering the uncertainty inherent in visual size estimation in the wild. In addition, this region may contain up to four other specimens measuring over .
* S. Baker (1874) claimed that in Sri Lanka in the 1800s, specimens measuring or more were commonplace. However, the largest specimen killed on the island that was considered authentic by Guinness Records was a suspected man-eater killed in the Eastern Province and measuring exactly in length.
*The record size for a crocodile from Papua New Guinea to be considered authentic by Guinness was a specimen shot by Herb Schweighofer in May 1966 along the northeastern coast. This specimen had a belly girth of .

<text>Epsomite, Epsom salt, or magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, is a hydrous magnesium sulfate mineral with formula .

== Physical properties ==
Epsomite crystallizes in the orthorhombic system. The normal form is as massive encrustations, while acicular or fibrous crystals are rarely found. It is colorless to white with tints of yellow, green and pink. It is a soft mineral with variable Mohs hardness around 2.0~2.5, and it has a low specific gravity 

It is readily soluble in water, and absorbs water from the air. It converts to hexahydrate with the loss of one water molecule and a switch to monoclinic structure.

The epsomite group includes solid solution series with morenosite (·) and goslarite (·).

== Etymology ==
It was first systematically described in 1806 for an occurrence near Epsom, Surrey, England, after which it was named. It has been also referred to as &quot;cave cotton&quot; when in its fibrous form.

==Occurrence==
Epsomite forms as encrustations or efflorescences on limestone cavern walls and mine timbers and walls, rarely as volcanic fumarole deposits, and as rare beds in evaporite layers such as those found in certain bodies of salt water. It occurs in association with melanterite, gypsum, halotrichite, pickeringite, alunogen, rozenite, and mirabilite.

Naturally occurring epsomite in caverns can potentially produce particulates of inhalable size, and may contain significant amounts of toxic impurities.

==Uses==
Epsom salt is commonly sold as the main ingredient in bath salt, with additives such as glycerin (used as a humectant) and fragrances. The purpose of bath salts is mostly to make the bathing experience more enjoyable and serve as a vehicle for cosmetics, though they are said to improve cleaning and aid in exfoliation.

Research on topical magnesium (for example Epsom salt baths) is very limited. The trade organization &#x27;Epsom Salt Council&#x27; recommends bathing 2 or 3 times/week, using Epsom salts each time.

<text>The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA or ECA; , CEA) was established in 1958 by the United Nations Economic and Social Council to encourage economic cooperation among its member states (the nations of the African continent) following a recommendation of the United Nations General Assembly. It is one of five regional commissions.

The ECA has 54 member states, corresponding to the 54 member states of the United Nations that lie within the continent of Africa or in oceans nearby the continent. The ECA&#x27;s mandate is to promote the economic and social development of its member states, foster intra-regional integration, and promote international cooperation for Africa&#x27;s development.

On October 6, 2023, the UN Secretary-General appointed Claver Gatete of Rwanda as the Executive Secretary of UNECA, replacing the Cameroonian Vera Songwe. 

== Programs ==
The commission&#x27;s work is structured into seven programme divisions:
* African Centre for Statistics
* Macroeconomic Policy
* Social development Policy
* Innovation and Technology
* Regional integration and Trade
*Capacity Development

== Locations ==
* Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (Headquarters, Africa Hall, opened 1961)
* Yaoundé, Cameroon (Central African subregional headquarters)
* Kigali, Rwanda (East African subregional headquarters)
* Rabat, Morocco (North African subregional headquarters)
* Lusaka, Zambia (Southern African subregional headquarters)
* Niamey, Niger (West African subregional headquarters)

<text>A scatternet is a type of ad hoc computer network consisting of two or more piconets. The terms &quot;scatternet&quot; and &quot;piconet&quot; are typically applied to Bluetooth wireless technology.

==Description==
A &quot;piconet&quot; is the type of connection that is formed between two or more Bluetooth-enabled devices such as modern cell phones. Bluetooth enabled devices are &quot;peer units&quot; in that they are able to act as either master or slave. However, when a piconet is formed between two or more devices, one device takes the role of the &#x27;master&#x27;, and all other devices assume a &#x27;slave&#x27; role for synchronization reasons. Piconets have a 7 member address space (3 bits, with zero reserved for broadcast), which limits the maximum size of a piconet to 8 devices, i.e. 1 master and 7 slaves.

A &quot;scatternet&quot; is a number of interconnected piconets that supports communication between more than 8 devices. Scatternets can be formed when a member of one piconet (either the master or one of the slaves) elects to participate as a slave in a second, separate piconet. The device participating in both piconets can relay data between members of both ad hoc networks. However, the basic Bluetooth protocol does not support this relaying - the host software of each device would need to manage it. Using this approach, it is possible to join together numerous piconets into a large scatternet, and to expand the physical size of the network beyond Bluetooth&#x27;s limited range.

Currently there are very few actual implementations of scatternets due to limitations of Bluetooth and the MAC address protocol. However, there is a growing body of research being conducted with the goal of developing algorithms to efficiently form scatternets.

==Future applications==
Scatternets have the potential to bring the interconnectivity of the Internet to the physical world through wireless devices. A number of companies have attempted to launch social networking and dating services that leverage early scatternet implementations (see Bluedating). Scatternets can also be used to enable ad hoc communication and interaction between autonomous robots and other devices.

==Research==
Several papers exist that propose algorithms for scatternet formation, and many different approaches have been simulated in both academic and corporate R&amp;D environments. Some early experiments with large scatternets can be found at ETH Zurich in the BTnode project.

In 2008, a student at University College Cork, Ireland, developed a scatternet-based application in the Java programming language, using the JSR-82 library. This application&#x27;s main purpose is to facilitate parallel computations over Bluetooth scatternets, using an MPI-style message passing paradigm. Although it only runs on the emulation environment provided by Sun&#x27;s Wireless Toolkit, it is capable of creating a scatternet of up to 15 devices and routing a message through the network.

In 2006, a student at the University of Technology, Iraq, developed an on-demand peer-to-peer scatternet routing algorithm and protocol, with Java ME application based on JSR-82 library. This application was tested successfully on several real life Java-enabled mobile phones, and is capable of building large scatternets, but its only practical when routes are less than 3 nodes long due to Bluetooth&#x27;s speed.

<text>Ettayapuram is a panchayat town in Thoothukudi district of Tamil Nadu, India. It is the birthplace of Tamil poets Mahakavi Bharathiar and Umaru Pulavar. Muthuswami Dikshitar, one of the triads of Carnatic music, was patronized in his final years by the ruler of Ettayapuram.

==History==
Ettayapuram was originally Ilasanadu, which was ruled by the Pandya Kings. After the Pandyas, Ettappan was appointed as palayakarar by Madurai Nayak dynasty under the supervision of Vijayanagara empire. After 150 years of rule by the descendants of Ettappan, Ilasanadu became Ettayapuram in 1565.

===Ettayapuram estate===

Ettaiyapuram estate was a zamindari estate situated in the Ettayapuram taluk of the erstwhile Tuticorin district. The estate covered an area of and 374 villages and in 1901, had a population of 154,000. The headquarters of the estate was the town of Ettaiyapuram.

The estate was ruled by the Telugu Nayak dynasty whose ancestors hailed from Chandragiri in present-day Andhra Pradesh. During an invasion of Alauddin Khalji, Kumaramuttu Nayak the founder of the dynasty migrated from Chandragiri to Tirunelveli where he was granted the region comprising the later-established Ettaiyapuram estate. The town of Ettaiyapuram was established in 1567.

==Civic administration==
Ettayapuram is a town panchayat that is part of the Thoothukudi district, which was carved out of the erstwhile Tirunelveli district. It was in Kovilpatti constituency till 2006 general Elections and Now it comes under the Vilathikulam constituency of Tamil Nadu legislative assembly from 2011 Elections.

==Demographics==
 India census, Ettayapuram had a population of 12,800. Males constitute 48% of the population and females 52%. Ettayapuram has an average literacy rate of 69%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 78%, and female literacy is 61%. In Ettayapuram, 10% of the population is under 6 years of age.

==Economy==
People of Ettayapuram are primarily engaged in weaving, making matches and agriculture. Traditional weavers weave cotton yarn using handlooms. Small companies operate power looms and allied trades of preparing the thread for weaving and dyeing. The other major industry is the manufacture of match boxes, which includes manufacturing small boxes that contain matchsticks, preparing match sticks and loading them on to the matchboxes. The area of land under cultivation has fallen due to failing rains and relatively poor soil fertility. The soil type is black soil, which supports crops like &quot;kezhvaragu&quot;, &quot;cumbu&quot;, &quot;cholam&quot;, cotton and sunflower. &quot;Kanni&quot; breed of goats, a drought-resistant variety reared for its meat, is most common in this region.

==Transport==
Ettayapuram is connected to Madurai, Thoothukkudi, Rameshwaram and Tirunelveli by road. The nearest railway station is Kovilpatti, which is 15 km from Ettayapuram.

==Notable people==
Subramanya Bharathy, better known as &quot;Mahakavi Bharathiar&quot; was born here on 11 December 1882. A prolific writer, philosopher and a great visionary of immense genius and perspicacity, Bharathiar was also one of the most prominent leaders of the Indian independence movement in South India.

Ettappan, after whom the place was named carried a negative impression as he gave away the information regarding “Veerapandiya” Kattabomman Nayak&#x27;s whereabouts to the British, which eventually led to his arrest and hanging. &quot;Ettappan&quot; became a metaphor for a &quot;traitor&quot;. His namesake descendants were involved in welfare activities including arrangements for water supply through huge tanks and patronized poets and musicians including Bharathy and Muthuswami Dikshitar.

Umaru Pulavar () was a Tamil Muslim poet from Tamil Nadu, India. Umaru Pulavar was born in 1642 in the town of Ettayapuram in Thoothukudi district. He is celebrated as one of the greatest Islamic Poets of India.

<text>Henry Spencer Ashbee (21 April 1834 – 29 July 1900) was a book collector, writer and bibliographer. He is notable for his massive, clandestine three-volume bibliography of erotic literature published under the pseudonym of Pisanus Fraxi.

==Life==
Ashbee was born in Southwark, London, the son of Robert and Frances Ashbee (born Spencer). He became the senior partner in the London branch of the firm of Charles Lavy &amp; Co. He travelled extensively during his life, including Europe, Japan, and San Francisco, collaborating with the architect Alexander Graham on &quot;Travels in Tunisia&quot;, published in 1887.

Ashbee married Elisabeth Lavy in 1862. Elizabeth (1841–1919) was the daughter of Edward Otto Charles Lavy, who founded the Hamburg firm in 1838. Elizabeth&#x27;s brother Charles Lavy (1842–1928) inherited the firm and became a politician in Germany.

The Ashbees had one son, Charles (the designer Charles Robert Ashbee, born 1863), and three daughters. His family life grew unhappier as he aged. As he became more conservative, his family followed the progressive movement of the era. &quot;The &#x27;excessive education&#x27; of his daughters irritated him, his Jewish wife&#x27;s pro-suffragism infuriated him, and he became estranged from his socialist homosexual son, Charles&quot;. Henry and Elisabeth separated in 1893. Henry Spencer Ashbee is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.

==Book collection==

Ashbee was an avid book collector, with perhaps the world&#x27;s most extensive collections of Miguel de Cervantes and erotica. Influenced by a friendship with the Belgian diplomat Joseph Octave Delepierre, his erotica collecting proceeded with purchases in Amsterdam, Brussels, and Paris.

Ashbee was a part of a loose intellectual fraternity of English gentlemen who discussed sexual matters with an openness that was at odds with Victorian mores; this fraternity included Richard Francis Burton, Richard Monckton Milnes, Algernon Charles Swinburne and others. He also amassed thousands of volumes of pornography in several languages. He wrote on sex under the pseudonyms &quot;Fraxinus&quot; (Ash) and &quot;Apis&quot; (Bee) and sometimes combined them as &quot;Pisanus Fraxi&quot;.

Ashbee&#x27;s will left his entire book collection to the British Museum, with the condition that the erotic works had to be accepted along with the more conventional items. Because the trustees of the Museum wanted the materials related to Cervantes, they decided to accept the entire bequest but not without some reluctance. The trustees were allowed to destroy any of the books if they already had a duplicate, but in the event went much further and destroyed six boxes &quot;of offensive matter which is of no value or interest whatsoever&quot; including cheaply produced Victorian erotica. The remainder of the erotic works formed the core of the Private Case which were kept hidden from readers in the British Library for many years; they include a work by William Simpson Potter. (See also Secretum).

==Writing==
Ashbee&#x27;s most famous works were his three bibliographies of erotic works:
* &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum: being Notes Bio- Biblio- Icono- graphical and Critical, on Curious and Uncommon Books, by Pisanus Fraxi.&quot; London, privately printed, 1877. (The name is borrowed from the Catholic Church&#x27;s list of banned books, &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot;). Translation: A Catalog of Books which should be Prohibited. A facsimile edition was printed in 1960 by Charles Skilton Ltd., London, &quot;limited to 395 copies&quot; (p. 543). In at least the facsimile, the title page reads &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitoru&quot; [the final &quot;m&quot; is missing]. (Charles Skilton was the publisher of the Billy Bunter series of school stories.)
* &quot;Centuria Librorum Absconditorum: being Notes Bio- Icono- graphical and Critical, on Curious and Uncommon Books.&quot; London, privately printed, 1879, online. Translation: A Hundred Books that should be Hidden.
* &quot;Catena Librorum Tacendorum: being Notes Bio- Icono- graphical and Critical, on Curious and Uncommon Books.&quot; London, privately printed, 1885, online. Translation: Further Books which should not be mentioned.

The &quot;Index&quot; was arranged alphabetically by title, the &quot;Centuria&quot; and &quot;Catena&quot; by subject. Ashbee includes plot summaries of the works listed, with liberal quotations. Of particular note are the 300 pages of the &quot;Centuria&quot; devoted to anti-Catholic pornography. Initially only 250 copies of each volume were printed.

Ashbee is suspected to be &quot;Walter&quot;, the author of &quot;My Secret Life&quot;, a lengthy sexual memoir of a Victorian gentleman.

==Legacy==
Ashbee was the subject of a 2001 biography by Ian Gibson, &quot;The Erotomaniac&quot;.

A character based on Ashbee is central to Sarah Waters&#x27;s award-winning novel &quot;Fingersmith&quot; (2002): a man obsessively collecting and indexing pornography and works about human sexuality, in an atmosphere of oppressive Victorian hypocrisy.

Ashbee is No. 1 on &quot;Time Out&quot;″s &quot;Top 30 chart of London&#x27;s rudest writers... the authors we feel have contributed the most to our understanding of the city&#x27;s complex sexual psychology...&quot;

<text>Galena Summit is a high mountain pass in the western United States in central Idaho, at an elevation of above sea level. The pass is located in the Boulder Mountains, in the northwest corner of Blaine County, within the Sawtooth National Recreation Area of the Sawtooth National Forest.

The summit is on State Highway 75, the &quot;Sawtooth Scenic Byway,&quot; and is northwest of Ketchum and the Sun Valley ski resort. It is the highest summit of a highway in the Northwest. Prior to 1977, Highway 75 was designated U.S. Route 93, which is now to the east on the former U.S. 93 alternate, through Arco and the Lost River Valley.

Galena Summit marks the divide between the Big Wood River and Salmon River drainage areas. A little more than west of the summit is Galena Overlook, a scenic viewpoint at . It offers views of the Sawtooth range to the northwest and the headwaters of the Salmon River in the Stanley Basin of Custer County, which Highway 75 follows north to Obsidian and Stanley, then east and north towards Challis. The overlook facilities were originally opened in 1964, renamed in 2006 for Frank and Bethine Church, and renovated in 2010.

The Galena Lodge (in historic Galena) is at , on the Ketchum side of the summit, and hosts cross country skiing. Collegiate alpine ski races were held on the summit in late 1947, due to a lack of snow at Sun Valley, and supplies were dropped in by airplane. The Ore-Ida Women&#x27;s Challenge bicycle race (1984–2002) had a stage that crested the summit.

Galena is a mineral, lead sulfide, an important lead ore; deposits of galena often contain silver.

<doc id="566436" wikidata="Q2472379" url="?curid=566436" title="C-class cruiser">
<text>The C class was a group of twenty-eight light cruisers of the Royal Navy, and were built in seven groups known as the &quot;Caroline&quot; class (six ships), the &quot;Calliope&quot; class (two ships), the &quot;Cambrian&quot; class (four ships), the &quot;Centaur&quot; class (two ships), the &quot;Caledon&quot; class (four ships), the &quot;Ceres&quot; class (five ships) and the &quot;Carlisle&quot; class (five ships). They were built for the rough conditions of the North Sea, and proved to be rugged and capable vessels, despite being somewhat small and cramped.

== The &quot;Caroline&quot; class ==

The &quot;Caroline&quot; class were all ordered in July and August 1913, as the first six of eight &quot;light armoured cruisers&quot; under the 1913 programme. The ships were launched in 1914 or 1915 and commissioned in 1915. They had an armament of two single 6 in aft, eight 4 in and two 6-pounder guns. Their anti-aircraft (A/A) weaponry consisted of four 3-pounder. Their aft 6 in guns were superfiring; the class had three funnels. During the First World War, the ships of the class underwent a variety of alterations, including the removal of the guns in &quot;Caroline&quot;, &quot;Carysfort&quot; and &quot;Comus&quot;, being replaced by two extra guns, while &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;Conquest&quot; and &quot;Cordelia&quot; retained one or two of the guns, with two 2-pounder guns being added to some of the ships.

=== Ships ===
* was built by Cammell Laird and Company, Birkenhead. She was laid down on 28 January 1914, launched on 29 September 1914, and completed in December. She became a drill ship for the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve in April 1924 and fulfilled that role in Alexandra Dock, Belfast until 31 March 2011, when she was decommissioned. In May 2013 the Heritage Lottery Fund announced an £845,600 grant to support her conversion to a museum.
* was built by Pembroke Dockyard. Laid down on 25 February 1914, she was launched on 14 November 1914, and completed in June 1915. She was sold for breaking up in August 1931.
* was built by Devonport Dockyard. Laid down on 26 February 1914, she was launched on 14 January 1915, and completed in June. She was sold for breaking up in June 1931.
* was built by Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson, Wallsend on Tyne. Laid down on 3 November 1913, she was launched on 16 December 1914, and completed in January 1915. She was sold for breaking up on 28 July 1934.
* was built by Chatham Dockyard. She was laid down on 3 March 1914, launched on 20 January 1915, and completed in June. She was sold for breaking up on 29 August 1930.
* was built by Pembroke Dockyard. She was laid down on 21 July 1913, launched on 23 February 1914, and completed in June. She was sold for breaking up 31 July 1923.

== The &quot;Calliope&quot; class ==
The two ships of the &quot;Calliope&quot; sub-class – HMS &quot;Calliope&quot; and &quot;Champion&quot; – were the last pair of the eight &quot;light armoured cruisers&quot; to be ordered in July and August 1914 under the 1913 Programme. They both had geared turbines, the first Royal Navy cruisers to be so fitted. They also had increased belt armour; &quot;Champion&quot; had just two screws. They were commissioned in mid to late 1915, as modifications to the &quot;Caroline&quot; subclass with higher speeds, a more efficient boiler layout and a reduction in the number of funnels to two. The two ships had different machinery types for comparative purposes. &quot;Calliope&quot; and &quot;Champion&quot; underwent similar gun armament modifications to the &quot;Caroline&quot; subclass. They also had underwater tubes rather than the deck mounted weapons of the &quot;Caroline&quot; subclass and were given two twin deck mounted torpedo tubes during the war but these were later removed to reduce top weight.

=== Ships ===
* : Built by Chatham Dockyard, she was laid down on 1 January 1914, and launched on 17 December; she was completed in June 1915. She was sold for breaking up on 28 August 1931.
* : Built by R. &amp; W. Hawthorn Leslie and Company, Hebburn on Tyne, she was laid on down 9 March 1914, launched on 29 May 1915, and completed in December 1915. She was sold for breaking up on 28 July 1934.

== The &quot;Cambrian&quot; class ==
The &quot;Cambrian&quot; class were ordered in September 1914 under the 1914–15 Programme, and commissioned between 1915 and 1916. The ships had two funnels rather than the three of the &quot;Caroline&quot; subclass, following on from the developments in the &quot;Calliope&quot; subclass. The &quot;Cambrian&quot; subclass had similar armament to the previous sub-class, with their main armament being four guns in single mounts. Their secondary armament consisted of eight guns. They were later removed, with &quot;Canterbury&quot; and &quot;Champion&quot; retaining one single gun. The rest of the ships used either two or three guns.

== The &quot;Centaur&quot; class ==

The &quot;Centaur&quot; subclass were ordered in December 1914, and built using materials originally intended for two scout cruisers to be built for Turkey. These vessels were launched and commissioned in 1916. The class also had geared turbines as well as four screws. They retained the two funnels introduced to the C class by the &quot;Cambrian&quot;s. Their main armament was five 6 in guns in single mounts. Their guns were mostly replaced in a similar fashion to the previous sub-classes, with smaller calibre weapons.

=== Ships ===
* ; she was built by Sir W.G. Armstrong-Whitworth &amp; Co., Ltd., Walker on Tyne; she was laid down on 24 January 1915, launched on 6 January 1916, and completed in August 1916. She was sold for breaking up in February 1934.
* ; she was built by Armstrong-Whitworth having been laid down on 1 February 1915, launched on 1 April 1916, and completed in December. She was sold for breaking up in August 1935.

== The &quot;Caledon&quot; class ==

The &quot;Caledon&quot; class were all ordered in December 1915 and commissioned in 1917. The ships retained the two funnels of the previous two sub-classes. Their propulsion was slightly different from the previous sub-classes. Their superstructure was also slightly altered. They had a main armament of five guns and a secondary armament of two 3 in guns, as well as an AA armament of four 3 pounder guns. The surviving ships of the class saw World War II, undergoing a number of modifications along the way. Five Oerlikon 20 mm cannons were added to all ships. &quot;Caledon&quot; herself had a different armament, as she underwent an extensive rebuild to become an AA cruiser. She was armed with the effective gun, of which she had twelve, two 40 mm Bofors and eight 20 mm Oerlikons.

=== Ships ===
* was built by Cammell Laird; she was laid down on 17 March 1916, launched on 25 November, and was completed in March 1917. She became an AA ship in December 1943; she was sold for breaking up on 22 January 1948.
* was built by Hawthorn Leslie; she was laid down on 7 February 1916, launched on 24 January 1917, and completed in June. She was sunk by the Italian submarine south of Crete on 12 June 1940.
* was built by Vickers, Barrow in Furness; she was laid down March 1916, launched 25 November 1916, and completed in June 1917. She was sunk by a mine in the Baltic on 5 December 1918.
* was built by Scott&#x27;s Shipuilding and Engineering Company in Greenock; she was laid down on 21 February 1916, launched 23 December, and was completed in June 1917. She became a base ship in April 1944, and was sold for breaking up in May 1946.

== The &quot;Ceres&quot; class ==

The &quot;Ceres&quot; class were ordered in March and April 1916 and commissioned in 1917 and 1918. These ships were very &quot;wet&quot; forward, which was remedied in the subsequent &quot;Carlisle&quot; sub-class with the addition of a &quot;trawler bow&quot;. Their main armament consisted of five guns, while their secondary armament consisted of two weapons, of which a further one was later added to &quot;Ceres&quot; herself. Four 3-pounder guns were also fitted.

Three ships underwent extensive rebuilds during the 1930s, becoming anti-aircraft (AA) cruisers, resulting in all previous armament being removed. The ships were &quot;Coventry&quot;, &quot;Curacoa&quot; and &quot;Curlew&quot;, with &quot;Curacoa&quot; being the last of the three to be rebuilt in 1939; the other two ships having been converted in 1935. &quot;Coventry&quot; and &quot;Curlew&quot; were given ten QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun for their AA role, disposed in single mounts one forward, three on each beam and three aft. Sixteen QF 2-pounder naval gun Mark VIII as two 8-barelled Mark VI mountings (&quot;multiple pom-poms&quot;) were fitted aft (one removed by 1939). Torpedo tubes were removed, and two High-Angle HACS gun directors and a Pom-Pom director added. &quot;Curacoa&quot; received similar gun directors but a slightly different armament, being equipped with eight QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun in twin mountings replacing 6 inch guns number 1,3,4 and 5; and four QF 2-pounder naval gun Mark VIII as a 4-barelled Mark VII mounting (&quot;multiple pom-pom&quot;) replacing 6 inch gun number 2 forward of the bridge. Later on in the Second World War, four 20 mm Oerlikons were added. &quot;Cardiff&quot; and &quot;Ceres&quot; were to have undergone the same conversion, but this was prevented by the outbreak of war.

=== Ships ===
* was built by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, in Govan; she was laid down on 22 July 1916, and launched on 12 April; she was completed in June 1917. She was sold for breaking up on 23 January 1946.
* built by John Brown; she was laid down on 11 July 1916, launched on 24 March 1917, and completed in June. She was sold for breaking up on 5 April 1946.
* was built by Swan Hunter; she was laid down on 4 August 1916, launched on 6 July 1917, and completed in February 1918. She became an AA ship in 1937; but was sunk by aircraft off Tobruk in the Mediterranean on 14 September 1942.
* was built by Pembroke Dockyard; she was laid down in July 1916, launched on 5 May 1917, and completed in February 1918. She became an AA ship in 1939; she was sunk in a collision with RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; north of Ireland on 2 October 1942.
* was built by Vickers; she was laid down on 21 August 1916, launched on 5 July 1917, and was completed in December 1917. She became an AA ship in 1938; but was sunk by aircraft in Ofotfjord, Norway, on 26 May 1940.

== The &quot;Carlisle&quot; class ==
The &quot;Carlisle&quot; class were ordered in June and July 1917 under the War Emergency Programme, and commissioned between 1918 and 1922. They differed from the previous sub-class, with the addition of a &quot;trawler bow&quot; which raised the bow higher, as well as having no conning tower. They had an armament of five guns in single mounts, while their secondary armament consisted of two guns, four 3-pounders and two 2-pounder guns.

=== Ships ===
* was built by Cammell Laird, Birkenhead; she was laid down on 28 November 1917, launched on 19 November 1918, and completed on 23 September 1919. She became an AA ship in 1939; she was sunk by the Italian submarine &quot;Axum&quot; in the Mediterranean on 12 August 1942.
* was built by Vickers, Barrow in Furness; she was laid down on 18 October 1917, launched on 9 July 1918, and completed in August 1919. She became an AA ship in 1939; she was sunk by air attack during the evacuation of Crete on 1 June 1941.
* was built by Cammell Laird; she was laid down 23 February 1918, launched on 28 June 1919 and then towed to Pembroke Dockyard where she was completed in April 1922. She was sold for breaking up on 5 April 1946.
* (ex-&quot;Cawnpore&quot;), was built by the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, Govan; she was laid down on 2 October 1917 and launched on 9 July 1918; she was completed in November 1918. She became an AA ship in 1939; she then became a base ship in 1944; she was sold for breaking up at Alexandria in 1948.
* was built by Fairfield; she was laid down on 8 December 1917, launched 18 December 1918, and completed in July 1919. She became an AA ship in 1943; she was sold for breaking up on 22 January 1948.

All ships of the class except &quot;Colombo&quot; and &quot;Capetown&quot; were converted into AA cruisers in 1939, although &quot;Capetown&quot; received six 20 mm guns and radar. The ships&#x27; main armament consisted of eight guns in four twin turrets with varying numbers of 20 mm Oerlikons being added. &quot;Colombo&quot; was finally converted to an AA cruiser in 1942, with her armament consisting of eight guns and six 20 mm Oerlikons. All the AA cruiser conversions followed a similar pattern to that of HMS Curacoa (D41).

== First World War service ==
In March 1916, &quot;Cleopatra&quot; rammed and sank the German destroyer while she covered a raid at Tondern. Ships of the C class were extensively involved later that year in the Battle of Jutland. In 1917, &quot;Centaur&quot; hit mines that blew her bow and stern off. Despite the extensive damage, &quot;Centaur&quot; survived and was repaired. The year also saw ships of the class involved in action at the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight.

In 1918, &quot;Cardiff&quot; had the honour of leading the German High Seas Fleet to the River Forth, where the ships were held before being moved to various other ports.

No C-class ships were lost during the First World War; however, in December 1918, &quot;Cassandra&quot; hit a mine and subsequently sank.

Ships of the C class performed a variety of duties after World War I, including service on overseas stations. In 1919, &quot;Curacoa&quot; hit a mine that badly damaged her, but she survived and was repaired. The &quot;Caroline&quot;, &quot;Cambrian&quot; and &quot;Centaur&quot; classes were all scrapped or consigned to minor roles, such as training ships, by the 1930s.

== Conversion ==
In the mid-1930s it was decided to modernize and refit the C class cruisers for anti-aircraft work. The aim was to convert all 13 cruisers of the late C (&quot;Caledon&quot;, &quot;Ceres&quot; and &quot;Carlisle&quot;) classes. The conversions between 1935 and 1936 of HMS &quot;Coventry&quot; and &quot;Curlew&quot; served as prototypes.

&quot;Coventry&quot; and &quot;Curlew&quot; first had all armament removed. This was replaced with 10 single mount 4 inch high angle (HA) guns and two eight-barreled 2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; mounts. The previous gun directors were removed and replaced with two suitable for anti-aircraft gun control. To keep costs down, only limited structural work was carried out, but the masts were altered. In 1938, because of a shortage of this weapon, the aft pom-pom was removed and fitted on another ship, being replaced by two quadruple Vickers machine gun mounts.

The modifications were considered successful and plans for the conversion of the other eleven ships were drawn up. However, these conversions were delayed; the conversions of &quot;Cairo&quot; and &quot;Calcutta&quot; did not start until 1938. Instead of single 4 inch guns, they were to receive twin HA mounts, except that one mount was given over to a quadruple pom-pom. In mid-1939, &quot;Carlisle&quot; and &quot;Curacoa&quot; went in for their conversions, but the work ceased on the outbreak of war.

== Second World War service ==
The &quot;Caledon&quot;, &quot;Ceres&quot; and &quot;Carlisle&quot;-class ships served in the Second World War, despite their age.

&quot;Calypso&quot; caught the German blockade-runner &quot;Konsul Hendrik Fisser&quot; in 1939. That same year, &quot;Caradoc&quot; intercepted the German tanker &quot;Emmy Friedrich&quot;, whose crew subsequently scuttled her. A number of ships took part in the Norwegian campaign in 1940.

The C class were also extensively used in the Mediterranean Sea; the first notable engagement by a ship of the class being &quot;Coventry&quot;″s participation in the Battle of Cape Spartivento in 1940.

In 1941, &quot;Calcutta&quot; and &quot;Carlisle&quot; took part in the Battle of Cape Matapan, in which a number of Italian warships were sunk. C-class cruisers also took part in the campaign and evacuation of Crete, coming up against heavy German opposition from the air. In 1942, &quot;Carlisle&quot; took part in the Second Battle of Sirte, and &quot;Cairo&quot; in the Battle of Pantelleria.

&quot;Colombo&quot; and &quot;Caledon&quot; went in for their refits in 1942/43 – getting 40 mm Bofors and 20 mm Oerlikons alongside the twin mounts.

In 1943, &quot;Carlisle&quot; was badly damaged by German aircraft, but did not sink. She became a base ship in Alexandria Harbour until 1945.

&quot;Capetown&quot; provided support to the Normandy Landings in 1944, bombarding German positions.
Six ships of the C class were lost during the war: 
&quot;Curlew&quot; was sunk by German aircraft off Narvik during the Norwegian campaign on 26 May 1940; 
&quot;Calypso&quot; was sunk by the Italian submarine on 12 June 1940; 
&quot;Calcutta&quot; was attacked and sunk by German aircraft during the evacuation of Crete on 1 June 1941;
&quot;Cairo&quot; was sunk on 12 August 1942 by the during Operation Pedestal (the pivotal resupply of Malta); 
&quot;Coventry&quot; was badly damaged by German aircraft while covering a raid on Tobruk on 14 September 1942, forcing the destroyer to scuttle her; and 
&quot;Curacoa&quot; was sunk after colliding with the ocean liner on 2 October 1942.

== The survivor ==
 remained the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve drill ship in Alexandra Dock, Belfast until 31 March 2011, when she was decommissioned. Despite ongoing alterations throughout her lifetime, many parts of the ship still date to when she was originally commissioned in 1914. In 2016 she was opened to the public as a museum ship.

<text>Ali Atwa (; – October 2021) was a Lebanese national and member of the Islamist organization Hezbollah. Atwa was also known as &quot;Ammar Mansour Bouslim&quot; and &quot;Hassan Rostom Salim&quot;.

Atwa was wanted by the United States government for his alleged involvement in the 14 June 1985 hijacking of TWA Flight 847. Atwa allegedly intended to help hijack the plane but was bumped from the flight, was arrested but was then released by the Greek government as part of the deal to release the hostages, and then rejoined the hijackers in Algiers on board the hijacked airplane. This hijacking resulted in the death of United States Navy diver Robert Stethem.

On 1 October 2001, Atwa along with two other alleged participants in the hijacking was placed on the initial list of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s top 22 Most Wanted Terrorists, which was released to the public by President Bush. A reward of US$5 million was being offered for information leading to his arrest and conviction. Atwa died of cancer in October 2021 in Lebanon. Despite this, the FBI&#x27;s website still lists Atwa as a fugitive.

<text>Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge is a U.S. National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) on the Atlantic coast of Florida&#x27;s largest barrier island. NASA&#x27;s Kennedy Space Center and visitor complex are also situated on the island and NASA can restrict access to the refuge based on its operational needs.

The NWR contains over 1000 species of plants, 117 species of fish, 68 amphibians and reptiles, 330 birds, and 31 mammal species, of which 21 species are listed as endangered by the state of Florida or by the US federal government. Management of the NWR is provided through the Merritt Island NWR Complex, which provides hiking and driving trails for the public, subject to access restrictions from NASA. It is a &#x27;gateway site&#x27; for the Great Florida Birding Trail.

==Location and extent==

Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge is located due east of Titusville on Merritt Island in Brevard County, Florida, and occupies , overlaid with the Kennedy Space Center. To the north, it borders on the Canaveral National Seashore; to the south it encompasses non-public portions of the Kennedy Space Center (with which it also shares some history), which in turn abuts Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Mosquito Lagoon and the Indian River run through the refuge. Since public access to all these areas is controlled in various ways, the refuge is part of a very substantial area of relatively undisturbed wildlife habitat.

==History==
The land occupied by the NWR was acquired by NASA in the early 1960s for the development of the Space Center and its non-operational purposes. Until then, there had been little development in the area because of the high number of salt marsh mosquitoes. Public access is normally permitted, and several state highways run across the refuge. However, the public can be excluded if necessary for NASA&#x27;s purposes, as is done in the days before a launch.

==Habitats and species==
The refuge provides a range of habitats, from saltwater estuaries and freshwater impoundments and marshes, to dunes, hardwood hammocks, and scrub. It contains over 1000 species of plants, 117 species of fish, 68 amphibians and reptiles, 330 birds, and 31 mammal species. Of these species, 21 are listed as endangered either by the state of Florida or by the US federal government. The following are some of the more important species using the refuge; most of them nest there:
*Sea turtles including
**Loggerhead sea turtle
**Green turtle
*American alligator
*Osprey
*Bald eagle
*Many species of waterfowl use the refuge as a wintering ground; blue-winged teal and northern shoveler are resident in small numbers
*Many species of shorebirds, some resident and some using the refuge in the course of their migration
*Several species of rails
*Anhinga

*Several species of heron and egret
*Glossy and white ibis
*Roseate spoonbill
*Florida scrub jay
*West Indian manatee
*Bobcat
*Dwarf siren, a recently discovered salamander
==Facilities==
Subject to the needs of NASA, public access is relatively unrestricted, though it is only allowed during daylight hours; camping is only allowed for certain organized youth organizations.

The refuge provides hiking and driving trails for visitors, with opportunities for observing wildlife without causing disturbances; most of the species listed above can be seen by a casual visitor. An observation deck is provided near the drawbridge that carries State Road 3 over the Haulover Canal, in the northern part of the refuge, since manatees frequently congregate there. Boating is permitted on the waters around and within the refuge, and provides an opportunity for observing the wildlife. There are facilities for launching pleasure boats at several places. In addition the refuge includes, and gives access to Playalinda Beach on the outer barrier island. Fishing is generally permitted, and hunting for wildfowl is allowed on a strictly limited basis. There is a Visitor Center.

==Management==
Merritt Island NWR Complex acted as an administrative center for a number of other NWR&#x27;s in central Florida but since 2012 management of the &quot;Merritt Island NWR&quot;, St. Johns National Wildlife Refuge, and Lake Woodruff National Wildlife Refuge are administered by the &quot;Merritt Island NWR Complex&quot; located on SR 402, 5 miles east of Titusville, Florida.
The Lake Wales Ridge National Wildlife Refuge, Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge, Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge, and the Everglades Headwaters National Wildlife Refuge and Conservation Area are administered by the Everglades Headwaters National Wildlife Refuge Complex. headquartered in Vero Beach, Florida. Water levels are controlled in most of the refuge, to conserve its range of habitats. Controlled fires are used regularly.

== Roads in the refuge ==

Black Point Wildlife Drive is a one-way seven-mile dike road allowing wildlife viewing of the refuge

=== Kennedy Parkway ===
Kennedy Parkway traverses the John F. Kennedy Space Center and the refuge. In the John F. Kennedy Space Center, it is long with a divided highway. North of Beach Road, it is two lanes wide. In total, it is long, from the southern border of the Space Center to U.S. 1, near Oak Hill. North of Dummit Grove, it forms the western boundary of the Canaveral National Seashore.

<text>Charles William Haines (January 2, 1900 – December 26, 1973) was an American actor and interior designer.

Haines was discovered by a talent scout and signed with Goldwyn Pictures in 1922. His career gained momentum when he received favorable reviews for his role in &quot;The Midnight Express&quot;. He was cast in the 1926 film &quot;Brown of Harvard&quot; and his performance solidified his screen persona as a wisecracking, arrogant leading man. By the end of the 1920s, Haines had appeared in a string of successful films and was a popular box-office draw.

Haines&#x27; acting career was cut short by the studios in the 1930s due to his refusal to deny his homosexuality. He quit acting in 1935 and started a successful interior design business with his life partner Jimmie Shields, and his work was widely patronized by friends in Hollywood. Haines died of lung cancer in December 1973 at the age of 73.

== Early life ==
Haines was born on January 2, 1900 (he claimed he was born on January 1) in Staunton, Virginia, the third child of George Adam Haines, a cigar maker, and Laura Virginia Haines (née Matthews). Two older siblings died in infancy. He had four younger siblings: Lillian, born in 1902; Ann, born in 1907; George, Jr., born in 1908; and Henry, born in 1917. He was baptized at the Trinity Episcopal Church in Staunton at the age of eight, where he later sang in the choir. He became fascinated with stage performance and motion pictures at an early age, spending hours watching early silent films in local theatres.

Haines ran away from home at the age of 14, accompanied by an unidentified young man whom Haines referred to as his &quot;boyfriend&quot;. The pair went first to Richmond and then to Hopewell, which had a reputation for immorality. They got jobs working at the local DuPont factory, producing nitrocellulose for $50 a week. To supplement their income, they opened a dance hall, which may have also served as a brothel. Haines&#x27; parents, frantic over his disappearance, tracked him through the police to Hopewell. Haines did not return home with them, remaining instead in Hopewell and sending money back home to help support the family. The couple remained in Hopewell until most of the town was destroyed by fire in 1915. Haines moved to New York City. Whether his boyfriend accompanied him is unclear.

Following the bankruptcy of the family business and the mental breakdown of George Sr., the family moved to Richmond in 1916. Haines moved there in 1917 to help support them. With his father recovered and employed, Haines returned to New York City in 1919, settling into the burgeoning gay community of Greenwich Village. He worked a variety of jobs and was for a time the kept man of an older woman before becoming a model. Talent scout Bijou Fernandez discovered Haines as part of the Goldwyn Pictures&#x27; &quot;New Faces of 1922&quot; contest, and the studio signed him to a $40-a-week contract (~$700 in 2022 terms). He traveled to Hollywood with fellow contest winner Eleanor Boardman in March of that year.

== Career ==
=== Acting ===

Haines&#x27; career began slowly, as he appeared in extra and bit parts, mostly uncredited. His first significant role was in &quot;Three Wise Fools&quot; (1923). He attracted positive critical attention and the studio began building him up as a new star. However, he continued to play small, unimportant parts at Goldwyn. When his home studio lent him to Fox in 1923 for &quot;The Desert Outlaw&quot;, he got the opportunity to play a significant role. In 1924, MGM lent Haines to Columbia Pictures for a five-picture deal. The first of these, &quot;The Midnight Express&quot; (1924), received excellent reviews, and Columbia offered to buy his contract. The offer was refused and Haines continued in bit roles for Goldwyn. Haines scored his first big personal success with &quot;Brown of Harvard&quot; (1926) opposite Jack Pickford and Mary Brian. It was in &quot;Brown&quot; that he crystallized his screen image, a young arrogant man who is humbled by the last reel. He returned repeatedly to that formula for the next several years.

On a trip to New York in 1926, Haines met James &quot;Jimmie&quot; Shields. Haines convinced Shields to move to Los Angeles, promising to get him work as an extra. The pair soon began living together and viewed themselves as a committed couple, though newspapers did not mention their relationship.

Haines found box-office success with &quot;Little Annie Rooney&quot; (1925), co-starring Mary Pickford, and &quot;Show People&quot; (1928), costarring Marion Davies. He was a top-five box-office star from 1928 to 1932. He made a successful transition into &quot;talkies&quot; in the part-talking film &quot;Alias Jimmy Valentine&quot; (1928). He was forced to take elocution lessons for the film; he compared the coming of sound to &quot;the discovery of clap in a nunnery.&quot; His first all-talking film, &quot;Navy Blues&quot;, was released the following year. He starred in &quot;Way Out West&quot; in 1930. The 1930 Quigley Poll, a survey of film exhibitors, listed Haines as the top box-office attraction in the country.

In 1933, Haines was arrested in a YMCA with a sailor he had picked up in Los Angeles&#x27; Pershing Square. Louis B. Mayer, the studio head at MGM, delivered an ultimatum to Haines: choose between a sham lavender marriage, his relationship with Shields or his relationship with the sailor. Haines chose Shields and they remained together in a private relationship for 47 years. Mayer then fired Haines and terminated his contract. He made a few minor films at Poverty Row studios and soon retired from acting. His final films were made in 1934 with Mascot Pictures, &quot;Young and Beautiful&quot; and &quot;The Marines Are Coming&quot;.

Haines continued to receive offers for film roles. During production of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950), he was offered a cameo role in the film, which he declined. He later said, &quot;It&#x27;s a rather pleasant feeling of being away from pictures and being part of them because all my friends are. I can see the nice side of them without seeing the ugly side of the studios.&quot;

=== Interior design ===

Haines and Shields began a successful dual career as interior designers and antique dealers. Among their early clients were friends such as Joan Crawford, Gloria Swanson, Carole Lombard, Marion Davies, and George Cukor. After a neighbor accused the two of propositioning her son, about 30 local residents including members of a white supremacist group called &quot;The White Legion&quot; dragged the two men from their home in El Porto near the city of Manhattan Beach (this was before El Porto became a part of that city) and beat them. The incident was widely reported at the time, but the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s office never brought charges against the attackers. The child molestation accusations against Haines and Shields were unfounded and the case was dismissed due to a lack of evidence. In reality, the boy had been chasing Haines&#x27; dog on the beach and Haines paid the child six cents to go home; this was misinterpreted as a proposition. When Jack L. Warner remodeled his estate in 1937, he hired Haines as interior decorator. He also designed an office for Frank Sinatra and the Mocambo nightclub.

The couple finally settled in the west Los Angeles community of Brentwood and their business prospered until their retirement in the early 1970s, except for a brief interruption when Haines served in World War II.

Known for his impeccable taste in interior design and love for vintage pieces, Haines worked closely with his friend Joan Crawford — whom he teasingly called Cranberry — to renovate her Brentwood home. His unconventional choice of an all-white decor for her living room caused a sensation and helped launch his interior design career, working for Carole Lombard next. Later in 1956, he would decorate Crawford’s newly renovated two-floor apartment purchased with her new husband, Alfred Steele.

In the 60s and 70s, their clients included Betsy Bloomingdale and Ronald and Nancy Reagan when Reagan was governor of California. Haines and Ted Graber designed the interiors of Walter and Leonore Annenberg&#x27;s &quot;Sunnylands&quot; estate in Rancho Mirage. The Annenbergs also hired Haines to work on the redecoration of Winfield House in London, where Walter was serving as U.S. Ambassador.

=== Notable interior design clientele ===


Celebrities including Cameron Diaz, Courteney Cox, Anne Heche and Ellen DeGeneres purchased pieces of Haines&#x27; furniture in 1999.

== Final years and death ==
Haines and Shields (1905–1974) remained together until Haines&#x27; death. Joan Crawford described them as &quot;the happiest married couple in Hollywood.&quot;

In 1972 Shields and Haines both travelled to Europe. Haines was diagnosed with lung cancer in the summer of 1973. By December, Haines&#x27;s long-time doctor requested he move into St John&#x27;s Hospital. He would spend the month in hospital until he died on December 26, 1973, at 6:45 pm, of sudden cardiac arrest with Shields beside him.

Following Haines&#x27;s death, his partner Shields struggled to cope. At 9:45 pm on March 6, 1974, Shields began drinking and died of acute barbiturate intoxication. He left a note, inscribed:&quot;Goodbye to all of you who have tried so hard to comfort me in my loss of William Haines, whom I have been with since 1926. I now find it impossible to go it alone, I am much too lonely.&quot;They are interred side by side in Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery in Santa Monica.

== Legacy ==
For his contribution to the motion-picture industry, William Haines has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 7012 Hollywood Blvd.

William Haines Designs remains in operation, with main offices in West Hollywood and an additional showroom in New York.

In September 2023, Sunnylands Center &amp; Gardens featured an exhibition titled &quot;Variations to a Theme&quot; dedicated to William Haines.

== Filmography ==
== In popular culture ==
Haines&#x27; story is told in the 1998 biography &quot;Wisecracker: The Life and Times of William Haines, Hollywood&#x27;s First Openly Gay Star&quot; by William J. Mann. His designs are the subject of Peter Schifando and Haines associate Jean H. Mathison&#x27;s 2005 book &quot;Class Act: William Haines Legendary Hollywood Decorator&quot;.

World of Wonder produced &quot;Out of the Closet, Off the Screen: The Life of William Haines&quot;, which aired on American Movie Classics in 2001.

In October 2015, Karina Longworth chronicled Haines in the episode &quot;William Haines and Hollywood&#x27;s First Openly Gay Marriage&quot;, which she included in her 15-part series of MGM stories for her podcast &quot;You Must Remember This&quot;. Haines was voiced by actor Wil Wheaton.

Playwright Claudio Macor created the biographical drama &quot;The Tailor-Made Man&quot; in the mid-1990s in London, telling the story of Haines&#x27; discovery in a talent contest, his movie career, its curtailment by Louis B. Mayer, and Haines&#x27; re-invention as an interior designer. The play tells the story of his 50-year relationship with Jimmie Shields. The play premiered at London&#x27;s tiny Hen and Chickens theatre and quickly transferred to Battersea Arts Centre. Over the years the play has been produced at London&#x27;s Cockpit Theatre, off-Broadway in New York, San Diego&#x27;s Diversionary Theatre in California in 1995. It was revived in a successful anniversary production in 2017 at London&#x27;s White Bear Theatre, directed by Bryan Hodgson. In 2013 a musical adaptation of &quot;The Tailor-Made Man&quot; opened at London&#x27;s Arts Theatre in the West End with pop star Faye Tozer (Steps) as Marion Davies and Mike McShane as Mayer.

In 1994, &quot;The Tailor-Made Man&quot; was chosen for a workshop TV production for Thames Television Masterpiece Pilot Showcase, directed by Golden Rose of Montreux winner Chris Bould. Bould returned to direct the UK radio adaptation of the play starring Judd Hirsch as Mayer. In 2017, to tie-in with the anniversary production, the definitive playscript was published by theatrical publisher Oberon Books.

<doc id="566463" wikidata="Q323873" url="?curid=566463" title="Trincomalee">
<text>Trincomalee (; ; ), historically known as Gokanna and Gokarna, is the administrative headquarters of the Trincomalee District and major resort port city of Eastern Province, Sri Lanka. Located on the east coast of the island overlooking the Trincomalee Harbour, Trincomalee has been one of the main centres of Sri Lankan Tamil speaking culture on the island for nearly a millennium. With a population of 99,135, the city is built on a peninsula of the same name, which divides its inner and outer harbours. It is home to the famous Koneswaram temple from where it developed and earned its historic Tamil name &quot;Thirukonamalai&quot;. The town is home to other historical monuments such as the Bhadrakali Amman Temple, Trincomalee, the Trincomalee Hindu Cultural Hall and, opened in 1897, the Trincomalee Hindu College. Trincomalee is also the site of the Trincomalee railway station and an ancient ferry service to Jaffna and the south side of the harbour at Muttur.

Trincomalee was made into a fortified port town following the Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom, changing hands between the Danish in 1620, the Dutch, the French following a battle of the American Revolutionary War and the British in 1795, being absorbed into the British Ceylon state in 1815. The city&#x27;s architecture shows some of the best examples of interaction between native and European styles. Attacked by the Japanese as part of the Indian Ocean raid during World War II in 1942, the city and district were affected after Sri Lanka gained independence in 1948, when the political relationship between Tamil and Sinhalese people deteriorated, erupting into civil war. It is home to major naval and air force bases at the Trincomalee Garrison. The city also has the largest Dutch fort on the island.

The Trincomalee Bay, bridged by the Mahavilli Ganga River to the south, the historical &quot;Gokarna&quot; in Sanskrit, means &quot;Cow&#x27;s Ear&quot;, akin to other sites of Siva worship across the Indian subcontinent. Uniquely, Trincomalee is a Pancha Ishwaram, a Paadal Petra Sthalam, a Maha Shakta pitha and Murugan Tiruppadai of Sri Lanka; its sacred status to the Hindus has led to it being declared &quot;Dakshina-Then Kailasam&quot; or &quot;Mount Kailash of the South&quot; and the &quot;Rome of the Pagans of the Orient&quot;. The harbour is renowned for its large size and security; unlike any other in the Indian Ocean, it is accessible in all weathers to all craft. It has been described as the &quot;finest harbour in the world&quot; and by the British, &quot;the most valuable colonial possession on the globe, as giving to our Indian Empire a security which it had not enjoyed from elsewhere&quot;.

==Names and etymology==
===Trincomalee===
The city has developed from a village settlement on the promontory dedicated to the Hindu shrine. The origin of the term &quot;Ko&quot;, &quot;Kone&quot; and &quot;Konatha&quot; lies in the Old Tamil word for the terms &quot;Lord&quot;, &quot;King&quot; or &quot;Chief&quot;, which allude to the deity that presides here; this term appears in several Tamil Brahmi inscriptions of the 6th century BCE — 2nd century CE. Trincomalee, the coastal peninsula town where Koneswaram is located is an anglicized form of the old Tamil word &quot;Thiru-kona-malai&quot; (), meaning &quot;Lord of the Sacred Hill&quot;, its earliest reference in this form found in the &quot;Tevaram&quot; of the 7th century by Sambandhar. &quot;Thiru&quot; is a generally used epithet denoting a &quot;sacred&quot; temple site while &quot;Malai&quot; means mountain or hill; Middle Tamil manuscripts and inscriptions mention the monumental compound shrine as the &quot;Thirukonamalai Konesar Kovil&quot;. &quot;Kona&quot; () has other meanings in Old Tamil such as &quot;peak&quot;, while another origin for the term &quot;Koneswaram&quot; could come from the Tamil term &quot;Kuna&quot; (East). Therefore, other translators suggest definitions of Trincomalee such as &quot;sacred angular/peaked hill&quot;, &quot;sacred eastern hill&quot; or &quot;three peaked hill&quot;. The temple was constructed atop Swami Rock, also called Swami Malai or Kona-ma-malai, a cliff on the peninsula that drops 400 feet (120 metres) directly into the sea.

===Gokarna Bay, Trincomalee===
The Trincomalee Harbour, a circular natural harbour which the temple crowns towards the north, is referred to as &quot;Ko-Kannam&quot; or &quot;Lord&#x27;s Cheek&quot;, alluding to the cheek shape of Shiva&#x27;s bull Nandi. The Sanskrit equivalent of the port town&#x27;s harbour bay is &quot;Go-Karna&quot;, meaning &quot;Cow&#x27;s Ear&quot; or &quot;Gokarna Pattana&quot; and the deity&#x27;s name &quot;Gokarneswara&quot; or &quot;Go—Natha&quot; in Sanskrit. Pathmanathan offers the etymological link &quot;Thiru-Gokarna-Malai&quot; or &quot;Thiru-Gona-Malai&quot; based on this connection. 

The ethnographer Megasthenes writing in his &quot;Indica&quot; from 350 — 290 BCE, describes the island as being divided by a long river, productive of a large number of gold and pearls in one half and that the inhabitants of this country are called &quot;Paleogoni&quot;, meaning &quot;Old Goni&quot; in Tamil and Greek, who Pliny adds worshipped Hercules and Dionysus (Bacchus) like the Pandyans of Tamilakam. The &quot;Vayu Purana&quot;, written in 300 CE specifically mentions the tallest mountain peak of the great gold and silver rich mountain range &quot;Malaya&quot; on the island, and that &quot;to the east of this island at the shore of the sea lies a great Siva temple in a holy place called &quot;Gokarna&quot;.&quot; The bay is also referred to as &quot;Gokaranna&quot; according to a Sanskrit inscription in Grantha script excavated on a doorjamb at the Hindu temple dated to Tamil New Years Day 1223 CE. &quot;Gokarna&quot; is also a place name in Karnataka, India, Kalinga, Tamil Nadu and Nepal all associated with ancient Shiva temples. The associated Bhadrakali Amman Temple of Trincomalee, significantly expanded by Rajendra Chola I, stands on Konesar Road before the entrance to Swami Rock.

===Kailaas of the South===
Heralded as &quot;Dakshina Kailasam&quot;/&quot;Then Kailasam&quot; (Kailaas of the South) because it lies on exactly the same longitude as the Tibetan mountain Mount Kailash (the primary abode of Shiva), Trincomalee&#x27;s traditional history and legends were compiled into the Sanskrit treatises &quot;Dakshina Kailasa Puranam — Sthala Puranam of Koneswaram&quot;, written in 1380 by Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan, and the &quot;Dakshina Kailasa Manmiam&quot; — three chapters of the &quot;Skanda Puranam&quot; of unknown antiquity — manuscripts of which have been discovered and dated from the 5th — 7th century. It was in the &quot;Puranas&quot; that the shrine first found reference as &quot;Koneiswara Parwatia&quot;, motivating Kullakottan Chola who learnt of its sanctity to sail to Trincomalee and develop the three Hindu temples of the Koneswaram compound. The compiler of the Yoga Sutras, Patañjali&#x27;s place of birth at the temple corroborates Tirumular&#x27;s &quot;Tirumandhiram&quot;, which describes him as hailing from &quot;Then Kailasam&quot; and his self description as a &quot;Gonardiya&quot; from &quot;Gonarda&quot;, &quot;a country in the southern and eastern division&quot; of the Indian continent. Both men were ardent disciples of Nandi. The &quot;Konesar Kalvettu&quot; uses the term &quot;Tiri Kayilai&quot;, meaning &quot;three Kailasams&quot;, &quot;Tiri Kutam&quot; and &quot;Tiri Konam&quot; for Trincomalee, in a number of places, referring to the three pagodas on the promontory of Trincomalee.

As per another legend, Vayu Bhaghvan and Adiseshan had a dispute to find out who is superior, to prove the superiority adiseshan encircled the Kailasam, Vayu tried to remove this encircle by creating santamarutham (Twister). Due to the santamarutham, eight (8) kodumudigal (parts) fell from kailasam into 8 different places: are Thirugonamalai (Trincomalee), Thirukalahasti, Thiruchiramalai, Thiruenkoimalai, Rajathagiri, Neerthagiri, Ratnagiri, and Suwethagiri Thirupangeeli.

==History==
===Earliest history===



Trincomalee which is a natural deep-water harbour has attracted seafarers, trader and pilgrims from Europe, Middle East, Africa, China, East Asia and Australasia since ancient times. Trinco, as it is commonly called, has been a seaport since 400 BCE. The earliest epigraphical inscriptions found in Trincomalee city are in the Tamil language. The Tamil settlement at the port of Trincomalee was one of the oldest settlements on the island. One inscription from 900 to 1000 CE belonging to the Chola Dynasty excavated near where the promontory&#x27;s first temple stood is from a sluice and also concerns Koneswaram, as do the 10th century Nilaveli inscriptions.

Ancient texts, as well as an inscription unearthed by archeologists among its Hindu archaeological remains, call it &quot;Gokarna&quot; in Sanskrit. Over its long history, Trincomalee, and specifically the Swami Rock promontory, has housed several Kovil temples to deities of the Hindu pantheon, as well as a Buddhist vihara and a Christian Catholic church, both introduced following invasions. A descendant of Ellalan of Anuradhapura, Kulakkottan, directed renovations of the Hindu temples and oversaw settlement of Tamils for their upkeep. Sacrificial and other cult practices at the Trincomalee promontory have been documented since the Yakkha period, and were noted during the reigns of Pandukabhaya of Anuradhapura, Maha Naga of Anuradhapura and Manavanna of Anuradhapura until the publication of &quot;The Life of Alexander Alexander&quot; in 1830. The worship of Eiswara is noted to have been the original worship of the island and the deity worshiped by Kuveni, the ancient Yakkha queen; Charles Pridham, Jonathan Forbes and George Turnour state that it is probable there is no more ancient form of worship existing than that of Eiswara upon his sacred promontory.

In the earliest known literary reference to the Siva temple, &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the Hindu epic written between 400 and 100 BCE, the temple of Gokarna bay is in the middle of the ocean and is the island shrine of Uma&#x27;s consort, known in the three worlds and worshiped by all natives of the island including the Nagas, Yakkhas, Siddhars and Devas, peoples from the subcontinent, the rivers, ocean and mountains. Fasting there for three nights in worship of Siva as Ishana, one acquireth the merit of the horse-sacrifice, and the status of &quot;Ganapatya&quot;. By staying there for twelve nights, one&#x27;s soul is cleansed of all sins. &quot;Mahabharata&quot; continues that the shrine is the next pilgrimage spot for Hindus en route south following Kanyakumari of the early Pandyan kingdom and Tamraparni island (Kudiramalai). In the same time period, the &quot;Ramayana&quot; in written form describes how King Ravana and his mother had worshipped Siva at the shrine, when the former wanted to remove the temple of Koneswaram when his mother was in ailing health around 2000 BCE. This literature continues that as the king was heaving the rock, Lord Siva made him drop his sword. As a result of this a cleft was created on the rock, today called &quot;Ravana Vettu&quot; – meaning &quot;Ravana&#x27;s Cleft&quot;. Upon her death, her last rites were performed at the Kanniya Hot water springs in the Kanniya suburb of Trincomalee city.

The Siva-worshipping Siddhar Patanjali&#x27;s birth at the city in 180 BCE and its connections to another Siddhar Agastya from at least the 5th–4th century BCE suggests that Yoga Sun Salutation originated on the promontory of Trincomalee. One of Trincomalee&#x27;s suburbs, Kankuveli is home to ruins of the Tamil Siddhar medical university established by Agastya, the &quot;Agathiyar Thapanam&quot;, which alongside his other shrines at Sivan Oli Padam Malai, helped spread Tamraparniyan science across the continent during the pre-classical era. The &quot;Vayu Purana&quot; refers to the Siva temple on &quot;Trikuta&quot; hill on the eastern coast of Lanka once again in the 3rd century.
Another mention is found in the 5th century CE &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; where King Vijaya brought his nephew Panduvasdeva to land at the bay in the 4th century BC. The &quot;Yalpana Vaipava Malai&quot; asserts that Vijaya restored the Koneswaram temple and the other four Eswarams upon arrival. Mahasena of Anuradhapura, according to the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; and the later &quot;Culavamsa&quot;, destroyed the devalaya temple compound in Trincomalee housing Siva lingas in it, and built a Mahayana Buddhist edifice in its stead. He destroyed the Hindu temple to appease monks of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya who themselves had been antagonized by Mahasen. He worked under the tutelage of Sangamitta, the Tamil Buddhist monk from the early Chola country, who had intervened to avenge the persecution of Vetullavada adherents during the Tamraparniyan Abhayagiri versus Maha Viharaya sectarianism in Anuradhapura. This explains some of the Buddhist archeological remains in the region. By the reign of Silakala Ambosamanera of Anuradhapura, Trincomalee bay again is mentioned as the furthest spot down the river Mahavalli Ganga which must be protected from &quot;the enemy in Rohana&quot;; and Trincomalee is noted as a theatre of magic, where Naga snakes were manifested to foretell the consecration of Maha Naga of Anuradhapura. It was not long before the Siva temple&#x27;s concurrent re-establishment on the promontory by the 6th century following the rise of the Pallava dynasty. The &quot;Mattakallappu Manmiyam&quot; of Batticaloa confirms Trincomalee&#x27;s sacred status for all Hindus.

===Middle Ages===
Early Tamil dynasties continued to employ the city as the prefectural capital of the Trincomalee District, allowing administrative duties to be handled by elected Vanniar chiefs. Inscriptions of Kassapa IV, Udaya III and Mahinda IV of Anuradhapura, reveal that lands and villages of Tamils in the island&#x27;s northeast were prospering, particularly following Srimara Srivallabha&#x27;s intervention against Sena I of Anuradhapura. The Pallava kings, including Simhavishnu and Narasimhavarman I were important in the early history of Trincomalee because of the increased significance of the city to Hinduism and trade in the early centuries of the common era, making sure to contribute elements of their unique style of Dravidian architecture to the city. During the reign of Mahendravarman I in 600, as one Aggabodhi II of Anuradhapura took steps to attack the Vanniar chiefs between Trincomalee and Mannar, &quot;Tevaram&quot; hymns were composed on the two holy cities, one of which, written by Sambandar, lauded the deity of the temples in each and lamented the schemes of other heretical faiths encroaching on Trincomalee. Mahendravarman I gave much assistance and military aid to his friend Manavanna of Anuradhapura, and he proceeded to build a twin temple called Kokarneswarar Temple, Thirukokarnam in Pudukkottai, Tamil Nadu.

Following the conquest of Parantaka I in 950, Rajaraja Chola I and Rajendra Chola I oversaw the city&#x27;s development when under their empire. A significant expansion of the Bhadrakali Amman Temple, Trincomalee by Rajendra Chola I increased pilgrimage to the city. Trincomalee was used by Chola king Ilankesvarar Tevar as his eastern port in the 11th century and prospered under the Vannimai chieftaincies of the Jaffna kingdom. Two powerful merchant guilds of the time – the Manigramam and the Five Hundred Lords of Ayyavolu emerged in the region during Chola trade with the far east and the conquest of Srivijaya of the Malay Archipelago. 

The Koneswaram temple compounds, the city and its adjacent region, from Periyakulam and Manankerni in the north, Kantalai and Pothankadu in the west, and Verugal in the south, formed a great Saiva Tamil principality of the island&#x27;s state Mummudi Chola Mandalam. Residents in this collective community were allotted services, which they had to perform at the Koneswaram temple. A Jain sect in Nilaveli had even complained to Gajabahu II about the priests of Koneswaram. Following some benefaction of the shrine by Gajabahu II, his successor King Parakramabahu I used Trincomalee as his eastern port, to launch a successful invasion of Burma in the 12th century. Kalinga Magha used the city as a garrison point during his rule. The city was governed by Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan I and Jatavarman Veera Pandyan I of the Pandyans in the 13th century, despite invasions from and the eventual subduing of Chandrabhanu and Savakanmaindan of Tambralinga of Thailand; it then remained in the Pandyan empire of Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I and remnants of Pandyan art and architecture still stand in Trincomalee.

Magha&#x27;s reign ousted Parakrama Pandyan II and re-consolidated Tamil sovereign power in the island&#x27;s north, north west and north east in Trincomalee by 1215; during Magha&#x27;s reign, the temple and city underwent rich development in the name of a Chodaganga Deva on Puthandu, 1223. After the fall of the Pandyans of Tamilakam due to invasions by Muhammad bin Tughluq of the Delhi Sultanate, Trincomalee rose in status in the Jaffna kingdom, often visited by King Singai Pararasasegaram and his successor King Cankili I in the following centuries. 

Trincomalee served a similar purpose to its west coast sister city, Mannar. King Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan had the traditional history of the Koneswaram temple compiled as a chronicle in verse, titled &quot;Dakshina Kailasa Puranam&quot;, known today as the &quot;Sthala Puranam of Koneswaram Temple&quot;. Mariners were particularly excited when observing the massive shrine from afar in the sea. Building blocks from the city were used to expand the Kovil at Rameswaram under the patronage of king Gunaveera Cinkaiariyan. At this time, Trincomalee was trading pearls, precious stones, vessels, elephants, muslins, baqam and cinnamon, and was passed by Chinese voyager Ma Huan by ship, eight days from the Nicobar islands, on his way to Tenavaram temple. The Tamil country had established a strong alliance with Yemen and the Delhi Sultinate under Martanda Cinkaiariyan which attracted seafaring merchants from East Africa and the Middle East to its ports. An inlet of Trincomalee, Nicholson Cove became the site of a small Arab settlement by the 13th and 14th century. The Nicholson Cove Tombstone inscriptions at Trincomalee refer to the deceased as the daughter of the chief Badriddin Husain Bin Ali Al-Halabi, showing that her family hailed from Halab (Aleppo) in Syria. The Tamil Bell of New Zealand assigned to the Pandyan era belonged to sea traders that likely originated from Trincomalee. The city even attracted Arunagirinathar in 1468, who traversed the Pada Yatra pilgrimage route from Nallur Kandaswamy temple to Katirkamam while stopping to pay homage to Koneswaram&#x27;s Murukan shrine.

By the late 16th century, Portuguese Ceylon was beginning to influence the operations of the now princely Trincomalee district. Despite it being one of the smaller states of the island, given as an appenage to younger sons of royal houses and still being dependent on the Jaffna kingdom, the city had become one of the richest and the most visited place of Hindu worship in the world, declared the &quot;Rome of the Pagans of the Orient&quot; and &quot;Rome of the Gentiles&quot; by the Portuguese. It hosted the Hindu funeral of Bhuvanekabahu VII of Kotte. The death of one of its kings, Vanniana Raja of Trincomalee, left his young son, the Prince of Trincomalee under the guardianship of his uncle. Trincomalee was annexed by Cankili I to bring it back under Jaffna control, forcing the boy king into exile. He was eventually baptised as Raja Alphonsus of Trincomalee and taken under the wing of the missionary Francis Xavier. The rise of Francis Xavier and the migration of Portuguese soldiers to Trincomalee, conversions to Christianity by some residents and royals in the 1500s saw the erection of churches in the city. Koneswaram is described by Jesuit priests at this time as being a &quot;... massive structure, a singular work of art. It is of great height, constructed with wonderful skill in blackish granite, on a rock projecting into the sea, and occupies a large space on the summit&quot;. 

The Trincomalee and Batticaloa chiefdoms starting paying direct tributes to the Portuguese commander in Mannar from 1582 as Portuguese influence over the entire North east gained momentum. An annual sum of 1280 fanams was levied from the Koneswaram temple, and they collected a duty on areca nuts exported through the Trincomalee and Batticaloa ports. Jaffna had given minimal logistical access to its Trincomalee and Batticaloa seaports to the Kandyan kingdom to secure military advantages against its enemies; this was used by their influential European overlords to consolidate power in the region. In 1603, the first Dutch fleet arrives at Trincomalee and Batticaloa ports.

In 1612, D. Hieronymo de Azevedo, after great difficulties due to torrential rains, arrived at Trincomalee with a Portuguese contingent from Kandy. Here de Azevedo &quot;was keen on building a fort&quot; to the scope; he called in aid from King Ethirimana Cinkam of Jaffna but not seeing him, he abandoned the enterprise and he marched towards Jaffna. The early death of Cankili I brought upon by the Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom saw all the territory of the kingdom of Jaffna, comprising both Trincomalee and Batticaloa, assigned to the &quot;spiritual cures of the Franciscans&quot;. The Jesuits followed the Portuguese soldiers to Trincomalee and Batticaloa when they occupied the two localities.

===Early modern===

The buildings of Trincomalee were of masonry, thatched with leaves of bamboo and rattan, although the Pagodas and the Palace of the King were covered with copper, silver and gold. The metropolis had grown with well-built houses and streets that were cleaned regularly and were well adorned. The Danish arrived in Trincomalee at the end of 1619 with a first ship, called &quot;Øresund&quot; under the command of Roelant Crape. This small expedition was the vanguard of another Danish fleet, composed of four vessels and 300 soldiers, commanded by Ove Giedde, that reached the island in May 1620. They wanted to try their fortune in the Asian seas; the Danish expedition occupied Koneswaram temple. It was here that the Danes began the works for the fortification of the peninsula.

Following the destruction of the Koneswaram compound and the &quot;Fort of Triquinimale&quot; built from its ruins, Trincomalee had a Portuguese force during the reign of Rajasinghe II of Kandy. Constantino de Sá de Noronha who destroyed one of the temples had a copy of the oldest inscription in Tamil Brahmi sent to Portugal for the purpose of identification. The Tamil inscription contains a prophecy on the city and its temple, a copy of which was sent and is retained in The Hague. In a 1638 letter to Dutch Colonial Governor Anthony van Diemen, an officer mentions that Trincomalee is a &quot;fort built rather strongly of hard stones from an old pagoda round the hillock. On each side there is a sandy and rocky bay and it is like a peninsula&quot;. Rajasinghe finally formed an alliance with the Dutch, who captured the Fort of Triquinimale in 1639 and handed it to the Kandyans for destruction in 1643. In 1660, the Dutch built the present Fort Fredrick at the foot of the promontory which they called Pagoda Hill, and another fort at the mouth of the harbour home to Dutch officers, Fort Ostenburg. An English sea captain and his son, the writer named Robert Knox, came ashore by chance near Trincomalee and were captured and held in captivity by the Kandyan king in 1659. The Kandyans then pursued a scorched earth policy to try and oust the Dutch and take Trincomalee and Batticaloa on the east coast. The French set up base in Trincomalee in the Spring of 1672, and tried to make overtures to the Kandyans, but an alliance was not sealed; by July 1672, Trincomalee was retaken by the Dutch fleet.

The city had rejoined the Coylot Vanni Country by the start of the 18th century, with much of the city&#x27;s population having moved across the district following the temple&#x27;s destruction. It was about three centuries after Norochcho and Knox that serious attempts at translating the temple&#x27;s ancient writings were made. The Dutch ruled the Tamil country with increased focus on districts like the Vannimai, Trincomalee and Batticaloa; the Vanniar chiefs of Trincomalee and the rest of the Vanni became subordinates and were put back under the commandment of Jaffna with a large degree of autonomy, but forced to pay forty elephants a year to the Dutch company. As tributaries, they recovered from Portuguese rule slowly under Dutch rule, and the Batticaloa district served as a dependency of the Fort of Trincomalee until 1782. The state of the region and the Tamils fears for the town and the Kantalai tank is described in considerable detail by the Dutch Governor of Trincomalee, J. F. Van Senden, in the diary of his visit in June 1786 with a view to revitalising agricultural production around the Trincomalee district. The population was a shadow of what it had been in times of prosperity. What he saw were people who had lost much of their traditional skill and often living close to subsistence level. Van Senden made the first record of the Kankuveli Tamil inscription dealing with a large field dedicated to Koneswaram temple. He was struck by the contrast between the prosperity signified by the inscription and what he then saw in the village. Trincomalee town remained under Vanni administration.

===Late modern and contemporary===

Jacob Burnand, a Swiss soldier in the service of the Dutch and the Governor of Batticaloa, composed a memoir on his administration there in 1794, noting Trincomalee to be an important fortified town in the Tamil nation. Trincomalee&#x27;s fort was occupied by the Dutch for most of the 18th century, and subsequently by the French who fought and won the Battle of Trincomalee as part of the American Revolutionary War in 1782 at the city.

On 8 January 1782, the British captured Trincomalee&#x27;s forts from the Dutch, the first place on the island they captured. The French recaptured it on 29 August of the same year after the Battle of Trincomalee. In 1783 the French ceded it to the British and subsequently, Britain ceded Trincomalee back to the Dutch Republic under the 1783 Peace of Paris. In 1795 the British recaptured the city and held it until Sri Lanka&#x27;s independence in 1948, with a claimed aim of &quot;preventing Napoleon invading the colony&quot; if left under the Dutch. Their rule is sealed with the Treaty of Amiens, and the last Vanniar, Pandara Vannian is executed by the British – a pension is paid to his widow, the Vannichi, until the late 19th century. The British officer Alexander Johnston discovered a stone epigraph, the oldest of the province of Trincomalee District, in ancient characters concerning the traditional founder of Trincomalee and the temple, Kullakottan Chola. The French admiral Pierre André de Suffren de Saint Tropez, when with his fleet in the city in 1781 had sent a copy of the inscription to Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron of France for translation.

The ship was built during the early 19th century by Indian workers to aid them in the Napoleonic Wars, and named after the city. The importance of Fort Fredrick was due to Trincomalee&#x27;s natural harbour. Through Trincomalee, it was believed a strong naval force could secure control of India&#x27;s Coromandel Coast and the rest of the Indian Ocean. The British admiral Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson called Trincomalee &quot;the finest harbour in the world&quot;, while the British Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger called the city &quot;the most valuable colonial possession on the globe, as giving to our Indian Empire a security which it had not enjoyed from its establishment&quot; and the harbour &quot;the finest and most advantageous Bay in the whole of India&quot;. In the 19th century, the Trincomali Channel of British Columbia, Canada was built and named after the city&#x27;s name. A Tamil press is established in Jaffna in 1820; a report on Trincomalee laments its sorry, poverty-stricken state and recommends &#x27;colonization with intelligent settlers&#x27;. By 1827, The &quot;Return of the Population 1824&quot; is published, giving the total population figures for Trincomalee as 19,158 – Tamils and among them 317 Sinhalese. The Vanni, counted under Mannar, has 22,536 inhabitants, among them 517 Sinhalese.

Before the Second World War, the British built a large airfield to house their RAF base, called the RAF China Bay and fuel storage and support facilities for the British fleets there. After the fall of Singapore, Trincomalee became the home port of the Eastern Fleet of the Royal Navy, and submarines of the Dutch Navy. Trincomalee harbour and airfield were attacked by a carrier fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy in April 1942 in the Indian Ocean Raid of the war. However, the installation later served as an important launching point for British naval operations in 1944 and 1945.

One of the places inhabited by the British was Fort Fredrick, now controlled by the Sri Lankan Army. Some of the old buildings in the fort were used as residences, including one previously occupied by the Duke of Wellington. In the early 1950s the British Government built groups of bungalows within the fort specifically for their employees. These bungalows today provide accommodation for the Sri Lankan Army. There was a large Naval Hospital which catered for sick and injured British naval personnel from all over the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf.

With the turn of the modern era, English authors and poets used Trincomalee as inspiration for literature and poetry and became connected with the city. Arthur C. Clarke, who discovered the temple&#x27;s underwater ruins with photographer Mike Wilson, described the city and the ruins in &quot;Reefs of Taprobane&quot; and would go on to write &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; based on his experiences in the city. Trincomalee&#x27;s Bhadrakali Amman temple provides a setting in Wilbur Smith&#x27;s novel &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;. Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes stories feature multiple settings in the city, including in &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; and &quot;A Singular Affair at Trincomalee&quot;. Jane Austen&#x27;s younger brother, Charles, of the British Royal Navy is buried in Trincomalee.

===Post independence===

In 1950, one of the original shrine&#x27;s gold and copper alloy bronze statues from the 10th century CE of a seated figure of Shiva (in the form of Somaskanda), Shiva as Chandrasekhar, his consort goddess Parvati, a statue of the goddess Mathumai Ambal and later Lord Ganesh were found by the Urban Council of Trincomalee buried 500 yards from the promontory&#x27;s end while digging for a water well. They were taken in procession around the region before being reinstalled amid opening ceremonies in one of the newly restored shrines of the compound on 3 March 1963. The naval and air bases were taken over by Sri Lanka in 1957. Following independence from Britain, the political relationship between Tamils and Sinhalese deteriorated across the island. Interest surrounding Trincomalee was increased due to its geostrategic position and the discovery of its underwater and land Hindu ruins. In 1968, the unity government of majority Sinhalese dominated United National Party and the minority Tamil dominated ITAK Federal Party collapsed over disagreements about declaring the holy Hindu site a protected area. A committee appointed by a Federal Party Minister to study the viability of declaring the site protected was disbanded without consultation by the prime minister at the time, Dudley Senanayake. The Federal Party withdrew its support to the government following that action. According to journalists like T. Sabaratnam, this incident had severe repercussions alongside the contributing factors of the civil war. The city and its district were severely affected by the 30-year civil war that followed.

In the mid-1980s, India became concerned that the US Navy might gain access to Trincomalee. India was suspicious about goodwill visits by the US Navy to the port and Sri Lankan proposals to contract out the refurbishment of oil storage tanks and modernisation of port facilities at Trincomalee. On 3 March 2023, President Ranil Wickremesinghe instructed the petroleum minister and officials to promptly implement a strategy to revitalize the Trincomalee oil tank farm and integrate it into the nation&#x27;s economy.

Today SLNS Tissa and SLN Dockyard are used by the Sri Lankan Navy, while the Sri Lanka Air Force is based at China Bay Airport. The Sri Lanka Army has its Security Forces Headquarters - East in Trincomalee. The Trincomalee War Cemetery is one of the six commonwealth war cemeteries in Sri Lanka. It is maintained by Sri Lankan Ministry of Defence on behalf of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The base is home to a naval museum called the Hoods Tower Museum. The name refers to a watchtower built on a hill commanding a 360-degree view of the harbor and the bay.

In the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Trincomalee was a focal point for relief efforts on the eastern coast of Sri Lanka.

== Historical sites ==

Trincomalee is sacred to Sri Lankan Tamils and Hindus around the world. The city has many Hindu sites of historical importance. These sites are sacred to the Hindus and some Buddhists also worship at these Hindu sites.

Prominent sites include the Koneswaram temple compound, its Bhadrakali temple on Konesar Road, and the Salli Muthumariamman Kovil of Uppuveli beach in the Trincomalee suburb of Sambalativu.

=== Hindu historical sites ===
The Koneswaram temple, with a recorded history from the 3rd century BCE and legends attesting to classical antiquity attracted pilgrims from all parts of India. The shrine itself was demolished in 1622 by the Portuguese (who called it the Temple of a Thousand Columns), and who fortified the heights with the materials derived from its destruction. Some of the artifacts from the demolished temple were kept in the Lisbon Museum including the stone inscription by Kulakottan (Kunakottan). The site&#x27;s ruins include an emblem including two fish and is engraved with a prophecy stating that, after the 16th century, westerners with different eye colours will rule the country for 500 years and, at the end of it, rule will revert to the northerners (&quot;Vadukkus&quot;. The Hindu temple was also documented in several medieval texts such as the &quot;Konesar Kalvettu&quot; and the &quot;Dakshina Kailasa Puranam&quot;.

=== The Dutch Fort ===
The entrance to the roadway leading to Koneswaram is actually the entrance to what used to be Fort Fredrick. The fort was built in 1623 by the Portuguese and captured in 1639 by the Dutch. It then went through a phase of dismantling and reconstruction and was attacked and captured by the British in 1782, during the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. The French then took it from the British, and handed it back to the Dutch for a large sum of money. In 1795, when the French had occupied the Dutch Republic during the War of the First Coalition, it was again taken over by the British, who named it Fort Frederick.

==Harbour==
Trincomalee&#x27;s strategic importance has shaped its recent history. The great European powers vied for mastery of the harbour. The Portuguese, the Dutch, the French, and the British, each held it in turn, and there have been many sea battles nearby.

The harbour, the fifth largest natural harbour in the world, is overlooked by terraced highlands, its entrance is guarded by two headlands, and there is a carriage road along its northern and eastern edges.

===Oil depot===
In 2015, India and Sri Lanka agreed to develop South Asia&#x27;s largest oil depot at a port near Trincomalee. Indian Oil Corporation will work with the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation to develop the Upper Tank Farm at the abandoned World War II port, known as China Bay.

===Beaches===

Trincomalee has some of the most picturesque and scenic beaches found in Sri Lanka, relatively unspoilt and clean. The area is famous for bathing and swimming, owing to the relative shallowness of the sea, allowing one to walk out over a hundred meters into the sea without the water reaching the chest. Whale watching is a common pastime in the seas off Trincomalee, and successful sightings are on the rise with the increase of tourism in the area.

Marble Beach is located 16 km (10 miles) from Trincomalee.

===Hot springs===
There are the seven hot springs of Kanniya (Kan = stone; niya = land), on the road to Trincomalee. A high wall bounds the rectangular enclosure which includes all seven springs. Each is in turn enclosed by a dwarf wall to form a well.

==Climate==
Trincomalee features a tropical wet and dry climate (&quot;As&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification. The city features a dry season from April through August and a wet season for the remainder of the year. The city sees on average roughly of precipitation annually. Average temperatures in Trincomalee range from around in December and January to approximately during the warmest months of the year from April through September. Extreme temperatures in the city range from on 9 December 2022 to on 13 May 1890.

Its transmitter were mostly used by the Adventist World Radio.

<text>Riff Raff was a British progressive rock band formed by keyboardist Tommy Eyre in 1972. The band was a continuation on the back of drummers (and Harrow School of Art friends) Rod Coombes&#x27; and Joe Czarnecki (aka Joe Peter)&#x27;s project originally called &#x27;Crikey&#x27; which started in 1969 and completed in 1970, when Coombes had to accept growing tour commitments with Juicy Lucy. These sessions comprised half of the Riff Raff album &quot;Outside Looking In&quot;, in which Coombes wrote half the songs.

Riff Raff later went on to release two albums to lukewarm response; however, their use of jazz and hard-edged rock garnered them a large underground following. Riff Raff also released the single &quot;Copper Kettle&quot;.

<doc id="566467" wikidata="Q2357272" url="?curid=566467" title="Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group">
<text>The Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group, known by the French acronym GICM (&quot;Groupe Islamique Combattant Marocain&quot;), was a Sunni Islamist militant organization that operated in Morocco, North Africa, and Western Europe. The organization&#x27;s objective was to establish an Islamic government in Morocco.

GICM was established in 1998 after Arab Afghan veteran fighters, who had fought alongside the &quot;Afghan Mujahideen&quot;, returned to Morocco with the objective of forming a militant organization. GICM and its associated members have been linked to the 2003 Casablanca bombings and the 2004 Madrid train bombings. A major crackdown against the organization&#x27;s numerous cells in Europe is thought to have since significantly damaged the GICM&#x27;s capabilities. By 2013, the group had become defunct, with the United States no longer considering it a functional organization.

==History==
===Background===
The GICM was founded in the 1990s by Moroccan recruits from al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan and former Mujahideen veterans from the Soviet–Afghan War. Formed as a splinter group of the Harakat al-Islamiya al-Maghrebiya al-Mukatila (HASM) and Shabiba al-Islamiya groups, the GICM&#x27;s stated goal was to establish an Islamic state in Morocco. The group gained its finances from criminal activities such as robberies, extortions, document forgery, illegal drug trade and arms trafficking through North Africa and Europe. One early cell affiliated with the group was responsible for killing two Spanish tourists at the Atlas Asni Hotel in Marrakesh in August 1994. The ideological leader of the group was Ahmed Rafiki ( Abou Hodeifa), who was responsible for organizing Moroccan fighters in Afghanistan.

===Attacks linked to GICM===
Along with other Al-Qaeda affiliates, GICM was banned worldwide by the UN 1267 Committee in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001. The group was later linked to several terrorist attacks. In 2003 twelve suicide bombers from the associated group Salafia Jihadia were responsible for coordinated suicide bombings in Casablanca that killed 33 people. At least eight of the people convicted after the bombings were accused of being members of the GICM. Noureddine Nafia, an important early leader of the group was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and Saad Houssaini, the group&#x27;s suspected military committee chief (arrested in 2007) was sentenced to 15 years.

A year after the Casablanca bombings, the GICM became the principal suspect after the 2004 Madrid train bombings that killed 191 people and wounded over 2,000. A cell linked to the attacks was affiliated with the GICM through Youssef Belhadj and Hassan el-Haski, who were based in Belgium. A main perpetrator, Jamal Zougam had met GICM leaders including (a.k.a. Abou Issa) in the United Kingdom, and Abdelaziz Benyaich in Morocco.

The group has also been linked to the 2007 Casablanca bombings. Also active with recruiting jihadist fighters to Iraq, the GICM has been responsible for attacks including at least one suicide bombing against the Multi-National Force – Iraq.

==Activities and cells==
A large part of the GICM&#x27;s membership was drawn from the Moroccan diaspora in Western Europe, where it was involved in a number of terrorist plots. The organization in Europe is based in the United Kingdom, but has had numerous cells, including sleeper cells in Spain, Belgium, Italy, France, Denmark, Turkey, Egypt and the Netherlands.

The European organization is thought to have been led by British national Mohammed al-Guerbouzi, who in 2001 was arrested by Iranian authorities and extradited to the United Kingdom, and later sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; to 20 years in prison in Morocco for his role in the 2003 Casablanca bombings. A Belgian cell led by Abdelkader Hakimi, Lahoussine el-Haski, Mostafa Louanani, and eight other men were convicted in 2006. Members of the GICM have also been arrested in Spain and France. Four members were arrested in the Canary Islands in December 2004, suspected of preparing to establish a new base for the group. The Catalonia-based Rabet and Nakcha groups, which recruited suicide bombers to Iraq were dismantled in 2005 and 2006. In Paris, thirteen people suspected of links to the GICM were arrested in 2004. The imam of a mosque in Varese, Italy suspected of raising money and recruiting for the GICM was extradited to Morocco in 2008. According to the Federal Police of Brazil, GICM is one of seven Islamic terrorist groups active in the country, and in the border area with Argentina and Paraguay. The group has also operated in Canada.

By 2010, most of the organization&#x27;s leadership had reportedly been imprisoned or killed, although former cells and members at large were still considered a possible threat. Although not officially confirmed, according to some sources the group has joined Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). A cell with 27 members in Tétouan arrested in January 2007 had logistical and financial links to GICM and AQIM. Mohamed Moumou (aka Abu Qaswarah), second-in-command of Al-Qaida in Iraq was originally a key member of the GICM. Karim el-Mejjati, another founding leader of the group, was killed in 2005 after having become a leader of al-Qaeda in Saudi Arabia.

The group was removed from the United States&#x27; list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations in 2013, seemingly confirming its complete dissolution as an entity by that point.

<doc id="566471" wikidata="Q241378" url="?curid=566471" title="Brad Friedel">
<text>Bradley Howard Friedel (born May 18, 1971) is an American professional soccer coach and former player who played as a goalkeeper.

Friedel played 84 games for the United States national team between 1992 and 2005, and represented his country at three FIFA World Cup tournaments. He is the current holder of the Premier League record for most consecutive appearances with 310, a feat he achieved during spells at Blackburn Rovers, Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur. Until he was left out of the Tottenham team on October 7, 2012, the last Premier League games Friedel missed were Blackburn&#x27;s final two fixtures of the 2003–04 season against Tottenham and Birmingham City, on May 10 and 15, 2004, respectively.

Friedel is also officially Aston Villa&#x27;s oldest-ever player, a record he set on February 1, 2011, by playing in the club&#x27;s Premier League fixture away at Manchester United. Friedel&#x27;s age of 39 years and 259 days surpassed the previous record held by Ernie Callaghan, who last played for Villa against Grimsby Town in April 1947, aged 39 years and 257 days. Friedel&#x27;s last appearance for Villa was on May 22, 2011, in a 1–0 home win against Liverpool, aged 40 years and four days.

On May 6, 2012, Friedel also became the oldest player to appear in a competitive match for Tottenham when he played in the club&#x27;s Premier League fixture at Aston Villa, beating Jimmy Cantrell&#x27;s near-80-year-old record. He ended his Premier League career after a total of 450 appearances, which remains a record for any North or South American player.

==Youth and college career==
Born in Lakewood, Ohio, Friedel grew up in Bay Village, where he attended Westerly Elementary School, Bay Middle School and Bay High School. Growing up, Friedel played several sports, including soccer, basketball and tennis, and excelled at all three. He earned Bay High&#x27;s Outstanding Athlete of the Year award in 1989. As an All-State basketball player in Ohio, he was invited to try out as a walk-on for UCLA&#x27;s basketball team in 1990. He began as a forward on his youth soccer team before moving into goalkeeping. Friedel graduated from Bay High in 1989. In 2007, he was inducted into the Bay High Hall of Fame.

Friedel played college soccer at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). In 1990, he kept goal for the Bruins to the NCAA championship. He was selected as the first team All-American goalkeeper in 1991 and 1992, and won the Hermann Trophy in 1993 as the top collegiate soccer player. He played 66 games for the UCLA, all of which he started. &quot;Soccer America&quot; magazine named Friedel to its College Team of the Century.

==Professional career==
===Early career===
Friedel left UCLA early to pursue a professional career. He began by attempting to sign with Nottingham Forest under Brian Clough, but was denied a work permit, the first in several such failed attempts to move to England. Following a brief trial in Scotland with Celtic, 

Friedel was signed by manager Kevin Keegan of Newcastle United, but again was denied a work permit. While awaiting approval from the British authorities, he practiced with Newcastle as an on-loan player from the USSF.

Friedel joined Danish Superliga club Brøndby IF in the spring of 1995. He stayed with that club for several months in 1995, as back-up to Mogens Krogh. Friedel remained with Brøndby until he returned to the U.S. to rejoin the national team, then preparing for the 1995 U.S. Cup and Copa America.

After the two tournaments, Friedel attempted a third time to join an English club, this time Sunderland. While awaiting a decision regarding his latest application for a work permit, Friedel spent time training with League of Ireland side St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic, who were managed at the time by Brian Kerr, a friend of Sunderland manager Peter Reid&#x27;s. When Friedel again failed to receive a British work permit, his agent negotiated a $1.1 million transfer from the USSF to leading Turkish team Galatasaray in 1995. Galatasaray were managed by Friedel&#x27;s future Blackburn Rovers manager Graeme Souness. In July 1996, following the end of the Turkish season, Friedel moved to the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer (MLS). In February 1997, he signed a three-year contract with the Crew as he was named the team&#x27;s starter. That season, he was selected to the MLS Best XI and named the MLS Goalkeeper of the Year.

===Liverpool===
Friedel completed a transfer to Liverpool, worth £1.7 million, in 1997. On December 23, 1997, Liverpool gained a work permit for Friedel on appeal after the first request was denied. He made his debut against Aston Villa on February 28, 1998. While Friedel had some initial success with the Reds, he soon had a difficult time, managing just over 30 games in almost three years, including two appearances in the UEFA Cup, as he sat behind first David James and later Sander Westerveld.

===Blackburn Rovers===

Friedel was signed to Blackburn Rovers by Graeme Souness on a free transfer in November 2000 after a work permit was secured. Joining during Rovers&#x27; promotion-winning 2000–01 season, Friedel&#x27;s consistently-assured performances helped ensure Blackburn&#x27;s return to the Premiership and then consolidate their top division status in the following seasons.

Friedel&#x27;s memorable performances for Blackburn include playing against Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup Final in early 2002, when he was named Man of the Match as he helped Rovers lift the cup. In a 2–1 win over Arsenal at Highbury, Friedel made several immense saves and was only beaten by a deflected free kick. A stunning performance away at Southampton prompted Gordon Strachan to liken him to Superman: &quot;Friedel must have got changed in a telephone box. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if when he takes his shirt off there&#x27;s a blue jersey with an &#x27;S&#x27; on underneath it.&quot;

At the end of the 2002–03 season, Friedel&#x27;s 15 clean sheets earned him Blackburn&#x27;s Player of the Year award, as well as selection to the Premiership Starting XI. On February 21, 2004, in an away game against Charlton Athletic, Friedel scored a goal from open play in the 90th minute, from a corner kick. Friedel&#x27;s goal equalized the game at 2–2, but seconds later Charlton scored again through Claus Jensen, and went on to win the match 3–2. He became just the second goalkeeper in Premier League history (excluding own goals) to score, after Peter Schmeichel for Aston Villa in 2001.

Friedel extended his contract with Blackburn Rovers on April 14, 2006, stating his love for the club as a reason. Two years later, on February 5, 2008, he again signed an extension to his Rovers contract, stating that, &quot;I am delighted to have extended the agreement. It was not a difficult decision to make. Blackburn Rovers is home to me. This is my club and I have a special affinity with it.&quot; He would, however, leave the club at the end of that season to join Aston Villa, just two league appearances short of Terry Gennoe&#x27;s club record of 289 for a goalkeeper.

In February 2019 he was one of the first seven players to be inducted into the club&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

===Aston Villa===

Friedel had asked Blackburn for permission to let him speak with Aston Villa if an offer was accepted, with Manchester City reportedly interested in signing the American. The club accepted a transfer bid for Friedel, thought to be in the region of £2.5 million, subject to Blackburn themselves having a bid accepted for a replacement goalkeeper. Villa held talks with Friedel on July 25, and he signed a three-year contract with Villa the day after. He was unveiled at half-time during Villa&#x27;s Intertoto Cup match against Odense, and made his debut against Reading on August 2 at the Madejski Stadium; just ten minutes in, the hosts were awarded a penalty, which Friedel then saved. His competitive debut came in the UEFA Cup second qualifying round, first leg, against Hafnarfjorður away from home. Villa won the match 4–1. Friedel played his first league match for Villa on August 17, 2008, the first match for Villa in the 2008–09 season, in which Villa beat Manchester City 4–2 at home.

He broke the record for continuous games played in the Premier League on November 30, 2008, after his 167th finished in a 0–0 draw with Fulham. He was sent off against former club Liverpool at Anfield by referee Martin Atkinson. Liverpool were awarded a penalty that Steven Gerrard converted against Villa&#x27;s second-choice goalkeeper, Brad Guzan, who was interestingly another American keeper named Brad and was also signed in the same season as Friedel. Friedel&#x27;s red card, which he received on the Sunday beforehand, was overturned by the FA on March 24, meaning that he was able to continue his streak of consecutive Premiership appearances. On January 16, 2011, he reached the landmark of 250 consecutive league games. Friedel became the oldest player ever to play for Villa following their 3–1 loss to Manchester United on February 1.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Friedel&#x27;s contract with Aston Villa expired after the 2010–11 season. On June 3, 2011, Tottenham Hotspur announced that they had signed Friedel on a two-year deal. On August 22, 2011, Friedel started in goal for Tottenham at Old Trafford against Manchester United, after Tottenham&#x27;s first home fixture of the season against Everton the previous week was rescheduled due to rioting in North London. This meant that Friedel further extended his run of consecutive games in the Premier League after his transfer from Aston Villa. During the 2011–12 campaign, Friedel also became the oldest player to make an appearance in the Premier League.

The arrival of the French national team&#x27;s goalkeeper and captain, Hugo Lloris, to the end of the 2012 summer transfer window cast some doubt on Friedel&#x27;s status as Tottenham&#x27;s first-choice goalkeeper for the 2012–13 season. However, following an impressive display by Friedel against Norwich on September 1, 2012, manager André Villas-Boas said that Friedel would remain number one. Friedel&#x27;s run of 310 consecutive Premier League games was ended on October 7, 2012, when he was named on the bench behind Lloris against Aston Villa. Friedel, however, returned in goal for the next match on October 20, 2012, against Chelsea.

On December 26, 2012, it was announced that Friedel had signed a new contract with Spurs, keeping him at the club until 2014.

Following Lloris&#x27; failure to fully recover from a head injury, Friedel returned to the starting lineup in a league match on November 10, 2013, but was unable to prevent Tottenham from losing 1–0 to Newcastle United, with the winning goal being scored by Loïc Rémy.

On June 9, 2014, Friedel signed a one-year contract extension with Tottenham, which would keep him at the club until 2015. In addition, Friedel also became a club ambassador, focusing on Tottenham&#x27;s presence in the United States, a role he continues to fulfill. On May 14, 2015, Friedel announced that he would retire at the end of the 2014–15 season.

==International career==
Friedel is the fourth-most capped goalkeeper in U.S. national team history, and gained his first international cap against Canada in 1992, a game in which he managed to keep a clean sheet. He was the first-choice goalkeeper for the U.S. 1992 Olympic team; however, he was unable to beat out Tony Meola as first-choice keeper for the U.S. team at the 1994 World Cup. His chance came, and Friedel made his World Cup debut, in the 1998 World Cup, where he conceded one goal as the U.S. lost to Yugoslavia. He lived up to his growing reputation in the 2002 World Cup as the U.S. went on a surprising run to the quarter-finals, which included a 3–2 victory over Portugal in group play, and a 2–0 second-round win over arch-rival Mexico before a loss to Germany (the eventual runner-up). He also became the second keeper (after Jan Tomaszewski) to save two penalty kicks during regular play (as opposed to penalty shootouts) in a World Cup finals tournament. He was dubbed &quot;The Human Wall&quot; by fans during the spectacular 2002 World Cup run.

Friedel announced his retirement from international soccer on February 7, 2005.

==Media career==
Friedel was a studio pundit for the BBC&#x27;s 2014 World Cup coverage in Brazil on both television and BBC Radio 5 Live, later appearing on RTÉ&#x27;s coverage in Ireland after returning home. For the 2014–15 season, he appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Match of the Day&quot; and Ireland&#x27;s Setanta Sports.

==Management career==
===United States U19===
On January 5, 2016, Friedel was named the United States under 19s head coach. He won the 2017 CONCACAF U-20 Championship as assistant coach of the U.S. team with Tab Ramos and Omid Namazi.

===New England Revolution===
On November 9, 2017, Friedel was named head coach of the New England Revolution, replacing Jay Heaps who was fired by the club in September 2017.

On May 9, 2019, Friedel was fired by the Revolution after a 12-21-13 career record and a 2-8-2 record to open the 2019 season.

==Personal life==
Though raised in the midwestern state of Ohio, Friedel developed a slight English accent after having lived in the north of that country for more than a decade. &quot;The English don&#x27;t think I have an accent at all. They think I sound American. And Americans think I sound English. I think I&#x27;m caught in the middle.&quot;

Friedel is a fan of the NFL&#x27;s Cleveland Browns, which former Aston Villa Chairman Randy Lerner owned until August 2012.

Friedel also names former American international goalkeeper Tim Harris as his all-time soccer hero. Friedel credits Harris as &quot;the person who started my journey.&quot;

In 2007, Friedel launched a non-profit soccer academy in Lorain, Ohio, at a cost of approximately $10 million, providing coaching on a full-tuition scholarship basis to youths aged 12 and older. Premier Soccer Academy had difficulty retaining and obtaining corporate sponsorship after the 2008 financial crisis, however, and closed in 2011. In January of that year, Friedel filed for bankruptcy protection in the United Kingdom as a result of debts arising from the academy.

<text>Regions of the Czech Republic ( ; singular ) are higher-level territorial self-governing units of the Czech Republic.

==History==
The first regions (&quot;kraje&quot;) were created in the Kingdom of Bohemia in the 14th century. At the beginning of the 15th century, Bohemia was already divided into 12 regions, but their borders were not fixed due to the frequent changes in the borders of the estates. During the reign of George of Poděbrady (1458–1471), Bohemia was divided into 14 regions, which remained so until 1714, when their number was reduced to 12 again. From 1751 to 1850, after the four largest regions were divided, the kingdom consisted of 16 regions. Between 1850 and 1862, there were several reforms and the number of regions fluctuated between 7 and 13. Due to the parallel establishment of political districts in 1848, however, their importance declined. In 1862, the regions were abolished, although the regional authorities had some powers until 1868.

Moravia was divided into four regions in 1529. In 1569–1735, their number was five, then the number increased to six. After the introduction of the political districts in 1850, Moravia consisted of two regions. In 1855–1860, there were six regions, but in 1860 they were abolished.

Czech Silesia was not divided into regions until 1783, when it was divided into two regions. From 1850, Czech Silesia formed one region.

From the 1860s to 1948, the Czech lands were divided into counties and districts. Regions were reintroduced in 1949 in Czechoslovakia. From 1949 to 1960, the Czech part of Czechoslovakia was divided into the Capital City of Prague and 13 regions. In 1960–1999, the Czech part of Czechoslovakia was divided into the Capital City of Prague and following 7 regions:
*Central Bohemian Region () with the capital in Prague
*South Bohemian Region () with the capital in České Budějovice
*West Bohemian Region () with the capital in Plzeň
*North Bohemian Region () with the capital in Ústí nad Labem
*East Bohemian Region () with the capital in Hradec Králové
*South Moravian Region () with the capital in Brno
*North Moravian Region () with the capital in Ostrava

According to the Act no. 129/2000 Coll. (&quot;Law on Regions&quot;), which implements Chapter VII of the Czech Constitution, the Czech Republic is divided into thirteen regions and one capital city with regional status as of 1 January 2000. The capital city of Prague, which has simultaneously the status of a region and a municipality, is treated by Act no. 131/2000 Coll. (&quot;Law on Capital City of Prague&quot;).

==Competences==
Rights and obligations of the regions include:
*Establishment of secondary schools;
*Responsibility for hospitals and social facilities;
*Construction and repair of second and third class roads;
*Organization of integrated transport systems;
*Ordering of public intermunicipal transport;
*Protection of the nature;
*Cooperation in the distribution of EU funds within the NUTS-2 regions;
*Tasks within the integrated rescue system;
*Right to propose laws to the Chamber of Deputies and submit complaints to the Constitutional Court.

==Government==
Every region is governed by a regional council, headed by a governor (&quot;hejtman&quot;). Elections to regional councils take place every four years. The number of council members varies according to the population in the region and consists of 45 (population under 600,000), 55 (population 600,000–900,000) or 65 people (population over 900,000).

<text>In France, the  () is the most competitive and prestigious examination for civil service in the French public education system. Successful candidates become &quot;professeurs agrégés&quot; () and are usually appointed as teachers in secondary schools or preparatory classes, or as lecturers in universities.

== Context ==
Originating from the 18th century, the is a highly prestigious and competitive examination. The level of selectivity varies between disciplines: every year, the French Ministry of National Education determines and publishes a list of annual quotas for each discipline. There are about 300 to 400 positions open each year for mathematics, but usually fewer positions for humanities and social sciences (for example, 85 positions for philosophy were offered in 2024) and perhaps only one seat in some rarely taught foreign languages such as Japanese.

The is typically open only to holders of a five-year university diploma (master&#x27;s degree) or above. There is also an internal for &quot;professeurs certifiés&quot;.

== Selection process ==
The examination requires usually more than a year of preparation. Students of the écoles normales supérieures as well as graduate students who have just completed their master&#x27;s degree often dedicate an entire year of their curriculum to prepare this examination, enrolling into specific graduate programs. Candidates are called &quot;agrégatifs&quot;.

The competitive exam generally consists first of a written part (&quot;admissibility&quot;), then an oral part (&quot;admission&quot;).

The jury is composed of university professors.

=== Admissibility ===
The admissibility phase is composed of numerous writing tests, which consist of essays and analyses of documents. Each test takes up to 7 hours in duration, and the admissibility phase usually runs over an entire week.

Points obtained at each test are totaled, and candidates that meet the threshold set by the yearly quota are pronounced &quot;admissible&quot; by the jury. The writing part is when most candidates are eliminated.

=== Admission ===
The remaining candidates have to go through an oral part (&quot;admission&quot;), composed of different oral exams. In front of the jury, candidates must demonstrate their ability to prepare and give lectures on any topic within the scope of the discipline.

These lectures provide the opportunity to verify that the candidates possess the appropriate speaking skills and master the main exercises and components of their discipline; for example, in the Agrégation of Classics (French, Greek, Latin), candidates have to translate and comment on classical texts and texts from French literature. These lessons extend well above the secondary education level; the candidate may have to present a lesson appropriate for the second, third, or even fourth years of specialized courses at the university level. One reason is that the &quot;agrégés&quot; should be able to teach in preparatory classes, very similar in nature to grammar schools, or in universities.

Points obtained at the admissibility and admission phases are ultimately totaled and used to rank candidates in accordance with the yearly quota: for instance, for a quota of 60 positions, the first 60 candidates will pass the exam and are pronounced &quot;admis&quot; by the jury.

The is therefore used as an unofficial national ranking system for students, giving a fair comparison between candidates of different universities. That is especially true in the humanities and social sciences, for which the is highly selective and supposedly demonstrates erudition of the candidate.

== Professional outcomes ==
In France, &quot;professeurs agrégés&quot; are distinguished from &quot;professeurs certifiés&quot;, recruited through the CAPES, the other main competitive exam in the French education system. The &quot;agrégés&quot; receives a higher salary and are usually endorsed with a smaller teaching service. While &quot;agrégés&quot; are expected to teach in sixth-form colleges (&quot;lycées&quot;) and universities and the &quot;certifiés&quot; in secondary schools (&quot;collèges&quot;), there is a significant overlap.

In addition to the vast majority of &quot;agrégés&quot; teaching in sixth-form colleges and secondary schools, some &quot;agrégés&quot; teach in the preparatory classes for the &quot;grandes écoles&quot;, or at the university level, through a faculty position known as PRAG and focused on teaching, which does not require to undertake scientific research, as other university academics do. A few positions that include research activities, called &quot;agrégé préparateur&quot;, or AGPR, exist in the .

=== In higher education ===
In some disciplines of higher education such as law, legal history, political science, economics, management, there exists an for the professorship positions, called &quot;agrégation de l&#x27;enseignement supérieur&quot;. In this competitive exam, the candidate also has to give several lessons in front of a committee.
Usually there are three lessons, spread over several months, except in economics, where there are only two lessons. 
The first and the last lessons have to be prepared alone, during eight hours, in a library of basic titles selected by the committee. For the remaining lesson, when it exists, the candidate has a full 24 hours to prepare for the examination, and may use several libraries as well as a team of &quot;helpers&quot; (usually doctoral candidates or fellow candidates, but never full professors).

Some anticonformist sociologists like Pierre Bourdieu have argued that this exam measures a candidate&#x27;s social connections as much their ability to present a lesson, especially considering the composition of the examining committee.

<text>In telecommunications, 8b/10b is a line code that maps 8-bit words to 10-bit symbols to achieve DC balance and bounded disparity, and at the same time provide enough state changes to allow reasonable clock recovery. This means that the difference between the counts of ones and zeros in a string of &quot;at least&quot; 20 bits is no more than two, and that there are not more than five ones or zeros in a row. This helps to reduce the demand for the lower bandwidth limit of the channel necessary to transfer the signal.

An 8b/10b code can be implemented in various ways with focus on different performance parameters. One implementation was designed by K. Odaka for the DAT digital audio recorder. Kees Schouhamer Immink designed an 8b/10b code for the DCC audio recorder. The IBM implementation was described in 1983 by Al Widmer and Peter Franaszek.

== IBM implementation ==
As the scheme name suggests, eight bits of data are transmitted as a 10-bit entity called a &quot;symbol&quot;, or &quot;character&quot;. The low five bits of data are encoded into a 6-bit group (the 5b/6b portion) and the top three bits are encoded into a 4-bit group (the 3b/4b portion). These code groups are concatenated together to form the 10-bit symbol that is transmitted on the wire. The &quot;data symbols&quot; are often referred to as D.x.y where x ranges over 0–31 and y over 0–7. Standards using the 8b/10b encoding also define up to 12 &quot;special symbols&quot; (or &quot;control characters&quot;) that can be sent in place of a &quot;data symbol&quot;. They are often used to indicate start-of-frame, end-of-frame, link idle, skip and similar link-level conditions. At least one of them (i.e. a &quot;comma&quot; symbol) needs to be used to define the alignment of the 10-bit symbols. They are referred to as K.x.y and have different encodings from any of the D.x.y symbols.

Because 8b/10b encoding uses 10-bit symbols to encode 8-bit words, some of the possible 1024 (10 bit, 210) symbols can be excluded to grant a run-length limit of 5 consecutive equal bits and to ensure the difference between the count of zeros and ones to be no more than two. Some of the 256 possible 8-bit words can be encoded in two different ways. Using these alternative encodings, the scheme is able to achieve long-term DC-balance in the serial data stream. This permits the data stream to be transmitted through a channel with a high-pass characteristic, for example Ethernet&#x27;s transformer-coupled unshielded twisted pair or optical receivers using automatic gain control.

===Encoding tables and byte encoding===
Note that in the following tables, for each input byte (represented as ), &quot;A&quot; denotes the least significant bit (LSB), and &quot;H&quot; the most significant (MSB). The output gains two extra bits, i and j. The bits are sent from LSB to MSB: a, b, c, d, e, i,  f, g, h, and j; i.e., the 5b/6b code followed by the 3b/4b code. This ensures the uniqueness of the special bit sequence in the comma symbols.

The residual effect on the stream to the number of zero and one bits transmitted is maintained as the &quot;running disparity&quot; (&quot;RD&quot;) and the effect of slew is balanced by the choice of encoding for following symbols.

The 5b/6b code is a paired disparity code, and so is the 3b/4b code. Each 6- or 4-bit code word has either equal numbers of zeros and ones (a disparity of zero), or comes in a pair of forms, one with two more zeros than ones (four zeros and two ones, or three zeros and one one, respectively) and one with two less. When a 6- or 4-bit code is used that has a non-zero disparity (count of ones minus count of zeros; i.e., −2 or +2), the choice of positive or negative disparity encodings must be the one that toggles the running disparity. In other words, the non zero disparity codes alternate.

====Running disparity====
8b/10b coding is DC-free, meaning that the long-term ratio of ones and zeros transmitted is exactly 50%. To achieve this, the difference between the number of ones transmitted and the number of zeros transmitted is always limited to ±2, and at the end of each symbol, it is either +1 or −1. This difference is known as the &quot;running disparity&quot; (RD).

This scheme needs only two states for the running disparity of +1 and −1. It starts at −1.

For each 5b/6b and 3b/4b code with an unequal number of ones and zeros, there are two bit patterns that can be used to transmit it: one with two more &quot;1&quot; bits, and one with all bits inverted and thus two more zeros. Depending on the current running disparity of the signal, the encoding engine selects which of the two possible six- or four-bit sequences to send for the given data. Obviously, if the six-bit or four-bit code has equal numbers of ones and zeros, there is no choice to make, as the disparity would be unchanged, with the exceptions of sub-blocks D.07 (00111) and D.x.3 (011). In either case the disparity is still unchanged, but if RD is positive when D.07 is encountered 000111 is used, and if it is negative 111000 is used. Likewise, if RD is positive when D.x.3 is encountered 0011 is used, and if it is negative 1100 is used. This is accurately reflected in the charts below, but is worth making additional mention of as these are the only two sub-blocks with equal numbers of 1s and 0s that each have two possible encodings.

==== 5b/6b code (abcdei) ====
† also used for the 5b/6b code of K.x.7

‡ exclusively used for the 5b/6b code of K.28.y

==== 3b/4b code (fghj) ====
† For D.x.7, either the Primary (D.x.P7), or the Alternate (D.x.A7) encoding must be selected in order to avoid a run of five consecutive 0s or 1s when combined with the preceding 5b/6b code.&lt;br&gt;Sequences of exactly five identical bits are used in comma symbols for synchronization issues.&lt;br&gt; D.x.A7 is used only 
* when RD = −1: for &quot;x&quot; = 17, 18 and 20 and 
* when RD = +1: for &quot;x&quot; = 11, 13 and 14.
With &quot;x&quot; = 23, &quot;x&quot; = 27, &quot;x&quot; = 29, and &quot;x&quot; = 30, the 3b/4b code portion used for control symbols K.x.7 is the same as that for D.x.A7.&lt;br&gt;Any other D.x.A7 code can&#x27;t be used as it would result in chances for misaligned comma sequences.

‡ Only K.28.1, K.28.5, and K.28.7 generate comma symbols, that contain a bit sequence of five 0s or 1s.&lt;br&gt;The symbol has the format 110000 01xx or 001111 10xx.

====Control symbols====
The control symbols within 8b/10b are 10b symbols that are valid sequences of bits (no more than six 1s or 0s) but do not have a corresponding 8b data byte. They are used for low-level control functions. For instance, in Fibre Channel, K28.5 is used at the beginning of four-byte sequences (called &quot;Ordered Sets&quot;) that perform functions such as Loop Arbitration, Fill Words, Link Resets, etc.

Resulting from the 5b/6b and 3b/4b tables the following 12 control symbols are allowed to be sent:
† Within the control symbols, K.28.1, K.28.5, and K.28.7 are &quot;comma symbols&quot;. Comma symbols are used for synchronization (finding the alignment of the 8b/10b codes within a bit-stream). If K.28.7 is not used, the unique comma sequences 00111110 or 11000001 cannot inadvertently appear at any bit position within any combination of normal codes.

‡ If K.28.7 is allowed in the actual coding, a more complex definition of the synchronization pattern than suggested by † needs to be used, as a combination of K.28.7 with several other codes forms a false misaligned comma symbol overlapping the two codes. A sequence of multiple K.28.7 codes is not allowable in any case, as this would result in undetectable misaligned comma symbols.

K.28.7 is the only comma symbol that cannot be the result of a single bit error in the data stream.

====Example encoding of D31.1====

== Technologies that use 8b/10b ==
After the above-mentioned IBM patent expired, the scheme became even more popular and was chosen as a DC-free line code for several communication technologies.

Among the areas in which 8b/10b encoding finds application are the following:

* Aurora
* Camera Serial Interface
* CoaXPress
* Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI)
* DVB Asynchronous serial interface (ASI)
* DVI and HDMI Video Island (transition-minimized differential signaling)
* DisplayPort 1.x
* ESCON (Enterprise Systems Connection)
* Fibre Channel
* Gigabit Ethernet (except for the twisted pair–based 1000BASE-T)
* IEEE 1394b (FireWire and others)
* InfiniBand
* JESD204B
* OBSAI RP3 interface
* PCI Express 1.x and 2.x
* Serial RapidIO
* SD UHS-II
* Serial ATA
* SAS 1.x, 2.x and 3.x
* SSA
* ServerNet (starting with ServerNet2)
* SGMII
* UniPro M-PHY
* USB 3.0
* Thunderbolt 1.x and 2.x
* XAUI
* SLVS-EC
=== Fibre Channel (4GFC and 8GFC variants only) ===
The FC-0 standard defines what encoding scheme is to be used (8b/10b or 64b/66b) in a Fibre Channel system higher speed variants typically use 64b/66b to optimize bandwidth efficiency (since bandwidth overhead is 20% in 8b/10b versus approximately 3% (~ 2/66) in 64b/66b systems). Thus, 8b/10b encoding is used for 4GFC and 8GFC variants; for 10GFC and 16GFC variants, it is 64b/66b. The Fibre Channel &quot;FC1&quot; data link layer is then responsible for implementing the 8b/10b encoding and decoding of signals.

The Fibre Channel 8b/10b coding scheme is also used in other telecommunications systems. Data is expanded using an algorithm that creates one of two possible 10-bit output values for each input 8-bit value. Each 8-bit input value can map either to a 10-bit output value with odd disparity, or to one with even disparity. This mapping is usually done at the time when parallel input data is converted into a serial output stream for transmission over a fibre channel link. The odd/even selection is done in such a way that a long-term zero disparity between ones and zeroes is maintained. This is often called &quot;DC balancing&quot;.

The 8-bit to 10-bit conversion scheme uses only 512 of the possible 1024 output values. Of the remaining 512 unused output values, most contain either too many ones (or too many zeroes) and therefore are not allowed. This still leaves enough spare 10-bit odd+even coding pairs to allow for at least 12 special non-data characters.

The codes that represent the 256 data values are called the data (D) codes. The codes that represent the 12 special non-data characters are called the control (K) codes.

All of the codes can be described by stating 3 octal values. This is done with a naming convention of &quot;Dxx.x&quot; or &quot;Kxx.x&quot;. (Note that the tables in earlier sections are using decimal, rather than octal, values for Dxx.x or Kxx.x) 

Example:

:Input Data Bits: ABCDEFGH
:Data is split: ABC DEFGH
:Data is shuffled: DEFGH ABC

Now these bits are converted to decimal in the way they are paired.

Input data

 C3 (HEX) = 11000011
 = 110 00011
 = 00011 110
 = 3 6
E 8B/10B = D03.6

=== Digital audio ===
Encoding schemes 8b/10b have found a heavy use in digital audio storage applications, namely
* Digital Audio Tape, US Patent 4,456,905, June 1984 by K. Odaka.
* Digital Compact Cassette (DCC), US Patent 4,620,311, October 1986 by Kees Schouhamer Immink.
A differing but related scheme is used for audio CDs and CD-ROMs:
* Compact disc Eight-to-fourteen modulation

== Alternatives ==
Note that 8b/10b is the encoding scheme, not a specific code. While many applications do use the same code, there exist some incompatible implementations; for example, Transition Minimized Differential Signaling, which also expands 8 bits to 10 bits, but it uses a completely different method to do so.

64b/66b encoding, introduced for 10 Gigabit Ethernet&#x27;s 10GBASE-R Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) interfaces, is a lower-overhead alternative to 8b/10b encoding, having a two-bit overhead per 64 bits (instead of eight bits) of encoded data. This scheme is considerably different in design from 8b/10b encoding, and does not explicitly guarantee DC balance, short run length, and transition density (these features are achieved statistically via scrambling). 64b/66b encoding has been extended to the 128b/130b and 128b/132b encoding variants for PCI Express 3.0 and USB 3.1, respectively, replacing the 8b/10b encoding in earlier revisions of each standard.

<text>Veleda () was a seeress of the Bructeri, a Germanic people who achieved some prominence during the Batavian rebellion of AD 69–70, headed by the Romanized Batavian chieftain Gaius Julius Civilis, when she correctly predicted the initial successes of the rebels against Roman legions.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Veleda&quot; () is most likely a borrowing from Gaulish *&quot;ueletā&quot; (&#x27;seeress&#x27;; cf. Gaul. &quot;uelets,&quot; Old Irish &quot;filed&quot;, Middle Welsh &quot;gwelet&quot;, Middle Breton &quot;guelet&quot;), with regular Germanic sound shift &quot;-t-&quot; &gt; &quot;-d-&quot;.

==Life==
The name may be Celtic and generic title for a prophetess (from Proto-Celtic &quot;*welet-&quot; &quot;seer&quot;, a derivative of the root &quot;*wel-&quot; &quot;to see&quot;). The ancient Germanic peoples discerned a divinity of prophecy in women and regarded prophetesses as true and living goddesses. In the latter half of the 1st century AD Veleda was regarded as a deity by most of the tribes in central Germany and enjoyed wide influence. She lived in a tower near the Lippe River, a tributary of the Rhine. The inhabitants of the Roman settlement of Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium (now Cologne) accepted her arbitration in a conflict with the Tencteri, an unfederated tribe of Germany (i.e., one outside the boundary of the Roman Empire). In her role as arbitrator, the envoys were not admitted to her presence; an interpreter conveyed their messages to her and reported her pronouncements.

=== Batavian Uprising ===
The Batavian leader Civilis originally raised his force as an ally of Vespasian during the Roman power struggle in AD 69, but when he saw the weakened condition of the legions in Romanized Germany he openly revolted. It is not clear whether Veleda merely prophesied the rebellion or actively incited it; given the Germans&#x27; adoration of her as a goddess, remote in her tower, the distinction may not have been clear at the time. Early in AD 70 the revolt was joined by Julius Classicus and Julius Tutor, leaders of the Treviri who like Civilis were Roman citizens. The Roman garrison at Novaesium (now Neuss) surrendered without a fight, as did the one at Castra Vetera (near modern Xanten in Niederrhein, Germany). The commander of the Roman garrison, Munius Lupercus, was sent to Veleda, though he was killed en route, evidently in an ambush. Later, when the praetorian trireme was captured, it was rowed upriver on the Lippe as a gift to Veleda.

A strong show of force by nine Roman legions under Gaius Licinius Mucianus caused the rebellion to collapse. Civilis was cornered on his home island of Batavia on the lower Rhine by a force commanded by Quintus Petillius Cerialis; his fate is unknown, but in general Cerialis treated the rebels with surprising lenience, so as to reconcile them to Roman rule and military service. In Veleda&#x27;s case, she was left at liberty for several years.

In AD 77 the Romans either captured her, perhaps as a hostage, or offered her asylum. According to Statius, her captor was then-Governor of Germania Inferior Rutilius Gallicus. A Greek epigram has been found at Ardea, a few kilometres south of Rome, that satirizes her prophetic powers. Veleda may have acted in the interest of Rome by negotiating the acceptance of a pro-Roman king by the Bructeri in AD 83 or 84. She was evidently long since deceased by the time Tacitus wrote his &quot;Germania&quot; in AD 98.

==Legacy==

In her 1795 novel &quot;Velleda, ein Zauberroman&quot; (Velleda, a Magic Novel), Benedikte Naubert conflated the lives of two contemporaries, Boudica and Veleda, whom she romanticized as Boadicea and Velleda. In Naubert&#x27;s work, Velleda is portrayed as a sorceress who offers Boadicea&#x27;s daughters access to immortality in the magical world of Germanic goddesses, while Boadicea draws her daughters back to the real world. A large extract from Naubert&#x27;s novel appeared in Shawn C. Jarvis and Jeannine Blackwell&#x27;s &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Mirror&quot;, as did Amalie von Helwig&#x27;s 1814 story &quot;Die Symbole&quot; (The Symbols), in which she was called Welleda. The forms &quot;Velleda&quot; and &quot;Welleda&quot; appear to be attempts to render the name in modern German (much as Richard Wagner rendered Odin or Wōden as Wotan in his &quot;Ring&quot; cycle).

Other 19th-century works incorporating Veleda/Velleda/Welleda included Friedrich de la Motte-Fouqué&#x27;s 1818 novel, &quot;Welleda und Gemma&quot;; Eduard Sobolewski&#x27;s 1835 opera &quot;Velleda&quot;; E.H. Maindron&#x27;s 1843–44 marble sculpture &quot;Velleda&quot;; Franz Sigret&#x27;s drawing &quot;Veleda, Prophetess of the Bructeri&quot;, and Paul Dukas&#x27; cantata &quot;Velléda&quot;.

More recently, Veleda&#x27;s story was fictionalized by Poul Anderson in &quot;Star of the Sea&quot; (1991), and by Lindsey Davis in &quot;The Iron Hand of Mars&quot; (1992) and &quot;Saturnalia&quot; (2007). Veleda is also referenced as a prophetess turned saint/goddess in &quot;The Veil of Years&quot; (2001) by L. Warren Douglas. She is also a character in &quot;The Dragon Lord&quot; (1979), by David Drake.

On November 5, 1872, Paul Henry of Paris discovered an asteroid which was named 126 Velleda in honor of Veleda.

<text>Busaira (; also Busayra, Busairah or Buseirah) is a town in Tafilah Governorate, Jordan, located between the towns of Tafilah (Tophel) and Shoubak and closer to the latter. Bozrah ( ; also Botsra, Botzrah, Buzrak) is a biblical city identified by some researchers with an archaeological site situated in the town of Busaira.

==In biblical narrative==
===Bozrah in Edom===
Bozrah means sheepfold or enclosure in Hebrew and was a pastoral city in Edom southeast of the Dead Sea. According to the biblical narrative, it was the home city of one of Edom&#x27;s kings, Jobab son of Zerah () and the homeland of Jacob&#x27;s twin brother, Esau.

:&quot;And these were the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before the reigning of a king over the sons of Israel ... And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah, from Bozrah, reigned in his place&quot;. ()

The prophets Amos, Isaiah, and Jeremiah predicted Bozrah&#x27;s destruction:

:&quot;But I will send a fire against Teman, and it shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.&quot; ().

:&quot;The Lord has a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.&quot; ().

:&quot;&quot;I swear by myself&quot;, declares the Lord, &quot;that Bozrah will become a ruin and a curse, an object of horror and reproach; and all its towns will be in ruin forever&quot;.&quot; ().

According to Isaiah 63:1–6, the Lord will come from Edom (modern-day Jordan) and Bozrah in blood-stained clothing on &quot;the day of vengeance&quot; and &quot;the year of My redeemed&quot; (cf. : &quot;He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood&quot;).

===Christian &quot;Bozrah&quot; of the end times===
According to one Christian interpretation of , Bozrah, (or a place the Bible cryptically refers to as Bozrah), will also be the scene of a magnificent &quot;break-out&quot; of God&#x27;s covenant people. According to this interpretation, the deliverance will come at an Edomite controlled place of exile and incarceration in the end times. This epic event referred to in Micah 2:12–13 has been referred to by Dr Gavin Finley as &quot;the Bozrah deliverance&quot;. &quot;Bozrah&quot; is in Hebrew, but most translators render it as &quot;fold&quot;—sheep in the &quot;fold&quot;. This &quot;break-out&quot; could be tied to , when &quot;Yahweh&quot; fights against the nations, stands on the Mount of Olives (east of Jerusalem), and splits the Mount in two as a valley, so that the remnant of Israel trapped in Jerusalem can escape those who would kill them. If so, Micah 2:12–13 would not relate to the locale of Bozrah.

The notion of a remnant in Jerusalem fleeing through a split Mount of Olives derives from the Masoretic reading of Zechariah 14:5. The Septuagint (LXX) translation states in Zechariah 14:5 that a valley will be blocked up as it was blocked up during the earthquake during King Uzziah&#x27;s reign. Jewish historian Flavius Josephus mentions in &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; that the valley in the area of the King&#x27;s Gardens was blocked up by landslide rubble during Uzziah&#x27;s earthquake. Israeli geologists Wachs and Levitte identified the remnant of a large landslide on the Mount of Olives directly adjacent to this area. Based on geographic and linguistic evidence, Charles Clermont-Ganneau, a 19th-century linguist and archaeologist in Palestine, postulated that the valley directly adjacent to this landslide is Azal, the location mentioned in Zechariah 14:5 to which the remnant in Jerusalem is to flee supposedly. This location accords with the LXX reading of Zechariah 14:5, which states that the valley will be blocked up as far as Azal. If Clermont-Ganneau is correct, the notion of people fleeing &quot;east&quot; through the Mount of Olives to Azal is impossible because the valley he identified (which is now known as Wady Yasul in Arabic, and Nahal Etzel in Hebrew) lies &quot;south&quot; of both Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives.

==Excavations==
Excavation of the site began in the 1970s, and the finds were dated first to the 8th century BCE. However, later studies indicated that the main excavated Edomite sites from the area, including Umm el-Biyara, Tawilan and Buseirah, do not pre-date the seventh century BCE (Iron II).

A round of excavations was conducted in 2009 and resulted in uncovering a church, possibly Byzantine, dwellings, and some water wells.

An old tomb is popular among tourists as it is said to belong to Al-Harith Bin Umair Al-Azadi, whose murder led to the 639 CE Battle of Mu&#x27;tah.

A number of community-led initiatives, such as the Busayra Cultural Heritage Project, have worked in recent years to develop tourism capacity at the archaeological site and raise awareness among local residents of the area&#x27;s rich ancient history. Archaeologists believe that the site suffered irreversible damage after Nebuchadnezzar II invaded it. It was later occupied by the Nabateans, who expelled the Edomites to the Levant.

<text>A data link connection identifier (DLCI) is a Frame Relay 10-bit-wide link-local virtual circuit identifier used to assign frames to a specific PVC or SVC. Frame Relay networks use DLCIs to statistically multiplex frames. DLCIs are preloaded into each switch and act as road signs to the traveling frames.

The standard allows the existence of 1024 DLCIs. DLCI 0 is reserved for the ANSI/q993a LMI standard—only numbers 16 to 976 are usable for end-user equipment. DLCI 1023 is reserved for Cisco LMI, however, numbers 16 to 1007 are usable.

In summary, if using Cisco LMI, numbers from 16 to 1007 are available for end-user equipment. The rest are reserved for various management purposes.
DLCI are Layer 2 Addresses that are locally significant. No two devices have the same DLCI mapped to its interface in one frame relay cloud.

<text>Straubing-Bogen is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the eastern part of Bavaria, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise) Cham, Regen, Deggendorf, Dingolfing-Landau, Landshut and Regensburg. The independent town of Straubing is surrounded by the district. The seat of the government of the district (Landratsamt) is located in Straubing.

The only towns within the district itself are Bogen and Geiselhöring.

==Geography==
The main river is the Danube, which crosses the district from the west to the east. There are two major geographical regions in the district. One is the Gäuboden with the Danube region and lowlands, the other are the mountains of the Bavarian Forest (&quot;Bayerische Wald&quot;).

==History==
The district was created in 1972 by merging the previous districts of Straubing and Bogen and parts of the Mallersdorf district.
==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms is based on the coat of arms of the former district Straubing. At the bottom are the white-and-blue diamonds as the symbol of Bavaria, as the Wittelsbach inherited them as their coat of arms upon the extinction of the Counts of Bogen. Above them the wavy line symbolizes the river Danube. The grain ears in the top part stand of the mostly agricultural structure of the district. The Madonna in the middle was added after the merger with the district Bogen, and stands for the St. Mary pilgrimate in Bogenberg.

<text>The Catalog of Nearby Habitable Systems (HabCat) is a catalogue of star systems which conceivably have habitable planets. The list was developed by scientists Jill Tarter and Margaret Turnbull under the auspices of Project Phoenix, a part of SETI.

The list was based upon the Hipparcos Catalogue (which has 118,218 stars) by filtering on a wide range of star system features. The current list contains 17,129 &quot;HabStars&quot;.

<doc id="566521" wikidata="Q1951675" url="?curid=566521" title="Arab European League">
<text>The Arab European League (Dutch: &quot;Arabisch-Europese Liga&quot;, AEL) is a Pan-Arabist political organisation active in Belgium and the Netherlands.

==Foundation==
AEL was founded and is led by Dyab Abou Jahjah, a Lebanese-born Shi&#x27;a Muslim living in Belgium who emigrated from Lebanon in 1991 to begin university studies in Belgium. In July 2006, Abou Jahjah returned to Lebanon allegedly to join the battle of the 2006 Lebanon War on the side of Hezbollah against Israel.

==Activities==
The AEL describes itself as Nasserite, Pan-Arabist and anti-Zionist. The group expresses support for the actions of Islamist &quot;resistance&quot; against the occupation of Iraq and approves the killings of coalition soldiers.

Salon.com reports that the group issued public approvals for the September 11, 2001 attacks and the organization&#x27;s rallies have been reported by &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; to end in chanting &quot;jihad&quot; and &quot;Osama bin Laden&quot;. However, the group&#x27;s English-language website has been critical of Al-Qaeda, referring to the September 11 attacks as &quot;horrifying&quot; and condemning al-Qaeda for alleged terrorist acts committed in Jordan.

Following the murder of a 27-year-old Belgian of North African descent by an allegedly mentally ill native Belgian man in Antwerp in 2002, which led to racially influenced riots in the city, the Arab European League began patrolling the streets of Antwerp with video cameras to monitor police activity. The AEL claimed that Belgian police were engaging in a racist &quot;manhunt&quot; of the city&#x27;s Moroccan youth and that many police officers sympathized with the political party Vlaams Blok. The AEL patrols were stopped after the Antwerp public prosecutor&#x27;s office began an investigation into whether the activities violated Belgian laws against the organization of private militias. The court however decided on 31 May 2006 that the patrols were not enough to prosecute the organization. Three leaders of the AEL however will be tried for their leading role in the unrest and riots after the 2002 murder.

The organization also responds to issues of concern to Muslims, as with its creation of a short film &quot;Al Mouftinoun&quot; in response to the film &quot;Fitna&quot;. (See International reaction to Fitna.)

==Electoral participations==
The AEL strives to develop an Arab Muslim communalist movement in Europe. The group participated in the federal elections in Belgium in 2003 under the umbrella RESIST with the PVDA (&quot;Workers Party Belgium&quot;, a Maoist political party). The party gained 0.15% in the election of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives and 0.27% in the Dutch electoral college of the Belgian Senate. These electoral results were far too low to win a seat.

They also participated in the Flemish elections in 2004 under the denomination Moslim Democratische Partij (&quot;Muslim Democratic Party&quot;), reaching their highest share of votes (0.27%) in the province of Antwerp. This electoral result was far too low to gain a seat in the Flemish Parliament.

==Controversies==
===Anti-Semitism===
Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt blamed the group for agitating racist Arabism sentiments among Arabs and inciting violence during street riots in Antwerp in 2002 and criticized it for creating patrols to shadow policemen with video cameras to monitor for alleged acts of supposed &quot;anti-Arab racism&quot;.

According to (CIDI) a think tank established by the Jewish community in the Netherlands in 1974: In April 2002 the Antwerp-based Arab European League (AEL) leader Dyab Abou Jahjah (1971) performed for the first time at a pro-Palestine demonstration in Antwerp that got completely out of hand, &quot;Where flags of Israel were set on fire and demonstrators shouted anti-Semitic chant&quot; (De Volkskrant, 11/5/02). &quot;Jews are dogs,&quot; was heard in the streets (Reformatorisch Dagblad, March 1, 2003).
In June 2002, the Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism lodged a complaint against the Arab European League for infringing the anti-racist law.

A demonstration tookplace the same month co-organized with the Flemish Green party and NGO&#x27;s such as 11.11.11 and Kif Kif, during which a puppet representing an orthodox Jew was burned publicly.

According to a 2005 US State Department report, in Europe: Anti-Semitism, particularly among Muslims, was linked in many cases to the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Most anti-Semitic incidents were not violent and included abusive language, hate mail, verbal insults at soccer matches, Internet &quot;chat room&quot; discussions, as well as persistent historical revisionism (such as Holocaust denial). However, pockets of militant young Muslims, mostly Moroccan Arabs, on a number of occasions assaulted or intimidated identifiable Jews. In addition to the anti-Semitic acts carried out by a relatively small group of Arab youths, the virulent anti-Israel sentiment among certain groups in society, such as the Arab European League (AEL) and the movement, also have contributed to an anti-Semitic atmosphere in some quarters.

In 2005, Arab European League&#x27;s president Dyab Abou Jahjah supported and rationalized Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#x27;s statements—after The Islamic Republic&#x27;s head made his controversial speeches including the infamous (widely denounced) genocidal call for Israel to be &quot;wiped off&quot;—writing: 
(…) the foundation of Mr. Ahmadinejad&#x27;s reasoning is intellectually defendable, and despite the fact that his regime is no perfect example of political morality, I argue that his position on this matter is the only possible moral one. 
And adding:

It is not the Jewish people that should be wiped out, and it is not the buildings and the houses and the schools that the settlers built, but it is the institutional frame that is represented by that Zionist entity &quot;Israel&quot; and its founding Ideology: Zionism. Wiping out Zionism from Palestine and establishing one Palestinian democratic state on all the territories of historical Palestine is the only solution that will guarantee peace for all, in equality. It is the only way to build a future together and to turn the bloody page that was opened when Zionism was introduced by western colonialism into the heart of the Arab nation. And, above all, it is the only position any democrat can have if he is to be consistent with himself. Just like abolishing the racist and segregationist South Africa was the only acceptable position. Saying that Zionism and the state built by it and with it as leitmotiv should be wiped out from the map is, regardless of the nuances, the only morally defendable position.

In February 2006, AEL posted anti-Semitic cartoons on its website. In late September 2005, the Danish newspaper &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; published several controversial Muhammad cartoons in which the Islamic prophet Muhammad was associated with terrorism. After Belgian and Dutch newspapers republished the cartoons and politicians defended the publication with the argument of free speech, both denouncing the protests of Muslims and the AEL, the AEL issued statements and posted cartoons on the subject of Holocaust denial on its web pages using the same argument of &quot;free speech&quot; and denouncing official protests against them in return. The cartoons were called antisemitic and negationist by &quot;De Standaard&quot;, a Belgian newspaper. A Dutch pro-Israel organization &quot;&quot; (CIDI) filed a formal complaint in Amsterdam against the AEL following the publication of the cartoons.

In January 2009, the AEL was reported to be the driving force behind Anti-Jewish violence during anti-Israel protests in Antwerp.

On August 19, 2010, the organisation was fined by a Dutch appeals court 2,500 euros ($3,200) for publishing a cartoon which suggested the Holocaust was made up or exaggerated by Jews.

===Homophobia===
&quot;Salon.com&quot; states that an AEL official called for the death penalty for homosexuals prior to assuming a leadership position within the group. In 2003, the political party Agalev (currently known as Groen!) attempted to place posters in Antwerp of gay and lesbian couples kissing while dressed in Islamic attire. The AEL considered it blasphemous and as an insult to Islam because according to them, the Qur&#x27;an explicitly forbids homosexuality.

<doc id="566523" wikidata="Q7927954" url="?curid=566523" title="Video modulation">
<text>Video modulation is a strategy of transmitting video signal in the field of radio modulation and television technology. This strategy enables the video signal to be transmitted more efficiently through long distances. In general, video modulation means that a higher frequency carrier wave is modified according to the original video signal. In this way, carrier wave contains the information in the video signal. Then, the carrier will &quot;carry&quot; the information in the form of radio frequency (RF) signal. When carrier reaches its destination, the video signal is extracted from the carrier by decoding. In other words, the video signal is first combined with a higher frequency carrier wave so that carrier wave contains the information in video signal. The combined signal is called radio-frequency signal. At the end of this transmitting system, the RF signals stream from a light sensor and hence, the receivers can obtain the initial data in the original video signal.

There are many application of video modulation:
* Broadcasting music and speech
* Two way radio systems (a radio that can both transmit and receive)
* Aircraft band (radio communication in civil aviation)
* Computer modems (a device that modulates Wi-Fi)
These applications all utilized the efficiency of video modulation in order to minimize costs.

== Key concepts ==
There are some important concepts needed to be understood in order to fully comprehend the video modulation.

=== Circuit ===
Video signals are usually encoded into binary digit (0, 1) or seven digit pulse-code modulation (PCM), which is a method used to digitally represent original video signal. The video signal converted to binary digit PCM at the point of origin can be then transmitted over existing telephone cable or wire directly to the destination. If the distance between origin and destination is too long, a repeater is needed to receive the signal and retransmit it at higher power so that the signal can cover longer distances. The circuit designed for the transmission should gather as many advantages as possible in order to be efficient. In other words, the circuit should be built with high quality and reliability and with minimum cost. The most common cable used to build the circuit is the 51-pair cable. This type of cable is often utilized in house phone because of the low price and good functionality. Also, signals can be transmitted efficiently since the distance between two adjacent repeaters can be 6000 feet rather than only 3000 feet compared to other cable.

=== Coding ===
Coding is the process during which the video inputs are transferred into binary digit (0, 1) because digits can be much more easily transmitted. A crystal oscillator is used in coding. It is an electronic oscillator that uses the mechanical resonance of a vibrating crystal or piezoelectric material to create an electrical signal with a very precise frequency. Inside the crystal oscillator, there is usually a crystal or elastic material whose constituent atoms, molecules, or ions are in a regular order. For example, the quartz is often used in crystal oscillators due to its elasticity. After a crystal is accurately installed, electric field can be distorted by a change in the voltage due to an electrode near or on the crystal. This characteristic is called electrostriction or inverse piezoelectricity. When the video signals are inputted into the oscillators, the crystal with electrodes attaching to it starts to vibrate as a resonator. The crystal&#x27;s piezoelectric property converts the mechanical vibrations into an oscillating voltage and then the voltage is picked up by the attached electrodes. Thus, the electric field is distorted due to the potential differences between the electrodes. Since the original video signal exists as a time-varying voltage on a wire, the distorted electric field is also time-varying. The changing electric field is converted into waveform, a signal in the shape/form of wave. Finally, the output signals are combined with a carrier wave and transferred into RF signals, then transmitted to the receiver.

=== Decoding ===
After the RF signals arrive the destination, the receiver can not obtain the data directly from the RF signals because there are coded and multiplied RF signals existing at the same time. As for the multiple RF signals problem, an electric filter is used. The frequency of each RF signal is usually different from other RF signals. An electronic filter can select only one RF signal on the basis of its carrier frequency, while rejecting all other RF signals. One example of this operation is selecting a channel on a television receiver. With only one RF signal that passes through the electric filter, only the one corresponding video signal is received, with no interference from the other RF signals.

For the coded RF signals, a light sensor is utilized. Generally, a light sensor is a device that detects changes of light in quantities and provides a corresponding output. One application of light sensors is the compensated light sensor system. This system can control the level of light at a workplace. The ratio of the light at the light sensors to the level of controlled light at the workplace is maintained substantially constant as daylight entering the room varies. In decoding process, a light sensor is used to detect the RF signal and then output the decoded signal. In general, the RF signals steamed from electric filters are first converted from binary digit to octal digit (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). The octal signals are then detected by the light sensors. The sensors respond by developing corresponding digital, electrical signals which are hence decoded to apprise the viewer of the transmitted message or are applied to external equipment such as a calculator, a computer, a hard copy machine or other devices appropriate for the particular occasion.

== Types of video modulation ==
The types of video modulation can be classified by the way that a carrier wave is combined with video signal. The video signal and carrier wave both exist in waveform and when the carrier wave &quot;carries&quot; the video signal, the shape of carrier wave is changed and the changed carrier wave is the RF signal. Hence, how the shape of carrier wave is changed is the key to classify the types of video modulation.

=== Amplitude modulation (AM) ===
Amplitude modulation works by varying the amplitude of the carrier wave according to the bent waveform of original video signal. In other words, when the carrier wave is combined with the video signal, frequency of the combined signal is the same as the frequency of the carrier wave while the amplitude is varied. The picture above can more directly explain how the shape is changed. In the combining process, if the video signal is at its peak (highest amplitude value), the amplitude of the varied carrier wave will be the highest and as for trough (lowest amplitude value), the amplitude of varied carrier wave will be the lowest. In other words, at the point in carrier wave that corresponds to the peak of video signal, the shape of wave will be most bulged and at the point corresponding to the trough, the shape will be most sunk. In fact, the change in amplitude of carrier wave is proportional to the amplitude of the video signal.

=== Frequency modulation (FM) ===
In frequency modulation, the carrier wave is combined with video signal by varying the instantaneous frequency of the wave (the frequency of wave at a particular point). (Compare with amplitude modulation, in which the amplitude of the carrier wave varies, while the frequency remains constant.) From the picture above, if the video signal is at its peak, the instantaneous frequency of carrier wave will increase and as for the trough, the instantaneous frequency will decrease. More visually, the carrier wave becomes densest at the point corresponding to the peak in video signal and thinnest at the point corresponding to the trough.

== Applications ==
Various types of video modulation can be applied in various areas due to their unique advantages and disadvantages.

=== Application of AM ===
* Radio or television (broadcasting)
* Aircraft band
AM is applied in these areas because video amplitude modulated signal can be easily coded and decoded since the change in amplitude of the carrier wave and the amplitude of original video signal is proportional. However, amplitude modulation is sensitive to noise and electromagnetic interference. Hence, the AM techniques are mainly utilized in less technical fields that tolerate noise and electromagnetic interference, such as broadcasting.

=== Application of FM ===
* Magnetic tape data storage
* VCR systems
FM is applied in these fields because it is less sensitive to the noise and electromagnetic interference and when the data is collected or the signal is recorded, it is really important to minimize the effects of outside interference, such as noise and electromagnetic interference.

<doc id="566524" wikidata="Q427614" url="?curid=566524" title="Limousin dialect">
<text>Limousin (French name, ; , ) is a dialect of the Occitan language, spoken in the three departments of Limousin, parts of Charente and the Dordogne in the southwest of France.

The first Occitan documents are in an early form of this dialect, particularly the &quot;Boecis&quot;, written around the year 1000.

Limousin is used primarily by people over age 50 in rural communities. All speakers speak French as a first or second language. Due to the French single language policy, it is not recognised by the government and therefore considered endangered by the linguistic community. A revivalist movement around the Félibrige and the Institut d&#x27;Estudis Occitans is active in Limousin (as well as in other parts of Occitania).

==Differences from Languedocien==
Most speakers and linguists consider Limousin to be a variety of Occitan. For more detailed information on this question, see the section on Occitan dialects and codification.

As a comparison of Limousin and Languedocien in written form, the following reproduces the first article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: &quot;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&quot;

* Nineteen-year-old Rex Finney of Los Angeles, California, uses the first successful wingsuit, employing it to increase horizontal movement and maneuverability during a parachute jump.
* During the year, the percentage of United States Navy enlisted personnel with an aviation-related rating rises to 9 percent.
* Autumn 1930 – The Royal Air Force rededicates No. 443 Flight of the Fleet Air Arm as the first British catapult flight of aircraft assigned to operate from battleship and cruiser catapults.

===January===
* January 2 – Leroy Grumman, Leon Swirbul, and William Schwender found the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation at Baldwin on Long Island, New York.
* January 16 – On speed trials, the British airship &quot;R100&quot; reaches , making her the fastest airship in the world.
* January 17 – Record-setting aviator Frank Hawks attempts to take off in the Lockheed Air Express &quot;Texaco Five&quot; (registration NR7955) from a soggy field in West Palm Beach, Florida, but the plane is destroyed in a spectacular crash into a row of three parked aircraft. Hawks is unharmed.
* January 19 – Trying to return to Tijuana, Mexico, after taking off in poor weather for a scheduled passenger flight to Los Angeles, California, Maddux Airlines Flight 7 – the Ford 5-AT-C Tri-Motor &quot;NC9689&quot; – crashes in Oceanside, California, and catches fire, killing all 16 people on board. It is the deadliest aviation accident in American history at the time.
* January 25 – American Airways is formed.

===February===
* At the Philadelphia Navy Yard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the United States Navy tests a Ford 5-AT-74 Trimotor equipped with 30-foot (9.1-meter) floats during the month for use as a torpedo bomber, but does not pursue the concept further. 
* February 10 – The Air Union Farman F.63&quot;bis&quot; Goliath &quot;F-FHMY&quot; suffers a tailplane structural failure during a flight from Paris-Le Bourget Airport outside Paris to Croydon Airport in London with six people on board. The pilot tries to land at the Pagehurst Emergency Landing Ground in Marden, Kent, England, but the plane stalls and crashes at Marden. Two passengers die, and the other two passengers and both crew members suffer injuries.
* February 15 – The Italian air power theorist Giulio Douhet dies at the age of 60.
* February 17 – A fire destroys the workshops of the &quot;Société d&#x27;Aviation Letord&quot; at Meudon, France, as well as aircraft, including the first Couzinet 20 and the Couzinet 27 &quot;Arc-en-ciel II&quot;.

Fordney set a new official world altitude record for human flight in the balloon &quot;&#x27;A Century of Progress&quot;, reaching before landing near Bridgeton, New Jersey. The altitude is lower than that reached by the Soviet balloon &quot;USSR-1&quot; in September, but the &quot;Fédération Aéronautique Internationale&quot; (FAI) had not recognized the Soviet record because the Soviet Union is not an FAI member country.
