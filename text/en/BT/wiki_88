<text>Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach () was a German state, created as a duchy in 1809 by the merger of the Ernestine duchies of Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Eisenach, which had been in personal union since 1741. It was raised to a grand duchy in 1815 by resolution of the Congress of Vienna. In 1903, it officially changed its name to the Grand Duchy of Saxony (), but this name was rarely used. The grand duchy came to an end in the German Revolution of 1918–19 with the other monarchies of the German Empire. It was succeeded by the Free State of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, which was merged into the new Free State of Thuringia two years later.

The full grand ducal style was Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Landgrave in Thuringia, Margrave of Meissen, Princely Count of Henneberg, Lord of Blankenhayn, Neustadt and Tautenburg.

The Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach branch has been the most genealogically senior extant branch of the House of Wettin since 1672.

== Geography ==
The Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach consisted of three greater areas, each of which formed a administratively, plus several exclaves. Neighboring countries were Prussia, Saxony, Bavaria, Hesse-Kassel (until 1866, when it was incorporated in the Prussian Province of Hesse-Nassau), and all the other Thuringian states (Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Saxe-Meiningen, Reuss Elder Line, Reuss Junior Line, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and Schwarzburg-Sondershausen).

The northern part of the Weimar district was flat and part of the Thuringian Basin; the southern and eastern parts were situated on the Ilm-Saale Plateau and in the Saale valley. The northern part of Eisenach district was hilly (Hörselberge and Hainich hills); the central part with the town of Eisenach was in the Hörsel valley; further south were the mountains of the Thuringian Forest, followed by the Werra valley, the Kupenrhön mountains and finally, in the far south, the main chain of the Rhön mountains. The district Neustadt was located in hills with altitudes between 200 and 400 meters.

The main rivers in the country were: 
* the Saale flowing through Jena in the east
* the Werra in Vacha and Eisenach, and its tributaries the Felda and Ulster in the west
* the Unstrut in the exclaves Allstedt and Oldisleben in the north
* the White Elster in Berga in the far east
* the Ilm, flowing through Ilmenau, Apolda and the capital Weimar in the centre. Acting Prime Minister Goethe once described Weimar as &quot;Athens on the Ilm&quot;.

The highest elevation in the grand duchy were the Kickelhahn () near Ilmenau, the Ellenbogen () in the Rhön and the Ettersberg () near Weimar.

In 1895, the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach was administratively divided into three districts ():

Furthermore, the districts of Weimar and Eisenach were each subdivided into two . In the case of Weimar, these were: Weimar and Apolda, in the case of Eisenach they were the Eisenach and Dermbach. In all, there were 31 cities and 594 municipalities in the Grand Duchy. The Grand Dukes of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach granted &quot;city&quot; status to three localities in the state, namely Berka/Werra (Eisenach district, 1847), Ruhla (Eisenach district, 1886, administered jointly with the Duke of Saxe-Gotha) and Münchenbernsdorf (Neustadt district, 1904).

In 1840, there were 13 cities with over 2,000 inhabitants. In the 70 years to 1910, the Grand Duchy industrialized heavily and the population of the largest cities grew, while the medium-sized cities remained constant or even lost population. The population of Stadtlengsfeld shrank dramatically after the Jewish emancipation, when most of the city&#x27;s Jewish citizens migrated to larger cities.

In 1910, several other towns had grown past the 2,000 inhabitants mark: Ruhla (Weimar part: 3917 v. 1533: +156%), Blankenhain (3405 v. 1689: +102%), Bad Sulza, (3052 v. 1422: +115%), Auma (2978 v. 1701, +75%), Triptis (2948 v. 1480: +99%), Tiefenort (2539 v. 1237: +105%), Bad Berka (2379 v. 1228: +94%), Oberweimar (2095 v. 621: +237%), Oldisleben (2064 v. 1332: +55) and Mihla (2008 v. 1294: +55%).

== History ==
The duchies of Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Eisenach had been ruled in personal union by the same branch of the House of Wettin since 1741, after the Eisenach line had died out upon the death of Duke Wilhelm Heinrich. The first Duke of the personal union was Ernest Augustus I, who built the Belvedere Palace in Weimar. His son Ernest Augustus II reigned for only three years, and died at the age of 20. At the age of 18, he married the Brunswick Princess Anna Amalia, one year his junior and a niece of King Frederick the Great of Prussia. A year later she gave birth to her son, Charles Augustus and after another year, when she was already a widow, to her son Constantine.

As Dowager Duchess Anna Amalia actively took up the regency, with the approval of the Empress Maria Theresa and the support of her ethical Minister Baron von Fritsch. As educator for her sons, she employed the poet Christoph Martin Wieland, who was a professor at the University of Erfurt.

At 18 years of age, Charles Augustus married Princess Louise of Hesse-Darmstadt. He employed the poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, with whom he soon became friends. Goethe, in turn, invited the authors Johann Gottfried Herder and Friedrich Schiller to Weimar, thus laying the foundation for the Weimar Classicism circle, which was supported in the background by Anna Amalia. Later regents would see it as main task to guard this heritage.

In 1804 Duke Charles Augustus&#x27; eldest son and heir Charles Frederick married Maria Pavlovna Romanova, sister of Emperor Alexander I of Russia, a conjugal union which decisively promoted the rise of the Ernestine Saxe-Weimar dynasty. It also gave the duchy some protection during the turmoil of the Napoleonic Wars. Though at first an ally of Prussia in the Napoleonic War of the Fourth Coalition, Duke Charles Augustus escaped his deposition by joining the Confederation of the Rhine on 15 December 1806.

After the official merger in 1809, the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach consisted of the separate districts around the capital Weimar in the north and Eisenach in the west. Thanks to their Russian connection, the duchy gained substantially from the Congress of Vienna in 1815. In the east, it gained most of the (Neustadt district; ) from the Kingdom of Saxony. It also received most of the Principality of Erfurt, which had been an exclave of Mainz before the war and a directly administered French fief under occupation. It further gained smaller possessions, such as Blankenhain and Kranichfeld. In the Rhön area, the was created from adjacent former parts of Hesse-Kassel and territories held by the secularized Princely Abbey of Fulda. Finally, the country was raised to a grand duchy.

The cosmopolitan Grand Duke Charles Augustus gave his grand duchy the first liberal constitution in Germany, on 5 May 1816. Students of the University of Jena organized themselves as Germany&#x27;s first fraternity, the and celebrated Wartburg Festival at the Wartburg in October 1817. Many liberal-minded people participated and the speakers, most of them students, must be regarded as having been among the earliest democrats in Germany.

Maria Pavlovna, who was grand duchess from 1828, featuring composers like Franz Liszt and Peter Cornelius. Her art-loving son Charles Alexander (1818–1901), who was grand duke from 1853, also supported the arts, and music in particular. He was married to Sophie, who supported his plans, and he rebuilt the decaying Wartburg the romantic historicism style of the day and had it painted by Moritz von Schwind. He also supported, albeit half-heartedly, the founding of the School of Applied Arts in Weimar, which merged to form the Bauhaus in 1919.

A member of the German Confederation from 1815, the grand duchy was not seriously affected by the German revolutions of 1848 and remained neutral during the growing friction between Austria and Prussia over the following two decades. After the Austro-Prussian War the grand duchy became a member of the North German Confederation and in 1871 joined the new German Empire as a constituent state.

In 1901 Charles Alexander was succeeded by his grandson William Ernest, who was married to Caroline Reuss of Greiz and later to Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen. In 1903, the grand duchy officially changed its name to Grand Duchy of Saxony. However, many people continued to call it Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, to avoid confusion with the neighbouring Kingdom of Saxony.

William Ernest abdicated the throne on 9 November 1918, thereby ending the monarchy in the state. It continued as the Free State of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, until 1920, when it merged with most of its neighbours to form Thuringia, with Weimar as the state capital.

=== Religion ===
In the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, as in all the Thuringian states, the Lutheran faith was the most prevalent. Specifically, in 1895, the reported religious affiliations of the 339,217 were: 
* Evangelical: 325,315 (95.9%)
* Catholic: 12,112 (3.6%)
* Jewish: 1,290 (0.4%)
* Other / Non-denominational: 500 (0.1%)

In the district of Eisenach, the distribution was slightly different. Of the 95,226 inhabitants were: 
* Evangelical: 85,319 (89.6%)
* Catholic: 8,809 (9.3%)
* Jewish: 979 (1.0%)
* Other / Non-denominational: 119 (0.1%)

The Catholic and Jewish minorities in the district Eisenach lived mainly in the Rhön. The area around the town of Geisa was predominantly Catholic and belonged to the Diocese of Fulda.

== Constitution and administration ==
Under the Constitution of 5 May 1816 (revised 15 October 1850), Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach was a constitutional monarchy, hereditary in the male line. Under the Electoral Act of 1852, the Landtag had 31 members, of whom 21 were elected in general elections. One member was elected by the landed former Imperial Knights, four were elected by other wealthy landowners, and five by voters who had an annual income exceeding 1000 Thaler from other sources. The latter group of voters were popularly called &quot;thousand thaler men&quot;. The Electoral Act of 17 April 1896 enlarged the parliament to 33 members. The grand duchy had one vote in the Imperial Bundesrat and three members in the Reichstag.

In 1909, general suffrage was introduced, under the auspices of Alfred Appelius, the later Speaker of the Landtag. The large landowners and the &quot;thousand thaler men&quot; retained their extra votes, and five new special members were added to the parliament, representing the University of Jena, the Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Trade, the Chamber of Agriculture and the Chamber of Labour.

The highest court in the land was the Court of Appeals in Jena, which dealt with appeals from all Thuringian states. There were Regional Courts in Weimar and Eisenach.

The grand duchy had one infantry regiment, which after 1871 was part of the Imperial German Army&#x27;s 11th Army Corps.

== Economy ==

=== Agriculture ===
In 1895, 37.9% of the workforce were employed in the agriculture and forestry industries, 38.9% worked in the manufacturing sector, and 16.4% were employed in the service sector.

Until 1900, agriculture was the most important branch in the economy of the grand duchy. A total of 56% of the duchy&#x27;s territory was used for agriculture, mainly in the districts Weimar and Neustadt and the exclaves Allstedt and Oldisleben in the Goldene Aue area.

The harvest of 1895 consisted of: 
Fruit was mainly grown in the Saale valley, around Jena and Bürgel. There was some viticulture north of Jena, between Dornburg and Camburg.

Stock breeding was also widespread. In 1892, there were 19,121 horses in the grand duchy, 119,720 cattle, 113,208 sheep, 122,974 pigs, 46,405 goats and 16,999 beehives.

Game was only found near Eisenach, in Eichenzell and in the Ilmenau exclave, where the grand duke&#x27;s largest hunting ground was located on the banks of the Gabelbach. About 50% of the forests were state-owned (). The dominant tree species were beech (in the Weimar district), pine (especially in the Neustadt district) and spruce (in the Eisenach district and around Ilmenau). The grand duchy&#x27;s State Forestry Office was based in Eisenach.

=== Manufacturing Industries ===
A versatile array of manufacturing industries developed in the grand duchy. For example, in Bürgel and Ilmenau, there were porcelain factories (in all, there were 39 such factories in the country).

In Ilmenau and Jena, glass was made (in particular, in the Schott factories). The glass industry was specialized in industrial glass (for example measuring devices such as thermometers in the area around Ilmenau) and optical products, around Jena. In 1846, Carl Zeiss found a precision engineering and optical company that quickly developed into a world leader. In 1917, the company had employees. In 1889, Ernst Abbe founded the Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung, which became the sole share holder of the companies Carl Zeiss AG and Schott AG.

The textile industry was also important. It was concentrated in Apolda (mostly hosiery knitting mills) and Neustadt an der Orla. Other major textile plants could be found in Wenigenjena, Eisenach, Weida, Remda and Blankenhain. In 1895, the textile industry employed approximately people.

Ruhla was a center of the metalworking industry. The country&#x27;s first car plant was built in 1895 in Eisenach. Chemical industries, such as a paint factory, could also be found in Eisenach. Furthermore, there were a paper mill in Oberweimar and a toy factory in Ilmenau. Wicker-work was manufactured in the Kuppenrhön area and pipes were made in Geisa. In 1895, there were 257 breweries in the grand duchy; the largest of these were in Apolda and Ilmenau.

=== Mining industry ===
Ilmenau and Ruhla were important mining centers in the Thuringian Forest. Around 1900, potash industry began to develop in the Werra valley, around Vacha and Berka/Werra. There were salt works in Creuzburg and Bad Sulza.

=== Trade ===
The major transport centers were Weimar and Eisenach. Many banks opened branch offices here. In 1895, there were 23 branch offices of savings banks in the grand duchy, and they were managing deposits totalling approximately 40 million Reichsmark.

The grand duchy was part of the Thuringian Toll Union, except for the exclaves Ostheim, Oldisleben, and Allstedt.

== Education ==
There was one state university in the grand duchy, the University of Jena, which was funded by Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach together with the other Thuringian states. There were several art and music schools in Weimar, and in Ilmenau, there was the Technische Universität Ilmenau, a privately owned university providing technical and scientific education. Gymnasiums existed in Weimar, Eisenach and Jena; Realschules were found in Weimar, Apolda, Jena, Eisenach, Neustadt and Ilmenau. In 1895, there were 462 primary schools, and any child would receive at least four years of primary education. Large libraries of volumes each were maintained in Weimar and Jena. In 1869, a State Museum was founded in Weimar.

<text>Waiheke Island (; Māori: ) is the second-largest island (after Great Barrier Island) in the Hauraki Gulf of New Zealand. Its ferry terminal in Matiatia Bay at the western end is from the central-city terminal in Auckland.

It is the most populated island in the gulf, with permanent residents, and the third most populous island in New Zealand (behind the two main islands). An additional estimated 3,400 people have second homes or holiday homes on the island. It is more densely populated than the North and South Islands. It is the most accessible island in the gulf, with regular passenger and car-ferry services, a helicopter operator based on the island, and other air links.

In November 2015, Lonely Planet rated Waiheke Island the fifth-best region in the world to visit in 2016.

==Geography==
===Overview===

The island is off the coast of the North Island. It is in length from west to east, varies in width from , and has a surface area of . The coastline is , including of beaches. The port of Matiatia at the western end is from Auckland and the eastern end is from Coromandel. The much smaller Tarahiki Island lies to the east.

The island is very hilly with few flat areas, the highest point being Maunganui at .

Approximately 17,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum when sea levels were over 100 metres lower than present day levels, Waiheke Island was landlocked to the North Island, surrounded by a vast coastal plain where the Hauraki Gulf / Tīkapa Moana exists today. Sea levels began to rise 7,000 years ago, after which Waiheke became an island separated from the rest of New Zealand.

===Geology===

Much of eastern Waiheke island is the remains of a Miocene volcano of the Kiwitahi Group, which erupted approximately 15 million years ago. There are locations of interest to geologists: an argillite outcrop in Ōmiha, and a chert stack at the end of Pohutukawa Point, considered &quot;one of the best exposures of folded chert in Auckland City&quot;.

===Beaches===
There are many scenic beaches, including:
*Oneroa Beach – The main beach, on the northern side of the town of Oneroa. It has free BBQ facilities, public toilets and a swing for children. 
*Little Oneroa Beach – A small secluded beach at the east end of Oneroa Beach, separated by a protruding cliff wall. It has free BBQ facilities, public toilets and a children&#x27;s playground.
*Palm Beach – Similar in shape to Oneroa Beach (complete with protruding cliff wall at the east end that separates a small private beach in Boatshed Bay), it gets its name from the mature phoenix palms at the east end, where a public toilet and free BBQ facilities are also located. There is a children&#x27;s playground in the middle section of the beach which also has a free BBQ area, public toilets and an outdoor public shower.
*Little Palm Beach – A small clothes-optional beach (by custom) at the west end of Palm Beach. New Zealand has no official nude beaches, as public nudity is legal on any beach where it is &quot;known to occur&quot;.
*Blackpool Beach – The south-facing counterpart of Oneroa Beach, lining Blackpool and popular for kayaking and windsurfing.
*Surfdale Beach – A zoned-in beach on the southern side of Surfdale, separated from Blackpool Beach by a small protruding peninsula, which has a scenic unsealed route called The Esplanade linking the beaches. Popular for kitesurfing. Also has a free BBQ area and children&#x27;s playground.
*Onetangi Beach – A long, north-facing beach lining Onetangi, a Māori name meaning &quot;weeping sands&quot;. For many years it has been the site of the Onetangi Beach Horse Races. Its western end, often inaccessible at high tide, is clothes-optional. It has sandcastle-building contests annually; participants have a few hours to build their creations in soft sand that is free of shells and suitable for digging. Free BBQ and public facilities.
*Cactus Bay – Considered by many Waihekeans as the most perfect beach and, with nearby Garden Cove, a romantic place for picnicking. The beach is accessible only by boat or kayak, as its land access was blocked off by a private landowner.
*Shelly Beach – A small and well sheltered shell and stone beach located between Oneroa and Ostend. It has free BBQ facilities, a public toilet and a diving platform located just off shore. It is a popular choice with families as at high tide, it is often calm and flat – ideal for children (but not sandy).

==Climate==

Waiheke, like Auckland, experiences a subtropical climate according to the Trewartha climate classification, and an oceanic climate according to the Köppen climate classification. The region lies 13° of latitude south of the Tropic of Capricorn, so tropical plants which are protected for the winter months will flower and fruit in the summer, and cold climate vegetables planted in autumn will mature in early spring. Summers tend to be warm and humid, while winters are relatively mild with frost being a rare event on Waiheke.

Rainfall is typically plentiful, though dry spells may occur during the summer months which can be problematic for many of the island residents, the vast majority of whom rely on rainwater harvesting from residential roofs for drinking and household use. During such dry periods (typically 3–4 months between December and March), the island&#x27;s water-delivery trucks can be seen replenishing residential water tanks that have run dry.

It is often anecdotally said by locals that Waiheke has a different micro-climate from the Auckland isthmus. Though little data supports this, the following data from a NIWA report suggests Waiheke receives over 100 hours more sunshine a year than other parts of Auckland.

==History==

The islands of the Hauraki Gulf have been settled since the archaic period of Māori history, and were visited by many of the migratory canoes such as &quot;Aotea&quot;, &quot;Tākitimu&quot;, and &quot;Mātaatua&quot;. Only the largest islands such as Aotea / Great Barrier Island and Waiheke sustained permanent settlements. The forests on the western side of Waiheke Island were likely heavily damaged in the 14th century eruptions of Rangitoto Island. During 18th and early 19th centuries, the eastern side of Waiheke was forested by ancient kauri trees, while kānuka and mānuka bushes dominated the vegetation of the western side, suggesting relatively recent regeneration. The original Māori name for Waiheke was apparently , &#x27;the long sheltering island&#x27;, but at the time the first European visitors arrived it was known as , &#x27;island of trickling waters&#x27; — rendered as &quot;Motu Wy Hake&quot; by James Downie, master of the store ship HMS &quot;Coromandel&quot;, in his 1820 chart of the Tamaki Strait and the Coromandel coast.

Waiheke Island has historically been settled by various tribes, especially the Marutūāhu collective tribes of Ngāti Maru and Ngāti Pāoa. Waiheke Island was the site of many battles between Ngāti Pāoa and Ngāpuhi from the Bay of Islands, up until the late 18th century. In the 1790s, sealing and whaling ships underwent repairs primarily on Waiheke Island.

The island was briefly depopulated during the Musket Wars, when Ngāti Pāoa and other Tāmaki Māori sought refuge in areas such as the Waikato. When Ngāti Pāoa returned to Tāmaki Makaurau (Auckland), they primarily settled on Waiheke. After the wars, the Ngāti Pāoa community of Waiheke were mostly based at Pūtiki Bay.
In 1836, Thomas Maxwell established a shipyard at Man o&#x27;War Bay in eastern Waiheke, using local timber to build and repair ships. Ngāti Pāoa quickly engaged with the emerging industries, helping to supply timber and food for European ships. Ngāti Pāoa established wheat and vegetable plantations on the eastern bays of the island. The shipbuilding industry remained on the island until the 1860s, after which the eastern farming plantations quickly became disused. Ngāti Pāoa at Te Huruhi continued to supply produce to Auckland until the early 20th century. Much of the firewood and building timber supplied to the growing city of Auckland was supplied by Waiheke Island forests, while shingle and sand from Owhanake and Hooks Bay was used for concrete manufacturing, up until the 1920s. The island was also home to manganese mines between 1872 and 1900 (briefly first established in the 1840s).

Large private land purchases occurred on Waiheke between 1836 and 1840s, followed by large crown land purchases in the 1850s. By the 1850s, the only Ngāti Pāoa land that remained on the island was a 2,100 acre section at Te Huruhi (near the modern suburb of Blackpool). Through a process of individualisation of land titled, the Māori Land Court split the Te Huruhi block between 65 individuals, and by 1914 most of the block had been sold to private interests. By the end of the 19th century, the island was increasingly deforested, and land was increasingly used for cattle pastures.

In the late 1800s or early 1900s the island was owned by a man named Frank Bell, which caused the island to be previously known as Bell&#x27;s Island.

When shipping companies began offering occasional trips to the island in the 1880s, Waiheke emerged as a seaside resort. Day trips to Waiheke and Motutapu by steamers became a common recreational excursion, and boarding houses began to flourish at the south-eastern bays of the island. In 1915, Aucklanders were offered the chance to buy affordable land at Ostend, the first subdivision of Waiheke. The naming of these new subdivisions reveal the central role of beach life to the identity of the island. The winner of a competition naming the Surfdale subdivision was awarded a parcel of land near the beach. A section of land could be bought for a small deposit on top of a cost of 8 pence a day and was promoted as a sound investment, however, a level of self sufficiency was required for life on the island as electricity only arrived in 1954. These land offers were not open to Māori. Ostend and Surfdale were joined by additional subdivisions at Palm Beach, Rocky Bay and Oneroa in the 1920s.

During World War II, three gun emplacements were built at Stony Batter on the eastern edge to protect Allied shipping in Waitematā Harbour, in the fear that Japanese ships might reach New Zealand. This mirrored developments at North Head and Rangitoto Island. The guns were never . The empty emplacements can be visited seven days a week. The extensive tunnels below them have also opened as a tourist attraction.

In 1999 Waiheke&#x27;s community board voted Waiheke as a &quot;genetic engineering free zone&quot;, but this is a matter of principle rather than fact, as only national government controls exist over genetically engineered foods and grains.

==Demographics==
===Population===

Waiheke Island SA3 statistical area, which also includes the smaller islands of the Hauraki Gulf, such as Ponui Island, Pakihi Island and Rotoroa Island, none of which have a substantial population, covers . It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.

Most people live close to the western end, or near the isthmus between Huruhi Bay and Oneroa Bay, which at its narrowest is only wide. The settlements of Oneroa and Blackpool are the furthest west, followed by Palm Beach, Surfdale, and Ostend. Further east lies Onetangi, on the northern coast of the wide Onetangi Bay. To the south of this on the opposing coast is Whakanewha Regional Park, Whakanewha, and Ōmiha (also called &#x27;Rocky Bay&#x27;). Much of the eastern half of the island is privately owned farmland and vineyards, with a small settlement at Orapiu.

Waiheke is a popular holiday spot, and during the main summer season, especially around Christmas and Easter, its population increases substantially due to the number of holiday homes being rented out, corporate functions and dance parties at vineyards and restaurants, the Wine Festival and the Jazz Festival and weekend trippers from around the country and the world. The population increases significantly, almost all homes and baches are full and a festive atmosphere exists.

A downside of tourism is that short-term &quot;Airbnb&quot; type-accommodation is said to be causing a shortage of homes available for locals to rent on a long-term basis, leading to a housing crises. Some have suggested this has been caused by overseas residents returning to their homes as a result of Covid and other international pressures. The island has the fourth highest homeless population of any local board in the Auckland region, despite having one of the lowest overall populations. While the number of homeless people per capita is high, over a third of the island&#x27;s houses are said to be unoccupied, and overtourism is being blamed. This situation has led to growing calls for short-stay rental regulations to be introduced.

===Social composition===

Waiheke Island SA3 statistical area had a population of 9,093 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 60 people (0.7%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 834 people (10.1%) since the 2013 census. There were 4,473 males, 4,578 females and 42 people of other genders in 3,837 dwellings. 6.3% of people identified as LGBTIQ+. The median age was 48.9 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally). There were 1,188 people (13.1%) aged under 15 years, 1,188 (13.1%) aged 15 to 29, 4,533 (49.9%) aged 30 to 64, and 2,184 (24.0%) aged 65 or older.

People could identify as more than one ethnicity. The results were 87.9% European (Pākehā); 12.3% Māori; 3.6% Pasifika; 4.6% Asian; 5.2% Middle Eastern, Latin American and African New Zealanders (MELAA); and 2.1% other, which includes people giving their ethnicity as &quot;New Zealander&quot;. English was spoken by 97.8%, Māori language by 3.2%, Samoan by 0.4%, and other languages by 16.6%. No language could be spoken by 1.2% (e.g. too young to talk). New Zealand Sign Language was known by 0.4%. The percentage of people born overseas was 33.8, compared with 28.8% nationally.

Religious affiliations were 20.6% Christian, 0.5% Hindu, 0.1% Islam, 0.7% Māori religious beliefs, 1.1% Buddhist, 0.8% New Age, 0.3% Jewish, and 1.7% other religions. People who answered that they had no religion were 67.6%, and 6.9% of people did not answer the census question.

Of those at least 15 years old, 2,619 (33.1%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, 3,501 (44.3%) had a post-high school certificate or diploma, and 1,782 (22.5%) people exclusively held high school qualifications. The median income was $39,000, compared with $41,500 nationally. 1,206 people (15.3%) earned over $100,000 compared to 12.1% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 3,615 (45.7%) people were employed full-time, 1,425 (18.0%) were part-time, and 153 (1.9%) were unemployed.

==Governance==
Waiheke is part of the territorial authority of Auckland Council. The first local government on the island were the Ostend Road Board and Orapiu Road Board, which both formed in 1921 and were combined in 1947. In 1970, the Waiheke County Council was formed, which administered the local government on Waiheke and the surrounding Hauraki Gulf islands. Since 1989, when the county council merged with the Auckland City Council, there has been an elected community board with limited, mainly representational powers, in line with other neighbourhoods in Auckland. One member on the City Council represented all the inhabited Hauraki Gulf islands (i.e. Waiheke, Great Barrier and Rakino) plus the downtown area in the central business district.

===Amalgamation with Auckland City, later Auckland Council===
In 1989 Waiheke County Council was amalgamated with Auckland City Council as part of Local Government restructuring of that year.

In 1990 the Waiheke Community Board formally requested the right to de-amalgamate from the city. A &#x27;De-amalgamation Committee&#x27; was established by Council to facilitate the Board&#x27;s wish. However, this proved not to be to the liking of most of Auckland&#x27;s citizens. In 1991, the city responded to a campaign run by a pro-union group, the Waiheke Island Residents &amp; Ratepayers Association (Inc) by holding a democratic referendum. The de-amalgamation proposal sponsored by the Community Board was defeated.

In 2008, the Royal Commission on Auckland Governance received 3,080 submissions (from a population of 1.2 million), 737 of which were made by Waihekeans (population 8,500), almost 1/4 of all submissions. This exemplified the level of citizen involvement found on Waiheke. A public meeting of 150 residents on 29 March 2008 found a majority in favour of breaking away from Auckland City. The Royal Commission recommended that Waiheke Island retain its community board with enhanced powers. When Auckland Council was created in 2010 by amalgamating seven councils and territorial authorities and Auckland Regional Council, Waiheke was given its own local board.

The Waiheke Local Board was elected in the October 2010 Auckland local elections as part of the Auckland Council.

The 2010 local elections resulted in Waiheke resident Mike Lee becoming the Councillor for the Waitemata and Gulf ward. Denise Roche, Faye Storer, Jo Holmes, Don McKenzie and Jim Hannan were elected to the new Local Board. After Roche&#x27;s resignation after becoming a Member of Parliament for the Green Party of New Zealand in 2011, Paul Walden was elected in a by-election.

In 2013 Lee was re-elected. Paul Walden was re-elected to the Local Board, joined by Beatle Treadwell, Becs Ballard, John Meeuwsen and Shirin Brown.

In 2016, Lee was re-elected. Paul Walden, Shirin Brown and John Meeuwsen were re-elected to the Local Board. Newly elected were Cath Handley and Bob Upchurch.

In 2015–16, the subject of amalgamation remained a hot topic on the island with an application filed with the Local Government Commission from a group called Our Waiheke for a unitary authority.

==Lifestyle==
Waiheke&#x27;s lifestyle is largely influenced by the fact that it is surrounded by water – there are a number of beaches mentioned above, that are popular for a wide range of activities such as kite surfing, kayaking, stand-up-paddle boarding, boating, swimming and other typical beach pursuits.

===Arts and culture===
Waiheke has a community-run cinema, a theatre that hosts a number of regular musicians, performances and local productions, and a library that was rebuilt in 2014 at the cost of $6 million. There are a large number of art galleries run by private individuals across the island, along with a community art gallery.

Waiheke has become internationally known for the biennial exhibition Sculpture on the Gulf, an &quot;outdoor sculpture exhibition set on a spectacular coastal walkway on Waiheke Island in Auckland’s Hauraki Gulf&quot;. It takes place towards the end of January until approximately mid-March every second year. It was listed by the &quot;New York Times&quot; as number 35 in its list of 46 must-see places and events of 2013. The sculpture walk attracts thousands of visitors to Waiheke; in 2013, there were more than 30,000 attendees.

===Sports===
Waiheke has a number of sports teams and facilities on the island. Rugby union, cricket, rugby league, football and netball are widely played and followed.

There are three main sports facilities on the island: 
* Onetangi Sports Park: surrounded by the Whakanewha Regional Park several vineyards and the Waiheke golf course lies the idyllic setting for the Onetangi Sports Park. It is home to multiple sports groups such as the Waiheke Tennis club, Waiheke United AFC, Waiheke Rugby, Waiheke Cricket, Waiheke Mountain Bike Club and an 18-hole Frisbee (Disc) Golf course.
* Ostend Sports Park: located in the centre of the urban area, it is home to the Waiheke Rams rugby club and the Waiheke Dolphins netball teams.
* The Waiheke Recreation Centre: a large indoor multi-sports facility that is used by the High School during term time (days) and at nights and weekends offers a wide range of activities such as badminton, basketball, gymnastics, martial arts and other activities.

==Education==
Waiheke Island has two primary schools and one secondary school. It is the only island in New Zealand, other than the North and South Islands, with a secondary school.

In 2016, the New Zealand Government Education Minister announced a $40 million school rebuild project for Waiheke. This was made up of two project announcements: $23 million to Te Huruhi School rebuild project to provide three new blocks with 22 new teaching spaces, a new administration area and library and targeted repairs to the existing school hall; and $17m was awarded to the Waiheke High School redevelopment project to build 10 new teaching spaces and improvement to existing facilities.

Both rebuild project were started in 2019 with an expected completion date of late 2019 / early 2020.

*Te Huruhi Primary School is a state contributing primary (Year 1–6) school in Surfdale, and has students. It opened in 1986 following the split of Waiheke Area School. 
* Waiheke Primary School is a state full primary (Year 1–8) school in Ostend, and has students. It opened in 2005.
*Waiheke High School is a state Year 7–13 secondary school in Surfdale, and has students. It opened in 1986 following the split of Waiheke Area School.

==Transport==
===Ferry===

The ferry Baroona, built in Australia in 1904, was the main way to get to the island from the mainland for much of the twentieth century and was known for being a slow and noisy ferry. In 1987, the first of a fleet of new catamaran ferries began to provide more efficient access to and from the island. The 40 minute journey each way made a daily commute more viable.

Scheduled ferry services regularly sail to and from Waiheke. There are currently two non-governmental, commercially owned operators providing daily passenger only services from Downtown Auckland to Waiheke&#x27;s Matiatia wharf: the first is the long-standing Fullers, with trips taking approximately 40 minutes, or around 50 minutes when the service calls at Devonport; and the second is the relative newcomer Island Direct, who offer a slightly less frequent, smaller, family-run business alternative

Meanwhile, SeaLink - also a non-governmental, commercially owned but publicly listed company - provides passenger, car and freight services between Half Moon Bay in East Auckland and Waiheke&#x27;s Kennedy Point, with trips taking around 50 minutes to an hour. SeaLink also offer a passenger and car &quot;City Service&quot; connecting Kennedy Point with Auckland&#x27;s Wynyard Quarter.

There have been other ferry services that have tried to compete with Fullers, most recently, Explore Group provided a Matiatia to Downtown service from late 2014 until April 2016. The competition was welcomed by Waiheke residents, but ultimately proved unsustainable for the company.

In recent years, there has been significant controversy with many of Waiheke&#x27;s resident population who rely on the ferries &quot;like buses&quot; – and especially those who commute daily to work in Auckland – complaining of poor parking arrangements at Matiatia, unfair price increases and generally poor ferry services. This led to the launch of a Ferry User&#x27;s Group (or FUG) and a &quot;Fuller&#x27;s Watch&quot; group, with the objective of giving a voice to the island&#x27;s ferry passengers whilst lobbying local politicians and working with the ferry companies to improve the overall experience.

More recently, there have been moves to try to incorporate the privately owned, commercial ferry businesses into the Auckland Transport Regional Public Transport Plan (AT RPTP), most recently in 2022 when public and political pressure grew as a result of ferry price rises. The integration into the AT RPTP would afford closer regulation and fare subsidies, however Fullers Group have managed to resist any change and continues to receive an exemption from the AT RPTP. In 2023 a detailed Waka Kotahi report was published that examined the business case for the removal of the special exemption, however, while the report found there was a “strong case for changing the status” it ultimately fell short of pushing for change

===Buses===

Waiheke has a reliable and fully timetabled public bus service (pdf) which is operated by Waiheke Bus Company (owned by Fullers), and overseen by Auckland Transport.

There are five routes operating in a new network from October 2019. Most routes operate to and from the ferry terminal at Matiatia and span outwards across the island towards Palm Beach, Ostend, Rocky Bay and out to Onetangi Beach. There are no public bus routes towards the Eastern end of the island.

* 50A – Onetangi Beach West, Ostend, Surfdale, Oneroa, Matiatia Ferry Terminal
* 50B – Onetangi Beach East, Ostend, Surfdale (Jellicoe Parade, Wellington Road), Oneroa, Matiatia Ferry Terminal
* 501 – Kennedy Point Wharf to Matiatia Ferry Terminal
* 502 – Ōmiha (Rocky Bay), Ostend, Palm Beach, Blackpool, Oneroa, Matiatia Ferry Terminal
* 503 – Matiatia Ferry Terminal to Oneroa (one-way summer service)

As the island is within one fare zone, fares are flat, regardless of journey length.

In July 2019, it was announced that Waiheke will get a fleet of electric buses on the island. This will start with six new electric buses in mid-2020, with an additional five to arrive later.

===Air service===
There is one airport on the island, Waiheke Island Aerodrome. Waiheke is also accessible via a regular seaplane service.

==Infrastructure==
The island has less infrastructure than mainland Auckland.

Roads: The roads are mainly narrow and in many places unsealed and unlit, especially on the eastern half of the island. Except for the Onetangi Straight (60 km/h) and the rural eastern end, the island speed limit is 50 km/h, and many of the roads see traffic travelling at well under the limit due to their size. At the car ferry terminal at Kennedy Point, the highway department has posted a sign saying &quot;Slow Down, You&#x27;re here&quot;, which delivers the message to visitors about island life.

Transport: Primary transportation on the island is by privately owned used car, motorbike or car-rental for visitors. The Waiheke Bus Company (owned by Fullers) services most inhabited parts of the island, linking to the ferry sailings from Matiatia and Kennedy Point. Numerous other taxi, shuttle, bus and boutique tour services cater to visitors. Due to the hills, bicycling on the island tends to be more limited, but there is also an active mountain bike group (WMBC). ebikes continue to rise in popularity, with at least two ebike rental companies operating on the island - one located at Matiatia wharf. ebikes are increasingly popular with day-trippers and holiday makers who wish to bike around the various sightseeing locations, vineyards and beaches. ebikes are also now a common sight on the ferries to the mainland as more commuters opt for ebike transport to their city working location. Being an island, many people also own small boats and these are visible in multiple harbours, and anchorages around the built up areas. Walking continues to be a popular means of island transport, both for access and recreation with many walking trails that are not along roads. Horse is popular for recreation rather than transport, but the island does support both a pony club and an adult riding club.

Power: Waiheke is connected to the North Island&#x27;s electricity network via twin 33 kV undersea cables from Maraetai on the mainland, terminating on the island at a 33/11 kV substation in Ostend. The island&#x27;s electricity network is operated by Auckland-based lines company Vector.

Water and waste water: Each house must maintain its own water supply, most collecting rainwater in cisterns. Water delivery is available and tends to be very active during dry summers. Except for the Oneroa sewage district which discharges into the Owhanake Treatment plant, each residence and relevant commercial establishments must install a septic tank and septic field to handle sewage. This is a requirement in every building consent.

Internet: The fibre optic cable that runs from a bay on the southern side of the island connects it to the internet. Internet services were provided using VDSL and ADSL until central government introduced a national fibre optic rollout that included urban parts of Waiheke. Central government also forced the separation of the cable infrastructure from the ISPs, with the fibre backbone being maintained by Chorus which has contracts with numerous ISPs. The locally owned WISP continues to provided wireless internet and some islanders use both services to ensure system redundancy.

Solid Waste: The community established a charitable trust which successfully tendered for Auckland City&#x27;s contract for solid waste disposal. The recycling centre was implemented with such success that it soon had to be expanded to handle the volume. However, when the contract term expired in 2009, the Council voted to disqualify incumbent tenderer Clean Stream Waiheke Ltd and granted Transpacific Industries Group Ltd a $22 million contract. The decision was political.

Emergency Services: The Waiheke Volunteer Fire Brigade, part of the New Zealand Fire Service, serves the island. The brigade has two stations, at Oneroa and at Onetangi.

Media: The island has a lively press, with the long-established, independently owned weekly &quot;Waiheke Gulf News&quot; and until recently the Fairfax Media owned &quot;Waiheke Marketplace&quot; which closed down in 2018. A community radio station, Waiheke Radio, is broadcasting on 88.3 FM and 107.4 FM after Beach FM lost its licence in a commercial bid in 2008.

===Matiatia redevelopment===

The gateway to Waiheke, where the main pedestrian ferry lands over one million passengers per year, is a valley and harbour called Matiatia. In 2000 it was purchased by three investors in Waitemata Infrastructure Ltd (WIL). In 2002 WIL proposed to change the Operative District Plan rules for their land to build a major shopping and hotel complex with of gross floor area on buildable land of approximately 3 hectares. This united the residents of the island in opposition. Over 1,500 adult residents of the island (out of perhaps 3,000) joined in an incorporated society, the Community and People of Waiheke Island (CAPOW), to oppose the private plan change in court. Church Bay resident and former newsreader John Hawkesby became &quot;the voice of the campaign&quot; that included a showdown with then mayor, John Banks, when Hawkesby made a deputation to the city council hours after the press revealed that Banks was in business with two (of three) directors of WIL.

In 2004, they won an interlocutory judgement in which the environment court ruled that Auckland City Council had erred in the rules, and the current rules limited controlled development to in what was called the Visitor Facility Precinct. In 2005, CAPOW won an interim judgement by the court which reduced the proposed redevelopment to about a third of what the investors had originally sought.

This set the stage for confidential negotiations between Auckland&#x27;s mayor Dick Hubbard and the investors, who on 31 August 2005 (now known as &#x27;Matiatia Day&#x27; on the island) sold the stock in WIL to the city for $12.5 million. The unanimous vote on 30 June 2005 of the City Council to approve the purchase was said to have come about because of the unity of the people of Waiheke Island. The court case finally was concluded with permitted development set at 10,000 m2 of mixed use gross floor development. The Court also found Auckland City Council and WIL liable for costs in relationship to the interlocutory judgement. Since WIL was now owned by Council, it had to write a cheque to CAPOW for $18,000, representing 75% of CAPOW&#x27;s costs on that matter. This final cheque allowed CAPOW to pay all its debts and balance its books.

The Council organised a design competition in 2006 to find a suitable development plan and project for the Matiatia gateway. The competition winner&#x27;s design (scheme 201) was available for comment on the Council website. It attracted much criticism for the lack of car parking close to the ferry terminal, the transport hub function used by all islanders regularly and almost daily by around 850 commuters to Auckland.

In 2013, Matiatia again became a hotspot for controversy as a group of residents proposes a private marina at the terminal. Some of the veterans of the protests a decade prior (led by local resident, retired newsreader John Hawkesby), re-emerged to oppose. The Environment Court decided in favour of the residents.

In 2023 a new controversial marina opened at Kennedy Point, despite years of resource and environmental court wranglings

==Wine==

Waiheke has become known as New Zealand&#x27;s &quot;island of wine,&quot; home to a dedicated group of winegrowers who have successfully matched the maritime climate and ancient soil structures to the selection of classical grape varieties to produce red and white wines with distinctive varietal character. The climate is well-suited to growing Bordeaux-type grapes, though some Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc varieties are also considered to be good. Waiheke winegrowers regularly win awards for Syrah (Kennedy Point&#x27;s 2007 Syrah won best Syrah in the world in 2009), proving the island&#x27;s &quot;terroir&quot; suits the variety well. Wines produced on Waiheke are relatively expensive because of the limited size of many of the island&#x27;s vineyards.

Among the vineyards and wineries on Waiheke Island are:

*Awaroa Vineyard – The organic Awaroa vineyards lie on west-facing slopes among native bush in the middle of Waiheke Island. Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon are the main varieties planted.
*Batch Winery – Waiheke&#x27;s newest hi tech winery production is located at the highest vineyard with views from Coromandel to the Sky Tower. Batch wine portfolio includes Flora, Pinot Gris, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. Batch Fizz sparkling wine, made and bottled on site, range includes Fizz Rose, Fizz Chardonnay and Fizz Riesling.
*Cable Bay Vineyards – Cable Bay Vineyards makes wines from grapes grown on Waiheke Island and in Marlborough. Varieties grown include Gewürztraminer, Sauvignon blanc, Pinot noir, Chardonnay, Five Hills Merlot/Malbec/Cabernet and Rosé.
*Destiny Bay Vineyards – Destiny Bay is Waiheke Island&#x27;s only Cabernet blend specialist and first fully certified sustainable winery. The 2007 Magna Praemia is New Zealand&#x27;s highest rated wine by an international critic, and received 98/100 points by Anthony Dias Blue. Magna Praemia is New Zealand&#x27;s most expensive wine.
*Edbrooke Vineyard – Jeremy Edbrooke has over planted in Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Chardonnay and Pinot gris grapes which are supplied to Waiheke Island&#x27;s Passage Rock Wines.
*Eventide Vineyard – Eventide is a boutique vineyard producing an annual Syrah. The vineyard was planted in 2012 and sits atop one of the highest points on Waiheke. It is located next to EcoZip – a commercial flying fox. Visitors to ecozip can &quot;fly&quot; over the Eventide vines and down through 15 acres of spectacular native (Podocarp) rainforest that is jointly managed by the two enterprises
*Fenton Estate – First planted in 1989, Fenton Twin Bays Vineyard is a north-facing property that spans two small bays separated by a peninsula.
*Goldwater Estate – Begun by pioneering Waiheke winemakers Kim and Jeanette Goldwater, Goldwater Estate was among the first wine making operations on Waiheke. Its awards include being named winery of the year by Wines and Spirits Magazine in 2001.
*Jurassic Ridge – Jurassic Ridge is a small, family-owned vineyard and winery, named for the surrounding geology. It produces hand-crafted Syrah, Montepulciano, Pinot gris and Cabernet Franc. Jurassic greywacke is a major feature of the terroir.
*Kennedy Point Vineyard – Kennedy Point Vineyard is the only certified organic vineyard on Waiheke and can be found on the southwestern side and was established in 1996. It specializes in growing and producing Bordeaux and Syrah wines.
*Man O&#x27; War – Situated at Man O&#x27; War Bay, at the northern end of Waiheke Island, these vineyards are planted on numerous small sites on the Man o&#x27;War farm.
*Miro Vineyard – Miro Vineyard produces two wines, both red Bordeaux blends. The vineyard overlooks the ocean at Onetangi Beach.
*Mudbrick Vineyard – Mudbrick is one of the island&#x27;s best-known wineries, and has a Provence-style restaurant made of mudbrick. The vineyard produces Merlot, Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Syrah grapes. 
*Obsidian Vineyard – Obsidian Vineyard in Onetangi. It is a 17-hectare property established in 1993. Obsidian, its flagship wine, is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Its label is &quot;Weeping Sands&quot; (the translation of &quot;Onetangi&quot;). In 2007 Obsidian won a trophy and gold medal at the Romeo Bragato National Wine Competition for its first release of the Montepulciano variety.
*Passage Rock Wines – Passage Rock Vineyard is at the eastern end of Waiheke Island at the head of Te Matuku Bay. Its first vines were planted in 1994.
*Peacock Sky – Peacock Sky Vineyard is located in the centre of Waiheke Island with views across the Hauraki Gulf to Auckland.

<text>Ahmad Sanjar (; full name: &quot;Muizz ad-Dunya wa ad-Din Adud ad-Dawlah Abul-Harith Ahmad Sanjar ibn Malik-Shah&quot;) (6 November 1086 – 8 May 1157) was the Seljuq ruler of Khorasan from 1097 until 1118, when he became the Sultan of the Seljuq Empire, which he ruled until his death in 1157.

== Early years ==
Sanjar was born on 6 November 1086 in Sinjar, a town situated in northwestern Iraq. Although primary sources state that he was named after his birthplace (Rāvandi, p. 185; Ebn al-Jawzi, XVIII, p. 161) Bosworth notes &quot;Sanjar&quot; is a Turkic name, denoting &quot;he who pierces&quot;, &quot;he who thrusts&quot;. He was a son of Malik Shah I and participated in wars of succession against his three brothers and a nephew, namely Mahmud I, Barkiyaruq, Malik Shah II and Muhammad I. In 1096, he was given the province of Khorasan to govern under his brother Muhammad I. Over the next several years Ahmad Sanjar became the ruler of most of Iran with his capital at Nishapur.

== Governor of Khorasan ==
A number of rulers revolted against Sanjar and continued the split of the Great Seljuq Empire that had started upon dynastic wars. In 1102, he repulsed an invasion from Kashgaria, killing Jibrail Arslan Khan near Termez. In 1107, he invaded the domains of the Ghurid ruler Izz al-Din Husayn and captured him, but later released him in return for tribute.

Sanjar undertook a campaign to eliminate the Nizari Ismailis within Persia and successfully drove them from a number of their strongholds, including Quhistan and Tabas. However, an anecdote indicates that en route to their chief stronghold at Alamut, Sanjar woke up one day to find a dagger beside him, pinning a note from Hassan-i Sabbah stating that he (Hassan) would like peace. Sanjar, shocked by this event, sent envoys to Hassan and they both agreed to stay out of each other&#x27;s way.

In 1117, he marched against the Ghaznavid Sultan Arslan-Shah, defeating him at Battle of Ghazni and installing Arslan&#x27;s brother Bahram-Shah in the throne as a Seljuk vassal.

== Sultan of the Seljuk Empire ==

On February 26, 1105 Sultan Barkiyaruq died. He chose his younger son, Muizzeddin Malik-Shah, as heir to the throne. Malikshah took the name Malik-Shah II after being proclaimed the Sultan of the Seljuk Empire. However, the true power was in the hands of his uncle, Muhammad Tapar. In the same year, Muhammad Tapar dethroned his nephew and started to rule the State himself as sultan. When Muhammad died on April 4, 1118, his son Mahmud II was declared as new sultan. 
When Muhammad&#x27;s son Mahmud II ascended the throne, Emir of Yazd Garshasp II fell into disgrace; slander about him spread to the court that made him lose confidence, and made Mahmud send a military force to Yazd where Garshasp was arrested and jailed in Jibal, while Yazd was granted to the royal cupbearer. Garshasp, however, escaped and returned to Yazd, where he requested protection from Ahmad Sanjar (Garshasp&#x27;s wife was the sister of Ahmad).

Garshasp urged Ahmad to invade the domains of Mahmud in Central Iran and gave him information on how to march to Central Iran, and the ways to combat Mahmud. Ahmad accepted and advanced with an army to the west in 1119, where he together with &quot;five kings&quot; defeated Mahmud at Saveh. The kings who aided Ahmad during the battle were Garshasp himself, the Emir of Sistan and the Khwarazmshah, including two other unnamed kings. Nizari forces were also present in Sanjar&#x27;s army. After being victorious, Ahmad then restored the domains of Garshasp II. Ahmad then marched as far as Baghdad, where he agreed with Mahmud that he should marry one of his daughters, and that he should give up strategic territories in northern Persia.

In 1141, Ahmad, along with Garshasp II, marched to confront the Kara Khitan threat and engaged them near Samarkand at the Battle of Qatwan. He suffered an astounding defeat, and Garshasp was killed. Ahmad escaped with only fifteen of his elite horsemen, losing all Seljuq territory east of the Syr Darya (Jaxartes).

Sanjar&#x27;s as well as the Seljuks&#x27; rule collapsed as a consequence of yet another unexpected defeat, this time at the hands of the Seljuks’ own tribe, the Ghuzz Turks, in 1153. Sanjar was captured during the battle and held in captivity until 1156. It brought chaos to the Empire - situation later exploited by the victorious Turkmens, whose hordes would overrun Khorasan unopposed, wreaking colossal damage on the province and prestige of Sanjar. Sanjar eventually escaped from captivity in the fall of 1156, but soon died in Merv (present-day Turkmenistan), in 1157. After his death, Turkic rulers, Turkmen tribal forces, and other secondary powers competed for Khorasan, and after a long period of confrontations, the province was finally conquered by the Ghurids in 1192, and by the Khwarazmians in the early 1200s.

== Death and legacy ==

Sanjar died in 1157 and was buried in Merv. His tomb was destroyed by the Mongols in 1221, during their invasion of the Khwarezmian Empire.

The death of Sanjar meant the end of the Seljuq dynasty as an empire, since they controlled only Iraq and Azerbaijan afterwards. Sanjar is considered one of the most prominent Seljuq sultans and was the longest reigning Muslim ruler until the Mongols arrived. Although of Turkic origin, Sanjar was highly Iranized, and due to his feats, even became a legendary figure like some of the mythological characters in the Shahnameh. Indeed, medieval sources described Sanjar as having &quot;the majesty of the Khosrows and the glory of the Kayanids&quot;. Persian poetry flourished under Sanjar, and his court included some of the greatest Persian poets, such as Mu&#x27;izzi, Nizami Aruzi, and Anvari.

== Family ==
One of his wives was Turkan Khatun. She was the daughter of Muhammad Arslan Khan, the ruler of the Kara-Khanid Khanate. She died in April 1156, and was buried in Yusuf Hamadani Mausoleum Complex in Merv. Another wife was Abkhaziyya Khatun. She was the daughter of King Demetrius I of Georgia, and the widow of his nephew Sultan Ghiyath ad-Din Mas&#x27;ud. They married after Mas&#x27;ud&#x27;s death in 1152. One of Sanjar&#x27;s daughters was Mah-i Mulk Khatun. She was born in 1105. In probably 1119, Sanjar married her to his nephew Mahmud II. When she died aged seventeen in 1122, Sanjar sent another daughter, Amir Sitti Khatun, to be his wife. Melik Shah III and Gawhar Nasab Khatun were the children of this union. She died in 1129. Amira Khatun, another of Sanjar&#x27;s daughters married Abbasid Caliph Al-Mustarshid in 1124. Another daughter of Sanjar, Gawhar Khatun, married his nephew, Ghiyath ad-Din Mas&#x27;ud in 1134. A daughter of this union was married by Mas&#x27;ud to his nephew Dawud, son of Mahmud II. They failed to get on together, and Ma&#x27;sud gave his daughter to Dawud&#x27;s brother, Muhammad II.

<doc id="582612" wikidata="Q152563" url="?curid=582612" title="Blouse">
<text>A blouse () is a loose-fitting upper garment that may be worn by workmen, peasants, artists, women, and children. It is typically gathered at the waist or hips (by tight hem, pleats, parter, or belt) so that it hangs loosely (&quot;blouses&quot;) over the wearer&#x27;s body. Today, the word most commonly refers to a girl&#x27;s or woman&#x27;s dress shirt, although there is considerable confusion between a true blouse and a women&#x27;s shirt. It can also refer to a man&#x27;s shirt if it is a loose-fitting style (e.g. poet shirts and Cossack shirts), though it rarely is. Traditionally, the term has been used to refer to a shirt which blouses out or has an unmistakably feminine appearance, although even many &quot;standard&quot; shirts today have a somewhat blousy fit, and the numbers of men wearing such shirts may match (or even exceed) that of women wearing actual blouses.

The term is also used for some men&#x27;s military uniform jackets.

==Etymology==
Blouse is a loanword from French to English (see Wiktionary entry ). Originally referring to the blue blouse worn by French workmen, the term &quot;blouse&quot; began to be applied to the various smocks and tunics worn by English farm labourers. In 1870, blouse was first referenced as being &quot;for a young lady.&quot;

It is suggested that the French form of the word comes from the Latin &quot;,&quot; from the Egyptian town of Pelusium, a manufacturing center in the Middle Ages, or alternatively from Provençal &quot;() &quot; &#x27;short (wool)&#x27;.

==Description==

Blouses usually consist of light fabrics such as silk or thin cotton fabrics, until the early 1990s are often made of softly falling synthetic fibers (e.g. polyester). Sometimes they are decorated with frills, embroidery or loops. The classic of the ladies&#x27; blouses is the white shirt blouse (following the classic elegant white men&#x27;s shirt). Here the combination possibilities are particularly diverse. The open spade, peter pan, reverse and revere collar is another common type of classic ladies&#x27; blouse.

Blouses are often made of cotton or silk cloth and may or may not include a collar and sleeves. They are generally more tailored than simple knit tops, and may contain details such as ruffles, a tie or a soft bow at the neck, or embroidered decorations.

Tailoring provides a closer fit to the wearer&#x27;s shape. This is achieved with sewing of features such as princess seams or darting in the waist and/or bust.

Blouses (and many women&#x27;s shirts with buttons) usually have buttons reversed from that of men&#x27;s shirts (except in the case of male military fatigues). That is, the buttons are normally on the wearer&#x27;s left-hand and the buttonholes are on the right. The reasons for this are unclear, and several theories exist without having conclusive evidence. Some suggest this custom was introduced by launderers so they could distinguish between women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s shirts. One theory purports that the tradition arose in the Middle Ages when one manner of manifesting wealth was by the number of buttons one wore. Another that the original design was based on armour which was designed so that a right-handed opponent would not catch their weapon in the seam and tear through, and that a person could draw a weapon with their right-hand without catching it in a loose seam of their own clothes.

Female servants were in charge of buttoning their mistress&#x27;s gowns (since the buttons were usually in the back). They tired of attempting to deal with buttons that were, from their point of view, backwards and, as such they started reversing the placement when making or repairing them. One other theory is that women were normally dressed by their maids, while men dressed themselves. As such, women&#x27;s blouses were designed so it could be easily buttoned by the maid but that of men were designed so it could be easily buttoned by the person wearing it.

Although in all the cases proposed the reasons for the distinction no longer exist, it continues out of custom or tradition.

While most women prefer to have the top button open for better comfort, some blouses made for women have looser necklines so the top button can be fastened without compromising comfort, but giving the same stylish appearance.

Some women attach various pins and ornaments to their blouses over a fastened top button for style. Some of these attach directly to the button itself, others to the collars.

==History==

===Pre-WW1===
Blouses are historically a cask style, mostly mail-like garment, that were rarely part of the fashionable woman&#x27;s wardrobe until the 1890s. Before that time, they were occasionally popular for informal wear in styles that echoed peasant or traditional clothing, such as the Garibaldi shirt of the 1860s.

Some blouses do not have a top button at all, and collars are intentionally styled to be open. They also form part of some nations&#x27; traditional folk costume.

During the later Victorian period blouses became common for informal, practical wear. A simple blouse with a plain skirt was the standard dress for the newly expanded female (non-domestic) workforce of the 1890s, especially for those employed in office work. In the 1900s and 1910s, elaborate blouses, such as the &quot;lingerie blouse&quot; (so-called because they were heavily decorated with lace and embroidery in a style formerly restricted to underwear) and the &quot;Gibson Girl blouse&quot; with tucks and pleating, became immensely popular for day-wear and even some informal evening wear. Since then, blouses have remained a wardrobe staple, so by now blouses have not ceased to be fixed in the &quot;popular cloakroom&quot; style.

German magazine &quot;Die Woche&quot; wrote in 1913 about ladies&#x27; blouses in connection with riding:
:&quot;Even if more and more justification is given for the hot summer days of the casual blouse, the classic riding dress made of velvet or English linen still remains unmatched.&quot;

At the end of the 19th century the sailor blouses derived from sailor suits were popular for girls to the blue pleated skirt. In the time of National Socialism this piece of clothing was rejected as a bourgeois-decadent. In the 1950s, the sailor&#x27;s look then entered the leisure mode for adults.

The high collar in blouses was pushed out during this time by the halsferne variant. Specialist shops also offered &quot;ladies&#x27; cloaks&quot;. KdW in Berlin applied in his illustrated main catalog: 1913 among other things a backfisch-confection, with eight blouses between 2.75 and 9.50 Marks. The simplest model was a &quot;wash blouse, navy, white spotted&quot;, the most expensive one &quot;blouse, white, wash, with tip and stick&quot;. One of the novelties of the season was the pointed &quot;Charmeuse blouse, very elegant form, pure silk, with very fluffy crepe and lace gown&quot;.

===The inter-war years=== 
Various new and different forms of collar emerged in the 1920s. They diminished in sizes by the 1950s, but were often large in the 1930s.

The silk &#x27;jumper blouse&#x27; and the low-cut &#x27;V-neck shirt&#x27; (or Chelsea collared blouse) were the fashion hit of the 1920s. They had full length, short, length and bell shaped sleeves.

===Styles since World War Two===
The size of collars had diminished by the 1950s, but were huge in the 1930 s. At the beginning of the 1970s, popular styles included the rounded collar, sausage dog collar, then extra wide collar and double cuffs from shirts, that fell on them often from fashions relating to synthetic fabrics like usually polyester. The fashion of standing collar and federal collar, loops, rounded collars, revere collar and the smallest collar, sometimes with concealed button fly on a &quot;smoking blouse&quot;, attached folds and stressed set-in-followed in the 1980s. Again, thin and often shining synthetic fibres were very popular. Towards the end of the 20th century, they were of an extra-long blouses of pants style and worn over trousers or skirt worn, optionally combined with a rather wide belt around the waist in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Poland, the UK, Ireland, South Africa and North America.

The sleeves had been shortened during the early 1950s to the and length in Europe. They were reduced again in the mid-1990s and are now regularly at the , , and length around the world. As the eye will be drawn to the naked flesh below the sleeve, designers often use sleeve length to focus the minds eye on the slimmer parts of the arm, particularly short sleeve blouses below the elbow to give the illusion of a slimmer arm. Sleeveless tops were fashionable and a topical item in Western Europe and North America during the mid-2000s.

Many fashionable styles of both the 1970s and 1980s were on the go again after the millennium in the blouse fashion: double cuffs, extra wide pointed collar, belt around the waist, synthetic fibre and the like. Often the blouses also embroidery or &quot;crystal stocking&quot;, have especially on collar and string. The blouses with the so-called three-quarter arm were a striking phenomenon of the 1990s. Blouses can be combined well and easily with a blazer, tank top, bolero or sweater, with or without some colourful silks or bead chain necklaces. The change in fashion in blouse is very visible now. Mostly the sleeves have been changed and it turned out to be more modern and fashionable. Sleeves have played a major role in blouse designs.

===Eco movement===
As part of the Eco movement, folk blouses for women were cut from natural materials such as flax, linen and cotton. Men also wore these &quot;Frisian blouses&quot; on occasion.

==Cultural blouse styles==

===Use with a dirndl===

The traditional dirndl of Bavaria and rural Austria is usually worn with a white blouse. These blouses are usually made of light fabric (textile), such as silk or cotton thin, until the early 1990s still often from soft covered by art (such as polyester and satin). They often have fanciful decorations (such as frills, embroidery, or grinding) and are a classic among the women&#x27;s blouses—here the fashionable combination possibilities are especially varied. The open Spaten—or lapel collar—is another common type of a classic ladies&#x27; blouse.

The blouse is worn under the bodice of the dirndl. It is cropped above the midriff. The blouse changes the overall effect of the dirndl especially through the cut of its neckline. A deeply cut blouse combines with a deeply cut bodice to accentuate décolletage, whereas a blouse with a high neckline creates a more modest effect. In traditional designs, the blouse neckline is at the base of the throat. Other popular necklines are V-shaped, balconette or heart-shaped. Materials most often used are cambric, linen or lace; the colour is usually white. Short puff sleeves are typical, although narrow sleeves (short or long) are also common.
===Use in Aboyne dress===

In one version, a tartan pattern skirt is worn with an over-the-shoulder plaid, a white blouse and petticoat, and a velvet bodice. The alternative is a white dress over a petticoat, together with a tartan pattern sash. A typical Aboyne dress consists of a dark bodice or elaborate waistcoat, decorative blouse, full tartan skirt and some times a petticoat and apron. Some have a tartan sash (usually draped over the shoulder and coming down towards the hem of the skirt in the back) rather than an apron.

=== The blouse jacket or blouson ===

The blouse jacket or blouson is garment drawn tight at the waist with blousing hanging over the waist band. The new style of man&#x27;s Chetten loose blouse coat is made of stronger material or with inner lining, which can be worn alone or as a step on for a top. It is related to the Eisenhower jacket.

<text>Lodewijk van den Berg (; March 24, 1932 – October 16, 2022) was a Dutch-born American chemical engineer. He studied crystal growth and flew on a 1985 Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; mission as a payload specialist.

Van den Berg was born in the Netherlands and was an astronaut; he was a naturalized American and not a Dutch citizen when he flew on the Challenger. He was married and had two children. He lived in Florida and worked as a chief scientist at the Constellation Technology Corporation.

==Education and early career==
Van den Berg was born in Sluiskil, Netherlands. He was educated in the Netherlands and attended the Technical University Delft from 1949 to 1961, where he graduated with an MSc degree in chemical engineering. He then moved to the United States and went to the University of Delaware where he obtained an MSc degree in applied science in 1972 followed by a PhD in applied science in 1975.
He then was offered a job at EG&amp;G Corporation Energy Measurements in Goleta, California, working in crystal growth. EG&amp;G was a defense contractor of the United States government and their business handled sensitive information in the field of science. Van den Berg was required to become a naturalized US citizen and became a US citizen in 1975. Van den Berg worked many years in research and acquired management experience in the preparation of crystalline materials—in particular, the growth of single crystals of chemical compounds, and the investigation of associated defect chemistry and electronic properties. He became an international authority on vapor growth techniques with an emphasis on mercuric iodide crystals and its application in the nuclear industry as gamma ray detectors. While working at EG&amp;G, Van den Berg asked NASA for permission to conduct crystal growth experiments in space and NASA agreed.

==Spaceflight==
===Selection===
Van den Berg and his colleagues designed the EG&amp;G Vapor Crystal Growth System experiment apparatus for a Space Shuttle flight. The experiment required an in-flight operator and NASA decided that it would be easier to train a crystal growth scientist to become an astronaut, than it would be the other way around. NASA asked EG&amp;G and Van den Berg to compile a list of eight people who would qualify to perform the science experiments in space and to become a Payload Specialist. Van den Berg and his chief, Dr. Harold A. Lamonds could only come up with seven names. Lamonds proposed adding Van den Berg to the list, joking with Van den Berg that due to his age, large glasses, and little strength he would probably be dropped during the first selection round; but at least they would have eight names. Van den Berg agreed to be added to the list, but didn&#x27;t really consider himself being selected to be a realistic scenario.

Van den Berg easily passed the first round of tests. The final four candidates had to pass physical and mental exams while two of the other candidates failed the exams due to possible heart issues. He was now part of the final two; NASA always trains two astronauts, a prime and a back-up. In 1983 he started to train as an astronaut and six months before the launch he was told that he would be the prime astronaut, much to his own surprise. He was 53 years old when he went to space becoming one of the oldest rookie astronauts.

===STS-51B===
Van den Berg was a payload specialist on STS-51B &quot;Challenger&quot; (April 29 – May 6, 1985). STS-51B, the Spacelab-3 mission, was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. It was the first operational Spacelab mission. The seven-man crew aboard &quot;Challenger&quot; conducted experiments in crystal growth, drop dynamics leading to container-less material processing, and atmospheric trace gas spectroscopy. Solar and planetary atmospheric simulation, cosmic rays, and laboratory-animal, and human medical monitoring experiments were performed.

While a co-investigator of the Vapor Crystal Growth System (VCGS) experiment, Van den Berg supervised crystal growth aspects of the VCGS experiment.

During the mission Van den Berg traveled over 2.9 million miles orbiting Earth 110 times and logged more than 168 hours in space.

==Career after NASA==
After returning to Earth, Van den Berg continued to work on crystal growth experiments at EG&amp;G in California and he became the head of the materials science section. He moved to Florida becoming a chief scientist at the Constellation Technology Corporation. At age 72 he continued to work up to 40 hours a week and grow crystals, a process he compared to gardening. The mercuric iodide crystals he grew are used to make precision detectors for nuclear radiation. The detectors are used in medical applications, by the defense industry, and by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

==Personal life==
Van den Berg visited the Netherlands every two years, and was the subject of a short 2004 documentary, named &quot;The &quot;Forgotten Astronaut&quot;&quot;, by the tv-show Netwerk on the Dutch public broadcasting channel Nederland 2. In Terneuzen, which is a city five miles from Sluiskil, a secondary school has been named after him, i.e. the Lodewijk College.

Van den Berg died on October 16, 2022, at the age of 90.

==Asteroid==
On September 28, 2007, a main belt asteroid 11430 (9560 P-L) was named after him; it is now known as 11430 Lodewijkberg. The asteroid was discovered on October 17, 1960, by Cornelis Johannes van Houten and Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld at Leiden Observatory. They were studying photographic plates taken by Tom Gehrels using the Palomar Observatory&#x27;s Samuel Oschin telescope.

<doc id="582630" wikidata="Q944386" url="?curid=582630" title="Wubbo Ockels">
<text>Wubbo Johannes Ockels (28 March 1946 – 18 May 2014) was a Dutch physicist and astronaut with the European Space Agency who, in 1985, became the first Dutch citizen in space when he flew on STS-61-A as a payload specialist. He later became professor of aerospace engineering at Delft University of Technology.

==Education and early life==
Ockels was born in Almelo, Netherlands, but considered Groningen to be his hometown. He obtained his MSc degree in physics and mathematics in 1973 and subsequently a PhD degree in the same subjects in 1978 from the University of Groningen. His thesis was based on experimental work at the Nuclear-physics Accelerator Institute (KVI) in Groningen.

From 1973 to 1978, Ockels performed experimental investigations at the Nuclear Physics Accelerator Institute in Groningen. His work concerned the gamma-ray decay of nuclear systems directly after formation and the development of a data-handling system involving design of electronics and programming of real-time software. He also contributed to the design and construction of position-sensitive charged particle detectors. While at the K.V.I. Institute, Ockels supervised the practical work of first-year physics students at the University of Groningen.

==ESA career==

In 1978, Ockels was selected by the European Space Agency (ESA) as one of three European payload specialists to train for the Spacelab 1 mission. In May 1980, under the terms of an agreement between ESA and NASA, Ockels and Swiss astronaut Claude Nicollier were selected to begin basic mission specialist training with the NASA astronaut candidates at NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas.

In September 1981 Ockels withdrew from training to focus on Spacelab, and did not become a NASA mission specialist. He rejoined the Spacelab 1 crew for training as a back-up payload specialist to operate experiments. This mission of a reusable, scientific research facility built by the European Space Agency (ESA) took place aboard the Space Shuttle in November 1983. Spacelab 1 was a joint NASA/ESA mission. He was the first Dutch citizen astronaut, not the first Dutch-born astronaut, as he is preceded by the naturalized American Lodewijk van den Berg, who flew on STS-51-B. Having served his role as back-up payload specialist for German astronaut Ulf Merbold, he took his place in Mission Control in Houston as the primary communicator between the astronauts working in Spacelab and the Mission Management Team in Houston.

Ockels flew as a payload specialist on the crew of STS-61A Challenger (30 October to 6 November 1985). STS-61A was the West German D-1 Spacelab mission. It was the first to carry eight crew members, (five Americans, two Germans and Ockels); the largest to fly in space; and was also the first in which payload activities were controlled from outside the United States: from the DLR control center in Germany. More than 75 scientific experiments were completed in the areas of physiological sciences, materials science, biology, and navigation. At mission conclusion Ockels had traveled 2.5 million miles in 110 Earth orbits, and logged over 168 hours in space.

A small planetoid was named after Wubbo Ockels by the International Astronomical Union. The planetoid orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. The object&#x27;s full name is 9496 Ockels.
Ockels was a member of the American Physical Society and the European Physical Society. From 1999 to 2003, he was head of ESA&#x27;s Office for Educational Projects Outreach Activities.

==Scientific career==
In 1992, Ockels was appointed part-time professor of aerospace engineering (in particular, Aerospace for Sustainable Engineering and Technology) at Delft University of Technology, and promoted to full-time professor in September 2003. In this function, he oversaw the Nuna projects. He also proposed the development of a Superbus, a new method of high speed (250 km/hour) public transportation by road. The public transportation company Connexxion was the first company to invest in the development of this Superbus.

While working at the university he assisted and advised the Nuon Solar Team, a solar racer team consisting of students, which won the biennial World Solar Challenge four consecutive times from 2001 to 2007. Ockels was also the initiator of the Superbus project. He also cofounded the sustainable engineering firm &quot;The Green Canals&quot; (De Groene Grachten).

In 2009, Ockels presented a talk arguing that the notion of time is human-constructed as a result of our interpretation of the effects of gravity.

==Personal life==
Ockels was married, had two children and two grandchildren.

His sister was politician Marjet Ockels.

===Health and death===
In August 2005, Ockels suffered a severe heart attack, which required his hospitalization. He recovered well and was able to resume his work at the Delft University of Technology. On 29 May 2013 it was announced that Ockels had an aggressive form of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma) with a metastasis in his pleural cavity, and a life expectancy of one to two years. He died from complications of cancer on 18 May 2014.

<text>The Europrop International TP400-D6 is an 11,000 shp (8,200 kW) powerplant, developed and produced by Europrop International for the Airbus A400M Atlas military transport aircraft. The TP400 is the most powerful turboprop in service using a single propeller; only the Soviet-designed Kuznetsov NK-12 and Progress D-27, using contra-rotating propellers, are larger.

==Development==

The TP400 was originally selected by Airbus Military to power the A400M in December 2000. However, Airbus reopened the engine competition in February 2002, because the engine core, which is based on the Snecma M88 turbofan fighter engine, was too heavy and used too much fuel. By May 2002, Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada (P&amp;WC) announced a proposal involving a turboprop with a core based on its PW800 turbofan, a regional jet engine under development that had a geared fan at the time; the concept would later be called the PW180. In 2003, around the 30 April decision deadline, Airbus Chief Executive Noel Forgeard told reporters that the P&amp;WC proposal was 20 percent cheaper than for the TP400, and that he would have chosen to give the contract to P&amp;WC, but government officials requested an extension for the companies to revise their bids. Before the final bids were modified, sources claimed that P&amp;WC&#x27;s offering, which had a European production percentage of 75 percent, was lower by USD$400 million. On 6 May, amidst pressure from European political and business leaders, Airbus awarded a USD$3.4 billion contract to Europrop to produce 900 engines for the A400M, despite accusations of European protectionism. A member of Europrop claimed after the decision that the TP400 contract would only increase the costs of the USD$22.7 billion A400M program by about 1–2 percent compared to if the PW180 had been selected.

The signing of the A400M contract between Airbus Military and the European defense purchasing agency OCCAR on May 27, 2003 marked the beginning of the aircraft development program, which was planned to last 77 months (). At the 2003 Paris Air Show, Europrop signed a 300 million euro contract with former engine consortium partner Avio to supply the gearboxes. However, because of mechanical and aerodynamic problems that Lockheed Martin encountered on its C-130J Super Hercules upgrade, which used new engines and propellers that had half the planned output of the TP400, Airbus retained the option to select the engine configuration and the propeller for itself. The TP400 development schedule, which was considered very ambitious, had the bench run of the engine targeted for within 27 months () of the contract signing, or August 2005. In spite of Europrop&#x27;s insistence that testing on a specialized engine testbed aircraft was unnecessary, Airbus pushed for such a program on the Airbus A300 or A340 starting 11 months after the first ground tests. The engine testbed program would cost Airbus an estimated €40 million.

In July/August 2003, Airbus signed a contract worth up to USD$830 million with Ratier-Figeac to supply the propellers, which would be in diameter and have eight composite blades. By May 2004, Airbus decided that the A400M design would have a &quot;handed&quot; propeller configuration, meaning that the pair of propellers on each wing would turn in opposite directions known as rotating &quot;down between engines&quot;. Two different gearboxes are required, one with extra components to reverse the rotation of the propeller. This counter-rotating propeller design meant the TP400 engine would have to be certificated for two different gearbox/propeller configurations. Airbus awarded Marshall Aerospace a contract in December 2004 to flight test the TP400 engine on a Lockheed C-130K Hercules aircraft, targeting flights in mid-2006 and hoping for a first flight in April of that year. Other testbed airframes considered were the Ilyushin Il-76 and what was thought to be the favorite, Airbus&#x27;s own A340-300 testbed aircraft, because, unlike the C-130, it could reach the A400M maximum cruise speed. The TP400 large propeller would still have enough ground clearance with the engine installed on the A340 low-mounted wing.

According to the engine master program presented in September 2006, the TP400 was to reach its first engine run by the end of August 2005, followed by the first combined engine and propeller run by the end of that year. The TP400 would fly on its own specialized testbed aircraft by the end of 2006, and the engine would be certified with the &quot;handed&quot; propeller by the end of October 2007, 54 months () into the engine program. The first test flight of the TP400-powered A400M would follow by the end of the next month, and engine certification with the baseline propeller would occur by the end of March 2008. Finally, the qualification test would finish by the end of January 2009.

After a two-month delay, the engine first ran on 28 October 2005 using a dynamometer to absorb and measure the power developed by the engine. During subsequent testing, the engine reached full power. On 28 February 2006, the engine was tested for the first time with the propeller installed. Europrop delivered the first TP400 engine for engine testbed flight testing on 19 November 2007. In June 2008, the TP400 had a first ground run on the inboard port wing of the C-130K engine testbed, and integration was completed onto the first A400M production aircraft. After 24 hours of ground runs and taxi trials, the first flight of a single TP400-D6 engine took place on 17 December 2008. Airbus and Marshall completed flight testing on the C-130K testbed aircraft completed on 30 September 2009 after 18 flights, 55 flight hours, and 61 hours of ground tests, although the design of the C-130K airframe limited the maximum cruise speed to Mach 0.64 instead of the TP400 propeller&#x27;s Mach 0.72 maximum. On 18 November 2009, an A400M test aircraft completed a ground run for the first time with all four TP400 engines, quickly followed by the A400M&#x27;s first taxi trial on 23 November 2009. On 11 December 2009, the maiden flight of the A400M took place. The engine earned civil certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) on 6 May 2011. By April 2012, EASA certified Ratier-Figeac&#x27;s FH385/FH386 propellers for the TP400, and on 13 March 2013 it granted a type certificate for the A400M aircraft. The aircraft and engine officially entered service on 30 September 2013 with the French Air Force.

Several technical problems delayed the engine&#x27;s certification test program and pushed the entire A400M aircraft program into further scheduling adjustments. The engine delays were primarily due to problems with completing the full authority digital engine control (FADEC) software to the satisfaction of the civil authorities. More specifically, Europrop determined in mid-2008 that the engine worked correctly, but the FADEC software still did not meet EASA requirements. Since the A400M was intended for humanitarian missions, the aircraft also needed to have a civil certification. Europrop did not realize that this meant that every change made to the software in the FADEC had to be documented to enable traceability so EASA denied civil certification of the software. Because of this problem, the first A400M test aircraft, which was flight-ready by September 2008, was not permitted to fly. Europrop had to triple the size of its workforce to fix the issue, resulting in a FADEC system consisting of over 275,000 lines of code, which was four times more complex than the FADEC software for the largest civil jet engine.

Further problems arose in 2016 with the propeller gearbox. It showed abnormal wear and inadequate management of the heat generated in the reduction gearing which required premature servicing. This problem led to the German Air Force temporarily grounding two of its three A400M aircraft, and also resulted in a Royal Air Force aircraft suffering an inflight engine shutdown. An interim fix for this engine issue was certified in July 2016. The gearbox issues persisted, and as of July 2018, the final fix was planned to be introduced by the end of that year.

==Design==
The TP400 has a three-shaft configuration, consisting of a two-shaft gas generator followed by a free-power turbine. It has a chin air intake, for its mass flow of .

In the gas generator, the low pressure compressor, called an intermediate pressure compressor (IPC) by Europrop International because it is driven by an IP turbine, is designed by MTU Aero Engines and has five stages. The high-pressure compressor (HPC) is designed by Rolls-Royce and has six stages, the first two of which are variable. Design lessons learned and experience gained on previous engine programs are incorporated in the design of the TP400. Snecma supplied the combustor, which is based on the combustor of its M88 turbofan fighter engine. To drive the HPC, Snecma designed the high pressure turbine (HPT), also using M88 experience. The MTU design for their IPT uses Turbo-Union RB199 and Eurojet EJ200 turbofan fighter engine experience. Both the Snecma HPT and the MTU IPT have one stage with unshrouded HPT blades and IPT blades with shrouds. The shaft connecting the IPC to the IPT rotates in the opposite direction to the HP shaft through which it passes. The overall pressure ratio is 25:1. The IP compressor has a pressure ratio of 3.5:1, and the HP compressor a pressure ratio of 7:1.

The low pressure turbine (LPT) is provided by Industria de Turbo Propulsores (ITP), and it is derived from the LPT of the Rolls-Royce BR715 regional turbofan. This free-power turbine drives the propeller through a third coaxial shaft and a reduction gearbox. The Avio-produced gearbox has a maximum power output of about . Reduction occurs in two stages: a first-stage offset design, followed by a second-stage planetary system. The total reduction gear ratio is about 9.5:1. The maximum gearbox output torque is . Early prototype gearbox cases were made using aluminum alloy, but magnesium alloy is used for production engines to reduce weight. Two slightly different gearbox designs are required on each aircraft to make two propellers turn in one direction and the other two in the opposite direction depending on their position on the wing. The difference in the gearbox is the addition of an idler gear so those without the idler gear turn in one direction and those with turn in the opposite direction. The respective engines are known as baseline and handed, either of which may also be fitted with a propeller brake.

The propeller is designed by Ratier-Figeac and has a diameter of . The reversible, variable-pitch propeller holds eight blades, each having a carbon spar enclosed by a composite shell and a polyurethane coating. Its blades have a scimitar shape that results in a sweep angle of about 55 degrees at the blade tips, which have a helical speed of at the A400M&#x27;s cruise speed of Mach 0.68. The propeller has four rotational speed settings: 655, 730, 842 and 860 rpm. The 655 rpm setting is for low-altitude cruise, 730 rpm for normal cruise, and 842 rpm for takeoff and special maneuvers. The propeller converts the engine power into of thrust.

<text>Euronext Dublin (formerly the Irish Stock Exchange, ISE; ) is Ireland&#x27;s main stock exchange, and has been in existence since 1793.

The Euronext Dublin lists debt and fund securities and is used as a European gateway exchange for companies seeking to access investors in Europe and beyond. With over 35,000 securities listed on its markets, the exchange is used by over 4,000 issuers from more than 85 countries to raise funds and access international investors.

A study by Indecon (international economic consultants) published in 2014 on the Irish Stock Exchange found that having a local stock market and securities industry directly supports 2,100 jobs in Ireland and is worth €207 million each year to the Irish economy. It also found that having a domestic securities industry centred on the Irish Stock Exchange generates €207 million in estimated direct economic impact (measured in Gross Value Added or GDP) and €230 million in direct tax for the Irish exchequer (including stamp duty on trading in Irish shares).

The exchange is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland under the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulations (MiFID) and is a member of the World Federation of Exchanges and the Federation of European Stock Exchanges.

== History ==

The Irish Stock Exchange was first recognised by legislation in 1799 when the Irish Parliament passed the (39 Geo. 3. c. 60 (I)). The exchange originally operated from the Royal Exchange and was built so that businessmen could sell goods and commodities and trade bills of exchange. In different periods of its history, the ISE included a number of regional exchanges, including the Cork and Dublin exchanges. In 1973, the Irish exchange merged with British and other Irish stock exchanges becoming part of the International Stock Exchange of Great Britain and Ireland (now called the London Stock Exchange).

In 1837, Samuel Lewis records the stock exchange offices as having moved from the Royal Exchange to the Commercial Buildings on Dame Street, close to the present day offices of the stock exchange at Anglesea Street in Temple Bar, stating that:


Under the (No. 9) it became independent again and in April 2014 it demutualised changing its corporate structure and becoming a plc which is owned by a number of stockbroking firms.

At the time of its demutualisation, the country&#x27;s main stockbrokers received shares in the €56m-valued exchange and dividing up €26m in excess cash. Davy Stockbrokers took the largest stake, at 37.5 per cent, followed by Goodbody Stockbrokers with 26.2 per cent; Investec with 18 per cent; the then Royal Bank of Scotland Group 6.3 per cent; Cantor Fitzgerald 6 per cent; and Campbell O’Connor with 6 per cent.

In March 2018, Euronext completed the purchase of the ISE, and renamed the ISE as Euronext Dublin.

==Markets==

The Irish Stock Exchange operates four markets – the Main Securities Market, the principal market for Irish and overseas companies; the Enterprise Securities Market (ESM), an equity market designed for growth companies; the Global Exchange Market (GEM), a specialist debt market for professional investors and the Atlantic Securities Market (ASM), a market dedicated to companies who wish to dual list in Ireland and the United States.

== Equity markets for listed companies ==
There are currently 50 companies with shares listed on the markets of the Irish Stock Exchange.

There are three markets on which for companies to list equities on the ISE:
* The Main Securities Market (MSM), suited to larger companies with substantial funding needs 
* The Enterprise Securities Market (ESM), for high-growth companies raising equity in earlier stages of development
* The Atlantic Securities Market (ASM), for multinational companies that want to broaden their investor reach to include dollar and euro pools of capital in a streamlined manner

==Money raised==

In 2016, 11 companies trading on the ISE raised €513m in equity funds from international investors. New equity listings in 2016 came from Venn Life Sciences, Draper Esprit, and Dalata Hotel Group, which transferred its listing from the ESM to a primary listing on the MSM in June 2016.

In 2015 the largest biotech ever to IPO in Europe took place on the ISE when Malin Corporation, the Irish-based global life sciences company, raised €330m from international investors in an exclusive listing on the ISE. Three other IPOs took place in 2015 raising a further €650m: Applegreen, Permanent TSB and Hostelworld.

In 2014 three companies joined the ISE&#x27;s markets: Dalata Hotel Group, the largest hotel operator in Ireland, Irish Residential Properties REIT plc, the first residentially focused REIT to list in Ireland and Mainstay Medical, an Irish medical device company.

These three companies raised a combined total of €700 at IPO. Total fund raising in 2014 of listed companies was €1.7 billion.

== Trading and membership ==
The ISE offers domestic and international membership for trading in shares, ETFs, Irish Government bonds and other securities using world-class, easily accessible and cost-effective trading and post-trade infrastructure.

The ISE&#x27;s electronic processing system is called ISE Xetra and is provided in partnership with Deutsche Börse since the ISE closed its trading floor in Anglesea Street (a listed building) Dublin 2 on 6 June 2000. Shares trading on the ISE are settled by Euroclear Bank and cleared by Eurex Clearing AG.

The ISE is the main centre of liquidity in Irish shares. The company with the highest turnover on the ISE in 2016 was CRH. This was followed Ryanair, Paddy Power Betfair, Bank of Ireland and Kerry Group.

Trading volumes on the exchange in 2011 were about a quarter of the 2007 peak. In June 2012, following the collapse of a stockbroker, the Sunday Independent asked &quot;Will there even be a stand-alone Irish equity market in five years&#x27; time? The omens are not good.&quot; However this has proven not to be the case as in 2016 the number of equity trades had increased by 17.4% to 6.6m, up from 5.6m in 2015, the first time trading has reached over 6m trades and the sixth consecutive year of growth in trade numbers.

==Debt markets==

The ISE is among the leading centres globally for the listing of debt securities with statistics showing debt listings growing by more than 7% in 2016 to reach over 29,000 securities. The ISE was ranked at #2 among global exchanges according to rankings released by the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) at the end of December 2016.

The ISE offers two markets for the listing of debt securities: the Global Exchange Market (GEM), an exchange-regulated market and multilateral trading facility (MTF), for banks, companies and sovereigns listing debt, and the Main Securities Market (MSM). Major global companies listing debt on ISE&#x27;s markets include Vodafone plc, Whirlpool, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Ryanair, Coca-Cola and Ferrari.

== Fund markets ==
The ISE is the #1 centre for listing investment funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) globally according to statistics released by the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), with 1,041 new fund classes admitted in 2016. Global investment managers can choose from one of two markets when listings funds: the MSM or GEM.

Notable investment managers listing funds on ISE markets include Tideway, BNY Mellon, PIMCO and Fidelity Investments.

== ISEFundHub ==
In 2014 the ISE launched ISEFundHub, an information portal for funds listed on the ISE and funds domiciled in Ireland. The portal displays important information such as fund net asset values (NAVs) and key fund documents as well as extensive performance-based analytics. The service is offered by the ISE in partnership with FundConnect, a Danish-based funds infrastructure provider in the European market.

==Other services==

Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) services

The ISE is endorsed by the Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC) and sponsored by the Central Bank of Ireland as a Local Operating Unit (LOU) for the processing of Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) services for Ireland. LEIs are codes designed to create a global reference data system that uniquely identifies every legal entity or structure, in any jurisdiction, that is party to a financial transaction. Businesses may apply for an LEI code through ISEdirect. LEIs were brought in by global regulators as part of the response to the global financial crisis.

International Securities Identity Number (ISIN) services

An International Securities Identity Number (ISIN) is a code that uniquely identifies a specific securities issue. The ISE is the National Numbering Agency in Ireland for ISIN codes and is a member of the global industry body the Association of National Numbering Agencies (ANNA).

Information services

The ISE is the official source of market data on ISE markets and publishes a range of market indices. The published index of shares is known as the Irish Stock Exchange Quotient or ISEQ Overall Index. Other equity indexes of the exchange include the ISEQ ESM Index, the ISEQ 20, the ISEQ General, ISEQ SmallCap, and ISEQ Financial. The ISE also has two other ISEQ 20 based indices, the ISEQ 20 Capped Index and the ISEQ 20 Leveraged Strategy Index.

The ISE also publishes a range of bond indices.

Announcement services

The ISE files and publish regulatory documents and announcements for issuers enabling them to comply with their regulatory obligations.

==Criticism==

Two reports of an investigation into the &quot;wholly inappropriate sale of perpetual bonds&quot; by Davy Stockbrokers to credit unions failed to involve any of the credit unions affected, leaving them &quot;in the dark and powerless to add any value to the findings of this investigation&quot;. The ISE, who have Davy as one of its largest shareholders, then declined to give them access to the reports. The chairman of one of the Credit Union&#x27;s who suffered large losses told his members &quot;The failure to publish the reports is to place the complaints process in a shroud of secrecy. Such a failure of openness, transparency and fairness can only serve to undermine confidence in the complaints process, forcing those with grievances into the courts. Such a course of action is not in the interest of any of the stakeholders&quot;.

In April 2010, Financial Regulator at the Central Bank of Ireland told the same committee that &quot;senior management of the exchange should step up to the plate&quot; after failing to help charities, credit unions and rich individuals who received letters informing them that many investments made by stockbrokers over the past decade are now worthless.

The Central Bank began an unprecedented investigation into the entire stockbroking community in December 2011. The 12-month-long investigation found &quot;major problems&quot; and that there would have to be mergers of firms to ensure the industry survives. This merger process will have to be done in a controlled way – because any instability in the sector could pose a danger to many people&#x27;s savings, and prevent new businesses from raising money at a time when banks are not lending.

In September 2012 it was forced to issue a correction after it reported figures to the market that suggested a surge in trading in government bonds, in one case as much as 85pc of the year&#x27;s volume of trades were reported to have gone through the system in a single day.

<text>Brody Dalle (born Bree Joanna Alice Robinson; 1 January 1979) is an Australian singer, songwriter, and musician. She began playing music in her adolescence and moved to Los Angeles at the age of 18, where she founded the punk rock band The Distillers. The group released three albums before disbanding in 2006. She began another project, Spinnerette, which released an eponymous album in 2009. In 2014, she released &quot;Diploid Love&quot;, her first album under her solo name.

==Early life==
Brody Dalle was born Bree Joanna Alice Robinson in Melbourne on 1 January 1979. She was raised in the Fitzroy and Northcote suburbs of Melbourne. Dalle&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Giacomo Costa, an Italian Australian professional wrestler best known by his ring name, Al Costello, and the creator and original member of the tag team The Fabulous Kangaroos. Her father left their family when she was young. Her parents later married other people; through her father&#x27;s second marriage, she is the older half-sister of actress Morgana Robinson. She did not have much contact with Robinson until the two met backstage after a Distillers show in 2004, where Robinson revealed that their father now lives &quot;in Leeds or some shit&quot;. Dalle was sexually abused as a child, spending much of her teenage years in court cases surrounding the abuse. She began training to be an Olympic swimmer as a teenager. She attended and was expelled from two Catholic high schools in Melbourne before dropping out. She also used drugs and later said, &quot;I was never a junkie, I was never shoeless and selling my mum&#x27;s car to a Gypsy. I just experimented, like everyone else.&quot;

==Career==
===1993–2006: Early projects and the Distillers===
Dalle was intrigued by Cyndi Lauper and the Beatles as a child. At age 12, she discovered bands such as Nirvana, and cited Courtney Love and her band Hole (as well as other female-led punk groups such as Babes in Toyland and Bikini Kill) as early influences. Her musical career began at 13 years old, starting with guitar. She participated in Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School (RnRHS), a Melbourne feminist collective started by Stephanie Bourke. She became interested in Black Flag, Discharge, and Flipper. In 1995, a few days before her 17th birthday, her first band, Sourpuss, played a set at Australia&#x27;s Summersault Festival where she met Tim Armstrong, frontman of punk rock band Rancid. The two pursued a relationship and were engaged in 1997, shortly after Dalle turned 18. She moved with Armstrong from Melbourne to Los Angeles and there founded The Distillers.

The Distillers released their eponymous debut album in 2000. By the recording of their second album, &quot;Sing Sing Death House,&quot; the band had a new line-up, and by the time of their third album &quot;Coral Fang&quot;, Dalle was then the only remaining original member. The album received acclaim and comparisons to Hole, with Dalle often compared to Courtney Love and later to PJ Harvey. The band experienced success with several singles from the album and performed at Lollapalooza. In 2001, Dalle also made a cameo in New Found Glory&#x27;s music video &quot;My Friends Over You&quot; with then-husband Tim Armstrong, as well as his bandmates from Transplants, Travis Barker and Rob Aston.

===2007–2011: Spinnerette and later work===
Burned out and tired of one another following a grueling two-year tour, the Distillers broke up in 2005. Dalle began work on a new project called Spinnerette with Alain Johannes of Eleven. On 11 December 2008, the band released their first EP entitled &quot;Ghetto Love&quot;, with an accompanying video directed by Liam Lynch. A full-length self-titled album was released on 17 June 2009.

Dalle has also played on tracks for the band Eagles of Death Metal under various monikers and appeared on the song &quot;Weigh on My Mind&quot; on the Transplants&#x27; debut album in 2002. She has also made vocal appearances on Queens of the Stone Age&#x27;s &quot;You Got a Killer Scene There, Man&quot; on their 2005 album &quot;Lullabies to Paralyze&quot; and also an appearance on Leftöver Crack&#x27;s song &quot;Muppet N.A.M.B.L.A&quot; from their 2004 album &quot;Rock the 40 Oz: Reloaded&quot;. In 2009, she made an appearance in the same song as her husband, Josh Homme, on &quot;Bargain Healers&quot; from the French artist Nosfell on his self-titled album. In 2011, Brody Dalle was featured on the Boots Electric song &quot;Boots Electric Theme.&quot;

===2012–2015: Solo work===
In November 2012, Dalle announced on Twitter that she was working on a solo album, featuring Alain Johannes, Michael Shuman of Queens of the Stone Age, and Shirley Manson of Garbage.

In November 2013, Dalle announced that she had signed to Caroline Records, a division of Universal Music Group, intending to release her debut solo album in early 2014. The album was produced by Alain Johannes, and features guest appearances from Shirley Manson of Garbage, Nick Valensi of the Strokes, and Warpaint&#x27;s Emily Kokal. Dalle supported Nine Inch Nails and Queens of the Stone Age on their Australia/New Zealand tour in March 2014 to promote the album.

In February 2014, Dalle released the first single from her debut solo album, &quot;Diploid Love&quot;, which would be released on 28 April 2014. The single, &quot;Meet The Foetus / Oh The Joy&quot;, featured backing vocals by Shirley Manson and Emily Kokal. The second single from the album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess With Me&quot;, was used in the soundtrack of the Square Enix game &quot;Life Is Strange: Before the Storm&quot;.

===2018–present: The Distillers reunion===
In January 2018, Dalle shared links from her Twitter account to a newly made Twitter account for The Distillers, as well as a previously established/archival Instagram account for the band. A teaser video was put up across all platforms, confirming the return of the band.

==Personal life==
In 1995, at the age of 16, Dalle met 30-year-old Rancid frontman Tim Armstrong when both of their bands played at Summersault. She was with the band Sourpuss at the time. She moved to Los Angeles in 1997 to be with Armstrong, and they married later that year. They went through a bitter divorce in 2003, after Armstrong saw a picture of Dalle kissing Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme in an issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine; she and Homme would later marry. Rancid&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Indestructible&quot; featured songs such as &quot;Fall Back Down&quot; that dealt with the divorce and Armstrong&#x27;s feelings towards it. Dalle has said that Armstrong was very controlling of her and that it took her three years to leave him. When she finally did, he and his friends criticised Dalle in the press, and she claims he threatened the male members of the Distillers and blacklisted anyone associated with them. After her divorce, Dalle reverted to using the surname of her favourite actress, Béatrice Dalle.

During her separation from Armstrong, Dalle reconnected with Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme, having previously met him at Lollapalooza in 1996 when he was 23 and she was 17; she was still dating Armstrong at the time. The two began dating, which led to a backlash from Armstrong and his fans. Homme claimed to have received multiple death threats from Armstrong&#x27;s fans. Dalle married Homme on 3 December 2005. They have a daughter named Camille Harley Joan Homme (born 17 January 2006) and two sons named Orrin Ryder Homme (born 12 August 2011) and Wolf Dillon Reece Homme (born 13 February 2016). 

Dalle filed for legal separation in November 2019 and divorce a month later, citing Homme&#x27;s alcoholism and drug abuse; he subsequently entered rehab, but over the following months, he and Dalle accused each other of domestic violence and had restraining orders filed. Dalle requested that restraining orders be filed against him on behalf of their sons in September 2021, alleging physical and emotional abuse, but was denied by two judges. In 2023, Homme won sole custody of the children and was granted a restraining order against Dalle after it was discovered that her new boyfriend had forged the children&#x27;s signatures on certain legal documents.

<doc id="582687" wikidata="Q1191096" url="?curid=582687" title="Jñāna">
<text>In Indian philosophy and religions, (, ) is &quot;knowledge&quot;.

The idea of &quot;jñāna&quot; centers on a cognitive event which is recognized when experienced. It is knowledge inseparable from the total experience of reality, especially the total or divine reality (Brahman). There are also some categorised terms like physical &quot;Jñāna,&quot; spiritual &quot;Jñāna&quot; and ultimate &quot;Jñāna&quot; of Self-Realisation. 

The root ज्ञा- &quot;jñā-&quot; is cognate to Slavic znati, English &quot;know&quot;, as well as to the Greek γνώ- (as in γνῶσις &quot;gnosis&quot;) and Lithuanian žinoti. Its antonym is अज्ञान &quot;ajñāna&quot; &quot;ignorance&quot;.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Jñāna&quot; sometimes transcribed as &quot;gyaan&quot;, means &quot;knowledge&quot; in Sanskrit. The root jñā- is cognate to English &quot;know&quot;, as well as to the Greek γνώ- (as in γνῶσις &quot;gnosis&quot;). Its antonym is &quot;ajñāna&quot; &quot;ignorance&quot;.

==In Buddhism==

In Tibetan Buddhism, &quot;jñāna&quot; (Tibetan: &quot;ye shes&quot;) refers to pure awareness that is free of conceptual encumbrances, and is contrasted with &quot;vijñāna&quot;, which is a moment of &#x27;divided knowing&#x27;. Entrance to, and progression through the ten stages of &quot;jñāna&quot; (Bodhisattva &quot;bhūmi&quot;s)&quot;, will lead one to complete Enlightenment and nirvana.

In Theravāda Buddhism there are various &quot;vipassana&quot;-&quot;ñānas&quot; or &quot;insight knowledges&quot; on the path of insight into the true nature of reality. As a person meditates these &quot;ñānas&quot; or &quot;knowledges&quot; will be experienced in order. The experience of each may be brief or may last for years and the subjective intensity of each is variable. Each &quot;ñāna&quot; could also be considered a &quot;jhāna&quot; although many are not stable and the mind has no way to remain embedded in the experience. Experiencing all the &quot;ñānas&quot; will lead to the first of the four stages of enlightenment, then the cycle will start over at a subtler level.

==In Hinduism==
=== Nyaya ===
In Nyaya, &quot;jñāna&quot; is a mental event, better translated as cognition rather than knowledge. &quot;Jñāna&quot; can be true or false. &quot;Jñāna&quot; is not belief, but lead to the formation of belief. All true cognitions reflect their object. However, true cognitions do not always arise from a source of knowledge. True cognitions can also arise accidentally.

===Vedanta===
In Vedanta, Jnana refers to &quot;salvific knowledge&quot;, or knowledge that leads to liberation (&quot;moksha&quot;). The Upanishads, forming the concluding part of the Vedas, are regarded as the repository of this spiritual knowledge, and are thus referred to as the &quot;jnanakanda&quot;. Prajñānam Brahma (प्रज्ञानम् ब्रह्म), one of the Mahāvākyas, roughly means &quot;Insight is Brahman&quot; or &quot;Brahman is Insight&quot;.

===Yoga===
Jñāna yoga (ज्ञानयोग, lit. Yoga of Knowledge) is one of the three main paths (मार्ग, &quot;margas&quot;), which are supposed to lead towards &quot;moksha&quot; (मोक्ष, liberation) from material miseries. The other two main paths are Karma yoga and Bhakti yoga. Rāja yoga (राजयोग, classical yoga) which includes several yogas, is also said to lead to &quot;moksha&quot;. It is said that each path is meant for a different temperament of personality.

== In Jainism ==

According to the Jain texts like Tattvārthsūtra (śloka 1.9) and Sarvārthasiddhi, knowledge is of five kinds:
# &quot;Mati Jñāna&quot; (Sensory Knowledge)
# &quot;Śruta Jñāna&quot; (Scriptural Knowledge)
# &quot;Avadhi Jñāna&quot; (Clairvoyance)
# &quot;Manaḥ prayāya Jñāna&quot; (Telepathy)
# &quot;Kevalā Jñāna&quot; (Omniscience)

== In Sikhism ==
&quot;Gyan&quot; or &quot;Gian&quot; refers to spiritual knowledge. Learned people are often referred to as &quot;Giani&quot;. It is mentioned throughout the Guru Granth Sahib.

<doc id="582691" wikidata="Q7316896" url="?curid=582691" title="Retraction in academic publishing">
<text>In academic publishing, a retraction is a mechanism by which a published paper in an academic journal is flagged for being seriously flawed to the extent that their results and conclusions can no longer be relied upon. Retracted articles are not removed from the published literature but marked as retracted. In some cases it may be necessary to remove an article from publication, such as when the article is clearly defamatory, violates personal privacy, is the subject of a court order, or might pose a serious health risk to the general public.

== Procedure ==

A retraction may be initiated by the editors of a journal, or by the author(s) of the papers (or their institution). Retractions are typically accompanied by a retraction notice written by the editors or authors explaining the reason for the retraction. Such notices may also include a note from the authors with apologies for the previous error and/or expressions of gratitude to persons who disclosed the error to the author. Retractions must not be confused with small corrections in published articles.

There have been numerous examples of retracted scientific publications. Retraction Watch provides updates on new retractions, and discusses general issues in relation to retractions.

== History ==
A 2011 paper in the &quot;Journal of Medical Ethics&quot; attempted to quantify retraction rates in PubMed over time to determine if the rate was increasing, even while taking into account the increased number of overall publications occurring each year. The author found that the rate of increase in retractions was greater than the rate of increase in publications. Moreover, the author notes the following:&quot;It is particularly striking that the number of papers retracted for fraud increased more than sevenfold in the 6 years between 2004 and 2009. During the same period, the number of papers retracted for a scientific mistake did not even double...&quot; (p. 251). Although the author suggests that his findings may indeed indicate a recent increase in scientific fraud, he also acknowledges other possibilities. For example, increased rates of fraud in recent years may simply indicate that journals are doing a better job of policing the scientific literature than they have in the past. Furthermore, because retractions occur for a very small percentage of overall publications (fewer than 1 in 1,000 articles), a few scientists who are willing to commit large amounts of fraud can highly impact retraction rates. For example, the author points out that Jan Hendrik Schön fabricated results in 15 retracted papers in the dataset he reviewed, all of which were retracted in 2002 and 2003, &quot;so he alone was responsible for 56% of papers retracted for fraud in 2002—2003&quot; (p 252).

During the COVID-19 pandemic, academia had seen a quick increase in fast-track peer-review articles dealing with SARS-CoV-2 problems. As a result, a number of papers have been retracted made &quot;Retraction Tsunami&quot; due to quality and/or data issues, leading many experts to ponder not just the quality of peer review but also standards of retraction practices.

Retracted studies may continue to be cited. This may happen in cases where scholars are unaware of the retraction, in particular when the retraction occurs long after the original publication.

The number of journal articles being retracted had risen from about 1,600 in 2013 to 10,000 in 2023. Most of the retractions in 2023 were contributed by Hindawi journals. The significant number of retractions involving Chinese co-authors—over 17,000 since 2021, including 8,000 from Hindawi journals—has led China to launch a nationwide audit addressing retractions and research misconduct. Retractions are also measured among highly cited researchers.

== Alternative versions of retraction ==

=== Retraction with replacement ===
A low percentage of retracted papers can be due to unintentional error within the author(s) work. Rather than removing the entire article, retraction with replacement has been a new practice to help authors avoid being seen as dishonest for mistakes that were not purposefully done. This method allows the author to fix their mistakes from the original paper, and submit an edited version to take the original paper’s place. The journal can decide to retract the original paper then upload the fixed version online, usually with a notice placed stating “Retraction and Replacement,” or “Correction,” on the article page. For example, &quot;JAMA&quot; will post the edited version with a retraction and replacement notice, along with a link to the original article, while &quot;Research Evaluation&quot; will use the term &quot;correction&quot; with a link posted on the updated article, referring to the old article.

=== Self-retraction ===
Self-retraction is a request from an author and/or co-authors to retract its own work from being published. Self-retraction by an author is recommended because once it gets retracted from the journal, then it can affect the author(s) because investigations can begin which will have an effect the author&#x27;s reputation. If one retracts their own work on their terms, it would show more integrity and honesty as they are owning up to their own mistakes, just like the authors mentioned in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; have done. Scientists at times have been asked to retract their work even though their work is exact and bold; the root cause of the problem should be looked into to avoid retractions. A system to distinguish papers from &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; would be beneficial to researchers. This system may save the reputation of scientists and researchers. Most researchers publish honest work and sometimes simple mistakes happen to be overlooked by the peer review process. Retraction should not be for simple spelling errors, but for inaccurate, skewed, and fraudulent data. For example, today new technologies are being developed in a culture of transparency to align the opportunity to record false claims. Another solution is for researchers to use a term “self-citation” since citations look identical therefore they are classified in databases. Recommending a same database to evaluate the researchers own work can help lessen retractions.

* 2013 - Study on the Mediterranean diet published in &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; and widely covered by media was retracted due to unreported non-random assignments. This was part of a larger effort verifying proper randomization in thousands of studies by anesthesiologist John Carlisle, who found problems in about 2% of those analyzed.
* 2012 - Séralini affair - Article suggesting reported an increase in tumors among rats fed genetically modified corn and the herbicide RoundUp retracted due to criticism of experimental design. According to the editor of the journal, a &quot;more in-depth look at the raw data revealed that no definitive conclusions can be reached with this small sample size&quot;.
* 2003 Retracted &quot;Science&quot; article on ecstasy. See Retracted article on neurotoxicity of ecstasy.

=== Retraction for fraud or misconduct ===
* 2021 An article studying the open source community by Qiushi Wu and Kangjie Lu at the University of Minnesota was withdrawn after the Linux Foundation discovered that the researchers submitted patches for the Linux kernel with intentional bugs and without obtaining appropriate consent.
* 2020 On January 8, 2020, Russian journals retracted more than 800 articles after a large-scale investigation conducted by the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) following claims of unethical publications.
* 2018 On 11 April 2019, two articles on DNA damage by Abderrahmane Kaidi of the University of Bristol, one published in &quot;Science&quot; in 2010 and another in &quot;Nature&quot; in 2013, were retracted following evidence of data fabrication.
* 2017 Five articles in the field of consumer behavior and marketing research, by Brian Wansink at Cornell University, came under scrutiny after peers pointed out inconsistencies in the data. Wansink had written a blog post about asking a graduate student to &quot;salvage&quot; conclusions. Cornell University launched an investigation, which determined in 2018 that Wansink had committed academic misconduct. Wansink resigned. Wansink has since had 18 of his research papers retracted as similar issues were found in other publications.
* 2014 An article by Haruko Obokata et al. on STAP cells, a method of inducing a cell to become a stem cell, was proven to be falsified. Originally published in &quot;Nature&quot;, it was retracted later that year. It generated much controversy, and after an institutional investigation, one of the authors committed suicide.
*2011 Eight journal articles authored by Duke University cancer researcher Anil Potti and others, which describe genomic signatures of cancer prognosis and predictors of response to cancer treatment, were retracted in 2011 and 2012. The retraction notices generally state that the results of the analyses described in the articles could not be reproduced. In November 2015, the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) found that Potti had engaged in research misconduct.
*2010 A 1998 paper by Andrew Wakefield proposing that the MMR vaccine might cause autism, which was responsible for the MMR vaccine controversy, was retracted because &quot;the claims in the original paper that children were &quot;consecutively referred&quot; and that investigations were &quot;approved&quot; by the local ethics committee have been proven to be false.&quot;
*2009 Numerous papers written by Scott Reuben from 1996 to 2009 were retracted after it was discovered he never actually conducted any of the trials he claimed to have run.
*2007 Retraction of several articles written by social psychologist Jennifer Lerner and colleagues from journals including &quot;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&quot; and &quot;Biological Psychiatry&quot;.
*2006 Retraction of &quot;Patient-specific embryonic stem cells derived from human SCNT blastocysts&quot;, written by Hwang Woo-Suk. Fabrications in the field of stem cell research led to &#x27;indictment on embezzlement and bioethics law violations linked to faked stem cell research&#x27;.
*2003 Numerous articles with questionable data from physicist Jan Hendrik Schön were retracted from many journals, including both &quot;Science&quot; and &quot;Nature&quot;.
*2002 Retraction of announced discovery of elements 116 and 118. See Livermorium, Victor Ninov.
*1991 Thereza Imanishi-Kari, who worked with David Baltimore, published a 1986 article in the journal &quot;Cell&quot; on immunology, which showed unexpected results on how the immune system rearranges its genes to produce antibodies against antigens it encounters for the first time. Margot O&#x27;Toole, a postdoctoral researcher for Imanishi-Kari, claimed that she could not reproduce Imanishi-Kari&#x27;s results and alleged that Imanishi-Kari had fabricated the data. After a major investigation, the paper was retracted when the National Institutes of Health concluded that data in the 1986 Imanishi-Kari article had been falsified. Five years later, in 1996, an expert panel appointed by the federal government found no evidence of scientific fraud and cleared Imanishi-Kari of misconduct, although the paper was not reinstated.
*1982 John Darsee. Fabricated results in the Cardiac Research Laboratory of Eugene Braunwald at Harvard in the early 1980s. Initially thought to be brilliant by his boss. He was caught out by fellow researchers in the same laboratory.

=== Retraction for ethical violations ===

* 2019 An article by Wendy Rogers (Macquarie University, Australia) and colleagues on &quot;BMJ Open&quot; called for the mass retraction of more than 400 scientific papers on organ transplantation, amid fears the organs were obtained unethically from Chinese prisoners. Wendy Rogers said the journals, researchers and clinicians who used these studies were complicit in these methods of organ trafficking. According to the study, the transplant research community has failed to live up to the ethical standards for using organs from death row inmates that are still being published. These widespread unethical violations in research will cause many unpredictable consequences for science. In 2019, &quot;PLOS ONE&quot; also retracted 21 articles related to this incident.
* 2017 The journal &quot;Liver International&quot; retracted a Chinese study of liver transplantation because 564 livers grafted in the course of the research over 4 years could not be traced. The experts pointed out that it was implausible a hospital could have so many freely donated livers for transplantation, given the small number of donors in China at the time.

=== Retraction over data provenance ===
* 2020 On 22 May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, an article was published in &quot;The Lancet&quot; which claimed to find evidence, based on a database of COVID-19 patients, that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine increase the chance of patients dying in hospital as well as the chance of ventricular arrhythmia. Medical researchers and newspapers expressed suspicions about the validity of the data, provided by Surgisphere, which is founded by one of the authors of the study. The article was formally retracted by 4 June 2020, on request by the lead author Mandeep Mehra.

=== Retraction over public relations issues ===
* 2016 On March 4, 2016, an article in &quot;PLOS ONE&quot; about the functioning of the human hand was retracted due to outrage on social media over a reference to &quot;Creator&quot; inside the paper (#CreatorGate).
* 1896 Jose Rizal was said to have issued a letter of retraction regarding his novels and other published articles against the Roman Catholic Church, see José Rizal: Retraction controversy.

<text>The history of Canberra details the development of the city of Canberra from the time before European settlement to the city&#x27;s planning by the Chicago architect Walter Burley Griffin in collaboration with Marion Mahony Griffin, and its subsequent development to the present day.

==Pre-colonisation-history==

Before European settlement, the area which eventually became the Australian Capital Territory was inhabited by Indigenous Australians, who spoke a Ngarigo dialect. Historical sources have identified them as different tribes with a range of names. Archaeological evidence of settlement in the region includes inhabited rock shelters, rock paintings and engravings, burial places, camps and quarry sites, and stone tools and arrangements. The evidence suggests human habitation in the area for at least 21,000 years.

European exploration began with in the Canberra area as early as the 1820s. Canberra was &quot;discovered&quot; on 7 December 1820 by Charles Throsby Smith, Joseph Wild and James Vaughan. four successive expeditions whose routes took in the Canberra area were those of Charles Throsby in October 1820, Charles Throsby Smith in December 1820, Major John Ovens and Captain Mark Currie in 1823, and Allan Cunningham in 1824. All four expeditions explored the course of the Limestone now Molonglo River that is now the site of Lake Burley Griffin. Smith and Cunningham also penetrated further south, into what is now called the Tuggeranong Valley.

It was estimated by Robertson that prior to European settlement starting in 1824, depending on the season there were about 300-400 Aboriginals living in the Molonglo, Queanbeyan, Canberra, Namadgi region. As the settlers took over land, many Aboriginals migrated to other districts such as Cooma and Tumut. The population was also significantly reduced when the death rate increased significantly due to diseases introduced by the Europeans. By the 1880s there were no full-blood people in the district, with only some fifty mixed race people. These people were employed either as labourers or domestics on stations. Due to the lack of European women, many white men had relationships with mixed race women so even further diluting Aboriginal heritage.

The 2013 ACT Government report &quot;Our Kin Our Country&quot; on the connection to the area by present-day ACT Aboriginal inhabitants, concluded:
===European settlement===

The Molonglo River was recorded as the &quot;Yeal-am-bid-gie&quot; in 1820 by the explorer Charles Throsby. Later it was referred to as the Limestone River, and the Fish River. The Moolinggolah people of the district around Captains Flat probably gave the Molonglo its current name.

European settlement in the area began in October 1824 when Joshua John Moore, the owner of Horningsea near Liverpool, was given a &quot;ticket of occupation&quot; for north of the Limestone River covering the area now called Civic extending north to Dickson. A flock of sheep was driven onto the property in December 1824 by the overseer John McLaughlin. He built a slab hut on what is now called Acton Peninsula. This was named Camberry later Canberry Cottage. A creek that ran through the middle of the property originating from the side of Mount Ainslie was named Canberry Creek. On 12 October 1828, a deed for a further to the west was issued to Moore in consideration of £250. Moore was always an absentee landlord and took no interest in running the property. The station continued to be called Canberry/Camberry, from 1824 until 1843 when it was sold to Arthur Jeffreys, who renamed it Acton and built a more substantial homestead called Acton House.

In 1825 James Ainslie, a purported Waterloo veteran, herded sheep down to the district for Robert Campbell. He occupied land at the base of Mount Pleasant near the Limestone River, which he called &quot;Pialigo&quot;. A stone cottage was built, Limestone Cottage, which later was expanded to become Duntroon House and the property named Duntroon when the Campbells took up residence and acquired land extending down to Queanbeyan. Ainslie, who remained there till 1835, also received a grant of for assisting in the capture of two bushrangers Tennant and Dublin Jack. Ainslie later returned to Scotland.

In 1827 John McPherson was given a ticket of occupation for the land to the west of Canberry extending to include the now named Black Mountain. He called the station Springbank, with the homestead just to the east of the junction of the Limestone River with Canberry Creek. The first white child born in the area was a daughter, born into the Macpherson family in 1830. In 1831 MacPherson was granted title to the property extending to the now named Black Mountain. Other sheep stations were built in turn by further settlers. Initially, these properties were owned by absentee landlords, but later resident families moved in. For future development, blocks for village settlements were gazetted at Pialigo, Tageranong to the south, Palmerstone to the north, and Yarrolumla to the west near the Murrumbidgee River.

The local Aboriginals of this time tended to refer to themselves as the Nyamudy people and spoke a dialect of the Ngarigo language, while the settlers called them the Limestone Plains Blacks or Pialigo Mob. The indigenous population of the district declined to less than a hundred by 1840. In stark comparison, by 1851 there were about 2,500 European people living in the area. Apart from a few employed on stations Aboriginals disappeared by the 1860s with most moving to the better hunting grounds of land near the Cooma and Tumut districts. A few from the Sutton, Hall and Fairlight localities moved north to Yass.

Construction of the church of St John the Baptist started in 1841 on land purchased from Robert Campbell adjacent to the Canberry station. This included a glebe. When the first rector was appointed the rectory was the rented Canberry Cottage, thus the church was referred to as being at Canberry in the parish of Queanbeyan. Later the lands south of the Limestone River were also called Canberry extending down to Canberry Hill, now Red Hill, with the road going over Church Crossing.

When the district was further divided into parishes in the County of Murray, the name given of the parish was &quot;Canberry&quot;, but was then changed to &quot;Canberra&quot;. It extended over a wide area north nearly to Yass and west to the Cotter River

There were a number of European families who achieved status in the area. These included the Campbell family and the Palmer family. In the late 1820s and early 1830s, there was a conflict between two of these families – the Johnstons (descended from Major George Johnston who was involved in the Rum Rebellion) and the Martins – for the ownership and financial control of land that is now known as Weston Creek and Tuggeranong.

Prominent, too, in the early life of the district were the Gibbes and Murray families, who were related by marriage.

Irish-born Sir Terence Aubrey Murray, MLC, owned the Yarralumla estate (now the site of Australia&#x27;s Government House) from 1837 until 1859. In the latter year, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes, who was joined at the property by his elderly parents, Elizabeth Gibbes and Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes, the retired Collector of Customs for NSW. Augustus Gibbes made improvements to the estate and he remained Yarralumla&#x27;s resident proprietor until 1881 when he sold it to his neighbour Frederick Campbell.
The Campbells, and their patriarch, Robert Campbell, were a particularly influential group in the area&#x27;s early history. The Campbells were Scottish and brought many other Scots to the district as workers. The land that they owned included Duntroon House that is now the Officers Mess at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, Yarralumla and the Oaks Estate. The latter most got its name from a mansion built there by Campbell called the Oaks. When the Campbell family later sold the land it was on for subdivision and development, it was on condition that the Oaks and the land that it to remain intact and not be renamed. There are still members of the Campbell family living in Canberra.

The European population in the Canberra area continued to slowly grow throughout the rest of the 19th century. One prominent building, the Anglican St John&#x27;s Church, was consecrated and opened for use in 1845. This building still stands today and its graveyard holds the burials of many of Canberra&#x27;s 19th-century pioneers. A schoolhouse was also attached to this building. By 1851, there were about 2,500 people living in the area – a vast majority of which were stockmen. Some assigned convict labour was also used in this area during the 1830s and 1840s. The weather in the area was said to be harsh, with frosty winters and fierce hail-storm episodes, and drownings in local watercourses were a fairly common occurrence. The drowning victims included the first rector of the Anglican Church of St John the Baptist, which was Canberra&#x27;s first purpose-built place of worship.
Blundells&#x27; Cottage was built in 1859 for William Ginn, the head ploughman for the Duntroon Estate. The cottage&#x27;s second occupants where newlyweds George and Flora Blundell, after whom the cottage was named.

The area&#x27;s Aboriginal population dwindled as the European presence increased, mainly due to the impact of diseases such as smallpox and measles. Another reason for the shrinking Aboriginal population base was that their ability to hunt, and therefore survive, was impeded by homesteads being placed on traditional hunting grounds. By 1862, the remnant Aboriginal People were mainly of mixed European and indigenous blood. They held their last full corroboree by the Molonglo River in that year. Aboriginal culture and its people had largely ceased to exist in the region, with its members largely absorbed into the European mainstream by 1878 as a consequence of inter-marriage. &quot;Queen Nellie&quot; Hamilton, a Ngarigo Woman who had been married to a Ngambri Man, Bobby Hamilton, is said to have been the last full-blood Aboriginal Person dwelling in the environs of Canberra during the 19th century. She died in the nearby town of Queanbeyan in 1897.

==20th century==

===Creation of the Australian Capital Territory===

The district&#x27;s transformation from a New South Wales rural area to a built-up national capital began during political debates over Federation in the late 19th century. Due to the Victorian gold rush, Melbourne was Australia&#x27;s largest city and a potential place for the capital. However Sydney was Australia&#x27;s oldest city, and so also had a justifiable claim to host the new nation&#x27;s Federal polity. Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria, Melbourne&#x27;s state of location —supported Melbourne. However, New South Wales (the largest colony) and its neighbouring northern state, Queensland, favoured Sydney. Perhaps one or another of the two colonial capitals might have eventually been acceptable to the smaller states, but the Sydney–Melbourne rivalry was such that neither city would ever agree to the other one becoming the capital.

Eventually, a compromise was reached: Melbourne would be the capital on a temporary basis while a new capital was built somewhere between Sydney and Melbourne. As Victoria was relatively small in geographical area, Section 125 of the Constitution specified that the capital must be placed in a Commonwealth territory within New South Wales but at least from Sydney. Various Commonwealth governmental bodies continued to operate principally from Sydney or Melbourne after 1927. Most civil service departments were moved to Canberra in the 1950s, and the High Court of Australia was finally moved from Melbourne to Canberra in 1980.

After an extensive search, the present site, about south-west of Sydney, in the foothills of the Australian Alps, was chosen in 1908 as a result of survey work done by the government surveyor Charles Scrivener in that year. Two people who campaigned strongly for the Federal capital to be in the Canberra area were John Gale, the publisher of &quot;The Queanbeyan Age&quot; and Federal politician King O&#x27;Malley. The choice of site was a disputed one, and narrowly beat Dalgety, a small town near the NSW/Victoria border.

The new Federal Capital Territory (later named Australian Capital Territory) was created on 1 January 1911 when the NSW government ceded 2,360 square kilometres of land including the seaport of Jervis Bay to the Commonwealth Government. In that same year, the ACT became an alcohol-free area as a result of legislation that the Minister for Home Affairs, King O&#x27;Malley, steered through the Federal Parliament in Melbourne. This era of prohibition is commemorated today in the form of a pub named after O&#x27;Malley that was established in the city centre of Canberra in 2000.

An international competition was held in 1911 by O&#x27;Malley to select a design for the layout of the capital city. An American architect, Walter Burley Griffin, won the competition in 1913. Although submitted in Walter&#x27;s name, the plan was actually designed collaboratively with his architect wife and professional partner Marion Mahony Griffin. His idea was to divide the proposed city into halves, using a lake as a dividing point. The two resulting sections were to be designated the civilisation part and the governmental part. A variety of names were suggested for the capital, including Olympus, Paradise, Captain Cook, Shakespeare, Kangaremu, Sydmeladperho, Eucalypta and Myola. Myola was the personal favourite of the prime minister, Andrew Fisher. However, when Billy Hughes was told of his preference, he said, &quot;It sounds like the last despairing cry of an Italian prostitute&quot;.
The name of Canberra was eventually settled upon. At midday on 12 March 1913, the city was officially given this name by Lady Denman, at a ceremony on Kurrajong Hill (now known as Capital Hill). This historic occasion was officiated over by the Australian Prime Minister, Andrew Fisher. The city now commemorates the event as &quot;Canberra Day&quot; each year, always on the second Monday of March.

===The name Canberra===

The name Canberra was given to the planned city as the central area was in the parish of Canberra. The area originally had been in the parish of Queanbeyan, but in 1850 a separate parish was established with St John the Baptist being the parish church. According to church records, land was purchased from the Campbell property to build the church and establish a 100-acre (40 ha) glebe. The parsonage was &quot;Canberry Cottage&quot;, the rented original building on the adjacent property called Acton but originally called Camberry from 1825 until 1843. The flat land on either side of the Molonglo River near the church was referred to as the Canberry Plain while the road south went over a ford called Church Crossing. To the south of the plain was Canberra Hill, now Red Hill. Finally by 1865 the location of St Johns Church started to be spelt Canberra by the rector, Pierce Galliard Smith, against the wishes of Robert Campbell the original owner of the land on which the church was built, and who provided much of the financial cost for constructing the church and adjacent school house.

However, substantive information on the reason for the original choice of the name Camberry, or why the spelling changed, is non-existent. The dispute over the derivation has been going on for over a hundred years without resolution. It has been the subject of numerous contradictory learned academic papers, and letters/articles in the press.

There are numerous unsubstantiated theories put forward for the derivation of the name for the riverside property &quot;Camberry Station&quot; from English sources. First, it was due to the profusion of the wild raspberry bushes growing there. Second, the raspberry bushes were actually Cranberry bushes. Third, a St. John&#x27;s church history said the church location was named after the district of Canbury in Kingston upon Thames in England, while other sources suggest Canberry in north London and Canbury in Kent. There is also a theory the original intention was to name it Camberry after the River Cam, and Cambridge where the original owner came from.

There are numerous unsubstantiated theories put forward for the derivation being from an Aboriginal source. These include that the word Canberra is derived from the rendition into written English of the Aboriginal name Ngambri, which allegedly was the name of a small camp site north of the Molonglo river on the side of Black Mountain, which subsequently became part of the pastoral property &quot;Springbank&quot;. There are five non-evidenced theories for the latter; that it was an Aboriginal word meaning alternatively &quot;meeting place&quot;, &quot;neutral place&quot;, &quot;corroboree ground&quot;, the &quot;head of the river&quot;, the &quot;space between a woman&#x27;s breasts&quot;, or after the bird kookaburra or &quot;laughing jackass&quot;. There is also a dispute whether this Aboriginal word came from the Ngarigu, Nyamudy, Kamilroi, Walgalu or Wiradhari language. Academic reconstruction of the various pronunciations by different Europeans results in a theoretical Aboriginal name for a Black Mountain peninsular camp site as Ng-aan-bira, of unknown or no meaning, in the local Nyamudy peoples dialect of the Ngarigu language. However, there is no contemporary recorded Aboriginal use of the word until after the name Canberry was used for the area around St John the Baptists Church.

The Molonglo River was recorded as the &quot;Yeal-am-bid-gie&quot; in 1820 by the explorer Charles Throsby. Later it was referred to as the Limestone River, and the Fish River. The Moolinggolah people of the district around Captains Flat probably gave the Molonglo its current name.

===The Griffins&#x27; design for Canberra===

==== The picturesque====
Following the federation of Australia on 1 January 1901 and the eventual selection of the Australian Capital Territory to accommodate a capital city in 1908, Surveyor Charles Scrivener was responsible for locating the city&#x27;s specific site. Scrivener&#x27;s selection was guided by instructions to assess sites from &quot;a scenic standpoint, with a view to securing the picturesque, and with the object of beautification&quot;. Hence from the outset, in accordance with Renaissance fashion in Britain, emphasis was placed on the picturesque, that is utilising the intrinsic beauty of the natural world, and affirmed that the future capital&#x27;s landscaping and aesthetics would be just as important as its functionality.

Prior to the selection of the site, Congress delegate Isaac Evans wrote a paper, &quot;A Waterside Federal Capital&quot;, which, despite being written to advocate a different site altogether, identified large bodies of water as improving the appearance and perspective of the city&#x27;s form. Similarly, the design criteria for the capital encouraged such a creation. Furthermore, Evans also romantically described the future capital&#x27;s dwellings as &quot;dotted amongst the foliage&quot;, implying that Evans envisioned a picturesque capital representative of the wider view of Australian society whose relatively new population were beginning to identify with the iconic surroundings of the Australian outback.

Consequently, this enabled the picturesque site to act as a proxy for the &quot;Old World&#x27;s&quot; culture, relics, and established nature which the young colony innately lacked. By continuing to build upon this forming identity, a picturesque capital would &quot;obscure the nation&#x27;s youth and…register its membership within the British Empire&quot;. Hence, although Canberra is undoubtedly Australian with respect to its landscaping and wider location, the underlying motivations for these aspects &quot;remained colonial&quot; and &quot;rooted&quot; in the &quot;Old World&quot;.

====Design and influences====
Utilising and capturing the picturesque of the landscape was essential to the success of the Griffins&#x27; design and was achieved by integrating the territory&#x27;s topography into their design rather than designing to avoid it. An example of this is the Molonglo Valley, which was utilised as a position for an artificial, grand central lake which satisfied part of the design criteria (Lake Burley Griffin). With respect to capturing the picturesque, Griffin&#x27;s lake centrepiece was a selling point of their design. It is likely that the Griffins were familiar with, and influenced by, the work of fellow Chicagoan Daniel Burnham, whose 1909 Plan of Chicago, also known as the Burnham Plan, focussed on reclaiming and improving Chicago&#x27;s lakefront for public enjoyment.

Another significant design point was that the city itself was nestled in between Mount Ainslie and Mount Bimberi and used their collective picturesque amenity as visual foci for the street layout and to convey civic power. Hence, the Griffins aligned democracy with the most powerful force of all: nature. Consequentially, given it was so severely overshadowed, the traditional methodology of using grand architecture to convey power was rendered less significant. This approach was strongly influenced by Pierre Charles L’Enfant&#x27;s 1792 design for Washington, D.C. L’Enfant&#x27;s design included wide, tree-lined avenues that would visually connect significant topographical sites over the city. He therefore drew on the picturesque by ensuring views of the landscape and notably the wilderness of the unchartered west, which beckoned &quot;[American] democracy&#x27;s westward expansion.&quot;

The Griffins&#x27; also capitalised on an emerging theme within the new colony which recognised the bush, referring to the country&#x27;s extensive native vegetation, as a national identity. Critical to the success of the Griffins&#x27; design was their use of gold and sepia which contrasted other entries that depicted a lush, green capital. The Griffins&#x27; approach better represented Australia&#x27;s unique conditions and, more importantly, celebrated them.

Finally, Washington, D.C. also offered another influence for the Griffins with respect to Burnham&#x27;s 1902 McMillan Plan for the city. Although the Griffins were predominantly influenced by pre-modern planning, notably L’Enfant&#x27;s inspired emphasis on the picturesque, they achieved this emphasis through well-orchestrated geometric street organisation representative of the contemporary City Beautiful movement. The movement was strongly implemented in the McMillan Plan, which in turn inspired Canberra&#x27;s grand axes, views, and effective central focal point.

===Development and growth===

Canberra&#x27;s growth over the first few decades was slow, and Canberra was indeed far more a small country town than a capital before World War II. It was noted for being more trees and fields than houses. Cattle grazing near Parliament House was a common occurrence, something which amazed General Macarthur when he visited Canberra during World War II.
The responsible government minister, King O&#x27;Malley, drove the first survey peg in the Canberra area on 20 February 1913 to mark the commencement of work on the new city. As we have seen, on 12 March that same year, the city was formally named by the Governor-General&#x27;s wife, Lady Denman, at a ceremony held on Capital Hill, the site of Australia&#x27;s current Parliament House.

The construction of the capital began in what is now North Canberra and South Canberra. The pace of building work was slower than expected because of the outbreak of World War I in 1914 and a dispute between Griffin and various Commonwealth bureaucrats. In 1917, a Royal Commission determined that these individuals had undermined Griffin&#x27;s authority by supplying false data to him, which he had used in carrying out his work. Ultimately, Griffin resigned from the Canberra design project in 1920, when he discovered that several of these same people had been appointed to the Federal Capital Advisory Committee formed to oversee Canberra&#x27;s construction.

Initially almost all construction work in the capital was undertaken by Commonwealth instrumentalities. Government-built housing, required to accommodate the public servants transferred from interstate, formed the basis for Canberra&#x27;s first suburbs. The suburbs that were slowly built over the next several years included Parkes, Barton, Kingston, Manuka, Braddon and Reid. These suburbs often had other names – for instance, Kingston was originally known as Eastlake – before a formal renaming procedure took place in 1928. They were erected largely in accordance to Walter Burley Griffin&#x27;s designs for Canberra. The men who constructed these suburbs lived in a series of workers&#x27; camps, which consisted of tents and some brick cottages. Building materials were obtained from quarries in the North Canberra area. A temporary railway was used to shift materials.

A rail line linking Canberra with the town of Queanbeyan across the border in NSW was constructed just prior to the outbreak of World War I. It opened for freight/industrial services on 25 May 1914 but was freed up for passenger trains 10 years later. A formal foundation stone for the city was laid by the Prince of Wales, the future Edward VIII, on 21 June 1920. Additions to Government House at Yarralumla, as well as building work on the Prime Minister&#x27;s Lodge and what is now &quot;Old Parliament House&quot;, were also carried out during this pivotal period.

In 1918, an internment camp for German World War I prisoners-of-war was established in Canberra&#x27;s eastern outskirts, in what is nowadays the suburb of Fyshwick. This camp instead housed mainly civilian internees transferred there from facilities in other locations such as the NSW town of Bourke. After 1919, the old internment became a workers&#x27; camp. In later years, the camp was closed and the roads that had serviced it were turned into urban streets.

Canberra&#x27;s first blocks of land for residential and commercial use were sold by auction on 12 December 1924. Buildings were subsequently erected on these allotments, but their residents endured a gruelling start to their occupancy when a flood struck Canberra in February 1925. The flood came about as the result of the Molonglo River bursting its banks. The surging water threatened or damaged many structures, and some drownings resulted.

Canberra&#x27;s first school, Telopea Park School, had already been opened in 1923. Public transport became available in July 1925, and two shopping areas were established at Manuka and Kingston in 1925.

The year 1927 saw the opening of a cinema at Manuka and an Australian Capital Territory police force was formed. Also in 1927, the fledgling city&#x27;s CBD was officially established. It was meant to be called Civic Centre, but then Prime Minister Stanley Bruce vetoed the idea and it became officially known as City Centre. However, City Centre is still commonly referred to by Canberrans as &quot;Civic&quot;.
But the most significant event of 1927 was clearly the opening of the provisional Parliament House (now known as the &quot;Old Parliament House&quot;) on 9 May 1927. On this date also, Melbourne ceased being the national capital and seat of government and Canberra assumed this role. Amongst the first legislation dealt with in the new parliament house was an act to repeal O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s unpopular prohibition laws. This took effect in 1928.

The Federal Capital Commission, had, meanwhile, been busy increasing the social amenity of the fledgeling city. In 1926 the Causeway Hall was erected, and was host to the first performance of the newly established Canberra Philharmonic Society (later Canberra Musical Society) on 15 May. A larger, more central venue, named the Albert Hall, was opened in 1928, the same year as the Canberra Croquet Club

Canberra&#x27;s workforce did not escape the adverse effects of the Great Depression when it hit Australia in 1929. In 1930, around 1800 labour-force workers and about one-seventh of the Commonwealth Public Service&#x27;s staff in Canberra were retrenched. Soon, Canberra&#x27;s growth ground to a complete halt, with even the governmental agency supervising its development being abolished for a while. Some major construction projects planned for the capital, including Anglican and Roman Catholic cathedrals, were not undertaken due to funds set aside for their planned construction being diverted for relief measures during the Depression. Having lost this early impetus, neither denomination has built a major centre of worship in the capital, although, in 1973, after major extensions, St Christopher&#x27;s Catholic Church, Manuka, was raised to the status of Cathedral (the Anglican cathedral remains in the nearby city of Goulburn).

Despite these setbacks, the Canberra community continued to develop in sophistication, if not in size, with the establishment of community facilities such as a radio station (2CA) in 1931 (initially run from a shop in the Kingston area), and the amateur dramatic Canberra Repertory Society in 1932. The planning and construction of the Australian War Memorial under the supervision of the war historian Charles Bean also began in Canberra at this time. The memorial was eventually completed at the height of World War II, in 1941, and its opening ceremony was conducted on 11 November of that year.

Embassies and High Commissions began to establish themselves in Canberra during the 1930s. The United Kingdom appointed their first High Commissioner to Australia in 1936. Canada appointed a representative in 1937 and the United States of America opened a mission in 1939 with their first envoy presenting his credentials in 1940. The United States was the first mission to build its own chancery in 1943. In 1946 Australia and the US raised the rank of representatives exchanged by the two countries to that of Ambassador; the American Embassy thus becoming the first embassy to be established in Canberra. Other countries, such as Sweden, followed soon afterwards. (Nowadays, Canberra contains a comprehensive array of embassies and other diplomatic missions.)

For all this, Canberra remained a small country town prior to World War II, far more rural than urban in its nature and size, with little to mark it as Australia&#x27;s capital other than Parliament House and the developing War Memorial. Its social centre remained the Kingston/Manuka area.

===After World War II===
Wartime conditions emphasised the need for an airport. On 1 April 1940, a military air base, RAAF Station Canberra, was established on a flat plain between Canberra and Queanbeyan. Later, this was renamed RAAF Fairbairn in memory of the Minister for Air, James V. Fairbairn, who was killed with a number of other ministers and officials when an aircraft crashed into a nearby hill in dense fog on 13 August 1940. Canberra Airport was constructed in the 1960s; the military base and commercial airport share the same runway.

Canberra began to grow more rapidly after World War II, as more and more government departments were transferred from Melbourne to the capital. The Australian National University was opened as a research institute in 1946. Undergraduate teaching continued at the Canberra University College, and the two were amalgamated in 1960. Entertainment and cultural organisations also began to flourish with the new influx of people. Until the opening of the Canberra Theatre Centre in 1965, the Albert Hall was home to a large number of prominent organisations, including the Canberra Orchestral Society (later the Canberra Symphony Orchestra) founded in 1950, a new Canberra Philharmonic Society (for musical theatre, 1951) and the Canberra Choral Society (1952).

Parts of Canberra formed the backdrop for Cold War espionage activity, highlighted during the 1954 Petrov Affair when a Soviet Union spy defected to Australia. Telopea Park in south Canberra was a known drop-off point for KGB spies based at the nearby USSR Embassy. This embassy was constantly monitored by ASIO agents based in the Kingston Hotel located across the street. There was also an ASIO listening post on the grounds of Canberra Grammar School. In 1991, with the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the embassy grounds became the Russian Embassy.

In March 1958, the National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) took over the planning and construction of Canberra. Under the control of the NCDC new districts, such as Woden and Tuggeranong, were established and slowly developed throughout the 1960s and 1970s to accommodate a growing population. The original design for Canberra did not extend beyond the central suburbs, and thus it was possible to design them to take better advantage of the land contours. Woden was established in 1964, Belconnen in 1967 and Tuggeranong in 1973. These additional districts helped to encourage large population growth between 1960 and 1975.

The construction of Lake Burley Griffin in central Canberra, along the course of the Molonglo, was commenced in the early 1960s, based largely on Walter Burley Griffin&#x27;s original plans. A move to name it Lake Menzies, after the then Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies, was vetoed by Menzies himself. The lake was formed by Scrivener Dam, named after Charles Scrivener, located at what is now the western end of Lake Burley Griffin. The dam was completed in 1963, and its valves closed on 20 September 1963, to allow the lake to form. However, the area was in drought at the time and the lake did not actually fill until April 1964, when the drought broke. This allowed the first event scheduled for the lake, a rowing championship, to take place. In 1970, the Captain James Cook Memorial was added, as part of the celebrations held that year to mark the bicentennial of the discovery of Australia&#x27;s east coast by Captain James Cook.

The 1971 Canberra flood disaster occurred in the Woden Valley of Canberra on Australia Day of that year. The flood killed seven people, injured 15 and affected 500 others.

Canberra&#x27;s residents are keen followers and participants in sports, and Bruce Stadium was opened during 1978 and later hosted several important Sydney 2000 soccer games.

Among key cultural and civic landmarks, the National Library of Australia building opened in 1968, the High Court of Australia building opened in 1980, the National Gallery of Australia building in 1982, the National Museum of Australia building in 2001 and the National Portrait Gallery of Australia building in 2008. All these facilities and institutions are situated on or near the shores of Lake Burley Griffin.

On 9 May 1988, a new, much larger Commonwealth Parliament House was opened on Capital Hill in State Circle, Parkes. This imposing complex of parliamentary chambers, public spaces, offices and other facilities replaced the outmoded (Provisional) Parliament House that had operated close by for some 60 years. The complex&#x27;s elaborate opening ceremony was a centrepiece of Australia&#x27;s bicentenary celebrations, which were held nationwide to mark the 200th anniversary of the arrival of the First Fleet from England, and the foundation of European settlement in what was to become the City of Sydney in 1788.

Significantly, the Australian Capital Territory was granted full self-government in December 1988, when an act passed by Federal Parliament that made the territory a body politic under the Crown was signed by Queen Elizabeth II. On 11 May 1989, following the elections earlier that year, a 17-member Legislative Assembly began sitting at its offices in London Circuit, Civic. The inaugural ACT government was led by Chief Minister Rosemary Follett.

In 1992, Canberra was the host city for the 7th Assembly of the World Council of Churches.

==21st century==

On 18 January 2003, bushfires that had been burning in the remote wilderness west of Canberra broke containment lines and engulfed some of Canberra. About 500 homes were destroyed before a change in the weather brought the bushfire under control. The suburb of Duffy was hit especially hard, with some 200 homes destroyed. Four people died in the conflagration and many more were injured.

The development of Canberra is ongoing. Major new works under construction in recent years include the Gungahlin Town Centre, City West Precinct and the Kingston Foreshores Development. On 5 March 2004, the Canberra Spatial Plan for the city&#x27;s future development was released. As of 2005 plans were under development for a new Canberra district to be situated west of Lake Burley Griffin, on land formerly occupied by a pine plantation.

==Sites of significance==
There are many sites of significance for Aboriginal people in and around Canberra especially in the Pialigo area.
*Acton Peninsula is now home to the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. 
*Mount Ainslie and Black Mountain are the breasts of the spirit woman who lies in the Canberra landscape. On the latter was Black&#x27;s Camp, a women&#x27;s business camp where women went to give birth. 
*The site of Parliament House is the womb of the spirit woman who lies in the Canberra landscape.
*The Molonglo River, previously called the Limestone and Fish Rivere, is a provider of food for the indigenous people, including fish, turtles and crayfish.
*The area at the Australian National University campus around Sullivans Creek, known as Ngambri Creek to the Ngambri people, was a campsite.
*Aboriginal people camped at Red Hill year-round, including during the construction of Old Parliament House in the 1920s.
*An ochre site in Queanbeyan (now developed over) was where Aboriginal people sourced brilliant white ochre for trade and for their own use to decorate their bodies for song and dance and ceremony.
*Queanbeyan Showground was a campsite, gathering place and burial site for Aboriginal people. In 1841 and onwards, Aboriginal people gathered at Queanbeyan Showground at the start of winter for government blanket distribution.
*The Tuggeranong sandstone axe-grinding grooves. Ngambri women in the past prepared bread using native seeds at the site while men sharpened axes.
*The Wanniassa canoe tree, a gumtree used in the late 1800s or early 1900s to make a canoe that was paddled on the Molonglo River for a span of several summers.

<text>In thermodynamics, a quasi-static process, also known as a quasi-equilibrium process (from Latin &quot;quasi&quot;, meaning ‘as if’), is a thermodynamic process that happens slowly enough for the system to remain in internal physical (but not necessarily chemical) thermodynamic equilibrium. An example of this is quasi-static expansion of a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gas, where the volume of the system changes so slowly that the pressure remains uniform throughout the system at each instant of time during the process. Such an idealized process is a succession of physical equilibrium states, characterized by infinite slowness.

Only in a quasi-static thermodynamic process can we exactly define intensive quantities (such as pressure, temperature, specific volume, specific entropy) of the system at any instant during the whole process; otherwise, since no internal equilibrium is established, different parts of the system would have different values of these quantities, so a single value per quantity may not be sufficient to represent the whole system. In other words, when an equation for a change in a state function contains &quot;P&quot; or &quot;T&quot;, it implies a quasi-static process.

==Relation to reversible process==

While all reversible processes are quasi-static, most authors do not require a general quasi-static process to maintain equilibrium between system and surroundings and avoid dissipation, which are defining characteristics of a reversible process. For example, quasi-static compression of a system by a piston subject to friction is irreversible; although the system is always in internal thermal equilibrium, the friction ensures the generation of dissipative entropy, which goes against the definition of reversibility. Any engineer would remember to include friction when calculating the dissipative entropy generation. 

An example of a quasi-static process that is not idealizable as reversible is slow heat transfer between two bodies on two finitely different temperatures, where the heat transfer rate is controlled by a poorly conductive partition between the two bodies. In this case, no matter how slowly the process takes place, the state of the composite system consisting of the two bodies is far from equilibrium, since thermal equilibrium for this composite system requires that the two bodies be at the same temperature. Nevertheless, the entropy change for each body can be calculated using the Clausius equality for reversible heat transfer.

==PV-work in various quasi-static processes==
# Constant pressure: Isobaric processes, formula_1
# Constant volume: Isochoric processes, formula_2
# Constant temperature: Isothermal processes, formula_3 where (pressure) varies with (volume) via formula_4, so formula_5
# Polytropic processes, formula_6

<text>Hermann Mayer Salomon Goldschmidt (June 17, 1802 – August 30 or September 10 1866) was a German-French astronomer and painter who spent much of his life in France. He started out as a painter, but after attending a lecture by the famous French astronomer Urbain Le Verrier turned to astronomy. His discovery of the asteroid Lutetia in 1852 was followed by further findings and by 1861 Goldschmidt had discovered 14 asteroids. He received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1861 for having discovered more asteroids than any other person up to that time. He died from complications of diabetes.

== Life and work ==

Goldschmidt was born in Frankfurt as the son of a Jewish merchant. During a journey to the Netherlands, Goldschmidt visited Dutch picture galleries. The impression of this visit convinced him to become a painter. He studied art in Munich for several years under supervision of such famous painters as Peter von Cornelius and Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld. To complete his education, in 1836 Goldschmidt went to Paris.

In 1820, Goldschmidt discovered shadow bands in total solar eclipses.

Several lectures on astronomy were planned for the occasion of the lunar eclipse of March 31, 1847. Urbain Le Verrier, discoverer of Neptune, held one in the Sorbonne. By pure chance, Goldshmidt attended this lecture, which awakened his interest in astronomy and led him to pursue it as a career.
Goldschmidt bought a telescope with the diameter of 23 lines () with the money he got from selling two portraits of Galileo he painted during a stay in Florence. Goldschmidt set up the telescope in his apartment on the sixth floor above the Café Procope. Very soon he started updating the Star charts he had with new stars. During this work he observed the same area several times and was able to detect variable stars and moving objects like planets. He discovered his first new planet (today classified as asteroid) on November 15, 1852. Goldschmidt confirmed his observations with the help of François Arago at the Paris Observatory on November 18. Arago suggested the name Lutetium, based on the Latin name of Paris &quot;Lutetia&quot; used during the Roman occupation. The discovery of the new planet was published on November 23.
In subsequent years, Goldschmidt bought larger telescopes, one with 30 lines diameter. Despite the limited observational capabilities of his instrument, which was inferior to those of most of his competitors, by May 1856 Goldschmidt had discovered four more asteroids. His next telescope was one with the diameter of . This technical improvement enabled him to discover nine asteroids between May 1857 and May 1861. During that period, the Academy of Science awarded Goldschmidt the astronomical prize medal several times, and he was made a chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1857. By the time of his final discovery in May 1861, the Royal Astronomical Society had awarded him the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society for the discovery of 13 asteroids. At that point, the second most successful astronomers John Russell Hind and Robert Luther had each discovered 10.

Goldschmidt combined his abilities as a painter with his love for astronomy as exemplified by his paintings of the Great Comet of 1858 and of the solar eclipse he observed in Spain July 1860. In April 1861, he announced the discovery of a ninth moon of Saturn between Titan and Hyperion, which he named &quot;Chiron&quot;. However, he was mistaken: this moon did not exist; today, &quot;Chiron&quot; is the name of an entirely different object, the unusual asteroid/comet 2060 Chiron. His updated star charts and the discovery of several variable stars were also appreciated by his colleagues.

Goldschmidt was never employed at the Paris Observatory and therefore his income was insecure. However, in 1862 he was awarded a pension of 1500 francs. Because of his diabetes, Goldschmidt moved to Fontainebleau, but his condition did not improve. He stayed in Fontainebleau for three years and died there on April 26, 1866.

== Namesakes ==

The lunar crater &quot;Goldschmidt&quot; is named after him. The crater is located in the northern polar region.

The outer main-belt asteroid 1614 Goldschmidt, discovered by French astronomer Alfred Schmitt in 1952, was named in his memory.

==Prizes and awards==
Goldschmidt was awarded the Lalande Prize seven times (1852, 1854, 1855, 1857, 1858, 1860, 1861).

He was awarded chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1857.

In 1861, received Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society for the discovery of 13 asteroids (at that time).

In 1869, a commemorative medal honoring the discovery of the 100th asteroid shows the profiles of John Russel Hind, Hermann Goldschmidt and Robert Luther.

<text>John Bertrand &quot;Jocko&quot; Conlan (December 6, 1899 – April 16, 1989) was an American baseball umpire who worked in the National League (NL) from 1941 to 1965. He had a brief career as an outfielder with the Chicago White Sox before entering umpiring. He umpired in five World Series and six All-Star Games. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974 by the Veterans Committee.

==Early life==
Conlan was born in Chicago. He was one of nine children. Conlan&#x27;s father, a Chicago police officer, died when Conlan was three years old. He attended De La Salle Institute in Chicago.

==Playing career==
Beginning his professional baseball career in 1920, Conlan spent 13 years as a minor league player. Statistics are incomplete, but Conlan was known to have played with Western League teams in Wichita until 1923. He was in the International League for the next several seasons, playing for the Rochester Tribe from 1924 to 1926 and for the Newark Bears from 1927 to 1929. He spent a season with the Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association and then returned to the International League with the Montreal Royals in 1931 and 1932.

Conlan began his major league career in as a center fielder for the Chicago White Sox. In , however, Conlan was presented with an unusual opportunity. During a game against the St. Louis Browns, umpire Red Ormsby fell ill due to the heat. In those days, only two umpires covered typical regular-season games, and a player with a reputation for honesty might be pressed into service if one umpire became incapacitated. Conlan was asked to fill in, and took to it well. The following year Conlan made the transition from player to umpire complete, beginning in the minor leagues.

==Umpiring career==
Conlan umpired in the National League from 1941 to 1965, officiating in five World Series (1945, 1950, 1954, 1957 and 1961) and six All-Star Games (1943, 1947, 1950, 1953, 1958 and the first 1962 contest). He also umpired in the playoff series to decide the NL&#x27;s regular-season champions in 1951, 1959 and 1962 (some sources erroneously credit him with umpiring in the 1946 NL playoff as well). He was the home plate umpire when Gil Hodges hit four home runs on August 31, ; he also umpired in the April 30, game in which Willie Mays hit four home runs. He retired after the 1964 season, but returned to work as a substitute umpire for 17 games in 1965.

Conlan was known for several trademarks: Instead of a regular dress tie like most umpires of the day wore, Conlan wore a natty bow tie for his career. Conlan further distinguished himself by making &quot;out&quot; calls with his left hand instead of his right. He was also the last NL umpire allowed to wear the outside chest protector, instead of the inside protector that all other NL umpires except Beans Reardon were using by then.

Manager Casey Stengel said that he admired Conlan&#x27;s performance both as a player and as an umpire. He managed Conlan with the Toledo Mud Hens and described a time when Conlan broke his leg sliding into third base. He scored a run before telling anyone that he had been hurt. Though he was hitting .292 when he got hurt, Stengel gave him half of a $1,000 bonus he was supposed to get for batting .300. Stengel later said, &quot;And as a reward for the $500 bonus I once gave him, he used to chase me oftener than anyone than any other manager in the league. But I admired him for his courage as a player and an official.&quot;

==Argument with Leo Durocher==
Jocko Conlan and manager Leo Durocher were both known as colorful characters, and sometimes they would clash. Durocher liked to tell of one unique incident in a game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum (April 16, 1961) when he was arguing with Conlan after he had already been ejected from the game. He attempted to kick dirt on Conlan&#x27;s shoes, but slipped and actually kicked Conlan in the shins. Striking an umpire is a serious offense, but Conlan &quot;kicked him right back&quot;, a sequence that an alert photographer also captured and which was circulated for some time. As Conlan was wearing shin guards, he was not injured by Durocher&#x27;s kicks.

==Popular culture==
Conlan&#x27;s name was mentioned several times in a fictitious baseball game celebrated in the 1962 song &quot;The Los Angeles Dodgers&quot;, recorded by Danny Kaye. The song referred to Conlan only by his last name, with the presumption that the listener would know he was referring to the famous umpire. That song is contained on the CD &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;.

The book &quot;Carl Erskine&#x27;s Tales from the Dodgers Dugout: Extra Innings&quot; (2004) includes short stories from former Dodger pitcher Carl Erskine. Conlan is prominent in many of these stories.

==Later life==
Conlan retired to Arizona, where he enjoyed playing golf.

Upon Conlan&#x27;s retirement, NL president Warren Giles said, &quot;I know of no one who has been more dedicated to his profession, more loyal to the game in which he has been such a big party, and I hate to see him hang up his spikes.&quot;

Conlan was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Committee on Baseball Veterans in . He was the fourth umpire chosen, and the first NL umpire since Bill Klem in 1953.

He was never issued an umpire number, having officiated before this occurred.

Conlan underwent heart surgery after becoming ill while watching the first game of the 1974 World Series. He died in 1989 at a hospital in Scottsdale, Arizona.

His son John Bertrand Conlan served as a U.S. representative from Arizona from 1973 to 1977.

<doc id="582735" wikidata="Q1022574" url="?curid=582735" title="C. W. McCall">
<text>William Dale Fries Jr. (November 15, 1928 – April 1, 2022) was an American commercial artist who won several Clio Awards for his advertising campaigns. He was also a musician remembered for his character C. W. McCall, a truck-driving country singer that he created for a series of bread commercials while working for an Omaha advertising agency as an art director. Fries performed as McCall in a series of outlaw albums and songs in the 1970s, in collaboration with co-worker Chip Davis who also founded Mannheim Steamroller.

McCall&#x27;s most successful song was &quot;Convoy&quot;, a surprise hit in 1975, reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and number two in the UK Singles Chart in March 1976. After a successful spell of touring, Fries retired to Ouray, Colorado where he was elected mayor, serving from 1986 to 1992. The &quot;Convoy&quot; song became an anthem for the Freedom Convoy protests in 2022 and Fries enjoyed this revival before he died of cancer at the age of 93.

==Early life==
McCall was born Billie Dale Fries on November 15, 1928, in Audubon, Iowa, the son of William Dale &quot;Billie&quot; Fries Sr. and Margaret Fries. He later legally changed his name to William Dale Fries, Jr. One of his sons is now Bill Fries III.

His family was musical; Bill Sr., a farm equipment factory foreman by day, performed with his two brothers in &quot; The Fries Brothers Band&quot; and played the violin while Margaret played the piano and the two played ragtime together at dances. Bill Sr. frequently hauled prefabricated swine barns to customers, which introduced Bill Jr. to the world of trucking. Bill Jr. first performed at the age of three in a local talent contest, singing &quot;Coming &#x27; Round the Mountain&quot; while his mother played the piano. He studied music at school, playing the clarinet and the music of John Philip Sousa and became the drum major for the school&#x27;s marching band. As a child, he enjoyed listening to country music, but he was even more interested in art, having started copying the cartoon characters of Walt Disney as a child. He went to the Fine Arts School at the University of Iowa where he majored in commercial art and also performed in the university&#x27;s symphony orchestra, but he had to leave the university after one year as he could not afford to compete, for jobs to pay tuition, with the many demobbed soldiers who were going through college on the GI Bill of Rights. He then returned to Audubon to work as a signwriter.

In 1950, he got a job as a commercial artist with KMTV in Omaha, Nebraska. He worked for them for ten years, doing graphic work, lettering and set design. He also supported the local ballet and opera societies, doing work which won an award from the Omaha Artists and Art Directors Club. This attracted the attention of Bozell &amp; Jacobs which was a local advertising agency and they gave him a job as an art director, doubling his salary.

==Advertising==
In 1973, while working for Bozell &amp; Jacobs, Fries created a television advertising campaign for Old Home Bread. The bread was trucked across the Midwest from the Metz Baking Company plant in Sioux City, Iowa. As the big semi-trailer trucks carrying the Old Home Bread logo were a familiar sight on the highway, this suggested a trucking theme. 

The advertisements were narrated by a trucker named &quot;C.W. McCall,&quot; played by Jim Finlayson. The name was inspired by &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; magazine, which Fries had on his desk at the time. A James Garner movie, &quot;Cash McCall&quot;, was also an influence. To complete the name, Fries added initials, shown embroidered on the trucker&#x27;s shirt, and chose &quot;C. W.&quot; for country and western.

In each commercial, the trucker&#x27;s mission was to deliver a load of Old Home Bread to the Old Home Café, whose name expanded over time to become the &quot;Old Home Fill &#x27;Er Up An&#x27; Keep On a-Truckin&#x27; Café&quot;. There, a waitress named Mavis (played by Jean McBride Capps as a Marilyn Monroe bombshell) awaited the bread delivery. McCall would later joke that Capps &quot;was built like a couple of cub scouts trying to put up a Sears Roebuck pup tent.&quot; 
The character Mavis was named after a real waitress at the White Spot café in Audubon where Fries grew up. At the end of the ad campaign of twelve different spots, the C.W. McCall character proposes marriage to Mavis, who accepts.

Each commercial featured a distinctive country spoken-word patter song full of folksy trucker jargon. Fries wrote the lyrics and recorded the vocals; Chip Davis, who wrote jingles at Bozell &amp; Jacobs, composed the musical accompaniment. These pieces strongly foreshadowed, both in style and structure, the musical releases Fries would soon create as his C.W. McCall musician character.

The commercial won a Clio Award.

==Musical Career==
The success of the ad campaign led Fries to embark on a commercial recording career, cloaked in the identity of the McCall character from the Old Home Bread commercials. Fries first charted the song &quot;Wolf Creek Pass&quot;, which reached No. 40 on the U.S. pop top 40 in 1975. Two other songs reached the Billboard Hot 100, &quot;Old Home Filler-Up an&#x27; Keep on a-Truckin&#x27; Cafe&quot;, as well as the environmentally-oriented &quot;There Won&#x27;t Be No Country Music (There Won&#x27;t Be No Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll)&quot;.

Fries is best known for the 1976 No. 1 hit song, &quot;Convoy&quot; which was inspired by his own experience of driving in a growing group of vehicles out of Denver. In its style and composition, the song is a direct echo of Fries&#x27;s Old Home Bread commercial songs: a first-person trucker spoken monologue, backed by a country arrangement and interspersed with a gentle choral call-and-response. But the theme is rebellious instead of sentimental: truckers coordinating by CB radio to rebel against the new federal speed limit of 55 mph. The mix of anti-authority feeling and country authenticity was immensely popular, and helped feed a nationwide craze for CB radios and trucker culture. The single sold over two million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA in December 1975. Classically-trained Chip Davis, who wrote the music to the song, won Country Music Writer of the Year in 1976 for his work with McCall, despite not liking the genre; the success allowed him to launch his instrumental project Mannheim Steamroller, which became particularly well-known for its Christmas records.

A dozen C.W. McCall songs appeared on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Country Singles chart, including the sentimental &quot;Roses for Mama&quot; (1977). &quot;Classified&quot; and &quot;&#x27;Round the World with the Rubber Duck&quot; (a pirate-flavored sequel to &quot;Convoy&quot;) bubbled under the Hot 100.

In 1978, the movie &quot;Convoy&quot; was released, based on the C. W. McCall song. The film starred Kris Kristofferson, Ali MacGraw, Burt Young, and Ernest Borgnine and was directed by Sam Peckinpah. It featured a new version of the song, with lyrics written specifically for the plot of the film.

But by the time of the movie&#x27;s release, the trucking fad was waning. In 1979, Fries retired from the music business, although he recorded a few songs in later years. He voiced more commercials, including ads for Kern&#x27;s bread featuring the actors he had made popular with Old Home.

In addition to the &quot;original six&quot; McCall albums released between 1975 and 1979, two rare singles exist. &quot;Kidnap America&quot; was a politically/socially-conscious track released in 1980 during the Iran hostage crisis, while &quot;Pine Tar Wars&quot; referred to an event that actually happened in a New York Yankees–Kansas City Royals baseball game during 1983 (a dispute concerning the application of a large quantity of pine tar to a baseball bat used by George Brett, one of the Royals&#x27; players).

The song &quot;Convoy&quot; is featured in &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;. In 2014, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Convoy&quot; No. 98 on their list of 100 Greatest Country Songs.

==Politics and later life in Ouray==

Fries and his family vacationed in Ouray, Colorado, during the 1960s. They then bought a summer home there after the financial success of &quot;Convoy.&quot; When Fries stopped touring, he retired to Ouray with his family. In 1986, Fries was elected mayor of the town and served three terms of two years each. His main achievement as mayor was to restore the historic city hall, which had burned down in 1950. Another major project was the &quot;San Juan Odyssey&quot;. This was an audiovisual exhibition which had originally been a slide show at Wright&#x27;s Opera House. C. W. McCall had provided the narration for this in 1979 and it was shown to hundreds of thousands of visitors until the show closed in 1996. He then revised and digitized the production so that it could be shown in modern formats such as DVD.

On February 9, 2022, while conducting what would be his final interview with &quot;The Drew and Mike Podcast&quot;, he gave his blessing for the use of his signature song &quot;Convoy&quot; for the Freedom Convoy protests in Canada, with Taste of Country noting that he was &quot;energized and enthusiastic&quot; about the revival of interest in the song and its message.

Fries died on April 1, 2022, at age 93, from complications of cancer.

At the time of his death he was married to his wife Rena Bonnema Fries, whom he had wed on February 15, 1952; the two remained married for 70 years. 
When he died, Fries had three children, four grandchildren, six great-grandchildren and one great-great-grandchild. His hobbies included model railroading and working on his old military jeep.

<doc id="582754" wikidata="Q1193094" url="?curid=582754" title="Smith Ely Jr.">
<text>Smith Ely Jr. (April 17, 1825 – July 1, 1911) was an American politician, the 82nd Mayor of New York City, and a member of the United States House of Representatives from New York in the 19th Century.

==Early life==
He was born in Hanover Township, New Jersey, on April 17, 1825. His father, Smith Ely Sr., was a leather merchant who had been a soldier in the War of 1812 and his paternal grandfather was Moses Ely, who fought under George Washington in the American Revolutionary War. His maternal grandfather was Ambrose Kitchell. His siblings lived together in their adulthood, including elder brother, Ambrose Kitchell Ely (1823–1907), William Henry Ely (1829–1913) and his wife, Maria Josephine Rogers (d. 1924), Edwin Augustus Ely (1836–1927), and Maria Louise Ely (1844–1922), who married George Burritt Vanderpoel (d. 1925).

He completed preparatory studies and was graduated from the University of the City of New York (now New York University) and, in 1845, from New York University School of Law.

==Career==
He studied in the law office of Frederic de Peyster, and was admitted to the bar in 1845, but never practiced law. Instead, he engaged in mercantile pursuits in New York with Ely, Vanderpoel &amp; Kitchell which was founded in 1868. Like his father, he was a leather merchant in the Swamp district until the Leather Trust bought him out and he retired to his farm in New Jersey.

===Early political career ===
He was active in various public offices including, School Commissioner for the 17th Ward from 1856 until 1860; a New York State Senator from 1858 and 1859; the New York County Supervisor from 1860 to 1870; and the Commissioner of Public Instruction in 1867.

=== Congress ===
From March 4, 1871, until March 3, 1873, he served as a Democratic Representative to the Forty-second Congress. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1872, however he was again elected as a Representative to the Forty-fourth Congress serving from March 4, 1875, until the date of his resignation on December 11, 1876. While in Congress, he served as chairman of Committee on Expenditures in the Department of the Treasury. While in office, he gave a speech on July 29, 1876, regarding the method of manufacturing the circulating notes and securities of the Government.

=== New York City Mayor ===
Following his resignation from Congress, Ely served as the Mayor of New York City from 1877 to 1878, beating former New York Governor Gen. John Adams Dix by 55,000 votes. In 1895, he was appointed commissioner of parks and served until 1897, when he retired from public life.

==Death and burial ==
Ely, who never married, died at the age of 86 on July 1, 1911, in Livingston, Essex County, New Jersey. He was interred in a private cemetery on his farm.

== Legacy ==
His estate, valued in excess of $1,000,000, was almost entirely left to charity, including $50,000 to a fund for juveniles to &quot;help offending youths get a better start in the world,&quot; $100,000 to the American Sunday School, $100,000 to United Charities, as well as funds to Orange and Morristown Memorial Hospitals. His bequests were in addition to the millions he gave away to charities during his lifetime. His siblings also gave generously to charity upon their deaths.

Ely Avenue in the Bronx is named in honor of Ely.

===Early cameras===

Relying heavily on imported German technology, Nichi-Doku turned out their first product, a bellows camera called the Nifcarette, in March 1929. By 1937, the company reorganized as Chiyoda Kogaku Seikō, K.K. (Chiyoda Optics and Fine Engineering, Ltd.) and built the first Japanese-made twin-lens reflex camera, the Minoltaflex, based on the German Rolleiflex.

In 1947, the Minolta-35 was introduced. It is based on the Leica rangefinder camera concept with the 39mm screw lens-mount. It uses the standard 35mm film in cassettes. The standard lens is the Super Rokkor 1:2.8 50mm.

In 1950, Minolta developed a planetarium projector, the first-ever made in Japan, beginning the company&#x27;s connection to astronomical optics. John Glenn took a Minolta Hi-Matic rangefinder 35 mm camera aboard the spacecraft &quot;Friendship 7&quot; in 1962, and in 1968, Apollo 8 orbited the Moon with a Minolta Space Meter aboard.

In the late 1950s and 1960s, Minolta competed in the medium-format roll film camera market with the Autocord series of TLR (twin-lens reflex) cameras. 


==Single-lens reflex cameras==
In 1958, Minolta introduced its SR-2 single lens reflex (SLR) 35mm camera which was equipped with a bayonet mount and instant return mirror. In 1966 Minolta introduced the SR-T line which included TTL metering. Although well-made and widely regarded as some of the most innovative SLR cameras of their time, Minolta cameras were not as robust as competing Nikon models. Minolta SR/SRT design used sleeve bushings instead of bearings on its focal plane spindles and had greater tolerances between working parts. This occasionally caused problems in very cold weather or with extremely high levels of use. Minolta SLRs also lacked important professional features such as a motor drive, removable pentaprism, and removable back. Minolta cameras appealed to amateur photographers with their lower prices and high-quality optics.

From the late 1950s through the 1980s, Minolta was the first Japanese manufacturer to introduce a bayonet lens mount rather than a screw mount; and the first manufacturer to introduce multimode metering. They also introduced the first commercially successful autofocus SLR line with the Maxxum series.

In 1972, Minolta drew up a formal cooperation agreement with Leitz. Leitz needed expertise in camera body electronics, and Minolta felt that they could learn from Leitz&#x27;s optical expertise. Tangible results of this cooperation were the Leica CL/Minolta CL, an affordable rangefinder camera to supplement the Leica M range. The Leica CL was built by Minolta to Leica specifications. Other results were the Leica R3, which was in fact the Minolta XE-1 with a Leica lens mount, viewfinder, and spot metering system, and the Leica R4 was based on the Minolta XD-11. Additionally, five Minolta lenses were repackaged as Leica R lenses: the Minolta 24/2.8 MC Rokkor-X optics are found in the Leica 24/2.8 Elmarit-R, and similarly for the Minolta 35-70/3.5, 75-200/4.5, 70-210/4, and 16/2.8. 

===First &quot;program&quot; focal plane shutter 35mm SLR: the XD-11===
In 1977, Minolta introduced the XD-11, the first multimode 35 mm compact SLR to include both aperture and shutter priority in a single body. It was also the first camera to employ a computerised chip, which in shutter priority mode overrode the chosen speed if necessary to give a correct exposure, thus offering the first-ever &#x27;programmed mode&#x27;. The XD-11 was the last attempt by Minolta to enter the professional and semiprofessional 35 mm SLR market until the Maxxum 9 in 1998. Elements of the XD-11 design (called the XD-7 in Europe) were utilized by Leitz for the Leica R4 camera.

===The final manual-focus 35mm SLR cameras: the X-700 series=== 

Minolta continued to offer 35 mm manual focus SLR cameras in its X-370, X-570, and X-700 from 1981, but slowly repositioned its cameras to appeal to a broader market. Minolta decided to abandon the high level of design and parts specifications of its earlier XD/XE line. The new amateur-level X-570, X-700, and related models offered additional program and metering features designed to appeal to newer photographers, at a lower cost. The advanced vertical metal shutter design of the older cameras was rejected in favor of a cheaper horizontal cloth-curtain shutter, reducing flash sync to a slow 1/60th second. Further cost savings were made internally, where some operating components were changed from metal to plastic.

The first version of the X-370, the chrome version that was made in Japan, was a rugged, all-metal camera that sometimes had greater appeal than the “plasticky” X-570, X-700, or later black versions of the X-370 (known as the X-7A) to photographers who place a premium on build quality.

As Minolta&#x27;s autofocus Maxxums were proving successful, Minolta invested fewer resources in its manual focus line as time progressed.

===Compact 35mm film cameras===

Minolta entered the highly competitive 35mm compact camera market in the 1980s and transitioned from older rangefinder designs to &quot;point-and-shoot&quot; (P&amp;S) electronic autofocus/autowind cameras. Minolta, like other major manufacturers faced with low-cost competition from elsewhere in Asia, found it difficult to build quality P&amp;S cameras at a cost the consumer was willing to pay, and was forced to offshore production, gradually redesigning successive cameras to reduce cost and maintain profit margins.

===Autofocus SLRs===

Minolta purchased the patent rights to autofocus lens technology from Leica Camera in the 1970s. In 1985, Minolta introduced a new line of autofocus (AF) SLR cameras. In North America, they used the name Maxxum; in Europe, the cameras were called Dynax; and in Japan, they were named Alpha. They were Minolta&#x27;s first line of automatic focus SLR cameras, and the first commercially successful autofocus SLRs the world had seen.

Minolta&#x27;s marketing agency of record, The Manhattan-based William Esty Company branded the Minolta Maxxum, which was named by Creative Director George Morin. The round Minolta logo was developed by Art Director Herbert Clark with designer Saul Bass. The Minolta Freedom line of autofocus compacts were also branded at The William Esty Company, and named by Senior Copywriter Niels Peter Olsen. The Minolta Freedom line also included the Minolta Talker, the first point &amp; shoot camera to incorporate a voice-chip that assisted with autofocus and flash operations. As a result of their innovations, the products that Minolta launched with The William Esty Company increased their camera sales from third, behind Canon &amp; Nikon, to first in the U.S. marketplace.

With the Maxxum line, the heavy duty metal bodies of earlier Minoltas were abandoned in favor of lighter and less expensive plastics. The Maxxum 7000, the most popular of the new Maxxums, introduced the innovation of arrow buttons for setting aperture and shutter speed, rather than a shutter speed dial on the body and an aperture ring on the lens. That way, the only control necessary on the lens is the manual focus ring (plus the zoom ring in the case of zoom lenses).

The Maxxum 7000 had two 8-bit CPUs and six integrated circuits. A circuit on the lens relayed aperture information to the camera body, and the motor for autofocus was contained within the camera body. An LCD showed aperture, shutter speed, and frame count, while an infrared beam counted sprocket holes when advancing the film from frame to frame (this prevents the use of infrared film). The 7000 had TTL phase-detection focusing and metering, autoexposure, and predictive autofocus. All Maxxum cameras use the Minolta A-mount; earlier manual-focus Minolta SR-mount lenses are incompatible with the new AF cameras.

Unfortunately for Minolta, its autofocus design was found to infringe on the patents of Honeywell, a U.S. corporation. After protracted litigation, in 1991 Minolta was ordered to pay Honeywell damages, penalties, trial costs, and other expenses in a final amount of $127.6 million.

After the 4-digit Maxxum i line, which included the 3000i, 5000i, 7000i, and 8000i, came the 1-digit Maxxum xi line; followed by the 3-digit si line; the 1-digit line without letters (Alpha/Dynax/Maxxum 3, 4, 5, 7, 9); and finally, the Maxxum 50 (Dynax 40) and Maxxum 70 (Dynax 60).

===APS format cameras===
Minolta also invested in APS (Advanced Photo System) film-format cameras, most notably with the Vectis line of SLR cameras beginning in 1996. APS later proved to be a technological dead end, as the cameras did not sell as hoped. Digital photography was entering the marketplace, and Minolta eventually discontinued all APS camera production.

===Other developments===

Minolta introduced features that became standard in all brands a few years later. Standardized features that were first introduced on Minolta models included multisensor light metering coupled to multiple AF sensors, automatic flash balance system, wireless TTL flash control, TTL-controlled full-time flash sync, and speedy front and rear wheels for shutter and aperture control. Special features introduced by Minolta are interactive LCD viewfinder display, setup memory, expansion program cards (discontinued), eye-activated startup, and infrared frame counter.

===Merger with Konica===

In an effort to strengthen market share and acquire additional assets in film, film cameras, and optical equipment, Minolta merged with another long-time Japanese camera manufacturer, Konica Ltd., in 2003. The new corporation was called Konica Minolta Ltd.

Until Konica Minolta announced their withdrawal plan in 2006, they made Maxxum/Dynax digital and film-based cameras (retaining the different names in the different markets), improving the design while maintaining the basic concepts. The Maxxum 4 is a low-priced 35 mm SLR with an A-type bayonet mount, built-in flash, autoexposure, predictive autofocus, electronically controlled vertical-traverse focal plane shutter, and through-the-lens (TTL) phase-detection focusing and metering. In advertising literature, Minolta claimed that the Maxxum 4 was the most compact 35 mm AF SLR, and the second fastest at autofocusing, while the Maxxum 5 was the fastest at autofocusing. These cameras were, however, intended for the consumer end of the market.

Minolta made one last attempt to enter the amateur and professional market with the Maxxum (Dynax) 9 in 1998, followed by the Maxxum 7 in 2000, which used a full LCD readout on the rear of the camera. Though well received by the photographic press, the 7 and 9 did not sell to expectations or achieve any significant breakthrough with their intended customer base, who had largely gravitated to the Canon or Nikon brands. All of these cameras were eventually discontinued in favor of the less-expensive Maxxum 50 and 70, which were sold under the Minolta name until 2006, when Konica Minolta ceased production of all film cameras.

===Digital cameras===
Minolta had a line of digital point-and-shoot cameras to compete in the digital photography market. Their DiMAGE line included digital cameras and imaging software as well as film scanners.

Minolta created a new category of &quot;bridge cameras,&quot; with the introduction of the DiMAGE 7. Designed for use by people familiar with 35mm single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras but without the added cost or complication of interchangeable lenses or optical reflex viewfinders, the DiMAGE incorporated many of the features of a higher-level film camera with the simplicity of smaller compact digicams. The camera had a traditional zoom ring and focus ring on the lens barrel and was equipped with an electronic viewfinder (EVF) rather than the direct optical reflex view of an SLR. It added other features such as a histogram, and the cameras were compatible with Minolta&#x27;s flashes for modern film SLRs.

However, the DiMAGE 7 (including the DiMAGE A1, A2, and A200) and similar bridge cameras were not really adequate substitutes for professional SLR cameras, and initially there were many reports of slow autofocus speed and various malfunctions (this surfaced when a Sony-designed CCD chip would malfunction, rendering the camera useless. Minolta, however, issued a CCD alert and fixed faulty units free of charge; after Konica Minolta&#x27;s withdrawal from the photo business, Sony took over the CCD alert until the warranty repair service was terminated in 2010). Minolta later innovated in this line by being the first manufacturer to integrate a mechanical antishake system (Minolta&#x27;s antishake is based inside the camera body as opposed to the camera lens, common with Canon EF and Nikon AF lenses).

In January 2002, Minolta again created a new category of camera, introducing the Minolta DiMAGE X, an ultracompact digital with a 3x folded zoom lens. With the folded approach, no moving parts of the lens are external to the camera. Instead, a 45-degree mirror bounces light to a conventional zoom lens safely tucked inside the camera body. Fast startup times are one potential benefit of this design (since nothing needs to extend), but slow focus and shutter lag times marred the advantage of this innovation.

According to a press release by Konica Minolta they &quot;Konica Minolta Photo Imaging Inc. ceased its Camera Business Operations as of 31 March 2006, and ceased the entire customer services for Konica Minolta cameras and related products as of 31 December 2010&quot;

As of January 1, 2017, Minolta digital cameras are exclusively manufactured under license by Elite Brands Inc in the United States.

===Digital SLRs===
Although Minolta had launched their first digital SLR system as early as 1995, the RD-175 — a 3 sensor (3 x 0.38 megapixel) camera based on the Maxxum 500si — was never successful, and in 1998, it was superseded by the Minolta Dimâge RD 3000, a 3-megapixel DSLR based on the Minolta V-mount of Minolta&#x27;s APS format SLR camera line, which was equally unsuccessful and short-lived.

While Minolta was the inventor of the modern integrated AF SLR, it took Konica Minolta a long time to enter the digital SLR market, a delay that may have proved fatal. Konica Minolta was the last of the large camera manufacturers to launch a digital SLR camera (Maxxum/Dynax 5D and 7D) using the 35 mm AF mount. During July 2005, KM and Sony negotiated on a joint development of a new line of DSLR cameras, where it was believed that Konica Minolta and Sony would market their DSLR line to the masses (much like the joint marketing and development of Pentax and Samsung K10/GX10 DSLRs).

On 19 January 2006, KM announced that all DSLR production would continue under Sony&#x27;s management; DSLR camera assets were transferred to Sony during the Konica Minolta withdrawal phase until March 31, 2006, where technical support for these cameras (primarily Konica Minolta&#x27;s other digital cameras) was assumed by Sony, who announced the first Konica Minolta-based Sony SLR — the Alpha A100 — on June 5, 2006. Sony continued the manufacture of DSLRs using Minolta technology until 2010 when the company phased out DSLRs for its SLT system but retained the Minolta A-mount.

<doc id="582770" wikidata="Q181155" url="?curid=582770" title="Particle number">
<text>In thermodynamics, the particle number (symbol ) of a thermodynamic system is the number of constituent particles in that system. The particle number is a fundamental thermodynamic property which is conjugate to the chemical potential. Unlike most physical quantities, the particle number is a dimensionless quantity, specifically a countable quantity. It is an extensive property, as it is directly proportional to the size of the system under consideration and thus meaningful only for closed systems.

A constituent particle is one that cannot be broken into smaller pieces at the scale of energy involved in the process (where is the Boltzmann constant and is the temperature). For example, in a thermodynamic system consisting of a piston containing water vapour, the particle number is the number of water molecules in the system. The meaning of constituent particles, and thereby of particle numbers, is thus temperature-dependent.

==Determining the particle number==
The concept of particle number plays a major role in theoretical considerations. In situations where the actual particle number of a given thermodynamical system needs to be determined, mainly in chemistry, it is not practically possible to measure it directly by counting the particles. If the material is homogeneous and has a known &quot;amount of substance&quot; &quot;n&quot; expressed in &quot;moles&quot;, the particle number &quot;N&quot; can be found by the relation :
formula_1,
where &quot;NA&quot; is the Avogadro constant.

==Particle number density==
A related intensive system parameter is the particle number density （or particle number concentration PNC), a quantity of kind volumetric number density obtained by dividing the particle number of a system by its volume. This parameter is often denoted by the lower-case letter &quot;n&quot;.

==In quantum mechanics==
In quantum mechanical processes, the total number of particles may not be preserved. The concept is therefore generalized to the particle number operator, that is, the observable that counts the number of constituent particles. In quantum field theory, the particle number operator (see Fock state) is conjugate to the phase of the &quot;classical&quot; wave (see coherent state).

==In air quality==
One measure of air pollution used in air quality standards is the atmospheric concentration of particulate matter. This measure is usually expressed in μg/m3 (micrograms per cubic metre). In the current EU emission norms for cars, vans, and trucks and in the upcoming EU emission norm for non-road mobile machinery, particle number measurements and limits are defined, commonly referred to as &quot;PN&quot;, with units [#/km] or [#/kWh]. In this case, PN expresses a quantity of particles per unit distance (or work).

<text>The Fairey Seafox was a 1930s British reconnaissance floatplane designed and built by Fairey for the Fleet Air Arm. It was designed to be catapulted from the deck of a light cruiser and served in the Second World War. Sixty-six were built, with two finished without floats and used as landplanes.

==Design and development==
The Fairey Seafox was built to satisfy Air Ministry Specification S.11/32 for a two-seat spotter-reconnaissance floatplane. The first of two prototypes appeared in 1936, first flying on 27 May 1936, and the first of the 64 production aircraft were delivered in 1937. The flights were organised as 700 Naval Air Squadron of the Fleet Air Arm.

The fuselage was of all-metal monocoque construction, the wings being covered with metal on the leading edge, otherwise fabric. It was powered by a 16-cylinder 395 hp (295 kW) air-cooled Napier Rapier H engine. It cruised at 106 mph (171 km/h), and had a range of 440 mi (710 km). The Seafox handled well but it was criticised for being underpowered, engine cooling was poor and landing speeds were higher than desired.

==Operational history==
In 1939, a Seafox played a part in the Battle of the River Plate against the German pocket battleship , by spotting for the naval gunners. Seafoxes operated during the early part of the war from the cruisers , , , , and and the armed merchant cruisers , and . They remained in service until 1943.

<text>was a Japanese manufacturer of, among other products, film, film cameras, camera accessories, photographic and photo-processing equipment, photocopiers, fax machines and laser printers, founded in 1873. The company merged with Japanese peer Minolta in 2003, forming Konica Minolta.

== History ==
The company traces its history back to 1873 (pre-dating Kodak in the photography business) when pharmacist Rokusaburo Sugiura began selling photographic materials at his shop in Konishiya Rokubē, the biggest pharmacy trader in Tokyo at that time.

In 1878, Rokusaburō succeeded to his family and renamed Rokuemon VI (Rokudaime Rokuemon). He gave the original shop to his younger brother and launched a new shop, Konishi Honten (Konishi Main Shop) in the Nihonbashi district of Tokyo.

In 1882, Konishi launched a project to produce photography related materials in Japan: those products were imported at that time. In 1902, Konishi began to sell the &quot;Cherry Portable Camera&quot; (チェリー手提用暗函), the first Japanese produced end-user oriented camera. New products were released respectively, and Konishi Main Shop became the leading camera company in Japan. In 1921, Konishi had his elder son succeed to the family and thus company head with the name, and in this occasion Konishi Honten was turned into a company Konishiroku Honten. The name Konishiroku was taken from the abbreviation of their names, &quot;Konishi Roku&quot;emon.

Konishiroku released their &quot;Konica I&quot; type camera in 1948, after which they would name their own company in 1987. Since 1949 Konica produced a Medium format-camera &quot;Pearl&quot;. From 1964 until 1975 Konica manufactured Medium format Omega-cameras, which used Konica&#x27;s Hexanon-lenses; they were named &quot;Koni-Omega&quot; for the global market. Two models were named &quot;Konica Press&quot; for the Japanese market.

Konica&#x27;s single lens reflex cameras pioneered auto-exposure in cameras with focal-plane shutters and fully interchangeable lenses. The Konica Autoreflex of 1965 used an external light meter cell to set the lens diaphragm automatically after the user selected a shutter speed. With the Autoreflex T of 1968, Konica improved this design into a through-the-lens meter, using the same automation system (the user could also set the exposure manually on these cameras). Other camera makers eventually adopted auto-exposure as well, but Konica was the first.

When Konishiroku got the new name Konica in 1987, the company employed about 4,935 people.
In the 1990s Konica signed its first major contract with Los Angeles County providing leasing of copiers to the Los Angeles Superior Court. This resulted in a major shift in the industry that had sold only copiers before. The County initial order of 250 copiers required Konica to redirect all of it inventory throughout North America to the county.

On 5 August 2003, Konica merged with Minolta to form Konica Minolta. In 2006, Konica Minolta exited the photography business. In March 2006, the merged company closed down its photo imaging division, which produced color film, color paper, photo chemicals and digital minilab machines. Its digital SLR camera section was transferred to Sony, currently known as the Sony Alpha line. Dai Nippon (DNP) purchased Konica&#x27;s Odawara factory site and continues to produce paper under its own brand, while Seapac acquired the Konica chemical factory.

=== Film ===

Konica was a major producer of 35mm film and related products, including film development processors and printing technology. While never equal to giants like Kodak or Fujifilm, the recognized quality of Konica film ensured general presence on market. Originally Konica film and paper was sold under the brand name &quot;Sakura&quot; (cherry blossom).

In the mid-1980s, Konica launched its SR range of film, then SR-V (1987), SR-G (1989), Super SR (1991), Super XG (1993), VX and finally &quot;Centuria&quot; in 1999.

===== F-mount 35mm SLRs =====
The first series of Konica single-lens reflex cameras used the Konica F lens mount, named after the first camera to use it. This was a bayonet mount, and is not compatible with later Konica lens mounts. The flange focal distance of the F-mount was 40.5 mm, one of the smallest ever used for a 35 mm SLR. The diameter was 40 mm.

It is not identical to Nikon F-mount, which has a much longer flange focal distance of 46.5 mm.

===== Fixed-Lens 35mm SLR Camera =====
* Konica Domirex (1963-?, prototype)

===== AR-mount 35mm SLRs =====
Konica&#x27;s second series of SLR cameras began with 1965&#x27;s Auto-Reflex. This line came to an end in 1987 when Konica abandoned the SLR market.

Konica&#x27;s AR lens mount kept the same flange-film distance that the earlier Konica F lens mount had (40.5 mm), but it has a larger diameter of 47 mm.

=== Lenses ===

Konica SLR interchangeable lenses were named Hexanon. The optical quality of most Hexanon lenses is regarded as truly superb, particularly the older fixed-focal length (prime) lenses. Many camera manufacturers of interchangeable lenses produce a few great lenses among their line, but Konica managed to achieve near excellent quality over a broad range of focal lengths in lens tests conducted by several photographic publications over the years. Hexanon lenses were used by the Japanese government as the standard against which all other lenses were measured.

<text>Louis F.&quot;Chip&quot;Davis Jr. (born September 5, 1947) is the founder and leader of the music group Mannheim Steamroller. Davis composed the music for several C. W. McCall albums, including the hit 1975 song &quot;Convoy&quot;. He has also written and made other albums, such as &quot;Day Parts&quot;, and has written several books.

==Early life==
Louis F. Davis was born in Hamler, Ohio. His family later moved to Portland, Ohio, and, when Davis was 11, to Sylvania, Ohio. He began piano lessons at age 4 and had composed his first piece of music at age 6. He graduated from Sylvania High School and went on to graduate from the University of Michigan School of Music, specializing in bassoon and percussion and playing the University of Michigan Symphony Band. Davis&#x27;s parents both attended the university, and his father played clarinet in the band.

==Career==
After touring with the Norman Luboff Choir, he took a job with Omaha, Nebraska, advertising agency Bozell &amp; Jacobs, Inc. writing jingles. These included spots for a local company, Metz Bakery, featuring the fictional trucker C. W. McCall. The spots were co-written with the advertising writer William Fries, who became the voice of McCall. The spots were so popular that Davis and Fries were persuaded to begin writing non-advertising songs featuring McCall. The song &quot;Convoy&quot; reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 the week of January 10, 1976, using CB slang during the CB/trucker fad. The duo released five albums between 1974 and 1979. Davis was named SESAC Country Music Writer of the Year in 1976.

Davis founded Mannheim Steamroller with Jackson Berkey in 1974 to showcase his interest in fusing modern popular and classical techniques. The first album, &quot;Fresh Aire&quot;, was completed shortly after. It was turned down by major record labels, so Davis founded American Gramaphone to release it. American Gramaphone has been the label for all subsequent Mannheim Steamroller releases. Eight &quot;Fresh Aire&quot; albums were released, concluding with &quot;Fresh Aire 8&quot; in 2000.

Mannheim Steamroller released &quot;Mannheim Steamroller Christmas&quot; in 1984; Davis is credited with revolutionizing the &quot;traditional&quot; sounds of Christmas. The group&#x27;s subsequent Christmas music albums have sold tens of millions of copies and become among the most popular recordings in that genre. His annual Mannheim Steamroller Christmas concert tour, utilizing two cover bands that tour simultaneously, has continued for over 25 years across the US. Davis was awarded his 19th gold record in 2010. The Recording Industry Association of America has also awarded Davis four multi-platinum and eight platinum records. Davis also hosts a once-a-year, 24-hour Christmas music and story radio program called &quot;An American Christmas&quot;. The program is produced by WestStar Multimedia and broadcast on December 24–25 over hundreds of radio stations.

<doc id="582780" wikidata="Q177974" url="?curid=582780" title="Standard atmosphere (unit)">
<text>The standard atmosphere (symbol: atm) is a unit of pressure defined as Pa. It is sometimes used as a &quot;reference pressure&quot; or &quot;standard pressure&quot;. It is approximately equal to Earth&#x27;s average atmospheric pressure at sea level.

==History==
The standard atmosphere was originally defined as the pressure exerted by a 760 mm column of mercury at and standard gravity (&quot;g&quot;n = ). It was used as a reference condition for physical and chemical properties, and the definition of the centigrade temperature scale set 100 °C as the boiling point of water at this pressure. In 1954, the 10th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) adopted &quot;standard atmosphere&quot; for general use and affirmed its definition of being precisely equal to dynes per square centimetre (). This defined pressure in a way that is independent of the properties of any particular substance. In addition, the CGPM noted that there had been some misapprehension that the previous definition (from the 9th CGPM) &quot;led some physicists to believe that this definition of the standard atmosphere was valid only for accurate work in thermometry.&quot;

In chemistry and in various industries, the reference pressure referred to in &quot;standard temperature and pressure&quot; was commonly prior to 1982, but standards have since diverged; in 1982, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry recommended that for the purposes of specifying the physical properties of substances, &quot;standard pressure&quot; should be precisely .

==Pressure units and equivalencies ==

A pressure of 1 atm can also be stated as:

:≈ kgf/cm2
:≈ m H2O
:≈ mmHg
:≈ inHg
:≈ in H2O
:≈ pounds-force per square foot (lbf/ft2)

The notation ata has been used to indicate an absolute pressure measured in either standard atmospheres (atm) or technical atmospheres (at).

<doc id="582787" wikidata="Q1529102" url="?curid=582787" title="Mannheim Steamroller">
<text>Mannheim Steamroller is an American neoclassical new-age music ensemble founded and directed by percussionist/composer Chip Davis in 1974. The group is known primarily for its &quot;Fresh Aire&quot; series of albums, which blend classical music with elements of new age and rock, and for its modern recordings of Christmas music. The group has sold 28 million albums in the U.S. alone.

== History ==
===Beginnings===
Mannheim Steamroller began as an alias for record producer and composer Chip Davis. The name &quot;Mannheim Steamroller&quot; comes from an 18th-century German musical technique, &quot;Mannheim roller&quot; (German: &quot;Mannheimer Walze&quot;), a crescendo passage having a rising melodic line over an ostinato bass line, popularized by the Mannheim school of composition.

Before the fame of Steamroller, Davis had been best known for collaborating with his friend Bill Fries on the songs of the country music character &quot;C. W. McCall&quot;, of &quot;Convoy&quot; fame. The song was based on the character created by Fries and music composed by Davis for a series of Clio winning ads for Metz Baking Company for their Old Home Bread product. Davis was named 1976&#x27;s Country Music Writer of the Year, a genre he is not fond of.

Even before the height of McCall&#x27;s popularity, Davis produced an unusual album of classical music performed entirely by Davis and musical collaborator and keyboardist Jackson Berkey, using electric bass (played by Eric Hansen) and synthesizers.

===Fresh Aire and American Gramaphone===
Since no major label would handle the distribution of &quot;Fresh Aire&quot;, Davis founded his own music label, American Gramaphone (a play on the German classical record label Deutsche Grammophon), to release the album, which was published in 1975 under the pseudonym Mannheim Steamroller. &quot;Fresh Aire II&quot; was subsequently released in 1977, and &quot;Fresh Aire III&quot; was released in 1979. The first four &quot;Fresh Aire&quot; albums constituted an exploration of the four seasons, with &quot;Fresh Aire&quot; being spring, &quot;Fresh Aire II&quot; being fall, &quot;Fresh Aire III&quot; being summer, and &quot;Fresh Aire IV&quot; being winter. All four of these albums maintained the blend of baroque classical music, light jazz, and rock and featured Jackson Berkey&#x27;s virtuosic keyboard work. Davis and Berkey used whatever instrument seemed appropriate to the piece, using a toy piano on one piece and a full pipe organ on another, with copious interleaving of piano and harpsichord. In 1981 Davis released &quot;Fresh Aire Interludes&quot;, an album that compiled Berkey&#x27;s ten piano interludes from the first four &quot;Fresh Aire&quot; albums.

Davis then moved into exploring some other themes, with &quot;Fresh Aire V&quot; subtitled &quot;To the Moon&quot;, &quot;Fresh Aire VI&quot; exploring Greek mythology, &quot;Fresh Aire 7&quot; based on the number 7, and &quot;Fresh Aire 8&quot; based on the theme of infinity. A live tour of the early albums featured a prominent light show and multimedia components, along with spoken poetry by Almeda Berkey. While the music was slightly different from the album versions, it was played in lockstep at each show, as it had to coordinate the live musicians with recorded tracks of strings and other orchestral parts.

In 1986, Mannheim Steamroller released music composed for a PBS special called &quot;Saving the Wildlife&quot;, which featured one track from &quot;Fresh Aire VI&quot; and twelve new tracks. In 1987, Davis collaborated with guitarist/composer Mason Williams for the album &quot;Classical Gas&quot;. The music was composed entirely by Williams but produced and arranged by Davis. The album opens with a remake of Williams&#x27; 1968 instrumental &quot;Classical Gas&quot;, which used the original arrangement.

===Christmas music success===
Steamroller found its greatest fame beginning in 1984 when Davis released his first holiday album, &quot;Mannheim Steamroller Christmas&quot;, featuring modern contemporary interpretations of Yuletide favorites. This was followed by &quot;A Fresh Aire Christmas&quot; in 1988.

Steamroller&#x27;s Christmas music caught the ear of American talk radio host Rush Limbaugh when it was used as bumper music for football games toward the end of the NFL season around the holidays. In turn, he began using it as bumper music on his radio show during the holiday season. As a result, Manheim Steamroller found a whole new audience among conservatives, and became one of the most requested Christmas music artists of all time.

Steamroller released &quot;Christmas in the Aire&quot; in 1995. Like its two predecessors, it showcased creative approaches to old carols, as well as some new carol-like compositions. At the end of 1997, they released a live album of Christmas music, &quot;Mannheim Steamroller Christmas Live&quot;. Their fourth all-new Christmas album, &quot;Christmas Extraordinaire&quot;, was released in 2001. While Steamroller&#x27;s third and fourth Christmas releases sold well, they fell short of the sales of &quot;Christmas&quot; and &quot;A Fresh Aire Christmas&quot;. &quot;Christmas Celebration&quot;, a compilation of favorite tracks from the previous studio albums (with one new song), was released in 2004.

The studio album &quot;Christmas Song&quot; was released in late 2007 and features guest vocals by Johnny Mathis and Olivia Newton-John (on a remake of &quot;Christmas Lullaby&quot; from their third Christmas album). Steamroller co-founder Jackson Berkey is absent from the lineup. The CD &quot;Christmasville&quot; was released in 2008. Their next release was a 25th anniversary Christmas box set consisting of previously released material, and in 2011 they released &quot;Mannheim Steamroller Christmas Symphony&quot; with members of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra.

Manheim Steamroller&#x27;s top nine best selling albums are all Christmas albums.

===Other work===
Musically, as the 1990s progressed, Davis moved into the mainstream of &quot;progressive rock&quot; music with a heavier reliance on synthesized instruments and less humor. Titles like &quot;Small Wooden Bach&#x27;ses&quot; from Fresh Aire III were not seen, nor mechanisms like the creative use of a cricket on the same album or the Gregorian chant on Fresh Aire II. Davis&#x27;s music became closer to the &quot;light jazz&quot; style that gained prominence in the 1990s, especially with the Day Parts albums.

Steamroller developed a full-length theatrical motion picture based on their Christmas albums, but the plans for production fell through. Instead, the following year, they collaborated with Olivia Newton-John for yet another Christmas album called &quot;The Christmas Angel: A Family Story&quot;, a mostly spoken-word recording scored with previously released material. The story was then turned into a figure skating production titled The Christmas Angel: A Story on Ice, starring Dorothy Hamill as the mother, Daniel Cloonan as the son, Elvis Stojko as the Gargon, and Tonia Kwiatkowski in the title role of the Angel. In 2003 they released a CD titled &quot;Halloween&quot;.

In addition to their &quot;Fresh Aire&quot; and Christmas collections, Steamroller has released: an album of Disney music (1999&#x27;s &quot;Mannheim Steamroller Meets the Mouse&quot;); an album celebrating American heritage, (2003&#x27;s &quot;American Spirit&quot;, which reunited Davis with C.W. McCall and featured a remake of &quot;Convoy&quot;); and an album , for the PBS special of the same name, mixing prior Davis compositions and a series of classical pieces by Ottorino Respighi and others.

During some holiday seasons, fans can listen to Chip narrate two special radio programs, “The Twelve Days of Christmas” and “An American Christmas” on Kim Komando&#x27;s WestStar network. “12 Days” airs in the days leading up to Christmas and, on some stations, Christmas Eve. “An American Christmas” airs on Christmas Eve on most stations. In 2024, this expanded to a full Internet radio channel on Sirius XM Radio&#x27;s online apps.!

In 2008, Davis underwent surgery, which prevented him from touring or performing with the band. Rather than ultimately force the tour to stop while he recovered, Davis opted to hire additional musicians to replace him. He also decided to create two different lineups of the band, nicknamed the &quot;red&quot; and &quot;green&quot; touring companies which allows the band to reach more cities on their annual Christmas tour. 

The group appeared in the 2011 and 2013 Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, playing their version of &quot;Deck the Halls.&quot;

A new album composed and performed in the design of the Fresh Aire series, &quot;Exotic Spaces&quot;, was set for release in March 2018. The album features songs that were inspired by famous – and exotic – sites, such as Egypt&#x27;s pyramids and the Taj Mahal. Instrumentation comes from exotic and ethnic instruments mixed with the drums, harpsichord, and synthesizers. The album was officially released in September 2019, prior to the 2019 Christmas tour.

<doc id="582793" wikidata="Q1126357" url="?curid=582793" title="Plaza de Mayo">
<text>The Plaza de Mayo (; ) is a city square and the main foundational site of Buenos Aires, Argentina. It was formed in 1884 after the demolition of the Recova building, unifying the city&#x27;s Plaza Mayor and Plaza de Armas, by that time known as &quot;Plaza de la Victoria&quot; and &quot;Plaza 25 de Mayo,&quot; respectively. The city centre of Buenos Aires, Plaza de Mayo has been the scene of the most momentous events in Argentine history, as well as the largest popular demonstrations in the country. On the occasion of the first anniversary of the May Revolution in 1811, the Pirámide de Mayo () was inaugurated in the square&#x27;s hub, becoming Buenos Aires&#x27; first national monument.

It is located in the financial district known as &quot;microcentro&quot;, within the &quot;barrio&quot; () of Monserrat. It is bounded by Bolívar, Hipólito Yrigoyen, Balcarce and Avenida Rivadavia streets; and from its west side three important avenues are born: Avenida Presidente Julio Argentino Roca, Avenida Roque Sáenz Peña and Avenida de Mayo. In the square&#x27;s surroundings are several significant monuments and points of interest: the Cabildo, the Casa Rosada (seat of the President of Argentina), the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Buenos Aires City Hall, and the Bank of the Argentine Nation&#x27;s headquarters. Underneath its lands are the Underground stations of Plaza de Mayo (Line A), Catedral (Line D), and Bolívar (Line E).

== History ==
The modern plaza took form in 1884 when the colonnade separating the &quot;Plaza de la Victoria&quot; and the &quot;Plaza del Fuerte&quot; was demolished. Its origins, however, can be traced back to Juan de Garay&#x27;s foundation of Buenos Aires itself, in 1580. Newly arrived to the dusty riverbank settlement, Jesuit clergymen in 1608 secured a title to much of the lot, on which Garay&#x27;s earlier plans for a central plaza had been abandoned. In 1661, the local governor purchased the eastern half for inclusion into the grounds of the city&#x27;s new fort; this section soon became the &quot;Plaza de Armas&quot;.

Following over a century of overuse and neglect, the local colonial government attempted to give a semblance of order to the plaza by having a colonnade built across it from north to south. Completed in 1804, the Romanesque structure became the plaza&#x27;s market and the lot to the west of the colonnade became the &quot;Plaza de la Victoria&quot;. The area continued divided between these two plazas until 1883 and with only minor changes in landscaping, chief among them the 1811 addition of the May Pyramid, a monument put up to commemorate the newly independent &quot;Provinces of the Rio de la Plata&quot;. That year, however, Mayor Torcuato de Alvear ordered the space modernized, resulting in the colonnade&#x27;s demolition and the creation of the modern &quot;Plaza de Mayo.

== Surroundings ==
== Political significance ==
The Plaza de Mayo has traditionally been the focal point of political life in Buenos Aires. Its current name commemorates the May Revolution of 1810, which started the process towards the country&#x27;s independence from Spain in 1816.

=== 1940s – 1960s ===
On 17 October 1945, mass demonstrations in the Plaza de Mayo organized by the CGT trade union federation forced the release from prison of Juan Domingo Perón, who would later become President of Argentina; during his tenure, the Peronist movement gathered every 17 October in the Plaza de Mayo to show their support for their leader (and 17 October is still &quot;Loyalty Day&quot; for the traditional Peronists). Many other presidents, both democratic and military, have also saluted people in the Plaza from the Casa Rosada&#x27;s balcony.

In an attempt to overthrow President Perón, the plaza was bombed during one of the populist leader&#x27;s many rallies there on 16 June 1955, killing 364.

=== 1970s – present ===
Years later, in 1974, Perón, then president for the third time, expelled from the Plaza members of the Montoneros, an armed organization on the far left that had contributed to the aging leader&#x27;s return from exile the previous year and had since demanded influence within the national government. Perón&#x27;s final appearance at the plaza, on 12 June, was marked by an acrimonious break with the far left, leading to two years of violence and repression and, ultimately, a coup d&#x27;état.

Crowds gathered once again on 2 April 1982, and several occasions thereafter to hail &quot;de facto&quot; President Leopoldo Galtieri for Argentina&#x27;s invasion of the Falkland Islands, which launched the Falklands War ().

The plaza, since 1977, is where the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo have congregated with signs and pictures of &quot;desaparecidos&quot;, their children, who were subject to forced disappearance by the Argentine military in the Dirty War, during the National Reorganization Process. People perceived to be supportive of subversive activities (that would include expressing left-wing ideas, or having any link with these people, however tenuous) would be illegally detained, subject to abuse and torture, and finally murdered in secret. The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo took advantage of the symbolic importance of the Plaza to open the public&#x27;s eyes to what the military regime was doing.

Protests have continued taking place, with the major last one being during the December 2001 riots when five protesters were killed and several others injured by police as they rioted around the Plaza de Mayo.

== Today ==

Today, Plaza de Mayo continues to be an indispensable tourist attraction for those who visit Buenos Aires.

Several of the city&#x27;s major landmarks are located around the Plaza: the Cabildo (the city council during the colonial era), the Casa Rosada (home of the executive branch of the federal government), the Metropolitan Cathedral of Buenos Aires, the May Pyramid, the Equestrian monument to General Manuel Belgrano, the current city hall or &quot;municipalidad&quot;, and the headquarters of the Nación Bank. The Buenos Aires financial district (&quot;microcentro&quot;), affectionately known as &quot;la City&quot; (sic) also lies besides the Plaza.

<doc id="582796" wikidata="Q5477518" url="?curid=582796" title="Fractional CIO">
<text>A fractional chief information officer differs from a traditional chief information officer in that they serve as a working member of a company&#x27;s executive management team as a contractor and may or may not serve on the company&#x27;s board of directors. 
A fractional CIO, also known as a part-time CIO, parachute CIO, or CIO on-demand, is an experienced, multi-faceted professional who serves as the part-time chief information officer of a small or medium-sized business that otherwise could not afford or would not need a full-time executive to hold the position of chief information officer. A virtual CIO or vCIO may have a similar role, but the term &quot;virtual&quot; suggests that the individual is not present in the organisation on the same basis as an employed executive. An interim CIO is generally retained for a limited time period, often to oversee a specific project or to cover an interregnum. As with traditional CIOs, a fractional CIO often helps with technology roadmaps, business process improvements, and business technology strategy. 

The key business benefit of retaining a fractional CIO is that they provide the same expertise and capability of a full-time CIO without the associated level of overhead and benefits associated with adding another top-level executive. Care, however, must be taken to ensure the skills of the fractional CIO align primarily with the needs of the business, and not weighted with technical expertise in order to achieve the best results.

Fractional CIOs typically serve several companies and may or may not engage in the day-to-day management of a company&#x27;s IT staff or other resources.

<doc id="582798" wikidata="Q1126349" url="?curid=582798" title="Connie Mack">
<text>Cornelius McGillicuddy (December 22, 1862 – February 8, 1956), better known as Connie Mack, was an American professional baseball catcher, manager, and team owner. Mack holds records for the most wins (3,731), losses (3,948), ties (76), and games managed (7,755) in Major League Baseball (MLB) history. His victory total is 847 more than the second-highest: Tony La Russa&#x27;s 2,884 wins. Mack&#x27;s lead in career losses is even greater, with 1,449 more than La Russa&#x27;s 2,499. Mack also has 17 more ties than the next-closest manager, Clark Griffith, who has 59. 

Mack managed the Philadelphia Athletics for its first 50 seasons of play, starting in 1901; was at least part-owner from 1901 to 1954; and retired after the 1950 season at age 87. He was the first American League manager to lead a team to 100 wins, doing so in 1910, 1911, 1929, 1930, and 1931; his five 100-win seasons are second-most in MLB history, with only two other managers surpassing him. He was the first manager to win the World Series three times, and he is the only manager to win consecutive Series on two occasions (1910–11, 1929–30); his five Series titles remain the third-most by any manager, and his nine American League pennants rank second in league history. However, constant financial struggles forced repeated rebuilding of the roster, and Mack&#x27;s teams also finished in last place 17 times, including ten seasons in which the Athletics lost 100 games. 

Mack was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937.

==Early life and education==
Mack was born Cornelius McGillicuddy on December 22, 1862, in Brookfield, Massachusetts, in what is now East Brookfield. His parents, Michael McGillicuddy and Mary McKillop, were immigrants from Ireland: Michael from Killarney in County Kerry, and Mary from the Catholic section of Belfast. A wheelwright by trade, Michael served with the 51st Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War. He suffered from several ailments as the result of his military service; after the war, he was able to work only infrequently and drew a disability pension. 

As with many Irish immigrants whose names began with &quot;Mc&quot;, the McGillicuddys were often referred to as &quot;Mack&quot;, except in official and legal documents. Michael’s father was named Cornelius McGillicuddy, and by tradition, the family named at least one son in each generation Cornelius. &quot;Connie&quot; is a common nickname for Cornelius, so Cornelius McGillicuddy was called &quot;Connie Mack&quot; from an early age. He did not have a middle name, but many accounts erroneously give him the middle name &quot;Alexander&quot;; this error probably arose because his son Cornelius McGillicuddy Jr. took Alexander as his confirmation name. Connie Mack never legally changed his name; on the occasion of his second marriage at age 48, he signed the wedding register as &quot;Cornelius McGillicuddy&quot;. His nickname on the baseball field was &quot;Slats&quot;, for his height of 6 feet 2 inches and thin build. 

Mack was educated in East Brookfield, and began working summers in local cotton mills at age 9 to help support his family. He quit school after completing the eighth grade at age 14, intending to work full-time to contribute to the family&#x27;s support, as several of his siblings had done. He clerked at a store, worked on local farms, and worked on the production lines of the shoe factories in nearby towns.

Mack was also a good athlete and frequently played baseball and some of its predecessor games with local players in East Brookfield. In 1879 his skills landed him a place on East Brookfield&#x27;s town team, which played other town teams in the area. Though younger than his teammates by several years, Mack was the team&#x27;s catcher and &quot;de facto&quot; captain.

==Professional career==

Beginning in 1886, Mack played 10 seasons in the National League and one in the Players&#x27; League, for a total of 11 seasons in the major leagues, mainly as a catcher.

Beginning in 1884, he played on minor league teams in the Connecticut cities of Meriden and Hartford before being sold to the Washington Nationals (sometimes called the Statesmen or the Senators) of the National League in 1886. In the winter of 1889, he jumped to the Buffalo Bisons of the new Players&#x27; League, investing his entire life savings of $500 in shares in the club. But the Players&#x27; League went out of business after only a year, and Mack lost his job and his whole investment. In December 1890 Mack signed a contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League and remained with them for the rest of his career as a full-time player.

As a player, Mack was &quot;a light-hitting catcher with a reputation as a smart player, but didn&#x27;t do anything particularly well as a player.&quot;

Mack was one of the first catchers to position himself directly behind home plate instead of in front of the backstop. According to Wilbert Robinson, &quot;Mack never was mean ... [but] if you had any soft spot, Connie would find it. He could do and say things that got more under your skin than the cuss words used by other catchers.&quot;

In addition to verbally needling batters to distract them, he developed skills such as blocking the plate to prevent base runners from scoring and faking the sound of a foul tip. (He was probably responsible for the 1891 rule change requiring that a batter must have two strikes against him in order to be called out if the catcher caught a foul tip.) Besides tipping bats to fake the sound of a foul tip, Mack became adept at tipping bats to throw off the hitter&#x27;s swing. (&quot;Tipping&quot; a bat is to brush it with the catcher&#x27;s mitt as the batter swings, either delaying the swing or putting it off course, so that the batter misses the ball or does not hit it solidly. If the umpire is aware that a bat has been tipped, whether intentionally or unintentionally, he calls catcher&#x27;s interference.) Mack never denied such tricks:

Farmer Weaver was a catcher-outfielder for Louisville. I tipped his bat several times when he had two strikes on him one year, and each time the umpire called him out. He got even, though. One time there were two strikes on him and he swung as the pitch was coming in. But he didn&#x27;t swing at the ball. He swung right at my wrists. Sometimes I think I can still feel the pain. I&#x27;ll tell you I didn&#x27;t tip his bat again. No, sir, not until the last game of the season and Weaver was at bat for the last time. When he had two strikes, I tipped his bat again and got away with it.

==Managerial career==

Mack&#x27;s last three seasons in the National League were as a player-manager with the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1894 to 1896, with a 149–134 (.527) record. Fired on September 21, 1896, he retired as a full-time player and accepted a deal from Henry Killilea to act as manager and occasional backup catcher for the minor league Milwaukee Brewers (the modern-day Baltimore Orioles). He agreed to a salary of $3,000 () and 25% of the club. He managed the Brewers for four seasons from 1897 to 1900, their best year coming in 1900, when they finished second, behind the Chicago White Stockings. It was in Milwaukee that he first signed pitcher Rube Waddell, who would follow him to the big leagues.

In 1901 Mack became manager, treasurer and part owner of the new American League&#x27;s Philadelphia Athletics. He managed the Athletics through the 1950 season, compiling a record of 3,582–3,814 (.484) when he retired at 87. Mack won nine pennants and appeared in eight World Series, winning five.

Mack&#x27;s 50-year tenure as Athletics manager is the most ever for a coach or manager with the same team in North American professional sports, and has never been seriously threatened. A few college coaches had longer tenures: John Gagliardi was a head football coach from 1949 to 2012, ending with 60 seasons at Saint John&#x27;s of Minnesota; Eddie Robinson was head football coach at Grambling State for 57 seasons, from 1941 (when it was known as the Louisiana Negro Normal and Industrial Institute) to 1997; Herb Magee served as head men&#x27;s basketball coach of the institution now known as Jefferson for 54 years from 1967 to 2022 (the school canceled the 2020-21 season due to COVID-19 concerns. Joe Paterno, with 62 seasons as a college football coach for the Penn State Nittany Lions also surpassed Mack, although Paterno was head coach in only 46 of those years. College football pioneer Amos Alonzo Stagg also surpassed Mack in overall tenure, though not in tenure for a single employer; he was a head coach for 55 seasons in all (1892–1946), with the first 41 at Chicago (1892–1932).

Mack was widely praised in the newspapers for his intelligent and innovative managing, which earned him the nickname &quot;the Tall Tactician&quot;. He valued intelligence and &quot;baseball smarts,&quot; always looking for educated players. (He traded away Shoeless Joe Jackson despite his talent because of his bad attitude and unintelligent play.) &quot;Better than any other manager, Mack understood and promoted intelligence as an element of excellence.&quot; He wanted men who were self-directed, self-disciplined and self-motivated; his ideal player was Eddie Collins. According to baseball historian Bill James, Mack was well ahead of his time in having numerous college players on his teams. Several of his players went on to become well-respected college coaches. Jack Coombs, the ace of Mack&#x27;s 1910–11 champions, became the longtime coach at Duke. Andy Coakley, who won 20 games for Mack&#x27;s 1905 pennant winners, coached for over 30 years at Columbia, where he was the college coach for Lou Gehrig. Dick Siebert, longtime coach at Minnesota, played for Mack from 1938 to 1945. James believed that Mack&#x27;s influence on the game, as great as it was, would have been even greater had the college game been more popular during the 1920s and 1930s, when Mack was at his peak.

According to James, Mack looked for seven things in his players—&quot;physical ability, intelligence, courage, disposition, will power, general alertness and personal habits.&quot;

As a result of Mack&#x27;s striving to have his players become better people as well as baseball players, he created a Code of Conduct following the 1916 season:

*I will always play the game to the best of my ability.
*I will always play to win, but if I lose, I will not look for an excuse to detract from my opponent&#x27;s victory.
*I will never take an unfair advantage in order to win.
*I will always abide by the rules of the game—on the diamond as well as in my daily life.
*I will always conduct myself as a true sportsman—on and off the playing field.
*I will always strive for the good of the entire team rather than for my own glory.
*I will never gloat in victory or pity myself in defeat.
*I will do my utmost to keep myself clean—physically, mentally, and morally.
*I will always judge a teammate or an opponent as an individual and never on the basis of race or religion.

He also looked for players with quiet and disciplined personal lives, having seen many players in his playing days destroy themselves and their teams through heavy drinking. Mack himself never drank; before the 1910 World Series he asked all his players to &quot;take the pledge&quot; not to drink during the Series. When Topsy Hartsel told Mack he needed a drink the night before the final game, Mack told him to do what he thought best, but in these circumstances &quot;if it was me, I&#x27;d die before I took a drink.&quot;

In any event, his managerial style was not tyrannical but easygoing. He never imposed curfews or bed checks, and made the best of what he had. Rube Waddell was the best pitcher and biggest gate attraction of Mack&#x27;s first decade as the A&#x27;s manager, so he put up with his drinking and general unreliability for years, until it began to bring the team down and the other players asked Mack to get rid of Waddell. 

Unlike most other baseball managers, Mack chose to wear a business suit and overcoat in the dugout rather than a team uniform. 

Mack&#x27;s strength as a manager was finding the best players, teaching them well and letting them play. &quot;He did not believe that baseball revolved around managerial strategy.&quot; He was &quot;one of the first managers to work on repositioning his fielders&quot; during the game, often directing the outfielders to move left or right, play shallow or deep, by waving his rolled-up scorecard from the bench. After he became well known for doing this, he often passed his instructions to the fielders by way of other players, and simply waved his scorecard as a feint.

James summed up Mack&#x27;s managerial approach as follows: he favored a set lineup, did not generally platoon hitters; preferred young players to veterans and power hitters to those with high batting averages; did not often pinch-hit, use his bench players or sacrifice much (even so, the A&#x27;s led the league in sacrifice bunts in 1909, 1911 and 1914); believed in &quot;big-inning&quot; offense rather than small ball; and very rarely issued an intentional walk.

Over the course of his career, he had nine pennant-winning teams spanning three peak periods or &quot;dynasties.&quot; His original team, with players such as Rube Waddell, Ossee Schrecongost, and Eddie Plank, won the pennant in 1902 (when there was no World Series) and 1905. They lost the 1905 World Series to the New York Giants (four games to one, all shutouts, with Christy Mathewson hurling three shutouts for a record 27 scoreless innings in one World Series). During that season, Giants manager John McGraw said that Mack had &quot;a big white elephant on his hands&quot; with the Athletics. Mack defiantly adopted the white elephant as the team&#x27;s logo, which the Athletics still use today.

As that first team aged, Mack acquired a core of young players to form his second great team, which featured Mack&#x27;s famous &quot;$100,000 infield&quot; of Eddie Collins, Home Run Baker, Jack Barry and Stuffy McInnis. These Athletics, captained by catcher Ira Thomas, won the pennant in 1910, 1911, 1913 and 1914, beating the Cubs in the World Series in 1910 and the Giants in 1911 and 1913, but losing in 1914 in four straight games to the &quot;Miracle&quot; Boston Braves, who had come from last place in late July to win the National League pennant by games over the Giants.

That team was dispersed due to financial problems, from which Mack did not recover until the 20s, when he built his third great team. The 1927 Athletics featured several future Hall of Fame players including veterans Ty Cobb, Zack Wheat and Eddie Collins as well as young stars like Mickey Cochrane, Lefty Grove, Al Simmons and rookie Jimmie Foxx. That team won the pennant in 1929, 1930 and 1931, beating the Chicago Cubs in the 1929 World Series (when they came from 8–0 behind in Game 4, plating a Series record ten runs in the seventh inning and winning the game, 10–8, and then from two runs down in the bottom of the ninth in Game 5 for a walk-off Series win) and easily defeating the St. Louis Cardinals in 1930. The following year, St. Louis beat the A&#x27;s in seven games led by Pepper Martin.

That team was dispersed after 1932 when Mack ran into financial difficulty again. By 1934, the A&#x27;s had fallen into the second division. Although Mack intended to rebuild for a third time, he would never win another pennant. The Athletics&#x27; record from 1935 to 1946 was dismal, finishing in the basement of the AL every year except a 5th-place finish in 1944. World War II brought further hardship due to personnel shortages.

In 1938, Mack in his middle seventies successfully battled a blood infection caused when a batted ball injured one of his shinbones. He stopped for treatment at the Medical and Surgical Hospital in San Antonio, Texas, where he was in passage on a train.

In addition, as Mack entered his 80s, his once-keen mind began fading rapidly. Mack would make strange decisions (which his coaches and players usually overruled), make inexplicable outbursts, and call for players from decades earlier to pinch-hit. He spent most games asleep in the dugout, leaving his coaches to run the team most of the time.

According to outfielder Sam Chapman, &quot;He could remember the old-timers, but he had a hard time remembering the names of the current players.&quot; Shortstop Eddie Joost said &quot;He wasn&#x27;t senile, but there were lapses.&quot; Despite growing speculation he would step down, Mack brushed it all off and stated simply that he would keep managing as long as he was physically able to do so.

According to Bill James, by the time Mack recovered again financially, he was &quot;old and out of touch with the game, so his career ends with eighteen years of miserable baseball.&quot; It was generally agreed that he stayed in the game too long, hurting his legacy. He was unable to handle the post-World War II changes in baseball, including the growing commercialization of the game. His business style was no longer viable in post-World War II America due to various factors, including the increased expense of running a team. For instance, he never installed a telephone line between the bullpen and dugout.

Despite the circumstances, the octogenarian Mack led the team to three winning seasons in 1947–1949 (including a fourth-place finish in 1948). With the A&#x27;s unexpected resurgence in 1947–1949, there was hope that 1950—Mack&#x27;s 50th anniversary as the A&#x27;s manager—would bring a pennant at last. However, the A&#x27;s never recovered from a dreadful May in which they only won five games. By May 26, the A&#x27;s were 11–21, 12 games out of first, and it was obvious the season was a lost cause. On that date, his sons Earle, Roy and Connie, Jr. persuaded their father to promote Jimmy Dykes, who had been a coach since 1949, to assistant manager for the remainder of the season. Dykes became the team&#x27;s main operator in the dugout, and would take over the managerial reins in his own right in 1951. At the same time, Cochrane was named general manager—thus stripping Connie, Sr. of his remaining authority. Six weeks after his mid-season retirement, Mack was honored by baseball when he threw out the ceremonial first pitch of the 1950 All-Star Game.

Red Smith wrote about his managerial style at the end of his career:

Toward the end he was old and sick and saddened, a figure of forlorn dignity bewildered by the bickering around him as the baseball monument that he had built crumbled away.

At the time of his retirement, Mack stated:

I&#x27;m not quitting because I&#x27;m getting old, I&#x27;m quitting because I think people want me to.&quot;

=== Managerial record ===
===Owner===
The American League&#x27;s white knight, Charles Somers, provided the seed money to start the Athletics and several other American League teams. However, plans called for local interests to buy out Somers as soon as possible. To that end, Mack persuaded sporting goods manufacturer Ben Shibe, a minority owner of the rival Philadelphia Phillies, to buy a 50 percent stake in the team—an offer sweetened by Mack&#x27;s promise that Shibe would have the exclusive right to make baseballs for the American League. In return, Mack was allowed to buy a 25 percent stake, and was named secretary and treasurer of the team. Two local sports writers, Frank Hough and Sam Jones, bought the remaining 25 percent, but their involvement was not mentioned in the incorporating papers; in fact, no agreement was put on paper until 1902. Mack and Shibe did business on a handshake.
In 1913, Hough and Jones sold their 25 percent to Mack, making him a full partner in the club with Shibe; Mack actually borrowed the money for the purchase from Shibe. Under their agreement, Mack had full control over baseball matters while Shibe handled the business side. However, Mack had enjoyed more or less a free hand over the baseball side since the team&#x27;s inception. When Shibe died in 1922, his sons Tom and John took over management of the business side, with Tom as team president and John as vice president. Tom died in 1936, and John resigned shortly thereafter, leaving Mack to take over the presidency. John Shibe died in 1937, and Mack bought 141 shares from his estate, enough to make him majority owner of the A&#x27;s. However, he had been operating head of the franchise since Ben Shibe&#x27;s death. Such an arrangement is no longer possible in current times, as major-league rules do not allow a coach or manager to own &quot;any&quot; financial interest in a club.

Mack&#x27;s great strength as an owner was his huge network of baseball friends, all of whom acted as scouts and &quot;bird-dogs&quot; for him, finding talented players and alerting Mack. &quot;Mack was better at that game than anybody else in the world. People liked Mack, respected him, and trusted him. ... Mack answered every letter and listened patiently to every sales job, and ... he got players for that reason.&quot;

Mack saw baseball as a business, and recognized that economic necessity drove the game. He explained to his cousin, Art Dempsey, that &quot;The best thing for a team financially is to be in the running and finish second. If you win, the players all expect raises.&quot; This was one reason he was constantly collecting players, signing almost anyone to a ten-day contract to assess his talent; he was looking ahead to future seasons when his veterans would either retire or hold out for bigger salaries than Mack could give them.

Unlike most baseball owners, Mack had almost no income apart from the A&#x27;s. Even when he collected rent from the Phillies, he was often in financial difficulties. Money problems—the escalation of his best players&#x27; salaries (due both to their success and to competition from a new, well-financed third major league of the Federal League in 1914–1915), combined with a steep drop in attendance due to World War I—led to the gradual dispersal of his second championship team, the 1910–1914 team, who he sold, traded, or released over the years 1915–1917. The war hurt the team badly, leaving Mack without the resources to sign valuable players. His 1916 team, with a 36–117 record, is often considered the worst team in American League history, and its .235 winning percentage is still the lowest ever for a modern-era (since 1900) major league team. The team&#x27;s 117 losses set a modern-era record and at the time were the second most losses behind the Cleveland Spiders&#x27; 130 in 1899. As of 2024 that record has been topped only three times, all by teams that played 162-game schedules, not 154 like the Athletics: the 1962 New York Mets (120 losses in their inaugural season), the 2003 Detroit Tigers (119 losses), and the 2024 Chicago White Sox (121 losses). All told, the A&#x27;s finished dead last in the AL seven consecutive seasons (1915 to 1921), and would not reach .500 again until 1925. The rebuilt team won back-to-back championships in 1929–1930 over the Cubs and Cardinals, and then lost a rematch with the latter in 1931. As it turned out, these were the last postseason appearances for the A&#x27;s not only in Philadelphia, but for another four decades. Unlike with the breakup of his second great team, the A&#x27;s did not tumble out of contention right away. They remained fairly competitive for most of the first half of the 1930s. However, after 1933, they would only tally four more winning seasons during their stay in Philadelphia—which would be the franchise&#x27;s only winning seasons for 35 years.

With the 1929 onset of the Great Depression, Mack struggled financially again, and was forced to sell the best players from his second great championship team, such as Lefty Grove and Jimmie Foxx, to stay in business.

Although Mack wanted to rebuild again and win more championships, he was never able to do so owing to a lack of funds. Even before then, he either did not (or could not) invest in a farm system. Mack celebrated his 70th birthday in 1932, and many began wondering if his best days were behind him. Even as bad as the A&#x27;s got during the next two decades, he stubbornly retained full control over baseball matters long after most teams had hired a general manager. This continued even after he became majority owner, despite calls both inside and outside Philadelphia to step down. Indeed, one of the few times that Mack considered giving up even some of his duties was in the 1934–35 offseason—when the A&#x27;s were still not far removed from what would be their last great era. He briefly entertained replacing himself as manager with Babe Ruth, but ruled that idea out, saying that the Babe&#x27;s wife, Claire, would be running the team inside of a month.

In the early 1940s, Mack gave a minority stake in the team to his three sons, Roy, Earle, and Connie, Jr. Although Roy and Earle had never gotten along with Connie, Jr., who was more than 20 years younger than them, Connie, Sr. intended to have all three of them inherit the team after his death or retirement. This strategy backfired when Roy and Earle refused to consider Connie, Jr.&#x27;s demands to end the team&#x27;s bargain-basement way of doing business. One of the few things on which they agreed was that it was time for their father to step down. Connie, Jr. was only able to force through other minor improvements to the team and the rapidly crumbling Shibe Park through an alliance with the Shibe heirs. When it became apparent that his older brothers were not willing to go further, Connie, Jr. and the Shibes decided to sell the team. However, Roy and Earle countered by buying out their younger brother, persuading their father to support them. In order to pull off the deal, however, they mortgaged the team to the Connecticut General Life Insurance Company (now part of CIGNA). Yearly payments of $200,000 drained the team of badly needed capital, and ended any realistic chance of the A&#x27;s winning again under the Macks&#x27; stewardship.

When Mack resigned as manager, he largely withdrew from active control of the team. Over the next five years, the team crumbled to the bottom of the American League. Although reduced to a figurehead, Mack continued to be treated with awe and reverence by players who considered him living history. His sons handled his correspondence by 1953 as he had become too frail by that point to do it himself.

As that year ended, the A&#x27;s were dangerously close to bankruptcy. The other American League owners had been concerned for some time about the situation in Philadelphia, since the crowds at Shibe Park had dwindled to the point that visiting teams could not meet their expenses for traveling there. Prior in 1951, Buffalo based businessman and Sportservice owner Louis Jacobs gave Mack a loan of $250,000.00 with no interest to keep the Athletics from having financial difficulty. The 1954 A&#x27;s attracted only 304,000 people, nowhere near enough to break even. The other owners, as well as league president Will Harridge, wanted the Athletics sold off to a new owner. The Yankees in particular lobbied for it to be Chicago businessman Arnold Johnson (1906–1960), who had recently bought both Yankee Stadium as well as Blues Stadium in Kansas City, home to the Yankees&#x27; top Triple AAA farm team in the second American Association. Roy and Earle Mack did not want to move the team, but pressure from the Yankees and blowback from several bad business decisions finally moved their hand and they agreed to the sale. A final attempt to sell the A&#x27;s to Philadelphia car dealer John Crisconi briefly gained Mack&#x27;s support, but collapsed at the eleventh hour—reportedly due to behind-the-scenes intrigue by the Yankees. When that deal collapsed, a bitter Mack wrote a letter blasting his fellow owners for sinking the Crisconi deal. However, he admitted that he did not have nearly enough money to run the A&#x27;s in 1955, and conceded that the Johnson deal was the only one with a chance of approval.

In early November, Mack agreed to sell the A&#x27;s to Johnson for $1.5 million. The aforementioned Louis Jacobs helped broker the deal between the Mack family and Johnson. When the American League owners met in New York to discuss the sale to Johnson, they voted 5–3 to approve the sale. Johnson immediately requested permission to move to Kansas City, which was granted after Detroit&#x27;s Spike Briggs switched his vote. Although Mack had long since conceded that his 55 years in the American League were over, his doctor reported that the nonagenarian owner suffered a sudden sharp drop in blood pressure and almost expired upon learning that his team was gone.

The A&#x27;s sold Shibe Park, now renamed Connie Mack Stadium, to the Phillies. Mack was still chauffeured around to games by his caretaker. He attended the 1954 World Series and the occasional regular season game, but in October 1955, he fell and suffered a hip fracture. Mack underwent surgery on October 5, missing the World Series that week for the first time ever. He required the use of a wheelchair after that point, celebrating his 93rd birthday in November. His death came at his daughter&#x27;s house on the afternoon of February 8, 1956. According to his doctor, he&#x27;d been fine until the 7th when he &quot;just started to fade away&quot;. Officially, it was announced that he died of &quot;old age and complications from his hip surgery&quot; Mack&#x27;s funeral was held in his parish church, St. Bridget&#x27;s, and he was buried in Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Cheltenham Township just outside Philadelphia, with Commissioner of Baseball Ford Frick, the AL and NL presidents, and all 16 MLB owners serving as pallbearers.

==Personality==
Mack was quiet, even-tempered, and gentlemanly, never using profanity. He was generally addressed as &quot;Mr. Mack&quot;. He always called his players by their given names. Chief Bender, for instance, was &quot;Albert&quot; to Mack. Perhaps due to his great longevity in the game, he appeared to have a kind of saintly image; his long-time friends objected to the image of him as &quot;the bloodless saint so often painted, a sanctimonious old Puritan patting babies&quot;. His friend Red Smith called him &quot;tough and warm and wonderful, kind and stubborn and courtly and unreasonable and generous and calculating and naive and gentle and proud and humorous and demanding and unpredictable&quot;.
Beginning as far back as his first managing job in the 19th century, Mack drew criticism from the newspapers for not spending enough money. Some writers called him an outright miser, accusing him of getting rid of star players so he could &quot;line his own pockets&quot; with the money. However, his biographer Norman Macht strongly defends Mack on this question, contending that Mack&#x27;s spending decisions were forced on him by his financial circumstances, and that nearly all the money he made went back to the team.

Mack himself was upset by these allegations: when some writers accused him of deliberately losing the second game of the 1913 World Series in order to extend the series and make more money in ticket sales, he uncharacteristically wrote an angry letter to the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; to deny it, saying &quot;I consider playing for the gate receipts ... nothing short of dishonest.&quot; With the Athletics leading the Series three games to one, several New York writers predicted that the Athletics would deliberately lose game five in New York so that Mack would not have to refund the $50,000 in ticket sales for game six in Philadelphia. After reading this, Mack told his players that if they won Game Five he would give them the team&#x27;s entire share of the Game Five gate receipts—about $34,000. The Athletics won the game and the series, and Mack gave out the money as promised.

Mack supported a large extended family and was generous to players in need, often finding jobs for former players. For instance, he kept Bender on the team payroll as a scout, minor league manager or coach from 1926 until Mack himself retired as owner-manager in 1950. Simmons was a coach for many years after his retirement as a player.

Mack lived through the entire era of racially segregated baseball; the early days of the game in his youth sometimes featured black players, but this ended by the 1890s and the major leagues remained white-only until Jackie Robinson broke down the color barrier in 1947, and even afterwards Mack never displayed any serious interest in signing black players. The Athletics did not have a black player until Bob Trice in 1953, three years after Mack retired as manager. 

Bobby Shantz, a former player for both Mack and Casey Stengel, stated that the only difference between the two managers was that &quot;One never said anything and the other never shut up!&quot;

==Legacy==

The Philadelphia stadium, originally called Shibe Park, was renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1953. Starting in 1909, it was home to the Athletics, and starting in 1938, it also was home to the Phillies, then from 1955 to 1970 was home to the Phillies alone, after the Athletics moved to Kansas City.

There is a Connie Mack Street in San Antonio, Texas.

Mack is mentioned in the 1949 poem &quot;Line-Up for Yesterday&quot; by Ogden Nash:

==Family==
On November 2, 1887, Mack married Margaret Hogan, whom the &quot;Spencer Leader&quot; described as having &quot;a sunny and vivacious disposition.&quot; They had three children, Earle, Roy, and Marguerite. Margaret died in December 1892 after complications from her third childbirth.

Mack married a second time on October 27, 1910. His second wife was Catherine (or Katharine) Holahan (or Hoolahan) (1879–1966); the census records have various spellings (the wedding register reads &quot;Catarina Hallahan&quot;). The couple had four daughters and a son, Cornelius Jr. A faithful Catholic his entire life, Mack was also a longtime member of the Knights of Columbus (Santa Maria Council 263 in Germantown, which moved to Flourtown, Pennsylvania in the 1980s).

Mack&#x27;s son Earle Mack played several games for the A&#x27;s between 1910 and 1914, and also managed the team for parts of the 1937 and 1939 seasons when his father was too ill to do so. In more recent years, his descendants have taken to politics: Mack&#x27;s grandson Connie Mack III was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Florida (1983–89) and the United States Senate (1989–2001); and great-grandson Connie Mack IV served in the U.S. House of Representatives (2005–13), representing Florida&#x27;s 14th congressional district.

<text>Melora Creager (born March 25, 1966) is an American cellist, singer-songwriter, performing artist and founder of the rock band Rasputina.

==Early life, beginnings and Rasputina==
Born in Kansas City, Missouri, and adopted by a graphic designer and physicist, Creager was raised in Emporia, Kansas. She started studying music at the age of 5, and at age 9 began playing the cello. As a child she was also a member of the Wichita Youth Symphony. Though she briefly quit playing in her teen years, after Creager moved to the east coast to attend Philadelphia College of Art and Parsons School of Design, she was convinced by friends to take it up again. In the late 1980s she played with the New York indie rock band Ultra Vivid Scene. In 1991, Creager founded alternative cello ensemble Rasputina by writing a manifesto and placing a want-ad in the Village Voice stating &quot;electric cellists wanted&quot;. Cellist/composer Julia Kent was the first respondent. Rasputina performed regularly at NYC venues such as CBGB&#x27;s Gallery, Brownie&#x27;s and Fez before being signed to Columbia Records in 1996, for whom they subsequently made two albums. Since 2005, Rasputina and Creager have released their music under her own label, Filthy Bonnet Recording Co.

Creager makes unique use of historical events and figures in her lyrics and themes. Inspirations include the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1911, Howard Hughes, Rose Kennedy, victims of Josef Mengele, Emily Dickinson, Pitcairn Island, and Columbia County, New York. Combining history and humor in song-form and spoken-word pieces, Creager is also unique in exploring women&#x27;s history through pop music.

Through more than eight albums and frequent touring, Creager through Rasputina, with varying members, has been an originator of and influence on such movements as freak folk and steampunk.

Creager has created all of Rasputina&#x27;s album covers, except for &quot;The Lost &amp; Found&quot; which was designed by artist Ryan Obermeyer.

==Other work and collaborations==
Creager played cello with Nirvana on the European leg of their &quot;In Utero&quot; world tour in 1994, including the band&#x27;s final show in Munich. According to Creager, Kurt Cobain personally called to offer her the job. She has said that touring with the band, as well as Cobain&#x27;s suicide, made her realize that she found the idea of large-scale fame unappealing, stating, &quot;Fame is just so unnatural. Fame kills and it was valuable to learn that early on,&quot; and &quot;It was an amazing experience but I couldn&#x27;t be happier being where I am now.&quot; In 2014, in honor of the 20th anniversary of Cobain&#x27;s death, Creager launched &quot;Dedication Compilation&quot;, what she referred to as &quot;a collective free arts release&quot;. The &quot;Compilation&quot;, a webpage containing poems, songs and art in memory of &quot;those we&#x27;ve lost to suicide or overdose&quot;, included contributions from Melissa Auf der Maur and John Cafiero.

Creager&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Perplexions&quot;, was released in 2006.

Creager has been a frequent collaborator of Voltaire, playing cello on his albums &quot;Riding a Black Unicorn...&quot; (2011), &quot;Raised by Bats&quot; (2014) and &quot;Heart Shaped Wound&quot; (2017). Creager was a featured artist on the song &quot;Into The Black&quot; by English band Birdeatsbaby on their 2014 album &quot;The Bullet Within&quot;. She was also credited as &quot;additional cello&quot; on the soundtracks to Darren Lynn Bousman and Terrance Zdunich&#x27;s films &quot;Repo! The Genetic Opera&quot; (2008) and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Carnival&quot; (2012).

From 1988 to 1996, Creager was employed as a jewelry designer for Erickson Beamon, creating costume jewelry for Anna Sui, Donna Karan, Barney&#x27;s New York, and &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine. She continues her relationship with Anna Sui, occasionally designing fashion show invitations and T-shirts.

Creager also has a short list of acting and film credits. In 1989 she briefly appeared as a member of the fictional Finger Lakes Trio in the film &quot;Longtime Companion&quot;. In 2003, Creager starred in the short film &quot;On My Knees&quot;, by filmmaker Kim Wood, as Hannah Cullwick, whose diaries the film is based upon. Creager also wrote the music for the film, which appears on the Rasputina compilation album &quot;Great American Gingerbread&quot;. In 2010, Creager and Rasputina were the subject of a documentary entitled &quot;Under the Corset&quot;, created by podcaster and then-future Rasputina drummer Dawn Miceli. Creager also contributed additional voices to the 2018 pilot of the Adult Swim animated series &quot;Tigtone&quot;.

==Personal life==
Creager has two daughters, Hollis and Ivy. She lives in Hudson, New York.

At some point in 2015, Creager became the victim of identity theft when her computer was hacked into and subsequently corrupted to the point of being unusable. Processing this experience, and the &quot;mental breakdown&quot; it caused her, became much of the inspiration for the 
2015 Rasputina album &quot;Unknown&quot;.

<doc id="582803" wikidata="Q58963" url="?curid=582803" title="Charles T. Kowal">
<text>Charles Thomas Kowal (November 8, 1940 – November 28, 2011) was an American astronomer known for his observations and discoveries in the Solar System. As a staff astronomer at Caltech&#x27;s Mount Wilson and Palomar Mountain observatories between 1961 and 1984, he found the first of a new class of Solar System objects, the centaurs, discovered two moons of the planet Jupiter, and discovered or co-discovered a number of asteroids, comets and supernovae. He was awarded the James Craig Watson Medal for his contributions to astronomy in 1979.

== Research ==

In the 1960s, Kowal observed with the Palomar 48&quot; Schmidt telescope, contributing observations to noted cosmologist Fritz Zwicky&#x27;s six-volume &quot;Catalogue of Galaxies and of Clusters of Galaxies&quot;. Kowal also began to search for Type Ia supernovae in other galaxies, in an effort led by Zwicky to calibrate the magnitudes of these exploding stars so that they could be used as standard candles, reliable measures of the distance of their host galaxies (work which in the present has led to accurate measurements of the expansion of the universe). In the course of these Palomar supernovae surveys with the 48&quot; Schmidt, Kowal personally discovered 81 supernovae, including SN 1972e.

In 1973, Caltech astronomers Eleanor Helin and Gene Shoemaker began an observing program to search out and track previously unknown near-Earth asteroids, the Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey (PCAS), a photographic plate survey that began on the Palomar 18&quot; Schmidt telescope. Although primarily employed by the supernova survey to observe on the 48&quot; Schmidt, Kowal provided &quot;crucial observations&quot; of particularly faint asteroids for the PCAS program with the larger telescope. His asteroid discoveries and co-discoveries include the notable asteroids Aten asteroid 2340 Hathor; the Apollo asteroids 1981 Midas, 2063 Bacchus, 2102 Tantalus and (5660) 1974 MA; the Amor asteroids (4596) 1981 QB and (4688) 1980 WF; and the Trojan asteroids 2241 Alcathous and 2594 Acamas. PCAS later moved to the 48&quot; Schmidt, and ran in total for nearly 25 years, until June 1995.

Kowal provided observations of new Solar System discoveries and reports of new supernovae via the IAU circular system throughout the 1970s, and searched for new objects. He discovered two moons of Jupiter: Leda in 1974 and Themisto in 1975, the 13th and 14th moons of Jupiter to be found. Themisto was later lost (i.e. its orbit was not known well enough to reobserve it) and was not rediscovered until 2000.

Between December 1976 and February 1985, Kowal searched 6400 square degrees of sky in the ecliptic plane for distant, slow-moving Solar System objects. Only one object was found beyond Jupiter: 2060 Chiron, discovered in 1977, which had the unusual characteristic of features both like an asteroid and a comet. It became recognised as the first object in the centaur class after a second one was discovered 15 years later. Centaurs are objects with unstable orbits which orbit between Jupiter and Neptune. They are probably drawn in from the Kuiper belt by alignments with larger planets. Chiron remains one of the largest such worlds known, and one of a handful that have a comet-like coma.
Kowal also discovered or co-discovered the periodic comets 99P/Kowal, 104P/Kowal, 134P/Kowal-Vavrova, 143P/Kowal-Mrkos, and 158P/Kowal-LINEAR.

In 1980, Kowal&#x27;s research in astronomical history found a 1613 drawing by Galileo Galilei showing Neptune near Jupiter, predating the discovery of Neptune in 1846; Kowal was awarded the inaugural R. R. Newton Award for Scientific History for this &quot;shockingly outré&quot; finding.

Kowal moved to the new Space Telescope Science Institute in 1985, where he monitored the instruments of the Hubble Space Telescope as one of the operations astronomers. His book &quot;Asteroids: Their Nature and Utilization&quot; was published in 1988, and a second edition in 1996.

From 1996 until his retirement in 2006, he worked at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, providing software for the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft&#x27;s mission to land on the asteroid Eros and mission operations support for the NASA TIMED mission.

Kowal died on November 28, 2011, at the age of 71.

== Honours and awards ==
* Kowal was awarded the National Academy of Sciences&#x27; James Craig Watson Medal for his &quot;noteworthy astronomical discoveries, particularly of Chiron, Leda, and numerous supernovae&quot; in 1979.
* The crater &quot;Kowal&quot; on Pluto was named in his honor.

<doc id="582804" wikidata="Q33681" url="?curid=582804" title="Mande languages">
<text>The Mande languages are a family of languages spoken in several countries in West Africa by the Mandé peoples. They include Maninka (Malinke), Mandinka, Soninke, Bambara, Kpelle, Jula (Dioula), Bozo, Mende, Susu, and Vai. There are around 60 to 75 languages spoken by 30 to 40 million people, chiefly in Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast (Côte d&#x27;Ivoire) and also in southern Mauritania, northern Ghana, northwestern Nigeria and northern Benin.

The Mande languages show a few lexical similarities with the Atlantic–Congo language family, so together they have been proposed as parts of a larger Niger–Congo language family since the 1950s. However, the Mande languages lack the noun-class morphology that is the primary identifying feature of the Atlantic–Congo languages. Accordingly, linguists increasingly treat Mande and Atlantic–Congo as independent language families.

==History==
Various opinions exist as to the age of the Mande languages. 

Valentin Vydrin concluded that &quot;the Mande homeland at the second half of the 4th millennium BC was located in Southern Sahara, somewhere to the North of 16° or even 18° of Northern latitude and between 3° and 12° of Western longitude.&quot;. That is now Mauritania and southern Western Sahara.

If Mande&#x27;s linguistic affiliation were clearer that would help inform its history. For example, Joseph Greenberg suggested that the Niger-Congo group, which in his view includes the Mande language family, began to break up at around 7000 years BP. Its speakers would have practised a Neolithic culture, as indicated by the Proto-Niger-Congo words for &quot;cow&quot;, &quot;goat&quot; and &quot;cultivate&quot;.

==Early scholarship==
The group was first recognized in 1854 by Sigismund Wilhelm Koelle, in his &quot;Polyglotta Africana&quot;. He mentioned 13 languages under the heading &quot;North-Western High-Sudan Family, or Mandéga Family of Languages&quot;. In 1901, Maurice Delafosse made a distinction of two groups. He speaks of a northern group &quot;mandé-tan&quot; and a southern group &quot;mandé-fu&quot;. The distinction was basically done only because the languages in the north use the expression &quot;tan&quot; for ten, and the southern languages use &quot;fu&quot;. In 1924, Louis Tauxier noted that the distinction is not well founded and there is at least a third subgroup he called &quot;mandé-bu&quot;. It was not until 1950 that André Prost supported that view and gave further details.

In 1958, Welmers published an article called &quot;The Mande Languages,&quot; where he divided the languages into three subgroups: North-West, South and East. His conclusion was based on lexicostatistic research. Joseph Greenberg followed that distinction in his &quot;The Languages of Africa&quot; (1963). Long (1971) and Gérard Galtier (1980) follow the distinction into three groups but with notable differences.

==Classification==
===Relation to Niger-Congo===
Mande does not share the morphology characteristic of most of the Niger–Congo family, such as the noun-class system. Nor are there many recognized cognates in core vocabulary between Mande and Niger-Congo. Accordingly, Dimmendaal (2008) argues that the evidence for inclusion is slim, and that for now Mande is best considered an independent family. The same view is held by Güldemann (2018).

Without definitively concluding that Mande is or is not a member of Niger–Congo, Vydrin (2016) notes that proto-Mande basic vocabulary fits relatively well with Niger–Congo, and that typological criteria such as the absence of a noun-class system should not be taken as probative; he notes that &quot;If the position of Mande within Niger-Congo is confirmed... Mande will certainly represent the most ancient branching of the phylum&quot;. Blench regards it as an early branch that diverged before the noun-class morphology developed. Dwyer (1998) compared it with other branches of Niger–Congo and finds that they form a coherent family, with Mande being the most divergent of the branches he considered.

===Internal classification===
The diversity and depth of the Mande family is comparable to that of Indo-European. Eleven low-level branches of Mande are nearly universally accepted: Southern Mande (Dan etc.), Eastern Mande (Bisa, Boko etc.), Samogo, Bobo, Soninke–Bozo, Southwestern Mande (Mende, Kpelle, Loma etc.), Soso–Jalonke, Jogo, Vai–Kono, Mokole and Manding (Bambara, Djula etc.). It is also widely accepted that these form two primary branches, the first two as Southeastern Mande and the rest as Western Mande.

Most internal Mande classifications are based on lexicostatistics, for example, that based on the Swadesh list. An alternative classification from Kastenholz (1996) is based on lexical innovations and comparative linguistics. Kastenholz warns however that this is not based on objective criteria and thus is not a genealogical classification in the narrow sense. The following classification is a compilation of both.
* Mande
** Southeast Mande
*** Southern Mande (Dan, Mano, etc.)
*** Eastern Mande (Bisa, Busa, etc.)
** West Mande
*** Central West (Manding–Kpelle)
**** Central Mande
***** Susu–Yalunka
***** Manding–Jɔgɔ
****** Jogo languages
****** Manding–Vai
******* Vai–Kono
******* Manding–Mokole
******** Manding languages
******** Mokole languages
**** Southwest Mande (Mende, Kpelle, etc.)
*** Northwest (Samogo–Soninke)
**** Jɔ (Jowulu)
**** Northwest proper
***** Samogo languages (partial: Duun–Sembla)
***** Soninke–Bobo
****** Bɔbɔ
****** Soninke–Bozo
Vydrin (2009) differs somewhat from this: he places Soso-Jalonke with Southwestern (a return to André Prost 1953); Soninke-Bozo, Samogho and Bobo as independent branches of Western Mande, and Mokole with Vai-Kono. Most classifications place Jo within Samogo.

==Morphosyntactic features==
Mande languages do not have the noun-class system or verbal extensions of the Atlantic–Congo languages and for which the Bantu languages are so famous, but Bobo has causative and intransitive forms of the verb. Southwestern Mande languages and Soninke have initial consonant mutation. Plurality is most often marked with a clitic; in some languages, with tone, as for example in Sembla. Pronouns often have alienable–inalienable and inclusive–exclusive distinctions. Word order in transitive clauses is subject–auxiliary–object–verb–adverb. Mainly postpositions are used. Within noun phrases, possessives come before the noun, and adjectives and plural markers after the verb; demonstratives are found with both orders.

== Comparative vocabulary ==
Below is a sample basic vocabulary of reconstructed proto-forms:

Below are some cognates from D. J. Dwyer (1988) ( is or ):
Note that in these cognates:

<text>Stanton is an unincorporated community in Stanton Township, Goodhue County, Minnesota, United States.

The center of Stanton is generally considered near the junction of State Highway 19 (MN 19) and State Highway 56 (MN 56). Nearby places include Northfield, Dennison, Randolph, and Cannon Falls.

Stanton is located seven miles east of Northfield. Stanton is six miles north-northeast of Dennison; and seven miles west-southwest of Cannon Falls.

Stanton is near the northwest corner of Goodhue County, and immediately adjacent to Dakota County. Rice County is also nearby.

==Community==
Prairie Creek and the Little Cannon River both flow through the community. The Cannon River and Lake Byllesby are nearby.

The community is served by an airport, Stanton Airfield, with two grass-surfaced runways. The runways are plowed in the winter. The airport serves the sport aviation community, with a notable volume of glider, classic aircraft, and Sport Pilot activity. The airport was previously known as &quot;Carleton Airport&quot;, and still appears with that name on some maps, due to its prior association with Carleton College.

Stanton Airfield is also home of the Minnesota Soaring Club, the largest soaring club in the upper Midwest. Over 25 gliders are based at Stanton Airfield. Soaring takes place primarily on weekends from mid April through November.

Despite its small size, the airport was used by U.S. president Bill Clinton, who arrived there by helicopter for a commencement address at Carleton College in 2000.

Stanton Airfield was designated a historic site in November 2004. It has been in continuous use for flight training since April 1942, when it was used to train pilots during World War II. Stanton Airfield also has a Link Trainer, one of the first flight simulators, used to train World War II pilots.

A post office previously operated in Stanton. The post office closed in the 1970s due to federal budget cuts.

<doc id="582813" wikidata="Q16106623" url="?curid=582813" title="Neil Fletcher (politician)">
<text>(Peter) Neil Fletcher (born 5 May 1944) was a Labour politician and the last Leader of the Inner London Education Authority before its abolition.

==Early life==

Fletcher was born in Blackpool and attended Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys. He trained to be a teacher and taught in schools in Leeds for two years before becoming a Lecturer in further education in Harrow and Merton in the early 1970s. He was active in his trade union and was appointed as Principal Administration Officer for NALGO in 1976.

==London government==

Fletcher was elected to Camden London Borough Council in 1978 for the Kilburn ward along with Ken Livingstone who he became allied to in Labour politics. He served as Deputy Leader of the Council from 1982 to 1984. From 1979 he was chosen as Camden&#x27;s delegate to the Inner London Education Authority. When the left took over in 1981 he became Chairman of the Further and Higher Education Sub-Committee of ILEA after failing to win the Deputy Leadership.

==Leadership==

When ILEA was turned into a directly elected body in 1986, Fletcher stood down from Camden and was elected as ILEA member for Holborn and St. Pancras. In 1987 Fletcher challenged Frances Morrell who had become unpopular with the teaching unions over staffing issues, and defeated her for the leadership by 23 votes to 22. His leadership was seen as being to the left of Mrs Morrell&#x27;s, but was dominated by the fight to stop ILEA&#x27;s abolition. By 1987, abolition was being openly advocated by many leading Conservatives to the appreciative ears of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Eventually, backbench Conservative MPs forced the issue by putting down an amendment to get rid of ILEA, and the government announced that it would go before the next elections (scheduled for 1990).

The defence of ILEA followed the same track as had been followed, unsuccessfully, in the defence of the GLC. A postal ballot of parents of ILEA school children in April 1988 found 95% opposed to abolition. The House of Lords were lobbied, but without success. With the government having little difficulty in seeing abolition of ILEA passed into law, it ceased to exist on 1 April 1990.

==Later posts==

In 1991 Fletcher accepted a promotion at NALGO to be Education Officer. Later in the 1990s he became Head of Education Policy for the Local Government Association.

<doc id="582814" wikidata="Q436535" url="?curid=582814" title="Connie Mack III">
<text>Cornelius Alexander McGillicuddy III (born October 29, 1940), also known as Connie Mack III, is an American politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Florida&#x27;s 13th congressional district from 1983 to 1989 and then as a United States Senator from 1989 to 2001. He served as chairman of the Senate Republican Conference from 1997 to 2001.

He was twice considered for the Republican vice-presidential nomination by Bob Dole in 1996 and George W. Bush in 2000. He is the grandson of Connie Mack (1862–1956), former owner and manager of baseball&#x27;s Philadelphia Athletics and a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. &quot;The Macks&quot; were once considered one of the major political dynasties in the United States.

== Early life, education, and family ==
Mack was born Cornelius Alexander McGillicuddy III in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1940, the son of Cornelius Alexander McGillicuddy Jr. and Susan (née Sheppard) McGillicuddy. He graduated from the University of Florida with a BBA in 1966. He is a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and Florida Blue Key.

His paternal grandfather was Connie Mack (1862–1956), former owner and manager of baseball&#x27;s Philadelphia Athletics and member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Mack&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Morris Sheppard, U.S. Senator and Representative from Texas. His maternal step-grandfather was Tom Connally, who also served as U.S. Senator from Texas; Mack&#x27;s widowed grandmother married Connally the year after Sheppard died. Mack&#x27;s father&#x27;s line were Irish immigrants. Mack&#x27;s maternal great-grandfather was John Levi Sheppard, who served as a U.S. Representative from Texas.

== Congressional career ==
=== Elections ===
==== U.S. House elections ====
Mack made his first run for public office in 1982, when he ran in the Republican primary for the 13th District, a newly created district along the Gulf Coast that stretched from Sarasota to Naples. The old 13th, represented by Democrat William Lehman, had been renumbered as the 17th district. Mack led the field in a crowded four-way Republican primary with 28 percent of the vote and won a run-off election in October against State Representative Ted Ewing 58% to 42%. In the November general election, he won with 65% of the vote. In 1984, he won re-election unopposed and in 1986 won with 75% of the vote.

==== 1988 U.S. Senate election ====
Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Lawton Chiles decided to retire. After three terms in the U.S. House, Mack decided to run for the U.S. Senate. He won the primary with 62% of the vote against Robert Merkle. In the general election, he defeated Democratic U.S. Congressman Buddy MacKay with just 50% of the vote.

==== 1994 U.S. Senate election ====
In the general election, Mack defeated Democratic attorney Hugh Rodham (brother of Hillary Clinton) 71% to 29%, winning every county in the state. He was the only Republican Senator in Florida history to be elected to more than one term until Marco Rubio did so in 2016.

=== Tenure ===
During his congressional career, Mack supported the passage of laws dealing with health care, fiscal policies, modification of the tax code, and public housing reform. A cancer survivor, Mack has also been a strong advocate for cancer research, early detection and treatment. Mack led a bipartisan congressional effort to double funding for biomedical research through the National Institutes of Health and worked to secure the necessary appropriations. He also secured Medicare coverage for clinical trials and was a leading Republican advocate of the Women&#x27;s Health Initiative. He worked to strengthen and reform the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Mack retired in 2000. Democrat Bill Nelson, the Florida State Treasurer and a former U.S. Representative, won the open seat. Mack&#x27;s son, U.S. Congressman Connie Mack IV, ran unsuccessfully against Nelson in 2012.

== Awards ==
* 1999, he received the National Coalition for Cancer Research Lifetime Achievement Award.
* 1992, he received the American Cancer Society&#x27;s Courage Award and the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation&#x27;s Betty Ford Award.

<doc id="582816" wikidata="Q1002934" url="?curid=582816" title="Geraldine, New Zealand">
<text>Geraldine () is a town in the Canterbury region in the South Island of New Zealand. It is about 140 km south of Christchurch, and inland from Timaru, which is 38 km to the south. Geraldine is located on State Highway 79 between the Orari and Hae Hae Te Moana Rivers and 45 kilometres to the east of Fairlie.

==History==
There is evidence of Māori travels through the Geraldine area and artifacts and carvings have been discovered in the nearby areas of Beautiful Valley, Gapes Valley and Kakahu. The area was part of the continuous Canterbury Purchase or Kemp&#x27;s Deed whereby over thirteen million acres was purchased by Henry Tacy Kemp on behalf of the Crown from Ngāi Tahu for £2,000 in 1848. Following the purchase the colonial surveyor Charles Torlesse visited the region in 1849. However, it wasn&#x27;t until 1854 when Thomas Cass, the Chief Surveyor for the Canterbury region and Guise Brittan, Commissioner for Crown Lands, proposed a town site at Talbot Forest. Following this Samuel Hewlings under the employment of the government as a surveyor, constructed a bark hut where the probably future site of a town would be. In fact, a tōtara tree planted to commemorate the birth of Hewling&#x27;s daughter with his wife Nga Hei, still stands today opposite the police station where his nearby bark hut once stood. While Hewlings was indeed the first to person to live in Geraldine, his residence was not permanent and Alfred Cox and William du Moulin abet on the other side of the river in Raukapuka were the town&#x27;s first permanent residents. The town which up until 1857 was known as Talbot Forest was firstly named Fitzgerald in honour of James FitzGerald, the first Superintendent of the Canterbury Province. However, this was later changed to Geraldine though the exact reasoning for this is unknown.

Growth in the township was slow at first with separate towns being constructed such as Healey Town in present-day south Geraldine, Maslin Town between Kennedy and Hislop Street and the German settlement known as German Town on the Downs. By 1862 most of the main streets had been named and sections surveyed and the area gazetted in 1867. At this time timber milling and the numerous sheep runs in the area were the main sources of commerce. The town experienced significant growth during this period and as the timber ran out farming took over as the major source of income in the area.

In December 1904, Geraldine was constituted a borough.

==Surroundings==

=== Talbot Forest ===
Within walking distance of the town centre is Talbot Forest Scenic Reserve. Talbot Forest is the last remaining remnants of a vast native forest that covered Geraldine and surrounding areas. The reserve is home to an impressive variety of native hardwoods, including mataī, kahikatea and tōtara, including one estimated to be 800 years old.

=== Native reserves ===
The Geraldine area is home to numerous native reserves within driving distance. These include Kakahu Bush Reserve, Orari Gorge Scenic Reserve, Peel Forest Park Scenic Reserve, Pioneer Park Conservation Area, Tenehaun Conservation Area, and Waihi Gorge Scenic Reserve.

Following controversial boundary changes in 2008, the Aoraki Electorate abolished and Geraldine became part of the Waitaki electorate with its head office in Oamaru despite nearby towns such as Temuka, Orari and Ashburton joining the Timaru based Rangitata electorate.

<doc id="582819" wikidata="Q13366" url="?curid=582819" title="Meroitic language">
<text>The Meroitic language () was a language of uncertain linguistic affiliation spoken in Meroë (in present-day Sudan) during the Meroitic period (attested from 300 BC) and became extinct about 400 AD. It was written in two forms of the Meroitic alphabet: Meroitic Cursive, which was written with a stylus and was used for general record-keeping; and Meroitic Hieroglyphic, which was carved in stone or used for royal or religious documents. It is poorly understood, owing to the scarcity of bilingual texts.

==Name==
Meroitic is also referred to in some publications as Kushite after the apparent attested Meroitic &quot;qes&quot;, &quot;qos&quot; (transcribed in Egyptian as &quot;kꜣš&quot;). The name &quot;Meroitic&quot; in English dates to 1852 where it occurs as a translation of German . The term derives from Latin , corresponding to Greek . These latter names are representations of the name of the royal city of Meroë of the Kingdom of Kush. In Meroitic, this city is referred to as &quot;bedewe&quot; (or sometimes &quot;bedewi&quot;), which is represented in ancient Egyptian texts as or similar variants.

== Classification ==
The classification of the Meroitic language is uncertain due to the scarcity of data and difficulty in interpreting it. Since the alphabet was deciphered in 1909, it has been proposed that Meroitic is related to the Nubian languages and similar languages of the Nilo-Saharan phylum. The competing claim is that Meroitic is a member of the Afroasiatic phylum.

Rowan (2006, 2011) proposes that the Meroitic sound inventory and phonotactics (the only aspects of the language that are secure) are similar to those of the Afroasiatic languages, and dissimilar from Nilo-Saharan languages. For example, she notes that very rarely does one find the sequence CVC, where the consonants (C) are both labials or both velars, noting that is similar to consonant restrictions found throughout the Afroasiatic language family, suggesting that Meroitic might have been an Afroasiatic language like Egyptian. Semitist Edward Lipiński (2011) also argues in favour for an Afro Asiatic origin of Meroitic based primarily on vocabulary.

Claude Rilly (2004, 2007, 2012, 2016) is the most recent proponent of the Nilo-Saharan idea: he proposes, based on its syntax, morphology, and known vocabulary, that Meroitic is Eastern Sudanic, the Nilo-Saharan family that includes the Nubian languages. He finds, for example, that word order in Meroitic &quot;conforms perfectly with other Eastern Sudanic languages, in which sentences exhibit verb-final order (SOV: subject-object-verb); there are postpositions and no prepositions; the genitive is placed before the main noun; the adjective follows the noun.&quot;

==Location and period of attestation==
The Meroitic period began ca. 300 BC and ended ca. 350 AD. Most attestations of the Meroitic language, via native inscriptions, hail from this period, though some attestations pre- and post-date this period. The Kushite territory stretched from the area of the First Cataract of the Nile to the Khartoum area of Sudan. It can be assumed that speakers of Meroitic covered much of that territory based on the language contact evidenced in Egyptian texts. Attestations of Meroitic in Egyptian texts, span across the Egyptian Middle Kingdom, the New Kingdom, and the late 3rd Intermediate, Late, Ptolemaic, and Roman periods – respectively corresponding to the Kushite Kerman (ca. 2600–ca. 1500 BC), Napatan (ca. 900/750–ca. 300 BC), and Meroitic periods. The Meroitic toponym , , as well as Meroitic anthroponyms, are attested as early as Middle Kingdom Egypt&#x27;s 12th Dynasty (ca. 2000 BC) in the Egyptian execration texts concerning Kerma. Meroitic names and phrases appear in the New Kingdom Book of the Dead (Book of Coming Forth by Day) in the &quot;Nubian&quot; chapters or spells (162–165). Meroitic names and lexical items, in Egyptian texts, are most frequently attested during Napatan Kushite control of some or all parts of Egypt in the late 3rd Intermediate and Late Periods (ca. 750–656 BC). Both the Meroitic Period and the Kingdom of Kush itself ended with the fall of Meroë (ca. 350 AD), but use of the Meroitic language continued for a time after that event as there are detectable Meroitic and morphological features in Old Nubian. Two examples are: Meroitic: &quot;the sun&quot; → Old Nubian: &quot;mašal&quot; &quot;sun&quot; and Old Nubian: &quot;-lo&quot; (focus particle) ← Meroitic: - which is made up two morphemes, - (determinant) + (copula). The language likely became fully extinct by the 6th century when it was supplanted by Byzantine Greek, Coptic, and Old Nubian.

== Orthography ==

During the Meroitic period, Meroitic was written in two forms of the Meroitic alphasyllabary: Meroitic Cursive, which was written with a stylus and was used for general record-keeping; and Meroitic Hieroglyphic, which was carved in stone or used for royal or religious documents. The last known Meroitic inscription is written in Meroitic Cursive and dates to the 5th century.

== Vocabulary ==
Below is a short list of Kushite words and parts of speech whose meanings are positively known and are not known to be adopted from Egyptian. Angle brackets () represent the graphemes, or orthographic letters, used to write a word, as opposed to the word&#x27;s phonemic representation. All non-syllabic, non-vocalic signs are written with their inherent in parentheses. All signs are written in parentheses (or brackets if in a word in parentheses) because of not knowing whether the is a non-phonemic placeholder to preserve the syllabicity of the script or is actually vocalic. It is known that the final in Kandake/ Kentake (female ruler) is vocalic and the initial vowel in , , and is vocalic. Since those are known to be vocalic, they are not in parentheses. Any known signs resyllabified into coda position are written.

<text>David Ismael Concepción Benitez (born June 17, 1948) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball player and manager. He played his entire career in Major League Baseball as a shortstop for the Cincinnati Reds dynasty that won four National League pennants and two World Series championships between and .

A nine-time All-Star player, Concepción earned five Gold Glove Awards as he teamed with Joe Morgan for one of the best middle-infield combinations of their era. He also won two Silver Slugger Awards and was named the MVP of the 1982 All-Star Game. In 2000, Concepción was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame and in 2007, the team retired Concepción&#x27;s uniform #13.

== Early life ==
Concepción was born in Ocumare de la Costa, Aragua State, Venezuela, the son of a truck driver and his wife, Ernestina. He attended Agustin Codazzi High School. After high school, he worked as a bank teller and played part-time for the local Tigres de Aragua baseball team. His coach, Wilfredo Calviño, was also a Cincinnati Reds&#x27; scout, and Calviño signed Concepción to a Reds&#x27; contract in 1967.

== Career ==
Following the steps of his childhood heroes Chico Carrasquel and Luis Aparicio, Jr., Concepción, originally drafted as a pitcher, came out of Venezuela to become one of the Reds&#x27; and the National League&#x27;s greatest all-time shortstops. He made his big-league debut at the age of 21 on April 6, 1970, starting at shortstop and going 0-for-4 as the Reds defeated the Montreal Expos, 5-1. He went 0-for-4 again the next day against the Los Angeles Dodgers before getting his first hit on April 8, a seventh-inning double off Dodgers pitcher (and future Reds teammate) Fred Norman.

In his first three seasons, Reds manager Sparky Anderson played him part-time, sharing duties with Woody Woodward and Darrel Chaney. In one of those appearances, in 1971, he was the only team member to reach base safely when the Reds were no-hit by the Philadelphia Phillies&#x27; Rick Wise; a sixth-inning walk spoiled what would have been a perfect game. In 1973, Concepción blossomed, both at bat and in the field, being named the starting shortstop. On May 9, in a Reds 9–7 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, Johnny Bench hit three home runs and drove in seven runs against pitcher Steve Carlton. It was the second time that Bench smashed three homers against Carlton in a game. However, a Concepción two-run tie-breaker homer in the ninth, off Barry Lersch, was the game-winner. Concepción had been named to the NL All-Star team, but on July 22, two days before the game he dislocated his knee and broke his leg (sliding into third base after moving from first base with Denis Menke base hit against the Expos in the bottom of the seventh inning at Riverfront, fracturing the fibula of left leg) and missed the second half of the year. At this time, he was batting .287, with 8 home runs, 46 RBI, 39 runs, 18 doubles, three triples and 22 stolen bases.

Concepción returned in 1974 and played 160 games. He enjoyed his best overall season, batting .281, with 14 home runs and 82 RBI, as well as winning his first of five Gold Glove Awards.

By 1975, Concepción joined Pete Rose, Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan, Tony Pérez, Ken Griffey, Sr., George Foster and César Gerónimo in the famous &quot;Great Eight&quot; starting lineup of The Big Red Machine that would help the Reds win the next two World Series titles. Even after Concepción had established himself in the major leagues as a star shortstop, he continued to play winter ball in Venezuela, helping to improve his batting. After his .274, 5, 49 totals in the 1975 Major League season, Concepción posted marks of: .281, 9, 69 (1976); .271, 8, 64 (1977); .301, 6, 67 (1978); .281, 16, 84 (1979); .260, 5, 77 (1980); .306, 5, 67 (1981); and .287, 5, 53 (1982).

On July 13, 1982, the first All-Star Game outside of the United States was held at Montreal&#x27;s Olympic Stadium. Concepción hit a two-run homer to help the National League to a 4–1 win (the NL&#x27;s 11th straight victory and 19th in the last 20 contests). Concepción was named the game&#x27;s Most Valuable Player.

Later in his career, Concepción worked with Tony Pérez and perfected the one-bounce throw to first base. Concepción was the first shortstop to use this method to take advantage of the smooth artificial turf at Riverfront Stadium and other parks in the National League.

Hampered by age, an elbow injury and shoulder surgery in 1982, Concepción had consecutive sub-par seasons from 1983–84. Grooming Barry Larkin as his successor, he became a dependable handyman at all four infield positions. He was replaced by Larkin in 1986, only 44 games away from Larry Bowa&#x27;s NL record for shortstops.

In 1988, which would be his 19th and final season with the Reds, manager Pete Rose sent Concepción in to pitch 1.1 innings in Dodger Stadium late in a blow-out game. He gave up two hits, no runs, and struck out one batter. The Reds released Concepción after the 1988 season. He attempted a 20th Major League season in 1989, trying out for the California Angels, but he failed to make the roster and retired from playing at the age of 40.

Concepcion ranks second in Cincinnati Reds history in career games played and at-bats; third in hits, doubles and stolen bases; and fifth in runs scored and total bases. He and Barry Larkin share the franchise record with 19 seasons played in a Reds uniform.

== Personal life ==
After retiring in 1989, he served as manager of the Tigres de Aragua team in Venezuela.

Concepción resides with his wife, Delia, in Urbanizacion El Castaño, a community in Maracay, Venezuela at the base of the mountains near Henri Pittier National Park. They have three grown children, sons David Alejandro and David Eduardo, and daughter Daneska. Concepción owns a farm as well as a trucking business.

On August 25, 2007, the Cincinnati Reds held a pre-game ceremony to retire Concepción&#x27;s number 13.

Joining him were several other all-time Reds greats whose numbers were retired, including former teammates Tony Pérez, Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan and manager Sparky Anderson as well as former teammates Ken Griffey and George Foster. Concepción has said that he originally chose that number to honor his mother, Ernestina, who was born in 1913. It was the first occasion in Major League history that the number 13 was retired by a team.

His number 13 was also retired by the Venezuelan team for which he played 20 years of winter ball, Tigres de Aragua of Maracay. In 2014, he was named vice president of the club. He is a member of the Caribbean Series Hall of Fame.

In 2014, Concepción returned to Cincinnati to serve as grand marshal of the annual opening day Findlay Market Parade, and later he and his successor at shortstop for the Reds, Barry Larkin, threw the ceremonial first pitches prior to the Reds&#x27; season opener.

<doc id="582826" wikidata="Q336289" url="?curid=582826" title="Trial in absentia">
<text>Trial in absentia is a criminal proceeding in a court of law in which the person being tried is not present. is Latin for &quot;in (the) absence&quot;. Its interpretation varies by jurisdiction and legal system.

In common law legal systems, the phrase is more than a spatial description. In these systems, it suggests a recognition of a violation of a defendant&#x27;s right to be present in court proceedings in a criminal trial. Conviction in a trial in which a defendant is not present to answer the charges is held to be a violation of natural justice. Specifically, it violates the second principle of natural justice, (hear the other party).

In some civil law legal systems, such as that of Italy, is a recognized and accepted defense strategy. Such trials may require the presence of the defendant&#x27;s lawyer, depending on the country.

== Europe ==

Member states of the Council of Europe that are party to the European Convention on Human Rights are bound to adhere to Article 6 of the convention, which protects the right to a fair trial.

Trials in absentia are banned in some member states of the EU and permitted in others, posing significant problems for the fluidity of mutual recognition of these judicial judgments. The executing member state possesses some degree of discretion, and is not obliged to execute a European Arrest Warrant if the country that is making the request has already tried that person in absentia.

Conditions under which trials in absentia must be recognised include: if the person can be said to have been aware of the trial; if a counsellor took their place at the trial; if they do not request an appeal in due time; and if they are to be offered an appeal.
The framework decision on the European Arrest Warrant provides for the legal guarantees relevant to trials in absentia. While the framework decision explicitly refers to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, its purpose is not to harmonise national laws on trials in absentia but to provide terms for the non-recognition of a European Arrest Warrant and other cooperative tools. The framework decision provides detailed conditions and requirements on which a trial in absentia can be considered compatible with Article 6, the right to a fair trial.

According to Pieter Cleppe of the think-tank Open Europe, in parts of Europe, in absentia trials essentially give defendants the ability to appeal twice—asking for a retrial at which they would be present and then potentially appealing the second verdict.

The Council of Europe has made commentary on judgments that are made in absentia. The Committee of Ministers, in Resolution (75) 11, of 21 May 1975, stated that an individual must first be effectively served with a summons prior to being tried. In this sense, the ministers are emphasizing that it is not the presence of the accused at the hearing that is of importance, rather the focus should be on whether or not the individual was informed of the trial in time.

In a 1985 judgement in the case &quot;Colozza v Italy&quot;, the European Court of Human Rights stressed that a person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to take part in the hearings. This entitlement is based on the right to a fair trial and the right to a defence, both of which are required by the convention (articles 6(1) and 6(3)). Furthermore, the court stressed that a person convicted in absentia shall be entitled to a fresh trial once he becomes aware of the proceedings:

=== Belgium ===
The Human Rights Committee (HRC) examined &quot;Monguya Mbenge v. Zaire&quot; (1990) in which the applicant was sentenced to death while exiled in Belgium and was only able to learn of the case against him through the media. Due to these circumstances, the committee found that a number of the applicant&#x27;s procedural rights had been violated, especially in consideration of the fact that the Zairean authorities had hardly attempted to contact the applicant despite possible knowledge of the applicant&#x27;s address. This highly impeded the applicant&#x27;s capacity to prepare any form of defense. Failed evidence to support the case that a court had tried to inform the accused of proceedings against him/her provides the committee with the opinion that the right to be tried in one&#x27;s presence was violated.

=== Czech Republic ===
Under Article 8(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms of the Czech Republic, which has the same legal standing as the Czech Constitution, no one may be prosecuted or deprived of their liberty except on grounds and in a manner specified by law.

In general, the Czech Criminal Procedural Code requires the presence of the defendant in any criminal proceedings. The code recognizes the following exemptions from this rule, when criminal proceedings may be conducted without the presence of the person charged:
* &quot;Where a defendant has died&quot; (involving the continuation or reopening of proceedings in order to clear a deceased defendant&#x27;s name).
* &quot;Where a defendant is unknown:&quot;
** This may arise before charges against a person are brought, normally in respect of pre-trial proceedings. For example, if police conclude that a crime has been committed and that action needs to be taken to identify the perpetrator, such as the interrogation of a witness or an identity parade, such an action is taken in the presence of a judge because the rights of the (still unidentified) criminal suspect cannot otherwise be adequately protected during the evidence gathering. Normally, a defendant enjoys the right to be present or represented by an attorney during the interrogation or identity parade. But where the defendant is not yet identified, in order to secure full legality and impartiality, a judge is present. This ensures the admissibility of the resulting evidence will not be successfully challenged during the trial. Typically, this situation might involve a dying witness, not expected to be available later for cross-examination at a trial by or on behalf of the defendant.
** When confiscating property involved in criminal case from an unknown owner, the property confiscated will remain the property of the unknown owner pending a trial and a court decision to transfer the property confiscated to the state. An example could arise where the property to be confiscated might endanger people, property or society, or might be used for commission of a felony. Typically, this concerns prohibited weapons or ammunition, explosives, narcotics, poisons, etc., seized by the police without, at the time of the seizure, knowing the owner&#x27;s identity.
* &quot;Where a defendant is known:&quot;
** &quot;Where an accused person is evading proceedings&quot; by being either abroad or in hiding, the proceedings may be conducted in absentia. The proceedings are then officially started by the formal delivery of charges to the defendant&#x27;s attorney. If the defendant does not have an attorney, the court will appoint one. An attorney must in these circumstances be appointed throughout the entire proceedings, and will have all the defendant&#x27;s rights. All documents intended for the defendant will be delivered to the attorney and the court must take &quot;appropriate measures&quot; to announce the trial publicly. Where the absent defendant subsequently appears during the trial, the proceedings shall continue in the normal way. The defendant may request that any evidence that had been presented in his absence be presented again; where this is not possible, he will be shown records of it and may comment on it. Where the case has ended with an enforceable judgment, the convicted party may request a fresh trial within eight days of the delivery of the judgment to him. The fresh trial may not lead to an outcome that would be less favorable to the defendant than the outcome of the previous in absentia trial.

Apart from the aforementioned cases of in absentia proceedings in the narrow sense, the defendant may also be absent during the trial under following circumstances:

* &quot;When the defendant fails to appear for the trial&quot;: only if 
**the indictment was duly delivered &quot;and&quot; 
**the defendant was duly summoned for the trial (i.e. is not in hiding) &quot;and&quot; 
**the defendant has already been formally questioned during pre-trial proceedings (whether or not they elected to remain silent) &quot;and&quot;
**the defendant has been alerted about their right to study the case file and to put forward motions for investigation &quot;and&quot; 
**the court determines that, despite the defendant&#x27;s absence from the trial, the case can be reliably decided and the purposes of the trial achieved.
* &quot;When the defendant requests that the trial takes place in their absence&quot;: if the defendant is being held on remand, a simple failure to appear is not permitted: the defendant must formally request that the proceedings to take place in their absence
* &quot;When the defendant is disrupting the proceedings&quot;: trial in absentia is possible only on basis of a formal ruling of, and subject to previous warning by, the court, and only for the necessary period of time. Immediately after allowing the defendant back into the courtroom, the presiding judge must convey the essential content of the proceedings taken in the defendant&#x27;s absence, so as allow them to comment on it.

===Italy===
Italy is one of several countries in Europe that allow trials in absentia, and they are a regular occurrence.

In &quot;Maleki v Italy&quot; (1997), the United Nations Human Rights Committee held that the Italian policy on trials in absentia was a breach of the right to fair trial under Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Italy argued that where a defendant in absentia is represented by court-appointed counsel and where he or she has an opportunity to be re-tried, the right to a fair trial will not be violated. The committee disagreed, describing Italy&#x27;s position as:

In 2009, a former CIA station chief and two other Americans were tried and convicted in absentia by a Milan appeals court for the abduction of Egyptian terror suspect Osama Hassan Mustafa Nasr. The decision meant that 26 Americans tried in absentia for the abduction were found guilty.

The trial of American Amanda Knox for the 2007 murder of British student Meredith Kercher highlighted the issue of Italy&#x27;s willingness to try defendants in absentia. In 2013 Italy&#x27;s highest court, the Court of Cassation, decided to annul Knox&#x27;s appeal (alongside the co-accused, Italian Raffaele Sollecito), thus overturning their previous acquittals, declaring the acquittal as &quot;full of deficiencies, contradictions and illogical conclusions&quot;.

As Amanda Knox remained at her home in the United States, her appeal was heard in absentia, in Florence, Italy. On 30 January 2014 her guilty verdict was re-instated for the murder of Kercher and her sentence set at 28 years and six months imprisonment.

In the case of &quot;Goddi v. Italy&quot;, the European Court of Human Rights held that the failure of Italy&#x27;s judiciary to inform the officially appointed lawyer of the applicant in regards to the correct date of the trial hearing deprived the applicant of an effective defence, and therefore Article 6 (3) (c) had been violated.

Certain case law supports the notion that in some circumstances representation by counsel at the trial will not be enough to make an in absentia conviction conclusive enough for the establishment of probable cause. In &quot;Gallina v Fraser&quot;, the appellant Vincenzo Gallina was convicted in absentia according to established Italian procedure for two robberies. The verdict in Gallina has been since interpreted to suggest that the presence of legal counsel alone is, in certain cases, insufficient to give an in absentia conviction that establishes probable cause.

== United States ==
For more than 100 years, courts in the United States have held that the United States Constitution protects a criminal defendant&#x27;s right to appear in person at their trial, as a matter of due process, under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments.

In 1884, the Supreme Court of the United States held that
A similar holding was announced by the Arizona Court of Appeals in 2004 (based on Arizona Rules of Criminal Procedure):
Although United States Congress codified this right by approving Rule 43 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in 1946 and amended the Rule in 1973, the right is not absolute.

Rule 43 provides that a defendant shall be present

* at the arraignment,
* at the time of the plea,
* at every stage of the trial including the impaneling of the jury and the return of the verdict and
* at the imposition of sentence.

However, the following exceptions are included in the Rule:
* the defendant waives his or her right to be present if he or she voluntarily leaves the trial after it has commenced,
* if he or she persists in disruptive conduct after being warned that such conduct will cause him or her to be removed from the courtroom,
* a corporation need not be present, but may be represented by counsel,
* in prosecutions for misdemeanors, the court may permit arraignment, plea, trial, and imposition of sentence in the defendant&#x27;s absence with his or her written consent, and
* the defendant need not be present at a conference or argument upon a question of law or at a reduction of sentence under Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

Indeed, several U.S. Supreme Court decisions have recognized that a defendant may forfeit the right to be present at trial through disruptive behavior, or through his or her voluntary absence after trial has begun.

In 1993, the Supreme Court revisited Rule 43 in the case of &quot;Crosby v. United States&quot;. The Court unanimously held, in an opinion written by Justice Harry Blackmun, that Rule 43 does not permit the trial in absentia of a defendant who is absent at the beginning of trial.
However, in &quot;Crosby&quot;, the Rehnquist Court reiterated an 80-year-old precedent that

<doc id="582831" wikidata="Q7912790" url="?curid=582831" title="Values Party">
<text>The Values Party was a New Zealand political party. It is considered the world&#x27;s first national-level environmentalist party, pre-dating the use of &quot;Green&quot; as a political label. It was established in May 1972 at Victoria University of Wellington. Its first leader was Tony Brunt, and Geoff Neill, the party&#x27;s candidate in the Dunedin North electorate, became the Deputy Leader.

==Policies and beliefs==

Several party manifestos sketched a progressive, semi-utopian blueprint for New Zealand&#x27;s future as an egalitarian, ecologically sustainable society. The party appealed especially to those elements of the New Left who felt alienated by the small Marxist–Leninist parties of the day, and by the centre-left politics of the New Zealand Labour Party. From its beginning, the Values Party emphasised proposing alternative policies, rather than taking only an oppositionist stance to the ruling parties.

Values Party policies included campaigns against nuclear power and armaments, advocating zero-population and -economic growth, abortion, drug and homosexual law-reform. Although the Values Party never sat in parliament, it drew considerable attention to these topics. Many political scientists credit the Values Party with making the environment a political issue, and with prompting other parties – even the German Greens – to formulate their own environmental policies.

== Origins and organisation ==
The initial idea for a new New Zealand political party came in 1972 when Tony Brunt, then a political student at Victoria University, was reflecting on his own research into the Club of Rome&#x27;s &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot; and Charles Reich&#x27;s &quot;The Greening of America&quot; (among other publications). Brunt saw the potential for a new constituency driven by a new set of social and environmental values. Brunt met with his ex-&quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; colleague Norman Smith who immediately became the party&#x27;s &quot;1st hand man&quot; and organiser. &quot;The media experience of Brunt and Smith stood them in good stead when it came to publicising the new party, and a former colleague on the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot;, Alison Webber founded the Auckland branch.&quot; At the first meeting of the nascent party on May 30 1972 at Victoria University concern was raised that they had no support, structure, finances - &quot;who is going to support this party?&quot; There was a long pause and finally the young David Parkyn, having hitchhiked down from Auckland, stood and was the first to offer his support. 

==Values Party contestation of elections==
The Values Party contested six general elections in 1972, 1975, 1978, 1981, 1984 and 1987. Despite strong showings in 1975 and 1978 it did not gain seats under the first-past-the-post electoral system in use at that time. It did however manage to get some candidates elected to local government. The first, Helen Smith of Titahi Bay, joined the Porirua City Council in 1973. The following year party leader Tony Brunt was elected as a Wellington City Councillor and was re-elected in 1977. Mike Ward was a Nelson City Councillor from 1983 to 1989 under a Values banner. Jon Mayson, a party co-leader in the 1980s, was elected a member of the Bay of Plenty Harbour Board on a Values Party ticket.

Under the leadership of polytechnic economics lecturer Tony Kunowski and deputy leader Margaret Crozier, the Values Party contested the 1978 general election with a considerable following, but again failed to win seats in parliament. Most probably this was mainly because voters at that time were more concerned about rapidly rising unemployment than anything else. The idea of an ecological &quot;zero growth&quot; society envisaged by Values Party members had met with the economic reality of near-zero GDP growth, high price-inflation, and an investment strike by business. Although gaining fewer votes than the New Zealand Labour Party, Robert Muldoon&#x27;s National Party, which promised to create many more jobs by borrowing foreign funds to build large infrastructural projects (the so-called &quot;Think Big&quot; strategy, developing oil, gas, coal and electricity resources), was returned to government at the 1978 election. In the late 1970s the German Green Party wrote to the Values Party stating &quot;we like your manifesto, can we use your policy?&quot;

===Electoral results===
==Decline of the party==
After the demoralising 1978 election result, the Values Party faced internal conflict between the &quot;red&quot; greens and the &quot;fundamentalist&quot; greens, and it fragmented amidst quarrels about organisational principles. Kunowski was ousted as party leader following the 1978 election leading him to pursue a career as a banker. He later joined the Labour Party and was elected to the Canterbury Regional Council on the Labour ticket. In May 1979 Margaret Crozier became the leader with Cathy Wilson as deputy leader; it was the first time women had led a political party in New Zealand.

In November 1980 Crozier stated she would resign as leader at the 1981 party conference, citing disagreements and instability in the party. At the April 1981 conference, delegates elected a three-way leadership with a &quot;troika&quot; of co-leaders. Janet Roborgh, Jon Mayson and Alan Wilkinson. The leadership reduced to two at the 1984 conference with Mayson and Wilkinson standing down and Mike Ward being elected alongside Roborgh. Roborgh resigned at the 1988 conference and was replaced by Rosalie Steward, previously Values candidate for West Coast.

By 1987 Values were using the description of the &quot;Green Party of Aotearoa&quot; and were increasingly advocating for proportional representation.

In July 1989 the ruling council of the party agreed in principle to wind up the party and balloted its 200 remaining members for approval. However, in May 1990, remnants of the Values Party merged with several other environmentalist organisations to form the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand, which entered parliament in 1996 and formed part of the Government in 2017. Many former members of the Values Party became active in the Green Party – notably Jeanette Fitzsimons, Rod Donald and Mike Ward.

<doc id="582832" wikidata="Q42297149" url="?curid=582832" title="Coronary catheterization">
<text>A coronary catheterization is a minimally invasive procedure to access the coronary circulation and blood filled chambers of the heart using a catheter. It is performed for both diagnostic and interventional (treatment) purposes.

Coronary catheterization is one of the several cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures. Specifically, through the injection of a liquid radiocontrast agent and illumination with X-rays, angiocardiography allows the recognition of occlusion, stenosis, restenosis, thrombosis or aneurysmal enlargement of the coronary artery lumens; heart chamber size; heart muscle contraction performance; and some aspects of heart valve function. Important internal heart and lung blood pressures, not measurable from outside the body, can be accurately measured during the test. The relevant problems that the test deals with most commonly occur as a result of advanced atherosclerosis – atheroma activity within the wall of the coronary arteries. Less frequently, valvular, heart muscle, or arrhythmia issues are the primary focus of the test.

Coronary artery luminal narrowing reduces the flow reserve for oxygenated blood to the heart, typically producing intermittent angina. Very advanced luminal occlusion usually produces a heart attack. However, it has been increasingly recognized, since the late 1980s, that coronary catheterization does not allow the recognition of the presence or absence of coronary atherosclerosis itself, only significant luminal changes which have occurred as a result of end stage complications of the atherosclerotic process. See IVUS and atheroma for a better understanding of this issue.

==History==
The technique of angiography itself was first developed in 1927 by the Portuguese physician Egas Moniz at the University of Lisbon for cerebral angiography, the viewing of brain vasculature by X-ray radiation with the aid of a contrast medium introduced by catheter.

Heart catheterization was first performed in 1929 when the German physician Werner Forssmann inserted a plastic tube in his cubital vein and guided it to the right chamber of the heart. He took an x-ray to prove his success and published it on November 5, 1929, with the title &quot;Über die Sondierung des rechten Herzens&quot; (About probing of the right heart).

In the early 1940s, André Cournand, in collaboration with Dickinson Richards, performed more systematic measurements of the hemodynamics of the heart. For their work in the discovery of cardiac catheterization and hemodynamic measurements, Cournand, Forssmann, and Richards shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1956. The first radial access for angiography can be traced back to 1953, where Eduardo Pereira, in Lisbon, Portugal, first cannulated the radial artery to perform a coronary angiogram.

In 1960 F. Mason Sones, a pediatric cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, accidentally injected radiocontrast in a coronary artery instead of the left ventricle. Although the patient had a reversible cardiac arrest, Sones and Shirey developed the procedure further, and are credited with the discovery (Connolly 2002); they published a series of 1,000 patents in 1966 (Proudfit &quot;et al.&quot;).

Since the late 1970s, building on the pioneering work of Charles Dotter in 1964 and especially Andreas Gruentzig starting in 1977, coronary catheterization has been extended to therapeutic uses: (a) the performance of less invasive physical treatment for angina and some of the complications of severe atherosclerosis, (b) treating heart attacks before complete damage has occurred and (c) research for better understanding of the pathology of coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis.

In the early 1960s, cardiac catheterization frequently took several hours and involved significant complications for as many as 2–3% of patients. With multiple incremental improvements over time, simple coronary catheterization examinations are now commonly done more rapidly and with significantly improved outcomes.

==Indications==
Indications for cardiac catheterization include the following:
* Heart Attack (includes ST elevation MI, Non-ST Elevation MI, Unstable Angina)
* Abnormal Stress Test
* New-onset unexplained heart failure
* Survival of sudden cardiac death or dangerous cardiac arrhythmia
* Persistent chest pain despite optimal medical therapy
* Workup of suspected Prinzmetal angina (coronary vasospasm)

==Patient participation==

The patient being examined or treated is usually awake during catheterization, ideally with only local anaesthesia such as lidocaine and minimal general sedation, throughout the procedure. Performing the procedure with the patient awake is safer as the patient can immediately report any discomfort or problems and thereby facilitate rapid correction of any undesirable events. Medical monitors fail to give a comprehensive view of the patient&#x27;s immediate well-being; how the patient feels is often a most reliable indicator of procedural safety.

Death, myocardial infarction, stroke, serious ventricular arrhythmia, and major vascular complications each occur in less than 1% of patients undergoing catheterization. However, though the imaging portion of the examination is often brief, because of setup and safety issues, the patient is often in the lab for 20–45 minutes. Any of multiple technical difficulties, while not endangering the patient (indeed added to protect the patient&#x27;s interests), can significantly increase the examination time.

==Equipment==
Coronary catheterization is performed in a catheterization lab, usually located within a hospital. With current designs, the patient must lie relatively flat on a narrow, minimally padded, radiolucent (transparent to X-ray) table. The X-ray source and imaging camera equipment are on opposite sides of the patient&#x27;s chest and freely move, under motorized control, around the patient&#x27;s chest so images can be taken quickly from multiple angles. More advanced equipment, termed a bi-plane cath lab, uses two sets of X-ray source and imaging cameras, each free to move independently, which allows two sets of images to be taken with each injection of radiocontrast agent. The equipment and installation setup to perform such testing typically represents a capital expenditure of US$2–5 million (2004), sometimes more, partially repeated every few years.

==Diagnostic procedures==

During coronary catheterization (often referred to as a &quot;cath&quot; or &quot;cardiac cath&quot; by physicians), blood pressures are recorded and fluoroscopy (X-ray motion picture) shadow-grams of the blood inside the coronary arteries are recorded. In order to create the X-ray pictures, a physician guides a small tube-like device called a catheter, typically ~2.0 mm (6-French) in diameter, through the large arteries of the body until the tip is just within the opening of one of the coronary arteries. By design, the catheter is smaller than the lumen of the artery it is placed in; internal (intra-arterial) blood pressures are monitored through the catheter to verify that the catheter does not block blood flow (as indicated by &quot;dampening&quot; of the blood pressure).

The catheter is itself designed to be radiodense for visibility and it allows a clear, watery, blood compatible radiocontrast agent, commonly called an X-ray dye, to be selectively injected and mixed with the blood flowing within the artery. Typically 3–8 cc of the radiocontrast agent is injected for each image to make the blood flow visible for about 3–5 seconds as the radiocontrast agent is rapidly washed away into the coronary capillaries and then coronary veins. Without the X-ray dye injection, the blood and surrounding heart tissues appear, on X-ray, as only a mildly-shape-changing, otherwise uniform water density mass; no details of the blood and internal organ structure are discernible. The radiocontrast within the blood allows visualization of the blood flow within the arteries or heart chambers, depending on where it is injected.

If atheroma, or clots, are protruding into the lumen, producing narrowing, the narrowing may be seen instead as increased haziness within the X-ray shadow images of the blood/dye column within that portion of the artery; this is as compared to adjacent, presumed healthier, less stenotic areas.

For guidance regarding catheter positions during the examination, the physician mostly relies on detailed knowledge of internal anatomy, guide wire and catheter behavior and intermittently, briefly uses fluoroscopy and a low X-ray dose to visualize when needed. This is done without saving recordings of these brief looks. When the physician is ready to record diagnostic views, which are saved and can be more carefully scrutinized later, he activates the equipment to apply a significantly higher X-ray dose, termed cine, in order to create better quality motion picture images, having sharper radiodensity contrast, typically at 30 frames per second. The physician controls both the contrast injection, fluoroscopy and cine application timing so as to minimize the total amount of radiocontrast injected and times the X-ray to the injection so as to minimize the total amount of X-ray used. Doses of radiocontrast agents and X-ray exposure times are routinely recorded in an effort to maximize safety.

Though not the focus of the test, calcification within the artery walls, located in the outer edges of atheroma within the artery walls, is sometimes recognizable on fluoroscopy (without contrast injection) as radiodense halo rings partially encircling, and separated from the blood filled lumen by the interceding radiolucent atheroma tissue and endothelial lining. Calcification, even though usually present, is usually only visible when quite advanced and calcified sections of the artery wall happen to be viewed on end tangentially through multiple rings of calcification, so as to create enough radiodensity to be visible on fluoroscopy.

===For congenital malformations===
Angiocardiography can be used to detect and diagnose congenital defects in the heart and adjacent vessels. In this context, the use of angiocardiography has declined with the introduction of echocardiography. However, angiocardiography is still in use for selected cases as it provides a higher level of anatomical detail than echocardiography.

==Therapeutic procedures==

By changing the diagnostic catheter to a guiding catheter, physicians can also pass a variety of instruments through the catheter and into the artery to a lesion site. The most commonly used are guide wires and the balloon dilation catheters.

By injecting radiocontrast agent through a tiny passage extending down the balloon catheter and into the balloon, the balloon is progressively expanded. The hydraulic pressures are chosen and applied by the physician, according to how the balloon within the stenosis (abnormal narrowing in a blood vessel) responds. The radiocontrast filled balloon is watched under fluoroscopy (it typically assumes a &quot;dog bone&quot; shape imposed on the outside of the balloon by the stenosis as the balloon is expanded), as it opens. As much hydraulic brute force is applied as judged needed and visualized to be effective to make the stenosis of the artery lumen visibly enlarge.

Typical normal coronary artery pressures are in the &lt;200 mmHg range (27 kPa). The hydraulic pressures applied within the balloon may extend to as high as 19000 mmHg (2,500 kPa). Prevention of over-enlargement is achieved by choosing balloons manufactured out of high tensile strength clear plastic membranes. The balloon is initially folded around the catheter, near the tip, to create a small cross-sectional profile to facilitate passage through luminal stenotic areas, and is designed to inflate to a specific pre-designed diameter. If over-inflated, the balloon material simply tears and allows the inflating radiocontrast agent to simply escape into the blood.

Additionally, several other devices can be advanced into the artery via a guiding catheter. These include laser catheters, stent catheters, IVUS catheters, Doppler catheter, pressure or temperature measurement catheter and various clot and grinding or removal devices. Most of these devices have turned out to be niche devices, only useful in a small percentage of situations or for research.

Stents, which are specially manufactured expandable stainless steel mesh tubes, mounted on a balloon catheter, are the most commonly used device beyond the balloon catheter. When the stent/balloon device is positioned within the stenosis, the balloon is inflated which, in turn, expands the stent and the artery. The balloon is removed and the stent remains in place, supporting the inner artery walls in the more open, dilated position. Current stents generally cost around $1,000 to 3,000 each (US 2004 dollars), the drug-coated ones being the more expensive.

==Advances in catheter-based physical treatments==
Interventional procedures have been plagued by restenosis due to the formation of endothelial tissue overgrowth at the lesion site. Restenosis is the body&#x27;s response to the injury of the vessel wall from angioplasty and to the stent as a foreign body. As assessed in clinical trials during the late 1980 and 1990s, using only balloon angioplasty (POBA, plain old balloon angioplasty), up to 50% of patients developed significant restenosis; but that percentage has dropped to the single to lower two-digit range with the introduction of drug-eluting stents. Sirolimus, paclitaxel, and everolimus are the three drugs used in coatings which are currently FDA approved in the United States. As opposed to bare metal, drug-eluting stents are covered with a medicine that is slowly dispersed with the goal of suppressing the restenosis reaction. The key to the success of drug coating has been (a) choosing effective agents, (b) developing ways of adequately binding the drugs to the stainless surface of the stent struts (the coating must stay bound despite marked handling and stent deformation stresses), and (c) developing coating controlled release mechanisms that release the drug slowly over about 30 days. One of the newest innovations in coronary stents is the development of a dissolving stent. Abbott Laboratories has used a dissolvable material, polylactic acid, that will completely absorb within 2 years of being implanted.

==Alternative approaches==

CT angiography can act as a less invasive alternative to Catheter angiography. Instead of a catheter being inserted into a vein or artery, CT angiography involves only the injection of a CT-visible dye into the arm or hand via an IV line. CT angiography lowers the risk of arterial perforation and catheter site infection. It provides 3D images that can be studied on computer, and also allows measurement of heart ventricle size. Infarct area and arterial calcium can also be observed (however those require a somewhat higher radiation exposure). That said, one advantage retained by Catheter angiography is the ability of the physician to perform procedure such as balloon angioplasty or insertion of a stent to improve blood flow to the artery.

==Radiation dosage==
===Angiography===
Imaging in coronary angiograms is performed via fluoroscopy using X-rays, which pose a potential for increasing the patient&#x27;s risk of radiation-induced cancer. The risk increases with the exposure time, consisting of 1) time guiding the probe into and out of the heart and 2) time illuminating the contrast agent to perform the angiogram. Absorbed radiation is also a function of body mass index, with obese patients having twice the dose of normal-weight patients; exposure to the operator was also doubled. Coronary angiograms can be done either transradial (through the wrist) or transfemoral (through the groin). The transradial route results in somewhat greater patient and operator exposure. Overall, patient exposure can range from 2 millisieverts (equivalent of about 20 chest x-ray plates) to 20 millisieverts. For a given patient, exposure can vary within an institution and between institutions by up to 121%.

Radiation exposure to the operator can be reduced by the use of protective equipment. Exposure to the patient can be reduced by minimizing fluoroscopy time.

<text>[[Sayadaw]] U Paṇḍita (, ; also &quot;Ovādācariya Sayādo Ū Paṇḍitābhivaṁsa&quot;; 28 July 1921 – 16 April 2016) was one of the foremost masters of Vipassanā. He trained in the Theravada Buddhist tradition of Myanmar. A successor to the late Mahāsi Sayādaw, he has taught many of the Western teachers and students of the Mahāsi style of Vipassanā meditation. He was the abbot of Meditation Center in Yangon, Myanmar.

==Early life and education==
U Paṇḍita was born in 1921 in Insein in greater Rangoon (now Yangon) during British colonial rule. He became a novice at age twelve, and ordained at age twenty. After decades of study, he passed the rigorous series of government examinations in the Theravāda Buddhist texts, gaining the Dhammācariya (Dhamma teacher) degree in 1952.

U Paṇḍita began practicing Vipassana under the guidance of Mahāsi Sayādaw beginning in 1950.

==Career==
In 1955, he left his position as a teacher of scriptural studies to become a meditation teacher at the Mahāsi Meditation Center. Soon after Mahasi Sayādaw died in 1982, U Paṇḍita became the guiding teacher (Ovādacariya) of the Mahasi Meditation Center. In 1991, he left that position, founding Meditation Center in Yangon. There are now branch centers in Myanmar, Nepal, Australia, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States.

U Paṇḍita became well known in the West after conducting a retreat in the spring of 1984 at the Insight Meditation Society (IMS) in Barre, Massachusetts in the United States. Many of the senior Western meditation teachers in the Mahāsi tradition practiced with U Paṇḍita at that and subsequent retreats. The talks he gave in 1984 at IMS were compiled as the book &quot;In This Very Life&quot;.

Until his death at age 94 in 2016, he continued to lead retreats and give Dhamma talks, but he rarely gave interviews.

==Method and style of teaching==
U Paṇḍita was known for teaching a rigorous and precise method of self-examination. He taught  or Vipassanā, emphasizing Buddhist ethics as a requisite foundation. He was also an erudite scholar of the Pali &quot;&quot;, the Theravāda Canon.

==Referred to by others==
Judson Brewer a meditation researcher, uses Paṇḍita&#x27;s quote to illustrate the difference between dopamine secretions and joy: &quot;In their quest for happiness, people mistake excitement of the mind for real happiness.&quot;

<doc id="582834" wikidata="Q1425227" url="?curid=582834" title="HSV-2 Swift">
<text>HSV-2 &quot;Swift&quot; is a hybrid catamaran. She was privately owned and operated by Sealift Inc., and was originally built under the JHSV program as a proof of concept. As part of this program, she was directly leased for evaluation from her builders by the United States Navy Military Sealift Command from 2003 to 2013, primarily as a mine countermeasures and sea basing test platform. Later during her official naval career she was mostly used for fleet support and humanitarian partnership missions.

In July 2015, the ship was leased by the United Arab Emirates National Marine Dredging Company and was used to carry aid through the Bab Al Mandab strait. On 1 October 2016, the ship was attacked and damaged off the coast of Yemen by Iranian-backed rebel Houthis, who at the time claimed to have sunk the ship. According to unnamed U.S. Department of Defense officials, the ship was damaged and was being towed to Eritrea. The vessel sustained serious damage to its bow, but remained afloat.

==Design and description==
The ship is a wave-piercing, aluminum-hulled, commercial catamaran with military enhancements, such as a helicopter flight deck, vehicle deck, small boat and unmanned vehicle launch and recovery capability, and a communications suite. She features a new, modular design, which will allow her to be refitted to support missions without requiring long shipyard periods. While from the front the vessel looks like a trimaran, the center hull does not rest in the water and is not used for buoyancy. As a logistics vessel, the ship does not have water-tight compartments or weapons systems. Propulsion is provided by directional water jets, so the ship does not have propellers or a rudder for steering, and can maneuver in of water.

The HSV stands for &quot;High Speed Vessel&quot;, and her home port while chartered as a MSC vessel was Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek in Norfolk, Virginia. The vessel had two CONMAR crews that typically rotated every three months to keep the ship deployed eleven months per year. The minimum crew size is 35; during her time with the MSC 18 were military with the balance civilian, provided through American Maritime Officers and Seafarers International Union of the United States Merchant Marine. On rare occasion that she was in a United States port, it was usually Naval Station Mayport, Florida, supporting the Fourth Fleet or Charleston, South Carolina, for major maintenance. Rota, Spain, was considered by the crew to be the &quot;Mediterranean home away from home.

==Construction and acquisition==
The ship was constructed by the Australian shipbuilder Incat in Hobart, Tasmania, and was leased to the U.S. Navy through Bollinger/Incat of Lockport, Louisiana. She was the second catamaran the Navy leased to test new technologies and concepts associated with the Chief of Naval Operations&#x27;s &quot;Sea Power 21&quot; plan. The contract value for the first year was $21.7 million.

&quot;Swift&quot; is the fourth Incat-built high-speed wave piercing catamaran to enter military service, following behind , United States Army Vessel (USAV) Theater Support Vessel and .

==US flagged service ==
The first ship of this class to be used by the Navy, &quot;Joint Venture&quot; (HSV-X1), proved her military mettle during the 2003 invasion of Iraq as a forward staging platform for Marine Fleet Anti-Terrorism and United States Navy SEAL teams in the shallow waters of Umm Qasr, Iraq. The Navy hoped to build upon lessons learned from &quot;Swift&quot; and her predecessor, and eventually use the information to create a new class of littoral combat ships.

In the autumn of 2003, while operating with the Fifth Fleet, &quot;Swift&quot; completed the fastest-ever transit of the northern Great Barrier Reef from Cairns to Booby Island, Australia, averaging slightly over . During flight deck certifications, &quot;Swift&quot;″s crew conducted aircraft recovery while making during one recovery and had apparent winds during another recovery.

In November 2003 she began West African Training Cruise-04. She first visited the South African Navy (SAN) base at Durban on 3 November 2003. She then exercised with the SAN and the South African Air Force off Simon&#x27;s Town in the Western Cape. As of early November 2003, as reported by Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly on 19 November 2003, exercises were also planned with Cameroon, Gambia, Ghana, Morocco, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. &quot;Swift&quot; had embarked a small United States Marine Corps (USMC) detachment for the cruise, &#x27;which will draw on Norway Air-Landed Marine Expeditionary Brigade equipment for the exercises.&#x27; The Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly story said that Marine reservists will practice with the NALMEB (Norway Air-Landed Marine Expeditionary Brigade) equipment, and the cruise would also be used to evaluate an experimental lightweight ROWPU that was at that time being tested by the USMC warfighting laboratory. The vessel returned in early 2004. In 2004, the United States Navy tested the Australian built &quot;Swift&quot; in the multinational exercise RIMPAC.
In January 2005, &quot;Swift&quot; was tapped to provide logistical assistance during the tsunami relief effort in North Sumatra. &quot;Swift&quot; departed Naval Station Ingleside, Texas, on 3 January 2005. &quot;Swift&quot; was in Pearl Harbor 15 January 2005, on the way to provide assistance following the tsunami. The ship arrived in Singapore on 30 January 2005, Belawan, Indonesia 3 February 2005 and Sattahip, Thailand, on 7 February 2005.

Prior to arriving in the tsunami affected region, crews were swapped in Pearl Harbor, with Gold crew relieving Blue crew in less than eight hours. &quot;Swift&quot; embarked a helicopter detachment, and served as a base of operations for two helicopters and their crew for 30 consecutive days at sea. During the operation, &quot;Swift&quot; sailed for 30 straight days, supported a helicopter detachment and support crew and conducted two underway replenishments.
In 2005, &quot;Swift&quot; played a major role in Hurricane Katrina relief efforts. With most roads inaccessible along the Gulf Coast, &quot;Swift&quot; and her crew delivered the necessary supplies by water, traversing the Mississippi River multiple times hauling humanitarian aid between Pensacola, Florida, and New Orleans, Louisiana.

During the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, &quot;Swift&quot; was used to transport humanitarian assistance materials from Cyprus to Beirut.
&quot;Swift&quot; departed Naval Station Mayport, Florida, on 25 April 2007, to serve as a Global Fleet Station (GFS). The ship hosted more than 1,000 host nation military and civilian personnel during twelve visits to seven countries such as Belize, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua and Panama. In these countries, personnel on board &quot;Swift&quot; conducted 39,890 hours of subject matter expert exchanges in such areas as leadership, small boat operations, port security and small unit tactics.

The six-month U.S. Navy sponsored GFS deployment tested the Navy&#x27;s GFS concept, a maritime security cooperation initiative aimed at strengthening global partnerships through training and cooperation activities. &quot;Swift&quot; transported U.S. military training teams to conduct maritime training with regional civil and maritime services.

During the last half of the deployment, more than of medical and food supplies were donated through Project Handclasp. &quot;Swift&quot; hosted numerous dignitaries, including the Prime Minister of Jamaica and U.S. Ambassadors to Panama, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras and Jamaica.

The GFS pilot mission was completed on 30 September 2007, when &quot;Swift&quot; returned to Naval Station Mayport, Florida.

On 5 May 2010, &quot;Swift&quot;, along with various embarked Navy and Marine Corps units, departed Naval Station Mayport for a five-month deployment for Southern Partnership Station (SPS) 2010.

While in port, &quot;Swift&quot; received 140 Project Handclasp pallets and two fire engines. The Wisconsin National Guard State Partnership Program donated the fire engines to Project Handclasp for transportation to Nicaragua, their partner nation.

Project Handclasp is a U.S. Navy program that accepts and transports educational, humanitarian and goodwill material on a space-available basis aboard U.S. Navy ships for distribution to foreign nation recipients.

SPS is an annual deployment of various specialty platforms to the U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) area of responsibility (AOR) in the Caribbean and Latin America. The mission&#x27;s primary goal is information sharing with navies, coast guards, and civilian services throughout the region.

In April 2013, a TIF-25K Tethered Aerostat (unmanned blimp) was tested from the stern of &quot;Swift&quot;. The aerostat could be positioned above the vessel for surveillance.

&quot;Swift&quot; was to be replaced with when that vessel came into service. Originally chartered in July 2003 as an interim mine warfare command and support ship for &quot;transformational&quot; mine warfare modular mission payload initiatives, the ship had been sent to the Persian Gulf, South Africa, the North Sea, and Hawaii within one year. Other locations included the Gulf of Mexico, Singapore, Thailand, Sicily, Spain, and southern California. As mine demonstration missions wore down, &quot;Swift&quot; was used in partnership missions, performing extended cruises to Africa, the Caribbean, and Central and South America. The five-year charter was renewed in 2008, and the ship continued to serve until the introduction of Joint High Speed Vessels. &quot;Swift&quot; ended her service with Military Sealift Command in 2013.

== UAE flagged service ==
&quot;Swift&quot; returned to Incat at Hobart in July 2013 for refit for sale or charter. As of July 2015 the vessel was reportedly being operated by the UAE&#x27;s National Marine Dredging Company. The ship was used to carry aid, wounded, and passengers as part of the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen through Bab Al Mandeb strait.

=== Attack off the coast of Yemen ===

On 1 October 2016, Iranian-backed rebel Houthis claimed to have attacked and sunk &quot;Swift&quot; off the Yemeni coast around Bab-el-Mandeb strait. The UAE military reported &quot;Swift&quot; had been involved in an &quot;incident&quot;, but there were no casualties. UAE military reported that &quot;Swift&quot; was carrying aid when she was attacked and that the ship did not have any military capacity. Saudi Arabia reported that their forces rescued passengers from a damaged UAE ship at dawn on 1 October 2016. There are conflicting reports as to whether she was en route to Aden, a regular destination, or Mokha at the time she was attacked. Unnamed U.S. Defense officials reported that four &quot;shoulder-fired rockets&quot; were used in the attack, but Houthis said it was a C-802/Noor anti-ship missile. According to open source naval analyst and retired Navy Captain Chris Carlson, the shrapnel damage to &quot;Swift&quot; indicates she was hit by EFP warhead, most likely a C-802.

U.S. Navy destroyers and , and amphibious transport dock were dispatched to the area &quot;to ensure that shipping continues unimpeded in the strait and the vicinity.&quot; &quot;Mason&quot; and &quot;Ponce&quot; were subsequently attacked on 9 October, 12 October and again on 15 October. U.S. Defense officials said that &quot;Swift&quot; was in tow to Eritrea as of 3 October 2016. Later photographs proved that she was still afloat, albeit heavily damaged, as of 5 October 2016.

==Move to Greece==
Social media reports showed her afloat in a Greek port in July 2017 with significant damage to the port bow. , &quot;Swift&quot; 1 is reportedly now owned by Greek ferry company Seajets. In 2018 she was renamed &quot;Ift.&quot;

<doc id="582837" wikidata="Q26082" url="?curid=582837" title="Ishtar Gate">
<text>The Ishtar Gate was the eighth gate to the inner city of Babylon (in the area of present-day Hillah, Babil Governorate, Iraq). It was constructed by order of King Nebuchadnezzar II on the north side of the city. It was part of a grand walled processional way leading into the city.

The original structure was a double gate with a smaller frontal gate and a larger and more grandiose secondary posterior section. The walls were finished in glazed bricks mostly in blue, with animals and deities (also made up of coloured bricks) in low relief at intervals. The gate was 15 metres high, and the original foundations extended another 14 metres underground.

German archaeologist Robert Koldewey led the excavation of the site from 1904 to 1914. After the end of the First World War in 1918, the smaller frontal gate was reconstructed in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin.

Other panels from the façade of the gate are located in many other museums around the world.

The façade of the Iraqi embassy in Beijing, China includes a replica of the Ishtar Gate. The façades of the Iraqi embassies in Amman, Jordan and Islamabad, Pakistan also evoke the Ishtar Gate.

==History==

King Nebuchadnezzar II reigned 604–562 BC, the peak of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. He is known as the biblical conqueror who captured Jerusalem. He ordered the construction of the gate and dedicated it to the Babylonian goddess Ishtar. The gate was constructed using glazed brick with alternating rows of bas-relief &quot;mušḫuššu&quot; (dragons), aurochs (bulls), and lions, symbolizing the gods Marduk, Adad, and Ishtar respectively.

The roof and doors of the gate were made of cedar, according to the dedication plaque. The bricks in the gate were covered in a blue glaze meant to represent lapis lazuli, a deep-blue semi-precious stone that was revered in antiquity due to its vibrancy. The blue-glazed bricks would have given the façade a jewel-like shine. Through the gate ran the Processional Way, which was lined with walls showing about 120 lions, bulls, dragons, and flowers on yellow and black glazed bricks, symbolizing the goddess Ishtar. The gate itself depicted only gods and goddesses. These included Ishtar, Adad, and Marduk. During celebrations of the New Year, statues of the deities were paraded through the gate and down the Processional Way.

==Design==
The front of the gate has a low-relief design with a repeated pattern of images of two of the major gods of the Babylonian pantheon. Marduk, the national deity and chief god, with his servant dragon Mušḫuššu, is depicted as a dragon with a snake-like head and tail, a scaled body of a lion, and powerful talons for back feet. Marduk was seen as the divine champion of good against evil, and the incantations of the Babylonians often sought his protection.

The second god shown in the pattern of reliefs on the Ishtar Gate is Adad (also known as Ishkur), whose sacred animal was the aurochs, a now-extinct ancestor of cattle. Adad had power over destructive storms and beneficial rain. The design of the Ishtar Gate also includes linear borders and patterns of rosettes, often seen as symbols of fertility.

The bricks of the Ishtar gate were made from finely textured clay pressed into wooden forms. Each of the animal reliefs was also made from bricks formed by pressing clay into reusable molds. Seams between the bricks were carefully planned not to occur on the eyes of the animals or any other aesthetically unacceptable places. The bricks were sun-dried and then fired once before glazing. The clay was brownish red in this bisque-fired state.

The background glazes are mainly a vivid blue, which imitates the color of the highly prized lapis lazuli. Gold and brown glazes are used for animal images. The borders and rosettes are glazed in black, white, and gold. It is believed that the glaze recipe used plant ash, sandstone conglomerates, and pebbles for silicates. This combination was repeatedly melted, cooled, and then pulverized. This mixture of silica and fluxes is called a frit. Color-producing minerals, such as cobalt, were added in the final glaze formulations. This was then painted onto the bisque-fired bricks and fired to a higher temperature in a glaze firing.

The creation of the gate out of wood and clay glazed to look like lapis lazuli could possibly be a reference to the goddess Inanna, who became syncretized with the goddess Ishtar during the reign of Sargon of Akkad. In the myth of Inanna&#x27;s descent to the underworld, Inanna is described as donning seven accoutrements of lapis lazuli symbolizing her divine power. Once captured by the queen of the underworld, Inanna is described as being lapis lazuli, silver, and wood, two of these materials being key components in the construction of the Ishtar Gate. The creation of the gate out of wood and &quot;lapis lazuli&quot; linking the gate to being part of the Goddess herself.

After the glaze firing, the bricks were assembled, leaving narrow horizontal seams from one to six millimeters. The seams were then sealed with a naturally occurring black viscous substance called bitumen, like modern asphalt. The Ishtar Gate is only one small part of the design of ancient Babylon that also included the palace, temples, an inner fortress, walls, gardens, other gates, and the Processional Way. The lavish city was decorated with over 15 million baked bricks, according to estimates.

The main gate led to the Southern Citadel, the gate itself seeming to be a part of Imgur-Bel and Nimitti-Bel, two of the most prominent defensive walls of Babylon. There were three primary entrances to the Ishtar Gate: the central entrance which contained the double gate structure (two sets of double doors, for a fourfold door structure), and doors flanking the main entrance to the left and right, both containing the signature double door structure.

==Ishtar Gate and Processional Way==

Once per year, the Ishtar Gate and connecting Processional Way were used for a New Year&#x27;s procession, which was part of a religious festival celebrating the beginning of the agricultural year. In Babylon, the rituals surrounding this holiday lasted twelve days. The New Year&#x27;s celebrations started immediately after the barley harvest, at the time of the vernal equinox. This was the first day of the ancient month of Nisan, equivalent to today&#x27;s date of March 20 or 21.

The Processional Way, which has been traced to a length of over 800 meters, extended north from the Ishtar Gate and was designed with brick relief images of lions, the symbol of the goddess Ishtar (also known as Inanna) the war goddess, the dragon of Marduk, the lord of the gods, and the bull of Adad, the storm god. Worshipped as the Mistress of Heaven, Ishtar represented the power of sexual attraction and was thought to be savage and determined. Symbolized by the star and her sacred animal, the lion, she was also the goddess of war and the protector of ruling dynasties and their armies. The idea of protection of the city is further incorporated into this gateway design by the use of crenelated buttresses along both sides to this entrance into the city.

Friezes with sixty ferocious lions representing Ishtar decorated each side of the Processional Way, designed with variations in the color of the fur and the manes. On the east side, they had a left foot forward, and on the west side, they had the right foot forward. Each lion was made of forty-six molded bricks in eleven rows. The lion is pictured upon a blue enameled tile background and an orange coloured border that runs along the very bottom portion of the wall. Having a white body and yellow mane, the lion of Ishtar was an embodiment of vivid naturalism that further enhanced the glory of Babylon&#x27;s Procession Street.

The purpose of the New Year&#x27;s holiday was to affirm the supremacy of Marduk and his representative on Earth, the king, and to offer thanks for the fertility of the land.

The Processional Way was paved with large stone pieces set in a bed of bitumen and was up to wide at some points. This street ran from the Euphrates through the temple district and palaces and onto the Ishtar Gate.

== Inscription of Nebuchadnezzar II ==
The inscription of the Ishtar Gate is written in Akkadian cuneiform in white and blue glazed bricks and was a dedication by Nebuchadnezzar to explain the gate&#x27;s purpose. On the wall of the Ishtar Gate, the inscription is 15 meters tall by 10 meters wide and includes 60 lines of writing. The inscription was created around the same time as the gate&#x27;s construction, around 605–562 BC.

Inscription:

Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, the pious prince appointed by the will of Marduk, the highest priestly prince, beloved of Nabu, of prudent deliberation, who has learnt to embrace wisdom, who fathomed Their (Marduk and Nabu) godly being and pays reverence to their Majesty, the untiring Governor, who always has at heart the care of the cult of Esagila and Ezida and is constantly concerned with the well being of Babylon and Borsippa, the wise, the humble, the caretaker of Esagila and Ezida, the first born son of Nabopolassar, the King of Babylon, am I.&quot;
Both gate entrances of the (city walls) Imgur-Ellil and Nemetti-Ellil following the filling of the street from Babylon had become increasingly lower. (Therefore,) I pulled down these gates and laid their foundations at the water table with asphalt and bricks and had them made of bricks with blue stone on which wonderful bulls and dragons were depicted. I covered their roofs by laying majestic cedars lengthwise over them. I fixed doors of cedar wood adorned with bronze at all the gate openings. I placed wild bulls and ferocious dragons in the gateways and thus adorned them with luxurious splendor so that Mankind might gaze on them in wonder.

I let the temple of Esiskursiskur, the highest festival house of Marduk, the lord of the gods, a place of joy and jubilation for the major and minor deities, be built firm like a mountain in the precinct of Babylon of asphalt and fired bricks.

==Excavation and display==

A reconstruction of the Ishtar Gate and Processional Way was built at the Pergamon Museum in Berlin out of material excavated by Robert Koldewey. It includes the inscription plaque. It stands high and wide. The excavation ran from 1902 to 1914, and, during that time, of the foundation of the gate was uncovered.

Claudius Rich, British resident of Baghdad and a self-taught historian, did personal research on Babylon because it intrigued him. Acting as a scholar and collecting field data, he was determined to discover the wonders to the ancient world. C. J. Rich&#x27;s topographical records of the ruins in Babylon were the first ever published, in 1815. It was reprinted in England no fewer than three times. C. J. Rich and most other 19th-century visitors thought a mound in Babylon was a royal palace, and that was eventually confirmed by Robert Koldewey&#x27;s excavations, who found two palaces of King Nebuchadnezzar and the Ishtar Gate. Robert Koldewey, a successful German excavator, had done previous work for the Royal Museum of Berlin, with his excavations at Surghul (Ancient Nina) and Al-hiba (ancient Lagash) in 1887. Koldewey&#x27;s part in Babylon&#x27;s excavation began in 1899.

The method that the British were comfortable with was excavating tunnels and deep trenches, which was damaging the mud brick architecture of the foundation. Instead, it was suggested that the excavation team focus on tablets and other artefacts rather than pick at the crumbling buildings. Despite the destructive nature of the archaeology used, the recording of data was immensely more thorough than in previous Mesopotamian excavations. Walter Andrae, one of Koldewey&#x27;s many assistants, was an architect and a draftsman, the first at Babylon. His contribution was documentation and reconstruction of Babylon, and then later, the smuggling of the remains out of Iraq and into Germany. A small museum was built at the site, and Andrae was the museum&#x27;s first director.

As the German Oriental Society had provided such large funding for the project, the German archeologists involved felt that they needed to justify the cost by smuggling much of the material back to Germany. For example, of the 120 lion friezes along the Procession Street, the Germans took 118. Walter Andrae played a key role in this endeavor using the strong links (or wasta) that he had cultivated with German intelligence officers and with local Iraqi tribal sheikhs. The Gate&#x27;s ceramic pieces were disassembled according to a complex numbering system and were then packed in straw in coal barrels in order to disguise them. These barrels were then transported down the Euphrates River to Shatt al-Arab, where they were loaded onto German ships and taken to Berlin.

The rebuilding of Babylon&#x27;s Ishtar Gate and Processional Way in Berlin was one of the most complex architectural reconstructions in the history of archaeology. Hundreds of crates of glazed brick fragments were carefully desalinated and then pieced together. Fragments were combined with new bricks fired in a specially designed kiln to re-create the correct color and finish. It was a double gate; the part that is shown in the Pergamon Museum today is the smaller, frontal part. The larger, back part was considered too large to fit into the constraints of the structure of the museum; it is in storage.

Parts of the gate and animals from the Processional Way are in various other museums around the world. Only four museums acquired dragons, while lions went to several museums. The Istanbul Archaeology Museum has lions, dragons, and bulls. Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen, Denmark, has one lion, one dragon and one bull. The Detroit Institute of Arts houses a dragon. The Röhsska Museum in Gothenburg, Sweden, has one dragon and one lion; the Louvre, the State Museum of Egyptian Art in Munich, the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Oriental Institute in Chicago, the Rhode Island School of Design Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut, each have lions.

A smaller reproduction of the gate was built in Iraq under Saddam Hussein as the entrance to a museum that has not been completed. Along with the restored palace, the gate was completed in 1987. The construction was meant to emulate the techniques that were used for the original gate. The replica appears similar to the restored original but is notably smaller. The purpose of the replica&#x27;s construction was an attempt to reconnect to Iraq&#x27;s history. Damage to this reproduction has occurred since the Iraq War (see Impact of the U.S. military).

== Controversy and attempted repatriation ==
The acquisition of the Ishtar Gate by the Pergamon Museum is surrounded in controversy as the gate was excavated as part of the excavation of Babylon, and immediately shipped off to Berlin where it remains to this day. The government of Iraq has petitioned the German government to return the gate many times, notably in 2002 as well as in 2009. The Ishtar Gate is frequently used as a prime example in the debate regarding repatriating artifacts of cultural significance to countries affected by war and whether these pieces of material culture are better off in a safer environment where they could be preserved. The example in the case of the Ishtar Gate is concerning its safety in the aftermath of the Iraq War, and whether or not the gate would be safer remaining at the Pergamon Museum where it was damaged by bombs in World War II.

<text>Ernst Wilhelm Leberecht Tempel (4 December 1821 – 16 March 1889), normally known as Wilhelm Tempel, was a German astronomer who worked in Marseille until the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, then later moved to Italy.

Tempel was born at Niedercunnersdorf, Saxony. He was a prolific discoverer of comets, discovering or co-discovering 21 in all, including Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle, now known to be the parent body of the Leonid meteor shower, and 9P/Tempel, the target of the NASA probe &quot;Deep Impact&quot; in 2005. Other periodic comets that bear his name include 10P/Tempel and 11P/Tempel-Swift-LINEAR.

In 1861, he was awarded the Lalande Prize. He won the Prix Valz for the year 1880. The main-belt asteroid 3808 Tempel and the lunar crater &quot;Tempel&quot; are named after him.

<text>A permanent private hall (PPH) in the University of Oxford is an educational institution within the University. There are four permanent private halls at Oxford, three of which admit undergraduates. They were founded by different Christian denominations

Students at PPHs are members of the University of Oxford and have full access to the University&#x27;s facilities and activities.

==Overview==
Regent&#x27;s Park College is the largest PPH and is, to all intents and purposes, a small college specialising in the Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences with a total student body of c.200. Regent&#x27;s also trains Baptist ministerial students. Since 1919, Regent&#x27;s has admitted both men and women. Blackfriars Hall, and Wycliffe Hall were all male-only institutions historically, but both are now co-educational, training ordinands for their respective denominations, and also admitting students for a range of other courses of study. Campion Hall admits graduate students in Humanities and Social Science subjects, and occasionally in other disciplines.

==History==
===Private halls===

The Oxford University Act 1854 and the university statute &quot;De aulis privatis&quot; (On private Halls) of 1855, allowed any Master of Arts aged at least 28 years to open a private hall after obtaining a licence to do so. The longest lived of the thirteen private halls was Charsley&#x27;s Hall (1862–1891). Notable masters of private halls included William Edward Addis and George Butler.

The Universities Tests Act 1871 opened all university degrees and positions to men who were not members of the Church of England (subject to safeguards for religious instruction and worship), which made it possible for Roman Catholics and Nonconformists to open private halls. These non-Anglican private halls included Clarke&#x27;s Hall (now Campion Hall), opened by the Jesuit Order in 1896, and Hunter Blair&#x27;s Hall (later St Benet&#x27;s Hall) opened by the Benedictine Order in 1899.

===Permanent private halls===
In 1918 the university passed a statute to allow private halls which were not run for profit to become permanent private halls and the two halls took new names.

In some cases, a PPH can be granted full collegiate status; recent examples include St Peter&#x27;s College (became a full college in 1961), Mansfield College (became a full college in 1995) and Harris Manchester College (became a full college in 1996).

Greyfriars (1224; refounded 1910) closed in 2008. St Benet&#x27;s Hall closed in 2022. Students from both Greyfriars and St Benets Hall were subsumed into Regent&#x27;s Park College when their respective Hall closed. St Stephen&#x27;s House became a permanent private hall in 2003, and ceased to be one in September 2023, but continued to be an Anglican theological college.

This is one of many engineering colleges in the Guntur region, but it has the distinction of being the first to be managed entirely by the government. AICTE has visited the campus and completed the inspection to award grants and other recognition purposes to assess if it meets the minimum criteria.

===Ranking===
The College of Pharmaceutical Sciences was ranked 63 by National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) pharmacy ranking 2024.

<doc id="582844" wikidata="Q539719" url="?curid=582844" title="VGA connector">
<text>The [[Video Graphics Array]] (VGA) connector is a standard connector used for computer video output. Originating with the 1987 IBM PS/2 and its VGA graphics system, the 15-pin connector went on to become ubiquitous on PCs, as well as many monitors, projectors and HD television sets.

Other connectors have been used to carry VGA-compatible signals, such as mini-VGA or BNC, but &quot;VGA connector&quot; typically refers to this design.

Devices continue to be manufactured with VGA connectors, although newer digital interfaces such as DVI, HDMI and DisplayPort are increasingly displacing VGA, and many modern computers and other devices do not include it.

== Physical design ==
The VGA connector is a three-row, 15-pin D-subminiature connector referred to variously as DE-15, HD-15 or commonly DB-15(HD). DE-15 is the accurate nomenclature under the proprietary D-sub specifications: an &quot;E&quot; size D-sub connector, with 15 pins in three rows.

=== Predecessor and early variant ===
The standard 15-pin VGA connector was derived from the earlier DE-9 connector, which used the same &quot;E&quot; D-shell size (hence that connector&#x27;s misnomer of DB-9 transferred its &quot;DB&quot; part to the new DE-15 connector as well, see above). Though IBM always used DE-15 connectors for their Video Graphics Array hardware, several VGA clone hardware makers initially did not. Instead, some early VGA hardware, both monitors and VGA cards, used a DE-9 connector for VGA, just like what had been in use for MDA, CGA, Hercules, and EGA. This 9-pin variant of the then-emerging de-facto standard 15-pin connector omitted several pins, which was considered acceptable, because the autodetection features supported by those pins only evolved over time, and prior to Windows 95, there was no user expectation of graphics cards and displays being fully plug and play. DE-9 VGA connectors were generally compatible with each other, and adaptors to the DE-15 standard were available. Ultimately all VGA hardware makers switched to standard DE-15 connectors, relegating the early variant to relative obscurity.

== Electrical design ==
All VGA connectors carry analog RGBHV (red, green, blue, horizontal sync, vertical sync) video signals. Modern connectors also include VESA DDC pins, for identifying attached display devices.

In both its modern and original variants, VGA utilizes multiple scan rates, so attached devices such as monitors are multisync by necessity.

The VGA interface includes no affordances for hot swapping, the ability to connect or disconnect the output device during operation, although in practice this can be done and usually does not cause damage to the hardware or other problems. The VESA DDC specification does, however, include a standard for hot-swapping.

=== PS/2 signaling ===
In the original IBM VGA implementation, refresh rates were limited to two vertical (60 and 70 Hz) frequencies, all of which were communicated to the monitor using combinations of different polarity H and V sync signals.&lt;ref name=&quot;IBM PS/2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Some pins on the connector were also different: pin 9 was keyed by plugging the female connector hole, and four pins carried the monitor ID.

With the implementation of the VESA DDC specification, several of the monitor ID pins were reassigned for use by DDC signaling, and the key pin was replaced with a +5 V DC output per the DDC spec. Devices that comply with the DDC host system standard provide , from 50mA to 1A.

=== PS/55 signaling ===
The IBM PS/55 Display Adapter redefined pin 9 as &quot;+12V&quot;, which signals the monitor to turn on when the system unit is powered on.

=== EDID ===

In order to advertise display capabilities VESA has introduced a scheme to redefining VGA connector pins 9, 12, and 15 as a serial bus for a Display Data Channel (DDC).

==Cable quality== 

The same VGA cable can be used with a variety of supported VGA resolutions, ranging from 320×400px @70 Hz, or 320×480px @60 Hz (12.6 MHz of signal bandwidth) to 1280×1024px (SXGA) @85 Hz (160 MHz) and up to 2048×1536px (QXGA) @85 Hz (388 MHz).

There are no standards defining the quality required for each resolution, but higher-quality cables typically contain coaxial wiring and insulation that make them thicker.

While shorter VGA cables are less likely to introduce significant signal degradation, good-quality cable should not suffer from signal crosstalk (whereby signals in one wire induce unwanted currents in adjacent wires) even at greater lengths.

Ghosting occurs when impedance mismatches cause signals to be reflected. A correctly impedance matched cable (75ohm) should prevent this, however, ghosting with long cables may be caused by equipment with incorrect signal termination or by passive cable splitters rather than the cables themselves.

==Alternative connectors==
Some high-end monitors and video cards used multiple BNC connectors instead of a single standard VGA connector, providing a higher quality connection with less crosstalk by utilising five separate 75 ohm coaxial cables. The use of BNC RGB video cables predates VGA in other markets and industries.

Within a 15-pin connector, the red, green, and blue signals (pins 1, 2, 3) cannot be shielded from each other, so crosstalk is possible within the 15-pin interconnect. BNC prevents crosstalk by maintaining full coaxial shielding through the circular connectors, but the connectors are very large and bulky. The requirement to press and turn the plug shell to disconnect requires access space around each connector to allow grasping of each BNC plug shell. Supplementary signals such as DDC are typically not supported with BNC.

Some laptops and other portable devices in the early to mid-2000s contained a two-row mini-VGA connector that is much smaller than the three-row DE-15 connector, as well as five separate BNC connectors.

== Adapters ==

Various adapters can be purchased to convert VGA to other connector types. One common variety is a DVI to VGA adapter, which is possible because many DVI interfaces also carry VGA-compatible analog signals. Adapting from HDMI or DisplayPort to VGA without an active converter is not possible because those connectors don&#x27;t output analog signals.

For conversions to and from digital formats like HDMI or Displayport, a scan converter is required. VGA outputs to interfaces with different signaling, more complex converters may be used. Most of them need an external power source to operate and are inherently lossy. However, many modern displays are still made with multiple inputs including VGA, in which case adapters are not necessary.

VGA can also be adapted to SCART in some cases, because the signals are electrically compatible if the correct sync rates are set by the host PC. Many modern graphics adapters can modify their signal in software, including refresh rate, sync length, polarity and number of blank lines. Particular issues include interlace support and the use of the resolution 720×576 in PAL countries. Under these restrictive conditions, a simple circuit to combine the VGA separate synchronization signals into SCART composite sync may suffice.

==Extenders==
A VGA extender is an electronic device that increases the signal strength from a VGA port, most often from a computer. They are often used in schools, businesses, and homes when multiple monitors are being run off one VGA port, or if the cable between the monitor and the computer will be excessively long (often pictures appear blurry or have minor artifacts if the cable runs too far without an extender). VGA extenders are sometimes called VGA boosters.

<text>Pietro Cascella (February 2, 1921 – May 18, 2008) was an Italian sculptor. His principal work consisted of 
large monumental sculptures, including the &quot;International Monument to the Victims of Fascism&quot; in the Auschwitz II-Birkenau death camp in Poland (1957–1967), and an underground mausoleum for Silvio Berlusconi at his villa in Arcore in the 1980s.

== Life ==
Cascella was born into a family of artists in Pescara on February 2, 1921. His father was Tommaso Cascella, a painter and ceramicist, and his mother was Susanna Federman. His elder brother was a sculptor. Two of his uncles were also artists, the painter Michele Cascella and painter and ceramicist Gioacchino Cascella, as was his grandfather, the painter, ceramicist, and lithographer Basilio Cascella. In 1945 he married Anna Maria Cesarini Sforza, an artist. From 1977 he lived with his second wife, , in the mediaeval in the comune of Fivizzano, above Carrara. He died in Pietrasanta in 2008.

== Work ==

In the late 1930s he moved to Rome and studied at the Accademia di Belle Arti under Ferruccio Ferrazzi, who taught both painting and sculpture. He had work in the Quadriennale di Roma painting exhibition of 1943, and in the twenty-fourth Biennale di Venezia in 1948. He also participated in the twenty-eighth Biennale in 1956.

In the years after the Second World War Cascella, with his brother Andrea and various friends, worked in ceramics and mosaic in a brick-works in the , the brick-making district of Rome. In about 1949 he and his wife Cesarini Sforza were commissioned to create mosaics for the third-class waiting-room of the Stazione Termini, the principal railway station of Rome. In 1950, the two completed a large mosaic for a Roman cinema, the Cinema America. At about this time he also made small-scale reliefs in various materials, some of them drawing inspiration from the work of Roberto Matta, who was a friend.

In 1950–1953 some ceramic work was included in the large American exhibition &quot;Italy at Work: Her Renaissance in Design Today&quot;.

In 1962 his work was included in an exhibition of ceramics at the Galleria dell’Obelisco in Rome. He had a solo show at the Galleria del Milione in Milan in the same year, and another at the Galería Bonino in New York. In the following year, and again in 1972, he had a room at the Biennale. In 1968 his work was shown at the Galèrie du Dragon in Paris and at the Musée d&#x27;Ixelles in Brussels. In 1971 Cascella participated in the twenty-third in Paris.

In April 2006 he received the Italian Medal of Merit for Culture and Art.

<doc id="582848" wikidata="Q380846" url="?curid=582848" title="Kaneto Shindo">
<text>was a Japanese film director, screenwriter, film producer, and writer, who directed 48 films and wrote scripts for 238. His best known films as a director include &quot;Children of Hiroshima&quot;, &quot;The Naked Island&quot;, &quot;Onibaba&quot;, &quot;Kuroneko&quot; and &quot;A Last Note&quot;. His screenplays were filmed by directors such as Kenji Mizoguchi, Kōzaburō Yoshimura, Kon Ichikawa, Keisuke Kinoshita, Seijun Suzuki, and Tadashi Imai.

His films of the first decade were often in a social realist vein, repeatedly depicting the fate of women, while since the seventies, portraits of artists became a speciality. Many of his films were autobiographical, beginning with his 1951 directorial debut, &quot;Story of a Beloved Wife&quot;, and, being born in Hiroshima Prefecture, he also made several films about the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and the effect of nuclear weapons.

Shindō was one of the pioneers of independent film production in Japan, co-founding his own film company Kindai Eiga Kyōkai with director Yoshimura and actor Taiji Tonoyama in 1950. He continued working as a screenwriter, director, and author until close to his death at the age of 100.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Shindō was born in 1912 in the Saeki District of Hiroshima Prefecture as the youngest of four children. His family were wealthy landowners, but his father went bankrupt and lost all his land after acting as a loan guarantor. His older brother and two sisters went to find work, and he and his mother and father lived in a storehouse. His mother became an agricultural labourer and died during his early childhood. His older brother was good at judo and became a policeman. One of his sisters became a nurse and would go on to work caring for atom bomb victims. The other sister married a Japanese-American and went to live in the US.

In 1933, Shindō, then living with his brother in Onomichi, was inspired by Sadao Yamanaka&#x27;s film &quot;Bangaku No isshō&quot; to want to start a career in films. He saved money by working in a bicycle shop and in 1934, with a letter of introduction from his brother to a policeman in Kyoto, he set off for Kyoto. After a long wait, he was able to get a job in the film developing department of Shinkō Kinema, which he joined because he was too short to join the lighting department. He was one of eleven workers in the developing department, but only three of them actually worked, the others being members of the company baseball team. At this time he learned that films were based on scripts because old scripts were used as toilet paper. He would take the scripts home to study them. His job involved drying 200-foot lengths of film on a roller three metres long and two metres high, and he learned the relationship between the pieces of film he was drying and the scripts he read.

When Shinkō Kinema moved from Kyoto to Tokyo in November 1935, many of the staff, who were Kyoto locals, did not want to move. The brother of the policeman who had helped Shindō get the job in Shinkō Kinema was one of them. He asked Shindō to take his place, and Shindō got a job in Shinko Kinema&#x27;s art department run by Hiroshi Mizutani. For his work as an art director, Shindō trained under a local artist. He had a talent for sketching which he used in scouting locations, since cameras were less often used in those days. Shindō discovered that a lot of people wanted to become film directors, including Mizutani, and he decided that he might have a better chance of success as a screenwriter.

===Screenwriter years===
Shindō wrote a lot of film scripts, which were severely criticized by his friends, but he persisted. He submitted a script called &quot;Tsuchi o ushinatta hyakushō&quot;, about a farmer who loses his land due to the construction of a dam, to a film magazine and won a prize of 100 yen, four times his then monthly salary of 25 yen. However, the script was never filmed.

By the late 1930s he was working as an assistant to Kenji Mizoguchi on several films, most notably as chief assistant director and art director on &quot;The 47 Ronin&quot;. He submitted scripts to Mizoguchi, only for Mizoguchi to tell him that he &quot;had no talent&quot; for screenwriting, events dramatized years later in Shindō&#x27;s debut film &quot;Story of a Beloved Wife&quot;. His first realised screenplay was for the film &quot;Nanshin josei&quot; in 1940. He was asked to write a script by director Tomu Uchida, but the script was never filmed due to Uchida&#x27;s untimely military conscription.

In 1942, he joined a Shochiku subsidiary, the Koa Film company under the tutelage of Kenji Mizoguchi. In 1943 he transferred to the Shochiku studio. Later that year, his common-law wife Takako Kuji died of tuberculosis. In April 1944, despite being graded class C in the military physical exam, he was drafted into the navy. The group of 100 men he was serving with were initially assigned to clean buildings. Sixty of the men were selected by lottery to serve on a ship and then died in a submarine attack. Thirty more men were selected by lottery to serve on a submarine and were not heard from again. Four men were selected by lottery to be machine-gunners on freight ships converted to military use, and died in submarine attacks. The remaining six men cleaned the Takarazuka theatre which was then being used by the military, then sent to a camp where they were insulted and beaten.

At the surrender of Japan, Shindō exchanged his uniform for cigarettes and made his way back to the Shochiku film studio at Ōfuna. The studio was deserted, and Shindō spent his time in the script department reading the surviving scripts.

In 1946, with a secure job as a scriptwriter at Shochiku, he married Miyo Shindō via an arranged marriage, and bought a house in Zushi, intending to start a family. At Shochiku, Shindō met director Kōzaburō Yoshimura. According to film historian Donald Richie, this started &quot;one of the most successful film partnerships in the postwar industry, Shindō playing Dudley Nichols to Yoshimura&#x27;s John Ford.&quot; The duo scored a critical hit with &quot;A Ball at the Anjo House&quot; in 1947. Shindō wrote scripts for almost all of the Shochiku directors except Yasujirō Ozu.

Shindō and Yoshimura were both unhappy at Shochiku, which viewed the two as having a &quot;dark outlook&quot; on life. In 1950 they both left to form an independent production company with actor Taiji Tonoyama, Kindai Eiga Kyokai, which went on to produce most of Shindō&#x27;s films.

===Early career as a film director===
In 1951, Shindō made his debut as a director with the autobiographical &quot;Story of a Beloved Wife&quot;, starring Nobuko Otowa in the role of his deceased common-law wife Takako Kuji. Otowa became Shindō&#x27;s mistress (he was married to his second wife at the time), and would go on to play leading roles in almost all of his films during her life. After directing &quot;Avalanche&quot; in 1952, Shindō was invited by the Japan Teachers Union to make a film about the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. &quot;Children of Hiroshima&quot; stars Nobuko Otowa as a young teacher who returns to Hiroshima to visit her family&#x27;s grave and find surviving former students and colleagues. It premiered at the 1953 Cannes Film Festival, being the first Japanese film to deal with the subject of the atomic bomb, which had been forbidden under postwar American censorship. Children of Hiroshima met with acclaim, but also with criticism for its sentimentality and, according to the producing Japan Teachers Union, for not being political enough.

After this international success, Shindō made &quot;Epitome&quot; in 1953. Nobuko Otowa is Ginko, a poor girl who must become a geisha in order to support her family, and cannot marry the rich client whom she falls in love with because of his family honor. Film critic Tadao Sato said, Shindō had &quot;inherited from his mentor Mizoguchi his central theme of worship of womanhood...Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that Shindō&#x27;s view of women blossomed under his master&#x27;s encouragement, but once in bloom revealed itself to be of a different hue...Shindō differs from Mizoguchi by idealizing the intimidating capacity of Japanese women for sustained work, and contrasting them with shamefully lazy men.&quot;

Between 1953 and 1959 Shindō continued to make political films that were social critiques of poverty and women&#x27;s suffering in present-day Japan. These included &quot;Life of a Woman&quot;, an adaptation of Maupassant&#x27;s &quot;Une Vie&quot; in 1953, and &quot;Dobu&quot;, a 1954 film about the struggles of unskilled workers and petty thieves that starred Otowa as a tragic prostitute. &quot;Wolf&quot; (1955), based on an actual event of a money transport robbed by a group of men and women out of sheer desperation, failed due to its extremely limited release. Still, actor Tonoyama later called his role in &quot;Wolf&quot; his favourite of all of the director&#x27;s films. In 1959 Shindō made &quot;Lucky Dragon No. 5&quot;, the true story of a fishing crew irradiated by an atomic bomb test at Bikini Atoll. The film received the Peace Prize at a Czech film festival, but was not a success with either critics or audiences.

By this time Shindō had formed an established &quot;stock company&quot; of actors and crew that he would work with for the majority of his career. These included actors Nobuko Otowa, Taiji Tonoyama and Jūkichi Uno, composer Hikaru Hayashi and cinematographer Kiyomi Kuroda, who had been fired from the Toei studio for his political beliefs during the &quot;red purge&quot; of the early 1950s, and lost a legal battle for reinstatement.

===International success===
With Kindai Eiga Kyokai close to bankruptcy, Shindō poured what little financial resources he had left into &quot;The Naked Island&quot;, a film without dialogue which he described as &quot;a cinematic poem to try and capture the life of human beings struggling like ants against the forces of nature.&quot; Nobuko Otowa and Taiji Tonoyama are a couple living on a small island with their two young sons and no water supply. Every day they boat to another island to retrieve fresh water to drink and irrigate their crops. The film saved Shindō&#x27;s company when it was awarded the Grand Prize at the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival in 1961. Shindō made his first ever trip abroad to attend the Moscow film festival, and he was able to sell the film in sixty-one countries.

After making two more films of social relevance (&quot;Ningen&quot; in 1962 and &quot;Mother&quot; in 1963), Shindō shifted his focus as a filmmaker to the individuality of a person, specifically a person&#x27;s sexual nature. He explained: &quot;Political things such as class consciousness or class struggle or other aspects of social existence really come down to the problem of man alone [...]. I have discovered the powerful, very fundamental force in man which sustains his survival and which can be called sexual energy [...]. My idea of sex is nothing but the expression of the vitality of man, his urge for survival.&quot; From these new ideas came &quot;Onibaba&quot; in 1964.

&quot;Onibaba&quot; stars Nobuko Otowa and Jitsuko Yoshimura as 14th-century Japanese peasant women living in a reed-filled marshland who survive by killing and robbing defeated samurai. The film won numerous awards and the Grand Prix at the Panama Film Festival, and Best Supporting Actress (Jitsuko Yoshimura) and Best Cinematography (Kiyomi Kuroda) at the Blue Ribbon Awards in 1964.

After the 1965 jidaigeki drama &quot;Akuto&quot;, based on a play by Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki, Shindō continued his exploration of human sexuality with &quot;Lost Sex&quot; in 1966. In &quot;Lost Sex&quot;, a middle aged man who has become temporarily impotent after the Hiroshima bombing in 1945, once again loses his virility due to nuclear tests in the Bikini Atoll. In the end, he is cured by his housekeeper. Impotence was again the theme of Shindō&#x27;s next film, &quot;Libido&quot;, released in 1967. Gender politics and strong female characters played a strong role in both of these films. Tadao Sato said &quot;By contrasting the comical weakness of the male with the unbridled strength of the female, Shindō seemed to be saying in the 1960s that women had wrought their revenge. This could have been a reflection of postwar society, since it is commonly said in Japan women have become stronger because men have lost all confidence in their masculinity due to Japan&#x27;s defeat.&quot;

In 1968 Shindō made &quot;Kuroneko&quot;, a horror period film reminiscent of &quot;Onibaba&quot;. The film centers around a vengeful mother and daughter-in-law pair played by Nobuko Otowa and Kiwako Taichi. After being raped and left to die in their burning hut by a group of soldiers, the pair return as demons who entice samurai into a bamboo grove, where they are killed. The film won the Mainichi Film Awards for Best Actress (Otowa) and Best Cinematography (Kiyomi Kuroda) in 1968.

Shindō also made the comedy &quot;Strong Women, Weak Men&quot; in 1968. A mother and her teenage daughter leave their impoverished coal-mining town to become cabaret hostesses in Kyoto. They quickly acquire enough cynical street smarts to get as much money out of their predatory johns as they can. Shindō said of the film, &quot;common people never appear in the pages of history. Silently they live, eat and die [...]. I wanted to depict their bright, healthy, open vitality with a sprinkling of comedy.&quot;

In the crime drama &quot;Heat Wave Island&quot;, released in 1969, Otowa is an Inland Sea island farmer who moves to the mainland and later dies under mysterious circumstances. &quot;Live Today, Die Tomorrow!&quot; (1970) was based on the true story of spree killer Norio Nagayama, dramatizing not only his crimes but the poverty and cruelty of his upbringing. The film won the Golden Prize at the 7th Moscow International Film Festival in 1971.

Around this time, at the age of sixty, his second wife Miyo divorced him over his continuing relationship with Otowa.

===Later career===
From 1972 to 1981, Shindō served as chair of the Writers Guild of Japan. Also in 1972, he directed &quot;Sanka&quot; about a shamisen player and her submissive apprentice, his second adaptation of a literary source by Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki after &quot;Akuto&quot;.

Shindō&#x27;s 1974 film &quot;My Way&quot; was a throwback to films of his early career and an exposure of the Japanese government&#x27;s mistreatment of the country&#x27;s migratory workers. Based on a true story, an elderly woman resiliently spends nine months attempting to retrieve her husband&#x27;s dead body, fighting government bureaucracy and indifference all along the way.

In 1975, Shindō made &quot;Kenji Mizoguchi: The Life of a Film Director&quot;, a documentary about his mentor who had died in 1956. The film uses film clips, footage of the hospital where the director spent his last days and interviews with actors, technicians and friends to paint a portrait of the director. Shindō also wrote a book on Mizoguchi, published in 1976.

In 1977 &quot;The Life of Chikuzan&quot; was released, about the life of blind shamisen player Takahashi Chikuzan. It was entered into the 10th Moscow International Film Festival. That same year, Shindō travelled to America to film a television documentary, &quot;Document 8.6&quot;, about the Hiroshima atomic bomb. He met Paul Tibbets, the pilot of the plane which dropped the bomb, but was not able to interview him on film. The documentary was broadcast in 1978.

In 1978, after the death of his ex-wife, he married Nobuko Otowa.

The domestic drama &quot;The Strangling&quot; was shown at the 1979 Venice Film Festival, where Nobuko Otowa won the award for Best Actress. &quot;Edo Porn&quot;, another film based on an artist&#x27;s biography released in 1981, portrayed the life of the 18th-century Japanese wood engraver Katsushika Hokusai.

In 1984 Shindō made &quot;The Horizon&quot;, based on the life of his sister. The film chronicles her experiences as a poor farm girl who is sold as a mail-order bride to a Japanese American and never sees her family again. She spends time in an internment camp for Japanese Americans during World War II and lives a life of difficulty and disappointment.

With the 1988 semi-documentary &quot;Sakura-tai Chiru&quot;, Shindō once again returned to the theme of nuclear weapons and their consequences, following the fate of a theater troupe whose members were killed during the bombing of Hiroshima.

According to his son Jiro, Shindō gave up his hobbies of Mahjong, Shogi, and baseball at the age of eighty to concentrate on film-making. Jiro was the producer of many of his films since the mid-1980s. Kaze Shindō, Jiro&#x27;s daughter and Shindō&#x27;s granddaughter, later followed in Shindō&#x27;s footsteps as a film director and scriptwriter.

During production of Shindō&#x27;s film &quot;A Last Note&quot;, Nobuko Otowa was diagnosed with liver cancer. She died in December 1994, prior to the film&#x27;s 1995 release. &quot;A Last Note&quot; won numerous awards, including Best Film awards at the Blue Ribbon Awards, Hochi Film Awards, Japan Academy Prizes, Kinema Junpo Awards and Mainichi Film Awards, as well as awards for Best Director at the Japanese Academy, Nikkan Sports Film Awards, Kinema Junpo Awards and Mainichi Film Award.

===Final films and death===
After Otowa&#x27;s death, her role as lead actress in Shindō&#x27;s films was taken over by Shinobu Otake, who would star in four of his films. In &quot;Will to Live&quot; (1999), a black comedy on the problems of ageing, Otake played a daughter with bipolar disorder of an elderly father who has fecal incontinence, played by Rentarō Mikuni.

In 2000, at the age of 88, Shindō filmed &quot;By Player&quot;, a biography of actor and long-time associate Taiji Tonoyama, incorporating aspects of the history of Shindō&#x27;s film company, Kindai Eiga Kyokai, and using footage of Otowa shot in 1994.

The 2003 &quot;Owl&quot;, again starring Otake, used as a background the true story of farmers sent back from Japanese colonies in Manchuria to unworkable farmland at the end of the Second World War. The entire film was shot on a single set, partly because of Shindō&#x27;s mobility problems. It was entered into the 25th Moscow International Film Festival, where Shindō won a special award for his contribution to world cinema.

In 2010, Shindō directed &quot;Postcard&quot;, a story of middle-aged men drafted for military service at the end of the second world war loosely based on Shindō&#x27;s own experiences. &quot;Postcard&quot; was selected as the Japanese submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but did not make the January shortlist. Due to failing health, Shindō announced that it would be his last film at its premiere at the Tokyo International Film Festival.

For the last forty years of his life, Shindō lived in a small apartment in Akasaka. After the death of Nobuko Otowa, he lived alone. Although he had been able to walk all over Tokyo in his eighties, he lost mobility in his legs in his nineties. Because of his need for care, Kaze Shindō moved into his apartment and lived with him for the last six years of his life, acting as his caregiver. Kaze Shindō appears in the credits for Shindō&#x27;s later films credited as &quot;Kantoku kenkō kanri&quot;, &quot;Management of director&#x27;s health&quot;.

From April to May 2012 a committee in the city of Hiroshima presented a tribute to Shindō to commemorate his 100th birthday. This event included screenings of most of his films and special guests such as Shindō himself and longtime admirer Benicio del Toro.

Shindō died of natural causes on 29 May 2012. According to his son Jiro, he was talking in his sleep about new film projects even at the end of his life. He requested that his ashes be scattered on the Sukune island in Mihara where &quot;The Naked Island&quot; was filmed, and where half of Nobuko Otowa&#x27;s ashes were also scattered.

==Style and themes==
Shindō said that he saw film &quot;as an art of &#x27;montage&#x27; which consists of a dialectic or interaction between the movement and the nonmovement of the image.&quot; Although criticized for having little visual style early in his career, he was praised by film critic Joan Mellen who called &quot;Onibaba&quot; &quot;visually exquisite.&quot;

The strongest and most apparent themes in Shindō&#x27;s work (who described himself as a &quot;socialist&quot;) involve social criticism of poverty, women and sexuality. Tadao Sato has pointed out that Shindō&#x27;s political films are both a reflection of his impoverished childhood and the condition of Japan after World War II, stating that, &quot;Contemporary Japan has developed from an agricultural into an industrial country. Many agricultural people moved to cities and threw themselves into new precarious lives. Kaneto Shindo&#x27;s style of camerawork comes from this intention to conquer such uneasiness by depicting the perseverance and persistence of farmers.&quot;

Joan Mellen wrote that &quot;at their best, Shindo&#x27;s films involve a merging of the sexual with the social. His radical perception isolates man&#x27;s sexual life in the context of his role as a member of a specific social class...For Shindo our passions as biological beings and our ambitions as members of social classes, which give specific and distorted form to those drives, induce an endless struggle within the unconscious. Those moments in his films when this warfare is visualized and brought to conscious life raise his work to the level of the highest art.&quot;

==Influences==
In a 1972 interview with Joan Mellen, Shindō named Orson Welles and Sergei Eisenstein as the Western directors he admired the most, calling them &quot;the best&quot;, and Mizoguchi as the most admired director of the older Japanese generation. In the same interview, he confirmed &quot;a strong Freudian influence&quot; throughout all of his work.

When asked by Benicio del Toro what the most important thing he had learned from Kenji Mizoguchi was, Shindō replied that the most important thing he had learned from Mizoguchi was never to give up. According to Shindō, although Mizoguchi made more than eighty films, most of them were boring, with only about five or six good films, but without the failures there would never have been successes like &quot;Ugetsu Monogatari&quot;.

==Legacy==
A retrospective on Shindō and Kōzaburō Yoshimura was held in London in 2012, organised by the British Film Institute and the Japan Foundation.

<text>SS &quot;Great Western&quot; was a wooden-hulled paddle-wheel steamship with four masts, the first steamship purpose-built for crossing the Atlantic, and the initial unit of the Great Western Steamship Company. Completed in 1838, she was the largest passenger ship in the world from 1837 to 1839, the year the went into service.

Designed by British civil engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, &quot;Great Western&quot; proved satisfactory in service and was the model for all successful wooden Atlantic paddle-steamers. She was capable of making record Blue Riband voyages as late as 1843. &quot;Great Western&quot; worked to New York for eight years until her owners went out of business. She was sold to the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company and was scrapped in 1856 after serving as a troopship during the Crimean War.

==Development and design==

In 1836, Isambard Brunel, his friend Thomas Guppy and a group of Bristol investors formed the Great Western Steamship Company to build a line of steamships for the Bristol–New York route. The idea of regular scheduled transatlantic service was under discussion by several groups and the rival British and American Steam Navigation Company was established at the same time. &quot;Great Western&#x27;s&quot; design sparked controversy from critics that contended that she was too big. The principle that Brunel understood was that the carrying capacity of a ship increases as the cube of its dimensions, whilst the water resistance only increases as the square of its dimensions. This meant that large ships were more fuel efficient, something very important for long voyages across the Atlantic.

&quot;Great Western&quot; was an iron-strapped, wooden, side-wheel paddle steamer, with four masts to hoist the auxiliary sails. The sails were not just to provide auxiliary propulsion, but also were used in rough seas to keep the ship on an even keel and ensure that both paddle wheels remained in the water, driving the ship in a straight line. The hull was built of oak (one source says Dantzic pine, presumably meaning Baltic pine from Danzig) by traditional methods. She was the largest steamship for one year, until the British and American&#x27;s &quot;British Queen&quot; went into service. Built at the shipyard of Patterson &amp; Mercer in Bristol, England, &quot;Great Western&quot; was launched on 19 July 1837. During the launch, a shipwright was killed when a large bulk of timber fell on him, fracturing his skull. After her launch, &quot;Great Western&quot; sailed to London, where she was fitted with two side-lever steam engines from the firm of Maudslay, Sons and Field, producing 750 indicated horsepower between them. Towards the end of 1837 Lieutenant James Hosken was appointed commander of the new vessel and in March 1838 the first advertisements of sailings were made.

==Service history==

The first trial of the &quot;Great Western&quot; took place on 24 March 1838, attracting a vast audience with visits by the nobility on the ship&#x27;s return.
On 31 March, &quot;Great Western&quot; sailed for Avonmouth (Bristol) to start her maiden voyage to New York. Before reaching Avonmouth, a fire broke out in the engine room. During the confusion Brunel fell , and was injured. The fire was extinguished, and the damage to the ship was minimal, but Brunel had to be put ashore at Canvey Island. As a result of the accident, more than 50 passengers cancelled their bookings for the Bristol-New York voyage and when &quot;Great Western&quot; finally departed Avonmouth, only seven passengers were aboard.

Construction of the rival British and American&#x27;s first ship was delayed, and the company chartered to beat &quot;Great Western&quot; to New York. &quot;Sirius&quot; was a Irish Sea steam packet on the London – Cork route, and had part of her passenger accommodation removed to make room for extra coal bunkers. She left London three days before &quot;Great Western&quot;, refuelled at Cork, and departed for New York on 4 April. &quot;Great Western&quot; was delayed in Bristol because of the fire and did not depart until 8 April.

Even with a four-day head start, &quot;Sirius&quot; only narrowly beat &quot;Great Western&quot;, arriving on 22 April. When coal ran low, the crew burned five drums of resin. &quot;Great Western&quot; arrived the following day, with 200 tons of coal still aboard. Although the term Blue Riband was not coined until years later, &quot;Sirius&quot; is often credited as the first winner at . However, &quot;Sirius&quot; only held the record for a day because &quot;Great Western&#x27;s&quot; voyage was faster at .

&quot;Great Western&quot; proved completely satisfactory in service and influenced the design of other Atlantic paddlers. Even Cunard&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot; was a reduced version of &quot;Great Western&quot;. During 1838–1840, &quot;Great Western&quot; averaged 16 days, 0 hours (7.95 knots) westward to New York and 13 days, 9 hours (9.55 knots) home. In 1838, the company paid a 9% dividend, but that was to be the firm&#x27;s only dividend because of the expense of building the company&#x27;s next ship. After the collapse of British and American, &quot;Great Western&quot; alternated between Avonmouth and Liverpool, before abandoning Avonmouth entirely in 1843. The ship remained profitable even though she lacked a running mate because of the protracted construction on &quot;Great Britain&quot;. In 1843, &quot;Great Western&#x27;s&quot; receipts were £33,400 against expenditures of £25,600.
The company&#x27;s fortunes improved in 1845 when &quot;Great Britain&quot; entered service. However, in September 1846 &quot;Great Britain&quot; ran ashore because of a navigational error and was not expected to survive the winter. The directors suspended all sailings of &quot;Great Western&quot; and went out of business. &quot;Great Western&quot; had completed 45 crossings for her owners in 8 years. In 1847 she was sold to the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company and used on the West Indies run. Southampton became her new home port from where she made 14 voyages to the West Indies between 1847 and 1853, before being put on the South America run and made another nine voyages to Rio de Janeiro between 1853 and 1855. On the South America run she called at Lisbon, Madeira, Teneriffe, St Vincents, Pernambuco and Bahia on the way to Rio and then in reverse on the return passage.

The &quot;Great Western&quot; was then laid up at Southampton before being taken into government service as &#x27;Transport No. 6&#x27;. She served as a troopship in the Crimean War in 1856, carrying soldiers between the UK, Gibraltar, Malta, and the Crimean Peninsula. In August 1856 she was sold for scrapping and was broken up at Castles&#x27; Yard, Millbank on the Thames.

<text>OpenLP is a worship presentation program licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2. It includes the ability to search through lyrics for certain words, search for Bible verses in the Bible, display lyrics and Bible verses in a friendly way to the and interact with popular presentation programs to provide users with an easy way to control a presentation (with LibreOffice Impress, OpenOffice.org Impress or Microsoft PowerPoint). It also includes easy and instant switching between slides, customisable backgrounds, a song database, and video support.

==History==

OpenLP was registered on SourceForge.net in February 2004 by Tim Ebenezer. The software was first released on 28 February 2004 as version 0.1, and contained the bare basics of the application. Version 0.4, released on 16 March 2004, was the first release with multi monitor support.

On 18 March 2004, the 0.x line of OpenLP officially entered beta status with the release of version 0.5. By version 0.8, OpenLP had implemented most of the desired functionality. Version 0.994 was the last release in the 0.x series of OpenLP, and was released on 11 October 2004.

In mid-2004 Raoul Snyman joined the project, and suggested some architectural changes. With this in mind, Tim Ebenezer decided to drop the 0.x line and rewrite OpenLP from scratch, with a redefined user interface. After various delays, OpenLP 1.0 beta 1 was finally released on 3 October 2005. At this stage, Tim also decided to rename OpenLP to openlp.org.

After the release of beta 1, Tim became too busy to work on openlp.org, and in early 2006 Raoul took over the project. After an extensive beta and release candidate program, openlp.org version 1.0 was released on 1 February 2008.

Initially, Raoul was going to work on a new version of openlp.org, version 1.2, in order to add fix up various faults in the implementation of the software, while a new group of developers would work on OpenLP 2.0, a new cross-platform version of the software. However, after looking at the progress of version 2.0, and consulting the other developers, Raoul decided to cease work on version 1.2.

In the meantime, Derek Scotney joined the project, helping Raoul work on bugfixes for openlp.org 1.0. When Raoul moved on to help develop version 2.0, Derek continued to support version 1.0 with bug fixes. In October 2009 Derek released a new version of openlp.org that he had been working on, one that provided a backing track feature that his church needed.

The OpenLP team released the first alpha version of OpenLP 2.0, OpenLP version 1.9.1, after about 18 months of development. This release was a preview release to show the community what the development team had been working on. It was at this stage that the team renamed OpenLP back to its original name. Since then, there have been releases every 3 months.

After over 2 years of development, the OpenLP team released their first beta of OpenLP 2.0 on 27 March 2011. With the release of this first beta, the OpenLP team announced that there would be no more bug fix releases for openlp.org 1.2, and that the beta release should be stable enough for most churches.

==Current status==

===Version 1.0===
Version 1.0 of openlp.org is no longer maintained. It was superseded by version 1.2.

===Version 1.2===
Version 1.2.9 was the last stable release of the Delphi version of openlp.org. It was available for Microsoft Windows only. It is no longer supported.

===Version 2.0===
Version 2.0 was the first version written in Python and Qt4, allowing it to run on most major operating systems including Linux, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows.

===Version 2.2===
Version 2.2 updated the code base to Python 3 and added support for video playback through VLC and presentation support via Libreoffice versions 4.0 and higher

===Version 2.4===
Version 2.4 upgraded the code base from PyQt4 to PyQt5, in order to use Qt5 and the newer capabilities of Qt5.

===Version 3.0===
Version 3.0 upgraded the code base and various new features.

<doc id="582864" wikidata="Q184569" url="?curid=582864" title="Plagues of Egypt">
<text>In the Book of Exodus, the Plagues of Egypt () are ten disasters that Yahweh inflicts on the Egyptians to convince the Pharaoh to emancipate the enslaved Israelites, each of them confronting the Pharaoh and one of his Egyptian gods; they serve as &quot;signs and marvels&quot; given by Yahweh in response to the Pharaoh&#x27;s taunt that he does not know Yahweh: &quot;The Egyptians shall know that I am the &quot;. These Plagues are recited by Jews during the Passover Seder.

The consensus of modern scholars is that the Torah does not give an accurate account of the origins of the Israelites and that, while a small group of proto-Israelites may have originated from Egypt, it did not happen in the massive way that the Tanakh describes. Some scholars have suggested that the story of the Plagues of Egypt might have been inspired by natural phenomena like epidemics, although these theories are considered uncertain.

== List of the disasters ==
=== The Nile becomes a river of blood===
The Hebrew Bible&#x27;s Book of Exodus says that Aaron turned the Nile to blood by striking it with his staff. Pharaoh&#x27;s magicians used their secret arts to also strike the Nile, creating a second layer of blood. In addition to the Nile, all water that was held in reserve, such as jars, was also transformed into blood. The Egyptians were forced to dig alongside the bank of the Nile, which still had pure water. One week passed before the plague dissipated.

===Frogs emerge from the Nile and infest Egypt===

Exodus states that God ordered frogs to emerge from the Nile, which then jumped around virtually everywhere in Egypt. The magicians attempted to produce frogs from their secret arts, conjuring up a second wave of frogs. Even the private quarters of Pharaoh was infested with frogs. Three days passed before all the frogs died. The Egyptians had to do much work to rid themselves of the corpses, and the land stank of frog for long afterwards. When the decision came for Pharaoh about the slaves, the Pharaoh hardened his heart and decided that the slaves would not be freed.

=== Gnats emerge from the ground and infest Egypt ===

=== Wild animals or flies harm Egyptians and their livestock ===

The fourth plague of Egypt was of creatures capable of harming people and livestock. Exodus states that the plagues only came against the Egyptians and did not affect the Hebrews. Pharaoh asked Moses to remove this plague and promised to grant the Israelites their freedom. However, after the plague was gone, Pharaoh refused to keep his promise, as his heart was hardened by God.

Various sources use either &quot;wild animals&quot; or &quot;flies&quot;.

=== Mass death of Egyptian livestock to pestilence ===

=== Boils infect Egyptians and their livestock ===


=== Thunderstorm and hail ===

=== Locust swarm ===

=== Three days of total darkness ===


=== Death of every Egyptian&#x27;s firstborn son === 

Before this final plague, God commands Moses to tell the Israelites to mark a lamb&#x27;s blood above their doors in order that the Angel of Death will pass over them (i.e., that they will not be touched by the death of the firstborn). Pharaoh orders the Israelites to leave, taking whatever they want, and asks Moses to bless him in the name of the Lord. The passage goes on to state that the passover sacrifice recalls the time when the Lord &quot;passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt&quot;.

== Composition and theology ==

Scholars are in broad agreement that the publication of the Torah took place in the mid-Persian period (the 5th century BCE). The Book of Deuteronomy, composed in stages between the 7th and 6th centuries, mentions the &quot;diseases of Egypt&quot; (Deuteronomy 7:15 and 28:60). John Van Seters contends that this refers to something that afflicted the Israelites, not the Egyptians, and that Deuteronomy never specifies the plagues. Graham Davies, however, questions Van Seters&#x27; interpretation and argues that several verses in the book (e.g. ; ) seem to clearly allude to a plague tradition.

The traditional number of ten plagues is not actually mentioned in Exodus, and other sources differ; Psalms 78 and 105 seem to list only seven or eight plagues and order them differently. It appears that originally there were only seven, to which were added the third, sixth, and ninth, bringing the count to ten.

In this final version, the first nine plagues form three triads, each of which God introduces by informing Moses of the main lesson it will teach. In the first triad, the Egyptians begin to experience the power of God; in the second, God demonstrates that he is directing events; and in the third, the incomparability of Yahweh is displayed. Overall, the plagues are &quot;signs and marvels&quot; given by the God of Israel to answer Pharaoh&#x27;s taunt that he does not know Yahweh: &quot;The Egyptians shall know that I am the &quot;.

== Historicity ==

Secular scholars broadly agree that the Exodus is not a historical account and that, while a small group of proto-Israelites may have originated from Egypt, it did not happen in the massive way the Bible describes. Some scholars also hold that the Israelites originated in Canaan and from the Canaanites, although others disagree. The Ipuwer Papyrus, written no earlier than the late Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt (), has been put forward in popular literature as confirmation of the biblical account, most notably because of its statement that &quot;the river is blood&quot; and its frequent references to servants running away; however, these arguments ignore the many points on which Ipuwer contradicts Exodus, such as Asiatics arriving in Egypt rather than leaving and the fact that the &quot;river is blood&quot; phrase probably refers to the red sediment colouring the Nile during disastrous floods, or is simply a poetic image of turmoil. Attempts to find natural explanations for the plagues (e.g., a volcanic eruption to explain the &quot;darkness&quot; plague) have been dismissed by biblical scholars on the grounds that their pattern, timing, rapid succession, and above all, control by Moses mark them as supernatural.

== Artistic representation ==
===Visual art===

In visual art, the plagues have generally been reserved for works in series, especially engravings. Still, relatively few depictions in art emerged compared to other religious themes until the 19th century, when the plagues became more common subjects, with John Martin and Joseph Turner producing notable canvases. This trend probably reflected a Romantic attraction to landscape and nature painting, for which the plagues were suited, a Gothic attraction to morbid stories, and a rise in Orientalism, wherein exotic Egyptian themes found currency. Given the importance of noble patronage throughout Western art history, the plagues may have found consistent disfavor because the stories emphasize the limits of a monarch&#x27;s power, and images of lice, locusts, darkness, and boils were ill-suited for decoration in palaces and churches.

===Music===
Perhaps the most successful artistic representation of the plagues is Handel&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Israel in Egypt&quot;, which, like his perennial favorite, &quot;Messiah&quot;, takes a libretto entirely from scripture. The work was especially popular in the 19th century because of its numerous choruses, generally one for each plague, and its playful musical depiction of the plagues. For example, the plague of frogs is performed as a light aria for alto, depicting frogs jumping in the violins, and the plague of flies and lice is a light chorus with fast scurrying runs in the violins.

An other representation of the plagues, mainly the 10th plague, is the song &quot;Creeping Death&quot; by American thrash metal band Metallica.

<doc id="582872" wikidata="Q1747217" url="?curid=582872" title="Girnar">
<text>Girnar is an ancient hill in Junagadh, Gujarat, India. It is one of the holiest pilgrimages for Jains, where the 22nd Tirthaṅkara, Lord Neminath attained omniscience, and later nirvana along with other five hundred and thirty three enlightened sages. This is well described in ancient texts such as Kalpa Sūtra written by acharya Bhadrabāhu and Shri Uttaradhyayana Sutra by Arya Sudharmaswami.

==Geology==
Mount Girnar is a major igneous plutonic complex which intruded into the basalts towards the close of the Deccan Trap period. The rock types identified in this complex are gabbros (tholeiitic and alkalic), diorites, lamprophyres, alkali-syenites and rhyolites. The parent gabbroic magma is shown to have given rise in sequence to diorites, lamprophyres and alkali-syenites. The rhyolite, though earlier considered a product of differentiation, is now believed to be an independent magma without any genetic link with the gabbro and its variants.

==History==
Girnar was an important mountain that has been a sacred place for Jains for centuries.

In the 7th century, the Chinese traveler Hsuan-tsang mentioned Girnar as a place of &quot;supernatural rishis,&quot; likely referring to Saivite Pashupata ascetics, as described by his contemporary Bāṇabhaṭṭa. On the southern side of the mountain, there are Jain temples that were built in the 13th century.
=== Ashoka edicts ===
Fourteen of Ashoka&#x27;s Major Rock Edicts, dating to circa 250 BCE, are inscribed on a large boulder that is housed in a small building located outside the town of Junagadh on Saurashtra peninsula in the state of Gujarat, India. It is located on Girnar Taleti road, at about far from Uperkot Fort easterly, some 2 km before Girnar Taleti. An uneven rock, with a circumference of seven meters and a height of ten meters, bears inscriptions etched with an iron pen in Brahmi script in a language similar to Pali and date back to 250 BCE, thus marking the beginning of written history of Junagadh.

On the same rock there are inscriptions in Sanskrit added around 150 CE by Mahakshatrap Rudradaman I, the Saka (Scythian) ruler of Malwa, a member of the Western Satraps dynasty (see Junagadh rock inscription of Rudradaman). The edict also narrates the story of Sudarshan Lake which was built or renovated by Rudradaman I, and the heavy rain and storm due to which it had broken.

Another inscription dates from about 450 CE and refers to Skandagupta, one the last Gupta emperors.

The protective building around the edicts was built in 1900 by Nawab Rasool Khan of Junagadh State at a cost of Rs 8,662. It was repaired and restored in 1939 and 1941 by the rulers of Junagadh. The wall of the structure had collapsed in 2014.

A much smaller replica of these Girnar edicts has been positioned outside the entrance of the National Museum in Delhi.

Similarly, inside the Parliament Museum at New Delhi, an exhibit replicates the act of artists sculpting inscriptions of Girnar edict on a rock.

A little further from Ashoka&#x27;s inscription, on the right side of the road, there is a large stone standing which looks like exact replica of Ashoka&#x27;s inscription.

=== Jain sources ===

Jain texts record Girnar mountain as an ancient pilgrimage site from where crores (&quot;koda-kodi&quot;) of monks have attained liberation. Neminath, the 22nd Tirthankara attained Moksha from this hill. Śvetāmbara tradition also considers Girnar to be an eternally Jain pilgrimage. 3rd century BCE text Kalpa Sūtra by Acharya Bhadrabāhusuri mentions Girnar hill to be the place of initiation, Kevala jnana, and Moksha of the 22nd Tirthankara, Neminatha.

Sixth century BCE Jain text Uttaradhyayana Sutra which is believed to be the direct words of Mahavira, mentions that Neminatha ascended Mount Raivataka to become an ascetic in the 22nd chapter. Acharya Dharasena, who was a resident of Girnar, practiced penance and meditation in Candragumpha cave of the mountain. He gave the spiritual knowledge to Pushpadanta and Bhutabali, who wrote the Shatkhandagama in between 86 CE and 156 CE.

== Girnar Ropeway ==
Girnar ropeway is Asia&#x27;s longest ropeway. First proposed in 1983, the construction started only in September 2018 due to government approval delays and litigation. The construction and operation is managed by Usha Breco Limited. The project was inaugurated on 24 October 2020 by now Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The ropeway is long and takes passengers above the hill to the Ambika Jain temple (Ambaji) within 10 minutes.

==Jain Temples==

Girnar Jain temples are a group of Śvetāmbara Jain temples and one Digambara temple atop Mount Girnar. Neminatha, the 22nd Tirthankara had renounced the world and become an ascetic, and then attained omniscience and liberation, all atop this mountain. Therefore, the hill is sacred to both the sects of Jainism.

It is home to sixteen exquisitely sculpted temples. The first peak, or &quot;Tunk&quot;, consists of the black granite temple dedicated to Lord Neminath, constructed in 1128 AD. The temple features intricate carvings on its pillars and is adorned with unique colored mosaics. The second Tunk houses the demi-goddess Ambika temple, while the third and fourth Tunks are significant for containing the foot-idols of Muni Shambh Kumar and Pradhyuman Kumar, who visited here. The fifth Tunk, requiring a climb of 10,000 steps from the base, enshrines the foot-idol of Bhagwan Neminath. Additionally, other sacred sites include the cave of Rajul, the Rathanemi temple (dedicated to Neminath&#x27;s younger brother), and Sahasavan.

Girnar holds great significance in Jain history and legends. As per Jain scriptures, it is believed that Girnar has been in existence since eternity and that the 22nd Tirthankara Neminatha visited and performed his penance on this mountain in the present Avsarpini. Canonical Śvetāmbara scriptures such as &quot;Kalpa Sūtra&quot;, &quot;Āvassaya-sutta&quot;, &quot;Nāyā-dhamma-kahāo&quot;, &quot;Uttarajjhayaṇa-sutta&quot; and non-canonical ancient works of literature such as Prabhavak Charitra by Acharya Prabhachandrasuri, &quot;Neminah Chariu&quot;, and &quot;Samyaktva Saptatika&quot; by Acharya Haribhadrasuri, &quot;Trīṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacharitra&quot; by Acharya Hemachandrasuri, &quot;Vastupala-Mahakavya&quot; by Acharya Udayprabhasuri, &quot;Kumarpalabhupal-Charitra&quot; by Acharya Jaisinhsuri, &quot;Jain Meghdoot&quot; by Acharya Merutungasuri, &quot;Raivatgirirasu&quot; by Acharya Vijaysensuri are some prominent scriptures emphasizing the importance of Girnar in Jainism.

&quot;Karnavihāra Prāsāda,&quot; one of the main temples atop the hill, is dedicated to Neminatha. Its main idol is made of black granite and the temple itself features Maru-Gurjara architecture. &quot;Vividha Tirtha Kalpa&quot; by Acharya Jinprabhasuri mentions that the original idol was made of clay and that the temple was made of wood. &quot;Ratnasār&quot; came to Girnar with a sangha and performed ritualistic bathing of the clay idol due to which it dissolved in the holy water. Due to this, &quot;Ratnasār&quot; got upset and fasted for 21 days, after which, demigoddess Ambika, pleased by his devotion, gave him an idol of Neminatha. Therefore the current idol of Neminatha was installed by a Śrāvaka named &quot;Ratnasār&quot;, from Kashmir, in the 10th century CE. He is said to have had obtained this idol from demigoddess Ambika. It was later renovated by &quot;Sajjana&quot;, a minister of Jaysimha Siddharaja in the 12th century CE. &quot;Sajjana&quot; utilized three years&#x27; worth of tax revenue collected from the people of Saurashtra. When Jaysimha Siddharaja got to know about the incident, he decided to investigate it. However, until then, &quot;Sajjana&quot; had already raised funds from the Śrāvakas and presented them to Siddharaja. Sajjana told Siddharaja that the temple was named &quot;Karnavihāra Prāsāda&quot; after Siddharaja&#x27;s father Karnadev. Pleased with the gesture, Siddharaja approved the revenue funds spent on the renovation of the temple.

Apart from &quot;Karnavihāra Prāsāda&quot;, there are other temples dedicated to other Tirthankaras built across centuries such as: &quot;Adbad Adinath Temple&quot;, &quot;Panchmeru Temple&quot;, &quot;Merak Vasahi Temple&quot;, &quot;Sangram Soni&#x27;s Temple&quot;, &quot;Kumarpala&#x27;s Temple&quot;, &quot;Vastupala&quot;&quot;Tejpala Temple&quot;, &quot;Mansingh Bhojraj Temple&quot;, &quot;Samprati Maharaja Temple&quot;, &quot;Amizara Parshwanath Temple&quot;, &quot;Rajimati&#x27;s Cave&quot;, and &quot;Sahasavan Temple&quot;.

&quot;Shatrunjay Mahatmya&quot;, a text written by Acharya Dhaneshwarsuri, a monk of the Śvetāmbara sect of Jainism mentions that &quot;Sahasavan&#x27;s&quot; original name was &quot;Sahatramra-van&quot; (). It is the place where Neminatha renounced the world and became an ascetic along with 1000 other kings on the 6th day of bright half of Shravan month. After 54 days of becoming an ascetic, Neminatha came back to &quot;Sahasavan,&quot; where he attained omniscience on the 15th day of dark half of Bhadrapad month. To commemorate the auspiciousness of both the events, Jains installed footprints of Neminatha at both these places.

Neminatha spent many years in spreading wisdom after attaining omniscience and then he attained Moksha on the fifth peak of Mount Girnar on the 8th day of bright half of Ashadha month. Footprints of Neminatha were placed at the spot where he attained &quot;moksha&quot; to commemorate the occasion. The temple that now houses an idol of Dattatreya, in renowned archaeologist James Burgess&#x27;s works, is said to have had Lord Neminath&#x27;s sacred footprints and that it was administered by a &quot;naked ascetic&quot; (Digambara monk), implying that it was originally a Jain temple. However, currently, the place of Neminatha&#x27;s nirvana is disputed between Jains and followers of Dattatreya who believe that it is also the place of Dattatreya&#x27;s penance. An idol of Dattatreya was placed and a new shrine was built surrounding the footprints of Neminatha. Some cases between Jains and Hindus, seeking a reconstruction of canopies above the footprints of Neminatha and a removal of the idol of Dattatreya that was illegally established in 2004 and other illegal constructions are pending in the Gujarat High Court.

==Ambika Temple==

This temple is dedicated to Jain deity &quot;Ambika yakshi&quot; (Ambaji), an attendant of Lord Neminath. The early temple was built before 784 CE (probably in middle of the 8th century) because Digambar Jain Acharya Jinasen&#x27;s &quot;Harivamsapurana&quot; (Saka Samvat 705, 783 CE) mentions the temple. An inscription dated Vikram Samvat 1249 (1192 CE) mentions Vaghela minister Vastupala&#x27;s pilgrimage to Ambika temple on Raivataka (Girnar) hill. Narendraprabhsuri mentions that Vastupala had installed idols of himself and his brother Tejapala in the temple. Jinharshasuri mentions that Vastupala and his brother Tejapala visited as well as built the large &quot;mandapa&quot; of the temple and &quot;parikara&quot; of Ambika. A &quot;praśast&quot;i eulogy given at the end in a golden lettered copy of &quot;Kalpasutra&quot; dated Vikram Samvat 1524 (1468 CE) mentions that a Jain Shreshthi (merchant) named Samal Sah restored and renovated the Ambika temple on Girnar. As mentioned in Jain pilgrimage travelogues, the temple had Ambika as a Jain &quot;yakshika&quot; deity. The Girnar &quot;patta&quot; from Samvat 1507 in Ranakpur Jain temple also depicts Ambika in the similar manner. The temple is built according to the Jain tradition and the &quot;mandapa&quot; ceiling match with the Girnar Jain temples.

The present temple is built around the 15th century. The temple was historically a Jain temple. So the temple construction, renovation and reconstruction history extends from the mid-8th century to the 15th century.

As per archaeologist James Burgess&#x27;s works on Gujarat&#x27;s history, Ambika temple was not a Hindu shrine and that Jains had built it and Hindus had occupied it later.

==Hindu Temples==
Atop Girnar&#x27;s highest peak, reached by a 10,000-step climb, is a temple managed by devotees of Dattatreya. This temple, in renowned archaeologist James Burgess&#x27;s works, is said to have had Lord Neminath&#x27;s sacred footprints and that it was administered by a &quot;naked ascetic&quot;, implying that it was originally a Jain temple. The Jain community has contested the ownership and worship rights of this temple in the Gujarat High Court, and the matter remains under judicial consideration. On the trek from Ambika temple to the disputed site, there&#x27;s a Gorakhnath temple located on the intermediate peak.

Further up there&#x27;s a lower peak which is not easily accessible where a shrine of goddess Mahakali is located which is also known as Mahakali Khappar by locals.
On the second trail to descent the mountain, there are two temples called Bharat-van and Sita-van which are located in the forests named after Sita and Bharata.
==Girnar&#x27;s Initial trek==
The base of the mountain, known as Girnar Taleti, is about 4 km east of the center of Junagadh. There are temples and other sacred places all along this stretch.

The traveller, in order to reach Girnar Taleti from Junagadh city, will pass through the Wagheshwari or Vagheshwari Gate (Girnar Darwaza), which is close to the Uparkot fort area, Easterly.

At about 200 metres from the gate, to the right of the road, is the Temple of Wagheshwari (Upale Vagheshwari maa), which is joined to the road by a causeway about 150 yards long. An ancient Verai Mata mandir and a modern Gayatri Shakti Peeth mandir are nearby.

About a furlong beyond this is a stone bridge, and just beyond it on the right are the Ashoka&#x27;s Major Rock Edicts. The edicts are inscribed high up on a large, domed mass of black granite measuring roughly 20 feet x 30 feet. The inscription is in Brahmi script.

On leaving Ashoka&#x27;s edicts, the route crosses the handsome bridge over the Sona-rekha, which here forms a fine sheet of water over golden sand, then passes a number of temples, at first on the left bank of the river and then on the right, to the largest of the temples. This is dedicated to Damodar, a name of Krishna, from Dam, a rope, because by tradition his mother in vain attempted to confine him with a rope when a child. The reservoir, Damodar Kund, at this place is accounted very sacred.

Next is an old shrine of Bhavnath, a form of Shiva, close to Girnar Taleti; Mrigi kund and Sudharshan lake are nearby.

Most persons who are not active climbers will probably proceed up the mountain in a swing &quot;doli&quot; from Taleti. A long ridge runs up from the west, and culminates in a rugged scarped rock, on the top of which are the temples. Close to the old shrine is a well called the Chadani vav.

The paved way begins just beyond this and continues for two-thirds of the ascent. The first resthouse, Chadia Parab, is reached, 480 feet, above the plain; and the second halting-place at Dholi-deri, 1000 feet above the plain. From here the ascent becomes more difficult, winding under the face of the precipice to the third resthouse, 1400 feet up. The path turns to the right along the edge of a precipice, which is very narrow, so that the &quot;doli&quot; almost grazes the scarp, which rises perpendicularly 200 feet above the traveller. On the right is seen the lofty mountain of Datar, covered with low jungle. At about 1500 feet there is a stone dharmsala, and from this there is a fine view of the rock called the Bhairav-Thampa, &quot;the terrific leap,&quot; because devotees used to cast themselves from its top, falling 1000 feet or more.

At 2370 feet above Junagadh, the gate of the enclosure known as the Deva Kota, or Ra Khengar&#x27;s Palace, is reached.

==Festivals==
Jain festivals like Mahavir Jayanti, Paryushana, and birth and nirvana kalyanaks of Lord Neminath are celebrated by Jains.

The main event for Hindus is the Maha Shivaratri fair held every year on the 14th day of the Hindu calendar month of Magha. At least 1 million pilgrims visit the fair to participate in pooja and parikrama of Girnar hill. The procession begins at Bhavnath Mahadev Temple at Bhavnath. It then proceeds onwards to various akharas of various sects of sadhus, which are in Girnar hill from ancient times. The procession of sadhus and pilgrims ends again at Bhavnath temple after visiting Madhi, Malavela and Bor Devi temple. The fair begins with hoisting of fifty-two &quot;Gaja&quot; long flags at Bhavnath Mahadev temple. This fair is the backbone of the economy of Junagadh, as more than ten lakh pilgrims who visit the fair generate a revenue of 250 million in only five days.

== Tanks ==
Outside to the north of the Kumarapala&#x27;s temple, there is the Bhima Kunda, a tank measuring 70 feet by 50 feet. Below it and on the verge of the cliff is a smaller tank of water and near it a small canopy supported by three roughly hewn pillars and a piece of rock containing a short octagonal stone called &quot;Hathi pagla&quot; or &quot;Gajapada,&quot; the elephant foot, a stratum on the top of which is of light granite and the rest of dark the lower part is immersed in water most of the year.

As per historical records, Sajjana, the minister of Chaulukya king Siddharaja Jayasimha, built the Neminatha temple using the state treasury. When he collected the funds to return as a compensation, the king declined to accept it so the funds were used to build the temple.

Sahastraphana (thousand hooded) Parshwanatha, the image which was consecrated in 1803 CE (VS 1459) by Vijayajinendra Suri, is currently the central deity in the temple. The temple originally housed the golden image of Mahavira and brass images of Shantinatha and Parshwanatha on its sides.

The east facing temple has 52 small shrines surrounding the central temple. It has an open portico with ceilings with fine carvings. In the &quot;bhamti&quot; or cloisters surrounding the court, there are also some remarkable designs in carved ceilings. The roof of the &quot;rangamandapa&quot; has fine carvings. The shrine proper must have been removed and replaced with new one at the end of the sixteenth century or the start of the seventeenth century. It is known that Karmachandra Bachchhavat, minister of the king of Bikaner, had sent a funds to renovate temple in Shatrunjaya and Girnar under Jinachandrasuri IV of Kharatara Gaccha during the reign of Akbar. There is a shrine housing replica of Ashtapada hill in the south, shrine with Shatrunjayavatar in west, behind the main temple, and Samet Shikhar (or Nandishwar Dwipa) in north.

<text>Karl Ludwig Hencke (8 April 1793 – 21 September 1866) was a German amateur astronomer and discoverer of minor planets. He is sometimes confused with Johann Franz Encke, another German astronomer.

==Biography==
Hencke was born in Driesen, Brandenburg (now Drezdenko, Poland). He volunteered in the Wars of Liberation (&quot;Befreiungskriege&quot;) for Prussia but was wounded at Lützen. Thereafter he served as post official at various places and finally was erected post master. After his retirement at age 45 for health reasons he lived in his city of birth where he served as city court judge.

He discovered two asteroids from his private observatory at #9, Kietz (now #43, Kietzerstraße), Driesen, by comparing star maps with the sky seen through his telescope. The first, 5 Astraea, was the first asteroid discovered after the long gap that followed the last of the original four, 4 Vesta, which was discovered already in 1807. Other astronomers had abandoned their searches for more asteroids, convinced that there were only four. However, Hencke began searching in 1830, and fifteen years later met with success. Two years later he discovered his second asteroid 6 Hebe. He also worked on the improvement of star maps.

He died at the age of 73 in the northern Polish town of Kwidzyn, what was then called &quot;Marienwerder&quot; and part of Prussia. The asteroid 2005 Hencke – a main-belt asteroid of the Eunomia family, discovered by Swiss astronomer Paul Wild in 1973, was named in his memory ().

<text>This list is a compilation of German toponyms (i.e., names of cities, regions, rivers, mountains and other geographical features situated in a German-speaking area) that have traditional English-language exonyms.

Usage notes:
* While in the case of regions, rivers and mountains, English exonyms are the definite choice (not least of all because the features they describe often cross language borders), some lesser-known city exonyms whose difference is merely orthographic and does not affect pronunciation (&quot;Cassel&quot;, &quot;Coblenz&quot;, &quot;Leipsic&quot;, &quot;Hanover&quot;, &quot;Mayence&quot;) have begun to retreat in favour of the forms. The media are divided about the use of the English exonyms &quot;Basle&quot;, &quot;Berne&quot;, and &quot;Zurich&quot;. (&quot;The Times Style guide&quot; encourages the continued use of Basle and Berne. ) Usage may also depend on context; the spelling &quot;Kleve&quot; could be used in a news story about an incident in that city, but the fourth wife of Henry VIII of England is always referred to in English as Anne of &quot;Cleves&quot;, never Anne of &quot;Kleve&quot;.
* Exonyms that are used exclusively in historical and/or ecclesiastical contexts are marked in italics.

<text>Bort-les-Orgues (; ) is a commune in the south-central French department of Corrèze.

== Geography ==
Bort-les-Orgues is situated on the Dordogne.

The southern boundary of the commune is formed by the rivers Rhue and Dordogne. About 3 km east of the confluence of these rivers, the Rhue has carved a small gorge at a site known as the &quot;Saut de la Saule&quot;. Bort-les-Orgues takes its name from &quot;les Orgues&quot;, a 2-km-long cliff of volcanic columnar basalt 80m to 100m high, at the foot of which it lies.

==Population==
==Personalities==
*Bort-les-Orgues was the birthplace of the philosopher Jean-François Marmontel (1723–1799).
*Lina Margy (1914–1973), the famous French singer of the &quot;Le Petit Vin blanc&quot;, was born in Rue de Piechecros, in Bort-les-Orgues.
*Pierre Tornade (21 January 1930 – 7 March 2012) was a French actor. He appeared in 128 films and television shows between 1956 and 1998.

<doc id="582887" wikidata="Q107509" url="?curid=582887" title="6 Hebe">
<text>6 Hebe () is a large main-belt asteroid, containing around 0.5% of the mass of the belt. However, due to its apparently high bulk density (greater than that of the Moon), Hebe does not rank among the top twenty asteroids by volume. This high bulk density suggests an extremely solid body that has not been impacted by collisions, which is not typical of asteroids of its size – they tend to be loosely-bound rubble piles.

In brightness, Hebe is the fifth-brightest object in the asteroid belt after Vesta, Ceres, Iris, and Pallas. It has a mean opposition magnitude of +8.3, about equal to the mean brightness of Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan, and can reach +7.5 at an opposition near perihelion.

Hebe may be the parent body of the H chondrite meteorites, which account for about 40% of all meteorites striking Earth.

==History==
Hebe was discovered on 1 July 1847 by Karl Ludwig Hencke, the sixth asteroid discovered. It was the second and final asteroid discovery by Hencke, after 5 Astraea. The name &quot;Hebe&quot;, goddess of youth, was proposed by Carl Friedrich Gauss at Hencke&#x27;s request. Gauss chose a wineglass as its symbol. It is in the pipeline for Unicode 17.0 as U+1CEC0 𜻀 ().

==Potential as major meteorite source==
Hebe was once thought to be the probable parent body of the H chondrite meteorites and the IIE iron meteorites. This would imply that it is the source of about 40% of all meteorites striking Earth. Evidence for this connection includes the following:
* The spectrum of Hebe matches a mix of 60% H chondrite and 40% IIE iron meteorite material.
* The IIE type are unusual among the iron meteorites, and probably formed from impact melt, rather than being fragments of the core of a differentiated asteroid.
* The IIE irons and H chondrites likely come from the same parent body, due to similar trace mineral and oxygen isotope ratios.
* Asteroids with spectra similar to the ordinary chondrite meteorites (accounting for 85% of all falls, including the H chondrites) are extremely rare.
* 6 Hebe is extremely well placed to send impact debris to Earth-crossing orbits. Ejecta with even relatively small velocities (~280 m/s) can enter the chaotic regions of the 3:1 Kirkwood gap at 2.50 AU and the nearby formula_1 secular resonance which determines the high-inclination edge of the asteroid belt at about 16° inclinations hereabouts.
* Of the asteroids in this &quot;well-placed&quot; orbit, Hebe is the largest.
* An analysis of likely contributors to Earth&#x27;s meteorite flux places 6 Hebe at the top of the list, due to its position and relatively large size.

However, observations by the VLT in 2017 indicate that the depressions caused by impacts on 6 Hebe are only 20% the volume of the nearby H-chondrite asteroid families, suggesting the Hebe is not the most likely or primary source of H-chondrite meteorites.

==Physical characteristics==

Lightcurve analysis suggests that Hebe has a rather angular shape, which may be due to several large impact craters. Hebe rotates in a prograde direction, with the north pole pointing towards ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (45°, 339°) with a 10° uncertainty. This gives an axial tilt of 42°.

It has a bright surface and, if its identification as the parent body of the H chondrites is correct, a
surface composition of silicate chondritic rocks mixed with pieces of iron–nickel. A likely scenario for the formation of the surface metal is as follows:
# Large impacts caused local melting of the iron rich H chondrite surface. The metals, being heavier, would have settled to the bottom of the magma lake, forming a metallic layer buried by a relatively shallow layer of silicates.
# Later sizeable impacts broke up and mixed these layers.
# Small frequent impacts tend to preferentially pulverize the weaker rocky debris, leading to an increased concentration of the larger metal fragments at the surface, such that they eventually comprise ~40% of the immediate surface at the present time.
==Orbit==

On 5 March 1977 Hebe occulted Kaffaljidhma (γ Ceti), a moderately bright 3rd-magnitude star. Between 1977 and 2021, 6 Hebe has been observed to occult fourteen stars.

==Possible moon==
As a result of the aforementioned 1977 occultation, a small moon around Hebe was reported by Paul D. Maley. It was nicknamed &quot;Jebe&quot;. This was the first modern-day suggestion that asteroids have satellites. It was 17 years later when the first asteroid moon was formally discovered (Dactyl, the satellite of 243 Ida). The discovery of Hebe&#x27;s moon was never confirmed.

<doc id="582888" wikidata="Q5120894" url="?curid=582888" title="Cinesphere">
<text>Cinesphere is the world&#x27;s first permanent IMAX movie theatre, located on the grounds of Ontario Place in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Constructed in 1971, it is the largest IMAX theatre in Ontario. The theatre has both IMAX 70mm and IMAX with Laser projection systems. The theatre is considered a building of heritage value and shows movies each weekend. It is owned by the Government of Ontario, which owns the entire Ontario Place site.

Cinesphere&#x27;s is a triodetic-domed structure, akin to a geodesic dome, with a outer radius, and a inner radius, supported by prefabricated steel and aluminium alloy tubes. Eberhard Zeidler, who also designed the &quot;Pods&quot; of Ontario Place, also designed Cinesphere. Its screen is wide by high. Its seating capacity was originally 752, but this was reduced after a renovation for 3D projection in 2011 to 614. The building is surrounded by a moat, and the entrance area is through doorways on the east side connected to the Ontario Place pod bridges and staircases to the Ontario Place West Island. Exiting is done through doorways leading to ramps over the moat to the West Island. The seating is stadium-style seating with no obstructions. The Cinesphere is wheelchair accessible.

The Cinesphere opened with two specially-commissioned films. Graeme Ferguson&#x27;s &quot;North of Superior&quot; was the first IMAX film commissioned for and screened at Cinesphere. &quot;Seasons in the Mind&quot; a non-IMAX film about Eastern Ontario, also played at the Cinesphere at its opening. During the run of the theme park, Cinesphere would usually show a programme of two or more one-hour films per day, repeated several times per day, from a selection of four Ontario-commissioned films. During the off-season, Cinesphere showed commercial films.

In 1991, the sound system was upgraded adding digital capabilities. In 2011, the original projection system was replaced with an IMAX GT 3D system and new NEXIOS playback system. In celebration of its 40th anniversary in 2011, the theatre closed for six months to undergo extensive renovations. Toronto architecture firm Gow Hastings Architects was awarded the refurbishment of the theatre in 2010. On February 1, 2012, the Government of Ontario announced that Cinesphere would close while Ontario Place is under renovation. On July 31, 2014, the Government of Ontario announced plans to revitalize the area as an urban park with the Cinesphere and pods retained. During the renovations, the theatre was used as a testbed for IMAX&#x27;s new laser projection system. In 2014, the Government of Ontario designated Cinesphere as a structure of Cultural Heritage Value.

In 2017, a new projection system &quot;IMAX with Laser&quot; was installed in addition to its 70mm film projector. In September 2017, Cinesphere temporarily re-opened for special screenings of &quot;Dunkirk&quot; (2017) and &quot;North of Superior&quot; (1971) as part of the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival. In October 2017, the Government of Ontario announced that it would reopen as a permanent theatre. It reopened on November 3, 2017. On October 17, 2022, it was closed for renovations.

<doc id="582899" wikidata="Q77052" url="?curid=582899" title="Karl Ludwig Harding">
<text>Karl Ludwig Harding (29 September 1765 – 31 August 1834) was a German astronomer, who discovered Juno, the third asteroid of the main-belt in 1804.

== Life and career ==
Harding was born in Lauenburg. From 1786–89, he was educated at the University of Göttingen, where he studied theology, mathematics, and physics. In 1796, Johann Hieronymus Schröter hired Harding as a tutor for his son. Schröter was an enthusiastic astronomer and owner of a well-equipped observatory in Lilienthal near Bremen, where Harding was soon appointed observer and inspector.

In 1800, he was among the 24 astronomers invited to participate in the celestial police, a group dedicated to finding additional planets in the solar system. As part of the group, in 1804, Harding discovered Juno at Schröter&#x27;s observatory. In the next year he left Lilienthal, where his successor became Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, as he was appointed extraordinary professor of astronomy at the University of Göttingen, since 1812 as ordinary professor. He worked at Göttingen Observatory, since 1807 as colleague of Carl Friedrich Gauss, until his sudden death in 1834.

In addition to Juno, he discovered three comets and the variable stars R Virginis, R Aquarii, R Serpentis and S Serpentis. Furthermore, he found some new nebulae, among them being the Helix Nebula or &quot;the Eye of God&quot;. His main opus was the Atlas novus coelestis, the first star atlas without splendid but confusing mythological figures.

<text>The Rolls-Royce AE 2100 is a turboprop developed by Allison Engine Company, now part of Rolls-Royce North America. The engine was originally known as the GMA 2100, when Allison was a division of former corporate parent General Motors.

==Development==
On July 11, 1989, Saab-Scania A.B. selected the GMA 2100 to power its new Saab 2000, a 50-seat stretch of the Saab 340 turboprop, in a US$500 million deal. In July 1990, Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (IPTN) of Indonesia picked the GMA 2100 as the engine for the twin-engine N-250 regional airliner. Flight testing with a Dowty R373 propeller on a Lockheed P-3 Orion testbed aircraft began on August 23, 1990, and finished after over 50 hours of flight and ground testing.

The GMA 2100D3 became the powerplant for the Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules. It made its first test flight on March 19, 1994, which was conducted by Marshall Aerospace on a Lockheed C-130K Hercules testbed leased from the Royal Air Force. Testing ended in June 1994 after 47 flight hours. The engine powered the initial flight of the C-130J aircraft on April 5, 1996. By April 1997, the D3 variant had received Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) type certification. 2,000 of the D3 variants have been delivered as of 2018.

The engine&#x27;s C variant was certified on December 20, 1993. It powered the N-250 prototype&#x27;s first flight on August 10, 1995, but the N-250 aircraft program was postponed indefinitely in the late 1990s due to the Asian financial crisis.

In June 1997, the AE 2100 was selected by Lockheed Martin and Alenia to power the C-27J Spartan tactical airlifter. In October 2015, Alenia announced plans to use a uprated version of the AE 2100 as the baseline engine by 2017.

==Design==
A derivative of the Allison AE 1107C-Liberty (Rolls-Royce T406) turboshaft engine, the AE 2100 shares the same high-pressure core as that engine, as does the Rolls-Royce AE 3007 turbofan. This core is capable of powering turboprops of up to . The AE 2100 is a two-shaft design, and it was the first to use dual FADECs (full authority digital engine control) to control both engine and propeller, allowing both to be adjusted with a single lever. There are four production variants of the engine: the civil AE 2100A, and the military variants which include the AE 2100D2/D2A, AE 2100D3, AE 2100J and AE 2100P.

The AE 2100 inherited the Allison T56&#x27;s 14-stage axial compressor design, but the inlet and the stator for the first five stages have variable blades. The annular combustor has 16 air-blast fuel injection nozzles. The turbine that drives the compressor has two stages, with the first stage using single-crystal blades. A free power turbine with two stages drives the propeller through an inner shaft and a gearbox. The engine has replaceable steel blades and vanes, which are more reliable but heavier than titanium.

The AE 2100 engine and gearbox are rated at , but was derated to for the Saab 2000, Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules, and IPTN N-250, respectively. The engine uses six-bladed, all-composite blade Dowty propellers, including the model R381 on the Saab 2000, R414 on the ShinMaywa US-2, R384 on the IPTN N-250, and R391 on the C-130J military transport and the LM-100J civil-certified version of the C-130J. The gearbox has a reduction ratio of about 14 and a mean time before unscheduled removal (MTBUR) of over 35,000 hours.
