<text>Diners Club International (DCI), founded as Diners Club, is a charge card company owned by Discover Financial Services. Formed in 1950 by Frank X. McNamara, Ralph Schneider (1909–1964), Matty Simmons, and Alfred S. Bloomingdale, it was the first independent payment card company in the world, successfully establishing the financial card service of issuing travel and entertainment (T&amp;E) credit cards as a viable business. Diners Club International and its franchises serve individuals from around the world with operations in 59 countries.

== History ==

The idea for Diners Club was conceived at the Majors Cabin Grill restaurant in New York City in 1949. Diners Club cofounder Frank McNamara was dining with clients and realized he had left his wallet in another suit. His wife paid the bill, and McNamara thought of a multipurpose charge card as a way to avoid similar embarrassments in the future. He discussed the idea with the restaurant owner at the table, and the following day with his lawyer Ralph Schneider and friend Alfred S. Bloomingdale. McNamara returned to the same restaurant the following February, in 1950, and paid for his meal using a cardboard charge card and a signature. The story became well known. Diners Club official history refers to this meal as &quot;The First Supper&quot;, and is credited by historians as the beginnings of contemporary credit. Various versions of the story differ about whether it was a lunch or dinner at which McNamara forgot his wallet, and whether the bill was paid on loan or McNamara waited for his wife to drive his wallet to him. Some journalists later credited Alfred Bloomingdale with the idea for Diners Club.

McNamara and his attorney, Ralph Schneider, founded Diners Club International on February 8, 1950, with $1.5 million in initial capital. Alfred Bloomingdale joined briefly, then started a competing venture in California before merging his California-based Dine and Sign with Diners Club. McNamara&#x27;s original conception was to make a card that could be used as a means of payment in restaurants around New York City; however, he later expanded its usage to other types of establishments, including hotels, car rentals, and flower shops. The company started building its customer base by offering their cards to prominent businessmen. Shortly afterward, Matty Simmons, the company&#x27;s first press agent, started advertising the card in newspapers, magazines, and by sending personal mail to potential customers. Diners Club International was named for being a &quot;club of diners&quot; that would allow patrons to settle their bill at the end of each month through their credit account. When the card was first introduced, Diners Club listed 27 participating restaurants, and 200 of the founders&#x27; friends and acquaintances used it.

Diners Club had 20,000 members by the end of 1950 and 42,000 by the end of 1951. At the time, the company was charging participating establishments 7% and billed cardholders $5 a year. In 1952, McNamara sold his interest in Diners Club to his partners for $200,000. The first plastic Diners Club card was introduced in 1961; by the mid-1960s, Diners Club had 1.3 million cardholders.

Towards the end of the 1960s, Diners Club faced competition from banks that issued revolving credit cards through Bank of America&#x27;s BankAmericard (later changing its name to Visa), and Interbank Master Charge (renamed to MasterCard). Starting in 1968, the American Oil Company, or Amoco, also launched its own co-branded Diners Club cards called American Torch Club (later renamed Amoco Torch Club), and Sun Oil Company issued its version called Sun Diners Club Card starting in 1977.

In 1981, Citibank, a unit of Citicorp, bought Diners Club International, including the franchisor that holds rights to the Diners Club trademark. Despite this, a majority of the franchises abroad remain independently owned.

In April 2008, Discover Financial and Citigroup announced that Discover was purchasing the Diners Club International network from Citigroup for $165 million. In May 2008, the Federal Trade Commission approved the transaction and it was finalized on July 1, 2008.

==Franchising==
===International franchise===
In a transaction completed on July 1, 2008, Discover Financial Services purchased Diners Club International from Citibank for $165 million. The deal was announced in April 2008 and approved by the U.S. government in May 2008. By merging the North American Discover Network with the international Diners Club Network, Discover created a global payment processing system. Discover Bank has no plans to issue Diners Club-branded cards, which continue to be issued by Diners Club International licensees.

In 2011, Discover started incorporating its logo on Diners Club International cards. Several payment processors, like PayPal, can process only new Diners Club International cards, which include the Discover logo, as well as BMO&#x27;s Diners Club-branded Mastercards issued in North America.

===Argentina===
In Argentina, Citibank entered into an agreement to transfer its rights and obligations to Banco Comafi. From December 16, 2013, until August 31, 2021, Banco Comafi S.A. managed the Diners Club credit card business in Argentina. After Banco Comafi closed the Diners Club Argentina business, all existing Diners Club Argentina credit cards were converted into Mastercard credit cards.

===Australia===
In July 1974, Ansett Transport Industries purchased a 50% shareholding in the Australian franchise. In January 1999, Ansett sold its shareholding to Citigroup.

On June 1, 2022, National Australia Bank bought Citigroup&#x27;s Consumer Banking business in Australia, including the Australian branch of Diners Club.
The Diners Club Corporate Card, Citi Mastercard Corporate Executive Companion Card, Diners Club Business Card and the Citi Mastercard Business Companion Card previously marketed under the Citibank brand were brought under the National Australia Bank (NAB) brand as a result of the acquisition.

On November 1, 2023, Diners Club Australia announced that it was ending personal cards on January 31, 2024, with no transactions possible after that date. Subsequently, it announced that all business and corporate cards were ending on April 15, 2024. All Diners Club accounts will close on September 16, 2024, effectively ending Diners Club&#x27;s presence in the Australian market.

=== Brazil ===
On November 21, 2018, it was announced that Diners Club International and Brazilian card association Elo were extending their partnership: they launched Elo Diners Club International Cards in Brazil. The cards run via the Discover Global Network, and are accepted at 42 million merchant locations and 2 million ATMs in over 190 countries and territories.

=== China and Hong Kong ===

In September 2017, Diners Club International signed a deal with Allinpay, a Chinese payment provider, to be the exclusive carrier of all the cards that are part of the Discover Global Network. Apart from that, Allinpay intended to increase the card acceptance in Hong Kong, especially by &quot;travel oriented merchants&quot;.

=== Chile ===
In Chile, the Diners Club franchise was long held by Citibank Chile until it was acquired by Banco de Chile in 2008, who then took over said franchise.

=== Colombia ===
In Colombia, the first Diners Club franchise was opened in 1963. Nowadays, the Colombian franchisee and issuer of Diners Club cards is Banco Davivienda.

=== Europe ===
Diners Club has franchises in some European countries, such as Austria, Germany, North Macedonia, Slovenia, Spain, and Switzerland for example. Those franchises generally only issue Diners Club cards to residents of their respective countries.

However, since January 2025, ISX Financial has become a pan-European Diners Club franchisee, issuing the Flykk Diners Club debit card in several European markets.

=== India ===
Diners Club was the first to introduce credit cards in India. Kali Mody is credited with opening the first Diners franchise in the country in 1961, which started an invitation-only credit card issuance. Its cards have been offered by Citibank India, followed by HDFC Bank which took over in 2011.

In 2021, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) barred the company (along with American Express) from issuing new cards for failing to follow norms about storing data within the country. The ban was lifted later in the year after it complied with the RBI guidelines.

=== Japan ===

The Nihon Kōtsū Kōsha (now JTB Corporation) and Fuji Bank (the direct predecessor of Mizuho Corporate Bank) founded Diners Club Japan in 1960, and began issuing the country&#x27;s first Diners Club cards in spring 1961, shortly before JCB. In 2000, Diners Club Japan was acquired by Citibank Japan, and since 2015, the sole issuer of all Diners Club cards in Japan is Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, after it acquired Citibank Japan&#x27;s credit card division that same year.

=== Kazakhstan ===
In September 2016, Kazkommertsbank became the official Diners Club card issuer in Kazakhstan. In a statement, managing director of Kazkommertsbank, Nurlan Zhagiparov said, &quot;Our collaboration with Diners Club is another step toward the integration of Kazakhstan into the global economy, which increases the tourism potential in our country.&quot;

===Korea, South===
In Korea, Diners Club started its business around the 1980s. However, in 1993, Citibank Korea sold Diners Club Korea to Daewoo Group, and after the acquisition by Daewoo Group, the parent company of Daewoo Motors, Diners Club Korea ran a successful business with sales of over 400 billion won. Diners Club Korea went through strict card issuance screening and solidified its position as a premium credit card in Korea. The number of Diners Club member stores increased more than tenfold, and the number of members reached hundreds of thousands, and the business was successful. However, Daewoo Group, which had acquired Diners Club, sold Diners Club Korea to Hyundai Motor Company after experiencing financial difficulties and starting a workout. Later, Diners Club Korea&#x27;s name was changed to Hyundai Card, and Hyundai Motor Company began issuing Visa and MasterCard credit cards other than Diners Club to start a credit card business in earnest. Hyundai Card continued to maintain the exclusive license of Diners Club, but stopped issuing the card and discontinued the license contract with Diners Club because there was no benefit compared to the license fee. As a result, Hyundai Card was able to issue American Express cards and signed an exclusive license for American Express Card individual cards in Korea. Since then, Diners Club has signed a license contract with Korean credit card companies BC Card and Woori Card to issue Diners Club cards in Korea. In addition, Diners Club, which previously used Hyundai Card&#x27;s payment network, began using BC Card&#x27;s payment network in 2018. BC Card is a credit card company established by various Korean banks such as Citibank Korea and Woori Bank. Because it has contracts with almost all stores in Korea, Diners Club cards can be used at almost all stores and restaurants in Korea.

===Nordic franchise===
In the Nordic countries, the long-time franchisee was SEB Kort AB, a subsidiary of the Swedish bank Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken. SEB Kort closed the service on May 31, 2019, citing increased competition and regulatory pressure in the Nordic payment card market, and the card is no longer issued in the Nordic countries.

===North American franchise===
====MasterCard alliance====
In 2004, Diners Club announced an agreement with Mastercard. Since 2004, all Diners Club cards issued in the United States and Canada (by Citibank until 2009, by BMO since) feature a Mastercard logo and 16-digit account number on the front and can be used wherever Mastercard is accepted. They are processed through the Mastercard network.

As of October 2023, BMO is not accepting new applications for Diners Club cards, as improvements are being made to the application process, while existing card members continue to be served.

Initially, cards from other countries continued to bear a 14-digit account number on the front, with the Mastercard logo on the back. However, since the takeover of Diners Club International by Discover Financial Services, international cards have had the Discover logo on the back and the Diners Club International network is part of the Discover network. Since then, the only connection between Diners Club in North America and Diners Club International is BMO&#x27;s continuous licensed use of the Diners Club brands, including Carte Blanche, on Mastercard credit cards.

====Carte Blanche====
Carte Blanche began in 1958 when the Hilton Hotels travel &amp; entertainment card was renamed. Hilton sold Carte Blanche to First National City Bank in 1966. Regulatory challenges forced First National City Bank to sell Carte Blanche to Avco in 1968. In 1978, Citicorp (parent company of First National City Bank which was renamed Citibank) reacquired Carte Blanche without regulatory opposition. The 1960s- and 1970s-era Carte Blanche cards were considered more prestigious worldwide than their competition, the American Express and Diners Club cards, though its small cardmember base hindered its success. In 1981, Citicorp acquired the Diners Club card, and by the mid-1990s the Carte Blanche card was being phased out in favor of Diners Club. Parent company Citigroup was formed in 1998 with the merger of Citicorp and the Travelers Group. Citigroup issued a premium Diners Club card in 2000, naming it the Diners Club Carte Blanche card. It was an upper-level charge card on par with the American Express Platinum Card.

The Carte Blanche card in North America, now a branded Mastercard issued by BMO under its Diners Club International brand license, carried a US$300 annual fee as of April 2015 and offers an extensive menu of perks.

====enRoute====

Diners Club expanded its customer base in Canada by acquiring the enRoute credit card from Air Canada in 1992. It marketed the card under the combined name for a period of time as the &quot;Diners Club/enRoute Card&quot;. The enRoute business was valued at over $300 million at the time of acquisition.

====Acquisition by BMO====
In November 2009, Citibank announced that Diners Club International&#x27;s North American franchise had been sold to Bank of Montreal (BMO). The deal gives BMO exclusive rights to issue Diners cards in the U.S. and Canada. At the time, BMO said the Diners Club fits well with its existing commercial card business, adding that, commercial cards are one of the fastest-growing segments in the credit card business.

===New Zealand===
In 2014, The Warehouse Group acquired the New Zealand Diners Club franchise from its Malaysian owners and subsequently launched The Warehouse Group Financial Services on said basis. The Warehouse Group subsequently closed Diners Club NZ in 2018.

===Russia===

In December 2010, Russian Standard Bank and Diners Club International entered into an agreement for settlement of transactions in Russia. Under the agreement, Russian Standard Bank will process settlement transactions of other banks acting as acquirers of Discover Financial Services and Diners Club International in Russia.

On March 8, 2022, Discover Financial Services and Diners Club International suspended all operations in Russia due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

===Slovenian franchise===
In 2013, Tomaž Lovše, who owned Diners Club Slovenia, was one of three people investigated in Slovenia regarding unpaid debts that his franchise owed to merchants. In May, the Central Bank of Slovenia revoked Diners Club Slovenia&#x27;s license for payment services, which meant 80,000 local members could not use their card. Diners Club International transferred the franchise to a subsidiary of Austria&#x27;s Erste Bank group, Erste Card Club, and agreed to repay the franchise&#x27;s debt to merchants. An Erste press release in August 2013 stated that Diners Club services were once again available in Slovenia.

=== Southeast Asia ===

==== Malaysia and Singapore ====
Diners Club launched its Malaysian and Singaporean franchises in 1960. Its Malaysian franchise was terminated in 2015.

In December 2016, Diners Club International and 2C2P announced in a statement that the latter is a global provider of cards running on Discover Global Network and that it will increase the number of merchants who use the card in the region of South East Asia.

In 2023, the Diners Club Singaporean franchise renamed itself to DCS Card Centre and broadened its business to become a &quot;fintech with heritage&quot; , as it aimed to become more than just an issuer of Diners Club cards in Singapore.
In tandem with the rebranding, issued its first non-Diners Club credit cards, DCS Ultimate Platinum UnionPay Card, and its Mastercard counterpart of the same name. This effectively made it the one of the only two Diners Club franchise companies to issue third-party payment network cards, the latter being Diners Club Ecuador.

==== the Philippines ====
On 8 October 1980, Diners Club entered into an exclusive franchise with Security Bank as exclusive franchisee of Diners Club in the Philippines through Security Diners International Corporation. In 2003, Security Diners International Corporation was renamed into SB Cards Corporation, as the bank diversified its product offering and entered into an agreement to carry Mastercard, alongside its Diners Club cards. Security Bank renewed its network participation agreement with Diners Club on 9 October 2013 which aimed to provide world class benefits of Diners Club in the Philippines through SBC. Turn of events suddenly changed the course of history in June 2016, Security Bank through its credit card division SB Cards Corporation sold Diners Club&#x27;s exclusive rights in the Philippines to competitor and Philippines&#x27; leading banking conglomerate, BDO Unibank and in October of the same year, Diners Club International announced that they signed a deal with BDO Unibank to become the exclusive provider of the Diners Club in the Philippines. Security Bank at the time offered three tier cards: Blue (Classic), Platinum (named International), and Black (named Premiere). At present, BDO offers Platinum (International), and Black (Premiere) cards.

===Spain===

===Swiss, Austrian and German franchise===
In a transaction that closed on August 6, 2010, Citibank sold the Swiss and German franchises to a private investment group headed by Anthony J. Helbling. The Austrian and German Diners Club cards are issued by the Austrian DC Bank AG, while the Swiss Diners Club cards are issued by Cornèr Banca SA.

===Turkey===
Diners Club was brought to Turkey by Koç Holding for the first time in 1968 and been issued for a while. After a couple years without being distributed in Turkey, it was brought back to the country in 2016 by Alternatif Bank and as of September 2023, it is still being distributed by Alternatif Bank. Since 2019, the Diners Club cards in Turkey are being issued co-branded with TROY within a card reciprocal agreement, thus the acceptance of Diners Club and Discovery cards throughout Turkey has been increased to full coverage. This agreement also provides TROY cards to be accepted on Discover/Diners Club network worldwide.

=== United Arab Emirates ===
Diners Club UAE, Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan is owned and operated by the Network International subsidiary of Emirates NBD Bank.

== Business development and contracts ==

=== Australian government travel services ===
In 2012 as part of a financial reform program started the previous year to address government spending by public servants, the Australian government appointed Diners Club as the sole provider of credit cards for government travel services. Under the arrangement, Diners Club provided charge cards as travel cards to public servants (e.g. Defence Travel Card). Diners Club was also to supply an updated Expense Management System (EMS), to government agencies without one, or who wanted to upgrade their existing system. The new EMS would provide &quot;timely, accurate and reliable” transactional data feeds for all card expenditure to agency finance or expense systems, allowing them to understand the nature of their travel expenditure, due to the “comprehensive data” that would be provided through the system from travel supplies. Diners Club provided Diners Club Travel Cards to government public servants with a companion Mastercard to increase the number of locations that accepted the card, to reduce cash advance withdrawals of travels allowances.
After the Diners Club withdrawal from the Australian market, most government departments have adopted Visa for their card transactions.

<text>YINSH is an abstract strategy board game by game designer Kris Burm. It is the fifth game to be released in the &quot;GIPF&quot; Project. At the time of its release in 2003, Burm stated that he intended it to be considered as the sixth and last game of the project, and that the game which he had not yet released, &quot;PÜNCT&quot;, would be logically the fifth game. However, the series was later expanded to seven games with the release of &quot;LYNGK&quot;.

Gameplay consists of moving rings to flip &quot;Reversi&quot;-like discs.

==Rules==

===Equipment===

&quot;YINSH&quot; is played on a board shaped like a truncated six-pointed star with a triangular grid and 85 spaces (referring to the nodes or intersections), including those along the perimeter. The board is oriented so the lines with the letter labels run between the two players. Each space in the game is available for placement of &quot;rings&quot; and &quot;markers&quot;

The game pieces are:
* 5 black and 5 white &quot;rings&quot;
* 51 reversible round disc &quot;markers&quot; which are black on one side and white on the other, similar to &quot;Reversi&quot; pieces

The &quot;rings&quot; are given to the players, while the &quot;markers&quot; are accessible to both as a common pool.

===Object===
The object of the game is to remove three of one&#x27;s own &quot;rings&quot; from the game. Since this is the goal of the game, getting closer to winning necessitates weakening oneself, which considerably complicates strategy as a move which brings one closer to winning the game may end up being a very poor move.

===Gameplay===
The game starts with an empty board, and proceeds in two phases, &quot;placement&quot; followed by &quot;movement&quot;. 

====Placement====
During the first phase the players, take turns placing one of their &quot;rings&quot; on the board on any unoccupied space, beginning with white. Once both players each have placed all five of their &quot;rings&quot;, this phase is over.

====Movement====
The second phase involves forming &quot;lines&quot;, defined as five adjacent &quot;markers&quot; in a straight line with a single color. Once a &quot;line&quot; is formed in one player&#x27;s color (on either player&#x27;s turn), that player removes the five &quot;markers&quot;, and also one of their &quot;rings&quot;. Once a player has removed three of their &quot;rings&quot;, they win the game.

A turn consists of the following:

#The player chooses one of their own &quot;rings&quot; to move.
#The player places a &quot;marker&quot;, with their own color face-up, in the middle of that &quot;ring&quot; on the space it occupies.
#The player then moves the &quot;ring&quot; to another unoccupied space, along a straight line from the originating node. The &quot;marker&quot; never moves. In general, there are six directions from any node, with exceptions along the perimeter of the game board.

When moving a ring, the following rules apply:

*The moving &quot;ring&quot; may not move over other &quot;rings&quot;.
*The moving &quot;ring&quot; may pass over any number of &quot;markers&quot; in a row. If it does so, it must stop on the blank space immediately following the last &quot;marker&quot; moved over.
**All &quot;markers&quot; moved over like this are flipped over after moving the &quot;ring&quot;, reversing their color.
*A moving &quot;ring&quot; may not end on a space already occupied by a &quot;marker&quot;.

It is possible, and not uncommon, to make a move which results in the opposing player having a line of five &quot;markers&quot; in a row. When more than one line is made in the same turn, the player who just moved resolves their own lines (if any) first, and then the other player resolves their lines (if any) before making their next move. Lines are resolved one at a time, so if a single &quot;marker&quot; is shared by two lines, only one of those lines may be resolved (but the player chooses which).

If all of the &quot;markers&quot; are placed on the board before either player has won, the game ends, with the winner being the player who has removed more &quot;rings&quot;. If both players have removed the same number of &quot;rings&quot; at this point, the game ends in a draw.

==Video games==
No official online versions of &quot;YINSH&quot; exist, but there are number of unofficial implementations. Notably the web-based biskai.de and Boardspace.net. On mobile, there is Shyring for iOS, published in December 2014.

<doc id="567676" wikidata="Q254295" url="?curid=567676" title="Pioneer Day">
<text>Pioneer Day is an official holiday celebrated on July 24 in the U.S. state of Utah, with some celebrations taking place in regions of surrounding states originally settled by Mormon pioneers. It commemorates the entry of Brigham Young and the first group of Mormon pioneers into the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847, where the Latter-day Saints settled after being forced from Nauvoo, Illinois, and other locations in the eastern United States. Parades, fireworks, rodeos, and other festivities help commemorate the event. Similar to July 4, many local and all state-run government offices and many businesses are closed on Pioneer Day.

In addition to being an official holiday in Utah, Pioneer Day is considered a special occasion by many members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). On Pioneer Day, some Latter-day Saints walk portions of the Mormon Trail or reenact entering the Salt Lake Valley by handcart. Latter-day Saints throughout the United States and around the world may celebrate July 24 in remembrance of the LDS Church&#x27;s pioneer era, with songs, dances, potlucks, and pioneer related activities.

While the holiday has strong links to the LDS Church, it is officially a celebration for everyone, regardless of faith and nationality, who immigrated to the Salt Lake Valley during the pioneer era, which is generally considered to have ended with the 1869 arrival of the transcontinental railroad. Notable non-LDS American pioneers from this period include Episcopal Bishop Daniel S. Tuttle, who was responsible for Utah&#x27;s first non-Mormon schools (Rowland Hall-St. Mark&#x27;s) and first public hospital (St. Mark&#x27;s) in the late 19th century. The Intertribal Powwow at Liberty Park in Salt Lake City honors the cultural heritage and contributions of the area&#x27;s Native Americans, helping Utahns to gain a deeper understanding of the region&#x27;s history.

==History==
The earliest precursor to Pioneer Day celebrations in Utah occurred on July 24, 1849, when the Nauvoo Brass Band led a commemoration of the second anniversary of the Latter-day Saints entering the Salt Lake Valley.

The celebration of Pioneer Day in 1857 was interrupted with news of the approach of Johnston&#x27;s Army, heralding the beginning of the Utah War. Immediately following the occupation of the Utah Territory by federal troops, Pioneer Day was sparsely celebrated. Pioneer Day continually expanded into the surrounding areas as the Mormon Corridor spread throughout the Intermountain West. In 1880, Latter-day Saints commemorated the Golden Jubilee of the church&#x27;s formal organization in 1830; tens of thousands of people in hundreds of communities participated in enthusiastic celebrations.

In the years that followed, federal enforcement efforts of anti-polygamy laws (including the 1882 Edmunds Act) resulted in greatly subdued celebrations. The 1886 commemoration was particularly notable for its mourning theme, with the Salt Lake Tabernacle decorated in black instead of the usually colorful bunting, and the eulogizing of Latter-day Saints who were in hiding or imprisoned for polygamy offenses. By 1897, the celebration included not only the 50th anniversary of the initial arrival in the Salt Lake Valley, but also the end of the polygamy issue, the completion of the Salt Lake Temple, and statehood for Utah.

The centennial in 1947 and the sesquicentennial in 1997 were especially large celebrations in Utah. One writer indicated that the 1947 celebrations seemed to incorporate the entire year, with July 24 only being an apex to the events.

The holiday generates a great deal of road traffic; Utah Department of Public Safety statistics states Pioneer Day has the second highest holiday traffic fatality rate in Utah, with the earlier July 4 Independence Day having the highest rate.

The holiday has received criticism for its lack of inclusiveness for non-Mormons. As a result, a small, growing contingent has started celebrating Pie and Beer Day instead of the traditional Pioneer Day. Pie and Beer day is a play on words: &quot;pie and beer&quot; sounds like &quot;pioneer.&quot; Pie and Beer Day was created as a counter culture alternative.

<doc id="567679" wikidata="Q2044560" url="?curid=567679" title="Sylheti language">
<text>Sylheti (Sylheti Nagri: , &quot;síloṭi&quot;, ; , &quot;sileṭi&quot;, ) is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by an estimated 11 million people, primarily in the Sylhet Division of Bangladesh, Barak Valley of Assam, and northern parts of Tripura in India. Besides, there are substantial numbers of Sylheti speakers in the Indian states of Meghalaya, Manipur, and Nagaland as well as diaspora communities in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and the Middle East.

It is variously perceived as either a dialect of Bengali or a language in its own right. While most linguists consider it an independent language, for many native speakers Sylheti forms the diglossic vernacular, with standard Bengali forming the codified lect. Some incorrectly consider it as a &quot;corrupt&quot; form of Bengali, and there is a reported language shift from Sylheti to Standard Bengali in Bangladesh, India and the diaspora; though Sylheti has more vitality than Standard Bengali among the diaspora in the United Kingdom.

==Name==

&quot;Sylheti&quot; is eponymously named after Sylhet, referring to the dialect or language spoken of that area. According to the vernacular &quot;was&quot; called &quot;Sylhettia&quot; by the Europeans after the town of Sylhet. Though the speakers at that time referred to it as &quot;Jaintiapuri&quot;, &quot;Purba Srihattiya&quot;, or &quot;Ujania&quot; with the latter meaning &quot;the language of the upper country&quot;.

Sylheti is also spelt or known as &quot;Sylhetti&quot; (or &quot;Sileti&quot;), &quot;Sylheti Bangla&quot; and &quot;Siloti&quot; (also spelt in &quot;Syloti&quot; or &quot;Syloty&quot;).

==History==
Sylheti belongs to the Eastern Indo-Aryan languages, that evolved from Magadhi Prakrit. The lowlands around Sylhet were originally inhabited by ancient Khasi people (Austroasiatic); and the earliest known Indo-Aryan settlements were made in the 6th century under Kamarupa king. Sylhet (Srihatta) then emerged as a center of lowland territorialism after the 10th century. The 11th century Bhatera grants from the Srihatta kings Kesavadeva and Isanadeva were written in Sanskrit. Another notable copper plate inscription was found in the village of Paschimbhag in Rajnagar, Moulvibazar that was issued by King Srichandra during the 10th century.

The Muslim Conquest of Sylhet in 1303 CE extended the migratory movements of Muslims from western lands, who settled among the native population and greatly influenced the local language. Thus Sylheti derived a large number of words from Persian and Arabic, cultivating the Perso-Arabic influence on the vernacular. A script was developed in the region called Sylheti Nagri, which primarily focused on disseminating Sufi poetry, known as &quot;puthi&quot;. Its earliest known work had been written during the 1600s, called &quot;Bhedsar&quot; by Syed Shah Husayn Alam. The literature was transcribed in the standard form of late Middle Bengali, it was similar to the &quot;Dobhashi&quot; idiom though phonologically was strongly influenced by Sylheti. The script was read and taught culturally among households and was not institutionalised, as the Islamic dynasties who ruled over Bengal established Persian alongside Arabic as the official languages. Printed texts of the script reached its peak during the late 19th century, however its use became obsolete by around the middle of the 20th century.

In 1903, Grierson reported that Sylheti was spoken only around Sylhet town of the then Sylhet district (now Sylhet Division and Karimganj district in Assam), and that among the Indo-Aryan speakers in the district, about 33 per cent spoke this language.

The earliest appearance of a documentation of Sylheti vocabulary was in the &quot;Government Report on the History and Statistics of Sylhet District&quot; by T. Walton, B.C.S. in 1857, which contained a list of peculiar words used in Sylhet. Many terms that were listed here differ from modern Sylheti – highlighting its evolution. In 1868, another short glossary of local terms in various districts of the Dacca Division (which included Sylhet) were written up and compared to standard Bengali to allow ease in understanding local vernaculars. Despite being annexed to the Assam Province during colonial rule, Sylheti speakers felt a linguistic affinity with the rest of Bengal. Bengali literature had some influence from Sylheti, popular songwriters or poets such as Hason Raja or Shah Abdul Karim, significantly contributed to the literature. Sylhet was reunited with Bengal following a referendum in 1947.

==Status==
According to Simard, Dopierala and Thaut, Sylheti is a &quot;minoritised, politically unrecognised, and understudied language.&quot; It is currently not officially recognised as a language in either Bangladesh or India. Many native speakers consider it to be a &quot;slang&quot; or corrupt version of Standard Bengali and not an independent language; and there is a reported language shift to Standard Bengali and a decrease in the number of native speakers since parents are not teaching it to their children. In Bangladesh, there is a diglossia where Sylheti is one among other low status regional dialects while Standard Bengali, the official language, has a high status.

In the Indian state of Assam where Assamese is the state language, Standard Bengali language serves as an additional official language in its Barak Valley districts; which host a majority Sylheti-speaking population.

In the United Kingdom, British schools have begun enlisting Sylheti in their syllabi. BBC News has also broadcast online videos relating to COVID-19 in five major South Asian languages including Sylheti.

 notes that the language of eastern Sylhet is not intelligible to Bengalis from the west, though he still classed it as Bengali, grouping it under &quot;Eastern Bengali&quot;. too calls it a dialect of Bengali and places it in the eastern Vangiya group of Magadhi Prakrit and notes that all Bengali dialects were independent of each other and did not emanate from the literary Bengali called &quot;sadhu bhasha&quot;. Among the different eastern dialect groups, Sylheti and Chittagonian have phonetic and morphological properties that are alien to standard Bengali and other western dialects of Bengali, and these differences are such that Sylheti is more distant to standard Bengali than is Assamese.

Recent scholarship notes that these morpho-phonological and mutual intelligibility differences are significant enough that Sylheti could claim itself as a language on its own right. Ethnologue groups Sylheti in Bengali–Assamese languages; whereas Glottolog gives further subgrouping and places it in the &quot;Eastern Bengali&quot; group alongside Hajong, separately from the Bengali dialects.

=== Language-dialect controversy ===
The classification of Sylheti is contentious—Chalmers (1996) suggested that it was generally identified as a dialect of Bengali though there were efforts to recognise it as a language. Grierson had classified Sylheti as an Eastern Bengali dialect and had noted that it &quot;possess all the peculiar characteristics of the extreme Eastern Bengali type.&quot; Anecdotal evidence suggests that Sylhetis, who could also speak in Standard Bengali, considered the two languages to be mutually intelligible. On the basis of the anecdotal evidence of mutual intelligibility, regionality and the fact that Sylheti is spoken by a predominantly rural community, concludes that Sylheti could be considered a dialect of Bengali. Simard, Dopierala and Thaut have pointed out that the intelligibility could be an effect of prior exposure of Sylheti speakers to Standard Bengali, and that the academic consensus is that mutual intelligibility ranges from &quot;unintelligible&quot; to &quot;hardly intelligible&quot;. On the basis of phonology and phonetics, lexicon, grammatical structure and a lack of mutual intelligibility, some recent linguists claim that Sylheti is not merely a dialectal variation of Bengali but a language in its own right.

Phonologically Sylheti is distinguished from Standard Bengali and other regional varieties by significant deaspiration and spirantisation, leading to major restructuring of the consonant inventory and the development of tones.

As majority of the diaspora in the United Kingdom speak Sylheti, it created an environment that was somewhat uninfluenced by Standard Bengali, inevitably leading some to view Sylheti as a distinct language. During the 1980s there were unsuccessful attempts to recognise Sylheti as a language in its own right by a small group in the London borough of Tower Hamlets, which lacked support from the Sylheti community itself.

==Literature==

&quot;Halat-un-Nabi&quot;, a puthi written by Sadeq Ali is considered to be the most prominent literature in Sylheti Nagri.

The presence and influence of Shah Jalal and Shri Chaitanya dev is found in the Sylheti literature. According to Syed Mostafa Kamal, (approximately 1650 AD) the Baul tradition was founded based on the combination of Chaitanyavad and Jaganmohani ideologies, that mystic literature influenced and seen in the Vaishnava Padavali. As a result, Sylhet is considered as the spiritual capital of mysticism and the fertile land of Baul music. A great number of poets enriched Sylheti literature. Among them, Hason Raja, Radha Raman, Syed Shah Noor, Shitalong Shaha, Durbin Shaha are noteworthy. The main theme of the Nagri literature are mainly religious, Islamic history, tradition, stories, Raga, Baul and mystic music. There have been 140 books have found, including 88 printed books in Sylheti Nagri script.

==Writing system==

Sylheti currently does not have a standardised writing system. Historically in the Sylhet region, the Sylheti Nagri script was used alongside the Bengali script. Sylheti Nagri was however mostly limited to writing religious poetry. The script often avoided tatsama (Sanskrit-derived terms) and incorporated Perso-Arabic vocabulary. Additionally, Sylheti Nagri texts were traditionally paginated from right to left. It is claimed by some that the orthography of the script equates with Sylheti, due to the fewer characters compared with the Bengali script as there are fewer phonemes found in Sylheti. An endangered script, it has since seen a revival mostly by academics and linguists.

Standard Bengali is the medium of instruction in Bangladesh. some may therefore write in Sylheti using the Bengali–Assamese script. In United Kingdom, publishers use Latin script for Sylheti and according to the Sylheti Translation and Research (STAR), Latin (Roman) script is the most &quot;used&quot; script for writing Sylheti. The New Testament in Sylheti was published in the Sylhet Nagri script along with versions in the Latin and in the Bengali–Assamese script, in 2014.

==Geographical distribution==

Sylheti is the primary language of the Sylhet Division in north-eastern Bangladesh, with its concentration mostly in the districts of Sylhet, Moulvibazar, &quot;eastern&quot; Sunamganj and &quot;north-eastern&quot; Habiganj. Recent findings assert that the local dialect spoken in much of the Habiganj district differs quite significantly from Sylheti.

Sylheti is also widely spoken in the southern Assam region of Barak Valley, India, which includes the districts of Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj. In addition, it is spoken in the northern parts of Tripura and Jiribam, Manipur. There is also a significant population of Sylheti speakers in Hojai district of Central Assam, Shillong in Meghalaya, and the state of Nagaland. A few numbers are also located in Kolkata, most of whom are migrants from Assam.

Outside the Indian subcontinent, the largest grouping of Sylheti speakers reside in the United Kingdom, of which 95 percent of British Bangladeshis have origins from the Sylhet region. It is estimated there are around 400,000 Sylheti speakers in the UK. The largest concentration live in east London boroughs, such as Tower Hamlets. There are also significant numbers of speakers in the United States, most are concentrated in New York City, and in Hamtramck, Michigan where majority of Bangladeshi Americans there are of Sylheti origin. There are also small numbers located in Toronto, Canada. Significant Sylheti-speaking communities reside in the Middle East of which most are migrant workers, and in many other countries throughout the world.

==Lexicon==
Sylheti shares most linguistic properties with Standard Bengali, with a lexical similarity of 53.2%. 

==Phonology==
The phoneme inventory of Sylheti differs from both Standard Rarhi Bengali as well as the typical Bangladeshi Standard. It is characterised by a loss of breathiness and aspiration contrasts, leading to a significant reduction in its phoneme inventory and to the development of tones. In particular, the following developments are seen:
* Both voiced and voiceless aspirated stops have become unaspirated ( → ; → ).
* The voiceless labials have spirantised to homorganic fricatives ( → ; → ).
* The velar stops have become velar fricatives ( → ; → ), although can be heard as an allophone of when preceded by high vowels .
* The post-alveolar affricates have spirantised to alveolar fricatives ( → ; → ; → ; → ).
* Among the voiceless stops only the dental /, / and retroflex /, / stops have remained stops. In some analyses, the dental–retroflex distinction (/, /) is replaced by highly unusual dental–alveolar one (/, /).

===Tone===
Sylheti is tonal. This is rare among the Indo-Aryan languages, but not unheard of, e.g. in Punjabi, Dogri, Chittagonian, Gawri (Kalam Kohistani), Torwali, some Eastern Bengali varieties, etc. There are two types of tonal contrasts in Sylheti: the emergence of high tone in the vowels following the loss of aspiration, and a level tone elsewhere.

A more recent study shows that there is a three-way tonal system in Sylheti words with two syllables or more. According to this analysis, words with aspiration in the final syllable historically gain a high tone across the word, whilst those with initial aspiration have this replaced by a low tone across the word. Those with no historical aspirated consonants retain a mid tone.

It is considered that these tones arose when aspirated consonants lost their aspiration. Sylheti continues to have a long history of coexisting with tonal Tibeto-Burman languages including various dialects of Kokborok such as Reang. Even though there is no clear evidence of direct borrowing of lexical items from those languages into Sylheti, there is still a possibility that the emergence of Sylheti tones is due to external influence, as the indigenous speakers of Tibeto-Burman languages by and large use Sylheti as a common medium for interaction.

==Grammar==
Sylheti grammar is the study of the morphology and syntax of Sylheti.

===Nouns===

====Case====
When a definite article such as &quot;-gu/ţa&quot; (singular) or &quot;-guin/ţin&quot; (plural) is added, nouns are also inflected for number. Below are two tables which show the inflections of an animate noun, (&#x27;student&#x27;), and an inanimate noun, (&#x27;shoe&#x27;).
All of the inflected nouns above have an indefinite article preceding their case markers. There are some basic rules to keep in mind about the cases, apart from the &quot;default&quot; nominative.

For the genitive case, the ending may change, though never with a definite article attached. A noun (without an article) which ends in a consonant or the inherent vowel, &quot;ô&quot;, is inflected by adding -&quot;ôr&quot; to the end of the word (and deleting the inherent vowel if applicable). An example of this would be the genitive of &quot;gus&quot; &#x27;meat&#x27; being &quot;gusôr &#x27;of meat&#x27; or &#x27;(the) meat&#x27;s&#x27;. A noun which ends in any vowel apart from the inherent vowel will just have a -&quot;r&quot; following it, as in the genitive of &quot;fua&quot; being &quot;fuar &#x27;(the) boy&#x27;s&#x27;. The genitive ending is also applied to verbs (in their verbal noun forms), which is most commonly seen when using postpositions (for example: &quot;hiknôr&quot; &quot;lagi&quot;, &#x27;for learning&#x27;).

For the locative case, the marker also changes in a similar fashion to the genitive case, with consonants and the inherent vowel having their own ending, -&quot;ô&quot;, and all other vowels having another ending, -&quot;t&quot;. For example, &quot;silôţô&quot; &#x27;in Sylhet&#x27;, &quot;dáxát&quot; &#x27;in Dhaka&#x27;, etc.

====Measure words====
When counted, nouns must also be accompanied by the appropriate measure word. The noun&#x27;s measure word (MW) must be used in between the numeral and the noun. Most nouns take the generic measure word &quot;gu/ţa/xán&quot;, although there are many more specific measure words, such as &quot;zôn&quot;, which is only used to count humans.

Measuring nouns in Sylheti without their corresponding measure words (e.g. &quot;aţ mekur&quot; instead of &quot;aţ-gu mekur&quot; &#x27;eight cats&#x27;) would typically be considered ungrammatical. However, omitting the noun and preserving the measure word is grammatical and not uncommon to hear. For example, &quot;Xáli êx-zôn táxbô.&quot; (lit. &#x27;Only one-MW will remain.&#x27;) would be understood to mean &#x27;Only one person will remain.&#x27;, since &quot;zôn&quot; can only be used to count humans.

===Pronouns===

==== Personal pronouns ====
Sylheti personal pronouns are somewhat similar to English pronouns, having different words for first, second, and third person, and also for singular and plural (unlike for verbs, below). Sylheti pronouns, like their English counterparts, do differentiate for gender. Sylheti has different third-person pronouns for proximity. The first are used for someone who is nearby, and the second are for those who are a little further away. The third are usually for those who are not present. In addition, each of the second- and third-person pronouns have different forms for the familiar and polite forms; the second person also has a &quot;very familiar&quot; form (sometimes called &quot;despective&quot;). It may be noted that the &quot;very familiar&quot; form is used when addressing particularly close friends or family as well as for addressing subordinates, or in abusive language. In the following tables, the abbreviations used are as follows: VF=very familiar, F=familiar, and P=polite (honor); H=here, T=there, E=elsewhere (proximity), and I=inanimate.

The nominative case is used for pronouns that are the subject of the sentence, such as &quot;I already did that&quot; or &quot;Will you please stop making that noise?&quot;
The objective case is used for pronouns serving as the direct or indirect objects, such as &quot;I told him to wash the dishes&quot; or &quot;The teacher gave me the homework assignment&quot;. The inanimate pronouns remain the same in the objective case.

The possessive case is used to show possession, such as &quot;Where is your coat?&quot; or &quot;Let&#x27;s go to our house&quot;. In addition, sentences such as &quot;I have a book&quot; () or &quot;I need money&quot; () also use the possessive (the literal translation of the Bengali versions of these sentences would be &quot;There is my book&quot; and &quot;There is my need for money&quot; respectively).

==== Indefinite and negative pronouns ====
Bengali has no negative pronouns (such as &quot;no one, nothing, none&quot;). These are typically represented by adding the negative particle (&quot;nae&quot;) to indefinite pronouns, which are themselves derived from their corresponding question words. Common indefinite pronouns are listed below.
==== Relative pronouns ====
The relative pronoun (&quot;ze&quot;) and its different variants, as shown below, are commonly employed in complex sentences. The relative pronouns for animate objects change for number and honour, but those for inanimate objects stay the same.

=== Adjectives ===
Adjectives do not inflect for case, gender, or number in Sylheti and are placed before the noun they modify.

Some adjectives form their opposites by prefixing &quot;be-&quot; , or sometimes &quot;ni-&quot;; for example, the opposite of (&quot;ruzgar&quot;, &#x27;earning&#x27;) is (&quot;beruzgar&quot;, &#x27;not earning, idle, mendicant&#x27;), the opposite of (&quot;xama&quot;, &#x27;of use&#x27;) is (&quot;nixama&quot;, &#x27;useless, of no use&#x27;).

Demonstrative adjectives – &#x27;this&#x27; and &#x27;that&#x27; – correspond to &quot;i, ô/ôu&quot; and &quot;hi, hô/hou&quot;, with the definite article attached to the following noun. Thus, &#x27;this book&#x27; would translate to &quot;i boi-xan&quot;, while &#x27;those books&#x27; would translate to &quot;hi boi-gisin/boi-gun/boi-ain&quot;.

==== Comparatives and superlatives ====
Sylheti adjectives form their comparative forms with (&quot;arô&quot;, &#x27;more&#x27;), and their superlative forms with (&quot;shôb táki&quot;, &#x27;than all&#x27;). Comparisons are formed by using genitive form of the object of comparison, followed by the postposition (&quot;táki/tóni&quot;, &#x27;than&#x27;) or the postposition (&quot;laxan&quot;, &#x27;like&#x27;) and then by (&quot;arô&quot;, &#x27;more&#x27;) or (&quot;xôm&quot;, &#x27;less&#x27;). The word for &#x27;more&#x27; is optional, but the word for &#x27;less&#x27; is required, so in its absence &#x27;more&#x27; is inferred. Adjectives can be additionally modified by using (&quot;bolon/bakka/bout&quot;, &#x27;much&#x27;) or (&quot;bout&quot;, &#x27;much&#x27;), which are especially useful for comparing quantities.
===Verbs===
Sylheti verbs are highly inflected and are regular with only few exceptions. They consist of a stem and an ending; they are traditionally listed in Sylheti dictionaries in their &quot;verbal noun&quot; form, which is usually formed by adding &quot;-a, - ni, -na&quot; to the stem: for instance, (&quot;xani, to eat&quot;) is formed from the stem and similarly (&quot;xôra/ xôrna, to do&quot;) is formed from the stem . The stem can end in either a vowel or a consonant. Verbs are conjugated for tense and person by changing the endings, which are largely the same for all verbs. However, the stem vowel can often change as part of the phenomenon known as vowel harmony, whereby one vowel can be influenced by other vowels in the word to sound more harmonious. An example would be the verb &quot;to write&quot;, with stem &quot;lex-&quot;: (&quot;lexô,&quot; &#x27;you all write&#x27;) but also (&quot;lekí,&quot; &#x27;we write&#x27;). If verbs are classified by stem vowel and if the stem ends in a consonant or vowel, there are nine basic classes in which most verbs can be placed; all verbs in a class will follow the same pattern. A prototype verb from each of these classes will be used to demonstrate conjugation for that class; bold will be used to indicate mutation of the stem vowel. Additionally, there are irregular verbs, such as (&quot;zani&quot;, to go) that change the first consonant in their stem in certain conjugations.

Like many other Indo-Aryan languages (such as Standard Bengali or Assamese), nouns can be turned into verbs by combining them with select auxiliary verbs. In Sylheti, the most common such auxiliary verb is (&quot;xôra, &quot;&#x27;to do&#x27;); thus, verbs such as &quot;joke&quot; are formed by combining the noun form of &quot;joke&quot; () with &quot;to do&quot; () to create . When conjugating such verbs the noun part of such a verb is left untouched, so in the previous example, only would be inflected or conjugated (e.g.: &quot;I will make a joke&quot; becomes ; see more on tenses below). Other auxiliary verbs include and , but the verb enjoys significant usage because it can be combined with foreign verbs to form a native version of the verb, even if a direct translation exists. Most often this is done with English verbs: for example, &quot;to vote&quot; is often referred to as (, where is the transliteration of &quot;vote&quot;).

==== Copula ====
Sylheti is considered a zero copula language in some aspects.
* In the simple present tense there is no verb connecting the subject to the predicative (the &quot;zero verb&quot; copula). There is one notable exception, however, which is when the predicative takes on the existential, locative, or possessive aspects; for such purposes, the incomplete verb (&quot;as&quot;) is used, which is conjugated according to the rules given below.
* In the past tense, the incomplete verb is always used as the copula, regardless of the nature of the predicative.
* For the future tense and non-finite structures, the copula is supplied by the verb (&quot;ówa&quot;), with the only exception being the possessive predicative for which the verb (&quot;táxa&quot;, &#x27;to remain&#x27;) is utilised.

The following table demonstrates the rules above with some examples.
==== Negation ====
There are three sentence negators employed in Sylheti:
* The zero verb copula is negated using the incomplete negator , which is conjugated as (1), (2), (3).
* Existential sentences that use the verb are negated with (&quot;nai&quot;), which does not need to be conjugated.
* All other verbs (with the exceptions of the ones listed above) are negated using the universal negative particle (&quot;nae&quot;). is typically placed after the finite verb (see examples below), but can also be placed at the end of the sentence, which negates the whole sentence. can be used in all tenses except two: the present perfect and the past perfect.
* Verbs in the present perfect and the past perfect tenses are negated using the suffix (&quot;na&quot;) which can also refer to &quot;no&quot; in yes–no questions.

====Person====
Verbs are inflected for person and honour, but not for number. There are five forms: first person, second person (very familiar), second person (familiar), third person (familiar), and second/third person (polite). The same sample subject pronouns will be used for all the example conjugation paradigms: (), (), (), (), (), () and (). These have the following plurals respectively: (), (), (), ()/ (), ()/ () and ().

==Comparison==

A notable characteristic of spoken Sylheti is the correspondence of the and , pronounced as a voiceless velar fricative to the or of Bengali and voiceless glottal fricative to the /x/ of Assamese respectively.

===Comparison with Standard Bengali===
A phrase in:
*Standard Bengali: .
*Sylheti: &quot;ex deshôr gail arôx deshôr mát&quot;.

which literally means &#x27;one land&#x27;s obscenity is another land&#x27;s language&#x27;, and can be roughly translated to convey that a similar word in one language can mean something very different in another.

Another example:
* in Standard Bengali means &#x27;cloud&#x27;.
* in Eastern Bengali means &#x27;rain&#x27; or &#x27;cloud&#x27;.
* /মেঘ &quot;megh&quot; in Sylheti means &#x27;rain&#x27;.
* In Pali, मेघ &quot;megha&quot; means both &#x27;rain&#x27; and &#x27;cloud&#x27;.

<doc id="567681" wikidata="Q2827965" url="?curid=567681" title="Winger (ice hockey)">
<text>Winger, in the game of ice hockey, is a forward position of a player whose primary zone of play is along the outer playing areas. They typically flank the centre forward. Originally the name was given to forward players who went up and down the sides of the rink. Wingers generally have the least defensive responsibilities out of any position on the ice, however they are still tasked with defensive duties such as forechecking duties or covering the point in the defensive zone. 

Nowadays, there are different types of wingers in the game — out-and-out goal scorers, checkers who disrupt the opponents, and forwards who work along the boards and in the corners. Often a winger&#x27;s precise role on a line depends upon what type of role the other winger plays; usually lines will have one more goal-scoring oriented winger and one winger more focused on playing the boards, checking and passing the puck to others to take shots (if a larger player, he will sometimes be called a &quot;power forward&quot;). 

This position is commonly referred to by the side of the rink that the winger normally takes, i.e. &quot;left wing&quot; or &quot;right wing.&quot; The side of the rink the player played on traditionally related to the side of their body they take a shot from (i.e. left-shooting playing left wing) but in recent decades more wingers have played the &quot;off wing&quot; meaning the opposite side of the direction they shoot, which enables faster release shots if receiving a pass while standing stationary in the offensive zone.

== Offensive zone play ==
The wingers&#x27; responsibilities in the offensive zone include the following:
*finding open space for a pass from their teammates
*intercepting a pass to the opposing defenceman
*attacking the opposing defencemen when they have the puck

== Defensive zone play ==

Wingers often will be playing high in the zone (close to the blue line), typically covering the defensemen of the opposing team, meaning they block passes from going to the defencemen and block shots from the defenceman. Wingers should always be vigilant for a breakout pass or a chance to chip the puck past the defenceman of the opposing team across the blue line. When wingers receive a pass along the boards, they can exercise a number of options:

*Bank the puck off the boards or glass to get it out of the zone
*Redirect or softly pass the puck to a teammate advancing into the neutral zone who can then choose to set up an attack, or dump the puck into the offensive zone to allow either a line change or for teammates to further attack the defenders
*Carry the puck themselves into the offensive zone to attempt a breakaway or an odd-man rush, where the attacking team advances with more players close to the puck than there are defenders

Wingers should typically not:
*play deep in their defensive zone
*help out their teammates along the boards

==Backchecking==
Wingers are typically the last players to backcheck out of the offensive zone. On the backcheck, it is essential that they cover the last free opposing player rushing in. Once the puck is controlled by the opposing team in the defensive zone, however, wingers are responsible for covering the defenceman on their side of the ice.

==Face-offs==
Prior to the puck being dropped for a face-off, players other than those taking the face-off must not make any physical contact with players on the opposite team, nor enter the face-off circle (where marked). After the puck is dropped, it is essential for wingers to engage the opposing players to prevent them from obtaining possession of the puck.

Once a team has established control of the puck, wingers can set themselves up into an appropriate position.

Some wingers are also employed to handle faceoffs.

<doc id="567683" wikidata="Q6972579" url="?curid=567683" title="National Federation Party">
<text>The National Federation Party (Fiji Hindi: नेशनल फेडरेशन पार्टी; Fijian: &quot;Mataisoqosoqo ni National Federation&quot;) is a Fijian political party founded by A. D. Patel in November 1968, as a merger of the Federation Party and the National Democratic Party. Though it claims to represent all Fiji Islanders, it is supported, in practice, almost exclusively by Indo-Fijians whose ancestors had come to Fiji between 1879 and 1916, mostly as indentured labourers. However, in the 2018 general election, the party recorded a considerable change in its support base due to the inclusion of more indigenous Fijian candidates.

== History ==

=== The formation of the Federation Party and the 1965 conference ===
The formation of the Federation Party was a direct consequence of the dispute between cane farmers and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company (CSR) in 1960 regarding the new cane contract. Farmers contested the 1963 Legislative Council election under the banner of Citizens Federation. This party was reconstituted as the Federation Party on 21 June 1964, with A. D. Patel as president and Sidiq Koya as vice-president. The merger took place in time for the party to participate in the 1965 constitutional conference which was called to map out a path towards independence from the United Kingdom. The British Government decided to introduce cross-voting as a compromise between the Fijian and European delegates on one side and the Indians on the other; nine of the 36 seats on the Legislative Council would be elected by universal suffrage, but allocated by ethnicity, divided equally among Fijians, Indians, and general electors (which consist of Caucasians, Chinese, and other minorities). The Legislative Council was enlarged to 36 members, consisting of 14 Fijians (9 elected on communal roll, 3 on cross-voting roll and two nominated by the Great Council of Chiefs), 12 Indians (9 elected on communal roll and 3 on cross-voting roll) and 10 Europeans (7 elected on communal roll and 3 on cross-voting roll). Some of the non-contentious proposals by the Federation Party were accepted. These were the establishment of a Public Service Commission, a Police Service Commission, and a Judicial and Legal Services Commission, as well as a Bill of Rights.

=== From 1966 until the death of A.D. Patel ===
The outcome of the constitutional conference was a major issue during the election, which was the first election in Fiji contested on Party lines. The Federation Party was expected to win at least the three cross-voting seats in the western division because of its predominantly Indian population but managed to win only the 9 Indian communal seats. The Alliance Party won 22 seats but the three independents and the two Council of Chiefs nominees joined it to give it a total strength of 27. Ratu Kamisese Mara of the Alliance Party became the Chief Minister and A.D. Patel became the Leader of the Opposition.

Ethnic tensions escalated following the adoption of responsible government in 1967, when Patel&#x27;s arch-rival, the Lauan chief Ratu Kamisese Mara was appointed Chief Minister on 20 September. Mara&#x27;s Alliance Party was a coalition of indigenous and European factions, with minimal Indo-Fijian participation. Patel and the NFP were consigned to the opposition benches. In protest at the new government&#x27;s refusal to call a second constitutional conference, Patel led the nine Federation Party legislators in a mass walkout in September 1967. Missing two consecutive sections of the Legislative Council resulted in the forfeit of their seats, forcing by-elections. The ensuing by-elections were marked by inter-ethnic violence. All nine Federation Party legislators were returned with increased majorities, winning 78.55% of the votes cast. A.D. Patel won by 7903 votes to 2772 for Manikam Pillai. There were demonstrations by ethnic Fijians and calls to not renew native land leases and extreme elements called for Indians to be deported from Fiji. Relations between the Indo-Fijian and indigenous communities were at a new low.

=== The Formation of the National Federation Party ===
In November 1968, the Federation merged with the National Democratic Party to form the National Federation Party. Patel and Koya became the President and Vice-President, respectively, of the merged party. Apisai Tora and Isikeli Nadalo, both indigenous Fijians, were leading figures in the NDP, and the merger brought well-known Fijians into the party for the first time. The attempt to position itself as a multi-racial party failed to translate into significant electoral support in the indigenous Fijian community. The NFP never succeeded in getting ten percent of the Fijian vote at any poll. It did, however, manage to elect several Fijians to what became the House of Representatives after independence in 1970, owing to cross-voting in the renamed national constituencies.

Less than a year after the founding of the NFP, Patel died suddenly on 1 October 1969. His deputy, Siddiq Moidin Koya, succeeded him as party leader.

=== NFP under the leadership of Sidiq Koya ===

==== NFP and Alliance work together to attain independence ====
The party played an important role in the negotiations that led to Fiji&#x27;s independence from the United Kingdom in 1970. Their original demand for a universal franchise threatened to stall the independence process, but at a conference in London in April 1970, Sidiq Koya, eventually negotiated a compromise with Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, the leader of the Alliance Party, the main ethnic Fijian-dominated party. According to this compromise, ethnic Fijians and Indo-Fijians would each be allocated 22 seats, with 12 representing &quot;Communal constituencies&quot; (comprising voters registered as members of a particular ethnic group) and a further 10 representing &quot;National constituencies&quot; (distributed by ethnicity but elected by universal suffrage) in the 52 member House of Representatives. A further 8 seats would be reserved for General electors (Europeans, Chinese, and other minorities); 3 of these would be &quot;communal&quot; and 5 &quot;national.&quot;

With the leaders of both major ethnic groups working together for the first time in Fiji&#x27;s history, the transition to independence was peaceful and the euphoria of independence continued for some time. Sidiq Koya travelled with the Prime Minister to India and the United Nations and there was talk of a coalition government. There were those within the National Federation Party (NFP) who were not happy with the close relationship between Sidiq Koya and Ratu Kamisese Mara, the most notable of whom was R. D. Patel, but for the time being dissent was not being expressed openly.

==== The 1972 general election ====
The first general election since independence was held in May 1972 without the ethnic tension characteristic of the 1966 general election and the 1968 by-elections. The NFP won only 19 of the 52 seats in the House of Representatives, with Alliance Party actually increasing its share of the Indian vote. After the election, R.D. Patel, one of Koya&#x27;s critics within the NFP, was elected speaker of the House of Representatives.

==== Worsening relationship between Koya and Mara ====
From mid-1975, the relationship between Koya and Mara worsened. This was firstly due to the announcement by the Minister of Education that the Government would not subsidise school fees for non-Fijians. Sidiq Koya called this &quot;a blatant piece of racial injustice&quot;. Secondly when a former Alliance member moved a motion calling for the repatriation of people of Indian origin back to India, Koya was not happy with the measured response of the Alliance Government and accused it of &quot;having elements which wanted to do legally what the Fijian Nationalist Party Leader, Sakeasi Butadroka, was trying to do illegally.&quot; Thirdly, the Prime Minister rejected the recommendations of the Royal Commission which investigated the voting system, claiming that implementation of the recommendation would cause bloodshed in the country.

==== Split within NFP ====
The inability of the NFP to make significant inroads into the ethnic Fijian vote kept the party in opposition in the years following independence. In the March 1977 election, however, a split in the ethnic Fijian vote enabled the NFP to win a plurality in the House of Representatives. Internal dissension, however, prevented the party from forming a government, as the party fractured over disputes about the leadership and the allocation of ministerial positions. The Governor-General, &quot;Ratu Sir&quot; George Cakobau, reappointed the defeated Prime Minister, Ratu Mara, and ordered a new election for September that year, in which the NFP was heavily defeated. For more information, see Fiji Constitutional Crisis of 1977.

=== NFP under the leadership of Jai Ram Reddy ===
A second election to resolve the impasse was held in September that year, resulting in a heavy defeat for the NFP after it had split into two factions known as the Dove and Flower factions. Koya lost his parliamentary seat to Jai Ram Reddy, who became the new leader of the NFP. Koya&#x27;s Dove faction had won only 3 seats compared to 12 won by the Flower faction.

Reddy followed a policy, which had been tried once before by Koya, that of moderation in which he sought to work with the Alliance Party to bring about change instead of resorting to the divisive policies of A.D. Patel and the later years of Koya&#x27;s leadership. He enjoyed a brief period of honeymoon with the Alliance and there was again talk of a coalition. Relations between the two sides deteriorated as the Alliance used its massive majority to push through legislations seen to be anti-Indian. In 1980, after Reddy criticised, Alliance&#x27;s policy of reserving Crown land for use by ethnic Fijians only, he and Ratu Kamisese Mara were no longer on speaking terms.

The NFP re-united for the 1982 elections and came close to winning the election by winning 24 seats in coalition with the Western United Front (WUF). Reddy&#x27;s disagreement with the Alliance Speaker of the House led to his walkout in December 1983 and to resignation from parliament in April 1984.

=== Sidiq Koya&#x27;s second term as party leader ===
Sidiq Koya, who had returned to Parliament in 1982 under a unified NFP, was elected the leader following Reddy&#x27;s resignation. He was not far from controversy, and was accused of favouring his own supporters for crucial appointments within the party. He barred the NFP Youth Wing from a Working Committee meeting further raising allegations of dictatorial rule.

Internal dissension reached a climax when a Koya supporter from Ba, Dr Balwant Singh Rakkha, was selected to contest the Lautoka seat vacated by Reddy&#x27;s resignation. The NFP Youth Wing, put up its own candidate, Davendra Singh, a little-known small businessman. The NFP Youth Wing had the support of the former Flower faction and also claimed Reddy&#x27;s support. For his part, Reddy did not openly campaign for either candidate. During the campaign, Koya turned the election into a referendum on himself, and threatened to resign if Rakkha lost. The result was a win for Singh by a narrow margin but Koya did not go ahead with his threat.

With the emergence of Fiji Labour Party (FLP), the NFP lost further ground. In the Suva City Council election of October 1985, it failed to field any candidate and the FLP won most seats and occupied the Lord Mayor&#x27;s chair. In the by-election for the North Central National Seat (based in Ba district), brought about by the resignation of Vijay R. Singh, the Alliance won by a narrow margin over the FLP candidate, Mahendra Chaudhry. NFP was placed last. In December 1985, three prominent NFP parliamentarians resigned.

With his party falling apart, Koya resigned from the leadership of the NFP and was replaced by Harish Sharma.

=== Coalition with FLP ===
For the 1987 election, therefore, they formed an electoral coalition with the Fiji Labour Party under the leadership of Timoci Bavadra, an ethnic Fijian. The coalition won the election, but the new government was overthrown a month later in a military coup led by Lieutenant Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka.

A new Constitution was promulgated, providing for a built-in ethnic Fijian majority in the legislature. This condemned the NFP to permanent opposition status. When the government agreed to revise the Constitution in 1997, however, the NFP, now led by Jai Ram Reddy, played a key role in the ensuing negotiations, which resulted in the removal of the guaranteed ethnic Fijian majority from Parliament. In the election that followed in 1999, the NFP surprised many observers by forming an electoral coalition with the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei, led by their former enemy, Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka. This may have been a tactical mistake: many Indo-Fijians had not forgiven Rabuka for his role in the overthrow of the Bavadra government and the subsequent drafting of a constitution that they widely considered to be racist, and the NFP, for the first time in 36 years, lost all of its seats in the House of Representatives.

=== 2000–2006 ===
The NFP contested the 2001 election, on a platform calling for the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to look into the Fiji coup of 2000, which had deposed the elected government of Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, the removal of Value added tax from basic items, reduction of telephone and postal bills, national healthcare insurance for all workers, and consolidation of the independence of the judiciary. Its fortunes sank further, however. The NFP ended up with only about ten percent of the popular vote and only one parliamentary seat – which it subsequently lost in a court challenge. The party&#x27;s refusal to agree to a preference deal with its one-time ally, the Fiji Labour Party, also worked against it. (At the time, Fiji had a system of preferential voting, similar to Australia&#x27;s).

There were subsequently signs of a modest revival of fortunes for the NFP. Municipal elections in October 2003, for which the party formed an electoral coalition with Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase&#x27;s Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL), gave the party control of six municipalities, either in its own right or together with the SDL. Its more significant victories included gaining control of the Nadi Town Council and re-electing Chandu Umaria as Mayor of Suva. In the 2005 municipal polls, their performance was more modest, but Ba and Nadi remained in NFP hands, while an NFP/SDL coalition retained its hold on Sigatoka. In Suva, despite losing some seats, the NFP still out-polled the Fiji Labour Party, its arch-rival for the Indo-Fijian vote.

In the early 2000s, the party attempted to modernise itself. Under the presidency of Dorsami Naidu, the party made an effort to broaden its appeal to women and the disadvantaged. On 11 April 2005, Naidu announced that the NFP now regarded itself as a multiracial party and would attempt to win the support of all ethnic communities in Fiji.

==== The Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill ====
In 2005, the NFP was at the forefront of opposition to the government&#x27;s controversial proposal to establish a Reconciliation and Unity Commission, with the power (subject to presidential approval), to grant compensation to victims of the coup d&#x27;état that deposed the elected government in 2000, and amnesty to persons convicted of offences related to it. On 14 May 2005, Naidu called legislation to establish the commission &quot;an act of terrorism&quot;, and on 20 May he went on to call for public demonstrations against the bill, which he said was &quot;just a cover for providing amnesty to people who committed the May 2000 coup crime acts.&quot; On 27 June, Naidu announced that the NFP had started a petition against the bill, and expected to gather 150,000 signatures. The party was sending copies of the petition, along with a statement of the party&#x27;s objections to the bill in English, Fijian, and Hindustani to all schools, other organisations, and islands in Fiji. Naidu said the party was opposed not only to the amnesty provisions of the legislation, but also to its compensation provisions, saying that the taxpayer should not have to foot the bill. &quot;Those part and parcel of the 2000 coup should have their properties seized and sold to pay compensation to those affected,&quot; Naidu said. He thought, moreover, that those wanting to claim compensation should do so through the courts. He said that the petition would be presented to the parliamentary committee on Justice, Law and Order, along with the party&#x27;s submission.

==== Party conference, July 2005 ====
Naidu resigned from the presidency of the party in July 2005, following his arrest on common assault and sexual assault charges. At the party&#x27;s annual conference attended by more than 600 delegates in Nausori on 31 July, Raman Pratap Singh, a lawyer and former parliamentarian, was elected to replace him.

==== Towards 2006 ====
A priority for the NFP was to attempt to revive sufficient support to gain Parliamentary representation in the general election scheduled for 2006. On 12 August 2005, Pramod Rae said the party was experiencing financial difficulties. Speaking on Radio Sargam, he denied perceptions that the NFP was a &quot;rich man&#x27;s party&quot; and said that sometimes it could not afford telephone bills, and was having to go door to door asking for donations to keep it going. Many businessmen who had once supported the NFP were now supporting the Fiji Labour Party (FLP), he lamented.

Under Fiji&#x27;s so-called alternative ballot system, votes cast for low-polling candidates may be transferred to higher-polling candidates, as specified by the candidates. These transferred votes are known as &quot;preferences.&quot; Rae said on 20 August that in pursuing negotiations with other parties for exchanges of preferences, the NFP would aim to hold the centre ground in Fijian politics and would forge alliances with parties that shared its philosophy. NFP Treasurer Ashok Bal Govind said on 21 October that neither the FLP nor the SDL had &quot;good policies,&quot; and that the NFP would wait to see whether parties with &quot;better policies&quot; emerged before deciding on any electoral pacts. In the end, the NFP made arrangements with FLP candidates in some constituencies, and with SDL candidates in others.

===== Negotiations with the SDL =====
At the August conference, the party decided that a preference deal with the ruling SDL in the parliamentary election scheduled for 2006 would be conditional on the government withdrawing its Reconciliation and Unity Bill. In the last election in 2001, a similar deal, which allowed votes cast for low-polling NFP candidates to be transferred to the SDL, was crucial to the SDL victory under Fiji&#x27;s transferable voting system. &quot;You are in power today because of our preferential votes NFP gave you in 2001,&quot; said Pramod Rae, the general secretary of the party. &quot;If you are going to pass this bill, do not count on us. We will not support you if you rail road this evil bill in Parliament.&quot;

Fiji Village reported on 9 March 2006 that Prime Minister Qarase had offered the NFP Cabinet posts, assuming the party won parliamentary representation, in exchange for a preference deal.

===== Negotiations with the FLP =====
A meeting, described as a &quot;courtesy call&quot;, took place between officials of the NFP and the FLP on 18 August 2005. Preferential voting was among the topics discussed, but no serious negotiations were entered into, with both parties indicating that such a move would be premature. Nevertheless, a flurry of media speculation followed, with several major news services reporting in early September that the two parties were close to reaching a deal. Comments by FLP officials led credence to these rumours. On 19 September, however, Pratap Singh distanced himself and his party from the speculation that a deal with the FLP was likely. The NFP did not believe that the FLP truly represented the Indo-Fijian community, he said, who had gained nothing from what he called the &quot;confrontational&quot; posturing of the FLP.

According to the Fiji Sun (27 February 2006), NFP trustee Attar Singh accused the FLP of having stolen the NFP&#x27;s 1982 election manifesto and using it for the 1999 election. FLP Parliamentarian Lekh Ram Vayshnoi rejected the charge as false.

===2006 election result===

The election, which was finally held on 6–13 May 2006, was a disaster for the NFP. Its share of the popular vote fell to 6 percent, its lowest ever, and the party again failed to win parliamentary representation.

=== Post-2006 ===
In 2006 the Fijian government was overthrown and the Fijian parliament dissolved in a military coup. In January 2013 the military regime promulgated new regulations governing the registration of political parties, requiring all parties to have at least 5,000 members. The NFP applied for registration on 14 February, becoming one of only two existing parties to do so. Registration was granted on 3 May 2013.

The NFP elected Biman Prasad, Professor of Economics at the University of the South Pacific, as its new leader in March 2014, while Roko Tupou Draunidalo, scion of a distinguished political and chiefly family, was elected President of the party. Three NFP candidates, including Prasad and Draunidalo, were returned in the 2014 elections, the first since the 2006 coup. Prasad was the NFP Leader in Parliament and Shadow Minister for Economy from 2014 to 2022.

In June 2016, Draunidalo made remarks against the Fijian Minister for Education, Mahendra Reddy asking him if he thought the opposition side were &quot;dumb natives&quot; for which she was taken to the Privileges Committee who recommended that she was suspended from parliament for the remainder of the term of Parliament which ends in 2018. In January 2017 she resigned from the NFP and from parliament. Her seat was taken by Parmod Chand.

The party ran 51 candidates in the 2018 elections, ten of which were women. It gained 33,515 votes, increasing its vote share to 7.38%, but gained just three seats.

On April 8, 2022, the party formed an electoral pact with the People&#x27;s Alliance, led by Sitiveni Rabuka to contest the upcoming general election. It was the second time the party allied itself with Rabuka, the last being in 1999, when the NFP, then led by Jai Ram Reddy, formed a coalition with the Rabuka-led Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT). The NFP-SVT coalition was wiped out, with the SVT winning only 8 seats, and the NFP winning none.

In the 2022 elections, the party fielded 55 candidates, 5 of which were elected: Biman Prasad, who won 11,355 votes; Lenora Qereqeretabua, who won 3,741 votes; Agni Deo Singh, who won 2,308 votes; Pio Tikoduadua, who won 2,222 votes and lastly Sashi Kiran, who managed to garner 2,024 votes. The party, in total won 41,830 votes, or 8.9%, an increase from its 2018 total. It managed to form a coalition government with the People&#x27;s Alliance and the Social Democratic Liberal Party (SODELPA), and elect Sitiveni Rabuka as Prime Minister, ending 16 years of the Bainimarama Prime Ministership. Its leader, Biman Prasad, was subsequently named Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics. Tikoduadua was given the role of Minister of Home Affairs, while Qereqeretabua was elected Deputy Speaker of Parliament. It was the first time in more than 30 years that the NFP was in government, the last being in 1987, when it was a coalition partner to the 1-month Bavadra Government.

<doc id="567684" wikidata="Q2304909" url="?curid=567684" title="Defenceman">
<text>Defence or defense (in American English) in ice hockey is a player position that is primarily responsible for preventing the opposing team from scoring. They are often referred to as defencemen, D, D-men or blueliners (the latter a reference to the blue line in ice hockey which represents the boundary of the offensive zone; defencemen generally position themselves along the line to keep the puck in the zone). They were once called cover-point. 

In regular play, two defencemen complement three forwards and a goaltender on the ice. Exceptions include overtime during the regular season and when a team is short-handed (i.e. has been assessed a penalty), in which two defencemen are typically joined by only two forwards and a goaltender; when a team is on the power play (i.e. the opponent has been assessed a penalty), teams will often play only one defencemen, joined by four forwards and a goaltender. In National Hockey League regular season play in overtime, effective with the 2015-16 season, teams (usually) have only three position players and a goaltender on the ice, and may use either two forwards and one defenceman, orrarelytwo defencemen and one forward.

==Historical designations==
Organized play of ice hockey originates from the first indoor game in Montreal in 1875. In subsequent years, the number of players per side was reduced to seven. Positions were standardized, and two correspond to the two defencemen of current six-man rules. These were designated as cover point and point, although they lined up behind the center and the rover, unlike today. Decades later, defencemen were standardized into playing left and right sides of the ice.

===Point===
According to one of the earliest known books on ice hockey, Farrell&#x27;s &quot;Hockey: Canada&#x27;s Royal Winter Game&quot; (1899), Mike Grant of the Montreal Victorias, describes the point as &quot;essentially defensive. He should not stray too far from his place, because oftentimes he is practically a second goal-minder ... although he should remain close to his goal-keeper, he should never obstruct that man&#x27;s view of the puck. He should, as a rule, avoid rushing up the ice, but if he has a good opening for such a play he should give the puck to one of the forwards on the first opportunity and then hasten back to his position, which has been occupied, in the interim, by the cover-point.&quot;

=== Cover-point ===
Also in Farrell&#x27;s 1899 book, Hugh Baird, then captain and cover-point of the Montreal Hockey Club, describes the cover-point as &quot;a combination of a defence man and a forward, and is allowed, in virtue of this fact, more latitude with respect to leaving his position, than any man on the team, except the rover. In his capacity of a defence player, he should linger around his goals as long as the puck is near... When the play is at the other end of the rink, the cover-point should advance to about the middle, so that when the puck is lifted down, he may return it without loss of time, in order to keep the game centered around his opponents&#x27; goals, and to save his forwards the trouble of skating up to him so that they may again &#x27;get in to play.&#x27; It is by playing far up under these circumstances that a clever cover-point can chine to the advantage of his team. If he has a good opening he should shoot well for the goals, but if he has not, he should, as I have said, return the puck instantaneously.&quot;

==Distinguished defencemen==
After a finished season the NHL, the premier ice hockey league in the world, presents the James Norris Memorial Trophy to the best defenceman in the league. Bobby Orr of the Boston Bruins – an eight-time Norris Trophy recipient – is often considered to be the greatest defenceman in NHL and ice hockey history. In addition to his Norris Trophy honours, he is the only defenceman in NHL history to capture the Art Ross Trophy as the league&#x27;s leading scorer. In 1998, Orr was selected as the best defenceman of all-time (second overall player behind Wayne Gretzky) in &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; Top 100 NHL Players of all-time.

Conversely, according to the IIHF Centennial All-Star Team (also chosen by &quot;The Hockey News&quot;), the greatest defencemen to play in IIHF-sanctioned international competition are Vyacheslav Fetisov and Börje Salming.

==&#x27;Stay-at-home&#x27; and &#x27;offensive&#x27; defence==
Defence players are often described by the amount that they participate in offence. The extreme of non-participation in offence is a &quot;stay-at-home&quot; defender, who plays a conservative, risk averse game and does not score much, instead focusing on defensive assignments towards the opposing team. A good example is Rod Langway, who won the Norris Trophy after having scored only three goals that season, as the award winners before and after him were primarily offensive defencemen such as Bobby Orr, Denis Potvin, and Paul Coffey. Other examples of stay-at-home defencemen include Leo Boivin, Chris Chelios, Tim Horton, Harry Howell, Tom Johnson, Jacques Laperrière, Kevin Lowe, Brad McCrimmon, Bill Quackenbush, and Scott Stevens.

The other extreme of participation is an &quot;offensive defenceman&quot;, who gets aggressively involved in the team&#x27;s offence. To accomplish this, the offensive defence player often “pinches in” to keep the play from going offside and moves towards the halfboards and high-slot area for scoring opportunities. This makes it difficult for the opposing team to protect their net from being scored upon if the team can maintain control of the puck. However, this can lead to more odd man rushes and breakaway opportunities for the opposing team if the defender does not succeed. Bobby Orr&#x27;s end-to-end rushing allowed him to defend effectively as well as attack, helping his teams win two Stanley Cup Championships. By contrast, Paul Coffey enjoyed high offensive production but his defensive play was considered mediocre for most of his career; he helped his teams win four Stanley Cup Championships, often paired with a &quot;stay-at-home&quot; defender. 

===Defensive zone play===
When in the defensive zone, the defence player is responsible for keeping the opposing forwards&#x27; opportunities to a minimum when they are on a rush, forcing them to the corners and blocking both passing and shooting lanes. The primary responsibility is to cover areas of the defensive zone that would otherwise pose a clear goalscoring threat from the opposing offence. 

When the opposing offence is putting pressure on the defence&#x27;s team, the defence skater usually plays closer to the net, attempting again to block shooting lanes but also ensure that the goalie is not screened (prevented from being able to see the puck at all times). It is especially critical for the defenceman to keep opposing forwards from being able to move effectively in front of the net, which is why defencemen are frequently tasked with playing physical hockey in front of their own net. If a shot on net is made, an unguarded forward can often redirect it too quickly for the goalie to adjust or else score on a rebound. Another important duty is clearing rebounds away from the goal, and preferably to the defenceman&#x27;s teammates, before opposing forwards can get to them. Often, defence players end up covering the opposing team&#x27;s wingers while in the defensive zone, while their centre will cover the opposing team&#x27;s centre.

===Neutral zone play===
In the neutral zone, the defence hangs back towards his or her own blue line, usually playing the puck up to other teammates. According to Jay Leach, who writes for NHL.com&#x27;s &quot;learn to play hockey&quot; section, the defence must &quot;Move the puck hard and quick to the open man. Join the rush, [but] do not lead it.&quot; Because of this responsibility, defencemen must read the other team&#x27;s defensive strategy effectively in order to make an effective first pass that furthers the offensive momentum without leaving the defenceman out of position should his team lose control of the puck. In certain situations the best option could be to skate the puck into the zone to maintain offensive speed as well as preventing an offside.

===Offensive zone play===
In the offensive zone, the defence skaters usually &quot;play the blue line&quot;. It is their duty to keep the puck in the offensive zone by stopping it from crossing the blue line that demarcates where the offensive zone begins. Should the puck cross this line, the offence cannot touch the puck in their opponent&#x27;s zone without stopping play (see offside). Defencemen must be quick to pass the puck around, helping their forwards to open up shooting lanes, or taking open shots themselves when they become available. The defence must also be able to skate quickly to cut off any breakaways, moving themselves back into the defensive zone ahead of the onrushing opponent.

Essentially in all three zones of the rink, the defence is the backstop for the puck. It should never go behind the defence, unless the player intentionally lets it for strategic reasons. The defence keeps the momentum of play squarely directed towards the opposing goal, or at least away from his own.

Because defencemen are often expected to shoot on the opposing net from long range, these players often develop the hardest and most accurate slapshots. This is because taking a more stationary position on the blue line rewards pure accuracy and patience, rather than the adept hand–eye coordination attributed to forwards. Al MacInnis, who was seven times decorated with &quot;Hardest Shot&quot; in NHL skills competitions, was able to score frequently from the blue line because his slapshot was simply too fast to block effectively.

When a team is on a power play, a defence player can set up plays in the offensive zone, and distribute the puck to the teammate that he or she feels is in the best position to score, similar to a point guard in basketball, a playmaker in soccer, and a quarterback in American football and Canadian football. For this reason, a defenceman will often be described as the power play &quot;quarterback&quot;, in particular if an umbrella power play formation is used (where a single defenceman is occupying the point, in the middle of the ice). This is also referred to as &quot;playing the point&quot; (this term derives not from the basketball position, but from an older name for the defence position in hockey itself).

==Faceoffs==
During faceoffs in the defensive zone, most teams have their defence players pair up with opposing wingers to tie them up while leaving his team&#x27;s forwards open to move the puck, though this is at the discretion of the individual coach. In the offensive zone, the defence player acts in his or her usual role, keeping control of the puck as the forwards fight for position.

In the first organized ice hockey (see Amateur Hockey Association of Canada), defencemen used to line up in an &quot;I&quot; formation behind the rover (defunct) as &quot;point&quot; and &quot;cover point&quot;. Defence is still referred to as &quot;playing the point&quot;, though this term now refers mostly to the role of defencemen on the power-play.

==Skating==
Defencemen must possess excellent skating abilities, specifically in speed, constant foot movement and quick transitioning from forward to backward and vice versa. With regard to skating backwards, defencemen must acquire a higher skill level than offensive players. This allows them to face their offensive opponents as they rush down the ice toward the defensive zone. A defenceman must be as comfortable going backwards and sideways as forwards. Defencemen must also gain confidence in quickly carrying the puck to open up the attack during a defensive zone break-out. This requires the ability to burst out of the defensive zone with speed, yet at the same time having the ability to use their vision to execute quick passes to open forwards, or gaining the neutral zone before shooting the puck into the offensive zone.

<text>Vehicle insurance (also known as car insurance, motor insurance, or auto insurance) is insurance for cars, trucks, motorcycles, and other road vehicles. Its primary use is to provide financial protection against physical damage or bodily injury resulting from traffic collisions and against liability that could also arise from incidents in a vehicle. Vehicle insurance may additionally offer financial protection against theft of the vehicle, and against damage to the vehicle sustained from events other than traffic collisions, such as vandalism, weather or natural disasters, and damage sustained by colliding with stationary objects. The specific terms of vehicle insurance vary with legal regulations in each region.

==History==
Widespread use of the motor car began after the First World War in urban areas. Cars were relatively fast and dangerous by that stage, yet there was still no compulsory form of car insurance anywhere in the world. This meant that injured victims would rarely get any compensation in a crash, and drivers often faced considerable costs for damage to their car and property.

A compulsory car insurance scheme was introduced in the United Kingdom with the Road Traffic Act 1930. This ensured that all vehicle owners and drivers had to be insured for their liability for injury or death to third parties while their vehicle was being used on a public road. Ireland replicated the obligation via the Road Traffic Act, 1933. Germany enacted similar legislation in 1939 called the &quot;Act on the Implementation of Compulsory Insurance for Motor Vehicle Owners&quot;. The EU (then EEC) required mandatory insurance cover be mandated by all member states, from 1973.

==Public policies==
In most jurisdictions, it is compulsory to have vehicle insurance before using or keeping a motor vehicle on public roads. Most jurisdictions relate insurance to both the car and the driver; however, the degree of each varies greatly.

Several jurisdictions have experimented with a &quot;pay-as-you-drive&quot; insurance plan which utilizes either a tracking device in the vehicle or vehicle diagnostics. This could address issues of uninsured motorists by providing additional options and also charge based on the distance driven, which could theoretically increase the efficiency of the insurance, through streamlined collection.

===Australia===
In Australia, every state has its own &quot;Compulsory Third-Party&quot; (CTP) insurance scheme. CTP covers only personal injury liability in a vehicle crash. &quot;Comprehensive&quot; and &quot;Third-Party Property Damage, with or without Fire and Theft&quot; insurance, are sold separately. 
* &quot;Comprehensive&quot; insurance covers damages to third-party vehicles, other third-party property and the insured vehicle.
* &quot;Third-Party Property Damage&quot; insurance covers damage to third-party property and vehicles, but not the insured vehicle.
* &quot;Third-Party Property Damage with Fire and Theft&quot; insurance covers the insured vehicle against fire and theft as well as damage to third-party property and vehicles.

====Compulsory Third-Party Insurance====

CTP insurance is compulsory in every state in Australia and is paid as part of vehicle registration. It covers the vehicle owner and any person who drives the vehicle against claims for liability for death or injury to people caused by the fault of the vehicle owner or driver. CTP may include any kind of physical harm, bodily injuries and may cover the cost of all reasonable medical treatment for injuries received in the crash, loss of wages, cost of care services and, in some cases, compensation for pain and suffering. Each state in Australia has a different scheme.

Third-Party Property insurance or Comprehensive insurance covers the third party with the repairing cost of the vehicle, any property damage or medication expenses as a result of a crash by the insured. They are not to be confused with Compulsory Third-Party insurance, which is for injuries or death of someone in a motor crash.

In New South Wales, each vehicle must be insured before it can be registered. It is often called a &#x27;greenslip&#x27;, because of its colour. There are five licensed CTP insurers in New South Wales. Suncorp holds licences for GIO and AAMI and Allianz holds one licence. The remaining two licences are held by QBE and NRMA Insurance (NRMA). APIA and Shannons and InsureMyRide insurance also supply CTP insurance licensed by GIO.

A privately provided scheme also applies in the Australian Capital Territory through AAMI, APIA, GIO and NRMA. Vehicle owners pay for CTP as part of their vehicle registration.

In Queensland, CTP is included in the registration fee for a vehicle. There is a choice of private insurer – Allianz, QBE and Suncorp and price is government controlled.

In South Australia, since July 2016, CTP is no longer provided by the Motor Accident Commission. The government has now licensed four private insurers – AAMI, Allianz, QBE and SGIC – to offer CTP insurance SA. Since July 2019, vehicle owners can choose their own CTP insurer and new insurers may also enter the market.

There are three states and one territory that do not have a private CTP scheme. In Victoria, the Transport Accident Commission provides CTP through a levy in the vehicle registration fee, known as the TAC charge. A similar scheme exists in Tasmania through the Motor Accidents Insurance Board. A similar scheme applies in Western Australia, through the Insurance Commission of Western Australia (ICWA). The Northern Territory scheme is managed through Territory Insurance Office (TIO).

===Bangladesh===
For all types of motor insurance policies in Bangladesh, the limit of liability has been fixed by the law. Currently, the limits are too low to compensate the victims. In respect of Act Only Liability Motor Vehicle Insurance, the compensation for personal injuries and property damage to third parties is BDT 20,000 for death, for severe injury, for injury, and for property damage. The limits are under review by the governmental bodies.

===Canada===
Several Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Quebec) provide a public auto insurance system while in the rest of the country insurance is provided privately. The third-party insurance is privatized in Quebec and is mandatory. The province covers everything but the vehicle(s). Basic auto insurance is mandatory throughout Canada (with some exceptions, such as government vehicles) with each province&#x27;s government determining which benefits are included as minimum required auto insurance coverage and which benefits are options available for those seeking additional coverage. Accident benefits coverage is mandatory everywhere except for Newfoundland and Labrador. All provinces in Canada have some form of no-fault insurance available to crash victims. The difference from province to province is the extent to which tort or no-fault is emphasized. International drivers entering Canada are permitted to drive any vehicle their licence allows for the three-month period for which they are allowed to use their international licence. International laws provide visitors to the country with an International Insurance Bond (IIB) until this three-month period is over in which the international driver must provide themselves with Canadian Insurance. The IIB is reinstated every time the international driver enters the country. Damage to the driver&#x27;s own vehicle is optional – one notable exception to this is in Saskatchewan, where SGI provides collision coverage (less than a $1000 deductible, such as a collision damage waiver) as part of its basic insurance policy. In Saskatchewan, residents have the option to have their auto insurance through a tort system but less than 0.5% of the population have taken this option.

Facility insurance policies are offered by the &quot;facility association residual market&quot; (or &quot;FARM&quot;), as a last resort since auto insurance is mandatory in Canada, for private and commercial high-risk drivers who cannot buy a policy in the voluntary market (regular auto insurance).

===China===
Traffic Compulsory Insurance provides protection in the event of third party injuries, third party property losses, etc. The minimum liability cover is RMB180,000 (US$) for death and injury/per crash, RMB18,000 (US$) for medical expense, and RMB2,000 (US$) for physical loss. Additional 3rd Party Liability Insurance also known as Commercial Motor Insurance provides extra cover up to RMB10,000,000 (US$) excluding the driver and passengers. Driver and Passenger insurance covers the driver and passengers, whilst Vehicle Damage and Theft Insurance covers vehicle damage and the objects contained inside. Excess Waiver Insurance is an additional option that waives any deductibles.

Some differences apply in different regions:

====Hong Kong====
According to section 4(1) of the Motor Vehicles Insurance (Third-Party Risks) Ordinance (Cap. 272 of the Laws of Hong Kong), all users of a car, include its permitted users, must have insurance or some other security with respect to third-party risks. Third party insurance protects the policyholder against liability of death or bodily injury to third party up to and/or damage to third party property up to as a result of crash arising out of the use of the insured vehicle. Comprehensive Motor Insurance is also available.

====Macau====
The mandatory minimum legal requirement Third Party Liability (&quot;TPL&quot;) Cover is MOP1,500,000 per crash and MOP30,000,000 per year, protecting against the legal liability arising from a traffic crash causing loss and damages to any third party.. Comprehensive Motor Insurance is also available.

===European Union===

In the European Union, from the introduction of Directive 1972/166/EEC, insurance cover is mandatory, with the statutory minimum cover being revised every five years, the most recent revision, via Directive (EU) 2021/2118 (the ‘‘Motor Insurance Directive’’ or ‘‘MID’’) requires:
* in the case of personal injury, a minimum amount of cover of €1,300,000 (US$) per injured party or €6,450,000 (US$) per claim, irrespective of the number of parties;
* in the case of damage to property, €1,300,000 (US$) per accident.

In some European languages, comprehensive non-mandatory insurance is known as &quot;casco&quot; (Casualty and Collision).

====Germany====

Since 1939, it has been compulsory to have third-party personal insurance before keeping a motor vehicle in all federal states of Germany. In addition, every vehicle owner is free to take out a comprehensive insurance policy. All types of car insurance are provided by several private insurers. The amount of insurance contribution is determined by several criteria, like the region, the type of car or the personal way of driving.

The minimum coverage defined by German law for car liability insurance / third-party personal insurance is €7,500,000 for bodily injury (damage to people), €500,000 for property damage and €50,000 for financial/fortune loss which is in no direct or indirect coherence with bodily injury or property damage. Insurance companies usually offer all-in/combined single limit insurance policies of €50,000,000 or €100,000,000 (about €141,000,000) for bodily injury, property damage and other financial/fortune loss (usually with a bodily injury coverage limitation of €8–15,000,000 for each bodily injured person).

====Hungary====
Third party vehicle insurance is mandatory for all vehicles in Hungary. No exemption is possible by money deposit. The premium covers all damage up to HUF 500m (about €1.8m) per crash without deductible. The coverage is extended to HUF 1,250m (about €4.5m) in case of personal injuries. Vehicle insurance policies from all EU countries and some non-EU countries are valid in Hungary based on bilateral or multilateral agreements. Visitors with vehicle insurance not covered by such agreements are required to buy a monthly, renewable policy at the border.

====Ireland====
The Road Traffic Act, 1933 requires all drivers of mechanically propelled vehicles in public places to have at least third-party insurance, or to have obtained exemption – generally by depositing a (large) sum of money to the High Court as a guarantee against claims. In 1933, this figure was set at £15,000. The Road Traffic Act, 1961 (which is currently in force) repealed the 1933 act but replaced these sections with functionally identical sections.

From 1968, those making deposits require the consent of the Minister for Transport to do so, with the sum specified by the Minister.

Those not exempted from obtaining insurance must obtain a certificate of insurance from their insurance provider, and display a portion of this (an insurance disc) on their vehicles&#x27; windscreen (if fitted). The certificate in full must be presented to a police station within ten days if requested by an officer. Proof of having insurance or an exemption must also be provided to pay for the motor tax.

Those injured or suffering property damage/loss due to uninsured drivers can claim against the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland&#x27;s uninsured drivers fund, as can those injured (but not those suffering damage or loss) from hit and run offences.

====Italy====

The law 990/1969 requires that each motor vehicle or trailer standing or moving on a public road have third-party insurance (called RCA, ). Historically, a part of the certificate of insurance must be displayed on the windscreen of the vehicle. This latter requirement was revoked in 2015, when a national database of insured vehicles was built by the Insurance Company Association (ANIA, &#x27;) and the National Transportation Authority (&#x27;) to verify (by private citizens and public authorities) if a vehicle is insured. There is no exemption policy to this law disposition.

Driving without the necessary insurance for that vehicle is an offence that can be prosecuted by the police and fines range from 841 to 3,287 euros. Police forces also have the power to seize a vehicle that does not have the necessary insurance in place, until the owner of the vehicle pays a fine and signs a new insurance policy. The same provision is applied when the vehicle is standing on a public road.

Minimal insurance policies cover only third parties (including the insured person and third parties carried with the vehicle, but not the driver, if the two do not coincide). &quot;Third parties, fire and theft&quot; is a common insurance policy, while the all-inclusive policies (&quot;kasko&quot; policy) which include also damages of the vehicle causing the crash or the injuries. It is also common to include a renounce clause of the insurance company to compensate the damages against the insured person in some cases (usually in case of DUI or other infringement of the law by the driver).

The victims of crashes caused by non-insured vehicles could be compensated by the Road&#x27;s Victim Warranty Fund (&quot;&quot;), which is covered by a fixed amount (2.5%, as 2015) of each RCA insurance premium.

====Netherlands====
Third-party vehicle insurance is a mandatory requirement for every vehicle in the Netherlands. This obligation is mandatory based on article 2 of the . When a vehicle is not insured the owner will receive a fine from the RDW (). The third-party vehicle insurance is called a where WA stands for which means legal liability. In general there are three types of auto insurance in the Netherlands: (liability insurance), (limited frame coverage), and (full frame coverage). Limited frame and full frame coverage will provide more coverage against certain additional risks which are not covered by the mandatory legal third-party coverage. For example limited frame coverage will provide coverage against damage caused by the weather such as storm and flooding. Also fire damage and theft of the car is covered. Full frame coverage will provide coverage against all risks mentioned plus damage to the car caused by the driver himself.

==== Spain ====
Each motor vehicle on a public road is required to have third party insurance (called ).

Police forces have the power to seize vehicles that do not have the necessary insurance in place, until the owner of the vehicle pays the fine and signs a new insurance policy. Driving without the necessary insurance for that vehicle is an offence that will be prosecuted by the police and will receive a penalty. The same provision is applied when the vehicle is standing on a public road.

The minimum insurance policy covers only third parties (including the insured person and third parties carried with the vehicle, but not the driver, if the two do not coincide). &quot;Third parties, fire and theft&quot; is a common insurance policy.

Victims of accidents caused by non-insured vehicles may be compensated by a Warranty Fund, which is covered by a fixed amount for each insurance premium.PPcn{{

Since 2013 it is possible to contract an insurance by days as is possible in countries such as Germany and the UK.

==== Bulgaria ====
Liability insurance (called {{lang|bg|Гражданска отговорност}}) is compulsory for each motor vehicle driven on public roads and covers third parties for injuries up to 10 420 000 BGN and property damage up to 2 100 000 BGN per insured incident.{{cn|date=February 2025}}

====Romania====
Romanian law mandates Răspundere Auto Civilă, a motor-vehicle liability insurance for all vehicle owners to cover damages to third parties.

===Indonesia===

Third-party vehicle insurance is a mandatory requirement in Indonesia and each individual car and motorcycle must be insured or the vehicle will not be considered legal; this compulsory auto insurance is legally called the Road Traffic Accidents Compulsory Coverage Fund ({{langx|id|Dana Pertanggungan Wajib Kecelakaan Lalu Lintas Jalan}}, DPWKLLJ). Therefore, a motorist cannot drive the vehicle until it is insured. DPWKLLJ was introduced in 1964 and merely covers body injuries, and is operated by a SOE called {{ill|PT Jasa Raharja (Persero)|id|Jasa Raharja}}. DPWKLLJ is included, through an annual premium called the &quot;Compulsory Donation to the Road Traffic Accident Fund&quot; ({{langx|id|Sumbangan Wajib Dana Kecelakaan Lalu Lintas Jalan}}, &quot;SWDKLLJ&quot;), in the annual vehicle tax which is paid to the local &quot;Samsat&quot; (&quot;Sistem Administrasi Manunggal di bawah Satu Atap&quot;), which is responsible for cars and roads.

===India===
{{Main|Motor Vehicle Insurance (India)}}

Auto insurance in India covers the loss of or damage caused to the automobile or its parts due to natural and man-made calamities. It provides &quot;accident cover for individual owners&quot; of the vehicle while driving and also for &quot;passengers and third party legal liability&quot;. There are certain general insurance companies who also offer online insurance service for the vehicle.{{cn|date=February 2025}}

Auto insurance is a compulsory requirement for all new vehicles used whether for commercial or personal use. Insurance companies have tie-ups with leading automobile manufacturers. They offer their customers instant auto quotes. Premiums are determined by a number of factors and the amount of premium increases with the rise in the price of the vehicle. The claims of the auto insurance in India can be accidental, theft claims or third party claims. Certain documents are required for claiming auto insurance, like duly signed claim form, Registration Certificate copy of the vehicle, driving license copy, First information report copy, original estimate and policy copy.{{cn|date=February 2025}}

There are different types of auto insurance in India:

*Private car insurance – the fastest growing sector in India as it is compulsory for all new cars. The amount of premium depends on the make and value of the car, state where the car is registered and the year of manufacture. This amount can be reduced by asking the insurer for a no claim bonus (NCB) if no claim is made for insurance in previous year.
*Two wheeler insurance – covers accidental insurance for the driver of the vehicle. The amount of premium depends on the current showroom price multiplied by the depreciation rate fixed by the Tariff Advisory Committee at the beginning of a policy period.{{cn|date=February 2025}}
*Commercial vehicle insurance – provides cover for all the vehicles which are not used for personal purposes like trucks and HMVs. The amount of premium depends on the showroom price of the vehicle at the commencement of the insurance period, make of the vehicle and the place of registration of the vehicle.{{cn|date=February 2025}}

===Malaysia===
{{unref-section|date=February 2025}}
In Malaysia, renewing car insurances is a very common thing. In general, there are four types of car insurance available for Malaysians:

* Act cover
This is the minimum cover corresponding to the terms of the Road Transport Act 1987. The insurance concerns the legal liability for death or physical injury to the third party (not include the passengers), so it is hardly ever written by insurers.

* Third-party coverage
This type is compulsory to buy for every vehicle so it is the most basic and common car insurance, which insures you against claims for the injury or damage to the third party or its property in a crash.

* Third-party, fire, and theft coverage
In addition to third-party coverage, this policy also provides insurance for your own vehicle due to fire, crash or theft.

* Comprehensive coverage
This policy provides the widest coverage, i.e. the third party&#x27;s physical injury and death, third party&#x27;s vehicle damage and your own vehicle&#x27;s damage caused by fire, theft or a crash. This type of insurance is usually designed for luxury vehicles.

===New Zealand===
Within New Zealand, the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) provides nationwide no-fault personal injury insurance. Injuries involving motor vehicles operating on public roads are covered by the Motor Vehicle Account, for which premiums are collected through levies on petrol and through vehicle licensing fees.

===Norway===
{{unref-section|date=February 2025}}
In Norway, the vehicle owner must provide the minimum liability insurance for his/her vehicle(s) – of any kind. Otherwise, the vehicle is illegal to use. If a person drives a vehicle belonging to someone else and has a crash, the insurance will cover for damage done. Note that the policy carrier can choose to limit the coverage to only apply for family members or persons over a certain age.

=== Russian Federation ===
{{unref-section|date=February 2025}}
Motor vehicle liability insurance is mandatory for all owners in Russian legislation. Insurance of the vehicle itself is technically voluntary, but may be mandated in some circumstances, e.g. if the car is leased.

===South Africa===
South Africa allocates a percentage of the money from fuel into the Road Accident Fund, which goes towards compensating third parties in crashes.

===United Arab Emirates===
When buying car insurance in the United Arab Emirates, the traffic department requires a 13-month insurance certificate each time a person registers or renews a vehicle registration. In Dubai, vehicle insurance is compulsory as per the UAE RTA law. There are two types of motor insurance policies in Dubai, Third-Party Liability Insurance and Comprehensive Motor Insurance.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

It is mandatory to have third-party liability insurance for every individual vehicle owner in Dubai. This insurance policy is the most basic form of vehicle insurance Dubai as it covers the third-party property damage or bodily injuries caused by the insured vehicle.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Policyholder&#x27;s own vehicle damage such as fire, theft, and accidental collision is not covered under the third-party liability insurance policy.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Vehicle insurance in the United Kingdom}}

The Road Traffic Act 1930, of the UK Government, introduced a law that required every person who used a vehicle on the road to have at least third-party personal injury insurance. Today, this law is contained in the Road Traffic Act 1988. Section 143 of that Act requires that motorists be insured against liability for injuries to others (including passengers) and for damage to other persons&#x27; property, resulting from use of a vehicle on a public road or in other public places. The regulations were last revised via The Motor Vehicles (Compulsory Insurance) Regulations 2016 No. 1193, the amendment increased the minimum guaranteed property cover to £1,200,000 (US${{Formatnum:{{To USD round|1200000|GBR|sf=3}}}}) per accident, personal injury cover remains unlimited. Failure to insure a vehicle can result in the vehicle being seized, the driver fined a minimum of £300 (US${{Formatnum:{{To USD round|300|GBR|sf=2}}}}) and issued with six to eight penalty driving points (IN10).

===United States===
{{main|Vehicle insurance in the United States}}
The regulations for vehicle insurance differ with each of the 50 US states and other territories, with each U.S. state having its own mandatory minimum coverage requirements (&quot;see separate main article&quot;). Forty-nine U.S. states and the District of Columbia require drivers to have insurance coverage for both bodily injury and property damage, with New Hampshire being the exception, but the minimum amount of coverage required by law varies by state. For example, minimum bodily injury liability coverage requirements range from $30,000 in Arizona to $100,000 in Alaska and Maine, while minimum property damage liability requirements range from $5,000 to $25,000 in most states.

==Coverage levels==
{{unref-section|date=February 2025}}
Vehicle insurance can cover some or all of the following items:
* The insured party (medical payments)
* Property damage caused by the insured
* The insured vehicle (physical damage)
* Third parties (car and people, property damage and bodily injury)
* Third party, fire and theft
* In some jurisdictions coverage for injuries to persons riding in the insured vehicle is available without regard to fault in the auto crash (No Fault Auto Insurance)
* The cost to rent a vehicle if yours is damaged.
* The cost to tow your vehicle to a repair facility.
* Crashes involving uninsured motorists.

Different policies specify the circumstances under which each item is covered. For example, a vehicle can be insured against theft, fire damage, or crash damage independently.

If a vehicle is declared a total loss and the vehicle&#x27;s market value is less than the amount that is still owed to the bank that is financing the vehicle, GAP insurance may cover the difference. Not all auto insurance policies include GAP insurance. GAP insurance is often offered by the finance company at time the vehicle is purchased.

==Excess==
An excess payment, also known as a deductible, is a fixed contribution that must be paid each time a car is repaired with the charges billed to an automotive insurance policy. Normally this payment is made directly to the crash repair &quot;garage&quot; (the term &quot;garage&quot; refers to an establishment where vehicles are serviced and repaired) when the owner collects the car. If one&#x27;s car is declared to be a &quot;write-off&quot; (or &quot;totaled&quot;), then the insurance company will deduct the excess agreed on the policy from the settlement payment it makes to the owner.

If the crash was the other driver&#x27;s fault, and this fault is accepted by the third party&#x27;s insurer, then the vehicle owner may be able to reclaim the excess payment from the other person&#x27;s insurance company.

The excess itself can also be protected by a motor excess insurance policy.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Compulsory excess===
A compulsory excess is the minimum excess payment the insurer will accept on the insurance policy. Minimum excesses vary according to the personal details, driving record and the insurance company. For example, young or inexperienced drivers and types of incident can incur additional compulsory excess charges.

===Voluntary excess===
To reduce the insurance premium, the insured party may offer to pay a higher excess (deductible) than the compulsory excess demanded by the insurance company. The voluntary excess is the extra amount, over and above the compulsory excess, that is agreed to be paid in the event of a claim on the policy. As a bigger excess reduces the financial risk carried by the insurer, the insurer is able to offer a significantly lower premium.

==Basis of premium charges==
{{Main|Auto insurance risk selection}}

Depending on the jurisdiction, the insurance premium can be either mandated by the government or determined by the insurance company, in accordance with a framework of regulations set by the government. Often, the insurer will have more freedom to set the price on physical damage coverages than on mandatory liability coverages.

When the premium is not mandated by the government, it is usually derived from the calculations of an actuary, based on statistical data. The premium can vary depending on many factors that are believed to affect the expected cost of future claims. Those factors can include the car characteristics, the coverage selected (deductible, limit, covered perils), the profile of the driver (age, gender, driving history) and the usage of the car (commute to work or not, predicted annual distance driven).

===Neighbourhood===
The address of the owner can affect the premiums. Areas with high crime rates generally lead to higher costs of insurance.

===Gender===
Because male drivers, especially younger ones, are on average often regarded as tending to drive more aggressively, the premiums charged for policies on vehicles whose primary driver is male are often higher. This discrimination may be dropped if the driver is past a certain age. Apparently, this method is based on statistics showing that young male drivers have a higher accident rate.

On 1 March 2011, the European Court of Justice decided insurance companies who used gender as a risk factor when calculating insurance premiums were breaching EU equality laws. The Court ruled that car-insurance companies were discriminating against men. However, in some places, such as the UK, companies have used the standard practice of discrimination based on profession to still use gender as a factor, albeit indirectly. Professions which are more typically practised by men are deemed as being more risky even if they had not been prior to the Court&#x27;s ruling while the converse is applied to professions predominant among women. Another effect of the ruling has been that, while the premiums for men have been lowered, they have been raised for women. This equalisation effect has also been seen in other types of insurance for individuals, such as life insurance.

===Age===
Teenage drivers who have no driving record will have higher car insurance premiums. However, young drivers are often offered discounts if they undertake further driver training on recognized courses, such as the Pass Plus scheme in the UK, or if they install a telematics device to monitor their driving style. In the US many insurers offer a good-grade discount to students with a good academic record and resident-student discounts to those who live away from home. Generally insurance premiums tend to become lower at the age of 25. Some insurance companies offer &quot;stand alone&quot; car insurance policies specifically for teenagers with lower premiums. By placing restrictions on teenagers&#x27; driving (forbidding driving after dark, or giving rides to other teens, for example), these companies effectively reduce their risk.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

===U.S. driving history===
In most U.S. states, moving violations, including running red lights and speeding, assess points on a driver&#x27;s driving record. Since more points indicate an increased risk of future violations, insurance companies periodically review drivers&#x27; records, and may raise premiums accordingly. Rating practices, such as debit for a poor driving history, are not dictated by law. Many insurers allow one moving violation every three to five years before increasing premiums. Crashes affect insurance premiums similarly. Depending on the severity of the crash and the number of points assessed, rates can increase by as much as twenty to thirty percent.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Any motoring convictions should be disclosed to insurers, as the driver is assessed by risk from prior experiences while driving on the road.

===Marital status===
Statistics show that married drivers average fewer crashes than the rest of the population so policy owners who are married often receive lower premiums than single persons.

===Profession===
The profession of the driver may be used as a factor to determine premiums. Certain professions may be deemed more likely to result in damages if they regularly involve more travel or the carrying of expensive equipment or stock or if they are predominant either among women or among men.

===Vehicle classification===
Two of the most important factors that go into determining the underwriting risk on motorized vehicles are: performance capability and retail cost. The most commonly available providers of auto insurance have underwriting restrictions against vehicles that are either designed to be capable of higher speeds and performance levels, or vehicles that retail above a certain dollar amount. Vehicles that are commonly considered luxury automobiles usually carry more expensive physical damage premiums because they are more expensive to replace. Vehicles that can be classified as high performance autos will carry higher premiums generally because there is greater opportunity for risky driving behavior. Motorcycle insurance may carry lower property-damage premiums because the risk of damage to other vehicles is minimal, yet have higher liability or personal-injury premiums, because motorcycle riders face different physical risks while on the road. Risk classification on automobiles also takes into account the statistical analysis of reported theft, accidents, and mechanical malfunction on every given year, make, and model of auto.

===Distance===
Some car insurance plans do not differentiate in regard to how much the car is used. There are however low-mileage discounts offered by some insurance providers. Other methods of differentiation would include over-road distance between the ordinary residence of a subject and their ordinary, daily destinations.

====Reasonable distance estimation====
Another important factor in determining car insurance premiums involves the annual mileage put on the vehicle, and for what reason. Driving to and from work every day at a specified distance, especially in urban areas where common traffic routes are known, presents different risks than how a retiree who does not work any longer may use their vehicle. Common practice has been that this information was provided solely by the insured person, but some insurance providers have started to collect regular odometer readings to verify the risk.

====Odometer-based systems====
Cents Per Mile Now (1986) advocates classified odometer-mile rates, a type of usage-based insurance. After the company&#x27;s risk factors have been applied, and the customer has accepted the per-mile rate offered, then customers buy prepaid miles of insurance protection as needed, like buying gallons of gasoline (litres of petrol). Insurance automatically ends when the odometer limit (recorded on the car&#x27;s insurance ID card) is reached, unless more distance is bought. Customers keep track of miles on their own odometer to know when to buy more. The company does no after-the-fact billing of the customer, and the customer does not have to estimate a &quot;future annual mileage&quot; figure for the company to obtain a discount. In the event of a traffic stop, an officer could easily verify that the insurance is current, by comparing the figure on the insurance card to that on the odometer.

Critics point out the possibility of cheating the system by odometer tampering. Although the newer electronic odometers are difficult to roll back, they can still be defeated by disconnecting the odometer wires and reconnecting them later. However, as the Cents Per Mile Now website points out:

As a practical matter, resetting odometers requires equipment plus expertise that makes stealing insurance risky and uneconomical. For example, to steal {{convert|20000|mi|km|-2|disp=sqbr}} of continuous protection while paying for only the 2000 in the 35000 to 37000 range on the odometer, the resetting would have to be done at least nine times, to keep the odometer reading within the narrow {{convert|2000|mi|km|adj=on|disp=sqbr}} covered range. There are also powerful legal deterrents to this way of stealing insurance protection. Odometers have always served as the measuring device for resale value, rental and leasing charges, warranty limits, mechanical breakdown insurance, and cents-per-mile tax deductions or reimbursements for business or government travel. Odometer tampering, detected during claim processing, voids the insurance and, under decades-old state and federal law, is punishable by heavy fines and jail.
Under the cents-per-mile system, rewards for driving less are delivered automatically, without the need for administratively cumbersome and costly GPS technology. Uniform per-mile exposure measurement for the first time provides the basis for statistically valid rate classes. Insurer premium income automatically keeps pace with increases or decreases in driving activity, cutting back on resulting insurer demand for rate increases and preventing today&#x27;s windfalls to insurers, when decreased driving activity lowers costs but not premiums.

====GPS-based system====
In 1998, the Progressive Insurance company started a pilot program in Texas, in which drivers received a discount for installing a GPS-based device that tracked their driving behavior and reported the results via cellular phone to the company. The program was discontinued in 2000. In following years many policies (including Progressive) have been trialed and successfully introduced worldwide into what are referred to as Telematic Insurance. Such &#x27;telematic&#x27; policies typically are based on black-box insurance technology, such devices derive from a stolen vehicle and fleet tracking but are used for insurance purposes. Since 2010 GPS-based and Telematic Insurance systems have become more mainstream in the auto insurance market not just aimed at specialised auto-fleet markets or high value vehicles (with an emphasis on stolen vehicle recovery). Modern GPS-based systems are branded as &#x27;PAYD&#x27; Pay As You Drive insurance policies, &#x27;PHYD&#x27; Pay How You Drive or since 2012 Smartphone auto insurance policies which utilise smartphones as a GPS sensor. A detailed survey of the smartphone as measurement probe for insurance telematics is provided in 

====OBDII-based system====
The Progressive Corporation launched Snapshot to give drivers a customized insurance rate based on recording how, how much, and when their car is driven. Snapshot is currently available in 46 states plus the District of Columbia. Because insurance is regulated at the state level, Snapshot is currently not available in Alaska, California, Hawaii, and North Carolina. Driving data is transmitted to the company using an on-board telematic device. The device connects to a car&#x27;s OnBoard Diagnostic (OBD-II) port (all petrol automobiles in the USA built after 1996 have an OBD-II.) and transmits speed, time of day and number of miles the car is driven. Cars that are driven less often, in less-risky ways, and at less-risky times of day, can receive large discounts. Progressive has received patents on its methods and systems of implementing usage-based insurance and has licensed these methods and systems to other companies.

Metromile also uses an OBDII-based system for their mileage-based insurance. They offer a true pay-per-mile insurance where behavior or driving style is not taken into account, and the user only pays a base rate along with a fixed rate per mile. The OBD-II device measures mileage and then transmits mileage data to servers. This is supposed to be an affordable car insurance policy for low-mileage drivers. Metromile is currently only offering personal car insurance policies and is available in California, Oregon, Washington, and Illinois.

===Credit ratings===
Insurance companies have started using credit ratings of their policyholders to determine risk. Drivers with good credit scores get lower insurance premiums, as it is believed that they are more financially stable, more responsible and have the financial means to better maintain their vehicles. Those with lower credit scores can have their premiums raised or insurance canceled outright. It has been shown that good drivers with spotty credit records could be charged higher premiums than bad drivers with good credit records.

===Behavior-based insurance===
The use of non-intrusive load monitoring to detect drunk driving and other risky behaviors has been proposed. A US patent application combining this technology with a usage-based insurance product to create a new type of behavior based auto insurance product is currently open for public comment on peer to patent. &quot;See Behavior-based safety&quot;. Behaviour based Insurance focusing upon driving is often called Telematics or Telematics2.0 in some cases monitoring focus upon behavioural analysis such as smooth driving.

==Repair insurance==
{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=September 2012}}
Auto repair insurance is an extension of car insurance available in all 50 of the United States that covers the natural wear and tear on a vehicle, independent of damages related to a car crash.

Some drivers opt to buy the insurance as a means of protection against costly breakdowns unrelated to a crash. In contrast to more standard and basic coverages such as comprehensive and collision insurance, auto repair insurance does not cover a vehicle when it is damaged in a collision, during a natural disaster or at the hands of vandals.

For many it is an attractive option for protection after the warranties on their cars expire.

Providers can also offer sub-divisions of auto repair insurance. There is standard repair insurance which covers the wear and tear of vehicles, and naturally occurring breakdowns. Some companies will only offer mechanical breakdown insurance, which only covers repairs necessary when breakable parts need to be fixed or replaced. These parts include transmissions, oil pumps, pistons, timing gears, flywheels, valves, axles and joints.

In several countries insurance companies offer direct repair programs (DRP) so that their customers have easy access to a recommended car body repair shop. Some also offer one-stop shopping where a damaged car can get dropped off and an adjuster handles the claim, the car is fixed and often a replacement rental car is provided. When repairing the vehicle the car body repair shop is obliged to follow the instructions regarding the choice of original equipment manufacturer (OEM), original equipment supplier parts (OES), Matching Quality spare parts (MQ) and generic replacement parts. Both DRPs and non OEM parts help to keep costs down and keep insurance prices competitive. AIRC (International Car body repair Association) General Secretary Karel Bukholczer made clear that DRP&#x27;s have had big impact on car body repair shops.

<doc id="567701" wikidata="Q1189475" url="?curid=567701" title="Sylvain Grenier">
<text>Sylvain Grenier (born March 26, 1977) is a Canadian retired professional wrestler. He is best known for his tenure in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).

He is best known for his time wrestling for WWE between 2002 and 2007 where he was part of La Résistance and became a four-time World Tag Team Champion (once with René Duprée and three times with Rob Conway). After his release from WWE, Grenier became a French language commentator for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) &quot;Impact!&quot; for a number of years and continued to wrestle on the Quebec independent circuit.

==Early life==
As a child, Grenier lived with his Parents in Varennes, Quebec. Grenier played baseball, tennis and hockey at an amateur level. Grenier worked as a model.

==Professional wrestling career==
Grenier made his professional wrestling debut in 1998.

===World Wrestling Entertainment===

====Early appearances (2001–2003)====
Grenier auditioned for series one and two of &quot;Tough Enough&quot;, the reality television program produced by World Wrestling Entertainment in 2001 and 2002, but was unable to attend the selection process due to visa problems. While he was in Florida training and taking part in a modeling shoot, Grenier met WWE producer Pat Patterson, with whom he became good friends. Patterson invited Grenier to attend WWE events for a few tryout matches under the ring name &quot;Sly Grenier&quot;. Following a match, Grenier was offered a contract by WWE, and assigned to WWE developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling.

During this period, Grenier made two appearances for WWE, the first at No Way Out in 2003 as a referee during the match between The Rock and Hulk Hogan in which he helped The Rock to win that match; the other at WrestleMania XIX during the match between Hogan and Vince McMahon.

====La Résistance (2003–2005)====

On April 28, Grenier returned to WWE, debuting on the Raw brand alongside fellow French Canadian René Duprée. The duo were collectively known as &quot;La Résistance&quot;, and were billed as Frenchmen who were highly critical of American efforts in the War on Terror. Grenier and Duprée made their first appearance on the April 28 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; as La Résistance by attacking Scott Steiner who had recently made remarks comparing France to hell, offending Grenier and Duprée. La Résistance went on to feud with Scott Steiner and Test (who was being forced to be Steiner&#x27;s tag team partner by Stacy Keibler) until the Judgment Day pay-per-view where La Résistance defeated Steiner and Test.

Grenier and Duprée went on to win the World Tag Team Championship from Kane and Rob Van Dam at the 2003 Bad Blood event.&lt;ref name=&quot;grenier/dupree-tag1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After that the decision was made to add Rob Conway as a third member who began by posing as an American serviceman being abused by Grenier and Duprée until the Dudley Boyz came out to save him. Once the Dudley Boyz had their backs turned to Conway, he attacked them with the American flag they had given him before tearing it off the pole and laying it on top of them. The trio began carrying the French flag to ringside and singing the French national anthem before their matches. During their time together the trio feuded with several tag teams; including the Dudley Boyz, The Hurricane and Rosey, and Garrison Cade and Mark Jindrak.

They held the titles until Unforgiven 2003 when they dropped them to The Dudley Boyz in a three-on-two handicap tables match. During the match, Grenier suffered neck and back injuries, and was diagnosed with a broken neck a month later. The trio eventually reunited on the edition of March 15, 2004, of &quot;Raw&quot;. when Grenier returned. This reunion only lasted a week, as Dupree was drafted to &quot;SmackDown!&quot; on March 22, 2004, during the Draft Lottery.

Without Dupree, Grenier and Conway continued to team together as La Résistance on &quot;Raw&quot;. With American-Franco hostility subsiding, WWE ceased billing the team as being from France and instead promoted them as being haughty French Canadians who carried the flag of Quebec to the ring, with Grenier often singing the Canadian national anthem. Grenier has later said that he preferred teaming with Conway over Duprée, stating &quot;Rob made me love wrestling again&quot;.

The team held the World Tag Team Championship three times.&lt;ref name=&quot;grenier/conway-tag1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;grenier/conway-tag2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;grenier/conway-tag3&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Their first title reign began when they defeated Chris Benoit and Edge on the May 31, 2004, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; in Grenier&#x27;s home town of Montreal. They dropped the championship to them at Taboo Tuesday when Benoit was able to defeat both Grenier and Conway, despite Edge abandoning Benoit during the match. La Résistance re-captured the championship on the November 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; when Edge walked out on Benoit again. Two weeks later, however, in a three-way tag team elimination match, William Regal and Eugene were the last men standing, beating both La Résistance and the team of Tajiri and Rhyno. Their final Tag Team Championship win occurred at a Raw house show in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada on January 16, 2005. La Résistance defeated William Regal and Jonathan Coachman (who substituted for Eugene due to suffering an injury). La Résistance dropped the championship a few weeks later on the February 7, 2005, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; in Tokyo, Japan to William Regal and his new tag team partner Tajiri. on the March 14 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, La Résistance were defeated by The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) in a Rockers&#x27;s Reunion. at WrestleMania 21, Grenier competed in a 30-man battle royal where he was eliminated by Heidenreich.

La Résistance repeatedly attempted to regain the title, mainly on &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;, but fell short during each one. La Résistance were given another chance at Regal and Tajiri during a Tag Team Turmoil match involving five teams during Backlash. In the match, La Résistance managed to eliminate the current champions but were defeated by the last remaining team, Hurricane and Rosey.

The team split in mid-May 2005 after repeatedly quarreling over which of them was the superior wrestler. Grenier and Conway went into singles competition with announcers claiming that the members of La Résistance were trying to &quot;one up&quot; each other in singles matches without the other man in their corner. This saw Conway defeat a jobber and Val Venis, while Grenier was defeated by both Val Venis and Chris Jericho before both men competed in a triple threat match (with Intercontinental Champion Shelton Benjamin for the title), Benjamin won the match after the La Résistance members began to argue and fight with each other. The altercation between the two led to a main event match for the edition of June 12, 2005, of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;. This match saw Conway portray the heel, and defeat Grenier.

====Singles competition (2005–2006)====
Grenier was a last minute trade in the 2005 WWE Draft, forcing him to leave Raw and go to SmackDown! ending his already shakey tag team partnership with Conway. After being traded he was not seen on television for a few months, eventually re-debuting on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; on September 1, 2005. He was repackaged with a gimmick of a narcissistic male supermodel known simply as &quot;Sylvain&quot;, though his name was later tweaked to &quot;Sylvan&quot;, the same spelling that was used in the original La Resistance vignettes. His new gimmick saw him speak with a light French accent, wear sunglasses and use techno music for his entrance.

Sylvan soon began a brief feud with Hardcore Holly, which saw Sylvan determined to protect his &quot;perfect face&quot; at any cost. Sylvan gained a victory over Holly on the October 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; with help from Mr. Kennedy. At No Mercy 2005 after Kennedy defeated Holly, Sylvan came out and continued his feud with him by attacking the injured Holly, which led to Sylvan losing a singles match on an episode of &quot;Velocity&quot; and a hardcore match the following week on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, ending an almost two-month feud. Sylvan entered the 2006 Royal Rumble, but was quickly eliminated by Bobby Lashley. After this, Sylvan slowly reverted to using anti-American tactics while still retaining his model gimmick. However, this change was short-lived and he was soon taken off of television, where he began wrestling in dark matches before &quot;SmackDown!&quot; tapings and in OVW.

On the June 16, 2006, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; vignettes designed to look like vacation promotion videos for Quebec and starring Sylvan (&quot;the Ambassador at Large for the Beautiful Province of Québec&quot;, or &quot;the Ambassador of Québec&quot; for short) began airing. On July 7 he appeared in-ring to cut a promo attempting to &quot;make peace&quot; with the US fans by welcoming them to visit his home province. The fans responded with a chorus of boos and a loud &quot;USA&quot; chant. In the coming weeks he continued to appear backstage, telling everyone within earshot how much better Québec was than where ever they were from. He made his ring return with this gimmick on the July 28 &quot;SmackDown!&quot; with a win over Tatanka. Sylvan would go on to job against the likes of Tatanka, Vito, and Batista under this gimmick. Sylvan&#x27;s losing streak ended on the first CW Network episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; on September 22, 2006, when he defeated Tatanka again by using the ring ropes for illegal leverage. The following week on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Sylvan defeated Jimmy Wang Yang, who had insulted Canada the week before. The next week, Sylvan cheated again to take a lead in the feud. The following week, Sylvan finally lost to Yang in a six-man tag team match. After disappearing for a couple of weeks, Sylvan finally returned to cost Yang a match versus Gregory Helms. After that match, Matt Hardy came out to help Yang ward off Helms and Sylvan. The following week, Hardy and Yang defeated Helms and Sylvan, ending Sylvan&#x27;s feud with Yang.

====La Résistance reunion (2006–2007)====
Sylvan returned to OVW on November 15, making a surprise appearance as Sylvain Grenier, teaming with Rob Conway to reform their La Résistance. The reformed team defeated Cody Runnels and Shawn Spears to earn a shot at the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship, but were unsuccessful in the title match. On the December 22 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, he disguised himself as Santa Claus and attacked World Heavyweight Champion Batista with a steel pipe. This resulted in a match with Batista that Sylvan quickly lost and would end the &quot;Ambassador of Québec&quot; gimmick as Sylvan disappeared from television after this.

On the February 20, 2007, episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, Grenier returned and reformed the original La Résistance with René Duprée, defeating a pair of local wrestlers. Due to Duprée getting suspended at the start of March, however, and being sent to rehab after violating the Health and Wellness policy, the team was quietly disbanded. At the August 7, 2007, taping of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Sylvan made his televised return under his old model gimmick in a match against Kane, which he lost. This would turn out to be Grenier&#x27;s final match for WWE, as he was released from his contract on August 13.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2007–2009)===
On November 29, 2007, Grenier debuted as a French language commentator for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling&#x27;s (TNA) &quot;Impact!&quot; television show on Réseau des sports (RDS). During his time with TNA, he embarked on a feud with former commentator Pierre Carl Ouellet, with Grenier claiming that he was the better commentator. They settled their feud in a match in Hawkesbury, Ontario, on June 21, 2008, in which Ouellet was victorious. Greiner was released in 2009.

===Independent circuit (2008–2018; 2018–2019)===

Grenier returned to the independent circuit in January 2008 at International Wrestling Syndicate&#x27;s Praise The Violence where he lost to Kevin Steen in an IWS Heavyweight Championship number one contendership match. On August 30, 2008, Grenier reunited with Rob Conway to reform La Résistance, and they defeated Karl Briscoe and Jay Phenomenon to win Northern Championship Wrestling&#x27;s Tag Team Championship. before losing them to Kid Rock and Gorgeous Mike on October 25. On December 20, at NCW&#x27;s Noël D&#x27;Enfer event, Grenier defeated Samson to win the Quebec Championship. He would hold the title for over 50 days before losing it to Nova Cain on February 7, 2009. On April 17, 2009, he appeared for Ring of Honor, competing in a six-man tag match, in which he teamed with The American Wolves (Davey Richards and Eddie Edwards) in a loss to Bryan Danielson, Kevin Steen and El Generico. On November 22, 2009, Grenier defeated Darkko to win the Combat Revolution Wrestling (CRW) Quebec Championship. He lost the championship to Darkko on February 21, 2010.

On March 5, 2010, Grenier debuted as a new gimmick, known as Iceman at his TOW Wrestling show. In a match at a CRW show, he defeated the highflying Van Hawk, a mainstay in the independent circuit of Quebec. Later that night, in his usual persona, Grenier recaptured the CRW Quebec Championship by defeating Darkko and Dru Onyx in a casket match at a TOW show, before losing it to Darkko two days later. In November 2011, Greiner toured several European countries as part of American Wrestling Rampage, where he predominantly teamed with former La Résistance partner René Duprée.

On November 1, 2012, Grenier decided he will be taking a break from wrestling for a while. On November 13, 2012, Grenier came to the rescue of Alex Shelley on a PPV event.
Grenier made an announcement on November 1, 2012, that he will have a few matches. Grenier faced Juice Robinson, Jay White on November 16, 2012, in a handicap match. On November 18, 2012, Grenier had a match against Kushida but lost to Kushida by distraction of Kyosuke Mikami, Katsuyori Shibata, Cliff Compton coming to the ring. Grenier became the World Lutte TOW Wrestling Champion for 389 days, but lost it to Thomas Dubois.

On January 19, 2018, Grenier announced his retirement via Twitter, but ended his retirement on October 27, 2018, returning to the ring for La Lutte C Vrai against Franky the Mobster. Grenier continued to compete on the Quebec independent wrestling circuit before returning to WWE.

===Return to WWE (2020)===
On January 19, 2020, it was announced that Grenier had returned to WWE as a backstage producer. He was fired during the year, along with many other wrestlers and producers as a cost-cutting measure.

<doc id="567703" wikidata="Q3031845" url="?curid=567703" title="Grinspoon">
<text>Grinspoon are an Australian rock band from Lismore, New South Wales, formed in 1995 and fronted by Phil Jamieson on vocals and guitar with Pat Davern on guitar, Joe Hansen on bass guitar and Kristian Hopes on drums. Also in 1995, Grinspoon won the Triple J–sponsored Unearthed competition for Lismore, with their post-grunge song &quot;Sickfest&quot;. The name &quot;Grinspoon&quot; was taken from Dr. Lester Grinspoon, an associate professor emeritus of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, who supported marijuana for medical use.

The Grinspoon sound changed to more mainstream rock at the release of their 2002 album, &quot;New Detention&quot;, gaining fans and peaking at No. 2 on the ARIA Albums Charts; similarly, 2007&#x27;s &quot;Alibis &amp; Other Lies&quot; also reached No. 2. The 2004 album, &quot;Thrills, Kills &amp; Sunday Pills&quot;, which peaked at No. 4, won the 2005 Best Rock Album Award at the ARIA Music Awards.

The band was signed to Universal Records in the United States by late 1998, and they were promoted with the songs &quot;Champion&quot;, which featured in &quot;Gran Turismo 3&quot;; &quot;Post Enebriated Anxiety&quot;, which was on the international version of &quot;Guide to Better Living&quot;; &quot;Chemical Heart&quot;, via the internet; and a cover of the Prong song &quot;Snap Your Fingers, Snap Your Neck&quot;, from Grinspoon&#x27;s &quot;Pushing Buttons&quot; EP, which was included on &quot;&quot;. On 4 December 2013, the band members announced an indefinite hiatus to pursue individual projects, although they made a return in earnest in 2017.

== History ==
=== 1995-2000: Early years ===
In July 1995, Pat Davern (guitar), Joe Hansen (bass), Kristian Hopes (drums) and Phil Jamieson (vocals, guitar) met at a Lismore hotel, The Gollan, for a jam night—they decided to form a band and enter the Triple J-sponsored Unearthed competition. Their name was taken from Dr. Lester Grinspoon, an associate professor emeritus of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, who supported marijuana for medical use. After winning the competition, with their post-grunge song &quot;Sickfest&quot;, they gained considerable airplay on Triple J and independent radio stations and used this to secure gigs. They developed a strong following among the Australian &quot;alternative&quot; and &quot;mosh pit crowd.&quot; Their debut was the six-track EP, &quot;Grinspoon&quot; (aka &quot;Green Album&quot;), which was released in 1995 through the independent Oracle Records. It contained the songs &quot;Sickfest&quot; and &quot;More Than You Are&quot; that became popular with fans and were rerecorded on later releases.

Grinspoon&#x27;s second EP, &quot;Licker Bottle Cozy&quot;, recorded in June 1996 and produced by Phil McKellar, was released by Grudge Records in December. It had a slightly heavier sound than their earlier EP with five tracks including the songs &quot;Champion&quot; and &quot;Pig Pen&quot;. In September 1997 they released their first full-length album, &quot;Guide to Better Living&quot;, co-produced by McKellar and well-known Swiss-American heavy metal producer Ulrich Wild. The album peaked at No. 11 on the ARIA Albums Charts and went platinum with sales of over 70,000 in Australia. It represents the Helmet-influenced alternative metal sound of their early career with heavier songs like &quot;Pressure Tested 1984&quot;. The Australian version of the album features five live songs—illustrating the band&#x27;s sense of humour and ability to play live—and a hidden track, the acoustic &quot;Protest&quot;. US branch of Universal Records signed the band by late 1998 and released an altered version of &quot;Guide to Better Living&quot; in March 1999.

Whilst in US touring for ten months as support act for Creed, Lit, Godsmack and Anthrax, Grinspoon released a six track EP, &quot;Pushing Buttons&quot;, for their Australian market in September 1998. It featured the popular heavy song &quot;Black Friday&quot; and the lighter songs &quot;Busy&quot; and &quot;Explain&quot;. After the intense US touring, Grinspoon released their second album, &quot;Easy&quot; in September 1999, which peaked at No. 4 and went platinum in Australia. It contained the singles &quot;Ready 1&quot; and &quot;Rock Show&quot;.

=== 2001-2007: Changing direction ===
After a break to reconsider their direction and sound Grinspoon started recording their next album, &quot;New Detention&quot;, in Sydney&#x27;s Festival Studios in September 2001 but prior to finishing the studios were shut down and so vocals and guitars were recorded in smaller studios. Further delays occurred after Hopes injured his hand on a studio window. &quot;New Detention&quot; was released in June 2002 and was more commercial—it peaked at No. 2 on the ARIA Albums Charts and went platinum. The first single from the album, &quot;Chemical Heart&quot;, released in February had created a stir with long term fans and the media because it was different from their previous grunge sound. The band insisted the change was a natural one and was an improvement. Nevertheless, the band still performs older tracks in their live shows. They released a four track EP in March 2003, &quot;Panic Attack&quot;—containing a cover of INXS&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Change&quot;—which reached No. 13 on the ARIA Singles Chart.

In August 2004, they released a new single, &quot;Hard Act To Follow&quot;, which reached the Top 30. It was from the September album &quot;Thrills, Kills &amp; Sunday Pills&quot;, which peaked at No. 4 and went platinum. Grinspoon also performed at the 2004 NRL grand final before a second single, &quot;Better Off Alone&quot;, issued in November, also reached the Top 30. The third single was &quot;Hold on Me&quot; released in February 2005. For &quot;Thrills, Kills &amp; Sunday Pills&quot;, the band agreed that they were deliberately seeking a new audience, claiming they wrote a number of songs for the release and rejected any that sounded like earlier work. It won the 2005 &#x27;Best Rock Album Award&#x27; at the ARIA Music Awards. They had previously been nominated 9 times.

Grinspoon had built a strong local following after their rise, they were regulars at Australian music festivals. On 26 March 2006, Grinspoon performed &quot;Hard Act To Follow&quot; and &quot;Better Off Alone&quot; at the 2006 Commonwealth Games Closing Ceremony in Melbourne. They headlined the inaugural &quot;Thank God It&#x27;s Over&quot; in Melbourne, at &quot;BOBFest &#x27;06&quot; in South Australia in October and at Odyssey 2006 at Dreamworld for New Year&#x27;s Eve.

In February 2007, Jamieson admitted himself to rehab due to addiction to crystal methamphetamine. On Andrew Denton&#x27;s &quot;Enough Rope&quot; in July, Jamieson discussed his drug addictions, an extramarital affair, stealing money from bandmates, detox and rehab experiences.

The band completed, &quot;Alibis &amp; Other Lies&quot; in July 2007, as their final album for Universal. It was co-produced by the band and Ramesh Sathiah, who had worked with them on their earliest recordings. Earlier albums before this were pop-oriented rock, while &quot;Easy&quot; and &quot;Alibis &amp; Other Lies&quot; were more heavy rock. The first single from the album, &quot;Black Tattoo&quot;, was released as a digital download on 23 June and physically a week later. The album peaked at No. 2, their equal highest album chart position (with &quot;New Detention&quot; in 2002). Grinspoon released a 2-disc compilation entitled &quot;Best in Show&quot;. The first disc featured their hits and several older songs, like &quot;Champion&quot;, which landed the song on &quot;Gran Turismo 3&quot;. The second disc includes a collection of covers recorded over the years. In the US, all Grinspoon albums had been released on iTunes and other online music stores. The first four were &quot;Guide To Better Living&quot;, &quot;Best In Show&quot;, &quot;Thrills, Kills, and Sunday Pills&quot;, and &quot;New Detention&quot;. &quot;Easy&quot; and &quot;Alibis &amp; Other Lies&quot; followed on 31 October 2007.

=== 2008-2009: Hiatus ===
On 5 February 2008, Jamieson announced, via the band&#x27;s official website, that Grinspoon were on hiatus following their appearance at Big Day Out in late January. Grinspoon headlined the Newton&#x27;s Playground festival, held atop Bathurst&#x27;s famous Mount Panorama in March, with their song &quot;Lost Control&quot; played in advertisements for the festival. On 1 May, Grinspoon announced they would complete more shows before writing a new album.

Grinspoon recorded The Easybeats&#x27; track &quot;St. Louis&quot; for a tribute album, &quot;Easy Fever: A Tribute to The Easybeats and Stevie Wright&quot;—released in October 2008—while Jamieson&#x27;s duet with The Wrights on &quot;Evie part 3: I&#x27;m Losing You&quot; from 2005 was included. The band contributed the track &quot;Blind Lead Blind&quot;, their B side of 2007&#x27;s &quot;Minute By Minute&quot;, to a compilation CD for The Buttery Drug and Alcohol Rehab Centre titled &quot;Caution: Life Ahead&quot;, which included contributions from other Australian acts such as Powderfinger, Midnight Oil and The Living End, and was released in November.

Grinspoon performed on 26 July 2009 at the annual Splendour in the Grass Festival in Byron Bay. Jamieson then toured with a supergroup composed of The Living End&#x27;s Chris Cheney, You Am I&#x27;s Tim Rogers, and Josh Pyke with a 17-piece band in August 2009. The group performed a tribute to The Beatles&#x27; White Album for its 40th anniversary.

=== 2010: &quot;Six to Midnight&quot; ===
Grinspoon&#x27;s next album, titled &quot;Six to Midnight&quot;, was released on 11 September 2009 on the band&#x27;s imprint Chk Chk Boom Records, distributed by Universal Records, which peaked at No. 6. Two tracks, &quot;Dogs&quot; and the first single, &quot;Comeback&quot;, were released to radio earlier. For promotion of the album, the band toured in a more intimate setting than most of their previous concerts. On 6 November, Grinspoon played live on Triple J radio and confirmed that &quot;Summer&quot; was the second single from the album. In 2010 Premonitions was released as the third single from the album. The band toured for the album including two acoustic shows in London in early 2012 featuring Phil and Pat.

=== 2011–2019: &quot;Black Rabbits&quot; and hiatus ===
In September 2011 Grinspoon announced on their website that they are writing and recording their seventh studio album.

In May 2012 the band announced that they were heading to the United States for a month to record the album. The band also hinted that the title of the album would be &quot;Black Rabbits&quot;. The album was later slated to feature guest musicians including Chris Cheney of The Living End, Tim Rogers of You Am I and Scott Russo of Unwritten Law.

On 23 July 2012, Grinspoon released the artwork of the album on their official Facebook page, confirming the name of the release &quot;Black Rabbits&quot;.

The album was released on 28 September, debuting at number 8 on the ARIA charts.

On 5 December 2013 a statement on the official Grinspoon website announced that the band would be going on hiatus. A section of the statement reads: &quot;Thanks to all our families, friends, and especially our fans for the support over the last 18 years – it&#x27;s been a wild ride to say the least. We are still a band of brothers but it&#x27;s time for us to take a break and recharge the batteries. We&#x27;re excited to see what our future holds…adios amigos, it&#x27;s been a blast!&quot;

In August 2015, it was announced that the band would be reforming exclusively to play a run of dates opening for Cold Chisel.

In 2017, the band announced they would be re-releasing a special 20th Anniversary edition of Guide To Better Living and announced an Australia wide tour. The tour was sold out.

In 2019, the group released the compilation, &quot;Chemical Hearts&quot;.

=== 2020–present: &quot;Whatever, Whatever&quot; ===
In May 2024, the group released the single &quot;Unknown Pretenders&quot;, which was written in February 2020. At the same time, they announced the release of their eighth studio album &quot;Whatever, Whatever&quot;.

<doc id="567709" wikidata="Q27164" url="?curid=567709" title="Leucanthemum vulgare">
<text>Leucanthemum vulgare, commonly known as the ox-eye daisy, oxeye daisy, dog daisy, marguerite (, &quot;common marguerite&quot;) and other common names, is a widespread flowering plant native to Europe and the temperate regions of Asia, and an introduced plant to North America, Australia and New Zealand.

==Description==
&quot;L. vulgare&quot; is a perennial herb that grows to a height of and has a creeping underground rhizome. The lower parts of the stem are hairy, sometimes densely hairy but more or less in the lower parts. The largest leaves are at the base of the plant and are long, about wide and have a petiole. These leaves have up to 15 teeth, or lobes or both on the edges. The leaves decrease in size up the stem, the upper leaves up to long, lack a petiole and are deeply toothed.

The plant bears up to three &quot;flowers&quot; like those of a typical daisy. Each is a &quot;head&quot; or capitulum wide. Each head has between fifteen and forty white &quot;petals&quot; (ray florets) long surrounding the yellow disc florets. Below the head is an involucre of glabrous green bracts long with brownish edges. Flowering occurs from May to October. The seed-like achenes are long and have ten &quot;ribs&quot; along their edges but lack a pappus.

Ox-eye daisy is similar to shasta daisy (&quot;Leucanthemum&quot; × &quot;superbum&quot;) which has larger flower heads ( wide) and to stinking chamomile (&quot;Anthemis cotula&quot;) which has smaller heads ( wide). &quot;L. maximum&quot; is also similar, usually with rays in length.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;L. vulgare&quot; was first formally described in 1778 by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who published the description in &quot;Flore françoise&quot;. It is also known by the common names ox-eye daisy, dog daisy, field daisy, Marguerite, moon daisy, moon-penny, poor-land penny, poverty daisy and white daisy.

The species was formerly described as part of the &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot; genus.

==Distribution and habitat==

The species is native to Europe, and to Turkey and Georgia in Western Asia. It is a typical grassland perennial wildflower, growing in a variety of plant communities including meadows and fields, under scrub and open-canopy forests, and in disturbed areas. The species is widely naturalised in many parts of the world, including North America, and is considered to be an invasive species in more than forty countries. It grows in temperate regions where average annual rainfall exceeds , and often where soils are heavy and damp. It is often a weed of degraded pastures and roadsides.

==Ecology==
The species spreads by seeds and by shallow, creeping rhizomes. A mature plant can produce up to 26,000 seeds that are spread by animals, vehicles, water and contaminated agricultural produce, and some seeds remain viable for up to nearly forty years. It is not palatable to cattle and reduces the amount of quality pasture available for grazing. In native landscapes such as the Kosciuszko National Park in Australia, dense infestation can exclude native plants, causing soil erosion and loss of soil organic matter.

This plant was top-ranked for pollen production per floral unit sampled at the level of the entire capitulum, with a value of 15.9 ± 2 μL, in a UK study of meadow flowers.

===As an invasive species===
&quot;L. vulgare&quot; is one of the most widespread weeds in the Anthemideae. It became an introduced species via gardens into natural areas in parts of Canada, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. In some habitats it forms dense colonies displacing native plants and modifying existing communities.

The plant commonly invades lawns, and is difficult to control or eradicate, since a new plant can regenerate from rhizome fragments and is a problem in pastures where beef and dairy cattle graze, as usually they will not eat it, thus enabling it to spread; cows who do eat it produce milk with an undesirable flavor. It has been shown to carry several crop diseases.

This species has been declared an environmental weed in New South Wales and Victoria. In New South Wales it grows from Glen Innes on the Northern Tablelands to Bombala in the far southeast of the state, and there are significant populations in the Kosciuszko National Park where it has invaded subalpine grassland, snowgum (&quot;Eucalyptus pauciflora&quot;) woodland and wetlands. In Victoria it is a prohibited species and must be eradicated or controlled.

==Uses==
===Food===
The unopened flower buds can be marinated and used in a similar way to capers.

Maud Grieve&#x27;s &quot;Modern Herbal&quot; (1931) states that &quot;The taste of the dried herb is bitter and tingling, and the odour faintly resembles that of valerian.&quot;

===Tea===
Oxeye grows wild in the Arava Desert in Southern Israel, where the flowers are picked and dried and traditionally used by Jewish Israelis to make a local variety of herbal tea.

===Use in horticulture===
&quot;L. vulgare&quot; is widely cultivated and available as a perennial flowering ornamental plant for gardens and designed meadow landscapes. It thrives in a wide range of conditions but prefers a sunny or part-sun location of average soil that is damp (like many in the daisy family). The plant does well in raised and mulched garden beds that retain moisture and prevent weeds. It is a mesophyte and therefore requires more or less a continuous water supply. The heads of faded and old blooms are often deadheaded to promote further blooming and to maintain the appearance of the plant. There are cultivars, such as &#x27;May Queen&#x27;, that begin blooming in early spring.

==Allergies==
Allergies to daisies do occur, usually causing contact dermatitis.

==Symbolism==
Since 1987 the daisy, specifically either oxeye daisy or the marguerite daisy (&quot;Argyranthemum frutescens&quot;), replaced red clover (&quot;Trifolium pratense&quot;) as the national flower of Denmark. Over time oxeye daisy has become more popular as it is native to Denmark, in contrast to the marguerite daisy.

It is also a popular symbol for Latvia. In an open vote by the botanical society in 1994 it was selected as the national flower.

<text>Earl Manvers was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1806 for Charles Medows Pierrepont, 1st Viscount Newark. He had already been created Baron Pierrepont, of Holme Pierrepont in the County of Nottingham, and Viscount Newark, of Newark-on-Trent in the County of Nottingham, in 1796. Both these titles were in the Peerage of Great Britain. 

Born Charles Medows, he was the second son of Philip Meadows (1708-1781), Deputy Ranger of Richmond Park, by Lady Frances Pierrepont (1711-1795), daughter of William Pierrepont, Earl of Kingston (1692–1713), eldest son and heir apparent of Evelyn Pierrepont, 1st Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull. The name of the earldom derives from the Manvers family, from a marriage to an heiress of which family (Annora de Manvers) the family seat of Holme Pierrepont (formerly simply Holme) had passed into the Pierrepont family in the 13th century.

In 1788 Charles Medows had succeeded to the Pierrepont estates on the death of the second Duke&#x27;s wife, and assumed the same year by Royal sign manual the surname of Pierrepont in lieu of Medows. Manvers&#x27;s eldest son Evelyn Pierrepont predeceased him and he was succeeded by his second son Charles, the second Earl. He was a naval commander and Member of Parliament. He was succeeded by his second and only surviving son, Sydney, the third Earl. He represented Nottinghamshire South in Parliament. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Charles, the fourth Earl. He sat as Conservative Member of Parliament for Newark, elected on four occasions. On his death the titles passed to his only son Evelyn, the fifth Earl. He suffered a mental breakdown at the age of 17 and never married.

The fifth Earl was succeeded by his cousin Gervas Pierrepont, the sixth Earl. He was the only son of the Hon Evelyn Henry Pierrepont (1856–1926), second son of the third Earl. The sixth Earl&#x27;s only son died as a child and the Earldom and subsidiary titles became extinct on the Earl&#x27;s death in 1955.

Other members of the family may also be mentioned. Edward Medows (died 1813), brother of the first Earl, was a captain in the Royal Navy. Sir William Medows, brother of the first Earl, was a General in the British Army. The Honourable Henry Pierrepont, third son of the first Earl, was a diplomat.

The ancestral seat of the Earls Manvers was Thoresby Hall, near Ollerton, Nottinghamshire. The hall itself, built in the 1860s by the third Earl to the designs of Anthony Salvin was the 3rd building on the site replacing a smaller Georgian house which in turn had replaced a large Baroque house designed by Talman which had burned down. It remained the home of the last Countess Manvers until her death aged 95 in 1984 and was subsequently sold by the family and is now a hotel and conference venue. The Thoresby wider agricultural and forestry estate remains with the descendants of the Pierreponts and they have built a new Country House elsewhere on the Estate.

A comprehensive school named after him Manvers Pierrepont Comprehensive, Carlton Road, Nottingham. The school site still exists but rationalisation transformed it to a College of Further Education.

<text>Pittsburgh Filmmakers was one of the oldest and largest media arts centers in the United States, operating from 1971 to 2019.

The non-profit institution in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania began as a filmmaking equipment access cooperative founded by curator Sally Dixon in 1971. The co-op remained a pillar of the organization throughout its life, supporting projects that grew to include a NASAD-accredited film school, the Three Rivers Film Festival, and three repertory theaters—most prominently the Harris Theater, which remains in operation under the management of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust.

Artist alumni of Pittsburgh Filmmakers include Peggy Ahwesh, Tony Buba, Greg Mottola, and Victoria Pedretti.

==History==
Starting in 1969, Chuck Glassmire hosted an experimental film series at the Crumbling Wall coffeehouse at 4515 Forbes Ave. The screenings drew a regular audience from the Carnegie Museum of Art across the street, where Dixon was in the process of launching the museum&#x27;s Film Section (later Department of Film and Video), one of the first of its kind in the country. In 1970, Dixon raised funding for an expanded screening program, bringing visiting artists to town for in-person exhibitions and providing 16mm filmmaking equipment so that they could also work on new films while in residence. At first called &quot;Pittsburgh Independent Film-Makers,&quot; her group secured a space in the basement of the Selma Burke Arts Center at 6118 Penn Circle South in East Liberty. They set up darkrooms and filmmaking facilities, and began to offer workshops in the use of equipment.

In 1971, the group formally incorporated under the name Pittsburgh Filmmakers, with Bob Costa (1971) as its first executive director, followed by Phil Curry (1971-1973) and Robert Haller (1973-1979). Haller, a photographer and curator at Anthology Film Archives in New York, supported the addition of still photography to the organization&#x27;s mandate. In 1974, when lack of space became an issue, the University of Pittsburgh offered Filmmakers an empty building at 205 Oakland Ave., in the heart of the Oakland university district, for use as an equipment facility. Subsequent executive directors of the organization were Marilyn Levin (1979-1983), Bob Marinaccio (1983-1987), Jan Erlich-Moss (1987), Tony Buba (1988), Margaret Meyers (1988-1991), Kurt Saunders (1991-1992), Marcia Clark (1992), and Brady Lewis (1992). By 1992, the organization had grown to a staff of 18 full-time and 8 part-time employees, and was operating at three more locations—a classroom and editing facility at 218 Oakland Ave., administrative offices around the corner at 3712 Forbes Ave., and the screening program at the Fulton Theater Annex in the Fulton Building at 101 Sixth St.

The organization&#x27;s longest-serving executive director, Charlie Humphrey (1992-2015), began his tenure with a campaign to modernize and unify the facilities in one location. In the summer of 1995, Pittsburgh Filmmakers opened the doors at 477 Melwood Ave., its home for the next 23 years. The space, formerly used as Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s Tartan Labs, contained an equipment room, classrooms, darkrooms, offices, a cafe, a library, and the 130-seat Melwood Screening Room. That same year, the screening program moved temporarily to a Point Park College venue at 222 Craft Ave., and then found a permanent home at the Harris Theater, a former X-rated movie house at 809 Liberty Ave. in the downtown Cultural District. In early 1998, Filmmakers also purchased the Regent Square Theater, at 1035 South Braddock Ave. The film school received accreditation in 1999, and spurred the introduction of DV video equipment for student use. In 2001, at the organization&#x27;s point of maximum development, a renovation of the second floor of 477 Melwood added more offices and classrooms, digital editing suites, a sound stage, a gallery for photo exhibitions, and an additional 60-seat theater.

In 2003, a number of the institutional connections that had existed since Pittsburgh Filmmakers&#x27; founding were severed. The Carnegie Museum of Art closed its film department, and Point Park College became the first of the organization&#x27;s partner schools to start its own competing in-house film degree program. In 2006, Pittsburgh Filmmakers merged with the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts (PCA), following votes by the organizations&#x27; respective membership and boards; the combined organization took the new name Pittsburgh Filmmakers/Pittsburgh Center for the Arts (PF/PCA) and used the PCA&#x27;s Marshall Mansion building in Shadyside as its headquarters. In 2010, PF/PCA attempted further merger discussions with the Pittsburgh Glass Center, but negotiations failed by May 2011. In 2015, Humphrey resigned as executive director. The last executive directors of the organization while it retained the Pittsburgh Filmmakers name were Pete Mendes (2015-2016), Germaine Williams (2017-2018), and Dan Demicell (2018).

==Dissolution==
In 2018, classes were cancelled and the 477 Melwood building was sold back to CMU. PF/PCA consolidated at the Marshall Mansion location and rebranded as the Pittsburgh Center for Arts and Media (PCA&amp;M). In 2019, the Regent Square Theater was closed, all film operations were ended, and the school&#x27;s accreditation was withdrawn.

<text>Viscount Newark is a title that has been created twice in British history, each time with the subsidiary title of Baron Pierrepont.

The first creation was on 29 June 1627 in the Peerage of England for Sir Robert Pierrepont. This creation was to become the courtesy title for the heir apparent to the Earldom of Kingston-upon-Hull, with this title being bestowed on the first Viscount Newark in 1628. The fifth Earl was created Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull in 1715 in the Peerage of Great Britain, with the Dukedom becoming extinct on the death of the second Duke in 1773.

The second creation was on 23 July 1796 in the Peerage of Great Britain for Charles Pierrepont, with the territorial designation of &quot;Newark on Trent&quot;. The first Viscount of this creation was the grandson of the first Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull, and was named as the heir of the second Duke in his will. The first Viscount succeeded to the Duke&#x27;s estates (though not his titles) on the death of the Duke&#x27;s wife in 1788. He was further created Earl Manvers in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1806. These titles became extinct upon the death of the sixth Earl in 1955.

<text>A zero-crossing is a point where the sign of a mathematical function changes (e.g. from positive to negative), represented by an intercept of the axis (zero value) in the graph of the function. It is a commonly used term in electronics, mathematics, acoustics, and image processing.

==In electronics==
In alternating current, the zero-crossing is the instantaneous point at which there is no voltage present. In a sine wave or other simple waveform, this normally occurs twice during each cycle. It is a device for detecting the point where the voltage crosses zero in either direction.

The zero-crossing is important for systems that send digital data over AC circuits, such as modems, X10 home automation control systems, and Digital Command Control type systems for Lionel and other AC model trains.

Counting zero-crossings is also a method used in speech processing to estimate the fundamental frequency of speech.

In a system where an amplifier with digitally controlled gain is applied to an input signal, artifacts in the non-zero output signal occur when the gain of the amplifier is abruptly switched between its discrete gain settings. At audio frequencies, such as in modern consumer electronics like digital audio players, these effects are clearly audible, resulting in a &#x27;zipping&#x27; sound when rapidly ramping the gain or a soft &#x27;click&#x27; when a single gain change is made. Artifacts are disconcerting and clearly not desirable. If changes are made only at zero-crossings of the input signal, then no matter how the amplifier gain setting changes, the output also remains at zero, thereby minimizing the change. (The instantaneous change in gain will still produce distortion, but it will not produce a click.)

If electrical power is to be switched, no electrical interference is generated if switched at an instant when there is no current—a zero crossing. Early light dimmers and similar devices generated interference; later versions were designed to switch at the zero crossing.

==In signal processing==
In the field of digital image processing, great emphasis is placed on operators that seek out edges within an image. They are called &quot;edge detection&quot; or &quot;gradient filters&quot;. A gradient filter is a filter that seeks out areas of rapid change in pixel value. These points usually mark an edge or a boundary. A Laplace filter is a filter that fits in this family, though it sets about the task in a different way. It seeks out points in the signal stream where the digital signal of an image passes through a pre-set &#x27;0&#x27; value, and marks this out as a potential edge point. Because the signal has crossed through the point of zero, it is called a zero-crossing. An example can be found here, including the source in Java.

In the field of industrial radiography, it is used as a simple method for the segmentation of potential defects.

In the field of NLP, the rate of zero crossings observed in a spectrogram can be used to distinguish between certain phonemes such as fricatives, voiceless stops, and vowels.

<text>A mower is a person or machine that cuts (mows) grass or other plants that grow on the ground. Usually mowing is distinguished from reaping, which uses similar implements, but is the traditional term for harvesting grain crops, e.g. with reapers and combines.

A smaller mower used for lawns and sports grounds (playing fields) is called a &quot;lawn mower&quot; or &quot;grounds mower&quot;, which is often self-powered, or may also be small enough to be pushed by the operator. Grounds mowers have reel or rotary cutters.
Larger mowers or &quot;mower-conditioners&quot; are mainly used to cut grass (or other crops) for hay or silage and often place the cut material into rows, which are referred to as &quot;windrows&quot;. &quot;Swathers&quot; (or &quot;windrowers&quot;) are also used to cut grass (and grain crops). Prior to the invention and adoption of mechanized mowers, (and today in places where use a mower is impractical or uneconomical), grass and grain crops were cut by hand using scythes or sickles.

== Mower configurations ==

Larger mowers are usually &quot;ganged&quot; (equipped with a number or gang of similar cutting units), so they can adapt individually to ground contours. They may be powered and drawn by a tractor or draft animals. The cutting units can be mounted underneath the tractor between the front and rear wheels, mounted on the back with a three-point hitch or pulled behind the tractor as a trailer. There are also dedicated self-propelled cutting machines, which often have the mower units mounted at the front and sides for easy visibility by the driver. &quot;Boom&quot; or &quot;side-arm&quot; mowers are mounted on long hydraulic arms, similar to a backhoe arm, which allows the tractor to mow steep banks or around objects while remaining on a safer surface.

== Mower types ==
The cutting mechanism in a mower may be one of several different designs:

=== Sickle mower ===

&quot;Sickle mowers&quot;, also called &quot;reciprocating mowers&quot;, &quot;bar mowers&quot;, &quot;sickle-bar mowers&quot;, or &quot;finger-bar mowers&quot;, have a long (typically six to seven and a half feet) bar on which are mounted fingers with stationary guardplates. In a channel on the bar there is a reciprocating sickle with very sharp sickle sections (triangular blades). The sickle bar is driven back and forth along the channel. The grass, or other plant matter, is cut between the sharp edges of the sickle sections and the finger-plates (this action can be likened to an electric hair clipper).

The bar rides on the ground, supported on a skid at the inner end, and it can be tilted to adjust the height of the cut. A spring-loaded board at the outer end of the bar guides the cut hay away from the uncut hay. The so-formed channel, between cut and uncut material, allows the mower skid to ride in the channel and cut only uncut grass cleanly on the next swath. These were the first successful horse-drawn mowers on farms and the general principles still guide the design of modern mowers.

=== Rotary mower ===

Rotary mowers, also called &quot;drum mowers&quot;, have a rapidly rotating bar, or disks mounted on a bar, with sharpened edges that cut the crop. When these mowers are tractor-mounted they are easily capable of mowing grass at up to 10 miles per hour (16 km/h) in optimal conditions. Some models are designed to be mounted in double and triple sets on a tractor, one in the front and one at each side, thus able to cut up to 20 foot (6 metre) swaths.

In rough cutting conditions, the blades attached to the disks are swivelled to absorb blows from obstructions. Mostly these are rear-mounted units and in some countries are called &quot;scrub cutters&quot;. Self-powered mowers of this type are used for rougher grass in gardening and other land maintenance.

=== Reel mower ===

&quot;Reel mowers&quot;, also called &quot;cylinder mowers&quot; (familiar as the hand-pushed or self-powered cylinder lawn mower), have a horizontally rotating cylindrical reel composed of helical blades, each of which in turn runs past a horizontal cutter-bar, producing a continuous scissor action. The bar is held at an adjustable level just above the ground and the reel runs at a speed dependent on the forward movement speed of the machine, driven by wheels running on the ground (or in self-powered applications by a motor). The cut grass may be gathered in a collection bin.

This type of mower is used to produce consistently short and even grass on bowling greens, lawns, parks and sports grounds. When pulled by a tractor (or formerly by a horse), these mowers are often ganged into sets of three, five or more, to form a &quot;gang mower&quot;. A well-designed reel mower can cut quite tangled and thick tall grass, but this type works best on fairly short, upright vegetation, as taller vegetation tends to be rolled flat rather than cut.

Home reel mowers have certain benefits over motor-powered mowers as they are quieter and not dependent on any extra form of power besides the person doing the mowing. This is useful not only to lessen dependence on other types of power which may have availability issues, but also lessens the impact on the environment.

=== Flail mower ===

Flail mowers have a number of small blades on the end of chains attached to a horizontal axis. The cutting is carried out by the ax-like heads striking the grass at speed. These types are used on rough ground, where the blades may frequently be fouled by other objects, or on tougher vegetation than grass, such as brush (scrub). Due to the length of the chains and the higher weight of the blades, they are better at cutting thick brush than other mowers, because of the relatively high inertia of the blades. In some types the cut material may be gathered in a collection bin. As a boom mower (see above), a flail mower may be used in an upright position for trimming the sides of hedges, when it is often called a &quot;hedge-cutter&quot;.

=== Drum mower ===

Drum mowers are known for their simplicity and robustness. They consist of two large drums, each containing three to four spinning blades that chop down the grass or crop as they move over it. This straightforward design makes them easier to maintain, often leading to a longer lifespan.

Drum mowers are particularly effective in tall and dense grass, where their powerful cutting action can make quick work of the task. However, they may struggle on uneven terrain, and their cutting speed may be slower compared to more modern designs. Their affordability and sturdy build make them an attractive option for smaller farms or those working on a budget.

<doc id="567733" wikidata="Q180899" url="?curid=567733" title="Al Dubin">
<text>Alexander Dubin (June 10, 1891 – February 11, 1945) was an American lyricist. He is best known for his collaborations with the composer Harry Warren.

==Life==
Al Dubin came from a Russian Jewish family that immigrated to the United States from Switzerland when he was two years old. Born in Zürich, Switzerland, he grew up in Philadelphia. Between ages of thirteen and sixteen, Dubin played hookey from school in order to travel into New York City to see Broadway musical shows. At age 14 he began writing special material for a vaudeville entertainer on 28th Street between 5th and Broadway in New York City, otherwise known as Tin Pan Alley.

Dubin was accepted and enrolled at Perkiomen Seminary in September 1909, but was expelled in 1911, after writing their Alma Mater. After leaving Perkiomen, Dubin got himself a job as a singing waiter at a Philadelphia restaurant. He continued to write lyrics and tried selling them to area publishing firms. During this time, Dubin met composer Joe Burke. Together they wrote the song &quot;Oh, You, Mister Moon&quot; (1911), which was published by M. Witmark &amp; Sons. The team also composed the Villanova University Anthem (Alma Mater).

In 1917, Dubin was drafted at Camp Upton in Yaphank, New York, and served as a private in the 305th Field Artillery of the 77th Division, known as New York&#x27;s own. During his service, he wrote the song &quot;They Didn’t Think We&#x27;d Do it, But We Did&quot; with composer Fred Rath and published by the 77th Division. On his first weekend pass, Dubin went to see a show at the Majestic Theater in New York City. There he met Broadway singer Helen McClay. They were married on March 19, 1921, at the Church of St. Elizabeth in New York City, after Dubin converted to the Catholic faith and McClay was granted an annulment of her first marriage. The year they married, Dubin was accepted in ASCAP in 1921.

Known for his larger-than-life persona, Dubin struggled with alcohol and drugs, and fell on hard times in the 1940s. Estranged from his wife, Dubin struggled to find work both in Hollywood and New York. The last show Dubin was contracted to work on was &quot;Laffing Room Only&quot;, with composer Burton Lane. Dubin provided only a title for this production, &quot;Feudin&#x27; and a Fightin&#x27;&quot;, for which he received 25 percent credit.

Dubin spent the remainder of the last few years of his life at the Empire Hotel, alone and in ill-health. On February 8, 1945, he collapsed on the street after having taken a large quantity of doctor-prescribed barbiturates. He was admitted to the Roosevelt Hospital for barbiturate poisoning and pneumonia, and later died on February 11, 1945. Newspaper personality Walter Winchell made the announcement of his death on the radio.

Dubin was interred in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

==Career==
Dubin sold his first set of lyrics for two songs &quot;Prairie Rose&quot; and &quot;Sunray&quot;, in 1909 to the Witmark Music Publishing Firm.

In 1925, Dubin met the composer Harry Warren, who was to become his future collaborator at Warner Bros. studio in Hollywood. The first song they collaborated on was titled, &quot;Too Many Kisses in the Summer Bring Too Many Tears in the Fall&quot;. But it was another song written with Joseph Meyer that same year that became Dubin&#x27;s first big hit, &quot;A Cup of Coffee, a Sandwich and You&quot;.

Warner Bros. purchased the publishing firms of Witmark, Remick and Harms, and since Dubin was under contract to Harms, Warner Bros. inherited his services. In 1929, Dubin wrote &quot;Tiptoe through the Tulips&quot; with composer Joe Burke, for the film &quot;Gold Diggers of Broadway&quot;.

In 1932, Dubin teamed officially with composer Harry Warren on the movie musical &quot;42nd Street&quot;, starring Ruby Keeler, Dick Powell, Warner Baxter and Bebe Daniels, with dance routines sequenced by Busby Berkeley. The songwriting team of Warren and Dubin contributed four songs: &quot;42nd Street&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Getting to Be a Habit with Me&quot;, &quot;Young and Healthy&quot; and &quot;Shuffle Off to Buffalo&quot;.

Between 1932 and 1939, Dubin and Warren wrote 60 hit songs for several Warner Bros. movie musicals, including &quot;Gold Diggers of 1933&quot;, &quot;Footlight Parade&quot; starring James Cagney, &quot;Roman Scandals&quot; starring Eddie Cantor, &quot;Dames&quot;, &quot;Go Into Your Dance&quot; and &quot;Wonder Bar&quot;, both starring Al Jolson. The song &quot;Lullaby of Broadway&quot;, written by Warren and Dubin for the musical film, &quot;Gold Diggers of 1935&quot;, won the 1936 Academy Award for Best Original Song.

==Legacy==
In 1980, producer David Merrick and director Gower Champion adapted the 1933 film &quot;42nd Street&quot; into a Broadway musical that won The Tony Award for Best Musical in 1981. The book for the show was written by Michael Stewart and Mark Bramble and featured a score that incorporated Warren and Dubin songs from various movie musicals including &quot;42nd Street&quot;, &quot;Dames&quot;, &quot;Go Into Your Dance&quot;, &quot;Gold Diggers of 1933&quot; and &quot;Gold Diggers of 1935&quot;.

Dubin was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.

<doc id="567736" wikidata="Q1770472" url="?curid=567736" title="Julie Nixon Eisenhower">
<text>Julie Nixon Eisenhower (born July 5, 1948) is an American author who is the younger daughter of former U.S. president Richard Nixon and his wife, Pat Nixon. Her husband, David, is the grandson of former U.S. president Dwight D. Eisenhower and his wife, Mamie Eisenhower.

Born in Washington, D.C. in 1948, while her father was a Congressman, Julie and her older sister, Tricia Nixon Cox, grew up in the public eye. Her father was elected U.S. Senator from California when she was two and Vice President of the United States when she was four. Her 1968 marriage to David Eisenhower was seen as a union between two of the most prominent political families in the United States.

Throughout the Nixon administration (1969 to 1974), Julie worked as the assistant managing editor of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; while holding the unofficial title of &quot;First Daughter&quot;. She was widely noted as one of her father&#x27;s most vocal and active defenders and was named one of the &quot;Ten Most Admired Women in America&quot; for four years of the 1970s by readers of &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; magazine. After her father resigned from the presidency in 1974, she wrote a biography of her mother, the &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller &quot;Pat Nixon: The Untold Story&quot;. She continues to engage in works that support her parents&#x27; legacies and is on the board of directors of the Richard Nixon Foundation.

She is the mother of two daughters, Jennie Eisenhower and Melanie Catherine Eisenhower, and a son, Alex Eisenhower.

==Early life and education==

Julie Nixon was born at Columbia Hospital for Women in Washington, D.C., while her father, Richard Nixon, was a Representative, but much of her childhood coincided with her father&#x27;s term as Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s vice-president (1953–1961). She recalled her father as being romantic, while her mother was &quot;practical and down to earth&quot;. Her mother tried to &quot;seal&quot; her and her sister from much of her father&#x27;s political career. At his second inauguration, President Eisenhower suggested to eight-year-old Julie as their photograph was being taken, to hide a black eye (which she had acquired in a sledding accident) by turning her head. She turned her head towards David, which made it appear that he had been staring directly at her. Her grandmother Hannah Nixon would come to watch her and her sister whenever her parents traveled. As a child, one of her favorite pets was a cocker spaniel named Checkers, who figured prominently in one of her father&#x27;s most famous speeches, given during his 1952 campaign for Vice President of the United States.

While her father was vice president, she attended the private Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C., along with her sister Tricia. After her father lost the presidential election of 1960 to John F. Kennedy, Julie felt &quot;battered&quot; by the results and felt that the votes had &quot;been stolen&quot;.

After her father lost his presidential bid in 1960 the family returned to California, where her father ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1962. The Nixons moved to New York City after the gubernatorial race, and Julie attended Smith College after her graduation from the Chapin School. She received a master&#x27;s degree in education from Catholic University of America in 1971. When she was at Smith, David Eisenhower, the grandson of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, attended Amherst College nearby. Julie and David were both invited to address the Hadley Republican Women&#x27;s Club. The club learned that the two were only seven miles apart, and invited them to be featured speakers. They discussed the invitations and both chose to decline, but would come in contact again when David visited Julie with his roommate from Amherst and took her and a friend out for ice cream. David reflected: &quot;I was broke, my roommate forgot his wallet. The girls paid.&quot;

==Marriage==
She began to date David Eisenhower in the fall of 1966 when they were freshmen at Smith College and Amherst College, respectively. They became engaged a year later. Both Julie and David have said that Mamie Eisenhower played a major part in their relationship. In 1966 during the funeral for Raymond Pitcairn, a friend of the Nixons, Julie mentioned to Mamie that she would be attending Smith College. Mamie told her of David&#x27;s plans to go to Amherst College, and soon started trying to get David to call on her.

In 1966, Julie Nixon was presented as a debutante to high society at the International Debutante Ball at Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City. David Eisenhower was her civilian escort at the International Debutante Ball.

Julie and David married on December 22, 1968, after her father was elected president in the 1968 presidential election, but before he took office. The couple decided they did not want the publicity of a White House wedding. The Reverend Norman Vincent Peale officiated in the non-denominational rite at the Marble Collegiate Church in New York City.

The couple left Massachusetts in 1970 when their classes there were canceled after the Kent State shootings. After her father resigned from office, the two lived in California near Julie&#x27;s parents and later in the suburbs of Philadelphia. The Eisenhowers have three children: actress Jennie Elizabeth (born August 15, 1978), Alexander Richard (b. 1980), and Melanie Catherine Eisenhower (b. 1984), a Child Life Specialist in the oncology department at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

==First daughter==
During the United States presidential election of 1968, when her father was the Republican nominee, Julie began to feel that she was not active enough in her father&#x27;s campaign and worried over what she believed was Hubert Humphrey&#x27;s popularity at Smith College, which she was attending at the time. She took an active role in his campaign, and shook hands for hours while greeting people. Despite not liking the publicity and hating to answer &quot;personal questions&quot;, she did anything she could to help her father.

While her father served as President (1969–1974), Julie became active at the White House as a spokesperson for children&#x27;s issues, the environment, and the elderly. She gave tours to disabled children, filled in for her mother at events, and took an active interest in foreign policy. She and Tricia were placed in charge of Caroline Kennedy and John F. Kennedy, Jr., when they visited the White House in 1971. The sisters took the young Kennedys on a tour of their former residence, which included going to their old bedrooms and to the Oval Office.

In 1971, when David was assigned to the Mayport, Florida-based , they moved to the Jacksonville beach community of Atlantic Beach, Florida. She had been hired to teach third grade at Atlantic Beach Elementary School beginning that fall, but she had to quit when she broke her toe just before classes were to start. The Eisenhowers continued to live in Atlantic Beach until 1973, even hosting the President and the First Lady at their beachfront garage apartment on Beach Avenue.

From 1973 to 1975, she served as Assistant Managing Editor of the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; and helped establish a book division for Curtis Publishing Co., its parent corporation. It was during this time that Julie wrote the book &quot;Eye On Nixon&quot;, full of photographs of her father&#x27;s first administration.

After the news of the Watergate break-in and suspicions that it might reach as high as the Oval Office began to mount, Julie took on the press at home and abroad. Journalist Nora Ephron wrote, &quot;In the months since the Watergate hearings began, she [Julie] has become her father&#x27;s... First Lady in practice if not in fact.&quot;

Taking on the &quot;role of trying to explain her father to the world&quot;, Julie&#x27;s public defense of her father began at Walt Disney World on May 2, 1973. She gave a total of 138 interviews across the country. On July 4, 1973, she told two reporters that her father had considered resigning over Watergate, but that the family had talked him out of it. On May 7, 1974, Julie and David met with the press in the East Garden of the White House. She announced that the President planned &quot;... to take this constitutionally down to the wire.&quot; Just before noon on August 9, 1974, Julie stood behind her father while he gave his goodbye speech to the White House staff. She later said it was the hardest moment for him.

==Life after the White House==
Julie and David settled in Berwyn, Pennsylvania, where she wrote several books, including &quot;Pat Nixon: The Untold Story&quot; and &quot;Going Home to Glory; A Memoir of Life with Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot;, written with her husband David Eisenhower. She has an extensive record of community service and a special interest in at-risk youth. For over twenty years she served on the board of directors for Jobs for America&#x27;s Graduates, a national organization that helps young people graduate from high school and transition into a first job. She was named a Distinguished Daughter of Pennsylvania for her civic contributions. She is active with the Richard Nixon Foundation, sitting on its board. From 2002 to 2006 she was Chair of the President&#x27;s Commission on White House Fellowships, a program fostering leadership in the nation&#x27;s most exceptional young adults.

Along with her sister and father, she was with her mother when she died of lung cancer on June 22, 1993. Four days later on June 26, 1993, she attended her mother&#x27;s funeral service on the grounds of the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda, California. Ten months later, she was by her father&#x27;s bedside with her sister when he died. Julie attended the funeral on April 27, 1994. Her father&#x27;s death left her and her sister with his diary entries, binders and tapes among other things.

She has expressed distaste in a few adaptations of presidencies, and labeled them as giving young viewers a &quot;twisted sense of history&quot;. This extended to Oliver Stone&#x27;s film &quot;Nixon&quot;, an adaptation of her father&#x27;s presidency. Walt Disney&#x27;s daughter, Diane Disney Miller, wrote a letter to Julie and her sister saying that Stone had &quot;committed a grave disservice to your family, to the Presidency, and to American history&quot;.

On April 14, 1999, the U.S. Department of Defense moved to prevent her from making an appearance to testify during a legal battle over whether the federal government would pay her father&#x27;s estate millions designated for the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in compensation for papers and tapes seized when he resigned.

In 2001, she expressed interest in exhuming the body of Checkers, a dog attributed to her father&#x27;s career when he campaigned for vice president that died in 1964. Her desire was to move the remains to the Nixon Presidential Library and Museum.

She and her sister got into a legal battle over an estimated &quot;as-high-as&quot; $19 million, left by Bebe Rebozo for the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace Foundation. As opposed to Tricia&#x27;s wish for the money to be controlled by a group affiliated with their family, Julie wanted it to be controlled by the library&#x27;s board. On the relationship strain the two were experiencing during the dispute, Julie said &quot;I think it is very sad&quot; and stated, &quot;It&#x27;s very heartbreaking because I love my sister very much&quot;. Ultimately, the lawsuit was settled to the satisfaction of both sides.

One of Eisenhower&#x27;s fondest wishes was for the Nixon Library to join the National Archives-administered system of Presidential Libraries:

It&#x27;s not right, struggling for the money. My father should be in the system. As long as he&#x27;s on the outside, historians will continue to look at him, I feel, in a more negative light. There is always going to be negativity, but he has to be part of the continuum of presidents.

Due in large part to Julie Eisenhower&#x27;s advocacy, the Nixon Library became part of the National Archives and Records Administration system in July 2007.

In spite of her family&#x27;s history of supporting Republicans, Julie donated $2,300 to Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary race against Hillary Clinton. She supported Mitt Romney in 2012, the Republican nominee against President Obama, and Donald Trump in 2016, 2020 and 2024.

On March 16, 2012, she and her sister arrived in Yorba Linda, California, to celebrate what would have been their mother&#x27;s 100th birthday. On November 23, 2013, Eisenhower and her husband opened a holiday exhibit for the Nixon Library, which remained there until January 5, 2014.

<doc id="567737" wikidata="Q7966315" url="?curid=567737" title="Walter Tull">
<text>Walter Daniel John Tull (28 April 1888 – 25 March 1918) was an English professional footballer and British Army officer of Afro-Caribbean descent. He played as an inside forward and half back for Clapton, Tottenham Hotspur and Northampton Town and was the third person of mixed heritage to play in the top division of the Football League after Arthur Wharton and Willie Clarke. He was also the first player of African descent to sign for Rangers in 1917, while stationed in Scotland.

During the First World War, Tull served in the Middlesex Regiment, including in the two Footballers&#x27; Battalions. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 30 May 1917 and killed in action on 25 March 1918.

==Early life==
Walter Daniel John Tull was born in Folkestone, Kent, the son of Barbadian carpenter Daniel Tull and Kent-born Alice Elizabeth Palmer. His paternal grandfather was a slave in Barbados. His maternal English grandmother was from Kent. He began his education at North Board School, now Mundella Primary School, Folkestone.

In 1895, when Tull was seven, his mother died of cancer. A year later, his father married Alice&#x27;s cousin, Clara Palmer. She gave birth to a daughter, Miriam, on 11 September 1897. Three months later, Daniel died from heart disease. The stepmother was unable to cope with five children, so the resident minister of Folkestone&#x27;s Grace Hill Wesleyan Chapel recommended that the two boys of school age, Walter and Edward, should be sent to an orphanage. From the age of nine, Tull was brought up in the Methodist Children&#x27;s Home and Orphanage (now known as Action for Children) in Bethnal Green, London. Edward was adopted by the Warnock family of Glasgow, becoming Edward Tull-Warnock; he qualified as a dentist, the first mixed-heritage person to practise this profession in the United Kingdom.

==Career==
Tull&#x27;s professional football career began after he was spotted playing for top amateur club Clapton. He had signed for Clapton in October 1908, reportedly never playing in a losing side. By the end of the season he had won winners&#x27; medals in the FA Amateur Cup, London County Amateur Cup and the London Senior Cup. In March 1909, the &quot;Football Star&quot; called him &quot;the catch of the season&quot;. At Clapton, he played alongside Clyde Purnell and Charlie Rance.

At the age of 21, Tull signed for Football League First Division team Tottenham Hotspur in the summer of 1909 after a close-season tour of Argentina and Uruguay, making him the first mixed-heritage professional footballer to play in Latin America. Tull made his debut for Tottenham in September 1909 in the position of inside forward against Sunderland and his home Football League debut against FA Cup-holders, Manchester United, in front of more than 30,000. His excellent form in this opening part of the season promised a great future. Tull made only 10 first-team appearances, scoring twice, before he was dropped to the reserves. This may have been due to the racial abuse he received from opposing fans, particularly at Bristol City, whose supporters used language &quot;lower than Billingsgate&quot;, according to a report at the time in the &quot;Football Star&quot; newspaper. The match report of the game away to Bristol City in October 1909 by &quot;Football Star&quot; reporter, &quot;DD&quot;, was headlined &quot;Football and the Colour Prejudice&quot;, possibly the first time racial abuse was headlined in a football report. &quot;DD&quot; emphasised how Tull remained professional and composed despite the intense provocation: &quot;He is Hotspur&#x27;s most brainy forward ... so clean in mind and method as to be a model for all white men who play football ... Tull was the best forward on the field.&quot; However, soon after, Tull was dropped from the first team and found it difficult to get a sustained run back in the side. Goodwin writes in &quot;The Spurs Alphabet&quot; that &quot;whilst a skilful player, he was not considered fast enough for top class football.&quot;

Further appearances in the first team (20 in total with four goals) were recorded, before Tull&#x27;s contract was bought by Southern Football League club Northampton Town on 17 October 1911 for a &quot;substantial fee&quot;, plus Charlie Brittain joining Tottenham Hotspur in return. Tull made his debut four days later against Watford, and made 111 first-team appearances (105 in the League), scoring nine goals for the club. The day before the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; sank on 15 April 1912, Tull scored four goals in a match against Bristol Rovers. The manager Herbert Chapman, also a Methodist, was a former Spurs player and had played as a young man with Arthur Wharton at Stalybridge Rovers; Chapman went on to manage both Huddersfield Town and Arsenal to FA Cup wins and League championships.

In 1940, an article in the &quot;Glasgow Evening Times&quot; about Tull being the first &quot;coloured&quot; infantry officer in the British Army reported that he had signed to play for Rangers after the war. Rangers have confirmed that Tull signed for them in February 1917, while he was an officer cadet in Scotland at Gailes, Ayrshire.

==First World War==

After the First World War broke out in August 1914, Tull became the first Northampton Town player to enlist in the British Army, in December of that year. Tull served in the two Football Battalions of the Duke of Cambridge&#x27;s Own (Middlesex) Regiment, the 17th and 23rd, and also in the 5th Battalion. He rose to the rank of lance sergeant and fought in the Battle of the Somme in 1916.

When Tull was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 30 May 1917, he became one of the first mixed-heritage infantry officers in a regular British Army regiment, when the 1914 Manual of Military Law excluded soldiers that were not &quot;natural born or naturalised British subjects of pure European descent&quot; from becoming commissioned officers in the Special Reserve.

With the 23rd Battalion, Tull fought on the Italian Front from 30 November 1917 to early March 1918. He was praised for his &quot;gallantry and coolness&quot; by Major-General Sydney Lawford, General Officer Commanding 41st Division, having led 26 men on a night-raiding party, crossing the fast-flowing rapids of the Piave River into enemy territory and returning them unharmed.

Tull and the 23rd Battalion returned to northern France on 8 March 1918. He was killed in action near the village of Favreuil in the Pas-de-Calais on 25 March during the First Battle of Bapaume, the early stages of the German Army&#x27;s Spring Offensive. His body was never recovered, despite the efforts of, among others, Private Tom Billingham, a former goalkeeper for Leicester Fosse, to return him to the British position while under fire. He is believed to be buried somewhere in the Somme, but historian Andy Robertshaw has indicated he may be buried in an unmarked grave at Heninel-Croisilles Road cemetery.

In a letter of condolence to his family, the commanding officer of the 23rd Battalion, Major Poole and his colleague 2Lt Pickard both said that Tull had been put forward for a Military Cross. Pickard wrote &quot;he had been recommended for the Military Cross, and certainly earned it.&quot; However, the Ministry of Defence has no record of any recommendation but many records were lost in a 1940 fire.

==Legacy==
In the history of mixed-heritage footballers in Britain, Tull may be mentioned alongside: Robert Walker of Third Lanark; Andrew Watson, an amateur who is credited as the earliest black international football player, winning his first cap for Scotland in 1881; Arthur Wharton, a goalkeeper for several clubs, including Darlington, and who became the first mixed-heritage professional in 1889; John Walker of Hearts and Lincoln, who died aged 22; the Anglo-Indian Cother brothers, Edwin and John, who began their careers at Watford in 1898, and Willie Clarke, who played for Aston Villa and Bradford City in the Edwardian era.

From around 2006, campaigners including the then Northampton South MP, Brian Binley, and Phil Vasili, who has researched Tull since the early 1990s, called for a statue to be erected in his honour at Dover and for him to be posthumously awarded the Military Cross. However, as the Military Cross was not authorised to be awarded posthumously until 1979, and the change did not include any provision for retrospective awards, this would not be possible without a change in the rules. The campaigners felt this would be justified given that the army broke the rules. Tull&#x27;s commission, at a time when the army was desperately short of officers was also due to his natural leadership, coolness and respect of his unit&#x27;s officers and men. If he had been recommended for a Military Cross, his status as an officer of non-European descent might have meant to award him the honour would validate his status, leading to more mixed-heritage officers being commissioned. A Royal Army Medical Corps officer Allan Noel Minns, also a natural-born British subject of Afro-Caribbean descent, was awarded both DSO and MC.

===Memorials===
Tull is commemorated on Bay 7 of the Arras Memorial, which commemorates 34,785 soldiers with no known grave who died in the Arras sector.

His name was added to his parents&#x27; gravestone in Cheriton Road Cemetery, Folkestone. His older brother William, of the Royal Engineers, died in 1920, aged 37, and is buried in the cemetery with a Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) headstone, so his death was recognised as a result of his war service.

Tull&#x27;s name is listed in the Roll of Honour for the City of Glasgow, his address given as 419 St. Vincent Street, the location of the dental surgery belonging to his brother Edward.

Tull&#x27;s name appeared on the war memorial at North Board School, Folkestone, unveiled on 29 April 1921. He is named on the Folkestone War Memorial, at the top of the Road of Remembrance in Folkestone, and in Dover his name is on the town war memorial outside Maison Dieu House, and on the parish memorial at River.

On 11 July 1999, Northampton Town F.C. unveiled a memorial wall to Tull in a garden of remembrance at Sixfields Stadium. The text, written by Tull&#x27;s biographer, Phil Vasili, reads:

Through his actions, W. D. J. Tull ridiculed the barriers of ignorance that tried to deny people of colour equality with their contemporaries. His life stands testament to a determination to confront those people and those obstacles that sought to diminish him and the world in which he lived. It reveals a man, though rendered breathless in his prime, whose strong heart still beats loudly. A road behind the North Stand (The Dave Bowen Stand) at Sixfields Stadium is named Walter Tull Way, and a public house adjacent to the stadium bears his name.

In 2010, a planning application to erect a bronze memorial statue of Tull in Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park close to the Imperial War Museum in London, was refused by Southwark London Borough Council.

The Royal Mint included a £5 coin honouring Tull in the introductory First World War six-coin set, released in 2014.

On 21 October 2014, a blue plaque was unveiled at 77 Northumberland Park, London N17, on the site of the house where Tull lived before the war, close to the White Hart Lane ground. The plaque was provided by the Nubian Jak Community Trust and was unveiled by former Spurs striker Garth Crooks, who described Tull as an &quot;amazing man&quot; whose recognition had been &quot;a long time coming&quot;.

On 4 July 2017, five statues including one of Tull were unveiled in the courtyard of Northampton Guildhall. The bronze installations were commissioned by Northampton Borough Council from sculptor Richard Austin.

On 25 March 2018, to commemorate the centenary of Tull&#x27;s death, Rushden &amp; District History Society unveiled a blue plaque at 26 Queen Street, Rushden, where he lodged while playing at Northampton Town.

In September 2018, to mark the centenary of the end of the First World War, Royal Mail produced a set of stamps, one of which features Tull.

On Remembrance Sunday 2018, the people of Ayr, Scotland, came together to etch a large sand portrait of Tull into the town&#x27;s beach as part of &quot;Pages of the Sea&quot;, a nationwide public art project curated by Oscar-winning filmmaker Danny Boyle.

In October 2020, as part of Black History Month, the Royal Mail painted a postbox black in Glasgow to honour Tull.

On 21 October 2021, Tull was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame of the National Football Museum.

In October 2022, Nick Marr launched a campaign on Change.org to honour Tull, advocating for Tull to be posthumously awarded the Military Cross and proposing the erection of a statue in Central London. The campaign highlights the historical and symbolic importance of formally acknowledging Tull&#x27;s contributions, both as a soldier and as a trailblazer for racial equality. It also underscores the potential value of a statue in London to commemorate his legacy, serving as a reminder of his achievements and an inspiration to future generations.

In late 2024, a musical about Tull&#x27;s life, written by Dougie Blaxland with music by Chris Anthony, toured the UK.

==== Walter Tull Trophy ====
In July 2004, to honour the memory of Tull Tottenham Hotspur and Rangers contested in a summer friendly tournament dubbed the &quot;Walter Tull Trophy&quot;. Rangers won the Cup, defeating Spurs 2–0 with goals from Dado Pršo and Nacho Novo. The two clubs arranged and contested again in July 2022. This time Tottenham Hotspur beat Rangers 2–1 at Ibrox.

==Media and television==
In 2005 Michaela Morgan wrote &quot;Respect!&quot;, an account of Tull&#x27;s life, specifically written for young people and was published by Barrington Stoke. The book was shortlisted in the Birmingham Libraries young readers&#x27; book festival May 2008.

Then in May 2008 two films were launched focusing on teaching about Tull which was made for Teachers TV. Also in 2008 the BBC created &quot;Walter&#x27;s War&quot;, a drama about the life of Tull, starring O. T. Fagbenle and written by Kwame Kwei-Armah, that was first screened on 9 November 2008 as part of the BBC&#x27;s Ninety Years of Remembrance season. The drama was aired alongside &quot;Forgotten Hero&quot;, a documentary about Tull.

In 2016, Off The Records made an animated film about Tull&#x27;s life, &quot;Walter Tull: Britain&#x27;s First Black Officer&quot;, which was voiced by actor Liam Gerrard. The film was nominated for a children&#x27;s BAFTA.

<doc id="567743" wikidata="Q4162532" url="?curid=567743" title="Riemann–Liouville integral">
<text>In mathematics, the Riemann–Liouville integral associates with a real function formula_1 another function of the same kind for each value of the parameter . The integral is a manner of generalization of the repeated antiderivative of in the sense that for positive integer values of , is an iterated antiderivative of of order . The Riemann–Liouville integral is named for Bernhard Riemann and Joseph Liouville, the latter of whom was the first to consider the possibility of fractional calculus in 1832. The operator agrees with the [[Euler transform]], after Leonhard Euler, when applied to analytic functions. It was generalized to arbitrary dimensions by Marcel Riesz, who introduced the Riesz potential.

==Motivation==
The Riemann-Liouville integral is motivated from Cauchy formula for repeated integration. For a function continuous on the interval [,], the Cauchy formula for -fold repeated integration states that 

formula_2

Now, this formula can be generalized to any positive real number by replacing positive integer with , Therefore we obtain the definition of Riemann-Liouville fractional Integral by 
:formula_3

==Definition==
The Riemann–Liouville integral is defined by

:formula_4

where is the gamma function and is an arbitrary but fixed base point. The integral is well-defined provided is a locally integrable function, and is a complex number in the half-plane . The dependence on the base-point is often suppressed, and represents a freedom in constant of integration. Clearly is an antiderivative of (of first order), and for positive integer values of , is an antiderivative of order by Cauchy formula for repeated integration. Another notation, which emphasizes the base point, is

:formula_5

This also makes sense if , with suitable restrictions on .

The fundamental relations hold

:formula_6

the latter of which is a semigroup property. These properties make possible not only the definition of fractional integration, but also of fractional differentiation, by taking enough derivatives of .

==Properties==
Fix a bounded interval . The operator associates to each integrable function on the function on which is also integrable by Fubini&#x27;s theorem. Thus defines a linear operator on :

:formula_7

Fubini&#x27;s theorem also shows that this operator is continuous with respect to the Banach space structure on 1, and that the following inequality holds:

:formula_8

Here denotes the norm on .

More generally, by Hölder&#x27;s inequality, it follows that if , then as well, and the analogous inequality holds

:formula_9

where is the norm on the interval . Thus we have a bounded linear operator . Furthermore, in the sense as along the real axis. That is

:formula_10

for all . Moreover, by estimating the maximal function of , one can show that the limit holds pointwise almost everywhere.

The operator is well-defined on the set of locally integrable function on the whole real line formula_11. It defines a bounded transformation on any of the Banach spaces of functions of exponential type formula_12 consisting of locally integrable functions for which the norm

:formula_13

is finite. For , the Laplace transform of takes the particularly simple form

:formula_14

for . Here denotes the Laplace transform of , and this property expresses that is a Fourier multiplier.

==Fractional derivatives==
One can define fractional-order derivatives of as well by

:formula_15

where denotes the ceiling function. One also obtains a differintegral interpolating between differentiation and integration by defining

:formula_16

An alternative fractional derivative was introduced by Caputo in 1967, and produces a derivative that has different properties: it produces zero from constant functions and, more importantly, the initial value terms of the Laplace Transform are expressed by means of the values of that function and of its derivative of integer order rather than the derivatives of fractional order as in the Riemann–Liouville derivative. The Caputo fractional derivative with base point , is then:

:formula_17

Another representation is:

:formula_18

==Fractional derivative of a basic power function==


Let us assume that is a monomial of the form
:formula_19

The first derivative is as usual
:formula_20

Repeating this gives the more general result that
:formula_21
which, after replacing the factorials with the gamma function, leads to
:formula_22

For and , we obtain the half-derivative of the function formula_23 as
:formula_24

To demonstrate that this is, in fact, the &quot;half derivative&quot; (where ), we repeat the process to get:
:formula_25

(because formula_26 and ) which is indeed the expected result of
:formula_27

For negative integer power , 1/formula_28 is 0, so it is convenient to use the following relation:
:formula_29

This extension of the above differential operator need not be constrained only to real powers; it also applies for complex powers. For example, the -th derivative of the -th derivative yields the second derivative. Also setting negative values for yields integrals.

For a general function and , the complete fractional derivative is
:formula_30

For arbitrary , since the gamma function is infinite for negative (real) integers, it is necessary to apply the fractional derivative after the integer derivative has been performed. For example,
:formula_31

==Laplace transform==

We can also come at the question via the Laplace transform. Knowing that
:formula_32

and
:formula_33

and so on, we assert
:formula_34.

For example,
:formula_35

as expected. Indeed, given the convolution rule
:formula_36

and shorthanding for clarity, we find that
:formula_37

which is what Cauchy gave us above.

Laplace transforms &quot;work&quot; on relatively few functions, but they &quot;are&quot; often useful for solving fractional differential equations.

<text>Giles John Harry Goschen, 4th Viscount Goschen (born 16 November 1965), is a British Conservative politician.

Goschen is the son of John Goschen, 3rd Viscount Goschen, by his second wife Alvin England. He was educated at Heatherdown School, near Ascot in Berkshire, and Eton. He succeeded his father in the viscountcy in 1977 at the age of eleven. After a brief stint as a city stockbroker he spent time in Zambia with his future wife Sarah Horsnail to work for a conservation agency, but returned to Britain.

Goschen served under John Major as a Lord-in-waiting from 1992 to 1994 and as Under Secretary of State for Transport from 1994 to 1997. In 1999 he was among the Conservative hereditary peers elected to remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, the youngest chosen by any party group.

In 2010, he lived in Sussex with his wife and three children.

<text>Craig&#x27;s Brother is an American punk rock band. They have released three albums internationally, two on Tooth &amp; Nail Records and one self-released.

==History==
===Foundation and &quot;Homecoming&quot; (1995-2001)===
In 1995, singer and guitar player for General Handywork Ted Bond got together with Andy Snyder, Scott Hrapoff, and Heath Konkel to pursue a sound that was inspired by Lagwagon and other bands on Fat Wreck Chords. The band name originated from people referring to Scott as &quot;Craig&#x27;s brother&quot; because of Scott&#x27;s brother Craig&#x27;s popularity in high school.

After Adam Nigh joined the group in 1997, Craig&#x27;s Brother signed a contract with the independent label Tooth &amp; Nail Records, and in 1998 the band released their first album, &quot;Homecoming&quot;. The album was recorded at Westbeach Studios in Hollywood, and produced by Donnell Cameron. 
After spending the summer of 1998 touring to promote &quot;Homecoming&quot;, Andy and Adam left Craig&#x27;s Brother to form the band Too Bad Eugene. In December of that year, guitarist Ryan Key traveled from Florida to California to audition for the band. Ryan later memorialized his experiences auditioning for Craig&#x27;s Brother in the song “Rock Star Land&quot; by Yellowcard. Ryan was joined shortly thereafter by Dan McClintock from Inspection 12. At one point, the two of them represented Craig&#x27;s Brother at the Cornerstone Festival as an acoustic duo. After touring vigorously the majority of 1999, the band found themselves without a van or money to buy one in August. When the band decided to go home and regroup, Ryan decided to go back to Jacksonville where he got a job with Sean Mackin and eventually joined Yellowcard. The band returned home and started to work on their second album, &quot;Lost at Sea&quot;. After recording finished in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in January, Dan McLintock also opted to return home to Jacksonville, rejoining his old band Inspection 12. In fall of that year, Heath also announced that he was quitting. The band continued to play shows, experimenting with a number of drummers and guitar players, including Garrett Baldwin, Justin (Juice) Cabrera and Steven Neufeld.

During this time the band experienced a sudden upsurge of fans with the advent of Napster when an unknown fan uploaded an mp3 of the song &quot;Who Am I?&quot; from the first album with the artist name &quot;Craig&#x27;s Brother (NOFX &amp; Lagwagon)&quot;. The band openly gave their support to file sharing, arguing that sales would ultimately benefit from the free publicity, although reminding the fans that their label was against it.

Craig&#x27;s Brother has had a tenuous relationship with the Christian music industry since its inception. Although the band originally accepted the label &quot;Christian Band&quot; they quickly realized that it did not necessarily describe what they were attempting to do. Early on the band tried make it clear that in spite of the Christian beliefs of some of the band members, the band was not necessarily a &quot;Christian Punk Band&quot;, that in fact they were just punks who happened to be Christian. Their early willingness to play Christian venues, sing about religious issues, and their relationship with Tooth and Nail records however has made &quot;Christian Band&quot; a label that Craig&#x27;s Brother has never been able completely get away from. Both of Craig&#x27;s Brother&#x27;s Tooth and Nail releases were initially banned from Family Book Stores and picked up later due to the demand from customers.

The band&#x27;s perspectives on the Christian Music industry, and Napster led to strained a relationship with their label and in fall of 2000, Craig&#x27;s Brother was released from their contract by Tooth &amp; Nail Records. Tooth &amp; Nail would press the album in February 2001, but did little to promote it, even neglecting to inform retailers of its existence. Record outlets would usually only stock the album at the customer&#x27;s requests, so sales were not surprisingly disappointing.

The band continued to play shows but could not keep a solid line up. Finally in March 2002 Ted announced that he was quitting.

===Reformation and &quot;The Insidious Lie&quot; (2003-present)===
The three longest-lasting members, Ted Bond, Scott Hrapoff and Heath Konkel reunited around Christmas 2003 and Craig&#x27;s Brother was reformed, with Sam Prather as their new guitarist. The following year, &quot;E.P.idemic&quot; was released on Takeover Records, a label run by former Yellowcard guitarist Ben Harper, with former guitarist Steven Neufeld playing the second guitar. Following its release, Sam left the band. Struggling to find any suiting guitarists, as Steven was often busy working with his own band, HeyMike!, lead singer and songwriter Ted himself took up the role of rhythm guitarist. He was later joined by guitarist Glade Wilson in late 2006.

On March 23, 2009, the band began recording their third album at The Compound recording studio in Felton, CA with Kyle Black acting as producer, collaborating with their former guitarist Andy Snyder, and also again incorporating the services of former members Steven Neufeld and Adam Nigh. Without a record label, they financed this record themselves, and worked on it over the next year and a half at DK2 Studios in Santa Cruz, CA with Andy and Ted producing. On December 22, 2010, the band announced the completion of the album dubbed The Insidious Lie via their Twitter feed. It was made available for streaming its entirety on Christmas Day and then released on January 24, 2011, as a digital download, and later that spring on CD, and finally Veritas Vinyl pressed an LP in the summer of 2011. Craig&#x27;s Brother followed the release The Insidious Lie with a few California shows and a European tour. In Fall 2013 Craig&#x27;s Brother released a compilation of 10 of their earliest recordings entitled &quot;The Early Years&quot;.

Craig&#x27;s Brother continued to tour &quot;The insidious Lie&quot; through 2014. Notably was their appearance on the main stage of Groezrock which NOFX headlined. Most recently Craig&#x27;s Brother performed at Montebello Rockfest 2017. Craig&#x27;s Brother began recording new music in October 2017 and in December 2017, Craig&#x27;s Brother released &quot;Meilynn&#x27;s Song&quot; for IndieVision Music&#x27;s Friend &amp; Family compilation.

In 2018, the band announced &quot;Devils In The Details&quot;, a new 5-song EP slated to be released by Indie Vision Music before the end of that year. They ended up releasing the EP in early 2019.

==Music style and influences==
The band have cited Lagwagon as one of their main sources of inspiration. Others that have been listed as inspiration for the band include Bad Religion, The Beatles and NOFX.

<text>Éamonn Ceannt (21 September 1881 – 8 May 1916), born Edward Thomas Kent, was an Irish republican, mostly known for his role in the Easter Rising of 1916.

==Background==

Ceannt was born in the little village of Ballymoe, overlooking the River Suck in County Galway. His parents were James Kent (4 July 1839 – 1895) and Joanne Galway. (They were married on 5 July 1870.) He was the sixth of seven children, the others being William, Michael, Richard, Nell, John and James. His father, James Kent was a Royal Irish Constabulary officer. Stationed in Ballymoe, in 1883 he was promoted and transferred to Drogheda, County Louth where he lived until Éamonn was eight years old. When his father retired from the force when Eamonn was twelve the family moved from Ardee to Dublin. They were a very religious Catholic family and it has been said that Ceannt&#x27;s religious teaching as a child stayed with him for the rest of his life.

Two events that evoked nationalism at the end of the 19th century were the 1798 commemoration and the Boer War in South Africa. Éamonn became interested in these events. He took part in the commemoration.

==Personal life==
In 1899, Ceannt joined the central branch of the Gaelic League. It was here where he first met many of the men who would play a major role in the rising, including Patrick Pearse and Eoin MacNeill. He became increasingly involved in Nationalist movements and had a strong interest in the Irish language. The main purposes of the league were to educate people on the Irish culture and revive the Irish language along with Irish music, dancing, poetry, literature and history. Ceannt was an extremely committed member of the league, he was an elected member of the governing body and by 1905 he was teaching Irish language classes in branch offices of the league. In February 1900 Ceannt, along with Edward Martyn founded &quot;&quot; (The Pipers Club). Ceannt&#x27;s musical talents earned him a gold medal at the 1906 Oireachtas and in 1905 he even put on a performance for Pope Pius X. It is said that the main language in the Pipers Club was Irish and played a role in reviving Irish music. It was through the Gaelic League that Ceannt first met his wife, Frances Mary O’Brennan who was known as Áine. She came from a strongly nationalist family, both of her sisters Kathleen and Lily O&#x27;Brennan were also involved in the nationalist movement. She joined the League as she shared an interest in the Irish culture and heritage. They got married in June 1905. Their son, Ronan was born in June 1906.
In 1907 Ceannt joined the Dublin central branch of Sinn Féin, and over the following years he became increasingly determined to see an Independent Ireland. In 1912 he was sworn to the Irish Republican Brotherhood by Seán Mac Diarmada. This movement was pledged to achieve Irish independence and to do so by using physical force if necessary.

===Education and career===
While living in county Louth, Ceannt attended the De La Salle national school. After 5 years of schooling in Louth, the family moved to Drogheda, where he attended the Christian Brothers school, Sunday&#x27;s Gate (Now Scholars Townhouse Hotel). They moved to Dublin in 1892 and lived in Drumcondra. Here he attended the North Richmond Street Christian Brothers School. Two other leaders from the 1916 rising, Seán Heuston and Con Colbert, were educated at that school.
Ceannt achieved excellent results in his final exams prior to leaving school. After finishing he was presented with the opportunity to work for the civil service but turned this position down as he felt he would be working for the British. He went on to secure a job with the clerical staff of the City Treasurer and Estates and Finances office; he worked as an accountant with the Dublin Corporation from 1901 to 1916.

Ceannt was involved in trade unionism, being a member of the Dublin Metropolitan Officers&#x27; Association and later serving as its chairman. He publicly supported the workers in the Wexford lock-out of 1911 (forerunner of the Dublin Lock-out of 1913), saying &quot;the right of free speech, of public meeting and of organising for a lawful purpose ought to be unquestioned and unquestionable&quot;.

==Easter Rising==
In May 1915, the IRB Military Council, consisting of Joseph Plunkett and Seán Mac Diarmada as well as Ceannt, began plans for a rebellion. Ceannt was one of the seven men to sign the Proclamation of Independence for the Irish Republic and had been appointed Director of Communications. He was made commandant of the 4th Battalion of the Volunteers, and during the Rising was stationed at the South Dublin Union, with more than 100 men under his command, notably his second-in-command Cathal Brugha, and W. T. Cosgrave. The South Dublin Union controlled a large area south of Kilmainham around Dolphin&#x27;s Barn.

As the 3rd Royal Irish came to Mount Brown, a section of Ceannt&#x27;s battalion under section commander John Joyce opened fire, killing a number of soldiers. The British could not break through to Dublin Castle, and so brought up more troops from Kilmainham Barracks. A ceasefire allowed casualty retrieval. The Volunteers drove back repeated assaults from determined regimental attacks. Ceannt used a contingent at the Marrowbone Lane Distillery to enfilade the passing soldiers; grinding attacks broke through to the Women&#x27;s Infirmary. On Tuesday 25 April, the British could have closed off the battle, but failed to press home the advantage when the 4th Royal Dublin Fusiliers arrived, and Ceannt continued to hold out with 20 times fewer men. On Thursday 27 April, a British battalion made south, as far as the Rialto Bridge, when Ceannt&#x27;s outposts opened fire.

The British were forced to tunnel into the buildings and, as Ceannt&#x27;s numbers reduced, it was increasingly involved in close-quarter fighting. His unit saw intense fighting at times during the week but surrendered when ordered to do so by his superior officer Patrick Pearse.

==Trial and death==
After the unconditional surrender of the 1916 fighters, Eamonn Ceannt along with the other survivors were brought to Richmond Barracks to be detained. On Monday 1 May, plain clothes detectives known as the &quot;G-men&quot; identified the leaders of the Rising, Ceannt being one of them. While Ceannt was being picked for trial, volunteer James Coughlan remembers him being determined to look after the welfare of &quot;the humblest of those who had served under him.&quot;

Ceannt was tried under court martial as demanded by General Maxwell. Maxwell was determined to inflict the death penalty upon Ceannt and the other leaders of the Rising. However, he faced legal issues which prevented him from doing so: the death penalty was only allowed to be used if one was found aiding the enemy, in this case Germany. Not until Maxwell obtained a letter from Patrick Pearse addressed to his mother regarding the communication with the Germans was he legally allowed to deploy the death penalty. From this point, Ceannt and his comrades began facing the prospect of a firing squad. On Tuesday 2 May, Ceannt was sent for court-martial. He was sentenced to death and transferred to Kilmainham Gaol, cell 88. He was executed on 8 May 1916, aged 34. He is buried at Arbour Hill.

In July 1926, the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; published an article that included Eamonn Ceannt&#x27;s last message, written a few hours before his execution ten years previously. In it, he said:
I leave for the guidance of other Irish Revolutionaries who may tread the path which I have trod this advice, never to treat with the enemy, never to surrender at his mercy, but to fight to a finish...Ireland has shown she is a nation. This generation can claim to have raised sons as brave as any that went before. And in the years to come Ireland will honour those who risked all for her honour at Easter 1916.

==Legacy==
Galway City&#x27;s Ceannt Station, the main bus and rail station in his native county of Galway, is named in his honour, as well as Éamonn Ceannt Park in Dublin. Eamonn Ceannt Tower in Ballymun, which was demolished in 2005, was also named after him. There is also a commemorative plaque on the wall of Scholars Townhouse Hotel, the former Christian Brother School where Eamonn Ceannt was educated.

Ceannt Barracks located in the Curragh Camp bears his name.

Ceannt Fort in Dublin 8 was renamed in his honour, having been laid out in 1917-1922 by Dublin Corporation and originally named McCaffrey&#x27;s Estate.

<doc id="567753" wikidata="Q895261" url="?curid=567753" title="Boursin cheese">
<text>Boursin is a brand of soft creamy cheese available in various flavours, with a flavour and texture similar to cream cheese.

The first Boursin flavour, garlic and fine herbs, was created in 1957 by François Boursin, a cheese maker from Normandy. Boursin&#x27;s product was derived from a traditional party dish, fromage frais (French for &quot;fresh cheese&quot;); guests would take their cheese and add herbs for flavour. His recipe was the first flavoured cheese product to be sold nationally in France.

Boursin cheese was first developed in Normandy, and at one time was produced exclusively in Croisy-sur-Eure, France, by the Boursin company. In 1990, the Boursin name was acquired by Unilever, who sold it to Groupe Bel in November 2007 for €400 million.

==Advertising==
The brand was advertised on television from 1 October 1968, when French television allowed commercial breaks for the first time. In 1972 their advertising slogan: &quot;Du pain, du vin, du Boursin&quot; (English: &quot;Some bread, some wine, some Boursin&quot;) was launched. This slogan was later modified to &quot;Du pain, du Boursin, on est bien&quot; (&quot;Some bread, some Boursin, we are good&quot;).

<doc id="567768" wikidata="Q1430048" url="?curid=567768" title="Florida A&amp;M University">
<text>Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU), commonly known as Florida A&amp;M, is a public historically black land-grant university in Tallahassee, Florida, United States. Founded in 1887, It is the third-largest historically black university in the US by enrollment and the only public historically black university in Florida. It is a member of the State University System of Florida and is accredited to award baccalaureate, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

FAMU sports teams are known as the Rattlers, and compete in Division I of the NCAA. They are a member of the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC).

==History==
Black abolitionist Jonathan C. Gibbs first introduced legislation to create the State Normal College for Colored Students in 1885, one year after being elected to the Florida Legislature. The date also reflects the new Florida Constitution of 1885, which prohibited racial integration in schools. The college was located in Tallahassee because Leon County and adjacent counties led the state in African-American population, reflecting Tallahassee&#x27;s former status as the center of Florida&#x27;s slave trade. (See Tallahassee&#x27;s black history.) The site of the university is the 375-acre slave plantation of Florida governor William Pope Duval, whose mansion, today the site of the Carnegie Library, burned in 1905.
On October 3, 1887, the State Normal College for Colored Students began classes, and became a land-grant college four years later when it received $7,500 under the Second Morrill Act, and its name was changed to State Normal and Industrial College for Colored Students. However, it was not an official institution of higher learning until the 1905 Buckman Act, which transferred control from the Department of Education to the Board of Control, creating what was the foundation for the modern Florida A&amp;M University. This same act is responsible for the creation of the University of Florida and Florida State University from their previous institutions. In 1909, the name of the college was once again changed, to Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes, and in 1953 the name was finally changed to Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University. Florida A&amp;M is the only surviving publicly funded historically black college or university in the state of Florida. (Twelve publicly-funded junior colleges serving primarily the African-American population of Florida existed for different periods between 1949 and 1966.)

In 1923, there was a student strike that led to the destruction of multiple campus buildings. The strike was a response to Governor Cary A. Hardee&#x27;s attempts to eliminate the liberal arts program at the university and convert it to a purely vocational school. Hardee believed that a more educated black populace would be more likely to leave the state, which would negatively impact Florida&#x27;s economy, and thus believed it was necessary to prevent African-American Floridians from being able to access non-vocational education. The conflict led to the resignation of university president Nathan B. Young, which in turn sparked a student protest that burned down multiple campus buildings. Ultimately, the liberal arts program was restored after the end of Hardee&#x27;s term and the appointment of J. R. E. Lee as the fourth president of the university.
In 1951, the university started a pharmacy and nursing program. In order to give these students hands-on experience, the university built a hospital. Until 1971 Florida A&amp;M Hospital was the only one within of Tallahassee to serve African Americans. It closed in 1971, after then-Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, under federal pressure, started serving African Americans.

On May 26, 1956, Wilhemina Jakes and Carrie Patterson, two Florida A&amp;M University students, were arrested by the Tallahassee Police Department for &quot;placing themselves in a position to incite a riot&quot; which led to the Tallahassee bus boycott which sought to end racial segregation in the employment and seating arrangements of city buses.

In 1963, FAMU students demonstrated against segregation in the city.

In 1992, 1995, and 1997, FAMU successfully recruited more National Achievement Scholars than Harvard. FAMU tied with Harvard in 2000, recruiting 62 new National Achievement Scholars, although by 2006 that number had declined to one. The National Achievement Scholarship Corporation discontinued naming scholars in 2015.

In the fall of 1997, FAMU was selected as the &quot;Time&quot;-&quot;Princeton Review&quot; &quot;College of the Year&quot; and was cited in 1999 by &quot;Black Issues in Higher Education&quot; for awarding more baccalaureate degrees to African-Americans than any institution in the nation.

In 2011 Robert Champion, a band member, was beaten to death in a hazing incident. Two faculty members resigned in connection with a hazing investigation and thirteen people were charged with felony or misdemeanor hazing crimes; one student, a band member, was convicted of manslaughter and hazing charges and sentenced to six years in prison. The scandal resulted in the resignation of FAMU&#x27;s president and played a role in the university&#x27;s regional accreditor, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, placing FAMU on probation for one year.

In 2019, FAMU and other HBCUs developed a partnership with Adtalem Global Education and its for-profit Ross University School of Medicine in Barbados.

In May 2024, FAMU administrators announced during a commencement ceremony that it had received a $237 million donation, the largest single personal donation to FAMU in its 136-year history and the largest gift ever to a HBCU, from Gregory Gerami, CEO of Batterson Farms Corporation. The gift quickly came under scrutiny due to questions about its legitimacy. The donation was stock from Gerami&#x27;s private company and its value could not be determined. In response to the public skepticism, FAMU paused the acceptance of the gift and initiated an external investigation to determine the soundness of the Gerami donation. The following month, university president Larry Robinson resigned. His resignation followed the May 2024 resignation of Shawnta Friday-Stroud, FAMU&#x27;s former vice president for university advancement and executive director of the FAMU Foundation, who played a key role in negotiating the Gerami donation.

In August 2024, FAMU released a final report prepared by Buchanan Ingersoll &amp; Rooney that concluded that the Gerami donation was of no real cash value. The report suggested that the proposed donor may have knowingly misrepresented his financial holdings and outlined how much the failed gift cost the university in actual travel and entertainment expenses as well as negative impact on the university&#x27;s reputation.

<text>Simon Webster Frith (born 1946) is a British sociomusicologist and former rock critic who specializes in popular music culture. He is professor emeritus of Music at University of Edinburgh.

== Career ==
As a student, he read PPE at Oxford and earned a doctorate in sociology from UC Berkeley. He is the author of many books, including &quot;The Sociology of Rock&quot; (Constable, 1978), &quot;Sound Effects: Youth, Leisure and the Politics of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; (Pantheon, 1981), &quot;Art into Pop&quot; (Methuen, 1987 – written with Howard Horne), &quot;Music for Pleasure: Essays on the Sociology of Pop&quot; (Cambridge University Press, 1988), and&quot; Performing Rites: On the Value of Popular Music&quot; (Oxford University Press, 1996). He has also co-edited key anthologies in the interdisciplinary field of popular music studies, including: &quot;On Record: Rock, Pop &amp; the Written Word&quot; (Routledge, 1990), &quot;Sound and Vision: Music Video Reader&quot; (Routledge, 1993), and &quot;The Cambridge Companion to Pop and Rock&quot; (Cambridge University Press, 2001).

Frith has edited a four-volume set, &quot;Popular Music: Critical Concepts in Media &amp; Cultural Studies&quot; (Routledge, 2004), and published a collection of his key essays, &quot;Taking Popular Music Seriously: Selected Essays&quot; (Ashgate, 2007). He is the co-author of a three-volume work, &quot;The History of Live Music in Britain since 1950&quot;, by Ashgate.

Frith has chaired the judges of the Mercury Music Prize since it began in 1992. His popular music criticism has appeared in a range of popular presses including the &quot;Village Voice&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. He taught in the Sociology Department at the University of Warwick and the English Studies Department at Strathclyde University. In 1999, he went to the University of Stirling as Professor of Film and Media. In 2006, he took up his last post, Tovey Chair of Music at the University of Edinburgh, from which he retired and was appointed professor emeritus in 2017. He is the brother of guitarist and composer Fred Frith and neuroscientist Chris Frith.

According to author Bernard Gendron, writing in his 2002 book &quot;Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club: Popular Music and the Avant-Garde&quot;, Frith &quot;has done the most to lay the foundations for the analysis of rock criticism&quot;. Frith was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to higher education and popular music.

== &quot;The Sociology of Rock&quot; ==
In &quot;The Sociology of Rock&quot; (1978) Frith examines the consumption, production, and ideology of rock music. He explores rock as leisure, as youth culture, as a force for liberation or oppression, and as background music. He argues that rock music is a mass cultural form which derives its meaning and relevance from being a mass medium. He discusses the differences in perception and use of rock between the music industry and music consumers, as well as differences within those groups: &quot;The industry may or may not keep control of rock&#x27;s use, but it will not be able to determine all its meanings – the problems of capitalist community and leisure are not so easily resolved.&quot;

== &quot;Bad music&quot; ==
Frith (2004, p. 17-9) argued that &quot;&#x27;bad music&#x27; is a necessary concept for musical pleasure, for musical aesthetics.&quot; He distinguishes two common kinds of bad music; the first is the &quot;Worst Records Ever Made&quot; type, which includes:
* &quot;Tracks which are clearly incompetent musically; made by singers who can&#x27;t sing, players who can&#x27;t play, producers who can&#x27;t produce,&quot;
* &quot;Tracks involving genre confusion. The most common examples are actors or TV stars recording in the latest style.&quot;
The second type is the &quot;rock critical list&quot;, which includes:
* &quot;Tracks that feature sound gimmicks that have outlived their charm or novelty,&quot;
* &quot;Tracks that depend on false sentiment (...), that feature an excess of feeling molded into a radio-friendly pop song.&quot;

He later gives three common qualities attributed to bad music: inauthentic, [in] bad taste (see also: kitsch), and stupid. He argues that &quot;The marking off of some tracks and genres and artists as &#x27;bad&#x27; is a necessary part of popular music pleasure; it is a way we establish our place in various music worlds. And &#x27;bad&#x27; is a key word here because it suggests that aesthetic and ethical judgements are tied together here: not to like a record is not just a matter of taste; it is also a matter of argument, and argument that matters.&quot; (p. 28)

== &quot;Four social functions of popular music&quot; ==
In &quot;Towards an Aesthetic of Popular Music&quot; Simon Frith (1987) argues that popular music has four social functions that account for its value and popularity in society. Popular music:

# &quot;We enjoy popular music is because of its use in answering questions of identity.&quot;
# &quot;To give us a way of managing the relationship between our public and private emotional lives.&quot;
# &quot;To shape popular memory, to organize our sense of time.&quot;
# &quot;Popular music is something possessed.&quot;

<text>Spessard Lindsey Holland (July 10, 1892 – November 6, 1971) was an American lawyer and politician. A Southern Democrat, he served as the 28th governor of Florida from 1941 to 1945, and as a U.S. senator for Florida from 1946 to 1971. He was the first person born in Florida to serve as governor and U.S. senator for the state. While serving as a U.S. senator he would notably introduce the 24th Amendment.

During his tenure as governor, he was mainly preoccupied with preparations for World War II and the war itself. On the death of U.S. Senator Charles O. Andrews, Holland was appointed by Governor Millard F. Caldwell on September 25, 1946, to serve out the rest of Andrews&#x27; term, which was to expire the following January. He was elected to a full term in November 1946 and was re-elected senator in 1952, 1958 and 1964, retiring in January 1971.

==Early life and education==
Spessard Holland was one of three children of Benjamin Franklin Holland and the former Fannie Virginia Spessard. Benjamin Holland was a Confederate veteran of the American Civil War, serving as a member of the Georgia State Line under Company I of the 2nd Regiment. Benjamin&#x27;s father was the orderly sergeant for his son&#x27;s unit. Benjamin was born in Carroll County, Georgia in 1846 and was 17 when he joined the Georgia State Line in January 1864. He participated in the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, where he was wounded. In 1882 he moved to Bartow, Florida, where he created the first abstract company in Polk County; he eventually served as a member of the school board, as a county commissioner, and as the county treasurer.

Virginia Spessard, who was known by her middle name, moved to Bartow in 1889 and was a teacher at the Summerlin Institute (now Bartow High School) prior to her marriage. Benjamin and Virginia married in September 1890 in Monroe County, West Virginia.

Their son Spessard was born at his family&#x27;s home at 390 East Church Street in Bartow, on July 10, 1892. He attended public schools, graduating from the Summerlin Institute in 1909. Holland graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from Emory College (now Emory University) in Atlanta in 1912. Holland went on to teach high school in Warrenton, Georgia from 1912 to 1914.
In 1916, Holland began attending law school at the University of Florida. There he taught in the &quot;sub-freshman department&quot; (high school) of the university. He also became the first elected student body president and a member of the debating society. During his time at Emory and UF, he participated in track and field, football, basketball, and baseball. On one occasion, he played so well as a pitcher in an exhibition game against the Philadelphia Athletics that Connie Mack (the grandfather of Connie Mack III, who later held the Senate seat Holland once occupied) offered him a contract that Holland ultimately declined.

==World War I service==
Holland qualified for a Rhodes Scholarship, and was already a junior partner with R.B. Huffaker in the Huffaker &amp; Holland law firm, but his plans were interrupted by World War I. He volunteered for service and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Coast Artillery Corps, where he was transferred to France and served in the brigade&#x27;s JAG Corps as an assistant adjutant. At his request, Holland was later transferred to the 24th Aero Squadron, Signal Corps of the Army Air Corps. Here he served with Lieutenant George E. Goldthwaite as a gunner and aerial observer, gathering information and taking photographs in reconnaissance missions behind enemy lines. At various times Holland took part in battles at Meuse-Argonne, Champagne, St. Mihiel, and Lunéville, where he downed two enemy planes; on one mission, Holland&#x27;s plane crash-landed in a crater. On December 11, 1918, Holland and Goldthwaite were each awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Holland&#x27;s citation, signed by General John J. Pershing, noted:

:First Lieutenant Spessard L. Holland, C.A.C. Observer 24th, Aero Squadron, distinguished himself by extra-ordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United States at Bois de Banthville, France, on October 15, 1918 and in recognition of his gallant conduct I have awarded him in the name of the President the Distinguished Service Cross.&quot;

Holland was promoted to captain. Once back in the U.S., he toured for the Victory Loan Drive. He then went to Fort Monroe, Virginia, where he resigned his commission in July 1919. Holland then resumed his law practice in Bartow.

==Early political career==
Holland&#x27;s return to his law practice was short-lived; he accepted an appointment as the Polk County prosecutor in late 1919. He left that position after being elected to a four-year term as a county judge in 1920. Re-elected in 1924, Holland left the judgeship at the end of his second term, in 1929. He then returned to private law practice, joining William F. Bevis in the firm of Holland &amp; Bevis. The firm grew rapidly, eventually becoming a large international law firm that still exists today as Holland &amp; Knight.

In 1932, Holland was elected to the Florida Senate, where he served eight years. During his two terms, Holland was noted for his strong advocacy for public schools; as a member of the school committee, he drafted and cosponsored the Florida School Code and supported legislation that raised teachers&#x27; pay and retirement benefits. Holland also supported workers&#x27; compensation, tax cuts, and unemployment insurance. He was strongly opposed to both the sales tax and the poll tax, the latter of which he worked with fellow state Senator Ernest R. Graham to repeal in 1937.

Although Holland supported discrimination against African-American voters, he opposed the poll tax because he viewed it as a form of wealth discrimination that made voting difficult for both poor whites and poor African-Americans. Publicly, Holland cited two reasons for his opposition to the poll tax. The first was that he thought it allowed politicians to &quot;buy&quot; their way into office through political machines. Secondly, he thought that eliminating the poll tax would increase voter turnout in elections.

== Gubernatorial campaign ==
Holland announced he was running for governor on December 4, 1939, after considering running for U.S. senator but deciding against it. His campaign platform called for expanding assistance to the elderly through increasing a tax on horse and dog tracks, making highways safer, continuing a ban on poll taxes for state elections, creating Everglades National Park, giving state financial aid for economic development, regulating salary buyers, repealing the gross receipts tax, and improving working conditions in Florida. He also pitched himself as being hard on crime but for tourism in the state.

In the initial primary, Holland finished first but failed to attain the required majority of the vote. Advancing to a runoff, he faced Francis P. Whitehair, who attacked Holland throughout the runoff campaign. Whitehair said in a speech that Holland was a candidate for &quot;&#x27;an invisible government&#x27; of duPont interests, chain stores, and a fertilizer trust.&quot; Holland, for his part, charged that Whitehair was a product of a political machine; Whitehair accused Holland of the same thing. Holland ended up winning the runoff. For the general election, the Republicans nominated John F. Walter as their candidate for governor, but he ended up dropping out; Walter&#x27;s party then was a distinct minority in Florida. Holland ended up winning the general election even more easily than Democrats usually did at the time.

== Governorship ==

=== Overview ===
While governor, Holland promoted the establishment of military bases in his state. He also supported the state public school system&#x27;s financial condition. A variety of financial reforms were also undertaken during his tenure.

=== 1941 ===
Holland was sworn in as governor of Florida on January 7, 1941. As governor, his powers were limited. Under the 1885 Florida Constitution, the governor could only serve for one four-year term and the governorship was described as being a weak position. Holland also had to compete with the influence of Cabinet members who could be re-elected.

Concerns about World War II were dominant with audiences during Holland&#x27;s campaign for governor; he wished for peace but said that preparations should be made in case of American involvement in the war. He began those preparations with a review of $7 million in State Road Department contracts made during the administration of his predecessor as governor, Fred P. Cone. Holland and his wife attended President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s third inauguration and while in Washington, D.C., he spoke with federal authorities and Florida&#x27;s congressional delegation about getting more money for defense road construction; he was successful in obtaining the funds. Florida saw an increase in military activities during the mobilization prior to entering World War II.

When Holland became governor, he attempted to improve Florida&#x27;s record on lynching. Florida, like the rest of the Southern U.S., faced pressure to take action on lynching during the 1940s. Holland&#x27;s first challenge came on May 12, 1941, when 22-year-old A.C. Williams, an African-American accused of raping a 12-year-old girl and committing a robbery, was abducted in Quincy, Florida and lynched. Afterward, there was pressure on the local government to act as it was feared that the federal government would become involved; pressure was also seen from the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching (ASWPL), who wrote letters to Holland. In response, Holland called for an investigation into the death of Williams and named Maurice Tripp as the special investigator. A spokesperson for Holland said: &quot;he would be able to reach a decision on whether any action by him against Quincy law enforcement authorities was justified. The pressure of legislative business on the governor was heavy, and the inquest transcript is long.&quot; Tripp submitted a report to Governor Holland on May 25, 1941, and in July 1942 the case was given to the United States Department of Justice, which reviewed it. The identities of those who killed Williams were never discovered.

When American involvement in World War II began with the attack on Pearl Harbor, Holland promoted new military bases in Florida and co-ordinated state defenses with the federal government. Governor Holland put the Florida Highway Patrol on standby to assist the Federal Bureau of Investigation with taking Japanese Americans and foreigners into custody.

The impact of World War II was felt at a more personal level in Holland&#x27;s life as well. One of his sons, Spessard Holland Jr., served as a Marine in the South Pacific. The family planted a victory garden and set up a chicken coop at the Governor&#x27;s Mansion. Holland&#x27;s daughter Mary volunteered as an aircraft spotter, while his daughter Ivanhoe and his wife Mary sewed squares to be used in quilts sent to U.S. troops. The mansion was visited by British soldiers who were training in the area; the First Lady corresponded with the soldiers&#x27; mothers.

=== 1942 ===
When the United States entered World War II, German admiral Karl Dönitz launched Operation Drumbeat starting in January 1942, in an effort to cause significant damage to American shipping along the Eastern seaboard and the Gulf Coast. Except for a brief lull in March, U-boat activity on Florida&#x27;s coasts lasted until April. As a result of the U-boat activity, tourism declined in the state, and the idea of building the Cross Florida Barge Canal was revived. Holland was neutral on the canal compared to U.S. senators Charles O. Andrews and Claude Pepper, who strongly supported it. Holland said the reason behind his neutrality was because the canal itself was incredibly controversial.

During the 1942 general election, Holland participated despite not being up for re-election. He traveled throughout the state making public appearances in an attempt to generate interest in the election, trying to get a gas tax amendment passed. Holland made a statewide radio address urging people to vote. That year nine amendments were on the ballot, and Holland backed three of them: an amendment that would streamline the process for amending the state constitution, the gas tax amendment and another that would create a state freshwater fish &amp; game commission. All nine amendments passed that year with almost no opposition.

=== 1943 ===
During 1943 there were calls for a special session of the state legislature. State Senator Wallace E. Sturgis, from Ocala, wanted a special session to revise an absentee-voting law to allow Floridians serving in the military outside the state to register to vote. Sturgis later got the backing of the president pro tempore of the Senate, Ernest F. Householder. Those wanting to repeal the cigarette tax also joined in calling for a special session. Holland reacted to this by attempting to reduce enthusiasm for a special session. Regarding the absentee-voting law, Holland thought that it did a good job when it came to initial primaries except in instances of those who became 21 prior to leaving the state. However, he thought it was not practical with runoffs, as they were very close in time to the first contests, along with being able to send out and receive returned ballots as well. As for the cigarette tax, Holland opposed repealing it, as it could serve as a supplement in case other taxes were decreased. Holland also cited potential changes in wartime restrictions. Having a special session became a significant issue in the 1944 Democratic gubernatorial primaries.

During a conference in Denver, Colorado, Holland promoted new railroad freight prices, helping the Florida economy.

=== 1944 &amp; 1945 ===
Holland was an outdoorsman and environmentalist. His negotiation of the purchase of Everglades wetland and marshland in 1944 helped lead to the establishment of Everglades National Park in 1947.

Holland&#x27;s term ended on January 2, 1945, when Millard F. Caldwell took office.

==U.S. Senator==

On September 25, 1946 Holland assumed the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Charles O. Andrews, who had died a week earlier after being appointed by Governor Caldwell. In November Holland defeated Republican J. Harry Schad to win a full six-year term.

Holland, like many Southern Democrats, was a conservative who was pro-business, supported racial segregation, staunchly opposed the civil rights movement and labor unions, and believed in a limited federal government and states&#x27; rights. He opposed Harry Truman&#x27;s proposals for national health insurance and the Fair Employment Practices Commission, and voted to override Truman&#x27;s veto of the Taft-Hartley Act. However, he accepted the elements of the New Deal that benefited Florida economically, much like other Southern politicians of his time. Holland&#x27;s views contrasted with those of Claude Pepper, the senior U.S. senator from Florida during his first four years, who was a more outspoken liberal. Holland had bad relations with governors Daniel T. McCarty, who he described as being &quot;cold&quot; or &quot;thorny,&quot; and LeRoy Collins, who openly disliked his record in the Senate.

=== First term ===
As he had in the Florida Senate, Holland supported abolishing the poll tax for federal elections during his time in the U.S. Senate, making an attempt to ban it during every session for a dozen years after arriving in Congress. During the 80th Congress, allies in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced H.R. 29, which passed the House on a 290-112 vote on July 21, 1947, but was filibustered in the Senate. During the following 81st Congress, H.R. 3199 was introduced; it passed the House on July 26, 1949, on a 273-116 vote, but failed to get past the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. On other issues, Holland remained a segregationist who supported discrimination against Black voters, but maintained his view that the poll tax should be repealed because it was a form of wealth discrimination.

=== Second term ===
In 1952 Holland ran for re-election, winning a significantly larger margin of the vote (99.82%) than in the previous race in 1946 (78.65%). He, along with all other senators from the former Confederate states (except Lyndon B. Johnson, Estes Kefauver, and Albert Gore, Sr.), signed the 1956 &quot;Southern Manifesto&quot;, which condemned the Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954), declaring that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional, and promised to resist its implementation.

Holland did favor statehood for Alaska and Hawaii. The first Southerner to support statehood for Hawaii, he voted for both the Alaska Statehood Act and the Hawaii Admission Act. Along with his support for Alaska&#x27;s statehood, he introduced the two senators-elect from Alaska who were produced as a result of the Alaska-Tennessee Plan to the U.S. Senate: E.L. &quot;Bob&quot; Bartlett and Ernest Gruening.

=== Third term ===
Up for re-election in 1958, Holland was challenged by his former colleague Claude Pepper (who had been defeated for renomination in 1950) in the Democratic primary. After fending off Pepper&#x27;s challenge, he easily defeated his Republican opponent, Leland Hyzer, in November to win a third term.

During the 87th Congress, Holland finally succeeded in his long-standing quest to ban the poll tax federally. Holland introduced a constitutional amendment that would prohibit states from conditioning the right to vote in federal elections on payment of a poll tax or other types of tax. The amendment was approved by a required two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress in August 1962 and was quickly ratified by the required three-fourths of the states (38), and in January 1964 became the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Described as a conservative Democrat, Holland believed in maintaining the filibuster and believed that civil rights was a matter for the states. Speaking in opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Holland said &quot;We&#x27;ll stand up and fight as long as we can&quot;.

On November 22, 1963, in the absence of Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts was presiding over a routine session of the Senate, which was debating a bill about federal library services. It was almost time for a lunch break when staffer Richard Reidell came running into the chamber where he bumped into Holland, whispering that President John F. Kennedy had been shot and Holland was the first senator to be informed of it. Reidell told Senator Kennedy of the news about his brother. After hearing this Kennedy left and went to the lobby where he called the White House and his surviving brother, U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, before going to his office in the Senate Office Building. Holland replaced Kennedy as the presiding officer in the Senate when he left.

=== Fourth term ===
Holland won a fourth term in 1964, this time defeating Republican Claude R. Kirk, Jr. (who would be elected governor in 1966). In November 1969, at the age of 77, Holland announced that he would not seek re-election in 1970. He actively campaigned for Democrat Lawton Chiles, who defeated Republican U.S. Representative William C. Cramer in the general election. Cramer had the endorsement of President Richard Nixon, and had handily defeated G. Harrold Carswell (whom Nixon had earlier nominated unsuccessfully to the U.S. Supreme Court) in the Republican primary.

==Personal life==
Holland married Mary Agnes Groover (born July 31, 1896) on February 8, 1919, and they were together until his death. Together they had four children: Spessard Lindsey Holland Jr. (1921-1989), Mary Groover Holland Lewis (1924-1997), William Benjamin Holland (1926-1974) and Ivanhoe Elizabeth Holland (1931-2017?). Mary Holland died of a stroke on March 22, 1975, at age 78. In 1974, the city of Bartow had dedicated Mary Holland Park in her honor.

Spessard Holland was also a member of several fraternities during his life: Phi Beta Kappa, Alpha Tau Omega and Phi Delta Phi. His son Spessard Lindsey Holland, Jr. was a nonregistered member of Phi Delta Phi. He was involved with Freemasonry, being a 33rd degree Shriner. Holland also was a member of the Sons of the American Revolution, the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Bartow&#x27;s Kiwanis club and the Elks. General James Van Fleet was a personal friend of Holland and supported his candidacy for governor.

He was described as being a conservationist and enjoyed birdwatching. Holland liked hunting and fishing as well. He was a fan of baseball and football and played tennis; he enjoyed collecting books on Florida history. While teaching in Georgia, he was known to have owned a motorcycle and crashed it many times; once he was flung 60 feet from it and landed scraping much of the skin from his back.

Holland left office in January 1971. He died of a heart attack at his Bartow home only ten months later, on November 6, 1971, at age 79.

<text>Key Biscayne () is an island located in Miami-Dade County, Florida, located between the Atlantic Ocean and Biscayne Bay. It is the southernmost of the barrier islands along the Atlantic coast of Florida, and lies south of Miami Beach and southeast of Miami. The key is connected to Miami via the Rickenbacker Causeway, originally built in 1947.

The northern portion of Key Biscayne is home to Crandon Park, a county park. The middle section of the island consists of the incorporated Village of Key Biscayne. The southern part of the island is now protected as Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park, adjacent to Biscayne National Park, one of the two national parks in Miami-Dade County.

==Name==
Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda related that a sailor from the Bay of Biscay, called the &quot;Viscayno&quot; or &quot;Biscayno&quot;, had lived on the lower east coast of Florida for a while after being shipwrecked. A 17th-century map shows &quot;Cayo de Biscainhos&quot;, the probable origin of &quot;Key Biscayne&quot;.

==Geography==
Key Biscayne, although named a &quot;key&quot;, is not geologically part of the Florida Keys, but is a barrier island composed of sand eroded from the Appalachian Mountains, carried to the coast by rivers and then moved along the coast from the north by coastal currents. The eastern edge of Key Biscayne is underlain by the Key Largo Limestone, a fossilized ancient reef that is exposed in the upper and middle Florida Keys. Elsewhere, there is no hard bedrock near the surface of the island, only layers of weak sandstone to depths of or more. The coastal transport of sand southward ends at Key Biscayne. In the 1850s, Louis Agassiz noted that &quot;[s]outh of Cape Florida no more silicacious sand is to be seen.&quot; (The beaches in the Florida Keys, by contrast, consist primarily of finely pulverized shells.) Geologists believe that the island emerged around 2000 BCE, soon after the sea level stopped rising, as the sand built up to form new barrier islands on the southern Florida coast.

Key Biscayne is elongated in the north–south direction, tapering to a point at each end. It is approximately long and wide. The northern end of the island is separated from another barrier island, Virginia Key, by Bear Cut. The southern end of the island is Cape Florida. The Cape Florida Channel separates the island from the Safety Valve, an expanse of shallow flats cut by tidal channels that extends southward about to the Ragged Keys, at the northern end of the Florida Keys. 

Only Soldier Key, approximately wide, lies between Key Biscayne and the Ragged Keys. The Cape Florida Channel, deep in 1849, and Bear Cut, deep in 1849, are the deepest natural channels into Biscayne Bay. They provided the only access for ocean-going vessels to Biscayne Bay until artificial channels were dredged starting early in the 20th century. In 1849 the island had a fine sandy beach on the east side, and mangroves and lagoons on the west side. The average elevation of the island is less than five feet (1.5 m) above sea level.

Key Biscayne is located at (25.690329, -80.165118).

==History==

===Early history===
The first known indigenous inhabitants of Key Biscayne were Tequestas. Shells, bones and artifacts found on the island indicate extensive use of it by the Tequesta. A large community appeared to inhabit the island between 1,500 and 2,000 years ago. In 1992 Hurricane Andrew scoured much of the vegetation from the southern end of Key Biscayne. An archaeological survey of the exposed ground found evidence of extensive habitation.

Juan Ponce de León charted Key Biscayne on his first mission to the New World in 1513. He christened the island Santa Marta and claimed it for the Spanish Crown. He reported that he found a fresh water spring on the island. Ponce de León called the bay behind the island (Biscayne Bay) &quot;Chequescha&quot;, a variant form of Tequesta.

The next European known to have visited the Key Biscayne area was Pedro Menéndez de Avilés. In 1565 his ship took refuge in Biscayne Bay from a storm. Relations were established with the Tequesta, and in 1567 a mission was established on the mainland across the bay from Key Biscayne. The mission was abandoned three years later in 1570. No other mission was established on the mainland until 1743, and that was withdrawn a few months later.

The first known European settlers on Key Biscayne were Pedro Fornells, his family and household. Fornells and his wife Mariana were Menorcan survivors of the New Smyrna colony in northern Florida. Pedro and Mariana had joined other Menorcans in seeking refuge at St. Augustine after leaving New Smyrna. They stayed in the city after the Spanish regained Florida in 1783. Fornells received a Royal Grant for on the southern end of Key Biscayne in 1805. The grant required Fornells to live on the island and establish cultivation within six months. He moved his household to the island, but after six months, the family returned to St. Augustine, leaving a caretaker named Vincent on the island.

===Territorial years===
Following the First Seminole War and a treaty with Spain, Florida became a U.S. territory in 1821. Under pressure from US settlers, Seminole and Black Seminoles began to migrate into central and southern Florida. In the early 19th century, African-American slaves and Black Seminoles escaped to the Bahamas from Cape Florida to evade American slaver catchers. In 1820, one traveler reported seeing 60 &quot;Indians&quot;, 60 &quot;runaway slaves&quot;, and 27 boats of Bahamian wreckers preparing to leave Cape Florida. In a short period before the Cape Florida lighthouse was built in 1825, an estimated 300 Black Seminoles found passage from Key Biscayne to Andros Island in the Bahamas on seagoing canoes and Bahamian boats, settling at Red Bays and Nicholls Town. Although Key Biscayne was less suitable as a departure point after the lighthouse was built, the Bahamas remained a haven for escaping slaves.

In 1824 Mary Ann Channer Davis, who had moved to St. Augustine with her husband in 1821, bought the Fornells claim to Key Biscayne from one of the Fornells&#x27; heirs for US$100. Mary and her husband William Davis, a deputy U.S. Marshal, probably were aware of plans to build a lighthouse on the Florida coast somewhere between St. Augustine and Key West, and knew that Key Biscayne was a likely location for it. Mary and William sold three acres (about one-and-a-quarter hectares) of their newly acquired land at the southern tip of the island (Cape Florida) to the U.S. government for US$225. The federal government built the Cape Florida lighthouse on that land in 1825.

The first U.S. citizens to take up permanent residence on Key Biscayne were Captain John Dubose, his wife Margaret and their five children in 1825, when Dubose became the first keeper for the new Cape Florida Light, a post he held until the lighthouse was burned in 1836. The family was also accompanied by two former slaves of Margaret&#x27;s brother. The Dubose household grew during that time and was reported in 1833 to consist of &quot;eleven whites and several negroes&quot;. During his tenure as lighthouse keeper, Dubose received hundreds of plants and seeds from Dr. Henry Perrine, United States Consul in Campeche, Mexico, which he planted on the island. In 1835 a major hurricane struck the island, damaging the lighthouse and the keeper&#x27;s house, and putting the island under three feet of water, which killed almost all the plants that Dr. Perrine had sent from Mexico.

===War with the Seminoles===

In 1836, during the Second Seminole War, Seminoles attacked and burned the Cape Florida lighthouse, severely wounding the assistant lighthouse keeper in charge; his black assistant died of wounds. The lighthouse was not repaired and put back into commission until 1847.

A military post was established on Key Biscayne in March 1838. Its first commander was Lt. Col. James Bankhead. The fort was initially known as Fort Dallas or Fort Bankhead, but it was eventually renamed Fort Russell for Captain Samuel L. Russell. He was killed when the Seminoles ambushed two boats on the Miami River in February 1839. In the summer of 1839, a total of 143 soldiers and sailors were stationed at Fort Russell. Some of the Seminoles captured during the war were held at Fort Russell until they could be placed on ships to be removed to Indian Territory.

A hospital was established at Fort Russell for United States Army, United States Navy, and United States Marine Corps personnel. In August 1840, the Army surgeon at the hospital treated 103 patients, including 23 for fever and 26 for dysentery. Dysentery was the leading cause of death at the fort, followed by malaria, tuberculosis, gunshot wounds and alcoholism.

Colonel Bankhead was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel William S. Harney in 1839. Colonel Harney had two earlier encounters with Seminoles, the first a battle in which Chief Arpeika eluded capture, and a second in which Harney escaped in only his shirt and drawers from an early morning attack (the Harney Massacre) on his camp led by Chief Chakaika. In light of these experiences, Harney instituted an intensive training program in swamp and jungle warfare for his men. After Chakaika led the raid on Indian Key in August 1840, Harney set out into the Everglades after Chakaika, and killed him in his own camp. The war quieted down after that, with active pursuit of the Seminoles ending in 1842, although some of the Seminoles remained hidden in the Everglades.

While the war against the Seminoles continued, Mary and William Davis made plans to develop a town on Key Biscayne. They had a town plan printed in Philadelphia. The island was touted as an ideal destination &quot;for the recovery of the health&quot;. When Indian Key had been named the seat for the newly created Dade County in 1836, the county provided that the county court would meet annually on Key Biscayne. In late 1839 the United States Postmaster General approved a post office for Key Biscayne. The first two lots of the new town were sold to Lt. Col. Harney for a total of US$1,000. There is no evidence that the post office ever opened; in 1842 the Postmaster General noted that the appointed postmaster had not completed any of the requirements for opening the post office. No further sales of town lots were made after Harney&#x27;s purchase.

A complication arose when Venancio Sanchez of St. Augustine purchased for US$400 a half share in the old Fornells grant from another surviving heir, who lived in Havana. A feud quickly developed between Sanchez and the Davises, with Sanchez demanding a division of the property, and the Davises refusing to acknowledge that Sanchez had any claim to the island. The Davises had hoped that a restored lighthouse would be the centerpiece of their town, but all attempts to repair the lighthouse failed while the war was on. Shortly after the end of the war, the Davises gave up on Key Biscayne and moved to Texas. Their older son Edmund J. Davis eventually was elected as governor there.

===Surveys and lighthouses===

The numerous ship wrecks that occurred along the southeast coast of Florida from Key Biscayne to the Dry Tortugas was a cause for concern. Between the late 1840s and the late 1850s, more than 500 ships were wrecked on the Florida Reef. The Assistant United States Coast Surveyor reported that in the period from 1845 through 1849, almost one million (United States) dollars worth of vessels and cargoes were lost on the reef.

In 1846, the U.S. Congress appropriated $23,000 to rebuild the Cape Florida lighthouse and work was completed in 1847.

In 1849 the United States Board of Engineers conducted a preliminary survey of the coast of Florida. In a report written by Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Lee in March, 1849, the Board recommended that Key Biscayne be made a military reservation. Later that year, the United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers set up a camp with an astronomical/magnetic station to serve as a datum base for a survey of the Florida Keys and the Great Florida Reef.

To learn more about the Great Florida Reef, Alexander Bache invited Louis Agassiz to study it. The U.S. Coast Survey sent Agassiz to Key Biscayne in 1851. He wrote a detailed report for Bache on the reefs stretching from Key Biscayne to the Marquesas Keys.

The triangulation survey was conducted by the United States Coast Survey with men detailed from the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy. Approximately forty men were based at Cape Florida working on the survey when Alexander Dallas Bache, Superintendent of the U.S. Coast Survey, went to Key Biscayne in 1855 to take charge of it. The survey eventually covered Key Biscayne, Biscayne Bay, the Florida Keys from south of Key Biscayne to the Marquesas Keys, and Florida Bay from the Keys to Cape Sable.

In 1861, Confederate militants sabotaged the lighthouse so that it could not guide Union sailors during the blockade of Confederate Florida. The lighthouse was repaired and re-lit again in 1866. In 1878 the Cape Florida Light was replaced by the Fowey Rocks Light, seven miles (11 km) southeast of Cape Florida.

From 1888 to 1893, the Cape Florida lighthouse was leased by the United States Secretary of the Treasury for a total of US$1.00 (20 cents per annum) to the Biscayne Bay Yacht Club for use as its headquarters. It was listed as the southernmost yacht club in the United States, and the tallest in the world. After the lease expired, the yacht club moved to Coconut Grove, where it continues.

In 1898, in response to the growing tension with Spain over Cuba, which led to the Spanish–American War, the Cape Florida lighthouse was briefly made U.S. Signal Station Number Four. It was one of 36 along the U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast from Maine to Texas. The Signal Stations were established to provide an early warning of any approach of the Spanish fleet.

The north base marker for Key Biscayne was discovered in 1970 as workers were clearing land. It was at first mistaken as a gravestone for someone named A. D. Bache. The survey base marker at Cape Florida ended up under water, as the south end of the island eroded. It could be seen at low tide as late as 1913. In 1988 the Cape Florida base marker was recovered from under water and installed near the Cape Florida lighthouse.

===Development===
Key Biscayne was first developed for coconut cultivation. The earliest mention of coconuts on Key Biscayne is a Spanish account from 1568, although the reference may be to cocoplums rather than coconuts. Mature coconut trees were on Cape Florida by the 1830s, likely grown from coconuts sent from Mexico by Henry Perrine to the first lighthouse keeper, John Dubose.

In the 1880s, Ezra Asher Osborn and Elnathan T. Field of New Jersey started an enterprise to develop the Florida coast from Key Biscayne to Jupiter by clearing native vegetation, leveling Indian midden mounds and beach dunes, and planting coconuts. Osborn and Field imported 300,000 unhusked coconuts from the Caribbean, of which 76,000 were planted on Key Biscayne. Most of the shoots from the coconuts on Key Biscayne were eaten by rats and marsh rabbits (&quot;Sylvilagus palustris&quot;). As a result of their efforts, in 1885 Osborn and Field were allowed to purchase Key Biscayne and other oceanfront land from the Florida Internal Improvement Trust Fund for 70 cents an acre.

Mary Ann Davis, who had bought the Fornells grant on Key Biscayne in 1821, died in Galveston, Texas in 1885. Her son Waters Smith Davis began taking steps to assert the family title to the island. In 1887 he purchased the rights of the other Davis heirs and received a new deed in his name. He could not get a clear title, however. Venancio Sanchez still claimed a half share of the Fornells Grant, two of the town lots had been sold to William Harney around 1840, and Osborne and Field had their deed from the Florida Internal Improvement Fund. Davis received quitclaims from Osborn and Field, and on the Harney lots, but was unable to settle with Sanchez. He finally received a patent from the United States government for his land in 1898. In 1903 Davis bought the abandoned Cape Florida lighthouse from the United States Treasury for US$400.

Davis started a pineapple plantation on Key Biscayne; six acres (two-and-a-half hectares) had been cleared and planted in pineapples in 1893–94. Davis also directed his caretaker to plant one-half to one acre (two-tenths to four-tenths of a hectare) of bananas. By 1898, a great variety of tropical fruit trees had been planted on the island. Davis also had a large dwelling built for his use. It was a two-story cottage with five bedrooms and verandas on three sides, raised ten feet above the ground on pilings to protect against storm surges.

In the late 1890s, Davis hired Ralph Munroe to oversee his Key Biscayne property. Munroe had begun visiting Biscayne Bay in 1877. He soon built a home, the Barnacle, on land on the mainland in Coconut Grove that he bought from John Frow, keeper of the Cape Florida Light and Fowey Rocks Light. Munroe engaged in wrecking in the waters around Key Biscayne, built sailboats, worked as a pilot for the Cape Florida Channel and opened a pineapple cannery, to which Davis sent his pineapples. Before mail service to the Miami area improved, Munroe would camp out on Key Biscayne every Tuesday evening so that he could sail out to the edge of the Gulf Stream early Wednesday morning to retrieve a package of newspapers and magazines dropped for him in waterproof pouches by a passing steamship. Munroe was also one of the founding members of the Biscayne Bay Yacht Club.

In 1896, Henry Morrison Flagler brought the Florida East Coast Railway to Miami. Mary Ann and William Davis had dreamed of building a city on Key Biscayne. Now their son Waters was a retired millionaire, and interested only in preserving Key Biscayne as a quiet retreat for his family. For a while Flagler&#x27;s arrival did disturb their quiet, as Flagler brought in dredges to deepen the Cape Florida Channel and the approaches to the mouth of the Miami River, muddying the formerly clear waters of Biscayne Bay. Soon, however, a shorter route from the ocean to Miami was dredged through the southern end of what is now Miami Beach, at Government Cut, and the Cape Florida Channel was allowed to return to a natural state.

===Coconut plantation and would-be resort===

In 1902, William John Matheson, who had made his fortune in the aniline dye business, visited Biscayne Bay on his yacht. He soon built a winter home in Coconut Grove overlooking the bay. In 1908 Matheson began buying up the property on Key Biscayne north of the Davis holdings, all the way to Bear Cut, over 1,700 (about 690 hectares) acres. Matheson created a plantation community, employing 42 workers by 1915, and 60 later. It included housing for the workers and their families, packing houses, docks, a school, a big barn, windmills, and of (unpaved) roads. The plantation had 36,000 coconut trees, and a variety of other tropical fruits. In 1921 Matheson introduced the Malay Dwarf coconut to the United States. This is now the most common variety of coconut found in Florida, after lethal yellowing killed off most of the Jamaican Tall coconut trees and many other varieties. The Matheson coconut plantation was at least twice as large as any other in the United States. By 1933, the world price for coconut products had dropped to about two-fifths of its 1925 level, and the plantation stopped shipping.

Waters Davis decided to sell his Key Biscayne property in 1913 (he died the following year). He appointed Ralph Munroe to act as his broker. Although Matheson bid on the property, Munroe arranged a sale, for US$20,000, to James Deering, the International Harvester heir and owner of the Villa Vizcaya estate in Miami. In 1914 Deering decided to develop his new land on the island as a tropical resort. He felt that Cape Florida&#x27;s &quot;future lies in making sales for homes.&quot; To prepare, the land was cleared, with marshes and mangroves were filled in. Jetties were built on the ocean side, in the belief that they would protect the beaches from erosion. They have been found to aggravate erosion.

Waters Davis stipulated in his sale to Deering that the Cape Florida lighthouse be restored. Deering wrote to the U.S. government seeking specifications and guidelines for the lighthouse. Government officials were taken aback by the request, wondering how a federal lighthouse could have passed into private hands. An Act of Congress and two Executive Orders, in 1847 and 1897, had reserved the island for the federal lighthouse and for military purposes. Patient legal work eventually convinced the U.S. Congress and President Woodrow Wilson to agree to recognize Matheson&#x27;s and Deering&#x27;s ownership of Key Biscayne.

In 1920, the heirs of Venancio Sanchez filed a lawsuit against James Deering, claiming an undivided half interest in his Cape Florida property. This brought development of the resort on Cape Florida to a halt. After many legal battles, the suit was finally decided in Deering&#x27;s favor by the United States Supreme Court in 1926. The decision came too late for Deering; he had died the previous year.

===1920s to 1950s===
In February 1926, William Matheson entered into an agreement with D. P. Davis, a land developer unrelated to Waters Davis, to develop and re-sell the northern half of Key Biscayne, including all of what is now Crandon Park and about half the present Village of Key Biscayne. Davis had experience with turning submerged or partially submerged land into prime real estate, having created the Davis Islands in Tampa and Davis Shores near St. Augustine. Later in 1926, the City of Coral Gables incorporated with Key Biscayne, which was included in its boundaries. There were dreams of a bridge to the island, making Key Biscayne the seaside resort for Coral Gables, as Miami Beach had become for Miami.

Obstacles to the project arose. In March 1926, the U.S. government auctioned off some lots on Key Biscayne that had been retained when the rest of the island was transferred to the State of Florida. The Mathesons wanted to have clear title to all of their land, and determined to outbid other interested parties for it. They ended up paying US$58,055 for a total of of land, a record price per acre for the auction of U.S. government land up to that date. On September 18, 1926, the Great Miami Hurricane crossed over Key Biscayne on its way to Miami. Although there were no deaths on the island, most of the buildings were destroyed or badly damaged. Many of the plantings were lost, including half of the coconut trees. The Mathesons rushed to restore their plantation, replanting and buying new equipment to replace what was lost. They soon had 30,000 coconut trees replanted on . D. P. Davis could not meet his contract; he declared bankruptcy and disappeared en route to Europe by ship.

The Florida land boom was over, and no bridge was built and no development took place on Key Biscayne for the next two decades. William Matheson died in 1930, leaving the island to his children. In 1939, the U.S. Navy approved a proposal to develop Virginia Key as an air base and sea port. There was talk of putting an air base on the north end of Key Biscayne.

In 1940, William Matheson&#x27;s heirs donated of land, including of beach on the Atlantic Ocean, on the northern end of Key Biscayne to Dade County to be used as a public park, later named Crandon Park. The county commissioner who negotiated the gift, Charles H. Crandon, had offered to have the county build a causeway to Key Biscayne in exchange for the land donation. As planning for the air and sea complex on Virginia Key was proceeding, construction on a causeway to Virginia Key started in 1941.

The Attack on Pearl Harbor and the entry of the United States into World War II stopped all work on the causeway and the development of Virginia Key. After the war, Crandon pushed on with the development project. He got financier Ed Ball to buy six million (U.S.) dollars worth of bonds financing construction of the causeway. The causeway was named for Eddie Rickenbacker, a World War I flying ace, and founder and president of the Miami-based Eastern Air Lines.

Starting in 1951, the Mackle Construction Company offered new homes on the island for US$9,540, with just US$500 down. A U.S. Post Office contract branch was opened, the Community Church started holding services, and the Key Biscayne Elementary School opened in 1952.

The residents of Key Biscayne successfully petitioned the Dade County Commission allow a referendum on incorporating the community. The referendum passed and the Village of Key Biscayne was incorporated in 1991, the first new municipality in the county in 30 years. 

===Cape Florida becomes a state park===
In 1948, José Manuel Áleman, who had fled Cuba in the wake of scandals surrounding his service as education minister under Ramón Grau San Martín, bought the Cape Florida property from the Deering estate. His offer to donate the lighthouse and ten acres (four hectares) of land around it to the National Park Service was not accepted.

In 1950, the Dade County Planning Board announced a plan to build a highway connecting Key Biscayne with the Overseas Highway on Key Largo. The project envisioned bridges connecting artificial islands, to be built on the Safety Valve and existing small keys to Elliott Key and on to Key Largo. Áleman was expected to donate the right-of-way for a road running down the middle of the island to the first bridge at Cape Florida. With the prospect of a major highway passing through his property, Áleman rushed to prepare it for development: he had it completely cleared, leveled and filled in. A seawall was constructed along the western (Biscayne Bay) side of the Cape Florida property.

Áleman died in 1951, and the County soon backed down from its road and bridge plan. His widow, Elena Santeiro Garcia, added to her Cape Florida property by buying an ocean-to-bay strip that had been part of the Matheson property. It included a canal dug by William Matheson in the 1920s, extending from the bay across most of the island. The land north of the canal was developed as part of the present-day Village of Key Biscayne. Garcia sold the Cape Florida property in 1957 for US$9.5 million, but the buyer defaulted and died the next year. Garcia sold the property again, for US$13 million. Development started on a model community&#x27; of luxury homes and resort properties. By 1962 the new developers were in financial trouble, and the property reverted again to Garcia in 1963.

Dade County began considering purchase of around the Cape Florida lighthouse for a park in 1964. Bill Baggs, editor of &quot;The Miami News&quot;, campaigned for all the Cape Florida property to be preserved in a park. U.S. Interior Secretary Stewart Udall inspected the property and recommended that it be preserved, although not with Federal funds.

In 1966, Baggs brokered a deal between Elena Santeiro Garcia and the state of Florida, in which Florida bought the property for US$8.5 million, of which US$2.3 million came from the U.S. government. This land was named the Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park, and opened January 1, 1967. In 2004 a sign was installed to commemorate the site as part of the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Trail, for the Black Seminoles who escaped to the Bahamas.

<text>Kemi Sámi was a Sámi language that was originally spoken in the southernmost district of Finnish Lapland as far south as the Sámi siidas around Kuusamo.

A complex of local variants which had a distinct identity from other Sámi dialects, but existed in a linguistic continuum between Inari Sámi and Skolt Sámi (some Kemi groups sounded more like Inari, and some more like Skolt, due to geographic proximity).

Extinct now for over 100 years, few written examples of Kemi Sámi survive. Johannes Schefferus&#x27;s &quot;Lapponia&quot; from 1673 contains two yoik poems by the Kemi Sámi Olof (Mattsson) Sirma, &quot;Guldnasas&quot; and &quot;Moarsi favrrot&quot;. A short vocabulary was written by the Finnish priest Jacob Fellman in 1829 after he visited the villages of Salla (Kuolajärvi until 1936) and Sompio.

== Sample texts ==
The following translation of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer still survives, recorded in the Sompio dialect:

Lord&#x27;s Prayer, village of Sompio (Sodankylä)
:

:

This is Sirma&#x27;s first poem, &quot;Guldnasas&quot;, a Sámi love story which he sang to spur on his reindeer so that they will run faster:


This is Sirma&#x27;s second poem, &quot;Moarsi favrrot&quot;, the one he sang when he was far away from his love to prize her beauty.

<doc id="567792" wikidata="Q63481" url="?curid=567792" title="GIGN">
<text>The GIGN ( ; ) is the elite police tactical unit of the French National Gendarmerie. Among its missions are counterterrorism, hostage rescue, surveillance of national threats, protection of government officials, critical site protection (such as French embassies in war-torn countries), and targeting organized crime.

Established in 1973 and becoming operational in 1974, the GIGN was initially created as a relatively small tactical unit specialized in sensitive hostage situations, but has since grown into a larger force with expanded responsibilities and capabilities. It is now composed of nearly 1,000 operators: around 400 operators based in Satory, near Versailles in the Paris area and approximately 600 operators in fourteen regional GIGN branches called AGIGNs (), located in metropolitan France or in the French overseas territories. The unit shares jurisdiction of French sovereign territory with the special response units of the National Police, and its training centre is located in Beynes.

Although most of its operations take place in France, the GIGN (as a component of the French Armed Forces) can operate anywhere in the world. Many of its missions are secret, and GIGN operators are not allowed to be publicly photographed. Since its formation, the GIGN has been involved in over 1,800 missions and has also rescued more than 600 hostages, making it one of the most experienced counter-terrorism units in the world.

In December 1994, the GIGN rose to worldwide prominence after its operatives successfully stormed Air France Flight 8969, which had been hijacked by the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria at Marseille Provence Airport; all four hijackers were killed in the assault.

==History==
GIGN was formed in , near Paris, in 1973, shortly after the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics and other less-known incidents in France resulted in a need for dedicated counterterrorist units in Europe. Initially named ECRI ( or Regional Commando Intervention Team), it became operational in March 1974, under the command of then-lieutenant , and executed its first mission ten days later. Another unit, named GIGN, was created simultaneously within the Mobile Gendarmerie parachute squadron in in southwest France, but the two units were merged under &#x27;s command in 1976, and adopted the GIGN designation. GIGNs initial complement was 15, later increased to 32 in 1976, 78 by 1986, and 120 by 2005. GIGN moved to in 1982.

In 1984, it became a part of a larger organisation called GSIGN (), together with EPIGN (), GSPR (), the Presidential Security group and GISA (), a specialized training center.

On 1 September 2007, a major reorganization took place. GSIGN was disbanded and replaced by a new unit also named GIGN. The former GSIGN components (the original GIGN, EPIGN, GSPR and GISA) became &quot;forces&quot; of the new GIGN which now reached a total complement of 380 operators.

The change from GSIGN to the new GIGN, an organization reporting directly to the Director-general of the Gendarmerie, was not a simple name swap. It was done in order to reinforce command and control functions; provide better integration through common selection, common training and stronger support; and improve the unit&#x27;s capability to handle complex situations such as mass hostage-takings similar to the Beslan school siege.

In 2009, the Gendarmerie, while remaining part of the French Armed Forces, was attached to the Ministry of the Interior, which already supervised the National Police. The respective areas of responsibility of each force did not change however, as the Police already had primary responsibility for major cities and large urban areas, while the Gendarmerie was in charge of smaller towns and rural areas (in addition to its specific military missions). Under the new command structure, GIGN gendarmes can still be engaged in operations outside of France due to their military status.

In January 2015, GIGN was engaged for the very first time simultaneously with RAID, the National Police tactical unit, during the January 2015 Île-de-France attacks.

On 1 August 2021, the 14 regional GIGN branches were fully integrated in the group&#x27;s organization as part of a new &quot;Force Antennes&quot;. Prior to this reorganization, these regional branches, established in 2004, had been administratively attached to the seven domestic &quot;Zonal Gendarmerie Regions&quot; for seven of them and to the Overseas Gendarmerie Command () for the remaining seven but they were independent units that only came under GIGN operational control when a crisis occurred. Sometimes referred to as &quot;GIGN 3.0&quot;, the new organization also emphasizes the group&#x27;s role in training and in operational support.&lt;ref name=&quot;arrêté 26/07/2021&quot;&gt; Ministerial decree of 26 July 2021. Arrêté du 26 juillet 2021 relatif aux attributions et à l&#x27;organisation du groupe d&#x27;intervention de la gendarmerie nationale NOR : INTJ2120405A https://media.interieur.gouv.fr/bomi/BOMI2021-8-2/textes/I40_20210726_INTJ2120405A.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A new common insignia was adopted as a result of the 2021 reorganization. Shaped as a shield, it worn on the left sleeve by every GIGN gendarme. A circular badge is worn on the right sleeve: the traditional round GIGN patch for Satory-based operators and a different patch for members of the AGIGNs. The AGIGN patch replaces the parachute with a thunderbolt, as AGIGNs are not parachute units.

Since its creation, the group has taken part in over 1,800 operations, rescued over 600 hostages and arrested over 1500 suspects, losing four members killed in action and ten in training. Three of the four fatalities in action were sustained when dealing with armed deranged persons. The fourth one occurred during an operation against illegal gold-mining in French Guiana in March 2023.

==Structure==

GIGN is currently organized in four &quot;forces&quot;, a &quot;détachement&quot;, an Engineering and Support division, a National Training Center for Specialized Intervention and a Human Resources bureau, under two headquarters (administrative and operational):
* Intervention Force ( – the original GIGN): Approximately 100 operators, serving as GIGN&#x27;s main assault unit. It is divided into four &quot;sections&quot; (platoons), two of which are on alert at all times. These &quot;sections&quot; are further divided into individual teams of operators. Two of the intervention &quot;sections&quot; specialize in high altitude jumps; the other two specialize in diving.
* Observation &amp; Search Force (): Approximately 40 operators, specializing in reconnaissance in relation with judiciary police work, and counterterrorism. Formed from the EPIGN.
* Security &amp; Protection Force (): Approximately 65 operators, specializing in executive and sensitive site protection. Formed from the EPIGN.
* Regional Branches Force (): Headquarters for the fourteen regional GIGN branches.
* Gendarmerie Detachment of the GSPR Presidential Security Group (): Tasked with protecting the President of France. Originally a Gendarmerie unit, GSPR (&quot;Groupe de Sécurité de la Présidence de la République&quot;) is now jointly operated by the Gendarmerie and the National Police.
* Engineering and Support Division (): A support force with cells specializing in long-range sniping, breaching, assault engineering, special devices, and other specializations.
* National Training Center for Specialized Intervention (): Tasked with selection, training and retraining (called recycling) not only of GIGN operators, but also of selected Gendarmerie or foreign personnel.

Female gendarmes are admitted in all &quot;forces&quot;, but none have so far succeeded in joining the Intervention Force.

There are several tactical specialties in the group, including: long-range sniping, breaching, observation and reconnaissance, executive protection, freefall parachuting with HALO/HAHO jumps, diving, etc.

Helicopter support is provided by Gendarmerie helicopters and, for tactical deployment of large groups, by GIH (), a joint Army/Air Force special operations flight equipped with SA330 PUMA helicopters, based in nearby Villacoublay Air Base. GIH was established in 2006, and has also been tasked to support the National Police&#x27;s RAID unit since 2008.

The fourteen regional GIGN branches, initially known as PI2Gs () for the domestic units and GPIs () for the overseas units, were respectively redesignated as GIGN branches in April and July 2016 and fully integrated into GIGN in 2021. As of 2021, the seven metropolitan GIGN branches are located in Caen, Dijon, Nantes, Orange, Reims, Toulouse and Tours, while the seven overseas branches are based in Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, Réunion, Mayotte, French Polynesia and New Caledonia. The twenty nuclear protection units, called PSPGs (), located on site at each one of the French nuclear power plants, are not a part of GIGN, but operate under its operational control.

Coordination between GIGN and RAID, the National Police&#x27;s tactical unit, is handled by a joint organization called Ucofi ( or Intervention Forces Coordination Unit). A &quot;leader/follower&quot; protocol has been established for use when both units need to be engaged jointly, leadership belonging to the unit operating in its primary areas of responsibility.

==Operations==
GIGN reports directly to the Director General of the Gendarmerie Nationale (DGGN), i.e., the chief of staff of the Gendarmerie, who in turn reports directly to the Ministry of the Interior. The DGGN or his Deputy for Operations can take charge in a major crisis; however, most of the day-to-day missions are conducted in support of local units of the Departmental Gendarmerie. GIGN is also a member of the European ATLAS Network, an informal association consisting of the special police units of the 27 states of the European Union.

Known GIGN operations include:
* Rescue of 30 French pupils from a school bus captured by the &quot;Front de Libération de la Côte des Somalis&quot; in Loyada, Djibouti in 1976. GIGN snipers and French Foreign Legion troops killed the hostage-takers in an operation that was only partially successful, as two children were killed.
* Planning the rescue of diplomats from the French Embassy in San Salvador in 1979; the hostage-takers surrendered before the assault was conducted.
* Advising Saudi authorities during the Grand Mosque Seizure in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, in November and December 1979.
* Arrest of several Corsican terrorists of the National Liberation Front of Corsica at the Fesch Hostel in 1980.

GIGN was selected by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to organise hostage-rescue exercises aboard planes for the special forces of the other member states.

== Selection and training ==

Candidates undertake a one-week pre-selection screening followed by, for those accepted, a fourteen-month training program. Mental ability and self-control are important, in addition to physical strength. Similar to most special forces, the training is stressful with a high rate of failure, especially in the initial phase; only 7–8% of the volunteers complete the training process. AGIGN candidates undertake a one-week pre-selection screening followed by an eight-week training program.

GIGN training consists of:
* Weapon handling
* Combat shooting and marksmanship training
* Airborne courses, such as HALO or HAHO jumps, paragliding, and heliborne insertions
* Underwater combat, swimming, diving, and naval boarding
* Hand-to-hand combat training
* Undercover surveillance and stalking (investigative cases support)
* Infiltration and escape techniques
* Explosive ordnance disposal
* Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear device neutralization
* Survival and warfare in tropical, arctic, mountain and desert environments
* Diplomacy and negotiation skills

The GIGN trains alongside other counterterrorist units from NATO countries, including the American FBI HRT, British SAS, Australian SPS, German GSG 9, and Irish Garda ERU.

==Weapons and equipment==

GIGN uses a wide range of firearms and equipment, including:
* Sidearms:
** Pistols: Glock 17/19/26, SIG Sauer SP 2022
** Revolvers: Manurhin MR 73, Smith &amp; Wesson Model 686
* Submachine guns: HK MP5, HK MP7, FN P90, SIG MPX
* Shotguns: Remington Model 870, Franchi SPAS-12, Benelli M4
* Assault rifles: HK416, HK417, HK G36, SIG MCX, SIG SG 550 and variants, CZ BREN 2, FAMAS (ceremonially)
* Sniper rifles: Accuracy International Arctic Warfare in .308 and .338, Accuracy International AXSR, PGM Hécate II in 12.7x99mm
* Ballistic shields
* Various types of armored vehicles, both civilian-style SUVs and dedicated armoured personnel carriers, some with assault ladders installed on the roof of the vehicle
* Various types of helicopter

== Motto and values ==
* Until 2014: (&quot;To save lives without regard to one&#x27;s own&quot;)
* Since 2014: (&quot;A commitment for life&quot;)

Although GIGN, as part of the French military, has been deployed to external combat zones, it is primarily centered in France, engaging in peacetime operations as a special police force. Respect for human life, combined with fire discipline, has always been taught to group members since its inception. Each new member is traditionally issued a six-shot revolver as a reminder of these values.

On 9 December 2011, French Defense Minister Gérard Longuet, awarded the Cross for Military Valour to GIGN for its participation in operation Harmattan in Libya. On 31 July 2013, GIGN was awarded a second Cross for Military Valour for its participation in the War in Afghanistan.

On 15 June 2015, the unit received the Medal for internal security. As GIGN was awarded the Cross for Military Valour twice, members of the group are officially allowed to wear the fourragère.

== In popular culture ==

GIGN has been featured in dozens of media works, including films, television shows, novels, video games, and strip cartoons, typically working alongside other international counterterrorist units. They have also been the focus of several works, including:
*&quot;L&#x27;Assaut&quot;, a 2010 French film about the Air France Flight 8969 hijacking. It was done with the collaboration and the advice of GIGN. There are a few fictional personal stories intertwined with the operation, but otherwise, the film is accurate to reports of the operation.
*&quot;L&#x27;Ordre et la Morale&quot; (&quot;Rebellion&quot;), a 2011 film depicting the controversial 1988 Ouvéa cave hostage taking in New Caledonia, from the perspective of then-GIGN leader Philippe Legorjus. Even though he played a major role in the negotiations, and participated in the first part of the assault, Legorjus&#x27; leadership during and after the operation was contested, and he left GIGN a few months later.
*&quot;L&#x27;intervention&quot; (&quot;15 Minutes of War&quot;), a 2019 French-Belgian war film &quot;very&quot; loosely based on GIGN&#x27;s 1976 hostage rescue of school children in Djibouti.

<doc id="567809" wikidata="Q1317534" url="?curid=567809" title="Goaltender">
<text>In ice hockey, the goaltender (commonly referred to as the goalie) is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their own team&#x27;s net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender mostly plays in or near the area in front of the net, called the &quot;goal crease&quot; (often referred to simply as &quot; the crease&quot;). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In the modern age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment to protect the body from direct impact.

Goaltenders are one of the most important players on the ice, as their performance may greatly impact the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to showcase a goaltender&#x27;s pure skill, or lack thereof. No more than one goaltender per team is permitted to be on the ice at any given time. The rules do not oblige the use of a goaltender and so teams may instead opt to play with an extra skater. However the defensive disadvantage that follows means that this strategy is normally used purely as a desperation maneuver when needing to score late in a game. It may also be used when there is a delayed penalty (should the team to be short-handed touch the puck the play will stop as the penalty is called).

The goaltender is also known as the &quot;goalie,&quot; &quot;goaler,&quot; &quot;goalkeeper,&quot; &quot;net minder&quot;, &quot;tendy,&quot; and &quot;tender&quot; by those involved in the hockey community. In the early days of the sport, the term was spelled with a hyphen as &quot;goal-tender.&quot; The art of playing the position is called &quot;goaltending&quot; and there are coaches, usually called the &quot;goalie coach&quot; who specialize exclusively in working with goaltenders. The variation goalie is typically used for items associated with the position, such as &quot;goalie stick&quot; and &quot;goalie pads&quot;.

==Goaltenders in ice hockey==
===Roster===
Goaltenders are a specialized position in ice hockey; at higher levels in the game, no goaltenders play other positions and no other players play goaltender. At minor levels and recreational games, goaltenders do occasionally switch with others players who have been taught goaltending; however, most recreational hockey rules are now forbidding position swapping due to an increase in injuries.

A typical ice hockey team has two or three goaltenders on its roster. Most teams typically have a starting goaltender who plays the majority of the regular season games and all of the playoffs, with the backup goaltender only stepping in if the starter is pulled or injured, or in cases where the schedule is too heavy for one goaltender to play every game.

Professional hockey leagues at all levels require each team have a list of &quot;emergency&quot; goaltenders. The list provides goaltender options for both the home and visiting teams. These goaltenders are to be called to a game if a team does not have two goaltenders to start the game, most often in the ECHL where a goaltender can be called up to the American Hockey League (AHL) that afternoon and the team is unable to sign a backup or the scheduled backup is unable to make the game on time after a callup. An &quot;emergency&quot; goaltender may also be called if both roster goaltenders are injured in the same game.

====Goalie tandem====
Some teams have used a goaltender tandem where two goaltenders split the regular season playing duties, though often one of them is considered the number one goaltender who gets the start in the playoffs. An example is the 1982–83 New York Islanders with Billy Smith and Roland Melanson; Melanson was named to the NHL second All-Star team for his regular season play while Smith won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoff MVP and both players shared the William M. Jennings Trophy for fewest goals allowed. Another instance is the Edmonton Oilers&#x27; Andy Moog and Grant Fuhr; both of them earned All-Star Game appearances for the regular season play, with Moog being the starter in the 1983 playoffs and Fuhr for the 1984 playoffs (although Moog started Game 4 and 5 of the 1984 Stanley Cup Finals due to Fuhr&#x27;s injury) and subsequent postseasons.

The Toronto Maple Leafs had Terry Sawchuk and Johnny Bower share goaltending duties in the regular season and games, playoffs, winning the 1964–65 Vezina Trophy (shared) and the 1967 Stanley Cup. The 1996–97 Philadelphia Flyers&#x27; Ron Hextall and Garth Snow alternated in the playoffs; Snow started nine of the ten games during the first two rounds, but Hextall took over in game two of Conference Finals and remained the starting goaltender for the remainder of the playoffs, though Snow started for game two of the Stanley Cup Finals.

===Privileges===
The goaltender has special privileges and training that other players do not. They wear special goaltending equipment that is different from that worn by other players and is subject to specific regulations. Goaltenders may use any part of their bodies to block shots. The goaltender may legally hold (or freeze) the puck with their hands to cause a stoppage of play. If a player from the other team hits the goaltender without making an attempt to get out of their way, the offending player may be penalized. In some leagues (including the NHL), if a goaltender&#x27;s stick breaks, they can continue playing with a broken stick until the play is stopped, unlike other players who must drop any broken sticks immediately.

The goaltender normally plays in or near the &quot;goal crease&quot; the entire game, an area marked in front of the net, unlike the other positions where players are on ice for shifts and make frequent line changes. Attackers cannot make contact with the goaltender within the crease, as this interferes with the goaltender&#x27;s ability to make saves. However, attackers may still enter the crease if they have the opportunity to make a play on a loose puck.

Additionally, if a goaltender acts in such a way that would cause a normal player to be given a penalty, such as slashing or tripping another player, the goaltender cannot be sent to the penalty box. Instead, one of the goaltender&#x27;s teammates who was on the ice at the time of the infraction is sent to the penalty box in their place; the goaltender will still be credited with the penalty minutes on the scoresheet. However, if the goaltender receives a game misconduct or match penalty, they must immediately leave the ice and be replaced by another goaltender. In such cases, an unpenalized player is required to serve any minutes assessed to the ejected player in the penalty box; this holds true for all hockey positions in the event a player is ejected from the game.

Goaltenders are often pulled if they have allowed several goals in a short period of time, whether they were at fault for the surrendered goals or not. Usually, a substituted goaltender does not return for the rest of the game. During a game in 1995, future Hall-of-Famer Patrick Roy, playing for the Montreal Canadiens at the time, was infamously kept in net by then-head coach Mario Tremblay. Roy perceived this as a means of &quot;humiliation,&quot; as he had allowed nine goals on 26 shots to that point, and the crowd in Montreal sarcastically applauded him after making an easy save. Tremblay would finally pull Roy midway through the second period; as he was walking to the locker room, Roy famously leaned toward Canadiens then-president Ronald Corey and told him that it would be Roy&#x27;s &quot;last game in Montreal.&quot; The Canadiens would ultimately lose the game 11-1; Roy was traded to the Colorado Avalanche four days later.

Fifteen goaltenders have scored a goal in National Hockey League (NHL) games; combined, NHL goaltenders have scored 18 total goals. A goaltender can score by either shooting the puck into the net directly, or being awarded the goal as the last player on their team to touch the puck if an opponent scores an &quot;own goal&quot;. A goal scored by shooting the puck is particularly challenging, as the goaltender has to aim for a six-foot-wide net that is close to 180 feet away while avoiding hitting opposing players or turning the puck over; in cases of own goals, combining the circumstance of an own goal itself with the goaltender having been the last player to touch the puck renders own goals a very rare occurrence. Of the eighteen goals, eleven were scored by shooting the puck and seven were the result of own goals. As of 2023, Ron Hextall and Martin Brodeur are the only goaltenders in NHL history to be credited with multiple goals; Hextall remains the only NHL goaltender to have scored multiple goals via directly shooting the puck. Brodeur is the only goaltender to be credited with three goals, and is the only NHL goaltender to have been credited with a game-winning goal.

A hockey team is not technically required to use a goaltender. At any time in any game, a team may remove its goaltender from the ice in favor of an extra attacker (a process colloquially known as &quot;pulling the goalie&quot;). Using an extra attacker is typically intended to overwhelm the opposing team&#x27;s defense, and unlike during a power play, the defense cannot legally ice the puck if they are not already shorthanded due to a penalty (if the team on defense is serving a penalty, then the usual icing rules prevail, although in this case the team pulling the goaltender will have the additional advantage of having at least two more skaters on the ice). This puts the team without a goaltender at a significant advantage on offense. However, leaving the net untended creates the opportunity for an opposing team to score an empty net goal from virtually anywhere on the ice (even in the case of attempts that may cause the opponent to be called for icing if they miss the net, any goals still count). Obviously, if the opposing team does manage to advance the puck out of their own defensive zone, it becomes much easier to score an empty net goal. Thus, pulling the goalie is often used as an end-of-game desperation measure by losing teams, done in an attempt to quickly score a tying goal with the aid of a sixth attacker. A team may also pull their goalie in the event of a delayed penalty.

NHL rules strongly encourage that teams use goaltenders in overtime; if a team opts for the extra attacker in overtime and an empty-net goal is scored, the game is credited as a regulation loss instead of an overtime loss (as an overtime loss earns one standings point, as opposed to two for a win of any sort), and the team pulling the goalie forfeit the point earned for going to overtime. Teams thus typically forgo using a goaltender only in situations where they are trailing by one or two goals with only a short time (typically less than four minutes) left in the game and have possession of the puck in their opponent&#x27;s defensive zone. Prior to the introduction of the shootout, NHL teams occasionally pulled goalies in overtime during rare late season situations where the team pulling its goaltender needed two points to remain in playoff contention or home-ice advantage. The shootout has essentially ended this practice, since teams are statistically much more likely to win a shootout as opposed to winning with an empty net in overtime. Even with the introduction of the shootout to resolve games tied after overtime, it is still theoretically possible for a situation to arise where it may be advisable for an NHL team to pull a goaltender late in the regular season when tied late in regulation, since the statistics &quot;regulation wins&quot; followed by &quot;regulation and overtime wins&quot; are the top two criteria to break ties in the standings; as of , no such situation has occurred since the adoption of the shootout. However, as seen in the 2023-24 ECHL season, the Orlando Solar Bears were tied against the Reading Royals, 0-0, with less than two minutes in the final game of the regular season. The Solar Bears and South Carolina Stingrays were tied in points with the Solar Bears needing a win in either regulation or overtime to clinch the final South Division playoff berth, while the Stingrays led the Florida Everblades, 3-2, late in the third period. Orlando pulled their goaltender with a minute remaining in order to attempt gaining the two points necessary to clinch the final berth, and scored to take the position by one point. 

The rules of the IIHF, NHL and Hockey Canada do not permit goaltenders to be designated as on-ice captains, because of the logistical challenge of having the goaltender relay rules discussions between referees and coaches and then return to the crease. The Vancouver Canucks did name goaltender Roberto Luongo as their team captain during the 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons, but due to NHL rules, he did not serve as the &quot;official&quot; on-ice captain. In the NCAA, there is no position-based restriction on the team captain.

Out of the five positions on the rink, goaltenders are frequently candidates for the Conn Smythe Trophy, awarded to the MVP of the Stanley Cup Playoffs; goaltenders have won this honor in four of the last ten playoffs. Patrick Roy has won a record three times, and four goaltenders have won the Conn Smythe Trophy as part of the losing team in the Finals.

===Saves===

When a goaltender either blocks or stops a shot from going into their goal net, that action is called a save. Goaltenders often use a particular style, but in general they make saves any way they can: catching the puck with their glove hand, deflecting the shot with their stick, blocking it with their leg pads or blocker or another part of their body, or collapsing to butterfly position to block any low shot coming, especially in close proximity. After making a save, the goaltender attempts to control the rebound to avoid a goal scored by an opposing player when the goaltender is out of position (&#x27;scoring on a rebound&#x27;), or to allow the goaltender&#x27;s own team to get control of the puck. Goaltenders may catch or hold a puck shot at the net to better control how it re-enters play. If there is immediate pressure from the opposing team, a goaltender may choose to hold on to the puck (for a second or more, with judgment from the referee) to stop play for a face-off. If a goaltender holds on to the puck for too long without any pressure they may be subject to a 2-minute delay of game penalty. Recently, in the NHL and AHL, goaltenders have been restricted as to where they can play the puck behind the net.

Goaltender equipment, techniques and skills have evolved over the years, dramatically improving their effectiveness altering the dynamics of the game. Goaltenders have added masks, longer pads and are physically bigger. Ken Dryden has called for bigger nets to counter their effectiveness.

===Glossary and techniques===
* Angle play: The method where, by positioning oneself in a direct line between the puck (not the shooter) and the net, a goaltender covers more of the net than he would otherwise be able to, and often &quot;skulling&quot; slowly, directly towards and closing on the opposing shooter to block more of the net. Two of the most notable angle goaltenders in the 1970s were Gilles Gilbert and Bernie Parent.
*Blocker: The blocker is a rectangular piece of equipment with a glove to hold the stick. The blocker is predominantly worn on the dominant hand of the goaltender. The blocker protects the wrist area and can be used to direct shots away from the net. The blocker should be positioned at one&#x27;s side, and at a height which allows the goaltender&#x27;s stick to remain flat on the ice while in their ready stance.
*Trapper: Often simply referred to as the goalie&#x27;s &quot;glove,&quot; the goalie&#x27;s catching glove was originally shaped in the same fashion as a baseball glove. It has evolved into a highly specific piece of equipment that is designed specifically for catching the puck. Some of the more significant changes are the use of a &quot;string mesh&quot; in the pocket of the trapper and the substantial palm and wrist protection. The pocket is the area between the thumb and first finger of the glove and is where most goaltenders try to catch the puck; catching in the pocket reduces the chance of a rebound falling out of the glove. The trapper must not be more than 18 inches across. The trapper can be held in a variety of positions depending upon the individual goaltender, but the trend among younger goaltenders is to hold the glove with the palm facing towards the shooter, instead of the &quot;shake hands&quot; position that was popular previously. The &quot;Cheater&quot; portion of the glove is the portion of the glove on the outside area of the thumb and the part that covers the wrist of the goaltender.
* Butterfly save: A save utilizing the butterfly technique in which the goaltender drives their knees down to the ice and splays their legs out to the sides while keeping their stick on the ice between their legs to cover the five-hole with their hands on either side of their body above each leg pad. For most modern goaltenders, the butterfly is the default technique around which the rest of their game is built as it theoretically stops any shots along the ice and provides optimal net-coverage.
* Butterfly slide: A technique in which the goaltender moves laterally by pushing with one leg and sliding with the other leg&#x27;s knee on the ice. Once the push has been completed, the pushing leg&#x27;s knee is brought back down to the ice to resume the butterfly position for the remainder of the slide. This technique allows for lateral movement while minimizing opportunities for pucks to slide under the goaltender by keeping at least one leg pad flat on the ice throughout.
* Hasek roll: The Hasek roll is a desperation maneuver named after Czech goaltender Dominik Hašek. In the stacked pad stance the lower part of the net is protected very well, but the upper third is completely open. In a last-ditch effort to block an incoming high shot the goaltender can roll around his upper back, flailing his pads through the air and stacking them on the other side. If the timing is right the goalie might get his leg up just in time to make the save.

* Holes one through five: When a goaltender stands in the net in the ready position, there are seven open areas that the goalie must cover. They are:
# Glove side, high: this area is defined by the goaltender&#x27;s arm and catcher on the bottom, mask on the inside, and the post and top of the goal on the outside.
# Glove side, low: this area is defined by the goaltender&#x27;s arm and catcher on the top, the ice on the bottom, and the outside post of the goal. During a butterfly-style save, this area is closed off completely and the catcher is typically stacked on top of the leg pad as the leg is extended to cover the post.
# Stick side, high: this area is defined by the goal post, top of the goal, and the goalie&#x27;s arm and blocker. The top half of the goaltender&#x27;s stick is held in this area, but is not commonly used for stopping the puck.
# Stick side, low: this area is the lower half of the stick side, defined by the blocker and arm, the ice, and the outer post of the goal. During a butterfly save this area is also covered by the leg pad with the blocker stacked on top to protect against low shots. When a goaltender is standing, the paddle of their stick is used to cover this area and to deflect the puck away from the net.
# &#x27;Five Hole&#x27;: the fifth and final area is between the goalie&#x27;s leg pads and skates. This area is protected by the blade of the stick at all times, and is closed up by the upper leg pads when the goalie is in the butterfly position.
# &#x27;Six and Seven Hole&#x27;: the six and seven holes are relatively new terms to identify the areas under either armpit of the goalie. Goaltenders who hold their trapper high or blocker further out to the side of their body are said to have six and seven holes.
# &#x27;Six Hole (slang)&#x27;: The &quot;six hole&quot; is also used as a slang term used when a save is made, but the puck goes into the net, resulting in a goal. The term is used when the goalie is unsure how the puck made it past them.

* Leg pads: Worn on the goaltender&#x27;s legs to both protect the legs and help stop shots. Current NHL Rules have reduced leg pad width to ; the overall height is restricted based upon an individual proportionally. The leg pads generally come to about three inches above the knee. Due to the popularity of the butterfly style, modern leg pads are now built with a &#x27;landing surface&#x27; that sits flat on the ice during the butterfly technique and allows the &#x27;face&#x27; of the pad to face outward and offer the most protection to the goalie while presenting the largest blocking surface possible to the shooter.
* (Leg) kick save: Any save made with the leg pad. A kick save often refers to a save in which the goaltender kicks their leg outward to block the puck and/or to more effectively redirect the puck to a desired location.
* Lie: The angle created between the handle (paddle) of a goaltender&#x27;s stick and the blade. The higher the lie, the closer the stick resembles the capital letter &quot;L&quot;. A higher lie number of 15+ is traditionally for goaltenders who tend to stand up more in their stance; A lower lie number of 11 or 12 is for goaltenders who play with a more butterfly stance down on the ice more often.
*Mask: The protective headgear worn by goaltenders. The first goaltender to wear a mask in the National Hockey League was Clint Benedict in 1930 who wore a crude form made of leather. In November 1959, Jacques Plante, wore a self-made fiberglass mask after taking a New York Rangers shot to the face. Following his lead, goaltenders around the world began to don protective headgear, which is now a requirement. Masks have evolved from the flush style introduced by Plante, to the player&#x27;s helmet/special &quot;birdcage&quot; style best associated with Vladislav Tretiak and Chris Osgood, to the modern hybrid helmet, made of advanced materials such as carbon fiber or Kevlar, increasing in safety as time went on. Especially at higher levels of hockey, many goaltenders have their masks painted to represent their team&#x27;s colors/imagery, landmarks in the city they play in or personal interests/nicknames. Examples of this include Mike Richter&#x27;s Statue of Liberty mask, Ed Belfour&#x27;s Eagle on his mask (Eddie the Eagle nickname), Ryan Miller featuring the words &quot;Matt Man&quot; on his masks in honor of his late cousin, and Craig Anderson honouring his father&#x27;s National Corvette Museum board service (as a former Corvette racer) by having a Chevrolet Corvette on his masks.
* Paddle: The thick part of the goaltender&#x27;s stick, not to be confused with the blade. The paddle has a maximum length of in the NHL. The blade is the part of the stick that should remain flat on the ice, as compared with the paddle.
* Paddle down: A type of stance by the goaltender when the play is coming from the corner to the front of the net and the puck carrier is carrying the puck in front of the net looking to score. Here the goaltender puts the stick down on the ground, parallel to the ice, with the leg farthest from the post down and the other up and ready to push. This works well against angled rushes or wrap arounds where the skater would normally out–skate the goalie. The skater does have the top part of the net to shoot at, but it is difficult to lift the puck over the goalie from up close. The paddle down stance is also effective against low passes from behind the net to players looking to score from the slot.
* Poke check: When the goaltender wants to poke the puck away from an opposing player, they quickly slides their hand up the stick, thrusting forward towards the puck. An improperly played poke check is a risky play; the goaltender may miss, and the puck-carrier will be left with an unguarded net. In tight situations, a quick, hard jab could be used.
* Pro-fly: This style of play is derived from the butterfly style of play, although most will argue that this is nothing more than a marketing term. Current leg pad design allows for the full face of the pad to be perpendicular to the ice, maximizing blocking area. This is also called &quot;flaring the pad&quot;, almost all modern goaltenders play this style. The stance is very wide and low to maximize the amount of body blocking the net. Many of today&#x27;s great goaltenders have adopted this technique. This forces the shooter to get the puck off the ice to score. The con of this stance is that it is very hard to move quickly. The more efficient users of this style include Henrik Lundqvist of the New York Rangers, Jonathan Quick of the Los Angeles Kings, and Roberto Luongo of the Florida Panthers. This is still considered a butterfly motion, as the mechanics of making the save are the same, however it is the design of the leg pad that achieves this rotation more than anything.
* Screen shot: Screen shots are blind shots, in which the goalie can not find the location of the puck. Goalies should never anticipate or guess when and where the puck will hit. In the screen shot, another player (usually an opponent, but sometimes the goaltender&#x27;s own teammate) stands between the shooter and the goaltender, obscuring the goaltender&#x27;s vision of the shot. On a screen shot, the goaltender must do everything possible to try to see the shot, as dropping to the butterfly stance and thrusting their glove out at the sound of a shot is not the best idea in the modern game. Some goalies, such as Ed Belfour or Ron Hextall, went as far as (illegally) punching players in the head or slashing their legs.
* Shuffle: This may refer two different techniques: A standing shuffle is a technique in which a goaltender, in a standing position, pushes with one skate and slides with the other while keeping both skates facing forward to make small lateral movements. A butterfly shuffle is a technique in which a goaltender in the butterfly position makes small pushes using their knees to make very small lateral movements without compromising the butterfly&#x27;s net-coverage.
* Skate save: A save made with the goaltender&#x27;s skate. The goaltender decides which direction the rebound should travel in, and turns their skate in that direction. Then, bending the other leg, they push towards the puck with the off leg, as the bent knee drops to the ice. This move is rarely used since the butterfly method has become popular. A skate save&#x27;s effectiveness is more limited because of the difficulty in directing a puck compared with using a stick, a blocker, or the pad.
* Stacked Pad Slide: When a goaltender is on the angle, often a sudden pass close to the net will leave the net relatively unguarded. Stacking the pads is a desperation move in which the goaltender slides feet-first, with legs together (and consequently, &quot;stacked&quot;), across the crease, attempting to cover as much space as possible.
* Stance: In a proper stance, the goaltender has the weight on the balls of their feet, the trapper and blocker just above knee-height and slightly out in front so they can be seen in the goalies peripheral vision, and the stick flat on the ice. Stance should also be conformed to the goaltender&#x27;s style and comfort.
* Stick: The stick, held by the goaltender in their blocker hand, the blade of the stick should remain flat on the ice. Keep notice of the lie on a new stick. A high lie will force a goaltender to play on their heels, offsetting balance, while a low lie places a goaltender lower to the ice, and may affect high saves.
* Stick save: A save made with the goaltender&#x27;s stick. On stick saves, the goaltender should not keep a tight grip on the stick, instead allowing the shot&#x27;s momentum to push the stick back into the skates/pads, cushioning the blow.
* Stood on his head: This is a term to describe an outstanding performance by an ice hockey goaltender in a short period of time. Often when a goalie lets out a rebound, the opposition returns the shot quickly, and the goalie has to make a quick save. A goalie often falls on their side and &quot;stacks the pads&quot; and appears to nearly stand on their head. The term may have been derived after NHL President Frank Calder, alluding to the 1918 rules change that permitted goalies to leave their feet to make a save, remarked, &quot;As far as I am concerned, they can stand on their head(s).&quot;
* Skulling: Skulling is a method of moving inward and outward from the goal crease, often used in &quot;angle play&quot;. Most often used in setting up prior to the puck entering their zone, especially to &quot;cut down the angle.&quot; This technique is accomplished by pointing both toe&#x27;s of one&#x27;s skates inward or outward and allowing the skates to separate, then pulling one&#x27;s skates back together to stop, all without the skates leaving the ice surface. Pointing one&#x27;s toes inward results in backward movement and pointing them outward results in forward movement. This can also be referred to as telescoping or bubbling.
* T-push: A technique used by goaltenders to move larger distances laterally than can be accomplished by shuffling. The goaltender directs one skate in the desired direction of travel, rotating their body if required, and then uses the other skate to push themselves in that direction. The name &quot;T-push&quot; comes from the how, during the push, the skates are perpendicular to one another forming a T shape.

===Playing styles===
====Stand-up style====
The oldest playing style is the stand-up style. In this style, goaltenders are to stop the puck from a standing position, not going down. The goaltenders may bend over to stop the puck with their upper body or may kick the puck. Such saves made by kicking are known as kick saves or skate saves. They may also simply use their stick to stop it, known as a stick save. This was the style seen in the early NHL and was most commonly used up until the early 60s. One of the more notable goaltenders who was last seen using stand up was Bill Ranford, but most of the goaltenders from earlier decades such as Jacques Plante were considered pure stand up goaltenders.

As the name suggests, the &quot;stand-up style&quot; refers to a style of goaltending in which the goaltender makes the majority of the saves standing up. This style is not as popular in the modern era, with the majority of contemporary goaltenders switching to the butterfly style and the hybrid style. The stand-up style is in contrast to the butterfly style, where goaltenders protect the net against incoming shots by dropping to their knees and shifting their legs out.

The advantage of the stand-up style is in the continued mobility of the goaltender mid save. While standing, a stand-up goaltender can remain square to the puck and adjust his positioning to ensure that he is covering as much of the net as possible at all times. The goaltender is also in a better position to stop pucks that are headed towards the upper part of the net.

The main disadvantage of the stand-up style, however, is a susceptibility to shots travelling along the bottom half of the net. A larger percentage of shots occur in the bottom portion of the net, and a goaltender utilizing the butterfly will cover a larger portion of that area. If there is a screen, however, a stand-up goaltender is generally in a better position to see the slapshot.

====Butterfly style====
Another style is the &quot;Butterfly&quot;, where goaltenders go down on both pads with their toes pointing outwards and the tops of their pads meeting in the middle, thus closing up the five hole. This results in a &quot;wall&quot; of padding without any holes, lowering the chances of low angle shots getting in. These goaltenders rely on timing and position. Early innovators of this style were goaltending greats Glenn Hall and Tony Esposito who played during the 50s-60s and 70s-80s, respectively. Hall is credited to be among the first to use this style, and both he and Esposito had tremendous success with it. The most successful goaltender to adopt this style was Patrick Roy, who has 550 career wins in the NHL. This is the most widely used style in the NHL today. &quot;Butterfly&quot; goaltenders have developed methods of sliding in the &quot;Butterfly&quot; position in order to move around fast in one-timer situations. As pad size increased, it became a more notable style of goaltending and is still evolving.

====Hybrid style====
This style of goaltending is a combination of both stand-up and butterfly style, where the goaltender primarily relies on reaction, save selection, and positioning to make saves. Hybrid goaltenders will usually control rebounds well, deflect low shots with their sticks, will utilize the butterfly, and are generally not as predictable as goaltenders who rely heavily on the butterfly as a save selection. Most players are not pure stand-up or butterfly, but simply tend to prefer stand-up or butterfly over the other. If a player does not have any preferences, he is considered a hybrid goaltender. All modern NHL goaltenders generally use some form of this style. Some goaltenders who do this effectively are Ryan Miller, Jaroslav Halák, Jimmy Howard, Tuukka Rask, Carey Price and formerly Evgeni Nabokov and Martin Brodeur.

===Empty net situations===
Normally, the goaltender plays in or near the goal crease the entire game. However, teams may legally &quot;pull the goalie&quot; by substituting in a normal skater and taking the goaltender off the ice. A team temporarily playing with no goaltender is said to be playing with an &quot;empty net&quot;. This gives the team an extra attacker, but at significant risk—if the opposing team gains control of the puck, they may easily score a goal. However, shooters that attempt to score on an empty net from the opposite side of the red line face getting called for icing the puck if they miss the net. There are two common situations where a goaltender is generally pulled, as well as two less common situations:

:1. The opposing team has a delayed penalty coming against them
::The offended team, if in control of the puck, will pull their goaltender for an extra man. This is safe since as soon as a player on the team to be penalized touches the puck, the whistle is called, so they cannot score on the empty net. This effectively increases the one-man disadvantage beyond the standard penalty time. It is possible, however, for a team to accidentally score on their own empty net.
:2. A team needs a goal in order to avoid losing (such as trailing in the remaining minute or two of a game)
::The 6 on 5 play advantage is very risky, as it is fairly certain that if the opposing team gets control of the puck they will be able to score on the empty net. Sometimes if a team is trailing in the last minutes of regulation, and has a power play advantage, they may pull the goaltender for a 6 on 4 or even 6 on 3 advantage.
:3. In the last few seconds of a period with a faceoff in the attacking zone
::Because the defending team would likely not have enough time to start an attack even if they win the faceoff, the attacking team may pull the goalie to have a short man advantage.
:4. In a tournament that takes goal differential into account, a team may pull the goalie with a significant amount of time left in an effort to create a more advantageous goal differential.
::If the team could be eliminated even if they win but could still advance with a loss based on goal differential, the team may decide it has nothing to lose by trying to score with a man advantage, similar to the second situation.
A goal scored in an empty net situation is not recorded as a shot faced or goal against on the personal stats of the goaltender who has left the ice.

===Back-up goaltender===
In professional ice hockey, the back-up goaltender fills an important team role. Although the back-up will spend most games sitting on the bench, the back-up must be prepared to play every game. A back-up may be forced into duty at any time to relieve the starting goaltender in the event of an injury or poor game performance. The back-up will also be called upon to start some games to give the starter the opportunity to rest from game-play during the season.

Most professional leagues require each home team to maintain a list of local non-professional goaltenders, available to either team, who can be used in the exceptional case that one or both of a team&#x27;s normal goaltenders are injured or unavailable (such as a player acquired in a trade or minor league call-up arriving late on short notice); such a goaltender who fulfills that role is known as an emergency back-up goaltender (EBUG). Similar rules are in place for the NHL&#x27;s minor leagues, where emergency goaltenders are used much more frequently. Those on a team&#x27;s emergency list are given free attendance to home games they are assigned and may also help out as a practice goalie. Emergency goalies are often called from nearby college teams, adult semi-pro/amateur leagues, or the home team&#x27;s own coaching/facilities staff. If activated for a game, most emergency goaltenders only dress to sit on the bench, as a team&#x27;s normal back-up takes over; only six emergency goalies (David Ayres, Scott Foster, Jorge Alves, Thomas Hodges, Matt Berlin, Jett Alexander) have ever seen recorded playing time in an NHL game. Emergency goalies who are activated sign either an amateur or professional tryout contract.

During the Stanley Cup playoffs, roster limits are relaxed and teams routinely recall minor league players (known as &quot;black aces&quot;) to act as depth, resulting in playoff EBUGs being minor league professionals rather than local amateurs.

==NHL goaltender awards==
* The Vezina Trophy is awarded each year by the NHL to the league&#x27;s most outstanding goaltender as voted on by the general managers of the league&#x27;s 32 teams, from 1981–82 NHL season and onwards.
* The William M. Jennings Trophy is awarded each year by the NHL to the goaltender(s) from the team that allowed the fewest goals during the regular season, from 1981–82 NHL season and onwards.
* The Roger Crozier Saving Grace Award was awarded from 1999–2000 to the 2006–07 seasons by the NHL to the goaltender with the best save percentage during the regular season.
* The Hart Memorial Trophy is awarded to the Most Valuable Player in the NHL.
* The Calder Memorial Trophy is awarded to the Rookie of the Year.
* The Ted Lindsay Award is awarded to the most outstanding player in the regular season as judged by the members of the NHL Players Association.

==Goaltenders credited with goals==
===NHL===
A goaltender scoring a goal in an NHL game is a very rare feat, having occurred only fifteen times in the history of the NHL, the first time occurring in 1979 after the league had been in existence for six decades. NHL rules forbid goaltenders from participating in play past the center line, so a goal by a goaltender is possible only under unusual circumstances. (If a goaltender does shoot the puck into the net from any location that is past the center line, the goal does not count.)

Eight of those fifteen goals resulted from the goaltender shooting into an empty net. The remaining seven goals were not actually shot into the net by the goaltender; rather the goaltender was awarded the goal because he was the last player on his team to touch the puck before the opposition scored on themselves. Martin Brodeur is the only NHL goaltender to be credited with three career goals (two in the regular season and one in the playoffs), Ron Hextall is the only goaltender who has scored two goals by shooting the puck into an empty net (once in the regular season and once in the playoffs). Damian Rhodes and José Théodore are the only goaltenders in NHL history to score a goal in which they also had a shutout game. Evgeni Nabokov of the San Jose Sharks was the first goaltender to score a power play goal.

<text>Wickwar is a village and civil parish in Gloucestershire, England, located between Yate and Charfield. At the 2021 census, the parish had a population of 2,083.

== History ==
Wickwar was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &#x27;Wichen&#x27;, from the Old English &quot;(aet) wicum&quot;, meaning &#x27;(at) the dwellings&#x27;. The manor was given to John la Warre by King John and was held by Roger la Warre in 1285, when it was referred to as &#x27;Warre Wyke&#x27;. Warre is a Norman family name which gave its name to Wickwar.

The village lay on the Old Saltway from Droitwich to Old Sodbury and Pucklechurch, and was developed in the 13th century by the de la Warre family with the establishment of a market in 1285. The main street, the present High Street, was laid out around the market place with uniform burgage plots and rear access lanes. Burghers paid an annual fixed rent to the overlord and they carried on trades and crafts which, together with their property rights, distinguished them from the feudal peasant. Livestock were often kept on the burgage plots behind the house, and this necessitated the rear access lane.

The original settlement of Wickwar was located around the church and Poole Court, a 16th-century Manor House demolished in the 19th century, to the north of the village. All that remains of the Manor is its terraced garden, south-west of the church.

The parish church of the Holy Trinity is set on a small hill and is of 12th-century origin. At the northern edge of the village, it is reached by a raised footpath called the Stank, meaning &quot;dam&quot; – there were fish ponds here until the 19th century. It was extensively remodelled in the 14th and 15th centuries and was restored c.1881 by W L Bernard. Inside there is a sculpture of St John the Baptist dated 1496, which was originally housed at Poole Court. It is a Grade II* listed building.

To the north of the church, within the churchyard is the Sunday School, built in 1837 in a Gothic revival style. The churchyard also has a number of chest tombs, which represent a collection of local and classical tomb forms.

The High Street has a collection of mostly 18th-century fronted, rendered or stuccoed houses, including Albert House and the Police station. The Town Hall c.1795 has arched openings and a bellcote with pinnacle. The Town Hall clock mechanism is thought to date from 1660.

The village is on the main Bristol–Birmingham railway line, and once had a station, but this was closed in January 1965. The village also used to have a shop and brewery which also closed in 2018 and 2020 respectively, leaving the village without any shops. There is also Wickwar Social Club, which is open to members only.

In April 2020, after hostility from the local area, a new home development in the village was targeted in a suspected arson attack, severely damaging a partially completed property.

Spherules are found lying unconformably over Carboniferous limestone in Wickwar Quarry. These are possibly tektite deposits, formed as molten material ejected by a meteorite impact that may have fallen back to Earth.

==Governance==

The village is part of &#x27;Ladden Brook&#x27; electoral ward. This ward stretches south east to Iron Acton and east to Tytherington. The total population of the ward taken from the 2011 census was 3,858.

==Recent events ==
=== 1987 gas explosion ===

On the morning of 9 January 1987, a gas pipe running underneath the High Street exploded, demolishing a house and damaging others nearby. However, an off-duty policeman returning from a late-night game of backgammon smelt the gas and raised the alarm, evacuating the street before the explosion. His house was destroyed, and others significantly damaged, but no-one was harmed. As he said at the time, had he been in bed at the usual time, it would have been far worse.

As a result of the explosion, a ban on heavy vehicles was introduced throughout the village, as it was thought that frequent use of the road by lorries, coupled with freezing weather conditions, had caused the 1950s pipes to break.

=== Geronimo the Alpaca ===
In August 2021 the farm owned by Helen Macdonald in Wickwar became the focal point of a controversial decision by DEFRA to kill an alpaca named Geronimo after the animal tested positive for bovine tuberculosis. On 31 August it was confirmed that the animal had been &quot;euthanised&quot; by staff from the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA).

<doc id="567816" wikidata="Q2063236" url="?curid=567816" title="Battle of Majuba Hill">
<text>The Battle of Majuba Hill on 27 February 1881 was the final and decisive battle of the First Boer War that was a resounding victory for the Boers. The British Major General Sir George Pomeroy Colley occupied the summit of the hill on the night of 26–27 February 1881. Colley&#x27;s motive for occupying Majuba Hill, near Volksrust, now in South Africa, may have been anxiety that the Boers would soon occupy it themselves, since he had witnessed their trenches being dug in the direction of the hill.

The Boers believed that he might have been attempting to outflank their positions at Laing&#x27;s Nek. The hill was not considered to be scalable by the Boers for military purposes and so it may have been Colley&#x27;s attempt to emphasise British power and strike fear into the Boer camp.

The battle is considered by some to have been one of the &quot;most humiliating&quot; defeats suffered by the British in their military history.

==Battle==
The bulk of the 405 British soldiers occupying the hill were 171 men of the 58th Regiment (two companies) with 141 men (three companies) of the 92nd Gordon Highlanders, and a small naval brigade from . Each man carried 70 rounds of ammunition, a full water bottle, three days&#x27; rations, a waterproof sheet, and a greatcoat. Two companies of the 60th Rifles (King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps) who had accompanied the column stayed on the slopes as pickets and to guard the lines of communication. General Colley had brought no artillery up to the summit and did not order his men to dig in, against the advice of several of his subordinates, (and each company bringing four picks and six shovels), since he expected that the Boers would retreat when they saw their position on the Nek was untenable. They also brought a heliograph, which they used to send some signals to the camp. However, the Boers quickly formed a group of storming parties, led by Nicolaas Smit, from an assortment of volunteers from various commandos, totaling at least 450 men to attack the hill.

By daybreak at 4:30, the 92nd Highlanders covered a wide perimeter of the summit, and a handful occupied Gordon&#x27;s Knoll on the right side of the summit. Oblivious to the presence of the British troops until the 92nd Gordon Highlanders began to yell and to shake their fists, the Boers began to panic for fear of an artillery attack. Three Boer storming groups of 100–200 men each began a slow advance up the hill, led by Field Cornet Stephanus Roos, Commandant D.J.K. Malan and Commandant Joachim Ferreira. The Boers, the better marksmen, kept their enemy on the slopes at bay while groups crossed the open ground to attack Gordon&#x27;s Knoll, where, at 12:45, Ferreira&#x27;s men opened up a tremendous fire on the exposed knoll and captured it. The Boer general Piet Joubert later noted that the British rifles were sighted at 400–600 yards while the battle raged at about 50–100 yards, as the British officers had not told the troops to alter their weapons. Thus, they shot downhill over the heads of the exposed Boer attackers.

Colley was in his tent when he was informed of the advancing Boers but took no immediate action until after he had been warned by several subordinates of the seriousness of the attack. Over the next hour, the Boers poured over the top of the British line and engaged the British at long range. Refusing close-combat action, they picked off the British soldiers one by one. The Boers could take advantage of the scrub and high grass that covered the hill, which the British were not trained to do. It was at that stage that British discipline began to break: the troops could not see their opponents and received very little direction from their officers, and they panicked and began to flee.
When more Boers were seen encircling the mountain, the British line collapsed, and many ran pell-mell from the hill. The Gordons held their ground the longest, but once they were broken, the battle was over. The Boers were able to launch an attack, which shattered the-already crumbling British line.

Amid great confusion and increasing slaughter among his men, Colley attempted a fighting retreat, but he was killed by Boer marksmen. The rest of the British force fled down the rear slopes of Majuba, where more were hit by the Boer marksmen firing from the summit. An abortive rearguard action was staged by the 15th Hussars and 60th Rifles, who had marched from a support base at Mount Prospect, but that made little impact on the Boer forces. A total of 285 British were killed, captured or wounded, including Captain Cornwallis Maude, son of government minister Cornwallis Maude, 1st Earl de Montalt.

Several wounded soldiers who soon found themselves surrounded by Boer soldiers gave their accounts later of that day. Many Boers were young farm boys armed with rifles. The revelation that professionally trained soldiers were defeated by young farmboys led by a smattering of older soldiers proved to be a major blow to Britain&#x27;s prestige and negotiating position in the treaty that ended the war.

==Aftermath==
Although small in numbers, the battle is historically significant for three reasons:
* It led to the signing of a peace treaty and later the Pretoria Convention between the British and the reinstated South African Republic that ended the First Boer War.
* The fire and movement (&quot;vuur en beweging&quot; in Afrikaans) tactics employed by the Boers, especially Commandant Nicolas Smit in his final assault on the hill, were years ahead of their time.
* Coupled with the defeats at Laing&#x27;s Nek and Schuinshoogte, this third crushing defeat at the hands of the Boers created a fearsome legend in the minds of the British lasting through the Second Boer War, when &quot;Remember Majuba&quot; became a rallying cry.

Some British historians have argued that the defeat marked the beginning of the decline of the British Empire. The First Boer War was the first time since the Revolutionary War that Britain was forced into either acknowledging the independence of a prewar possession or signing a treaty on unfavorable terms that yielded a significant amount of territory. In preceding conflicts, even if they suffered initial defeats, instances of the British not ultimately obtaining a decisive victory were very rare. Since British foreign policy discouraged negotiating from anything other than a position of strength, Majuba was the first time that Britain was defeated in the final engagements of a war. That position neglects that the First Boer War, while arguably Britain&#x27;s first unambiguous defeat since the American Revolution, was largely unnoticed by the general public. Britain was spared much of the embarrassment of defeat through the original terms ending the war. 

Under the 1881 Pretoria Convention, the British monarch became Head of state in the Transvaal, which was declared a self-governing, not an independent entity, under British suzerainty. Although that was never more than a legal fiction, soon abrogated by the 1884 London Convention, Britain could still formally deny its defeat. Prior to the discovery of gold in the Transvaal in 1886, it was widely presumed that the Transvaal Republic would not survive economically in the long term anyway. Furthermore, emerging powers, such as the United States, were already acting in open defiance of British hegemony at the time, and there is little evidence Britain&#x27;s defeat in the brief low-intensity conflict had any significant effect on the foreign relations of the British Empire. The First Anglo-Boer War can at best be called a temporary setback for the British Empire, which would continue to expand for several decades and eventually recover all territory lost in 1881 during the Second Boer War (1899–1902).

<text>Initium is the 1984 debut album by American deathrock band Samhain, released on lead singer Glenn Danzig&#x27;s independent record label Plan 9. In various interviews, Danzig stated that the album&#x27;s title, which translates from Latin to English as &quot;beginning&quot;, represents his new start after disbanding his prior band, Misfits, in 1983. Most of the final track, &quot;Archangel&quot;, was actually recorded in March 1981 with Jerry Only, and was originally meant to either be a Misfits song featuring Dave Vanian (who never did vocals for the song) or a track for the band the Damned. The track &quot;Horror Biz&quot; likewise dates to Danzig&#x27;s Misfits era, as it is a new version of &quot;Horror Business&quot; with different musical arrangements. The album was recorded at Reel Platinum studio in Lodi, New Jersey, excluding the introduction which was recorded at Eerie Von&#x27;s home on a four track cassette.

Also appearing on this recording are Lyle Preslar, guitarist for the influential D.C. band Minor Threat (CD tracks 2, 4, 6, and 7), and Al Pike, bassist for Reagan Youth (CD track 9).

==Different versions==
The 1986 cassette release features &quot;Initium&quot; plus the entire original version of the band&#x27;s follow-up record, the &quot;Unholy Passion EP&quot;, and is highly prized by collectors. Also much sought is the initial 1987 CD release of &quot;Initium&quot;, which featured the album plus the re-recorded/remixed version of the EP. (In 1989, these extra tracks were removed from all future CD pressings, and were instead included on the original 1990 &quot;Final Descent&quot; album). A very rare pressing exists, which contains the full &quot;Initium&quot; album and only the remixed title track from the EP. Likewise, some copies of the 2001 &quot;Initium&quot; reissue also feature the song &quot;Unholy Passion&quot; as an unlisted bonus track.

== Track listing ==
All songs written and composed by Glenn Danzig.

<doc id="567826" wikidata="Q1199521" url="?curid=567826" title="Vedic Mathematics">
<text>Vedic Mathematics is a book written by Indian &quot;Shankaracharya&quot; Bharati Krishna Tirtha and first published in 1965. It contains a list of mathematical techniques which were falsely claimed to contain advanced mathematical knowledge. The book was posthumously published under its deceptive title by editor V. S. Agrawala, who noted in the foreword that the claim of Vedic origin, made by the original author and implied by the title, was unsupported.

Neither Krishna Tirtha nor Agrawala were able to produce sources, and scholars unanimously note it to be a compendium of methods for increasing the speed of elementary mathematical calculations sharing no overlap with historical mathematical developments during the Vedic period. Nonetheless, there has been a proliferation of publications in this area and multiple attempts to integrate the subject into mainstream education at the state level by right-wing Hindu nationalist governments.

S. G. Dani of the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay wrote that despite the dubious historigraphy, some of the calculation methods it describes are themselves interesting, a product of the author&#x27;s academic training in mathematics and long recorded habit of experimentation with numbers.

== Contents ==
The book contains metaphorical aphorisms in the form of sixteen &quot;sutras&quot; and thirteen sub-sutras, which Krishna Tirtha states allude to significant mathematical tools. The range of their asserted applications spans from topic as diverse as statics and pneumatics to astronomy and financial domains. Tirtha stated that no part of advanced mathematics lay beyond the realms of his book and propounded that studying it for a couple of hours every day for a year equated to spending about two decades in any standardized education system to become professionally trained in the discipline of mathematics.

STS scholar S. G. Dani in &quot;&#x27;Vedic Mathematics&#x27;: Myth and Reality&quot; states that the book is primarily a compendium of &quot;tricks&quot; that can be applied in elementary, middle and high school arithmetic and algebra, to gain faster results. The sutras and sub-sutras are abstract literary expressions (for example, &quot;as much less&quot; or &quot;one less than previous one&quot;) prone to creative interpretations; Krishna Tirtha exploited this to the extent of manipulating the same &quot;shloka&quot; to generate widely different mathematical equivalencies across a multitude of contexts.

===Relationship with the Vedas===
According to Krishna Tirtha, the sutras and other accessory content were found after years of solitary study of the Vedas—a set of sacred ancient Hindu scriptures—in a forest. They were supposedly contained in the &quot;pariśiṣṭa&quot;—a supplementary text/appendix—of the Atharvaveda. He does not provide any more bibliographic clarification on the sourcing. The book&#x27;s editor, V. S. Agrawala, argues that since the Vedas are defined as the traditional repositories of all knowledge, any knowledge can be assumed to be somewhere in the Vedas, by definition; he even went to the extent of deeming Krishna Tirtha&#x27;s work as a &quot;pariśiṣṭa&quot; in itself.

However, numerous mathematicians and STS scholars (Dani, Kim Plofker, K.S. Shukla, Jan Hogendijk et al.) note that the Vedas do not contain any of those sutras and sub-sutras. When Shukla, a mathematician and historiographer of ancient Indian mathematics, challenged Krishna Tirtha to locate the sutras in the Parishishta of a standard edition of the Atharvaveda, Krishna Tirtha stated that they were not included in the standard editions but only in a hitherto-undiscovered version, chanced upon by him; the foreword and introduction of the book also takes a similar stand. Sanskrit scholars have observed that the book&#x27;s linguistic style is not that of the Vedic period but rather reflects modern Sanskrit.

Dani points out that the contents of the book have &quot;practically nothing in common&quot; with the mathematics of the Vedic period or even with subsequent developments in Indian mathematics. Shukla reiterates the observations, on a per-chapter basis. For example, multiple techniques in the book involve the use of decimals. These were unknown during the Vedic times and were introduced in India only in the sixteenth century; works of numerous ancient mathematicians such as Aryabhata, Brahmagupta and Bhaskara were based entirely on fractions. From a historiographic perspective, Vedic India had no knowledge of differentiation or integration. The book also claims that analytic geometry of conics occupied an important tier in Vedic mathematics, which runs contrary to all available evidence.

== Publication history and reprints ==
First published in 1965, five years after Krishna Tirtha&#x27;s death, the work consisted of forty chapters, originally on 367 pages, and covered techniques he had promulgated through his lectures. A foreword by Tirtha&#x27;s disciple Manjula Trivedi stated that he had originally written 16 volumes—one on each sutra—but the manuscripts were lost before publication, and that this work was penned in 1957.

Reprints were published in 1975 and 1978 to accommodate typographical corrections. Several reprints have been published since the 1990s.

== Reception ==
S. G. Dani of the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay) notes the book to be of dubious quality. He believes it did a disservice both to the pedagogy of mathematical education by presenting the subject as a collection of methods without any conceptual rigor, and to science and technology studies in India (STS) by adhering to dubious standards of historiography. He also points out that while Tirtha&#x27;s system could be used as a teaching aid, there was a need to prevent the use of &quot;public money and energy on its propagation&quot; except in a limited way and that authentic Vedic studies were being neglected in India even as Tirtha&#x27;s system received support from several government and private agencies. Jayant Narlikar has voiced similar concerns.

Hartosh Singh Bal notes that whilst Krishna Tirtha&#x27;s attempts might be somewhat acceptable in light of his nationalistic inclinations during colonial rule—he had left his spiritual endeavors to be appointed as the principal of a college to counter Macaulayism—it provided a fertile ground for further ethnonationalist abuse of historiography by Hindu nationalist parties; Thomas Trautmann views the development of Vedic Mathematics in a similar manner. Meera Nanda has noted hagiographic descriptions of Indian knowledge systems by various right-wing cultural movements (including the BJP), which have deemed Krishna Tirtha to be in the same league as Srinivasa Ramanujan.

Some have, however, praised the methods and commented on its potential to attract school-children to mathematics and increase popular engagement with the subject. Others have viewed the works as an attempt at harmonizing religion with science.

=== Originality of methods ===
Dani speculated that Krishna Tirtha&#x27;s methods were a product of his academic training in mathematics and long-recorded habit of experimentation with numbers. Similar systems include the Trachtenberg system or the techniques mentioned in Lester Meyers&#x27;s 1947 book &quot;High-speed Mathematics&quot;. Alex Bellos points out that several of the calculation methods can also be found in certain European treatises on calculation from the early Modern period.

=== Computation algorithms ===
Some of the algorithms have been tested for efficiency, with positive results. However, most of the algorithms have higher time complexity than conventional ones, which explains the lack of adoption of Vedic mathematics in real life.

== Integration into mainstream education ==
The book has been included in the school syllabus of the Indian states of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, soon after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a right-wing nationalist political party, came to power and remade the education system to emphasize historically dubious notions like that that Vedic Mathematics represented a genuinely ancient and inherently superior Indian and Hindu system of mathematics, knowledge, and thinking.

Dinanath Batra had conducted a lengthy campaign for the inclusion of Vedic Maths into the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) curricula. Subsequently, there was a proposal from NCERT to induct Vedic Maths, along with a number of fringe pseudo-scientific subjects (Vedic Astrology et al.), into the standard academic curricula. This was only shelved after a number of academics and mathematicians, led by Dani and sometimes backed by political parties, opposed these attempts based on previously discussed rationales and criticized the move as a politically guided attempt at saffronisation.

After the BJP&#x27;s return to power in 2014, three universities began offering courses on the subject of Vedic Mathematics while a television channel catering to the topic was also launched; generous education and research grants have also been allotted to the subject despite a lack of genuine scientific, mathematical, historical, or religious basis for doing so. The topic was introduced into the elementary curriculum of Himachal Pradesh in 2022. The same year, the government of Karnataka allocated funds for teaching the subject. This move by the BJP provoked criticism from academics and from Dalit groups.

<doc id="567831" wikidata="Q858010" url="?curid=567831" title="South Atlantic tropical cyclone">
<text>South Atlantic tropical cyclones are unusual weather events that occur in the Southern Hemisphere. Strong wind shear, which disrupts the formation of cyclones, as well as a lack of weather disturbances favorable for development in the South Atlantic Ocean, make any strong tropical system extremely rare, and Hurricane Catarina in 2004 is the only recorded South Atlantic hurricane in history. Storms can develop year-round in the South Atlantic, with activity peaking during the months from November through May. Since 2011, the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center has assigned names to tropical and subtropical systems in the western side of the basin, near the eastern coast of Brazil, when they have sustained wind speeds of at least , the generally accepted minimum sustained wind speed for a disturbance to be designated as a tropical storm in the North Atlantic basin. Below is a list of notable South Atlantic tropical and subtropical cyclones.

==Theories concerning infrequency of occurrence==
It was initially thought that tropical cyclones did not develop within the South Atlantic. Very strong vertical wind shear in the troposphere is considered a deterrent. The Intertropical Convergence Zone drops one to two degrees south of the equator, not far enough from the equator for the Coriolis force to significantly aid development. Water temperatures in the tropics of the southern Atlantic are cooler than those in the tropical north Atlantic.

Although they are rare, during April 1991 the United States&#x27; National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported that a tropical cyclone had developed over the Eastern South Atlantic. In subsequent years, a few systems were suspected to have the characteristics needed to be classified as a tropical cyclone, including in March 1994 and January 2004. During March 2004, an extratropical cyclone formally transitioned into a tropical cyclone and made landfall on Brazil, after becoming a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. While the system was threatening the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina, a newspaper used the headline &quot;Furacão Catarina&quot;, which was originally presumed to mean &quot;furacão (hurricane) threatening (Santa) Catarina (the state)&quot;. After international presses started monitoring the system, &quot;Hurricane Catarina&quot; has formally been adopted.

At the Sixth WMO International Workshop on Tropical Cyclones (IWTC-VI) in 2006, it was questioned if any subtropical or tropical cyclones had developed within the South Atlantic before Catarina. It was noted that suspect systems had developed in January 1970, March 1994, January 2004, March 2004, May 2004, February 2006, and March 2006. It was also suggested that an effort should be made to locate any possible systems using satellite imagery and synoptic data; however, it was noted that this effort may be hindered by the lack of any geostationary imagery over the basin before 1966. A study was subsequently performed and published during 2012, which concluded that there had been 63 subtropical cyclones in the Southern Atlantic between 1957 and 2007. During January 2009, a subtropical storm developed in the basin, and in March 2010, a tropical storm developed, which was named Anita by the Brazilian public and private weather services. In 2011, the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center started to assign names to tropical and subtropical cyclones that develop within its area of responsibility, to the west of 20°W, when they have sustained wind speeds of at least .

==Notable storms and impacts==
=== Pre-2010s ===
====1991 Angola tropical storm====

A low-pressure area formed over the Congo Basin on 9 April. The next day it moved offshore northern Angola with a curved cloud pattern. It moved westward over an area of warm waters while the circulation became better defined. According to the United States National Hurricane Center, the system was probably either a tropical depression or a tropical storm at its peak intensity. On 14 April, the system rapidly dissipated, as it was absorbed into a large squall line. This is the only recorded tropical cyclone in the eastern South Atlantic.
====Hurricane Catarina====

Hurricane Catarina was an extraordinarily rare hurricane-strength tropical cyclone, forming in the southern Atlantic Ocean in March 2004. Just after becoming a hurricane, it hit the southern coast of Brazil in the state of Santa Catarina on the evening of 28 March, with winds up to making it a Category 1-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. Catarina killed 3 to 11 people and caused millions of dollars in damage in Brazil.

At the time, Brazilians were taken completely by surprise, and were initially skeptical that an actual tropical cyclone could have formed in the South Atlantic. Eventually, however, they were convinced, and adopted the previously unofficial name &quot;Catarina&quot; for the storm, after Santa Catarina state. This event is considered by some meteorologists to be a nearly once-in-a-lifetime occurrence.
===2010s===
====Tropical Storm Anita====

On 8 March 2010, a previously extratropical cyclone developed tropical characteristics and was classified as a subtropical cyclone off the coast of southern Brazil. The following day, the United States Naval Research Laboratory began monitoring the system as a system of interest under the designation of &quot;90Q&quot;. The National Hurricane Center also began monitoring the system as Low SL90. During the afternoon of 9 March, the system had attained an intensity of and a barometric pressure of 1000 hPa (mbar). It was declared a tropical storm on 10 March and became extratropical late on 12 March. Anita&#x27;s accumulated cyclone energy was estimated at 2.0525 by the Florida State University. There was no damage associated to the storm, except high sea in the coasts of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina. Post mortem, the cyclone was given the name &quot;Anita&quot; by private and public weather centers in Southern Brazil.
====Subtropical Storm Arani====

Early on 14 March 2011, the Navy Hydrographic Center-Brazilian Navy (SMM), in coordination with the National Institute of Meteorology, were monitoring an organizing area of convection near the southeast coast of Brazil. Later that day a low-pressure area developed just east of Vitória, Espírito Santo, and by 12:00 UTC, the system organized into a subtropical depression, located about east of Campos dos Goytacazes. Guided by a trough and a weak ridge to its north, the system moved slowly southeastward over an area of warm waters, intensifying into Subtropical Cyclone Arani on 15 March, as named by the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center, and achieving its lowest pressure. The storm was classified as subtropical, as the convection was east of the center. On 16 March, Arani began experiencing of wind shear because another frontal system bumped it from behind. As it moved east-southeastwards, it achieved its highest winds as it transitioned back to an extratropical cyclone, process that was concluded on early 17 March. 

Before it developed into a subtropical cyclone, Arani produced torrential rains over portions of southeastern Brazil, resulting in flash flooding and landslides. Significant damage was reported in portions of Espírito Santo, though specifics are unknown. Increased swells along the coast prompted ocean travel warnings.
====Subtropical Storm Bapo====

On 5 February 2015, a subtropical depression developed about to the southeast of São Paulo, Brazil. During the next day, low-level baroclinity decreased around the system, as it moved southeastwards away from the Brazilian coast and into anomalously warm waters, where it intensified further. The system was named Bapo by the Brazilian Navy Hydrography Center during 6 February as it had intensified into a subtropical storm. Over the next couple of days the system continued to move south-eastwards, achieving its peak intensity just before it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone during 8 February.
====Subtropical Storm Cari====

On 10 March 2015, the Hydrographic Center of the Brazilian Navy began issuing warnings on Subtropical Depression 3 during early afternoon, while the Center for Weather Forecast and Climatic Studies (CPTEC in Portuguese) already assigned the name &quot;Cari&quot; for the storm. At 00:00 UTC on 11 March, the Hydrographic Center of the Brazilian Navy upgraded Cari to a subtropical storm, also assigning this name to it. On 12 March, the Brazilian Hydrographic Center downgraded Cari to a subtropical depression as it achieved its lowest pressure, while the CPTEC stated that the storm had become a &quot;Hybrid cyclone&quot; as it moved away from the continental coastline. During early afternoon of 13 March, the Brazilian Navy declared that Cari became a remnant low.

Cari brought heavy rainfall, flooding and landslides to eastern cities of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul states as it interacted with a South Atlantic Convergence Zone. Rain totals from were observed associated with the storms and wind topped in Cabo de Santa Marta. A Navy buoy registered a wave off the coast of Santa Catarina.
====Subtropical Storm Deni====

On 15 November 2016, instability areas associated with a trough axis over Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s coastline led to the formation of a subtropical depression southwest of it. It intensified into a subtropical storm and received the name &quot;Deni&quot; on 16 November. Moving south-southeastwards, Deni soon became extratropical shortly before 00:00 UTC on 17 November, where it was absorbed by a mid-latitude frontal system.
====Subtropical Storm Eçaí====

An extratropical cyclone entered the South Atlantic Ocean from Santa Catarina early on 4 December 2016. Later, it intensified quickly and then transitioned into a subtropical storm shortly before 22:00 BRST (00:00 UTC on 5 December), with the name &quot;Eçaí&quot; assigned by the Hydrographic Center of the Brazilian Navy. Eçaí started to decay on 5 December as it moved Into cooler waters, and weakened into a subtropical depression at around 00:00 UTC on 6 December. As it decayed and lost its subtropical characteristics, its center divided in two, with the new center moving away southeastwards and the old one degrading into a remnant frontal low.
====Subtropical Storm Guará====

According to the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center, on 8 December 2017 a South Atlantic Convergence Zone aligned with a through axis led to the formation of several instability areas. On 9 December a subtropical storm formed from this setup, on border between Espírito Santo and Bahia, moving southeastwards away from land. On late 10 December, a Cold front pushed Guará southwards towards cooler waters, where it started transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. On early 11 December Guará attained its peak intensity, shortly thereafter degenerating into a low-pressure area associated with a through axis.
====Tropical Storm Iba====

According to the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center, on 22 March 2019, a low-pressure area formed off the coast of Bahia after the passage of a frontal system. On the next day, the cyclone developed a deep warm-core, thus being designated as a tropical depression. On 24 March, the system intensified into a tropical storm, receiving the name &quot;Iba&quot; from the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center. After moving southwestward for a couple of days, on 26 March, Iba reached its peak intensity. Afterward, a cold front would approach the storm, which helped intensify the wind shear impacting Iba, leading to its weakening and extratropical transition. On early 28 March, Iba would degenerate into a remnant low, becoming fully extratropical a day later.

Iba was the first tropical storm to develop in the basin since Anita in 2010, as well as the first fully tropical system to be named from the Brazilian naming list. 
====Subtropical Storm Jaguar====

According to the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center, on 19 May 2019 several instability areas formed from a through axis off the coast of Espírito Santo, which later coalesced into a subtropical depression. On 20 May, the system strengthened into a subtropical storm, receiving the name &quot;Jaguar&quot; from the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center. However, the system did not intensify any further, as it soon encountered unfavorable conditions while moving southeastwards, weakening into a subtropical depression on early 21 May. Later that day, Jaguar degenerated into several sparse instability areas associated with a low-pressure area, which was absorbed by a frontal system on 22 May.
===2020s===
==== Subtropical Storm Kurumí ====
On 21 January 2020, the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center began monitoring an area of persisting thunderstorms near São Paulo for potential subtropical cyclone development. Generally tracking southeastward, the system began to organize within the afternoon hours of 22 January, aided by the establishment of a South Atlantic Convergence Zone, and was designated a subtropical depression in the early hours of 23 January. Several hours later, due to a lack of wind shear, the system intensified into a subtropical storm and was given the name &quot;Kurumí&quot;. After this bout of intensification, Kurumí moved southward and began to succumb to much more unfavorable conditions. It weakened back to a subtropical depression on late 24 January, due to an intensification of wind shear over its circulation due to the formation of an extratropical cyclone to its southeast. The last advisory was issued on Kurumí later that same day, as it degenerated into a trough while also beginning to merge with the nearby frontal system.

The front associated with Kurumí would later play a role in the 2020 Brazilian floods and mudslides, producing heavy rainfall. Over 171.8 mm (6.76 in) of rain fell in the Belo Horizonte metro area on 24 January, triggering a landslide and killing 3 people and leaving 1 missing.
====Subtropical Storm Mani====

According to the Hydrographic Center of the Brazilian Navy, on 24 October 2020, a trough axis persisted off the coast of the border between Espírito Santo and Bahia, which led to the formation of a subtropical depression on the next day. Later that day it intensified into a subtropical storm, which led it to be named &quot;Mani&quot; at 00:00 UTC on 26 October. As it moved away from a South Atlantic Convergence Zone on 27 October, Mani gradually lost its subtropical characteristics, until it weakened to a low pressure area.

The storm caused significant damage in Espírito Santo, with landslides of stones and earth leaving more than 400 people homeless. The storm also impacted almost the entire state of Minas Gerais and the northern region of Rio de Janeiro.
====Subtropical Storm Oquira====

According to the Hydrographic Center of the Brazilian Navy, on 26 December 2020, the prior presence of a South Atlantic Convergence Zone and the subsequent passage of a frontal system led to the presence of several instability areas off the coast east of Rio Grande do Sul, which coalesced into a subtropical depression a day later. Moving southwestward, the system&#x27;s central pressure dropped to by 00:00 UTC on 28 December. Later that day, the system&#x27;s winds intensified, and it was named &quot;Oquira&quot; by the Brazilian Hydrographic Center. On 29 December, Oquira continued to strengthen, deepening while heading further southwestward away from the Brazilian mainland, and reaching a pressure of . Afterwards, Oquira&#x27;s movements shifted southeastwards, and its winds decreased as it started to lose its subtropical characteristics, weakening to a subtropical depression on 30 December, but its pressure continued to drop, bottoming out at a minimum central pressure of . Later that day, Oquira transitioned into an extratropical low, and the Hydrographic Center issued their final advisory on the storm as it was absorbed by a frontal system.
====Tropical Storm 01Q====
On 4 February 2021, an extratropical storm off the coast of Rio Grande do Sul developed into a bomb cyclone. On 6 February, the storm began separating from its weather fronts and developed subtropical characteristics, before fully separating from the frontal zone and transitioning into a fully-tropical storm later that day. As a result, the NOAA classified the system as a tropical storm at 17:30 UTC, with the system being designated as &quot;Tropical Storm 01Q&quot;. However, the storm was short-lived, as it lost its tropical characteristics several hours later, with the NOAA issuing their final bulletin on the storm at 23:30 UTC that day. The storm dissipated soon afterward. Although the NOAA issued bulletins on the storm, the Hydrographic Center of the Brazilian Navy did not monitor it.
==== Subtropical Depression #01-2021====

On 13 February 2021, according to the Brazilian Navy, instability areas associated with a low-pressure area off the coast of the state of Rio Grande do Sul acquired subtropical characteristics on the next day, becoming a subtropical depression about from the state. For the next few days, the storm slowly meandered southeastward and then southwestward alongside a trough axis to its east, until it lost its subtropical characteristics over high seas on 17 February, becoming a remnant low.

The Brazilian Navy noted in its post-season analysis that on late 14 February the system could have intensified into a subtropical storm, since the radiometer built into the AMSR-2 satellite found winds of 35 knots, but it wasn&#x27;t upgraded because no other measurement confirmed such findings.
==== Subtropical Storm Potira====

A low south of Rio de Janeiro transitioned into a subtropical depression on 19 April 2021.
On 20 April 2021, the system intensified into a subtropical storm, which Brazilian Navy then decided to name it &quot;Potira&quot;. Potira moved slowly northeastwards for a couple of days over unusually warmer waters, favorable upper-level tropospheric winds and strong low-level convergence, which led to its intensification and persistence of its peak intensity until 23 April. As it completed a clockwise loop, Potira weakened into a subtropical depression, with the Brazilian Navy downgrading it to a low-pressure area on late 24 January.

The storm caused a gale in the Copacabana fort and the gusts of wind went over . In the municipalities of Balneário Camboriú and Florianópolis (SC), the hangover caused by Potira caused flooding in the streets and damage to the sidewalks. The ports of Itajaí and Navegantes were closed for 3 days. No economic or material damage caused by the cyclone has been reported.
==== Subtropical Storm Raoni ====

An extratropical cyclone formed on 26 June 2021, about east-southeast of Montevideo, Uruguay, associated with a cold airmass that acted over the region. On the next day, the cyclone acquired a warm seclusion while intensifying, while it moved westwards and separated from the frontal system it was previously attached to. As the system occluded, the seclusion deepened and started to acquire subtropical characteristics, which led it to be designated as a subtropical storm on 29 June. It remained unnamed due to it being outside of the Brazilian Navy&#x27;s area of responsibility. By 23:30 UTC on 28 June, the Satellite Products and Services Division of the NESDIS declared the system to have become a tropical storm, based on a Dvorak rating of 3.5, assigning an &quot;invest&quot; tag to it. Although being affected by strong wind shear to its north due to a subtropical jet caused by the presence of a frontal system nearby, it further intensified and achieved a minimum pressure , while tracking northeastwards towards the Brazilian area of authority. At around 12:00 UTC on the next day, as the storm entered the boundary of METAREA V, Brazilian Navy&#x27;s area of responsibility, thus it was assigned the name &quot;Raoni&quot;. Continuing moving northeastwards, Raoni further developed an eye feature as well as a robust band to the east of the system. Raoni began to weaken by 30 June, as the subtropical jet broke the barotropic flow over it, and NESDIS dropped the tag as it lost its convective bands. On 1 July, Raoni lost its subtropical characteristics and degenerated into a low-pressure area.

The predecessor extratropical cyclone of Raoni caused heavy rains and strong winds gust up to , downing trees and causing damages to different public and private establishments across Punta del Este. The area&#x27;s waters were also rough due to the storm. Downpours with continuous gales were also experienced in Uruguay&#x27;s capital Montevideo. From 24 June to 2 July, Raoni channeled cold air from Antarctica into portions of South America, leading to an unusually potent cold wave across Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, and Brazil, with the temperature dropping as much as 15 °C (27 °F) below average in some areas. The combination of the cyclone and the cold wave also produced snowfall across the southern portion of South America, with snowfall observed as far north as southern Brazil. 
====Subtropical Storm Ubá====
On 9 December 2021, instability areas remained off the coast of Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro after the passage of a frontal system and a South Atlantic Convergence Zone. Overnight the system coalesced into an occluded front, which transitioned into a subtropical depression. On the morning of the next day, the system was upgraded to subtropical storm status, receiving the name &quot;Ubá&quot;. On 11 December Ubá gradually weakened while moving southeastwards, being downgraded to depression status. It degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area on the next day.

The precursor extratropical cyclone and South Atlantic Convergence Zone caused heavy rains in Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo and southern Bahia, where heavy precipitation accumulated in Itamaraju and in Monte Formoso, killing fifteen people.
====Subtropical Storm Yakecan====
On 15 May 2022, an extratropical cyclone moved through the southern region of Brazil and stopped offshore. The low occluded and separated form its precursor extratropical cyclone, obtaining subtropical characteristics in the process. On the morning of 17 May, the cyclone fully transitioned into a subtropical storm, and was given the name &quot;Yakecan&quot;. Taking a more northwestwardly movement, Yakecan moved away from the coastline, gradually losing its subtropical characteristics. On late 19 May, it acquired frontal characteristics and transitioned to an extratropical cyclone.

During its trajectory, the storm caused snow in the Gaúcha and Catarinense Mountains, setting record lows for this time of year. Two people died in Uruguay and Brazil due to the passage of the cyclone. Yakecan is the last name from the regular naming list, which has been in use since 2011.
====Tropical Storm Akará====
In February 2024, a low-pressure area began developing along a stalled cold front. Moisture from the tropics began feeding into the circulation of the developing disturbance, helping it to intensify. On 16 February 2024, the Brazilian Navy designated the system, which at the time was east southeast of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as a subtropical depression. Two days later, the system transitioned into a tropical cyclone. In the early hours of 19 February, the system intensified into a tropical storm, receiving the name &quot;Akará&quot; from the Brazilian Navy. However, two days later, the system lost its tropical characteristics and weakened into a subtropical depression. The next day, the system lost its subtropical characteristics, thus the Brazilian Navy ceased all bulletins.

The precursor extratropical cyclone to Akará brought heavy rainfall to South America. Nova Iguaçu was affected with intense rainfall and winds. Akará was the first named tropical storm to develop in the basin since Iba in 2019.
====Subtropical Storm Biguá====

Early on 15 December 2024, a subtropical storm formed off the coast of the Brazil–Uruguay border, receiving the name &quot;Biguá&quot; from the Brazilian Navy. As it moved southeastwards, away from the coastline, the system was downgraded to subtropical depression. On early 17 December 2024, the cyclone was downgraded to a low-pressure area as it transitioned to a extratropical cyclone.

The closeness to the Brazilian shore caused wind gusts over the southeastern Rio Grande do Sul, leading to power losses and structural damages on nearby cities. 
==Other systems==

===Pre-2004===

According to a presentation at the Sixth WMO International Workshop on Tropical Cyclones (IWTC-VI), satellite imagery from January 1970 showed that a system with an eyewall had developed behind a cold front and that the system needed further analysis to determine if it was tropical or subtropical. On 27 March 1974, a weak area of low pressure that had originated over the Amazon River started to intensify further. Over the next 48 hours the system quickly developed further and was classified as subtropical, as it developed a banding structure and deep convection near its warm core. On 29 March, a north-westerly flow encroached on the systems environment, which caused the system to rapidly move towards 40S and the cold waters that were present to the south of 40°S.

In March 1994, a system that was thought to be weaker than Catarina was spawned but was located over cool and open waters. According to the Zambia Meteorological Department, Cyclone Bonita moved off the coast of Angola and entered the South Atlantic Ocean on 19 January 1996. By the next day, the system had succumbed to cold waters and days of land interaction, dissipating completely. It was the first tropical cyclone known to have traversed southern Africa from the South-West Indian Ocean to the South Atlantic.

===2004–2009===
During 2004, the large-scale conditions over the South Atlantic were more conducive than usual for subtropical or tropical systems, with 4 systems noted. The first possible tropical cyclone developed within a trough of low pressure, to the southeast of Salvador, Brazil on 18 January. The system subsequently displayed a small central dense overcast (CDO) and was suspected to be at the peak of its development as either a tropical depression or a tropical storm during the next day. The system was subsequently affected by some strong shear, before it moved inland and weakened along the coast of Brazil before it was last noted during 21 January. Within Brazil the system caused heavy rain and flooding with a state of emergency declared in Aracaju, after the river overflowed and burst its banks which flooded homes, destroyed crops and caused parts of the highway to collapse. However, it was noted that not all of the heavy rain and impacts were attributable to the system, as a large monsoon low covered much of Brazil at the time. The second system was a possible hybrid cyclone that developed near south-eastern Brazil between 15 and 16 March. Hurricane Catarina was the third system, while the fourth system formed off the coast of Brazil on 15 May 2004.
On 22 February 2006, a baroclinic cyclone intensified quickly and was estimated to have peaked with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of , after radar data showed that the system had developed an eye and banding. However, there were questions about how tropical the system was, as it did not separate from the westerlies or the baroclinic zone it was in. Between 11 and 17 March 2006, another system with a warm core developed and moved southward along the South Atlantic Zone, before dissipating.

Two subtropical cyclones affected both Uruguay and Rio Grande do Sul state in Brazil between 2009 and 2010. On 28 January 2009, a cold-core mid to upper-level trough in phase with a low-level warm-core low formed a system and moved eastward into the South Atlantic. The storm produced rainfall in 24 hours of or more in some locations of Rocha (Uruguay) and southern Rio Grande do Sul. The weather station owned by MetSul Weather Center in Morro Redondo, Southern Brazil, recorded in a 24-hour period. The storm caused fourteen deaths and the evacuation of thousands, with an emergency declared in four cities. It lasted until 1 February, when the cyclone became extratropical.

===2010–2016===

On 16 November 2010, a cold-core mid to upper-level trough in phase with a low-level warm-core low developed a low-pressure system over Brazil, and moved southeastward into the South Atlantic, where it slightly deepened. The system brought locally heavy rains in southern Brazil and northeast of Uruguay that exceeded 200 millimeters within a few hours, in some locations of Southern Rio Grande do Sul, northwest of Pelotas. Damages and flooding were observed in Cerrito, São Lourenço do Sul and Pedro Osório. Bañado de Pajas, department of Cerro Largo in Uruguay, recorded of rain. The subtropical cyclone then became a weak trough on 19 November, according to the CPTEC.

Between 23 December 2013 and 24 January 2015, the CPTEC and Navy Hydrography Center monitored four subtropical depressions to the south of Rio de Janeiro. The first one lasted until Christmas Day, 2013. Two subtropical depressions formed in 2014: one in late-February 2014 and the other in late-March 2014. A fourth one formed in late January 2015.

On 5 January 2016, the Hydrographic Center of the Brazilian Navy issued warnings on a subtropical depression that formed east of Vitória, Espírito Santo. On the next day, the system strengthened into a tropical depression, and other agencies considered the system an invest, designating it as &quot;90Q&quot;; however, on 7 January, the tropical depression dissipated.

===2021–present===
On 3 January 2021, according to the Météo-France, the remnants of Tropical Storm Chalane from the South-West Indian Ocean crossed southern Africa and briefly emerged into the eastern South Atlantic before dissipating.

On 7 January 2023, a subtropical depression formed about southeast of Rio de Janeiro. Without affecting any area and moving away from the Brazilian coast, it lost its subtropical characteristics in the afternoon of 10 January, according to the Brazilian Navy Hydrography Center.

==Storm names==
The following names are published by the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center&#x27;s Marine Meteorological Service and used for tropical and subtropical storms that form in the area west of 20ºW and south of equator in the South Atlantic Ocean. Originally announced in 2011, the list was extended from 10 to 15 names in 2018. In 2022, 32 new names were added after the previous ones were exhausted. The names are assigned in alphabetical order and used sequentially without regard to year. 

=== Retirements ===
&quot;Kamby&quot; was replaced by &quot;Kurumí&quot; in 2018 without being used.

== Climatological statistics ==
There have been 88 recorded tropical and subtropical cyclones in the South Atlantic Ocean since 1957. Like most southern hemisphere cyclone seasons, most of the storms have formed between November and May.

<text>Unholy Passion is the first EP and second overall release by American deathrock band Samhain, Glenn Danzig&#x27;s band after the disbanding of the Misfits. According to bassist Eerie Von in his photographic book &quot;Misery Obscura,&quot; the album was &quot;a departure from our first release: more underground, more tribal. A step back further into the darkness&quot;. The song &quot;All Hell&quot; is a re-recorded version of the Misfits&#x27; &quot;All Hell Breaks Loose&quot;.

The original 12&quot; vinyl EP was pressed twice: once on black vinyl and the classic tan cover, and then again in 1986, on both red and black vinyl (with a maroon sleeve) and white vinyl (with tan cover).

In 1987, Danzig re-recorded the guitar and some vocal tracks for the songs, removing the original work done by Pete &quot;Damien&quot; Marshall. The recordings were given new mixes and, with the addition of &quot;Misery Tomb&quot;, were released as part of &quot;Final Descent&quot; in 1990. The remixed versions were released as a standalone CD for the first time as part of the Samhain box set in 2000 and as an individual CD in 2001.

== Track listing ==

<text>Severn Beach is a village on the Severn Estuary in South Gloucestershire, England. The eastern portal of the Severn Tunnel is on the outskirts of the village. The Severn footpathon the sea wallis part of the Severn Way that leads from Gloucester, Slimbridge and the Second Severn Crossing. Extensive sea defences have been constructed and this provides a popular walkway along its length. Originally, the Severn Way finished at Severn Beach, but it has been extended to Bristol.

The village is part of the Thornbury and Yate parliamentary constituency and is represented by the Liberal Democrat MP, Claire Young.

==History==
Before the Great Western Railway arrived in 1900, the area was farmland. In 1922, the village became a seaside resort with a swimming pool called the &quot;Blue Lagoon&quot;, a boating lake, dozens of fun-fair stalls, donkey rides (on grass), mostly by local entrepreneur Robert Stride. Many people came from nearby Bristol because Severn Beach had less strict licensing laws. The Beach Comber club appeared in the 1960s 

Robert Charles Barton Stride 1894–1970, son of Albert and Alice Stride. Albert&#x27;s father George was the brother of Edmund Stride who was involved in the construction of Avonmouth docks and housing. His sons Jared and Jethro Stride were the original ‘Stride Brothers’ who built one-off luxury houses in Sneyd Park, Bristol. Robert lived next door to his cousins Jared and Jethro in Shirehampton.
Robert enlisted in WW1 and was a driver, driving a range of vehicles including ambulances.
Like many other Strides in Shirehampton Robert was a builder by trade. After the war ended he resumed trading. With the opening of the rail link from Avonmouth in 1924 Robert Stride moved his operations from his house in Station Road, Shirehampton, to Severn Beach, and built a restaurant and six shops opposite the tennis courts. He bought up surplus material from the remount depot in Shirehampton which had closed at the end of the war. He re-used much of this in his buildings at Severn Beach. The swimming pool was built by Robert and he also built Osborne Road, Beach Road and Beach Avenue, laying out a putting green, boating lake and miniature railway. During the 1930s he installed electricity for all. He was Parish Councillor for 26 years between 1937 and 1964. His family were staunch Methodists and were involved with the Methodist church in Shirehampton. His brother Horatio was a keen supporter of Toc H.
Robert&#x27;s daughter (Mrs Turner) taught at Severn Beach Primary School (in Pilning).

With its era as a holiday and pleasure resort ending in the 1970s, many of the shops have also closed; however, the convenience store and Down&#x27;s Bakery still trade. Severn Beach had a dedicated Post Office at 103 Beach Road but this also closed and a small Post Office is now housed a few doors away at the Morrisons Daily convenience store. The village pub (Severn Salmon, formerly Severn Beach Hotel) was demolished to make way for housing. The Blue Lagoon swimming pool was demolished in the 1980s in favour of creating more open space and some housing plus part purchased by Northavon District Council to act as a sea defence when over-topping occurs from the River Severn. It was during this time that all the railway station buildings were demolished to make way for new housing leaving just the platform. The station is now unmanned, with a ticket machine on the platform. The boating lake has been filled in and landscaped and now forms part of the sea defence known as Sea Wall Gardens. Public toilets that were built on Beach Road during its heyday as a pleasure resort are still there but are locked overnight. A new sea front Tea Cottage opened in 2018 on the site of the old Burger Bar and its associated children&#x27;s fun rides. Shirley&#x27;s Cafe also remains open on Station Road.

==Second Severn Crossing==

The Severn Bridges Visitor Centre was opened in 1998 following the completion of the Second Severn Crossing at the end of Shaft Road, off Green Lane. Run by the Severn Bridges Trust and housing an exhibition showing the history of the river crossings using interactive displays, video films, pictures, models and descriptions, it closed in 2008.

==Ecology==

The coastline at Severn Beach is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and has a diverse range of wildlife, varying from seals to peregrine falcons. There have been more than 281 species of bird recorded in the Severn Beach area and it is of international importance for migrating and wintering birds. As of 1990, 31 species of seabird had been recorded in the Severn Beach/New Passage area, including 3 Petrel species including the first British record of White Bellied/Black Bellied Petrel, four species of Diver including Pacific Diver, Cory&#x27;s Shearwater, Sooty shearwater and Balearic shearwaters, all four Northern Hemisphere skuas, seven species of tern and five species of alcid. Severn Beach offers excellent conger fishing from the shore in the winter.

==Transport==
The village is at the terminus of the Severn Beach line railway, with a small unstaffed station. The line used to loop northwards to join the main Cardiff to Bristol line at Pilning railway station in the direction of Bristol, but this section was closed in 1964 and the trackbed has been built over.

Train services are operated by Great Western Railway; 11 trains per weekday with an average journey time between Severn Beach and Bristol Temple Meads of 41 minutes. The fastest journey time is 36 minutes.

The village is close to the A403 road that runs from junction 1 of the M48 motorway at Aust to the docks at Avonmouth.

Severn Beach with substantial development at Western Approach and new energy recovery centres on the main Severn Road (A403), is now a very busy area with heavy traffic which will be somewhat relieved of congestion when the new M49 junction at Farm Lane (located to the south of the Western Approach Distribution Park and west of the village of Easter Compton) is opened. This was expected to open in late 2019/early 2020 but legal disputes have delayed this opening. The village is currently once again served by buses by Stagecoach West going via Pilning, Easter Compton, Cribbs Causeway, Little Stoke, Bristol Parkway station to the University of the West of England Campus.

==Education==
Primary education is provided by Severn Beach Primary School at Ableton Lane, Severn Beach. There are no senior schools in Severn Beach.

<doc id="567840" wikidata="Q1751685" url="?curid=567840" title="Solution set">
<text>In mathematics, the solution set of a system of equations or inequality is the set of all its solutions, that is the values that satisfy all equations and inequalities. Also, the solution set or the truth set of a statement or a predicate is the set of all values that satisfy it. 

If there is no solution, the solution set is the empty set.

== Examples ==
* The solution set of the single equation formula_1 is the set formula_2.
* Since there do not exist numbers formula_3 and formula_4 making the two equations formula_5 simultaneously true, the solution set of this system is the 
* The solution set of a constrained optimization problem is its feasible region.
* The truth set of the predicate formula_6 is formula_7.

== Remarks ==
In algebraic geometry, solution sets are called algebraic sets if there are no inequalities. Over the reals, and with inequalities, there are called semialgebraic sets.

== Other meanings ==
More generally, the solution set to an arbitrary collection &quot;E&quot; of relations (&quot;Ei&quot;) (&quot;i&quot; varying in some index set &quot;I&quot;) for a collection of unknowns formula_8, supposed to take values in respective spaces formula_9, is the set &quot;S&quot; of all solutions to the relations &quot;E&quot;, where a solution formula_10 is a family of values formula_11 such that substituting formula_12 by formula_10 in the collection &quot;E&quot; makes all relations &quot;true&quot;.

(Instead of relations depending on unknowns, one should speak more correctly of predicates, the collection &quot;E&quot; is their logical conjunction, and the solution set is the inverse image of the boolean value &quot;true&quot; by the associated boolean-valued function.)

The above meaning is a special case of this one, if the set of polynomials &quot;fi&quot; if interpreted as the set of equations &quot;fi&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)=0.

===Examples===

* The solution set for &quot;E&quot; = { &quot;x&quot;+&quot;y&quot; = 0 } with respect to formula_14 is &quot;S&quot; = { (&quot;a&quot;,−&quot;a&quot;) : &quot;a&quot; ∈ R }.
* The solution set for &quot;E&quot; = { &quot;x&quot;+&quot;y&quot; = 0 } with respect to formula_15 is &quot;S&quot; = { −&quot;y&quot; }. (Here, &quot;y&quot; is not &quot;declared&quot; as an unknown, and thus to be seen as a parameter on which the equation, and therefore the solution set, depends.)
* The solution set for formula_16 with respect to formula_17 is the interval &quot;S&quot; = [0,2] (since formula_18 is undefined for negative values of &quot;x&quot;).
* The solution set for formula_19 with respect to formula_20 is &quot;S&quot; = 2πZ (see Euler&#x27;s identity).

<doc id="567846" wikidata="Q2068602" url="?curid=567846" title="Penalty (ice hockey)">
<text>A penalty in ice hockey is a punishment for an infringement of the rules. Most penalties are enforced by sending the offending player to a penalty box for a set number of minutes. During the penalty the player may not participate in play. Penalties are called and enforced by the referee, or in some cases, the linesman. The offending team may not replace the player on the ice (although there are some exceptions, such as fighting), leaving them short-handed as opposed to full strength. When the opposing team is said to be on a &quot;power play&quot;, they will have one more player on the ice than the short-handed team. The short-handed team is said to be &quot;on the penalty kill&quot; until the penalty expires and the penalized player returns to play. While standards vary somewhat between leagues, most leagues recognize several common varieties of penalties, as well as common infractions.

The statistic used to track penalties is called &quot;penalty minutes&quot; and abbreviated to &quot;PIM&quot; (spoken as single word &quot;pims&quot;). PIM is an acronym for &quot;penalties in minutes&quot;, though the full term is rarely used today. It represents the total assessed length of penalties each player or team has accrued.

==History==

The first codified rules of ice hockey, known as the Halifax Rules, were brought to Montreal by James Creighton, who organized the first indoor ice hockey game in 1875. Two years later, the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; documented the first set of &quot;Montreal Rules&quot;, which noted that &quot;charging from behind, tripping, collaring, kicking or shinning the ball shall not be allowed&quot;. The only penalty outlined by these rules was that play would be stopped, and a &quot;bully&quot; (faceoff) would take place. Revised rules in 1886 mandated that any player in violation of these rules would be given two warnings, but on a third offence would be removed from the game.

It was not until 1904 that players were ruled off the ice for infractions. At that time, a referee could assess a two-, three- or five-minute penalty, depending on the severity of the foul. By 1914, all penalties were five minutes in length, reduced to three minutes two years later, and the offending player was given an additional fine. When the National Hockey League (NHL) was founded in 1917, it mandated that a team could not substitute for any player who was assessed a penalty, thus requiring them to play shorthanded for the duration. The penalty was shortened to two minutes for the 1921–22 season, while five- and ten-minute penalties were added two years later.

==Types of penalties==
Both the NHL and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) recognize the common penalty degrees of minor and major penalties, as well as the more severe misconduct, game misconduct, and match penalties.

===Quick reference chart===
===Minor penalty===
A minor penalty is the least severe type of penalty. A minor penalty is two minutes in length. The offending player is sent to the penalty box and in most cases, his team will play shorthanded. If the offending player is the goaltender or a coach the team is given a &quot;bench minor&quot; penalty (assessed against the team, rather than an individual player), then any skater who was on the ice at the time of the infraction may serve the penalty. In rare cases, when the offending player suffers an injury on the same play, whoever is on the ice at the time of the penalty may also serve the penalty, as was the case of Game 2 of the Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals&#x27; series during the 2017 Stanley Cup playoffs, when Phil Kessel served a penalty in place of Tom Kühnhackl.

A team with a numerical advantage in players will go on a power play. If they score a goal during this time, the penalty will end and the offending player may return to the ice. In hockey&#x27;s formative years, teams were shorthanded for the entire length of a minor penalty. The NHL changed this rule following the 1955–56 season where the Montreal Canadiens frequently scored multiple goals on one power play. Most famous was a game on November 5, 1955, when Jean Béliveau scored three goals in 44 seconds, all on the same power play, in a 4–2 victory over the Boston Bruins.

Coincidental (or &quot;matching&quot;) minor penalties occur when an equal number of players from each team are given a minor penalty at the same time. The permission of a substitute player depends on the league and the situation at the time of the infractions. In some leagues, such as the NHL, the teams will play four-on-four for the duration of the penalties if they occurred when both teams were at even strength. However, if there is already a manpower differential, then both teams are allowed to make substitutions while the penalized players will remain in the penalty box until the first stoppage in play after their penalty expires. In other competitions, such as IIHF events, coincidental penalties do not affect manpower in any situation. Coincidental minor penalties are not ended when a goal is scored by either team.

In some cases, a referee can impose a double or triple minor. The infraction is counted as two or three separate minor penalties. If a team scores a power play goal during such a penalty, only the current block of two minutes being counted down is cancelled; the penalty clock is then reset to the next lowest interval of two minutes (ex. a goal with a double-minor penalty clock at 3:45 is reset to 2:00). Expiration rules of double- or triple-minor penalties due to goals being scored are identical to that of regular minor penalties being served back-to-back.

===Major penalty===
A major penalty is a stronger degree of penalty for a more severe infraction of the rules than a minor. Most infractions which incur a major penalty are more severe instances of minor penalty infractions; one exception is fighting, which always draws a major. A player who receives a major penalty will remain off the ice for five minutes of play during which his team will be short-handed. A major penalty cannot end early even if a goal is scored against the short-handed team, unless the goal is scored during an overtime period (which ends the game). If major penalties are assessed to one player on each team at the same time, they may be substituted for, and teams will not be reduced by one player on the ice. The penalized players will remain in the penalty box until the first stoppage of play following the end of the penalties. This commonly occurs with majors for fighting.

Starting with the 2019–20 season, NHL referees are required to use on-ice video review for all major (non-fighting) penalties in order to either confirm the call or reduce the call to a minor penalty.

Under IIHF rules, every major penalty carries an automatic game misconduct penalty; in other competitions, earning three major penalties in a game results in a game misconduct penalty, though a number of infractions that result in a major penalty automatically impose a game misconduct as well.

Infractions that often call for a major penalty include spearing, fighting, butt-ending, charging, and boarding.

===Misconduct penalty===

A player who receives a misconduct penalty will remain off the ice for ten minutes. The player may be substituted for on the ice and may return to the ice at the first stoppage in play following the expiration of the penalty (unless other penalties were assessed); however, in practice, misconduct penalties are normally assessed along with two minute minor penalties (resulting in a penalty combination colloquially called a &quot;two-and-ten&quot;). If an additional penalty is incurred with a misconduct penalty, the times run concurrently (simultaneously), with another eligible player serving the other penalty in the offender&#x27;s place to enforce a disadvantage. For example, if a player receives a 2-minute minor plus a misconduct for boarding, two players will be sent to the penalty box: the offender and a teammate of his, frequently one who was on the ice at the time. The team is allowed to immediately substitute for the offender, so there is only a one-man disadvantage. Once the boarding penalty ends, the teammate can return to the ice, and both teams are at full strength again while the offender remains in the penalty box until the first stoppage in play after his/her ten minutes have elapsed. This is according to USA Hockey Rule 404(a) and NHL Rule 28. In the event the other penalty is a non-coincidental major, most adult leagues allow deferring placing the substitute player into the penalty box so long as he is in place before the major penalty expires (but the team must still play shorthanded). In such cases, only a player from the penalty box can emerge in place of the offender after the end of the major penalty.

Misconduct penalties are usually called to temporarily take a player off the ice and allow tempers to cool. They are sometimes also assessed in conjunction with fighting majors, giving the offending players the opportunity to calm down as they sit out their ten minutes.

IIHF rules state that a player who gets another misconduct penalty risks a game misconduct penalty and is ejected.

===Game misconduct penalty===
A player (whether a skater or goaltender) or any member of any team&#x27;s coaching staff who receives a game misconduct penalty is ejected, and is sent to the team&#x27;s dressing room. The player may be immediately substituted for on the ice; however, in practice, game misconduct penalties are often assessed as an addition to a particularly egregious infraction that has also earned the player a two-minute minor penalty or (more often) a five-minute major penalty, in which case another player will serve this penalty in place of the ejected player. Regardless of the time during the game that the penalty is given, the player is charged with ten penalty minutes (twenty in the IIHF rules) for statistical purposes for the game misconduct. This rule also applies to match penalties (see below).

In most leagues, the referee has the discretion to call a game misconduct on a player charged with boarding due to the likelihood of injury to the boarded player. However, in the NHL, if a boarded player suffers a head or facial injury (a concussion risk), the offending player receives an automatic game misconduct.

Any player who is dismissed twice for stick infractions, boarding or checking from behind, or dismissed three times for any reason, in a single NHL regular season incurs an automatic one-match ban, and further discipline is possible for subsequent ejections. For each subsequent game misconduct penalty, the automatic suspension shall be increased by one game. Salary lost as a result of a ban is usually donated to a league-supported charity or to a program to assist retired players.

Examples of a game misconduct penalty include getting out of the penalty box before the penalty time is served, trying to join or attempt to break up a fight [third man in] or earning a second misconduct penalty in the same game.

===Match penalty===
A player who receives a match penalty is ejected. A match penalty is imposed for deliberately injuring another player or attempting to injure another player. Many other penalties automatically become match penalties if injuries actually occur: under NHL rules, &quot;butt-ending, goalies using blocking glove to the face of another player, head-butting, kicking, punching an unsuspecting player, spearing,&quot; and &quot;tape on hands during altercation&quot; must be called as a match penalty if injuries occur. Under IIHF rules, match penalty used to be imposed for &quot;kneeing&quot; and &quot;checking to the head or neck area&quot; if injuries occurred; since the 2023/24 edition of IIHF rules, match penalty has been removed from the rules and a major penalty with a game misconduct penalty should be imposed for dangerous actions.

NHL referees are required to use on-ice video review for all match penalties in order to either confirm the call or reduce the call to a minor penalty.

The team of the offending player must choose a substitute player to place in the box from any of the eligible players, excluding the goaltender. The substitute serves a five-minute penalty similar to a major penalty (except in overtime, goals scored against the penalized team do not end the penalty early). If the goaltender receives a match penalty, another player serves the time so that the team may immediately insert a backup. In most cases, offending players are suspended from the next game their team plays, and often face hearings with the possibility of a lengthier ban. In the NHL, a match penalty and a game misconduct are virtually identical in application. However, a match penalty carries a larger fine, and the offending player is suspended indefinitely until the Commissioner rules on the issue.

In NCAA hockey, a similar penalty called a game disqualification results in automatic suspension for the number of games equal to the number of game disqualification penalties the player has been assessed in that season.

For statistical purposes, match penalty is counted as fifteen minutes in NHL (since 2022, previously ten minutes) and as twenty-five minutes under the IIHF rules.

Match penalties can also be used in cases where severe unsportsmanlike conduct has occurred, such as taunting that is offensive on the basis of race, sexual orientation, etc., as well as acts that are exceptionally disrespectful to an opponent or official regardless of whether or not an injury occurred. An example of this occurred when New York Rangers defenseman K&#x27;Andre Miller was assessed such a penalty for spitting on Los Angeles Kings defenseman Drew Doughty during a game at Madison Square Garden on February 26, 2023.

===Penalty shot===

A penalty shot is a special case of penalty for cases in which a scoring opportunity was lost as a result of an infraction (like being tripped or hooked while on a breakaway; or a player other than the goaltender covers the puck with his hand inside the crease). The player who was deprived of the opportunity (in cases the infraction was against him, for example, on breakaways), or one chosen by the team (in cases where the infraction is not against a specific player), is allowed an unchallenged opportunity to score on the opposing goaltender as compensation. If the infraction occurred when the penalized team has pulled their goalie and the infraction occurs during a breakaway, a goal is immediately awarded to the other team rather than a penalty shot. Regardless of whether or not the penalty shot is successful, the penalty is now treated as if a goal had been scored during that penalty; a minor penalty is negated, and a double-minor is reduced to a regular minor. Major, match, and misconduct penalties are served in their entirety as these are not affected by goals. If the non-offending team scores a goal in the delayed penalty situation, the penalty shot is not taken and the penalized team serves the time instead.

Apart from their use as a penalty, penalty shots also form the shootout that is used to resolve ties in many leagues and tournaments.

===Gross misconduct penalty===
Similar to a game misconduct in severity, gross misconduct penalties have been eliminated from the NHL rulebook. It was imposed for an action of extreme unsportsmanlike conduct, such as abuse of officials or spectators, and could be assessed to any team official in addition to a player. Infractions which garnered a gross misconduct now earn a game misconduct. The penalty had last been assessed in 2006 on Atlanta Thrashers coach Bob Hartley due to post-game comments made regarding referee Mick McGeough&#x27;s blown call during a game versus Edmonton. The Phoenix Coyotes&#x27; Shane Doan was the last player to be given a gross misconduct penalty in 2005 for alleged ethnic slurs directed at French-Canadian referees (later investigated and subsequently cleared by the NHL).

However, this penalty is still in effect in Canadian hockey. &quot;A Gross Misconduct penalty shall be assessed [to] any player or team official who conducts herself in such a manner as to make a travesty of the game.&quot;

* This penalty can be assessed for actions which include the consumption of alcohol prior or during the game.
* Where a player or team official becomes involved in a fight with a team official or spectator.
* Any player or team official who sprays water on or at an official
* Any player or team official who engages in verbal taunts based on discriminatory grounds (race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation)

==Enforcement of penalties==
The referees make most penalty calls. Linesmen may stop play and enforce only certain infractions (as defined by the rules governing the league in which they officiate), such as &quot;too many players on the ice&quot;. The official will initially put an arm in the air to signal a penalty; the official will stop play only once the offending team has control of the puck, or play is stopped by normal means. A &quot;delayed penalty&quot; is one in which the penalty is called but play is not yet stopped because the non-offending team retains the puck. Because the play will stop immediately upon the offending team gaining control of the puck, the goaltender of the non-offending team will often go to the players&#x27; bench upon seeing the arm signal to allow an extra attacker on the ice until the play is stopped. Because the offending team will not be able to take a shot on goal before the play is stopped, this is generally seen as a risk-free play. However, there have been instances in which the non-offending team accidentally puts the puck into their own net, usually on a failed backwards pass. Once the offending team touches the puck and the play is stopped, the referee will signal the specific infraction. If the penalized player was injured on the play and cannot return, another player on the team would serve the penalty if it involves a team being short-handed.

In the NHL, if the non-offending team scores a goal in a delayed penalty situation, then it is treated as if a goal was scored during that penalty. Thus, if the delayed penalty is a minor, the penalty is waved off. If the delayed penalty is a double-minor, only the first two-minute block is waved off, and the offending player must still serve the second time block. These rules used to be in college hockey as well, until the 2010–2011 season, when it was changed so that the penalty would still be imposed even if a goal was scored. Major penalties, misconduct penalties and match penalties, which are not affected by goals, are enforced in the usual manner, in both college hockey and the NHL, whether or not a goal is scored.

The offending player or players are sent to the penalty box where they must remain until the penalty has expired. Typically a team will not be allowed to replace the penalized player on the ice; the player will return directly to the ice once the penalty has expired. This creates a power play during which the penalized team will have one player fewer than their opponent and is said to be &quot;short-handed&quot;. If two players on a team are in the penalty box at the same time, the situation is called a &quot;five on three&quot; (as is customary, the goalies are not counted in this expression) or &quot;two-man advantage&quot;. Additional players may be penalized, but a team will never play with fewer than three skaters on the ice. Additional penalties will be delayed until one of the earlier penalties has expired (see stacked penalties below).

In leagues which play with a shorthanded overtime (with only three or four attackers on the ice), should a team be penalized with only three players on the ice, the penalized player may be immediately substituted by the offending team, but an additional skater is then allowed on the other team to create an advantage, until a five-on-three is produced. If a penalty in this situation expires without a goal being scored, the penalized player will be allowed back on the ice and will play normally until there is a stoppage; both teams will then be reduced back to the correct numbers. Ending coincidental penalties produce a similar situation, with both teams playing with additional players until play is stopped, allowing teams to be reduced again.

While goaltenders can be assessed penalties, a goaltender cannot go to the penalty box and the penalty must be instead served by another player from their team who was on the ice at the time of the infraction (the PIM will be charged to the goaltender). If the goaltender receives either (a) three major penalties (NHL Rule 28.2), (b) one &quot;game misconduct&quot; penalty (NHL Rule 28.4), or (c) one &quot;match&quot; penalty (NHL Rule 28.5) however, he or she is ejected for the remainder of the game and must be substituted.

While a team is short-handed, they are permitted to ice the puck as they wish, without having the icing infraction called against them. This allows short-handed teams to relieve pressure more easily when defending with fewer skaters than their opponents. This exemption does not apply to teams whose opponents have pulled their goaltender for an extra attacker (unless the defending team is killing a penalty at the same time).

===Stacked penalties===
A team must have a minimum of three skaters on the ice at all times. If an accumulation of penalties would otherwise force a team to fall below this minimum, the situation becomes known as &quot;stacked penalties&quot;. This means that the new penalty will start when one of the already-penalized players causing the disadvantage is allowed back onto the ice, whether the time expires or the opposing team scores on the power play. This also means that the player whose penalty expires first out of the three must wait for a stoppage in play, or the expiration of the second penalty, before leaving the penalty box so that it is appropriately 5 on 3, 5 on 4, and 5 on 5 in succession for each respective situation. Penalties that allow for immediate substitution (certain coincidental penalties and misconduct penalties) do not produce a disadvantage and thus do not count for stacked penalties. Stacked penalties still apply in shorthanded overtimes because two penalties still result in a five-on-three situation regardless of the initial lineup due to the rules allowing an extra attacker as needed.

===Final five minutes===
In a situation where there are fewer than five minutes remaining in play (the final five minutes of regulation time or the five minutes of regular season overtime), should unequal simultaneous penalties be assessed (a minor or double-minor penalty against one team and a major or match penalty against the other), then instead of both sides serving their full times (which is impossible in the case of the major/match penalty, as fewer than five minutes remain), the minor penalty is cancelled and its time subtracted from the major penalty, which is then assessed against that team.

In addition, under most leagues&#x27; &quot;fight instigator&quot; rules, a player penalized as a fight instigator in the final five minutes (or during overtime) is charged with a game misconduct penalty and further disciplinary action. This is intended to discourage &quot;revenge&quot; fights started by badly-losing teams.

==List of infractions==
In the NHL, infractions that result in penalties include:

; Abuse of officials : Arguing with, insulting, using obscene gestures or language directed at or in reference to, or deliberately making violent contact with any on or off-ice official. This generally is issued in addition to other penalties or as a bench penalty against a coach or off-ice player, and is grounds for ejection under a game misconduct or match penalty in most leagues including the NHL.
; : Assessed to a player who engages in a fight with an unwilling combatant. This is independent of the instigator penalty, and both are usually not assessed to the same player at one time (in that case the player&#x27;s penalty for fighting is usually escalated to attempt to injure, a match penalty).
; Attempt to injure: Deliberately trying to harm an opponent, in any manner. This type of infraction carries an automatic match penalty.
; Biting: Carries a major penalty (5:00) and game misconduct.
; Boarding: Pushing, tripping or checking an opposing player violently into the boards.
; (or Stabbing): Jabbing an opponent with the end of the shaft of the stick. It carries an automatic major penalty and game misconduct.
; Broken stick: Engaging in play while holding a broken stick.
; Charging: Taking more than three strides or jumping before hitting an opponent.
; : Hitting an opponent from behind is illegal. It carries an automatic minor penalty and misconduct, or a major penalty and game misconduct if it results in injury. See checking. This is generally allowed in the NHL unless it is covered by another infraction such as boarding or illegal check to the head.
; Clipping: Delivering a check below the knees of an opponent. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result.
; Cross-checking: Hitting an opponent with the stick when it is held with two hands and no part of the stick is on the ice.
; Delay of game:Stalling the game (for example, shooting the puck out of play from the defensive zone, holding the puck in the hand, refusing to send players out for a faceoff, or repeated deliberate offsides). Starting in the 2004–05 AHL season and advanced to the NHL in the a year later, an automatic delay of game penalty is charged to goaltenders that go into the corners behind the goal line (outside a trapezoid-shaped area just behind the net) to play the puck. Some delay of game offenses, such as taking too long to send players to take a faceoff, are not punished with a penalty: instead, the official may choose to eject the centre of the offending team from the face-off circle and order him replaced with another player already on the ice. An unsuccessful coach&#x27;s challenge will result in a minor penalty for delay of game for the first unsuccessful challenge and a double-minor penalty for each additional unsuccessful challenge.
; Diving (or &quot;embellishment&quot;) : Falling to the ice after a hit, exaggerating the effect of the hit in an attempt to draw a penalty for the opposing team.
; Elbowing: Hitting an opponent with the elbow. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result.
; Eye-gouging: Carries a major penalty and often a match penalty.
; Fighting: Engaging in a physical altercation with an opposing player, usually involving the throwing of punches with gloves removed. Minor altercations such as simple pushing and shoving, and punching with gloves still in place, are generally called as roughing.
; : Physically impeding or checking the goaltender. Visually impeding the goaltender&#x27;s view of the play with the body, called &quot;screening&quot;, is legal; but at no time may a goaltender be hit or checked.
; Goaltender leaving the crease: A goaltender may not leave the vicinity of his crease during an altercation. Once he has left the crease during an altercation, he may be given a penalty.
; Head-butting: Hitting an opponent with the head. A match penalty is called for doing so.

; High-sticking:Touching an opponent with the stick above shoulder level. A minor penalty is assessed to the player. If blood is drawn, a double-minor (4 minutes) is usually called. A common (yet false) belief is that blood drawn automatically warrants a double-minor. There is no such rule; this is, however, the precedent that has been in place for years. Referees may use their discretion to assess only a minor penalty even though blood was drawn. They may also assess a double-minor when blood is not drawn, if they believe that the player was sufficiently injured or that the offending player used excessively reckless action with his stick. If a player, while in the action of &quot;following through&quot; on a shot, strikes an opposing player in the head or face area with his stick, high sticking is not called unless the referee can determine that the player taking the shot was deliberately aiming to strike the opposing player. A penalty is also not called when the puck is hit by a high stick, but play will be stopped and the ensuing faceoff will take place at a spot which gives the non-offending team an advantage. Also, a goal that is scored by means of hitting the puck with a stick above the &quot;height of the crossbar&quot; will not be counted unless it is done by a player of the defending team. (Note that the requirements for high-sticking the puck for purposes of allowing/disallowing goal is different from the other forms of high-sticking.) NHL referees can use on-ice video review to confirm or overturn a double-minor high sticking call.
; : Grabbing an opponent&#x27;s body, equipment or clothing with the hands or stick. Generally a minor; USA Hockey rules call for a major and a game misconduct for grabbing and holding a facemask or visor.
; Holding the stick: Grabbing and holding an opponent&#x27;s stick, also called when a player deliberately wrenches a stick from the hands of an opposing player or forces the opponent to drop it by any means that is not any other infraction such as Slashing.
; Hooking: Using a stick as a hook to slow an opponent, no contact is required under new standards.
; : As of the start of the 2010–11 NHL season, any form of &quot;a hit to an opponent, where the player&#x27;s head is targeted and/or the principal point of contact&quot; is punishable with a combination five-minute major penalty and game misconduct, due to the increasing concern following concussion injuries to NHL players following incidents such as David Booth and Marc Savard&#x27;s concussions in the 2009–10 NHL season. A second incident of this type caused by the same player in a season (or post-season playoffs) results in an automatic suspension for the following game their team plays, with the potential for increasing durations of suspension from active play, for any subsequent checks to opposing players&#x27; head areas. The following season, it was changed to any hit to an opposing player&#x27;s head that is targeted and the principal point of contact. An illegal check to the head is punishable with either a two-minute minor penalty or a match penalty. In the 2013–14 NHL season, the rule was clarified to &quot;A hit resulting in contact with an opponent&#x27;s head where the head was the main point of contact and such contact to the head was avoidable is not permitted (known as illegal check to the head). As mentioned before, that is punishable with either a two-minute minor penalty or a match penalty.&quot;Rule 48 – Illegal Check to the Head&quot;
; : Using equipment that does not meet regulations, either by size (length, width) or number (two sticks) or other guidelines (e.g. a goaltender&#x27;s facemask can no longer be the &quot;Jason Voorhees&quot;-style form-fit mask, a skater may not have a stick with a curve exceeding 3/4&quot; (19 mm), nor may they play with a goaltender&#x27;s stick (a goaltender &quot;may&quot; play with a regular player&#x27;s stick). If a player (non-goaltender) breaks a stick, it is mandatory to drop the stick immediately and play without it until getting a replacement from the bench. Otherwise a penalty will be assessed to the offending player (some game summaries call this &quot;playing with a broken stick&quot;). In addition, in the NHL a player may not pick a broken stick up off the ground after it has been dropped (they can only receive a stick from another player or from the bench; goaltenders may not go to the bench but must have a stick carried out to them). This rule is generally not enforced in amateur leagues except for broken sticks or egregiously out-of-spec equipment, as the cost of acquiring gear that meets NHL specifications since a 2005 (and further in 2013) rule change is prohibitive, especially for goalies. Goaltenders will now receive a two-game suspension for the use of oversized equipment. Their teams will also be fined $25,000, the trainer will be docked $10,000, the coach and general manager fined $50,000 and the owner fined $100,000. 
; Instigator penalty: An instigator of an altercation is a player who demonstrates any of the following actions: distance travelled; gloves off first; first punch thrown; menacing attitude. A player deemed an instigator will receive an instigating minor penalty. A player who instigates a fight in the final five minutes of a game (or in overtime in the regular season) will instead be charged a game misconduct and given an automatic one-game suspension. The length of the suspension would double for each additional incident. The player&#x27;s coach will be fined $10,000, a penalty that would double for each recurrence.
; : Impeding an opponent who does not have the puck, or impeding any player from the bench. No contact is required under the new standards. 
; Joining a fight: Also called the &quot;third man in&quot; rule, the first person who was not part of a fight when it broke out but participates in said fight once it has started for any reason (even to pull the players apart) is charged with an automatic game misconduct in addition to any other penalties they receive for fighting.
; Kicking: Kicking an opponent with the skate or skate blade. Kicking carries a match penalty if done with intent to injure, but otherwise carries a major penalty and a game misconduct. (Under Hockey Canada rules, kicking or attempting to kick an opponent always carries a Match Penalty regardless of intent.)
; Kneeing : Hitting an opponent with the knee. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result.
; Leaving the penalty bench : A penalized player who leaves the penalty bench before his penalty has expired, whether play is in progress or not, shall incur an additional minor penalty after serving his unexpired penalty. Any player who, having entered the penalty bench, leaves the penalty bench prior to the expiration of his penalty for the purpose of challenging an official&#x27;s ruling, shall be assessed a game misconduct penalty. He shall also be automatically suspended for at least the next three regular league or playoff games of his club. A player exiting the penalty bench, or player&#x27;s bench, during an altercation or for the purpose of starting an altercation will be given a game misconduct, and suspended the next 10 games.
; Participating in the play beyond the centre red line (goaltender): A rare infraction, carries a minor penalty and is only assessed against the goaltender.
; Playing with too many sticks: When a player plays with more than one stick. For example, if a goaltender were to lose his stick and a player from his team skates over to pick up the goaltender stick and then, while skating back to the goaltender with both sticks, attempts to touch a live puck with either stick, will be called for playing with too many sticks.
; Roughing:Pushing or shoving after the whistle has been blown or when it takes place away from the play (often called against a player from each team, resulting in a coincidental minors situation, but can also be called on a single player); also called when the hands make contact with an opponent&#x27;s head/face on an otherwise legal check; called in non-checking leagues when a body check is made. Non-checking leagues may also refer to this as simply &#x27;body checking&#x27;. In the NHL, a minor penalty for roughing is assessed when a player intentionally removes the helmet of an opponent. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result.
; Secondary altercation : This infraction is not listed in the NHL Rulebook, but it is prevalent in the Central Hockey League (United States) and other minor leagues. It is most commonly issued when players engage in or attempt to engage in fight after the original fight (between two separate players). This infraction carries an automatic game misconduct penalty.
; : Swinging a stick at an opponent, no contact is required under new standards. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result.
; Slew footing : This occurs when a player uses his feet or knees to knock an opponent&#x27;s skates out from under him with a kicking or leg dragging motion from behind. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result. Slew footing as a separate infraction does not exist in the USA Hockey rulebook .
; : Stabbing an opponent with the stick blade. It carries an automatic major penalty and game misconduct.
; Starting the wrong lineup: This very rare bench minor penalty is assessed when the offending team&#x27;s starting lineup contains any player not listed in the lineup submitted before the game. For this to be called, the captain of the non-offending team must bring this breach of the rules to the referee&#x27;s attention immediately at the first stoppage of play. Also the penalty may be assessed if a player is not put on the scoresheet at the beginning of the game and plays. The only way for this to be called is if the official scorer notifies the referee of this oversight.
; Substitution infraction (Illegal Substitution) : This rare bench minor penalty is assessed when a substitution or addition is attempted during a stoppage of play after the linesmen have signaled no more substitutions (once the face-off is set) or if a team pulls its goaltender and then attempts to have the goaltender re-enter play at any time other than during a stoppage of play. Too many men on the ice and/or starting the wrong lineup can also simply be called a substitution infraction.
; Throwing the stick/Throwing stick/Throwing equipment : Often accompanied by a penalty shot. If any player on the ice who throws his stick or any part thereof or any other object (i.e. equipment) in the direction of the puck or an opponent in any zone, except when such act has been penalized by the assessment of a penalty shot or the awarding of a goal then a minor penalty will be assessed. Should any player, coach, or non-playing person on the players&#x27; bench or penalty bench throw anything on the ice during the progress of the game or during a stoppage of play, a bench minor penalty unsportsmanlike conduct shall be assessed. Can be upgraded to game misconduct or match penalty depending on severity.
; Too many men on the ice : Having more than the allowable number of players (six, including the goaltender, if not already short handed) on the ice involved in the play at any given time. &quot;Involved in the play&quot; is key; players that are entering the ice as substitutes for players coming off (line changing) may enter the ice once the player returning to the bench is less than five feet from his team&#x27;s bench (Rule 74.1); at that point the returning player is considered out of the play, even if the play passes in front of the bench, unless he actively makes a move for the puck. Players entering the ice are part of the play as soon as their skates touch the ice.
; Tripping: Using a stick or one&#x27;s body to trip an opponent, no contact is required under new standards. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result.
; Unsportsmanlike conduct : Arguing with a referee, fan, opponent or teammate; using slurs against an opponent, teammate or fan; playing with illegal equipment; making obscene gestures or abusing an official, fan, opponent or teammate. Can carry either a minor, major, misconduct, game misconduct or match penalty, depending on the gravity of the infraction (for instance, using obscene language to a referee initially results in a minor, but making an obscene gesture to an opponent, teammate, fan or official carries a game misconduct.) Also, in some leagues the penalty progression is different for players and team officials (for example, in the USA Hockey rulebook players get a minor for their first infraction, a misconduct for their second and a game misconduct for their third, whereas the option of a misconduct is removed for coaches; in addition, after each penalty for a team official, the penalty count resets itself). Unsportsmanlike conduct may also be called if a player drops gloves and stick in preparation for a fight, but the non-offending player does not drop the corresponding equipment and has committed no action (verbal or physical harassment) to attempt to instigate a fight. Since 2008, the NHL has ruled that standing in front of an opposing goaltender and engaging &quot;in actions such as waving his arms or stick in front of the goaltender&#x27;s face, for the purpose of improperly interfering with and/or distracting the goaltender&quot; will draw a minor unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, a rule interpretation inspired by the play of Sean Avery against Martin Brodeur.

*Cross-checking
*Deliberate injury (in any manner)
*Elbowing
*Goalkeeper who uses his blocking glove to the head or face of an opponent*
*Grabbing of the face mask
*Hair pulling
*Head-butting*
*High-sticking
*Illegal Check to the Head
*Kicking a player
*Kneeing
*Punching and injuring an unsuspecting opponent*
*Slashing
*Slew-footing
*Spearing*
*Throwing stick or any object
*Wearing tape on hands in altercation*

Other leagues typically assess penalties for additional infractions. For example, most adult social leagues and women&#x27;s hockey leagues ban all body checking (a penalty for roughing or illegal check is called), and in most amateur leagues, any head contact whatsoever results in a penalty. If a player commits a hair pulling violation on an opponent, they will be charged with a game misconduct penalty. The foul of moving the goalposts is handled differently from league to league; it has historically been a penalty shot, but after David Leggio began deliberately committing the foul to disrupt scoring opportunities, the American Hockey League declared such an act to be a game misconduct and the Deutsche Eishockey Liga automatically awarded the goal.

==Penalty records==
===NHL===

The NHL keeps individual statistics on the penalties each player accrues through the penalties in minutes statistic (abbreviated &quot;PIM&quot;). Players renowned for their fighting or for being dirty players will usually lead their team in PIM and have such statistics highlighted by the media.

The record for the most penalty minutes in one season is held by Dave Schultz of the Philadelphia Flyers, with 472 in the 1974–75 NHL season. The record for most penalty minutes in a career is held by Tiger Williams, who had 3,966 over 14 years. With Zdeno Chara&#x27;s retirement in 2022, no active player has more than 2,000 penalty minutes.

The most penalties in a single game occurred in a fight-filled match between the Ottawa Senators and Philadelphia Flyers on March 5, 2004, when 419 penalty minutes were handed out. Statistically, a game misconduct counts as 10 penalty minutes, in addition to other penalties handed out. In rare cases (as a result of multiple infractions, for instance the player participating in multiple fights), multiple game misconducts may be handed to a player — that is merely statistical, not (automatically) a multi-game suspension, although the league will often suspend the player in a subsequent decision.

===Kontinental Hockey League===
On 9 January 2010, a massive brawl broke out in an Avangard Omsk game against Vityaz Chekhov. The conflict started during pre-game warm-ups when Darcy Verot intentionally shot a puck at Lasse Kukkonen forcing Alexander Svitov to stand up for his teammate. Soon after the game started, Brandon Sugden challenged Svitov to another fight, which then involved all other eight skaters on the ice. A number of other fights ensued resulting in a bench- and penalty-box clearing. The officials had to suspend the game just after 3:39 in the first period, as there were only four players left to play the game. A world record total of 707 penalty minutes were incurred during the game. Some players were arrested by police. The Kontinental Hockey League imposed heavy fines on both teams, some players and the head coaches as well as disqualifying six of Vityaz&#x27;s players and Avangard&#x27;s Dmitry Vlasenkov, who was first to leave the bench during a fight. The game was counted as a 5–0 defeat for both teams with no points being awarded.

<doc id="567852" wikidata="Q658255" url="?curid=567852" title="Subsidiary">
<text>A subsidiary, subsidiary company, or daughter company is a company completely or partially owned or controlled by another company, called the parent company or holding company, which has legal and financial control over the subsidiary company. Unlike regional branches or divisions, subsidiaries are considered to be distinct entities from their parent companies; they are required to follow the laws of where they are incorporated, and they maintain their own executive leadership. Two or more subsidiaries primarily controlled by same entity/group are considered to be sister companies of each other.

Subsidiaries are a common feature of modern business, and most multinational corporations organize their operations via the creation and purchase of subsidiary companies. Examples of holding companies are Berkshire Hathaway, Jefferies Financial Group, The Walt Disney Company, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Citigroup, which have subsidiaries involved in many different fields. More focused companies include IBM, Xerox, and Microsoft; they and their subsidiaries primarily operate within the tech sector. These, and others, organize their businesses into national and functional subsidiaries, often with multiple levels of subsidiaries.

==Details==

Subsidiaries are separate, distinct legal entities for the purposes of taxation, regulation and liability. For this reason, they differ from divisions which are businesses fully integ
rated within the main company, and not legally or otherwise distinct from it. In other words, a subsidiary can sue and be sued separately from its parent and its obligations will not normally be the obligations of its parent. However, creditors of an insolvent subsidiary may be able to obtain a judgment against the parent if they can pierce the corporate veil and prove that the parent and subsidiary are mere alter egos of one another. Thus any copyrights, trademarks, and patents remain with the subsidiary until the parent shuts down the subsidiary.

Ownership of a subsidiary is usually achieved by owning a majority of its shares. This gives the parent the necessary votes to elect their nominees as directors of the subsidiary, and so exercise control. This gives rise to the common presumption that 50% plus one share is enough to create a subsidiary. There are, however, other ways that control can come about, and the exact rules both as to what control is needed, and how it is achieved, can be complex (see below). A subsidiary may itself have subsidiaries, and these, in turn, may have subsidiaries of their own. A parent and all its subsidiaries together are called a corporate, although this term can also apply to cooperating companies and their subsidiaries with varying degrees of shared ownership.

A parent company does not have to be the larger or &quot;more powerful&quot; entity; it is possible for the parent company to be smaller than a subsidiary, such as DanJaq, a closely held family company, which controls Eon Productions, the large corporation which manages the James Bond franchise. Conversely, the parent may be larger than some or all of its subsidiaries (if it has more than one), as the relationship is defined by control of ownership shares, not the number of employees. 
The parent and the subsidiary do not necessarily have to operate in the same locations or operate the same businesses. Not only is it possible that they could conceivably be competitors in the marketplace, but such arrangements happen frequently at the end of a hostile takeover or voluntary merger. Also, because a parent company and a subsidiary are separate entities, it is entirely possible for one of them to be involved in legal proceedings, bankruptcy, tax delinquency, indictment or under investigation while the other is not.

== Tiered subsidiaries ==
In descriptions of larger corporate structures, the terms &quot;first-tier subsidiary&quot;, &quot;second-tier subsidiary&quot;, &quot;third-tier subsidiary&quot;, etc. describe multiple levels of subsidiaries. A first-tier subsidiary is a subsidiary/child company of the ultimate parent company, while a second-tier subsidiary is a subsidiary of a first-tier subsidiary: a &quot;grandchild&quot; of the main parent company. Consequently, a third-tier subsidiary is a subsidiary of a second-tier subsidiary—a &quot;great-grandchild&quot; of the main parent company.

The ownership structure of the small British specialist company Ford Component Sales, which sells Ford components to specialist car manufacturers and OEM manufacturers, such as Morgan Motor Company and Caterham Cars, illustrates how multiple levels of subsidiaries are used in large corporations:
* Ford Motor Company – U.S. parent company based in Dearborn, Michigan
** Ford International Capital LLC – First-tier subsidiary (U.S. holding company located in Dearborn, Michigan, but registered in Delaware)
*** Ford Technologies Limited – Second-tier subsidiary (British holding company, located at the Ford UK head office in Brentwood, Essex, with five employees)
**** Ford Motor Company Limited – Third-tier subsidiary (the main British Ford company, with head office in Brentwood, with 10,500 employees)

==Control==
===General===

The word &quot;control&quot; and its derivatives (subsidiary and parent) may have different meanings in different contexts. These concepts may have different meanings in various areas of law (e.g. corporate law, competition law, capital markets law) or in accounting. For example, if Company A purchases shares in Company B, it is possible that the transaction is not subject to merger control (because Company A had been deemed to already control Company B before the share purchase, under competition law rules), but at the same time Company A may be required to start consolidating Company B into its financial statements under the relevant accounting rules (because it had been treated as a joint venture before the purchase for accounting purposes).

Control can be direct (e.g., an ultimate parent company controls the first-tier subsidiary directly) or indirect (e.g., an ultimate parent company controls second and lower tiers of subsidiaries indirectly, through first-tier subsidiaries).

===European Union===
Recital 31 of Directive 2013/34/EU stipulates that control should be based on holding a majority of voting rights, but control may also exist where there are agreements with fellow shareholders or members. In certain circumstances, control may be effectively exercised where the parent holds a minority or none of the shares in the subsidiary.

According to Article 22 of the directive 2013/34/EU an undertaking is a parent if it:
* has a majority of the shareholders&#x27; or members&#x27; voting rights in another undertaking (a subsidiary undertaking);
* has the right to appoint or remove a majority of the members of the administrative, management or supervisory body of another undertaking (a subsidiary undertaking) and is at the same time a shareholder in or member of that undertaking;
* has the right to exercise a dominant influence over an undertaking (a subsidiary undertaking) of which it is a shareholder or member, pursuant to a contract entered into with that undertaking or to a provision in its memorandum or articles of association, where the law governing that subsidiary undertaking permits its being subject to such contracts or provisions.
* is a shareholder in or member of an undertaking, and:
** a majority of the members of the administrative, management or supervisory bodies of that undertaking (a subsidiary undertaking) who have held office during the financial year, during the preceding financial year and up to the time when the consolidated financial statements are drawn up, have been appointed solely as a result of the exercise of its voting rights; or
** controls alone, pursuant to an agreement with other shareholders in or members of that undertaking (a subsidiary undertaking), a majority of shareholders&#x27; or members&#x27; voting rights in that undertaking.
Additionally, control may arise when:
* a parent undertaking has the power to exercise, or actually exercises, dominant influence or control over another undertaking (the subsidiary undertaking); or
* a parent undertaking and another undertaking (the subsidiary undertaking) are managed on a unified basis by the parent undertaking.

Under the international accounting standards adopted by the EU a company is deemed to control another company only if it has all the following:
* power over the other company;
* exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the other company; and
* the ability to use its power over the other company to affect the number of the company&#x27;s returns (IFRS 10 para 7). Power generally arises when the parent has rights that give it the ability to direct the relevant activities, i.e. the activities that significantly affect the other subsidiary&#x27;s returns.

A subsidiary can have only one parent; otherwise, the subsidiary is, in fact, a joint arrangement (joint operation or joint venture) over which two or more parties have joint control (IFRS 11 para 4). Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.

===United Kingdom===
The Companies Act 2006 contains two definitions: one of &quot;subsidiary&quot; and the other &quot;subsidiary undertaking&quot;.

According to s.1159 of the Act, a company is a &quot;subsidiary&quot; of another company, its &quot;holding company&quot;, if that other company:
* holds a majority of the voting rights in it, or
* is a member of it and has the right to appoint or remove a majority of its board of directors, or
* is a member of it and controls alone, pursuant to an agreement with other members, a majority of the voting rights in it, or if it is a subsidiary of a company that is itself a subsidiary of that other company.

The second definition is broader. According to s.1162 of the Companies Act 2006, an undertaking is a parent undertaking in relation to another undertaking, a subsidiary undertaking, if:
* it holds a majority of the voting rights in the undertaking, or
* it is a member of the undertaking and has the right to appoint or remove a majority of its board of directors, or
* it has the right to exercise a dominant influence over the undertaking—
** by virtue of provisions contained in the undertaking&#x27;s articles, or
** by virtue of a control contract, or
* it is a member of the undertaking and controls alone, pursuant to an agreement with other shareholders or members, a majority of the voting rights in the undertaking.

An undertaking is also a parent undertaking in relation to another undertaking, a subsidiary undertaking, if:
* it has the power to exercise, or actually exercises, dominant influence or control over it, or
* it and the subsidiary undertaking are managed on a unified basis.

The broader definition of &quot;subsidiary undertaking&quot; is applied to the accounting provisions of the Companies Act 2006, while the definition of &quot;subsidiary&quot; is used for general purposes.

===Oceania===
In Oceania, the accounting standards defined the circumstances in which one entity controls another. In doing so, they largely abandoned the legal control concepts in favour of a definition that provides that &quot;control&quot; is &quot;the capacity of an entity to dominate decision-making, directly or indirectly, in relation to the financial and operating policies of another entity so as to enable that other entity to operate with it in pursuing the objectives of the controlling entity&quot;. This definition was adapted in the Australian Corporations Act 2001: s 50AA. Furthermore, it can be a useful part of the company that allows every head of the company to apply new projects and latest rules.

<doc id="567859" wikidata="Q7458782" url="?curid=567859" title="Sexual inhibition">
<text>A sexual inhibition is a conscious or subconscious constraint or curtailment by a person of behavior relating to specific sexual matters or practices, a discussion of sexual matters or viewing certain sexual material. To some extent such inhibitions may arise from cultural and social influences and conditioning, as well as from personal factors, including sexual orientation. In most partner relationships, the level of inhibition tends to decrease the higher the level of trust that develops between the partners. Such inhibitions also tend to decrease with improvements in a person&#x27;s confidence in their sexuality. A person may take a drug, such as alcohol, to reduce their level of inhibition.

Though a person can be regarded as being sexually inhibited if they irrationally fear or are excessively averse to any sexual practice or discourse, the term is normally not applied to a person who refrains from certain sexual activities on moral and rational grounds (such as desire to avoid pregnancy or contracting a disease) or due to a psychological disorder. A person may also refrain from sexual activity with a particular person by choice or because of a simple disliking of that particular activity or person, for whatever reason. The person whose advances are rejected may dismiss the rejection as being due to sexual inhibition.

On the other hand, a person may be regarded as having low sexual inhibitions when they welcome a variety of non-conventional erotic practices. Hypersexuality is typically associated with lowered sexual inhibitions, and alcohol and some drugs can affect a person&#x27;s social and sexual inhibitions.

==Examples==
Some inhibitions are expressed in terms of preferences for specific sexual practices and may be based on cultural attitudes. For example, cultural attitudes toward oral sex range from aversion to high regard. It has been considered taboo, or at least discouraged, in many cultures and parts of the world, especially with regard to fellatio. People give various reasons for their dislike of oral sex. Some state that since it does not result in reproduction, it is therefore unnatural. Others find it less intimate because it is not a face-to-face practice, or believe that it is a humiliating or unclean practice; that it is humiliating or unclean are opinions that are, in some cases, connected with the symbolism attached to different parts of the body.

Sexual inhibitions among female same-sex sexual relationships have also been studied. The belief that all women who have sex with women engage in oral sex (i.e., cunnilingus) is a misconception; some lesbian or bisexual women dislike cunnilingus due to not liking the experience or due to psychological or social factors, such as finding it unclean. Other lesbian or bisexual women believe that it is a necessity or largely defines lesbian sexual activity. Lesbian couples are more likely to consider a woman&#x27;s dislike of cunnilingus as a problem than heterosexual couples are, and it is common for them to seek therapy to overcome inhibitions regarding it.

A female who cannot conceive by normal means and requires assistance to conceive may be constrained by social and sexual inhibitions and taboos from accepting a sperm donor or a friend to perform an intravaginal insemination, and the friend may be similarly inhibited; the friend may opt instead for the more expensive and arduous artificial insemination.

A fear of being nude in front of others can be regarded as a sexual inhibition. Some people feel uncomfortable being nude in front of another person, even in private with their sex partner. For example, a person may feel comfortable being nude only during a sexual activity, and then only with subdued lighting, or covered by a sheet or blanket. Some people decline medical examinations that involve disrobing. In an interview in March 2007, Halle Berry said that her toplessness in &quot;Swordfish&quot; (2001) was &quot;gratuitous&quot; to the movie, but that she needed to do the scene to get over her fear of nudity, and that it was the best thing she did for her career. Having overcome her inhibitions, she went on to a role in &quot;Monster&#x27;s Ball&quot;, which included a nude scene. In 2002, Eva Green in her first film role needed director Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s guidance during the filming of the nude and sex scenes in &quot;The Dreamers&quot; (2003), but was embarrassed when her family saw the film. Some actresses prefer not to expose their bodies to others and use a body double even for exposure of breasts.

<text>The Muskoka River is a river in the Muskoka District of Ontario, Canada. The river is the third largest river draining the southern Ontario land mass by average annual flow.

It rises in the highlands of Algonquin Park and flows southwest through a number of lakes including
*Lake Muskoka
*Lake Joseph
*Lake Rosseau
*Lake of Bays
which empty into Georgian Bay south of Parry Sound by way of the Moon and Musquash Rivers.

Tributaries include the:
* Indian River
* Hollow River
* Oxtongue River
* Buck River
* East River

Communities on the river include:
*Bracebridge, Ontario
*Huntsville, Ontario

The name &quot;Muskoka&quot; comes from the name of a chief of the Ojibwa in this region, &quot;Mesqua Ukee&quot; (&quot;Miskwaa-aki&quot;: Red Earth).

==In fiction==
There is also a Muskoka River in Nancy Drew&#x27;s fictional home town of River Heights, located somewhere in the Midwestern United States.

<doc id="567874" wikidata="Q150840" url="?curid=567874" title="Ishirō Honda">
<text>was a Japanese filmmaker who directed 46 feature films in a career spanning five decades. He is acknowledged as the most internationally successful Japanese filmmaker prior to Hayao Miyazaki and one of the founders of modern disaster film, with his films having a significant influence on the film industry. Despite directing many drama, war, documentary, and comedy films, Honda is best remembered for directing and co-creating the &quot;kaiju&quot; genre with special effects director Eiji Tsuburaya.

Honda entered the Japanese film industry in 1934, working as the third assistant director on Sotoji Kimura&#x27;s &quot;The Elderly Commoner&#x27;s Life Study&quot;. After 15 years of working on numerous films as an assistant director, he made his directorial debut with the short documentary film &quot;Ise-Shima&quot; (1949). Honda&#x27;s first feature film, &quot;The Blue Pearl&quot; (1952), was a critical success in Japan at the time and would lead him to direct three subsequent drama films.

In 1954, Honda directed and co-wrote &quot;Godzilla&quot;, which became a box office success in Japan and was nominated for two Japanese Movie Association awards. Because of the film&#x27;s commercial success in Japan, it spawned a multimedia franchise, recognized by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the longest-running film franchise in history, that established the &quot;kaiju&quot; and &quot;tokusatsu&quot; genres. It helped Honda gain international recognition and led him to direct numerous &quot;tokusatsu&quot; films that are still studied and watched today.

After directing his eighth and final &quot;Godzilla&quot; film in 1975, Honda retired from filmmaking. However, Honda&#x27;s former colleague and friend, Akira Kurosawa, would persuade him to come out of retirement in the late 1970s and act as his right-hand man for his last five films.

==Early life==
=== Childhood and youth (1911–1921) ===

Honda was born in Asahi, Yamagata Prefecture (now part of the city of Tsuruoka), the fifth and youngest child of Hokan and Miyo Honda. His father Hokan was the abbot of Honda Ryuden-in temple. Honda stated that his forename was a combination derived from three words: &quot;&#x27;I&#x27; stands for &quot;inoshishi&quot;, the boar, the astrological symbol of my birth year. &quot;shi&quot; stands for the number four, the fourth son. And &quot;ro&quot; indicates a boy’s name. Literally, it means the fourth son, born in the year of the boar.&quot; He had three brothers: Takamoto, Ryokichi, Ryuzo, and one sister: Tomi, who died during her childhood. Honda&#x27;s father and grandfather were both Buddhist monks at Churen-ji, a temple in Mount Yudono, where the Hondas lived in a dwelling on the temple&#x27;s property. The Hondas grew rice, potatoes, daikon radishes, and carrots, and also made and sold miso and soy sauce. The family also received income from a silk moth farm managed by one of Honda&#x27;s brothers. Honda&#x27;s father earned income during the summers by selling devotions in Iwate Prefecture, Akita Prefecture, and Hokkaido and would return home before the winter.

While Honda&#x27;s brothers were given religious tutoring at sixteen, Honda was learning about science. Takamoto, who became a military doctor, encouraged Honda to study and sent him scientific magazines to help, which started Honda&#x27;s love for reading and scientific curiosity. In 1921, when Honda was ten, Hokan became the abbot at Io-ji temple in Tokyo, and the family moved into the Takaido neighborhood in Suginami. Though he was an honors student back home, Honda&#x27;s grades declined in Tokyo and in middle school; he struggled with subjects involving equations such as chemistry, biology, and algebra.

After his father transferred to another temple, Honda enrolled in the Tachibana Elementary school in Kawasaki and later in Kogyokusha Junior High where Honda studied kendo, archery, and athletic swimming but quit after tearing his Achilles tendon.

=== Film education (1931–1934) ===
Honda became interested in films when he and his class-mates were assembled to watch one of the Universal Bluebird photoplays. Honda would often sneak into movie theatres without his parents&#x27; permission. For silent films in Japan at that time, on-screen texts were replaced with benshi, narrators who stood beside the screen and provided live commentary, which Honda found more fascinating than the films themselves. Honda&#x27;s brother, Takamoto, had hoped for Honda to become a dentist and join his clinic in Tokyo but instead, Honda applied at Nihon University for their art department&#x27;s film major program and was accepted in 1931. The film department was a pilot program, which resulted in disorganized poor conditions for the class and cancellations from the teacher every so often. While this forced other students to quit, Honda instead used the cancelled periods to watch films at theaters, where he took personal notes.

Honda and four of his class-mates rented a room in Shinbashi, a few kilometers from their university, where they would gather after school to discuss films. Honda had hoped for the group to collaborate on a screenplay but they mainly just socialized and drank. Honda attended a salon of film critics and students but hardly participated, preferring rather to listen. While in school, Honda met Iwao Mori, an executive in charge of production for Photographic Chemical Laboratories (P.C.L.) In August 1933, Mori offered entry-level jobs at P.C.L. to a few students, including Honda. Honda eventually completed his studies while working at the studio and became an assistant director, which required him to be a scripter in the editing department. Honda eventually became a third assistant director on Sotoji Kimura&#x27;s &quot;The Elderly Commoner&#x27;s Life Study&quot; (1934). However, Honda then received a draft notice from the military.

=== Military service and marriage (1934–1946) ===

At twenty-three years old, Honda was drafted into the Imperial Japanese Army in the fall of 1934. Despite receiving a passing grade on his physical examination, he was not required to report for immediate duty. While waiting for his call-up, Honda continued working at P.C.L. Honda was then called to duty in January 1935 and was enlisted into the First Division, First Infantry Regiment in Tokyo. At the time, Honda began his training at the entry-level rank of Ippeisotsu, the equivalent of Petty Officer First Class.

In 1936, Honda&#x27;s former commanding officer, Yasuhide Kurihara, launched a coup against the civilian government, what would be called the February 26 Incident. Though Honda had no involvement with the coup, everyone associated with Kurihara were considered dangerous and the brass wanted them gone and as a result, Honda and his regiment were sent to Manchukuo in 1936, under questionable pretense. Honda would have completed his 18 remaining months of service had it not been for the coup and would be recalled to service again and again for the remainder of the war.

Honda met Kimi Yamazaki in 1937 and proposed marriage to her in 1939. Honda&#x27;s parents and Kimi&#x27;s mother were supportive, but Kimi&#x27;s father was opposed to the sudden engagement. Though Kimi&#x27;s father never approved of her marriage, he nonetheless sent her ¥1,000 upon learning of her pregnancy. Rather than having a traditional wedding ceremony, the two simply signed papers at city hall, paid their respects at Meiji Shrine, and went home. Since their marriage, the couple lived in Seijo in Setagaya, even after the war. Kimi would pass away on November 3, 2018, aged 101. This was also &quot;Godzilla&quot;&#x27;s 64th anniversary.

Honda was recalled to service in mid-December 1939, a week before his daughter, Takako, was due to be born. Having already risen in rank, Honda was able to visit his wife and daughter in the hospital but had to leave afterwards immediately to China. Between 1940 and 1941, Honda was assigned to manage a &quot;comfort station&quot;, a euphemism for brothels established in occupied areas. Honda would later write an essay titled &quot;Reflections of an Officer in Charge of Comfort Women&quot; published in &quot;Movie Art Magazine&quot; in April 1966, detailing his experiences and other comfort women&#x27;s experiences working in comfort stations.

Honda would then return home in December 1942, only to find that P.C.L. (now rebranded as Toho by that point) were forced to produce propaganda films to support the war effort. The government took control of the Japanese film industry in 1939, modeling the passage of motion picture laws after Nazi policies where scripts and films were reviewed so they supported the war effort and filmmakers noncompliant were punished or worse. Honda&#x27;s son, Ryuji, was born on 31 January 1944, however, Honda received another draft notice in March 1944. He was assigned to head for the Philippines but his unit missed the boat and were sent back to China instead. To Honda&#x27;s fortune, the conflict in China was less intense than it was in the Pacific and South-East Asia. Honda became a sergeant and was in charge of trading and communicating with civilians. Honda never ordered the Chinese as a soldier and was respectful to them as much as possible.

Honda was eventually captured by the Chinese National Revolutionary Army and relocated to an area between Beijing and Shanghai for a year before the war ended. During his imprisonment, Honda stated to have been treated well and was even befriended by the locals and temple monks, who offered him to stay permanently but Honda respectfully refused in favor of finding his wife and children. As a parting gift, the locals gave Honda rubbings of Chinese proverbs, imprinted from stone carvings of temples. Honda would later write these verses in the back of his screenplays.

During his final tour, Honda escaped death near Hankou when a mortar shell landed before him but did not detonate. When the battle ended, Honda later returned to retrieve the shell and took it back home to Japan where he placed it on top of his desk in his private study until his death. Honda then returned home in March 1946; however, throughout most of his life, even as an old man, Honda would have nightmares about the war twice or thrice a year. During his entire military service, Honda served three tours, with a total of six years serving at the front.

==Career==
===1940s===

Honda returned to work at Toho as an assistant director. In 1946, he worked on two films: Motoyoshi Oda&#x27;s &quot;Eleven Girl Students&quot; and Kunio Watanabe&#x27;s &quot;Declaration of Love&quot;. In 1947, he worked on three films, &quot;24 Hours in an Underground Market&quot; (jointly directed by Tadashi Imai, Hideo Sekigawa, and Kiyoshi Kusuda) and &quot;The New Age of Fools&quot; Parts One and Two, directed by Kajirō Yamamoto. Due to a labor dispute at Toho, many stars and employees split off and formed Shintoho. Kunio Watanabe tried to convince Honda to join Shintoho, with the promise of Honda becoming a director quicker, however, Honda chose to remain neutral and stayed at Toho. Despite struggling at Toho, Honda worked on a handful of films produced by Film Arts Associates Productions. Between September and October 1948, Honda was on location in Noto Peninsula working on Kajirō Yamamoto&#x27;s &quot;Child of the Wind&quot;, the first release from Film Arts. From January to March 1949, Honda worked with Yamamoto again on &quot;Flirtation in Spring&quot;.

Prior to being promoted to a feature film director, Honda had to direct documentaries for Toho&#x27;s Educational Films Division. Toho sometimes used documentary projects as tests for assistant directors due to become directors. Honda&#x27;s directorial debut was the documentary &quot;Ise-Shima&quot;, a twenty-minute highlight reel of Ise-Shima&#x27;s cultural attractions. It was commissioned by local officials to boost tourism to the national park. The film covers a brief history of the Ise Grand Shrine, the local people, the economy, and pearl farms. The film is also notable for being the first Japanese film to utilize underwater photography successfully. Honda originally wanted to use a small submarine-like craft but the idea was scrapped due to budget and safety concerns. Instead, professional divers assisted with the production. Honda had commissioned a camera technician colleague who designed and built an air-tight, waterproof, metal-and-glass housing for a compact 35-millimeter camera. The documentary was completed in July 1949 and became a triumph for Toho. The documentary was then sold to multiple European territories. It disappeared for a long time until it resurfaced on Japanese cable television in 2003. Between July and September 1949, shortly after finishing &quot;Ise-Shima&quot;, Honda reunited with his friend Akira Kurosawa on &quot;Stray Dog&quot; and began working as a chief assistant director on the film. Honda mainly directed second unit photography, all of the footage pleased Kurosawa and has stated to &quot;owe a great deal&quot; to Honda for capturing the film&#x27;s post-war atmosphere.

===1950s===
In 1950, Honda worked on two films by Kajirō Yamamoto: &quot;Escape from Prison&quot; and &quot;Elegy&quot;, the last film produced by Film Art Associations. Honda had also worked as an assistant director on Senkichi Taniguchi&#x27;s &quot;Escape at Dawn&quot;.

Between working on films as an assistant director, Honda began pre-production on &quot;Newspaper Kid&quot;, which would have been his feature directorial debut. However, the project was canceled. Instead, he began working on another documentary titled &quot;Story of a Co-op&quot; (also known as &quot;Flowers Blooming in the Sand&quot; and &quot;Co-op Way of Life&quot;) &quot;Story of a Co-op&quot; was a documentary about the rise of consumer cooperatives in post-war Japan. It was also written by Honda, with the production overseen by Jin Usami and with the support of the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Some records indicated that some animation was used to explain the functions of co-ops but these reports have been unconfirmed. The film was completed on 6 October 1950 and has since been lost. However, Honda recalled that the film was successful enough to convince Toho to assign Honda his first feature film.

Between filming the documentaries, Toho had offered Honda the chance to develop and direct a war film titled &quot;Kamikaze Special Attack Troop&quot;. Toho then chose not to proceed with the project after finding Honda&#x27;s script, which openly criticized leaders of World War II, to be too grim and realistic. Honda recalled that the studio felt it was &quot;too soon after the war&quot; to produce such a film. Had the project proceeded, it would have been Honda&#x27;s first directorial feature. The script has since been lost.

At the age of 40, Honda completed his first feature film &quot;The Blue Pearl&quot;. Released on 3 August 1951, it was one of the first Japanese feature films to utilize underwater photography and the first studio film to be shot in the Ise-Shima region.

Honda initially chose not to direct war films, but changed his mind after Toho offered to have him direct &quot;Eagle of the Pacific&quot;, a film about Isoroku Yamamoto, a figure with whom Honda shared the same feelings regarding the war. It was the first film where Honda collaborated with Eiji Tsuburaya. &quot;Eagle of the Pacific&quot; was a box-office hit and reportedly was Toho&#x27;s first postwar film to earn over (approximately ). Subsequently, Honda would direct another war film, entitled &quot;Farewell Rabaul&quot;, which was released on February 10, 1954.
A month after the release of &quot;Farewell Rabaul&quot;, Honda met assistant director Kōji Kajita to commence production on a film titled &quot;Sanshiro the Priest&quot;. Possibly connected to Kurosawa&#x27;s 1943 film &quot;Sanshiro Sugata&quot;; Hideo Oguni, one of Kurosawa&#x27;s frequent collaborators, wrote the script for the film. Authors Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski stated that the project never came to fruition because Oguni and Honda &quot;couldn&#x27;t see eye to eye about the screenplay&quot;. According to Kajita, the film would have been about a priest and a judo expert.

Following the cancellation of a highly anticipated drama film titled &quot;In the Shadow of Glory&quot;, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka quickly converted the idea of a giant monster film. He was influenced by reports of a nuclear test in the Pacific that caused a Japanese fishing boat to be exposed to nuclear fallout, with disastrous results, and had heard of a recently released American monster film &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot;. Honda accepted the offer to direct the film after planned &quot;In the Shadow of Glory&quot; director Taniguchi declined the assignment. Honda and screenwriter Takeo Murata confined themselves in a three-week secluded residence at an inn in Tokyo&#x27;s Shibuya ward to write the screenplay for this film, entitled &quot;Godzilla&quot;. The film was Honda&#x27;s first &quot;kaiju&quot; film, the genre for which he would become most famous. The simple story, about a giant monster that rises near Odo Island and attacks Tokyo causing catastrophic destruction, is a metaphor for a nuclear holocaust.

Principal photography for &quot;Godzilla&quot; began on August 2, 1954, and wrapped in late September, taking 51 days. It became a box office success in Japan and was nominated for two Japanese Movie Association awards: winning an award for best special effects but losing to Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; for best picture. Because of the film&#x27;s success in Japan, it spawned a multimedia franchise, being recognized by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the longest-running film franchise in history. Two years later, a heavily localized version of &quot;Godzilla&quot; was released in the United States as &quot;Godzilla, King of the Monsters!&quot;.

Honda&#x27;s next film was &quot;Lovetide&quot;, based on Hidemi Kon&#x27;s story &quot;Blow, River Wind&quot; and adapted by screenwriter Dai Nishijima. Toho promoted the film by calling it a &quot;gorgeous love melodrama with Toho&#x27;s best cast, meant for all the woman fans&quot;. The film&#x27;s stars Mariko Okada and Chieko Nakakita (Tanaka&#x27;s wife) also played in Mikio Naruse&#x27;s film &quot;Floating Clouds&quot;, featuring a similar plot and released around a week after &quot;Lovetide&quot;. Tanaka had stated that if he had not made Honda predominantly direct science-fiction films, he would have become &quot;a director like Mikio Naruse.&quot;

During the start of production on Motoyoshi Oda&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot;, Honda began filming &quot;Half Human&quot; in the Japanese Alps. Upon his return to Tokyo, Tsuburaya was working on &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot;. Thus, production on &quot;Half Human&quot; was halted and Honda moved on to shooting a drama film titled &quot;Mother and Son.&quot; Principal photography for &quot;Half Human&quot; recommenced in June, and the film was released on August 14, 1955, around a month after filming concluded. &quot;Half Human&quot; has been infrequently seen following its release. Ryfle and Godziszewski noted this is possibly due to Toho fearing the mountain tribe, described by Nobuo Nakamura&#x27;s character as &quot;mysterious &quot;buraku&quot;&quot;, is depicted in the film as &quot;an uncivilized, primitive colony of subhuman freaks&quot;, could enrage &quot;burakumin&quot;&#x27;s rights groups such as the Buraku Liberation League. Some sources suggest it was aired on television in the 1960s or early 1970s and was screened at a film retrospective in Kyoto in 2001. Toho has never released the complete film in any home video format.

In 1956, Honda directed four films. The first, &quot;Young Tree&quot;, concerns a young girl who moves to Tokyo and endures the rivalries between other high school girls of varying economic and cultural backgrounds. The second, entitled &quot;Night School&quot;, was his solo film ever directed outside of Toho and was among the first films about night schooling. The third, titled &quot;People of Tokyo, Goodbye&quot;, follows young lovers who try to listen to their hearts despite their parents&#x27; interjections. The fourth, &quot;Rodan&quot;, was Honda&#x27;s first-ever film shot in color and depicted a winged monster named Rodan wreaking havoc in Japan after its awakening by nuclear bomb testing.

Although Japanese cinema is known for its samurai films, Honda did not show any interest in directing a &quot;jidaigeki&quot; film since his stage was contemporary Japan. Nonetheless, in May 1956, Kurosawa reported that he would produce three &quot;jidaigeki&quot; films beginning that September, with Honda directing &quot;Throne of Blood&quot;, Hideo Suzuki directing &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot;, and Hiromichi Horikawa directing &quot;Revenge&quot; (became &quot;Yojimbo&quot;). Kurosawa would eventually direct all three of these films; now regarded as some of his best films.

The year 1957 marked a turning point in Honda&#x27;s directing career, as he directed five films, with his first, &quot;Be Happy, These Two Lovers&quot;, filmed by Hajime Koizumi, who would work on 21 of his films thereon. Ryfle and Godziszewski called his camera work &quot;the perfect complement to Honda&#x27;s conservative, risk-averse style of composition&quot;.

His next film, &quot;A Teapicker&#x27;s Song of Goodbye&quot;, was the second in Honda&#x27;s trilogy of films starring &quot;enka&quot; singer Chiyoko Shimakura (the first film was &quot;People of Tokyo, Goodbye&quot;). The third film in the trilogy, entitled &quot;A Farewell to the Woman Called My Sister&quot;, was released the month after &quot;A Teapicker&#x27;s Song of Goodbye&quot;. &quot;A Rainbow Plays in My Heart&quot;, a black-and-white two-part film based on Seiichi Yashiro and Ryunosuke Yamada&#x27;s radio drama of the same name, was released on July 9, 1957 (a week after &quot;A Teapicker&#x27;s Song of Goodbye&quot;). The film is notable for being the third and final film featuring &quot;Godzilla&quot; stars Momoko Kochi and Akira Takarada in leading roles.

Honda&#x27;s only &quot;tokusatsu&quot; film of 1957, &quot;The Mysterians&quot;, was released just over a year after Japan joined the United Nations and features affairs reflecting the Japan&#x27;s return to global politics. The story concerned a young scientist (Kenji Sahara) who becomes involved in a globally threatening alien invasion. The film was shot on an enormous budget of and was his debut movie to be filmed in Toho Scope.

&quot;Song for a Bride&quot;, released in February 1958, is regarded as one of the director&#x27;s best films of the 1950s. It is a comedy-drama film that explores the clash between traditional and modern ethics among Japanese youth. Following its release, Honda would direct two science fiction films in the same year for the first time. His second film of 1958, &quot;The H-Man&quot;, premiered on June 24, 1958 to mixed reviews. It is a distinctive Honda picture about a liquid creature who terrorizes Tokyo&#x27;s gangland. Some scenes in the film were shot on the same sets used in Kurosawa&#x27;s 1948 film &quot;Drunken Angel&quot;. In May 1959, Columbia Pictures released a shortened version of this film in the United States. Upon its release, U.S. critics erroneously believed it was a rip-off Irvin Yeaworth&#x27;s &quot;The Blob&quot;, despite &quot;The H-Man&quot; being released prior to &quot;The Blob&quot; in Japan.

The successful distributions of Honda&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Rodan&quot; in the United States, lead Toho to seek further Hollywood connections. In 1957, the company agreed to co-produce a made-for-television film with AB-PT Pictures (who would go bankrupt during production). This project would eventually become a black-and-white theatrical feature film directed by Honda, entitled &quot;Varan the Unbelievable&quot;, released in 1958. Considered his &quot;weakest effort&quot;, it is a simple story about scientists who unintentionally awake a giant monster dubbed Varan while seeking scarce species of butterfly in Tōhoku region.

&quot;An Echo Calls You&quot;, his twenty-third feature film, centers on an uneducated bus conductor, Tamako, who falls in love with Nabeyama, her bus driver after she fails to have a relationship with a man from Kōfu&#x27;s wealthiest family. Featuring Ryō Ikebe in his fourth major role in a Honda movie, and with a possibly &quot;Hideko the Bus Conductor&quot;-inspired screenplay by Gorō Tanada, the film premiered in January 1959 to generally positive reviews from critics.

Honda quickly moved on to his next project, &quot;Inao, Story of an Iron Arm&quot;. It is a biographical film based on the life of professional baseball pitcher Kazuhisa Inao, featuring Inao portraying himself as an adult. Additionally, it features &quot;Godzilla&quot; actors Takashi Shimura as his father and Ren Yamamoto and Sachio Sakai as his older brothers. The film was released in March 1959 and was later screened in honor of Inao following his death in 2007.

===1960s and 1970s===

In 1962, Honda returned to directing &quot;Godzilla&quot; films beginning with &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot;. Honda would go on to direct five additional Godzilla films during the 1960s: &quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla&quot; (1964), &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot; (1964), &quot;Invasion of Astro-Monster&quot; (1965), &quot;Destroy All Monsters&quot; (1968), and &quot;All Monsters Attack&quot; (1969), the latter which Honda also served as director of special effects. His other &quot;tokusatsu&quot; films during the 1960s include: &quot;Mothra&quot; (1961), &quot;Matango&quot; (1963), &quot;Frankenstein vs. Baragon&quot; (1965), &quot;The War of the Gargantuas&quot; (1966), and &quot;King Kong Escapes&quot; (1967). While Honda managed to retain a job directing for Toho during the 1960s and 1970s, the studio did not renew his contract near the end of 1965 and was instructed to speak with Tanaka about employment on a film-by-film basis. In 1967, Honda began occasionally directing for television, since it had become more popular than the film industry in Japan.

Between 1971 and 1973, Honda directed several episodes for the television series &quot;Return of Ultraman&quot;, &quot;Mirrorman&quot;, &quot;Emergency Command 10-4, 10-10&quot;, &quot;Thunder Mask&quot;, and &quot;Zone Fighter&quot;, and would only direct two films during the 1970s: &quot;Space Amoeba&quot; (1970) and &quot;Terror of Mechagodzilla&quot; (1975); Honda would temporarily retire following the release of the latter film.

=== Final works and last years (1979–1993) ===

==== Collaborating with Akira Kurosawa (1979–1992) ====
Despite retiring in 1975, Honda was persuaded by Akira Kurosawa to return to filmmaking, and collaborate on &quot;Kagemusha&quot; (1980). Honda would subsequently work on Kurosawa&#x27;s last five films. His positions in these films included: directorial advisor, production coordinator, and creative consultant; he also made uncredited writing contributions to &quot;Madadayo&quot; (1993). There is a misconception that Honda directed &quot;The Tunnel&quot; sequence of Kurosawa&#x27;s 1990 film &quot;Dreams&quot;. In the early 1980s, Honda was approached to potentially direct a reboot of &quot;Daimajin&quot; reboot. While Honda expressed interest, the project never materialized and Honda was already involved with &quot;Kagemusha&quot;.

==== Declining health and death (1992–1993) ====

In late 1992, Akira Kurosawa hosted a party for the cast and crew of &quot;Madadayo&quot; following the completion of principal photography. Honda appeared to be suffering from cold symptoms at the party and contacted his son Ryuji in New York. Ryuji believed Honda was drunk and thought it strange that he called him. Then, in mid-February 1993, Kurosawa, Honda, and Masahiko Kumada, the unit manager, attended a screening of &quot;Agantuk&quot;, Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray&#x27;s last film, at an art-house cinema. After watching the film, Kurosawa invited Honda to his house for dinner and drinks, but Honda felt sick and went home. Honda was declared healthy following a checkup in December 1992, and no major illnesses were suspected. Although his cough kept getting worse, his family doctor diagnosed him with a common cold. Initially, Honda stayed in bed for a week, but after he lost his appetite, he underwent X-rays and blood tests. Honda was immediately told to seek hospital treatment following the results. Knowing something was wrong with his health, Honda had already packed his bags. Within ten minutes of leaving home, he was taken to Kono Medical Clinic, a 19-bed facility in Soshigaya. Because the major hospitals were full, he was placed in a tiny room.

A room in a bigger hospital was about to be assigned to Honda, so his friends could visit him. In the following days, Honda contracted pleurisy, a condition that causes difficulty breathing, and on February 27, just after returning home from visiting hours, Kimi and Takako received an urgent call: his vital signs had suddenly deteriorated. Honda died from respiratory failure at 11:30 pm on February 28, 1993. A memorial service was held at Joshoji Kaikan, an assembly hall in Setagaya, for Honda&#x27;s friends, family, and colleagues on March 6. Honda&#x27;s funeral reunited Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune, an actor who had starred in both Honda&#x27;s and Kurosawa&#x27;s early films. &quot;The Nikkei&quot; reported that Mifune was among the mourners at the funeral: &quot;[Kurosawa and Mifune] made eye contact and hugged in tears at the funeral for their mutual friend.&quot;

Honda&#x27;s cremated remains were buried at Tama Cemetery, the largest municipal cemetery in Japan. His family later moved the grave to Fuji Cemetery.

===Television===
== Style ==
Despite being known primarily for directing &quot;tokusatsu&quot; films, Honda has also directed documentaries, melodramas, romance, musical, and biographical films. Unlike Akira Kurosawa, who often used recurring themes and photographic devices (even sometimes going over time and budget on productions), Honda was a filmmaker who almost always finished his projects requested by Toho on time and budget; &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1954) was one such project. &quot;Godzilla&quot; assistant director Kōji Kajita stated that during their 17 films that they made together Honda &quot;had his own style, this way of thinking&quot;, adding: &quot;he never got mad, didn’t rush, but he still expressed his thoughts and made it clear when something was different from what he wanted, and he corrected things quietly.&quot; Thus, his skill earned him the nickname &quot;Honda the Amylase&quot;.

=== Direction ===
Authors, cast, and crew members have called Honda&#x27;s style of direction &quot;well-established&quot;. Special effects director Teruyoshi Nakano stated that the events happening during his &quot;running crowd&quot; sequences, such as &quot;Firefighters being dispatched in an emergency situation, police officer directing traffic, and people carrying &quot;furoshiki&quot; while running away&quot;, are &quot;unrealistic&quot; but it was important for Honda to &quot;bring out the everydayness by showing such things&quot;. According to actor Yoshio Tsuchiya, Kurosawa said that if he were to direct a scene in one of Honda&#x27;s films featuring police officers directing civilians, he would &quot;make even the police officers flee first.&quot; Regarding this, Honda said that the policemen featured in his films do not run away because of his war experience as an officer. Hiroshi Koizumi said that, during the filming of &quot;Mothra&quot;, Honda was focusing to appear in a scene where a civilian helped the baby on the bridge.

==Legacy==
===Reputation in the film industry===
Many filmmakers have been influenced by Honda&#x27;s work. According to Steve Ryfle, his influence inside the film industry is &quot;undeniable&quot;, as he was &quot;one of the creators of the modern disaster film, he helped set the template for countless blockbusters to follow, and a wide array of filmmakers&quot;. In 2007, Quentin Tarantino called Honda his &quot;favorite science-fiction director&quot;. Tarantino is also one of several filmmakers and actors who have cited Honda&#x27;s &quot;The War of the Gargantuas&quot; as an influence, alongside Brad Pitt, Guillermo del Toro, and Tim Burton. John Carpenter cited &quot;Godzilla&quot; as an influence on his career and called Honda &quot;one of my personal cinematic gods&quot;. Martin Scorsese has also cited Honda as an influence on his work.

===In popular culture===
The episode, &quot;Tagumo Attacks!!!&quot; in the television series &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot; is based around Honda. The central plotline of the episode involves a kraken-esque creature named Tagumo, that Honda has written, which becomes a reality due to a magic book that belongs to Brigid, the Celtic goddess of art. It is described as a &quot;land octopus&quot; that will destroy Tokyo, unless the protagonists can stop it. At the end of the episode, the character, Mick Rory tells Ishirō to &quot;Forget about the octopus. Lizards. Lizards are king.&quot; In this fictional universe, this will lead Ishirō to creating the character Godzilla, as he states in the episode &quot;The King... of the Monsters. I like that&quot;. Honda, alongside Ray Harryhausen, was given dedications in the 2013 film &quot;Pacific Rim&quot;.

In his acclaimed 2023 film &quot;Godzilla Minus One&quot;, filmmaker and visual effects artist Takashi Yamazaki paid homage to Honda&#x27;s work.

=== Lawsuit and dispute ===
In October 2011, Honda&#x27;s family began suing Toho and three other companies involved in the 2010 &quot;pachinko&quot; game &quot;CR Godzilla: Descent of the Destruction God&quot;, requesting . On November 26, 2013, it was disclosed that the lawsuit had been settled. An industry insider suggested that Toho wanted the lawsuit dealt with before the release of &quot;Godzilla&quot; (2014).

Conflict between Toho and Honda Film Inc.—the company led by Honda&#x27;s son Ryuji—had been ongoing since February 2010 when Ryuji sent a letter to Toho saying that the family believed it unfair that Toho claimed &quot;Honda does not have any rights to the Godzilla character&quot; and requested that they oversee and authorize all projects involving the character henceforth. Toho dismissed his claim as unnecessary, stating that they &quot;have never received any objections&quot; from Honda nor his widow Kimi regarding Godzilla&#x27;s copyright ownership. Talks between the two companies reportedly escalated thereafter. On May 14, 2010, Toho argued that Tanaka and Shigeru Kayama had a larger role in the creation of the character, alleging that both of whom had agreed that Toho is the copyright owner. Honda Film responded on April 23 by stating Honda nevertheless directed and co-wrote the original film and thus was responsible for the creature&#x27;s &quot;visual aspects&quot;, adding: &quot;As director and screenwriter, Director Honda determined the internal character setting of Godzilla, such as his history and personality, that appears in &quot;Godzilla&quot;, and expressed it concretely. Therefore, Director Honda is the author of Godzilla (as a character)&quot;. Honda&#x27;s family eventually extracted their ownership claims in October 2011, shortly before the &quot;pachinko&quot; lawsuit started.

<text>Paula Vogel (born November 16, 1951) is an American playwright. She is known for her provocative explorations of complex social and political issues. Much of her work delves into themes of psychological trauma, abuse, and the complexities of human relationships. She has received the Pulitzer Prize as well as nominations for two Tony Awards. In 2013 she was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

Vogel started her career with the off-Broadway play &quot;How I Learned to Drive&quot; which earned her the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. The play was revived on Broadway in 2022, earning her a Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play nomination. She wrote the Off-Broadway plays &quot;The Baltimore Waltz&quot; (1992), &quot;Hot &#x27;N Throbbing&quot; (1994), &quot;The Mineola Twins&quot; (1996), and &quot;The Long Christmas Ride Home&quot; (2003). She made her Broadway debut with &quot;Indecent&quot; in 2017, which earned her a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Play. She returned to Broadway with her latest play &quot;Mother Play&quot; (2024). 

A longtime teacher, Vogel spent the bulk of her academic career – from 1984 to 2008 – at Brown University, where she served as Adele Kellenberg Seaver Professor in Creative Writing, oversaw its playwriting program, and helped found the Brown/Trinity Rep Consortium. From 2008 to 2012, Vogel was Eugene O&#x27;Neill Professor of Playwriting and department chair at the Yale School of Drama, as well as playwright in residence at the Yale Repertory Theatre.

== Early life and education ==
Vogel was born in Washington, D.C., to Donald Stephen Vogel, an advertising executive, and Phyllis Rita (Bremerman), a secretary for the United States Postal Service Training and Development Center. Her father was Jewish, whereas her mother was Roman Catholic. She attended Bryn Mawr College from 1969 to 1970 and 1971 to 1972, and is a graduate of The Catholic University of America (BA, 1974) and Cornell University (MA, 1976; PhD, 2016).

== Career ==
=== 1992–2014: Early works and breakthrough ===
A productive playwright since the late 1970s, Vogel first came to national prominence with her AIDS-related seriocomedy &quot;The Baltimore Waltz&quot;, which won the Obie Award for Best Play in 1992. She is best known for her Pulitzer Prize-winning play &quot;How I Learned to Drive&quot; (1997), which examines the impact and echoes of child sexual abuse and incest. Other notable plays include &quot;Desdemona, A Play About A Handkerchief&quot; (1993), &quot;The Oldest Profession&quot; (1981), &quot;And Baby Makes Seven&quot; (1984), &quot;Hot &#x27;N Throbbing&quot; (1994), and &quot;The Mineola Twins&quot; (1996).

Her play &quot;The Oldest Profession&quot; was first read in February 1981 at the Hudson Guild, New York City, directed by Gordon Edelstein. The play premiered in April 1988 at Theatre Network in Edmonton, Canada and 25th Street Theatre in Saskatoon, Canada, directed by Tom Bentley-Fisher. Subsequent productions include a reading at Brown University in April 1990 and a production by Company One in Hartford, Connecticut in October 1991. The play premiered Off-Broadway in September 2004 in a Signature Theatre Company production.

&quot;And Baby Makes Seven&quot; premiered Off-Broadway in April 1993, produced by the Circle Repertory Company at the Lucille Lortel Theatre. The cast featured Peter Frechette, Cherry Jones and Mary Mara. It was first produced by Theatre with Teeth, New York City, in January 1984, directed by Vogel. It was then produced at Theatre Rhinoceros, San Francisco, in February 1986, directed by Kris Gannon. &quot;Desdemona&quot; was first produced by the Bay Street Theatre Festival, Sag Harbor, New York in July 1993 and then was produced Off-Broadway by the Circle Repertory Company in November 1993. The productions starred J. Smith-Cameron as Desdemona and Cherry Jones as Bianca.

Second Stage Theatre produced &quot;How I Learned to Drive&quot; in February 2012, the first New York City production of the play in 15 years. &quot;A Civil War Christmas&quot; was presented Off-Broadway at the New York Theatre Workshop, from November 13, 2012, to December 30, 2012. The play was directed by Tina Landau and featured Alice Ripley and Bob Stillman. The play was nominated for the 2013 Lucille Lortel Award, Outstanding Director (Landau) and Outstanding Costume Design, (Toni-Leslie James) and won the Lortel Award for Outstanding Lighting Design (Scott Zielinski). Artists Repertory Theatre, located in Portland, Oregon, presented &quot;A Civil War Christmas: An American Musical Celebration&quot;, from November 22 to December 23, 2016.

=== 2015–present: Broadway debut ===
Vogel&#x27;s first play with music, &quot;Indecent&quot;, co-created and directed by Rebecca Taichman, premiered at Yale Repertory Theatre on October 2, 2015, and then ran at La Jolla Playhouse (San Diego) in November 2015. &quot;Indecent&quot; was a finalist for the 2016 Edward M. Kennedy Prize for Drama.

The play premiered Off-Broadway at the Vineyard Theatre, running from April 27, 2016 (previews), officially on May 17, 2016, and closing on June 19, 2016. The play was nominated for the 2016 Lucille Lortel Award, Outstanding Play. &quot;Indecent&quot; premiered on Broadway at the Cort Theatre on April 4, 2017, in previews, and opened April 18. The Off-Broadway cast, featuring Adina Verson and Katrina Lenk, reprised their roles in the Broadway production, with additional cast including Ben Cherry, Andrea Goss, and Eleanor Reissa. The play has music composed by Lisa Gutkin and Aaron Halva. The play is being produced by Vineyard Theatre in association with La Jolla Playhouse and Yale Repertory Theatre. This marks Vogel&#x27;s Broadway debut. The play &quot;is inspired by the real-life controversy surrounding the 1923 Broadway production of Sholem Asch&#x27;s &quot;God of Vengeance&quot;, the love story of two women.&quot; &quot;Indecent&quot; was nominated for the 2017 Outer Critics Circle Awards: Outstanding New Broadway Play, Rebecca Taichman as Outstanding Director of a Play, Outstanding Lighting Design, Outstanding Projection Design (Tal Yarden), Outstanding Featured Actor In A Play (Richard Topol), and Outstanding Featured Actress In A Play (Katrina Lenk). The play was nominated for the 2017 Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Play and Outstanding Lighting Design for a Play (Christopher Akerlind).

Vogel premiered a new work titled &quot;Mother Play&quot; on Broadway as part of Second Stage Theater&#x27;s 2023-2024 season.

==Style and themes==
Although no particular theme or topic dominates her work, she often examines traditionally controversial issues such as sexual abuse and prostitution. Asserting that she &quot;writes the play backwards,&quot; moving from emotional circumstances and character to craft narrative structure, Vogel says, &quot;My writing isn&#x27;t actually guided by issues... I only write about things that directly impact my life.&quot; Vogel adds, &quot;If people get upset, it&#x27;s because the play is working.&quot; These issues appear in Vogel&#x27;s &quot;Desdemona&quot; (1994), where the narrative of a brothel is used to give female characters agency, or &quot;give back to Desdemona power to accompany her activity.&quot; Vogel&#x27;s family, especially her late brother Carl Vogel, influences her writings. Vogel says, &quot;In every play, there are a couple of places where I send a message to my late brother Carl. Just a little something in the atmosphere of every play to try and change the homophobia in our world.&quot; Carl&#x27;s likeness appears in such plays as &quot;The Long Christmas Ride Home&quot; (2003), &quot;And Baby Makes Seven&quot;, and &quot;The Baltimore Waltz&quot;. 

&quot;Vogel tends to select sensitive, difficult, fraught issues to theatricalize,&quot; theatre theorist Jill Dolan comments, &quot;and to spin them with a dramaturgy that&#x27;s at once creative, highly imaginative, and brutally honest.&quot; Her work embraces theatrical devices from across several traditions, incorporating, in various works, direct address, bunraku puppetry, omniscient narration, and fantasy sequences. Critic David Finkel finds this breadth in Vogel&#x27;s career to be reflective of a general tendency toward stylistic reinvention from work to work. &quot;This playwright recoils at the notion of writing plays that are alike in their composition,&quot; Finkel writes. &quot;She wants each play to be different in texture from those that have preceded it.&quot;

== Academic and teacher ==
Vogel, a renowned teacher of playwriting, counts among her former students Susan Smith Blackburn Prize-winner Bridget Carpenter, Obie Award-winner Adam Bock, MacArthur Fellow Sarah Ruhl, and Pulitzer Prize-winners Nilo Cruz, Lynn Nottage, Dipika Guha, and Quiara Alegría Hudes.

During her two decades leading the graduate playwriting program and new play festival at Brown University, Vogel helped develop a nationally recognized center for educational theatre, culminating in the creation of the Brown/Trinity Repertory Company Consortium with Oskar Eustis, then Trinity&#x27;s artistic director, in 2002. She left Brown in 2008 to assume her positions as adjunct professor and the Chair of the playwriting department at Yale School of Drama, which she held until 2012, and the Playwright-in-Residence at Yale Repertory Theatre. She is currently the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Professor (adjunct) of Playwriting at Yale School of Drama and playwright-in-residence at the Yale Repertory Theatre, as well as an artistic associate at Long Wharf Theatre. Vogel previously served as an instructor at Cornell University during her graduate work in the mid-1970s.

== Personal life ==
Vogel had two brothers: Carl, who died of AIDS in 1988, and Mark. Carl is eponym for the Carl Vogel Center in Washington, D.C., founded by their father Don Vogel. The center is a service provider for people living with HIV.

Vogel married Brown University professor and author Anne Fausto-Sterling in Truro, Massachusetts, on September 26, 2004.

== Theatrical works ==
As a playwright 
== Awards and honors ==
Subsequent to her Obie Award for Best Play (1992) and Pulitzer Prize in Drama (1998), Vogel received the Award for Literature from The American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2004. She won a Robert Chesley Award in 1997. She won the 1998 Susan Smith Blackburn Prize for &quot;How I Learned to Drive.&quot; In 1999, Vogel received the PEN/Laura Pels International Foundation for Theater Award for a playwright in mid-career.

In 2003, the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival created an annual Paula Vogel Award in Playwriting for &quot;the best student-written play that celebrates diversity and encourages tolerance while exploring issues of dis-empowered voices not traditionally considered mainstream.&quot; In 2013, Vogel was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

In 2016, Vogel successfully completed and defended her doctoral thesis at Cornell University, more than 40 years after she began her graduate work. She was awarded her Ph.D. in Theatre Arts in May. Vogel received the 2017 Obie Award for Lifetime Achievement. Vogel is featured in the book &quot;50 Key Figures in Queer US Theatre&quot; (2022), with a profile written by theatre scholar Sara Warner.

In 2015 Paula Vogel&#x27;s literary archive was obtained by the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University, and she became the first female playwright included in the library&#x27;s Yale Collection of American Literature.

<text>Sherbrooke is a rural community on the Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia, Canada, in Guysborough County. It is located along the St. Mary&#x27;s River, a major river in Nova Scotia. The community is named for Sir John Coape Sherbrooke, a colonial era Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia. Gold was discovered in the area in 1861 and Sherbrooke entered a gold rush which lasted two decades. The economy of the community today revolves around fishing, tourism and lumber. The community is the site of an open-air museum called &quot;Sherbrooke Village&quot; which depicts life in the later 1800s in the wake of the gold rush era.

==Geography==
Sherbrooke is nestled between Sherbrooke Lake and St. Mary&#x27;s River. The river was named for Fort Sainte-Marie, a French-built fort which was later taken over and destroyed by the British, and is renowned for its angling and its run of wild Atlantic salmon. Over the past decades the population of Atlantic salmon has decreased dramatically, and fishing of Atlantic salmon is strictly prohibited, as is catch and release.

The St. Mary&#x27;s River is home to hundreds of different wildlife species, from the smallest insects to the many different predators. The St. Mary&#x27;s River has a length of over and has three main branches, the east branch, the west branch, and the north branch. The branch feeds into the main river located by Sherbrooke, which then empties into the Atlantic Ocean. The St. Mary&#x27;s River is home to the famous Atlantic Salmon, but as listed above they are no longer allowed to be fished due to their critically low population.

The river is also home to bald eagles which make their home on old dead trees along the St. Mary&#x27;s River, because of the food that await in the water below. If you are lucky, you may get to see one perched on an old tree as you drive along the St. Mary&#x27;s River. Other common birds to see along the river are Osprey, Great-horned owls, and a wide range of hawks. Another resident of the St. Mary&#x27;s River is the wood turtle, which is a protected species. Surveys have been done along the St. Mary&#x27;s River to learn the wood turtle population, their diet, habitat, and breeding grounds. A common species of fish to see in the river and its many estuaries is the Speckled Brook Trout, which as makes its home in sheltered waters and underneath logs that have fallen in the brooks. The brook trout is also a food source for many of the birds along the St. Mary&#x27;s River.

==History==
Charles Baye de La Giraudière established a fort along the banks of the St. Mary&#x27;s River in 1650, named Fort Sainte-Marie. The fort was captured by the British in 1669. James Fisher and his three sons from New Hampshire were among the first settlers of the community in 1805. The community is named in honour of Sir John Coape Sherbrooke, a colonial era Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia. A schoolhouse was established in the community in 1815 and by 1818, two sawmills, a gristmill and a post office were present in the community, along with about twenty houses. A jail was opened in the community in 1827 and a courthouse was established in the community in 1858. A Presbyterian meeting house was established in the community in 1832. St. James&#x27; Anglican Church was built in the community in 1850 and was consecrated on August 15, 1885. St. Paul&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, built in nearby Goldenville in 1871, was moved to Sherbrooke in 1907. Two new schoolhouses were built in 1850s and 1860s respectively.

Gold was discovered in the area in 1861. Sherbrooke and surrounding communities benefited from one of several gold rushes. Miners came from all over Canada and the United States to stake a claim in the gold of the Sherbrooke area. Goldenville, being the most popular for miners, was a boom town. Previously as populous as it is today, in a very short time it grew to many times its previous size. The gold rush lasted about 20 years.

Mining was revived in the 20th century, but it did not achieve the success of previous operations. Following the gold rush era, the economy for the area turned from gold mining to fishing, tourism, and lumber. St. Mary&#x27;s Memorial Hospital was opened on September 28, 1949 and St. Mary&#x27;s Rural High School opened on November 14, 1953.

==Amenities==
Sherbrooke has an RCMP detachment, a Nova Scotia Liquor Commission store, and St. Mary&#x27;s Memorial Hospital, which serves the District of St. Mary&#x27;s. Saint Marys Education Centre/Academy (SMECA) is located in Sherbrooke. It serves grades primary-12 and covers the entirety of St. Mary&#x27;s. The school was constructed in 2013, from the amalgamation of St. Mary&#x27;s Academy (SMA) and St. Mary&#x27;s Education Centre (SMEC).

===Sherbrooke Village===

Sherbrooke is the site of a regional heritage site and tourist attraction known as Sherbrooke Village, an open-air museum depicting village life in the late 19th century. Founded in 1969 and part of the Nova Scotia Museum system, Sherbrooke Village employs a significant number of local residents, estimated to around 100 full-time and seasonal workers. There are approximately 30 historic buildings including a working blacksmith shop, a pottery shop, a water powered lumber mill, which is located off site, a tea room (restaurant), and several animal barns which contain sheep, horses, cow, chickens, turkeys, and peafowl or peacocks. It also has an Ambrotype photo studio which has operated continuously each summer since 1976. Sherbrooke village is the largest component of the Nova Scotia Museum complex. It is open in the summer months from June to October and at select times during the rest of the year.

Around the end of November there is a Christmas tree lighting called &quot;An Old Fashioned Christmas&quot; that takes place in the Village. After the tree is lit, a walk down the main street of Sherbrooke follows; this leads down through Sherbrooke Village towards the ball field. Local groups throughout the St. Mary&#x27;s Municipality decorate the doors of the buildings in the village. A community group also decorates the remaining parts of Sherbrooke Village.
