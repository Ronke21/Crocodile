<text>The Supermarine Walrus is a British single-engine amphibious biplane designed by Supermarine&#x27;s R. J. Mitchell. Primarily used as a maritime patrol aircraft, it was the first British squadron-service aircraft to incorporate an undercarriage that was fully retractable, crew accommodation that was enclosed, and a fuselage completely made of metal.

Supermarine originally named the type the Supermarine Seagull V, before changing it to the &quot;Walrus&quot;. The type first flew in 1933, its design process had begun four years earlier as a private venture. It shared its general arrangement with that of the earlier Supermarine Seagull. Having been designed to serve as a fleet spotter launched by catapult from cruisers or battleships, the aircraft was employed as a maritime patrol aircraft. Early aircraft had a metal hull for greater longevity in tropical conditions, while the later variant, the Supermarine Walrus II, had a wooden hull to conserve the use of light alloys.

The Supermarine Seagull V entered service with the Royal Australian Air Force in 1935. The type was subsequently adopted by the Fleet Air Arm, the Royal Air Force (RAF), the Royal New Zealand Navy, and the Royal New Zealand Air Force. Walruses operated against submarines throughout the Second World War, and were also used by the RAF Search and Rescue Force to recover personnel from the sea. It was intended to replace the Walrus with the more powerful Supermarine Sea Otter, but this did not happen. After the end of the war the Walrus continued in service, and some aircraft operated in a civil capacity in regions such as Australia and the Antarctic. The Walrus was succeeded in its air-sea rescue role by the first generation of helicopters.

==Development==
The Supermarine Walrus, originally called the Supermarine Seagull V, was initially developed by Supermarine as a private venture in response to a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) requirement for an observation seaplane to be catapult-launched from cruisers. Designed by a team led by Supermarine&#x27;s chief designer, R.J. Mitchell, it resembled Mitchell&#x27;s earlier Supermarine Seagull III in general layout. 

Supermarine began construction of a prototype during 1930, but due to other, more pressing, commitments did not complete it until 1933. The prototype of the Seagull V, known as the Type 228, following modifications to the design, was first flown by &quot;Mutt&quot; Summers on 21 June 1933. Five days later, the aeroplane (now marked &quot;N-1&quot;) made an appearance at the SBAC show at Hendon, where Summers made an unscheduled loop during the display, startling the spectators (Mitchell included).

On 29 July Supermarine handed the aircraft (re-marked as &quot;N-2&quot;) over to the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment at Felixstowe. Over the following months extensive trials took place; including shipborne trials aboard the HMS &quot;Repulse&quot; and the HMS &quot;Valiant&quot; carried out on behalf of the Royal Australian Navy. There were also catapult trials carried out by the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, when the Seagull V became the first piloted aircraft in the world to be launched by catapult, piloted by Flight Lieutenant Sydney Richard Ubee.
The strength of the aircraft was demonstrated in October 1935, when a Seagull V carrying the Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet, Roger Backhouse, landed in the water in Portland Harbour with its wheels unretracted. The aircraft&#x27;s hull flooded following the impact of the landing, which caused it to flip over, but Backhouse and the crew managed to escape with minor injuries. An automatic horn and indicator lights were subsequently fitted to ensure the pilot checked the wheels before landing. The machine was later repaired and returned to service. Soon afterwards it became one of the first aircraft to be fitted with an undercarriage position indicator on the instrument panel. Test pilot Alex Henshaw later stated that the Walrus was strong enough to make a wheels-up landing on grass without much damage, but also commented that it was &quot;the noisiest, coldest and most uncomfortable&quot; aircraft he had ever flown.

==Design==
===Airframe===
The Type 236 Supermarine Walrus is a single-engine amphibious biplane, principally designed to conduct maritime observation missions. The all-metal hull, an innovation for its day, was constructed from an anodised alloy, with stainless steel forgings for the catapult spools and mountings. Metal construction was used because experience had shown that wooden structures deteriorated rapidly under tropical conditions. 

Although the aircraft typically flew with one pilot, there were positions for two. The control column was not fixed, but could be inserted in either of two sockets in the floor, so that the column could be passed between the pilots. Behind the cockpit there is a small cabin with work stations for the navigator and radio operator.

===Wings===
The fabric-covered wings are of equal span, with a noticeable sweepback, and have stainless–steel spars and wooden ribs. The lower wings are set in the shoulder position with a stabilising float mounted under each one. The elevators are high on the tail-fin and braced by a pair of struts on either side . The wings can be folded, giving a stowage width a little greater than that of the tailplane.

The Seagull V was the first British military aircraft to be fitted with a retractable undercarriage. A senior technical assistant at Supermarine suggested the idea of completely retracting the wheels into the wings, so as to make the aircraft more streamlined.

===Powerplant===

The single Bristol Pegasus radial engine is mounted at the rear of a nacelle mounted on four struts above the lower wing and braced by four shorter struts to the centre-section of the upper wing. This drives a four-bladed wooden pusher propeller. The nacelle contains the oil tank, arranged around an air intake at the front to act as an oil cooler, as well as electrical equipment, and has a number of access panels for maintenance. A supplementary oil cooler is mounted on the starboard side. Fuel is carried in two tanks in the upper wings.

The Seagull&#x27;s pusher configuration has the advantages of keeping the engine and propeller out of the way of spray when operating on water and of reducing the noise level inside the aircraft; also the propeller was safely away from a crew member standing on the front deck when hooking on a hoisting cable. The engine is offset by three degrees to starboard to counter any tendency of the aircraft to yaw due to unequal forces on the rudder caused by the vortex from the propeller. A solid aluminium tailwheel is enclosed by a small water-rudder.

===Armament ===
The armament consisted of a pair of .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers K machine guns, one each in the open positions in the nose and rear fuselage. In addition, there were provisions for carrying either bombs or depth charges mounted beneath the lower wings.

===Operation from ships===
Prior to the 1930s, aircraft catapults had been installed in any naval ship capable of launching an aircraft; by 1934, 25% of the FAA&#x27;s aircraft were catapult-launched. 
When flying from a warship the Walrus would be recovered by touching-down alongside, then lifted from the sea by a ship&#x27;s crane. The Walrus lifting gear was kept in a compartment in the section of wing directly above the engine. A crew member would climb onto the top wing and attach this to the crane hook.

Landing and recovery was a straightforward procedure in calm waters, but could be difficult if the conditions were rough. The usual procedure was for the parent ship to turn through around 20° just before the aircraft touched down, creating a &#x27;slick&#x27; to the lee side of ship on which the Walrus could alight, this being followed by a fast taxi up to the ship before the &#x27;slick&#x27; dissipated.

Like other flying boats, the Walrus carried marine equipment for use on the water, including an anchor and a boat-hook.

==Production==

The RAAF ordered 24 Seagull Vs in 1933, to use as spotter-reconnaissance aircraft for the RAN. These were delivered during 1935 and 1936, with most of the aircraft being transported to Point Cook, Victoria, for use by the Seaplane Training Flight RAAF. 

The first order for 12 aircraft for the RAF was placed in May 1935; the first production aircraft, serial number &quot;K5772&quot;, flying on 16 March 1936. In RAF service the type was named Walrus and initial production aircraft were powered by the Pegasus II M2, while from 1937 the Pegasus VI was fitted. Production aircraft differed in minor details from the prototype; the transition between the upper decking and the aircraft sides was rounded off, the three struts bracing the tailplane were reduced to two, the trailing edges of the lower wing were hinged to fold 90° upwards rather than 180° downwards, and the external oil cooler was omitted.

A total of 740 Walruses were built in three major variants: the Seagull V, Walrus I and Walrus II. Of these, 462 aircraft were constructed by Saunders-Roe in Weybridge, Surrey, with fuselages built by Elliotts of Newbury. This variant had a wooden hull, which was heavier but economised on the use of light alloys. Saunders-Roe license-built 270 metal Mark Is and 191 wooden-hulled Mark IIs. The Walrus was called the &quot;Shagbat&quot;, the &quot;Steam Pigeon&quot;, and other names by its crews.

The successor to the Walrus was the Sea Otter, which was similar in design but more powerful. Sea Otters never completely replaced the Walrus, and both were used for air-sea rescue during the latter part of World War II. A post-war replacement for both aircraft, the Seagull, was cancelled in 1952, with only prototypes being constructed. By that time, air-sea rescue helicopters were taking over the role from small flying-boats.

== Operational history ==
=== Initial use ===
The first Seagull V, &quot;A2-1&quot;, was handed over to the Royal Australian Air Force in 1935, with the last being delivered in 1937. The type served aboard the County-class cruisers and , and the &quot;Leander&quot;-class cruisers , and .

Walrus deliveries to the RAF started in 1936 when the first example to be deployed was assigned to the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy, on —one of the &quot;Leander&quot;-class light cruisers that carried one Walrus each. The Royal Navy s carried two Walruses during the Second World War, and Walruses also equipped the and County-class heavy cruisers. Some battleships, such as the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class battleship and the Nelson-class battleship carried Walruses, as did the seaplane tender .

By the start of the war, the Walrus was already in widespread use. Although its principal intended use was gunnery spotting in naval actions, this only occurred twice: Walruses from the battlecruiser (the lead ship of her class) and the Town-class cruiser were launched in the Battle of Cape Spartivento, and a Walrus from the Town-class was used in the Battle of Cape Matapan. The main task of ship-based aircraft was patrolling for Axis submarines and surface-raiders. By March 1941, Walruses were being deployed with ASV radar systems to assist in this. During the Norwegian Campaign and the East African Campaign, Walruses saw limited use in bombing and strafing shore targets. In August 1940, a Walrus operating from HMAS &quot;Hobart&quot; bombed and machine-gunned the Italian headquarters at Zeila in British Somaliland. 

By 1943, catapult-launched aircraft on cruisers and battleships were being replaced by radar, which occupied far less space on a warship. Walruses continued to fly from Royal Navy carriers for air-sea rescue and general communications. The low landing speed of the Walrus meant they could make a carrier landing despite having no flaps or tailhook.

===Other military uses===

The Walrus was used by the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force for air-sea rescue missions. The specialist RAF Air Sea Rescue Service squadrons flew a variety of aircraft, using Spitfires and Boulton Paul Defiants to patrol for downed aircrew, Avro Ansons to drop supplies and dinghies and Walruses to pick up them up from the water. RAF air-sea rescue squadrons were deployed to cover the waters around the United Kingdom, the Mediterranean Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Over 1000 aircrew were picked up during these operations, with 277 Squadron responsible for 598 rescues.

In 1939, two Walruses were used at Lee-on-Solent for ASV trials, with the dipole antennae fixed on the aircraft&#x27;s interplane struts. In 1940, a Walrus was fitted with a forward-firing Oerlikon 20 mm cannon, intended as a counter-measure against German submarines. The gun was operated successfully, but the idea was abandoned when it was found that the flash blinded the pilot.

A Walrus was shipped to Arkhangelsk with other supplies brought on the British Convoy PQ 17. It was supplied to the 16th air transport detachment, and flew to the end of 1943. 

After the war, Walruses continued to see limited military use with the RAF and foreign navies. Eight aircraft were operated by Argentina, with two flying from the cruiser until 1958. Other aircraft were used for training by the French Navy&#x27;s .

===Post-war civilian use===
A Supermarine Walrus was used experimentally in the 1940s by a whaling company, United Whalers. Operating in the Antarctic Ocean, it was launched from the factory ship &quot;Balaena&quot;, which was equipped with a surplus naval catapult. The aircraft used were fitted with sockets to power the electrically-heated suits worn by the crew under their immersion suits. A cabin heater was fitted in the aircraft to help keep the crews warm during flights that could last over five hours. A Dutch whaling company embarked Walruses, but never flew them. 

Four Walruses were bought from the RAAF by Amphibious Airways of Rabaul. Licensed to carry up to ten passengers, they were used for charter and air ambulance work, remaining in service until 1954. During the first part of the 1960s, the remaining Walrus &quot;A2-4&quot;, registered for both private use and charter work, was provided with improved radio equipment and additional passengers seating. It was used to transport tourists and cargo out to the Great Barrier Reef and along the eastern coast of Australia.

==Surviving aircraft==
Three examples of the Walrus survive in museums, in addition to a single privately-owned aircraft. Wreckage that is thought to be that of the Walrus assigned to the cruiser HMAS &quot;Sydney&quot; was photographed when the wreck of the vessel was rediscovered in 2008.

===Seagull V &quot;A2-4&quot;===

One of the original Australian Seagull Vs, &quot;A2-4&quot; is on permanent display at the Royal Air Force Museum London. Built at Woolston in 1934, it arrived in Australia in early 1936, where it was initially allocated to No. 101 Flight RAAF (shortly afterwards becoming No. 5 Squadron RAAF). The aircraft had various pre-war duties, including survey work and flying from HMAS &quot;Sydney&quot;. It served for most of the war with No. 9 Squadron RAAF in Australia.

In 1946, &quot;A2-4&quot; was sold to civilian owners, and five years later was allocated the civil registration &quot;VH–ALB&quot;. During the 1950s and 1960s, it was flown by various Australian private owners before being badly damaged in a take-off accident at Taree, New South Wales in 1970. The wrecked aeroplane was acquired by the RAF Museum in exchange for a Supermarine Spitfire and a cash payment of Australian $5,000. In 1973, en route the United Kingdom, it had to be fumigated in Hawaii, due to the discovery of Black widow spiders. The restoration of &quot;A2-4&quot; began after its arrival at RAF Henlow; it has been on display at Royal Air Force Museum London since 1979.

===Walrus &quot;HD874&quot;===

&quot;HD874&quot; is kept at the Royal Australian Air Force Museum at RAAF Williams Point Cook, Victoria. It was originally flown by the Fleet Air Arm, before being transferred to the Royal Australian Air Force in 1943. During the war, &quot;HD874&quot; was flown by the RAAF&#x27;s No. 9 Squadron and No. 8 Communication Unit. 

Post-war, it was placed in storage until 1947, when it was issued to the RAAF&#x27;s Antarctic flight, for use on Heard Island during the first Australian expedition to Antarctica since World War II. It was painted bright yellow. The Antarctic Flight only flew it once before it was badly damaged by a storm. It was recovered in 1980, and restored between 1993 and 2002.

===Walrus &quot;L2301&quot;===

The Walrus displayed at the Fleet Air Arm Museum at RNAS Yeovilton is a composite aircraft, constructed using the fuselage and engine of Walrus &quot;L2301&quot;. Built in 1939, &quot;L2301&quot; was delivered to the Irish Air Corps, where it carried the Irish designation &quot;N.18&quot;. During its delivery flight on 3 March 1939, it suffered engine failure and later hull damage from ditching into the sea. It was towed to the old launch strip for the Curtiss H-16s at the former U.S. Naval Air Station Wexford Ireland. &quot;L2301&quot; was one of three Walruses (the other two being &quot;N.19&quot; (&quot;L2302&quot;) and &quot;N.20&quot; (&quot;L2303&quot;)) that were sent in March 1939 to the Irish Air Corps as maritime patrol aircraft during the Irish Emergency. 

On 9 January 1942 &quot;N.18&quot; was stolen by four Irish nationals who intended to fly to France to join the Luftwaffe. However, they were intercepted by RAF Spitfires and escorted to RAF St Eval; the aircraft and its occupants were returned to Ireland.

After the war, &quot;N.18&quot; was transferred to Aer Lingus and given the Irish civil registration &quot;EI-ACC&quot;. However, the Irish airline never flew it and instead sold it to Wing Commander Ronald Gustave Kellett in 1946 for £150. It was given the British civilian registration &quot;G-AIZG&quot; and flown until 1949 by members of No. 615 Squadron RAF for recreation. In 1963 it was recovered from a dump at Haddenham airfield, where RAF Thame had been based, by FAA crew from HMS &quot;Heron&quot;. They presented it to the Fleet Air Arm Museum, who restored it between 1964 and 1966.

===Walrus &quot;W2718&quot;===

After wartime RAF service, Walrus &quot;W2718&quot; was operated by Somerton Airways on the Isle of Wight, until it was decommissioned in 1947. It was subsequently used as a caravan. It became part of the collection of Solent Sky, an aviation museum in Southampton, UK, where work was begun on restoring the aircraft to flying condition. 

After being resold, restoration work was restarted in 2011 at Vintage Fabrics, Audley End, Essex. In 2018, after the aircraft was sold again to a private owner, it was moved to the Aircraft Restoration Company at Duxford Aerodrome.

<text>Brinley Howard Davies, Baron Davies of Brixton (born 17 May 1944), known as Bryn Davies, is a British trade unionist, actuary and politician who was Leader of the Inner London Education Authority in the early 1980s.

Davies graduated from the University of Hull and qualified as an actuary. He worked in the pensions industry, becoming a Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries in 1974. He worked for the Trade Union Congress as Pensions Officer from that year, advising member unions on occupational and state pensions. With this came membership of the Occupation Pensions Board.

During this time, he also began a career in local government. In 1971, he was elected as a Labour councillor in Waddon in the London Borough of Croydon, but lost his seat to the Conservative candidate in the 1974 elections. He was then elected to Lambeth London Borough Council in the 1978 election, where he became Deputy Leader.

At the beginning of 1980, the opportunity arose for him to go into London-wide politics in a by-election for the Greater London Council at Vauxhall, which he won easily as a Labour candidate. With membership of the GLC came &quot;ex officio&quot; membership of the Inner London Education Authority. Davies aligned himself with the left under Ken Livingstone.

The 1981 elections brought a new left majority to London. On 9 May 1981 Davies was chosen to be the new Leader of ILEA at the Annual General Meeting of the ILEA Labour Group, ousting Sir Ashley Bramall by 21 votes to 15. Bramall, who had been Leader for the previous eleven years, would have preferred to stay. Frances Morrell became Deputy Leader, replacing Mair Garside. The Labour right thought this takeover had been brutal and several of them decided to make life difficult for the new administration.

Among the first decisions taken under Davies&#x27; control was to allow GLC teachers paid leave to attend the People&#x27;s March for Jobs, a protest against unemployment, but a rebellion by more moderate Labour councillors defeated the plan. ILEA continued the comprehensivisation policy and intensified it by ending &#x27;streaming&#x27; within schools and insisting that Church schools end all selection as well. Davies&#x27; early priorities included a reduction in the price of school meals, which he eventually pressed through in spite of defeats caused by Labour rebellions and efforts to have it declared illegal.

ILEA&#x27;s budget increased by 14% in the first year (and its precept by 46%) while the Conservatives nationally criticised the cost of schooling under ILEA which was the highest in the country. Margaret Thatcher had taken against ILEA when Education Secretary in the Heath government. However Davies never had to deal with the abolition of ILEA, as his deputy Frances Morrell used her connections within the GLC Women&#x27;s Group to depose him in April 1983. He remained as a backbencher long enough to prove his left-wing credentials by supporting the strategy, subsequently held to be illegal, of refusing to set a GLC rate as a protest at ratecapping.

Davies went back into pensions in 1985 as a Director of Pensions and Investment Research Consultants. Later that year he was appointed as a Research Actuary at Bacon and Woodrow, and resigned from the GLC and ILEA. In 1989 he set up Union Pension Services Ltd., a consultancy on occupation pensions specialising in those for trade unions. He continues to work in and write about pensions.

Davies was made a Baron in the Dissolution Peerages 2019 by the Leader of the Labour Party at the time, Jeremy Corbyn. He made his maiden speech on 25 November 2020.

<doc id="583672" wikidata="Q2758596" url="?curid=583672" title="Jaimini">
<text>Jaimini was an ancient Indian scholar who founded the Mīmāṃsā school of Hindu philosophy. He is the son of Parāśara and is considered to be a disciple of sage Vyasa. Traditionally attributed to be the author of the &quot;Mimamsa Sutras&quot; and the &quot;Jaimini Sutras&quot;, he is estimated to have lived around 4th to 2nd century BCE. Some scholars place him between 250 BCE and 50 CE. His school is considered non-theistic, but emphasizes ritual parts of the &quot;Vedas&quot; as essential to &quot;dharma&quot;. Jaimini is known for his studies of the older Vedic rituals.

Jaimini&#x27;s &quot;guru&quot; was Badarayana, who founded the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy. He is also credited with authoring the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot;. Both Badarayana and Jaimini quoted each other as they analyzed each other&#x27;s theories. Badarayana emphasises knowledge, while Jaimini emphasises rituals. They sometimes agree with each other, sometimes disagree, and often present antithesis to each other.

Jaimini&#x27;s contributions to textual analysis and exegesis influenced other schools of Indian philosophies. The most studied &quot;bhashya&quot; (reviews and commentaries) on Jaimini&#x27;s texts were written by scholars named Shabara, Kumarila, and Prabhakara.

==Works==
Jaimini&#x27;s Mimamsa emerged in a time when traditional Vedic beliefs were losing their persuasive power. It was no longer taken for granted that sacrifices pleased deities, maintained the universe, or that the Vedas were infallible. Buddhist, Jain, and skeptical perspectives questioned the significance of sacrifices, while some adherents continued their practice despite doubts. This challenged the notion of a comprehensive understanding of rituals. In his works, Jaimini sought to address these criticisms.

=== Purva Mimamsa Sutras ===
Jaimini is most known for his great treatise Purva Mimamsa Sutras, also called Karma-mimamsa (“Study of Ritual Action”), a system that investigates the rituals in the Vedic texts. The text founded the Purva-Mimamsa (Mimamsa) school of Indian philosophy, one of the six Darsanas or schools of Indian philosophy.

Dated to around the 4th century BCE, the text contains about 3,000 sutras and is the foundational text of the Mimamsa school. The text aims at an exegesis of the Vedas with regard to ritual practice (karma) and religious duty (dharma), commenting on the early Upanishads. Jaimini&#x27;s Mimamsa is eminently ritualist (&quot;karma-kanda&quot;) in comparison to the metaphysical focus on knowledge of the Self (Atman) and Brahman of the Vedanta philosophy. His Mimamsa Sutra was commented upon by many, of which Śābara was among the earliest.

=== Jaimini Bharata ===
Jaimini also wrote a version of the Mahabharata narrated to him by his preceptor Vyasa, but today, only the Ashvamedhika Parva and the Shasramukhacaritam of his work are available. His version of the Mahabharata is titled Jaimini Bharata. It was translated into English in 2 volumes along with the Mairavanacaritam by the retired Brigadier General Shekhar Kumar Sen and Dr. Pradeep Bhattachaarya who is also the editor of the translation.

Jaimini&#x27;s Mahabharata is different from Vyasa&#x27;s because it is more focused on Yuddhishthira&#x27;s Ashwamedha and the reconstruction of peace between the children of enemies such as Karna, Jayadratha, and Shakuni. It also emphasizes the value of worshipping Krishna as an avatar of Vishnu. Jaimini Bharata is also known as Jaimini-ashwamedha.

==Other mentions==
===Samaveda===
When sage Veda Vyasa classified ancient Vedic hymns into four parts based on their use in sacrificial rites and taught them to his four chief disciples – Paila, Vaisampayana, Jaimini, and Sumantu, the Samaveda was transmitted to sage Jaimini.

===Markandeya Purana===
One of the major Puranas, the Markandeya Purana, opens with a dialogue between sage Jaimini and Markandeya and discusses philosophy, theology, cosmology, cosmogony, dharma, and karma.

=== Brahmanda Purana ===
It is mentioned in the first chapter of the Brahmanda Purana that the Brahmanda Purana is a story that Jaimini is telling King Hiranyanabha at Naimisharanya.

=== Mahabharata ===
Jaimini has also appears in many parts of the Mahabharata. For instance, in Adi Parva, chapter 53, stanza 6, Jaimini is said to be present during Janamejaya&#x27;s sarpasatra, the yagna (sacrificial ritual) he performed to kill all serpents out of vengeance for his father Parikshit&#x27;s death. Furthermore, stanza 11 in chapter 4 of the Sabha Parva says that Jaimini was a part of Yudhishthira&#x27;s council. He even visited Bhishma as he lay on the bed of arrows during the war, according to Shanti Parva, chapter 46, stanza 7.

One story connecting Jaimini with the Mahabharata is that after hearing the narration of the Mahabharata from his teacher Vyasa, the author of the Mahabharata, Jaimini was confused. Since Vyasa was not around to clear his confusions, he went to Markandeya. However, by the time he went to him, Markandeya had abandoned speech. The disciples of Markandeya directed Jaimini to four birds who had witnessed the great eighteen-day Mahabharata war. The mother of those four birds was flying above the battlefield of the great war when she was pierced by an arrow which ripped open her womb. Four eggs fell out and safely landed onto the Kurukshetra ground, which had been softened as it was blood-soaked. An elephant&#x27;s bell fell on the four birds and covered them protectively, keeping the eggs safe throughout the remainder of the war. After the war, they were discovered by rishis who realized that the four birds had heard much during the war and had knowledge that no other human had so blessed them with human speech. Jaimini went to those four birds and was able to clear is doubts and confusions.

<doc id="583678" wikidata="Q58397" url="?curid=583678" title="Amitriptyline">
<text>Amitriptyline, sold under the brand name Elavil among others, is a tricyclic antidepressant primarily used to treat major depressive disorder, and a variety of pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, migraine and tension headaches. Due to the frequency and prominence of side effects, amitriptyline is generally considered a second-line therapy for these indications.

The most common side effects are dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, and weight gain. Glaucoma, liver toxicity and abnormal heart rhythms are rare but serious side effects. Blood levels of amitriptyline vary significantly from one person to another, and amitriptyline interacts with many other medications potentially aggravating its side effects.

Amitriptyline was discovered in the late 1950s by scientists at Merck and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1961. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 87th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7million prescriptions.
==Medical uses==
Amitriptyline is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder, neuropathic pain, and for the prevention of migraine and chronic tension headache. It can be used for the treatment of nocturnal enuresis in children older than 6 after other treatments have failed.

===Depression===
Amitriptyline is effective for depression, but it is rarely used as a first-line antidepressant due to its higher toxicity in overdose and generally poorer tolerability. It can be tried for depression as a second-line therapy, after the failure of other treatments. For treatment-resistant adolescent depression or for cancer-related depression amitriptyline is no better than placebo; however, the number of treated patients in both studies was small. It is sometimes used for the treatment of depression in Parkinson&#x27;s disease, but supporting evidence for that is lacking.

===Pain===
Amitriptyline alleviates painful diabetic neuropathy. It is recommended by a variety of guidelines as a first or second-line treatment. It is as effective for this indication as gabapentin or pregabalin but less well tolerated. Amitriptyline is as effective at relieving pain as duloxetine. Combination treatment of amitriptyline and pregabalin offers additional pain relief for people whose pain is not adequately controlled with one medication and is usually safe. Amitriptyline in certain formulations may also induce the level of sciatic-nerve blockade needed for local anesthesia therein. Here, it has been demonstrated to be of superior potency to bupivacaine, a customary long-acting local anesthetic.

Low doses of amitriptyline moderately improve sleep disturbances and reduce pain and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. It is recommended for fibromyalgia accompanied by depression by Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany and as a second-line option for fibromyalgia, with exercise being the first line option, by European League Against Rheumatism. Combinations of amitriptyline and fluoxetine or melatonin may reduce fibromyalgia pain better than either medication alone.

There is some (low-quality) evidence that amitriptyline may reduce pain in cancer patients. It is recommended only as a second-line therapy for non-chemotherapy-induced neuropathic or mixed neuropathic pain if opioids did not provide the desired effect.

Moderate evidence exists in favor of amitriptyline use for atypical facial pain. Amitriptyline is ineffective for HIV-associated neuropathy.

In multiple sclerosis, it is frequently used to treat painful paresthesias in the arms and legs (e.g., burning sensations, pins and needles, stabbing pains) caused by damage to the pain-regulating pathways of the brain and spinal cord.

===Headache===
Amitriptyline is probably effective for the prevention of periodic migraine in adults. Amitriptyline is similar in efficacy to venlafaxine and topiramate but carries a higher burden of adverse effects than topiramate. For many patients, even very small doses of amitriptyline are helpful, which may allow for minimization of side effects. Amitriptyline is not significantly different from placebo when used for the prevention of migraine in children.

Amitriptyline may reduce the frequency and duration of chronic tension headache, but it is associated with worse adverse effects than mirtazapine. Overall, amitriptyline is recommended for tension headache prophylaxis, along with lifestyle advice, which should include avoidance of analgesia and caffeine.

===Other indications===
Amitriptyline is effective for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome; however, because of its side effects, it should be reserved for select patients for whom other agents do not work. There is insufficient evidence to support its use for abdominal pain in children with functional gastrointestinal disorders.

Tricyclic antidepressants decrease the frequency, severity, and duration of cyclic vomiting syndrome episodes. Amitriptyline, as the most commonly used of them, is recommended as a first-line agent for its therapy.

Amitriptyline may improve pain and urgency intensity associated with bladder pain syndrome and can be used in the management of this syndrome. Amitriptyline can be used in the treatment of nocturnal enuresis in children. However, its effect is not sustained after the treatment ends. Alarm therapy gives better short- and long-term results.

In the US, amitriptyline is commonly used in children with ADHD as an adjunct to stimulant medications without any evidence or guideline supporting this practice. Many physicians in the UK (and the US also) commonly prescribe amitriptyline for insomnia; however, Cochrane reviewers were not able to find any randomized controlled studies that would support or refute this practice. Similarly, a major systematic review and network meta-analysis of medications for the treatment of insomnia published in 2022 found little evidence to inform the use of amitriptyline for insomnia. The well-known sedating effects of amitriptyline, however, bear understanding on and arguable justification for this practice. It may function similarly to doxepin in this regard, although the evidence for doxepin is more robust. Trimipramine may be a more novel alternative given its tendency to not suppress but brighten R.E.M. sleep.

==Contraindications and precautions==
The known contraindications of amitriptyline are:

* History of myocardial infarction
* History of arrhythmias, particularly any degree of heart block
* Coronary artery disease
* Porphyria
* Severe liver disease (such as cirrhosis)
* Being under six years of age
* Patients who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or have taken them within the last 14 days

Amitriptyline should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy, impaired liver function, pheochromocytoma, urinary retention, prostate enlargement, hyperthyroidism, and pyloric stenosis.

In patients with the rare condition of shallow anterior chamber of eyeball and narrow anterior chamber angle, amitriptyline may provoke attacks of acute glaucoma due to dilation of the pupil. It may aggravate psychosis, if used for depression with schizophrenia. It may precipitate the switch to mania in those with bipolar disorder.

CYP2D6 poor metabolizers should avoid amitriptyline due to increased side effects. If it is necessary to use it, half dose is recommended. Amitriptyline can be used during pregnancy and lactation when SSRIs have been shown not to work.

==Side effects==
The most frequent side effects, occurring in 20% or more of users, are dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, and weight gain (on average 1.8 kg). Other common side effects are headache problems (amblyopia, blurred vision), tachycardia, increased appetite, tremor, fatigue/asthenia/feeling slowed down, and dyspepsia.

A less common side effect of amitriptyline is urination problems (8.7%).

Amitriptyline can increase suicidal thoughts and behavior in people under the age of 24 and the US FDA required a boxed warning to be added to the prescription label. Amitriptyline-associated sexual dysfunction (occurring at a frequency of 6.9%) seems to be mostly confined to males with depression and is expressed predominantly as erectile dysfunction and low libido disorder, with lesser frequency of ejaculatory and orgasmic problems. The rate of sexual dysfunction in males treated for indications other than depression and in females is not significantly different from placebo.

Liver test abnormalities occur in 10–12% of patients on amitriptyline, but are usually mild, asymptomatic, and transient, with consistently elevated alanine transaminase in 3% of all patients. The increases of the enzymes above the 3-fold threshold of liver toxicity are uncommon, and cases of clinically apparent liver toxicity are rare; nevertheless, amitriptyline is placed in the group of antidepressants with greater risks of hepatic toxicity.

Amitriptyline prolongs the QT interval. This prolongation is relatively small at therapeutic doses but becomes severe in overdose.

==Overdose==

The symptoms and the treatment of an overdose are largely the same as for the other TCAs, including the presentation of serotonin syndrome and adverse cardiac effects. The British National Formulary notes that amitriptyline can be particularly dangerous in overdose, thus it and other TCAs are no longer recommended as first-line therapy for depression. The treatment of overdose is mostly supportive as no specific antidote for amitriptyline overdose is available. Activated charcoal may reduce absorption if given within 1–2 hours of ingestion. If the affected person is unconscious or has an impaired gag reflex, a nasogastric tube may be used to deliver the activated charcoal into the stomach. ECG monitoring for cardiac conduction abnormalities is essential and if one is found close monitoring of cardiac function is advised. Body temperature should be regulated with measures such as heating blankets if necessary. Cardiac monitoring is advised for at least five days after the overdose. Benzodiazepines are recommended to control seizures. Dialysis is of no use due to the high degree of protein binding with amitriptyline.

== Interactions ==

Since amitriptyline and its active metabolite nortriptyline are primarily metabolized by cytochromes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 (see its pharmacology), the inhibitors of these enzymes are expected to exhibit pharmacokinetic interactions with amitriptyline. According to the prescribing information, the interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors may increase the plasma level of amitriptyline. However, the results in the other literature are inconsistent: the co-administration of amitriptyline with a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine does increase the plasma levels of amitriptyline two-fold and of the main active metabolite nortriptyline 1.5-fold, but combination with less potent CYP2D6 inhibitors thioridazine or levomepromazine does not affect the levels of amitriptyline and increases nortriptyline by about 1.5-fold; A case of clinically significant interaction with potent CYP2D6 inhibitor terbinafine has been reported.

A potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 and other cytochromes fluvoxamine increases the level of amitriptyline two-fold while slightly decreasing the level of nortriptyline. Similar changes occur with a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C19 and other cytochromes cimetidine: amitriptyline level increases by about 70%, while nortriptyline decreases by 50%. CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole elevates amitriptyline level by about a quarter. On the other hand, cytochrome P450 inducers such as carbamazepine and St. John&#x27;s Wort decrease the levels of both amitriptyline and nortriptyline

Oral contraceptives may increase the blood level of amitriptyline by as high as 90%. Valproate moderately increases the levels of amitriptyline and nortriptyline through an unclear mechanism.

The prescribing information warns that the combination of amitriptyline with monoamine oxidase inhibitors may cause potentially lethal serotonin syndrome; however, this has been disputed. The prescribing information cautions that some patients may experience a large increase in amitriptyline concentration in the presence of topiramate. However, other literature states that there is little or no interaction: in a pharmacokinetic study topiramate only increased the level of amitriptyline by 20% and nortriptyline by 33%.

Amitriptyline counteracts the antihypertensive action of guanethidine. When given with amitriptyline, other anticholinergic agents may result in hyperpyrexia or paralytic ileus. Co-administration of amitriptyline and disulfiram is not recommended due to the potential for the development of toxic delirium. Amitriptyline causes an unusual type of interaction with the anticoagulant phenprocoumon during which great fluctuations of the prothrombin time have been observed.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===

Amitriptyline inhibits serotonin transporter (SERT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET). It is metabolized to nortriptyline, a stronger norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, further augmenting amitriptyline&#x27;s effects on norepinephrine reuptake (see table in this section).

Amitriptyline additionally acts as a potent inhibitor of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, the α1A-adrenergic, the histamine H1 and the M1-M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (see table in this section).

Amitriptyline is a non-selective blocker of multiple ion channels, in particular, voltage-gated sodium channels Nav1.3, Nav1.5, Nav1.6, Nav1.7, and Nav1.8, voltage-gated potassium channels Kv7.2/ Kv7.3, Kv7.1, Kv7.1/KCNE1, and hERG.

===Mechanism of action===
Inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine transporters by amitriptyline results in interference with neuronal reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. Since the reuptake process is important physiologically in terminating transmitting activity, this action may potentiate or prolong the activity of serotonergic and adrenergic neurons and is believed to underlie the antidepressant activity of amitriptyline.

Inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake leads to an increased concentration of norepinephrine in the posterior gray column of the spinal cord appears to be mostly responsible for the analgesic action of amitriptyline. Increased level of norepinephrine increases the basal activity of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, which mediate an analgesic effect by increasing gamma-aminobutyric acid transmission among spinal interneurons. The blocking effect of amitriptyline on sodium channels may also contribute to its efficacy in pain conditions.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Amitriptyline is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (90–95%). Absorption is gradual with the peak concentration in blood plasma reached after about 4 hours. Extensive metabolism on the first pass through the liver leads to average bioavailability of about 50% (45%-53%). Amitriptyline is metabolized mostly by CYP2C19 into nortriptyline and by CYP2D6 leading to a variety of hydroxylated metabolites, with the principal one among them being (&quot;E&quot;)-10-hydroxynortriptyline (see metabolism scheme), and to a lesser degree, by CYP3A4. 

Nortriptyline, the main active metabolite of amitriptyline, is an antidepressant on its own right. Nortriptyline reaches 10% higher level in the blood plasma than the parent drug amitriptyline and 40% greater area under the curve, and its action is an important part of the overall action of amitriptyline.

Another active metabolite is (&quot;E&quot;)-10-hydroxynortriptyline, which is a norepinephrine uptake inhibitor four times weaker than nortriptyline. (&quot;E&quot;)-10-hydroxynortiptyline blood level is comparable to that of nortriptyline, but its cerebrospinal fluid level, which is a close proxy of the brain concentration of a drug, is twice higher than nortriptyline&#x27;s. Based on this, (&quot;E&quot;)-10-hydroxynortriptyline was suggested to significantly contribute to the antidepressant effects of amitriptyline.

Blood levels of amitriptyline and nortriptyline and pharmacokinetics of amitriptyline in general, with clearance difference of up to 10-fold, vary widely between individuals. Variability of the area under the curve in steady state is also high, which makes a slow upward titration of the dose necessary.

In the blood, amitriptyline is 96% bound to plasma proteins; nortriptyline is 93–95% bound, and (&quot;E&quot;)-10-hydroxynortiptyline is about 60% bound. Amitriptyline has an elimination half life of 21 hours, nortriptyline – 23–31 hours, and (&quot;E&quot;)-10-hydroxynortiptyline − 8–10 hours. Within 48 hours, 12−80% of amitriptyline is eliminated in the urine, mostly as metabolites. 2% of the unchanged drug is excreted in the urine. Elimination in the feces, apparently, have not been studied.

Therapeutic levels of amitriptyline range from 75 to 175 ng/mL (270–631 nM), or 80–250 ng/mL of both amitriptyline and its metabolite nortriptyline.

===Pharmacogenetics===
Since amitriptyline is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, genetic variations within the genes coding for these enzymes can affect its metabolism, leading to changes in the concentrations of the drug in the body. Increased concentrations of amitriptyline may increase the risk for side effects, including anticholinergic and nervous system adverse effects, while decreased concentrations may reduce the drug&#x27;s efficacy.

Individuals can be categorized into different types of CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 metabolizers depending on which genetic variations they carry. These metabolizer types include poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultrarapid metabolizers. Most individuals (about 77–92%) are extensive metabolizers, and have &quot;normal&quot; metabolism of amitriptyline. Poor and intermediate metabolizers have reduced metabolism of the drug as compared to extensive metabolizers; patients with these metabolizer types may have an increased probability of experiencing side effects. Ultrarapid metabolizers use amitriptyline much faster than extensive metabolizers; patients with this metabolizer type may have a greater chance of experiencing pharmacological failure.

The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium recommends avoiding amitriptyline in patients who are CYP2D6 ultrarapid or poor metabolizers, due to the risk of a lack of efficacy and side effects, respectively. The consortium also recommends considering an alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2C19 in patients who are CYP2C19 ultrarapid metabolizers. A reduction in the starting dose is recommended for patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. If the use of amitriptyline is warranted, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to guide dose adjustments. The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group also recommends selecting an alternative drug or monitoring plasma concentrations of amitriptyline in patients who are CYP2D6 poor or ultrarapid metabolizers, and selecting an alternative drug or reducing initial dose in patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers.
==Chemistry==
Amitriptyline is a highly lipophilic molecule having an octanol-water partition coefficient (pH 7.4) of 3.0, while the log P of the free base was reported as 4.92. Solubility of the free base amitriptyline in water is 14 mg/L. Amitriptyline is prepared by reacting dibenzosuberane with 3-(dimethylamino)propylmagnesium chloride and then heating the resulting intermediate product with hydrochloric acid to eliminate water.

==History==
Amitriptyline was first developed by the American pharmaceutical company Merck in the late 1950s. In 1958, Merck approached several clinical investigators proposing to conduct clinical trials of amitriptyline for schizophrenia. One of these researchers, Frank Ayd, instead, suggested using amitriptyline for depression. Ayd treated 130 patients and, in 1960, reported that amitriptyline had antidepressant properties similar to another, and the only known at the time, tricyclic antidepressant imipramine. Following this, the US Food and Drug Administration approved amitriptyline for depression in 1961.

In Europe, due to a quirk of the patent law at the time allowing patents only on the chemical synthesis but not on the drug itself, Roche and Lundbeck were able to independently develop and market amitriptyline in the early 1960s.

According to research by a historian of psychopharmacology David Healy, amitriptyline became a much bigger selling drug than its precursor imipramine because of two factors. First, amitriptyline has a much stronger anxiolytic effect. Second, Merck conducted a marketing campaign raising clinicians&#x27; awareness of depression as a clinical entity.

==Society and culture==
In the 2021 film &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot;, amitriptyline (referred to by the brand name Elavil) is part of the plot line of the movie.

===Names===
Amitriptyline is the English and French generic name of the drug and its , , and , while amitriptyline hydrochloride is its , , , and . Its generic name in Spanish and Italian and its are , in German is , and in Latin is . The embonate salt is known as amitriptyline embonate, which is its BANM, or as amitriptyline pamoate unofficially.

=== Prescription trends ===
Between 1998 and 2017, along with imipramine, amitriptyline was the most commonly prescribed first antidepressant for children aged 5–11 years in England. It was also the most prescribed antidepressant (along with fluoxetine) for 12- to 17-year-olds.

==Research==
The few randomized controlled trials investigating amitriptyline efficacy in eating disorder have been discouraging.

<doc id="583681" wikidata="Q5616457" url="?curid=583681" title="2004 Guinea-Bissau parliamentary election">
<text>Parliamentary elections were held in Guinea-Bissau on 28 March 2004 after repeated postponements caused by political and financial chaos in the country, including a coup d&#x27;état that overthrew President Kumba Ialá in September 2003. The former ruling party, the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC), won the largest number of seats, but did not obtain a majority. Former President Yala&#x27;s party, the Party for Social Renewal (PRS), came second with 35 seats. 

The PAIGC reached an agreement with the PRS for its parliamentary support (a previous attempt at reaching a deal with the United Social Democratic Party, which won 17 seats, failed), and in May 2004 the new parliament was sworn in, with PAIGC leader Carlos Gomes Júnior becoming prime minister.

==Conduct==
Although voting reportedly took place on time in the interior of Guinea-Bissau, it was delayed in much of the capital Bissau, as electoral materials were delivered late to many polling stations. The National Electoral Commission ordered the polling stations that opened late to remain open past the scheduled end of voting to ensure that everyone would have a chance to vote. About a third of polling stations in Bissau reportedly never opened on the day of the election, and these stations were ordered to open on the following day, March 29.

Over 100 international observers were present for the election. The United Nations, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, and La Francophonie sent observers, as did Portugal, Russia and the United States.

<text>Svilajnac (, ) is a town and municipality located in the Pomoravlje District of central Serbia. The population of the town is 8,593 inhabitants, while the municipality has 20,141 inhabitants (2022 census).

It is located south-east of Belgrade, on the banks of the river Resava, and bordering the river Morava. Its name stems from the word for silk in Serbian.

== History ==
Svilajnac was first mentioned in Ottoman records in 1467 as a village with a hundred households. The village, and later town, gained prominence through its silk production, from which it derives its name (&quot;svila&quot;, &quot;silk&quot;). Located in central Serbia, it flourished as a trading center, where silk, wool and livestock were traded.

The First Serbian Uprising revolutionary Stevan Sinđelić was born in the village of Grabovac near Svilajnac. His birth house serves as an exhibition space with a display depicting the period of the First Serbian Uprising, including original furniture from this region. A statue in his honor was raised in the central square of Svilajnac, in the pedestrian zone of &quot;Kriva čaršija&quot;. It was erected in 1991 after the design of sculptor Mihailo Paunović. The bronze monument marks the decisive moment in the Battle of Čegar, when Sinđelić, standing in the trench shot the powder keg.

In 1832 a hospital was established in Svilajnac, one of the first medical centers in this part of Serbia. Due to its architectural and historical importance, the building of the Old Hospital has been declared a cultural monument and placed under the state protection.

Modern town began to develop on the location of the medieval village in 1820. It was based on the urban regulatory plan which consisted of four main streets: &quot;Prava čaršija&quot; (today &quot;Saint Sava&quot; Street), &quot;Kriva čaršija&quot;, &quot;Gospodska&quot; (today &quot;Ustanička&quot; Street) and Resava Square (today Park of the European friendship). &quot;Kriva čaršija&quot; is one of the best preserved ambient units in the town. It was later called &quot;Kneza Mihailova&quot;, then &quot;Lenjinova&quot; after the World War II, then &quot;Stevana Sinđelića&quot; before its original name was returned. Today it is the central pedestrian zone in Svilajnac.

On 29 June 1866 Prince Mihailo Obrenović officially declared Svliajnac a &quot;varošica&quot; (&quot;small town&quot;). In 1868 a library was open. The building previously belonged to Dimitrije Mita Isaković, founder of the Resava Savings Bank, the first money institution in Svilajnac. The building was declared a cultural monument in 2001 and the library today holds 60,000 books and 9,000 non-book units. A gymnasium was open in 1877. The school building was also declared a cultural monument and was fully renovated in 2015.

In 1923 it was decided to erect the monument in honor of the soldiers from Svilajnac, killed in the Balkan Wars and World War I from 1912 to 1918. The foundation stone was laid in 1923 and the monument was dedicated on 27 October 1926. The monument was designed by Slovene sculptor Ivan Zajec and the model for the bronze sculpture was a local woman Zora Milosavljević Bidžić. There are several stories on her identity. A mythical ones, claim that Mara was a fighter in the Resava region against the Ottoman invasion in 14th century or a daughter of legendary Jug Bogdan who became a nun with her mother after the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. One of the plausible stories mentions Mara, a daughter of Kosovo migrant Joksa Resavac, from the period of the First Serbian Uprising, who fought the Turks with Sinđelić and the Resava knez Petar Jakovljević Erčić. Soon a cult of Mara Resavkinja developed and she was considered a symbol of maternity, freedom and life, with numerous songs being written about her. The monument shows Mara holding a torch in the right hand and laurel wreath in the left. Under her feet are the trumpet and a drum, symbols of monarchy. Because of this, a representative of the King Alexander on the monument&#x27;s dedication left the ceremony. Due to this symbolism, the monument was attacked and finally in 1934 it was decided to demolish it. Actually, mayor of Svilajnac Mihajlo R. Milenković officially pleaded for the figure to be replaced with some other, &quot;more appropriate&quot;, so the demolition was announced on 3 October 1934, but ban of the Morava Banovina nullified the decision of the town&#x27;s administration on 26 October. King Alexander was assassinated in the meantime (9 October), situation in the state became unstable, followed by the breakout of the World War II, so the monument survived. However, it was destroyed during the World War II. The local Četniks&#x27; unit knocked down the bronze figure and melted it into the hand grenades. After the war, citizens decided to rebuild the monument. Sculptor Lojze Dolinar used the surviving Zajec&#x27;s molds to cast the identical figure which was unveiled on 29 November 1951.

From 1929 to 1941, Svilajnac was part of the Morava Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During the Interbellum a building of the Sokol Hall &quot;Dušan Silni&quot; was constructed. It was reconstructed in 2012 and adapted into the cultural center.

One of the largest buildings in town is the Agricultural and veterinary school, with the campus &quot;Svilajnac&quot;, built in 1957. After the liberalisation of international travel in SFR Yugoslavia significant number of residents of the town moved to Paris as guest workers. 

On 3 September 2007 there was a Democratic Party initiative to depose the president of the municipality Dobrivoje Budimirovic &quot;Bidža&quot; (Serbian Radical Party). It failed, partially due to the opposition of the Democratic Party of Serbia.

The town was damaged during the 2014 Southeast Europe floods.

In 2015 a Natural History Center of Serbia, , was open in Svilajnac. It became a major tourist attraction in the entire region, mostly due to its exhibition of dinosaur remains in the Dino Park. The center is located close to the downtown and the &quot;Kriva čaršija&quot;. Out of 20 dinosaur replicas, the largest is Diplodocus, tall and long.

==Demographics==
== Economy ==
Apart from commercial services, Svilajnac&#x27;s economy is largely dependent on agricultural activities. Svilajnac has developed two fully equipped industrial zones. One of the facilities is of Panasonic since 2011.

During the existence of SFR Yugoslavia, the state-owned companies contributed substantially to the local economy, until the 1990s, when international sanctions imposed on FR Yugoslavia lead to the massive closure of the companies.

As of September 2017, Svilajnac has one of 14 free economic zones established in Serbia.

== Infrastructure ==

One of only several bridges across the Morava is located in Svilajnac, giving it a unique strategic value. During the Second World War, the original bridge was destroyed by the retreating Royal Yugoslav Army. After the war, the bridge was rebuilt with German war reparations.

Svilajnac is also the location of a coal power plant. Built in 1969, only several hundred meters upriver from the bridge, it has an energy output of 125 MW. The town is also the location to now decommissioned military barracks which could house up to 5,000 soldiers at any one time.

<text>Durashift is the brand name of a range of Ford automatic and recently manual transmissions.

==Durashift EST==
Durashift EST &quot;(Electronic Shift Transmission)&quot; features electronic control with manual selection of gears. It is an automated manual transmission with a shift and clutches electric actuator.

The 2000-2006 Ford Transit featured a 5-speed &quot;Durashift-EST&quot; automatic transmission. It had different modes, such as Economy, Winter, and Tow-Haul mode. This is known as the ASM (auto-shifting manual) system in the Australian market.

Both Fusion and Ford Fiesta MK6 models feature a 5-speed &quot;Durashift-EST&quot; in a 1.4L Otto (&quot;petrol fuel engine&quot;) and 1.4 TDCi (&quot;diesel fuel engine&quot;), automatic powertrain.

==Durashift CVT==
There was a CVT version for smaller cars like some rare versions of Ford Focus.

==Durashift Manual==
The Durashift name has been applied to the current Ford Transit manual only lineup, suggesting that the brand name has a broader meaning.

==Failure==
When a Durashift transmission fails, the transmission often will not go back in neutral and the car will not start, causing extra problems for car owners and mechanics. Repairs of Durashift transmissions tend to cost lots of time and therefore money. It takes specialized knowledge of both computer and mechanical parts to repair a Durashift transmission, which is why repair is often perceived as complicated.

<text>Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission (RKM) is a spiritual and philanthropic organisation headquartered in Belur Math, West Bengal. The mission is named after the Indian Hindu spiritual guru and mystic Ramakrishna. The mission was founded by Ramakrishna&#x27;s chief disciple Swami Vivekananda on 1 May 1897. The organisation mainly propagates the Hindu philosophy of Vedanta–Advaita Vedanta and four yogic ideals – Jnana, Bhakti, Karma, and Raja yoga. The mission bases its work on the principles of Karma Yoga, the principle of selfless work done with a dedication to God.

== Overview ==

The Math and the Mission are the two key organizations that direct the work of the Ramakrishna movement. The Ramakrishna Math, alternatively referred to as the Ramakrishna Order, is a monastic institution associated with the religious movement established by Ramakrishna in 1886. The primary emphasis of the Math lies in the cultivation of spiritual development and the dissemination of the movement&#x27;s doctrines.

The Mission, founded by Vivekananda in 1897, is a humanitarian organisation that carries out medical, relief, and educational programs. Both organisations have headquarters at Belur Math.

The Mission acquired legal status when it was registered in 1909 under Act XXI of 1860. Its management is vested in a Governing Body. Though the Mission with its branches is a distinct legal entity, it is closely related to the Math.

The elected trustees of the Math also serve as the Mission&#x27;s Governing Body.

== History ==
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa (1836–1886), regarded as a 19th-century mystic, was the inspirer of the Ramakrishna Order of monks and is regarded as the spiritual founder of the Ramakrishna Movement. Ramakrishna was a priest at the Dakshineswar Kali Temple and attracted several monastic and household s.

In 1886, shortly before his death, Ramakrishna gave the ochre cloths of renunciation to his young disciples, who were planning to become renunciants. Ramakrishna entrusted the care of these young aspirants to Vivekananda. After his death, the young disciples of Ramakrishna gathered and practised spiritual disciplines. They took informal monastic vows on the night of 24 December 1886.

After the death of Ramakrishna in 1886, the monastic disciples formed the first &quot;Math&quot; (monastery) at Baranagore. Later, Vivekananda became a wandering monk, and in 1893, he was a delegate at the Parliament of the World&#x27;s Religions held in the year 1893. His speech there, beginning with &quot;Sisters and Brothers of America,&quot; became famous and brought him widespread recognition. Vivekananda went on lecture tours and held private discourses on Hinduism and spirituality. He also founded the first Vedanta Society in the United States, in New York. He returned to India in 1897 and founded the Ramakrishna Mission on 1 May 1897. Though Vivekananda was a Hindu sadhu and was hailed as the first Hindu missionary in modern times, he exhorted his followers to be true to their faith and respect all the religions of the world, as Ramakrishna, his guru, had taught that all religions are pathways to God. One such example is his exhortation that &quot;one can be born in a church, but he or she should not die in a church,&quot; meaning that one should realise the spiritual truths for themselves and not stop at blindly believing in doctrines taught to them. The same year, famine relief was started at Sargachi by Swami Akhandananda, a direct disciple of Ramakrishna. Swami Brahmananda, a direct disciple of Ramakrishna, was appointed as the first president of the Order. After the death of Vivekananda in 1902, Sarada Devi, the spiritual counterpart of Ramakrishna, played an important role as the advisory head of a nascent monastic organisation. Gayatri Spivak writes that Sarada Devi &quot;performed her role with tact and wisdom, always remaining in the background.&quot;

== Administration ==

The Board of Trustees holds all the authority inside the twin organisation, Ramakrishna Math and Mission. The governing body known as the Board of Trustees consists of several key positions, including an elected President, one or more vice presidents, a General Secretary, one or more Assistant General Secretaries, and a Treasurer.

The individual holding the position of President serves as the highest authority within both Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, overseeing all affiliated branch centres and the central headquarters located at Belur Math.

The composition of the Board of Trustees comprises elected members of the Ramakrishna Order who hold senior positions as monks. The appointment of a head is done by the Trustees, who designate the head of a branch centre of Ramakrishna Math.

The Ramakrishna Movement comprises four distinct streams. The inclusion of ordinary devotees assuming the role of monks within the Ramakrishna Math constitutes the initial manifestation of the movement. The second stream consists of lay devotees who choose not to renounce the world but instead engage in voluntary activities. The third stream is Sarada Math and the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The fourth branch is the &quot;Private Ashramas,&quot; which operate autonomously and are not administratively affiliated with the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission.

== Motto and principles ==
The aims and ideals of the Mission are purely spiritual and humanitarian, and they have no connection with politics. The mission strives to practice and preach these. The Principles of the Upanishads and Yoga in the Bhagavad Gita are reinterpreted in light of Ramakrishna&#x27;s life and teachings, and are the main source of inspiration for the Mission.

=== Motto ===
Manifestation of the Atman can be realized through any of the four yogas. The Ramakrishna Mission also believes in the harmony of all religions, i.e. that all religions lead to the same goal if followed properly.

== Monastic Order ==
After the death of Ramakrishna in 1886, his young disciples organised themselves into a new monastic order. The original monastery at Baranagar, known as Baranagar Math, was subsequently moved to the nearby Alambazar area in 1892, then to Nilambar Mukherjee&#x27;s Garden House, south of the present Belur Math in 1898 before finally being shifted in January 1899 to a newly acquired plot of land at Belur in Howrah district by Vivekananda.

== Attitude towards politics ==
Almost 95% of the monks possess voter ID cards for the sake of identification and particularly for traveling, as they are forced by governmental authorities to seek a voter ID card. But they generally use it only for identification purpose and not for voting though they are not forbidden to vote. As individuals, the monks may have political opinions, but these are not meant to be discussed in public.

The Mission, had, however, supported the movement of Indian independence, with a section of the monks keeping close apolitical relations with freedom fighters of various camps. A number of political revolutionaries later joined the Ramakrishna Order.

===Indira Gandhi&#x27;s association===
Former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and her mother went to the Belur Math headquarters of the Ramakrishna Mission where Swami Ranganathananda was her guardian.

===Narendra Modi&#x27;s association=== 
In interviews, current Prime Minister Narendra Modi has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near Kolkata, the Advaita Ashrama in Almora and the Ramakrishna Mission in Rajkot. His stay at each ashram was brief because he lacked the required college education. Vivekananda has had a large influence in Modi&#x27;s life.

== Emblem ==
Designed and explained by Swami Vivekananda in his own words:
:&quot;The wavy waters in the picture are symbolic of Karma; the lotus, of Bhakti; and the rising-sun, of Jnana. The encircling serpent is indicative of [Raja] Yoga and the awakened Kundalini Shakti, while the swan in the picture stands for Paramatman (Supreme Self). Therefore, the idea of the picture is that by the union of Karma, Jnana, Bhakti and Yoga, the vision of Paramatman is obtained.&quot;

== Activities ==

The principal workers of the mission are the monks. The mission&#x27;s activities cover the following areas:
* Education
* Healthcare
* Cultural activities
* Rural upliftment
* Tribal welfare
* Youth movement, spiritual teachings

The mission has its own hospitals, charitable dispensaries, maternity clinics, tuberculosis clinics, and mobile dispensaries. It also maintains training centres for nurses. Orphanages and homes for the elderly are included in the mission&#x27;s field of activities, along with rural and tribal welfare work.

The mission has established many renowned educational institutions in India, having its own university, colleges, vocational training centres, high schools and primary schools, teacher-training institutes, as well as schools for the visually handicapped. It has also been involved in disaster relief operations during famine, epidemic, fire, flood, earthquake, cyclone and communal disturbances.

The mission played an important role in the installation of photovoltaic (PV) lighting systems in the Sundarbans region of West Bengal. Due to the geographical features of the Sunderbans, it is very difficult to extend the grid network to supply power to its population. The PV lighting was used to provide electricity to the people who were traditionally depending on kerosene and diesel.

=== Religious activities ===
The mission is a non-sectarian organisation and ignores caste distinctions.

Ramakrishna &quot;ashrama&#x27;s&quot; religious activities include &quot;satsang&quot; and &quot;arati&quot;. &quot;Satsang&quot; includes communal prayers, songs, rituals, discourses, reading and meditation. Arati involves the ceremonial waving of lights before the images of a deity of holy person and is performed twice in a day. Their &quot;ashramas&quot; observes major Hindu festivals, including Maha Shivarathri, Rama Navami, Krishna Ashtami and Durga Puja. They also give special place to the birthdays of Ramakrishna, Sarada Devi, Swami Vivekananda and his other monastic disciples. 1 January is celebrated as Kalpataru Day.

The math and the mission are known for their religious tolerance and respect for other religions. Among the earliest rules laid down by Swami Vivekananda for them was, &quot;&quot;Due respect and reverence should be paid to all religions, all preachers, and to the deities worshiped in all religions&quot;.&quot; Acceptance and toleration of all religions is the one of ideals of Ramakrishna Math and Mission. Along with the major Hindu festivals, Christmas Eve and Buddha&#x27;s birthday are also devoutly observed.
Cyril Veliath a Jesuit of Sophia University writes that the Mission monks are a relatively orthodox set of monks who are &quot;extremely well respected both in India and abroad&quot;, and that they &quot;cannot be classified as just another sect or cult, such as the groups led by the gurus&quot;. Veliath writes that &quot;of the Hindu groups I have worked with I have found the Ramakrishna Mission to be the most tolerant and amenable to dialogue, and I believe that we Christians couldn&#x27;t do better, than to cooperate wholeheartedly in their efforts towards inter-religious harmony.

== Awards and honours ==

 
The Ramakrishna Mission has received numerous accolades throughout its lifetime:
* Bhagwan Mahavir Foundation Award (1996).
* Dr. Ambedkar National Award (1996).
* Dr. Bhawar Singh Porte Tribal Service Award (1997–98).
* In 1998 the Mission was awarded the Indian government&#x27;s prestigious Gandhi Peace Prize.
* Shahid Vir Narayan Singh Award (2001).
* Pt. Ravishankar Shukla Award (2002).
* National Communal Harmony Award (2005).
* The Ramakrishna Mission was selected for an honorary mention of the UNESCO Madanjeet Singh Prize for Promotion of Tolerance and Non violence 2002.
* The Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama Narainpur, Chhattisgarh was jointly selected for the 25th Indira Gandhi Award for National Integration for the year 2009 with musician A.R.Rehman for their services in promoting and preserving national integration.
In a speech made in 1993, Federico Mayor, Director-General of UNESCO, stated:
==Branch centres==

As of March 7, 2022, the Math and Mission have 261 centres all over the world: 198 in India, 26 in Bangladesh, 14 in the United States, two each in Canada, Russia, and South Africa and one each in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Fiji, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Malaysia, Mauritius, Nepal, Netherlands, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, the UK, and Zambia. Besides, there are 44 sub-centres (14 within India, 30 outside India) under different centres.

The centres of the Ramakrishna Order outside India fall into two broad categories. In countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Fiji and Mauritius, the nature of service activities is very similar to India. In other parts of the world, especially in Europe, Canada, the United States, Japan, and Australia, the work is mostly confined to the preaching of Vedanta, the publication of books and journals and personal guidance in spiritual matters. Many of the centres outside India are called as the &#x27;Vedanta Society&#x27; or &#x27;Vedanta Centre&#x27;.

== Controversies ==
In 1980, in an act that caused &quot;considerable debate&quot; within the order, the mission petitioned the courts to have their organisation and movement declared a non-Hindu minority religion for the purpose of Article 30 of the Indian constitution.

Many generations of monks and others have been of the view that the religion propounded and practised by Ramakrishna and his disciples was different from that practised by the Hindu masses then. They held that Ramakrishna&#x27;s &quot;Neo-Vedanta&quot; is a truer version of the ideals of Vedanta. So it was honestly felt that this makes the followers of Ramakrishna eligible for the legal status of &quot;minority&quot;. It is possible that the immediate cause for the appeal for minority status was the danger that the local Marxist government would take control of its educational institutions unless it could invoke the extra protection the Indian constitution accords to minority religions.

While the Calcutta High Court accepted the Mission&#x27;s pleas, the Supreme Court of India ruled against it in 1995, citing evidence that it had all the characteristics of a Hindu organization. The Mission found it advisable to let the matter rest. The wisdom of the attempt by the Mission&#x27;s leadership to characterize the Mission as non-Hindu was widely questioned within the membership of the organization itself, and the leadership today embraces the Mission&#x27;s status as both a Hindu organization and as an organization that emphasizes the harmony of all faiths.

<text>Hans-Christian Ströbele (; 7 June 1939 – 29 August 2022) was a German politician and lawyer. He was a member of Alliance 90/The Greens, the German green party.

== Education and early career ==
Ströbele was born on 7 June 1939 in Halle, Saale, the son of a chemist. He obtained his &quot;Abitur&quot; in 1959 in Marl, Westphalia. Ströbele completed his military service in the early &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;″s Air Force operations in Aurich as a reserve gunner. 

Ströbele studied law and political science at Heidelberg University and at the Free University of Berlin. In 1967, he was a trainee lawyer in the offices of the lawyer Horst Mahler. He practiced law from 1969 in Berlin. 

In the late 1960s Ströbele was involved in the student movement. From 1970 to 1974, he was a member of the SPD. He was also a member of the &quot;Socialist Lawyers&#x27; Collective&quot; for ten years, and rose to national fame defending militants of the urban guerrilla movement Red Army Faction and other political activists. He defended the Kommunard Dieter Kunzelmann, his colleague Mahler, who had joined the RAF, and finally also the leading figures of the terrorist group, Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin and Ulrike Meinhof.

From 1977, Ströbele was involved in founding the left-wing daily newspaper &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hans-Christian Ströbele (MdB Bündnis 90/Die Grünen) 1999&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Ströbele was convicted by the Berlin District Court of supporting terrorist groups through his smuggling of information between members serving in prison. The Court concluded that Ströbele had significantly assisted in keeping the groups active during their leaders&#x27; time in prison.

== Beginnings of the Green Party ==

Ströbele co-founded the &quot;Alternative List for Democracy and Environmental Protection,&quot; a predecessor to the Berlin chapter of the Greens. He was a member of the Bundestag from 31 March 1985 until 1987 (the end of the term). On the Berlin state level, he helped facilitate the red-green coalition of 1989/1990.

Ströbele became the party&#x27;s spokesman in June 1990 but he stood down in February 1991 after opposing the Persian Gulf War. This included opposition to the delivery of Patriot missiles to Israel during an official visit of the party to that country. As of 1992 he continued as assemblyman of the Greens in the Tiergarten borough of Berlin.

== Member of Parliament, 1998–2017 ==
In 1998, when the Greens became the junior partner in a government led by Gerhard Schröder, Ströbele entered the German parliament () through his place on the Green Party&#x27;s electoral list. He served as a member of the Parliamentary Oversight Panel (PKGr), which provides parliamentary oversight of Germany&#x27;s intelligence services. Between 2002 and 2005, Ströbele also served as one of the deputy chairpersons of the Green Party&#x27;s parliamentary group in the Bundestag. He also served as a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs beginning in 2005.

During the early years of the Schröder government Ströbele became opposed to the politics of Green foreign minister Joschka Fischer, in particular the troop deployments in the Kosovo War (1999) as well as Operation Enduring Freedom (2001). Leading an effort to organize a 1999 national party congress to debate the party&#x27;s stand on Kosovo, Ströbele collected 500 signatures from within the party to demand an end to NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia. In 2001, he urged the Greens to leave the coalition government.

During the pre-elections of the Greens to the 2002 German federal election, Ströbele was not given a promising place on the Green Party list, at that point generally assumed to be the only way a Green candidate could gain a seat in parliament according to Germany&#x27;s proportional representation electoral system. In that situation he chose to campaign for a direct mandate in the Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg Prenzlauer Berg East constituency, holding positions that were remarkably different from the Green&#x27;s official election campaign. Unexpectedly he won the direct mandate with 31.6% plurality vote becoming the first Green to hold a direct seat in parliament, and was the only such Green member of parliament from 2002 to 2017. 

In the federal elections of 2005 he won another direct mandate, now with a 43.2% majority of the votes. Given his local reputation, other parties tried to counter him with creative campaigns (notably Vera Lengsfeld&#x27;s &quot;We have more to offer&quot;) for the federal elections of 2009 but again Ströbele won the direct mandate, now by 46.8% of the vote and again with 39.9% in 2013.

In 2011, Ströbele joined Gerhard Schick, Anton Hofreiter and Winfried Hermann in their successful 2011 constitutional complaint against the refusal of Chancellor Angela Merkel&#x27;s government to provide information on the Deutsche Bahn and financial market supervision. In its judgment pronounced in 2017, the Federal Constitutional Court held that the government had indeed failed to fulfill its duty to give answers in response to parliamentary queries and to sufficiently substantiate the reasons.

In December 2016, Ströbele announced that he would not stand in the 2017 federal elections but instead resign from active politics by the end of the parliamentary term. In the 2017 election, Ströbele was succeeded by Alliance 90/The Greens candidate Canan Bayram in his former electoral district.

* German Development Service (DED), Member of the Supervisory Board (1998–2011)

== Political positions ==

=== Military engagement ===
Ströbele consistently voted against the participation of the German Bundeswehr in the NATO-led security mission ISAF in Afghanistan. In 2010, he abstained from the vote on German participation in United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon but subsequently voted against its renewal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hans-Christian Ströbele (MdB Bündnis 90/Die Grünen) 1999_2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In numerous cases, however, Ströbele had voted in favor of German participation in United Nations peacekeeping missions as well as in United Nations-mandated European Union peacekeeping missions on the African continent, such as in Darfur/Sudan (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015), South Sudan (2011, 2012 and 2013), and the Central African Republic (2014). Yet he opposed Operation Atalanta in Somalia (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013), EUTM Mali (2013, 2014 and 2015) and EUTM Somalia (2014, 2015 and 2016). In 2014, he abstained from the vote on a German mandate for the peacekeeping mission EUFOR RCA in the Central African Republic.

=== Intelligence services ===
In 2006, Ströbele was one of the authors of a classified report prepared by a committee of the German Parliament that held closed-door hearings on the role of German intelligence during the Iraq War. The German report confirmed many details in a 2005 classified report by the United States Joint Forces Command which spoke of the German intelligence liaison officer working in coordination with American intelligence in Qatar. However, Ströbele contended that the parliamentary report was largely based on incomplete and partially censored information provided by the German intelligence agency BND and wrote a dissenting comment on the report which he posted on his web site.

On 31 October 2013, Ströbele – then the longest serving member of the parliamentary committee that oversees German intelligence – and journalist Georg Mascolo met with Edward Snowden in Moscow to discuss the possibility of the NSA whistleblower testifying before the German parliamentary committee investigating foreign spying in Germany and obtaining access to cell phone calls on German government officials, including Chancellor Angela Merkel.

=== Visit of Pope Benedict XVI ===
When Pope Benedict XVI addressed members of the German Parliament during his first official visit to Berlin in 2011, Ströbele – who had opposed the pope&#x27;s appearance due to his support for women in the church, gay rights and victims of sexual abuse by priests – stood up and left as the speech began. Benedict then singled his party out for praise, saying that &quot;the emergence of the ecological movement in German politics since the 1970s&quot; represented a &quot;cry for fresh air which must not be ignored or pushed aside.&quot;

=== Eurozone crisis ===
During the Eurozone crisis, Ströbele was the only member of the Green Party&#x27;s parliamentary group to vote against Germany&#x27;s support for implementing a series of financial support measures such as the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and European Stability Mechanism (ESM) in June 2012, citing constitutional objections.

=== Arms exports ===
Following a controversial 2011 deal to export German tanks to Saudi Arabia, Ströbele threatened to appeal to the Federal Constitutional Court should the federal government continue to refuse to release any information. In 2014, he – alongside fellow Green Party parliamentarians Katja Keul and Claudia Roth – lodged a complaint before the Federal Constitutional Court, arguing that it was unconstitutional for the government to keep the Bundestag in the dark about planned arms deals because it prevented the parliament from doing its job of keeping the government in check. The court ruled that while the government did not have to disclose information about planned defense exports, it did have an obligation to provide the Bundestag with details, on request, once specific arms deals had been approved.

==Later life ==
Ströbele left the Bundestag in 2017 at the age of 79 for health reasons; his health continued to deteriorate during his later years. Upon his death at the age of 83, his lawyer released the statement:

He decided himself that he no longer wanted to continue the long ordeal that his illness had imposed on him and he reduced life-sustaining measures. He was fully conscious to the last. Not the spirit, the body became his torment and left him on August 29, 2022. [&quot;Er hat selbst entschieden, dass er den langen Leidensweg, den ihm seine Erkrankungen zugemutet hat, nicht mehr fortsetzen wollte und lebenserhaltende Maßnahmen reduziert. Er war bis zuletzt bei vollem Bewusstsein. Nicht der Geist, der Körper wurde ihm zur Qual und hat ihn am 29. August 2022 verlassen.&quot;]

<doc id="583697" wikidata="Q6752318" url="?curid=583697" title="Manual of The Mother Church">
<text>The Church Manual of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, Massachusetts commonly known as the Manual of The Mother Church is the book that establishes the structure and governance of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, also known as The Mother Church, functioning like a constitution. It was written by Mary Baker Eddy, founder of the church. It was first published in 1895 and was revised dozens of times. The final edition, the 89th, was published in 1910.

== Background ==
Writing in September 1895 to Septimus J. Hanna, then an editor of Christian Science periodicals and First Reader of The Mother Church, Eddy described the work of establishing the various by-laws as having been &quot;impelled&quot; by circumstances which made the need for a rule apparent. The impetus was always the future protection of the church, to fortify its structural integrity by preventing battles for personal control and creeping bureaucracy, and to maintain its spiritual integrity by preventing frivolous experimentation and the intrusions of personal opinion that would eventually adulterate the teaching and doctrine of Christian Science. The final revision of the &quot;Manual&quot;, the 89th edition, was published two weeks after Eddy&#x27;s death in December 1910, although she had approved and signed the proof sheets of the edition before publication.

== Church constitution ==

The &quot;Manual&quot; was first published in 1895. Like a constitution, it establishes the framework for the government and operations of the church, as well as its &quot;basic character&quot;. Its by-laws are organized into 35 articles that establish the duties and responsibilities of church officers, provide guidelines and rules for Christian Science practitioners and teachers, define the responsibilities of individual members and provide the means of discipline. The &quot;Rule for Motives and Acts&quot; (at right) typifies the nature of these by-laws and is the only by-law that was barely changed through the dozens of revisions.

As a lay church, there is no hierarchy. All members, including church officers, are bound by the rules of the &quot;Manual&quot;. Under the &quot;Manual&quot;, the church officers comprising the Board of Directors are charged with administration, and have no authority to govern the church, amend or interpret by-laws or create new ones. Eddy vested the authority for government of the church not in persons, but in the by-laws of the &quot;Manual&quot; itself.

Branch churches are set up to be democratic and independent, related to but not controlled by The Mother Church. The appendix includes membership applications, the order of the church services, Sunday school and testimony meetings, as well as two deeds related to land conveyance for The Mother Church. As legal documents describing the Board of Directors and setting limits to their authority, they cement the legal foundation for Eddy&#x27;s intent regarding the &quot;Manual&quot; as the church&#x27;s constitution. Adam Dickey, Eddy&#x27;s last personal secretary, whom she appointed to the Board of Directors shortly before she died, wrote in 1922, &quot;The safety of the Christian Science church does not rest in the Board of Directors; it lies in the integrity of each individual member, and in the determination of the members to obey the By-laws.&quot;

== Estoppel clauses ==
There are 32 by-laws with &quot;estoppel clauses&quot; in the &quot;Manual&quot;, where Eddy&#x27;s consent is required. A few of her students, including William R. Rathvon and Judge Septimus J. Hanna, concerned about the ramifications of these clauses in the event of her death, urged her to remove them. Henry Moore Baker, a lawyer and politician who was also Eddy&#x27;s cousin, assured her and others in the church that when she was gone clauses in the &quot;Manual&quot; which required her involvement would default to the &quot;next in authority&quot;, which in this case would be the Board of Directors. However, after Eddy&#x27;s passing some people both within and without of the church believed that without Eddy&#x27;s presence the &quot;Manual&quot; could not function as it had before, with some believing the church should dissolve and others that the Trustees of the Christian Science Publishing Society should function as a separate governing body within the church. This culminated in a period of litigation in 1921 when the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld the Baker interpretation that the Board of Directors assumed jurisdiction over the estoppel clauses upon Eddy&#x27;s death. However, according to Eddy biographer Robert Peel, the estoppel clauses still add &quot;moral force&quot; and make it &quot;morally incumbent upon the [Board of] Directors&quot; to take particular care to fulfill the &#x27;spirit and letter&#x27; when considering steps governed by those by-laws.

The 1991 publication of a book by Bliss Knapp again sparked controversy in the church around the estoppel clauses that resulted in another lawsuit. The book, which had previously been refused publication as being incompatible with Eddy&#x27;s teaching, had been named in two wills with a large bequest to the church if it published the book. Critics accused the Board, then in need of funds to cover losses stemming from &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;″s entry into television, of violating the &quot;Manual&quot;″s estoppel clauses in order to receive the funds.

<text>Weatherby, Inc. is an American gun manufacturer founded in 1945 by Roy Weatherby. The company is best known for its high-powered magnum cartridges, such as the .257 Weatherby Magnum, .270 Weatherby Magnum, .300 Weatherby Magnum, .340 Weatherby Magnum and the .460 Weatherby Magnum. The company&#x27;s headquarters is in Sheridan, Wyoming.

==History==
The original production rifles by Roy Weatherby were built on commercial Mauser actions manufactured by FN, Brevex (magnum), and Mathieu (left hand). Weatherby would build a custom rifle from a customer&#x27;s specifications for bespoke rifles, using any action the customer requested - provided the action was strong enough to tolerate the pressures for their desired cartridge. Weatherby manufactured his rifles for many years at his small facility in South Gate, California, until 1956, when he contracted with Sako to continue building his firearms based on the Weatherby-FN Mauser actions. Weatherby still produced some custom rifles in South Gate following this contract.

Weatherby&#x27;s first break from designs based on Mauser actions came in 1956 when he commissioned the Danish firm of Schultz &amp; Larsen to build the 378 Weatherby Magnums utilizing the Schultz &amp; Larsen Model 54 bolt-action. This action was very stout and had several features that Weatherby would integrate into future proprietary rifle designs, including a low bolt-lift and triple gas-escape ports in the bolt.

In 1958, after several years of development, Roy Weatherby introduced the Mark V bolt action, his first proprietary design developed in-house by Weatherby himself and with his head engineer, Fred Jennie. Weatherby had to build the newly designed rifle to withstand the higher pressures the experimental cartridges produced, which exceeded . Pacific Founders, Inc. manufactured the first Weatherby Mark V actions in the United States. Weatherby assembled and finished the rifles at the Weatherby facility in South Gate. The demand for the new Mark V rifles quickly exceeded Weatherby&#x27;s manufacturing capacity, so the company contracted with J. P. Sauer in West Germany to produce the rifles. Manufacturing of the Mark V continued in West Germany until the early 1970s, when material and labor costs led Weatherby to shift production to Howa in Japan. Some say the machining and finishing of the Howa manufactured Mark Vs was an improvement over that of the quality of the Sauer-made guns. Weatherby moved Mark V manufacturing back to the United States in 1995, where the Mark V has been built under contract by both Saco Defense (acquired by General Dynamics in 1998) and Acrometal/ATEK ever since.

The Mark V action remained relatively unchanged during its first five years of production until manufacturing moved from PFI in the United States to J. P. Sauer in Germany. The Sauer-produced version differed from that manufactured in the United States. Weatherby moved the safety from the receiver to the bolt and replaced the smooth surface of the safety found on the U.S.-made versions with a fluted surface. The first major change to the Mark V came in 1963 when Weatherby shortened and trimmed the design of the action around its 224 Weatherby Magnum varmint round, designed in 1964. The bolt in the smaller Mark V action had six locking lugs, as opposed to the nine locking lugs found on the parent rifle chambered in the 378 Weatherby Magnum. Rifles chambered for the new 224 Weatherby Magnum cartridge were dubbed the &quot;Varmintmaster.&quot; Weatherby later offered the Varmintmaster chambered for the 22-250 Remington, making this the first non-Weatherby cartridge offered in the Mark V rifle. A version of the Mark V rifle equipped with a nine-lug bolt and chambered in .30-06 was also made available in 1967. The 30-06 and 22-250 cartridges remained the only two non-Weatherby chamberings offered in production Mark V rifles until the mid-1990s. However, Weatherby would still build a custom Mark V to a customer&#x27;s specifications in virtually any caliber. Weatherby equipped all Mark V rifles made after 1967 that Weatherby chambered for non-Weatherby standard calibers (not magnum cartridges) with the six-lug version of the bolt; this made versions with a nine-lug bolt chambered in 30-06 (whether made in Germany or Japan) somewhat rare.

In the late 1960s, Weatherby contracted with Howa to build a Weatherby rifle that would be more affordable for the average hunter. The result was the Vanguard which Weatherby introduced in 1970, the same year that production of the Mark V moved to Japan. The Vanguard was based on the Howa 1500 bolt action and was initially only offered in standard calibers, and it provided an attractive alternative for buyers in the market for a sporting bolt-action rifle like the Winchester Model 70 or Remington Model 700. Weatherby has since offered the Vanguard chambered for select Weatherby magnum calibers.

In January 2018, the company announced it was relocating from Paso Robles, California to Sheridan, Wyoming.

==Products==

===Rifles===

Weatherby offers only two lines of centerfire rifles: the Mark V and the Vanguard. ATEK manufactures the Mark V barreled action in Brainerd, Minnesota; Howa still manufactures the barrel and action for the Vanguard. Weatherby performs the final assembly of the Mark V and Vanguard at its company headquarters in Sheridan, Wyoming. The Mark V has two action-size variants. Weatherby uses a larger nine-lug bolt-action for all larger Weatherby magnum calibers. Weatherby uses a smaller six-lug action (in two lengths) for the 240 Weatherby and all other non-Weatherby cartridges (as the 224 Weatherby Magnum is no longer a standard option). Both the Mark V and Vanguard are available as sub-MOA rifles which were replaced with &quot;Range Certified&quot; rifles in various models. These variants range from blued to stainless steel metal with kevlar or wooden stocks and are available in calibers, including the .223 Remington (Vanguard only) through to the .300 Weatherby Magnum. Rifles chambered in either the .340 Weatherby Magnum or the .460 Weatherby Magnum are only available on the Mark V as these cartridges require a stronger bolt.

The Weatherby rifles come with a three-shot sub-MOA guarantee of accuracy from a cold bore on all models using Weatherby or premium ammunition. Generally regarded as of higher quality than Remington or Winchester rifles in the same class, Weatherby Mark V rifles are considerably more expensive in terms of unit cost and ammunition. However, Weatherby competitively prices the Vanguard models with other makes and models.

===Scopes===
Weatherby no longer manufactures rifle scopes or other optical products. The company produced a Mark XXI Scope between 1964 and 1989. The company offered the Sightmaster Spotting Scope with magnification ranges of 20x-45x from 1972 to 1982 and 20x-60x from 1983 to 1989. Earlier optics also included the Imperial Scope and were produced for Weatherby by Hertel &amp; Reuss and manufactured in West Germany between 1964 and 1973. Weatherby manufactured its Premier Scopes from 1973 to 1982 and its Supreme Scopes from 1983 to 1994.

===Shotguns===
Weatherby offers a line of shotguns for bird hunting and skeet shooting. Weatherby produces four types of shotguns, each type available in two different models: over-under double barrel, side-by-side double barrel, pump-action, and semi-automatic. Weatherby&#x27;s shotguns (the &quot;D&#x27;Italia&quot; line) are made in Italy through a collaborative effort with Italian gunmaker Fausti Stefano.

===Cartridges===
Firearms designer and cartridge pioneer Charles Newton, often colloquially referred to as the &quot;Father of High Velocity&quot;, was the first to build a hunting cartridge and rifle capable of firing a bullet at over . Weatherby developed its rifles following this new trend in designing high-velocity hunting calibers. In the late 1980s, Remington&#x27;s Ultra Mag series of unbelted magnum cartridges - returning to the Newton-style cartridge design - provided Weatherby with new competition. However, Weatherby still makes the most powerful commercially available hunting cartridge in the world with its .460 Weatherby.

Weatherby has designed almost all of its cartridges with belts; curved, double-radius shoulders; and considerable freebore. The .224 Weatherby Magnum, introduced in 1963, was the first and, for more than 50 years, the only Weatherby cartridge to have an angled shoulder but included the company&#x27;s other distinctive features. The first major departure from the classic Weatherby design was the 6.5 Weatherby Rebated Precision Magnum (often abbreviated as RPM), a non-belted cartridge with an angled shoulder and no freebore introduced in 2019. In 2022, a second cartridge in the RPM family, the .338 Weatherby RPM, was introduced, again with no belt and an angled shoulder.

According to Weatherby&#x27;s website, the company&#x27;s full lineup of cartridges consists of the:
* .224 Weatherby Magnum
* .240 Weatherby Magnum
* .257 Weatherby Magnum
* 6.5 RPM (Rebated Precision Magnum)
* 6.5-300 Weatherby Magnum
* .270 Weatherby Magnum
* 7mm Weatherby Magnum
* .300 Weatherby Magnum
* .338 Weatherby RPM
* .340 Weatherby Magnum
* .30-378 Weatherby Magnum
* .338-378 Weatherby Magnum
* .375 Weatherby Magnum
* .378 Weatherby Magnum
* .416 Weatherby Magnum
* .460 Weatherby Magnum

Weatherby also produced the .220 Weatherby Rocket cartridge, designed by Roy Weatherby. It does not have the typical double-radius shoulder like almost all other Weatherby cartridges, and it is not a belted magnum. Weatherby described it as an &quot;improved&quot; version of the .220 Swift.

Currently, Weatherby offers rifles chambered in the following standard non-Weatherby cartridges:

* .223 Remington
* .22-250 Remington
* .243 Winchester
* .25-06 Remington
* 6.5mm Creedmoor
* 6.5mm PRC
* .270 Winchester
* 7mm Backcountry
* 7mm PRC
* 7mm-08 Remington
* .280 Remington AI
* 7mm Rem Mag
* .308 Winchester
* .30-06 Springfield
* .300 PRC
* .300 Winchester Magnum
* .350 Legend
Weatherby shotguns are available in several common cartridges from the .410 bore up to the 12 gauge.

<text>Jean Dufresne (14 February 1829 – 13 April 1893) was a German chess player and chess composer. He was a student of Adolf Anderssen, to whom he lost the &quot;Evergreen game&quot; in 1852.

==Life==
Dufresne was born and died in Berlin. The son of a wealthy Jewish businessman, he attended law school but was forced to abandon his studies when his father ran into financial difficulties. He subsequently became a journalist.

Dufresne was an unsuccessful novelist under the anagrammatic pseudonym E. S. Freund, but wrote several chess books, one of which, &quot;Kleines Lehrbuch des Schachspiels&quot; (1881, known in Germany as &quot;Der Kleine Dufresne&quot;) ran to many editions and taught several generations of players. In a letter to Paul Dirac at the end of 1929, Werner Heisenberg deemed Dufresne&#x27;s handbook &quot;the best book about theory of Chess&quot;. He also wrote a popular book on Paul Morphy.

His grave is located in the Jewish Cemetery Berlin-Weißensee.

==Notable games==

Dufresne took first in the &quot;Berliner Schachgesellschaft&quot; in 1853 and won an 1854 match against Carl Mayet (+7−5), a member of the Berlin Pleiades. Although he had a negative record against Anderssen, he had a plus record against Daniel Harrwitz, who in turn had a plus record against Anderssen. Here is his win against Harrwitz in Berlin in 1848:

<doc id="583726" wikidata="Q653366" url="?curid=583726" title="Larry Kramer">
<text>Laurence David Kramer (June 25, 1935May 27, 2020) was an American playwright, author, film producer, public health advocate, and gay rights activist. He began his career rewriting scripts while working for Columbia Pictures, which led him to London, where he worked with United Artists. There he wrote the screenplay for the film &quot;Women in Love&quot; (1969) and received an Academy Award nomination for his work.

In 1978, Kramer introduced a controversial and confrontational style in his novel &quot;Faggots&quot;, which earned mixed reviews and emphatic denunciations from elements within the gay community for Kramer&#x27;s portrayal of what he characterized as shallow, promiscuous gay relationships in the 1970s.

Kramer witnessed the spread of the disease later known as Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) among his friends in 1980. He co-founded the Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis (GMHC), which has become the world&#x27;s largest private organization assisting people living with AIDS. Kramer grew frustrated with bureaucratic paralysis and the apathy of gay men to the AIDS crisis, and wished to engage in further action than the social services GMHC provided. He expressed his frustration by writing a play titled &quot;The Normal Heart&quot;, produced at The Public Theater in New York City in 1985.

His political activism continued with the founding of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) in 1987, an influential direct action protest organization with the aim of gaining more public action to fight the AIDS crisis. ACT UP has been widely credited with changing public health policy and the perception of people living with AIDS, and with raising awareness of HIV and AIDS-related diseases.

Kramer was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for his play &quot;The Destiny of Me&quot; (1992), and he was a two-time recipient of the Obie Award.

== Early life ==
Laurence David Kramer was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the younger of two children. His mother, Rea (), worked as a shoe store employee, teacher, and social worker for Red Cross. His father, George Kramer, worked as a government attorney. His older brother, Arthur Kramer was born in 1927. The family was Jewish.

Kramer was considered an &quot;unwanted child&quot; by his parents, who struggled to find work during the American Great Depression. When the family moved to Maryland, they found themselves in a much lower socioeconomic bracket than that of Kramer&#x27;s high school peers. Kramer had become sexually involved with a male friend in junior high school. His father wanted him to marry a woman with money and pressured him to become a member of Pi Tau Pi, a Jewish fraternity.

Kramer&#x27;s father, older brother Arthur, and two uncles were alumni of Yale University. Kramer enrolled at Yale College in 1953, where he had difficulty adjusting. He felt lonely, and earned lower grades than those to which he was accustomed. He attempted suicide by an overdose of aspirin because he felt like he was the &quot;only gay student on campus&quot;. The experience left him determined to explore his sexuality and set him on the path to fight &quot;for gay people&#x27;s worth&quot;. The next semester, he had an affair with his German professor – his first requited romantic relationship with a man. Kramer enjoyed the Varsity Glee Club during his remaining time at Yale, and he graduated in 1957 with a degree in English. He served in the U.S. Army Reserve before beginning his film writing and production career.

== Career ==
=== Early writings ===
According to Kramer, every drama he wrote derived from a desire to understand love&#x27;s nature and its obstacles. Kramer became involved with movie production at age 23 by taking a job as a Teletype operator at Columbia Pictures, agreeing to the position only because the machine was across the hall from the president&#x27;s office. Eventually, he won a position in the story department reworking scripts. His first writing credit was as a dialogue writer for &quot;Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush,&quot; a teen sex comedy. He followed that with the 1969 screenplay &quot;Women in Love&quot;, an adaptation of D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s novel, which was nominated for an Academy Award. He next penned what Kramer later referred to as (the) &quot;only thing I&#x27;m truly ashamed of&quot;, the 1973 musical remake of Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;, a notorious critical and commercial failure with a screenplay based very closely on Capra&#x27;s film. Kramer later said that his well-negotiated fee for this work, skillfully invested by his brother, made him financially self-sufficient during the 1980s and 1990s.

Kramer then began to integrate homosexual themes into his work, and tried writing for the stage. He wrote &quot;Sissies&#x27; Scrapbook&quot; in 1973 (later rewritten and retitled as &quot;Four Friends&quot;), a dramatic play about four friends, one of whom is gay, and their dysfunctional relationships. Kramer called it a play about &quot;cowardice and the inability of some men to grow up, leave the emotional bondage of male collegiate camaraderie, and assume adult responsibilities&quot;. The play was first produced in a theater set up in an old YMCA gymnasium on 53rd Street and Eighth Avenue called the Playwrights Horizons. Live theater moved him to believing that writing for the stage was what he wanted to do. Although the play was given a somewhat favorable review by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, it was closed by the producer and Kramer was so distraught that he decided never to write for the stage again, later stating, &quot;You must be a masochist to work in the theater and a sadist to succeed on its stages.&quot;

Kramer then wrote &quot;A Minor Dark Age&quot;, which was never produced. Frank Rich, in the foreword to a Grove Press collection of Kramer&#x27;s lesser known works, wrote that the &quot;dreamlike quality of the writing is haunting&quot; in &quot;Dark Age&quot;, and that its themes, such as the exploration of the difference between sex and passion, &quot;are staples of his entire output&quot; that would portend his future work, including the 1978 novel &quot;Faggots.&quot;

=== &quot;Faggots&quot; ===
In 1978, Kramer delivered the final of four drafts of a novel that he wrote about the fast lifestyle of the gay men on Fire Island and in Manhattan. In &quot;Faggots&quot;, the primary character was modeled on himself, a man who is unable to find love while encountering the drugs and emotionless sex in the trendy bars and discos. He stated his inspiration for the novel: &quot;I wanted to be in love. Almost everybody I knew felt the same way. I think most people, at some level, wanted what I was looking for, whether they pooh-poohed it or said that we can&#x27;t live like the straight people or whatever excuses they gave.&quot; Kramer researched the book, talking to many men, and visiting various establishments. As he interviewed people, he heard a common question: &quot;Are you writing a negative book? Are you going to make it positive? ... I began to think, &#x27;My God, people must really be conflicted about the lives they&#x27;re leading.&#x27; And that was true. I think people were guilty about all the promiscuity and all the partying.&quot;

The novel caused an uproar in the community it portrayed; it was taken off the shelves of the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookstore – at the time New York City&#x27;s only gay bookstore – and Kramer was banned from the grocery store near his home on Fire Island. Reviewers found it difficult to believe that Kramer&#x27;s accounts of gay relationships were accurate; both the gay and mainstream press panned the book. On the reception of the novel Kramer said: &quot;The straight world thought I was repulsive, and the gay world treated me like a traitor. People would literally turn their back when I walked by. You know what my real crime was? I put the truth in writing. That&#x27;s what I do: I have told the fucking truth to everyone I have ever met.&quot; &quot;Faggots&quot;, however, became one of the best-selling gay novels of all time.

In 2000, Reynolds Price wrote that the novel&#x27;s lasting relevance is that &quot;anyone who searches out present-day responses on the Internet will quickly find that the wounds inflicted by &quot;Faggots&quot; are burning still&quot;. Although the novel was rejected by the people from whom Kramer expected praise, the book has never been out of publication and is often taught in gay studies classes. &quot;&quot;Faggots&quot; struck a chord,&quot; wrote Andrew Sullivan, &quot;It exuded a sense that gay men could do better if they understood themselves as fully human, if they could shed their self-loathing and self-deception...&quot;

=== Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis ===
While living on Fire Island in the 1970s, Kramer had no intention of getting involved in political activism. There were politically active groups in New York City, but Kramer noted the culture on Fire Island was so different that they would often make fun of political activists: &quot;It was not chic. It was not something you could brag about with your friends ... Guys marching down Fifth Avenue was a whole other world. The whole gestalt of Fire Island was about beauty and looks and golden men.&quot;

However, when friends he knew from Fire Island began getting sick in 1980, Kramer became involved in gay activism. In August 1981, although he had not been involved previously with gay activism, Kramer invited the &quot;A-list&quot; (his own term) group of gay men from the New York City area to his apartment to listen to a doctor say their friends&#x27; illnesses were related, and research needed to be done. The next year, they named themselves the Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis (GMHC) and became the primary organization to raise funds for and provide services to people stricken with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in the New York area. Although Kramer served on its first board of directors, his view of how it should be run sharply conflicted with that of the rest of its members. While GMHC began to concentrate on social services for men who were dying, Kramer loudly insisted they fight for funding from New York City. Mayor Ed Koch became a particular target for Kramer, as did the behavior of gay men, before the nature of how the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) was transmitted was understood.

When doctors suggested men stop having sex, Kramer strongly encouraged GMHC to deliver the message to as many gay men as possible. When they refused, Kramer wrote an essay entitled &quot;1,112 and Counting&quot;, which appeared in 1983 in the &quot;New York Native&quot;, a gay newspaper. The essay discussed the spread of the disease, the lack of government response, and the apathy of the gay community. The essay was intended to frighten gay men and provoke them to protest government indifference. Michael Specter wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;it was a five-thousand-word screed that accused nearly everyone connected with health care in America – officials at the Centers for Disease Control, in Atlanta, researchers at the National Institutes of Health, in Washington D.C., doctors at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, in Manhattan, and local politicians (particularly Mayor Ed Koch) – of refusing to acknowledge the implications of the nascent AIDS epidemic. The article&#x27;s harshest condemnation was directed at those gay men who seemed to think that if they ignored the new disease, it would simply go away. Tony Kushner, who won the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for his play &quot;Angels in America&quot; about the impact of AIDS in the United States, described the essay as &quot;With that one piece, Larry changed my world. He changed the world for all of us.&quot;

Kramer&#x27;s confrontational style proved to be an advantage, as it earned the issue of AIDS the attention of the New York media that no other individual could get. He found it a disadvantage when he realized his own reputation was &quot;completely that of a crazy man&quot;. Kramer was particularly frustrated by bureaucratic stalling that snowballed in cases where gay but closeted men were the ones in charge of agencies that seemed to ignore AIDS. He confronted the director of a National Institutes of Health agency about not devoting more time and effort toward researching AIDS because he was closeted. He threw a drink in the face of Republican fundraiser Terry Dolan during a party and screamed at him for having affairs with men but using the fear of homosexuality to raise money for conservative causes. He called Ed Koch and the media and government agencies in New York City &quot;equal to murderers&quot;. Even Kramer&#x27;s personal life was affected when he and his lover – also a GMHC board member – split over Kramer&#x27;s condemnations of the political apathy of GMHC.
Kramer&#x27;s past also compromised his message, as many men who had been turned off by &quot;Faggots&quot; saw Kramer&#x27;s warnings as alarmist, displaying negative attitudes toward sex. Playwright Robert Chesley responded to Kramer&#x27;s &quot;New York Native&quot; article, saying, &quot;Read anything by Kramer closely, and I think you&#x27;ll find the subtext is always: the wages of gay sin are death&quot;. The GMHC ousted Kramer from the organization in 1983. Kramer&#x27;s preferred method of communication was deemed too militant for the group.

In 1990, Kramer appeared in Rosa von Praunheim &#x27;s award-winning film &quot;Positive&quot; about the fight of activists in New York City for AIDS-education and the rights of HIV infected people.

=== &quot;The Normal Heart&quot; ===
Astonished and saddened about being forced out of GMHC, Kramer took an extended trip to Europe. While visiting the Dachau concentration camp he learned that it had opened as early as 1933 and neither Germans nor other nations did anything to stop it. He became inspired to chronicle the same reaction from the American government and the gay community to the AIDS crisis by writing &quot;The Normal Heart&quot;, despite having promised never to write for the theater again.

&quot;The Normal Heart&quot; is a play set between 1981 and 1984. It addresses a writer named Ned Weeks as he nurses his lover, who is dying of an unnamed disease. His doctors are puzzled and frustrated by having no resources to research it. Meanwhile, the unnamed organization Weeks is involved in is angered by the bad publicity Weeks&#x27; activism is generating, and eventually throws him out. Kramer later explained, &quot;I tried to make Ned Weeks as obnoxious as I could ... I was trying, somehow and again, to atone for my own behavior.&quot; The experience was overwhelmingly emotional for Kramer, as at one time during rehearsals he watched actor Brad Davis hold his dying lover played by D. W. Moffett on stage; Kramer went into the bathroom and sobbed, only moments later to find Davis holding him. The play is considered a literary landmark. It contended with the AIDS crisis when few would speak of the disease afflicting gay men, including gays themselves; it remains the longest-running play ever staged at the Public Theater, running for a year starting in 1985. It has been produced over 600 times in the U.S., Europe (where it was televised in Poland), Israel, and South Africa. The Polish television adaptation débuted on the TVP channel on May 4, 1989, one month before the first free election in the country since 1928.

Actors following Davis who have portrayed Kramer&#x27;s alter ego Ned Weeks include; Joel Grey, Richard Dreyfuss (in Los Angeles), Martin Sheen (at the Royal Court in London), Tom Hulce and then John Shea in the West End, Raul Esparza in a highly acclaimed 2004 revival at the Public Theater, and most recently Joe Mantello on Broadway at the Golden Theater. Upon seeing the production of &quot;The Normal Heart&quot;, Naomi Wolf commented, &quot;No one else on the left at that time ... ever used the moral framework that is so much a part of Kramer&#x27;s voice, and that the right has coopted so skillfully. Conscience, responsibility, calling; truth and lies, clarity of purpose or abandonment of one&#x27;s moral calling; loyalty and betrayal ...&quot;

In a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Frank Rich said:
In 2014, HBO produced a film version directed by Ryan Murphy with a screenplay by Kramer. It starred Mark Ruffalo, Matt Bomer (who won a Golden Globe Award for his performance), Taylor Kitsch, Jim Parsons, Alfred Molina, Julia Roberts, Joe Mantello, Jonathan Groff, and BD Wong.

=== ACT UP ===

In 1987, Kramer was the catalyst in the founding of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), a direct action protest organization that chose government agencies and corporations as targets to publicize lack of treatment and funding for people with AIDS. ACT UP was formed at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Services Center in New York City. Kramer was asked to speak as part of a rotating speaker series, and his well-attended speech focused on action to fight AIDS. He began by having two-thirds of the room stand up, and told them they would be dead in five years. Kramer reiterated the points introduced in his essay &quot;1,112 and Counting&quot;: &quot;If my speech tonight doesn&#x27;t scare the shit out of you, we&#x27;re in real trouble. If what you&#x27;re hearing doesn&#x27;t rouse you to anger, fury, rage, and action, gay men will have no future here on earth. How long does it take before you get angry and fight back?&quot; Their first target became the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which Kramer accused of neglecting badly needed medication for HIV-infected Americans.

Engaging in civil disobedience that would result in many people being arrested was a primary objective, as it would focus attention on the target. On March 24, 1987, 17 people out of 250 participating were arrested for blocking rush-hour traffic in front of the FDA&#x27;s Wall Street offices. Kramer was arrested dozens of times working with ACT UP, and the organization grew to hundreds of chapters in the U.S. and Europe. Immunologist Anthony Fauci stated, &quot;In American medicine there are two eras. Before Larry and after Larry.&quot; Playwright Tony Kushner offered his opinion of why Kramer fought so relentlessly: &quot;In a way, like a lot of Jewish men of Larry&#x27;s generation, the Holocaust is a defining historical moment, and what happened in the early 1980s with AIDS felt, and was in fact, holocaustal to Larry.&quot;

Two decades later Kramer continued to advocate for social and legal equity for homosexuals. &quot;Our own country&#x27;s democratic process declares us to be unequal, which means, in a democracy, that our enemy is you,&quot; he wrote in 2007. &quot;You treat us like crumbs. You hate us. And sadly, we let you.&quot;

In later decades, Kramer also continued to argue for funding research into cures for AIDS, contending that existing treatments disincentivized the pharmaceutical industry from developing cures. This distrust of the industry was demonstrated in Kramer&#x27;s final public statement about curing AIDS, via a question posed to Joe Biden at a town hall during the 2020 presidential campaign, in which he accused pharmaceutical companies of &quot;profit[ing] irrationally from HIV-positive Americans who depend on the medications forever,&quot; and asking &quot;as president, how would you finance a CURE and scale back the avarice of pharmaceutical companies.&quot;

=== &quot;Just Say No, A Play about a Farce&quot; ===

Continuing his commentary on government indifference toward AIDS, Kramer wrote &quot;Just Say No, A Play about a Farce&quot; in 1988. In the dramatic work he highlighted the sexual hypocrisy in the Reagan and Koch administrations that allowed AIDS to become an epidemic; it concerns a First Lady, her gay son, and the closeted gay mayor of America&#x27;s &quot;largest northeastern city&quot;. Its New York production, starring Kathleen Chalfant, Tonya Pinkens, and David Margulies, was prized by the few who came to see it after its negative review by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Social critic and writer Susan Sontag wrote of the piece, &quot;Larry Kramer is one of America&#x27;s most valuable troublemakers. I hope he never lowers his voice.&quot;

=== &quot;Reports from the Holocaust: The Making of an AIDS Activist&quot; ===

First published in 1989, and later expanded and republished in 1994, &quot;Reports from the Holocaust: The Making of an AIDS Activist&quot; contains a diverse selection of the non-fiction writings of Larry Kramer focused on AIDS activism and LGBT civil rights, including letters to the editor and speeches, which document his time spent at Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis, ACT UP, and beyond, with the updated edition being organised chronologically from 1978 to 1993.

The central message of the book is that gay men must accept responsibility for their lives, and that those who are still living must give back to their community by fighting for People With AIDS and LGBT rights, for, as Kramer states, &quot;I must put back something into this world for my own life, which is worth a tremendous amount. By not putting back, you are saying that your lives are worth shit, and that we deserve to die, and that the deaths of all our friends and lovers have amounted to nothing. I can&#x27;t believe that in your heart of hearts you feel this way. I can&#x27;t believe you want to die. Do you?&quot; The first publication provides a portrait of Kramer as activist, and the 1994 edition contains commentary written by him that reflects on his earlier pieces and provides insight into Larry Kramer as writer.

Kramer directly and deliberately defines AIDS as a holocaust because he believes the United States&#x27; government failed to respond quickly and expend the necessary resources to cure AIDS, largely because AIDS initially infected gay men, and, quite soon after, predominantly poor and politically powerless minorities. In &quot;Report from the Holocaust&quot;, he wrote: &quot;One inadvertent fall-out from &quot;the&quot; Holocaust is the growing inability to view any other similar tragedies as awful&quot;. Through speeches, editorials, and personal, sometimes publicized, letters to figures such as politician Gary Bauer, former New York Mayor Ed Koch, several &quot;New York Times&quot; reporters, and head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Anthony Fauci, Kramer personally advocates for a more significant response to AIDS. He implores the government to conduct research based on commonly accepted scientific standards and to allocate funds and personnel to AIDS research. Kramer ultimately states that the response to AIDS in America must be defined as a holocaust because of the large number deaths that resulted from the negligence and apathy that surrounded AIDS in the Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and early Bill Clinton presidencies.

=== &quot;The Destiny of Me&quot; ===

&quot;The Destiny of Me&quot; picks up where &quot;The Normal Heart&quot; left off, following Ned Weeks as he continues his journey fighting those whose complacency or will impede the discovery of a cure for a disease from which he suffers. The play opened in October 1992 and ran for one year off Broadway at the Lucille Lortel Theatre by the Circle Repertory Company. It was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, was a double Obie Award winner and received the Lortel Award for Outstanding Play of the Year. The original production starred John Cameron Mitchell, &quot;a young actor who dominates the show with a performance at once ethereal and magnetic&quot;, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer Frank Rich. Most powerful, Rich wrote, was the thematic question Kramer posed to himself: &quot;Why was he of all people destined to scream bloody murder with the aim of altering the destiny of the human race?&quot; Kramer states in his introduction to the play:

Its 2002 London Finborough Theatre production was the No. 1 Critics Choice in &quot;The Evening Standard&quot;.

=== &quot;The Tragedy of Today&#x27;s Gays&quot; ===

&quot;Tragedy&quot; was a speech and a call to arms that Kramer delivered five days after the 2004 re-election of George W. Bush and later published as a book. Kramer believed that Bush was re-elected largely because of his opposition to same-sex marriage, and found it inconceivable that voters would respond so strongly to that issue when there were so many more pressing ones:

The speech&#x27;s effects were far-reaching and had most corners of the gay world once again discussing Kramer&#x27;s moral vision of drive and self-worth for the LGBT community.

Kramer even stated: &quot;Does it occur to you that we brought this plague of AIDS upon ourselves? I know I am getting into dangerous waters here but it is time. With the cabal breathing even more murderously down our backs it is time. And you are still doing it. You are still murdering each other.&quot;

Kramer, again, had his detractors from the community. Writing for Salon.com, Richard Kim felt that once again Kramer personified the very object of his criticism: homophobia.
=== &quot;The American People: A History&quot; ===
Around 1981, Kramer began researching and writing a manuscript called &quot;The American People: A History&quot;, an ambitious historical work that begins in the Stone Age and continues into the present. For example, there is information relating to Kramer&#x27;s assertion that Abraham Lincoln was gay. In 2002, Will Schwalbe, editor-in-chief of Hyperion Books – the only man to have read the entire manuscript to that date – said, &quot;He has set himself the hugest of tasks,&quot; and he described it as &quot;staggering, brilliant, funny, and harrowing.&quot; In 2006, Kramer said of the work, &quot;[It is] my own history of America and of the cause of HIV/AIDS ... Writing and researching this history has convinced me that the plague of HIV/AIDS has been intentionally allowed to happen.&quot;

The book was published as a novel by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux in 2015. In &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, Dwight Garner wrote, &quot;I wish I could report that &quot;The American People, Volume 1&quot; had power to match its scope. It does not. As a work of sustained passion, it is formidable. As a work of art, it is very modest indeed. The tone is talky and digressive; few real characters emerge; one feels lashed to the mast after only 50 pages or so.&quot; In the book, Kramer writes that in addition to Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Andrew Jackson, Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, Mark Twain, Herman Melville, and Richard Nixon were gay. The second volume, 880 pages, was published in 2020.

=== Larry Kramer Initiative for Lesbian and Gay Studies ===
In 1997, Kramer approached Yale University, to bequeath several million dollars &quot;to endow a permanent, tenured professorship in gay studies and possibly to build a gay and lesbian student center.&quot; At that time, gender, ethnic and race-related studies were viewed warily by academia. The then Yale provost, Alison Richard, stated that gay and lesbian studies was too narrow a specialty for a program in perpetuity. Kramer&#x27;s rejected proposal read: &quot;Yale is to use this money solely for 1) the study of and/or instruction in gay male literature, by which I mean courses to study gay male writers throughout history or the teaching to gay male students of writing about their heritage and their experience. To ensure for the continuity of courses in either or both of these areas tenured positions should be established; and/or 2) the establishment of a gay student center at Yale.&quot;

In 2001, both sides settled upon establishing the Larry Kramer Initiative for Lesbian and Gay Studies, which would include visiting professors and a program of conferences, guest speakers and other events. Arthur Kramer endowed the program at Yale with $1 million to support a five-year trial. Kramer agreed to leave his literary papers and those chronicling the AIDS movement and his founding of GMHC and ACT UP to Yale&#x27;s Beinecke Library. &quot;A lot has changed since I made my initial demands,&quot; said Kramer. &quot;I was trying to cram stuff down their throat. I&#x27;d rather they fashion their own stuff. It may allow for a much more expandable notion of what lesbian and gay studies really is.&quot; The five-year program ended in 2006.

===&quot;An Army of Lovers Must Not Die&quot;===
In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Kramer began to write a play titled &quot;An Army of Lovers Must Not Die&quot;.

== Personal life ==
=== Relationship with his brother ===
Larry and Arthur Kramer were eight years apart. Arthur was the founding partner of the law firm Kramer Levin. Their relationship was portrayed in Kramer&#x27;s &quot;The Normal Heart&quot; (1984). In the play, Kramer portrays Arthur (as Ben Weeks) as more concerned with building his $2 million house in Connecticut than helping his brother&#x27;s cause. Humorist Calvin Trillin, a friend of both Larry and Arthur, once called &quot;The Normal Heart&quot; &quot;the play about the building of [Arthur&#x27;s] house&quot;. Anemona Hartocollis observed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;their story came to define an era for hundreds of thousands of theatergoers&quot;. Arthur, who had protected his younger brother from the parents they both disliked, could neither reject Larry, nor accept his homosexuality. This caused years of arguing and stretches of silence between them. In the 1980s, Arthur refused Larry&#x27;s request for Kramer Levin to represent the fledgling Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis, blaming the need to clear it with his firm&#x27;s intake committee. When Larry called for a boycott of MCI, a prominent Kramer Levin client, Arthur took it as a personal affront. In 1992, after Colorado voters endorsed Amendment 2, an anti-gay rights referendum, Larry supported a boycott of the state, while Arthur refused to cancel a ski trip to Aspen.

Throughout their disagreements, the two remained close. In &quot;The Normal Heart&quot;, Larry wrote: &quot;The brothers love each other a great deal; [Arthur&#x27;s] approval is essential to [Larry].&quot;

In 2001, Arthur endowed a $1 million grant for Yale University to establish the Larry Kramer Initiative for Lesbian and Gay Studies, a program focusing on gay history.

Kramer Levin LLP would later become a staunch advocate for the gay rights movement, assisting the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund on high-profile cases as &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; before the U.S. Supreme Court and &quot;Hernandez v. Robles&quot; before the New York Court of Appeals. Arthur Kramer retired from the firm in 1996 and died from a stroke in 2008.

=== Health ===
In 1988, stress over the closing of his play &quot;Just Say No&quot;, only a few weeks after its opening, forced Kramer into the hospital after it aggravated a congenital hernia. While in surgery, doctors discovered liver damage due to hepatitis B, prompting Kramer to learn that he was HIV positive.

In 2001, at the age of 66, Kramer was in dire need of a liver transplant, but he was turned down by Mount Sinai Hospital&#x27;s organ transplant list. People living with HIV were routinely considered inappropriate candidates for organ transplants because of complications from HIV and perceived short lifespans. Out of the 4,954 liver transplants performed in the United States, only 11 were for HIV-positive people. The news prompted &quot;Newsweek&quot; to announce Kramer was dying in June 2001; the Associated Press in December of the same year mistakenly reported Kramer&#x27;s death. Kramer became a symbol for infected people who had new leases on life due to advances in medicine. &quot;We shouldn&#x27;t face a death sentence because of who we are or who we love&quot;, he said in an interview. In May 2001, the Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation Institute at the University of Pittsburgh, which had performed more transplants for HIV positive patients than any other facility in the world, accepted Kramer as a potential transplant recipient. Kramer received a new liver on December 21, 2001. In April 2019 he suffered a broken leg.

===Relationships===
Kramer and his partner, architectural designer David Webster, were together from 1991 until Kramer&#x27;s death. Webster&#x27;s ending of his relationship with Kramer in the 1970s had inspired Kramer to write &quot;Faggots&quot; (1978). When asked about their reunion decades later, Webster replied: &quot;He&#x27;d grown up, I&#x27;d grown up.&quot; On July 24, 2013, Kramer and Webster married in the intensive care unit of NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City while Kramer recovered from surgery.

=== Residence ===
Kramer divided his time between a residence in Manhattan, near Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village, and Connecticut. Another resident of Kramer&#x27;s Manhattan residential complex was Kramer&#x27;s longtime nemesis, Ed Koch, who had been mayor of New York City from 1978 to 1989. The two saw each other relatively infrequently, since they lived in different towers. When Kramer saw Koch looking at the apartment in 1989, Kramer reportedly told him, &quot;Don&#x27;t move in here! There are people here who hate you!&quot; On another occasion, Koch tried to pet Kramer&#x27;s Wheaten Terrier dog, Molly, in the building&#x27;s mail area, and Kramer snatched the dog away, telling her that Koch was &quot;the man who killed all of Daddy&#x27;s friends.&quot;

=== Death ===
Kramer died of pneumonia on May 27, 2020, at age 84, less than a month short of his 85th birthday.

<text>The Blackburn B-24 Skua was a carrier-based low-wing, two-seater, single-radial engine aircraft by the British aviation company Blackburn Aircraft. It was the first Royal Navy carrier-borne all-metal cantilever monoplane aircraft, as well as the first dive bomber in Fleet Air Arm (FAA) service. The aircraft took its name from the sea bird which &#x27;divebombs&#x27; any potential predators that come too close to its nest.

The Skua was designed during the mid-1930s to Specification O.27/34, and was a radical design for the era, combining the functions of a dive bomber and fighter. Its enclosed cockpit and monoplane configuration were obvious shifts from preceding FAA aircraft such as the Hawker Nimrod and Hawker Osprey biplanes. On 9 February 1937, the first prototype performed its maiden flight; it was ordered straight off the drawing board to accelerate its development. In November 1938, the Skua was introduced to FAA service; 33 aircraft were operational by the outbreak of the Second World War.

During the early half of the conflict, the Skua was heavily involved in the Norwegian campaign and sank the , the first major warship sunk in war by air attack and by dive-bombers. It was present during the Battles of Narvik, the Dunkirk evacuation and also the early stages of the Mediterranean theatre. While a capable dive bomber, its poor top speed and rate of climb meant it was severely limited as a fighter aircraft. Despite this, Fleet Air Arm pilots achieved moderate success with the Skua, scoring numerous aerial victories during the Norwegian and Mediterranean campaigns, with at least one pilot making ace status with five victories. In 1941, the Skua was relegated from frontline operations, but continued to be operated in secondary roles, typically training and target tug duties, as late as March 1945.

==Development==
The origins of the Skua can be traced back to the Air Ministry&#x27;s issuing of Specification O.27/34, which sought a naval dive bomber whose primary role would be to disable or destroy enemy aircraft carriers with a secondary role as a fighter. Blackburn chose to produce its own response under the internal design reference &quot;B-24&quot;, the design effort was headed by the aeronautical engineer G. E. Petty. Many competing companies also responded, including Avro, Boulton Paul, Hawker and Vickers. Blackburn&#x27;s submission would emerge as the victor, despite several of the competing proposals adopting similar layouts. Being Blackburn&#x27;s first dive bomber, the design was occasionally referred to as the &quot;D.B.1&quot;.

During April 1935, Blackburn received an initial order for a pair of prototypes. On 9 February 1937, the first of these, serial number &quot;K5178&quot;, performed its maiden flight from the company&#x27;s facility in Brough, piloted by A. M. Blake. Unusually, it was initially painted in a distinctive grey-and-white colour scheme. On 26 June, the aircraft was first displayed to the public at RAF Hendon, London, and performed an aerial display at RAF Hatfield Woodhouse two days later. Two months later, the &quot;Skua&quot; name was officially assigned to the type by the Air Ministry.

During the latter part of 1937, the aircraft underwent official handling trials with the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&amp;AEE) at RAF Martlesham Heath. On 4 May 1938, the second prototype performed its first flight; it differed from the first by having a longer nose. Both of the prototypes would participate in the various tests, including gunnery trials, that were performed at Martlesham up until early 1939. Ditching trials were also undertaken at RAF Gosport.

Both prototypes were powered by the Bristol Mercury XII radial engine; however, production Skuas were instead powered by the Bristol Perseus XII, largely due to the Mercury engine being prioritised for Bristol Blenheim production. Another change made on production aircraft was the elimination of the wing tip slots, as they were deemed unnecessary after handling tests revealed mild stall characteristics. Due to the growing urgency for more combat aircraft in the runup to the Second World War, an initial production contract for 190 Skuas was issued in July 1935, effectively being ordered straight from the drawing board. To accelerate production, it was decided to produce the mainplanes at the Olympia Works in Leeds, while a subcontracting arrangement with General Aircraft Limited saw this company build additional fuselages at its Hanworth facility.

On 28 August 1938, the first production Skua Mk.II, &quot;L2867&quot;, performed its first flight at Brough, piloted by H. J. Wilson. Both it and the second production aircraft were dispatched to Martlesham to accelerate the last stage of performance trials, which included armament trials. According to the aviation author Aubrey Joseph Jackson, despite the relatively radical nature of the design, relatively few changes were recommended either by the Air Ministry or the engine manufacturer; one of the few modifications requested was the strengthening of the wingtips and a substitute tail oleo. Almost all of the production run was completed and delivered prior to the end of 1939, 26 Skuas were delivered during the month of July alone. However, due to delays in the overall programme, the Admiralty had also ordered the Fairey Fulmar to perform the same role.

==Design==
The Blackburn Skua was configured as a low-wing cantilever monoplane of all-metal construction. Its fuselage drew on the design of the Blackburn Shark, an earlier biplane, making extensive use of flush-riveted Alclad. It was internally divided into two water-tight compartments beneath the pilot&#x27;s and gunner&#x27;s cockpits to provide sufficient buoyancy in the event of a forcing landing at sea. For the same reason, the crew compartments were also watertight up to the edges of the cockpit. The fuselage was stressed to withstand catapult-assisted takeoffs and arrested landings aboard aircraft carriers; a hydraulic damping device was incorporated in the hook.

The mainplane, both the structure and covering of which was also composed of Alclad, was built as three separate units. The twin-spar heavy centre section was bolted beneath the fuselage to form the bottom of the watertight compartment. The outer wing panels, which tapered in both plan and thickness, ended in detachable upswept tips and were sealed between the main spars to form additional watertight compartments. Recesses in the lower surface of the wing accommodated modified Zap flaps that were used to shorten takeoff runs, steepen glides, and limit the aircraft&#x27;s speed during steep dives. Balanced ailerons were fitted, which used inset hinges with mass balance assistance.

Considerable design complexity was incurred by the choice to have both a retractable undercarriage and folding wings; the solution drew on the earlier Blackburn Airedale monoplane. When folded, the wings moved back around an inclined hinge housed within the wing, enabling a twist in the movement so that they rest against the fuselage; latch pins were used to secure them in place. The main undercarriage retracted both outwards and upwards into circular wheel wells in the underside of the outer wing panels, the motion being powered by an engine-driven hydraulic pump. The tail wheel unit was fitted with a Dowty-supplied self-centering shock absorber strut and an electrically conductive tyre. Both tailplane and fin were metal-clad cantilever structures that bolted directly onto the rear frames of the fuselage. Controllable trim tabs and a horn-balanced rudder were fitted, to ensure rapid spin recovery, a portion of the tailplane and the entirety of the fabric-covered elevator was positioned behind the trailing edge of the rudder.

The crew were accommodated beneath an enclosed glazed cockpit enclosure strengthened by two fuselage frames that formed a crash pylon in the event of the aircraft turning over. It was the Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s first service monoplane and was a radical departure for a force that was primarily equipped with open-cockpit biplanes such as the Fairey Swordfish. The pilot&#x27;s position featured a sliding hood and was provided with favourable visibility in most forward-facing directions, while the gunner was seated after of the wing beneath a tilting canopy that could be opened or closed dependent on whether the defensive gun was being operated. This machine gun was stored in a compartment within the rear decking when not in use.

Various key elements of the aircraft were housed between the pilot and gunner&#x27;s positions. A wireless compartment was positioned directly behind the pilot. The majority of the fuel was stored in two tanks positioned between the crew members, with a reserve tank in the forward fuselage; the pilot could select for fuel to be drawn from any combination of these tanks via a single selector cock. Just forward of the pilot&#x27;s instrumentation was a tank for lubricating oil. The aircraft&#x27;s armament of four fixed, forward-firing 0.303 in Browning machine guns in the wings and a single flexible, rearward-firing .303 in Vickers K machine gun was considered to be effective for the era. For the dive-bombing role, a or bomb was carried on a special swinging &quot;trapeze&quot; crutch under the fuselage (somewhat like that of the Junkers Ju 87), which enabled the bomb to clear the propeller arc on release. Four bombs or eight Cooper bombs could also be carried in racks under each wing.

Its performance as a fighter was compromised by its dual role as a dive bomber. The size of the two-seat aircraft, and the extra strengthening of the air frame required to allow it to withstand the stresses of sustained high-speed dives, meant it was a relatively heavy single-engined aircraft at gross, compared to for the Spitfire Mk1. That was compounded by various features included to suit its naval use, such as an arrester hook, folding wings, a relatively large fuel capacity, watertight compartments, rafts, and a rear gunner/observer. That weight, coupled with the limited power from the Perseus engine, meant the aircraft had a low rate of climb compared to contemporary Japanese Mitsubishi A5M and American Grumman F3F carrier-borne fighters along with the Royal Navy&#x27;s Gloster Sea Gladiator. The Skua was designed for best performance at low altitude, where its speed was comparable to potential enemy bomber aircraft, and the Skua, with four wing-mounted Browning machine guns, was much better armed than any other nation&#x27;s pre-war naval fighter, such as the Mitsubishi A5M &quot;Claude&quot; and the Grumman F3F, having only two machine guns each. All those naval fighters compared unfavourably with land-based fighters such as the Messerschmitt Bf 109, which reached at sea level over the Skua&#x27;s , and the Gloster Sea Gladiator&#x27;s . However the Skua in the fighter role was never intended or envisaged to take on land-based fighters such as the Messerschmitt Bf 109. The Royal Navy and RAF (who at the time its specification was drawn up operated aircraft carrier air wings) only intended the aircraft to take on enemy reconnaissance and bomber aircraft. 

The Skua was, however, an effective dive bomber, which was arguably its main intended role. It scored numerous successes as a dive bomber in the Norwegian campaign, sinking and damaging a number of ships, most notably the German cruiser &quot;Königsberg&quot; on 10 April 1940. Royal Navy test pilot Captain Eric &#x27;Winkle&#x27; Brown stated:

==Operational history==
During late 1938, initial deliveries of the Skua commenced; the first unit to receive it was 800 Naval Air Squadron at Worth Down, supplementing and eventually replacing their Hawker Nimrod and Hawker Osprey biplanes. By November, the squadron had embarked on and, during 1939, was followed by both 801 and 803 Squadrons. By the start of the Second World War, there were 33 operational Skuas; the type quickly proved itself in combat. On 14 September, three Skuas took off from &quot;Ark Royal&quot; to go to the aid of the which had been attacked by a U-boat. When they arrived, the &quot;Fanad Head&quot; was being shelled by the and all three dived to attack the submarine, which quickly dived to safety. Two of the Skuas were damaged by the blast of their 112 lb A/S bombs and had to ditch. This was due to that the bombs had been wrongly fused with too brief a time lapse. As a result of this error the weapons detonated almost instantaneously, thus badly damaging the Skuas. &quot;U-30&quot; returned to Germany with the crews of the two ditched Skuas, who became the first naval airmen to be prisoners of war in the conflict.

Skuas were originally credited with the first confirmed kill by British aircraft during the Second World War: on 26 September 1939, three Skuas of 803 Naval Air Squadron, flying from &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, shot down a Dornier Do 18 flying boat over the North Sea. (An earlier victory by a Fairey Battle on 20 September 1939 over Aachen, was later confirmed by French sources). On 10 April 1940, 16 Skuas of 800 and 803 NAS led by Lieutenant Commander William Lucy, flying from RNAS Hatston in the Orkney Islands made a 330 mile night flight to arrive at the very limit of their radius - at dawn over Bergen Harbour. They attacked and sank the with several direct hits. Jackson wrote of the sinking as being the highpoint of the Skua&#x27;s career as a dive-bomber. &quot;Königsberg&quot; was the first major warship ever sunk in war by air attack and the first major warship ever to be sunk by dive bombing. On 26 and 27 April Skuas destroyed eight He 111 bombers and damaged several more whilst defending the fleet.
 
During June 1940, Skuas of 801 Squadron flew from shore bases in Kent in support of the Dunkirk evacuation, acting as a unit of RAF Fighter Command. However, these Skuas were attacked on several occasions by RAF fighters who were unfamiliar with the aircraft and its paint scheme, with at least one aircraft being shot up by Spitfires and the gunner killed. It was to later crash land at Manston airfield. Following replenishment, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; brought along a flight of Skuas on its deployment into the Mediterranean later that year; it was these Skuas that dive-bombed the in Dakar in September 1940.

On 13 June 1940, two mostly-Skua squadrons suffered heavy losses during an attempt to bomb the at Trondheim; of 15 aircraft in the raid, eight were shot down and the crews killed or taken prisoner. Among the latter were both squadron commanders, Captain RT Partridge (RM) and Lieutenant Commander John Casson (RN). One bomb hit &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;; however, this did little damage.

Despite its limitations, the Skua attained considerable success as a fighter against Axis bombers and flying boats over Norway, and to a lesser extent, in the Mediterranean in the early stages of the conflict. In action off Norway Skuas destroyed 28 Luftwaffe aircraft in air to air combat, including 17 He 111s and five Ju 88s; all kills being confirmed via Luftwaffe records. Lieutenant Commander William Lucy went on to become a fighter ace while flying his Skua. However, as the war intensified, the Skua was found to be too slow and under powered to be an effective fleet defence fighter. Common Axis foes such as the Junkers Ju 88 and Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 were significantly faster than the Skua, making interception of these aircraft extremely difficult. Also its armament of four forward firing .303 rifle caliber machine guns was becoming increasingly inadequate for this role. Thus the type was withdrawn from front line service during 1941. Most Skuas were replaced by another two-seater, the Fairey Fulmar, which doubled the Skua&#x27;s forward armament and had a speed advantage of . A number of aircraft were converted to target tugs, following withdrawal from front line service. Others were completed as target tugs from the factory and used by the RAF and Fleet Air Arm in this role (Fleet Requirements). They were also used as advanced trainers for the Fleet Air Arm. The last Skua in service was struck off charge in March 1945.

The Blackburn Roc was a very similar aircraft developed as a turret fighter, with all its armament in a turret. The Roc was expected to fly with the Skua. Rocs were attached to Skua squadrons to protect the fleet anchorage at Scapa Flow in early 1940 and briefly from and &quot;Ark Royal&quot; during the Norwegian Campaign. Skuas and Rocs flew fighter sweeps and bombing sorties over the English Channel during Operation Dynamo and Operation Aerial, the evacuations of Allied forces from Dunkirk and other French ports.

==Variants==
;Skua Mk.I
:Two prototypes. Powered by the Bristol Mercury, it had distinctive fairings to the engine cowling over the tappet valves of the Mercury. The first prototype, K5178, had a much shorter nose while K5179, the second prototype, had a lengthened nose to improve longitudinal stability.
;Skua Mk.II
:Production aircraft powered by the sleeve valve Bristol Perseus. Long nose as per K5179 but with a shorter, smooth cowling. Two-seat fighter and dive bomber for the Royal Navy; 190 built by Blackburn at Brough Aerodrome.

==Surviving aircraft==

No intact Skuas survive. In April 2007 the only known nearly complete Blackburn Skua was discovered in Orkdalsfjorden in Norway at depth. Due to an engine failure, the Skua, flown by John Casson, leader of 803 Squadron, had to make an emergency water landing in the fjord. Both crew members survived and spent the next five years as prisoners of war. Despite efforts to raise the aircraft to the surface as gently as possible, the tail broke off. The engine had become detached in the ditching. The fuselage, cockpit and wings were salvaged. The Skua will be restored at Norway&#x27;s aviation museum in Bodø. In 1974, L2940 was recovered from Breidalsvatnet lake, near Grotli in Skjåk Municipality in Norway. Captain R. T. Partridge (RM) shot down a Heinkel He 111 and then made an emergency landing on the ice-covered lake on 27 April 1940. Survivors from both aeroplanes independently made their way to a mountain lodge, where they encountered each another. This incident serves as the basis for the film &quot;Into the White&quot;.

<text>Prestwick () is a town in South Ayrshire on the west coast of Ayrshire in Scotland about southwest of Glasgow. It adjoins the larger town of Ayr to the south on the Firth of Clyde coast, the centre of which is about south, and the small village of Monkton to the north. It had a population of 14,901 at the 2011 census.

Glasgow Prestwick Airport is on the town&#x27;s outskirts, providing passenger flights to European and historically, transatlantic destinations, as well as international cargo flights.

The town was the first home of the Open Golf Championship, which was played on the Prestwick Old Course from 1860 to 1872.

== History ==
Prestwick&#x27;s name comes from the Old English for, &quot;priest&#x27;s farm&quot;: &quot;preost&quot; meaning &quot;priest&quot; and &quot;wic&quot; meaning &quot;farm&quot;. The town was originally an outlying farm of a religious house. George T. Flom suggested that the name was of Old Norse origin. In this case, it would mean &quot;priest&#x27;s bay&quot;.

From Robert the Bruce is reputed to have been cured of leprosy by the waters of the well at St Ninians church. The well still exists behind the church.

Although it has been a Burgh of Barony for over a thousand years, it was a village until the railway arrived in the 1840s and the middle class from Glasgow started to build large houses along the coast. Prestwick Burgh Hall was completed in around 1837.

The Prestwick Bathing Lake, known as the Lido, was opened in 1931 by the Secretary of State for Scotland, William Adamson. It was the largest swimming pool north of the border. It could accommodate 1200 bathers and 3000 spectators. It hosted swimming galas, diving exhibitions, moonlight swimming sessions and regular fireworks displays and was the venue of some of the Miss Scotland competitions. It was closed in 1972 and subsequently demolished.

On 28 August 1944, a Douglas C-54 Skymaster (42-72171) of the United States Army Air Forces, on approach into Glasgow Prestwick Airport in bad weather, crashed into a residential area of Prestwick, killing all 20 passengers and crew and five people on the ground.

== Transport ==
===Air travel===
Glasgow Prestwick Airport, formerly Prestwick International Airport, opened in the 1930s. The airport was a transatlantic gateway for over half a century. It lies close to, and was the last European re-fuelling way-point on, the Great Circle route from London via Thule in Greenland to San Francisco in the US; it is now no longer relevant for modern aircraft with non-stop range. 

During World War II the US Army Air Corps had a base at the airport, and Elvis Presley set foot in the UK for the only time there on 3 March 1960, when his US Army transport aircraft stopped for refuelling en route from Germany. 

Though a period of decline in the 1980s and 1990s saw it lose its status as Scotland&#x27;s primary transatlantic airport, Prestwick continues to handle US military flights. In July 2005, the airport was the main transport hub for world leaders attending the G8 conference in Gleneagles. The airport now caters to one low-cost airline, Ryanair. In addition, BAE Systems, Goodrich Corporation, Spirit AeroSystems and GE Aircraft Engines have maintenance/manufacturing facilities adjacent to the airfield.

====Navy station and NATS====

Prestwick has a Royal Navy Air Station, also known as HMS Gannet, where Sea King search and rescue helicopters were stationed until the role was civilianised in January 2016. 

Prestwick is a major air traffic control centre, with both the Scottish Air Traffic Control Centre (controlling 70% of UK airspace) and Prestwick Oceanic Area Control Centre (Shanwick Oceanic Control - responsible for air traffic over the eastern half of the North Atlantic) located at the NATS owned &#x27;Scottish and Oceanic Area Control Centre&#x27;.

===Bus and road===

Prestwick is on the Ayrshire Coast Line between Glasgow Central and Ayr. Three trains per hour call at both and , with additional services at peak times. Glasgow is approximately 50 minutes from Prestwick by rail. The line continues south to the port of Stranraer on the Wigtownshire coast, but a change of trains at Ayr is usually required. The bus routes that run through Prestwick are usually run by Stagecoach Western including an express service to and from Glasgow known as the &quot;X77&quot;.

The A79 road runs directly through the town, and is normally reached from the A77 trunk road between Glasgow and Stranraer, or from the A78 Ayrshire coastal route to Largs and Greenock.

== Landmarks ==
The remains of the old parish church are located near Prestwick railway station. Thought to have originally been built in the 12th century, the small church building is now a ruin, and is surrounded by an ancient graveyard. Prestwick has a esplanade alongside Prestwick Bay, part of the Firth of Clyde. It has two children&#x27;s playgrounds. At the north end Kid&#x27;zplay, an indoor activity centre, can be found next to the large play-area that was formerly a large open air swimming pool. Parallel to the esplanade is a line of large houses overlooking Arran.

The Prestwick Old Course hosted the first Open Golf Championship in 1860. The first twelve Open Championships were played there, from 1860 to 1872. (the Championship was not played in 1871). The town also hosts two other golf courses, St. Nicholas and St. Cuthberts. St. Nicholas is a traditional links course south of the town. Prestwick St Ninians Golf Club was founded in 1912. The club continued until the 1950s.

The Shaw Monument stands on the high ground overlooking Prestwick Airport. On Ardayre Road in Prestwick is a Polish memorial. Its origins can be traced to a memorial erected by the Polish Air Force at Monkton. Discovered there in a dilapidated and vandalised condition, it was moved by Kyle and Carrick District Council in 1986 to its present site in the gardens of the RAFA Club which overlooks the sea. The memorial was repaired and placed on a new plinth. On 2 May 1987 the memorial was unveiled with a commemorative plaque by the Polish Naval, Air Force and Ex-Combattants&#x27; Associations. On the 45th anniversary of the sinking of the ORP Orkan (G90), 8 October 1988, another commemorative plaque was installed in memory of the Polish Navy, Merchant Navy and Coastal Command airmen who died in the Battle of the Atlantic. On Polish Navy Day (10 February) at the memorial, in a service that both Polish and Scottish ex-servicemen participate in, the memories of those that perished are remembered in a spirit of friendship and comradeship between Polish and Scottish ex-servicemen.

The Oval is a public park in the centre of Prestwick with two full size football pitches with indoor changing rooms, a tennis centre with three indoor courts and eight outdoor, a 25m indoor swimming pool and gym, indoor bowling green and cricket club. The park was gifted to the town in 1954.

<text>A TV format is the overall concept and branding of a copyrighted television show. The most common type of formats are those in the television genres of game shows and reality shows, though other genres (e.g., sitcoms) are also adapted. TV formats may be viewed as a form of intellectual property (IP), and are regularly bought and sold, though TV formats are not generally protected under copyright law.

== Description ==
A TV format is the overall concept and branding of a copyrighted television show. A format is licensed by TV networks, so that they may produce a version of the show tailored to their nationality and audience. Formats are a major part of the international television market. Format purchasing is popular with broadcasters, due principally to the lower risk associated with an already-proven idea and the preference of audiences to watch programming tailored to their locality.

=== Examples ===
The most common type of formats are those in the television genres of game shows and reality shows, many of which are remade in multiple markets with local contestants. Examples include &quot;Survivor&quot;, &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, &quot;Pop Idol&quot; and &quot;Big Brother&quot; that have all proven successful worldwide. Such types of formats are also known as franchises, since rights to the format are usually handled with licenses.

Particular models in the genre of sitcoms are often sold as formats, enabling broadcasters to adapt them to the perceived tastes of their own audience. An example is &quot;The Office&quot;, a BBC sitcom which got adapted as &quot;The Office&quot; in the United States, in Sweden, &quot;HaMisrad&quot; in Israel&quot;,&quot; &quot;Le Bureau&quot; in France, &quot;The Office&quot; in India&quot;, Stromberg&quot; in Germany, &quot;La Job&quot; in Quebec, Canada and &quot;La Ofis&quot; in Chile.

== Companies ==
Leading companies that handle the creation and sales of programming formats include Warner Bros. International Television Production, ITV Studios, Talpa, Endemol Shine and Fremantle.

== Legal issues ==
TV formats are viewed as a form of intellectual property (IP), and are regularly bought and sold by TV producers, distribution company and broadcasters. For example, &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; has been recreated in 108 territories, while local versions of &quot;Idol&quot; have aired (over 129 series) in 42 territories receiving about three billion votes, most notable being &quot;American Idol&quot;.

However, TV formats are not generally protected under copyright law. As a result, copycat formats are sometimes created, which seek to duplicate the success of an original format without paying the person who came up with it. Format developers seek to prevent this by various means, including the use of trademarks or withholding distribution of other shows. Establishing &quot;Proof of Review&quot; and exposure to companies reviewing new TV formats is one important aspect of protection by the industry at the Television Writers Vault. The Format Recognition and Protection Association (FRAPA) aims to protect rights to formats and lobbies for legal protection.

<text>Christian Heinrich Friedrich Peters (September 19, 1813 – July 18, 1890) was a German–American astronomer and professor at Hamilton College, New York, and a pioneer in the study and visual discovery of asteroids. His name is often given as .

== Biography ==

He was born in Koldenbüttel in Schleswig, then part of Denmark, but which was later annexed to Germany. His younger brother was the German explorer Wilhelm Peters. He received a Ph.D from the University of Berlin in 1836 and thereafter continued his studies in Göttingen with the renowned mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss. From 1838 to 1843 he was engaged in surveys of Mount Etna, in Sicily, where he also made astronomical observations, and afterwards participated in the complete geodetic survey of the island.

During the Revolutions of 1848, Peters became involved with some of the radical, antimonarchical groups in Sicily that brought him to the attention of authorities. He subsequently fled to France and eventually to the Ottoman Empire, where he became a government advisor. At the suggestion of the resident U.S. consul in Istanbul, George P. Marsh, he emigrated to the United States in 1854. After an appointment as director of the new Dudley Observatory in Albany fell through, he made his way to Clinton, New York, where he was made director of the Litchfield Observatory at Hamilton College in 1858, and professor of astronomy in 1867. He was the first member of the Hamilton faculty to hold a Ph.D degree.

In 1874, Peters headed a United States Naval Observatory expedition to Queenstown, New Zealand, to observe the Transit of Venus. The visit is marked with a plaque, campaigned for by Sarah Salmond.

In 1878, Peters was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

Working at Hamilton College&#x27;s Litchfield Observatory in Clinton, New York (near Utica), he was a prolific discoverer of asteroids, discovering 48 of them, beginning with 72 Feronia in 1861 and ending with 287 Nephthys in 1889. Besides asteroids, he co-discovered the periodic comet 80P/Peters–Hartley, and also discovered various nebulae and galaxies.

== Star Catalog Controversy ==
Beginning in 1889, Peters was involved in litigation with his former student and assistant Charles A. Borst, in what became known as the &quot;Great Star-Catalog Case&quot;. While working for Peters as assistant director of the Litchfield Observatory, Borst had spent his spare time gathering an extensive amount of data for a new and revised star chart based on preliminary work done by Peters. When it came time to publish the results, however, Peters attempted to claim the entire project as his own, arguing that Borst was merely an employee and not a formal collaborator and that the research was his property as head of the observatory. Peters sued to force Borst to turn over the observational data he had collected. The judge found for Peters, but many astronomers and newspapers sided with Borst and Peters died not long after. The initial judgment was ultimately reversed on appeal and a new trial was ordered, but it never took place. The eminent astronomer Simon Newcomb devotes a chapter in his memoirs to Peters, as an object lesson in how great scientific talent and poor ethical standards may coexist in a single individual.

He died July 18, 1890, in Utica. Historian William Sheehan notes, &quot;Peters was found lying, a half-burned cigar at his fingertips, on the doorstep of the building where he lodged; observing cap on his head, he had fallen in the line of duty, on the way to the observatory the night before.&quot;

== Honors ==

Main-belt asteroid 100007 Peters, discovered by Eric Walter Elst at La Silla Observatory in 1988, was named in his memory, based on a suggestion by French amateur astronomer Michel-Alain Combes (born 1942). The asteroid measures approximately 7.5 kilometers in diameter and belongs to the carbonaceous Alauda family. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 5 January 2015 ().

== List of discovered minor planets ==

Between 1861 and 1889, C. H. F. Peters discovered 48 asteroids at Litchfield Observatory at Hamilton College, New York, where he enjoyed the title &quot;Litchfield professor of astronomy&quot;.

<text>The department of plant and microbial biology is an academic department in the Rausser College of Natural Resources at the University of California, Berkeley. The department conducts extensive research, provides undergraduate and graduate programs, and educates students in the fields of plant and microbial sciences with 43 department faculty members.

The plant biology program focuses on contemporary basic plant research and design of biotechnologies. New discoveries have broadened the understanding of plant development and function, and provided tools for engineering plants that produce novel new crops, with better resistance to disease and insects. With an increasing awareness of environmental problems, global changes, and emerging food needs, plants have emerged as a focal point for new research initiatives and educational training programs.

The department established the division of microbial biology to understand the microbial world to comprehend the global ecosystem, evolutionary history, and diversity of life on earth. The twenty-first century brings a new understanding of the workings of the global ecosystem and a wealth of new technologies derived from the microbial world.

The department also offers an extensive public education program as part of the California Cooperative Extension Service.

As the key research and training program of the Agricultural Experiment Station in the California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, this division operates at a strategic location near California’s major agricultural production centers and within the San Francisco Bay Area, a hub for innovative biotechnology.

Plant biology&#x27;s partnership with the United States Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Plant Gene Expression Center offers a model for successful collaborations between the University and other government agencies.

Research is largely funded through grants from the National Institute of Health, USDA and National Science Foundation. Extensive research is conducted Koshland Hall on the UC Berkeley campus and the nearby Energy Biosciences Institute, which is directed by a PMB faculty member.

The department also utilizes the fields and greenhouses of the nearby Oxford Tract for research.

Students in the undergraduate division graduate with a Bachelor of Science. The Graduate division offers Ph.D. degrees and opportunities for students to participate in postdoctoral research.

The department headquarters along with many faculty offices and laboratories are located in Koshland Hall. The Biological Imaging Facility, in Koshland Hall provides instructional and research support for modern biological light microscopy including laser scanning, confocal and deconvolution microscopy, computer image processing and analysis, FISH, and immunolocalization. The Genetics and Plant Biology building, situated on the northwest side of the campus, was built in 1999. It is the main teaching site for lectures and laboratory courses offered by the plant and microbial biology department.

Research strengths in the plant and microbial biology department are in the areas of plant and microbial genetics, biochemistry, ecology, evolution, pathology, development, physiology, cell biology and molecular biology. The department grants undergraduate degrees in: microbial biology, genetics and plant biology. Graduate degrees are offered in microbiology and plant biology. Many faculty in the department conduct research on plant-microbe interactions. The faculty and graduate students also cooperate with faculty from other UC Berkeley departments, such as the molecular and cell biology department, on researches pertaining to plant genetics and microbial biology.

<doc id="583758" wikidata="Q646806" url="?curid=583758" title="Cannonball Run II">
<text>Cannonball Run II is a 1983 American action comedy film starring Burt Reynolds and an all-star cast, released by Warner Bros. and Golden Harvest. The film is the second installment of the &quot;Cannonball Run&quot; trilogy and a sequel to &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; (1981). Like the first film, it is set around an illegal cross-country race.

This marked the final feature film appearances of Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra. Their appearances, coupled with those of Sammy Davis Jr. marked the final on-screen appearance of the Rat Pack team. The film also marked the final film appearance of Jim Nabors before his death in November 2017. The film also featured Jackie Chan in his third Hollywood role.

==Plot==
Having lost the first Cannonball Run race, Sheik Abdul ben Falafel is ordered by his father, the King, to go back to America and win another Cannonball Run in order to &quot;emblazon the Falafel name as the fastest in the world&quot;. When Sheik Abdul points out that there is no Cannonball Run that year, his father simply tells him to &quot;buy one&quot;.

To make sure his &quot;Royal Ulcer&quot; does not prevent him from winning, the Sheik hires Doctor Nikolas Van Helsing, who teamed with J.J. McClure and Victor Prinzi in the first race as his in-car physician. Most of the participants from the first race are lured back, including J.J. and Victor, who have taken jobs working with a flying stunt crew.

Meanwhile, Blake and Fenderbaum are in financial trouble with Don Don Canneloni, who in turn is in similar financial trouble with mob enforcer Hymie Kaplan. After the Sheik manages to bail out Blake and Fenderbaum by handing one of Don Don&#x27;s thugs a stack of cash, Don Don hatches a plot to kidnap the Sheik in an attempt to extort money from him.

The race begins with J.J. and Victor dressed as a US Army general and his driver, a private. They catch the attention of Betty and Veronica, who are dressed as nuns for a musical, but remain in character and hitch a ride with J.J. and Victor when they think the guys could become overnight millionaires. They do not lose their habits until later.

Other racers include Mitsubishi engineer Jackie Chan, teamed with Arnold, a giant, behind the wheel in a car—a Mitsubishi Starion—able to go under water. In a red Lamborghini (white at first) with &quot;two great-looking chicks in it&quot; (as the cops chasing them continually say) is the duo of Jill Rivers and Marcie Thatcher. Another team in a Cadillac Fleetwood is accompanied by an orangutan who has a penchant for destructive behavior, giving elderly ladies the middle finger and kissing people. The orangutan sits at the front of the car holding a mock steering wheel and dressed as a chauffeur. They are pulled over at one point by two California Highway Patrol officers who assume they are with the &quot;Candid Camera&quot; show, but when the officers try putting on a performance, the orangutan beats them up instead.

J.J. and Victor stop along the way to help a stranded soldier, Homer Lyle. They also get much better acquainted with their passengers, Betty and Veronica, who change into something a little more comfortable.

Don Don&#x27;s enforcers continue to blunder along the way, with disastrous results.

After Don Don&#x27;s gang capture the Sheik, the racers band together to invade Don Don&#x27;s &quot;Pinto Ranch&quot;. J.J., Victor, and Fenderbaum infiltrate it in drag, dressed as belly dancers. Others barrel in by car and rescue the Sheik, who is reluctant to leave, since he has his pick of women there. The three &quot;dancers&quot; and Blake go to their Leader, Frank Sinatra, to seek help, only to have him jump into the race himself.

In the end, the Sheik bankrolls Don Don&#x27;s Ranch and then declares that he is upping the stakes to $2 million for the winner. All jump into their automobiles and make a dash for the finish line, avoiding traffic patrollers on the way.

The Sheik, as it turns out, loses yet again, this time blaming the doctor who rode with him for injecting him with an unknown substance. He convinces his father that he will win the return-trip race, having hired the winner of this one. It turns out to be the orangutan, who kisses the startled King on the lips.

==Production==
Jaclyn Smith was originally meant to be the female lead but dropped out. Needham said that Smith was worried about his improvisational style: &quot;I think she was scared to death to be up there against Burt and Dom. I don&#x27;t want someone on the set that&#x27;s gonna be that scared. So we went somewhere else&quot;. She was replaced by Shirley Maclaine.

Frank Sinatra agreed to do a cameo at the suggestion of Davis and Martin. Needham wrote three versions of the script for him, ones where he would either work a week, two days, or a day. He picked the latter. He was paid $30,000 which he donated to charity. It was the first film he had made in three years and the first time he had reunited with Rat Pack members professionally or personally in three years. Needham says he turned up half an hour early and did his scene with minimal fuss.

Part of the film was shot near Tucson, Arizona. To show the momentum of the race, the producers commissioned Ralph Bakshi to animate a cartoon sequence for the finale.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened in Japan on December 17, 1983 and grossed $846,676 from 22 theatres in five cities in its first two days. It went on to be the second-highest-grossing foreign film of 1984 (along with Jackie Chan&#x27;s &quot;Project A&quot; at number three), grossing .

In the United States and Canada, after the tenth-highest 1984 opening weekend of , &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; slowed down, becoming the 32nd-most popular 1984 film at the American and Canada box office with a total lifetime gross of , less than half that of the first&quot; Cannonball Run&quot;. According to one review of the film, &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; still turned a healthy profit, and the reviewer attributed the film&#x27;s financial success to preselling.

The film enjoyed more success overseas. In West Germany (where it was the year&#x27;s seventh highest-grossing film) and France, the film drew 3,748,167 box-office admissions. The film had a total worldwide gross of .

===Critical reception===
&quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; met with even harsher reviews than had its predecessor, with a 12% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 17 critics. Roger Ebert awarded the film one half star out of four, calling it &quot;one of the laziest insults to the intelligence of moviegoers that I can remember. Sheer arrogance made this picture&quot;. Ebert&#x27;s &quot;At the Movies&quot; cohost Gene Siskel was even harsher, awarding it zero stars out of four, referring to it as &quot;worthless&quot; and referring to it as &quot;a total ripoff, a deceptive film that gives movies a bad name&quot; in his &quot;At the Movies&quot; review. Siskel named it his least-favorite film that he had seen during his time doing &quot;At the Movies&quot; with Ebert- sometimes citing it as the worst movie ever made. He went further in his print review, writing: 

Both critics expressed bewilderment by Burt Reynolds&#x27; career choices, declaring that he was wasting his considerable talent and noting that Reynolds&#x27; huge fan base did not like the film (nor the recent &quot;Stroker Ace&quot;) and would stop going to see his movies if he continued to make such terrible films. Rob Salem of &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; expressed similar sentiments in his review.

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;if you bother to submit yourself to &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; and happen to go the distance, be sure to stay for the end credits, the funniest part of the picture by far. As they unroll on the left of the screen, we&#x27;re treated to a series of bloopers showing the stars breaking each other up during shooting, blowing one take after another. Ah. if only this antic humor had been allowed to burst through earlier. From the start it was clear enough that the cast was having a ball, but for the most part the material is so puerile that the film is that familiar instance of the actors having more fun than we are.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;an endless string of cameo performances from a cast whose funny participants are badly outnumbered and whose television roots are unmistakable.&quot; Kathleen Carroll of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; gave the film only a single star out of a possible four, writing: Rick Lyman of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; wrote that &quot;if &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; is more amusing than &quot;Stroker Ace&quot;—and it is—it&#x27;s only because you can appreciate its vulgarity in a state of open-mouthed, morbid fascination.&quot;

The film received negative reviews in Tucson, where it was largely filmed. Robert S. Cauthorn of &quot;The Arizona Daily Star&quot; said it &quot;accomplishes the difficult feat of being more obnoxious and mindless than the first; It&#x27;s as much fun as going to your mechanic for a tuneup and being told that you need an engine overhaul.&quot; John Lankford of the &quot;Tucson Citizen&quot; praised the location shooting, but remarked that &quot;whatever tiny spark of life that made the first &#x27;Cannonball&#x27; work at all is missing in action here. The story is lame, there is no direction, the editing is sloppy . . . I could go on and on with this as you can well imagine. But this horse is already down and out; my puny efforts to finish it off would seem cruel.&quot;

The film received eight Golden Raspberry Award nominations at the 1984 Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture, Worst Actor and Worst Actress.

<text>Rogue Trader: How I Brought Down Barings Bank and Shook the Financial World is a book by Nick Leeson, who served four years in prison for fraud after bankrupting the London-based Barings Bank in 1995 by hiding $1.4 billion in debt he accumulated as a derivatives trader in Singapore. The book was released on February 19, 1996 by Little, Brown &amp; Company.

==Film==
The book was made into a 1999 feature film of the same name. Following an interview with Nick Leeson in prison, Sir David Frost realised the potential for a movie and optioned the rights to Leeson&#x27;s story.

Written and directed by James Dearden, the film stars Ewan McGregor (Nick Leeson) and Anna Friel (Lisa Leeson) and was executive produced by Frost. Released in June 1999, it premiered in London one month prior to Leeson&#x27;s release from prison in Singapore. &quot;Rogue Trader&quot; was released on June 25, 1999 in the UK and the US. It was distributed by Pathé in the UK and Cinemax in the US.

<text>Maximilian Franz Joseph Cornelius Wolf (21 June 1863 – 3 October 1932) was a German astronomer and a pioneer in the field of astrophotography. He was the chairman of astronomy at the University of Heidelberg and director of the Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory from 1902 until his death in 1932.

== Early life ==

Max Wolf was born in Heidelberg, Germany on 21 June 1863, the son of medical doctor Franz Wolf. His father encouraged an interest in science and built an observatory for his son in the garden of the family home. It is from here that Wolf was credited with his first astronomical discovery, comet 14P/Wolf, in 1884.

== Life at the university ==

Wolf attended his local university and, in 1888, at the age of 25, was awarded a Ph.D. by the University of Heidelberg. He spent one year of post-graduate study in Stockholm, the only significant time he would spend outside of Heidelberg in his life. He returned to the University of Heidelberg and accepted the position of &quot;privat-docent&quot; in 1890. A popular lecturer in astronomy, he declined offers of positions from other institutions. In 1902 he was appointed Chair of Astronomy and Director of the new Landessternwarte Heidelberg-Königstuhl observatory, positions he would hold until his death in 1932.

While the new observatory was being built Wolf was appointed to supervise the construction and outfitting of the astrophysics half of the observatory. He proved to be not only a capable supervisor but also a successful fundraiser. When sent to America to study the construction of the large new telescopes being built there he returned not only with telescope plans but also with a grant of $10,000 from the American philanthropist Catherine Wolfe Bruce. Wolf immediately designed and ordered a double refractor telescope from American astronomer and instrument builder John Brashear. This instrument, known as the &quot;Bruce double-astrograph&quot;, with parallel lenses and a fast f/5 focal ratio, became the observatory&#x27;s primary research telescope. Wolf also raised money for a reflector telescope, the first for the observatory, used for spectroscopy.

In 1910 Wolf proposed to the Carl Zeiss optics firm the creation of a new instrument which would become known as the planetarium. World War I intervened before the invention could be developed, but the Carl Zeiss company resumed this project after peace was restored. The first official public showing was at the Deutsches Museum in Munich, Germany on 21 October 1923.

During his trip to America Wolf was interested in learning more about the relatively new field of astrophotography. He met the American astronomer and astrophotographer E.E. Barnard, and the two became lifelong correspondents, competitors, collaborators and friends. Wolf wrote a long obituary for Barnard upon his death in 1923.

== Later life and death ==

Heidelberg University became well known for astronomy under Wolf&#x27;s leadership. Wolf himself was an active researcher, contributing numerous papers in many areas of astronomy up to the end of his life. He died in Heidelberg on 3 October 1932, at the age of 69. He was survived by his widow and three sons.

== Comets and novae ==

Wolf started his career as a comet hunter and continued to discover them throughout his life. He discovered or co-discovered several comets, including 14P/Wolf and 43P/Wolf-Harrington. Wolf won a competition with E. E. Barnard on who would be the first to observe the return of Halley&#x27;s Comet (P1/Halley) in April 1910.

He discovered Nova Aquilae 1927, a classical nova.

He discovered or co-discovered four supernovae: SN 1895A (a.k.a. VW Vir), SN 1909A (a.k.a. SS UMa), SN 1920A, and, with Reinmuth, SN 1926A.

== Dark nebulae ==

One of the many significant contributions Wolf made was in the determination of the nature of &quot;dark nebulae&quot;. These areas of the sky, thought since William Herschel&#x27;s time to be &quot;holes in the sky&quot;, were a puzzle to astronomers of the time. In collaboration with E. E. Barnard, Wolf proved, by careful photographic analysis, that &quot;dark nebulae&quot; were huge clouds of fine opaque dust.

== Star catalog ==

Along with E. E. Barnard, Wolf applied astrophotography to the observation of stars. The &quot;Bruce double-astrograph&quot; was originally designed to hunt dim asteroids but it was found to be ideally suited for the study of the proper motion of low-luminosity stars using much the same technique. In 1919 Wolf published a catalog of the locations of over one thousand stars along with their measured proper motion. These stars are still commonly identified by his name and catalog number. Among the stars he discovered is &quot;Wolf 359&quot;, a dim red dwarf that was later found to be one of the nearest stars to the Solar System. He continued to add proper motion star discoveries to this catalog throughout his life, with the catalog eventually totaling over 1500 stars, many more than all of his competitors combined. These stars are significant because stars with low luminosity and high proper motion, such as Barnard&#x27;s Star and Wolf 359, are usually relatively close to the Earth and thus the stars in Wolf&#x27;s catalog remain popular subjects for astronomical research. The methods used by E. E. Barnard and Wolf were continued by Frank Elmore Ross and George Van Biesbroeck through the mid-20th century. Since that time photographic plates have been gradually replaced with more sensitive electronic photodetectors for astronomical surveys.

== Asteroids ==
In 1891, Wolf discovered his first asteroid, 323 Brucia, and named it after Catherine Wolfe Bruce. He pioneered the use of astrophotographic techniques to automate the discovery of asteroids, as opposed to older visual methods, as a result of which asteroid discovery rates sharply increased. In time-exposure photographs, asteroids appear as short streaks due to their planetary motion with respect to fixed stars. Wolf discovered 248 asteroids in his lifetime.

Among his many discoveries was 588 Achilles (the first Trojan asteroid) in 1906, as well as two other Trojans: 659 Nestor and 884 Priamus. He also discovered 887 Alinda in 1918, which is now recognized as an Earth-crossing Amor asteroid (or sometimes classified as the namesake of its own Alinda family). Wolf&#x27;s then-record number of discoveries was surpassed by his pupil Karl Wilhelm Reinmuth on 24 July 1933.

The lunar crater Wolf as well as the main-belt asteroids 827 Wolfiana and 1217 Maximiliana were named in his honor.

Minor planet 1152 Pawona is named after both Johann Palisa and Max Wolf, in recognition of their cooperation. The name was proposed by Swedish astronomer Bror Ansgar Asplind. &quot;Pawona&quot; is a combination of &quot;Palisa&quot; and &quot;Wolf&quot; (Pa, Wo) joined with a Latin feminine suffix.

== Other astronomers named &quot;Wolf&quot; ==
* Marek Wolf, a Czech astronomer who is also a discoverer of minor planets. He is credited as &quot;M. Wolf&quot; by the Minor Planet Center, while the discoveries by Max Wolf are credited with &quot;M. F. Wolf&quot;.
* Charles Wolf, a French astronomer and co-discoverer of the Wolf-Rayet stars.
* German astronomers Christian Wolf and Ulrich Wolff (amateur from Berlin), as well as American astronomer Chris Wolfe have also discovered minor planets.

<text>Masovians, also spelled as Mazovians, and historically known as Masurians, is an ethnographic group of Polish people that originates from the region of Masovia, located mostly within borders of the Masovian Voivodeship, Poland. They speak the Masovian dialect of Polish.

The group originates from the Lechitic tribe of Masovians, first referenced in the historical records by Nestor the Chronicler in the 11th century.

In the Polish census of 2021, 97 people declared Mazovian national identity.

== Name ==
The name Masovian, in Polish, &quot;Mazowszanin&quot;, comes from the name of the region of Masovia, in Polish known as &quot;Mazowsze&quot;. The name of the region, comes from its Old Polish names &quot;Mazow&quot;, and &quot;Mazosze&quot;, and most likely came from word &quot;maz&quot; (ancestor word of modern &quot;maź&quot; and &quot;mazać&quot;), which was used to either describe a &quot;&quot;muddy region&quot; or a &quot;person covered in mud&quot;&quot;.

Historically, prior to the World War II, the population was known as &quot;Masurians&quot; (Polish: &quot;Mazurzy&quot;). Currently, the name is exclusively associated with Masurians (historically known as &quot;Prussian Masurians&quot;), another ethnic group related to Masovians, who inhabit nearby region of Masuria, while the population of Masovia is exclusively referred to as &quot;Masovians&quot;.

== History ==
The group originate from the Lechitic tribe of Masovians, first referenced in the historical records by Nestor the Chronicler in the 11th century. The tribe inhabited an area in modern region of Masovia, centered on the Vistula river. They were originally of the Slavic paganism faith, prior to the christianization of Poland, begun in 10th century. The main settlements of the tribes were Ciechanów, Czersk, Łomża, Płock, Płońsk, and Wizna.

<text>George Mary Searle (June 27, 1839 – July 7, 1918) was an American astronomer and Catholic priest.

==Biography==

He discovered the asteroid 55 Pandora in 1858. He also discovered six galaxies. In later life, he became a member of the Paulist order and taught at The Catholic University of America.

In 1905, Searle published his idea for a possible reform of the Gregorian Calendar. The plan was to have every new year beginning on Sunday, in order to achieve a perennial calendar. In common years, the new calendar would have 52 weeks exactly, or 364 days, with February shortened to 27 days. In leap years, there would be 53 weeks, or 371 days. The extra week would be added as a holiday week, between April and May. Leap years would occur every fifth year, except for years divisible by 50, and except for one other 5th year in 400. The result would be a calendar with 20,871 weeks in 400 years, equal to the Gregorian Calendar.

In 1916, he wrote a book denouncing the Christian Science of Mary Baker Eddy.

<doc id="583785" wikidata="Q574902" url="?curid=583785" title="Tarski's undefinability theorem">
<text>Tarski&#x27;s undefinability theorem, stated and proved by Alfred Tarski in 1933, is an important limitative result in mathematical logic, the foundations of mathematics, and in formal semantics. Informally, the theorem states that &quot;arithmetical truth cannot be defined in arithmetic&quot;.

The theorem applies more generally to any sufficiently strong formal system, showing that truth in the standard model of the system cannot be defined within the system.

==History==
In 1931, Kurt Gödel published the incompleteness theorems, which he proved in part by showing how to represent the syntax of formal logic within first-order arithmetic. Each expression of the formal language of arithmetic is assigned a distinct number. This procedure is known variously as Gödel numbering, &quot;coding&quot; and, more generally, as arithmetization. In particular, various &quot;sets&quot; of expressions are coded as sets of numbers. For various syntactic properties (such as &quot;being a formula&quot;, &quot;being a sentence&quot;, etc.), these sets are computable. Moreover, any computable set of numbers can be defined by some arithmetical formula. For example, there are formulas in the language of arithmetic defining the set of codes for arithmetic sentences, and for provable arithmetic sentences.

The undefinability theorem shows that this encoding cannot be done for semantic concepts such as truth. It shows that no sufficiently rich interpreted language can represent its own semantics. A corollary is that any metalanguage capable of expressing the semantics of some object language (e.g. a predicate is definable in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory for whether formulae in the language of Peano arithmetic are true in the standard model of arithmetic) must have expressive power exceeding that of the object language. The metalanguage includes primitive notions, axioms, and rules absent from the object language, so that there are theorems provable in the metalanguage not provable in the object language.

The undefinability theorem is conventionally attributed to Alfred Tarski. Gödel also discovered the undefinability theorem in 1930, while proving his incompleteness theorems published in 1931, and well before the 1933 publication of Tarski&#x27;s work (Murawski 1998). While Gödel never published anything bearing on his independent discovery of undefinability, he did describe it in a 1931 letter to John von Neumann. Tarski had obtained almost all results of his 1933 monograph &quot;The Concept of Truth in the Languages of the Deductive Sciences&quot; between 1929 and 1931, and spoke about them to Polish audiences. However, as he emphasized in the paper, the undefinability theorem was the only result he did not obtain earlier. According to the footnote to the undefinability theorem (Twierdzenie I) of the 1933 monograph, the theorem and the sketch of the proof were added to the monograph only after the manuscript had been sent to the printer in 1931. Tarski reports there that, when he presented the content of his monograph to the Warsaw Academy of Science on March 21, 1931, he expressed at this place only some conjectures, based partly on his own investigations and partly on Gödel&#x27;s short report on the incompleteness theorems &quot;&quot; [Some metamathematical results on the definiteness of decision and consistency], Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, 1930.

==Statement==
We will first state a simplified version of Tarski&#x27;s theorem, then state and prove in the next section the theorem Tarski proved in 1933.

Let formula_1 be the language of first-order arithmetic. This is the theory of the natural numbers, including their addition and multiplication, axiomatized by the first-order Peano axioms. This is a &quot;first-order&quot; theory: the quantifiers extend over natural numbers, but not over sets or functions of natural numbers. The theory is strong enough to describe recursively defined integer functions such as exponentiation, factorials or the Fibonacci sequence.

Let formula_2 be the standard structure for formula_3 i.e. formula_2 consists of the ordinary set of natural numbers and their addition and multiplication. Each sentence in formula_1 can be interpreted in formula_2 and then becomes either true or false. Thus formula_7 is the &quot;interpreted first-order language of arithmetic&quot;.

Each formula formula_8 in formula_1 has a Gödel number formula_10 This is a natural number that &quot;encodes&quot; formula_11 In that way, the language formula_1 can talk about formulas in formula_3 not just about numbers. Let formula_14 denote the set of formula_1-sentences true in formula_2, and formula_17 the set of Gödel numbers of the sentences in formula_18 The following theorem answers the question: Can formula_17 be defined by a formula of first-order arithmetic?

&quot;Tarski&#x27;s undefinability theorem&quot;: There is no formula_1-formula formula_21 that defines formula_22
That is, there is no formula_1-formula formula_21 such that for every formula_1-sentence formula_26 formula_27 holds in formula_2.

Informally, the theorem says that the concept of truth of first-order arithmetic statements cannot be defined by a formula in first-order arithmetic. This implies a major limitation on the scope of &quot;self-representation&quot;. It &quot;is&quot; possible to define a formula formula_21 whose extension is formula_30 but only by drawing on a metalanguage whose expressive power goes beyond that of formula_1. For example, a truth predicate for first-order arithmetic can be defined in second-order arithmetic. However, this formula would only be able to define a truth predicate for formulas in the original language formula_1. To define a truth predicate for the metalanguage would require a still higher metametalanguage, and so on.

To prove the theorem, we proceed by contradiction and assume that an formula_1-formula formula_21 exists which is true for the natural number formula_35 in formula_2 if and only if formula_35 is the Gödel number of a sentence in formula_1 that is true in formula_2. We could then use formula_21 to define a new formula_1-formula formula_42 which is true for the natural number formula_43 if and only if formula_43 is the Gödel number of a formula formula_45 (with a free variable formula_46) such that formula_47 is false when interpreted in formula_2 (i.e. the formula formula_49 when applied to its own Gödel number, yields a false statement). If we now consider the Gödel number formula_50 of the formula formula_42, and ask whether the sentence formula_52 is true in formula_2, we obtain a contradiction. (This is known as a diagonal argument.)

The theorem is a corollary of Post&#x27;s theorem about the arithmetical hierarchy, proved some years after Tarski (1933). A semantic proof of Tarski&#x27;s theorem from Post&#x27;s theorem is obtained by reductio ad absurdum as follows. Assuming formula_17 is arithmetically definable, there is a natural number formula_35 such that formula_17 is definable by a formula at level formula_57 of the arithmetical hierarchy. However, formula_17 is formula_59-hard for all formula_60 Thus the arithmetical hierarchy collapses at level formula_35, contradicting Post&#x27;s theorem.

==General form==
Tarski proved a stronger theorem than the one stated above, using an entirely syntactical method. The resulting theorem applies to any formal language with negation, and with sufficient capability for self-reference that the diagonal lemma holds. First-order arithmetic satisfies these preconditions, but the theorem applies to much more general formal systems, such as ZFC.

&quot;Tarski&#x27;s undefinability theorem (general form)&quot;: Let formula_7 be any interpreted formal language which includes negation and has a Gödel numbering formula_63 satisfying the diagonal lemma, i.e. for every formula_1-formula formula_65 (with one free variable formula_46) there is a sentence formula_67 such that formula_68 holds in formula_2. Then there is no formula_1-formula formula_21 with the following property: for every formula_1-sentence formula_26 formula_27 is true in formula_2.

The proof of Tarski&#x27;s undefinability theorem in this form is again by reductio ad absurdum. Suppose that an formula_1-formula formula_21 as above existed, i.e., if formula_67 is a sentence of arithmetic, then formula_79 holds in formula_2 if and only if formula_67 holds in formula_2. Hence for all formula_67, the formula formula_27 holds in formula_2. But the diagonal lemma yields a counterexample to this equivalence, by giving a &quot;liar&quot; formula formula_86 such that formula_87 holds in formula_2. This is a contradiction. QED.

==Discussion==
The formal machinery of the proof given above is wholly elementary except for the diagonalization which the diagonal lemma requires. The proof of the diagonal lemma is likewise surprisingly simple; for example, it does not invoke recursive functions in any way. The proof does assume that every formula_1-formula has a Gödel number, but the specifics of a coding method are not required. Hence Tarski&#x27;s theorem is much easier to motivate and prove than the more celebrated theorems of Gödel about the metamathematical properties of first-order arithmetic.

Smullyan (1991, 2001) has argued forcefully that Tarski&#x27;s undefinability theorem deserves much of the attention garnered by Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems. That the latter theorems have much to say about all of mathematics and more controversially, about a range of philosophical issues (e.g., Lucas 1961) is less than evident. Tarski&#x27;s theorem, on the other hand, is not directly about mathematics but about the inherent limitations of any formal language sufficiently expressive to be of real interest. Such languages are necessarily capable of enough self-reference for the diagonal lemma to apply to them. The broader philosophical import of Tarski&#x27;s theorem is more strikingly evident.

An interpreted language is &quot;strongly-semantically-self-representational&quot; exactly when the language contains predicates and function symbols defining all the semantic concepts specific to the language. Hence the required functions include the &quot;semantic valuation function&quot; mapping a formula formula_67 to its truth value formula_91 and the &quot;semantic denotation function&quot; mapping a term formula_92 to the object it denotes. Tarski&#x27;s theorem then generalizes as follows: &quot;No sufficiently powerful language is strongly-semantically-self-representational&quot;.

The undefinability theorem does not prevent truth in one theory from being defined in a stronger theory. For example, the set of (codes for) formulas of first-order Peano arithmetic that are true in formula_2 is definable by a formula in second order arithmetic. Similarly, the set of true formulas of the standard model of second order arithmetic (or formula_35-th order arithmetic for any formula_35) can be defined by a formula in first-order ZFC.

<text>Perrott&#x27;s Folly, , also known as The Monument, or The Observatory, is a 29-metre (96-foot) tall tower, built in 1758. It is a Grade II* listed building in the Edgbaston area of Birmingham, United Kingdom.

==History==
Built in the open Rotton Park by John Perrott in 1758, who lived in Belbroughton, the tower now stands high above the local residential and business housing.

There are many stories to explain why the tower was built: that John Perrott wanted to be able to survey his land and perhaps entertain guests; or to spot animals for hunting; or so that he could see his wife&#x27;s grave, away.

From 1884 to 1979 the tower was used as a weather recording station for the Birmingham and Midland Institute. In 1966 the Geography Department of the University of Birmingham took over the running of the observatory until operations were transferred to the main campus.

It has been suggested, but not proven, that the towers of Perrott&#x27;s Folly and Edgbaston Waterworks may have influenced references to towers in the writings of J. R. R. Tolkien, who lived nearby as a child.

==Prospects==
The Perrott&#x27;s Folly Company was formed in 1984 to renovate the tower and make it accessible to the public. The company obtained grants from English Heritage and Birmingham City Council to secure the building.

In the summer of 2005 the Perrott&#x27;s Folly Company, in partnership with Birmingham Conservation Trust, completed work to stabilise the structure. However, money still has to be found to complete repairs to some of the key features. In April 2008 the tower was temporarily opened to the public, housing an art exhibition in co-operation with the Ikon Gallery. It was opened again in May 2008 as part of a weekend of celebrations of the life of J. R. R. Tolkien. The Perrott&#x27;s Folly Company was formally closed in August 2009. The tower was managed by Trident Housing Association between 2005 and 2017 and is now managed by Re.Future Collective, a Birmingham based Arts and Architecture Collective.

<doc id="583793" wikidata="Q3037807" url="?curid=583793" title="Double switch (baseball)">
<text>In baseball, the double switch is a type of player substitution, usually performed by a team while playing defense. The double switch is typically used to make a pitching substitution, while simultaneously placing the incoming pitcher in a more favorable spot in the batting order than was occupied by the outgoing pitcher. (On the assumption that the pitcher will be a poor hitter, the incoming pitcher will generally take the spot in the batting order of a position player who has recently batted, so as to reduce the chance that the pitcher will make a plate appearance in the next few innings.) To perform a double switch (or any other substitution), the ball must be dead.

Beginning in 2022 the National League adopted the designated hitter. Pitchers no longer took a spot in the batting order, and that rendered the double switch virtually unneeded.

==Procedure==
Since the batting order can be changed only as a result of a player substitution, while the defensive arrangement may be changed freely (among players currently in the game), the double switch typically takes the following form:
#Player A (outgoing pitcher, batting soon) is replaced by Player B (a position player), taking Player A&#x27;s place in the batting order.
#Player C (outgoing position player, batting later than Player A) is replaced by Player D (a pitcher), taking Player C&#x27;s place in the batting order.
#Player D is pitching in place of Player A, and Player B is fielding in place of Player C.

In the short term, the lineup is strengthened because a poor-hitting pitcher will not make a plate appearance soon. The disadvantage is that a position player must be removed from play and replaced by another, often inferior, position player. The advantage of the double switch over pinch hitting is that it uses up fewer players. If a relief pitcher is brought in before the at-bat, then the manager can substitute a pinch-hitter for him. However, this would require a new pitcher for the next half-inning. By using a double switch, an incoming pitcher can be left in the game for a substantial period before his turn in the batting lineup arrives, no matter what the previous batting order was.

While the double switch played an important role in the National League, the designated hitter (DH) rule has effectively eliminated the advantages of the double switch. The designated hitter&#x27;s role is to bat in the pitcher&#x27;s spot in the lineup. Major League rules do not allow a multiple substitution involving a DH to alter the lineup position of the DH. Although uncommon, it is possible to forgo the DH privilege (e.g. if the DH becomes a position player, usually due to injury to another player), and then utilize the double switch later with that player. It can also be used by an AL team playing on the road during interleague play or the World Series, because MLB rules call for the rules of the home team to be used when teams from different leagues meet (so there is no DH when the NL team is the home team). As of the 2022 CBA, MLB has implemented a universal designated hitter, eliminating the need for the double-switch.

When the team is up to bat, a manager can get the same effect as a double switch by leaving in the player who has pinch-hit for the pitcher and replacing another player in the lineup who has made the last out of the inning with a new pitcher. This will take the following form:
#Player A (outgoing pitcher, batting next) is replaced by Player B (a position player) as a pinch-hitter, taking Player A&#x27;s place in the batting order.
#Player C makes the last out of the inning is replaced by Player D (a pitcher), taking Player C&#x27;s place in the batting order.
#Player D is pitching in place of Player A, and Player B is fielding in place of Player C.
A double switch has infrequently resulted in a team batting out of turn because the lineup card was not updated to reflect the change, either because the umpires were not informed of the change, or because the change was not recorded. In addition, because double-switches are typically communicated verbally, it creates opportunities for confusion and miscommunication that can be costly to the switching team.

<text>James Craig Watson (January 28, 1838 – November 23, 1880) was a Canadian-American astronomer, discoverer of comets and minor planets, director of the University of Michigan&#x27;s Detroit Observatory in Ann Arbor, and awarded with the Lalande Prize in 1869.

==Biography==
Watson was born in the village of Fingal, Ontario. His family relocated to Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1850. At age 15 he was matriculated at the University of Michigan, where he studied the classical languages. He graduated with a BA in 1857 and received a master&#x27;s degree on examination after two years&#x27; study in astronomy under professor Franz Brünnow. He became Professor of Physics and instructor in Mathematics, and in 1863, succeeded him as professor of Astronomy and director of the Detroit Observatory. He wrote the textbook &quot;Theoretical Astronomy&quot;, published in 1868 by J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. The textbook was a standard reference work for over thirty years.

He discovered 22 asteroids, beginning with 79 Eurynome in 1863. One of his asteroid discoveries, 139 Juewa was made in Beijing when Watson was there to observe the 1874 transit of Venus. The name Juewa was chosen by Chinese officials (瑞華, or in modern pinyin, &quot;ruìhuá&quot;). Another was 121 Hermione in 1872, from Ann Arbor, Michigan, and this asteroid was found to have a small asteroid moon in 2002.

He was a member of the most important expeditions for astronomical observation sent out by the United States Government during his time. The first was an expedition to observe the eclipse of the Sun at Mount Pleasant, Iowa, in 1869; the second of a similar expedition to Sicily, in 1870; the third to Beijing, China, to observe the transit of Venus in 1874; the fourth to Wyoming, to observe the total eclipse of the sun in 1878. He was a strong believer in the existence of the planet Vulcan, a hypothetical planet closer to the Sun than Mercury, which is now known not to exist (however the existence of small Vulcanoid planetoids remains a possibility). He believed he had seen such two such planets during his observation of the 1878 solar eclipse.

In 1879, after attempts by the university to retain him, Watson resigned his professorship at Ann Arbor to accept a position the University of Wisconsin, where he hoped to find superior apparatus and instruments for the difficult observations which he had planned. Seeking to silence critics who doubted his claims to have discovered Vulcan, he also personally paid to construct an underground observatory, in a misguided attempt to observe planets in the daytime. This was based on the idea that stars could be seen during the day from the bottom of a well, which is an ancient myth but verifiably incorrect. (It is not merely direct glare from the Sun that hides the stars, but scattered light from the atmosphere above the well.)

Watson died of peritonitis at the age of 42 and was buried at Forest Hill, Ann Arbor. He had amassed a considerable fortune through non-astronomical business activities and, by bequest, established the James Craig Watson Medal, awarded every two years by the National Academy of Sciences for contributions to astronomy. His successor, Edward Holden, completed Watson&#x27;s underground observatory, but declared it useless after he found not even the brightest stars could be observed.

==Personality==
Watson often prioritized financial gain. This obsession, in the view of the University of Michigan&#x27;s first president, Henry Philip Tappan, led Watson to do nothing while serving as director of the Detroit Observatory during Brünnow&#x27;s brief absence from 1859 to 1860. Brünnow had gone to the Dudley Observatory as Associate Director in Albany, New York, but he was called back to direct the Detroit Observatory by the Regents. The return of Brünnow so infuriated Watson that Watson contacted local life insurance agencies in Ann Arbor and became a life insurance actuary, where he made some extra money. Watson also during his career helped reduce Washington Zones for the United States Office of Coast Survey solely for the money. In another action motivated by money, Watson built a house in Ann Arbor on South University Avenue for $5000 but still could not pay for it after gathering all his resources and borrowing $2000. He requested a mortgage soon after with the house as collateral, then he sold the house to someone in Saline in September 1862 and then convinced the Regents to build a Director’s Residence attached to Detroit Observatory. It is unclear how he had such massive debt despite his rather large salary at the time.

Watson was a very divisive person on the University of Michigan’s campus. He did not allow visitors or students in the Detroit Observatory, angering many students. He also only really cared about students interested in astronomy, but he was an interesting lecturer and easy grader, so a large number of students took his courses. His carelessness is reflected in the fact that he once gave passing grades to an entire class, including to a student who died two weeks into the term.

Watson also appeared to be rather vain. He would sign his notebooks as if practicing his autograph, including once signing his notebook, “James Craig Watson, Astronomer Royal,” a title only given to the most renowned astronomers of Britain. Watson also once wrote this about himself: 
In addition to this, Watson frequently committed plagiarism, including from Brünnow, and he received a variety of honorary degrees by asking for them rather than being honored with them (e.g. Doctor from University of Leipzig, Doctor of Law from Columbia College, etc.). Oddly, Watson was still well-liked for being cheerful and humorous. Watson also was a religious fundamentalist, believing that mathematicians could not be atheists.

==Honors and awards==
Watson won the Lalande Prize given by the French Academy of Sciences for 1869. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. He received the honorary degree of Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Leipzig in 1870, and from Yale College in 1871, and the degree of Doctor of Laws from Columbia in 1877.

The main-belt asteroid 729 Watsonia is named in his honour, as is the lunar crater &quot;Watson&quot;.

<doc id="583799" wikidata="Q1129811" url="?curid=583799" title="HMS Plymouth (F126)">
<text>HMS &quot;Plymouth&quot; was a Royal Navy . In 1982, &quot;Plymouth&quot; was one of the first Royal Navy ships to arrive in the South Atlantic during the Falklands War.

==Background==
&quot;Plymouth&quot; was one of 12 ships built in the new ; were built after the (Type 12s) in the mid 1950s. &quot;Plymouth&quot; was built at the Devonport Dockyard, in her namesake city and was laid down on 1 July 1958. She was launched by Viscountess Astor on 20 July 1959 and commissioned on 11 May 1961 with the pennant number F126.

==Design==
The &quot;Rothesay&quot; class was an improved version of the &quot;Whitby&quot;-class anti-submarine frigate, with nine &quot;Rothesay&quot;s ordered in the 1954–55 shipbuilding programme for the Royal Navy to supplement the six &quot;Whitby&quot;s.

&quot;Plymouth&quot; was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . The &quot;Rothesay&quot;s were powered by the same Y-100 machinery used by the &quot;Whitby&quot;-class. Two Babcock &amp; Wilcox water-tube boilers fed steam at and to two sets of geared steam turbines which drove two propeller shafts, fitted with large ( diameter) propellers. The machinery was rated at , giving a speed of . Crew was about 212 officers and men.

A twin 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mark 6 gun mount was fitted forward, with 350 rounds of ammunition carried. It was originally intended to fit a twin 40 mm L/70 Bofors anti-aircraft mount aft, but in 1957 it was decided to fit the Seacat anti-aircraft missile instead. Seacat was not yet ready, and &quot;Plymouth&quot; was completed with a single L/60 40 mm Bofors mount aft as a temporary anti-aircraft armament. The design anti-submarine armament consisted of twelve 21-inch torpedo-tubes (eight fixed and two twin rotating mounts) for Mark 20E Bidder homing anti-submarine torpedoes, backed up by two Limbo anti-submarine mortars fitted aft. The Bidder homing torpedoes proved unsuccessful however, being too slow to catch modern submarines, and the torpedo tubes were soon removed.

The ship was fitted with a Type 293Q surface/air search radar on the foremast, with a Type 277 height-finding radar on a short mast forward of the foremast. A Mark 6M fire control system (including a Type 275 radar) for the 4.5 inch guns was mounted above the ship&#x27;s bridge, while a Type 974 navigation radar was also fitted. The ship&#x27;s sonar fit consisted of Type 174 search, Type 170 fire control sonar for Limbo and a Type 162 sonar for classifying targets on the sea floor.

===Modernisation===
From 1966 to 1969 &quot;Plymouth&quot; underwent a major modernisation, which brought the ship close in capacity to the . A hangar and flight deck was added aft to allow a Westland Wasp helicopter to be operated, at the expense of one of the Limbo anti-submarine mortars, while a Seacat launcher and the associated GWS20 director was mounted on the hangar roof. Two 20-mm cannons were added either side of the ship&#x27;s bridge. A MRS3 fire control system replaced the Mark 6M, and its integral Type 903 radar allowed the Type 277 height finder radar to be removed. A Type 993 surface/air-search radar replaced the existing Type 293Q radar, while the ship&#x27;s defences were enhanced by the addition of the Corvus chaff rocket dispenser.

==Operational history==
===1959–1981===
&quot;Plymouth&quot; served between 1963 and 1964 as the leader of the 22nd Escort Squadron and leader of the 29th Escort Squadron from 1964 to 1966 in Singapore and Australia.

In 1966 under the command of Captain Thomas Fanshawe &quot;Plymouth&quot; was assigned to the Beira Patrol. On 4 April she intercepted the oil tanker , but declined the use of force for diplomatic reasons she failed to prevent the ship from reaching Beira, raising concerns that its 18,700 tons of petroleum could then be sent by pipeline to the rebel British colony of Rhodesia.

In 1970 &quot;Plymouth&quot; took part in the Cook Bicentennial celebrations held in Sydney Harbour. After a spell inside a floating dock in Singapore, to clean and repaint her hull, the ship sailed across the Indian Ocean for a six-week stint on the Beira Patrol.

Back in the UK, &quot;Plymouth&quot; visited various ports around the country including Stornoway and Middlesbrough as part of a Royal Navy recruitment drive.

In 1977 the ship – as part of the 8th Frigate Squadron – attended the fleet review off Spithead for the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. She saw action in the Cod Wars between the United Kingdom and Iceland and also the Falklands War in 1982.

&quot;Plymouth&quot;, then commanded by Captain David Pentreath, was one of the first Royal Navy ships to arrive in the South Atlantic following the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands and South Georgia. Together with , and , she took part in the recapture of South Georgia during Operation Paraquet. On 25 April, her Wasp helicopter took part in an attack on the Argentinian submarine , which had previously been badly damaged by a depth charge attack from &quot;Antrim&quot;′s Wessex, claiming one hit on the waterline with an AS12 missile. After the crippled &quot;Santa Fe&quot; had sailed back into Grytviken harbour and was abandoned by her crew, a scratch force of Royal Marines, SAS and SBS troops was landed to capture the settlement. Along with &quot;Antrim&quot;, &quot;Plymouth&quot; provided naval gunfire support for this force, both ships firing a total of 235 shells, until the Argentinian troops raised the white flag. Later that day &quot;Plymouth&quot; sailed with &quot;Endurance&quot; to Leith Harbour, which was still held by the Argentines. The next day the garrison commander, Lieutenant commander Alfredo Astiz, signed the surrender in &quot;Plymouth&quot;″s wardroom.

On 1 May, &quot;Plymouth&quot; rejoined the task force and on the night of 20–21 May, she was part of the escort for the amphibious assault force entering San Carlos Water, being the first British vessel to sail into the bay. On 21 May the Argentine Air Force began a series of air attacks against the landing force. &quot;Plymouth&quot; provided assistance to the frigate , the first ship to suffer damage in &quot;Bomb Alley&quot;. For the next nine days she carried out air defense duties by day while by night undertaking escort and patrol missions and supporting ground troops with her guns. She was then dispatched to the carrier battle group, located some 150 miles east of the Falklands. On 30 May, the group came under attack by Exocet missile but no damage was incurred and on 1 June &quot;Plymouth&quot; returned to San Carlos Water.

On 8 June, the ship was alone in Falkland Sound, returning from a naval gunfire mission, when she was attacked by five Dagger fighter-bombers of Grupo 6 of the Argentine Air Force. Despite &quot;Plymouth&quot; firing her 20 mm guns and a Seacat missile, the aircraft dropped eight Mk 82 500 lb bombs, five of which struck home. One Dagger was unable to release its payload due to a mechanical failure and another suffered light damage from shrapnel. According to other sources &quot;Plymouth&quot; was hit by four 1000 lb bombs. All of the bombs failed to explode, but caused extensive damage: one hit the flight deck, detonating a depth charge and starting a fire, one went straight through her funnel and two more destroyed her Limbo anti-submarine mortar. Internal flooding caused the ship to take a six degree list. Five men were injured in the attack. The fire took 90 minutes to extinguish with assistance from &quot;Avenger&quot;, and repairs were carried out through the night and the next day, restoring some of her capabilities. &quot;Plymouth&quot; then withdrew to a repair area, where naval personnel on board the oil rig support vessel MV &quot;Stena Seaspread&quot; assisted in returning her to fighting order. She returned to shore bombardment duties on 14 June, when Argentine forces in the Falklands finally surrendered.

After hostilities had ended &quot;Plymouth&quot; was the first British warship to enter Port Stanley harbour on 17 June. After assisting in establishing naval control of the harbour she returned briefly to San Carlos before leaving the south Atlantic on 21 June in company with &quot;Glamorgan&quot;. She returned to Rosyth Dockyard on 14 July for a full repair and a refit. During the course of the war she fired 909 4.5 inch shells and nine Seacat missiles.

===1983–1987===
In 1983, &quot;Plymouth&quot; served as the West Indies guard ship. On 11 April 1984, she was involved in a collision with the German &quot;Braunschweig&quot; in fog off Bornholm during exercises in the Baltic. &quot;Plymouth&quot;″s bow was damaged, and she had to put into Karlskrona, Sweden for temporary repairs. In 1986 she suffered a boiler room fire, killing two sailors.

==Preservation==

After the ship, which was the last Type 12 in service, was paid off on 28 April 1988, she was acquired by the Warship Preservation Trust. In 1990 she was towed to Glasgow and placed on permanent display at a berth on the River Clyde. In the late 1990s, she was relocated to the Great Float within Birkenhead Docks for display alongside other preserved ships and submarines, where she became the undertaking of Peel Holdings.

==Scrapping controversy==
On 6 February 2006 the Warship Preservation Trust closed citing financial difficulties. &quot;Plymouth&quot; became the property of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company following the demise of the trust. Plymouth City Council expressed an interest in the ship; a campaign group called the HMS &quot;Plymouth&quot; Preservation Trust attempted to raise £250,000 to bring the warship back to her home city. However the attempt to bring the Type 12 frigate back to Plymouth&#x27;s Millbay Docks failed after the Associated British Ports withdrew the offer of a berth in January 2007. An online petition then called on the UK government to provide a berth for the ship, but it was announced in 2012 that she had been sold for scrapping.

In January 2014 campaigners continued to dispute Peel Ports – which owns Mersey Docks – that it had ownership rights to &quot;Plymouth&quot;. The action group accused Peel of allowing the condition of &quot;Plymouth&quot; to worsen in order to make any attempt to move/preserve her appear unfeasible.

The ship was towed from Vittoria Dock, Birkenhead, by the tug &quot;Amber II&quot;, on 20 August 2014 to be scrapped in Turkey. HMS &quot;Plymouth&quot; was scrapped at Aliaga in 2014.

There appears to be some controversy about how the sale was conducted by The Peel Group and some of the clauses included in the sale contract with the dismantlers.

<doc id="583800" wikidata="Q842981" url="?curid=583800" title="Therm">
<text>The therm (symbol, thm) is a non-SI unit of heat energy equal to 100,000 British thermal units (BTU), and approximately megajoules, kilowatt-hours, 25,200kilocalories and thermies. One therm is the energy content of approximately of natural gas at standard temperature and pressure. However, the BTU is not standardised worldwide, with slightly different values in the EU, UK, and United States, meaning that the energy content of the therm also varies by territory.

Natural gas meters measure volume and not energy content, and given that the energy density varies with the mix of hydrocarbons in the natural gas, a &quot;therm factor&quot; is used by natural gas companies to convert the volume of gas used to its heat equivalent, usually being expressed in units of &quot;therms per CCF&quot; (CCF is an abbreviation for 100 standard cubic feet). Higher than average concentration of ethane, propane or butane will increase the therm factor and the inclusion of non-flammable impurities, such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen will reduce it. The Wobbe Index of a fuel gas is also sometimes used to quantify the amount of heat per unit volume burnt.

==Definitions==
* Therm (EC) ≡ BTUISO
*: = joules
*: ≈ kWh
*: The therm (EC) is often used by engineers in the US.
* Therm (US) ≡ BTU59°F
*: = joules
*: ≈ kWh.
* Therm (UK) ≡ joules
*: ≡ kWh

== Decatherm ==
A decatherm or dekatherm (dth or Dth) is 10 therms, which is 1,000,000British thermal units or 1.055 GJ. It is a combination of the prefix for 10 (deca, often with the US spelling &quot;deka&quot;) and the energy unit therm. There is some ambiguity, as &quot;decatherm&quot; uses the prefix &quot;d&quot; to mean 10, where in metric the prefix &quot;d&quot; means &quot;deci&quot; or one-tenth, and the prefix &quot;da&quot; means &quot;deca&quot;, or 10, though decatherm may use a capital &quot;D&quot;. The energy content of natural gas measured at standard conditions is approximately equal to one dekatherm. 

This unit of energy is used primarily to measure natural gas. Natural gas is a mixture of gases containing approximately 80% methane (CH4) and its heating value varies from about or , depending on the mix of different gases in the gas stream. The volume of natural gas with heating value of one dekatherm is about . Noncombustible carbon dioxide (CO2) lowers the heating value of natural gas. Heavier hydrocarbons such as ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), and butane (C4H10) increase its heating value. Since customers who buy natural gas are actually buying heat, gas distribution companies who bill by volume routinely adjust their rates to compensate for this.

The company Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation, a natural gas pipeline company, started to use the unit dekatherm in about 1972. To simplify billing, Texas Eastern staff members coined the term dekatherm and proposed using calorimeters to measure and bill gas delivered to customers in dekatherms. This would eliminate the constant calculation of rate adjustments to dollar per 1000 cubic feet rates in order to assure that all customers received the same amount of heat per dollar. A settlement agreement reflecting the new billing procedure and settlement rates was filed in 1973. The Federal Power Commission issued an order approving the settlement agreement and the new tariff using dekatherms later that year, Other gas distribution companies also began to use this process.

In spite of the need for adjustments, many companies continue to use standard cubic feet rather than dekatherms to measure and bill natural gas.

==Usage==
United Kingdom regulations were amended to replace therms with joules with effect from 1999, with natural gas usually retailed in the derived unit, kilowatt-hours. Despite this, the wholesale UK gas market trades in therms. In the United States, natural gas is commonly billed in CCFs (hundreds of cubic feet) or therms.

==Carbon footprint==
According to the EPA burning one therm of natural gas produces on average of carbon dioxide.

<text>Karelia (; Karelian and ; , historically Коре́ла, &quot;Korela&quot; []; ) is an area in Northern Europe of historical significance for Russia (including the Soviet era), Finland, and Sweden. It is currently divided between northwestern Russia (the federal subjects of the Republic of Karelia and Leningrad Oblast) and Finland (the regions of South Karelia, North Karelia, and the eastern portion of Kymenlaakso).


==Use of name==
Various regions may be called Karelia. Finnish Karelia is a historical province of Finland and is now divided between Finland and Russia, often called just &quot;Karjala&quot; in Finnish. The eastern part of this chiefly Lutheran area was ceded to Russia after the Winter War of 1939–40.

The Republic of Karelia is a Russian federal subject, including East Karelia, with a chiefly Russian Orthodox population.

Within present-day Finland, &quot;Karjala&quot; refers to the regions of South and North Karelia, although parts of historical Karelia also lie within the region of Kymenlaakso (east of the River Kymi), Northern Savonia (Kaavi, Rautavaara and Säyneinen), and Southern Savonia (Mäntyharju).

==Geography==
Karelia stretches from the White Sea coast to the Gulf of Finland. It contains the two largest lakes in Europe, Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega. The Karelian Isthmus is located between the Gulf of Finland and Lake Ladoga. The highest point of Karelia, the high Nuorunen, is located on the Russian side of the Maanselka hill region.

The border between Karelia and Ingria, the land of the closely related Ingrian people, had originally been the Neva River itself but later on it was moved northward into the Karelian isthmus to follow the Sestra River (), today in the Saint Petersburg metropolitan area, but in 1812–1940 the Russo-Finnish border.

On the other side of Lake Ladoga, the River Svir is usually thought of as the traditional southern border of Karelian territory while Lake Onega and the White Sea mark the Eastern border. The River Kymi marks the historic western border of Karelian territory as it served as the boundary between the Häme Finns and the Karelians during the Middle Ages. The River Kymi is also said to have formed a boundary between the eastern and western cultural spheres by the beginning of the Bronze Age at the latest. In the North lived the nomadic Samis, but there were no natural borders except for large wooded areas (taiga) and the tundra.

In historical texts, Karelia is sometimes divided into &quot;East Karelia&quot; and &quot;West Karelia,&quot; which are also called Russian Karelia and Finnish Karelia respectively. The area to the north of Lake Ladoga which belonged to Finland before World War II is called Ladoga Karelia, and the parishes on the old pre-war border are sometimes called Border Karelia. White Karelia (sometimes the Finnish or Karelian term &quot;Viena Karelia&quot;, or in some English-language sources, &quot;White Sea Karelia&quot;, is used) is the northern part of East Karelia and Olonets Karelia is the southern part.

Tver Karelia denotes the villages in the Tver Oblast that are inhabited by Tver Karelians.

==History==
During the Early Middle Ages, settlers from western Finland mixed with the local population to form the Karelian ethnic group. Possible migration from elsewhere may also have contributed to the Karelian ethnic composition.

Archeological evidence indicates that Karelian inhabitation was highest along the western shore of Lake Ladoga and the Karelian Isthmus, with multiple cemeteries and other archeological discoveries dating from AD 600 to AD 800. In South Karelia, the number of archeological discoveries from this time period is lower, though permanent inhabitation was nonetheless present. Lappee, South Karelia has been continuously inhabited for approximately 2,000 years. In North Karelia, only one archeological discovery from this time period has been found, dating to the eighth century. The considerably higher number of archeological discoveries in these regions from AD 800 to AD 1050 indicates that the Karelian population grew and expanded rapidly during this time.

Karelia was bitterly fought over by Sweden and the Novgorod Republic for a period starting in the 13th-century Swedish-Novgorodian Wars. The Treaty of Nöteborg (Finnish: Pähkinäsaaren rauha) in 1323 divided Karelia between the two. Sweden received the southern portion of the Karelian Isthmus and most of South Karelia. The province of Swedish Karelia would include this territory, plus the region east of the Kymi river, with Viborg (Finnish: Viipuri) becoming the capital of the province. Novgorod received the northern portion of the Karelian Isthmus. North Karelia, Ladoga Karelia, and the northern portion of South Karelia fell under Novgorodian control. Käkisalmi served as the main population center of this region.

In the Treaty of Stolbovo of 1617, large parts of Russian Karelia were ceded to Sweden. Conflicts between the new Swedish rulers and the indigenous population of these areas led to an exodus: thousands of Karelians, including the ancestors of the Tver Karelians, emigrated to Russia.
The Treaty of Nystad (Finnish: Uudenkaupungin rauha) in 1721 between Imperial Russia and Sweden ceded a portion of Karelia to Russia. The Treaty of Åbo in 1743 between Sweden and Russia then ceded South Karelia to Russia. After Finland had been occupied by Russia in the Finnish War, parts of the ceded provinces (Old Finland) were incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Finland in 1812. In 1917, Finland became independent and the border was confirmed by the Treaty of Tartu in 1920.

Finnish partisans were involved in attempts to overthrow the Bolsheviks in Russian Karelia (East Karelia) in 1918–21, as in the failed Aunus expedition. They also wanted to incorporate the rest of Karelia into Finland and cooperated with the short-lived Republic of Uhtua. These mainly private expeditions ended after the signing of the Treaty of Tartu. After the end of the Russian Civil War and the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1922, the Russian part of Karelia became the Karelian Autonomous republic of the Soviet Union (ASSR) in 1923.
At the beginning of the Second World War in 1939, the Soviet Union attacked Finland, thus starting the Winter War. The Treaty of Moscow, signed in 1940, handed a large portion of Finnish Karelia to the Soviet Union, and over 400,000 people had to be relocated within Finland. During the Continuation War of 1941-1944, Finland took back territory ceded in 1940, and also invaded and occupied much of East Karelia. Finland was forced out of these regions in 1944. After the war, Soviet expansion caused considerable bitterness in Finland, which lost its fourth biggest city, Viipuri, its industrial heartland along the river Vuoksi, the eastern portion of the Saimaa canal that connected central Finland to the Gulf of Finland, and access to the fishing waters of Lake Ladoga (Finnish: Laatokka). One eighth of its citizens became refugees with no chance of return. The whole population from the areas ceded to the Soviet Union was evacuated and resettled in other parts of Finland. The present inhabitants of the former Finnish parts of Russia, including the city of Vyborg/Viipuri and the Karelian Isthmus – are post-war immigrants or their descendants.

The former Karelian ASSR was incorporated into a new Karelo-Finnish SSR from 1941 to 1956, but then it became an ASSR again. Karelia was the only Soviet republic that was &quot;demoted&quot; from an SSR to an ASSR within the Russian SFSR. In 1991, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the ASSR became the Republic of Karelia.

The portion of Viipuri Province that remained within Finland following the Second World War was renamed Kymi Province, and kept this name from 1945 to 1997. The eastern part of this province is now the region of South Karelia, while the western portion is part of Kymenlaakso.

==Politics==

Karelia is politically divided between Finland and Russia. The Republic of Karelia is a federal subject of Russia formed in 1991 from the Karelian ASSR. The Karelian Isthmus belongs to the Leningrad Oblast. The Finnish side consists of parts of the regions (&quot;maakunta&quot;) of South Karelia, North Karelia and Kymenlaakso.

There are some small groups of Finns campaigning for closer ties between Finland and Karelia: for instance, in the Karjalan Liitto (Karelian League) and ProKarelia.
==Demographics==

On the Finnish side, the area is Finnish-speaking. The South Karelian dialects of the Finnish language (closely related to the Karelian language) are spoken in South Karelia. The eastern Savonian dialects are spoken in North Karelia, part of the group of dialects spoken in Eastern and Central Finland.

Ingrian Finnish dialects are spoken in Ingria, which is an area around St. Petersburg, between the Estonian border and Lake Ladoga. Ingrian Finns settled in the region in the 17th century after the Swedish conquest of the area. The settlers spoke Karelian and Savonian dialects of Finnish. The older inhabitants of the Ingria, the Ingrians, have their own language which is related to the Karelian language and the south-eastern dialects of Finnish.

Karelians evacuated from the part of Finnish Karelia ceded to Russia were resettled all over Finland. Today about one million people in Finland can trace their roots in the area ceded to the Soviet Union after World War II. In Finland, about 5,000 people speak the Karelian language.

==Culture==

*&quot;Kalevala&quot;
*Karelian Bear Dog
*Karelian hot pot
*Karelian language
*Karelian pasties
*Karelo-Finnish Laika
*Music of Karelia
== Tourism ==
Russian Karelia is a regular destination for international tourism due to its unique architectural, cultural and historical sites such as Kizhi and Valaam. The region is visited by tourists in both summer and winter when possible activities include riding in a sled behind a dog team and running from the banya to an ice hole and back. Summer hikers can visit the Kivach waterfall or the Demon&#x27;s Chair plateau.

In South Karelia, Lappeenranta is a popular destination for Russian tourists, with 1.5 million visiting annually. Imatrankoski in Imatra has been a tourist attraction since the late 18th century, when the Empress of Russia Catherine the Great visited the site in 1772.

Koli National Park in North Karelia began receiving tourists when Karelianism became a major trend. Koli was a source of inspiration for numerous painters and composers such as Jean Sibelius, Juhani Aho and Eero Järnefelt, who in turn contributed to Karelianism through their work. Koli gained national park status in 1991.

<text>139 Juewa ( ) is a very large and dark main belt asteroid. It is probably composed of primitive carbonaceous material. It was the first asteroid discovered from China.

Juewa was discovered from Beijing by the visiting American astronomer James Craig Watson on 10 October 1874; Watson was in China to observe the transit of Venus. Watson asked Prince Gong to name the asteroid. Gong&#x27;s choice was (roughly, &quot;Star of China&#x27;s fortune&quot;). Watson used the first two characters (&#x27;star&#x27; being redundant), transliterating them &quot;Juewa&quot; in Wade convention of the time. (In pinyin, is transliterated .)

Since 1988 there have been 8 reported stellar occultations by Juewa. From the occultation on 31 August 2013 the best fit ellipse measures × .

13-cm radar observations of this asteroid from the Arecibo Observatory between 1980 and 1985 were used to produce a diameter estimate of 172 km. Based upon radar data, the near surface solid density of the asteroid is .

<text>Kish Kash is the third studio album by English electronic music duo Basement Jaxx, released on 20 October 2003 by XL Recordings and Astralwerks. After a lengthy tour which caused them exhaustion and homesickness, they settled in their new studio and wanted to develop a fresh new approach, less reliant on grooves and samples and more focused on songwriting.

It reached number 17 on the UK Albums Chart. The album was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2004. It later won the first Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Album in 2005. Three singles were released from the album: &quot;Lucky Star&quot;, &quot;Good Luck&quot; and &quot;Plug It In&quot;.

==Background and development==

Returning from their 2001 world tour to promote &quot;Rooty&quot; with exhaustion and homesickness, Felix and Simon settled into their new Brixton studio. On 23 September 2002, they released second extended play &quot;Junction&quot;, which included four new songs and was named after Loughborough Junction, the place of the duo&#x27;s original parties. They also remixed Missy Elliott, DJ Sneak and Justin Timberlake while still deciding where to go next.

The recording process took place between March 2002 and August 2003. According to Buxton, the duo undertook the recording of &quot;Kish Kash&quot; in &quot;a sober state of mind&quot;. While making the album, they both stayed away from clubs, preferring to ignore the latest fads in dance culture, wanting to develop a fresh approach, less reliant on grooves and samples and more focused on songwriting, often starting with just a voice and guitar. &quot;We kind of went back to school,&quot; says Buxton. &quot;We got this new studio and had to learn how to use it.&quot; Adds Ratcliffe: &quot;There was a greater sense that we didn&#x27;t know what we were doing but it was more enjoyable than before.&quot;

Buxton also revealed that they were going to name the album &quot;Rhapsody&quot;, but his father thought it was &quot;too square&quot; and commented: &quot;It would be okay if [the album] was a rap record about sodomy, but it’s not.&quot; Someone else then said the title was &quot;like a box of chocolates or a Gareth Gates album&quot;, so they changed it to &quot;Kish Kash&quot; before the artwork went to print. The new name was a phrase for money used by one of their friends.

The album was also their last recording with record label Astralwerks, as they announced backstage of the 47th Annual Grammy Awards.

== Content==
The album opens with &quot;Good Luck&quot;, with vocals contributed by Lisa Kekaula, a member of the American rock and roll group The Bellrays. The duo decided to collaborate with The London Session Orchestra on the song. Ratcliffe said, &quot;I wanted to make a beautiful song. But I was having a lot of trouble figuring out how to express it.&quot; Their manager then suggested that they use an orchestra. &quot;16 people participated in the recording. It was pretty spectacular. They&#x27;re making real music!&quot;

&quot;Benjilude&quot; features vocals from Joe Benjamin, a 70-year-old Bermudan man &quot;that walks around Brixton with a Stetson hat, a large stick and a kind of poncho.&quot; Buxton befriended him when the man used to live there, then he invited him to studio. &quot;We like interludes; used sparingly and wisely, they help to blend things,&quot; said Ratcliffe.

Meshell Ndegeocello was touring in the UK when she worked with the duo for &quot;Right Here&#x27;s the Spot&quot; and &quot;Feels Like Home&quot;. But on the second day, she felt ill and they had to make her a bed in the vocal booth. She told &quot;Windy City Times&quot; about her experience working with the duo: &quot;It was good. I had a great time and I enjoyed it very much. It was nice to work with different people. I always enjoy the experience of making music with people&quot;. On the making of &quot;Right Here&#x27;s the Spot&quot;, she stated: &quot;I go out (to night clubs) myself and I love that particular genre of music. It was fun.&quot; In a 2015 interview with &quot;Songwriting Magazine&quot;, she recalled the sessions with the duo, stating that they &quot;definitely taught [her] about sonics and sound, and also just the method of singing a lot and letting someone sift through it all and find the phrases which they like. [...] I think that&#x27;s an amazing way to make songs.&quot;

The collaboration between the duo and Phoebe Killdeer came as a suggestion from their record label, as Astralwerks also wanted Killdeer to study the two, despite the fact that she was a singer then herself. Killdeer recorded her part in three hours on an afternoon for the track &quot;Tonight&quot;. She shared: &quot;[It was] fun to work with them. We complemented each other well.&quot;

The album&#x27;s second track, &quot;Right Here&#x27;s the Spot&quot;, is a collaboration with Meshell Ndegeocello. Michaelangelo Matos from &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, called it &quot;Ndegeocello&#x27;s Prince-tribute collaboration with Basement Jaxx.&quot; &quot;Cish Cash&quot;, featuring the voice of Siouxsie Sioux, is a punk-influenced track. The album&#x27;s concluding track, &quot;Feels Like Home&quot;, was claimed by &quot;Excalim.ca&quot;&#x27;s Martin Turenne as &quot;the gloomiest track in Jaxx history&quot; with &quot;a beatless dirge in which grinding electronics buzz&quot; under Meshell Ndegeocello&#x27;s &quot;mournful&quot; singing. Ernest Hardy from &quot;LA Weekly&quot; called the song a &quot;dreamy, atmospheric closing number&quot;.

The lyrical theme of &quot;Supersonic&quot; is &quot;outer space&quot;.

=== Musical style ===
Basement Jaxx had previously been inspired by their peers in the dance music scene, but by the time of recording &quot;Kish Kash&quot; this had changed. &quot;We were listening to what other people were doing and realizing it was all pretty stagnant and uninspiring,&quot; says Simon. &quot;There was nothing to look up to in a way. We had to do something new.&quot; Around this time, the duo listened to artists that had &quot;a less direct influence&quot; on the record including Radiohead, the Neptunes, Timbaland and System of a Down.

Instead of being influenced by artists they had been in the past, like Prince and Todd Terry, the duo were more influenced by Brian Eno on their third album. &quot;If anything, the new album is more classic in feel, more song-based&quot;, Ratcliffe explains to &quot;Billboard&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s more traditional in that respect. It&#x27;s also a bit more intelligent, which is a very dangerous word to use.&quot;

Mark Pytlik from &quot;Pitchfork&quot; summed up the album&#x27;s musical genres: &quot;Containing fused-together fragments of disco, electro, acid, bollywood, new wave, and whatever the hell the incredible &#x27;Living Room&#x27; is, &quot;Kish Kash&quot;&#x27;s gaudy world collage fell by the wayside next to the minimalist sounds of microhouse and grime.&quot;

== Singles ==

The first single released from the album was &quot;Lucky Star&quot; in November 2003. It reached number 23 in the UK charts. The single marked Basement Jaxx&#x27;s return after a two-year break. The single featured Mercury Music Prize-winning artist Dizzee Rascal and British Bhangra vocalist Mona Singh on the chorus.

&quot;Good Luck&quot; was released in January 2004 and debuted at number 12 in the UK. The lead vocals were sung by Lisa Kekaula, lead singer of US band The Bellrays. &quot;Good Luck&quot; was re-released in July, due to exposure on the BBC coverage of the Euro 2004 television campaign. It reached number 14 that time around.

&quot;Plug It In&quot;, the third and final single from the album, was released on 4 April 2004 and debuted at number 22. It featured &#x27;N Sync member JC Chasez (credited as &#x27;J.C. Chasez&#x27;).

A music video which didn&#x27;t feature Siouxsie Sioux was also made for &quot;Cish Cash&quot;, though it was not released as a single.

==Critical reception==
Despite being very pleased with the album, the duo expected a critical backlash for its star turns and darker sound. Review aggregator website Metacritic gave the album a score of 85 out of 100, signifying &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. &quot;We thought we’d get a kicking&quot;, says Buxton, &quot;but it’s gone down well.&quot;

Scott Plagenhoef of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave &quot;Kish Kash&quot; a score of 9.1/10, calling the album &quot;the most propulsive, ferocious music of the year as well as some of the most poignant.&quot; David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called it &quot;the richest and most fervent music the Jaxx have ever made&quot;. John Davidson of &quot;PopMatters&quot; called it &quot;their best sustained effort so far.&quot; Andy Battaglia of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called it &quot;an album that sets the bar for density and imagination almost unreasonably high.&quot; &quot;Blender&quot; praised the album as &quot;their most violently inventive album yet&quot;, while &quot;Uncut&quot; described it as &quot;a truly exhilarating 50 minutes of music.&quot;

Stephen Dalton of &quot;NME&quot;, on the other hand, called &quot;Kish Kash&quot; &quot;a naggingly problematic record&quot; with &quot;a void at its heart that no amount of cool celebrity mates can conceal.&quot; Dave Simpson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; was critical of the album&#x27;s &quot;recurring sense of enforced jollity&quot; and &quot;lame attempts at introspection&quot;, but concluded that &quot;anyone left standing on pop&#x27;s dancefloor will certainly lap this up&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s John Bush, whilst giving it a very positive review and calling it perhaps the best dance record of 2003, wrote that &quot;Kish Kash&quot; was &quot;the least imaginative record Basement Jaxx have ever released.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; was more reserved in his praise, giving the album a three-star honorable mention rating and remarking: &quot;Is that blood the big-time vocalists smear on the tracks, or ichor?&quot;

&quot;Complex&quot; called the album their last &quot;great project&quot;, seeing as their subsequent albums failed to make a mark with critics or the Grammy board.

Ella Eyre said the album was the first she ever bought &quot;because [she] kept stealing [her] mum&#x27;s and [her mother] hid it from [her].&quot; She also cited Basement Jaxx as one of her musical influences.

==Accolades==

&quot;Kish Kash&quot; was included in several year-end lists, including &quot;Spin&quot; at number 38. It was voted the eighth best album of 2003 in the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;.

&quot;Vice&quot;&#x27;s electronic music website Trump ranked the album on their list of &quot;99 Greatest Dance Albums of All Time&quot; at number 36, calling it a &quot;repulsive menu of flatulent electronic overload&quot;, while at &quot;PopMatters&quot;, the album was listed on their &quot;100 Best Albums of the 2000s&quot; list at number 18. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked &quot;Kish Kash&quot; and &quot;Rooty&quot; at 66 and 65, respectively, in its list of the 100 top albums from 2000 to 2004.

While predicting winners of the 47th Annual Grammy Awards&#x27; categories, Sal Cinquemani and Paul Henderson from &quot;Slant Six Magazine&quot; predicted the song&#x27;s win, with Cinquemani jokingly said: &quot;Do they really need to make room for &quot;Kish Kash&quot;? I would have thought it was a glock.&quot; Their prediction came true as Basement Jaxx became the first ever to win this category. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, their win was greeted with &quot;universal applause.&quot;

<text>Pieter Hendricksz. de Hooch (; also spelled &quot;Hoogh&quot; or &quot;Hooghe&quot;; 20 December 1629  – after 1683), was a Dutch Golden Age painter famous for his genre works of quiet domestic scenes with an open doorway. He was a contemporary, in the Delft Guild of St. Luke, of Jan Vermeer with whom his work shares themes and style. De Hooch was first recorded in Delft on 5 August 1652, when he and another painter, Hendrick van der Burgh witnessed the signing of a will. He was active in 1683, but his date of death is unknown (his son Pieter died in 1684, a date often wrongly given for the father).

==Biography==

De Hooch was born in Rotterdam to Hendrick Hendricksz de Hooch, a bricklayer, and Annetge Pieters, a midwife, baptised at the Reformed Church in Rotterdam in 1629. He was the eldest of five children and outlived all of his siblings, evidently raised in a working class home. Though, his father was described as a &quot;master bricklayer&quot;, hence a skilled artisan required to be a member of the guild. Little is known of his early life, and most archival evidence suggests he worked in Rotterdam, Delft, and Amsterdam. According to his first biographer Arnold Houbraken, he studied art in Haarlem under the landscape painter Nicolaes Berchem at the same time as Jacob Ochtervelt and was known for his &quot;kamergezichten&quot; or &quot;room-views&quot; with ladies and gentlemen in conversation. But de Hooch&#x27;s work seems to continue in the spirit of Hendrik Sorgh, an older Rotterdam painter who had a special affinity for organising figures in interiors.

Beginning in 1650, he worked as a painter and servant for a linen-merchant and art collector named Justus de la Grange in Rotterdam. His service for the merchant required him to accompany him on his travels to The Hague, Leiden, and Delft, to which he moved in 1652, settling on Oude Delft 161 with de la Grange. Later, he lived next to the former Saint Hieronymus convent, once situated between Oude Delft and Westvest. It is likely that de Hooch handed over most of his works to la Grange during this period in exchange for board and other benefits, as this was a common commercial arrangement for painters at the time, and a later inventory recorded that la Grange possessed eleven of his paintings.

De Hooch was married in Delft in 1654 to Jannetje van der Burch, possibly sister of Hendrick van der Burgh, by whom he fathered seven children. While in Delft, de Hooch is also believed to have learned from the painters Carel Fabritius and Nicolaes Maes, who were early members of the Delft School. He became a member of the painters&#x27; guild of Saint Luke in 1655 (two years after Vermeer). Though, he must have faced financial difficulties, as he was unable to pay the admission fee of 12 guilders. His daughter Anna was born in Delft on 14 November 1656. Based on the fact that his wife attended a baptism in Amsterdam in 1660, it has been determined that he moved to Amsterdam by then, though the success of the trekschuit by then meant that a trip to Amsterdam could be made easily in a day.

Little is known of de Hooch&#x27;s living arrangements in Amsterdam, though it has been established that he had contact with Emanuel de Witte through a lawsuit brought against de Witte. The burial records in Amsterdam for two of de Hooch&#x27;s children, dated June 1663 and March 1665, indicate that he resided on Regulierspad and Engelspad, respectively. These &quot;paths&quot; were situated outside the old city walls and were known for accommodating some of the city&#x27;s poorest inhabitants, sharply contrasting his affluent clients in Amsterdam. In 1668, he was living in the Konijnenstraat near the Lauriergracht, where he stayed for the next two years at least. His third son was baptized in 1672. In 1674, de Hooch&#x27;s financial situation was meagre enough to escape the tax registers entirely, likely a result of the declining art market in the Dutch Republic, following the onerous Rampjaar, which hugely strained the economy and all facets of Dutch cultural activity. In his later years, de Hooch painted more, and often larger paintings, measuring over 100 centimetres.

The date of his death is unknown. For a significant period, it was believed that de Hooch died in 1684 as a resident in the Amsterdam dolhuis, a lunatic asylum. Despite this, official records from that institution reveal that the Pieter de Hooch who died there was, in fact, the artist&#x27;s son, who also bore the name Pieter. The registration of his son Pieter Pietersz. de Hooch at the Dolhuis in 1679 is noted as the last record of de Hooch in Amsterdam.

In 2017 the Turing Foundation sponsored a new research project for the Delft Prinsenhof museum and the Rijksmuseum to work on a new overview exhibition focussing on the works in their collection, to be presented in a combined exhibition 2019–2020.

== Works ==
The early work of de Hooch was mostly composed of scenes of soldiers and peasants in stables and taverns in the manner of Adriaen van Ostade, though he used these to develop great skill in light, colour, and perspective rather than to explore an interest in the subject matter. In these merry company compositions, the focal point is not dispersed among numerous figure groups, in contrast to the soldier paintings of other artists. Instead, emphasis is concentrated on a principal group illuminated directly by the sun, which prominently stands out against a dark background, in the style of chiaroscuro. These works frequently showcase colour combinations typical of the artist&#x27;s later period, such as a vivid vermilion and lemon yellow, often complemented by a warm dark green or blue in the shadows. Occasionally, backgrounds open into brightly lit adjoining rooms, and lighted figures may be framed in doorways, known as a &quot;&#x27;doorsien&quot;&#x27;, literally a &#x27;see through&#x27;. The contrast between light and shadow tends to be accentuated, with sunlit portions of the canvas appearing cooler and paler compared to his later works. Notably, De Hooch&#x27;s mastery is most evident when portraying figures in repose, exemplified in two masterpieces painted around 1654 - housed in the Palazzo Corsini and the other in the London National Gallery - which mark the culmination of his early period.

=== Delft Period 1652-1660 ===
De Hooch&#x27;s early artistic development is evidenced by the maturity exhibited in his paintings executed around 1655. By 1654, he had attained a zenith in depicting soldier scenes, a focus that persisted into the initial years of his marriage. After starting his family in the mid-1650s, he switched his focus to domestic scenes. These were possibly of his own family, though his works of well-to-do women breastfeeding and caring for children could also indicate that he had attended his mother on her rounds as a midwife. Evidence also suggests that de Hooch may have been employed as a servant under Justus de la Grange, an experience which likely influenced his empathetic and nuanced portrayal of servants and domestic workers in his paintings. His work showed astute observation of the mundane details of everyday life while also functioning as well-ordered morality tales. From the fact he dated a whole series in 1658, whilst he dated very few others, suggests he himself recognised the importance of these paintings.

These paintings often exhibited a sophisticated and delicate treatment of light similar to those of Vermeer, who lived in Delft at the same time as de Hooch. The themes and compositions are also comparable between De Hooch and Vermeer. 19th-century art historians had assumed that Vermeer had been influenced by de Hooch&#x27;s work, and indeed de Hooch first demonstrated a special interest in combining the figure with interior geometry. He succeeded in blending the South Holland techniques of perspective and interior space construction with powerful naturalism and focus on figures, a style undoubtedly influenced by the prominent genre painters of his time. An x-ray of &quot;Woman Weighing Gold Coin&quot; shows that De Hooch had first tried to paint another figure in the empty chair, pointing to his canvas being the more original model that Vermeer quoted. Another signature work of Vermeer, &quot;The Love Letter,&quot; is also said to have been inspired by de Hooch, and paintings of Vermeer have been found to have posthumously been inscribed with the signature of de Hooch, perhaps in attempt to inflate the value of the then unknown Vermeer&#x27;s paintings.In the late 1650s, Pieter de Hooch pioneered a new genre of painting that showcased unprecedented spatial order and naturalism. In tranquil depictions of homes and courtyards, which appear casually observed and informal, are carefully composed with a sophisticated grasp of perspective and a fine attention to aerial accuracy. Many of these subtly revolutionary paintings revisit themes from his early works, such as merry companies with drinking soldiers, accompanied by their hostesses. However, the dimly lit stables and taverns of his earlier period are replaced by sunlit interiors, gardens, and courtyards of the middle class. De Hooch&#x27;s cityscapes were some of the last Dutch painting specialties to emerge. Along with Fabritius&#x27; &quot;A View of Delft,&quot; Pieter de Hooch&#x27;s depictions of courtyards, bleaching grounds, and street scenes often feature prominent genre figures and are notable for their early focus on urban environments. These works are among the first to emphasise cityscapes, cropping up mainly in de Hooch&#x27;s time in Delft, where his works feature important buildings such as the Oude Kerk, Nieuwe Kerk, and the rooftop of the newly built Amsterdam Town Hall. Also featured are areas of residence for de Hooch, including courtyards similar to those found behind old Delft homes around the Binnenwatersloot where his wife lived. These edifices were often arranged fictitiously, bringing many important buildings into one scene. De Hooch also shared themes and compositions with Emanuel de Witte, though De Witte soon devoted himself mainly to painting church interior scenes after moving to Amsterdam in 1651. De Witte seems more preoccupied with the rooms themselves, filling his paintings with objects, whilst de Hooch was more interested in people and their relationships to each other, rarely leaving the background of pictures unexplored. This was frequently exhibited, often to exhibit religious iconography or as an empathetic introspection into the lives of the subjects.

=== Amsterdam Period 1660-1670 ===
In the 1660s, he began to paint for wealthier patrons in Amsterdam who gained their wealth through increased trade and stock exchanges in a time of unrivalled prosperity, coinciding with de Hooch&#x27;s premier works, during his Delft-Amsterdam transition. During this period, he was known for upscale merry company scenes and family portraits in opulent interiors with marble floors and high ceilings. During his time in Amsterdam, he continued to make his domestic scenes, but both the interiors and their occupants appear more opulent. With the change in setting, his art evolved to feature cooler colours, more substantial figures, and a technique marked by greater precision. Lacking entrée to the homes of the aristocracy, de Hooch conceived the idea of utilising the newly-built City Hall as a background for his social scenes, a marble-covered setting once considered the eighth wonder of the world. He was thus enabled to paint accurate architectural settings, and the interiors, and to some extent, the light and colour schemes in these paintings are extremely successful. The reference of these public buildings is likely accountable for the overrepresentation of wealth in Dutch households. These works are often associated with the &quot;Leidse Fijnschilders&quot;, notable for their meticulously detailed paintings, which commanded very high prices. Though, the price of de Hooch&#x27;s works did not garner the same prices as the Fijnschilders&#x27; until the early nineteenth century, when interest in his works increased, as English collectors, including George IV, Sir Robert Peel, and the Duke of Wellington acquired works by de Hooch. Before this period, his paintings commanded a smaller price than that of Vermeer&#x27;s, and only a fraction of that of Dou&#x27;s or van Mieris&#x27;.

De Hooch also portrayed courting couples engaged in skittle playing, with the finest example on display at Waddesdon Manor. This piece was created shortly after his move to Amsterdam and exemplifies his shift from simple Delft courtyards to the depiction of early country house gardens. The skittle-playing theme connects to the imagery of the &quot;Garden of Love&quot; and &quot;Game of Love&quot; found in both high art and popular print culture. The woman gazing out at the viewer serves as the central figure in this playful &quot;Sport of Love.&quot;

=== Late Period in Amsterdam 1670-1683 ===
Many scholars assert that Pieter de Hooch&#x27;s work from around 1670 onwards became more stylised and diminished in quality, with some describing him as having &quot;quickly lost his inspiration and charm.&quot; However, these assessments are frequently critiqued for applying the aesthetic standards of his earlier Delft paintings rather than considering the evolving artistic norms of post-1670 Dutch art, and the disastrous Rampjaar of 1672 which similarly claimed other contemporary careers . This included time-renowned masters such as Jan Steen, who applied for a licence to run a tavern in the wake of economic downturn.

It is possible that de Hooch&#x27;s work was influenced by personal distress, following the death of his wife in 1667 at the age of 38, which left him to care for a young family. During his Amsterdam period, de Hooch encountered less success when revisiting motifs from his Delft era, such as depictions involving a young mother with her child and a serving maid, or when he revisited the soldier scenes reminiscent of his earlier days. Though facing minor success with reinterpretations of his Delft period, these instances of self-repetition are devoid of fresh impressions. The paintings are perceived as having an exaggeratedly dark overall tone, and certain prominent colours, notably a sullen vermillion and a cold blue prevalent in the shadows, characterised as harsh. Remarkably, nearly 50% of de Hooch&#x27;s works date to the last 15 years of his activity, likely to compensate for lower compensation in the wake of the Rampjaar. Additionally, these works are described as appearing lifeless and cumbersome in outline, with a perceived falseness in their structural composition. An anonymous writer in The Connoisseur quoted remarks on late de Hooch, writing, &quot;[He] sacrifices his individuality to the taste of the time.&quot;

Upon the acquisition of &quot;A Musical Party in a Courtyard&quot; by the National Gallery, London in 1916, a debate was provoked in the House of Commons, and the Gallery&#x27;s Board of Trustees was censored. Writers for The Connoisseur and The Burlington Magazine expressed strong criticism of the artwork, describing the purchase as &quot;an act of folly on the part of the Trustees&quot; and declaring, &quot;Not to mince matters, it is a poor picture, a work of the painter&#x27;s late and bad period,&quot; respectively.

== Legacy ==
Pieter de Hooch&#x27;s influence persisted under the misnomer of the &quot;De Hooch School.&quot; Although there are no records of him having formal students, his work resonated with numerous artists, including van der Burgh and Pieter Janssens Elinga, the latter of whom likely based his painting Woman with a Pearl Necklace on de Hooch&#x27;s style, with many of his other works reflecting de Hooch&#x27;s Delft period. Emmanuel de Witte is also said to have been influenced by his younger colleague.

The artistic relationship between de Hooch and Ludolf de Jongh remains speculative, as de Jongh was a generation older than de Hooch. Nevertheless, it seems they had a mutual influence on each other. While de Jongh drew inspiration from de Hooch&#x27;s later depictions of courtyards and gardens, de Hooch may have been inspired by de Jongh in developing the &quot;Koortegardjes&quot; genre. Some have theorised a triangular artistic relationship between de Hooch, de Jongh, and Jacob Ochtervelt, all native Rotterdammers, evidenced by their distinctive approaches to soldier paintings.

De Hooch&#x27;s legacy enjoyed a resurgence in the 18th century, as admiration for his work grew. Cornelis Troost, for instance, owned one of his paintings and created portraits in line with de Hooch&#x27;s Delft period style. Artists such as Abraham Van Strij, Jan Ekels, and Wybrand Hendrick also drew inspiration from this period. Numerous 18th-century drawings after de Hooch&#x27;s works exist, created by artists like Frans Decker, Cornelis van Noorde, Aart Schouman, Hermanus Numan, and Reinier Vinkeles. His legacy continued to thrive into the 19th century with the formalisation of art evaluation methods, as critic Théophile Thoré-Bürger praised de Hooch in his &quot;Salon&quot; reviews. This led artists like Jean-François Millet to take a profound interest in his work. As a result, the value of de Hooch&#x27;s paintings soared, and some works by other Dutch Golden Age artists, such as Vermeer&#x27;s The Art of Painting, were falsely attributed to de Hooch in order to increase their market price. Marcel Proust also admired de Hooch&#x27;s interiors, referencing them in Swann&#x27;s Way to evoke the protagonist&#x27;s feelings of love. During the 20th century, several works thought to be de Hooch originals were revealed as forgeries, after an unfinished &quot;de Hooch&quot; painting was discovered in Han van Meegeren&#x27;s studio in 1945.

Art historian Peter C. Sutton argues that de Hooch&#x27;s later works are largely responsible for the diminished appreciation of his art, advocating that his body of work should be judged without the bias of his weaker, later canvases.

<doc id="583829" wikidata="Q3371682" url="?curid=583829" title="Paul Lennon">
<text>Paul Anthony Lennon (born 8 October 1955) is a Labor Party politician. He was Premier of Tasmania from 21 March 2004 until his resignation on 26 May 2008. He was member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly for the seat of Franklin from 1990 until officially resigning on 27 May 2008. He left office abruptly after his preferred premier rating fell to 17%, largely as a result of perceptions of corruption in his government&#x27;s fast-tracked approval of the Gunns Bell Bay Pulp Mill proposal, which had effectively bypassed normal planning procedure.

==Early life==
Born in Hobart, Lennon attended St Virgil&#x27;s College (a Catholic school), then worked as a storeman and clerk before becoming an organiser with the Storemen and Packers Union in 1978. Two years later, he was made 
Tasmanian State Secretary of the Storeman and Packers Union, and from 1982 he was Senior Vice President of the national union. In 1984 Lennon became Secretary of the Tasmanian Trades &amp; Labor Council, and also a member of the Executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions.

Lennon first ran for parliament at the 1989 state election, but failed to obtain a seat. He was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly in 1990 on a recount of votes following the resignation of Ken Wriedt (who had been State ALP Leader 1982–1986) and immediately became Deputy Leader of the Labor Party. He was Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations, Workplace Standards, Workers&#x27; Compensation, Public Sector Management, Forests, Mines, Racing and Gaming, and Leader of Opposition Business in the House of Assembly.

==Jim Bacon government==
On the election of a Labor government under Jim Bacon in 1998, Lennon became Deputy Premier, Minister for Infrastructure, Energy and Resources and Minister for Racing and Gaming. Following the re-election of the government in 2002, he became Minister for Economic Development, Energy and Resources, and Minister for Racing and Sport and Recreation.

==Premier of Tasmania==
In February 2004 Bacon was diagnosed with lung cancer and stood down as Premier to begin treatment. Lennon was Acting Premier until 21 March, when Bacon resigned and Lennon was sworn in as Tasmania&#x27;s 42nd Premier. He was also Treasurer until 2006 when he was succeeded by Michael Aird.

For years Lennon and Bacon were close friends as well as colleagues. Lennon was emotional as he formally assumed the premiership, with Bacon looking on. &quot;It&#x27;s hard to describe how you feel when someone who has been that close to you also happens to be your boss&quot;, Lennon subsequently told an interviewer: &quot;It was a very tough time. A very tough time indeed.&quot;

Lennon is known as an active proponent of Tasmania&#x27;s forestry industry, which is a partnership between its investors, managers, and workers. This attitude has made him very unpopular with the Greens, numerous conservation groups and others on the left. He represents a long tradition of conservative, pro-business Labor leadership in Tasmania, as represented in the 1970s by Eric Reece and in the 1980s by Harry Holgate. Both Lennon&#x27;s Labor government and the State Opposition were much censured for their close ties with the logging company Gunns Limited, not least over the drafting of new legislation.

In January 2006, Lennon faced criticism in the media over allegations of impropriety when it was revealed that he had received an upgrade from a A$200 per night room in the Crown Casino to a six-star suite worth up to A$4000 per night, complete with a private butler. The Crown Casino is owned by the Packer family&#x27;s Publishing and Broadcasting Limited, which also owns a 50% stake in Betfair, the company to which Lennon&#x27;s government days later awarded a A$700 million internet gaming licence.

In the 2006 state election Lennon successfully led the Labor party to a majority government. This happened in defiance of many pre-election media analyses, which predicted that the ALP would either lose office outright or be forced into a coalition.

==Allegations of corruption and downfall==
In 2006, allegations of corruption involving Mr Lennon reached fever pitch, with numerous news outlets detailing instances of perceived graft and corruption. Among these were allegations surrounding the renovation of Mr Lennon&#x27;s home by Gunns&#x27; subsidiary Hinman Wright and Manser. Mr Lennon refused to fully disclose the amount paid for the services provided by Hinman Wright and Manser, a large-scale civil construction firm not traditionally associated with residential home renovations. While no impropriety was officially found or prosecuted, the fact the renovations happened in such close proximity of time with Gunns negotiations with the Tasmanian Government in relation to a $2 billion Pulp Mill, aroused serious public suspicions.

On 26 May 2008, following an opinion poll which showed his preferred premier rating at 17 per cent, Lennon resigned as Premier of Tasmania. The Deputy Premier, David Bartlett, received his commission at Government House as the 43rd Tasmanian Premier shortly thereafter. He resigned from his seat of Franklin the following day. He had been the longest serving member for the seat of Franklin.

On 10 June 2008, the Tasmanian Electoral Commission announced that former school principal and taxi driver Ross Butler would replace Lennon in parliament, following a recount of preferences made at the previous election.

==Family==
Lennon is married to Margaret and has two children.

<text>A safety razor is a shaving implement with a protective device positioned between the edge of the blade and the skin. The initial purpose of these protective devices was to reduce the level of skill needed for injury-free shaving, thereby reducing the reliance on professional barbers.

Protective devices for razors have existed since at least the 1700s: a circa 1762 invention by French cutler Jean-Jacques Perret added a protective guard to a regular straight razor. The first known occurrence of the term &quot;safety razor&quot; is found in a patent from 1880 for a razor in the basic contemporary configuration with a handle in which a removable blade is placed (although this form predated the patent).

Safety razors were popularized in the 1900s by King Camp Gillette&#x27;s invention, the double-edge safety razor. While other safety razors of the time used blades that required stropping before use and after a time had to be honed by a cutler, Gillette&#x27;s razor used a disposable blade with two sharpened edges. Gillette&#x27;s invention became the predominant style of razor during and after the First World War, when the U.S. Army began issuing Gillette shaving kits to its servicemen.

Since their introduction in the 1970s, cartridge razors and disposable razors – where the blades are embedded in plastic – have become the predominant types of razors. In 2010, Procter &amp; Gamble stated that almost a billion men were shaving with double-edge razors.

== History ==
=== Early designs ===
The first step towards a safer-to-use razor was the guard razor – also called a straight safety razor – which added a protective guard to a regular straight razor. The first such razor was most likely invented by French cutler Jean-Jacques Perret circa 1762. The invention was inspired by the joiner&#x27;s plane and was essentially a straight razor with its blade surrounded by a wooden sleeve. The earliest razor guards had comb-like teeth and could only be attached to one side of a razor; a reversible guard was one of the first improvements made to guard razors.

The basic form of a razor, &quot;the cutting blade of which is at right angles with the handle, and resembles somewhat the form of a common hoe&quot;, was first described in a patent application in 1847 by William S. Henson. This also covered a &quot;comb tooth guard or protector&quot; which could be attached both to the hoe form and to a conventional straight razor.

The first attested use of the term &quot;safety razor&quot; is in a patent application for &quot;new and useful improvements in Safety-Razors&quot;, filed in May 1880 by Frederic and Otto Kampfe of Brooklyn, New York, and issued the following month. This differed from the Henson design in distancing the blade from the handle by interposing &quot;a hollow metallic blade-holder having a preferably removable handle and a flat plate in front, to which the blade is attached by clips and a pivoted catch, said plate having bars or teeth at its lower edge, and the lower plate having an opening, for the purpose set forth&quot;, which is to &quot;insure a smooth bearing for the plate upon the skin, while the teeth or bars will yield sufficiently to allow the razor to sever the hair without danger of cutting the skin.&quot; The Kampfe Brothers produced razors under their own name following the 1880 patent and improved the design in a series of subsequent patents. These models were manufactured under the &quot;Star Safety Razor&quot; brand.

A third pivotal innovation was a safety razor using a disposable double-edge blade for which King Camp Gillette submitted a patent application in 1901 and was granted in 1904. The Gillette Safety Razor Company was awarded a contract to supply the American troops in World War I with double-edge safety razors as part of their standard field kits (delivering a total of 3.5 million razors and 32 million blades for them). The returning soldiers were permitted to keep that part of their equipment and therefore retained their new shaving habits. The subsequent consumer demand for replacement blades put the shaving industry on course toward its present form with Gillette as a dominant force. Prior to the introduction of the disposable blade, users of safety razors still needed to strop and hone the edges of their blades. These are not trivial skills (honing frequently being left to a professional) and remained a barrier to the ubiquitous adopting of the &quot;be your own barber&quot; ideal.

=== Single-edge razors ===
The first safety razors used a single-edge blade that was essentially a long segment of a straight razor. A flat blade that could be used alternately with this &quot;wedge&quot; was first illustrated in a patent issued in 1878, serving as a close prototype for the single-edge blade in its present form. New single-edge razors were developed and used side by side with double-edge razors for decades. The largest manufacturers were the American Safety Razor Company with its &quot;Ever-Ready&quot; series, and the Gem Cutlery Company with its &quot;Gem&quot; models. Although these brands of single-edge razors are no longer in production, they are readily available in antique trade, and compatible modern designs are being made. Blades for them are still being manufactured both for shaving and technical purposes.

A second popular single-edge design is the &quot;Injector&quot; razor developed and placed on the market by Schick Razors in the 1920s. This uses narrow blades stored in an injector device with which they are inserted directly into the razor, so that the user never needs to handle the blade. The injector blade was the first to depart from the rectangular dimensions shared by the wedge, standard single-edge, and double-edge blades. The injector, itself, was also the first device intended to reduce the risk of injury from handling blades. The Gillette blade dispenser released in 1947 had the same purpose. The narrow injector blade, as well as the form of the injector razor, also strongly influenced the corresponding details of the subsequently developed cartridge razors. Both injector blades and injector safety razors are still available on the market, from antique stock as well as modern manufacture. The injector blades have also inspired a variety of specialised blades for professional barber use, some of which have been re-adopted for shaving by modern designs.

Until the 1960s, razor blades were made of carbon steel. These were extremely prone to rusting and forced users to change blades frequently. In 1962, the British company Wilkinson Sword began to sell blades made of stainless steel, whose edge did not corrode nearly so quickly and could be used far longer. Wilkinson quickly captured U.S., British and European markets. As a result, American Safety Razor, Gillette and Schick were driven to produce stainless steel blades to compete. Today, almost all razor blades are stainless steel, although carbon steel blades remain in limited production for lower income markets. Because Gillette held a patent on stainless blades but had not acted on it, the company was accused of exploiting customers by forcing them to buy the rust-prone blade.

The risk of injury from handling razor blades was further reduced in 1970 when Wilkinson released its &quot;Bonded Shaving System&quot;, which embedded a single blade in a disposable polymer plastic cartridge. A flurry of competing models soon followed with everything from one to six blades, with many cartridge blade razors also having disposable handles. Cartridge blade razors are sometimes considered to be a generic category of their own and not a variety of safety razor. The similarities between single-edge cartridge blade razors and the classic injector razor do, however, provide equal justification for treating both categories contiguously.

In 1974, Bic introduced the disposable razor. Instead of being a razor with a disposable blade, the entire razor was manufactured to be disposable. Gillette&#x27;s response was the Good News disposable razor which was launched on the US market in 1976 before the Bic disposable was made available on that market. Shortly thereafter, Gillette modified the Good News construction to add an aloe strip above the razor, resulting in the Good News Plus. The purported benefit of the aloe strip is to ease any discomfort felt on the face while shaving.

In direct response to Wilkinson&#x27;s Bonded cartridge, during the following year Gillette introduced the twin-blade Trac II. They claimed that research showed the tandem action of the two blades to give a closer shave than a single blade, because of a &quot;hysteresis&quot; effect. In addition to the cutting action of the first blade, it is also supposed to pull the hair out of the follicle into which it does not fully retract before the second blade cuts it further. The extent to which this is of practical consequence has, however, been questioned.

=== Recent changes ===
Gillette introduced the first triple-blade cartridge razor, the Mach3, in 1998, and later upgraded the Sensor cartridge to the Sensor3 by adding a third blade. Schick/Wilkinson responded to the Mach3 with the Quattro, the first four-blade cartridge razor. These innovations are marketed with the message that they help consumers achieve the best shave as easily as possible. Another impetus for the sale of multiple-blade cartridges is that they have high profit margins. With manufacturers frequently updating their shaving systems, consumers can become locked into buying their proprietary cartridges, for as long as the manufacturer continues to make them. Subsequent to introducing the higher-priced Mach3 in 1998, Gillette&#x27;s blade sales realized a 50% increase, and profits increased in an otherwise mature market.

The marketing of increasing numbers of blades in a cartridge has been parodied since the 1970s. The debut episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1975 included a parody advertisement for the Triple Trac Razor, shortly after the first two-blade cartridge for men&#x27;s razors was advertised. &quot;Mad&quot; magazine announced the &quot;Trac 76&quot;, arranged as a chain of cartridges with a handle on each end. In the early 1990s, the (Australian) Late Show skitted a &quot;Gillette 3000&quot; with 16 blades and 75 lubricating strips as arrived at by working in conjunction with the help of NASA scientists - &quot;The first blade distracts the hair...&quot;. The 16 January 1999 episode of &quot;Mad TV&quot; ran a parody commercial advertising the &quot;Spishak Mach 20&quot; with blades that variously &quot;cut(s) away that pesky second layer of skin&quot; and &quot;gently smooth(s) out the jawbone&quot; culminating in a blade that &quot;destroys the part of the brain responsible for hair growth.&quot; In 2004, a satirical article in &quot;The Onion&quot; entitled &quot;Fuck Everything, We&#x27;re Doing Five Blades&quot; predicted the release of five-blade cartridges, two years before their commercial introduction. South Korean manufacturer Dorco released their own six-blade cartridge in 2012, and later released a seven-blade cartridge.

Gillette has also produced powered variants of the Mach3 (M3Power, M3Power Nitro) and Fusion (Fusion Power and Fusion Power Phantom) razors. These razors accept a single AAA battery which is used to produce vibration in the razor; this action was purported to raise hair up and away from the skin prior to being cut. These claims were ruled in an American court as &quot;unsubstantiated and inaccurate&quot;.

== Design ==
Safety razors originally had an edge protected by a comb patterned on various types of protective guards that had been affixed to open-blade straight razors during the preceding decades.

== Lifespan ==
To maintain their cutting action, razor blades can be stropped using an old strip of denim. Twinplex also sold a blade stropper which was used to extend the life of vintage carbon steel blades. 

Safety razor blades are usually made of razor steel which is a low chromium stainless steel which can be made extremely sharp, but corrodes relatively easily. Safety razor blade life may be extended by drying the blades after use. Salts from human skin also tend to corrode the blades, but washing and carefully drying them can greatly extend their life.

Disposable safety razor blades can be sharpened using various methods. There are commercial devices intended for this duty (Razormate, RazorPit, Blade Buddy, etc.).

== Variants ==

=== Double-edged razors ===
Double-edge (DE) safety razors remain a popular alternative to proprietary cartridge razors, and usually offer significantly lower total cost of ownership since they are not marketed under the &quot;razor and blades business model&quot;. Double-edge razors are still designed and produced in many countries, and in 2010, Procter &amp; Gamble estimated that almost a billion men were shaving with double-edge razors. Better known manufacturers include Edwin Jagger, Feather, iKon, Lord, Mühle, Merkur, and Weishi, with several of them producing razors that are marketed under other brands. Often different models of razors within a brand share the same razor-head designs, differing primarily in the color, length, texture, material(s), and weight of the handles. Three-piece razors generally have interchangeable handles, and some companies specialize in manufacturing custom or high-end replacement handles. The butterfly safety razor utilizes a twist-to-open mechanism head to make changing the blade easy and convenient. Variations in razor head designs include straight safety bar (SB), open comb (OC)(toothed) bar, adjustable razors, and slant bar razors. The slant bar was a common design in Germany in which the blade is slightly angled and curved along its length to make for a slicing action and a more rigid cutting edge.

A primary functional difference between double-edge razors and modern cartridge razors is that DE razor heads come in a wide array of aggression levels (where aggression is commonly defined as being less protection from the blade).

<text>USS &quot;Essex&quot; (LHD-2) is a Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) in service with the United States Navy. The amphibious assault ship was built at what is now Huntington Ingalls Industries in Pascagoula, Mississippi. She was launched 23 February 1991 and commissioned on 17 October 1992 while moored at Naval Air Station (NAS) North Island. She is the fifth ship named for Essex County, Massachusetts. &quot;Essex&quot; served as the command ship for Expeditionary Strike Group Seven until replaced by on 23 April 2012.

==History==

===1990s===
====1993====
&quot;Essex&quot; conducted a training program during the spring of 1993, and from 18 August until 23 November, was undergoing upgrades, during Post Shakedown Availability, in Long Beach harbor.

====1994====
&quot;Essex&quot;″s maiden deployment was in October 1994. With the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) (Special Operations Capable (SOC)) embarked. In January 1995, she left the Persian Gulf to prepare for the complex task of covering the withdrawal of United Nations multinational force from Somalia in Operation United Shield. Under fire from advancing Somalis, every member of the force was successfully extracted. &quot;Essex&quot; returned to San Diego on 25 April 1995.

====1996====
After a short maintenance period, &quot;Essex&quot; embarked on a vigorous workup cycle, culminating in her participation in Rim of the Pacific Exercise (RIMPAC), a biennial, seven-nation naval exercise. On 10 October 1996, she embarked on her second Western Pacific deployment with the 11th MEU (SOC) and Amphibious Squadron Five. During the deployment, &quot;Essex&quot; participated in multinational exercises with Qatar, Oman, and Kuwait, as well as Exercise Tandem Thrust 1997, an American-Australian combined exercise with over 28,000 troops, 250 aircraft, and 40 ships participating.

====1997====
On her return in April 1997, &quot;Essex&quot; went into a short maintenance period, followed by a shortened workup cycle. She then departed for her third Western Pacific, Indian Ocean, and the Persian Gulf deployment on 21 June 1998 with the 15th MEU (SOC) and Amphibious Squadron Five. &quot;Essex&quot; participated in Exercises Sea Soldier and Red Reef and Military SALT and Non-Combatant Evacuation Operations with the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait. Additionally, &quot;Essex&quot; supported Operation Southern Watch, enforcing the UN-mandated no-fly zone over southern Iraq.

===2000s===
====2000====
On 26 July 2000, after the successful completion of the largest crew swap in U.S. Navy history, &quot;Essex&quot; replaced and inherited the distinctive role as the Navy&#x27;s only permanently forward-deployed amphibious assault ship in United States Fleet Activities Sasebo, Japan.

====2003====
While in her forward-deployed role, &quot;Essex&quot; has participated in various humanitarian assistance/disaster relief operations, including East Timor in October and November 2003 and Foal Eagle in Korea in 2003.

====2004====
In 2004, &quot;Essex&quot; carried the 31st MEU to Kuwait, along with and . &quot;Essex&quot; stayed in the Persian Gulf while the 31st MEU and the combat element 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines went into Iraq for the Battle of Fallujah. During that time, &quot;Essex&quot; went to aid in Operation Unified Assistance in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, after the December 2004 tsunami. She then returned to the Persian Gulf to embark the 31st MEU SOC and the combat element despite being in need of maintenance. After picking up the MEU and the Combat Element, the three ships returned to Okinawa, Japan. The ship had been at sea for a total of eight months.

====2008====
During the 2008 Myanmar Cyclone Nargis crisis and the subsequent Operation Caring Response aid mission, &quot;Essex&quot; and her amphibious group (made up of &quot;Juneau&quot;, &quot;Harpers Ferry&quot;, and the destroyer ) stood by off Burma from 13 May to 5 June, waiting for the Myanmar junta government to permit US aid to its citizens. In early June, with permission still not forthcoming, it was decided to put the group back on its scheduled operations.

====2009====
Early in 2009, &quot;Essex&quot; completed exercise Cobra Gold, which had been cut short the previous year. &quot;Essex&quot; followed this with exercise Balikatan with the Republic of the Philippines. &quot;Essex&quot; then got underway in support of exercise Talisman Saber 2009 and conducted various well deck and flight deck evolutions supporting this joint bilateral exercise between the U.S. and Australian military forces.

===2010s===
====2010====
In February, at the conclusion of exercise Cobra Gold 2010, &quot;Essex&quot; visited Laem Chabang in Thailand.

From 21–23 October, the &quot;Essex&quot; Expeditionary Strike Group provided humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to the Philippines after the Super Typhoon Juan (international name Megi) caused extensive destruction to municipalities along the eastern coast of the Province of Isabela. The crew was awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal.

====2011====
At the request for assistance from the Japanese government, the Navy directed &quot;Essex&quot; to be deployed off the northeastern coast of Honshu after the massive 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The ship was involved in relief activities in the Sea of Japan off Akita Prefecture. Helicopters from the ship helped deliver relief supplies to quake and tsunami survivors along the northeast coast of Tohoku.

The ship departed Sasebo in September 2011 to patrol the western Pacific. Accompanying the ship were the landing ships and .

In November, a Petty Officer 1st Class was fatally injured aboard &quot;Essex&quot; during a weapons systems test while the ship was off the coast of Bali. A command report released in early 2012 cited &quot;breakdown of safety procedures, protocol violations and gross negligence&quot;.

====2012====
While &quot;Essex&quot; was scheduled to depart for Cobra Gold 2012, an annual exercise with Thailand, her participation was canceled due to maintenance issues.

It was announced in January 2012 that &quot;Essex&quot; would be returning to her former home port of San Diego, California, after 11 years of forward deployment in Japan. Before departing for San Diego, the &quot;Essex&quot; crew will perform a hull swap with the crew of fellow &quot;Wasp&quot;-class sister-ship, &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;, to continue their deployment to Sasebo, but aboard the newly arrived ship.

=====Collision with USNS &quot;Yukon&quot;=====
On 16 May 2012, &quot;Essex&quot; suffered an apparent steering failure while approaching for an underway replenishment. The two ships collided, causing damage to both ships. There were no injuries, and no loss of fuel was reported. Both ships were able to continue to San Diego under their own power. On 19 June 2012 the Navy announced that the ship&#x27;s commander, Captain Chuck Litchfield, had been relieved of command due to &quot;loss of confidence in his ability to command.&quot;

An investigation determined that the collision was avoidable and caused by improper supervision by Litchfield over his junior bridge crew. Although &quot;Essex&quot;″s steering had failed, the investigation determined that better leadership by Litchfield could have prevented the collision. The investigation recommended administrative action against &quot;Essex&quot;″s executive officer, Officer Of the Deck (OOD), conning officer, and helm safety officer.

&quot;Essex&quot; entered Naval Base San Diego for an 18-month maintenance and upgrade on 18 September 2012.

====2014====
After two years of dry-dock and pier side maintenance, &quot;Essex&quot; executed an on-time underway to conduct sea trials in April 2014. &quot;Essex&quot; also received an aviation certification in May 2014 by showing proficiency in the launching, landing, and refueling of various helicopters and MV-22 Ospreys on the flight deck. &quot;Essex&quot; was one of the three US Navy ships, the other two being and , in which the US Navy installed metal 3D printers.

====2015====

On 30 November 2015, &quot;Essex&quot; and her Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), embarked with the 15th MEU and entered the United States Third Fleet Area of Operations (AO), returning from a deployment that spread across the 5th, 6th and 7th AOs.

====2017====
On 7–9 October &quot;Essex&quot; was in San Francisco, and along with , was open to visitors as part of the &quot;San Francisco Fleet Week&quot; event.

====2018====
In September 2018 the &quot;Essex&quot; ARG with the F-35B equipped Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 211 (VMFA-211) aboard deployed to the United States Central Command AO. On 27 September, it was reported that the first-ever F-35B airstrike was launched from &quot;Essex&quot; against a fixed Taliban target.

===2020 COVID-19 pandemic===

The coronavirus pandemic was reported to have spread to the crew of &quot;Essex&quot; when its first case was reported on 17 March. The sailor had been attending a course at Naval Base San Diego since 6 February 2020 when the test returned positive on 14 March. The student subsequently self-isolated at home.

===2022===
On 27-30 May, &quot;Essex&quot; and were open to the public as a part of Los Angeles Fleet Week 2022, in San Pedro, California.

&quot;Essex&quot; participated in RIMPAC 2022.

===2023===

On 2 August, a machinist’s mate was arrested for espionage for passing information about the &quot;Essex&quot;, the ship he was stationed on, and others, to a Chinese agent.

<doc id="583844" wikidata="Q1327919" url="?curid=583844" title="Wallace Collection">
<text>The Wallace Collection is a museum in London occupying Hertford House in Manchester Square, the former townhouse of the Seymour family, Marquesses of Hertford. It is named after Sir Richard Wallace, who built the extensive collection, along with the Marquesses of Hertford, in the 18th and 19th centuries. The collection features fine and decorative arts from the 15th to the 19th centuries with important holdings of French 18th-century paintings, furniture, arms and armour, porcelain and Old Master paintings arranged into 25 galleries. It is open to the public and entry is free.

It was established in 1897 from the private collection mainly created by Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford (1800–1870), who left both it and the house to his illegitimate son Sir Richard Wallace (1818–1890), whose widow Julie Amelie Charlotte Castelnau bequeathed the entire collection to the nation. The collection opened to permanent public view in 1900 in Hertford House, and remains there to this day. A condition of the bequest was that no object should ever leave the collection, even for loan exhibitions. However in September 2019, the board of trustees announced that they had obtained an order from the Charity Commission for England &amp; Wales which allowed them to enter into temporary loan agreements for the first time.

The United Kingdom is particularly rich in the works of the &quot;ancien régime&quot;, purchased by wealthy families during the revolutionary sales, held in France after the end of the French Revolution. The Wallace Collection, Waddesdon Manor and the Royal Collection, all three located in the United Kingdom, are some of the largest, most important collections of French 18th-century decorative arts in the world, rivalled only by the Musée du Louvre, Château de Versailles and Mobilier National in France. The Wallace Collection is a non-departmental public body and the current director is Xavier Bray.

==History==
The Wallace Collection is a museum which displays works of art collected in the 18th and 19th centuries by five generations of a British aristocratic family – the first four Marquesses of Hertford and Sir Richard Wallace, the illegitimate son of the 4th Marquess. In the 19th century, the Marquesses of Hertford were one of the wealthiest families in Europe. They owned large properties in England, Wales and Ireland, and increased their wealth through successful marriages. Politically of lesser importance, the 3rd and 4th Marquess and Sir Richard Wallace became leading art collectors of their time.

The Wallace Collection, comprising about 5,500 works of art, was bequeathed to the British nation by Lady Wallace in 1897. The state then decided to buy Hertford House to display the collection and it was opened as a museum in 1900. As a museum the Wallace Collection&#x27;s main strength is 18th-century French art: paintings, furniture, porcelain, sculpture and gold snuffboxes and 16th- to 19th-century paintings by such as Titian, Van Dyck, Rembrandt, Hals, Velázquez, Gainsborough and Delacroix, a collection of arms and armour and medieval and Renaissance objects including Limoges enamels, maiolica, glass and bronzes. Paintings, furniture and porcelain are displayed together in the manner of private collections of the 19th century.

==Building==
===Hertford House, Cannon Row===
The 16th- and 17th-century Hertford House was the London townhouse of Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford (1539–1621) and was in a different location: Cannon Row in Westminster. His father Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (executed 1552), brother of Queen Jane Seymour, had started building the palatial Somerset House on the Strand as his townhouse, but did not live to see its completion. 

===Hertford House, Manchester Square===
The present House in Manchester Square was the townhouse of a later junior branch of the family. It was built in 1776 by George Montagu, 4th Duke of Manchester who owned and developed the surrounding estate. It dominates the north side of the Square, where it occupies an island site, and was originally named &quot;Manchester House&quot;. After being used as the Spanish Embassy 1791–1795 (evidenced by &quot;Spanish Place&quot; the street to the east of the building) the lease was acquired in 1797 by Francis Ingram-Seymour-Conway, 2nd Marquess of Hertford (1743–1822), who in 1814 held there the Allied Sovereigns&#x27; Ball after the first defeat of Napoleon in 1814. Francis Seymour-Conway, 3rd Marquess of Hertford (1777–1842), the family&#x27;s first great art collector, lived mainly at his other London residences, Dorchester House in Mayfair and St Dunstan’s Villa in Regents Park, now the site of the residence of the US Ambassador. Between 1836-51 Hertford House was let for use as the French Embassy. His son Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford (1800–1870), who expanded his father&#x27;s art collection, lived most of his life in Paris, and rarely visited Hertford House, used &quot;largely as a store for his ever-expanding art collection&quot;. He is said never to have visited his principal English country seat of Ragley Hall in Warwickshire. The 4th Marquess died in 1870, aged 70 in Paris, unmarried and without legitimate issue, and his titles and entailed estates, including the lease of Hertford House, passed to his distant cousin Francis Seymour, 5th Marquess of Hertford (1812–1884).

The 4th Marquess&#x27;s illegitimate son and heir of his unentailed estate, Sir Richard Wallace, 1st Baronet (1818–1890), inherited his art collection, French and Irish estates, and re-purchased Sudbourne Hall in Suffolk and, in 1871, the lease of Hertford House from the 5th Marquess, and returned from Paris with much of the art collection to take up residence in England, following the unstable political climate in France following the Prussian Siege of Paris (1870–1871). Wallace in turn expanded the art collection, adding medieval and Renaissance objects and European arms and armour.

Between 1872–1882 the house was much altered by Sir Richard Wallace, who added a rear extension to house his art collection with a smoking room lined with Minton tiles in Turkish style. Under the architect Thomas Ambler a new front portico was added in the form of a porte-cochère, with large Doric pilasters, storeys were added to both wings and the stables and coach house were converted to galleries by the addition of top-lit roofs. The whole building was given a red brick facade and the windows were altered. Wallace bequeathed all his assets to his wife, who in turn, and most probably according to his wishes, bequeathed the main part of her husband&#x27;s art collection to the nation, thus forming the &quot;Wallace Collection&quot;, the rest, including the French properties and Hertford House, going to the couple&#x27;s secretary Sir John Murray Scott, 1st Baronet. Scott sold the lease of Hertford House to the UK Government, as a suitable home for the Wallace Collection, after which he was rewarded with a baronetcy, and the Government acquired the freehold from the Portman Estate. Hertford House first opened as a museum on 22 June 1900.

In 2000, the inner courtyard was given a glass roof and a restaurant was opened named &quot;Cafe Bagatelle&quot; after the Château de Bagatelle in Paris purchased in 1835 by Francis Seymour-Conway, 3rd Marquess of Hertford, later part of Scott&#x27;s inheritance. The museum display does not aim to reconstruct the state of the house when Sir Richard and Lady Wallace lived here.

==Interior==
===Ground Floor===
====Hall====
The Entrance Hall contains marble busts of the three principal founders of the Wallace Collection: Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford (1800–1870), his son, Sir Richard Wallace (1818–1890) and in the lobby, Lady Wallace, who bequeathed the contents of Hertford House to the British nation on her death in 1897. The room has retained the aspect it had in Sir Richard Wallace&#x27;s day more than any other room in the building.

====Front State Room====
&quot;Displays: Portraits and Porcelain&quot;

This room reveals the opulence of the London town house in the 1870s and sets the scene for visitors to the Wallace Collection. The State Rooms were the grandest rooms in the house, in which the most important visitors were received. When it was the home of Sir Richard and Lady Wallace, visitors to Hertford House first entered the Front State Room, then, as now, hung with portraits. Two items of the modern furniture seen in the room in 1890 were not part of the collection gifted by Lady Wallace and are no longer present, but the mounted porcelain displayed on the cabinets and the chandelier, made by Jean-Jacques Caffiéri in 1571, have been returned to the room.

====Back State Room====
&quot;Displays: The Rococo at the time of Louis XV and Madame de Pompadour&quot;

The Back State Room is today dedicated to the patronage of King Louis XV (1715–1774) and his mistress, Madame de Pompadour. It displays some of the prominent examples in the Wallace Collection of art in the rococo style. Sir Richard Wallace used the Back State Room to entertain guests at Hertford House. During his lifetime it had wooden boiserie panelling on the wall; the great chandelier, by Jacques Caffiéri, dating from 1751, remains in the room.

====Dining Room====

&quot;Displays: Eighteenth-century still lifes and portraits&quot;

The room contains masterworks of French 18th-century portraiture by Nattier and Houdon and two oil sketches by Jean François de Troy, for decoration of Louis XV&#x27;s dining room in Fontainebleau, shown to the king for approval.

====Billiard Room====

&quot;Displays: The Decorative Arts under Louis XIV&quot;

====Breakfast Room====
&quot;Visitor Reception and Cloakroom&quot;

This room was formerly Sir Richard and Lady Wallace&#x27;s breakfast room. As this photograph from c. 1890 shows, it contained a large cabinet filled with Sèvres porcelain dinner wares, probably more for use than decoration, and sixteen Dutch pictures. The French chimneypiece in this room was made in the mid-18th century and installed in this room when the house was modified for Sir Richard and Lady Wallace.

====Housekeeper&#x27;s Room====
&quot;Wallace Collection Shop&quot;

This room was occupied during Sir Richard and Lady Wallace&#x27;s lifetime by the family&#x27;s housekeeper. Lady Wallace&#x27;s housekeeper was Mrs Jane Buckley, a Londoner by birth. There were over thirty servants, including housemaids, kitchen maids, a lady&#x27;s maid, a butler, footmen, a valet, coachmen, a groom and stable lads.

====Oriental Armoury====

&quot;Displays: East European, Turkish and Indo-Persian Arms, Armour and Works of Arts&quot;

The Oriental arms and armour in the Wallace Collection were largely collected by the 4th Marquess of Hertford in the 1860s, the last decade of his life. Like many of his contemporaries, Sir Richard Wallace used this material to bring Oriental exoticism, as it was then considered, into his fashionable London house. The Oriental Armoury was displayed on the first floor of Hertford House. Trophies of arms and armour from India, the Middle East, the lands of the old Ottoman Empire, and the Far East, patterned the walls of the Oriental Armoury, whilst the ceiling was decorated with a pattern of gold stars on a deep blue background.

====European Armoury I====
&quot;Displays: Medieval and Renaissance Arms and Armour (tenth to sixteenth centuries)&quot;

Sir Richard Wallace acquired most of his European armour in 1871, when he bought the collections of the comte Alfred Emilien de Nieuwekerke, Minister of Fine Arts to Napoleon III and director of the Louvre, as well as the finest parts of the collection of Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, a pioneering collector and scholar of arms and armour. The arms and armour collections are today recognised as among the finest in the world. During Sir Richard Wallace&#x27;s lifetime, this room formed part of the stables with the grooms&#x27; bedrooms on a mezzanine floor. Sir Richard&#x27;s European arms and armour were displayed in one large gallery, today&#x27;s West Gallery III, on the first floor, directly above European Armoury I.

====European Armoury II====

&quot;Displays: Renaissance Arms and Armour (fifteenth to seventeenth centuries)&quot;

The Wallace Collection contains some of the most spectacular Renaissance arms and armour in Britain. All of the richest and most powerful noblemen of the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries commissioned beautifully decorated weapons and armour, not just for war, but also for use in the awe-inspiring jousts, tournaments and festivals of the time. Fine arms and armour were considered works of art as much as warlike equipment. Displayed in this gallery are some of the finest examples of the armourer&#x27;s art, exquisite sculptures richly embellished with gold and silver. This space was formerly part of Sir Richard Wallace&#x27;s stables.

====European Armoury III====
&quot;Displays: Later Arms and Armour (sixteenth to nineteenth centuries)&quot;

The array of sporting guns, rifles and pistols in this room includes a large number of extravagantly decorated 16th- and early-17th-century wheel-lock firearms, together with an impressive group of magnificent civilian flint-lock guns of the Napoleonic era. Several of the weapons here were made for European rulers, including Louis XIII and Louis XIV of France and Tsar Nicholas I of Russia. It is a major collection of early firearms in the United Kingdom. This space was formerly part of Sir Richard Wallace&#x27;s coach house and stable yard.

====Sixteenth-Century Gallery====
&quot;Displays: The Collector&#x27;s Cabinet&quot;

The Sixteenth-Century Gallery houses works of art from the Medieval and Renaissance periods and a group of important Renaissance paintings. This part of the Wallace Collection was mainly assembled by Sir Richard who, like many 19th-century collectors, was fascinated by the art and history of Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance. The Sixteenth-Century Gallery comprised two smaller rooms during Sir Richard and Lady Wallace&#x27;s lifetime. The contemporary photograph shows how one room was arranged by Sir Richard as a cabinet of curiosities, with paintings and maiolica densely hung on the walls and smaller works of art kept in cases or inside Renaissance cabinets. The other room, known as the Canaletto Room, was used to display the collection of paintings by Canaletto.

====Smoking Room====
&quot;Displays: Medieval and Renaissance Works of Art&quot;

The Smoking Room exhibits paintings and works of art from the Medieval and Renaissance periods, including the greater part of Sir Richard Wallace&#x27;s collection of Italian Renaissance maiolica. Sir Richard Wallace would have invited his male guests to the Smoking Room after dinner, to discuss affairs of the day over an enjoyable pipe or cigar. The room had oriental interiors, with walls lined with Turkish-style tiles made by the Minton factory in Stoke-on-Trent, the floor laid with a patterned mosaic. A small section of this interior survives in the alcove at the north end of the room. This was not only a highly fashionable look for a late Victorian smoking room but also practical, ensuring the smell of smoke did not linger in any fabric furnishings.

===First Floor===
====Landing====
The Landing serves as the main orientation point on the first floor. It is hung with mythological and pastoral paintings by Boucher and is also perhaps the best place to admire the wrought iron work of the staircase balustrade, made in 1719 for the Royal bank in Paris. Hertford House was built in 1776–78 for the 4th Duke of Manchester. After a brief spell as the Spanish Embassy, it was bought by the 2nd Marquess of Hertford in 1797. He added the conservatory, in place of a Venetian window on the Landing and two first-floor rooms on each wing.

===Furniture===
The Wallace Collection holds one of the most important collections of French furniture in the UK, and ranks alongside the Musée du Louvre, the Royal Collection, Waddesdon Manor, the collections of the Duke of Buccleuch, the Getty Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art as one of the greatest and most celebrated in the world. Totalling more than five hundred pieces, the collection consists largely of 18th-century French furniture but also includes some significant pieces of 19th-century French furniture, as well as interesting Italian furniture and a few English and German pieces. The collection ranges from cabinet furniture, much of which is veneered with brass and turtleshell marquetry (commonly known as &quot;Boulle&quot; marquetry) or with wood marquetry, to seat furniture, clocks and barometers, gilt-bronze items including mounted porcelain and hardstones, mantelpieces, mirrors, boxes and pedestals. One highlight is the major collection of furniture attributed to André-Charles Boulle (1642–1732).

<text>An () is a type of informal Japanese bar that serves alcoholic drinks and snacks. are casual places for after-work drinking, similar to a pub, a Spanish tapas bar, or an American saloon or tavern.

== Etymology ==
The word entered the English language by 1987. It is a compound word consisting of (&quot;to stay&quot;) and (&quot;sake shop&quot;), indicating that originated from sake shops that allowed customers to sit on the premises to drink. are sometimes called (&#x27;red lantern&#x27;) in daily conversation, as such paper lanterns are traditionally found in front of them.

== History ==
Anecdotes and songs that appear in the show that -style establishments existed in Japan at the early 700s. There is a record dating to 733 when rice was collected as a brewing fee tax under the jurisdiction of the government office called . In the , written in 797, there is a record of King Ashihara who got drunk and was murdered in a tavern in 761.

The full-scale development of began around the Edo period (1603–1867). At liquor stores that used to sell alcohol by weight, people began to drink alcohol while standing. Gradually, some began using sake barrels as stools for their customers, and gradually began to offer simple snacks called . Historian Penelope Francks points to the development of the in Japan, especially in Edo and along main roads throughout the country, as one indicator of the growing popularity of sake as a consumer good by the late 1700s.

An in Tokyo made international news in 1962 when Robert F. Kennedy ate there during a meeting with Japanese labor leaders.

 and other small pubs or establishments are exempted from an indoor smoking ban that was passed by the National Diet in July 2018 and fully enforced since April 2020.

== Dining style ==

 are often likened to taverns or pubs, but there are a number of differences.

Depending on the , customers either sit on tatami mats and dine from low tables, as in the traditional Japanese style, or sit on chairs and dine from tables. Many offer a choice of both as well as seating by the bar. Some restaurants are also style, literally translated as &quot;drinking while standing&quot;.

Usually, customers are given an (wet towel) to clean their hands; the towels are cold in summer and hot in winter. Next, a tiny appetizer, called an in the Tokyo area or in the Osaka-Kobe area, is served. It is local custom and usually charged onto the bill in lieu of an entry fee.

The menu may be on the table, displayed on walls, or both. Picture menus are common in larger . Food and drink are ordered throughout the course of the session as desired. They are brought to the table, and the bill is added up at the end of the session. Unlike other Japanese styles of eating, food items are usually shared by everyone at the table, similar to Spanish tapas.

Common styles of dining in Japan are (&quot;all you can drink&quot;) and (&quot;all you can eat&quot;). For a set price per person, customers can continue ordering as much food and/or drink as they wish, usually with a time limit of two or three hours.

 dining can be intimidating to non-Japanese because of the wide variety of menu items and the slow pace. Food is normally ordered slowly over several courses rather than all at once. The kitchen will serve the food when it is ready, rather than in the formal courses of Western restaurants. Typically, a beer is ordered when one is sitting down before perusing the menu. Quickly prepared dishes such as or edamame are ordered first, followed with progressively more robust flavors such as or , finishing the meal with a rice or noodle dish to fill up.

== Typical menu items ==
 offer a wide variety of dishes. Items typically available are:

=== Alcoholic drinks ===
*Sake, a Japanese alcoholic beverage made by fermenting polished rice
*Beer ()
*Cocktails
**Sour mix ()
*Wine
*Whisky

Some establishments offer a bottle-keep service, allowing a patron to purchase an entire bottle of liquor (usually or whisky) and store the unfinished portion for a future visit.

=== Food ===

 food is usually more substantial than tapas or &quot;mezze&quot;. Many items are designed to be shared. Menu items may include:
*Edamameboiled and salted soybean pods
*various vegetables served with a sesame dressing
*bite-sized fried chicken
*grilled meat or vegetable skewers
*Salads
*Sashimislices of raw fish
*chicken wings
*Tofu
**deep-fried tofu in broth
**chilled silken tofu with toppings
*pickles
*grilled noodles
*grilled chicken skewers

Rice dishes such as and noodle dishes such as are sometimes eaten to conclude a drinking session. For the most part, Japanese customers do not eat rice or noodles (&quot;staple food&quot;) at the same time as they drink alcohol, since sake, brewed from rice, traditionally takes the place of rice in a meal.

== Types ==
 were traditionally down-to-earth places where men drank sake and beer after work. However, modern customers are more likely to include independent women and students. Many today cater to a more diverse clientele by offering cocktails and wines and a sophisticated interior. Chain are often large and offer an extensive selection of food and drink, allowing them to host big, sometimes rowdy, parties. Watami, Shoya, Shirokiya, Tsubohachi, and Murasaki are some of the well known chains in Japan.


 are often called (&quot;red lantern&quot;), after the red paper lanterns traditionally displayed outside. Today, the term usually refers to small, non-chain . Some unrelated businesses that are not also sometimes display red lanterns.

Cosplay became popular in the 2000s. The staff wear costumes and wait on customers. In some establishments, shows are performed. Costumes include those for butlers and maids.

Establishments specialising in are called . They usually take the form of street stalls with seating and are popular in winter.

 are places in which customers sit around an open hearth on which chefs grill seafood and vegetables. Fresh ingredients are displayed for customers to point at whenever they want to order.

<text>Auguste Honoré Charlois (; November 26, 1864 – March 26, 1910) was a French astronomer who discovered 99 asteroids while working at the Nice Observatory in southeastern France.

==Asteroid Discovery==
His first discovery was the asteroid 267 Tirza in 1887. He photographed 433 Eros on the very night of its discovery by Gustav Witt, but was not able to act quickly enough before Witt announced his find.

Although he started searching for asteroids in the era of visual detection, by 1891 Max Wolf had pioneered the use of astrophotography to drastically speed up the rate of detection of asteroids, and both Wolf and Charlois separately discovered far more asteroids than would have been feasible by visual detection. In 1899, Charlois received the Prix Jules Janssen, the highest award of the Société astronomique de France, the French astronomical society, and was also awarded the Valz Prize by the French Academy of Sciences in 1889 for his work on calculating asteroid orbits.

==Murder==
At the age of 45, he was murdered by Gabriel Brengues, the brother of his first wife, Jeanne Charlois and husband to the sister (Therese) of his second wife, Marie Brengues, over an inheritance by the death of Jeanne (née Brengues). The man was found guilty and given a life sentence of hard labor in New Caledonia.

==Memorial==
The asteroid 1510 Charlois, discovered by André Patry at Nice Observatory in 1939, was named in his honour.

<text>USS &quot;Essex&quot; was an &quot;Enterprise&quot;-class wooden-hulled armed naval steam sloop of war. She was built between 1874 and 1876 by Donald McKay at the Kitter Naval Yard of East Boston, Massachusetts. She was commissioned on 3 October 1876 by the United States Navy. On 23 December 1930 &quot;Essex&quot; was sold for scrap, and on 14 October 1931 she was taken to the beach just outside Duluth Harbor where they set fire to her; she eventually burned to the waterline. On 14 April 1994 the remains of &quot;Essex&quot; were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Her partially surviving hulk is significant because she is the only known remnant of the work of master shipbuilder McKay.

==History==
===Construction===
Shortly before his assassination, U.S. President Abraham Lincoln authorized the construction of &quot;Essex&quot;, but her construction was delayed for several years. On 10 February 1873 a Congressional act was approved. This act gave authority to the Secretary of the Navy to construct eight war vessels. The act stated that the four vessels should be built by the lowest responsible bidders for the contract in public competition. Donald McKay won the contract to build two of the four vessels, these were and USS &quot;Essex&quot;. &quot;Adams&quot; and &quot;Essex&quot; were sister ships, and both of them were built by the Kitter Naval Yard.

&quot;Essex&quot; keel was laid in 1874, and she was launched in 1876. &quot;Essex&quot; had a length of , her beam was and her draft was . Her gross register tonnage was 615 tons. She displaced of water. USS &quot;Essex&quot; engine was a fore and aft compound steam engine that was built by the Atlantic Engine Works of Boston, Massachusetts, and she had a single water tube boiler built by Babcock &amp; Wilcox. &quot;Essex&quot; was originally equipped with one cannon, four Dahlgren guns and a 60-pounder (127mm) cannon. &quot;Essex&quot; had a very bluff appearance; she had a figurehead, a moderate tumble home and a shapely rounded stern. She also had a bowsprit, a jib boom and also a flying jib boom. USS &quot;Essex&quot; was also believed to have copper sheathing on her bottom. She had two iron folding stock anchors at her bow. She carried six lifeboats that were chained to davits that were pointing outward from the main deck. Her retractable smokestack was positioned directly in front of the central mainmast. &quot;Essex&quot; was propelled by both steam and sail.

===Ocean service===
After being commissioned, she was placed in the command of Commander Winfield Scott Schley; and she later reported to the North Atlantic Squadron. During the year of 1877 &quot;Essex&quot; cruised to Liberia and along the west coast of Africa and in 1878–79 joined the South Atlantic Squadron. While at Monrovia, Liberia, on 31 October 1877, Ordinary Seaman John Millmore and First Class Fireman Henry Lakin Simpson rescued a shipmate from drowning, for which they were later awarded the Medal of Honor. &quot;Essex&quot; sailed on the Pacific Station from November 1881 to December 1882 and thence on the Asiatic Station for two years during which she took on board Captain S. H. Morrison and crew members of the shipwrecked &quot;Ranier&quot;. Following repairs she returned to the Asiatic Station under command of Commander T.F. Jewell in June 1886 and in October anchored at Ponape, Caroline Islands, to afford protection to American missionaries during a native uprising. She returned to New York via the Suez Canal and was placed out of commission in May 1889.

Regarded as one of the finest ships of the fleet, &quot;Essex&quot; was designated next as a training ship. A three-month cruise with cadets at the Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1893 was followed by two lengthy tours to train naval apprentices (January 1894–April 1898, and September 1898 to December 1903.)

===Great Lakes service===
From 1904 to 1916 the Navy Department loaned &quot;Essex&quot; to the Ohio Naval Militia. Lieutenant Anthony E. Nicklett of the Toledo Naval Militia decided to transfer &quot;Essex&quot; to the Toledo reserves. She was accepted, and plans were made to transfer her to the Toledo reserves. During her service on the Great Lakes &quot;Essex&quot; mostly used her sails because her engines were badly deteriorated. On one of her voyages she nearly collided with an ocean liner in dense fog. On another of her trips &quot;Essex&quot; ran aground in the mouth of the Saguenay River about from Quebec. A 15 August 1904, issue of the &quot;Toledo Blade&quot; described the event:
The pilot had gone aboard the tow tug when suddenly the &quot;Essex&quot; struck bottom in a spot where there are a large number of boulders, dangerous at all times. The tide commenced to lower soon after the ship struck and she gradually careened as the water commenced to fall, until her lights were under. Excitement reigned supreme but the best of order was maintained throughout. At noon that day the tide again rose until, when at its height, the vessel floated free. She did not get free, however, without assistance from the tug...

After being brought to into the Great Lakes from the Atlantic Ocean, General Critchfield ordered the Toledo reserves to cruise in &quot;Essex&quot; on Lake Erie if they wanted to. On 22 July 1904, while in Montreal, Quebec, &quot;Essex&quot; was joined by Captain Edward McNelly, who became her first captain on the Lakes. She was handed over to him by Lieutenant Anthony Nicklett. In 1910 her fore and aft compound engine was replaced with a triple expansion steam engine and her sail rig was reduced to two pole masts. In 1927 &quot;Essex&quot; was transferred to the Naval Reserve of the State of Minnesota. In 1928 &quot;Essex&quot; engine and her boilers were removed, she also had her deck housed over. After this conversion she was used as a receiving ship for the Minnesota Naval Militia and the U.S. Naval Reserve.

===End of service===
&quot;Essex&quot; served the Minnesota Naval Militia for three years after which she was stricken from the Navy list on 27 October 1930. &quot;Essex&quot; was sold for scrap on 23 December 1930. The navy sold her for $400 () to A.J. Klatzky who was the president of the Klatzky Iron and Metal Company. At the time she was sold &quot;Essex&quot; was the oldest steamer on the Navy&#x27;s list. On 22 November 1930, the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; wrote a lament to the old vessel:

On December 17 initial steps to divorce her from the navy will be instituted when she is offered to the highest bidder adjudged capable of treating her kindly in her old age.

The Klatzky Brothers stripped &quot;Essex&quot; and sold some of her pieces to former officers and enlisted men throughout the country. On 13 October 1931, &quot;Essex&quot; was towed to the lake side of Minnesota Point where she was set on fire with 200 gallons of kerosene, and by the morning of 14 October 1931, &quot;Essex&quot; had burned to the waterline. Two heavy steel cables held her so that the wind could not blow her out into Lake Superior. The remains of &quot;Essex&quot; were pulled up onto the beach so that her hull could continue to burn; any metals (such as spikes, nails, or drift pins) were also recovered for scrap. The Klatzky Brothers intended to burn away enough of &quot;Essex&quot; hull to pull it onto the shoreline.

===Hulk===
The partial wreck of &quot;Essex&quot;, intentionally burned to the waterline, lies on the shoreline of Lake Superior on Minnesota Point about one-third of a mile northwest of the Superior Harbor entrance. of &quot;Essex&quot; hull bottom lies partially submerged in of water, with a very small piece of the wreck buried in sand. Her wreck consists of her hull bottom, her keelson, sister keelson, rider keelson, bits of her frame and some hull and ceiling planks. Remains of her engine mount are also present on the site. The partial surviving hulk is the only known remnant of the work of Donald McKay.

The USS &quot;Essex&quot; Shipwreck Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994 for its state-level significance in the themes of engineering, historic archaeology, and maritime history.

<text>Massimiliano Antonio &quot;Max&quot; Cavalera (; born 4 August 1969) is a Brazilian musician. He co-founded the heavy metal band Sepultura in 1984 with his brother Igor Cavalera, and was the band&#x27;s lead singer and rhythm guitarist until his departure in 1996. He currently plays in the heavy metal bands Soulfly, Cavalera Conspiracy, Killer Be Killed and Go Ahead and Die. Cavalera was also involved in a short-lived side project called Nailbomb.

== Career and influences ==
Max Cavalera&#x27;s father, Graziano Cavalera, was an employee of the Italian Consulate in Belo Horizonte. He died at 41 years of age, when Max was nine years old. Cavalera&#x27;s family was in a state of financial crisis and family turbulence when he formed Sepultura with his younger brother Igor, in the bohemian neighborhood of Santa Tereza in Belo Horizonte. He moved to São Paulo in 1989 together with the other members of the band, and shared an apartment in Santa Cecília (district of São Paulo). In 1992, he relocated to Phoenix, Arizona. He did not begin to make spiritual music until after he quit Sepultura. His earlier lyrics for Soulfly were influenced by religion and spirituality, though he is critical of religion. His later albums, starting with &quot;Dark Ages&quot;, began to incorporate lyrical themes of violence, warfare, anger and hatred. His albums have all been dedicated to God, and he has often been depicted by the press as a man of religion, especially in the United States, something that Cavalera himself says he does not understand:

I do hate a lot of &quot;religion&quot;, but people like Christ – yeah they inspire me. I mean if you look at Christ, He was hanging around with the lowlifes, prostitutes and the losers you know, not going around with those high society motherfuckers you see trying to sell Jesus today!

When asked in an interview whether he was a Christian and whether Soulfly was a Christian band, he said:

No. I mean, if I was a Christian I would wear all these different kinds of omens. Because Christian people are so close-minded. A priest would not accept that. So I don&#x27;t like the concept of Christianity in terms of being so close-minded. It is the same with music. Sometimes I compare preachers to close-minded musicians or close-minded listeners, who only like one kind of music. Some preachers are the same. And they don&#x27;t tolerate Hindus, Buddhists or whatever. Only them. It&#x27;s bullshit. So Soulfly is not a Christian band at all. Very much opposite. But we are very spiritual. Spiritual has nothing to do with Christianity anyway. It has been here since the beginning of time.

In another interview, he was asked about the Varg Vikernes church burnings. He quoted, &quot;I support church burnings 100 percent, but why don&#x27;t we just burn everything. Mosques, temples, all religious buildings.&quot; However, he later claimed his views changed about the church burnings and called them &quot;too violent&quot;. He has stated that he does believe in God, &quot;But it might be different than the God the preacher preaches about.&quot;

Of enduring influence to his music, is the untimely death of his stepson, Dana Wells, who was killed in a car crash after the release of &quot;Roots&quot; in 1996. The songs &quot;Bleed&quot;, &quot;First Commandment&quot;, &quot;Pain&quot;, &quot;Tree of Pain&quot; and &quot;Revengeance&quot; are tributes to Wells, as well as Deftones&#x27; song &quot;Headup&quot;, in which Cavalera featured and co-wrote. He reunited with his brother Igor, in their band Cavalera Conspiracy, and wrote and performed on Soulfly&#x27;s &quot;Conquer&quot;, released in 2008.

Cavalera appears in the 2009 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned&quot; as himself on the ingame radio station LCHC.

In 2013, Cavalera released his autobiography, titled &quot;My Bloody Roots&quot;; his co-writer was the British author Joel McIver and the book&#x27;s foreword was written by Dave Grohl.

== Guitar style ==

Cavalera is known for playing his six-string guitar with only four strings; with the B and high E (2nd and 1st) strings opted out. The inspiration struck when he broke both strings one day and he did not bother to replace them. A friend later commented that the guitar looked better without them, thus it became his trademark. Cavalera used to play with three strings, but eventually started playing with four due to Andreas Kisser writing a Sepultura song that required another string. He did return to using three temporarily with his project Nailbomb.

== Personal life ==
Since 1992, Cavalera has lived in Phoenix, Arizona with his wife Gloria and their five children. Three of his sons are also active in music, with Richie fronting Incite and Igor and Zyon performing in Lody Kong. Jason tours as Zyon&#x27;s drum tech, amongst other various duties behind the scenes. In 2012 and 2013, Zyon toured with Soulfly after David Kinkade&#x27;s retirement, and now he is a regular member as drummer. Igor briefly filled in as bassist for Soulfly in 2015 after Tony Campos left the band, and toured as keyboardist and co-vocalist during Soulfly&#x27;s &quot;Point Blank&quot; Tour.

In 2022, Cavalera attracted criticism after a 2014 clip resurfaced of him telling a Moscow crowd that he supported the internationally unrecognised Russian annexation of Crimea.

On July 5, 2023, Cavalera announced that his mother Vania had died.

Cavalera is a fan of the Palmeiras and Detroit Lions.

== Collaborations ==

Cavalera has collaborated with many different artists while in Sepultura and Soulfly. In 2003, he joined forces with former Nirvana drummer and Foo Fighters&#x27; frontman Dave Grohl to produce &quot;Red War&quot; for the self-titled release of Dave Grohl&#x27;s metal project Probot.

<text>The Hawker Hind was a British light bomber of the inter-war years produced by Hawker Aircraft for the Royal Air Force. It was developed from the Hawker Hart day bomber introduced in 1931.

==Design and development==

An improved Hawker Hart bomber defined by Specification G.7/34, was purchased by the RAF as an interim aircraft, while more modern monoplane bombers such as the Fairey Battle were still in development. Structural elements were a mixture of steel and duralumin with the wings being fabric covered; the main differences compared to the earlier Hart was a new powerplant, (the Rolls-Royce Kestrel V) and the inclusion of refinements from the earlier derivatives such as the cut-down rear cockpit developed for the Demon. The prototype (Serial number &quot;K2915&quot;) was constructed very rapidly due to Hawker&#x27;s development work for other proposals and made its first flight on 12 September 1934. A variety of changes were subsequently incorporated (&quot;ram&#x27;s horn&quot; exhaust manifolds, Fairey-Reed metal propeller and engine improvements) with the first production Hind (&quot;K4636&quot;) flown on 4 September 1935.

==Operational history==
The Hind went into service in November 1935 and eventually equipped 20 RAF bomber squadrons. A number were also sold to foreign customers including Afghanistan, the Republic of Ireland, Latvia, Persia (Iran), Portugal, South Africa, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia. By 1937, the Hind was being phased out of front line service, replaced by the Fairey Battle and Bristol Blenheim, with many of the Auxiliary Air Force squadrons changing their role to fighter or maritime patrol units. At the outbreak of the Second World War, 613 Squadron retained the Hind for army co-operation before re-equipping with the Hart derivative, the Hawker Hector, in November 1939.

The Hind found a new career in 1938 as a training aircraft, representing the next step up from basic training on Tiger Moths. It continued in use as an intermediate trainer during the war. Hind trainers were also operated by Canada and New Zealand. In 1941, Hinds flew operations in their original role as light bombers against Axis forces. South African Hinds were employed against Italian forces in Kenya during the East African Campaign and Yugoslav Hinds were used against the Germans and Italians. Iranian Hinds were used briefly against Allied forces during the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran. Imperial Iranian Air Force bases were occupied by the Allies and their aircraft were destroyed or dismantled by the invading British. Hawker Hind aircraft were also used by the Afghan government to suppress the tribal revolts of 1944–1947.

<text>The point guard (PG), also called the one or the point, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position and is usually the shortest player on the court. Point guards are expected to run the team&#x27;s offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time. Above all, the point guard must understand and accept their coach&#x27;s game plan; in this way, the position can be compared to the position of quarterback in gridiron football. They must also be able to adapt to what the defense is allowing and must control the pace of the game.

A point guard specializes in certain skills, like other player positions in basketball. Their primary job is to facilitate scoring opportunities for their team, or sometimes for themselves. Lee Rose has described a point guard as a coach on the floor, who can handle and distribute the ball to teammates. This typically involves setting up plays on the court, getting the ball to the teammate in the best position to score and controlling the tempo of the game. Generally, a point guard should always look out for teammates and have the ability to pass well. A point guard should know when and how to instigate a fast break and initiate the more deliberate sets. Point guards are expected to be vocal floor leaders, with situational awareness of the shot clock and game clock times, the score, the number of remaining timeouts for both teams and more.

Magic Johnson won the National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) three times in his career, the most for a point guard in NBA history. Stephen Curry and Steve Nash have each been named the league MVP twice. Other NBA point guards with wins include Bob Cousy, Oscar Robertson, Allen Iverson, Derrick Rose, and Russell Westbrook. Since 1969, Johnson and Curry are the only point guards to win the NBA MVP, Finals MVP and All-Star Game MVP awards in their careers. Notable point guards of the WNBA include five-time champion Sue Bird, her Olympic teammate Diana Taurasi (the only two basketball players of either gender to earn five Olympic gold medals for basketball) and Courtney Vandersloot. In the NBA, point guards generally range from to whereas in the WNBA, point guards are usually or shorter. Having above-average size (height, muscle) is considered advantageous, although size is secondary to situational awareness, speed, quickness and ball-handling skills. At the shortest player in NBA history, Muggsy Bogues played 889 games in a 14-year career as a point guard.

After the opponent scores, it is typically the point guard who brings the ball down the court to begin an offensive play. Passing skills, ball handling and court vision are crucial. Speed is important; a speedy point guard is better able to create separation and space off the dribble, giving themselves room to work. Point guards are often valued more for their assist totals than for their scoring. John Stockton holds the all time NBA record for assists. Another major evaluation factor is the assist-to-turnover ratio, which reflects the decision-making skills of the player. Given the evolved nature of basketball in the modern day, a first-rate point guard is also required to have a reasonably effective jump shot.

== Offense ==
The point guard is positioned on the perimeter of the play to have the best view of the action, which is crucial because of their leadership obligations. Announcers often refer to the point guard as a &quot;coach on the floor&quot; or a &quot;floor general.&quot; These nicknames were particularly true in the past, as several point guards, such as Lenny Wilkens, served their teams as player-coaches. This practice is rare now, as most coaches specialize in their role. Some point guards have great leeway in the offense though they are still extensions of their coach on the floor and must display good leadership skills. 

Along with leadership and general basketball acumen, ball-handling is an important skill for a point guard. Generally speaking, the point guard is often the player in possession of the ball and is responsible for maintaining its possession. Point guards must be able to maintain possession of the ball in crowded spaces and be able to advance it quickly. A point guard with enough ball-handling skill and quickness to drive to the basket in a half-court set is also very valuable and considered by some to be a must for a successful offense.

After ball-handling, the most important areas of the game for a point guard are passing and scoring. As the primary decision-maker for a team, a point guard&#x27;s passing ability determines how well a point guard can put their decision into play. It is one thing to be able to recognize the player that is in a tactically advantageous position. Still, it is another thing entirely to be able to deliver the ball to that player. For this reason, a point guard is usually, but not always, more skilled and focused on passing than shooting. However, a good jump shot and the ability to score off a drive to the basket are still valuable skills. Point guards often use their scoring ability to augment their effectiveness as decision-makers and playmakers.

In addition to the traditional role of the point guard, modern teams have found new ways to utilize the position. Notably, several modern point guards have used a successful style of post-play, a tactic usually practiced by much larger centers and forwards. Exploiting the fact that the opposing point guard is often an undersized player with limited strength, several modern point guards have developed games close to the basket that include being able to utilize the drop step, spin move and fade-away jump shot.

In recent years, the sport&#x27;s shift from a fundamental style of play to a more athletic, scoring-oriented game resulted in the proliferation of so-called combo guards at the point guard position. More explosive and athletic point guards focus on scoring instead of play-making, forgoing assists, ball movement and often defense for higher scoring numbers. Young players who are relatively short are now developing the scoring aspects of their skill sets, whereas previously, these players would find it difficult to enter the NBA without true point guard skills. These combo point guards can surprise defenses. Instead of passing after bringing up the ball, they quickly drive to the basket or step back for an outside shot. There are some disadvantages to this style of play. A point guard often controls the offense and who gets the ball, as this type of controlling style of play is necessary to maintain the tempo of a game. Scoring point guards typically look to score first, thus preventing teammates from getting the ball and excluding them from the offense. Even so, combo guards still require above-average passing skills, but not as much as &quot;pure&quot; point guards (in the traditional sense).

==Defense==
A defensive point guard is someone who is exceptionally good at defense; their goal is to preclude the opposing point guard from scoring. A defensive point guard will try to accomplish this with constant pressure on the ball, making it difficult to maintain possession. A defensive point guard will also pressure opponents in passing lanes to generate steals and scoring opportunities for their team.

Current NBA point guards known for their defensive prowess include Jrue Holiday, Mike Conley Jr., Marcus Smart, and Chris Paul.

<doc id="583877" wikidata="Q659495" url="?curid=583877" title="Aerosol spray dispenser">
<text>Aerosol spray is a type of dispensing system which creates an aerosol mist of liquid particles. It comprises a can or bottle that contains a payload, and a propellant under pressure. When the container&#x27;s valve is opened, the payload is forced out of a small opening and emerges as an aerosol or mist.

==History==

The concepts of aerosol probably go as far back as 1790. The first aerosol spray can patent was granted in Oslo in 1927 to Erik Rotheim, a Norwegian chemical engineer, and a United States patent was granted for the invention in 1931. The patent rights were sold to a United States company for 100,000 Norwegian kroner. The Norwegian Postal Service, Posten Norge, celebrated the invention by issuing a stamp in 1998.

In 1939, American Julian S. Kahn received a patent for a disposable spray can, but the product remained largely undeveloped. Kahn&#x27;s idea was to mix cream and a propellant from two sources to make whipped cream at home—not a true aerosol in that sense. Moreover, in 1949, he disclaimed his first four claims, which were the foundation of his following patent claims.

It was not until 1941 that the aerosol spray can was first put to effective use by Americans Lyle Goodhue and William Sullivan of the United States Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine, who are credited as the inventors of the modern spray can. Their design of a refillable spray can, dubbed the aerosol bomb or bug bomb, is the ancestor of many commercial spray products. It was a hand-sized steel can charged with a liquefied gas under 75 pounds of pressure and a product to be expelled as a mist or a foam. A public-service patent was issued on the invention and assigned to the Secretary of Agriculture for the free use of the people of the United States. Pressurized by liquefied gas, which gave it propellant qualities, the small, portable can enabled soldiers to defend themselves against malaria-carrying mosquitoes by spraying inside tents and airplanes in the Pacific during World War II. Goodhue and Sullivan received the first Erik Rotheim Gold Medal from the Federation of European Aerosol Associations on August 28, 1970, in Oslo, Norway in recognition of their early patents and subsequent pioneering work with aerosol sprays.

In 1948, three companies were granted licenses by the United States government to manufacture aerosol sprays. Two of the three companies, Chase Products Company and Claire Manufacturing, continue to manufacture aerosol sprays. The &quot;crimp-on valve&quot;, used to control the spray in low-pressure aerosol sprays was developed in 1949 by Bronx machine shop proprietor Robert H. Abplanalp.

In 1974, Drs. Frank Sherwood Rowland and Mario J. Molina proposed that chlorofluorocarbons, used as propellants in aerosol sprays, contributed to the depletion of Earth&#x27;s ozone layer. In response to this theory, the U.S. Congress passed amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1977 authorizing the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate the presence of CFCs in the atmosphere. The United Nations Environment Programme called for ozone layer research that same year, and, in 1981, authorized a global framework convention on ozone layer protection. In 1985, Joe Farman, Brian G. Gardiner, and Jon Shanklin published the first scientific paper detailing the hole in the ozone layer. That same year, the Vienna Convention was signed in response to the UN&#x27;s authorization. Two years later, the Montreal Protocol, which regulated the production of CFCs was formally signed. It came into effect in 1989. The U.S. formally phased out CFCs in 1995.

==Aerosol propellants==

If aerosol cans were simply filled with compressed gas, it would either need to be at a dangerously high pressure and require special pressure vessel design (like in gas cylinders), or the amount of payload in the can would be small, and rapidly deplete.
Usually, the gas is the vapor of a liquid with boiling point slightly lower than room temperature. This means that inside the pressurized can, the vapor can exist in equilibrium with its bulk liquid at a pressure that is higher than atmospheric pressure (and able to expel the payload), but not dangerously high. As gas escapes, it is immediately replaced by evaporating liquid. Since the propellant exists in liquid form in the can, it should be miscible with the payload or dissolved in the payload. In gas dusters and freeze sprays, the payload itself acts as the propellant. The propellant in a gas duster can is not &quot;compressed air&quot; as sometimes assumed, but usually a haloalkane.

Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were once often used as propellants, but since the Montreal Protocol came into force in 1989, they have been replaced in nearly every country due to the negative effects CFCs have on Earth&#x27;s ozone layer. The most common replacements of CFCs are mixtures of volatile hydrocarbons, typically propane, n-butane and isobutane. Dimethyl ether (DME) and methyl ethyl ether are also used. All these have the disadvantage of being flammable. Nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide are also used as propellants to deliver foodstuffs (for example, whipped cream and cooking spray). Medicinal aerosols such as asthma inhalers use hydrofluoroalkanes (HFA): either HFA 134a (1,1,1,2,-tetrafluoroethane) or HFA 227 (1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane) or combinations of the two. More recently, liquid hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) propellants have become more widely adopted in aerosol systems due to their relatively low vapor pressure, low global warming potential (GWP), and nonflammability. 

Liquid aerosol propellant filling machines require additional precautions, such as being mounted externally to the production warehouse in a gas house. Liquid aerosol propellant machines are typically constructed to comply with ATEX Zone II/2G regulations (classification Zone 1).

Modern aerosol spray products have three major parts: the can, the valve and the actuator or button. The can is most commonly lacquered tinplate (steel with a layer of tin) and may be made of two or three pieces of metal crimped together. Aluminium cans are also common and are generally used for products that are more expensive or intended to have a more premium appearance, such as personal care products. The valve is crimped to the inside rim of the can, and the design of this component is important in determining the spray rate. The actuator is depressed by the user to open the valve; a spring closes the valve again when it is released. The shape and size of the nozzle in the actuator controls the aerosolized particle size and the spread of the aerosol spray.

==Non-propellant packaging alternatives==

True aerosol sprays release their propellant during use. Some non-propellant alternatives include various spray bottles, squeeze bottles, and Bag on Valve (BoV) or Bag in Can (BiC) compressed gas aerosol systems.

Packaging that uses a piston barrier system by CCL Industries or EarthSafe by Crown Holdings is often selected for highly viscous products such as post-foaming hair gels, thick creams and lotions, food spreads and industrial products and sealants. The main benefit of this system is that it eliminates gas permeation and assures separation of the product from the propellant, maintaining the purity and integrity of the formulation throughout its consumer lifespan. The piston barrier system also provides a consistent flow rate with minimal product retention.

Another type of dispensing system is the bag-in-can (or BOV, bag-on-valve technology) system where the product is separated from the pressurizing agent with a hermetically sealed, multi-layered laminated pouch, which maintains complete formulation integrity so only pure product is dispensed. Among its many benefits, the bag-in-can system extends a product&#x27;s shelf life, is suitable for all-attitude, (360-degree) dispensing, quiet and non-chilling discharge. One key performance difference relative to true aerosol systems is that traditional BoV dispensing pressures, BoVs pressurized solely by pressurized gas) drops as the product is dispensed. This bag-in-can system is used in the packaging of pharmaceutical, industrial, household, pet care and other products that require complete separation between the product and the propellant or require near complete evacuation of thin to viscous formulations.

A later development is the 2K (two component) aerosol spray, with a main component stored in a main chamber, and a second component stored in an accessory container. When an applicator activates the 2K aerosol by breaking the accessory container, the two components mix. The 2K aerosol can is advantageous for delivery of reactive mixtures; for example, a 2K reactive mixture can use low molecular weight monomer, oligomer, and functionalized low molecular polymer to make a final cross-linked high molecular weight polymer. A 2K aerosol can increase solid contents and deliver high-performance polymer products, such as curable paints, foams, and adhesives.

==Safety concerns==

Aerosol cans have three main areas of health concern:
* Contents may be deliberately inhaled to achieve intoxication from the propellant (known as inhalant abuse or &quot;huffing&quot;). Calling them &quot;canned air&quot; or &quot;cans of compressed air&quot; could mislead the ignorant to think they are harmless; in fact, such misuse has caused deaths.
* Aerosol burn injuries can be caused by the spraying of aerosol directly onto the skin, in a practice sometimes called &quot;frosting&quot;.
*The propellants in aerosol cans are typically combinations of ignitable gases and have been known to cause fires and explosions. However, non-flammable compressed gases such as nitrogen and nitrous oxide have been widely adopted into a number of aerosol systems such as air fresheners and aerosolized whipped cream, as have non-flammable liquid propellants.
*In later 2021 and through 2022, a large number of consumer aerosols were recalled due to the presence of benzene in their finished products. Where the recall was far reaching, Benzene is considered a trace contaminant in some but not all hydrocarbon propellants. Though rigorous testing at both the propellant manufacturer and the aerosol filling site, unsuitable aerosol propellants can be detected and destroyed prior to use in any finished products. 

In the United States, non-empty aerosol cans are considered hazardous waste, but are still considered &quot;recyclable when empty&quot; in US curbside recycling programs.

Aerosol products in the European Union must comply with health and safety regulations as set out in Directive 75/324/EEC. which established the &quot;reversed epsilon&quot; mark. This marking is required for aerosol products over 50ml. The same marking is also used in the United Kingdom, although the UKCA marking is planned to replace it in Great Britain.

<text>The HP 2100 is a series of 16-bit minicomputers that were produced by Hewlett-Packard (HP) from the mid-1960s to early 1990s. Tens of thousands of machines in the series were sold over its 25-year lifetime, making HP the fourth-largest minicomputer vendor during the 1970s.

The design started at Data Systems Inc (DSI), and was originally known as the DSI-1000. HP purchased the company in 1964 and merged it into their Dymec division. The original model, the 2116A built using integrated circuits and magnetic-core memory, was released in 1966. Over the next four years, models A through C were released with different types of memory and expansion, as well as the cost-reduced 2115 and 2114 models. All of these models were replaced by the HP 2100 series in 1971, and then again as the 21MX series in 1974 when the magnetic-core memory was replaced with semiconductor memory.

All of these models were also packaged as the HP 2000 series, combining a 2100-series machine with optional components in order to run the BASIC programming language in a multi-user time sharing fashion. HP Time-Shared BASIC was popular in the 1970s, and many early BASIC programs were written on or for the platform, most notably the seminal &quot;Star Trek&quot; that was popular during the early home computer era. The People&#x27;s Computer Company published their programs in HP 2000 format.

The introduction of the HP 3000 in 1974 provided high-end competition to the 2100 series; the entire line was renamed as the HP 1000 in 1977 and positioned as real-time computers. A greatly redesigned version was introduced in 1979 as the 1000 L-Series, using CMOS large scale integration chips and introducing a desk-side tower case model. This was the first version to break backward compatibility with previous 2100-series expansion cards. The final upgrade was the A-series, with new processors capable of more than 1 MIPS performance, with the final A990 released in 1990.

==History==

===Origins===
HP formed Dynac in 1956 to act as a development shop for projects the main company would not normally undertake. Their original logo was simply the HP logo turned upside down, forming something approximating &quot;dy&quot; and thus inspiring the name. Learning that Westinghouse owned a trademark on that name, in 1958 they changed it to Dymec. The company was brought in-house in 1959 to become the Dymec Division, and in November 1967 was renamed the Palo Alto Division.

Dymec originally made a variety of products for the HP family, but over time became primarily an integrator, building test equipment and similar systems that were used by HP. In 1964, Kay Magleby and Paul Stoft began experimenting with the use of PDP-5 and PDP-8 computers to act as controllers for their complex test systems, but they felt the machines would require changes to truly suit their needs. At the time, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) was still a small company and a takeover target. David Packard found Ken Olsen too difficult to deal with, and such plans went nowhere.

Looking for another design they could purchase, Packard was led to the five-person Data Systems, Inc. (DSI) of Detroit. DSI was owned by Union Carbide, and when Packard asked how it was that Union Carbide came to own a computer company, HP Labs manager Barney Oliver replied, &quot;We didn&#x27;t demand an answer to that question.&quot; Bill Hewlett initially refused to consider the development of a &quot;minicomputer&quot;, but when Packard reframed it as an &quot;instrument controller&quot; the deal was approved.

DSI was purchased in 1964 and initially set up at Dymec with four of the original five employees of DSI and a number of other employees coming from HP&#x27;s instrumentation divisions. The computer group later moved to its own offices in Cupertino, California, in a building purchased from Varian Associates, becoming the Cupertino Division.

===First models===

Led by Magleby, the new division completed the design as the 2116A, which was demonstrated 7–10 November 1966 at the Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco. It was one of the earliest 16-bit minis to hit the market, but at the time it was more notable as &quot;an unusual new instrumentation computer&quot; with a highly expandable design and real-time support. The system featured an oversized cabinet that held up to 16 expansion cards, or could be further expanded to 48 cards with an external expansion cage.

The system launched with 20 different instrumentation cards, including &quot;counters, nuclear scalers, electronic thermometers, digital voltmeters, ac/ohms converters, data amplifiers, and input scanners.&quot; An additional set added input/output devices like tape drives, printers, punched cards, and paper tape, and other peripherals. Real-time service was provided by having each card slot be assigned a fixed interrupt vector that called the appropriate device driver.

As the machine entered the market, it quickly became clear it was selling much more rapidly into the business data processing market than the originally targeted instrumentation market. This led to the introduction of the 2115A in 1967, which removed much of the expansion capabilities to make a lower-cost offering for commercial users. A further simplified version shipped as the 2114A in 1968, which had only eight slots, leaving room for the power supply to be incorporated into the main chassis. The 2115 and 2114 also lacked the extensive DMA control of the 2116, removed some of the mathematical operations, and ran at slightly slower speeds.

These are the original models using core memory and a hardwired CPU:

*2116A, 10 MHz clock, 1.6-microsecond (μs) cycle time. Normally supplied with 4k words, expandable to 8k internally or 16k with an external memory system. Chassis includes 16 I/O slots, also expandable. Weight . Introduced November 1966. It marked HP&#x27;s first use of integrated circuits.
*2116B, supported a new 32k memory expansion option. Weight as above. Introduced September 1968.
*2116C, used smaller core so a full 32k could fit in the main chassis. Introduced October 1970.
*2115A, short-lived, cost-reduced version that removed the DMA and some math functions, had only 8 I/O slots, and ran at 8 MHz clock and a 2.0 μs cycle time. Weighed , required a bulky external power supply – total weight: . Introduced November 1967.
*2114A, further simplified 2115 with a new front panel and internal power supply. Non-mechanical touch switches on front panel. Weight . Introduced October 1968.
*2114B, 2114A with a single DMA channel and a new front panel with illuminated push-buttons. Introduced November 1969.
*2114C, as 2114B with a maximum 16k memory. Introduced October 1970.

===HP 2000===
In November 1968 the company released the 2000A Timeshare System, later known as HP 2000/Access. This was based on the 2116B (a 2116A with an expanded 8k core memory) running HP Time-Shared BASIC and used a separate 2114 as a terminal server. T-S BASIC allowed multiple user accounts to be created with up to 16 users logged in at once.

Later models of the 2000, B through F, used newer versions of the underlying CPU as they were introduced. Some models used low-end versions of the same CPU as the terminal server; the 2000F, for instance, used a 2100S as the main CPU and primary storage controller, while a 2100A acted as the terminal server. The B, C and F models were dual-processor. In the last version, the 2000F, a 2100S and 2100A CPU were used, with the 2100A connected to up to 32 serial terminals via serial multiplexer interfaces.

In spite of its relatively high costs—the 2000F cost $105,000 in 1974, or about $ in —it was the first minicomputer to offer time-shared BASIC, which made it very popular in the early-to-mid-1970s.

===2100===

Through the 1970s, the lineup was constantly improved with new models that remained compatible in software and expansion with the original 2116.

In early 1970, Fred Allard, formerly of Ampex&#x27;s Memory Core Division, was asked to design a new magnetic-core memory system for the systems rather than continue purchasing them from Ampex. Using newer 18 mil cores, down from 22 mil, and using a single sense/inhibit line, they fit an 8 kW memory onto a single expansion card. This was used starting in the 2116C models.

In 1971, the updated 2100A replaced the entire existing 211x lineup. The overall system was similar to the earlier models and continued to be based on core memory. Physically, it most resembled the 2114, as the power supply was built-in and it had limited internal expansion. However, the CPU was rebuilt with microcode that could be user-programmed, added hardware multiply and divide, and it added a simple memory protection system, which caused a high-priority interrupt when triggered. A two-channel DMA controller provided higher throughput. An optional floating-point unit was also available. Front panel buttons were illuminated by small incandescent lamps that burned out with use. The use of a switched-mode power supply allowed the chassis to be significantly smaller than the earlier models.

By 1972, HP had shipped 4,500 minis, making it one of the largest companies in the market. That year, they merged the Mountain View Division, which made magnetic tape drives, with the Cupertino Division to create the Data Systems Division (DSD). By this time, the HP 3000 project was in serious trouble, and in February 1973, Packard sent Paul Ely to take over the division. Sales of the 2100 series remained strong; the 6000th shipped in August 1973, the 8000th in February 1974, and its 10,000th in February 1975. They were declared obsolete in 1978.
*2100A, normally with 4 kW but expandable to 32 kW, 14 I/O slots expandable to 45. Introduced in 1971.
*2100S, a 2100A bundled with the floating-point option, a time base generator for interfacing with time-dependent hardware, and a teleprinter interface card. Introduced in 1973.

===21MX===
In 1972, the division decided to move to 4kbit SRAM memory chips in place of core. These were about twice as fast as contemporary low-cost core, and much smaller, allowing 32kword machines to be built in a 2114-like form factor. At the time they made this decision, 4kbit SRAMs were not actually available, so experimental machines using the core from a 2100 series were used initially, replaced by 1kbit SRAM. At first it appeared 4k parts would not be available by the time the rest of the machine had been upgraded, so the company canvassed various manufacturers and found that a few were aggressively developing 4k parts. In particular, Intel, Mostek, Motorola, and Texas Instruments were all suggesting such parts would be available in quantity by late 1974.

Using such memories in an expansion chassis like the earlier systems meant there was room for much more memory, into the megaword range. However, the CPU&#x27;s use of 15-bit addresses limited the size to 32kwords. To address the desire for larger systems, HP developed the &quot;Dynamic Mapping System&quot;, or DMS. DMS expanded the address format from 15 to 20 bits, allowing a maximum of 1,048,576 words, a dramatic expansion of the original system.

These changes led to the 1974 introduction of the first of the 21MX series machines. This stood for the &quot;21-M&quot; processor and the &quot;21-X&quot; memory, as the memory control systems were separated from the CPU in order to provide flexibility in case the chosen 4k parts were changed during production. This proved useful in practice as the machines were shipped with memories using either Motorola or Texas Instruments parts, and they could be mixed in a single machine, while the higher density system based on 16-pin Mostek parts could be supported by replacing the normal 21-X/2 controller with the 21-X/1.

The entire 2100 series was replaced in 1974 with the first of these 21MX series machines. Using the highest-density parts, the new machines could support up to 1.2 MB in the largest models. When the CPU was further upgraded in 1976, the new models became the &quot;21MX E-Series&quot; and the original models retroactively became the &quot;21MX M-Series&quot;. The main difference between the M and E was that the E used clever timing to improve the speed to about twice that of the M. A wider variety of machine styles were released as part of the 21MX series, including smaller systems with four slots and larger ones with 9 or 14 slots.

The 21MX series featured a memory management unit and semiconductor memory expandable to 1,048,576 words (one megaword). The bit displays on the front panel buttons used small red light-emitting diodes (LEDs), instead of the burnout-prone incandescent bulbs used in earlier versions.
*M-series – 2105A, 2108A, 2112A (blue line on front panel)
*E-series – 2109A, 2113A (yellow line on front panel; E for extended)
*F-series – 2111F, 2117F (red line on front panel; F for floating-point processor in a separate 2U chassis)

The 21MX ran the HP RTE (real time) operating system (OS). They started out as refrigerator-sized 19-inch rackmount systems with lights and switches on the front panels. The last models would use a 1-chip processor and fit under a desk using a console terminal rather than a front panel.

The new L and A series models had HP-IB interface ability, but as with all HP systems at that time, the blinking LED lights were removed from the front panel. Despite customer demands for a real-time ability and HP R&amp;D&#x27;s efforts using an installable real-time card, the RTE-A OS was not as good at real-time operations as RTE on a 21MX. This was an important reason this computer was hard to kill. Many companies use real-time operations to take a measurements and control processes—turn on or off a pump, heater, a valve, speed up or slow down a motor, etc.

===1000 series===

At the end of 1977, the entire line was renamed as the &quot;HP 1000&quot;, becoming the &quot;HP 1000 M-Series&quot; and &quot;HP 1000 E-Series&quot;. The next year the &quot;HP 1000 F-Series&quot; was introduced, which was an E-Series with an added floating point unit. By 1978, the success of the line had propelled HP to become the fourth-largest manufacturer in the minicomputer space, trailing only DEC, IBM, and Data General.

In 1980, the &quot;HP 1000 L-Series&quot; was introduced. This used a new processor based on HP&#x27;s large-scale integration silicon on sapphire process. Additionally, the expansion cards were also equipped with their own processors that allowed them to access main memory and conduct input/output without bothering the CPU. Although this made the expansion cards incompatible with the earlier models for the first time, it also greatly improved overall performance. These models lacked the memory management unit.
*HP1000L silicon on sapphire (SOS) CPU and I/O processors

The L-Series was, in turn, replaced in 1982 with the &quot;HP 1000 A-Series&quot;, which included a new &quot;Lightning&quot; CPU design that reached 1 MIPS, and the even faster &quot;Magic&quot; CPU at 3 MIPS. A wide variety of different models was produced, including desk-side towers, and a variety of different size rack-mount systems. A low-end A400 model was introduced in 1986, and the final high-end A990 released in 1990. Each addressable up to 32 MB of RAM.
*1981:
**A600 – based on Am2900 bit-slice processor, 1 MIPS, 53kFLOPS Codename: LIGHTNING
**A600+ – based on Am2900 bit-slice processor, supports code and data separation, optional ECC (error correcting) memory.
*1982??:

*1984:

===Legacy===
The HP 2000 series was introduced in 1969, sold until June 1978, and was supported until 1985.

Versions of many seminal BASIC games were written on, or ported to, the platform. Notable among these was Mike Mayfield&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot; of 1971. Its popularity made its dialect of BASIC a &quot;lingua franca&quot; and many BASIC listings were normally provided in that format; the People&#x27;s Computer Company published their programs in HP 2000 format. HP systems were also used for teaching statistics, regression analysis, and economics.

===21st century===
The 2000 and 2100 designations have been reused:
* &quot;HP 2000&quot; refers to a laptop computer
* &quot;HP 2100&quot; refers to a LaserJet printer

==Architecture==
===Memory organization===
The HP 2100 was designed in an era when RAM in the form of magnetic core memory was falling from dollars to pennies per bit, while implementing processor registers using transistors or small-scale integration remained very expensive. This favored designs with few registers and most storage in RAM, which in turn influenced the instruction set architecture (ISA) to use a memory-memory or memory-accumulator design. This basic concept was first widely introduced in the seminal 12-bit PDP-8, which spawned many similar designs like the 2100.

In the 2100, addresses are 15-bits long, allowing a total of 32k 16-bit words of memory (64 KB in modern terms). The smallest addressable unit of memory is a 16-bit word; it has no instructions that fetch a single 8-bit byte. The address is broken into two parts, the 5 most significant bits refer to one of 32 &quot;pages&quot;, while the 10 least significant bits are the &quot;displacement&quot; pointing to a single word within the 1,024-word page. With the DMS system in the 21MX series, the upper 5 bits are instead used to select one of 32 registers, each of which holds 12 bits. The least significant 10 bits of the register are then placed in front of the original 10-bit displacement to produce a 20-bit address. The two most significant bits are used to implement memory protection.

Most processing is handled in the two A and B registers, each 16 bits wide. The registers are also accessible at memory locations 0 and 1, respectively. This means that one can load a value into an accumulator using the normal register-save operation, for instance, codice_1 will LoaD the value of the A register into memory location 1, thereby copying the value of A into B.

In addition to the A and B registers, the CPU also includes the M register which holds the current memory address, and the T register which holds the value at that address. The P register is used as the program counter and automatically incremented with every instruction, but it is also used as the base address for some memory accesses (see below) that are calculated and placed in M. There are also two one-bit registers, Overflow and Extend, in modern terms, these bits would be considered the status register. Additionally, there is the 16-bit S/D (Switch/Display) register, which is used for input and output from the front panel.

Certain areas of memory are reserved for special purposes, like locations 0 and 1 used by the accumulators. Additional words in the lowest 64 locations in memory are used for direct memory access (DMA), and vectored interrupts (see below). In later models, the highest 64 words of available memory are reserved for the boot loader.

===Instructions===

The original instruction set contained 68 or 70 instructions.

* Arithmetic – Add, Increment, And, Or, Exclusive or
* Program Control – Skip, Jump, Jump to Subroutine
* Shift and Rotate – Arithmetic and Logical Shifts, 16- and 17-bit Rotates
* Optional – Multiply, Divide, 32-bit Load and Store, 32-bit Shifts

All 68 instructions in the standard instruction set are 16 bits long. Most execute in one memory cycle, or 16 clock cycles, although indirect addressing and the codice_2 can use up to 36 cycles. Conditional branching is done with a conditional skip-over-one instruction, that one instruction normally being a jump instruction. There is no stack for subroutines; instead, the first memory location of the routine is reserved, and the return address written to that location by the codice_3 instruction. This means there is no internal support for re-entrant code; support for this has to be added via a user-implemented stack.

There are three basic styles of instructions in the ISA; memory references, register references, and input/output. Certain models extended the ISA with add-on hardware, adding, for instance, floating point instructions or additional integer math and memory instructions, but these would fall into the same three basic categories.

Memory instructions use four bits for the instruction, and two more for special flags, for a total of six bits of the 16-bit word. This leaves room for a 10-bit address in the instruction, stored in the least significant bits (LSBs), 0 to 9. If bit 15 is set, this indicates &quot;indirect&quot; addressing instead of &quot;direct&quot;. In Direct mode, the address in the instruction is the address of the operand, while in Indirect mode, the address was a pointer to another memory location that contained the address of the operand. One could set bit 15 on that location as well, allowing the indirection to be of any required depth, ending when one of the locations has a 0 in bit 15.

In addition to the Direct/Indirect mode, bit 10 of the instruction controls the Z/C flag. When set to 0, this means the address&#x27;s upper five bits were zero while the lower 10 were the value in the instruction. This allows fast access to the Z(ero) page, the first 1,024 words of memory. When set to 1, the address is constructed by combining the 10 bits in the instruction to the top 5 bits of the P register, the C(urrent) page of memory, allowing memory to be accessed as 32 pages of 1024 words. Thus 2,048 words can be addressed at any given time; 1,024 of them within page zero and another 1,024 within the same page as the instruction performing the reference.

Register instructions do not require an address, and thus have more free bits to work with. This is used to pack up four or eight instructions into a single memory word, which, used properly, can significantly speed operations. A total of 39 register operations are included, which are broken down into shift-and-rotate instructions, and the alter-and-skip instructions, indicated by bit 10, while bit 11 indicates whether this is being applied to register A or B.

There are two general classes of register instructions, the shift-and-rotate group and the alter-and-skip. The first is used for basic bitwise manipulation of the values in a register and can have up to four instructions per word, although the two instructions in the middle are always a codice_4 (clear E, skip if A/B is zero). The second group has eight instructions that perform increments on the registers and then a conditional branch. These are normally used to implement loops.

===I/O and interrupts===
Input/Output instructions normally communicate through the accumulators. The instruction format starts with the bits &quot;1000&quot; in the most significant bits, followed by a single bit indicating which register to use (A=0, B=1), followed by a &quot;1&quot;, the H/C flag bit, and then three bits for the instruction and the remaining six bits for the I/O device ID, or channel, allowing up to 64 devices. Some device numbers are used by the system itself.

I/O is initiated by clearing the Flag bit with codice_5 and then setting the C bit using codice_6. The hardware notices this pattern and begins its operation. When the operation is complete, the device sets the Flag bit and then the program loads the resulting data from the card using the codice_7 instruction, or sends it to the card with codice_8.

The actual data transfer is normally accomplished using the interrupt system. Memory locations 4 through 63 (decimal) hold the addresses of routines to jump to when an interrupt is fired, providing 60 interrupt levels. Location 4 through 7 are hard-wired to power failures, parity check errors, and in later models memory protection errors. Locations 8 and up are user-accessible interrupt vectors, mapped to an I/O channel and arranged in priority order. So if I/O device 13 produced an interrupt, the CPU jumps to the location in memory location 13, but only if it is not masked out by a higher-priority interrupt, 1 to 12.

Another key feature of the 2100 series is a separate direct memory access controller that uses cycle stealing to access memory when the CPU is not using it, during the times when it is performing internal calculations for instance. Using this feature, lengthy I/O processes can be completed while the CPU works on other problems. The system is set up by sending an instruction to the DMA controller using the I/O commands; the DMA controller is channel 6, and is initially sent an instruction containing the number of the I/O device that wants to use DMA, whether it is an input (write to memory from device) or output (read from memory to device), the starting location in memory for the data, and the number of words. This setup code is often installed into one of the interrupt vectors, automating the process. The DMS has separate tables for the CPU and DMA system, so DMA can load data into separate parts of extended memory.

===Programming===
HP supplied a three-pass assembler for the machine, using a column-delimited format. The first area, on the left of the line of code, is the label, which has to start in column 1 if present. Next comes the instruction mnemonic, then the parameters. The rest of the line can be used for a comment. The assembler allows basic mathematical expressions to be written directly, instead of using mnemonics, and also includes a number of pseudo-instructions like codice_9 to set the base address of the program.

In addition to the assembler and associated linker, the machines initially shipped with a FORTRAN 66 compiler, the operating system, and I/O drivers. Over time, additional languages were added including BASIC, ALGOL, FORTRAN IV and FORTRAN 77.

HP ported implementations of AGL to the platform, which added commands to their BASIC to produce graphics on their graphics terminals and plotters. A similar expansion in their FORTRAN was called GRAPHICS/1000.

===Operating systems===
The 2100s were normally used with the &quot;Real Time Executive&quot; operating system, or RTE for short. Several versions of RTE were released for the different versions of the machine; RTE-II for the 2114-2116, RTE-III for the 2100s, RTE-IV for the 21MX series, and RTE-A for the &quot;A&quot; series.

The operating system shell, even in the late 1970s, was very primitive, with a single-level file system, File Manager, or FMGR. For example, the command to run a FORTRAN compiler would be as follows:

 ru, f77, &amp;test,&#x27;test,%test

meaning run the f77 program, using special characters to distinguish between source file, object, and executable files.

The HP 1000 also was one of the few minicomputers that restricted file names to only five characters, rather than the six common at the time, which made porting and even writing programs a challenge. The later RTE-A for HP 1000 provided conventional directory structure with 16.4 file names, and made the ru command optional.

TODS (Test Oriented Disk System) was developed by a technician at the HP board repair center to improve turn-around time in the center. It was used to load diagnostics from a central repository as opposed to loading individual paper tapes. TODS was also used on HP 2116 thru 21MX-F series for test systems for missiles such as Phoenix (9206B), Harpoon (9500D-354), Tomahawk, and many others. Early test sets were the 9500A, evolving to the 9500D, followed by the ATS (Automated Test System); specific HP test systems, such as the 9500D-A46 Minuteman launch component test set and ATS-E35 Peacekeeper/Minuteman launch component test set; the HP 8580/8542 Microwave ANA/ASA (Automatic Network Analyzer / Automated Spectrum Analyzer) ran on TODS; and the TDRSS microwave transponder test set used TODS and was a very large system.

There was also MTOS (Magnetic Tape Operating System) similar to TODS.

==Descendants and variants==

The HP 9810, 9820, and 9830 desktop computers use a slow, serialized TTL version of the 2116 CPU, although they did not ultimately use any of the operating system or application software, instead relying on user-friendly ROM-based interpreters, such as BASIC, which work when powered up, and integrated keyboards and displays rather than disks or standard terminals. In 1975, HP introduced the BPC (Binary Processing Chip), one of the world&#x27;s first 16-bit microprocessors, using HP&#x27;s NMOS-II process. The BPC was usually packaged in a ceramic hybrid module with the EMC and IOC chips, which added extended math and I/O instructions. The hybrid was developed as the heart of the new 9825 desktop computer. The later 9845 workstation added an MMU chip. These were the forerunners of personal computers and technical workstations.

The major differences between the original 2116 architecture and the BPC microprocessor are a completely redesigned I/O structure, the removal of multiple levels of indirect addressing, and the provision of a stack register for subroutine call and return. The elimination of multiple indirection made an additional bit available in a memory word containing an indirect address, allowing the maximum memory capacity to be increased from 32K 16-bit words to 64K. The BPC also added an input allowing the &quot;current page&quot; to be relative to the location of the current instruction, rather than a power-of-two aligned page.

The BPC was used in a wide range of HP computers, peripherals, and test equipment, until it was discontinued in the late 1980s.

Poland manufactured an HP 2114B clone since 1973. The Polish clones were called MKJ-28 (prototype, 1973), SMC-3 (pilot production, 17 machines, 1975-1977), and PRS-4 (production in series over 150 machines, 1978-1987).

Czechoslovakia produced its own HP 1000 compatible clones, designated ADT4000 (4300, 4500, 4700, 4900). The vendors Aritma Prague (development), ZPA Čakovice, and ZPA Trutnov delivered more than 1,000 units between 1973 and 1990. Those computers served in power plants, including nuclear ones, other industry, military, at universities, etc., for their high reliability and real-time features. Operating systems were DOS/ADT (several versions) and Unix. The oldest hybrid ADT7000 (1974) was composed of digital ADT4000 and analog ADT3000 parts, but only the digital part was interesting for customers. ADT4316 (1976) had 16K words of ferrite core memory, the ADT4500 (1978) up to 4M words of semiconductor RAM. The ADT 4900 was designed as a single-board computer, but its mass production did not start. Czechoslovak People&#x27;s Army used ADT-based MOMI 1 and MOMI 2 mobile minicomputers, built into a container carried by the Tatra 148 truck.

<doc id="583901" wikidata="Q900729" url="?curid=583901" title="Combined cycle power plant">
<text>A combined cycle power plant is an assembly of heat engines that work in tandem from the same source of heat, converting it into mechanical energy. On land, when used to make electricity the most common type is called a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plant, which is a kind of gas-fired power plant. The same principle is also used for marine propulsion, where it is called a combined gas and steam (COGAS) plant. Combining two or more thermodynamic cycles improves overall efficiency, which reduces fuel costs.

The principle is that after completing its cycle in the first engine, the working fluid (the exhaust) is still hot enough that a second subsequent heat engine can extract energy from the heat in the exhaust. Usually the heat passes through a heat exchanger so that the two engines can use different working fluids.

By generating power from multiple streams of work, the overall efficiency can be increased by 50–60%. That is, from an overall efficiency of the system of say 34% for a simple cycle, to as much as 64% net for the turbine alone in specified conditions for a combined cycle.

== Historical cycles ==
Historically successful combined cycles have used mercury vapour turbines, magnetohydrodynamic generators and molten carbonate fuel cells, with steam plants for the low temperature &quot;bottoming&quot; cycle. Very low temperature bottoming cycles have been too costly due to the very large sizes of equipment needed to handle the large mass flows and small temperature differences. However, in cold climates it is common to sell hot power plant water for hot water and space heating. Vacuum-insulated piping can let this utility reach as far as 90 km. The approach is called &quot;combined heat and power&quot; (CHP).

In stationary and marine power plants, a widely used combined cycle has a large gas turbine (operating by the Brayton cycle). The turbine&#x27;s hot exhaust powers a steam power plant (operating by the Rankine cycle). This is a &quot;combined cycle gas turbine&quot; (CCGT) plant. These achieve a best-of-class real (see below) thermal efficiency of around 64% in base-load operation. In contrast, a single cycle steam power plant is limited to efficiencies from 35 to 42%. Many new power plants utilize CCGTs. Stationary CCGTs burn natural gas or synthesis gas from coal. Ships burn fuel oil.

Multiple stage turbine or steam cycles can also be used, but CCGT plants have advantages for both electricity generation and marine power. The gas turbine cycle can often start very quickly, which gives immediate power. This avoids the need for separate expensive peaker plants, or lets a ship maneuver. Over time the secondary steam cycle will warm up, improving fuel efficiency and providing further power.

In November 2013, the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE assessed the levelised cost of energy for newly built power plants in the German electricity sector. They gave costs of between 78 and €100 /MWh for CCGT plants powered by natural gas. In addition the capital costs of combined cycle power is relatively low, at around $1000/kW, making it one of the cheapest types of generation to install.

==Basic combined cycle==
The thermodynamic cycle of the basic combined cycle consists of two power plant cycles. One is the Joule or Brayton cycle which is a gas turbine cycle and the other is the Rankine cycle which is a steam turbine cycle. The cycle 1-2-3-4-1 which is the gas turbine power plant cycle is the topping cycle. It depicts the heat and work transfer process taking place in the high temperature region.

The cycle a-b-c-d-e-f-a which is the Rankine steam cycle takes place at a lower temperature and is known as the bottoming cycle. Transfer of heat energy from high temperature exhaust gas to water and steam takes place in a waste heat recovery boiler in the bottoming cycle. During the constant pressure process 4-1 the exhaust gases from the gas turbine reject heat. The feed water, wet and super heated steam absorb some of this heat in the process a-b, b-c and c-d.

=== Steam generators ===

The steam power plant takes its input heat from the high temperature exhaust gases from a gas turbine power plant. The steam thus generated can be used to drive a steam turbine. The Waste Heat Recovery Boiler (WHRB) has 3 sections: Economiser, evaporator and superheater.

=== Cheng cycle ===

The Cheng cycle is a simplified form of combined cycle where the steam turbine is eliminated by injecting steam directly into the combustion turbine. This has been used since the mid 1970s and allows recovery of waste heat with less total complexity, but at the loss of the additional power and redundancy of a true combined cycle system. It has no additional steam turbine or generator, and therefore it cannot be used as a backup or supplementary power. It is named after American professor D. Y. Cheng who patented the design in 1976.

== Design principles ==

The efficiency of a heat engine, the fraction of input heat energy that can be converted to useful work, is limited by the temperature difference between the heat entering the engine and the exhaust heat leaving the engine.

In a thermal power station, water is the working medium. High pressure steam requires strong, bulky components. High temperatures require expensive alloys made from nickel or cobalt, rather than inexpensive steel. These alloys limit practical steam temperatures to 655 °C while the lower temperature of a steam plant is fixed by the temperature of the cooling water. With these limits, a steam plant has a fixed upper efficiency of 35–42%.

An open circuit gas turbine cycle has a compressor, a combustor and a turbine. For gas turbines the amount of metal that must withstand the high temperatures and pressures is small, and lower quantities of expensive materials can be used. In this type of cycle, the input temperature to the turbine (the firing temperature), is relatively high (900 to 1,400 °C). The output temperature of the flue gas is also high (450 to 650 °C). This is therefore high enough to provide heat for a second cycle which uses steam as the working fluid (a Rankine cycle).

In a combined cycle power plant, the heat of the gas turbine&#x27;s exhaust is used to generate steam by passing it through a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) with a live steam temperature between 420 and 580 °C. The condenser of the Rankine cycle is usually cooled by water from a lake, river, sea or cooling towers. This temperature can be as low as 15 °C.

=== Typical size ===
Plant size is important in the cost of the plant. The larger plant sizes benefit from economies of scale (lower initial cost per kilowatt) and improved efficiency.

For large-scale power generation, a typical set would be a 270 MW primary gas turbine coupled to a 130 MW secondary steam turbine, giving a total output of 400 MW. A typical power station might consist of between 1 and 6 such sets.

Gas turbines for large-scale power generation are manufactured by at least four separate groups – General Electric, Siemens, Mitsubishi-Hitachi, and Ansaldo Energia. These groups are also developing, testing and/or marketing gas turbine sizes in excess of 300 MW (for 60 Hz applications) and 400 MW (for 50 Hz applications). Combined cycle units are made up of one or more such gas turbines, each with a waste heat steam generator arranged to supply steam to a single or multiple steam turbines, thus forming a combined cycle block or unit. Combined cycle block sizes offered by three major manufacturers (Alstom, General Electric and Siemens) can range anywhere from 50 MW to well over 1300 MW with costs approaching $670/kW.

=== Unfired boiler ===

The heat recovery boiler is item 5 in the COGAS figure shown above. Hot gas turbine exhaust enters the super heater, then passes through the evaporator and finally through the economiser section as it flows out from the boiler. Feed water comes in through the economizer and then exits after having attained saturation temperature in the water or steam circuit. Finally it flows through the evaporator and super heater. If the temperature of the gases entering the heat recovery boiler is higher, then the temperature of the exiting gases is also high.

=== Dual pressure boiler===
In order to remove the maximum amount of heat from the gasses exiting the high temperature cycle, a dual pressure boiler is often employed. It has two water/steam drums. The low-pressure drum is connected to the low-pressure economizer or evaporator. The low-pressure steam is generated in the low temperature zone of the turbine exhaust gasses. The low-pressure steam is supplied to the low-temperature turbine. A super heater can be provided in the low-pressure circuit.

Some part of the feed water from the low-pressure zone is transferred to the high-pressure economizer by a booster pump. This economizer heats up the water to its saturation temperature. This saturated water goes through the high-temperature zone of the boiler and is supplied to the high-pressure turbine.

=== Supplementary firing ===
The HRSG can be designed to burn supplementary fuel after the gas turbine. Supplementary burners are also called &quot;duct burners&quot;. Duct burning is possible because the turbine exhaust gas (flue gas) still contains some oxygen. Temperature limits at the gas turbine inlet force the turbine to use excess air, above the optimal stoichiometric ratio to burn the fuel. Often in gas turbine designs part of the compressed air flow bypasses the burner in order to cool the turbine blades. The turbine exhaust is already hot, so a regenerative air preheater is not required as in a conventional steam plant. However, a fresh air fan blowing directly into the duct permits a duct-burning steam plant to operate even when the gas turbine cannot.

Without supplementary firing, the &quot;thermal efficiency&quot; of a combined cycle power plant is higher. But more flexible plant operations make a marine CCGT safer by permitting a ship to operate with equipment failures. A flexible stationary plant can &quot;make more money.&quot; Duct burning raises the flue temperature, which increases the quantity or temperature of the steam (e.g. to 84 bar, 525 degree Celsius). This improves the efficiency of the steam cycle. Supplementary firing lets the plant respond to fluctuations of electrical load, because duct burners can have very good efficiency with partial loads. It can enable higher steam production to compensate for the failure of another unit. Also, coal can be burned in the steam generator as an economical supplementary fuel.

Supplementary firing can raise exhaust temperatures from 600 °C (GT exhaust) to 800 or even 1000 °C. Supplemental firing does not raise the efficiency of most combined cycles. For single boilers it can raise the efficiency if fired to 700–750 °C; for multiple boilers however, the flexibility of the plant should be the major attraction.

&quot;Maximum supplementary firing&quot; is the condition when the maximum fuel is fired with the oxygen available in the gas turbine exhaust.

=== Combined cycle advanced Rankine subatmospheric reheating ===
== Fuel for combined cycle power plants ==

Combined cycle plants are usually powered by natural gas, although fuel oil, synthesis gas or other fuels can be used. The supplementary fuel may be natural gas, fuel oil, or coal. Biofuels can also be used. Integrated solar combined cycle power stations combine the energy harvested from solar radiation with another fuel to cut fuel costs and environmental impact (See: ISCC section). Many next generation nuclear power plants can use the higher temperature range of a Brayton top cycle, as well as the increase in thermal efficiency offered by a Rankine bottoming cycle.

Where the extension of a gas pipeline is impractical or cannot be economically justified, electricity needs in remote areas can be met with small-scale combined cycle plants using renewable fuels. Instead of natural gas, these gasify and burn agricultural and forestry waste, which is often readily available in rural areas.

===Managing low-grade fuels in turbines===
Gas turbines burn mainly natural gas and light oil. Crude oil, residual, and some distillates contain corrosive components and as such require fuel treatment equipment. In addition, ash deposits from these fuels result in gas turbine deratings of up to 15%. They may still be economically attractive fuels however, particularly in combined-cycle plants.

Sodium and potassium are removed from residual, crude and heavy distillates by a water washing procedure. A simpler and less expensive purification system will do the same job for light crude and light distillates. A magnesium additive system may also be needed to reduce the corrosive effects if vanadium is present. Fuels requiring such treatment must have a separate fuel-treatment plant and a system of accurate fuel monitoring to assure reliable, low-maintenance operation of gas turbines.

===Hydrogen===

Xcel Energy is going to build two natural gas power plants in the Midwestern United States that can mix 30% hydrogen with the natural gas. Intermountain Power Plant is being retrofitted to a natural gas/hydrogen power plant that can run on 30% hydrogen as well, and is scheduled to run on pure hydrogen by 2045. However others think low-carbon hydrogen should be used for things which are harder to decarbonize, such as making fertilizer, so there may not be enough for electricity generation.

== Configuration ==
Combined-cycle systems can have single-shaft or multi-shaft configurations. Also, there are several configurations of steam systems.

The most fuel-efficient power generation cycles use an unfired heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) with modular pre-engineered components. These unfired steam cycles are also the lowest in initial cost, and they are often part of a single shaft system that is installed as a unit.

Supplementary-fired and multishaft combined-cycle systems are usually selected for specific fuels, applications or situations. For example, cogeneration combined-cycle systems sometimes need more heat, or higher temperatures, and electricity is a lower priority. Multishaft systems with supplementary firing can provide a wider range of temperatures or heat to electric power. Systems burning low quality fuels such as brown coal or peat might use relatively expensive closed-cycle helium turbines as the topping cycle to avoid even more expensive fuel processing and gasification that would be needed by a conventional gas turbine.

A typical single-shaft system has one gas turbine, one steam turbine, one generator and one heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). The gas turbine and steam turbine are both coupled in tandem to a single electrical generator on a single shaft. This arrangement is simpler to operate, smaller, with a lower startup cost.

Single-shaft arrangements can have less flexibility and reliability than multi-shaft systems. With some expense, there are ways to add operational flexibility: Most often, the operator desires to operate the gas turbine as a peaking plant. In these plants, the steam turbine&#x27;s shaft can be disconnected with a synchro-self-shifting (SSS) clutch, for start up or for simple cycle operation of the gas turbine. Another less common set of options enable more heat or standalone operation of the steam turbine to increase reliability: Duct burning, perhaps with a fresh air blower in the duct and a clutch on the gas turbine side of the shaft.

A multi-shaft system usually has only one steam system for up to three gas turbines. Having only one large steam turbine and heat sink has economies of scale and can have lower cost operations and maintenance. A larger steam turbine can also use higher pressures, for a more efficient steam cycle. However, a multi-shaft system is about 5% higher in initial cost.

The overall plant size and the associated number of gas turbines required can also determine which type of plant is more economical. A collection of single shaft combined cycle power plants can be more costly to operate and maintain, because there are more pieces of equipment. However, it can save interest costs by letting a business add plant capacity as it is needed.

Multiple-pressure reheat steam cycles are applied to combined-cycle systems with gas turbines with exhaust gas temperatures near 600 °C. Single- and multiple-pressure non-reheat steam cycles are applied to combined-cycle systems with gas turbines that have exhaust gas temperatures of 540 °C or less. Selection of the steam cycle for a specific application is determined by an economic evaluation that considers a plant&#x27;s installed cost, fuel cost and quality, duty cycle, and the costs of interest, business risks, and operations and maintenance.

== Efficiency ==

By combining both gas and steam cycles, high input temperatures and low output temperatures can be achieved. 
The efficiency of the cycles add, because they are powered by the same fuel source. 
So, a combined cycle plant has a thermodynamic cycle that operates between the gas-turbine&#x27;s high firing temperature and the waste heat temperature from the condensers of the steam cycle. 
This large range means that the Carnot efficiency of the cycle is high. 
The actual efficiency, while lower than the Carnot efficiency, is still higher than that of either plant on its own.

The electric efficiency of a combined cycle power station, if calculated as electric energy produced as a percentage of the lower heating value of the fuel consumed, can be over 60% when operating new, i.e. unaged, and at continuous output which are ideal conditions.

As with single cycle thermal units, combined cycle units may also deliver low temperature heat energy for industrial processes, district heating and other uses. This is called cogeneration and such power plants are often referred to as a combined heat and power (CHP) plant.

In general, combined cycle efficiencies in service are over 50% on a lower heating value and Gross Output basis. 
Most combined cycle units, especially the larger units, have peak, steady-state efficiencies on the LHV basis of 55 to 59%.

A limitation of combined cycles is that efficiency is reduced when not running at continuous output. During start up, the second cycle can take time to start up. Thus efficiency is initially much lower until the second cycle is running, which can take an hour or more.

===Fuel heating value===

Heat engine efficiency can be based on the fuel Higher Heating Value (HHV), including latent heat of vaporisation that would be recuperated in condensing boilers, or the Lower Heating Value (LHV), excluding it.
The HHV of methane is , compared to a LHV: a 11% increase.

===Boosting efficiency===

Efficiency of the turbine is increased when combustion can run hotter, so the working fluid expands more. Therefore, efficiency is limited by whether the first stage of turbine blades can survive higher temperatures. Cooling and materials research are continuing. A common technique, adopted from aircraft, is to pressurise hot-stage turbine blades with coolant. This is also bled-off in proprietary ways to improve the aerodynamic efficiencies of the turbine blades. Different vendors have experimented with different coolants. Air is common but steam is increasingly used. Some vendors might now utilize single-crystal turbine blades in the hot section, a technique already common in military aircraft engines.

The efficiency of CCGT and GT can also be boosted by pre-cooling combustion air. This increases its density, also increasing the expansion ratio of the turbine. This is practised in hot climates and also has the effect of increasing power output. This is achieved by evaporative cooling of water using a moist matrix placed in the turbine&#x27;s inlet, or by using Ice storage air conditioning. The latter has the advantage of greater improvements due to the lower temperatures available. Furthermore, ice storage can be used as a means of load control or load shifting since ice can be made during periods of low power demand and, potentially in the future the anticipated high availability of other resources such as renewables during certain periods.

Combustion technology is a proprietary but very active area of research, because fuels, gasification and carburation all affect fuel efficiency. A typical focus is to combine aerodynamic and chemical computer simulations to find combustor designs that assure complete fuel burn up, yet minimize both pollution and dilution of the hot exhaust gases. Some combustors inject other materials, such air or steam, to reduce pollution by reducing the formation of nitrates and ozone.

Another active area of research is the steam generator for the Rankine cycle. Typical plants already use a two-stage steam turbine, reheating the steam between the two stages. When the heat-exchangers&#x27; thermal conductivity can be improved, efficiency improves. As in nuclear reactors, tubes might be made thinner (e.g. from stronger or more corrosion-resistant steel). Another approach might use silicon carbide sandwiches, which do not corrode.

There is also some development of modified Rankine cycles. Two promising areas are ammonia/water mixtures, and turbines that utilize supercritical carbon dioxide.

Modern CCGT plants also need software that is precisely tuned to every choice of fuel, equipment, temperature, humidity and pressure. When a plant is improved, the software becomes a moving target. CCGT software is also expensive to test, because actual time is limited on the multimillion-dollar prototypes of new CCGT plants. Testing usually simulates unusual fuels and conditions, but validates the simulations with selected data points measured on actual equipment.

===Competition===

There is active competition to reach higher efficiencies. 
Research aimed at turbine inlet temperature has led to even more efficient combined cycles.

Nearly 60% LHV efficiency (54% HHV efficiency) was reached in the Baglan Bay power station, using a GE H-technology gas turbine with a NEM 3 pressure reheat boiler, using steam from the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) to cool the turbine blades.

In May 2011 Siemens AG announced they had achieved a 60.75% efficiency with a 578 megawatt SGT5-8000H gas turbine at the Irsching Power Station.

The Chubu Electric’s Nishi-ku, Nagoya power plant 405 MW 7HA is expected to have 62% gross combined cycle efficiency.

On April 28, 2016, the plant run by Électricité de France in Bouchain was certified by Guinness World Records as the world&#x27;s most efficient combined cycle power plant at 62.22%. It uses a General Electric 9HA, that claimed 41.5% simple cycle efficiency and 61.4% in combined cycle mode, with a gas turbine output of 397 MW to 470 MW and a combined output of 592 MW to 701 MW. Its firing temperature is between , its overall pressure ratio is 21.8 to 1.

In December 2016, Mitsubishi claimed a LHV efficiency of greater than 63% for some members of its J Series turbines.

In December 2017, GE claimed 64% in its latest 826 MW HA plant, up from 63.7%. They said this was due to advances in additive manufacturing and combustion. Their press release said that they planned to achieve 65% by the early 2020s.

==Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC)==

An integrated gasification combined cycle, or IGCC, is a power plant using synthesis gas (syngas). Syngas can be produced from a number of sources, including coal and biomass. The system uses gas and steam turbines, the steam turbine operating from the heat left over from the gas turbine. This process can raise electricity generation efficiency to around 50%.

==Integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC)==
An Integrated Solar Combined Cycle (ISCC) is a hybrid technology in which a solar thermal field is integrated within a combined cycle plant. In ISCC plants, solar energy is used as an auxiliary heat supply, supporting the steam cycle, which results in increased generation capacity or a reduction of fossil fuel use.

Thermodynamic benefits are that daily steam turbine startup losses are eliminated.

Major factors limiting the load output of a combined cycle power plant are the allowed pressure and temperature transients of the steam turbine and the heat recovery steam generator waiting times to establish required steam chemistry conditions and warm-up times for the balance of plant and the main piping system. Those limitations also influence the fast start-up capability of the gas turbine by requiring waiting times. And waiting gas turbines consume gas. The solar component, if the plant is started after sunshine, or before, if there is heat storage, allows the preheat of the steam to the required conditions. That is, the plant is started faster and with less consumption of gas before achieving operating conditions. Economic benefits are that the solar components costs are 25% to 75% those of a Solar Energy Generating Systems plant of the same collector surface.

The first such system to come online was the Archimede combined cycle power plant, Italy in 2010, followed by Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center in Florida, and in 2011 by the Kuraymat ISCC Power Plant in Egypt, Yazd power plant in Iran, Hassi R&#x27;mel in Algeria, Ain Beni Mathar in Morocco. In Australia CS Energy&#x27;s Kogan Creek and Macquarie Generation&#x27;s Liddell Power Station started construction of a solar Fresnel boost section (44 MW and 9 MW), but the projects never became active.

== Bottoming cycles ==
In most successful combined cycles, the bottoming cycle for power is a conventional steam Rankine cycle.

It is already common in cold climates (such as Finland) to drive community heating systems from a steam power plant&#x27;s condenser heat. Such cogeneration systems can yield theoretical efficiencies above 95%.

Bottoming cycles producing electricity from the steam condenser&#x27;s heat exhaust are theoretically possible, but conventional turbines are uneconomically large. The small temperature differences between condensing steam and outside air or water require very large movements of mass to drive the turbines.

Although not reduced to practice, a vortex of air can concentrate the mass flows for a bottoming cycle. Theoretical studies of the Vortex engine show that if built at scale it is an economical bottoming cycle for a large steam Rankine cycle power plant.

== Combined cycle hydrogen power plant ==

A combined cycle hydrogen power plant is a power plant that uses hydrogen in a combined cycle power plant. A green hydrogen combined cycle power plant is only about 40% efficient, after electrolysis and reburning for electricity, and is a viable option for energy storage for longer term compared to battery storage. Natural gas power plants could be converted to hydrogen power plants with minimal renovation or do a combined mix of natural gas and hydrogen.

===Retrofitting natural gas power plants===

Natural gas power plants could be designed with a transition to hydrogen in mind by having wider inlet pipes to the burner to increase flow rates because hydrogen is less dense than natural gas, and have the right material because hydrogen can cause hydrogen embrittlement. 

===Limitations===

Current electrolysis plants are not capable of providing the scale of hydrogen that is needed to provide for a large scale power plant. On site electrolysis may be needed, then storing large amounts of hydrogen could take up a lot of space if it is only compressed hydrogen and not Liquid hydrogen. Hydrogen embrittlement could happen in pipelines, but 316L stainless steel pipelines could handle compressed hydrogen above 50 Bar (unit), which is what compressed natural gas is piped at, or wider pipelines could be built for hydrogen. Polyethylene or fiber-reinforced polymer pipelines coule also be used.

====Nitrous oxide====
When hydrogen is burned as a fuel no carbon dioxide is produced, but more nitrous oxide is produced because of the higher flame temperature from hydrogen, a selective catalytic reduction process could be implemented to break NO₂ down into just nitrogen and water. The exhaust from a burning hydrogen reaction is water vapor and could be used as a diluent to lower the high burning temp that creates the nitrous oxide.

====Corrosion====
Corrosion of the turbine from the water vapor from the hydrogen flame could reduce plant life or parts may need to be replaced more often.

====Fuel handling====
Hydrogen is the smallest and lightest element and can leak more easily at connection points and joints. Hydrogen diffuses quickly mitigating explosions. A hydrogen flame is also not as visible as a standard flame.

===Transition to a renewable power grid===

Wind and solar power are variable renewable energy sources that aren&#x27;t as consistent as base load energy. Hydrogen could help renewables by capturing excess energy, with electrolysis, when they produce too much, and fill the gaps with that energy when they aren&#x27;t producing as much.

<text>USS &quot;Bataan&quot; (LHD-5) is a in the United States Navy. The ship is named after the Battle of Bataan, fought in the Philippines during World War II. The ship enables the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps team to seamlessly transition from the sea to a land battle, as the lead ship and centerpiece of an Amphibious Ready Group. She is capable of amphibious assault, advance force, and special purpose operations, as well as evacuation and humanitarian assistance.

==Commissioning==
Ship&#x27;s sponsor, Linda Sloan Mundy, wife of former Marine Corps Commandant Gen Carl E. Mundy, Jr., christened the new ship &quot;in the name of the United States and in honor of the heroic defenders of Bataan&quot; at Ingalls Shipbuilding, Pascagoula, Mississippi. More than 100 members of veterans groups associated with both the Battle of Bataan and the infamous &quot;Bataan Death March&quot; that followed, as well as the Battle of Corregidor, and the aircraft carrier , were at the christening ceremony. She was launched on 15 March 1996, and commissioned on 20 September 1997. Her homeport is Norfolk, Virginia.

==Capabilities==
&quot;Bataan&quot; enables the Navy and Marine Corps team to seamlessly transition from the sea to a land battle, as the lead ship and centerpiece of an Amphibious Ready Group (ARG). The ship is capable of amphibious assault, advance force, and special purpose operations, as well as evacuation and humanitarian assistance.

==History==
===2001–2003: Operation Enduring Freedom===
The USS &quot;Bataan&quot; ARG were the first ships to respond after the 11 September 2001 attacks. The ship was home on leave during the attack, and was scheduled to be deployed on 19 September 2001. The crew was called back early from leave and the ship headed for New York Harbor, as she is capable of acting as a 600-bed hospital ship with surgical suites on board. Once it was determined there were few survivors from the attack, &quot;Bataan&quot; returned to Norfolk, Virginia. The ship&#x27;s crew prepared and onloaded the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit with gear both pierside in Norfolk, and off the coast of North Carolina from Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point and Camp Lejeune. The &quot;Bataan&quot; ARG delivered more than 2,500 Marines and their equipment to Pakistan, with the aim to enter Afghanistan, thus opening Operation Enduring Freedom. The &quot;Bataan&quot; ARG stayed on station off the coast of Pakistan and completed the longest sustained amphibious assault in U.S. history, with sailors not touching ground for over four months as they marched nearly 700 nautical miles into Afghanistan.

===2003–2007: Iraq War===
&quot;Bataan&quot; was one of many vessels in the Middle East region at the beginning of the Iraq War on or about 20 March 2003. After delivering her attack and transport helicopters, troops, and vehicles she was employed as a &quot;Harrier Carrier&quot; with primary duties supporting two Marine AV-8B Harrier II squadrons along with . She launched air strikes and close air support missions. She has made two deployments to the region since the invasion. For her third deployment, she joined the Fifth Fleet in the Gulf region, transiting the Suez Canal into the Red Sea on 30 January 2007.

===2005: Hurricane Katrina===
&quot;Bataan&quot; provided relief to the victims of category-4 Hurricane Katrina. She was positioned near New Orleans prior to Katrina making landfall on 29 August 2005, and began relief operations the following day. The ship&#x27;s helicopters were among the first to provide damage assessment. They went on to transport over 1,600 displaced persons to safety. &quot;Bataan&quot; delivered more than of cargo and 8,000 U.S. gallons (30,000 liters) of fresh water to the area. The ship served as a base for two fly-away medical teams, consisting of 84 medical professionals, who provided emergency medical care in New Orleans.

===2005: Evaluation of V-22 Osprey===
&quot;Bataan&quot; served as a naval testbed for the evaluation of the V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft in September 2005. This work included OPEVAL II operational and live fire tests, and was accomplished with eight Ospreys. In 2009, &quot;Bataan&quot; became the first Navy ship to host an operational squadron of V-22 rotorcraft when she embarked ten Ospreys of the VMM-263.

===2008: Hurricane Gustav===
In September 2008, &quot;Bataan&quot; participated in the HURREX exercise where the U.S. Second Fleet directed tests designed to evaluate the ship&#x27;s ability to respond to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief needs during the 2008 hurricane season. She was ordered to be prepared to deploy in the event that the Navy was directed to provide assistance to civilian authorities after Hurricane Gustav came ashore.

===2008: Use as a prison ship===
In June 2008, the UK-based human rights organization Reprieve issued a report that listed &quot;Bataan&quot; as one of up to 17 ships they believed were used to imprison terrorism suspects. On 2 June 2008, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that &quot;The US had admitted that &quot;Bataan&quot; and were used as prison ships between December 2001 and January 2002&quot;.

===2010: Haiti earthquake===
On 13 January 2010, &quot;Bataan&quot; was ordered to assist in the humanitarian relief efforts following the 7.0 magnitude 2010 Haiti earthquake. She was deployed to Grand-Goâve, and returned home 1 April 2010.

===2011: Libya and Italy ===
On 23 March 2011, &quot;Bataan&quot; was deployed to Italy to assist in enforcing the no-fly zone over Libya.

===2014: Air campaign in Iraq===
During the 2014 air campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, AV-8B Harriers from &quot;Bataan&quot; participated in reconnaissance missions and at least one air strike, including the first use of Marine Corps ordnance against an ISIS-controlled target.

===2016: Mark VI patrol boat operations===
In May 2016, &quot;Bataan&quot; conducted well deck operations with the Mark VI patrol boat, demonstrating the capability to launch and dock the 85 ft patrol boat with an amphibious assault ship. This was the first time the Mark VI operated out of an LHD, and the second time it operated out of a well deck overall.

===2020: Iran&#x27;s increasing threat and tensions===
The &quot;Bataan&quot; served as a operations center for activities in the Persian Gulf after the assassination of Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The ship was tasked to be on standby for potential retaliation from Iran and Iranian-backed paramilitary forces such as Hezbollah or Houthis.

===2022===
On 19 January 2022, &quot;Bataan&quot; completed a 16-month maintenance at Norfolk.

===2023: The Red Sea Crisis===
On 10 July 2023, &quot;Bataan&quot; ARG, comprising &quot;Bataan&quot;, , and , departed Norfolk for a scheduled deployment. On 11 October 2023, while operating in the Persian Gulf &quot;Bataan&quot;, with the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable), along with &quot;Carter Hall&quot;, were ordered to leave exercises off Kuwait to potentially sail to the Mediterranean due to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The &quot;Bataan&quot; and &quot;Carter Hall&quot; operated in the Red Sea from October to December 2023 before transiting the Suez Canal north to the eastern Mediterranean Sea.

===2024===
In January 2024 during the Red Sea crisis one of the Harriers was modified for air defense; its pilot Captain Ehrhart is reported to have shot down seven Houthi suicide attack drones. In May 2024 &quot;Bataan&quot;, was part of Fleet Week at Port Miami in Florida and also Fleet Week at the Manhattan Cruise Terminal in New York.

<text>USS &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; (LHD-7) (landing helicopter dock) is a of the United States Navy. The ship was named for the Battle of Iwo Jima of World War II. The ship was commissioned in 2001 and is in service.

==Construction and career==
Fabrication work for &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; began at Ingalls shipyard on 3 September 1996, and the ship&#x27;s keel was laid on 12 December 1997. At the keel laying ceremony, United States Army Captain Jacklyn H. Lucas, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions while serving as a Marine at the Battle of Iwo Jima, placed his Medal of Honor citation in the hull of the ship, where it remains today. She was launched on 4 February 2000. USS &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; was christened by her sponsor, Mrs. Zandra Krulak, wife of General Charles C. Krulak, the former Commandant of the Marine Corps, in Pascagoula, Mississippi on 25 March 2000. The commissioning crew moved aboard in April 2001, and made the ship&#x27;s maiden voyage on 23 June 2001, accompanied by more than 2,000 World War II veterans – many of them survivors of the Battle of Iwo Jima. She was commissioned a week later in Pensacola, Florida, on 30 June 2001.

Shortly thereafter, the ship and crew began an accelerated Inter Deployment Training Cycle, which tested virtually every system on board in realistic combat conditions. &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; was also the first ship on the waterfront open to the public after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. In 2002, &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; participated in Fleet Week in New York City.

==Ship&#x27;s history==
===2003===

&quot;Iwo Jima&quot; and the Marines of the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (26 MEU) along with two other amphibious assault ships formed the &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; Amphibious Ready Group. &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; left port on 4 March 2003 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and deployed Marines in April 2003 from the Mediterranean Sea into Northern Iraq for the Iraq War. In July 2003, &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; deployed to the coast of Liberia as part of JTF Liberia in response to the Second Liberian Civil War. During this operation, the Southern European Task Force (SETAF) as the command element of JTF Liberia and &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; with the 26 MEU landed Marines in Liberia to perform humanitarian assessments. &quot;At its height, JTF Liberia consisted of over 5,000 service members from the SETAF headquarters, the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, the three-ship &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; Amphibious Ready Group, 3rd Air Force&#x27;s 398th Air Expeditionary Group, U.S. Army Europe&#x27;s 21st Theater Support Command, and Army Special Forces.&quot;

===2004–2005===

In 2004, &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; participated in Fleet Week. &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; served as the 2nd Fleet flagship in 2005, based out of Norfolk, Virginia.

===Hurricane Katrina===

On 31 August 2005, &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; was sortied to the Gulf of Mexico to provide disaster relief and to conduct support operations in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; sailed up the Mississippi River to the city of New Orleans to directly support relief operations and act as the central command center for all federal, state and local disaster recovery operations.

During this critical period, &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; also served as the region&#x27;s only fully functional air field for helicopter operations, conducting over one thousand flight deck operations; provided hot meals, showers, drinking water, and berthing to thousands of National Guardsmen and relief workers; provided medical services, including first aid and surgical services, for disaster victims; and conducted clean-up operations in the city and suburbs of New Orleans.

&quot;Iwo Jima&quot; served as flagship for the commander-in-chief, George W. Bush, during Hurricane Katrina Joint Task Force, and is only the second Navy ship to have been presented the flag of the president of the United States.

===2006===
On 6 June 2006, &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; left her homeport of Norfolk, Virginia, and began a regularly scheduled six-month deployment to the U.S. European Command and U.S. Central Command area of responsibilities, as flagship for the &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; Expeditionary Strike Group, encompassing 6,000 sailors and Marines. The ship was also a part of the evacuation effort of American citizens from the conflict in Lebanon.

News reports on 15 July 2006 stated that &quot;Iwo Jima&quot;, flagship of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, would be used to evacuate U. S. citizens from Lebanon after the Israeli Defense Force made the Beirut International Airport unusable through bombing its runways and fuel storage areas.

===2007===
On 16 February 2007, &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; was awarded the 2006 Battle &quot;E&quot; award.

On 3 November 2010, &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; was deployed to Haiti in anticipation of providing humanitarian assistance due to an impending Tropical Storm Tomas.

On 27 March 2012, &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; was deployed as part of the &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; Amphibious Ready Group with Marines from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit supporting maritime security operations and security cooperation efforts in the U.S. 5th and 6th Fleet areas of responsibility.

On 11 April 2012, an MV-22 from VMM-261 crashed near Agadir, Morocco, during a joint training exercise after taking off from USS &quot;Iwo Jima&quot;. Two US Marine crew chiefs were killed and the two pilots were seriously injured.
Early in May 2012, &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; was operating in the Gulf of Aqaba and in the south of the Red Sea. In November 2012, &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; was dispatched to the eastern Mediterranean, during escalating warfare between Israel and Hamas, in case the evacuation of U.S. citizens from Israel was required, delaying the scheduled return of &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; to Norfolk.

In December 2021, &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; shifted homeports from Naval Station Mayport to Naval Station Norfolk as a part of the Navy&#x27;s plan to consolidate the East Coast-based amphibious ships to the Norfolk area.

==Awards==
* Admiral James Flatley Memorial Award for Naval Aviation Safety - (2003, 2015, 2018, 2021)

==Motto==
The ship&#x27;s motto, &quot;Uncommon Valor&quot;, is based on Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz&#x27;s words when he spoke of Sailors and Marines who fought at Iwo Jima: &quot;Among the Americans who served on Iwo Jima, uncommon valor was a common virtue.&quot;

<text>A center fielder, abbreviated CF, is the outfielder in baseball who plays defense in center field – the baseball and softball fielding position between left field and right field. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the center fielder is assigned the number 8.

==Position description==
Outfielders must cover large distances, so speed, instincts and quickness to react to the ball are key. They must be able to catch fly balls above their heads and on the run. They must be able to throw the ball accurately over a long distance to be effective.

As well as the requirements above, the center fielder must be the outfielder who has the best combination of speed and throwing distance. The center fielder &quot;covers more &#x27;grass&#x27; than any other player&quot; (see photo) and, most likely, will catch the most fly balls. The position also has the greatest responsibility among the three outfielders for coordinating their play to prevent collisions when converging on a fly ball, and on plays where the center fielder does not make the catch, he must position himself behind the corner outfielder as backup. The center outfielder is the captain of the outfield and has the authority to call off the corner fielders when he has a better chance to catch the ball. Aside from requiring more speed and range, the center field position is slightly easier to field because balls tend to fly on a straight path, rather than curving as they do for the other outfield positions. A center fielder&#x27;s vision and depth perception is a coveted skill and must be above average. Because the position requires a good arm and fast legs, center field is generally where the team puts its best all-around athletes; as a result, center fielders are often fine hitters as well. Many center fielders are renowned as excellent batters and base runners.
When a base runner is trying to steal second base the center fielder must back up second base on throws from the catcher to second base in case the second baseman misses the catch or it is a bad throw.

<text>Look and Learn was a British weekly educational magazine for children published by Fleetway Publications Ltd from 1962 until 1982. It contained educational text articles that covered a wide variety of topics from volcanoes to the Loch Ness Monster; a long running science fiction comic strip, &quot;The Trigan Empire&quot;; adaptations of famous works of literature into comic-strip form, such as &quot;Lorna Doone&quot;; and serialized works of fiction such as &quot;The First Men in the Moon&quot;.

The illustrators who worked on the magazine included Fortunino Matania, John Millar Watt, Peter Jackson, John Worsley, Ron Embleton, Gerry Embleton, C. L. Doughty, Wilf Hardy, Dan Escott, Angus McBride, Oliver Frey, James E. McConnell, Kenneth Lilly, R. B. Davis and Clive Uptton.

It featured the Pen-Friends pages, a section where readers could make new friends overseas.

==Pre-publication history==
&quot;Look and Learn&quot; was the brainchild of Leonard Matthews, the editorial director of juvenile publications at Fleetway Publications which was already publishing the long-running &quot;Children&#x27;s Newspaper&quot;. An early attempt by Matthews to launch a new educational title along the lines of Italian educational magazines &quot;Conoscere&quot; and &quot;La Vita Meravigliosa&quot; had been turned down by the board of directors.

A British edition of &quot;Conoscere&quot; was brought out in 1961 under the title &quot;Knowledge&quot; and Matthews reassessed his original proposal and approached the board again, this time receiving the go-ahead to produce a dummy of the proposed magazine.

The dummy was put together by the firm&#x27;s Experimental Art Department headed by David Roberts and Trevor Newton. David Stone, a former sub-editor with &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, was appointed editor and, with the dummy approved, the magazine began publication. John Sanders replaced Stone as editor before the new title reached the newsstands.

==Publication history==
The first issue of &quot;Look and Learn&quot; was dated 20 January 1962, and contained a wide spectrum of features ranging from articles on history (Rome, the Houses of Parliament, the story of King Charles I, &quot;The Dover Road&quot;, &quot;From Then Till Now&quot;), science (&quot;Eyes on Outer Space&quot;), geography and geology (The Grand Canyon, &quot;The Quest for Oil&quot;), art (Vincent van Gogh), nature (&quot;The story of a seed&quot;, &quot;Your Very Own Basset Hound&quot;), literature (The Arabian Nights, and its editor Sir Richard Burton), and travel (&quot;The Children of Tokio&quot;). The debut issue also contained the first episodes of &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; by Jerome K. Jerome and &quot;The Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot; by Henry Treece, and a feature on the founding of the World Wildlife Fund.

The first issue of the magazine sold about 700,000 copies and settled down to a regular sale of over 300,000 copies a week. Its success has been put down to the high quality of the magazine&#x27;s content. Historian Steve Holland said, &quot;The premise of &quot;Look and Learn&quot; was to delight and inspire the imaginations of its young readers. To advance this principle, the features were clearly and briskly written and illustrated by some of the finest artists of the era resulting in a magazine of unmatched quality.&quot;

The first major change to the contents of the magazine came in 1966 when it incorporated &quot;Ranger&quot; with issue 232 (25 June 1966). The amalgamation brought with it a number of comic strips including &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Trigan Empire&quot;, written by Mike Butterworth and drawn by Don Lawrence, and the French comic strip &quot;Asterix&quot;, translated into English. The adventure &quot;Asterix and Cleopatra&quot; appears under the title &quot;In the Days of Good Queen Cleo&quot;, with the Gauls turned into Ancient Britons and Asterix and Obelix renamed &quot;Beric&quot; and &quot;Doric&quot;.

This amalgamation was overseen by recently appointed editor John Davies who had replaced Sanders when the latter left to edit the short-lived &quot;Ranger&quot; in 1965. Davies had previously edited &quot;The Children&#x27;s Newspaper&quot; until it merged with &quot;Look and Learn&quot; (issue 173, 8 May 1965).

It amalgamated with its competitor &quot;Finding Out&quot; in 1967.

Davies continued the magazine with the same mixture as before (the page count of the magazine having increased from 32 pages to 36 to accommodate the additional content), as did the editors who followed him, Andy Vincent (1969–1977) and Jack Parker (1977–1982).

The magazine absorbed &quot;World of Wonder&quot; in March 1975, and &quot;Speed &amp; Power&quot; with issue no. 724 (29 November 1975).

Under Parker&#x27;s editorship the magazine underwent a facelift with issue 844 (18 March 1978), absorbed &quot;World of Knowledge&quot; in early 1981, and celebrated its 1,000th issue on 9 May 1981. Sales had been declining throughout the 1970s, a decade which saw the price of the magazine rise from 7½ pence to 30 pence due to sharply increasing production costs. Price increases in the early 1980s added a further 10 pence to the weekly cost, and the editor admitted &quot;we simply do not sell enough to meet the very heavy cost of producing a magazine of the quality of &quot;Look and Learn&quot; and we are therefore unable to continue publication.&quot;

&quot;Look and Learn&quot; folded with issue 1049, dated 17 April 1982.

<text>Ambrogio Calepino (Latin: &quot;Ambrosius Calepinus&quot;; c. 1440–1510), commonly known by the Latin form of his name, Calepinus, was an Italian lexicographer.

Calepino was born in Castelli Calepio and died in Bergamo. He entered the Augustinian Order in 1458.

==Works==
His Latin dictionary appeared first in 1502 at Reggio. It was reprinted many times during the 16th century, the Aldine press alone producing no fewer than 18 editions from 1542 to 1592. Later editions were considerably enlarged. To the Latin of the original were added equivalents in other languages. Thus we have the Basel edition (1590) which contains eleven languages: &quot;Ambrosii Calepini dictionarium undecim linguarum: respondent autem latinis vocabulis hebraica, græca, gallica, italica, germanica, belgica, hispanica, polonica, ungarica, anglica&quot;.

The edition in seven languages by Jacopo Facciolati (Pavia, 1718) with the assistance of Egidio Forcellini, was reprinted many times. Calepinus became a common name, a synonym of dictionary or lexicon, and we find titles like the following: &quot;Septem linguarum calepinus, hoc est, lexicon latinum&quot;. Calepino also wrote the life of John Bonus of Mantua which is found in the &quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot; for 22 October (&quot;Oct&quot;. IX, 748–767).

==Biography==
Ambrogio Calepio (known as Calepino), whose given name was Giacomo (but universally known as Ambrogio), was the natural son of Count Trussardo da Calepio and Caterina de Bucellenis of a wealthy and noble family of Bergamo at a date that, in the absence of certain documents, is placed between 1435 and 1440, in the vicinity of San Michele al Pozzo Bianco. Giacomo had two brothers: Marco, also a natural son, and Nicolino to whom the family property passed by inheritance.

Count Trussardo ensured a good education for his son by leaving him a fortune of two thousand liras tied to his attainment of his twenty-fifth birthday, such as the one hundred and fifty gold scudi left on deposit with the congregation of the Misericordia Maggiore left to him by Giovanni di Marco da Rudiano, always upon reaching his twenty-fifth birthday, who, following the tradition for cadets of noble families, or perhaps it was the obligatory tradition for those who were born out of wedlock, in 1458 entered the convent of the Order of Saint Augustine, where, in 1459 he took the name Ambrose. He lived through the period of the Catholic Reformation with the reforms of the orders by inserting himself in the promotion of the reform. On July 26, 1458, having attained the age of eighteen and emancipation, he renounced his father&#x27;s rich inheritance in favor of the observant congregation. Part of this was used for the creation of the gilded polyptych by Maestro of 1458 preserved in the Carrara Academy. Part of the inheritance was not given to the convent, but his brother Micolino, who managed it and was the young man&#x27;s guardian, divided it into several parts later disbursed. Thereafter a diatribe arose between Nicolino and the convent over the payment of the inheritance, Ambrogio, in a 1460 document stated that he was twenty years old, this would bring his date of birth to 1440.

After serving his novitiate in several monasteries in Lombard cities (Milan, Cremona, Brescia, and Mantua), he returned to his hometown where he was able to refine his knowledge, so much so that he began to devote himself to the preparation of a vocabulary, devoting himself to humanistic studies to delve into classical Latin texts believing that ancient cultures were fundamental to grasping the meaning of scripture. He also studied texts by secular authors, and did so for personal preparation. Despite being convinced that the classical works were perfect, he soon realized that their translation had some deficiencies and needed additions so he worked for the creation of a text that would help the reading of these texts.

The first edition of the Dictionarium latinum was published in 1502 by the Emilian printer Dionigi Bertocchi,after a good two decades of study by Calepio, but was considered incomplete due to omissions and inappropriate additions made by the printer himself. Calepio immediately set to work to improve and complete his work, quickly producing a second edition.

In the first edition, the dictionary was monolingual in Latin and contained many quotations. In contrast, the second edition, published in 1509, was in four languages: Hebrew language, Ancient Greek, Latin and Italian language. Calepius continued his lexicographical work but, partly due to the onset of Visual impairment, was unable to see the final result of his labors.

He died in his convent in 1511, and his work was completed by his brethren. The results were seen in 1520, when Bernardino Benaglio of Bergamo printed the 24th edition of the vocabulary, considered the definitive one. The work became famous throughout Europe as &quot;Calepino,&quot; in honor of its author, and its wide notoriety was also due to the fact that it later took on a polyglot character, with versions in numerous modern languages. As many as two hundred and eleven reissues were printed from 1502 to 1779, printings that led the work to undergo numerous changes.

In the Italian language, the word &quot;calepino&quot; has become Antonomasia term for &quot;vocabulary,&quot; also used in joking contexts.
