*The Shinyu Waterway—Built by Denbei Imazato
*:In the years before the building of this waterway in Myōreki 1 (1655) the people suffered from an insufficient water supply. This was because only small ponds and wells provided the main source of water for rice field irrigation. There was no rain before the rice-planting season of Shōō 3 (1654). A long spell of dry weather in August resulted in no harvest or rice seed for a future crop. Denbei Imazato, then chief of the Komiya area, called the chiefs of the 23 villages together. After coming to an agreement, he helped plan the building of a flood control channel from Saijo Hiramatsu Gokanoi Sluice (now Kakogawa) to Okie Komiya. Denbei then presented the plan to the lord of the domain and received permission to begin construction. The project started in 1655 and was completed in March 1656. The total length of the waterway was , and 164,000 workers were used in its construction. The improved irrigation system allowed water to reach some of field area. It was developed using the Gokanoi Sluice, an ancient type of irrigation system, and it was subsequently named the Shinyu Waterway.

==Noted people from Harima==
*Joseph Hiko—Father of the Japanese newspaper
*:Joseph &quot;Hikotaro&quot; Hiko (1837–1897), Joseph Heco, was born in Komiya, Harima. He was rescued at the age of 13, in 1850 from a shipwreck on Eiriki-maru. He was then taken to America by an American merchant. He was the first Japanese person to be naturalized as an American citizen in 1858. He was baptized as a Christian and chose the name &quot;Joseph Hiko&quot;. He was instrumental as a translator in forming the &quot;Treaty of Friendship&quot; between Japan and the United States. He also helped send delegations from the Tokugawa shogunate to the United States.
*:In addition, he published the first Japanese newspaper, Kaigai Shinbun, in 1864. It contained news of the world and a short overview of American history. Hiko&#x27;s nickname &quot;The Father of the Japanese Newspaper&quot; is a result of this achievement.
*:Hiko met U.S. President Lincoln in 1861, and came to know democracy at that time. He also met President Franklin Pierce. He had a long and successful career as a statesman, commercial agent, and translator. He visited Harima three times, and set up a tombstone for his parents. This tombstone is located at Rengeji Temple in Honjo. It is now commonly referred to as &quot;The Tombstone with European letters&quot;.
*:Hiko had a mixed relationship with his home country of Japan. Many Japanese people were not happy with the new outside foreign influences of the world coming into Japan. He was buried in Aoyama, Tokyo in the foreign section of the cemetery, as he was an American citizen. However, he has become quite a celebrated figure in Harima in recent years.
*Masaki Sumitani (H.G.) — Japanese Comedian, Actor, and Talent
*:Masaki Sumitani was born December 18, 1975, in Harima. He was a student at Harima Junior High School, and later attended Kakogawa Higashi Senior High school. His stage name is Razor Ramon HG, but is more commonly known as H.G. (Hard Gay). He appears on a variety of Japanese television shows.

<text>was a town located in Shikama District, Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. It actually is a group of 44 small islands (4 main inhabited ones and 40 smaller uninhabited ones) about 18 kilometers off the coast of Himeji and Akō. Ieshima is one of the big islands but the name &quot;Ieshima&quot; is also used to refer to the entire chain of Islands.

On March 27, 2006, the towns Ieshima, Yumesaki (also from Shikama District), Yasutomi (Shisō District), and Kōdera (Kanzaki District) were merged into the expanded city of Himeji and are no longer independent municipalities.

==Main islands==
*Ieshima (家島): 5.46 km2, about 4,000 inhabitants
*Bozejima (坊勢島): 1.87 km2, about 4,000 inhabitants
*Nishijima (西島): 6.59 km2, about 100 inhabitants
*Tangajima (男鹿島): 4.57 km2, about 150 inhabitants

Most of the population lives on Ieshima and Bozejima. Ieshima is divided into 2 &quot;hamlets&quot; called Miya and Maura. The two main industries of Ieshima are fishing and quarrying. Tangajima and Nishijima have been quarried for at least 400 years and supplied stones used in the building of Osaka Castle. The eastern part of Nishijima is maintained as a camping and recreation ground by Hyogo Prefecture. Ieshima is host to the annual Open Water Swim Competition which has been rapidly gaining fame as one of the most popular open water swim competitions in Japan. The race takes place between the islands of Tangajima and Ieshima.

==Transport==
Ieshima and Bozejima can be reached by a 35-minute boat ride from Himeji Port.

Sayō is located in ancient Harima Province, and the name appears in the Heian period &quot;Engishiki&quot; records. From the Kamakura period Hirafuku-juku prospered as a post town on the Inaba Kaidō, the main highway from Kyoto and Osaka to Inaba Province in western Japan, and in the Nanboku-chō period, the Akamatsu clan built Rikan Castle overlooking the town. In 1600, the Ikeda clan of Himeji Domain built three-story &quot;tenshu&quot; and established a cadet domain called &quot;Hirafuku Domain&quot; for Ikeda Teruoki. In 1697, the Tokugawa shogunate established Mikazuki Domain, who ruled parts of Sayō until the Meiji restoration in 1871. The villages of Sayo and Hirafuku were established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Both were elevated to town status on October 1, 1928. On March 1, 1955, Sayo and Hirafuku merged with the neighboring villages of Ekawa, Ishii and Nagatani to form the town of Sayō On October 1, 2005 the towns of Kōzuki, Mikazuki and Nankō, all from Sayō District were merged into Sayō.

<text>was a town in Shisō District, Hyōgo, Japan.

== Geography ==
Yamasaki translates as &quot;Mountain Cape&quot;, a reference to its seclusion amongst a range of forest-covered mountains. The extensive forest area provides the town&#x27;s biggest industry, logging. 

Yamasaki was about 45 minutes by car from the nearest city, Himeji, which is to the east.

The population was served by a large hospital, the administrative center of Shisō City, and a major intercity highway, the Chūgoku Expressway. There was no rail link, largely dictated by geography. There was one large high school, three junior high schools,

== Population ==
As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 25,629 and a density of 143.27 persons per km2. The total area was 178.89 km2.

== History ==
On April 1, 2005, Yamasaki, along with the towns of Chikusa, Haga and Ichinomiya (all from Shisō District), was merged to create the city of Shisō and no longer exists as an independent municipality.

The new Shisō City incorporates a number of local townships and villages, most significantly the castle town of Haga and Chikusa.

Yamasaki has existed as a town for about fifty years, but the area has been occupied since the Ōnin period in the fifteenth century, as its ancient &quot;Hachiman Shrine&quot; denotes. Today, it includes substantial rice paddy cultivation.

Yamazaki Anzai, an important Confucian scholar, had ancestry in the area and was Yamasaki&#x27;s best known personage.

<text>was a town in Kinosaki District, Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan.

==Merger==

==Tourism==

Kinosaki is a resort area, with &quot;onsen&quot; (Japanese hot springs). The Onsen town has a history of 1,300 years. In 1913, the writer Shiga Naoya came to Kinosaki and stayed there for three weeks. Kinosaki provided the inspiration for his short story, &quot;Kinosaki ni te&quot; or &quot;In Kinosaki&quot;.
=== Onsen Resort ===
There are seven public onsen bath houses in Kinosaki Onsen:

* Kouno-yu
* Mandara-yu
* Goshono-yu
* Ichino-yu
* Yanagi-yu

Tourists staying in many of the ryokans (Japanese traditional inns) in Kinosaki can receive a free pass to all seven. It is common for tourists staying in Kinosaki Onsen to walk around in yukata, this saves them having to change into their own clothes every time they use an onsen. A ropeway at the far end of the street transports visitors to the top of Mt. Taishi, which has views of the town and coastline, as well as a temple appropriately named Onsenji.

=== Museums ===

In addition to the onsens, tourists can visit the where they can participate in a straw craft-making workshop, the to learn about the writers of Kinosaki Onsen, as well as many shops and cafes.

<doc id="568403" wikidata="Q996325" url="?curid=568403" title="List of Billboard Hot 100 number ones of 1991">
<text>This is a list of the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] number-ones of 1991. The longest running number-one single of 1991 is &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot; by Bryan Adams, which attained seven weeks at number-one. (&quot;Black or White&quot; by Michael Jackson would also spend a total of seven weeks at #1, but only four of those weeks were in the 1991 calendar year.)

That year, 14 acts earn their first number one song, such as Surface, C+C Music Factory, Freedom Williams, Timmy T, Londonbeat, Hi-Five, Extreme, EMF, Color Me Badd, Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, Loleatta Holloway, Karyn White, The New Power Generation, and P.M. Dawn. Mariah Carey and Paula Abdul were the only acts to hit number one more than once, with Mariah Carey having the most with three and Paula Abdul having two.

The November 30 chart (&quot;Set Adrift on Memory Bliss&quot;) was the first Hot 100 to be compiled with Soundscan data.

== Chart history ==

An asterisk (*) by a date indicates an unpublished, &quot;frozen&quot; week, due to the special double issues that &quot;Billboard&quot; published in print at the end of the year for their year-end charts. This was the final year that there was no Hot 100 during this unpublished week. While the double issues continued beyond 1991, the charts themselves would still be compiled, available through their electronic and online services.

<text>Nobody Nowhere: The Extraordinary Autobiography of an Autistic Girl is the award-nominated debut book by Australian Donna Williams. It was initially published in Britain in 1992, and was on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for 15 weeks in the first half of 1993.

&quot;Nobody Nowhere&quot; covers Williams&#x27; life from as far back as she can remember (three years old). At times, she was thought to be deaf, psychotic, disturbed, or retarded, but only as an adult did she discover that her difficulty interfacing with the world around her was related to autism. It ends with her leaving the manuscript behind with a UK child psychiatrist, Sebastian Kraemer, who sent it on to autism specialist Frances Tustin, who was responsible for its eventual publication.

Donna Williams is also the author of the screenplay of the same name which is optioned to Hollywood film producer, Beverly Nero.

Williams released a music album by the same name in 2000.

&quot;Somebody Somewhere&quot; (1994) was the sequel. This installment picks up the story of her becoming a teacher and the first book becoming published, and how that changed her life. Later autobiographical works include &quot;Like Colour To The Blind&quot; (1998) and &quot;Everyday Heaven&quot; (2004), which are among her nine published books.

<doc id="568418" wikidata="Q6102453" url="?curid=568418" title="Izushi, Hyōgo">
<text>was a town in Izushi District, Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. It is now part of the city of Toyooka, Hyōgo.

==Demographics==
 Izushi district had an estimated population of 10,259.
Because of yearly flooding problems and cheaper modes of transit, Izushi&#x27;s ancient river port has long been closed. The railways were also taken out, leaving Izushi accessible by car, bus, and bike only. The average weather temperatures in the Toyooka area range between -3 °C (26 °F) in January to 35 °C (95 °F) in August.

On April 1, 2005, Izushi, along with the towns of Kinosaki, Hidaka and Takeno (all from Kinosaki District), and the town of Tantō (also from Izushi District), were merged into the expanded city of Toyooka. Izushi no longer exists as an independent municipality.

==Education==
Izushi Junior High School&#x27;s sister school is Whitman Middle School in Seattle. The short-term homestay program has been successful for both schools and has been running, with some exceptions, since March 1999.

==Tourism==
Izushi has castle ruins, a popular local scenic spot. The first and original castle&#x27;s location on top of Mount Ariko was too difficult for even the ruling family and their retainers to reach easily and, in 1604, it was moved to the base of the mountain. It is the second castle&#x27;s location which now a popular tourist spot and a beautiful backdrop for several local &quot;matsuri&quot; (festivals), such as the &quot;Kimono Matsuri&quot; (September), &quot;Kenka Danjiri&quot; (Fighting Floats—October), &quot;Oshiro Matsuri&quot; (Castle Festival—November) and &quot;Hatsu Uma&quot; (First Horseride—March). While the castle itself does not exist anymore, the two front guardhouses were restored in 1968. The original castle foundations are still on top of the mountain and are accessible by hiking only.
The most iconic image of Izushi is the &quot;Shinkoro&quot; clock tower. Built in the Meiji Era, the wooden clock&#x27;s name means &quot;eight o&#x27;clock drum tower&quot;. This is in reference to the old system of time in Japan, where &quot;shin&quot; was the starting point of the day between 7 o&#x27;clock to 9 o&#x27;clock. A drum would beat to call retainers to the castle to work and signal the businesses in the town that working hours had started. It was formerly part of the gate system into the castle, now only it has only a small moat filled with koi.

Izushi is known for being the traditional home of &quot;soba&quot; noodles in this area of Japan. It was said to have been brought to Izushi with the Sengoku family, when they were transferred by the Ashikaga Shogunate from Shinshu. Izushi soba has three distinctions that are key to its special flavor and consistency: grinding the buckwheat in a special way, kneading it to a certain thickness, and cooking them in a way to prevent them from becoming too soft. The soba should have a simple flavor and a slightly chewy texture. It is served cold, on small plates with a cup of cold broth and several optional ingredients to strengthen the broth flavor, such as grated daikon radish, wasabi, potato paste, chopped green onion, and a raw egg. Using hashi (chopsticks), the cold noodles are taken off one small plate and submerged in the broth cup.

Traditional white porcelain pottery, in Japanese called &quot;yakimono&quot;, is created and sold in small studio shops in downtown Izushi. The professionally made ceramics in this town are called &quot;Izushi yaki&quot;.

<doc id="568428" wikidata="Q5996327" url="?curid=568428" title="Ikuno, Hyōgo">
<text>was a town located in Asago District, Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 4,872 and a density of 43.50 persons per km2. The total area was 112.01 km2.

On April 1, 2005, Ikuno, along with the towns of Asago (former), Santō and Wadayama (all from Asago District), was merged to create the city of Asago and no longer exists as an independent municipality. It is the smallest town of the Asago District.

==Geography==
Ikuno is located at the geographical center of Hyogo prefecture. It borders the Harima district and Kamikawa town. Ikuno is elevated 300 meters above sea level and surrounded by mountains which composes 90% of the area. Maruyama river starts here and flows north into the Sea of Japan. Ichikawa river, which originates in Kurogawa (north-east Ikuno) flows through the town centre towards the inland sea. 

==Climate==
The township of Ikuno is located in a basin. During the summer months it remains relatively hot with high humidity levels. Autumn and Spring are short lived seasons. Due to the elevation of Ikuno it receives infrequent bouts of snow. Ikuno receives a lot of rain during the summer months and often ravaged by typhoons. The annual precipitation is approximately 2,000 mm. 
==History==
Mining was Ikuno&#x27;s first industry, dating back to 807. The discovery of silver in the mountains surrounding the town made it a miner&#x27;s hub. Mining continued here for nearly a thousand years, during which time copious amounts of copper and silver were mined. The town even was a POW camp during WWII. The mines were closed in the 1970s by Mitsubishi. Ikuno&#x27;s population peaked in 1955 with over 11,000 people. Today, Ikuno is a town with thriving industries.

==Tourist Attractions==

Many of Ikuno&#x27;s historical tourist spots can be access by walking from Ikuno train station. 

The Ikuno Silver Mine and Ikuno Mineral Museum are a famous and well known tourist spot in the area. Ore mining commenced soon after the warring state period in Japan (807 AD). This mine was also nicknamed, &quot;Tenryo&quot; as it was the main resource that financed the Tokugawa shogunate&#x27;s fortune. In 1889, the mine became Imperial property. The main vein of the mine is 2.6 km long and houses a depth of 1 km. The major produce were coal, lead, gold and silver. Unfortunately, due to lack of profit in its later years mining at Ikuno officially ceased in 1973. Eventually the mine was converted into an educational center and museum.

Ikuno is also the culinary birthplace of &quot;Hayashi rice&quot; a stew-like beef dish served with rice. Click here for a list of restaurants serving Hayashi rice in Ikuno. This dish was a common appearance on the dinner tables of the mine residents when the town was bustling during the mining periods. Visitors to the Mine can taste this specialty at the upstairs restaurant, &quot;Maronie&quot; (マロニエ). 
Ikuno Kogen Heights, a huge highland located in the north-west area of Ikuno. The mountain ranges are 600 meters above sea level. The Kassel hotel can be found here along with a golf course, tennis court and hiking courses. 

The Ikuno Ginzan lake is nearby and very scenic. It is an entirely man-made lake and also features a dam. The lake&#x27;s water is used for irrigation and industrial purposes downstream. Several recreational areas are available for picnics. Hiring a boat and/or fishing gear is also possible. Uogataki falls is nearby and is the local swimming spot. Further up the road is the Kurokawa valley. It is designated as the prefectural natural park of the Asago mountain range. The Kurokawa area also boosts a popular onsen and a dam.

Ikuno Castle was originally built circa 1394–1428 and its ruins can be found on the top of Kojozan (古城山) in the Kuchiganaya district of Ikuno. The castle acted as the local magistrate&#x27;s and the Silver mine&#x27;s administrative office in the Edo period until it was eventually abandoned.

The old tramcar road (pictured in the Kuchiganaya area above) is a remnant of the mineral transport system that was in place from the Kanagase mine tunnel to the old train station. It was built in 1920 and features several arches.

Another point of interest is the Takashi Shimura memorial and mining staff quarters (cooperate housing). Built in the Meiji era (1876) at peak the staff quarters was composed of 18 buildings. However, only 6 buildings remain and have undergone restoration and preservation efforts. One building is a dedicated memorial for the famous Japanese actor, Takashi Shimura. Shimura was born in the staff quarters where his father worked. Shimura acted in Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; and &quot;To Live&quot;.

==Notable Festivals==

April Heikurō Matsuri (へいくろう祭) was founded in 2000 and is held at Ikuno Ginzan. This festival is used to celebrate the mining history of the town.

August Toronagashi event - As a part of the Obon festivities during the summer holidays the community gather around the Ichikawa river. Hand-made paper lanterns decorated by the people are floated down the river.

September: Kanaya Matsuri (銀谷祭り) is an annual event that takes place on the streets of the Kuchikanaya area. There are performances by the locals and houses along participating streets run small merchant stores selling handicrafts, tools, produce and food. The festival is to commemorate the history of the area when merchants would line the streets.

<text>Donna Leanne Williams, also known by her married name Donna Leanne Samuel and as Polly Samuel (born Donna Keene; 12 October 1963 – 22 April 2017), was an Australian writer, artist, singer-songwriter, screenwriter, and sculptor.

In 1965, aged two, Williams was assessed as &quot;psychotic&quot;. During the rest of her childhood, she was tested multiple times for deafness and labelled as &quot;disturbed&quot;. In 1991, she was diagnosed as autistic and also underwent treatment for gut, immune system and sensory perceptual disorders. She wrote four memoirs: &quot;Nobody Nowhere: The Extraordinary Autobiography of an Autistic Girl&quot; (1992), &quot;Somebody Somewhere: Breaking Free from the World of Autism&quot; (1994), &quot;Like Colour to the Blind: Soul Searching and Soul Finding&quot; (1998) and &quot;Everyday Heaven: Journeys Beyond the Stereotypes of Autism&quot; (2004) – and released two albums, &quot;Nobody Nowhere&quot; and &quot;Mutation&quot;. She was the subject of several TV documentaries during the &#x27;90s.

Williams wrote textbooks on the autism spectrum and was a qualified teacher, international public speaker and autism consultant.

Williams died of cancer in April 2017.

==Early life and education==
Donna Leanne Williams was born Donna Keene in October 1963. She grew up in Melbourne with an older brother, James, and a younger brother, Tom Williams (the street artist Duel; born 1969). Her first name was chosen by her mother due to it being the Spanish word for &quot;female&quot;; however, her father referred to her as Polly, which led to her legally changing her name in 2015.

According to Williams, her earliest memories included &quot;rubbing her eyes furiously to lose herself in &#x27;bright spots of fluffy color&#x27;, which she found a soothing refuge against the &#x27;intrusive gabble&#x27; of the human world around her&quot;. Her father, Ellis John Keene, later known as Jack Williams (1936–1995), was bipolar and aloof, while her mother was an alcoholic who was physically and emotionally abusive.

In 1965, at the age of two, Williams was assessed as a psychotic infant; subsequently, throughout her childhood, she was tested multiple times for deafness and labelled as &quot;disturbed&quot;. Williams alleged on her blog that she had been sexually assaulted at the age of eight during a party held by her father. By the age of nine, she had developed two alternate personalities: &quot;Willie&quot;, her &quot;rebellious, disruptive, and bad-mannered side&quot; and &quot;Carol&quot;, the &quot;kind, polite, socially acceptable child&quot;. That year, she was also diagnosed with various dietary conditions including &quot;milk allergies, dairy [and] gluten intolerances[; and] salicylate intolerance&quot; and was placed on a multivitamin and zinc regime. At fifteen, Williams left home and worked in various jobs but struggled to support herself. At times she was homeless, passing from boyfriend to boyfriend while suffering &quot;gross cruelty and domestic prostitution in relationships with men&quot;.

With the help of a psychiatric social worker, Williams finished secondary education and enrolled in tertiary studies. From 1982, Williams started studying at La Trobe University and eventually graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and Diploma of Education in 1990.

==Autism==

In 1991, Williams was diagnosed with autism by Lawrence Bartak, a specialist at Monash Medical Centre and a senior lecturer in psychology at the associated Monash University. Bartak later recalled &quot;[Williams] displayed all the main features of autism when I met her, including one she wouldn&#x27;t have known about ... The fact that she was apparently sociable and interacting with people doesn&#x27;t mean she didn&#x27;t have some type of disorder&quot;. Bartak helped Williams &quot;begin building bridges instead of walls between worlds&quot;. In July 1996, doubts about Williams&#x27; condition were aired on Radio National&#x27;s &quot;The Health Report&quot; and by &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper. The claims of &quot;faking it&quot; were denied by both Williams and Bartak. In February 2005, David Smukler, writing in the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities&#x27; journal &quot;Mental Retardation&quot;, noted that back in the mid-1990s some sceptics had a poorly defined understanding of the autism spectrum: &quot;...autistic people such as Donna Williams and Temple Grandin started to publish first-person accounts that described their lives as autistic people living in an often-inhospitable nonautistic world. Many readers of these early accounts questioned whether or not the authors were &quot;really&quot; autistic. The assumption underlying such responses is that autism is so incapacitating that Williams or Grandin could not be autistic and still write with such insight and sensitivity. When their books first appeared, autistic authors were characterized either as frauds or exceptions&quot;. Smukler concluded: &quot;Today, Williams&#x27; and Grandin&#x27;s &#x27;credentials&#x27; are rarely challenged. Rather than being doubted, they are more likely to be commended for offering us an &#x27;inside out&#x27; view of autism&quot;.

==Career==
By 1992, Williams was a qualified teacher. Subsequently, she became an international public speaker and an autism consultant. In 2002, she joined the United Kingdom&#x27;s Medical Research Council&#x27;s review into the causes of autism, where she was appointed to the lay-person&#x27;s panel.

== Work ==
===Books===
In 1992, Williams published her first book, an autobiographical account titled &quot;Nobody Nowhere: The Extraordinary Autobiography of an Autistic Girl&quot; (Doubleday, London). It was an international best seller including spending fifteen weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for adult non-fiction in 1993. It was short-listed for the New South Wales Premier&#x27;s Literary Awards for non-fiction in 1992. According to &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; the book enabled people associated with autistic individuals, to &quot;understand more clearly what those unresponsive &#x27;dead eyes&#x27; see&quot;. While Daniel Goleman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described how Williams &quot;originally wrote it as a series of notes to herself, to help her make sense of her own chaotic world. She planned to burn her journal until a therapist helped her see the value in sharing it&quot;.

Her second autobiography, &quot;Somebody Somewhere: Breaking Free from the World of Autism&quot;, appeared in 1994. Marguerite Mroz of &quot;Library Journal&quot; noted that Williams describes getting the first book published, including &quot;[h]er extraordinary and painful growth as she completes her education, continues psychiatric treatment, experiences the unwelcome publicity brought about by the publication of &quot;Nobody Nowhere&quot;&quot;. &quot;Kirkus Review&quot; found Williams had become &quot;more emotionally vulnerable than ever, unprotected by the ritualistic noises and movements typical of autism and determined not to call on the false selves that helped her function in the world &#x27;out there&#x27;&quot;. Later autobiographical works include &quot;Like Colour to the Blind: Soul Searching and Soul Finding&quot; (1996), and &quot;Everyday Heaven: Journeys Beyond the Stereotypes of Autism&quot; (2004). Emily Golson in Williams&#x27; entry in &quot;Encyclopedia of Women&#x27;s Autobiography&quot; (2005) finds that &quot;[her] writing mirrors the convolutions of her thought processes: disjointed, sometimes rambling, often filled with images that convey a jumble of colors, sounds and attitudes&quot;.

Williams wrote several non-fiction books on intellectual and developmental conditions, especially on the autism spectrum &quot;Autism – an Inside-out Approach: An Innovative Look at the Mechanics of Autism and Its Developmental Cousins&quot; (1996), &quot;Autism and Sensing: The Unlost Instinct&quot; (1998), &quot;Exposure Anxiety - The Invisible Cage: An Exploration of Self-Protection Responses in the Autism Spectrum&quot; (15 September 2002), and &quot;The Jumbled Jigsaw: An Insider&#x27;s Approach to the Treatment of Autistic Spectrum &quot;Fruit Salads&quot;&quot; (2006). Her first collection of poetry and prose, &quot;Not Just Anything: A Collection of Thoughts on Paper&quot; (2004), was published by Jessica Kingsley Publishers. A second collection, &quot;Weirdos Like Me&quot;, appeared in September 2009.

===Television documentaries===
Williams was the subject of several TV documentaries. &quot;My Experience with Autism, Emotion and Behavior&quot; (1993), an episode, on &quot;Eye to Eye with Connie Chung&quot; was broadcast in the United States. Beth Fouse and Maria Wheeler describe Williams&#x27; interview and her mode of communication in their book, &quot;A Treasure Chest of Behavioral Strategies for Individuals with Autism&quot; (1997). Williams had &quot;difficulties in processing incoming information. She needed to listen &quot;or&quot; look. She could not use auditory and visual channels at the same time&quot;. On &quot;Jam Jar&quot; (1995), by Fresh Film in association with BBC Four, which aired in the UK, Williams provided her audience with a greater depth of understanding of autism. The documentary provided Joe Geraci with Williams&#x27; &quot;provocative argument about academics coming to some kind of understanding of autism&quot; where she described the &#x27;inside-out&#x27; world, &quot;[an autistic] has his own system, and it&#x27;s not an infantile version of [the non-autistic person&#x27;s] system; they haven&#x27;t learned his system&quot;. &quot;Yokosho Watashi No Sekai E &quot;Jiheisho&quot; Donna Williams&quot; (1995), was broadcast by NHK TV in Japan. &quot;Krankheit als Schicksal&quot; (English: &quot;Illness as fate&quot;), was filmed in 1995, by Hamburg&#x27;s Spiegel TV, and was aired on 25 January 1997 in Germany. It is titled &quot;Dann Verstehe Ich Auch Nur Bla, Bla, Bla&quot; (English: &quot;Then I Only Understood Too Much Bla, Bla, Bla&quot;).

In September 2010, Orlai Produkciós Iroda of Hungary produced a monodrama, &quot;Nemsenkilény, monológ nemmindegyembereknek&quot; (&quot;Not a nobody creature&quot;) presented by Börcsök Enikő, from a book by autistic author, Henriett Seth F. which appeared in theatres and on TV. The script contains quotations from &quot;Nobody Nowhere&quot; along with Birger Sellin&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t want to Be Inside Me Anymore&quot;, and Mark Haddon&#x27;s &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time&quot;.

===Music and art===
Williams&#x27; debut album, titled &quot;Nobody Nowhere&quot; after her first autobiography, was released in 2000; it is a collaboration with Paul Farrer. Two tracks, &quot;Sometimes&quot; and &quot;Beyond the When&quot;, feature in the 2000 Tokyo Broadcasting System Television series &quot;Things You Taught Me&quot;. The 12-part series follows the life of an autistic woman developing her human interaction skills. In July 2005, she followed up &quot;Nobody Nowhere&quot; with a second album titled &quot;Mutation&quot;. It is a collaboration with Akash, an Australian composer, producer and arranger. Both albums feature music and lyrics by Williams, with &quot;Mutation&quot; including spoken word poetry in addition to music. Williams was a self-taught painter, beginning in adulthood. She was also a sculptor and completed life-sized sculptures.

== Personal life ==

Williams was the older sister of mural and graffiti artist &quot;Duel&quot; (Tom Williams, born 1969).

As well as autism, Williams also had prosopagnosia, underwent therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder at various points in her life and was diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder in 2010 and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV in March 2013.

In 1993, Williams married Ian. They divorced after two years. Their relationship is described in &quot;Somebody Somewhere: Breaking Free from the World of Autism&quot; and &quot;Like Colour to the Blind: Soul Searching and Soul Finding&quot;; and he appeared in television documentaries with her. On 9 December 2000, while living in England, Williams married Chris Samuel. In 2002, the couple moved to her native Australia. Williams and Samuel created the auties.org website, for people on the autistic spectrum who are seeking to work towards self-employment. Williams wrote about him in &quot;Everyday Heaven&quot;.

=== Cancer and death ===
Williams had a &quot;strong family history of cancer&quot;. In 2011 she was diagnosed with breast cancer. The cancer, which was terminal, metastasized and &quot;spread throughout the liver&quot;. She chose to spend her last days in palliative care. She urged her state premier to pass Dying with Dignity legislation. Williams died of the disease on 22 April 2017, aged 53.

<doc id="568483" wikidata="Q186106" url="?curid=568483" title="South Beach">
<text>South Beach, also nicknamed colloquially as SoBe, is a neighborhood in Miami Beach, Florida. It is located east of Miami between Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. The area encompasses Miami Beach south of Dade Boulevard.

This area was the first section of Miami Beach to be developed, starting in the 1910s, due to the development efforts of Carl G. Fisher, the Lummus Brothers, and John S. Collins, the latter of whose construction of the Collins Bridge provided the first vital land link between mainland Miami and the beaches.

The area has gone through numerous artificial and natural changes over the years, including a booming regional economy, increased tourism, and the 1926 hurricane, which destroyed much of the area. As of 2010, 39,186 people lived in South Beach.

== History ==



South Beach started as farmland. In 1870, Henry and Charles Lum purchased for coconut farming. Charles Lum built the first house on the beach in 1886. In 1894, the Lum brothers left the island, leaving control of the plantation to John Collins, who came to South Beach two years later to survey the land. He used the land for farming purposes, discovering fresh water and extending his parcel from 14th Street to 67th in 1907.

In 1912, Miami businessmen the Lummus Brothers acquired of Collins&#x27; land in an effort to build an oceanfront city of modest single family residences. In 1913, Collins started construction of a bridge from Miami to Miami Beach. Although some local residents invested in the bridge, Collins ran short of money before he could complete it.

Carl G. Fisher, a successful entrepreneur who made millions in 1909 after selling a business to Union Carbide, came to the beach in 1913. His vision was to establish South Beach as a successful city independent of Miami. This was the same year that the restaurant Joe&#x27;s Stone Crab opened. Fisher loaned $50,000 to Collins for his bridge, which was completed in June, 1913. The Collins Bridge was later replaced by the Venetian Causeway.

On March 26, 1915, Collins, Lummus, and Fisher consolidated their efforts and incorporated the Town of Miami Beach. In 1920, the County Causeway (renamed MacArthur Causeway in 1942) was completed. The Lummus brothers sold their oceanfront property, between 6th and 14th Streets, to the city. To this day, this area is known as Lummus Park.

In 1920, the Miami Beach land boom began. South Beach&#x27;s main streets (5th Street, Alton Road, Collins Avenue, Washington Avenue, and Ocean Drive) were all suitable for automobile traffic. The population was growing in the 1920s, and several millionaires such as Harvey Firestone, J.C. Penney, Harry C. Stutz, Albert Champion, Frank Seiberling, and Rockwell LaGorce built homes on Miami Beach. President Warren G. Harding stayed at the Flamingo Hotel during this time, increasing interest in the area.

Until the mid-1920s, antisemitic covenants were used in South Beach to exclude Jews from living or staying in neighborhoods north of Fifth Street. Explicit and covert policies targeted Jewish property owners, tourists, and tenants through racial covenants in property deeds and hotel policies.

In the 1930s, an architectural revolution came to South Beach, bringing Art Deco, Streamline Moderne, and Nautical Moderne architecture to the Beach. South Beach claims to be the world&#x27;s largest collection of Streamline Moderne Art Deco architecture. Napier, New Zealand, another notable Art Deco city, is architecturally comparable to Miami Beach as it was rebuilt in the Ziggurat Art Deco style after being destroyed by an earthquake in 1931.

By 1940, the beach had a population of 28,000. After the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, the Army Air Corps took command over Miami Beach. That year, tourism brought almost two million people to South Beach.

In 1964, South Beach became even more famous when Jackie Gleason brought his weekly variety series, The Jackie Gleason Show to the area for taping, a rarity in the industry. Beginning in the mid 1960s and continuing through the 1980s, South Beach was used as a retirement community with most of its ocean-front hotels and apartment buildings filled with elderly people living on small, fixed incomes. This period also saw the introduction of the &quot;cocaine cowboys,&quot; drug dealers who used the area as a base for their illicit drug activities. &quot;Scarface&quot;, released in 1983, typifies this activity. In addition, television show &quot;Miami Vice&quot; used South Beach as a backdrop for much of its filming. A somewhat recurring theme of early &quot;Miami Vice&quot; episodes was thugs and drug addicts barricading themselves in run-down or empty buildings. Only minor alterations had to be made for these scenes because some buildings in South Beach were in poor condition at the time.

While many of the unique Art Deco buildings, such as the New Yorker Hotel, were lost to developers in the years before 1980, the area was saved as a cohesive unit by Barbara Baer Capitman and a group of activists who spearheaded the movement to place almost one square mile of South Beach on the National Register of Historic Places. The Miami Beach Architectural District was designated in 1979.

Before the days of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, South Beach was considered a very poor area with a very high rate of crime. Today, it is considered one of the wealthiest and most prosperous commercial areas on the beach. Despite this, poverty and crime still exist in some isolated places surrounding the area.

In 2009, Natalie O&#x27;Neill of the &quot;Miami New Times&quot; said, &quot;Until the 1980s, Miami Beach was a peculiar mix of criminals, Cubans, and little old ladies. Then the beautiful people moved in.&quot; In the late 1980s, a renaissance began in South Beach, with an influx of fashion industry professionals moving into the area. In 1989, Irene Marie purchased the Sun Ray Apartments (captured in the chainsaw scene in &quot;Scarface&quot;) located on Ocean Drive and opened Irene Marie Models.

Thomas Kramer is credited with starting the construction boom in South Beach, driving the gentrification of the area. It is now a popular living destination for the wealthy. Condominium units in the upscale high rises sell for millions. There are a number of vocal critics of the developments. The high-rise and high-density buildings are derided as a &quot;concrete jungle&quot;. However, even critics concede that the development has changed the area into a pedestrian friendly, low-crime neighborhood.

== Today ==
In both daytime and at nightfall, the South Beach section of Miami Beach is a major entertainment destination with hundreds of nightclubs, restaurants, boutiques and hotels. The area is popular with tourists from Canada, Europe, Israel and the entire Western Hemisphere, with some having permanent or second homes there.

South Beach&#x27;s residents&#x27; varied backgrounds are evident in the many languages spoken. In 2000, 55% of residents of the city of Miami Beach spoke Spanish as a first language, while English was the first language for 33% of the population. Portuguese (mainly Brazilian Portuguese) was spoken by 3% of residents, while French (including Canadian French) was spoken by 2%, and German by 1%. Italian, Russian, Yiddish and Hebrew were all spoken by less than 1%.

Another unique aesthetic attribute of South Beach is the presence of several colorful and unique stands used by Miami Beach&#x27;s lifeguards on South Beach. After Hurricane Andrew, Architect William Lane donated his design services to the city and added new stops on design tours in the form of lifeguard towers. His towers instantly became symbols of the revived City of Miami Beach.

===LGBT Community===

South Beach is considered a hub of LGBT lifestyle. In the 80s and 90s, South Beach was the center of Florida&#x27;s gay life and nightlife. It is home to many hotels, clubs, and nightlife that caters to the LGBT community. Ocean Drive is a hotspot to socialize and there is LGBT friendly shopping and cocktailing on Lincoln Road. The World Erotic Art Museum on South Beach is considered a local favorite to visit.

South Beach is also the location of the Pride Parade and Pride Festival events during Pride Week of the annual Miami Beach Pride celebration. Both of the events run through Ocean Drive from Fifth to 15th Streets. First started in 2009, Miami Beach Pride now draws over 130,000 people to South Beach every year.

== Geography ==
South Beach is traversed by numerical streets which run east–west, starting with Biscayne Street, now popularly known as South Pointe Drive, one block south of First Street and the largely pedestrianized Lincoln Road (running parallel between 16th and 17th streets). It also has 13 principal roads and avenues running north–south, which, from the Biscayne Bay side, are Bay Road, West Avenue, Alton Road, Lenox Avenue, Michigan Avenue, Jefferson Avenue, Meridian Avenue, Euclid Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue, Drexel Avenue, Washington Avenue, Collins Avenue (State Road A1A), and Ocean Drive. There are three smaller avenues (that do not run the entire length of South Beach) in the Collins Park area, named Park, Liberty, and James. Most locals agree that South Beach&#x27;s northern boundary runs along Dade Boulevard from Lincoln Road on the bay side of the island, and heads east-north-east until it connects with 24th Street, which forms the northern boundary on the ocean side.

== Transportation ==
South Beach, along with a handful of other neighborhoods in Greater Miami (such as Downtown and Brickell), is one of the areas where a car-free lifestyle is commonplace. Many South Beach residents get around by foot, bicycle, motorcycle, trolley, bus, or taxi as the neighborhood is very urban and pedestrian-friendly. Lincoln Road, Ocean Drive, Washington Avenue, and Collins Avenue are popular shopping, eating, and entertainment streets for pedestrians. Lincoln Road is a pedestrian-only shopping street, and Collins Avenue around 5th Street is mostly upscale retail.

Automobile congestion in the area is frequent, so getting around in South Beach by car can often prove more difficult than simply walking or bicycling. Recently, Miami Beach has begun bicycle initiatives promoting citywide bike parking and bike lanes that have made bicycling much more popular for residents and tourists. The Venetian Causeway, for example, is a popular bicycle commuter route that connects South Beach to Downtown.

Public transportation in South Beach, along with Downtown Miami and Brickell, is heavily used, and is a vital part of South Beach life. Although South Beach has no direct Metrorail stations, numerous Metrobus lines (operated by Miami-Dade Transit), connect to Downtown Miami and Metrorail (e.g., Metrobus lines S and 120). The Miami International Airport can be reached quickly from several bus stops in South Beach via the Airport-Beach Express (Metrobus line 150). That ride costs $2.35 and runs every 30 minutes from 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. seven days a week.

Various City of Miami Beach-operated trolley routes provide free rides throughout South Beach and connect it to the other major areas of Miami Beach: South Beach Loop travels throughout South Beach, Middle Beach Loop connects South Beach to Mid-Beach&#x27;s main street (41st Street) via State Road A1A and along 41st Street, and Collins Express connects South Beach to Mid-Beach and North Beach via State Road A1A. Using Collins Express to connect to the North Beach Loop allows free travel from South Beach to several areas of North Beach. All four trolley lines operate from 8 a.m. to midnight on Sunday and from 6 a.m. to midnight the rest of the week.

== Commercial and other areas ==
=== Lincoln Road ===
Lincoln Road is an open-air pedestrian mall, considered South Beach&#x27;s premiere shopping area. While Lincoln Road was one time rather downtrodden, it began a renaissance in the 1980s as an arts and cultural center. It has &quot;an esoteric chic that maintains its trendy appeal.&quot; It runs parallel in between 16th Street and 17th Street and spans the Beach in an east–west direction. Lincoln Road was fully accessible to automobile traffic until the 1950s when automobile access was limited from Alton Road to Biscayne Bay on the west end and Washington Avenue to the beach on the east end of Lincoln Road with Lincoln Mall limited to pedestrians stretching from Alton Road to Washington Avenue. Among the late 1990s restaurants on Lincoln Road was one owned by actor Michael Caine, and managed by one of his daughters. The restaurant has since closed. The Miami Beach Preservation Board approved the closure of automobile traffic on the westward part of Lincoln Mall, in favor of the renovation of the SunTrust building including the development of the 1111 Lincoln Road parking garage. Several other parking garages nearby greatly facilitate commerce.

=== Ocean Drive ===

Ocean Drive is the easternmost street in South Beach, and stems from South Pointe Drive to 15th Street, running in a north–south direction. Ocean Drive is responsible for the South Beach aesthetic that most out-of-town visitors expect. It is a popular tourist area. It is also home to several restaurants (including &quot;A Fish Called Avalon&quot;,&quot; &quot;Mango&#x27;s,&quot; and the MTV-popularized &quot;Clevelander&quot;) and is the site of Gianni Versace&#x27;s former ocean front mansion.

=== Collins Avenue ===
Collins Avenue runs parallel to Ocean Drive, one block west. It is also State Road A1A. Collins is home to many historic Art Deco hotels, and several nightclubs to the north, including Mynt and Rokbar.

=== Española Way ===
Española Way, which runs from Collins Avenue to Pennsylvania Avenue, was conceived by N.B.T. Roney (of Roney Plaza Hotel fame) in 1925 as &quot;The Historic Spanish Village,&quot; modeled after Mediterranean villages found in France and Spain. Today it consists of restaurants, bars, art galleries, and shops.

=== Alton Road ===
Alton Road is the main westside north–south street located 1-3 blocks from Biscayne Bay. On the part that traverses South Beach, the road is host to many local businesses, including dry cleaners, small furniture stores, small grocery markets, non-chain restaurants and fast food restaurants. It is mainly residential once it crosses Michigan Avenue north of South Beach.

=== Washington Avenue ===
Washington Avenue is one of the best-known streets in South Beach. Running parallel with Ocean and Collins, Washington is notorious for having some of the world&#x27;s largest and most popular nightclubs, such as Cameo and Mansion. During &quot;season&quot; the street is jammed with traffic until early in the morning (as late as 6 am) every night of the week. In the 1990s explosion of South Beach as a nightclub venue, its nightclub moguls included Ingrid Casares, whose investors included the singer Madonna. Washington Avenue is also home to countless shops, hotels, and such noted architectural features as Temple Emanu-El.

=== West Avenue Corridor ===

The West Avenue Corridor extends from 5th Street north to 17th Street and is bounded by the east side of Alton Road and Biscayne Bay. Development in the West Avenue Corridor began in the 1920s when three grand hotels were built on the shores of Biscayne Bay: The Flamingo, The Fleetwood and the Floridian. Al Capone and vacationing billionaires from the Golden Age made these hotels their winter hideaway. By the 1950s the hotels fell into ruin and tourists abandoned this side of South Beach for the oceanside.

All three properties, along with the rest of the Corridor, have since evolved into a middle-class, mixed use residential neighborhood. Each passing decade saw the addition of new architectural styles that enhance the diversity and appeal of the neighborhood. Amenities for residents and visitors include shopping, houses of worship, cafes, restaurants, parks and gyms.

Today, the West Avenue Corridor is one of the most desirable places to live in Miami Beach. Vacationers, homeowners and renters can find an abode to suit any style in this neighborhood that supports a combination of single family homes, original art deco buildings, MiMo mid-rises and contemporary high density high-rises.

The Corridor is home to almost 10,000 residents, over 40 different condominiums, several single family homes and a number of rental buildings. The neighborhood has changed over the years. The recent Census shows the neighborhood to be much younger and more year-round than in years past. It is highly walkable since it is a quiet neighborhood and is close to many amenities - Flamingo Park, Lincoln Road, the ocean, the nightlife of Ocean Drive and Washington Avenue, grocery stores and many restaurants.

Located at 10th Street and West Avenue, The Shoppes at West Avenue, built almost 12 years ago by Gumenick Properties, hosts a locus of business activity that complements the residential community. There is a parking garage disguised by the architecture and on the ground level are shops.

Adding the neighborhood&#x27;s attractiveness is its proximity to the neighborhoods of South of Fifth, Sunset Harbor, Belle Isle, the Venetian Islands and North Bay Road. In the South of Fifth community is the highly rated South Pointe Elementary School, an &quot;A&quot; rated school boasting the highly coveted International Baccalaureate® program.

One could say the Corridor has come full circle - the forefathers intentions were to create a magical lifestyle in a tropical paradise, and the residents who now make their home along the Bay fulfill and continue that lifestyle.

The quote became a punch line for critics.

<doc id="568484" wikidata="Q3320941" url="?curid=568484" title="Seán Mac Diarmada">
<text>Seán Mac Diarmada (27 January 1883 – 12 May 1916), also known as Seán MacDermott, was an Irish republican political activist and revolutionary leader. He was one of the seven leaders of the Easter Rising of 1916, which he helped to organise as a member of the Military Committee of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) and was the second signatory of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. He was executed for his part in the Rising at age 33.

Brought up in rural County Leitrim, he was a member of many associations which promoted the cause of the Irish language, Gaelic revival and Irish nationalism in general, including the Gaelic League and (early in his career) the Irish Catholic fraternity the Ancient Order of Hibernians. He was the national organiser for Sinn Féin, and later manager of the newspaper &quot;Irish Freedom&quot;, started in 1910 by Bulmer Hobson and others.

==Early life==

Mac Diarmada was born John MacDermott in Corranmore, close to Kiltyclogher in County Leitrim, an area where the landscape was marked by reminders of poverty and oppression. His father Donald McDermott was a member of the IRB and a friend of John Daly.

Surrounding Mac Diarmada in rural Leitrim, there were signs of Irish history throughout the area. There was an ancient sweat-house, Mass rocks from the penal times and the persecutions of the 17th and 18th centuries, and deserted abodes as an aftermath of the hunger of the 1840s.

He was educated at Corradoona national school. In 1908 he moved to Dublin, by which time he already had a long involvement in several Irish nationalist and cultural organisations, including Sinn Féin, the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), the Ancient Order of Hibernians and the Gaelic League. He was soon promoted to the Supreme Council of the IRB and eventually elected secretary. He originally refused to join the IRB as it was condemned by the Catholic church but Bulmer Hobson convinced him otherwise.

In 1910 he became manager of the radical newspaper &quot;Irish Freedom&quot;, which he founded along with Bulmer Hobson and Denis McCullough. He also became a national organiser for the IRB and was taken under the wing of veteran Fenian Tom Clarke. Indeed, over the year the two became nearly inseparable. Shortly thereafter Mac Diarmada contracted polio and needed a cane to walk.

MacDiarmada along with Clarke supported the workers during the 1913 Dublin Lockout.

In November 1913 Mac Diarmada was one of the original members of the Irish Volunteers, and continued to work to bring that organisation under IRB control. In May 1915 Mac Diarmada was arrested in Tuam, County Galway, under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914 for giving a speech against enlisting into the British Army during the First World War.

==Easter Rising==

Following his release in September 1915, he joined the secret Military Committee of the IRB, which was responsible for planning the rising. Indeed, Mac Diarmada and Clarke were the people most responsible for it. In 1914 he said &quot;the Irish patriotic spirit will die forever unless a blood sacrifice is made in the next few years&quot;.

Due to his disability, Mac Diarmada took little part in the fighting of Easter week, but was stationed at the headquarters in the General Post Office (GPO), as one of the Provisional Republican Government. Following the surrender, he nearly escaped execution by blending in with the large body of prisoners. He was eventually recognised by Daniel Hoey of G Division. Following a court-martial on 9 May, Mac Diarmada was executed by firing squad in Kilmainham Gaol on 12 May at the age of 33.

In September 1919 Hoey was shot dead by Michael Collins&#x27;s Squad. Likewise, the British Officer Lee-Wilson, who ordered Mac Diarmada be shot, rather than imprisoned, was also killed in Cork on Collins&#x27;s order during the Irish War of Independence.

Mac Diarmada had been in regular correspondence with Nell Ryan. In his final letter he wrote: &quot;Miss Ryan, she who in all probability, had I lived, would have been my wife&quot;. &quot;Min&quot; Josephine Ryan and her sister, Phyllis, had been couriers to the GPO. They also visited Kilmainham Gaol, before his execution, and managed to evade arrest. Min, a founder of Cumann na mBan, managed to escape from Ireland to America; she later married Richard Mulcahy.

Before his execution Mac Diarmada shared a cell with the Irish Volunteers leader from Wexford Robert Brennan who asked MacDiarmada if he was satisfied with the rising. MacDiarmada said: &quot;I am, we put up a great fight. The lads were grand. We have awakened the old spirit. You&#x27;ll see.&quot; Referring to his execution he wrote, &quot;I feel happiness the like of which I have never experienced. I die that the Irish nation might live!”

==Commemoration==
Seán McDermott Street (formerly Gloucester Street) in Dublin is named in his honour. So too is Sligo Mac Diarmada railway station in Sligo, and Páirc Seán Mac Diarmada, the Gaelic Athletic Association stadium in Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim. Sean MacDermott tower in Ballymun, demolished in 2005, was also named after him. In his hometown of Kiltyclogher a statue inscribed with his final written words – see above – was erected in the village centre, and his childhood home has become a National Monument. 
 The building which holds the national bus station (Busáras) and the Department of Social Protection is known as Áras Mhic Dhiarmada.

==Cultural legacy==
Leitrim native Seán Fox portrayed Mac Diarmada in RTÉ&#x27;s 2016 series &quot;Rebellion&quot;.

Mick Blake, a Leitrim singer/songwriter, wrote &quot;Sean MacDiarmada (the Pride of Corranmore)&quot; to commemorate the centenary of the 1916 Rising. The song was commissioned by New York businessman Joseph Mc Manus.

<text>Washington College is a private liberal arts college in Chestertown, Maryland. Maryland granted Washington College its charter in 1782. George Washington supported the founding of the college by consenting to have the &quot;College at Chester&quot; named in his honor through generous financial support and service on the college&#x27;s Board of Visitors and Governors. Washington College is the 10th-oldest college in the United States and was the first college chartered after American independence. The school became coeducational in 1891.

==History==

Washington College evolved from the Kent County Free School, an institution of more than 200 years standing in &quot;Chester Town,&quot; which by the college&#x27;s founding date of 1782 had reached considerable strength and importance as a port city. George Washington consented to the fledgling college&#x27;s use of his name (the only institution of higher education in the United States with this claim), pledged the sum of 50 guineas to its establishment, and extended his warm wishes for the &quot;lasting and extensive usefulness&quot; of the institution. He later served on Washington College&#x27;s Board of Visitors and Governors — his only involvement with an institution of higher learning.

The college&#x27;s first president, the Reverend William Smith, was a prominent figure in colonial affairs of letters and church, and he had a wide acquaintance among the great men of colonial days, including Benjamin Franklin. Joining General Washington on the Board of Visitors and Governors of the new college were such distinguished figures as U.S. Senator John Henry, Congressman Joshua Seney and William Paca, Governor of Maryland. The Maryland legislature granted its first college charter to Washington College in May 1782. The following spring, on May 14, 1783, the college held its first commencement.

President Smith had envisaged Washington College as the Eastern Shore campus of a public &quot;University of Maryland&quot; with St. John&#x27;s College as its Western Shore counterpart, a proposal incorporated into the later institution&#x27;s 1784 state charter, but the Maryland General Assembly&#x27;s reluctance to provide funding meant this was never more than a paper institution, and the relationship ended with Smith&#x27;s return to Philadelphia in 1789.

With his election as the first President of the United States, General Washington retired from the Board of Visitors and Governors. It accepted the honorary degree of doctor of laws, which a delegation from Chestertown presented to him on June 24, 1789, in New York, then the seat of Congress. Since Washington&#x27;s last visit to campus, Washington College has hosted five U.S. presidents: Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Harry S Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and George H. W. Bush.

The original college building cornerstone was laid in May 1783; it opened in 1788 after selling off acreage and starting a lottery to fund the project. The hall was still incomplete by 1794 and was destroyed by a basement fire on January 11, 1827. The oldest existing building, Middle Hall, was erected in 1844 on the site of the original college building. By 1860, Middle Hall was joined by East and West Halls. All three structures, known as the Hill Dorms, are on the Maryland Register of Historic Places.

==Academics==

===Student body and admissions===

Washington College offers 34 majors and 35 minors or concentrations. The most popular majors, based on 2021 graduates, were:
*Business Administration &amp; Management (36)
*Psychology (36)
*Biology/Biological Sciences (32)
*Economics (21)
*English Language &amp; Literature (18)
*Political Science &amp; Government (16)

1,367 undergraduate students attended Washington College during the 2018–2019 academic year along with approximately 100 graduate students. During that year, 74% of applicants were accepted. (The acceptance rate for 2018–2019 was much higher than in previous years, likely due to the drop in total applications for the 2018–2019 academic year. Washington College received 5,515 applications for 2017–2018 and 3,109 for 2018–2019.) For the 2023–2024 academic year, 916 undergraduates attended WAC. The acceptance rate was 66%. The mean high school GPA of admitted students was 3.67 in Fall 2023. For past or future stats numbers look here

During the 2018–2019 academic year, 40.6 percent of incoming first-year students were from Maryland and the balance many other US states and 23 foreign nations. 18.8 percent of undergraduates are minority students with 9.2 percent identifying as African-American, 5.6 percent identifying as Hispanic-American, 3.2 percent identifying as Asian-American, and with .8 percent identifying as either Native American or Pacific Islander. 7.4 percent of undergraduates are international citizens. Approximately 5 percent of the college&#x27;s student body is &quot;non-traditional&quot; (25 years old or older). 83% of students lived in an on-campus residence during the 2018 Fall term; the rest commute either from off-campus housing or home.

Tuition for the 2020–2021 year is $48,678, and total expenses per annum (including room, board, and mandatory student fees) are $62,806. During the 2018–2019 academic year, 99.4 percent of incoming first-year students received financial aid, along with 95.0 percent of all undergraduates. The cost of attendance has been rising in recent years, with the overall costs (including room and board) increasing by roughly $2,000 per year.

In 2015, Washington College was ranked by &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; as 16th in the United States among &quot;Colleges With The Happiest Students In 2015–16&quot;. In the 2011 edition of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; Best Colleges, Washington College rose 19 positions to 93rd in the nation in the National Liberal Arts Colleges category.

==Literary prizes==
Each year, Washington College awards the nation&#x27;s largest undergraduate literary prize. Since 1968, the Sophie Kerr Prize has been presented to one graduating senior demonstrating the greatest literary promise. The endowment created by Sophie Kerr, a writer who published 23 novels and dozens of short stories, has provided more than $1.4 million in prize money to young writers. At a ceremony held at the Poets House in New York City on May 17, 2011, Lisa Jones was selected as the winner of the $61,000 Sophie Kerr Prize.

In 2005, Washington College inaugurated another literary prize, the George Washington Book Prize, administered by the college&#x27;s C.V. Starr Center for the Study of the American Experience and awarded in partnership with the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History and George Washington&#x27;s Mount Vernon. The prize is awarded annually to the most significant new book about the founding era. At $50,000, the prize is one of the most generous book awards in the United States. Richard Beeman won the 2010 George Washington Book Prize for his work, &quot;Plain, Honest Men: The Making of the American Constitution.&quot;

In 2015, the Rose O&#x27;Neill Literary House, Washington College&#x27;s center for literature and the literary arts, established the Douglass Wallop Fellowship as a nationwide competition, with the first fellowship going to playwright Sheri Wilner. The award will be granted biennially to a playwright.

==Student life==
The school has over 90 student clubs.

Only seniors can apply to live off campus; the rest are required to live on campus (unless they are local or commuters). On-campus housing can accommodate approximately 1,056 students (not including quad rooms that can be converted). Most students stay on campus over the weekend to participate in various social and recreational activities.

Approximately 30 percent of students attend graduate school in the first year following graduation, and approximately 45 percent do so within five years.

In Fall 2018, the student-to-faculty ratio was 10.5:1. The average class size is 17.

The school confers the degrees of Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, and Master of Arts (in English, psychology, and history).

Washington College has joined the American College &amp; University Presidents Climate Commitment with a Campus carbon neutrality goal. The Center for Environment and Society oversees the Chesapeake Semester program, four interdisciplinary courses that use the college&#x27;s location in the Chesapeake Bay watershed to explore environmental issues and advocacy.

Washington College hosts the Harwood Series, which includes speeches by national politicians and media pundits. Because of its reputation as a liberal arts school with creative writing being a strength, writers such as John Barth, Ray Bradbury, Bobbie Ann Mason, Colum McCann, Neil Gaiman, Tim O&#x27;Brien, Junot Díaz, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and Robert Pinsky have given readings at the campus.

===Greek life===

Greek life at Washington College comprises four men&#x27;s fraternities and three women&#x27;s sororities. Approximately 25 percent of the student body joins Greek life. Fraternities are mainly housed on the &quot;quad&quot;, and sororities line the Western Shore housing.

Men&#x27;s fraternities:
*Kappa Sigma Omicron-Phi – Chartered April 14, 2007
*Phi Delta Theta MD Gamma – Chartered April 25, 1992

===Traditions===

George Washington Birthday Ball: A college-wide dance where students, faculty, staff, alumni, and friends of the college come together to celebrate George Washington&#x27;s birthday. The event usually occurs on or around George Washington&#x27;s birth date.

War on the Shore: The annual men&#x27;s lacrosse game, held in late spring between Washington College and Salisbury University, two of Maryland&#x27;s Eastern Shore&#x27;s undergraduate schools. Beginning in 2004, the winner of the game has been awarded the Charles B. Clark Cup.

May Day: Started in 1968 by Professor Bennett Lamond of the English Department, who retired in 2004. He brought a class out onto the green, where they read poetry and drank wine. Later that night, some students returned, and Washington College&#x27;s May Day celebration was born. Since then, May Day has become a two-day festival on April 30 and May 1, often involving some student body public nudity. Most students use paint, glitter, and other art forms to cover their bodies at this festival. The event draws many students as spectators. The college&#x27;s Public Safety officers stand at the perimeter of the campus green to prevent students from being publicly indecent off campus grounds.

==Athletics==

===Varsity sports===

Washington College has competed in intercollegiate athletics since the 19th century. Its oldest current varsity sports are the baseball team, which dates back to at least the early 1870s, and the men&#x27;s basketball team, which played its 100th season in 2011–12. Men&#x27;s teams are known as the Shoremen; women&#x27;s teams are known as the Shorewomen.

While men have played varsity sports at Washington College for well over a century, varsity opportunities for women have been more recent. The first varsity sports for women – rowing, tennis, and volleyball – were added in the mid-1970s and were followed by the additions of softball, lacrosse, field hockey, and swimming by the mid-1980s. Varsity women&#x27;s basketball began play during the 1993–94 season, while coed sailing was elevated to varsity status four years later. The women&#x27;s soccer team is the college&#x27;s newest varsity sport; it began play during the fall of 1998.

Washington College fielded a varsity football team through 1950, a men&#x27;s track and field team through 1982, and a men&#x27;s cross country team through 1989. The college previously sponsored varsity men&#x27;s golf and varsity wrestling.

Fourteen of Washington College&#x27;s 20 varsity teams compete in the Centennial Conference. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rowing teams compete in the Mid-Atlantic Rowing Conference (MARC). In contrast, the sailing team competes in the Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association (MAISA) of the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association (ICSA).

The rowing and sailing teams host regattas on the Chester River and call the college&#x27;s Truslow Boat House and Lelia Hynson Boating Park home.

The college&#x27;s 20 varsity teams are:

*Baseball (m)
*Basketball (m, w)
*Field hockey (w)
*Lacrosse (m, w)
*Rowing (m, w)
*Sailing (co-ed)
*Soccer (m, w)
*Softball (w)
*Swimming (m, w)
*Tennis (m, w)
*Trap and skeet (co-ed)
*Volleyball (w)
*Golf (m, w)(introduced fall 2023)
*Track and Field (m, w)(introduced fall 2024)

====Lacrosse====
The college is known for its men&#x27;s lacrosse team. It won the 1998 NCAA Division III National Championship and a share of the 1954 USILA Laurie Cox Division National Championship. The men&#x27;s lacrosse team has participated in the NCAA Division II or III Tournament 28 times since 1974 and the NCAA Division III Championship game eight times. Washington College Men&#x27;s Lacrosse players have earned All-America honors 226 times.

The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse teams, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer teams, and field hockey teams compete on Kibler Field at Roy Kirby Jr. Stadium. Completed in 2006, the stadium was named one of the top 10 venues for collegiate lacrosse by &quot;Lacrosse Magazine&quot;.

==Housing==
There are 24 housing options on campus. Only seniors can apply to live off campus unless they permanently reside nearby and fill out required exemption forms. There are five freshmen-dedicated residence halls on campus.

==Facilities==
Middle, East, and West Halls stand on the crest of a low hill (the terrace) at the center of campus. Middle Hall (built 1844) and East and West Halls (built 1854) are the oldest surviving campus buildings. They serve as monuments to the original Common Building (completed in 1789), whose site they occupy. They are all three-story buildings constructed of brick.

They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

They now function as follows:
*East Hall – The International House is a three-floor coed building that serves as a home for students interested in international relations and foreign language study. This theme house has a faculty advisor.
*Middle Hall – The Creative Arts House is a coed building for students interested in drama, music, visual art, literature, and the creative arts in general.
*West Hall – The Science House is a three-floor coed building that serves as a home for students interested in the natural sciences. This theme house has a faculty advisor.

==People==

===Principals and presidents===
At least 31 people have been the principal or president of Washington College since 1782, four of whom have been interim. Of the 31 presidents, only one, Joseph McLain, was an alumnus of the college, and only one, Sheila Bair, was a woman. The college presidents have been drawn from various areas, including religion, military service, governmental service, and academia. Six Washington College presidents were ordained in the Episcopal Church or the Methodist Protestant Church before their term. Several were also the rector of either Emmanuel Parish or St. Paul&#x27;s in Chestertown concurrent to their term as president. Washington College presidents have come from many parts of public life. Two were engaged in military service before their term, and four were in public service. A singular president, Kurt M. Landgraf, was working in the private sector before his term. Most of the remaining presidents were academics before becoming president of the college. Two were presidents of other colleges, seven were academic administrators, five were faculty members at other colleges, and three were faculty members at Washington College before their terms.

===Alumni===
Alumni of Washington College includes two Governors of Maryland, a Governor of Delaware, four United States Senators, seven members of the United States House of Representatives, and nine State senators. Outside of the world of politics, nine alums of Washington College played at least one game in Major League Baseball, including Jake Flowers, who was on two World Series winning teams. John Emory, the namesake of Emory University and Emory &amp; Henry College, graduated from Washington College. Several alumni were successful writers including James M. Cain and Đỗ Nguyên Mai. Mary Adele France, who was the first president of St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland, and Robert K. Crane, who discovered sodium-glucose cotransport, both found success in academia. H. Lawrence Culp Jr. has found success in business as the CEO of Danaher Corporation and the CEO of General Electric.

<doc id="568505" wikidata="Q3656653" url="?curid=568505" title="Omweso">
<text>Omweso (sometimes shortened to Mweso) is the traditional mancala game of the Ugandan people. The game was supposedly introduced by the Bachwezi people of the ancient Bunyoro-kitara empire of Uganda. Nowadays the game is played and enjoyed by people from various parts of Uganda. The equipment needed for the game is essentially the same as that of the Bao game (found in Tanzania and neighbouring countries). Omweso is strictly related to a wide family of mancalas found in eastern and southern Africa; these include Coro in the Lango region of Uganda, Aweet in Sudan, ǁHus in Namibia, Kombe in Lamu (Kenya), Mongale in Mombasa (Kenya), Mongola in Congo, Igisoro in Rwanda, and Kiela in Angola.

The name &quot;Omweso&quot; is derived from Swahili word &quot;michezo&quot;, which means &quot;game&quot;.

Omweso, as the Baganda call it is also known as vulumula in Busoga, ascoro/soro to the Luo, amwesor to the Itesots, coro to the Lango and ekibuguzo to the Rwandese. It is the same game almost similar rules but with different names. 

== Rules ==
=== Equipment ===

Omweso requires a board of 32 pits, arranged with eight pits lengthwise towards the players, and four pits deep. Each player&#x27;s territory is the 16 pits on their side of the board. In addition, 64 undifferentiated seeds are needed. This equipment is the same used for many variants of Omweso as well as for the Bao game from Zanzibar and Tanzania. Unlike Bao boards, Omweso boards have no special pit (&quot;nyumba&quot;).

=== Object ===
The normal way to win the game is to be the last player to be able to make a legal move, possible by capturing all an opponent&#x27;s stones or reducing the opponent to no more than one seed in each pit. Alternatively, a player can win by capturing on both ends of the board in one turn.

=== Setup ===
Before the game, four (4) seeds are placed in each of the eight pits closest to a player to ensure that both players have exactly 32 seeds. The first player is chosen by lot. This player arranges all owned seeds on their side of the board according to preference (The arrangement should be strategic). Then, the second player also arranges their seeds. The first player then makes the first sowing move.

=== Sowing ===
Play consists of turns, each move may involve several laps. A player moves by selecting a pit with at least two seeds, and &quot;sowing&quot; them one by one around their side of the board in a counter-clockwise direction from the starting pit. The player may only sow from one of the sixteen pits in their territory, and the sowing proceeds around this territory, not directly involving the opponent&#x27;s side.

Although in the past it was common for players to spend much time in thought, in modern tournaments only three seconds of thought is allowed per turn. The referee counts &quot;emu&quot;, &quot;bbiri&quot;, and if the turn is not started the other player may steal it.

==== Example turn ====

Preparing to sow from the highlighted hole.

Sowing captures 6 seeds.

The 6 captured seeds are resown from the starting hole.

==== Relay sowing ====
If the last sowed seed lands in an occupied pit (without resulting in a capture, see below), then all seeds in that pit, including the one just placed, are immediately sown, before the opponent&#x27;s turn. This continues until the last sowing ends in an empty pit.

=== Capturing ===
If the last seed sown lands in one of the player&#x27;s eight inner pits, which is occupied, and furthermore both the opponent&#x27;s pits in this same column are occupied, then all seeds from these two pits are captured and sown starting from the pit where this capturing lap began (i.e., from the last pit scooped, NOT from the original hole from the very beginning of the turn).

==== Reverse capturing ====
Instead of sowing in a counter-clockwise direction, a player may sow clockwise from any of their four leftmost pits if this results in a capture. Upon re-entering these reverse-captured seeds, the player may sow them clockwise again, if and only if this play results in a direct capture. The player may also choose to sow reverse-captured seeds in the usual counter-clockwise manner, and there is no compulsion to play one direction or the other when the choice is available. During a relay-sowing move, one lap of which ends at one of the four leftmost pits, a player may also change direction and begin sowing the next leg of the move clockwise, if and only if this play results in a direct capture.

=== Alternate victory conditions ===
The normal way to win the game is to be the last player left with a legal move. However, there are two additional victory conditions:

;Emitwe-ebiri: During the same move, a player can win by capturing opponent&#x27;s seeds on both ends of the board.
;Akakyala: In some tournaments, a player may win by capturing in each of two separate moves, before the opponent has captured their first seed.

In addition, a special win called &quot;akawumbi&quot; occurs when a player captures seeds from each of an opponent&#x27;s pits in one turn. In a tournament, this may be weighted several times a more mundane victory.

=== Never ending moves ===

It is possible for a move to lead to a never-ending sowing sequence. In tournament play, a player is allowed up to three minutes to finish his move - if this cannot be done, the game is annulled.

<text>Wu Yi (born November 1938) is a retired Chinese politician who served as a Vice Premier of China between 2003 and 2008. She was one of the country&#x27;s most visible leaders during the first decade of the 21st century, best known for taking on the role of Minister of Health from April 2003 during the SARS outbreak, shortly after becoming vice premier. She was also a member of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party. She has since retired and left public life. She was commonly referred to as the &quot;iron lady&quot; by Chinese media, and was known to be a tough negotiator internationally.
==Early life==
Wu was born in November 1938 to an ordinary intellectual family based in Wuhan, but she traces her ancestry to nearby Huangmei County in Hubei province. She was the younger of two children. Her parents died while she was young, so she was brought up by her brother, who was eight years her senior. In April 1962, she joined the Chinese Communist Party. In August of the same year, she graduated from the Petroleum Refinery department at the Beijing Petroleum Institute, with a degree in petroleum engineering. She spent much of her career as a petroleum technician, eventually becoming deputy manager at the Beijing Dongfang Hong refinery, and assistant manager and party secretary at the Beijing Yanshan Petrochemical Corporation.

== Career ==
She was elected deputy mayor of Beijing in 1988, and held that office until 1991. Following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, she persuaded coal workers threatening to go on strike to continue working after some of their colleagues had been killed. From 1991 until 1998, she held successively the posts of Deputy Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation, and member of the 14th and 15th Central Committees of the Chinese Communist Party. A protégé of Zhu Rongji, she became a State Councilor in 1998, and was appointed Vice Premier of the State Council in Wen Jiabao government in March 2003. She was the first woman to hold the position since economic reforms began in 1978, and arguably the most powerful woman in Chinese politics since Mao&#x27;s wife Jiang Qing. She helped negotiate the PRC&#x27;s entry into the World Trade Organization and re-organised the customs service after U.S. complaints over the widespread violation of intellectual property rights.

During the SARS crisis, she replaced Zhang Wenkang, who had been fired for his role in the cover-up of the crisis, as health minister. She headed a committee to solve the crisis. Wu was praised internationally for her handling of the crisis. She was called the &quot;Goddess of Transparency&quot; by Time magazine for her leadership during the SARS crisis and named one of the Time 100 Most Influential People of 2004.

In early 2007, an ailing Huang Ju, who was serving as senior Vice Premier at the time, could no longer continue fulfilling his duties. It was reported that Wu Yi would take over work in the financial sector which was formerly the portfolio of Huang. After Huang died in office in June 2007 Wu became the senior-most ranked Vice Premier. Also in 2007, a coordination committee was formed to oversee quality control of consumer goods as well as food safety, and Wu was named its leader. There was speculation that Wu may continue to serve despite having reached the informal retirement age of 68.

At the 17th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, Wu was not named to the new Politburo. A month later, answering speculation about her political future at a U.S.-China Chamber of Commerce meeting, Wu said that she intends to &quot;retire completely&quot; (i.e. , &quot;luotui&quot;), and said that she will not take on any office, whether &quot;official, semi-official, or with civic organizations.&quot; She also remarked that she wanted everyone to simply forget about her. During the last few months of her tenure she was involved in negotiations with U.S. toy giant Mattel over toy lead content that damaged the reputation of Chinese-made products. At a meeting held with Chinese business leaders in early 2008 Wu revealed that her personal salary totaled 120,000 yuan, or approximately $17,600 per year at the time, and told the business leaders that they should only &quot;take money from the right places&quot;.

Wu retired from politics in March 2008 after she stepped down as Vice Premier.

==Public image and personal life==
Called by Chinese media as the &quot;Iron Lady of China&quot;, Wu was regarded as a firm and direct woman who, unlike her mostly male colleagues, chose not to dye her graying hair black. Wu did not marry all her life. When questioned about this, Wu said, &quot;it&#x27;s not that I have always wanted to be alone, it&#x27;s just that life has never given me the opportunity [for romance]; no one has ever entered my life in this way.&quot;

&quot;Forbes&quot; magazine considered her the second most powerful woman in the world in 2004, 2005 and 2007 and the third most powerful in 2006.

<doc id="568509" wikidata="Q1758513" url="?curid=568509" title="Efferent nerve fiber">
<text>Efferent nerve fibers are the axons of efferent neurons that exit a particular region. These terms have a slightly different meaning in the context of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS). The efferent fiber is a long process projecting far from the neuron&#x27;s body that carries nerve impulses away from the central nervous system toward the peripheral effector organs (muscles and glands). A bundle of these fibers constitute an efferent nerve. The opposite direction of neural activity is afferent conduction, which carries impulses by way of the afferent nerve fibers of sensory neurons.

In the nervous system, there is a &quot;closed loop&quot; system of sensation, decision, and reactions. This process is carried out through the activity of sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons.

In the CNS, afferent and efferent projections can be from the perspective of any given brain region. That is, each brain region has its own unique set of afferent and efferent projections. In the context of a given brain region, afferents are arriving fibers while efferents are exiting fibers.

==Structure==
===Motor nerve===
The efferent nerve fibers of motor neurons are involved in muscle control, both skeletal and smooth muscle. The cell body of the motor neuron is connected to a single, long axon and several shorter dendrites projecting out of the cell body itself. This axon then forms a neuromuscular junction with the effectors. The cell body of the motor neuron is satellite-shaped. The motor neuron is present in the grey matter of the spinal cord and medulla oblongata, and forms an electrochemical pathway to the or muscle. Besides motor nerves, there are efferent sensory nerves that often serve to adjust the sensitivity of the signal relayed by the afferent sensory nerve.

===Types===
There are three types of efferent fibers: general somatic efferent fibers (GSE), general visceral efferent fibers (GVE) and special visceral efferent fibers (SVE).

Subtypes of general somatic efferent fibers include: alpha motor neurons (α) – these target extrafusal muscle fibers, and gamma motor neurons (γ) that target intrafusal muscle fibers. Beta motor neurons target both types of muscle fiber and there are two types known as &quot;static&quot; and &quot;dynamic&quot;.

==Etymology and mnemonics==
Both afferent and efferent come from French, evolved from Latin (the basis of many terms in medicine and biology) for the terms, respectively, &quot;ad ferens&quot; (Latin verb &quot;ferre&quot;: carry), meaning &quot;carrying into&quot;, and &quot;ex ferens&quot;, meaning &quot;carrying away&quot; (&quot;ad&quot; literally means &quot;to&quot;, and &quot;e&quot; = &quot;ex&quot; means &quot;from&quot;). &quot;Ad&quot; and &quot;ex&quot; give an easy mnemonic device for remembering the relationship between &quot;afferent&quot; and &quot;efferent&quot;: afferent connection arrives&quot; and an efferent connection exits&quot;.

Afferent and efferent are connected to affect and effect through their common Latin roots: Afferent nerves affect the subject, whereas efferent nerves allow the subject to effect change.

<text>Hurricane Lenny was the strongest November Atlantic hurricane since the 1932 Cuba hurricane. It was the sixteenth tropical cyclone, twelfth named storm, eighth hurricane, and record-breaking fifth Category 4 hurricane in the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season. Lenny formed on November 13 in the western Caribbean Sea at around 18:00 UTC and went on to form and maintain an unusual and unprecedented easterly track for its entire duration, which gave it the common nickname, &quot;Wrong Way Lenny&quot;. It attained hurricane status south of Jamaica on November 15 and passed south of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico over the next few days. Lenny rapidly intensified over the northeastern Caribbean on November 17, attaining peak winds of about south of Saint Croix in the United States Virgin Islands. It gradually weakened while moving through the Leeward Islands, eventually dissipating on November 23 over the open Atlantic Ocean.

Before moving through the Lesser Antilles, Lenny produced rough surf that killed two people in northern Colombia. Strong winds and rainfall resulted in heavy crop damage in southeastern Puerto Rico. Despite the hurricane&#x27;s passage near Saint Croix at peak intensity, damage on the small island was only described as &quot;moderate&quot;, although there was widespread flooding and erosion. Damage in the United States territories totaled about $330 million. The highest precipitation total was at the police station on the French side of Saint Martin. On the island, the hurricane killed three people and destroyed more than 200 properties. In nearby Antigua and Barbuda, the hurricane killed one person; torrential rainfall there contaminated the local water supply. Significant storm damage occurred as far south as Grenada, where high surf isolated towns from the capital city.

== Meteorological history ==

Hurricane Lenny began as a low-pressure area that was first observed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November 8. It developed an area of convection but remained poorly defined for the next few days. Thunderstorms spread across the region, producing heavy rainfall in portions of Mexico and Central America. On November 13, the system became better organized; a Hurricane Hunters flight later that day discovered a surface circulation and winds of about . The data indicated the development of Tropical Depression Sixteen at 1800 UTC, about south of the Cayman Islands. The depression&#x27;s convection was fairly disorganized, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not anticipate any strengthening for three days. For much of its existence, the tropical cyclone maintained a track from west to east across the Caribbean Sea, which was unprecedented in the Atlantic hurricane database, earning it the nicknames &quot;Left-Hand Lenny&quot; and &quot;Wrong Way Lenny&quot;. The path resulted from its movement along the southern end of a trough over the western Atlantic Ocean.

After its formation, the depression gradually became better organized; the NHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Lenny on November 14, based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters. When it was first upgraded to a tropical storm, the cyclone already had winds of and a developing eye feature. At 0000 UTC on November 15, Lenny attained hurricane status about southwest of Kingston, Jamaica. The quick intensification was unexpected and occurred after a large area of convection blossomed over the center. At the same time, Lenny developed an anticyclone aloft, which provided favorable conditions for the hurricane&#x27;s development. After moving east-southeastward during its initial development stages, the hurricane turned more to the east on November 15. The Hurricane Hunters reported winds of , which indicated that Lenny had become a Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. However, the cloud pattern subsequently became less organized as the eye disappeared, and Lenny&#x27;s winds weakened to while the hurricane passed south of Hispaniola. The NHC noted the deterioration could have been due to a disruption of the storm&#x27;s small inner core by &quot;subtle environmental changes&quot;. After the sudden weakening, the Hurricane Hunters reported that the eye had reformed and the hurricane&#x27;s winds had reached . At the time, a ridge was expected to build to Lenny&#x27;s east and turn the storm northeastward into Puerto Rico 24 hours later.

Beginning on November 16, Hurricane Lenny underwent a 24-hour period of rapid deepening, reaching major hurricane status about south of the Mona Passage. It developed well-defined banding features, good outflow, and a circular eye that was visible from the radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The hurricane continued to become better organized, with an eye in diameter surrounded by a closed eyewall. Around 1200 UTC on November 17, Lenny intensified into a Category 4 hurricane while approaching the islands of the northeastern Caribbean. It was the fifth storm of such intensity in the year, setting the record for most Category 4 hurricanes in a season. The hurricane then made its closest approach to Puerto Rico, passing about southeast of Maunabo. Shortly thereafter, Lenny attained peak winds of while passing south of the island of Saint Croix in the United States Virgin Islands. This made it the fourth-strongest hurricane on record to form during the month of November. Hurricane Hunters reported Lenny&#x27;s peak winds in the southeastern portion of the hurricane; the group also reported a minimum pressure of 933 mbar, a drop of 34 mbar in 24 hours. In addition, a dropsonde recorded winds of while descending to the surface, the highest dropsonde wind speed recording in a hurricane at the time.

Around the time it peaked in intensity, Lenny&#x27;s forward speed decreased in response to light steering currents between two ridges. Despite favorable conditions for strengthening, the hurricane weakened as it turned to an eastward drift, possibly due to the upwelling of cooler waters. Late on November 18, Lenny&#x27;s eye moved over Saint Martin with winds of . After continued weakening, the hurricane struck Anguilla and Saint Barthélemy the next day. It turned southeastward while still drifting, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the islands across the northeastern Caribbean. Late on November 19, Lenny weakened to tropical storm intensity after increased wind shear exposed the cyclone&#x27;s center from the deepest convection. Early on November 20, the storm made landfall on Anguilla, although by then the center had become difficult to locate. Later that day, the cyclone exited the Caribbean, continuing its southeast track. On November 21, Lenny turned to the northeast and weakened to a tropical depression. The deep convection was located at least east of the increasingly elongated center. Lenny turned to the east for the final time early on November 22, dissipating on the next day about east of the Lesser Antilles.

== Preparations ==

Early in Lenny&#x27;s existence, a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were issued for Jamaica. Later, a hurricane watch was issued for the southern coast of Hispaniola, and a tropical storm warning was also issued for the Dominican Republic. Haitian officials declared a state of alert in three southern provinces and allocated about $1 million (1999 USD) in hurricane funds. Residents in flood-prone areas were advised to evacuate in southern Haiti and in the neighboring Dominican Republic.

A hurricane watch was issued for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands late on November 15, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning six hours later. By that time, Lenny was projected to move over Puerto Rico. After Lenny made its closest approach to the island, the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning on November 17, which was discontinued the following day along with the advisories in the Virgin Islands. In Puerto Rico, the media maintained continuous coverage on the hurricane based on statements and warnings from the San Juan National Weather Service office. Based on the coverage, the public was well informed of the hurricane&#x27;s threat to the island. Before the storm and as a result of its impact, around 4,700 people evacuated to 191 shelters. This included 1,190 residents in Ponce who evacuated to 27 schools, as well as 584 people in western Puerto Rico. Officials closed all schools, banned the sale of alcohol, and ordered a freeze on the price of emergency supplies. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated six medical assistance teams, three medical support teams, and two advance medical assessment units. The agency stored five days&#x27; worth of food in schools in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Before the hurricane&#x27;s arrival, U.S. Virgin Islands governor Charles Wesley Turnbull declared a state of emergency. In St. Croix, 309 people rode out the storm in shelters. Officials opened eight shelters in the British Virgin Islands. There, airlines and hotels assisted in evacuating tourists from the area.

Governments across the eastern Caribbean issued hurricane warnings as far south as Montserrat. In Anguilla, residents near the coast were advised to evacuate. Schools closed ahead of the storm, and the ferry between the island and Saint Martin was halted and moved to a safe location. In Saint Kitts and Nevis, the National Emergency Management Agency was activated on November 16. Officials there advised residents living near ghauts to evacuate, and one shelter was located in each district of the country. In addition, stores were open for longer hours to allow people to stock up on supplies. Most businesses and schools were closed in Antigua and Barbuda during the storm, while in Dominica, the airport was closed. Further south, there was little warning for the hurricane in Grenada, and most people left their boats in the water.

==Impact==
Across the eastern Caribbean, Hurricane Lenny damaged vital infrastructure, including roads and piers in the tourism-dependent islands. Most of the islands&#x27; tourism areas were on western-facing beaches, many of which were unprepared for the high waves and winds produced by Lenny.

===Central Caribbean===
Early in its existence, Lenny produced large waves and high tides along the Guajira Peninsula in Colombia, sinking two boats and flooding 1,200 houses. There were also reports of flooded businesses and damaged crops. In the country, strong winds on the storm&#x27;s fringe killed a man by striking him with a beam. Although there were initial reports of nine people missing, only two were counted in the death toll for mainland Colombia. Two sailors were killed offshore when their yacht was lost in the southern Caribbean Sea.

Along the ABC Islands off the north coast of Venezuela, the hurricane produced waves along the southwest coastlines. The waves caused heavy beach erosion and coastal damage to properties and boats.

In Jamaica, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall but left little damage. Rains in the Dominican Republic caused flooding in the country&#x27;s southwest portion. Flooding around Les Cayes in southwestern Haiti destroyed 60 percent of the rice, corn, and banana plantations, while high waves wrecked several houses in Cavaellon.

Hurricane Lenny was originally forecast to strike Puerto Rico, although it remained south of the island. Beginning on November 17, Lenny affected Puerto Rico with gusty winds and heavy rainfall. Rainfall in the days prior to Lenny&#x27;s approach left areas susceptible to flooding, which caused many rivers in the northeastern portion of the island to overflow their banks following the storm. Such flooding forced towns to evacuate along the rivers, and also resulted in the closure of secondary and primary highways. The heavy rains also caused mudslides and rockslides. The peak rainfall on the island was in Jayuya in central Puerto Rico. Tides in San Juan were about above normal. There, high seas washed a freighter ashore. Winds in the Puerto Rican mainland were not significant, gusting to in Ceiba. The storm left 22,000 people without power and 103,000 people without water. Because of the heavy rainfall, about 200 farmers in southeastern Puerto Rico sustained about $19 million in crop damage (1999 USD). In the affected region, the heavy rainfall destroyed 80 percent of the vegetables and 50 percent of the plantains. Damage throughout the island totaled $105 million (1999 USD).

===Virgin Islands===

After passing southeast of Puerto Rico, Hurricane Lenny struck St. Croix in the United States Virgin Islands, although its strongest winds remained southeast of the island. There, gusts reached , while sustained winds officially peaked around . Strong winds damaged the roofs of many houses in eastern St. Croix and knocked down trees and power lines. The winds left severe damage to vegetation after fruits and vegetables were blown away. Rainfall peaked at , which caused widespread flooding of many properties in the island&#x27;s western portion. In Frederiksted, the hurricane produced a storm surge of along with high waves that washed out roads and damaged coastal structures. There was also severe beach erosion in western St. Croix; high waves dumped of sand onto coastal roads about inland, and also washed several boats ashore. The National Weather Service described the damage as &quot;moderate&quot;.

Elsewhere in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Lenny produced a storm surge of about in St. Thomas. Sustained winds on the island reached at the Cyril E. King Airport, with gusts to . On nearby St. John, wind gusts reached , and sustained hurricane-force winds of were reported on Maria Hill. Rains were not as heavy as on St. Croix; the maximum amounts were on St. Thomas and on St. John. Both islands reported beach erosion along their southern coastlines. Damage on St. Thomas was minimal, limited to minor flooding and mudslides. The Virgin Islands National Park in St. John reported over $1.6 million in damage (1999 USD). In Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the hurricane left about $330 million in damage (1999 USD), but caused no deaths.

In Virgin Gorda in the nearby British Virgin Islands, the hurricane produced sustained winds of , with gusts to . Rainfall amounted to around and caused a mudslide near Coxheath. High waves eroded a portion of Sir Francis Drake Highway, and the high winds destroyed the roof of an apartment. Property damage in the British Virgin Islands totaled $5.6 million (1999 USD); however, the damage combined with the loss of tourism and productivity yielded a loss of $22 million to the islands&#x27; economy, or 3.1 percent of the gross domestic product.
===Northern Leeward Islands===
====Anguilla====
The eye of Lenny moved over Anguilla, an island located east of the British Virgin Islands. Localized flooding was reported, including in the capital, The Valley, where waters reportedly reached a depth of . The hurricane struck only a month after Hurricane Jose had affected the region, causing significant beach erosion along Anguilla&#x27;s coastline. Damage from Lenny amounted to $65.8 million.

====Saint Barthélémy and Saint Martin====

On Saint Barthélemy, the hurricane produced record-breaking precipitation of around . Waves reached on the island&#x27;s western portion. The highest precipitation related to the storm occurred at the police station on the French side of Saint Martin, where a total of was recorded. This included a record 24-hour total of . Total damage was extensive but not as extreme or catastrophic as Hurricane Luis in 1995.

====The Dutch Antilles====
The SSS Islands, which include Saba, Sint Eustatius, and Sint Maarten, were in the path of Hurricane Lenny on November 18 through 19. On Saba, there was an unofficial wind gust of before the instrument blew away. The island sustained damage to several buildings, including airport facilities. On the Dutch side of the island of Saint Martin, rainfall peaked at in Philipsburg. The rains resulted in mudslides and flooding and were the primary form of impact on the island. For 36 hours, the island experienced tropical storm conditions, and there were three times when the winds surpassed hurricane force. Sustained winds on the island peaked at at the Princess Juliana International Airport; these were the highest sustained winds observed on land. The airport also reported a wind gust of .
As a result, the three SSS Islands sustained power and telephone outages. There was widespread destruction of the roofs of houses across the island, and over 200 houses were destroyed. Damage was estimated at $69 million, and there were three deaths on the Dutch side of St. Martin. Two of these deaths were from flying debris, and the other was due to a collapsed roadway.

Due to the hurricane&#x27;s unusual track from the west, it produced unparalleled waves of along the western coast of St. Martin, which damaged or destroyed many boats. During its passage, Lenny left widespread damage to the infrastructure, including to the airport, harbor, resorts, power utilities, schools, and hospitals.

===Antigua and Barbuda===
While passing over Antigua, Hurricane Lenny dropped of rain at the V. C. Bird International Airport, while locations in the southern portion recorded over . The rainfall caused severe flooding in Antigua, resulting in landslides in the northwestern and southern portion of the island. Flooding washed out major roadways, including one bridge. Along the coast, the storm caused severe beach erosion. About 65 percent of Barbuda experienced flooding due to the rainfall and the island&#x27;s flat topography. The flooding contaminated the water storage facilities and all private wells. About 95 percent of the crops in Barbuda were destroyed. Damage in the country of Antigua and Barbuda totaled $51.3 million, and there was one death.

===Saint Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat===
The hurricane&#x27;s waves reached along the coasts of Saint Kitts and Nevis, washing up to inland. Several businesses were flooded, and some beach erosion was reported. The hurricane destroyed 46 homes and damaged 332 others to varying degree. Home damage forced four families to evacuate. Heavy rains caused mudslides on Saint Kitts, and heavy damage occurred in Old Road Town. Damage in the country amounted to $41.4 million. In Montserrat, damage was reported along its western coastline. After high waves capsized a boat, a crew of three required rescue.

===Guadeloupe===

Guadeloupe received record precipitation amounts in some areas, generally ranging from . On Basse-Terre, the western island of Guadeloupe, the hurricane produced a significant wave height of , with estimates as high as . There were five deaths, especially from drowning and electrocution in Guadeloupe and damage in the island totaled at least $100 million.

Although there were no tropical-storm sustained wind recorded as the storm didn&#x27;t really impacted the islands unlike previous hurricanes such as Luis, Marilyn and Georges, the extent of damage was globally heavier due to the unusual high waves in the western portion of the island and the very slow-moving storm that generated unrelated flooding inland in Grande-Terre for a 48 hour-period.

===Dominica===
In Dominica, high waves damaged the island&#x27;s western coastal highway, leaving the most heavily traveled road temporarily closed. Road closures cut off links between towns on the island. The hurricane destroyed at least 50 homes, including 3 that were washed away by the waves. Hotels along the island&#x27;s west coast sustained heavy damage, and across the nation the hurricane&#x27;s impact was worse than that from Hurricane Luis four years prior. Damage on the island totaled $21.5 million.

===Windward Islands===
Rainfall of around reached as far south as Martinique, where one person was killed. 
Further south, high waves in Saint Lucia washed away beaches, a seawall, and coastal walkways. At least 40 houses were damaged along the coast, which left several families homeless. Damage in the country totaled $6.6 million. In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, the hurricane washed away four buildings and damaged five others. About 50 people were left homeless in the country.

In western Grenada, high waves affected much of the coastline, destroying 21 small boats and causing significant beach erosion. The waves covered the entire Grand Anse Beach in Saint George Parish. The erosion heavily impacted tourist areas and also threatened the foundation of the runway at the Maurice Bishop International Airport. Storm damage cut off the towns in western Grenada from the capital city of Saint George&#x27;s. The cut-off roads resulted in an island-wide fuel shortage. In Saint John Parish, the storm knocked out the water and power supply and forced several families to evacuate their damaged houses. The small island Carriacou, located north of Grenada, sustained damage to the road to its primary airport. At least 10 homes were destroyed in the country, and damage totaled $94.6 million; this represented 27 percent of the island&#x27;s gross domestic product. Effects from the storm reached as far south as Trinidad and Tobago. In the country, storm surge caused damage to boats and coastal structures, while beach erosion was reported in Tobago.

==Aftermath==

Following heavy damage to the coral reef around Curaçao, workers placed reef balls to assist in replenishing the damaged structure. In Puerto Rico, workers quickly responded to power and water outages. Similarly on Saint Croix, power systems were quickly restored. On November 23, U.S. President Bill Clinton declared the U.S. Virgin Islands a disaster area. This allocated federal funding for loans to public and private entities and provided 75 percent of the cost of debris removal. By December 10, nearly 3,000 residents had applied for assistance, mostly on St. Croix. In response, the federal government provided about $480,000 to the affected people. The United States Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided $185,000, mostly directed toward the United Nations Development Programme, for aid to other islands in the eastern Caribbean. Other agencies, including the Caribbean Development Bank, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Department for International Development, and the European Union, provided $1.1 million in assistance.

In response to the damage on Saint Martin, officials in the Netherlands Antilles issued an appeal to the European Parliament for assistance from the international community. Due to their small population and area, the small islands of the eastern Caribbean required international funding to repair the damage from the hurricane and return to normal. In Antigua and Barbuda, officials worked quickly to repair roads and clean Barbuda&#x27;s water system. However, 20,000 people in Antigua remained without water for a week after the hurricane, and the stagnant water caused an increase in mosquitoes. The government of Dominica provided 42 families with temporary shelters. With a loan from the Caribbean Development Bank, the government worked to complete a sea wall along a highway south of its capital Roseau. The Saint Lucian government provided housing to 70 families. In Grenada, workers repaired the road system to allow fuel transportation across the island and began to reclaim land near its airport to mitigate erosion. Regions in Antigua and Grenada were declared disaster areas. Across the eastern Caribbean, local Red Cross offices provided food and shelter to affected citizens. High damage to tourist areas caused a short term suspension of cruise ship arrivals. A damaged hotel in Nevis left 800 people unemployed due to its closure.

=== Retirement ===
Due to its effects, the name Lenny was retired by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 2000, and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. The name was replaced with &quot;Lee&quot; in the 2005 season.

<doc id="568531" wikidata="Q2141688" url="?curid=568531" title="Richard D. Ryder">
<text>Richard Hood Jack Dudley Ryder (born 3 July 1940) is an English writer, psychologist, and animal rights advocate. Ryder became known in the 1970s as a member of the Oxford Group, a group of intellectuals loosely centred on the University of Oxford who began to speak out against animal use, in particular factory farming and animal research. He was working at the time as a clinical psychologist at the Warneford Hospital in Oxford, and had himself been involved in animal research in the United Kingdom and United States.

In 1970, Ryder coined the term &quot;speciesism&quot; to describe the exclusion of nonhuman animals from the protections available to human beings. In 1977, he became chairman of the RSPCA Council, serving until 1979, and helped to organize the first academic animal-rights conference, held in August 1977 at Trinity College, Cambridge. The conference produced a &quot;Declaration Against Speciesism&quot;, signed by 150 people.

Ryder assisted in achieving the legislative animal protection reforms in the UK and EU between the years 1970 and 2020. He is the author of a number of books about animal research, animal rights, and morality in politics, including &quot;Victims of Science&quot; (1975), &quot;Animal Revolution&quot; (1989), and &quot;Painism: A Modern Morality&quot; (2001). Ryder was president of the RSPCA from 2020–2023.

==Background==
Richard Hood Jack Dudley Ryder was born at The London Clinic, Marylebone, on 3 July 1940, to Major Douglas Claud &quot;Jack&quot; Dudley Ryder, and his second wife, Vera Hamilton-Fletcher (née Cook). Jack Dudley Ryder was the great-grandson of the Honourable Granville Ryder (1799–1879), second son of Dudley Ryder, 1st Earl of Harrowby (1762–1847). Ryder was raised on the family estate, Rempstone Hall, in Corfe Castle.

Ryder was educated at Sherborne School, in Dorset, England. He obtained his bachelor&#x27;s degree in experimental psychology from the University of Cambridge (1960–1963), followed by a period of research into animal behaviour at Columbia University, and a diploma in clinical psychology from the University of Edinburgh. After Edinburgh, he worked as a clinical psychologist at the Warneford psychiatric hospital in Oxford. In 1983 and 1987 he ran unsuccessfully for Parliament, and founded the Liberal Democrats&#x27; Animal Protection Group. He later went back to Cambridge, and was awarded his PhD in Social and Political Sciences in 1993. He held an Andrew W. Mellon visiting professorship at Tulane University in New Orleans in 1996. He is President of the Animal Interfaith Alliance.

Ryder married Audrey Jane Smith in 1974; they had two children together and divorced in 1999.

==Animal rights advocacy==

===Oxford Group===

Ryder first became involved with animal rights in 1969, when he protested against an otter hunt in Dorset. He was working at the time in the Warneford psychiatric hospital, and in April and May that year had three letters to the editor published in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, the first one headed &quot;Rights of Non Human Animals,&quot; in which he criticised experiments on animals based on his own experiences in universities as an animal researcher. There was an increase in interest in animal rights during this period, following the publication of Ruth Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Animal Machines&quot; (1964), a critique of factory farming, and a long article, &quot;The Rights of Animals&quot; (10 October 1965), by the novelist Brigid Brophy in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.

Brophy saw Ryder&#x27;s letters in the &quot;Telegraph&quot;, and put him in touch with three philosophy postgraduate students at Oxford—Roslind Godlovitch, Stanley Godlovitch, and John Harris—who were editing a collection of essays about animal rights, published as &quot;Animals, Men and Morals: An Inquiry into the Maltreatment of Non-humans&quot; (1971). Ryder became involved with the group—which he later called the &quot;Oxford Group&quot;—and became an activist for animal rights, organising meetings and printing and handing out leaflets. He also became a contributor to the Godlovitches/Harris book. He was interviewed several times on the radio, and in December 1970 took part in a televised debate in Scotland on animal rights with Brophy.

===Speciesism===

Ryder first used the term &quot;speciesism&quot; in a privately printed leaflet by the same name, which he distributed in Oxford in 1970 in protest against animal experimentation; he wrote that he thought of the word while lying in the bath in the Old Manor House in Sunningwell, Oxfordshire. Paul Waldau writes that Ryder used the term in the pamphlet to address experiments on animals that he regarded as illogical, and which, he argued, a fully informed moral agent would challenge. Ryder was also addressing the general attitude that excluded all nonhumans from the protections offered to humans, now known as the anti-speciesism critique. Waldau writes that this original definition of the term – in effect, human-speciesism – has been extended by others to refer to the assignment of value to any being on the basis of species membership alone, so that, for example, prioritising the value of chimpanzees over other animals (human-chimpanzee speciesism) might be seen as similarly illogical.

Ryder used the term again in his contribution to the Godlovitches/Harris book, in an essay called &quot;Experiments on Animals&quot; (1971). He wrote in the essay that animal researchers seek to have it both ways: they defend the scientific validity of animal experiments on the grounds of the similarity between humans and nonhumans, while defending the morality of it on the grounds of the differences. He argued that speciesism is as illogical as racism, writing that &quot;species&quot; and &quot;race&quot; are both vague terms, and asked: &quot;If, under special conditions, it were one day found possible to cross a professor of biology with an ape, would the offspring be kept in a cage or in a cradle?&quot;

The book was reviewed by Peter Singer in 1973 in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, in which he argued that it was a call for the foundation of an animal liberation movement. The article led the &quot;New York Review&quot; to commission a book from Singer, published as &quot;Animal Liberation&quot; (1975). Singer used the term &quot;speciesism&quot; in the book, attributing it to Ryder, and included it the title of his fifth chapter – &quot;Man&#x27;s Dominion ... &quot;a short history of speciesism&quot;&quot;. Writing that it was not an attractive word, he defined it as &quot;a prejudice or attitude of bias in favour of the interests of members of one&#x27;s own species and against those of members of other species&quot;, and argued that it was a prejudice similar to racism and sexism. Singer wrote:

Racists violate the principle of equality by giving greater weight to the interests of members of their own race when there is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of another race. Sexists violate the principle of equality by favouring the interests of their own sex. Similarly, speciesists allows the interests of their own species to override the greater interests of members of other species. The pattern is identical in each case.

Singer&#x27;s use of the term popularised it, and in 1985 became an entry in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, described as &quot;discrimination against ... animal species by human beings, based on an assumption of mankind&#x27;s superiority&quot;.

===RSPCA Reform Group===

The RSPCA Reform Group was founded in 1970 by members of the British RSPCA. Their aim was to change the direction of the RSPCA from an organisation that dealt mostly with companion animals into one that would oppose what the reformers saw as the key issues: factory farming, animal research, hunting, and bloodsports. They sought to secure the election of reformers – including Ryder and Andrew Linzey, the Oxford theologian – to the RSPCA&#x27;s ruling council. As a result, Ryder was elected to the council in 1971, became its vice-chairman in 1976, then chairman from 1977 to 1979.

===Painism===
Ryder coined the term &quot;painism&quot; in 1990 to describe his position that all beings who feel pain deserve rights. He argues that painism can be seen as a third way between Peter Singer&#x27;s utilitarian position and Tom Regan&#x27;s deontological rights view. It combines the utilitarian view that moral status comes from the ability to feel pain with the rights-view prohibition on using others as a means to an end. He has criticised Regan&#x27;s criterion for inherent worth, arguing that all beings who feel pain have inherent value. He has also criticised the utilitarian idea that exploitation of others can be justified if there is an overall gain in pleasure. He wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2005: &quot;One of the problems with the utilitarian view is that, for example, the sufferings of a gang-rape victim can be justified if the rape gives a greater sum total of pleasure to the rapists.&quot; Ryder argues that this is a problem because &quot;consciousness ... is bounded by the boundaries of the individual. My pain and the pain of others are thus in separate categories; you cannot add or subtract them from each other. ... In any situation we should ... concern ourselves primarily with the pain of the individual who is the maximum sufferer.&quot;

Ryder was featured in the 2012 speciesism movie, &quot;The Superior Human?&quot;, in which he describes his coining of the word &quot;speciesism&quot; and the principle of painism.

===Oxford animal laboratory===
Ryder is a supporter of VERO (Voice for Ethical Research at Oxford), a group of Oxford members and graduates formed in 2006 to protest the construction by the university of a new animal laboratory, the Biomedical Sciences Building, completed in 2008.

<doc id="568571" wikidata="Q154145" url="?curid=568571" title="Gabriel Marcel">
<text>Gabriel Honoré Marcel (7 December 1889 – 8 October 1973) was a French philosopher, playwright, music critic and leading Christian existentialist. The author of over a dozen books and at least thirty plays, Marcel&#x27;s work focused on the modern individual&#x27;s struggle in a technologically dehumanizing society. Though often regarded as the first French existentialist, he dissociated himself from figures such as Jean-Paul Sartre, preferring the term &quot;philosophy of existence&quot; or &quot;neo-Socrateanism&quot; to define his own thought. &quot;The Mystery of Being&quot; is a well-known two-volume work authored by Marcel.

==Early life and education==
Marcel was born on 7 December 1889 in Paris, France. His mother Laure Meyer, who was Jewish, died when he was young and he was brought up by his aunt and father, Henry Marcel. When he was eight he moved for a year where his father was minister plenipotentiary.

Marcel completed his DES thesis (&quot;&quot;, roughly equivalent to an MA thesis) and obtained the &quot;agrégation&quot; in philosophy from the Sorbonne in 1910, at the unusually young age of 20. During the First World War he worked as head of the Information Service, organized by the Red Cross to convey news of injured soldiers to their families. He taught in secondary schools, was a drama critic for various literary journals, and worked as an editor for Plon, the major French Catholic publisher.

Marcel was the son of an agnostic, and was himself not a member of any organized religion until his conversion to Catholicism in 1929. Marcel was opposed to anti-Semitism and supported reaching out to non-Catholics.

He died 8 October 1973 in Paris.

==Existential themes==
He is often classified as one of the earliest existentialists, although he dreaded being placed in the same category as Jean-Paul Sartre; Marcel came to prefer the label &quot;neo-Socratic&quot; (possibly because of Søren Kierkegaard, the father of Christian existentialism, who was a neo-Socratic thinker himself). While Marcel recognized that human interaction often involved objective characterisation of &quot;the other&quot;, he still asserted the possibility of &quot;communion&quot; – a state where both individuals can perceive each other&#x27;s subjectivity.

In &quot;The Existential Background of Human Dignity&quot;, Marcel refers to a play he had written in 1913 entitled &quot;Le Palais de Sable&quot;, in order to provide an example of a person who was unable to treat others as subjects.

Roger Moirans, the central character of the play, is a politician, a conservative who is dedicated to defending the rights of Catholicism against free thought. He has set himself up as the champion of traditional monarchy and has just achieved a great success in the city council where he has attacked the secularism of public schools. It is natural enough that he should be opposed to the divorce of his daughter Therese, who wants to leave her unfaithful husband and start her life afresh. In this instance he proves himself virtually heartless; all his tenderness goes out to his second daughter, Clarisse, whom he takes to be spiritually very much like himself. But now Clarisse tells him that she has decided to take the veil and become a Carmelite. Moirans is horrified by the idea that this creature, so lovely, intelligent, and full of life, might go and bury herself in a convent and he decides to do his utmost to make her give up her intention... Clarisse is deeply shocked; her father now appears to her as an impostor, virtually as a deliberate fraud...

In this case, Moirans is unable to treat either of his daughters as a subject, instead rejecting both because each does not conform to her objectified image in his mind. Marcel notes that such objectification &quot;does no less than denude its object of the one thing which he has which is of value, and so it degrades him effectively.&quot;

Another related major thread in Marcel was the struggle to protect one&#x27;s subjectivity from annihilation by modern materialism and a technologically driven society. Marcel argued that scientific egoism replaces the &quot;mystery&quot; of being with a false scenario of human life composed of technical &quot;problems&quot; and &quot;solutions&quot;. For Marcel, the human subject cannot exist in the technological world, instead being replaced by a human object. As he points out in &quot;Man Against Mass Society&quot; and other works, technology has a privileged authority with which it persuades the subject to accept his place as &quot;he&quot; in the internal dialogue of science; and as a result, man is convinced by science to rejoice in his own annihilation.

==Influence==

For many years, Marcel hosted a weekly philosophy discussion group through which he met and influenced important younger French philosophers like Jean Wahl, Paul Ricœur, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Marcel was puzzled and disappointed that his reputation was almost entirely based on his philosophical treatises and not on his plays, which he wrote in the hope of appealing to a wider lay audience. He also influenced phenomenologist and Thomistic philosopher Karol Wojtyla (later Pope John Paul II), who drew on Marcel&#x27;s distinction between &quot;being&quot; and &quot;having&quot; in his critique of technological change.

===Main works===
Marcel&#x27;s major books are the &quot;Metaphysical Journal&quot; (1927), &quot;Being and Having&quot; (1933), &quot;Homo Viator&quot; (1945), and &quot;Man Against Mass Society&quot; (1955). He gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Aberdeen between 1949 and 1950, which were published as &quot;The Mystery of Being&quot; (1951). He also gave the William James Lectures at Harvard in 1961–1962, which were subsequently published as &quot;The Existential Background of Human Dignity&quot;.

<text>Maturín () is a city in Venezuela, the capital of the Venezuelan state of Monagas and a centre for instrumental exploration and development of the petroleum industry in Venezuela. The metropolitan area of Maturín has a population of 401,384 inhabitants. Maturín is also a busy regional transportation hub, connecting routes from the northeastern coast to the Orinoco Delta and the Gran Sabana.

== History ==
=== Founding ===
December 7, 1760, is the official date of the founding of Maturín (according to the Venezuelan Academy of History) by the Franciscan missionary Lucas de Zaragoza. However, the Jesuit priest Pablo Ojer found a document in the General Archive of the Indies which proves an earlier founding date for the city in 1722. This primitive town was called and its founder was the Spanish governor Juan de la Tornera y Sota. San Juan de la Tornera de Maturín was a city for Spaniards, but it did not survive very long because of the lack of population and few economic resources. Initially, (Lucas de Zaragoza gave this name to Maturín) was a Spanish mission created for the conversion of the nearby native and Warao people. The Spaniards decided to move to Maturín and in the 19th century it received the category of city and the name of .

=== Origin of the name Maturín ===

Maturín was named after an indigenous chief (cacique) who lived with his tribe next to the bank of Guarapiche River. He was murdered by a supposed Spanish captain named Arrioja during a battle between tribal members and Spaniards on the site of the town in 1718. Since then the area has been known as (&#x27;the place of Maturín&#x27;).

Some historians have concluded that the name Maturín is instead of French origin. They base their theory on the legend of a supposed French missionary who explored the area at the end of the 17th century. The legend says that the missionary (whose surname might have been Mathurin) baptized a young indigenous boy and gave him the name Mathurin, the boy later becoming . There is also the possibility that the boy may have been named after a 4th-century French saint, Saint Mathurin. However, the legend of this supposed French missionary has not been proved yet. Other historians disagree with the theory, arguing that there is a plant with the same name and indigenous place names very similar to the name &quot;Maturín&quot;.

=== Independence war ===

Maturín (as a part of the Province of Cumaná) was on the republican side during the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence on July 5, 1811. Five battles took place in Maturín from 1813 to 1814, including the famous Battle of Alto de los Godos. In this battle the Venezuelan patriots, led by Manuel Piar, obtained a great victory against the Spanish general Juan Domingo de Monteverde. Antonio José de Sucre, José Francisco Bermúdez, José Tadeo Monagas, José Gregorio Monagas and José Félix Ribas were others who fought in the five battles. 

The last battle of Maturín (December 1814), however, was a defeat. During the 1814 Caracas Exodus, many soldiers and civilians who had escaped from Caracas during the military campaign of José Tomás Boves against the Republic, came to Maturín to shelter from the Spanish troops. After the battle of Urica (where Boves died) Tomás José Morales, a Spanish general, decided to take the town. The Republicans defended the town, but they were beaten and many of them were murdered by Morales. The town was destroyed. Some survivors of the last battle rebuilt Maturín two years later.

===19th and 20th centuries ===
Maturín grew slowly during the 19th century due to civil wars (which destroyed the region&#x27;s flourishing farming and livestock-raising industries and killed many people) and fatal diseases, such as malaria and yellow fever, transmitted by mosquitoes. In 1909 Maturín became capital of the new Monagas state. Before that the town was the capital of the Province Maturín from 1856 to 1859. In the 20th century Maturín grew rapidly due to the discovery of petroleum fields near the town and a health campaign carried out by doctors to eliminate mosquitoes. Maturín has been the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Maturín since 1958.

== Geography ==
Maturin is located at 67 meters of altitude and 520 kilometres from the country&#x27;s capital, Caracas. It is right next to the Guarapiche River and is a crossroad for roads towards the center, the Caribbean coast and the Orinoco River

<text>The grey columns are three regions of the somewhat ridge-shaped mass of grey matter in the spinal cord. These regions present as three columns: the anterior grey column, the posterior grey column, and the lateral grey column, all of which are visible in cross-section of the spinal cord. 

The anterior grey column is made up of alpha motor neurons, gamma motor neurons, and small neurons thought to be interneurons. It affects the skeletal muscles.

The posterior grey column receives several types of sensory information regarding touch and sensation from receptors in the skin, bones, and joints, including fine touch, proprioception, and vibration. It contains the cell bodies of second-order sensory neurons and their synapses with the pseudounipolar first-order sensory neurons (whose cell bodies are located within the sensory ganglia (a.k.a. dorsal root ganglia)).

The lateral grey column is only present in the thoracic region and upper lumbar segments (T1-L2). It contains preganglionic cell bodies of the autonomic nervous system and sensory relay neurons.

==Structure==

===Anterior grey column===

The anterior grey column, (also known as the anterior horn of spinal cord and anterior cornu) is broad and of a rounded or quadrangular shape. Its posterior part is termed the base, and its anterior part the head, but these are not differentiated from each other by any well-defined constriction. It is separated from the surface of the spinal cord by a layer of white substance which is traversed by the bundles of the anterior nerve roots. In the thoracic region, the posterolateral part of the anterior column projects laterally as a triangular field, which is named the lateral grey column. It comprises three different types of neurons, two types of lower motor neuron – large alpha motor neurons, and medium gamma motor neurons, and small neurons thought to be interneurons. These neurons differ in both their morphology and in their patterns of connectivity. They are organized in the same manner as the muscles they innervate.

====Alpha motor neurons====
Alpha motor neurons are lower motor neurons that innervate extrafusal muscle fibers to generate force at neuromuscular junctions at the start of a muscle contraction. They have large cell bodies and receive proprioceptive input. They have been shown to reduce in population, but not in size with age. Damage to these cell bodies can lead to severe muscle weakness and loss of reflexes, and is also associated with ALS.

====Gamma motor neurons====
Gamma motor neurons innervate intrafusal muscle fibers that control the sensitivity of muscle spindles to stretch. They have smaller cell bodies than alpha motor neurons and do not receive proprioceptive input. They have been shown to reduce in numbers but not size with age.

====Small neurons====
The physiology of the small neurons in the anterior column is not well understood. Their effects can be both excitatory and inhibitory. They are suspected to be interneurons and have been shown to reduce in size but not numbers with age.

Clinical significance

It is these cells that are affected in the following diseases, – amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, progressive muscular atrophy, all spinal muscular atrophies, poliomyelitis, and West Nile virus.

Pharmacological interaction

The anterior grey column is the target for some spasmolytic medications. Norepinephrine release here, (as induced by cyclobenzaprine) reduces spasms by innervation (reducing nerve activity) of alpha motor neurons via interaction with gamma fibers.
===Posterior grey column===
The posterior grey column, also known as the posterior (or dorsal) horn of spinal cord, is subdivided into six layers known as Rexed laminae, based on the type of sensory information sent to each section. 

* Marginal nucleus of spinal cord (lamina I)
* Substantia gelatinosa of Rolando (lamina II)
* Nucleus proprius (laminae III, IV)
* Spinal lamina V, the neck of the posterior horn 
* Spinal lamina VI, the base of the posterior horn.

The other four laminae are located in the other two grey columns in the spinal cord.

The function of the spinal dorsal horn is to process and integrate sensory information from the peripheral nervous system. It receives inputs from primary afferent fibers and modulatory systems, and it projects to higher brain centers and motor neurons. The dorsal horn circuitry is involved in various aspects of sensory processing, including discrimination, integration, and modulation of nociceptive and non-nociceptive signals. Dysfunction of the dorsal horn circuitry has been implicated in chronic pain conditions and other neurological disorders.

Laminae I and II receive information from afferent neurons that sense nociception, temperature, and itching, laminae III and IV are sent information from neurons that sense mechanical pressure, and laminae V and VI are sent information from proprioceptors. It is known to be the primary relay point for haptic and nociceptive messages. The posterior horn is also known as a partially layered structure because only laminae I and II are well defined.

The column can also be separated by nociceptive and non-nociceptive senses. Laminae I and II are important in nociception, laminae III and IV are not involved nociception, and lamina V is involved in both nociception and non-nociception.

====Lamina I====
Lamina I is also known as the marginal nucleus of spinal cord. The majority of posterior column projection neurons are located in lamina I, however most neurons in this layer are interneurons. The main areas these neurons innervate are the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM), the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), the lateral parabrachial area (LPb), the periaqueductal grey matter (PAG), and certain regions in the thalamus. The CVLM receives nociceptive and cardiovascular responses. The NTS receives cardio-respiratory inputs and affects reflex tachycardia from noxious stimulation. The LPb projects to the amygdala and hypothalamus and is involved in the emotional response to pain. The PAG develops ways to deal with pain and is a main target of analgesics. It projects to other parts of the brainstem. The nuclei of the thalamus affect sensory and motivational aspects of pain. The neurons of this lamina can be distinguished by their morphology as pyramidal, spindle, or multipolar.

====Lamina II====
This layer is also known as the substantia gelatinosa of Rolando and has the highest density of neurons. These neurons mediate the activity of nociceptive and temperature afferent fibers. It is almost entirely made up of interneurons which can be further divided by their morphology. The four main morphological classes, based on the shape of their dendritic structure, are islet, central, vertical, and radial cells. The interneurons can also be divided by their function: excitatory or inhibitory. The excitatory interneurons release glutamate as their main neurotransmitter and the inhibitory interneurons use GABA and/or glycine as their main neurotransmitter. The neurons of this layer are only C fibers and contain almost no myelin.

====Laminae III and IV====
These laminae are also known as the nucleus proprius and contain a much smaller density of neurons than lamina II. There are projection neurons scattered throughout these layers. Mechanosensitive A beta fibers terminate in these layers. The layers receive input from lamina II and also control pain, temperature, and crude touch. C fibers that control nociception and temperature and sensory information from mechanoreceptors are relayed here.

====Lamina V====
This lamina is also known as the neck of the posterior column and receives information from mechanoreceptors and danger information from nociceptors. It has different neurons in different regions. In the medial region it contains medium-sized triangular neurons and the lateral region contains medium-sized multipolar neurons.

====Lamina VI====
This lamina is only found in the cervical and lumbar regions of the spinal cord. It receives afferent input from muscle fibers and joints.

===Lateral grey column===
The lateral grey column, or the lateral horn of spinal cord, is part of the sympathetic nervous system and receives input from brain stem, organs, and hypothalamus. The lateral column is only present in the thoracic region and upper lumbar segments. The lateral grey column contains preganglionic cell bodies of the autonomic nervous system and sensory relay neurons.

==Clinical significance==
Neurons in the anterior column have been shown to be affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The number of large alpha motor neurons and medium gamma motor neurons was greatly reduced and the number of small neurons was either slightly or greatly reduced depending on the type of ALS.

Muscular atrophy has also been shown to have an effect on neurons of the anterior column. A large loss of large alpha motor neurons, medium gamma motor neurons, and small neurons was recorded in cases of muscular atrophy.

Damage to the lateral column can result in Horner&#x27;s syndrome.

Multiple system atrophy (MSA), has also been linked to the lateral grey column. MSA has been shown to reduce the cell count in the lateral column by over 50%.

The posterior column has a prominent role in the pain system, it is the first central relay in the nociceptive pathway. The first-order afferent neuron carries sensory information to the second order neuron in the dorsal horn. The axon of the second order neuron, if it is a projection neuron and not an interneuron, then goes to the third order neuron in the thalamus. The thalamus is known as the &quot;gateway to the cortex&quot;. The third order neuron then goes to the cerebral cortex. The afferent neurons are either A fibers or C fibers. A fibers are myelinated allowing for faster signal conduction. Among these there are A beta fibers which are faster and carry information about non-painful touch and A delta fibers which are slower and thinner than the A beta fibers. The C fibers are not myelinated and therefore slower. C fibers that carry nociceptive signals can be divided into two types: fibers that contain neuropeptides, like substance P, and fibers that do not contain neuropeptides. The two types terminate in very different areas. Non-peptidergic C fibers are linked to the skin, where they innervate the epidermis while peptidergic C fibers innervate other tissues and deeper parts of the skin.

There are two main types of nociceptive signals: sensory and affective.

===Sensory===

Sensory nociceptive signals provide information about what kind of stimulus (heat, mechanical, etc.) is affecting the body and also indicates where on the body the stimulus is. Sensory nociceptive neurons have a small receptive field to help pinpoint the exact location of a stimulus.

===Affective===

Affective nociceptive signals affect emotions. These signals go to the limbic system and tell the body to react to the danger stimulus (i.e. removing a hand from a hot stove). These neurons have larger receptive fields because the emotional reaction to most pain stimuli is similar.

<text>David Nolan is an American author, civil rights activist, and historian.

==Biography==
Nolan was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1946, the son of journalist Joseph T. Nolan and his artist wife Virginia.

He attended public schools in Bayside, New York and Waterbury, Connecticut, studied at the University of Virginia, and was active in the American Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.

Since 1977 he has made his home in St. Augustine, Florida, known as the &quot;nation&#x27;s oldest city.&quot; From 1978 to 1980 he worked on the first official survey of old buildings in the Ancient City.

His first book, &quot;Fifty Feet in Paradise: The Booming of Florida&quot;, dealing with the booms and busts in the state&#x27;s colorful real estate history, was published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in 1984, and he received the annual author&#x27;s award from the Council for Florida Libraries.

He was a contributor to a literary tour guide of the state called &quot;The Book Lover&#x27;s Guide to Florida&quot; that was published by Pineapple Press in 1992.

In 1995 he collaborated with artist Jean Ellen Fitzpatrick and photographer Ken Barrett to produce &quot;The Houses of St. Augustine&quot;, which has become the bestselling book about the Ancient City and its historic buildings.

He was a founder in 2002 of ACCORD (an acronym for &quot;Anniversary to Commemorate the Civil Rights Demonstrations&quot;), a group designed to honor the participants in the St. Augustine movement during the Civil Rights Movement. Demonstrations in St. Augustine in 1963 and 1964 led by Dr.Robert Hayling and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. resulted in the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, one of the two great legislative accomplishments of the movement. ACCORD has launched a permanently marked Freedom Trail of historic sites of the civil rights movement that has gained international publicity. On July 2, 2014—the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964—ACCORD opened the first civil rights museum in Florida, at 79 Bridge Street in St. Augustine, the former dental office of Dr. Robert Hayling.
During Black History Month in 2009, Nolan received the Governor&#x27;s Points of Light Award for outstanding community service.
On July 2, 2009, the 45th anniversary of the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, he received the President&#x27;s Volunteer Service Award from Barack Obama.

He has served as president of the Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings Society and trustee of the Fort Mose Historical Society.

He is a lecturer on historic, architectural, and literary subjects.

<doc id="568612" wikidata="Q14942984" url="?curid=568612" title="Metal Slug (1996 video game)">
<text>is a 1996 run and gun arcade video game originally developed by Nazca Corporation and released by SNK for the Neo Geo MVS. It is the first installment in the eponymous series. Set in 2028, players assume the role of Peregrine Falcon Strike Force soldiers Marco Rossi and Tarma Roving on a fight against the Rebel Army led by Donald Morden and overthrow his coup d&#x27;état to prevent a New World Order.

&quot;Metal Slug&quot; was conceived by the same staff who created several titles at Irem that shared similar presentation such as &quot;In the Hunt&quot; and &quot;GunForce II&quot;, with the core concept during development being a simple but exciting side-scrolling shooter featuring a very easy control scheme and visuals inspired by the works of Hayao Miyazaki. Gameplay was originally more slow-paced, revolving around players controlling the titular tank instead of soldiers across shorter and less complex missions with a darker atmosphere, before the project was heavily overhauled after poor response during location test and the length was extended at the request of SNK to make the game attractive to home players while incorporating more platform elements into its design.

&quot;Metal Slug&quot; garnered positive reception upon its initial launch from players and critics, being lauded for its sense of humor, fluid hand-drawn animation and fast-paced two-player action. The game was subsequently ported to other platforms by other third-party developers, featuring various changes and additions compared to the MVS original, in addition to being included on compilations and re-released through download services for other systems, among other ways to play it. Its success led to a franchise spawning multiple sequels, remakes and spin-offs. A direct continuation, &quot;Metal Slug 2&quot;, was released in 1998.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Metal Slug&quot; is a run and gun game reminiscent of &quot;Contra&quot; where players assume the role of captain Marco Rossi and lieutenant Tarma Roving of the Peregrine Falcon Strike Force, shooting constantly at a continual stream of enemies in order to complete each mission. At this point, players confront a boss, who is usually considerably larger and tougher than regular enemies. On the way through each level, players can find numerous weapon upgrades and the eponymous tanks. Known as the SV-001 and SV-002, the tanks increase the player&#x27;s offense and add considerably to their defense.

In addition to shooting, players can perform melee attacks by using a knife. The player does not die by coming into contact with enemies, and correspondingly, many of the enemy troops have melee attacks. Much of the game&#x27;s scenery is destructible, and occasionally, this reveals extra items or power-ups. During the course of a level, the player encounters prisoners of war (POWs), who, if freed, offer the player bonuses in the form of random items or weapons. At the end of each level, the player receives a scoring bonus based on the number of freed POWs. If the player dies before the end of the level, the tally of freed POWs reverts to zero. Getting hit by enemy fire, colliding against solid stage obstacles or falling off-stage will result in losing a life and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing.

There are a total of six missions taking place across locations such as forests, garrisoned cities, snowy mountain valleys, canyons, and military bases. The vast majority of enemies are soldiers equipped with weaponry befitting their specific role. There are several mechanized enemies, such as tanks, mobile artillery, aircraft, armored personnel carriers and technicals. Much of the game&#x27;s humor comes from how the enemies are depicted; the player often encounters them as they are sunbathing, roasting food over a fire, or conversing. They tend to scream loudly if they see the player, and often try to either run away or fight back.

== Development ==

&quot;Metal Slug&quot; was developed by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Irem like &quot;In the Hunt&quot; and &quot;GunForce II&quot; before departing from the company and forming Nazca Corporation. Kawai and Takashi Nishiyama served as chief development manager and producer respectively. Kazuma &quot;Kire-Nag&quot; Kujo and Meeher acted as co-designers. Shinichi &quot;Hamachan&quot; Hamada, Kenji &quot;Andy&quot; Andō, Atsushi Kurooka (currently of PlatinumGames), T. Yokota, H. Yamada and &quot;Pierre&quot; Takada worked as programmers. Artists Akio Oyabu, Susumu, Kazuhiro &quot;Max.D&quot; Tanaka, Tomohiro, Takeshi Okui (currently of Monolith Soft) and Kozo were responsible for the pixel art. Composer Takushi &quot;Hiya!&quot; Hiyamuta scored the soundtrack. The team recounted the project&#x27;s development process and history through various publications.

&quot;Metal Slug&quot; was first playable during a location test at Osaka and later showcased to attendees at the 1995 Amusement Machine Show from September 13 to 15. The plot was similar to the final version but revolved around Regular Army members Phil Gene and Michiko Nakajima controlling the SV-001 and SV-002 prototype tanks instead.

== Release ==

&quot;Metal Slug&quot; was first released by SNK for the Neo Geo MVS arcade system on April 19, 1996 and later for the Neo Geo AES on May 24. The North American AES release has since become one of the more expensive titles on the platform, with copies of the port fetching over US$20,000 on the secondary video game collecting market. On July 5 the same year a Neo Geo CD version of the game was also released, featuring a &quot;Combat School&quot; mode that allowed players to revisit previously-played missions with new objectives.

Between April and August 1997, Sega Saturn and PlayStation versions were developed by SNK and Ukiyotei respectively were released only in Japan. Though software market was being dominated by polygon-based games, Neo Geo conversions for Saturn and PlayStation were selling well in Japan, motivating SNK to produce ports of &quot;Metal Slug&quot; as well. To retain all animations frames of the arcade original, the Saturn version used newer compression techniques, inter-level loading and the 1 MB RAM expansion cartridge. The Saturn release was available in two revisions; 1.002 and 1.005, which included some minor bug fixes. Both ports feature &quot;Combat School&quot; mode from the Neo Geo CD release while the PlayStation version features a new mode, &quot;Another Story&quot;, consisting of plot-based minigames, and an art gallery featuring concept art.

A Game Boy Advance port was announced to be in development but was never released to the public. In 2006, &quot;Metal Slug&quot; was included alongside its arcade sequels as part of &quot;Metal Slug Anthology&quot; for the Wii, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, PC in 2009 (as &quot;Metal Slug Collection PC&quot;) as well as PlayStation 4 in 2020 by Limited Run Games, being an emulated iteration of the arcade original without additional game modes or content featured in previous home releases. In 2008, the game was included as part of &quot;SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1&quot; for Wii, PlayStation 2 and PSP, as well as being re-released by D4 Enterprise on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console. In 2010, a version by M2 for the NEOGEO Station service was published by SNK Playmore on PlayStation Network. In 2012, a wireless version was released by DotEmu for iOS and Android.

&quot;Metal Slug&quot; is available as one of the 20 pre-loaded games with the Neo Geo X and was also included in the Neo Geo 25th Anniversary Humble Bundle, released in 2015. Hamster Corporation re-released &quot;Metal Slug&quot; for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch between December 2016 and March 2017 under their &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; series. The game was also recently included in the international version of the Neo Geo mini, the Neo Geo Arcade Stick Pro plug and play game device and the Neo Geo MVSX table top.

== Reception and legacy ==
&quot;Metal Slug&quot; garnered positive response upon its initial release. Japanese magazine &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed the game on their June 1, 1996 issue as being the seventh most-popular arcade game for the previous two weeks. In the United States, it was one of the top ten highest-grossing arcade games of 1996. The Neo Geo, iOS and Nintendo Switch versions hold a 84.50%, 68.33% and 80% respectively on the review aggregator &quot;GameRankings&quot;. It was included in the 2010 book &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot;. According to &quot;Famitsu&quot;, the &quot;SNK Best Collection&quot; re-release of &quot;Metal Slug&quot; on PlayStation sold over 8.064 copies in its first week on the market. The PC port sold 156,631 digital copies worldwide on Steam.

&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; heavily criticized the game&#x27;s unfair difficulty and one-hit deaths, remarking that playing through the arcade version requires an inordinate amount of quarters, while the Neo Geo AES version&#x27;s lack of an option for limited continues means players of all skill levels can complete it in a single sitting, with no motivation to play again or improve one&#x27;s skill at the game. However, the four reviewers also concurred that the game is fun, chiefly due to its smooth and humorous animations. &quot;GamePro&quot;″s Major Mike agreed that the Neo Geo version suffers from low longevity, with too few levels and a complete lack of replay value, and also criticized the slowdown in the game, but Mike approved of the graphics, music, and arsenal of weapons, and summarized the game as &quot;a soldier-slamming, side-scrolling, tour de force that dwarfs recent side-scrolling Neo shoot-em-ups, including the system&#x27;s strongest platform offerings like &quot;Cyber-Lip&quot; and &quot;Top Hunter&quot;.&quot; &quot;AllGame&quot;″s Brett Alan Weiss and Kyle Knight praised its unique hand-drawn visual style, refined gameplay, simple controls, intense action, humor and replay value but criticized the game&#x27;s slowdown when many objects are present on-screen, the overall length and found the music to be average. In conclusion, Knight regarded the title as one of the best side-scrolling shooters on Neo Geo. &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot;″s nuktos praised the colorful graphics, humor, gameplay and sound design but criticized its short length.

The Sega Saturn port was well received for being a faithful arcade conversion but critics noted that the game would not work without the 1MB RAM expansion cartridge. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;″ Steve Rey praised the weapon selection, attention to detail, humor and two-player mode. A reviewer from &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the Saturn port, stating that &quot;in the end, &quot;Metal Slug&quot; is not a game players will really obsess over. However, the easy and exciting gameplay &quot;will&quot; have players returning to it often, which is probably why SNK decided to bring it to the States&quot;. Readers of the Japanese &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; voted to give the Saturn iteration an 8.6305 out of 10 score, ranking at the number 185 spot. A reviewer of &quot;NowGamer&quot; criticized the PlayStation conversion for its lack of replay value aside from Combat School mode, however he praised the gameplay for being fun in short-term.

When &quot;Metal Slug&quot; was re-released on the Virtual Console in 2008, &quot;IGN&quot;″s Lucas M. Thomas scored it 8.5 out of 10, and awarding it an &quot;Editor&#x27;s Choice&quot; badge. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Dan Whitehead wasn&#x27;t quite as impressed. Despite praising the original game, Whitehead was critical of the port, criticizing the lack of support for online multiplayer, in comparison to the Xbox Live release. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot;″s Marcel van Duyn praised the sprite work, visuals and fast-paced music. &quot;Slide To Play&quot;″s Andrew Podolsky commended the iOS release for being an enjoyable and fast-paced arcade shooter in addition to its visual presentation, but recommended &quot;Metal Slug 3&quot; instead, as he noted that the title was more simple, shorter and lack the gameplay features compared with later entries in the &quot;Metal Slug&quot; franchise. &quot;148Apps&quot;″s Carter Dotson heavily criticized the iOS version for its control scheme but praised its graphics and sound, as well as the gameplay and replay value. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot;″s Damien McFerran praised its graphics and humor, although McFerran noted that its overall simplicity compared to later titles in the &quot;Metal Slug&quot; series may be seen as a shortcoming.

&quot;Metal Slug&quot; spawned a series of six sequels, a remake and four spin-offs. Marco Rossi appears as a playable character in the tag-team fighting game &quot;NeoGeo Battle Coliseum&quot;. Several developers have also created games similar to &quot;Metal Slug&quot; such as &quot;Demon Front&quot;, &quot;CT Special Forces&quot;, &quot;Alien Hominid&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Max: Better Dead Than Undead,&quot; and &quot;Mercenary Kings&quot;.

<text>Richard Ryder (5 July 1766 – 18 September 1832) was a British Tory politician. He notably served as Home Secretary between 1809 and 1812.

==Background==
Ryder was a younger son of Nathaniel Ryder, 1st Baron Harrowby and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of the Right Reverend Richard Terrick, Bishop of London. Dudley Ryder, 1st Earl of Harrowby, was his elder brother and the Right Reverend the Hon. Henry Ryder, Bishop of Coventry and of Lichfield, his younger brother. He was educated at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

==Political career==
Ryder sat as Member of Parliament for Tiverton from 1795 to 1830 and was sworn of the Privy Council in 1807. From 1809 to 1812 he served as Home Secretary under Spencer Perceval.

==Family==
Ryder married in 1799 Frederica, daughter of Sir John Skynner, from whom Ryder inherited the Great House in Great Milton, Oxfordshire in 1805. There were no surviving children from this marriage. Frederica died in August 1821. Ryder survived her by eleven years and died in September 1832, aged 66.

<doc id="568619" wikidata="Q2623205" url="?curid=568619" title="Delta wave">
<text>Delta waves are high amplitude neural oscillations with a frequency between 0.5 and 4 hertz. Delta waves, like other brain waves, can be recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) and are usually associated with the deep stage 3 of NREM sleep, also known as slow-wave sleep (SWS), and aid in characterizing the depth of sleep. Suppression of delta waves leads to inability of body rejuvenation, brain revitalization and poor sleep.

==Background and history==

&quot;Delta waves&quot; were first described in the 1930s by W. Grey Walter, who improved upon Hans Berger&#x27;s electroencephalograph machine (EEG) to detect alpha and delta waves. Delta waves can be quantified using quantitative electroencephalography.

==Classification and features==

Delta waves, like all brain waves, can be detected by electroencephalography (EEG). Delta waves were originally defined as having a frequency between 1 and 4 Hz, although more recent classifications put the boundaries at between 0.5 and 2 Hz. They are the slowest and highest amplitude classically described brainwaves, although recent studies have described slower (&lt;0.1 Hz) oscillations Delta waves begin to appear in stage 3 sleep, but by stage 4 nearly all spectral activity is dominated by delta waves. Stage 3 sleep is defined as having less than 50% delta wave activity, while stage 4 sleep has more than 50% delta wave activity. These stages have recently been combined and are now collectively referred to as stage N3 slow-wave sleep. During N3 SWS, delta waves account for 20% or more of the EEG record during this stage. Delta waves occur in all mammals, and potentially all animals as well.

Delta waves are often associated with another EEG phenomenon, the K-complex. K-Complexes have been shown to immediately precede delta waves in slow wave sleep.

Delta waves have also been classified according to the location of the activity into frontal (FIRDA), temporal (TIRDA), and occipital (OIRDA) intermittent delta activity.

==Neurophysiology==

===Sex differences===

Females have been shown to have more delta wave activity, and this is true across most mammal species. This discrepancy does not become apparent until early adulthood (in the 30s or 40s in humans), with males showing greater age-related reductions in delta wave activity than females.

===Brain localization and biochemistry===

Delta waves can arise either in the thalamus or in the cortex. When associated with the thalamus, they are thought to arise in coordination with the reticular formation. In the cortex, the suprachiasmatic nuclei have been shown to regulate delta waves, as lesions to this area have been shown to cause disruptions in delta wave activity. In addition, delta waves show a lateralization, with right hemisphere dominance during sleep.
Delta waves have been shown to be mediated in part by T-type calcium channels. During delta wave sleep, neurons are globally inhibited by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

Delta activity stimulates the release of several hormones, including growth hormone releasing hormone GHRH and prolactin (PRL). GHRH is released from the hypothalamus, which in turn stimulates release of growth hormone (GH) from the pituitary. The secretion of (PRL), which is closely related to (GH), is also regulated by the pituitary. The release of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), is decreased in response to delta-wave signaling.

==Development==

Infants have been shown to spend a great deal of time in slow-wave sleep, and thus have more delta wave activity. In fact, delta-waves are the predominant waveforms of infants. Analysis of the waking EEG of a newborn infant indicates that delta wave activity is predominant in that age, and still appears in a waking EEG of five-year-olds. Delta wave activity during slow-wave sleep declines during adolescence, with a drop of around 25% reported between the ages of 11 and 14 years. Delta waves have been shown to decrease across the lifespan, with most of the decline seen in the mid-forties. By the age of about 75, stage four sleep and delta waves may be entirely absent.
In addition to a decrease in the incidence of delta waves during slow-wave sleep in the elderly, the incidence of temporal delta wave activity is commonly seen in older adults, and incidences also increase with age.

==Disruptions and disorders==

Regional delta wave activity not associated with NREM sleep was first described by W. Grey Walter, who studied cerebral hemisphere tumors. Disruptions in delta wave activity and slow wave sleep are seen in a wide array of disorders. In some cases there may be increases or decreases in delta wave activity, while others may manifest as disruptions in delta wave activity, such as alpha waves presenting in the EEG spectrum. Delta wave disruptions may present as a result of physiological damage, changes in nutrient metabolism, chemical alteration, or may also be idiopathic.
Disruptions in delta activity is seen in adults during states of intoxication or delirium and in those diagnosed with various neurological disorders such as dementia or schizophrenia.

===Temporal low-voltage irregular delta wave===

Temporal low-voltage irregular delta wave activity has been commonly detected in patients with ischemic brain diseases, particularly in association with small ischemic lesions and is seen to be indicative of early-stage cerebrovascular damage.

===Parasomnias===

Parasomnias, a category of sleep disorders, are often associated with disruptions in slow wave sleep. Sleep walking and sleep talking most often occur during periods of high delta wave activity. Sleep walkers have also been shown to have more hypersynchronous delta activity (HSD) compared to total time spent in stages 2, 3, and 4 sleep relative to healthy controls. HSD refers to the presence of continuous, high-voltage (&gt; 150 μV) delta waves seen in sleep EEGs. Parasomnias which occur deep in NREM sleep also include sleep terrors and confusional arousals.

===Sleep deprivation===

Total sleep deprivation has been shown to increase delta wave activity during sleep recovery, and has also been shown to increase hypersynchronous delta activity.

===Parkinson&#x27;s disease===

Sleep disturbances, as well as dementia, are common features of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and patients with this disease show disrupted brain wave activity. The drug Rotigotine, developed for the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, has been shown to increase delta power and slow-wave sleep.

===Schizophrenia===

People with schizophrenia have shown disrupted EEG patterns, and there is a close association of reduced delta waves during deep sleep and negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia. During slow wave sleep (stages 3 and 4), people with schizophrenia have been shown to have reduced delta wave activity, although delta waves have also been shown to be increased during waking hours in more severe forms of schizophrenia.
A recent study has shown that the right frontal and central delta wave dominance, seen in healthy individuals, is absent in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, the negative correlation between delta wave activity and age is also not observed in those with schizophrenia.

===Diabetes and insulin resistance===

Disruptions in slow wave (delta) sleep have been shown to increase risk for development of Type II diabetes, potentially due to disruptions in the growth hormone secreted by the pituitary. In addition, hypoglycemia occurring during sleep may also disrupt delta-wave activity. Low-voltage irregular delta waves, have also been found in the left temporal lobe of diabetic patients, at a rate of 56% (compared to 14% in healthy controls).

===Fibromyalgia===

Patients with fibromyalgia often report unrefreshing sleep. A study conducted in 1975 by Moldovsky &quot;et al.&quot; showed that the delta wave activity of these patients in stages 3 and 4 sleep were often interrupted by alpha waves. They later showed that depriving the body of delta wave sleep activity also induced musculoskeletal pain and fatigue.

===Alcoholism===

Alcoholism has been shown to produce sleep with less slow wave sleep and less delta power, while increasing stage 1 and REM incidence in both men and women. In long-term alcohol abuse, the influences of alcohol on sleep architecture and reductions in delta activity have been shown to persist even after long periods of abstinence.

===Temporal lobe epilepsy===

Slow waves, including delta waves, are associated with seizure-like activity within the brain.
W. Grey Walter was the first person to use delta waves from an EEG to locate brain tumors and lesions causing temporal lobe epilepsy. Neurofeedback has been suggested as a treatment for temporal lobe epilepsy, and theoretically acts to reduce inappropriate delta wave intrusion, although there has been limited clinical research in this area.

===Other disorders===

Other disorders frequently associated with disrupted delta-wave activity include:
* Narcolepsy
* Depression
* Anxiety
* Obsessive–compulsive disorder
* Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and its three subtypes.
* Juvenile chronic arthritis
*Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (PoTS)
*Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome

==Consciousness and dreaming==

Initially, dreaming was thought to only occur in rapid eye movement sleep, though it is now known that dreaming may also occur during slow-wave sleep. Delta waves and delta wave activity are marked, in most people, by an apparently unconscious state, and the loss of physical awareness as well as the &quot;iteration of information&quot;.

Delta wave activity has also been purported to aid in declarative and explicit memory formation.

==Pharmacology==

While most drugs that affect sleep do so by stimulating sleep onset, or disrupting REM sleep, a number of chemicals and drugs have been shown to alter delta wave activity.
* Delta sleep-inducing peptide, as the name suggests, induces delta wave EEG activity.
* Alcohol reduces SWS delta wave activity, thereby restricting the release of growth hormone (GH) by the pituitary.
* The muramyl peptide, muramyl dipeptide (MDP, N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine) has been shown to increase delta wave activity during slow wave sleep.
* The drug Gabapentin, a drug used to control epileptic seizures, increases delta-wave activity and slow wave sleep in adults.
* While hypnotics like zolpidem increase slow wave sleep, they do not increase delta wave activity, and instead increase spindle activity during slow wave sleep.
* Gamma-hydroxy butyrate (GHB) increases delta slow-wave sleep as well as sleep-related growth hormone (GH).
* Administration of high-dose nitrous oxide is associated with transient, large amplitude slow-delta oscillations.

==Effects of diet==

Diets very low in carbohydrates, such as a ketogenic diet, have been shown to increase the amount of delta activity and slow wave sleep in healthy individuals.

<text>Marcel Chaput (October 14, 1918 – January 19, 1991) was a scientist and a militant for the independence of Quebec from Canada. Along with some 20 other people including André D&#x27;Allemagne and Jacques Bellemare, he was a founding member of the Rassemblement pour l&#x27;indépendance nationale (RIN).

== Biography ==

=== Family and education ===
Marcel Chaput was born in Hull, Quebec on October 14, 1918. His mother was Lucia Nantel, and his father, Narcisse Chaput, was a proofreader at Her Majesty&#x27;s Printer in Ottawa. He was the youngest child and sole boy in a family of seven children. He did not know three of his sisters, who died at a young age. The three sisters he knew were Rolande, Gabrielle and Madeleine. He was ten years old when his sister Rolande, 16, died of sepsis.

After doing his primary schooling at École Lecomte, he entered the Collège Notre-Dame de Hull. He was enrolled in the cadet corps of his college. One of his teachers, Brother Ernest, led him to an interest in science. From that time he cherished the dream of being a chemist. In 1934, he joined the Groupe Reboul of the Association catholique de la jeunesse canadienne-française.

In September 1933, he left his college in Hull and registered at the &quot;High School&quot; of the University of Ottawa, an institution which he left only two years later to enter, in September 1935, the École technique de Hull which trained chemistry laboratory technicians at the time. He stayed there until graduation in 1939.

Chaput claims to have become a partisan of the independence of Quebec as part of the Groupe Reboul while preparing for a public debate on the subject of &quot;separatism&quot;. He and his team member Jacques Boulay had to argue &quot;for&quot; separatism in a debating contest against two comrades, Roland Dompierre and Réal Denis. His team lost the debate held on December 10, 1937, but the readings he did to learn about the subject (&quot;Séparatisme, doctrine constructive&quot; by Dostaler O&#x27;Leary, old issues of the paper &quot;La Nation&quot; by Paul Bouchard, history books on the Patriots of the 19th century) convinced him of the merit of the idea in itself. He considered that he and the other pioneers of the contemporary movement for the independence of Quebec did nothing but update an idea that goes back to the British conquest of French Canada in 1760.

=== Technician ===
He had been working at the Eddy paper manufacture since May 1939 when the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada granted him a job interview in the month of December of the same year. He was hired as chemistry laboratory aid to doctor Richard Helmuth Fred Manske for a salary of $70 CAD per month. Meanwhile, he was enrolled in the Canadian Army due to conscription. In May 1941, he was mobilized at the Saint-Jérôme military camp. His training as a doughboy was interrupted when the federal government decided to employ all technicians in the war effort. He therefore returned to the NRC labs. He entered the service of the Canadian Army&#x27;s &quot;Chemical Warfare Laboratories&quot; in January 1943. When he returned home to Hull at the end of the war, he was a sergeant major.

=== Marriage ===
On September 15, 1945, he married Madeleine Dompierre, daughter of Odias Dompierre and Marie-Méa Marquis, at the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce Catholic Church in Hull. The couple spent six days cruising on the Saint Lawrence River and Saguenay River. Their first son, Luc, was born in the fall of 1946. Later came Danielle (1949), Sylvie (1952) and Jérôme (1955).

=== Doctorate ===
In September 1946, he moved to &quot;Peterson Residence&quot;, a disaffected aviation camp acquired by McGill University in Lachine. The living conditions in the student&#x27;s residence for married veterans were poor. After suffering from pleurisy, the doctor ordered his wife to leave the overheated rooms where the Chaput family was living and take some rest. Madeleine packed her things and returned to Marcel&#x27;s parents in Hull, while he rented a room in Montreal in the neighbourhood of McGill. During his study years, he left Montreal for Hull every weekend to see his wife and children. He received his Ph.D. in biochemistry from McGill University on October 6, 1952. His doctoral thesis was on calcium and the alpha cells of the pancreas.

=== Return to NRC ===
After receiving his Ph.D., he returned to Hull and began working for the NRC in Ottawa again. He initially resumed the same work he had been doing during the war, then transferred to the department of chemical research in Shirley Bay. In 1955, he transferred to the Defence Research Board, where he performed operational research.

In October 1958, he signed a secret study entitled &quot;The Proportion of French-Canadian Soldiers in the Canadian Army&quot;. This study would have helped General Jean-Victor Allard to convince the federal government to create francophone units in the Canadian Army. He signed another study on the same subject in October 1960 

From 1953 to 1959, in parallel to his lab work, he completed the studies of a masters in psychology at the Institute of Psychology of the University of Ottawa.

=== Foundation of the RIN ===

After reading &quot;Où va le Canada français? L&#x27;exercice de la pleine souveraineté est essentiel à l&#x27;épanouissement du Québec&quot; by Raymond Barbeau, interviewed by Jean-Marc Léger in &quot;Le Devoir&quot;, Chaput was determined to enter into contact with Barbeau, founder of the Alliance laurentienne. Chaput invited Barbeau to hold a conference in Hull on August 28, 1959, in an old parish room of the Notre-Dame Church. Some twenty people were present. Chaput met André D&#x27;Allemagne at this time. Barbeau invited Chaput to give a short speech in the Saint-Stanislas room of Montréal on September 13, 1959 as part of a soirée organized to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham.

During that period, although his patriotic and charitable activities were numerous, his militant activity for independence was limited to writing letters in newspapers on the topic of the hour. He wanted to do much more. He wrote a memoir to the attention of the &quot;chancellerie&quot; of the Ordre de Jacques Cartier (OJC), a secret organization of which he was a member. In response to Chaput&#x27;s initiative, Pierre Vigeant, editorialist at &quot;Le Devoir&quot; and &quot;grand chancelier&quot; of the OJC, created a study committee on the question of independence of Quebec. Chaput was part of a group of five commissioners who gathered in Montreal in December 1959 and January 1960. As secretary to the commission, Chaput wrote the final report which concluded that French Canadians enjoy the right to self-determination and that members of the OJC should feel free to support independence if such was their political conviction. The direction of the OJC however remained closed to the idea of independence. On March 17, 1961, he was expelled from the secret organization after having insisted on learning the position of the Order on constitutional and political matters.

On May 7, 1960, Chaput presided a meeting that received Raymond Barbeau as speaker at the Le Grenier theatre in Hull. Following the meeting, there were discussions on the possibility to form a Club Laurentie in Hull, but after reflecting on the matter for a while the small group of independence supporters in Hull decided to remain autonomous.

On September 10, 1960, he took part with 20 other people to the foundation of the Rassemblement pour l&#x27;indépendance nationale (RIN) which took place at the Auberge Le Châtelet in Morin Heights in the Laurentides. He was elected vice president of the RIN.

After having participated in the organizing of a parade for independence in the streets of Montreal which took place on February 11, 1961, he gave a conference entitled &quot;Le Canada français à l&#x27;heure de la décision&quot; as part of a public meeting held at the Gesù on April 4, 1961, during a Stanley Cup semi-final. The RIN rejoiced at being able to fill up a room under such circumstances. Pierre Bourgault also gave a speech that night.

On May 23, 1961, he again spoke as part of a public meeting organized by the RIN, this time at the Ermitage in Montreal. His conference was entitled &quot;Quand deux nationalismes s&#x27;affrontent&quot;.

=== Suspension ===
Chaput&#x27;s increasingly active involvement in public affairs did not fail to grab the attention of his employer, the federal government in Ottawa. In the House of Commons of the Parliament of Canada, Douglas Fisher, NDP Member of Parliament for Port Arthur in Ontario, asked Minister of National Defense Douglas Harkness about a certain doctor Chaput. Harkness was forced to admit that the Marcel Chaput, public speaker promoting the independence of Quebec was the same Marcel Chaput employed by his department. The Parliament of Canada took interest in his case again after some French-speaking MPs received invitations to attend a public meeting of the RIN announced for May 30, 1961 at the École normale de Hull. The day of the event, Chaput was called in the office of doctor Keyston, vice-president of the Defence Research Board, and was threatened with firing if he gave his talk. Knowing that Keyston did not have the powers to fire him, he decided the give his talk as planned.

He took three weeks of vacation during the summer and dedicated his free time to the writing of a book. On September 18, 1961, he launched the political essay &quot;Pourquoi je suis séparatiste&quot; at the Cercle universitaire de Montréal. His book was published by Jacques Hébert of Éditions du Jour. It was translated into English as &quot;Why I Am a Separatist&quot; some months later.

The general student association of Université Laval invited him to participate to the Canadian Affairs Conference, an event conducted under the honorary patronage of the Governor General of Canada. Several political figures gave speeches during the conference, among them Jean Lesage, Davie Fulton and René Lévesque. The talk Chaput was scheduled to give was on Friday November 17, a working day. He asked for a day off without pay, but Keyston, still his superior, refused. He was suspended from his research functions for two weeks – without pay – after he decided to attend the Canadian Affairs Conference anyway. On Monday December 4, 1961, day of his return to work after his suspension, he resigned.

=== President of the RIN ===
On October 28, 1961, shortly before he resigned his job, he was elected President General of the RIN during the organization&#x27;s annual congress in Montreal. Under his presidency, the RIN gave itself an emblem, founded the journal &quot;L&#x27;indépendance&quot; and created a political committee which prepared the programme adopted by members during the annual congress of October 1962.

On January 7, 1962, he quit Hull and settled in Montreal to maintain basic operations for the RIN. He continued to give talks here and there, usually with Pierre Bourgault. Although it never missed a chance to attack Premier Jean Lesage and all federalists in Quebec City or in Ottawa, the RIN adopted resolutions as part of a special congress on June 9 and 10 – to support the government of Quebec in its project to nationalize electricity companies. When during fall Jean Lesage announced there would be general elections on November 14, Chaput thought the time right to present himself as candidate for the RIN in the electoral district of Bourget. On September 30, the RIN took the unanimous decision to support his candidacy, but as an independent candidate, not as candidate of the RIN. The majority of RIN members did not think the time had come to turn their organization into a political party.

On Saturday October 20, during a congress held in the gymnasium of the Collège Mont-Saint-Louis, Guy Pouliot succeeded Chaput in the presidency of the RIN. Chaput remained an executive, but refused one of the two vice-presidencies he was offered.

On November 14, 3,299 voters of Bourget supported Marcel Chaput, who improvised an electoral campaign with $2,500 CAD and dozens of volunteers. He was not elected Member of Parliament, but judged the experience instructive and useful to the independence movement.

He proposed to the RIN the creation of a position of political organizer, but the council rejected his proposal, still of opinion that the time had not yet come to be active in the political arena. He decided to quit the RIN on December 17, 1962 in order to dedicate all his energies to the foundation of a pro-independence political party.

=== Foundation of the PRQ ===

On February 23, 1963, he called a press conference to announce the opening of the office of the Parti républicain du Québec (PRQ). The PRQ gave itself a constitution, a political programme and a journal, &quot;Le Républicain&quot;. Chaput announced that the first congress of the PRQ would be held on March 16 and 17 at Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal.

On March 3, 1963, the RIN resolved to become a political party.

On May 7, Raymond Barbeau announced in a press conference that he decided to dissolve the Alliance laurentienne to unite the strength of its members to that of the PRQ. In June, the PRQ permanent office moved from the 2nd floor of the old baseball stadium on rue de Lorimier to 4270, rue Papineau.

=== Hunger strikes ===
The PRQ rapidly accumulated a debt of $50,000 following the purchase of advertising time on television in April, May and June. To finance the party, Chaput took the decision to go on a hunger strike. He announced it publicly on July 8, 1963.

His first hunger strike lasted 33 days, from Monday July 8 to Saturday August 10, 1963. The PRQ&#x27;s chest filled up with $100,000 CAD. He started a second fast on November 18, 1963. He interrupted it after 63 days, on January 21, 1964, at the insistence of his entourage and sympathizing journalists. The PRQ however only gained $20,000 with his second fast and consequently he resigned his position as party leader. During the period of his two fasts he often made the headlines and continued to be invited to give talks on the subject of independence for Quebec.

=== Seeking employment ===
After the dissolution of the PRQ on January 21, 1964, Chaput dedicated his time to searching for employment to support his family. Since his resignation as a civil servant in December 1961, he had been living on his own savings and an insufficient public service pension to meet the needs of his wife and children. The task of finding a new job turned out to be difficult and he held various non permanent jobs. His label of &quot;separatist&quot; closed many doors to him. Two insurance companies and one mutual fund company, though interested in him because of his notoriety, refused to hire him in the end because, he was told, the direction feared losing the Anglophone clientele. At the end of the March 1964, his friend Jacques Lamarche suggested he apply for a teaching position with the Fédération des collèges classiques. He never received an answer from the federation. Lamarche therefore invited him to join him at the journal &quot;Le Laissez Passer&quot; published by the Conseil d&#x27;expansion économique (CEE), at the time presided by Sarto Marchand and directed by Bernard Tessier. After much negotiation, the direction of the CEE accepted that Chaput collaborates in the journal, but under a pseudonym. Under the name Gilles Côté, he participated to the publication of two economic dossiers during the summer of 1964, the first on general insurance, the second on life insurance. The direction of the CEE eventually came under a new leadership who learned that Chaput was being employed by the organization. He was fired and never paid for the work he had already performed.

A sympathizer of the RIN, José Leroux, principal of the private Collège Valéry, offered him a position as teacher of biology and history. He taught part-time between September 1964 and spring 1965. He continued to search for a more stable employment the whole year but without success.

On February 5, 1965, in a moment of discouragement, he addressed a public letter to the media to lament the fate Quebec society reserved to those who advocated independence. His letter had some effect. Interesting offers were made to him from outside Quebec, but he did not wish to live in exile. The only serious offer than was made to him from Quebec was that made by Doctor Elliot, one of his teachers at McGill University, who had since then become dean of the Department of Biochemistry, who offered him the direction of a research chair. He refused the job on principles, asserting he did not wish to work in English in Quebec, and also for pragmatic reasons, because he wished for a flexible schedule that would allow him to continue his militancy for independence in his spare time.

In 1966, his wife entered the job market while he started studying naturopathy. It is only in 1968 that he found a permanent job through an association with Eugène Caraghiaur, with whom he founded Pétro-Montréal, a company delivering heating oil. He was shareholder, director and seller for this company until he his retirement in 1983.

During the year 1965, he launched &quot;J&#x27;ai choisi de me battre: petite histoire très personnelle du séparatisme québécois, de Maurice Duplessis à Claude Wagner&quot;, a book of 160 pages, published by Club du livre du Québec in Montreal.

=== Return to RIN ===
He returned to the RIN in August 1965, at the invitation of Pierre Bourgault, who was president of the party at the time. The RIN presented him as candidate in the electoral district of Papineau for the Quebec general election of 1966. He came in third behind Roland Théorêt of Union nationale and Bernard Desrosiers of the Parti libéral du Québec, with 2,504 votes (10.32%).

He continued as a simple militant of the party until its dissolution in October 1968.

=== Parti Québécois ===

In October 1968, two weeks after the founding congress of the Parti Québécois (PQ), the members of the RIN gathered and voted the dissolution of their party. Most RIN militants became members of the PQ. Marcel Chaput was one of those who made that choice.

He held a weekly editorial column in &quot;Le Journal de Montréal&quot; from 1968 to 1970.

On December 11, 1969, he took part in the &quot;manif anti-manif&quot; organized by poet Gaston Miron to denounce the municipal regulation forbidding public demonstrations in the streets of Montreal. With several others, he was arrested by the police of Montreal and imprisoned. Regulation 3926, contested in court, was declared unconstitutional by the Quebec Superior Court, before being finally declared constitutional, several years later, by the Supreme Court of Canada.

In the spring of 1970, he presented himself as candidate for nomination by the PQ in the electoral district of Maisonneuve. It was however Robert Burns who won the nomination and was subsequently elected MNA on April 29.

He held a political column entitled &quot;La comédie canadienne&quot; in the weekly &quot;Point de mire&quot; during the year 1971.

He presented himself as candidate for nomination by the PQ in the electoral district of Terrebonne in 1973, but Guy Mercier was elected. Mercier did not however win a plurality of votes at the election of October 29.

In 1975, he and his wife Madeleine received the first Patriot of the Year award given by the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society of Montréal.

He was chief editor of&quot;Ici Québec&quot; magazine in 1977.

=== Naturopathy ===
From 1968 to 1970, after receiving a Ph.D. in naturopathy from the Institut de naturopathie du Québec, he was a consultant at the Clinique naturiste de Montréal. During that period, he published the book &quot;L&#x27;école de la santé&quot; and in collaboration with chemist Tony Le Sauteur, &quot;Dossier pollution&quot;. He was editor of &quot;La Santé&quot;, a paper doing popular education on health matters.

=== Death ===
He suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease at the end of his life. He died at Hôpital Jean-Talon in Montreal on January 19, 1991. His funeral took place at Église Notre-Dame-du-Rosaire in the Villeray neighbourhood. André D&#x27;Allemagne pronounced a funeral oration to his memory on the day of his funeral. He was buried at the Notre-Dame de Hull cemetery on January 25, 1991.

<doc id="568631" wikidata="Q6028924" url="?curid=568631" title="Daydreaming">
<text>Daydreaming is a stream of consciousness that detaches from current external tasks when one&#x27;s attention becomes focused on a more personal and internal direction.

Various names of this phenomenon exist, including mind-wandering, fantasies, and spontaneous thoughts. There are many types of daydreams – however, the most common characteristic to all forms of daydreaming meets the criteria for mild dissociation. In addition, the impacts of the various types of daydreams are not identical. While some are disruptive and deleterious, others may be beneficial to some degree.

The term &quot;daydreaming&quot; is derived from clinical psychologist Jerome L. Singer, whose research created the foundation for nearly all subsequent modern research. The terminologies assigned by modern researchers brings about challenges centering on identifying the common features of daydreaming and building collective work among researchers.

== Characteristics and types of daydreaming ==
Daydreaming consists of self-generated thoughts comprising three distinct categories: thoughts concerning the future and oneself, reflections on the past and others, and the emotional tone of experiences.

Psychologist Jerome L. Singer established three different types of daydreaming and their characteristics, varying in their cognitive states and emotional experiences. These included positive constructive daydreaming, characterized by constructive engagement, planning, pleasant thoughts, vivid imagery, and curiosity; guilty-dysphoric daydreaming, marked by obsessive, guilt-ridden, and anguished fantasies; and poor attentional control, reflecting difficulty focusing on either internal thoughts or external tasks.

Different daydreaming styles have various effects on certain behaviours, such as creativity.

== Functions of daydreaming ==

=== Future thinking ===
Daydreaming can be a useful tool to help keep people mindful of their relevant goals, such as imagining future success of a goal to motivate accomplishing a difficult or uninteresting task. 

=== Creative thinking ===
This function of daydreaming is associated with increased creativity in individuals. The frequency of daydreaming is the highest during simple tasks. It is hypothesized that daydreaming plays an important role in generating creative problem-solving processes. Studies have found that intentional daydreaming is more effective when focused on creative thought processing, rather than spontaneous or disruptive daydreams.

=== Attentional cycling ===
Attentional cycling is an adaptive function of daydreaming through which a person’s attention may cycle through multiple target problems at the same time, helping the individual remain positive. When people have a variety of goals, daydreaming can provide an opportunity for people to alternate across different streams of information and thoughts in a healthy way.

=== Dishabituation ===
A change in the daydreaming state can lead to dishabituation, a function that can be beneficial during a learning process as it renews attention and interest in stimuli that have become repetitive. One research identified this effect in learning and showed that learning is more effective with distributed practices over time rather than massed practices all at once. Daydreaming can provide a break to allow thoughts to drift away from intensive learning; upon the return, continuing to focus on attention-demanding tasks will be easier.

=== Relief from boredom ===
When people are performing mundane tasks, daydreaming allows their thoughts to detach from current external tasks to relieve boredom. At the same time, this temporary detachment will not stop external activities completely when they are necessary. As a result, daydreaming can cause the perception that time moves more quickly.

=== Visualizing social scenarios ===
Daydreaming can also be used to imagine social situations. Social daydreaming is imagining past social occurrences and future events and conversations. According to research, daydreaming and social cognition have strong overlapping similarities when activated portions of the brain are observed. These findings indicate that daydreaming is an extension of the brain&#x27;s experience of social cognition. This is likely because daydreams are often focused on the mental representations of social events, experiences, and people. 

The correlation between social daydreaming and positive social relationships suggests that daydreaming about close others can enhance social well-being, reduce loneliness, and increase relationship satisfaction. Recent studies indicate that social daydreaming serves immediate socio-emotional regulation purposes, particularly in fostering feelings of love and connection, suggesting its adaptive role in achieving goals.

=== Default mode network ===
&quot;Main article: Default mode network&quot;

According to several studies, daydreaming appears to be the brain&#x27;s default setting when no other external task is occupying its attention. A group of regions in the brain called the default mode network is lit up only when the brain is left in a sort of ‘idle’ state. These areas of the brain light up in sequence only when daydreaming. 

== Functional theories ==
There has yet to be a consensus on how the process of mind wandering occurs. Three theories have been devised to explain the occurrences and reasons behind why people daydream. These theories are the distractibility account, executive-function account, and the decoupling account.

The distractibility account theorizes that distracting stimuli, whether internal or external, reflect a failure to disregard or control distractions in the mind. According to this theory, the brain activity increases in response to an increase in attention to mind-wandering and the mind tends to dwell on task unrelated thoughts (TUT&#x27;s).

The executive-function account theorizes that the mind fails to correctly process task relevant events. This theory is based on the observation of TUT causes an increase in errors regarding task focused thinking, especially tasks requiring executive control.

The decoupling account suggests that attention becomes removed, or decoupled, from perceptual information involving an external task, and couples to an internal process. In this process, TUT is enhanced as internal thoughts are disengaged from surrounding distractions as the participant ‘tunes out’ the surrounding environment.

==Psychological studies and research==

=== Nighttime dreams ===
 Freudian psychology interpreted daydreaming as an expression of the repressed instincts, similarly to those revealing themselves in nighttime dreams. In contrast to nighttime dreams, there seems to be a process of &quot;secondary revision&quot; in fantasies that makes them more lucid, like daydreaming. The state of daydreaming is a kind of liminal state between waking (with the ability to think rationally and logically) and sleeping.

=== Self-reflection ===
Daydreaming can also be used to reveal personal aspects about an individual. In an experiment directed by Robert Desoille, subjects were asked to imagine different objects over the course of different rounds. Those who imagined more details and sleek objects often saw themselves as more useful and held the belief that they were more capable of growth. Through the daydream, which involved many fantastical elements, characteristics such as a fear of men or a desire to subdue a selfish personality trait were often revealed.

Self-focused daydreaming can be positive (i.e. a self-reflection) or negative (i.e. a rumination). This will result in either increased happiness, anti-depressant thinking, rational planning, creativity, and positivism, or conversely, over-thinking negative experiences from the past, pessimistic views of the future, negative mood-episodes, guilt, fear, and poor attention controls.

=== Everyday use ===
Eric Klinger&#x27;s research in the 1980s showed that most daydreams are about ordinary, everyday events and help to remind us of mundane tasks. Klinger&#x27;s research also showed that over 75% of workers in &quot;boring jobs&quot;, such as lifeguards and truck drivers, use vivid daydreams to &quot;ease the boredom&quot; of their routine tasks.

==Drawbacks and benefits==
Some of the major costs of daydreaming summarized by the review are worse performances with reading, sustained attention, mood etc.

The negative consequences of daydreaming on reading performance have been studied the most thoroughly. Research shows that there is a negative correlation between daydreaming frequency and reading comprehension performance, specifically worsened item-specific comprehension and model-building ability.

Disruptive daydreams or spontaneous daydreaming is also characteristic of people with attention-deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD).

Negative mood is another association of daydreaming. Research finds people generally report lower happiness when they are daydreaming than when they are not. For those experiencing positive daydreaming, the same happiness rating is reported between current tasks and pleasant things they are more likely to daydream about. This finding remains true across all activities.

In the late 19th century, Toni Nelson argued that some daydreams with grandiose fantasies are self-gratifying attempts at &quot;wish fulfillment&quot;. In the 1950s, some educational psychologists warned parents not to let their children daydream, for fear that the children may be sucked into &quot;neurosis and even psychosis&quot;.

While the cost of daydreaming is more thoroughly discussed, the associated benefit is understudied. One potential reason is the payoff of daydreaming is usually private and hidden compared to the measurable cost from external goal-directed tasks. It is hard to know and record people&#x27;s private thoughts such as personal goals and dreams, so whether daydreaming supports these thoughts is difficult to discuss.

Select research has argued that the mind is not idle during daydreaming, though it is at rest when not attentively engaging in external tasks. Rather, during this process, people indulge themselves in and reflect on fantasies, memories, future goals and psychological selves while still being able to control enough attention to keep easy tasks going and monitor the external environment. Thus, the potential benefits are the skills of internal reflection developed in daydreaming to connect emotional implication of daily life experience with personal meaning building process.

Despite the detrimental impact of daydreaming on aptitude tests which most educational institutions put heavy emphasis on, scholars argue that it is important for children to get internal reflection skills from daydreaming. Research shows that children equipped with these skills have higher academic ability and are socially and emotionally better off.

== Related disorders ==
Besides believing that daydreaming is motivated by unconscious drives and desires, Sigmund Freud also acknowledges that daydreaming can become excessive or pathological in some cases. Such instances can manifest as hysteria, neurosis, and psychopathology. When daydreaming becomes too detached from reality or interferes with everyday functioning, it may be indicative of deeper psychological issues or neurotic conflicts. While Freud didn’t explicitly correlate daydreaming to mental illness, he suggests that certain types of daydreams reflect underlying psychological disturbances.  

Various studies have also focused on maladaptive daydreaming, which describes vivid and elaborate daydreams for prolonged periods of time. Individuals who are affected by maladaptive daydreaming often neglect their real-life relationships and obligations, leading to clinical distress and impaired functioning. According to research the most common comorbidities associated with maladaptive daydreaming include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizotypal personality disorder and schizoid personality disorder.

== Criticism and limitations ==
Research on daydreaming faces challenges due to the difficulty in observing and measuring it compared to other mental tasks. Instead of making broad conclusions about its benefits or drawbacks, researchers should focus on how the content and form of daydreams relate to specific adaptive outcomes. This involves using intensive longitudinal methods to track daydreams in real-world settings and linking them to measurable goals. Integration with social psychological theory can help understand how social daydreams impact social interactions and goal achievement. Combining neuroimaging studies with experience-sampling studies can offer insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of daydreaming on social navigation.

<doc id="568642" wikidata="Q4660143" url="?curid=568642" title="A Time for Judas">
<text>A Time for Judas is a historiographic metafiction novel by Canadian author Morley Callaghan, published by Macmillan of Canada in 1983.

The novel tells the story of a man in modern times who discovers tablets written by a scribe named Philo of Crete or Philo the Greek. In the story, these tablets are from the time of Jesus and are Philo&#x27;s telling of Jesus&#x27; last days and the aftermath, including his resurrection. This modern-day man writes a novel based on these tablets. The bulk of the real novel is the fictional novel, i.e. a retelling of sorts of Philo&#x27;s story.

The story is similar to that presented in the Gospel of Judas, a Gnostic gospel that surfaced around the time of the book&#x27;s publication.

==Plot introduction==
The title refers to the friendship between the scribe, Philo, and Judas Iscariot, the disciple who betrayed Jesus. The premise is that Judas was actually Jesus&#x27; most trusted disciple, and chose him for the important job of &quot;betraying&quot; him to the authorities. In other words, Judas was following Jesus&#x27; instructions. He tells his story to Philo, who writes it all down on papyrus, seals it up in a Greek jar, and hides it until it is discovered in the 20th century. The story goes that Judas hanged himself, not because he was ashamed of betraying Jesus, but because he had not kept the secret as Jesus had made him promise to do.

<text>The New York State College of Human Ecology at Cornell University (HumEc) is a statutory college and one of four New York State contract colleges located on the Cornell University campus in Ithaca, New York. The College of Human Ecology is compilation of study areas such as design, design thinking, consumer science, nutrition, health economics, human development and textiles, each through the perspective of human ecology.

The school was founded in 1925 as the New York State College of Home Economics, growing out of an academic department that had been started in 1907. The college was renamed to its present appelation in 1969.

The college is open to both New York State residents and to non-residents; residents pay reduced tuition rates. In 2007-2008, the HumEc total budget of $42 million included $33 million in tuition revenue and $9 million in state appropriations.

==Academics==
The College enrolls approximately 1,250 undergraduates and 458 graduate students, and has approximately 105 professors and lecturers, and 70 research associates. Human Ecology provides a liberal arts foundation supporting career-specific preparation in a small college environment. The admitted freshman profile is in the middle 50th percentile. In 2005, the Cornell Alumni Magazine reported males represented 25 percent of College of Human Ecology 2005–06 student body.

The five academic departments comprising the College are Design and Environmental Analysis, Fiber Science &amp; Apparel Design, Human Development, Policy Analysis and Management, and Nutritional Sciences, which offer the following undergraduate majors: Design and Environmental Analysis; Fiber Science and Apparel Design, with possible options in Apparel Design, Fashion Design Management, or Fiber Science; Global and Public Health Sciences; Human Biology; Health and Society; Human Development; Nutritional Sciences; Policy Analysis and Management; and Healthcare Policy. Please note that Policy Analysis and Management (now Public Policy) and Healthcare Policy are being moved from Human Ecology to the Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy. Thirty-five to forty percent of Human Ecology students continue in professional or graduate degree programs following the completion of undergraduate degree programs. The college also houses the Cornell Institute for Public Affairs (CIPA), which awards the Master of Public Administration degree and the Sloan Program Master of Health Administration.

==History==

The home economics movement emerged toward the end of the nineteenth century. Pioneers such as Ellen Swallow Richards and Mr. and Mrs. Melvil Dewey championed home economics as a field in higher education.

From 1903 to 1907 Martha Van Rensselaer (1864–1932), a pioneer in the field of home economics, and American nutritionist Flora Rose (1874-1959), and Anna Botsford Comstock taught early home economics courses at the New York State College of Agriculture. and later co-directed the fledgling department of Home Economics. In 1914, the United States Congress passed the Smith-Lever Act to establish a system of cooperative extension services provided by land-grant universities for the purpose of educating American farmers, youth, and other groups about developments in the fields of agriculture, home economics, 4-H and other related domains. Van Rensselaer and Rose advocated for the state charter of 1925 for the New York State College of Home Economics - the first unit of its kind in the United States.

In 1929, Eleanor Roosevelt lent political influence to assist the college to obtain public funds to construct a building, later completed in 1933.

In 1969, the College was renamed the New York State College of Human Ecology. The term human ecology refers to methods regarding the study of relationships between people and natural and constructed environments.

Requests for appropriations, budgets, estimates, and expenditures has remained under the management and control of the State University of New York, and the college is therefore subject to the financial supervision of the SUNY trustees. In this respect, the college is fundamentally a part of Cornell&#x27;s land-grant mandate of providing state funds for training in &quot;practical&quot; fields that assist the economy of the state.

==Facilities==

In 1933, the College was housed in Martha Van Rensselaer Hall (MVR), located at 116 Reservoir Avenue in Ithaca. The Georgian Revival style brick building was designed by architect William Haugaard of the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York.

In 1968, architect Ulrich Franzen designed an addition on the north side MVR Hall. The expansion provided studio and laboratory space for faculty and students. In 2003, Dean Patsy Brannon presided over the completion of a west wing addition to MVR Hall, providing space for the Division of Nutritional Sciences, including a human metabolic research unit as well as an interactive distance-learning classroom.

Meanwhile, MVR Hall&#x27;s north wing had been urgently evacuated in 2001 due to structural problems, and was demolished in 2005. In 2011, a new 89,000-square foot facility designed by Gruzen Samton and IBI Group was completed to provide a parking garage, a three-story building, and a commons adjacent to the existing building. In 2015, the Green Parking Council certified the parking structure a &quot;green garage.&quot;

<text>The Simplified Instructional Computer (abbreviated SIC) is a hypothetical computer system introduced in &quot;System Software: An Introduction to Systems Programming&quot;, by Leland Beck. Due to the fact that most modern microprocessors include subtle, complex functions for the purposes of efficiency, it can be difficult to learn systems programming using a real-world system. The Simplified Instructional Computer solves this by abstracting away these complex behaviors in favor of an architecture that is clear and accessible for those wanting to learn systems programming.

== SIC Architecture ==
The SIC machine has basic addressing, storing most memory addresses in hexadecimal integer format. Similar to most modern computing systems, the SIC architecture stores all data in binary and uses the two&#x27;s complement to represent negative values at the machine level. Memory storage in SIC consists of 8-bit bytes, and all memory addresses in SIC are byte addresses. Any three consecutive bytes form a 24-bit &#x27;word&#x27; value, addressed by the location of the lowest numbered byte in the word value. Numeric values are stored as word values, and character values use the 8-bit ASCII system. The SIC machine does not support floating-point hardware and has at most 32,768 bytes of memory. There is also a more complicated machine built on top of SIC called the Simplified Instruction Computer with Extra Equipment (SIC/XE). The XE expansion of SIC adds a 48-bit floating point data type, an additional memory addressing mode, and extra memory (1 megabyte instead of 32,768 bytes) to the original machine. All SIC assembly code is upwards compatible with SIC/XE.

SIC machines have several registers, each 24 bits long and having both a numeric and character representation:
:* A (0): Used for basic arithmetic operations; known as the accumulator register.
:* X (1): Stores and calculates addresses; known as the index register.
:* L (2): Used for jumping to specific memory addresses and storing return addresses; known as the linkage register.
:* PC (8): Contains the address of the next instruction to execute; known as the program counter register.
:* SW (9): Contains a variety of information, such as carry or overflow flags; known as the status word register.

In addition to the standard SIC registers, there are also four additional general-purpose registers specific to the SIC/XE machine:
:* B (3): Used for addressing; known as the base register.
:* S (4): No special use, general purpose register.
:* T (5): No special use, general purpose register.
:* F (6): Floating point accumulator register (This register is 48-bits instead of 24).

These five/nine registers allow the SIC or SIC/XE machine to perform most simple tasks in a customized assembly language. In the System Software book, this is used with a theoretical series of operation codes to aid in understanding the assemblers and linker-loaders required for the execution of assembly language code.

==Addressing Modes for SIC and SIC/XE==
The Simplified Instruction Computer has three instruction formats, and the Extra Equipment add-on includes a fourth. The instruction formats provide a model for memory and data management. Each format has a different representation in memory:
:*Format 1: Consists of 8 bits of allocated memory to store instructions.
:*Format 2: Consists of 16 bits of allocated memory to store 8 bits of instructions and two 4-bits segments to store operands.
:*Format 3: Consists of 6 bits to store an instruction, 6 bits of flag values, and 12 bits of displacement.
:*Format 4: Only valid on SIC/XE machines, consists of the same elements as format 3, but instead of a 12-bit displacement, stores a 20-bit address.

Both format 3 and format 4 have six-bit flag values in them, consisting of the following flag bits:
:*n: Indirect addressing flag
:*i: Immediate addressing flag
:*x: Indexed addressing flag
:*b: Base address-relative flag
:*p: Program counter-relative flag
:*e: Format 4 instruction flag

==Addressing Modes for SIC/XE==
* Rule 1:
*: e = 0 : format 3
*: e = 1 : format 4
** format 3:
**: b = 1, p = 0 (base relative)
**: b = 0, p = 1 (pc relative)
**: b = 0, p = 0 (direct addressing)
** format 4:
**: b = 0, p = 0 (direct addressing)
**: x = 1 (index)
**: i = 1, n = 0 (immediate)
**: i = 0, n = 1 (indirect)
**: i = 0, n = 0 (SIC)
**: i = 1, n = 1 (SIC/XE for SIC compatible)
* Rule 2:
*: i = 0, n =0 (SIC)
*: b, p, e is part of the address.

== SIC Assembly Syntax ==
SIC uses a special assembly language with its own operation codes that hold the hex values needed to assemble and execute programs. A sample program is provided below to get an idea of what a SIC program might look like. In the code below, there are three columns. The first column represents a forwarded symbol that will store its location in memory. The second column denotes either a SIC instruction (opcode) or a constant value (BYTE or WORD). The third column takes the symbol value obtained by going through the first column and uses it to run the operation specified in the second column. This process creates an object code, and all the object codes are put into an object file to be run by the SIC machine.

codice_1

If you were to assemble this program, you would get the object code depicted below. The beginning of each line consists of a record type and hex values for memory locations. For example, the top line is an &#x27;H&#x27; record, the first 6 hex digits signify its relative starting location, and the last 6 hex digits represent the program&#x27;s size. The lines throughout are similar, with each &#x27;T&#x27; record consisting of 6 hex digits to signify that line&#x27;s starting location, 2 hex digits to indicate the size (in bytes) of the line, and the object codes that were created during the assembly process.

codice_1

==Sample program==
Given below is a program illustrating data movement in SIC.

codice_3

== Emulating the SIC System ==
Since the SIC and SIC/XE machines are not real machines, the task of actually constructing a SIC emulator is often part of coursework in a systems programming class. The purpose of SIC is to teach introductory-level systems programmers or collegiate students how to write and assemble code below higher-level languages like C and C++. With that being said, there are some sources of SIC-emulating programs across the web, however infrequent they may be.

<text>Adam-12 is an American police procedural crime drama television series created by Robert A. Cinader and Jack Webb and produced by Mark VII Limited and Universal Television. The series follows Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers Pete Malloy and Jim Reed as they patrol Los Angeles in their police cruiser, assigned the call sign &quot;1-Adam-12&quot;. &quot;Adam-12&quot; stars Martin Milner and Kent McCord, with several recurring co-stars, the most frequent being William Boyett and Gary Crosby. The series ran over seven seasons from September 21, 1968, until May 20, 1975.

Like Webb&#x27;s other series, &quot;Dragnet&quot; and &quot;Emergency!&quot;, &quot;Adam-12&quot; was produced in cooperation with the actual department it was based on, in this case, the LAPD. &quot;Adam-12&quot; aimed to be realistic in its depiction of policing and helped familiarize the American public with police procedures and jargon. A syndicated revival by The Arthur Company aired from 1990 to 1991 for two seasons, featuring new characters and an updated setting.

==Premise==
Set in the Los Angeles Police Department&#x27;s Central Division, &quot;Adam-12&quot; follows police officers Pete Malloy (Martin Milner) and Jim Reed (Kent McCord) as they patrol Los Angeles. The plots of most episodes follow Malloy and Reed as they handle the various calls for service that they are assigned to or come across, ranging from intense incidents such as pursuits, standoffs, shootouts, hostage-takings, gang violence, terrorism, and undercover assignments, to the mundane (and far more common) routine happenings like traffic stops, disputes, disturbances, narcotics crimes, DUI arrests, fights, and thefts. 

At the start of the series, Malloy, seeking to resign after the death of his previous partner, is assigned to field train Reed, an inexperienced rookie. After Reed disobeys Malloy&#x27;s orders but singlehandedly arrests a group of armed suspects during a high-risk shooting call, Malloy sees potential in Reed and decides to remain on the force to guide him through his nine-month probationary period. The first and second seasons are not chronological, with Reed&#x27;s stated time in the LAPD varying in each episode. Starting with the third season, the series was organized chronologically, and Reed completed his probationary period, with him and Malloy remaining partners. Throughout the series, and especially in later seasons, Malloy and Reed began patrolling other divisions and working on different assignments (such as divisions assigned to patrol neighborhoods like Venice and Hollywood, airport detail, Metropolitan Division, Air Support Division, and even desk duty), occasionally explained as them filling in for other officers or being part of police experience programs. Malloy sometimes fills in for Sergeant William MacDonald as the watch commander in the show&#x27;s final season. At the same time, Reed finds himself partnered with probationary officers, mirroring Malloy&#x27;s original role as his field training officer. In the series finale, Reed receives the Medal of Valor for saving Malloy&#x27;s life and completes an examination to become a detective, while Malloy is set for a promotion to sergeant.

The personal lives of Malloy and Reed came up on occasion and were often tied into their duties, though they rarely extended past conversations, episode subplots, or brief scenes. Malloy is a bachelor who has at least five girlfriends (not simultaneously) over the course of the series. Reed is married to a woman named Jean (played by several actresses, including Mikki Jamison and Kristin Nelson); in the second season, they are shown to have a son, Jim Jr. (or Jimmy). Occasionally, Malloy and Reed are depicted socializing outside their work, but such scenes are rare. Although both characters are serious-minded and “by-the-book” officers, Malloy is more realistic when dealing with non-violent offenders while Reed is more rigid. 

=== Vehicles ===
The police cars used in the series were central to the show; Webb &quot;wanted the vehicle itself to be considered a character&quot;. As patrol officers, Malloy and Reed spent most of their time in their cruiser, and scenes set in or relating to their cruiser were central to the series. Most officers in the series drove recent-model sedans, while Sergeant MacDonald always used a station wagon version of Adam-12&#x27;s vehicle.

In the pilot episode, Adam-12 used a 1967 Plymouth Belvedere; for the rest of the first season, a 1968 Plymouth Belvedere was used instead, later updated to a 1969 Plymouth Belvedere for the second and third seasons. In the fourth season, Adam-12 used a 1971 Plymouth Satellite. Starting with the fifth season, and for the rest of the series, Adam-12 used a 1972 AMC Matador.

=== Title ===
&quot;1-Adam-12&quot; is an LAPD call sign that combines three elements: the unit&#x27;s patrol division, the type of patrol unit, and the daily assigned reporting district.

The &quot;1&quot; means the patrol car operates in Division 1 (Central Division), serving Downtown Los Angeles. The LAPD assigns two-officer patrol units the letter &quot;A&quot;; in the LAPD phonetic alphabet, the letter &quot;A&quot; is spoken as &quot;Adam&quot;. The &quot;12&quot; comes from the daily assigned reporting district, or beat. Adam-12&#x27;s &quot;shop number&quot;—a fleet vehicle identification number custom to the city government, located below the city seal on the front doors—was &quot;80817&quot; on the Belvedere, &quot;83012&quot; on the Satellite, and &quot;85012&quot; on the Matador.

Though the &quot;1-Adam-12&quot; radio call sign identified it as a Central Division unit, the police station Malloy and Reed worked from belonged to Rampart Division, which serves sections west of Downtown and uses &quot;2&quot; as its prefix number. There was also never a standard patrol unit with the call sign of &quot;1-Adam-12&quot;, as all LAPD reporting districts are odd-numbered.

== Cast ==
* Martin Milner as Officer Pete Malloy: A veteran police officer who initially plans to resign from the LAPD, but remains on the force to guide Reed through his probationary period. He is acquainted or familiar with many officers in Central Division, as well as some citizens in Adam-12&#x27;s usual patrol areas. By season 7, he is preparing for a promotion to Sergeant and spends time working as a watch commander. He is single but seeking, and the subplots of several episodes revolve around his dating life. His badge number is 744.
* Kent McCord as Officer Jim Reed: A rookie police officer assigned Malloy as his field training officer. After his probationary period, he remains Malloy&#x27;s partner. Malloy does not trust him to drive the cruiser, a recurring joke throughout the series. At the end of season 7, he applies to become a detective. He has a wife, Jean, and a son, Jimmy. His badge number is 2430.
* Shaaron Claridge as herself: A police dispatcher and desk clerk. Working alongside an unnamed male dispatcher, Claridge appears in voice only in almost every episode. She only physically appears briefly in season 5, episode 20. Claridge was an actual LAPD dispatcher who acted as a side job until her retirement in 1990.
* William Boyett as Sergeant William &quot;Mac&quot; MacDonald: The watch commander of Central Division. He is responsible for commanding and organizing the officers under him, including Malloy and Reed, who report to him and are sometimes assigned to cases by him. Mac is issued a station wagon and a Federal Riot Gun capable of firing tear gas rounds, which he and other officers are authorized to use in standoffs. In the field, his call sign is 1-Lincoln-20. He is mentioned to have a wife named Mary, a son named William &quot;Billy&quot;, a daughter named Elizabeth, and a brother named Bryan.
* Gary Crosby as Officer Ed Wells: A police officer and one of Malloy&#x27;s friends. In his first appearance in season 1, he is depicted as very hot-headed and reckless, though this behavior is toned down in later seasons, with him mostly serving as comic relief instead. Though he acts cocky and makes jokes at the expense of other officers, he is also fairly dimwitted, and several of his jokes and actions fall flat or backfire. Throughout the series, he is seen with numerous different assigned partners. He was proposed as a potential successor to Malloy for a planned eighth season that ultimately never materialized.
* William Elliott as Motor Officer Gus Grant: A motorcycle officer introduced in later seasons. He is laid-back but dedicated to his work and knows Malloy and Reed well. His use of a motorcycle is a factor in several incidents, with Adam-12 usually called in to support him with their cruiser. He is one of the only African American characters in the series to have a recurring role.
* Jack Hogan as Detective Sergeant Jerry Miller: A detective who handles investigations that Malloy and Reed assist with or are involved in, most prominently in the earlier seasons. Miller is often depicted in different detective divisions, such as homicide and internal affairs, similar to Joe Friday from &quot;Dragnet&quot;. Hogan also plays Lieutenant Fred Benson, an LAPD Air Support Division helicopter pilot.
* Art Gilmore as Lieutenant Moore: The commanding officer of Central Division. Dialogue in the pilot episode suggests he was Malloy&#x27;s field training officer when he was a rookie. His role is greatly minimized between seasons 2 and 7, where he makes very few appearances, with Mac mostly taking up his role as the &quot;boss&quot; of Central Division. By season 7, he had been promoted to captain.
* Michael Warren as Officer Larry Carter: A rookie police officer who, at the time of his first appearance, is only two days out of the police academy. In season 4, episode 15, Carter is assigned to Malloy while Reed goes undercover in a narcotics ring. He was proposed as a potential successor to Malloy for a planned eighth season.
* Mark Harmon as Officer Gus Corbin: A rookie police officer. In season 7, episode 21, Reed is assigned to field train Corbin while Malloy fills in as watch commander for Mac. Corbin is shown to be inexperienced as well as clumsy and frequently puts himself at risk. However, he is still capable of effectively handling situations himself when necessary. He was proposed as a potential successor to Malloy for a planned eighth season.
* Jo Ann Pflug as Officer Dana Hall: A female police officer who, unusually for the time, is assigned to patrol duty. In season 7 episode 22, Hall is assigned to Reed while Malloy fills in as watch commander. Though Hall is initially met with derision by the other officers (especially Wells) for her gender, Reed respects her and shows she is just as capable of frontline policing as male officers. She was proposed as a potential successor to Malloy for a planned eighth season.
* Steve Franken as Officer Albert Porter: A reserve police officer and one of Reed&#x27;s friends. Outside the LAPD, he works as an electrical engineer.
* Marco Lopez as Officer Sanchez: One of Wells&#x27;s assigned partners. Lopez also plays other recurring officers, mostly unnamed background characters.
* Fred Stromsoe as Officer Jerry Woods: A recurring police officer. He appears in the credits sequence of every episode, even those he does not appear in, for reasons unknown.
* Claude Johnson as Officer Brinkman: A recurring police officer. Johnson also plays other recurring officers, including Officer Norm Green and Officer Johnson.
* William Stevens as Officer Jerry Walters: A recurring police officer. Stevens also plays Officer Lou Walters, another recurring officer.
* Robert Patten as Detective Sergeant Stone: A recurring detective. Patten also plays other detectives and officers, including Detective Fremont, Detective Sergeant Benson, Detective Speer, Sergeant Baron, and Sergeant King.
* Chuck Bowman as Detective Cole Edwards: A recurring detective. Bowman also plays other characters, including Harold Thompson, Officer Rogers, Officer Miller, Lieutenant Andrews, and Sergeant McCall.
* Mikki Jamison and Kristin Nelson (actor varies between seasons) as Jean Reed: Jim Reed&#x27;s wife. She dislikes that Reed is a police officer due to the dangers of his work, and fears for his safety, though she is otherwise supportive of him. She has a son, Jimmy.
* Jed Allan as Reno West: A cat burglar active in the Los Angeles area. He was previously caught by Malloy, but was released four years later, after which he attempted to return to burglaries; however, he was caught again by Malloy and Reed. He plays a significant role throughout season 6.
* Aneta Corsaut as Judy: One of Malloy&#x27;s girlfriends, first appearing in season 7.

== Production ==
Universal Studios co-produced the show with Mark VII Limited. The series&#x27; first episode, &quot;Log 1: The Impossible Mission&quot;, was filmed in September 1967, a year before the pilot was picked up.

The production of &quot;Adam-12&quot; involved showing all aspects of correct police procedures. Many elements in the show changed to reflect new policies and regulations in the real LAPD; for instance, when the LAPD switched from the 6-inch Smith &amp; Wesson Model 14 to the 4-inch Smith &amp; Wesson Model 15 in 1970, the service revolvers in the show similarly changed starting in the fourth season. Police cruisers played a central role, as &quot;Webb wanted the vehicle itself to be considered a character&quot;. The show&#x27;s routine use of police radio communications and jargon helped reinforce &quot;the sound of radio as an anti-crime technology.&quot; The police vehicles used in the production of the show were purchased from local dealerships and outfitted by the prop department to accurate LAPD cruiser specifications.

The driving scenes were filmed on public streets using a dedicated camera platform mounted to the cruiser&#x27;s hood, which was towed by a station wagon. The platform held three cameras: the center camera would film both Milner and McCord in one shot, while the left and right cameras would film Milner and McCord, respectively, on a cross-angle. All three cameras were remote-controlled and would roll simultaneously. For the pilot, Webb did not like the reflections of the sky on the windshield (which made Milner and McCord difficult to see), so the windshield of the vehicle was removed; however, this made the actors&#x27; hair blow and caused issues with the audio recording equipment. The prop department&#x27;s solution was to reinstall the windshield and build an overhead shield that extended over the hood and windshield of the car to block the reflections. Sides were added to create a large &quot;black box&quot; over the front of the vehicle with both ends &quot;open&quot;, which allowed for more controlled filming circumstances. During filming, the script supervisor would lie on the floor in the back of the car to read script dialogue for the voices coming from the police radio, which Milner and McCord would respond to. The director and the sound man would sit in a rear-facing seat in the back of the station wagon towing the police car.

Most scenes in the older seasons were filmed at the Universal Studios Lot, mostly in Courthouse Square and Colonial Street. Starting with the third and fourth seasons, the series gradually shifted to filming in actual locations in Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. The garage used tow trucks from the LAPD&#x27;s North Hollywood Division that was located near Universal Studios.

The police station used in the series was the Rampart Police Station, located at 2710 West Temple Street. The station was built in 1966, two years before the series began, and could thus be considered &quot;state of the art&quot; for most of the series&#x27; run. Rampart Police Station was closed in 2008, and Rampart Division moved to the newer and larger Rampart Community Police Station. The old station was renovated to serve as the headquarters for the LAPD Metropolitan Division. The renovated building, now known as the LAPD Metropolitan Division Facility, opened in 2016.

In 1974, during the production of the seventh season, Martin Milner signed to play Karl Robinson on the short-lived television series &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot;, taking him off &quot;Adam-12&quot;. Several options were tested during this season, which would allow the series to continue should the production of a proposed eighth season move forward. Jo Ann Pflug, Mark Harmon, and Michael Warren were tested for their potential to replace Milner in episodes where McCord served as their training officer or partner. Another idea proposed that the series be continued with Officer Ed Wells, played by Gary Crosby, replacing Malloy, who would be written off with a promotion to Sergeant at another division. However, the birth of Kent McCord&#x27;s son three days before the seventh season&#x27;s finale aired took McCord off the show as well, forcing the series to end with the seventh season.

==Reception and cultural impact==
The police vehicles were central characters in that &quot;mobile patrol units [became] associated with the black and white units made famous in such television shows as &quot;Adam-12&quot;. It was one of the shows that portrayed &quot;the professionalism of the officers and police departments&quot;. Ronald Wayne Rodman pointed out that the theme of &quot;Adam-12&quot; referred to a &quot;military-style topic while portraying a sense of contemporary action&quot;. Douglas Rushkoff noted, &quot;&quot;Adam-12&quot; also marked [the] last gasp of the righteous style of cop TV.&quot; Their set was not a squad room or an office, but the actors &quot;watched the changes in American culture through the windshield of their squad car&quot;. &quot;12&quot;, a slang nickname for police, likely originated from &quot;Adam-12&quot;, in a manner comparable to the similar nickname &quot;five-O&quot;, which originated from &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;.

In 2003, the Los Angeles Police Department activated an actual unit with the 1-Adam-12 call sign, in service with the Central Division. The unit was not a standard patrol unit and was only assigned to officers who demonstrated &quot;outstanding duty performance&quot;. It is unknown if the unit is still active as of 2023.

=== References in other media ===
Milner and McCord made cameo appearances as their &quot;Adam-12&quot; characters in several episodes of the fifth season of &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, including one that parodied the series&#x27; in-cruiser dialogue scenes.

&quot;Nashville Beat&quot;, a 1989 television film about an LAPD detective teaming up with his former partner to stop a dangerous gang in Nashville, Tennessee, starred Milner and McCord. Though the pair being former partners in the LAPD is a nod to &quot;Adam-12&quot;, the characters have different names, and the show is not otherwise mentioned or referenced.

Milner and McCord would make two appearances in a revival of &quot;Adam-12&quot; that ran over two seasons from 1990 to 1991. In one episode, both actors made cameo appearances as store owners. In the season one episode &quot;Crack House&quot;, Milner guest-starred as Malloy, now a captain; in the following episode, &quot;R.T.D. 211&quot;, McCord guest-starred as Reed, now a lieutenant.

In 1999, Mattel produced a die-cast toy police car based on &quot;Adam-12&quot; as part of their &quot;Star Car&quot; series.

In a scene from &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, &quot;1-Adam-12&quot; can be heard over a police radio feed.

In the fourth OVA episode (&quot;Revenge Road&quot;) of the 1987 anime &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot;, the call sign of an AD Police helicopter is &quot;Adam-12&quot;.

==== Connections to other Mark VII shows ====
&quot;Adam-12&quot;, &quot;Dragnet&quot;, and &quot;Emergency!&quot; are set in the same universe and depict different aspects of the public safety infrastructure of Los Angeles. Each series has several crossover episodes with characters from other Mark VII shows.

Malloy and Reed appear in the &quot;Dragnet&quot; episode &quot;Internal Affairs: DR-20&quot;, as well as &quot;The D.A.&quot; episode &quot;The People vs. Saydo&quot; (the conclusion to a crossover that begins in &quot;The Radical&quot;). Sergeant MacDonald appears in the &quot;Dragnet&quot; episode &quot;Personnel: The Shooting&quot;.

The &quot;Adam-12&quot; episode &quot;Lost and Found&quot; was set at Rampart General Hospital and featured the &quot;Emergency!&quot; cast. Malloy and Reed appeared in the &quot;Emergency!&quot; pilot movie, &quot;The Wedsworth-Townsend Act&quot;. Despite the apparent relation between these shows, &quot;Adam-12&quot; is shown to be a television show in one &quot;Emergency!&quot; episode, contradicting the officers&#x27; physical appearances.

Several years after &quot;Adam-12&quot;&#x27;s finale, Kent McCord was to appear in a planned third series of &quot;Dragnet&quot;, playing Sgt. Friday&#x27;s partner, but the project was canceled due to Jack Webb&#x27;s sudden death in December 1982. Since none of the scripts Webb wrote for the project were ever produced or released, it is not clear if he intended for McCord to play Jim Reed or a different character, though in the final episode of &quot;Adam-12&quot; — the two-part &quot;Something Worth Dying For&quot; — Reed mentions applying to join the Detective Bureau.

== Revival ==

A revival of &quot;Adam-12&quot; by The Arthur Company, titled &quot;The New Adam-12&quot;, aired in first-run syndication in tandem with &quot;The New Dragnet&quot;, another revival of a Jack Webb series. Like &quot;The New Dragnet&quot;, &quot;The New Adam-12&quot; had different characters, music, and presentation compared to the original series, and starred Ethan Wayne as Officer Matt Doyle and Peter Parros as Officer Gus Grant (seemingly unrelated to the Motor Officer Gus Grant seen in the original show, played by William Elliott).

Fifty-two episodes were aired over two seasons. The first season aired from September 24, 1990, to March 18, 1991; the second season aired from March 25, 1991, to September 16, 1991.

<text>Non-heterosexual is a word for a sexual orientation or sexual identity that is not heterosexual. The term helps define the &quot;concept of what is the norm and how a particular group is different from that norm&quot;. &quot;Non-heterosexual&quot; is used in feminist and gender studies fields as well as general academic literature to help differentiate between sexual identities chosen, prescribed and simply assumed, with varying understanding of implications of those sexual identities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butch/femme: Inside&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The term is similar to &quot;queer&quot;, though less politically charged and more clinical; &quot;queer&quot; generally refers to being non-normative and non-heterosexual. Some view the term as being contentious and pejorative as it &quot;labels people against the perceived norm of heterosexuality,
thus reinforcing heteronormativity&quot;. Still, others say &quot;non-heterosexual&quot; is the only term useful to maintaining coherence in research and suggest it &quot;highlights a shortcoming in our language around sexual identity&quot;; for instance, its use can enable bisexual erasure.

==Background==
Many gay, lesbian and bisexual people were born into different cultures and religions that stigmatized, repressed or negatively judged any sexuality that differed from a heterosexual identity and orientation. Additionally the majority of heterosexuals still view non-heterosexual acts as taboo and non-conventional sexual desires are generally hidden entirely or masked in various ways. &quot;Non-heterosexual&quot; is more fully inclusive of people who not only identify as other than heterosexual but also as other than gay, lesbian and bisexual. Some common examples include &quot;same gender loving&quot;, &quot;men who have sex with men (MSM)&quot;, &quot;women who have sex with women&quot; (WSW), &quot;bi-curious&quot; and &quot;questioning&quot;. &quot;Non-heterosexual&quot; is considered a better general term than &quot;homosexual&quot;, &quot;lesbian and gay&quot;, &quot;LGBT&quot; or &quot;queer&quot; for being more neutral and without the baggage or gender discrimination that comes with many of the alternatives. For instance, until 1973, the American Psychological Association listed &quot;homosexual&quot; as a mental illness, and it still has negative connotations.

==Usage==
&quot;Non-heterosexual&quot; is found predominantly in research and scholarly environments possibly as a means to avoid terms deemed politically incorrect like &quot;lesbian&quot;, &quot;dyke&quot;, &quot;gay&quot;, &quot;bisexual&quot;, etc. that lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people use as self descriptors. When used by those who do not identify as LGB or when used by LGB people disparagingly, the terms are generally considered pejorative, so &quot;non-heterosexual&quot; is a default and innocuous term unlikely to offend readers. For example, the Kinsey scale can be divided between those exclusively heterosexual and everyone else. The term has come into more prominence in the academic field starting in the 1980s and more prominently in the 1990s with major studies of identities of non-heterosexual youth and a smaller number of studies specifically looking at non-heterosexual college students. &quot;Non-heterosexual&quot; is also used to encompass transgender and intersex people, because although these are gender identities rather than sexual identities, they are within the LGBT and queer umbrella communities. Additionally, &quot;non-heterosexual&quot; encompasses a wide variety of terms used by different cultures whose own terms might never neatly translate to a homosexual or bisexual identity; for researching and extrapolating data it is a practical and accepted term.

In a 2004 book that integrates &quot;the academic disciplines of cinema studies, sociology, cultural and critical studies&quot; regarding the Big Brother phenomena, &quot;non-heterosexual&quot; was used as a universal term to help compare information from over thirty countries. In exploring and studying the emerging field of gay, lesbian and bisexual seniors, &quot;non-heterosexual&quot; is a default term to demonstrate that the &quot;vast majority&quot; of literature assumes that older people are heterosexual and makes &quot;no effort&quot; to explore the experiences and attitudes of those who are not. In &quot;Welfare and the State&quot;, the authors describe the perceived advantages of lesbians in the workplace as they, in theory, would not have children so would be advantageous to the labor force. The authors point out, however, that not only do many lesbians have children but they routinely identify as heterosexual through much of their lives or at least until their children are old enough that a non-heterosexual identity would not greatly impact their families negatively.

&quot;Non-heterosexual&quot; is also used when studying lesbian and gay families and family structures. It came into wider use in this context when the AIDS pandemic&#x27;s impact on gay male communities was being explored as many gay men created families out of extended networks of friends and these became their support systems.

==Critique==

The use of the term &#x27;non-heterosexual&#x27; to refer to LGBTQ people as a blanket term could perpetuate heteronormativity.

Jonathan Ned Katz argues that historically, the term was used to force people into one of two distinct identities; the &quot;normalization of a sex that was &#x27;hetero&#x27; proclaimed a new heterosexual separatism — an erotic apartheid that forcefully segregated the sex normals from the sex perverts.&quot; He argues that it enforces the idea of &quot;compulsory heterosexuality&quot; and that anyone who does not fit into that category is going against the norm. He states that heterosexuality, as a categorization and as a term, was not created until the late nineteenth century, that prior to this relations between the sexes were not believed to be overtly sexual, and that in the Victorian era sex was seen as an act between &quot;manly men and womanly women, [as] procreators, not specifically as erotic beings or heterosexuals.&quot; He further argues that the division between the heterosexual and the non-heterosexual came in the 1860s after the &quot;growth of the consumer economy also fostered a new pleasure ethic,&quot; and the erotic became a commodity to be bought and sold; at the same time the &quot;rise in power and prestige of medical doctors allowed those upwardly mobile professionals to prescribe a healthy new sexuality.&quot; He states that men and women were now meant to enjoy sex; relations between those of the &#x27;opposite sexes&#x27; was seen as healthy and encouraged by medical professionals; and this creation and celebration of the &#x27;Normal Sexual&#x27; ultimately resulted in its counterpart: the &#x27;Sexual Pervert,&#x27; anyone who fell outside the heterosexual ideal. He states, &quot;In its earliest version, the twentieth-century heterosexual imperative usually continued to associate heterosexuality with a supposed human &#x27;need,&#x27; &#x27;drive,&#x27; or &#x27;instinct&#x27; for propagation, a procreant urge linked inexorably with carnal lust... giving praise to vent to heteroerotic emotions was thus praised as enhancing baby-making capacity, marital intimacy and family stability.&quot; The basic oppositeness of the sexes was seen as the basis for normal, healthy sexual attraction. Katz concludes that the term heterosexuality was created as a way to subjugate and other anyone who did not confirm to mainstream ideals of sexuality. It was a term that created a sense of validation that heterosexuality was the normal, healthy version of human sexuality.

Margaret Denike and Patrick Hopkins have argued that &quot;heterosexism and homophobia are founded on and sustained by binary gender categories, specifically the assumption that there are distinct and proper masculine and feminine gender roles and identities against which deviation is measured.&quot; According to Erika Feigenbaum, the use of the term non-heterosexual indicates a departure from what is acceptable in society while highlighting the juxtaposition between the ideal heterosexual and unideal non-heterosexual, stating, &quot;Heterosexism is about dominance, and the practices that support it are often replicated, reinforced, and reflected by the attitudes, behaviors, and practices of even [the] best-intentioned allies.&quot;

Although &quot;non-heterosexuality&quot; is considered a blanket term for all LGBTQ identities, it is often interpreted as another word for homosexual which contributes to the continuation of systematic bisexual erasure. Bisexuality has a long history of being overshadowed and ignored in favour of the belief in monosexuality, it &quot;[represents] a blind spot in sex research.&quot; The term non-heterosexual suggests a division between heterosexual and homosexual, the heterosexual-homosexual dichotomy, rather than the heterosexual-homosexual continuum, which accounts for identities that are not exclusively heterosexual or homosexual. By separating identities into either/or, bisexual identities are left in a place of ambiguity, &quot;bisexuals transgress boundaries of sexually identified communities and thus are always both inside and outside a diversity of conflicting communities.&quot; The implied homosexual-heterosexual dichotomy that the term puts in place negates its use as a truly inclusive term; &quot;[the] categories are constructed in such a way as to allow everyone access to one and only one, and to insist that anyone who is not already neatly situated in one category or the other had best be on the way to one.&quot; This focus on either/or logic, heterosexuality or non-heterosexuality, where non-heterosexuality is closely associated with homosexuality rather than general queerness, slights those that the term attempts to describe; &quot;where bisexuality does rate a mention, it is almost always rendered an epistemological and incidental by-product, aftereffect, or definitional outcome of the opposition of hetero/homosexuality.&quot;

Non-heterosexuality is often used to describe those in the LGBT+ community with non-cisgender identities. This is seen as problematic as sexual orientation and gender identity are different. However the distinction between the two is relatively modern. Historically &quot;[transgender people] were classified as homosexuals by everyone, including the physicians who specialized in their treatment, and it is only in the past fifty years or so that transgender has been theorized as different in kind from homosexuality.&quot; Many people still fail to understand or make the distinction between gender minorities and sexual minorities.

Queer people &quot;are often expected to account for [their] sexual identifications by either proving [their] normality (that is, [they] are inside the sphere of heteronormativity), or by accepting that [their] difference from the heterosexual norm constitutes some form of essence.&quot; The term non-heterosexual is used to highlight the absolute difference between heterosexual and queer identities. The language needs to change to describe LGBTQ people as autonomous beings &quot;rather than considering [them] solely as sexual beings constituted within a heterosexual logic of sameness or difference.&quot; The implied binary that the term non-heterosexual perpetuates erases those whose identities fall in the spectrum between heterosexuality and homosexuality. The hetero/homosexual dichotomy continues the systematic erasure of bisexual identities by emphasizing an assumed oppositeness with nothing allowed in between. It ignores those who identify as non-binary, as the term non-heterosexuality has been interpreted as categorizing those who are sexually attracted to people of the &#x27;same sex&#x27; as opposed to those who are attracted to those of the &#x27;opposite sex.&#x27;

<doc id="568652" wikidata="Q3496249" url="?curid=568652" title="Oral stage">
<text>In Freudian psychoanalysis, the term oral stage denotes the first psychosexual development stage wherein the mouth of the infant is their primary erogenous zone. Spanning the life period from birth to the age of 18 months, the oral stage is the first of the five Freudian psychosexual development stages: (i) the oral, (ii) the anal, (iii) the phallic, (iv) the latent, and (v) the genital.

==Oral-stage fixation==
Freud proposed that if the nursing child&#x27;s appetite were thwarted during any libidinal development stage, the anxiety would persist into adulthood as a neurosis (functional mental disorder). Therefore, an infantile oral fixation would be manifest as an obsession with oral stimulation. If weaned either too early or too late, the infant might fail to resolve the emotional conflicts of the oral stage of psychosexual development and might develop a maladaptive oral fixation.

The infant who is neglected (insufficiently fed) or who is over-protected (over-fed) in the course of being nursed, might become an orally-fixated person. This fixation might have two effects: (i) the neglected child might become a psychologically dependent adult continually seeking the oral stimulation denied in infancy, thereby becoming a manipulative person in fulfilling their needs, rather than maturing to independence; (ii) the over-protected child might resist maturation and return to dependence upon others in fulfilling their needs. Theoretically, oral-stage fixations are manifested as garrulousness (talkativeness), smoking, continual oral stimulus (eating, chewing objects), and alcoholism.

<text>The Adventures of Rin-Tin-Tin is an American children&#x27;s Western television series that aired 164 episodes from October 1954 to May 1959 on the ABC television network. 

The show starred Lee Aaker as Rusty, a boy orphaned in an Indian raid, who was being raised by the soldiers at a US Cavalry post known as Fort Apache. Rusty and his German Shepherd dog, Rin Tin Tin, help the soldiers to establish order in the American West. James E. Brown appeared as Lieutenant Ripley &quot;Rip&quot; Masters. Co-stars included Joe Sawyer as Sergeant Biff O&#x27;Hara and Rand Brooks as Corporal Randy Boone.

The character of Rin Tin Tin was named after Rin Tin Tin, a legendary screen dog of the 1920s and 1930s. The character was nominally played by Rin Tin Tin IV, who was either a descendant or related to the original dog. However, due to Rin Tin Tin IV&#x27;s poor screen performance, the character was mostly performed by unrelated dogs belonging to trainer Frank Barnes, primarily one named Flame Jr.

== Synopsis ==
Rusty and his dog, Rin Tin Tin (Rinty), are the only survivors of an Indian raid on their wagon train. The boy and his dog are adopted by the 101st Cavalry at Fort Apache, Arizona, where Rusty is commissioned as an honorary corporal. Throughout the series, Rusty and Rinty help the cavalry and the nearby people to establish order in the American West.

== Episodes ==

==Production==
=== Development ===
Producer Herbert Leonard got the idea for the show while shooting at the Corrigan Movie Ranch. He had taken his lunch at the Fort Apache set and got the idea for the entire format, but he needed to convince &quot;Rinty&quot; owner Lee Duncan to get the rights. Leonard convinced Douglas Heyes to work on the script and they presented it to Duncan. Duncan and Leonard made the agreement to do the show over a handshake and an initial payment of ten dollars.

=== Casting ===
Three different German Shepherds were used as the titular character. Rin Tin Tin IV and one other dog were descended from the original &quot;Rinty&quot; of movie fame. The other dog used was an unrelated dog named Flame, Jr. Due to Rin Tin Tin IV&#x27;s poor screen performance, the character was mostly performed by Flame, Jr.

=== Filming ===
The episodes were filmed on a low budget, with Screen Gems limiting it to less than $50,000 per episode. Outdoor action was shot largely at Corriganville Movie Ranch northwest of Los Angeles in Simi Valley, where the production made ample use of the facility&#x27;s set from the movie Fort Apache. Additional action sequences were shot on the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, known for its huge sandstone boulders and widely recognized as the most heavily filmed outdoor shooting location in the history of Hollywood.

The show&#x27;s troupe of twelve character actors was often required to play multiple parts in the same episode, sometimes to the point of one actor fighting himself, wearing a cavalry uniform in one shot and an Apache outfit in another.

== Themes ==
As a show targeting the youth audience, it not only displayed stories with action, but also included moral lessons. Actor James Brown explained, &quot;Our stories simply taught that right was right and wrong was wrong.&quot;

==Broadcast==
The show ran for five seasons on ABC on Friday evenings from October 1954 to May 1959. ABC reran the series on late afternoons from September 1959 to September 1961. During its first season (1954-1955), &quot;The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin&quot; finished at number 23 in the Nielsen ratings, making it the second-highest rated series on ABC at the time behind &quot;Disneyland&quot;, which placed number six.

Reruns ran on Saturdays on CBS from September 1962 until September 1964. A new package of reruns was shown in 1976, and continued into the mid-1980s. The original black-and-white prints were tinted sepia with new opening and closing segments filmed in color in Utah. Due to poor scheduling practices of local stations, the rebroadcasts were not successful.

Modern syndication includes remastered episodes produced by Cerulean Digital Color and Animation, with lines redubbed for some scenes using actors other than those from the original series cast, with a different generic theme song.

== Reception ==
Critics were generally positive, with &quot;TV Guide&quot; calling it &quot;crammed with action, gunplay and chase scenes,&quot; and that it &quot;makes fine viewing for kids and nostalgic viewing for grownups&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot;, however, was much more critical, calling Aaker &quot;precocious&quot; and &quot;not helped by the direction&quot;, and that &quot;the dog does nothing exceptional either&quot;.

<doc id="568662" wikidata="Q1126227" url="?curid=568662" title="Connecticut Western Reserve">
<text>The Connecticut Western Reserve was a portion of land claimed by the Colony of Connecticut and later by the state of Connecticut in what is now mostly the northeastern region of Ohio. The Reserve had been granted to the Colony under the terms of its charter by King Charles II.

Connecticut relinquished its claim to some of its western lands to the United States in 1786 following the American Revolutionary War and preceding the 1787 establishment of the Northwest Territory. Despite ceding sovereignty to the United States, Connecticut retained ownership of the eastern portion of its cession, south of Lake Erie. It sold much of this &quot;Western Reserve&quot; to a group of speculators who operated as the Connecticut Land Company; they sold it in portions for development by new settlers. The phrase Western Reserve is preserved in numerous institutional names in Ohio, such as Western Reserve Academy, Case Western Reserve University, and Western Reserve Hospital.

In the 19th century, the Western Reserve &quot;was probably the most intensely antislavery section of the country&quot;. John Brown Jr. called it, in 1859, &quot;the New England of the West&quot;.

==Location==
The Reserve encompassed all of the following Ohio counties: Ashtabula, Cuyahoga, Erie and Huron (see Firelands), Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage, Trumbull; and portions of Ashland, Mahoning, Ottawa, Summit, and Wayne.

==History==

Prior to the arrival of European colonists, the land surrounding the southern shore of Lake Erie was inhabited by the Erie people. At the close of a war against the Iroquois from 1654 to 1656, the Erie were almost completely annihilated. Their towns were destroyed, and any survivors were assimilated into neighboring tribes, mainly the Seneca.

After the American Revolutionary War, Connecticut was forced by the federal government to surrender the Pennsylvania portion (Westmoreland County) of its &quot;sea-to-sea grant&quot; following the Pennamite–Yankee Wars. Nevertheless, the state held fast to its claim on the lands between the 41st and 42nd-and-2-minutes parallels that lay west of the Pennsylvania state border.

The claim within Ohio was to a -wide strip between Lake Erie and a line just south of present-day Youngstown, Akron, New London, and Willard, about south of present-day U.S. Highway 224. The claim beyond Ohio included parts of Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, and California. The eastern boundary of the reserve follows a true meridian along Ellicott&#x27;s Line, the boundary with Pennsylvania. The western boundary veers more than four degrees from a meridian to maintain the 120-mile width, due to convergence.

Connecticut gave up western land claims following the American Revolutionary War in exchange for federal assumption of its debt, as did several other states. From these concessions, the Articles of Confederation government organized the Northwest Territory (formally known as the &quot;Territory Northwest of the River Ohio&quot;). The deed of cession was issued on September 13, 1786. As population increased in portions of the Northwest Territory, new states were organized and admitted to the Union in the early 19th century.

Connecticut retained in Ohio, which became known as the &quot;Western Reserve&quot;. The state sold the Western Reserve to the Connecticut Land Company in 1796 (possibly 12 August, 2 September, or 5 September 1795) for $1,200,000. The Land Company were a group of investors who were mostly from Suffield, Connecticut. The initial eight men in the group (or possibly seven or 35) planned to divide the land into homestead plots and sell it to settlers from the east.

But the Indian titles to the Reserve had not been extinguished. Clear title was obtained east of the Cuyahoga River by the Greenville Treaty in 1795 and west of the river in the Treaty of Fort Industry in 1805. The western end of the reserve included the Firelands or &quot;Sufferers&#x27; Lands&quot;, reserved by Connecticut in 1792 for residents of several New England towns which had been destroyed by British-set fires during the Revolutionary War.

The next year, the Land Company sent surveyors led by Moses Cleaveland to the Reserve to divide the land into square townships, on each side (. Cleaveland&#x27;s team also founded the city of Cleveland along Lake Erie, which became the largest city in the region. (The first &quot;a&quot; was dropped; spelling of names was not standardized at the time.)

In 1798 surveyors laid out the Girdled Road, indicated by girdled trees, which ran from Cleveland to the Pennsylvania state line near Lake Erie. A modern portion of Girdled Road still exists by that name.

The territory was originally named &quot;New Connecticut&quot; (later discarded in favor of &quot;Western Reserve&quot;), and settlers began to trickle in during the next few years. Youngstown was founded in 1796, Warren in 1798, Hudson and Ravenna in 1799, Ashtabula in 1803, and Stow in 1804.

=== Legal issues with title ===

A major issue faced by the Land Company was that their purchase of the land was of questionable legality. Connecticut claimed to have sold them not only the title to the Western Reserve, but also the right to govern its inhabitants. It was unclear whether a state could sell its jurisdiction to a private company. This legal gray area caused queasiness by investors, so in 1797, the Connecticut legislature signed a bill to transfer the land to the federal government. However, the shareholders and customers of the Land Company feared that this offer would cause them to lose their titles, and they instead requested that Connecticut intervene to have Congress recognize the jurisdiction of the Land Company. In February 1800, a federal committee headed by John Marshall found that the titles and jurisdiction of the Western Reserve remained formally in the hands of Connecticut, observing that this created an exclave with significant practical problems for governance. He proposed that the federal government simply obtain direct jurisdiction over the land. 

== Dissolution and legacy ==

The Western Reserve thereby became federal property in April 1800, and settlers were allowed to retain their titles. The United States absorbed it into the Northwest Territory, which organized Trumbull County within the boundaries of the Reserve. Warren, Ohio is the former county seat of the Reserve and identifies itself as &quot;the historical capital of the Western Reserve.&quot; Later, several more counties were carved out of the territory. The name &quot;Western Reserve&quot; survives in the area in various institutions such as the &quot;Western Reserve Historical Society&quot; and Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.

The Western Reserve was arguably the most anti-slavery region of the country in the pre-Civil War period. Many Underground Railroad routes ended with a trip through the Western Reserve to a boat to cross Lake Erie into what is today Ontario. The three oldest sons of the abolitionist John Brown—John Jr., Jason, and Owen—together with other participants in John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry, were all living in Ashtabula County, for security; the Governor of Ohio, William Dennison Jr., refused to honor Virginia&#x27;s request for Owen&#x27;s arrest and extradition. A U.S. Marshall, attempting to serve a warrant requiring Owen to testify before a U.S. Senate committee, reported that without &quot;an armed force&quot; he could not be arrested; &quot;in Ashtabula County...there is a secret and armed organization numbering several hundred.&quot; They proclaimed themselves safer there than in any other place in the U.S., or even in Canada.

This area of Ohio became a center of resource development and industrialization through the mid-20th century. It was a center of the steel industry, receiving iron ore shipped through the Great Lakes from Minnesota, processing it into steel products, and shipping these products to the east. This industry stimulated the development of great freight lakers, as the steam ships were known, including the first steel ships in the 20th century. Railroads took over some of the freight and commodity transportation from the lake ships. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, these cities attracted hundreds of thousands of European immigrants and migrants (both black and white) from the rural South to its industrial jobs.

===2011 Heritage Area study===
At the request of Congress in 2011, the National Park Service prepared a feasibility study for declaring the 14-county region of the Western Reserve as a National Heritage Area. This is a means to encourage broad-based preservation of such historical sites and buildings that are related to a large historical theme. Such assessment and designation has been significant for recognizing assets, and encouraging new development and businesses, including heritage tourism, often related to adaptive re-use of waterways, and buildings, as well as totally new endeavors. The United States has designated 49 National Heritage Areas, including two in Ohio: the Ohio Canal of the Ohio and Erie Canal and the National Aviation Heritage Area.

The NPS study coordinator said that while the region had the historic assets, and there was considerable public support for such a designation, the Western Reserve lacked &quot;a definitive coordinating entity or supporting group,&quot; which is required to gain Congressional approval. Specifically, while the Western Reserve Land Conservancy managed natural resources, the Western Reserve Historical Society worked towards a collective story of the region, and the Fund for our Economic Future collaborated on tourism opportunities, there was no single institution coordinating all aspects of a possible Heritage Area. If such a body develops in the future, it might seek federal designation as a Heritage Area.

==Architecture==
The settlers in northern Ohio repeated the style of structures and the development of towns with which they were familiar in New England; many buildings in the new settlements were designed in the Georgian, Federal, and Greek Revival styles. Towns such as Aurora, Bath, Canfield, Chagrin Falls, Gates Mills, Hudson, Medina, Milan, Norwalk, Oberlin, Painesville, Poland, and Tallmadge exemplify the expression of these styles and traditional New England town planning. For instance, Cleveland&#x27;s Public Square reflects the traditional New England central town green.

<doc id="568664" wikidata="Q4017768" url="?curid=568664" title="Waldo (short story)">
<text>&quot;Waldo&quot; (1942) is a short story by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, originally published in &quot;Astounding Magazine&quot; in August 1942 under the pseudonym Anson MacDonald. It is available in the 1950 book &quot;Waldo &amp; Magic, Inc.&quot; (as well as other collections). Both stories in that collection involve magic but are otherwise unrelated.

The essence of the story is the journey of a mechanical genius from his self-imposed exile from the rest of humanity to a more normal life, conquering the disease myasthenia gravis as well as his own contempt for humans in general. The key to this is that magic is loose in the world, but in a logical and scientific way.

Waldo Farthingwaite-Jones was born a weakling, unable even to lift his head up to drink or to hold a spoon. Far from destroying him, this channeled his intellect, and his family&#x27;s money, into the development of the device patented as &quot;Waldo F. Jones&#x27; Synchronous Reduplicating Pantograph&quot;. Wearing a glove and harness, Waldo could control a much more powerful mechanical hand simply by moving his hand and fingers. This and other technologies he develops make him a rich man, rich enough to build a home in space.

In the story, these devices became popularly known as &quot;waldos&quot;. In reference to this story, the real-life remote manipulators that were later developed also came to be called waldos, some even by NASA. Later, an American company, The Character Shop, which creates animatronic devices and objects (often for motion pictures), obtained the trademark to &quot;Waldo&quot; for &quot;data-capture input devices&quot;.

Waldo&#x27;s personality can best be described as arrogance combined with misanthropy. He does not think of himself as crippled. In his mind he is superior to all other humans because of his weakness. He reasons that if a chimpanzee is ten times as strong as a man, and a Waldo is ten times as strong as a man, then waldos are as far above men as men are above chimpanzees. He calls the rest of humanity &quot;overmuscled canaille, smooth chimps&quot;. His home&#x27;s location, which he calls &quot;Freehold&quot;, is located in orbit high above Earth and is symbolic of his relation to the rest of humanity.

==Plot summary==

As the story opens, a dancer is performing feats of astonishing virtuosity on stage. Afterward, in the dressing room, while preparing to depart for his other job as a neurosurgeon, the dancer reminisces to a reporter about what made him take up dancing. The rest of the story is told as a flashback.

James Stevens, Chief Engineer of North American Power-Air (NAPA), is desperate to discover what is causing vehicles driven by broadcast power to cease functioning. Society has harnessed cheap atomic power, broadcast by NAPA, to run homes, factories, ground vehicles, and even personal aircraft which can travel into space. If the failures continue, not only will he lose his job but the entire power system of the country could collapse.

The heart of the technology is the &quot;deKalb receptor&quot;. The deKalbs are failing, and no one can identify the cause. In desperation, Stevens approaches Doc Grimes, a physician who has known Waldo since birth, to try to persuade Waldo to help. Waldo has a grudge against NAPA after losing a legal battle with them some years before.

Waldo lives on a space station in high orbit, where microgravity allows him to move around despite his weakness. He makes his living as a consulting engineer, with a specialty in fine motor skills.

Once Grimes reveals Stevens&#x27; purpose, Waldo turns hostile. Nothing would persuade him to help NAPA. Stevens leaves, but Grimes has a few words with Waldo, pointing out where his food comes from and so forth. Waldo reluctantly takes the case, but Grimes insists on one more condition: Waldo must figure out what effect broadcast power has on humans. Grimes is seeing a slow weakening of the human physique, and he blames the radiant power industry.

Stevens returns to Earth, to find that McLeod, one of his engineers who had experienced a power failure in his personal craft, has returned. He tells Stevens that he fixed the deKalbs. McLeod broke down in Pennsylvania Dutch country, where he grew up. Visiting an old hex doctor known as Gramps Schneider, McLeod let him look at the deKalbs. Schneider announced that &quot;now the fingers will make&quot;, meaning the antennas on the deKalbs will work. McLeod finds to his surprise that the deKalbs are indeed functional. However he has a surprise for Stevens. In operation, the antennas now flex and wiggle like fingers reaching for something.

Waldo, meanwhile, having satisfied himself that the deKalbs really are having basic problems, also realizes that Grimes is right. Then he gets a call from NAPA&#x27;s head of research, Dr. Rambeau, who seems to have come unhinged. Having seen the wiggling deKalbs, he announces that he knows what is happening. &quot;Magic is loose in the world!&quot; he tells Waldo. He shows Waldo some seemingly impossible tricks he can do now that he understands magic. Waldo calls Stevens to have Rambeau brought to him, but Stevens reports that Rambeau somehow escaped from his restraints without actually unfastening them. Not only that, he has made another set of deKalbs behave as strangely as McLeod&#x27;s. Waldo asks to have Rambeau&#x27;s notes and equipment shipped up to him.

Seeing the eccentric deKalbs, Waldo realizes that he must learn what happened to them. Schneider will not leave his home, so Waldo has to go back to Earth, an experience he dreads. Shipped down in a medical craft, with Grimes in attendance, he lies in his waterbed while Schneider examines him. Schneider thinks he should get up and walk, but Waldo protests he cannot. Schneider tells him he must &quot;reach out for the power&quot;. According to Schneider, the &quot;Other World is close by and full of power&quot;, waiting only for someone to grab it. In Schneider&#x27;s hands, Waldo does indeed experience a sense of well-being, and is able to lift up a coffee cup one-handed for the first time in his life.

Schneider explains an old philosophy, how something which can be true for this world might not be for the Other World. Since our minds sit in the Other World, this is important. McLeod, according to Schneider, was &quot;tired and fretful&quot;, and found one of the &quot;bad truths&quot;, causing the deKalbs to fail. Schneider simply looked for the other truth, and the deKalbs worked again.

At first Waldo thinks the journey wasted. He tries Schneider&#x27;s methods on a failed deKalb. To his astonishment, they begin to work in just the same fashion as McLeod&#x27;s. Stevens calls him to say that things are getting much worse. Waldo, thrown off balance by the &quot;impossible&quot; thing he has just seen, decides to twit Stevens with Rambeau&#x27;s words: &quot;Magic is loose in the world!&quot;

Waldo realizes that Stevens&#x27; and Grimes&#x27; problems are related. Radiant power is affecting the human nervous system. People feel weak, rundown, fretful, and somehow transfer their malaise to the deKalbs. He also realizes something that Stevens has not noticed. The repaired deKalbs work without broadcast power. Apparently they draw energy from Schneider&#x27;s &quot;Other World&quot;.

Waldo uses this to exact his revenge. Summoning NAPA&#x27;s representatives to his home, he demonstrates that he can fix deKalbs and can train others to fix them. The repairs are 100% reliable, he asserts. Having received their formal acknowledgment that he has fulfilled his contract, he unveils the &quot;Jones-Schneider deKalb&quot;, a Rube Goldberg contraption which appears to draw power from nowhere. He tells them that with this he can put NAPA out of business. Of course, NAPA offers a settlement from which Waldo profits hugely, even though the new deKalb is a repaired one with a lot of distracting technology attached.

Eventually Waldo realizes that he himself can draw strength from the Other World. Tricking Grimes and Stevens into taking him to Earth again, he walks out of the craft, almost causing Grimes to have a heart attack.

Flash-forwarding back to the dancer, who is Waldo, we see him depart the dressing room with great &quot;bonhomie&quot;. His principal assistant is the former chairman of the board at North American Power-Air.

==Reception==
L. Sprague de Camp praised &quot;Waldo&quot; for reflecting Heinlein&#x27;s typical virtues: &quot;his prodigality of invention, his shrewd grasp of human nature and his versatile knowledge of law, politics, business and science.&quot; However, he noted that although the story was &quot;fast-moving,&quot; it &quot;peter[ed] out at the end instead of rising to a climax.&quot;

==The waldo==
A typical illustration of the tools in the story is Waldo&#x27;s handling of his need to perform micro-dissection on the scale of cellular walls. He uses human-sized waldos to make smaller waldos, then uses those to make even smaller waldos, and continues the series until he has waldos small enough to work at the cellular scale.

There are three main factors involved in Heinlein&#x27;s description of the tools:

* They work like human hands: not with a single active lever or twenty different tools, but with components arranged and with actions like human hands. The operator puts his or her hands in &quot;gloves&quot; and the waldos repeat the movements of the hands.
* They work in conjunction with viewing equipment that lets the user see the waldos as if they have the size and action of his own hands. This, in conjunction with the first factor, means that waldos are a &quot;no-training&quot; tool: if you know how to use your hands, you can use waldos.
* They allow work to be done remotely, in the next room or many miles away, or in an environment that could kill a human or be contaminated by human presence. They can be a different size from normal human hands: either huge for building construction or tiny for micro-manipulation.

==Cultural references==
The time in which the story is set is not mentioned, but is clearly decades ahead of the 1940s when it was written. When Waldo visits Gramps Schneider, whom McLeod described as being older than anybody even when McLeod was a child, he notices a campaign button on the wall of Schneider&#x27;s house. The slogan on the button is &quot;Free Silver&quot;, a reference to the politics of the late 1800s in the United States. Waldo thinks, &quot;Schneider must be—old!&quot;

<doc id="568667" wikidata="Q1749015" url="?curid=568667" title="Blachernae">
<text>Blachernae () was a suburb in the northwestern section of Constantinople, the capital city of the Byzantine Empire. It is the site of a water source and a number of prominent churches were built there, most notably the great Church of St. Mary of Blachernae (&quot;Panagia Blacherniotissa&quot;), built by Empress Pulcheria in c. 450, expanded by Emperor Leo I (r. 457–474) and renovated by Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) in the 6th century.

==Etymology==
The Romanian philologist Ilie Gherghel wrote a study about Blachernae and concluded that it possibly derived from the name of a Vlach. (sometimes written as Blach or Blasi) Gherghel compared data from old historians like Genesios and from the Greek lexicon &quot;Suidas&quot; and mentioned the existence of a small colony of Vlachs in the area of today Blachernae. Similar opinions were sustained by Lisseanu. The name Blachernae appeared in a work of Theophanes the Confessor in connection with a revolt of Flavius Vitalianus against Emperor Anastasius I in 513.

It is important to note, however, that Skarlatos Byzantios, in his influential work Constantinople Volume I, mentions the Greek tradition that the district was named after the fish species Lakernai, which the locals fished there in large quantities and called Blachernai.

According to Ilie Gherghel, the word Vlach became known in the Germanic and Slavic world through the Vikings that came in contact with the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantine origin of the word Vlach is supported by the historian Stelian Brezeanu who considers that one of the first accounts about Romanians south of the Danube, referred to by the name &quot;vlachorynchini&quot; (the Vlachs near the Rynchos river), is present in a historical account about the Kastamonitou Monastery which was written in the 17th century but based on a 9th-century Byzantine source.

==Byzantine era==
The quarter is recorded as &quot;regio XIV&quot; in the early 5th-century &quot;Notitia Urbis Constantinopolitanae&quot;, where it is recorded as being enclosed by a wall of its own. The quarter was connected to the city proper at the construction of the Theodosian Walls, but the Church of St. Mary remained outside of the walls until 627, when Emperor Heraclius (r. 610–641) built another wall to enclose it. By that time, the church had become the major Marian shrine of the city, and the second-most important church in Constantinople after Hagia Sophia, if only because the emperors&#x27; residence was nearby. In 1347, Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos (r. 1347–1354) was crowned there, instead of at Hagia Sophia.

South of the church and situated on the city&#x27;s Seventh Hill stood the imperial Palace of Blachernae, which was first erected in c. 500. During the Komnenian period, it became the favourite imperial residence, eclipsing the older Great Palace of Constantinople on the eastern end of the city. Although the Latin emperors returned to the Bucoleon Palace, the Palaiologos emperors of the restored Byzantine Empire again used the Blachernae Palace as their main residence. The Palace of the Porphyrogenitus () and the so-called Prison of Anemas are the main surviving structures of the Palace of Blachernae, which was a complex of multiple buildings.

Following the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in May 1453, the Sultan&#x27;s residence was moved to Topkapı Palace on the site of the ancient acropolis of Byzantium, opposite to the original site of the Great Palace, which had by this time fallen into complete ruin, and the Blachernae area (with the exception of the Palace of Porphyrogenitus) fell into disuse.

During the Byzantine Papacy, the portion of the Aventine overlooking the Greek quarter of Rome became known as the &quot;ad Balcernas&quot; or &quot;Blachernas&quot;.

==Today==
The historic Blachernae area is in the present-day Istanbul quarter known as Ayvansaray. The sacred spring, associated with the Virgin Mary, can still be visited today; in Turkish it is named &quot;Ayazma&quot;, a name derived from the Greek term &quot;hagiasma&quot; (Greek: ), meaning &quot;holy water&quot;.

<text>In chemistry and physics, valence electrons are electrons in the outermost shell of an atom, and that can participate in the formation of a chemical bond if the outermost shell is not closed. In a single covalent bond, a shared pair forms with both atoms in the bond each contributing one valence electron.

The presence of valence electrons can determine the element&#x27;s chemical properties, such as its valence—whether it may bond with other elements and, if so, how readily and with how many. In this way, a given element&#x27;s reactivity is highly dependent upon its electronic configuration. For a main-group element, a valence electron can exist only in the outermost electron shell; for a transition metal, a valence electron can also be in an inner shell.

An atom with a closed shell of valence electrons (corresponding to a noble gas configuration) tends to be chemically inert. Atoms with one or two valence electrons more than a closed shell are highly reactive due to the relatively low energy to remove the extra valence electrons to form a positive ion. An atom with one or two electrons fewer than a closed shell is reactive due to its tendency either to gain the missing valence electrons and form a negative ion, or else to share valence electrons and form a covalent bond.

Similar to a core electron, a valence electron has the ability to absorb or release energy in the form of a photon. An energy gain can trigger the electron to move (jump) to an outer shell; this is known as atomic excitation. Or the electron can even break free from its associated atom&#x27;s shell; this is ionization to form a positive ion. When an electron loses energy (thereby causing a photon to be emitted), then it can move to an inner shell which is not fully occupied.

==Overview==

===Electron configuration===

The electrons that determine valence – how an atom reacts chemically – are those with the highest energy.

For a main-group element, the valence electrons are defined as those electrons residing in the electronic shell of highest principal quantum number &quot;n&quot;. Thus, the number of valence electrons that it may have depends on the electron configuration in a simple way. For example, the electronic configuration of phosphorus (P) is 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p3 so that there are 5 valence electrons (3s2 3p3), corresponding to a maximum valence for P of 5 as in the molecule PF5; this configuration is normally abbreviated to [Ne] 3s2 3p3, where [Ne] signifies the core electrons whose configuration is identical to that of the noble gas neon.

However, transition elements have (&quot;n&quot;−1)d energy levels that are very close in energy to the &quot;n&quot; level. So as opposed to main-group elements, a valence electron for a transition metal is defined as an electron that resides outside a noble-gas core. Thus, generally, the d electrons in transition metals behave as valence electrons although they are not in the outermost shell. For example, manganese (Mn) has configuration 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d5; this is abbreviated to [Ar] 4s2 3d5, where [Ar] denotes a core configuration identical to that of the noble gas argon. In this atom, a 3d electron has energy similar to that of a 4s electron, and much higher than that of a 3s or 3p electron. In effect, there are possibly seven valence electrons (4s2 3d5) outside the argon-like core; this is consistent with the chemical fact that manganese can have an oxidation state as high as +7 (in the permanganate ion: ). (But note that merely having that number of valence electrons does not imply that the corresponding oxidation state will exist. For example, fluorine is not known in oxidation state +7; and although the maximum known number of valence electrons is 16 in ytterbium and nobelium, no oxidation state higher than +9 is known for any element.)

The farther right in each transition metal series, the lower the energy of an electron in a d subshell and the less such an electron has valence properties. Thus, although a nickel atom has, in principle, ten valence electrons (4s2 3d8), its oxidation state never exceeds four. For zinc, the 3d subshell is complete in all known compounds, although it does contribute to the valence band in some compounds. Similar patterns hold for the (&quot;n&quot;−2)f energy levels of inner transition metals.

The d electron count is an alternative tool for understanding the chemistry of a transition metal.

===The number of valence electrons===

The number of valence electrons of an element can be determined by the periodic table group (vertical column) in which the element is categorized. In groups 1–12, the group number matches the number of valence electrons; in groups 13–18, the units digit of the group number matches the number of valence electrons. (Helium is the sole exception.)

Helium is an exception: despite having a 1s2 configuration with two valence electrons, and thus having some similarities with the alkaline earth metals with their &quot;n&quot;s2 valence configurations, its shell is completely full and hence it is chemically very inert and is usually placed in group 18 with the other noble gases.

==Valence shell==
The valence shell is the set of orbitals which are energetically accessible for accepting electrons to form chemical bonds.

For main-group elements, the valence shell consists of the &quot;n&quot;s and &quot;n&quot;p orbitals in the outermost electron shell. For transition metals the orbitals of the incomplete (&quot;n&quot;−1)d subshell are included, and for lanthanides and actinides incomplete (&quot;n&quot;−2)f and (&quot;n&quot;−1)d subshells. The orbitals involved can be in an inner electron shell and do not all correspond to the same electron shell or principal quantum number &quot;n&quot; in a given element, but they are all at similar energies.

As a general rule, a main-group element (except hydrogen or helium) tends to react to form a s2p6 electron configuration. This tendency is called the octet rule, because each bonded atom has 8 valence electrons including shared electrons. Similarly, a transition metal tends to react to form a d10s2p6 electron configuration. This tendency is called the 18-electron rule, because each bonded atom has 18 valence electrons including shared electrons.

The heavy group 2 elements calcium, strontium, and barium can use the (&quot;n&quot;−1)d subshell as well, giving them some similarities to transition metals.

==Chemical reactions==

The number of valence electrons in an atom governs its bonding behavior. Therefore, elements whose atoms have the same number of valence electrons are often grouped together in the periodic table of the elements, especially if they also have the same types of valence orbitals.

The most reactive kind of metallic element is an alkali metal of group 1 (e.g., sodium or potassium); this is because such an atom has only a single valence electron. During the formation of an ionic bond, which provides the necessary ionization energy, this one valence electron is easily lost to form a positive ion (cation) with a closed shell (e.g., Na+ or K+). An alkaline earth metal of group 2 (e.g., magnesium) is somewhat less reactive, because each atom must lose two valence electrons to form a positive ion with a closed shell (e.g., Mg2+).

Within each group (each periodic table column) of metals, reactivity increases with each lower row of the table (from a light element to a heavier element), because a heavier element has more electron shells than a lighter element; a heavier element&#x27;s valence electrons exist at higher principal quantum numbers (they are farther away from the nucleus of the atom, and are thus at higher potential energies, which means they are less tightly bound).

A nonmetal atom tends to attract additional valence electrons to attain a full valence shell; this can be achieved in one of two ways: An atom can either share electrons with a neighboring atom (a covalent bond), or it can remove electrons from another atom (an ionic bond). The most reactive kind of nonmetal element is a halogen (e.g., fluorine (F) or chlorine (Cl)). Such an atom has the following electron configuration: s2p5; this requires only one additional valence electron to form a closed shell. To form an ionic bond, a halogen atom can remove an electron from another atom in order to form an anion (e.g., F−, Cl−, etc.). To form a covalent bond, one electron from the halogen and one electron from another atom form a shared pair (e.g., in the molecule H–F, the line represents a shared pair of valence electrons, one from H and one from F).

Within each group of nonmetals, reactivity decreases with each lower row of the table (from a light element to a heavy element) in the periodic table, because the valence electrons are at progressively higher energies and thus progressively less tightly bound. In fact, oxygen (the lightest element in group 16) is the most reactive nonmetal after fluorine, even though it is not a halogen, because the valence shells of the heavier halogens are at higher principal quantum numbers.

In these simple cases where the octet rule is obeyed, the valence of an atom equals the number of electrons gained, lost, or shared in order to form the stable octet. However, there are also many molecules that are exceptions, and for which the valence is less clearly defined.

==Electrical conductivity==
Valence electrons are also responsible for the bonding in the pure chemical elements, and whether their electrical conductivity is characteristic of metals, semiconductors, or insulators.

Metallic elements generally have high electrical conductivity when in the solid state. In each row of the periodic table, the metals occur to the left of the nonmetals, and thus a metal has fewer possible valence electrons than a nonmetal. However, a valence electron of a metal atom has a small ionization energy, and in the solid-state this valence electron is relatively free to leave one atom in order to associate with another nearby. This situation characterises metallic bonding. Such a &quot;free&quot; electron can be moved under the influence of an electric field, and its motion constitutes an electric current; it is responsible for the electrical conductivity of the metal. Copper, aluminium, silver, and gold are examples of good conductors.

A nonmetallic element has low electrical conductivity; it acts as an insulator. Such an element is found toward the right of the periodic table, and it has a valence shell that is at least half full (the exception is boron). Its ionization energy is large; an electron cannot leave an atom easily when an electric field is applied, and thus such an element can conduct only very small electric currents. Examples of solid elemental insulators are diamond (an allotrope of carbon) and sulfur. These form covalently bonded structures, either with covalent bonds extending across the whole structure (as in diamond) or with individual covalent molecules weakly attracted to each other by intermolecular forces (as in sulfur). (The noble gases remain as single atoms, but those also experience intermolecular forces of attraction, that become stronger as the group is descended: helium boils at −269 °C, while radon boils at −61.7 °C.)

A solid compound containing metals can also be an insulator if the valence electrons of the metal atoms are used to form ionic bonds. For example, although elemental sodium is a metal, solid sodium chloride is an insulator, because the valence electron of sodium is transferred to chlorine to form an ionic bond, and thus that electron cannot be moved easily.

A semiconductor has an electrical conductivity that is intermediate between that of a metal and that of a nonmetal; a semiconductor also differs from a metal in that a semiconductor&#x27;s conductivity increases with temperature. The typical elemental semiconductors are silicon and germanium, each atom of which has four valence electrons. The properties of semiconductors are best explained using band theory, as a consequence of a small energy gap between a valence band (which contains the valence electrons at absolute zero) and a conduction band (to which valence electrons are excited by thermal energy).

<text>Adventures of Superman is an American superhero television series based on comic book characters and concepts that Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster created in 1938. The show was the first television series to feature Superman and began filming in 1951 in California on RKO-Pathé stages and the RKO Forty Acres back lot. Cereal manufacturer Kellogg&#x27;s sponsored the show. The first and last airdates of the show, which was produced for first-run syndication rather than for a network, are disputed, but they are generally accepted as September 19, 1952, and April 28, 1958. The show&#x27;s first two seasons (episodes 1–52, 26 titles per season) were filmed in black-and-white; seasons three to six (episodes 53–104, 13 titles per season) were filmed in color.

George Reeves played Superman, with Jack Larson as Jimmy Olsen, John Hamilton as Perry White, and Robert Shayne as Inspector Henderson. Phyllis Coates played Lois Lane in the first season, with Noel Neill, who had previously played Lois in the film serials &quot;Superman&quot; (1948) and &quot;Atom Man vs. Superman&quot; (1950), taking over starting with the second season. In the series, Superman battles crooks, gangsters, and other villains in the city of Metropolis while masquerading &quot;off duty&quot; as &quot;Daily Planet&quot; reporter Clark Kent. In most of the series&#x27; episodes, Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen, Clark&#x27;s colleagues in the office, find themselves in dangerous situations that only Superman&#x27;s timely intervention can resolve.

The opening theme is known as &quot;The Superman March&quot;. In 1987, select episodes of the show were released on VHS. In 2006, the series became available in its entirety on DVD to coincide with the DVD release of &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, the first Superman feature film in almost two decades. The feature &quot;Hollywoodland&quot; (2006) dramatized the show&#x27;s production and the death of George Reeves.

== Production ==
In November 1951, California exhibitor and B-movie producer Robert L. Lippert released a 58-minute black-and-white film starring George Reeves and Phyllis Coates called &quot;Superman and the Mole Men&quot;, with a script by Robert Maxwell and direction by Lee Sholem. The film served as a pilot for &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; and prompted the start of production of the first season in August/September of the same year. The series however discontinued production and remained unaired until September 1952, when cereal manufacturer Kellogg&#x27;s agreed to sponsor the show, which they had previously done with the Superman radio series. The success of the series came as a complete surprise to the cast. Jack Larson recalled that, at the time, he was in New York City, and his newfound fame caught him off guard. The initial feature film, &quot;Superman and the Mole Men&quot;, was subsequently edited into a two-part storyline called &quot;The Unknown People&quot; and was to be broadcast mid-season, but it went unaired until the two-parter was added to the syndication package of some stations in 1954. It was the only multi-part storyline of the series, and is sometimes broadcast as the &quot;unofficial&quot; season one finale.
=== Black-and-white seasons, 1952–1954 ===

Phyllis Coates, like George Reeves, was a popular lead in B features of the period. For the TV series, Reeves asked that Coates receive equal star billing as Lois Lane, an enterprising reporter who tries to outdo Clark Kent at getting major news stories. Jack Larson&#x27;s Jimmy Olsen is a &quot;Daily Planet&quot; intern, often investigating wrongdoings. The villains often catch him, and Superman has to rescue him. In the film noir–like early episodes, Superman is seen as a semi-mysterious presence who is unknown to many crooks, but eventually they know who he is. The first season&#x27;s episodes usually featured action-packed, dark, gritty, and often violent story lines in which Superman fought gangsters and crime lords. Many characters died in these episodes, with some deaths being shown onscreen.

=== Color seasons, 1954–1958 ===
In the color seasons, the villains were often caricatured, and violence was toned down. The only gunfire that occurred was aimed at Superman, and he was less likely to engage in fisticuffs with the villains. On occasions when he did use physical force, he would take them out in a single blow or by banging them together. More often than not, the villains were likely to knock themselves out while fleeing from Superman. At this point, Jimmy, who was popular with viewers, was being played as the show&#x27;s comic foil to Superman. Most plots had Jimmy and Lois being captured, only for Superman to rescue them at the last minute.
Scripts for the sixth and final season reestablished some of the show&#x27;s seriousness, often utilizing science fiction elements such as a Kryptonite-powered robot, atomic explosions, and impregnable metal cubes. In one of the last episodes, &quot;The Perils of Superman&quot;, which was one of three episodes George Reeves directed, there was high stakes as the characters found themselves in perilous situations. ABC-TV aired episodes in its &quot;Fun At Five&quot; series during the 1957-58 season.

Reeves appeared as Superman in &quot;Lucy and Superman&quot;, an episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; that aired on January 14, 1957. In the episode, Reeves appears as himself playing TV&#x27;s Superman, though George Reeves is not mentioned until the credits. The announcement &quot;Our guest star tonight was George Reeves, star of the &quot;Superman&quot; series&quot; was removed from the episode after its first network broadcast. The episode was colorized and re-broadcast as part of an hour-long &quot;Lucy&quot; special on the CBS network on May 17, 2015.

=== Stamp Day for Superman ===

In 1954, at the request of the U.S. Treasury Department, the production company made a special short film directed by Thomas Carr. It was created to promote school savings-stamp plans to children, and was shown in grade schools during the 1950s. It is the only episode of the series that has entered the public domain. It features Clark Kent/Superman, Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane as well as Tristram Coffin as a government spokesman and Billy Nelson as a criminal. The film was released on the Season Two DVD box set of &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; as the second season finale.

=== Locations ===
&quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; began filming at the RKO-Pathé studios, later Desilu Studios, in Culver City, California, in August–September 1951. It was a low-budget program by the standards of its time, as episodes cost roughly $15,000 apiece. From 1953 to 1954, the show was filmed at California Studios and in 1955 it was filmed at Charlie Chaplin Studios. From 1956 to 1957, it was filmed at Ziv Studios.

The establishing shot of &quot;The Daily Planet&quot; in the first season was the E. Clem Wilson Building in Los Angeles, California, on Wilshire Boulevard, which was famous for decades as the headquarters of Mutual of Omaha. The Carnation Milk Company Building, located a few blocks east on Wilshire, served as &quot;The Daily Planet&quot;″s front door. From the second season onward, stock shots of the 32-story Los Angeles City Hall were used as the Planet building, and the sidewalk entrance to the Planet was a studio-bound &quot;exterior&quot;.

Many exteriors in the first season were shot at the RKO Pictures backlot, called &quot;Forty Acres&quot;. Hillsides in Culver City, city streets of downtown Los Angeles, and residential areas of the San Fernando Valley were sometimes used as exteriors. In later seasons, filming occurred on sound stages, with exterior shots, such as cars driving along roadways, shot as second-unit material, often with doubles. Establishing shots of Queen of Angels Hospital in the Echo Park section of Los Angeles were often used in episodes such as &quot;The Face and the Voice&quot; during the second season. Another Los Angeles stock footage landmark was the Griffith Observatory, which had several appearances in the series, such as Jor-El&#x27;s home/laboratory. Aside from a few clips of New York City used in &quot;Superman on Earth&quot;, most of the stock clips used to depict Metropolis are of the Los Angeles area.

=== Opening sequence ===
The show&#x27;s title card imitated the three-dimensional lettering of the comic book covers. There have been disputes about the article &quot;the&quot;, since it was spoken by narrators in voice-overs. Some references title the show &quot;&quot;The&quot; Adventures of Superman&quot;; other books, as well as &quot;TV Guide&quot; listings, simply label the show &quot;Superman&quot;. The onscreen title of the show is &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;.

Bill Kennedy, framed by the show&#x27;s theme music, voiced its opening narration, which was expanded from of the 1940s radio show and the 1940s Superman cartoons. The opening narration of the show set the stage for each program:

From the second season onward, the final sentence (&quot;and now, another exciting episode in the &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;!&quot;) was dropped. In later syndication, when Kellogg&#x27;s was no longer the sponsor, the episode openings were re-edited to remove the opening line relating to them.

=== Music ===
The score for the series was taken from stock music libraries, often adaptations of music from B-movies. For example, one cue used in the episode &quot;Peril by Sea&quot; also appears in &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;. Another cue, used in the second season episodes &quot;The Machine that Could Plot Crimes&quot;, &quot;Jungle Devil&quot;, The Clown Who Cried&quot;, and &quot;The Golden Vulture&quot;, came from the seventh variation of Miklos Rozsa&#x27;s &quot;Theme, Variations &amp; Finale&quot;, Op. 13, from 1933. There was original music written for the series, such as the March used in the credits. The theme has been ascribed to studio music arranger Leon Klatzkin, although it was certainly adapted from the earlier &quot;Superman March&quot; written by Sammy Timberg for the 1940&#x27;s Superman cartoons. Except for the title theme, musical cues ranged in tone and were different for each season, except for the third season, where some cues from the previous season would be reused in several episodes. The opening credits theme, which is used as Superman&#x27;s &quot;leitmotif&quot;, was often used whenever he was depicted flying or in action.

=== Flying effects ===
While considered simple by today&#x27;s standards, the &quot;flying&quot; effects on &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; were advanced for the time. Throughout the series, Superman&#x27;s &quot;flying&quot; involved three phases: take-off, flight, and landing. Cables and wires were used for Superman&#x27;s take-offs early in filming. For season one episodes, stuntmen took Reeves&#x27; place whenever cables and wires were used for take offs. At the end of season one, cables and wires stopped being used, and were later dropped altogether by the end of season two. As well, special effects head Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Hays left the series. By this time, a springboard was brought in for take off scenes, designed by the series&#x27; other SFX supervisor, Thol &quot;Si&quot; Simonson. Reeves would run into frame and hit the out-of-frame springboard, which would boost him out of frame, sometimes over the camera, and onto padding. The springboard had enough force, along with subtle camera manipulation, to make it look as though he was actually taking off. The typical technique had footage of Reeves stretched out on a spatula-like device formed to his torso and leg, operated on a counterweight like a boom microphone, allowing him to bank as if in flight. In some later episodes, such as &quot;The Atomic Secret&quot;, Reeves simulated flying, opting to lie on the device without the molded form to support his legs, which are seen to hang from the waist in those episodes.

In the two monochrome seasons, Reeves was occasionally filmed in front of aerial footage on a back-projection screen or against a neutral background, which would provide a matte which would be optically combined with a swish-pan or aerial shot. This footage was matted onto various backgrounds by which he would appear to fly. For the color episodes, the simpler and cheaper technique of a neutral cyclorama backing was used, usually sky-blue or black for night shots. Techniques for landings involved Reeves jumping off a ladder or holding an off-camera horizontal bar and swinging down into frame.

==Cast==
===Main characters===

* George Reeves as Kal-El / Clark Kent / Superman, a being from the dying planet Krypton who was sent to Earth in his infancy by his parents, Jor-El and Lara. He lands near Smallville on April 10, 1926 and is taken in by Eben and Sarah Kent, who raise him and name him Clark. As an adult, he moves from Smallville to Metropolis after Eben dies in 1951. In Metropolis, he becomes a &quot;Daily Planet&quot; reporter under his human name of Clark Kent. Clark Kent is mildly assertive and authoritative during situations when he is not Superman, as he frequently takes charge in emergencies and is not afraid to take risks. He puts his superpowers to work battling crime in Metropolis and is often called upon to rescue his associates Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane.
* Phyllis Coates (season 1) and Noel Neill (season 2-6) as Lois Lane, a reporter of the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; and Clark Kent&#x27;s associate, who suspects he is Superman. She is stated as being 26 years old in the episode &quot;The Tomb of Zaharan&quot;. She returns to her hometown in the season-one episode &quot;The Deserted Village&quot;.
* Jack Larson as Jimmy Olsen, a reporter and photographer with the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; and an associate of Kent and Lane. He serves as the show&#x27;s comic relief. His mother makes an appearance in an early episode. He lives with his mother at 360 Appletree Lane Apartment #3 in Metropolis. Though boyish in his tastes and sense of humor, he occasionally displays maturity and courage. Larson&#x27;s credit was elevated to the first position on the featured cast page over Noel Neil for the last two full color seasons.
* John Hamilton as Perry White, the blustering and impatient editor and publisher of the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, who sometimes participates in the exploits of Lois and Jimmy as they pursue news stories. He treats crooks and thugs with disdain and contempt—in one episode, he mentions that he was once a crime reporter. Perry&#x27;s sister Kate appears in the first-season episode &quot;Drums of Death&quot;; he also has a nephew, Chris, who appears in the second-season episode &quot;Jet Ace&quot;.
* Robert Shayne as Inspector Henderson of the Metropolis Police, a friend of the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; staff who often works with them in crime investigations. He has a teenage son named Ray, who appears in one episode. 

Recurring characters include Phillips Tead as Professor Pepperwinkle, Sterling Holloway as Professor Oscar Quinn, Danny Sue Nolan, Aline Towne, and Almira Sessions as Miss Bacharach, and Everett Glass as Professor Lucerne.

* Dabbs Greer, in &quot;Superman on Earth&quot;, the premiere episode, as a man falling from a dirigible; as a man falsely convicted of murder in &quot;Five Minutes to Doom&quot;; and in the dual roles of Mr. Pebble / Dan Dobey in &quot;The Superman Silver Mine&quot;. Greer would become well known years later as Reverend Alden on the television series &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;.
* Ed Hinton as Cave Man in &quot;Through the Time Barrier&quot; and as Joe in &quot;The Phantom Ring&quot;.

Other veteran film and television actors making appearances on the show included Dona Drake, George E. Stone, James Craven, Dan Seymour, Victor Sen Yung, Maudie Prickett, John Doucette, Norma Varden, Roy Barcroft, Elizabeth Patterson, and George Chandler.

Director Tommy Carr&#x27;s brother Steve appeared as an unbilled extra in nearly every one of the first 26 shows and frequently in more substantial character roles. He was also the show&#x27;s dialogue director and was the man pointing &quot;up in the sky&quot; in the introductions of the black-and-white shows.

==Episodes==

== Cancellation and aftermath ==
Producers planned to continue &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; in 1959 with two more years&#x27; worth of episodes, to begin airing in the 1960 season. The death of actor John Hamilton threw the plan into disarray. Actor Pierre Watkin was hired to replace Hamilton as &quot;Perry White&#x27;s brother&quot;. Watkin had played Perry White himself in the two Columbia serials and had guested on the series before.

The sudden death of the show&#x27;s star George Reeves in June 1959 was not the end of the series either, in the producers&#x27; eyes. When Jack Larson returned from Europe after the death of Reeves, producers suggested the series could continue as &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal, Jimmy Olsen&quot;, with more focus on Larson&#x27;s character, playing opposite a &quot;Superman&quot; who would be a composite of stock shots of George Reeves and a stunt double to be filmed from behind. Larson rejected the idea.

Another spin-off idea was a pilot Whitney Ellsworth produced in 1961: &quot;The Adventures of Superboy&quot;. Johnny Rockwell starred as a young Clark Kent in Smallville. As Superboy, he wore a suit similar in design to George Reeves&#x27; suit. Although thirteen scripts had been written, only the pilot was filmed.

Both Noel Neill and Jack Larson had minor roles in the 2006 film &quot;Superman Returns&quot;. Neill played the multimillionaire wife of Lex Luthor, played by Kevin Spacey, who dies at the beginning of the film, leaving her entire inheritance to Luthor, while Larson played a bartender.

A CGI version of Reeves as Superman appears in the 2023 DC Extended Universe film &quot;The Flash&quot;. The film also retroactively establishes that Jay Garrick / The Flash exists in the show&#x27;s universe.

<text>Serge Lepeltier (born 12 October 1953) is a French politician.

He studied at HEC Paris.

He was mayor of Bourges in 1995 and again in 2001. He was elected senator of the Cher &quot;département&quot; on 27 September 1998.

He won the municipal elections in Bourges in 1995 over the communist candidate.

He briefly acted as President of the Rally for the Republic in 2002 after Michèle Alliot-Marie was nominated as Minister of Defence, and just before the Party was officially dissolved within the Union for a Popular Movement.

On 31 March 2004, Jean-Pierre Raffarin&#x27;s government announced a reshuffle because of the massive losses in the French regional elections. Serge Lepeltier became Minister of the Environment, while Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin was dismissed.

In 2005 Serge Lepeltier joined the Radical Party.

<text>Ticonderoga () is a hamlet in the southeast part of the town of Ticonderoga, in Essex County, New York, United States. The name is derived from the Haudenosaunee term for &quot;between the two waters&quot;, the two waters being Lake George and Lake Champlain. The hamlet became a census-designated place (CDP) in 2008. As of the 2010 census, the population was 3,382, out of a total 5,042 residents in the town of Ticonderoga.

==History==
In 1889, the hamlet of Ticonderoga was incorporated as a village within the town of Ticonderoga, but in 1992 residents voted to dissolve the village. The area is an important location for the production of paper and the mining of graphite; the familiar yellow &quot;Ticonderoga pencils&quot; were named after the graphite mines.

Fort Ticonderoga, near the hamlet on Lake Champlain, (the hamlet is on Lake George), was a military outpost that fell into disrepair. The modern fort was built on its ruins.

The 1988 publication, &quot;Ticonderoga (Village) Multiple Resource Area&quot;, presents a history of the village and its historic sites.

The Lake George Steamboat Company continues to operate steamboats from Ticonderoga.

==Geography==
Ticonderoga is in Upstate New York, south of Plattsburgh, and near the Vermont border. 
The community lies between Lake George and Lake Champlain on the site of a portage between the two lakes, previously guarded by historic Fort Ticonderoga. The waterway running through this portage is called the La Chute River, which drains the outflow of Lake George into Lake Champlain, and it contains a waterfall at the eastern edge of the hamlet.

During the summer, a diesel-powered cable ferry connects the community to Shoreham, Vermont.

The junction of New York State Route 9N, New York State Route 74, and New York State Route 22 is at the northern edge of the CDP.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.81%, is water.

<doc id="568713" wikidata="Q6591613" url="?curid=568713" title="List of Native American musicians">
<text>This is a list of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] musicians and singers. They are notable musicians and singers, who are from peoples Indigenous to the contemporary United States, including Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Americans in the United States. While Native American identity can at times be a complex and contested issue, the Bureau of Indian Affairs defines Native American as having American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry, and legally, being Native American is defined as being enrolled in a federally recognized tribe or Alaskan village. Ethnologically, factors such as culture, history, language, religion, and familial kinships can influence Native American identity.

All individuals on this list should have Native American citizenship, to be listed as Native American (or ancestry, to be listed as a descendant) not just personal claims/belief. Historical figures might predate tribal enrollment practices and would be included based on ethnological tribal membership, while any contemporary individuals should either be enrolled members of federally recognized tribes or have cited Native American ancestry and be recognized as being Native American by their respective tribes(s). Contemporary unenrolled individuals are listed as being of descent from a tribe. For guidelines on naming conventions and sourcing Native American and identities, see and .

<text>Packaging is the science, art and technology of enclosing or protecting products for distribution, storage, sale, and use. Packaging also refers to the process of designing, evaluating, and producing packages. Packaging can be described as a coordinated system of preparing goods for transport, warehousing, logistics, sale, and end use. Packaging contains, protects, preserves, transports, informs, and sells. In many countries it is fully integrated into government, business, institutional, industrial, and for personal use.

&quot;Package labeling&quot; (American English) or &quot;labelling&quot; (British English) is any written, electronic, or graphic communication on the package or on a separate but associated label. Many countries or regions have regulations governing the content of package labels. Merchandising, branding, and persuasive graphics are not covered in this article.

==History of packaging==

===Ancient era===

The first packages used the natural materials available at the time: baskets of reeds, wineskins (bota bags), wooden boxes, pottery vases, ceramic amphorae, wooden barrels, woven bags, etc. Processed materials were used to form packages as they were developed: first glass and bronze vessels. The study of old packages is an essential aspect of archaeology.

The first usage of paper for packaging was sheets of treated mulberry bark used by the Chinese to wrap foods as early as the first or second century BC.

The usage of paper-like material in Europe was when the Romans used low grade and recycled papyrus for the packaging of incense.

The earliest recorded use of paper for packaging dates back to 1035, when a Persian traveller visiting markets in Cairo, Arab Egypt, noted that vegetables, spices and hardware were wrapped in paper for the customers after they were sold.

===Modern era===

====Tinplate====
The use of tinplate for packaging dates back to the 18th century. The manufacturing of tinplate was the monopoly of Bohemia for a long time; in 1667 Andrew Yarranton, an English engineer, and Ambrose Crowley brought the method to England where it was improved by ironmasters including Philip Foley. By 1697, John Hanbury had a rolling mill at Pontypool for making &quot;Pontypoole Plates&quot;. The method pioneered there of rolling iron plates by means of cylinders enabled more uniform black plates to be produced than was possible with the former practice of hammering.

Tinplate boxes first began to be sold from ports in the Bristol Channel in 1725. The tinplate was shipped from Newport, Monmouthshire. By 1805, 80,000 boxes were made and 50,000 exported. Tobacconists in London began packaging snuff in metal-plated canisters from the 1760s onwards.

====Canning====

With the discovery of the importance of airtight containers for food preservation by French inventor Nicholas Appert, the tin canning process was patented by British merchant Peter Durand in 1810. After receiving the patent, Durand did not himself follow up with canning food. He sold his patent in 1812 to two other Englishmen, Bryan Donkin and John Hall, who refined the process and product and set up the world&#x27;s first commercial canning factory on Southwark Park Road, London. By 1813, they were producing the first canned goods for the Royal Navy.

The progressive improvement in canning stimulated the 1855 invention of the can opener. Robert Yeates, a cutlery and surgical instrument maker of Trafalgar Place West, Hackney Road, Middlesex, UK, devised a claw-ended can opener with a hand-operated tool that haggled its way around the top of metal cans. In 1858, another lever-type opener of a more complex shape was patented in the United States by Ezra Warner of Waterbury, Connecticut.

====Paper-based packaging====

Set-up boxes were first used in the 16th century and modern folding cartons date back to 1839. The first corrugated box was produced commercially in 1817 in England. Corrugated (also called pleated) paper received a British patent in 1856 and was used as a liner for tall hats. Scottish-born Robert Gair invented the pre-cut paperboard box in 1890—flat pieces manufactured in bulk that folded into boxes. Gair&#x27;s invention came about as a result of an accident: as a Brooklyn printer and paper-bag maker during the 1870s, he was once printing an order of seed bags, and the metal ruler, commonly used to crease bags, shifted in position and cut them. Gair discovered that by cutting and creasing in one operation he could make prefabricated paperboard boxes.

Commercial paper bags were first manufactured in Bristol, England, in 1844, and the American Francis Wolle patented a machine for automated bag-making in 1852.

===20th century===

Packaging advancements in the early 20th century included Bakelite closures on bottles, transparent cellophane overwraps and panels on cartons. These innovations increased processing efficiency and improved food safety. As additional materials such as aluminum and several types of plastic were developed, they were incorporated into packages to improve performance and functionality.
In 1952, Michigan State University became the first university in the world to offer a degree in Packaging Engineering.

In-plant recycling has long been typical for producing packaging materials. Post-consumer recycling of aluminum and paper-based products has been economical for many years: since the 1980s, post-consumer recycling has increased due to curbside recycling, consumer awareness, and regulatory pressure.
Many prominent innovations in the packaging industry were developed first for military use. Some military supplies are packaged in the same commercial packaging used for general industry. Other military packaging must transport materiel, supplies, foods, etc. under severe distribution and storage conditions. Packaging problems encountered in World War II led to Military Standard or &quot;mil spec&quot; regulations being applied to packaging, which was then designated &quot;military specification packaging&quot;. As a prominent concept in the military, mil spec packaging officially came into being around 1941, due to operations in Iceland experiencing critical losses, ultimately attributed to bad packaging. In most cases, mil spec packaging solutions (such as barrier materials, field rations, antistatic bags, and various shipping crates) are similar to commercial grade packaging materials, but subject to more stringent performance and quality requirements.

, the packaging sector accounted for about two percent of the gross national product in developed countries. About half of this market was related to food packaging.
In 2019 the global food packaging market size was estimated at USD 303.26 billion, exhibiting a CAGR of 5.2% over the forecast period. Growing demand for packaged food by consumers owing to quickening pace of life and changing eating habits is expected to have a major impact on the market.

==The purposes of packaging and package labels==

Packaging and package labeling have several objectives
* Physical protection – The objects enclosed in the package may require protection from, among other things, mechanical shock, vibration, electrostatic discharge, abrasion, compression, temperature, etc.
* Barrier protection – A barrier to oxygen, water vapor, sunlight, dust, etc., is often required. Permeation is a critical factor in design. Some packages contain desiccants or oxygen absorbers to help extend shelf life. Modified atmospheres or controlled atmospheres are also maintained in some food packages. Keeping the contents clean, fresh, sterile and safe for the duration of the intended shelf life is a primary function. A barrier is also implemented in cases where segregation of two materials prior to end use is required, as in the case of special paints, glues, medical fluids, etc.
* Containment or agglomeration – liquids and powders need to be contained for shipment and sale. Small objects are typically grouped together in one package for reasons of storage and selling efficiency. For example, a single box of 1000 marbles requires less physical handling than 1000 single marbles. Liquids, powders, and granular materials need containment.
* Information transmission – Packages and labels communicate how to use, transport, recycle, or dispose of the package or product. With pharmaceuticals, food, medical, and chemical products, some types of information are required by government legislation. Some packages and labels also are used for track and trace purposes. Most items include their serial and lot numbers on the packaging, and in the case of food products, medicine, and some chemicals the packaging often contains an expiry/best-before date, usually in a shorthand form. Packages may indicate their construction material with a symbol.
* Marketing – Packaging and labels can be used by marketers to encourage potential buyers to purchase a product. Package graphic design and physical design have been important and constantly evolving phenomena for several decades. Marketing communications and graphic design are applied to the surface of the package and often to the point of sale display. Most packaging is designed to reflect the brand&#x27;s message and identity on the one hand while highlighting the respective product concept on the other hand.
* Security – Packaging can play an important role in reducing the security risks of shipment. Packages can be made with improved tamper resistance to deter manipulation and they can also have tamper-evident features indicating that tampering has taken place. Packages can be engineered to help reduce the risks of package pilferage or the theft and resale of products: Some package constructions are more resistant to pilferage than other types, and some have pilfer-indicating seals. Counterfeit consumer goods, unauthorized sales (diversion), material substitution and tampering can all be minimized or prevented with such anti-counterfeiting technologies. Packages may include authentication seals and use security printing to help indicate that the package and contents are not counterfeit. Packages also can include anti-theft devices such as dye-packs, RFID tags, or electronic article surveillance tags that can be activated or detected by devices at exit points and require specialized tools to deactivate. Using packaging in this way is a means of retail loss prevention.
* Convenience – Packages can have features that add convenience in distribution, handling, stacking, display, sale, opening, reclosing, using, dispensing, reusing, recycling, and ease of disposal
* Portion control – Single serving or single dosage packaging has a precise amount of contents to control usage. Bulk commodities (such as salt) can be divided into packages that are a more suitable size for individual households. It also aids the control of inventory: selling sealed one-liter bottles of milk, rather than having people bring their own bottles to fill themselves.
* Branding/Positioning – Packaging and labels are increasingly used to go beyond marketing to brand positioning, with the materials used and design chosen key to the storytelling element of brand development. Due to the increasingly fragmented media landscape in the digital age this aspect of packaging is of growing importance.

==Packaging types==

Packaging may be of several different types. For example, a &quot;transport package&quot; or &quot;distribution package&quot; can be the shipping container used to ship, store, and handle the product or inner packages. Some identify a &quot;consumer package&quot; as one which is directed toward a consumer or household.

Packaging may be described in relation to the type of product being packaged: medical device packaging, bulk chemical packaging, over-the-counter drug packaging, retail food packaging, military materiel packaging, pharmaceutical packaging, etc.

It is sometimes convenient to categorize packages by layer or function: &quot;primary&quot;, &quot;secondary&quot;, &quot;tertiary&quot;,etc.
* Primary packaging is the material that first envelops the product and holds it. This usually is the smallest unit of distribution or use and is the package which is in direct contact with the contents.
* Secondary packaging is outside the primary packaging, and may be used to prevent pilferage or to group primary packages together.
* Tertiary or transit packaging is used for bulk handling, warehouse storage and transport shipping. The most common form is a palletized unit load that packs tightly into containers.

These broad categories can be somewhat arbitrary. For example, depending on the use, a shrink wrap can be primary packaging when applied directly to the product, secondary packaging when used to combine smaller packages, or tertiary packaging when used to facilitate some types of distribution, such as to affix a number of cartons on a pallet.

Packaging can also have categories based on the package form. For example, &quot;thermoform packaging&quot; and &quot;flexible packaging&quot; describe broad usage areas.

==Labels and symbols used on packages==
Many types of symbols for package labeling are nationally and internationally standardized. For consumer packaging, symbols exist for product certifications (such as the FCC and TÜV marks), trademarks, proof of purchase, etc. Some requirements and symbols exist to communicate aspects of consumer rights and safety, for example the CE marking or the estimated sign that notes conformance to EU weights and measures accuracy regulations. Examples of environmental and recycling symbols include the recycling symbol, the recycling code (which could be a resin identification code), and the &quot;Green Dot&quot;. Food packaging may show food contact material symbols. In the European Union, products of animal origin which are intended to be consumed by humans have to carry standard, oval-shaped EC identification and health marks for food safety and quality insurance reasons.

Bar codes, Universal Product Codes, and RFID labels are common to allow automated information management in logistics and retailing. Country-of-origin labeling is often used. Some products might use QR codes or similar matrix barcodes. Packaging may have visible registration marks and other printing calibration and troubleshooting cues.

The labelling of medical devices includes many symbols, many of them covered by international standards, foremost ISO 15223-1.

===Consumer package contents===
Several aspects of consumer package labeling are subject to regulation. One of the most important is to accurately state the quantity (weight, volume, count) of the package contents. Consumers expect that the label accurately reflects the actual contents. Manufacturers and packagers must have effective quality assurance procedures and accurate equipment; even so, there is inherent variability in all processes.

Regulations attempt to handle both sides of this. In the US, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act provides requirements for many types of products. Also, NIST has Handbook 133, Checking the Net Contents of Packaged Goods. This is a procedural guide for compliance testing of net contents and is referenced by several other regulatory agencies.

Other regions and countries have their own regulatory requirements. For example, the UK has its Weights and Measures (Packaged Goods) Regulations as well as several other regulations. In the EEA, products with hazardous formulas need to have a UFI.

===Shipping container labeling===

Technologies related to shipping containers are identification codes, bar codes, and electronic data interchange (EDI). These three core technologies serve to enable the business functions in the process of shipping containers throughout the distribution channel. Each has an essential function: identification codes either relate product information or serve as keys to other data, bar codes allow for the automated input of identification codes and other data, and EDI moves data between trading partners within the distribution channel.

Elements of these core technologies include UPC and EAN item identification codes, the SCC-14 (UPC shipping container code), the SSCC-18 (Serial Shipping Container Codes), Interleaved 2-of-5 and UCC/EAN-128 (newly designated GS1-128) bar code symbologies, and ANSI ASC X12 and UN/EDIFACT EDI standards.

Small parcel carriers often have their own formats. For example, United Parcel Service has a MaxiCode 2-D code for parcel tracking.

RFID labels for shipping containers are also increasingly used. A Wal-Mart division, Sam&#x27;s Club, has also moved in this direction and is putting pressure on its suppliers to comply.

Shipments of hazardous materials or dangerous goods have special information and symbols (labels, placards, etc.) as required by UN, country, and specific carrier requirements. On transport packages, standardized symbols are also used to communicate handling needs. Some are defined in the ASTM D5445 &quot;Standard Practice for Pictorial Markings for Handling of Goods&quot;, ISO 780 &quot;Pictorial marking for handling of goods&quot;, and GHS hazard pictograms.
==Package development considerations==
Package design and development are often thought of as an integral part of the new product development process. Alternatively, the development of a package (or component) can be a separate process but must be linked closely with the product to be packaged.
Package design starts with the identification of all the requirements: structural design, marketing, shelf life, quality assurance, logistics, legal, regulatory, graphic design, end-use, environmental, etc. The design criteria, performance (specified by package testing), completion time targets, resources, and cost constraints need to be established and agreed upon. Package design processes often employ rapid prototyping, computer-aided design, computer-aided manufacturing and document automation.
An example of how package design is affected by other factors is its relationship to logistics. When the distribution system includes individual shipments by a small parcel carrier, the sorting, handling, and mixed stacking make severe demands on the strength and protective ability of the transport package. If the logistics system consists of uniform palletized unit loads, the structural design of the package can be designed to meet those specific needs, such as vertical stacking for a longer time frame. A package designed for one mode of shipment may not be suited to another.

With some types of products, the design process involves detailed regulatory requirements for the packaging. For example, any package components that may contact foods are designated food contact materials.
Toxicologists and food scientists need to verify that such packaging materials are allowed by applicable regulations. Packaging engineers need to verify that the completed package will keep the product safe for its intended shelf life with normal usage. Packaging processes, labeling, distribution, and sale need to be validated to assure that they comply with regulations that have the well being of the consumer in mind.

Sometimes the objectives of package development seem contradictory. For example, regulations for an over-the-counter drug might require the package to be tamper-evident and child resistant: These intentionally make the package difficult to open. The intended consumer, however, might be disabled or elderly and unable to readily open the package. Meeting all goals is a challenge.

Package design may take place within a company or with various degrees of external packaging engineering: independent contractors, consultants, vendor evaluations, independent laboratories, contract packagers, total outsourcing, etc. Some sort of formal project planning and project management methodology is required for all but the simplest package design and development programs. An effective quality management system and Verification and Validation protocols are mandatory for some types of packaging and recommended for all.

===Environmental considerations===


Package development involves considerations of sustainability, environmental responsibility, and applicable environmental and recycling regulations. It may involve a life cycle assessment
which considers the material and energy inputs and outputs to the package, the packaged product (contents), the packaging process, the logistics system, waste management, etc. It is necessary to know the relevant regulatory requirements for point of manufacture, sale, and use.

The traditional &quot;three R&#x27;s&quot; of reduce, reuse, and recycle are part of a waste hierarchy which may be considered in product and package development.
* Prevention – Waste prevention is a primary goal. Packaging should be used only where needed. Proper packaging can also help prevent waste. Packaging plays an important part in preventing loss or damage to the packaged product (contents). Usually, the energy content and material usage of the product being packaged are much greater than that of the package. A vital function of the package is to protect the product for its intended use: if the product is damaged or degraded, its entire energy and material content may be lost.
* Minimization (also &quot;source reduction&quot;) – Eliminate overpackaging. The mass and volume of packaging (per unit of contents) can be measured and used as criteria for minimizing the package in the design process. Usually &quot;reduced&quot; packaging also helps minimize costs. Packaging engineers continue to work toward reduced packaging.
* Reuse – Reusable packaging is encouraged. Returnable packaging has long been useful (and economically viable) for closed-loop logistics systems. Inspection, cleaning, repair, and recouperage are often needed. Some manufacturers re-use the packaging of the incoming parts for a product, either as packaging for the outgoing product or as part of the product itself.
* Recycling – Recycling is the reprocessing of materials (pre- and post-consumer) into new products. Emphasis is focused on recycling the largest primary components of a package: steel, aluminum, papers, plastics, etc. Small components can be chosen which are not difficult to separate and do not contaminate recycling operations. Packages can sometimes be designed to separate components to better facilitate recycling.
* Energy recovery – Waste-to-energy and refuse-derived fuel in approved facilities make use of the heat available from incinerating the packaging components.
* Disposal – Incineration, and placement in a sanitary landfill are undertaken for some materials. Certain US states regulate packages for toxic contents, which have the potential to contaminate emissions and ash from incineration and leachate from landfill. Packages should not be littered.

Development of sustainable packaging is an area of considerable interest to standards organizations, governments, consumers, packagers, and retailers.

Sustainability is the fastest-growing driver for packaging development, particularly for packaging manufacturers that work with the world&#x27;s leading brands, as their CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) targets often exceed those of the EU Directive.

==Packaging machinery==
Choosing packaging machinery includes an assessment of technical capabilities, labor requirements, worker safety, maintainability, serviceability, reliability, ability to integrate into the packaging line, capital cost, floorspace, flexibility (change-over, materials, multiple products, etc.), energy requirements, quality of outgoing packages, qualifications (for food, pharmaceuticals, etc.), throughput, efficiency, productivity, ergonomics, return on investment, etc.

Packaging machinery can be:
# purchased as standard, off-the-shelf equipment
# purchased custom-made or custom-tailored to specific operations
# manufactured or modified by in-house engineers and maintenance staff

Efforts at packaging line automation increasingly use programmable logic controllers and robotics.

Packaging machines may be of the following general types:
* Accumulating and collating machines
* Blister packs, skin packs and vacuum packaging machines
* Bottle caps equipment, over-capping, lidding, closing, seaming and sealing machines
* Box, case, tray, and carrier forming, packing, unpacking, closing, and sealing machines
* Cartoning machines
* Cleaning, sterilizing, cooling and drying machines
* Coding, printing, marking, stamping, and imprinting machines
* Converting machines
* Conveyor belts, accumulating and related machines
* Feeding, orienting, placing and related machines
* Filling machines: handling dry, powdered, solid, liquid, gas, or viscous products
* Inspecting: visual, sound, metal detecting, etc.
* Label dispenser
* Orienting, unscrambling machines
* Package filling and closing machines
* Palletizing, depalletizing, unit load assembly
* Product identification: labeling, marking, etc.
* Sealing machines: heat sealer or glue units
* Slitting machines
* Weighing machines: check weigher, multihead weigher
* Wrapping machines: stretch wrapping, shrink wrap, banding
* Form, fill and seal machines
* Other specialty machinery: slitters, perforating, laser cutters, parts attachment, etc.

<doc id="568717" wikidata="Q3472829" url="?curid=568717" title="Elizabethtown (CDP), New York">
<text>Elizabethtown is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the town of Elizabethtown in Essex County, New York, United States. The population of the CDP was 754 at the 2010 census, out of a total town population of 1,163.

Elizabethtown is the county seat of Essex County and the location of the town government. The name is taken from that of Elizabeth Gilliland, the wife of an early settler and investor, William Gilliland.

== History ==
The community was developed by settlers moving deeper into the town from the first settlement in New Russia. Elizabethtown became the county seat in 1807. Due to the focus on government, the law profession was a prominent occupation after the middle of the 19th century. Elizabethtown incorporated as a village in 1876, but the village government dissolved itself in 1981.

== The courthouse ==

The Essex County Courthouse is located in Ellizabethtown. The night of December 6, 1859, John Brown&#x27;s body lay there in state, with six local citizens, including Orlando Gibbons, as honor guard. The county later commissioned a life-size portrait of Brown, which hangs in the courthouse today (2021). &quot;An early county clerk&quot; framed these words from John Brown&#x27;s last speech:

== Geography ==
Elizabethtown is in the northern part of the town, located at the junction of US Route 9 and NY 9N. The Boquet River (pronounced BO-kwet) flows past the east side of the hamlet.

==Demographics==
==Education==
The census-designated place is in the Boquet Valley Central School District at Elizabethtown-Lewis-Westport.

<doc id="568719" wikidata="Q1032221" url="?curid=568719" title="Greendale (album)">
<text>Greendale is the 27th studio album by Neil Young. Young and Crazy Horse&#x27;s &quot;Greendale&quot; is a 10-song musical novel set in a fictional California seaside town of the same name. Based on the saga of the Green family, &quot;Greendale&quot; combines numerous themes on corruption, observation of the passing of time, environmentalism and mass media consolidation.

==Recording and writing==
Young recorded the album between July and September 2002 at his Broken Arrow Ranch. The sessions were produced by Young and filmmaker L.A. Johnson. The sessions feature Young on guitar, organ and harmonica backed only by drummer Ralph Molina and bassist Billy Talbot of longtime collaborators Crazy Horse. Unlike other works credited to the band, it does not feature a rhythm guitarist. Frank &quot;Poncho&quot; Sampedro does not appear on the album but did perform with the group during the album&#x27;s tour. Young chose to record the songs with a stripped-down production team with minimal backing from other musicians to allow the song&#x27;s stories and characters to be the focus. &quot;There were fewer people, fewer things going on, less distraction. I just tried to focus right in on the core and get back to the roots of what we do. Simple form enables you to get complex with the actual muse. You&#x27;re not distracted by technicalities. It was all about the content, and I just felt like with Crazy Horse the more simple it is, the better it is.&quot;

Young recorded each song as he wrote it, beginning with &quot;Devil&#x27;s Sidewalk&quot;. &quot;The songs started to unravel, I saw the story, what happened next. I wrote the songs one at a time and recorded each one before I&#x27;d write the next one. The songs just happened. First thing in the morning, I&#x27;d pick up a guitar, play two or three chords and go, &#x27;That&#x27;s the blueprint. That&#x27;s what my soul told me, so that&#x27;s what it is.&#x27; Then I&#x27;d go to the studio. I would write the words, without guitar, in my car. I&#x27;d keep stopping on the way – write two verses, go a hundred yards, stop, write some more. I kept moving, and writing, until I got to the studio. Whatever I had then, that was the song. &quot;Devil&#x27;s Sidewalk&quot; – the recording is the first time I sang it, the first time the band had ever heard it.&quot; 

Young did not start with an overall premise and write the songs to fit the overall story, but rather wrote each song one by one, and the overall story emerged from the individual songs themselves. &quot;I simply started writing. I don&#x27;t know exactly what happened. I&#x27;ve never written songs with characters in them before. I simply wrote a song and then thought: &#x27;Hey, that&#x27;s interesting.&#x27; And then I wrote another song. In the first song, I found it exciting that there were characters with names, that conversed. The next day I wrote a new song with the same characters.&quot; &quot;I just let it out. I never tried to make things fit together or anything. I just kept on going. Luckily I could jump from character to character and so continuity wasn&#x27;t that important. And I found out later that the continuity was golden all the way through.&quot; A contemporary review of the album by &quot;The Guardian&quot; succinctly rehashes the album&#x27;s storyline as follows: &quot;Grandpa Green is an ornery patriarch who finds himself in the media spotlight when his great-nephew Jed accidentally shoots a cop. Grandpa then suffers a fatal heart attack while fending off a reporter. The death somehow prompts his granddaughter Sun to become an eco-warrior, until FBI surveillance prompts her to leave Greendale for good.&quot;

==Release==
In 2004, the CD was released with a DVD containing &quot;Inside Greendale&quot;, a documentary featuring in-studio performances of the album being recorded. A DVD-Audio version and box set vinyl LP version were also released, with both Advanced Resolution Stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes, and a video of &quot;Devil&#x27;s Sidewalk&quot; from the film. 

A map of the fictional town, a gallery of Earl Green&#x27;s art, a family tree diagram, and biographies of each character were provided on Young&#x27;s website at the time. Young filmed a movie on Super 8 to accompany the music. Young cast friends and family members as the album&#x27;s characters. Wife Pegi Young plays Edith and steel guitarist Ben Keith plays Grandpa. Sun Green is played by Sarah White, a classmate of Young&#x27;s daughter Amber. In the movie, the actors lip-synch Young&#x27;s lyrics as he sings them. The movie was played on stage during the full-band concerts in fall 2003 and a feature-length DVD of the movie was released in late 2004.

==Tour==
Young performed the song cycle in a solo acoustic setting during a tour of Europe in April and May 2003. Young gave extended intros to each song and shared the story of the characters during the performances. The concerts marked the first time Young played a setlist consisting of a song cycle of new material since introducing &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; to audiences in 1973. &quot;There&#x27;s a charge in doing all these new songs at once, all in a row. It&#x27;s a big rebirth for me. I was apprehensive introducing this much new material at once, but it&#x27;s something I looked forward to, because it&#x27;s a challenge. A challenge for me, and a challenge for the audience: It&#x27;s really one long song, and to get your money&#x27;s worth, you have to pay attention.&quot; A DVD of performances filmed at Vicar Street, Dublin was included with some editions of the album. An audio-only version has since been made available as a stand-alone live album on digital download and streaming services such as iTunes and Amazon.

Between June and November 2003, Young toured the material with the support of Crazy Horse and background singers. In November 2020, a live album from a September performance from The Air Canada Centre in Toronto was released as &quot;Return to Greendale&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Greendale&quot; has been compared to the literary classics of Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Our Town&quot; and Sherwood Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; for its complexity and emotional depth in exploring a small town in America. The album, concert, film and DVDs have produced a vast divergence of critical opinion ranging from being called &quot;amateur&quot; to being voted as one of the best albums of 2003 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine music critics.

<doc id="568720" wikidata="Q4019769" url="?curid=568720" title="The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok">
<text>The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok is an American Western television series that ran for eight seasons from April 15, 1951, through September 24, 1958. The Screen Gems series began in syndication, but ran on CBS from June 5, 1955, through 1958, and, at the same time, on ABC from 1957 through 1958. The Kellogg&#x27;s cereal company was the show&#x27;s national sponsor. The series was also exported to Australia during the late 1950s.

==Synopsis==
&quot;The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok&quot; starred Guy Madison as the legendary Old West lawman (in real life, also a gunfighter) United States Marshal James Butler &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Hickok, and Andy Devine as his comedy sidekick, Jingles P. Jones. The series was set in the 1870s, with Hickok and Jones based at Fort Larabee.

==Production==
The series was produced by William F. Broidy Productions. It consisted of 113 episodes, the last 13 of which were made in color. In 1957 Screen Gems bought the Broidy company&#x27;s assets, which included 100 &quot;Hickok&quot; episodes on film. Tommy Carr was the director. Kellogg&#x27;s cereals sponsored it.

==Episodes==

==Other media==
Devine and Madison portrayed their roles on Mutual radio from April 1, 1951, to 1956.

<doc id="568726" wikidata="Q5875" url="?curid=568726" title="Giant star">
<text>A giant star has a substantially larger radius and luminosity than a main-sequence (or &quot;dwarf&quot;) star of the same surface temperature. They lie above the main sequence (luminosity class V in the Yerkes spectral classification) on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram and correspond to luminosity classes II and III. The terms &quot;giant&quot; and &quot;dwarf&quot; were coined for stars of quite different luminosity despite similar temperature or spectral type (namely K and M) by Ejnar Hertzsprung in 1905 or 1906.

Giant stars have radii up to a few hundred times the Sun and luminosities over 10 times that of the Sun. Stars still more luminous than giants are referred to as supergiants and hypergiants.

A hot, luminous main-sequence star may also be referred to as a giant, but any main-sequence star is properly called a dwarf, regardless of how large and luminous it is.

== Formation ==

A star becomes a giant after all the hydrogen available for fusion at its core has been depleted and, as a result, leaves the main sequence. The behaviour of a post-main-sequence star depends largely on its mass.

===Intermediate-mass stars===
For a star with a mass above about 0.25 solar masses (), once the core is depleted of hydrogen it contracts and heats up so that hydrogen starts to fuse in a shell around the core. The portion of the star outside the shell expands and cools, but with only a small increase in luminosity, and the star becomes a subgiant. The inert helium core continues to grow and increase in temperature as it accretes helium from the shell, but in stars up to about it does not become hot enough to start helium burning (higher-mass stars are supergiants and evolve differently). Instead, after just a few million years the core reaches the Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit, rapidly collapses, and may become degenerate. This causes the outer layers to expand even further and generates a strong convective zone that brings heavy elements to the surface in a process called the first dredge-up. This strong convection also increases the transport of energy to the surface, the luminosity increases dramatically, and the star moves onto the red-giant branch where it will stably burn hydrogen in a shell for a substantial fraction of its entire life (roughly 10% for a Sun-like star). The core continues to gain mass, contract, and increase in temperature, whereas there is some mass loss in the outer layers., § 5.9.

If the star&#x27;s mass, when on the main sequence, was below approximately , it will never reach the central temperatures necessary to fuse helium., p. 169. It will therefore remain a hydrogen-fusing red giant until it runs out of hydrogen, at which point it will become a helium white dwarf., § 4.1, 6.1. According to stellar evolution theory, no star of such low mass can have evolved to that stage within the age of the Universe.

In stars above about the core temperature eventually reaches 108 K and helium will begin to fuse to carbon and oxygen in the core by the triple-alpha process.,§ 5.9, chapter 6. When the core is degenerate helium fusion begins explosively, but most of the energy goes into lifting the degeneracy and the core becomes convective. The energy generated by helium fusion reduces the pressure in the surrounding hydrogen-burning shell, which reduces its energy-generation rate. The overall luminosity of the star decreases, its outer envelope contracts again, and the star moves from the red-giant branch to the horizontal branch., chapter 6.

When the core helium is exhausted, a star with up to about has a carbon–oxygen core that becomes degenerate and starts helium burning in a shell. As with the earlier collapse of the helium core, this starts convection in the outer layers, triggers a second dredge-up, and causes a dramatic increase in size and luminosity. This is the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) analogous to the red-giant branch but more luminous, with a hydrogen-burning shell contributing most of the energy. Stars only remain on the AGB for around a million years, becoming increasingly unstable until they exhaust their fuel, go through a planetary nebula phase, and then become a carbon–oxygen white dwarf., § 7.1–7.4.

===High-mass stars===
Main-sequence stars with masses above about are already very luminous and they move horizontally across the HR diagram when they leave the main sequence, briefly becoming blue giants before they expand further into blue supergiants. They start core-helium burning before the core becomes degenerate and develop smoothly into red supergiants without a strong increase in luminosity. At this stage they have comparable luminosities to bright AGB stars although they have much higher masses, but will further increase in luminosity as they burn heavier elements and eventually become a supernova.

Stars in the range have somewhat intermediate properties and have been called super-AGB stars. They largely follow the tracks of lighter stars through RGB, HB, and AGB phases, but are massive enough to initiate core carbon burning and even some neon burning. They form oxygen–magnesium–neon cores, which may collapse in an electron-capture supernova, or they may leave behind an oxygen–neon white dwarf.

O class main sequence stars are already highly luminous. The giant phase for such stars is a brief phase of slightly increased size and luminosity before developing a supergiant spectral luminosity class. Type O giants may be more than a hundred thousand times as luminous as the sun, brighter than many supergiants. Classification is complex and difficult with small differences between luminosity classes and a continuous range of intermediate forms. The most massive stars develop giant or supergiant spectral features while still burning hydrogen in their cores, due to mixing of heavy elements to the surface and high luminosity which produces a powerful stellar wind and causes the star&#x27;s atmosphere to expand.

===Low-mass stars===
A star whose initial mass is less than approximately will not become a giant star at all. For most of their lifetimes, such stars have their interior thoroughly mixed by convection and so they can continue fusing hydrogen for a time in excess of years, much longer than the current age of the Universe. They steadily become hotter and more luminous throughout this time. Eventually they do develop a radiative core, subsequently exhausting hydrogen in the core and burning hydrogen in a shell surrounding the core. (Stars with a mass in excess of may expand at this point, but will never become very large.) Shortly thereafter, the star&#x27;s supply of hydrogen will be completely exhausted and it is expected to become a helium white dwarf, although the universe is too young for any such star to exist yet, so no star with that history has ever been observed.

==Subclasses==
There are a wide range of giant-class stars and several subdivisions are commonly used to identify smaller groups of stars.

===Subgiants===

Subgiants are an entirely separate spectroscopic luminosity class (IV) from giants, but share many features with them. Although some subgiants are simply over-luminous main-sequence stars due to chemical variation or age, others are a distinct evolutionary track towards true giants.

Examples:
* Gamma Geminorum (γ Gem), an A-type subgiant;
* Eta Bootis (η Boo), a G-type subgiant.
* Delta Scorpii (δ Sco), a B-type subgiant.

===Bright giants===
Bright giants are stars of luminosity class II in the Yerkes spectral classification. These are stars which straddle the boundary between ordinary giants and supergiants, based on the appearance of their spectra. The bright giant luminosity class was first defined in 1943.

Well known stars which are classified as bright giants include:
* Canopus
* Albireo
* Theta Scorpii
* Beta Draconis
* Alpha Herculis
* Gamma Canis Majoris

===Red giants===

Within any giant luminosity class, the cooler stars of spectral class K, M, S, and C, (and sometimes some G-type stars) are called red giants. Red giants include stars in a number of distinct evolutionary phases of their lives: a main red-giant branch (RGB); a red horizontal branch or red clump; the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), although AGB stars are often large enough and luminous enough to get classified as supergiants; and sometimes other large cool stars such as immediate post-AGB stars. The RGB stars are by far the most common type of giant star due to their moderate mass, relatively long stable lives, and luminosity. They are the most obvious grouping of stars after the main sequence on most HR diagrams, although white dwarfs are more numerous but far less luminous.

Examples:
* Pollux, a K-type giant.
* Epsilon Ophiuchi, a G-type red giant.
* Arcturus (α Boötis), a K-type giant.
* Aldebaran, a K-type giant
* R Doradus, a M-type giant.
* Mira (ο Ceti), an M-type giant and prototype Mira variable.
* Chi Cygni, a S-type giant.
* TX Piscium, a C-type giant (carbon star).

===Yellow giants===
Giant stars with intermediate temperatures (spectral class G, F, and at least some A) are called yellow giants. They are far less numerous than red giants, partly because they only form from stars with somewhat higher masses, and partly because they spend less time in that phase of their lives. However, they include a number of important classes of variable stars. High-luminosity yellow stars are generally unstable, leading to the instability strip on the HR diagram where the majority of stars are pulsating variables. The instability strip reaches from the main sequence up to hypergiant luminosities, but at the luminosities of giants there are several classes of pulsating variable stars:
*RR Lyrae variables, pulsating horizontal-branch class A (sometimes F) stars with periods less than a day and amplitudes of a magnitude of less;
*W Virginis variables, more-luminous pulsating variables also known as type II Cepheids, with periods of 10–20 days;
*Type I Cepheid variables, more luminous still and mostly supergiants, with even longer periods;
*Delta Scuti variables, includes subgiant and main-sequence stars.

Yellow giants may be moderate-mass stars evolving for the first time towards the red-giant branch, or they may be more evolved stars on the horizontal branch. Evolution towards the red-giant branch for the first time is very rapid, whereas stars can spend much longer on the horizontal branch. Horizontal-branch stars, with more heavy elements and lower mass, are more unstable.

Examples:
* Sigma Octantis (σ Octantis), an F-type giant and a Delta Scuti variable;
* Capella Aa (α Aurigae Aa), a G-type giant.
* Beta Corvi (β Corvi), a G-type bright giant.

===Blue (and sometimes white) giants===

The hottest giants, of spectral classes O, B, and sometimes early A, are called blue giants. Sometimes A- and late-B-type stars may be referred to as white giants due to higher B-Vs (see for K to B-V to RGB).

The blue giants are a very heterogeneous grouping, ranging from high-mass, high-luminosity stars just leaving the main sequence to low-mass, horizontal-branch stars. Higher-mass stars leave the main sequence to become blue giants, then bright blue giants, and then blue supergiants, before expanding into red supergiants, although at the very highest masses the giant stage is so brief and narrow that it can hardly be distinguished from a blue supergiant.

Lower-mass, core-helium-burning stars evolve from red giants along the horizontal branch and then back again to the asymptotic giant branch, and depending on mass and metallicity they can become blue giants. It is thought that some post-AGB stars experiencing a late thermal pulse can become peculiar blue giants.

Examples:
* Meissa (λ Orionis A), an O-type giant.
* Alcyone (η Tauri), a B-type giant, the brightest star in the Pleiades;
* Thuban (α Draconis), an A-type giant.

<doc id="568730" wikidata="Q5500854" url="?curid=568730" title="Freedomland U.S.A.">
<text>Freedomland U.S.A. (often shortened to Freedomland) was a theme park dedicated to American history in the Baychester section of the North Bronx in New York City, United States. Freedomland was built on marshland owned by the Webb and Knapp company, of which William Zeckendorf Sr. was the major owner. Zeckendorf announced his plans for Freedomland in May 1959. The park, conceived and built by C. V. Wood, consisted of over 40 attractions arranged in the shape of a large map of the contiguous United States. Groundbreaking ceremonies for Freedomland occurred in late 1959, and Freedomland opened to large crowds on June 19, 1960.

Because of Freedomland&#x27;s $65 million construction cost, the park faced financial issues; by the end of the 1961 season, Freedomland had $8 million in debt. To generate revenue, the park added more exhibits and conventional amusements. By 1963, further financial issues led the owners to sell off a portion of Freedomland&#x27;s site to a pension fund of the Teamsters, as well as close off a section of the park. Even though Freedomland&#x27;s planners anticipated that the park would eventually be developed into a full-time amusement area, Freedomland closed permanently at the end of the 1964 season, filing for bankruptcy on September 14, 1964.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, part of the Freedomland site was redeveloped as Co-op City, the world&#x27;s largest co-op housing development. The Bay Plaza Shopping Center was built on another part of the site. Many Freedomland attractions and design features were auctioned or sold to other parks, and many of these rides no longer exist. While little physical evidence of Freedomland remains, several media works commemorate the former amusement park.

==Creation==
Freedomland was conceived and built by C. V. Wood, a Texan who had worked in the planning, construction, and management of Disneyland, which opened in Anaheim, California, in 1955. After Disneyland&#x27;s opening, Wood&#x27;s relationship with the Disney brothers became strained because of various disputes, and he was ousted from Disneyland management by early 1956. He soon became involved in the creation of other amusement parks across the United States under his company Marco Engineering. Wood had devised plans for an American-history theme park as early as 1957, in conjunction with Milton Ted Raynor, who later became president of Freedomland Inc. The new theme park would be themed entirely around American history, in a more historically accurate version of the Disneyland layout, which initially included four distinct areas: Adventureland, Tomorrowland, Fantasyland, and Frontierland.

=== Site ===

Two consultants at Marco Engineering performed a feasibility study for the location of Wood&#x27;s proposed American-history theme park. By late 1958, Wood had pitched his American-history park concept to the Webb and Knapp development company. Early the next year, a site was selected: a portion of a plot owned by Webb and Knapp in the northeast Bronx section of New York City. The site, in the Baychester neighborhood, was a former municipal landfill, originally marshland fed by Rattlesnake Creek and the Hutchinson River. This led to a profusion of mosquitoes during certain periods of the year.

The International Recreation Corporation (IRC) was incorporated in Boston in April 1959 to oversee development of the proposed park. Webb and Knapp&#x27;s principal owner, William Zeckendorf, announced the plans for Freedomland on April 30, 1959. National Development Corporation (NDC), a Webb and Knapp subsidiary, as well as Freedomland Inc., an IRC subsidiary, were created to operate and manage the theme park. Wood and IRC president Peter De Met announced further details of the proposed park at a press conference that May. According to Wood and De Met, the park was to cover and would have space for up to 32,000 visitors. About would be developed for the park itself, and would house parking, maintenance areas, and other service areas. There would also be a 12,000-spot parking lot and a 600-room motel.

In mid-1959, Freedomland Inc. leased the site for 50 years. IRC issued about one million shares, which were then sold to NDC and Freedomland Inc. The IRC offered 580,000 shares to the public in July 1959, priced at $17.50 per share, and the stock offering was quickly oversubscribed. This raised $17 million for the park. Under the terms of the lease agreement, the park was to pay an annual rent of $600,000 for the first five years, $750,000 for the next ten years, and $1 million thereafter. Wood presented further details for the park to Zeckendorf and his son William Zeckendorf Jr. later the same year.

=== Construction ===
A groundbreaking ceremony for Freedomland was initially planned for July 4, 1959, coinciding with Independence Day. Ultimately, the ceremony occurred on August 26, 1959. The ceremony featured a helicopter ride over the premises for the park&#x27;s backers, as well as a special New York City Subway train for attendees. The festivities also included performances from cowboys and showgirls; the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts; performances from costumed actors; and a musical number from New York City Department of Sanitation&#x27;s 60-piece band. Fifty bulldozers, representing every U.S. state, were exhibited at the groundbreaking ceremony. Despite these lavish preparations, only 19 members of the public attended the ceremony, in addition to sponsors and performers.

Over the next months, more than 2,000 workers were hired, mostly by the two major contractors, Turner Construction and Aberthaw Construction. Work was completed within just under 300 days. Some of land were excavated to create of canals. Land was raised by up to to create the park&#x27;s natural-looking features. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine reported that the park was to have between 33 and 35 rides on opening day, as well as more than 80 commercial tenants who funded the construction of their own attractions. Major contractors were hired to furnish the props and attractions, including flat-ride manufacturer Arrow Dynamics, souvenir manufacturer Enco National Corporation, concessionaire The Brass Rail, and sternwheeler manufacturer Todd Shipyards. Frederic V. Schumacher was hired as the park&#x27;s general manager in September 1959. In addition, Ellington and Co. was hired to manage advertising for the park, Sylvester Weaver Jr. oversaw radio and television coverage of the park, while Douglas Leigh was hired as the park&#x27;s lighting consultant. Allen Hixon was hired in early 1960 to design the park&#x27;s layout.

The construction contractors had finished the foundations of 15 structures by November 1959. The park&#x27;s construction was facilitated by mild weather during the winter of 1959–1960, and forty-two buildings were in various states of completion by February 1960. On March 24, six small unfinished buildings were destroyed by fire and were razed; this did not affect progress on the rest of the park. The burned structures were reused as props for Freedomland&#x27;s Chicago Fire attraction. Freedomland&#x27;s opening was originally set for June 1, 1960. Advertising agent Edward Weiner wished to invite politicians such as the administration of U.S. president Dwight D. Eisenhower; all members of the U.S. Congress; the governors of all 50 U.S. states; and United Nations delegates to the park&#x27;s opening. The opening was postponed to July 1 so the park could be ready for the expected crowds, then rescheduled again to June 18 due to high excitement generated by the marketing campaign. Journalists were invited to preview the park on April 28, 1960. By that May, the park&#x27;s managers were so confident of the park&#x27;s June 18 opening date that they had arranged for the popular TV series &quot;The&quot; &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot; to be broadcast from there on that date.

===Opening===
When announced, Freedomland was supposed to cost $15.5 million, funded by Freedomland Inc.&#x27;s stock issues. The final cost was significantly higher, at $65 million; the land was valued at $30 million and the scenery another $33 million. The eateries comprised another $1 million of the cost. The actual theme park consisted of of the 205-acre site leased by the IRC. Prior to opening day, Freedomland launched an aggressive advertising campaign. The first phase, targeting the 10 million people living within of New York City, consisted of daily advertisements in the city&#x27;s newspapers, radio and TV stations, and subway cars. Advertisements were found as far away as from the Bronx, and several contests and promotions for Freedomland were held in the greater New York City area. Several taglines were devised to advertise Freedomland, including &quot;The World&#x27;s Newest and Largest Outdoor Entertainment Center&quot;, &quot;The World&#x27;s Largest Entertainment Center&quot;, &quot;The World&#x27;s Largest Family Entertainment Center&quot;, and &quot;The World&#x27;s Largest Outdoor Entertainment Center&quot;. Marketers also used the generic slogan &quot;A World of Fun for Everyone&quot;, but they discarded another tagline, &quot;Freedomland is fifty states of happiness!&quot;. A promotional jingle was also developed for Freedomland.

On June 18, 1960, Freedomland was dedicated with a ceremony in front of the Chicago-themed railroad station. About 25,000 people attended the dedication, which raised funds for local youth programs. The following day, June 19, the park officially opened. To draw more visitors, Freedomland started a second advertising campaign on that day, targeting ten major populated areas within a radius of . People lined up to get into the park two and a half hours before its official 9:00 a.m. opening. Pat Boone cut the ribbon at 8:30 a.m. By noon, radio announcers were warning people not to go to Freedomland; the parking lot was full, and visitors were reportedly parking on side streets up to from the main gate. By 2:05 p.m., Freedomland stopped selling tickets due to traffic jams on highways and local roads leading to the park. Ultimately, the park recorded 61,500 visitors, one-third less than the expected maximum capacity, and closed at 9:00 p.m., three hours before its intended closing.

On opening day, one security guard was quoted as saying that the drinking fountains were non-functional, the restrooms were few and far between, the concessionaires were poorly equipped for operation, and many exhibits were not yet painted or decorated. The park had a much smaller crowd on its second day of operation when it had an average of 15,000 visitors throughout the day. Satellite City and the Chicago Fire were not operational until a few weeks after opening day, the former due to &quot;electrical difficulties&quot;. In total, Freedomland was only 85 percent complete at the time of its opening. Parts of the original proposal, such as a Freedomland Inn and a movie studio, were never completed.

Admission was initially $1.00 for adults, 75 cents for those aged 12 to 17, and 50 cents for those under 12. Members of the United States Armed Forces also paid 75 cents. The admission fee only covered entry to the park; each of the 35 rides had an additional surcharge of 10 to 50 cents. Patrons could also buy coupon books for nine rides, which cost between $2.50 and $3.50. At some point during the first season, adult admission was increased to $1.50.

==Areas and attractions==

Under Wood&#x27;s leadership, Freedomland&#x27;s designers created a history-themed concept, divided into seven themed areas based on the history of the United States. Each section featured attractions, shops, and restaurants fitting that section&#x27;s theme. The layout resembled a large map of the contiguous United States and was designed like a movie set. As guests entered from the parking lot, they walked into Little Old New York of the 1890s. Baychester Avenue and the New England Thruway at the park&#x27;s western edge approximately represented Freedomland&#x27;s border with Canada. The designers added decor such as vintage building advertisements and a night-lighting system. Freedomland&#x27;s attractions on opening day were significantly different from what had originally been planned. Of the 16 areas and attractions announced in an August 1959 press release, 12 were operating on opening day, some of which were themed to a completely different time span than in the original plan. As conceived, the park also focused on history from a narrow era, between roughly 1850 and 1900, rather than a larger period.

The park could accommodate up to 32,000 visitors at once or 90,000 visitors per day. The premises included of navigable waterways and lakes, 10,000 newly planted trees, more than 18 restaurants and snack bars, and parking for 7,200 cars for guests and 1,800 for employees. The park also included 35,000 shrubs. Freedomland&#x27;s operators also acquired 80 burros, 200 horses, six stagecoaches, canoes, and saddles to make the park seem more realistic. At Freedomland&#x27;s opening, there were 41 attractions, as well as performances reenacted by over 2,000 cast members. The park also had its own fire department, as well as a dedicated police department with 110 officers. Performance programs were designed to be interactive: for instance, children were enlisted to participate in fighting a reenacted Great Chicago Fire. Freedomland hosted a competition for its official hostess, &quot;Miss Freedomland&quot;, every season; according to the &quot;New York Amsterdam News&quot;, these hostesses &quot;have gone on to lucrative careers in fashion and television modeling&quot;.

None of the rides on opening day were traditional amusement park attractions such as roller coasters. As attendance failed to meet the operators&#x27; expectations, generic fairground attractions were added to the park in subsequent opening seasons, and the park had 45 rides and over 200 programs by 1962. As at Disneyland, many of Freedomland&#x27;s attractions received corporate sponsorships, and alcoholic beverages were banned in Freedomland.

=== Transportation ===
The site was accessible from the rest of the city via the New York City Subway&#x27;s Pelham Bay Park station, served by the , and the Gun Hill Road station, served by the . Furthermore, the presence of several highways, such as the New England Thruway, made the site accessible from the surrounding New York metropolitan area, whose population exceeded 10 million. Express bus service ran to Manhattan and the Pelham Bay Park and Gun Hill Road subway stations. For the wealthy, Flotair operated a seaplane service that could reach Manhattan in five minutes.

==== Intra-park transport ====
Freedomland U.S.A. had a railroad and an aerial lift ride carrying passengers between different parts of the park. The narrow gauge Santa Fe Railroad traveled between the park&#x27;s Chicago and San Francisco areas. The ride was approximately six minutes long and consisted of a loop stretching about . The park leased two locomotives named Monson No. 3 and Monson No. 4, as well as passenger coaches and flatbeds, from the Edaville Railroad in Massachusetts; the rolling stock was transported back to the Edaville Railroad via truck between seasons.

A two-passenger double Von Roll (VR101) sky ride, the Tucson Mining Company Sky Ride, traveled between the Old Southwest and Old Chicago sections of the park. The ride used gondolas manufactured by Gangloff Cabins, supposedly obtained from the 1958 Brussels World&#x27;s Fair, and designed as replicas of ore cars. Sixty-four gondolas were used. The attraction was the company&#x27;s first Double Von Roll 101 sky ride. The attraction contained two extended cables, although guests perceived these as four cables, two traveling in each direction. For the 1960 and 1961 seasons, the sky ride was a round trip only, but starting in 1962, guests could board at Chicago.

===Little Old New York (1850–1900)===
The Little Old New York section, at the north end of the park, was closest to the main entrance and contained an information booth, stroller rental, and lockers. It depicted New York City as it appeared in the late 19th century. Attractions included:

Restaurants and refreshments included Borden&#x27;s Old Fashioned Ice Cream Parlor; F&amp;M Schaefer Brewery, an old-fashioned brewery sponsored by Schaefer Beer; Kandy King Candy Shop; Lipton&#x27;s Inn and Lipton&#x27;s Tea House; New York Coffee House; and Welch&#x27;s Grape Juice Bar, a beverage bar located near the New England vineyard.
Shops included a print shop to purchase vintage-style posters, an apothecary shop, a glass blower shop, and other stores. Unlike Disneyland, where the shops were connected to each other, the stores were generally separated internally, like actual shops on city streets. Macy&#x27;s recreated its original Manhattan store, Macy&#x27;s Herald Square. There was also a live street show that included a German band, an 1880s Tammany Hall speech, a political pep rally, campaigning suffragettes, and a New York gangland robbery of the Little Old New York Bank.

===Old Chicago (1871)===
The Old Chicago section was located on the park&#x27;s western border, south of Old New York. One of the main geographical features of Old Chicago was an imitation of the Great Lakes. This water body was deep, covered a surface area of , and could hold .

Attractions included:

Restaurants and refreshments included the Brass Rail Stockyards Restaurant, a steak restaurant. This was the largest restaurant in Freedomland with over 300 seats. Shops included the Hallmark Card Shop, a store that sold souvenir postcards, which also served as Freedomland&#x27;s communication center. There was also the Relic Shop, a souvenir shop located near the Chicago Fire attraction.

===The Great Plains (1803–1900)===
The Great Plains section was located south of Old Chicago. Attractions included:

Restaurants and refreshments included Borden&#x27;s Milk Bar, a beverage bar, and Chuck Wagon Snack Stand, a snack bar.

===San Francisco (1906)===
The San Francisco section was located at the south end of the park. Attractions included:

Restaurants and refreshments included Chun-King Shangri-La Restaurant, located in the replica Chinatown, and Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf, a snack stand with an actor dressed as an old salt seaman telling stories. A&amp;W Root Beer, an exhibit and restaurant sponsored by A&amp;W Root Beer, operated only from 1962 to 1964. Shops included a souvenir shop called Indian Trading Post
and an Italian restaurant with attached gift shop.

===The Old Southwest (1890)===
The Old Southwest section was located on the eastern border of the park, north of Old San Francisco. Attractions included:

Restaurants and refreshments included a Mexican restaurant called Libby&#x27;s Hacienda, or Libby&#x27;s Frito House, which served quick service meals, along with several &quot;specials&quot; that included Fritos. There was also the Santa Fe Opera House and Saloon, a soft drink bar that featured a 30-minute stage show with a four-piece band, showgirls, singers and comedians. Some of New York City&#x27;s radio disc jockeys and program hosts would broadcast from the stage. There were two souvenir shops: the Mexican Market and the Western Trading Post.

===New Orleans – Mardi Gras===
The New Orleans – Mardi Gras section was located north of the Old Southwest. Attractions included:

Restaurants and refreshments included Jesse Jewell Plantation House Restaurant, a food-service area that served fried chicken. There was also the Mardi Gras Sidewalk Cafe and the Jolly Roger snack area. Shops included the Carousel Toy Shop, next to the King Rex Carrousel.

===Satellite City – The Future===
The Satellite City – The Future section was located at the southeast section of the park. Attractions included:

Restaurants and refreshments included the Satellite City Snack Bar, as well as a Coca-Cola soft-drink bar.

===Unbuilt areas and attractions===
There were several unbuilt areas and attractions. One area near New Orleans and Satellite City would have recreated the Florida peninsula. Plans were also drawn up for a replica of a Hollywood set located near San Francisco. An expansion of the New England section would have included a commemoration of the Battle of Bunker Hill, a fishing village, and a Plymouth Rock recreation.

In addition, the developers planned to build the Freedomland Inn just south of the park, with between 300 and 600 rooms. Architect William B. Tabler was hired to design the inn, which would have been directly south of the park, and contained amenities such as a wading pool, an Olympic-size swimming pool, a restaurant, and a coffee shop. Ultimately, only a foundation slab was developed; upon the park&#x27;s eventual demise, some props were dumped over the slab and used as landfill.

==Operation==

=== 1960 season ===

Due to Freedomland&#x27;s high construction costs, it was $7 million in debt on its opening day, leading commenters to describe it as a &quot;gamble&quot;. Schumacher hoped that Freedomland would be as large a New York City icon as Central Park or the Statue of Liberty. Although optimistic projections called for up to 5 million visitors a year, Freedomland would have needed to see two million visitors in its first season in order to break even. Toward the end of the season, first-year visitation projections were decreased from 4.8 million to 1.7 million; the park ultimately saw 1.5 million visitors, a statistic that was never surpassed in subsequent seasons. For the 1960 operating season, Freedomland was open seven days a week until September 18, when its operating hours were cut to weekends only for the rest of the season. Freedomland&#x27;s managers had planned to operate the park from May 15 to October 15 of each year. The last operating day of the 1960 season was at the end of October.

On August 28, 1960, three armed men stole the day&#x27;s receipts of over $28,000; most of the money was recovered when the thieves, identified as employees, were arrested two weeks later. At the end of that September, local news media reported that Freedomland had failed to pay the city a 5% amusement tax totaling $148,200. The tax was paid by the following week. The 1960 season was also marked by several incidents involving patron injuries. On June 25, 1960, days after the grand opening, a horse-drawn stagecoach overturned in the Great Plains section of the park and injured 10 people. Another incident occurred on October 24, 1960, when a children&#x27;s train ride overturned and injured two boys. Meanwhile, Turner Construction and Aberthaw Construction filed a $3.648 million mechanic&#x27;s lien on the park in November 1960.

The various lawsuits and liens left the park in debt. During the 1960 season, Webb and Knapp bought a 40% share in the project, only for the stock to drop by almost two-thirds, from $17.50 to $6.25 a share. At one point, local merchants refused to accept checks that Freedomland had issued. By that August, Raynor and Wood had resigned from the park&#x27;s operation, and Zeckendorf hired two men to replace them. Zeckendorf also hired Art K. Moss, a marketing expert, who cut costs by decreasing the $150,000 weekly payroll by 20% and forbidding employees from collecting overtime. To raise money for the park, Zeckendorf proposed selling his leaseholds on three hotels in Midtown Manhattan (the Astor, Commodore, and Manhattan hotels) to the IRC. Webb and Knapp also considered developing a shopping center along Freedomland&#x27;s periphery, and they started constructing the proposed motel during the 1960–1961 off-season.

=== 1961 season ===
At the end of the 1960 season, park operators initially predicted that the park would reopen in May 1961. The reopening date was postponed by one month. Freedomland continued to experience financial troubles: before the beginning of the 1961 season, it was $8 million in debt. This led the IRC to propose that Zeckendorf sell the leaseholds on several Manhattan hotels to Freedomland Inc. in exchange for a $16.35 million mortgage note. As part of the plan, Webb and Knapp would give the park a $3 million cash loan, and it would purchase the lien that the construction contractors had placed on the park. This plan was approved in June 1961, just prior to the start of the park&#x27;s second season. Zeckendorf also unsuccessfully attempted a merger with Yonkers Raceway &amp; Empire City Casino. Yonkers Raceway&#x27;s owners declined, though the IRC did purchase a controlling interest in the raceway that October.

The park reopened on June 10, 1961. Admission fees were raised to $2.95 for a park-wide entrance ticket, and pay-per-ride admission was abolished. To entice visitors, Freedomland started to add more traditional amusement rides, such as the Moon Bowl dance floor, as well as expanded its schedule of performances. The new attractions included a live show called Colossus; in total, the park had 164 events and attractions for the 1961 season. The Freedomland Inn, which had been planned to open in the park&#x27;s second season, had not started construction. During the 1961 season, over 1.7 million visitors entered Freedomland. The park still had a myriad of issues: for instance, to satiate employees&#x27; demands for pay raises, the security budget was decreased, which resulted in people sneaking into the park without an admission ticket. To combat the park&#x27;s declining reputation, Moss announced that taxicab drivers of New York City and their families would be able to enter Freedomland for free. According to a study conducted by park management, visitors stayed for an average of 7 hours and 48 minutes during the 1961 season.

=== 1962 season ===
By 1962, it cost $1 million per year to maintain the park during the off-season. Prior to the 1962 season, Freedomland spent $1 million to add and expand its offerings. The improvements included a 5,000-seat arena and a midway-themed area with children&#x27;s rides, as well as the Astro-Ride roller coaster and a Wiggly-Worm caterpillar ride. The 1962 season started on May 27 of that year. It was open weekends only for the first month, expanding its schedule to seven days a week in late June. Freedomland charged $3.50 admission during the 1962 season. After implementing a system of portable radios, the park laid off 700 of its 3,000 workers during that season. Additionally, visitors who entered after 6 p.m. were charged a reduced price of $2.50. The park also offered concerts, which featured acts such as Louis Armstrong, the Glenn Miller Orchestra, Benny Goodman, and Paul Anka. In the long term, there were plans to make Freedomland into a year-round destination.

Following these changes, paint company Benjamin Moore &amp; Co., which sponsored an exhibit in Satellite City, sued Freedomland in September 1962, seeking $150,000 in damages. The company sought to void its lease for exhibit space, citing &quot;historical and educational&quot; changes to the park&#x27;s character. The New York Supreme Court ruled against Benjamin Moore. Concessionaires also started complaining of high rents, which had increased to , a price that many vendors could not pay with their low profits. Total admission for 1962 was estimated at 1.4 million.

=== 1963 season ===
The 1963 season started on April 21 of that year, at which point it was open weekends only until that June. Admission had been reduced to one dollar. By that time, the themes of the amusements and events had little to do with history in general, let alone American history. The events advertised at the park included a children&#x27;s zoo, puppet shows, DJ shows, clown performances, and circus parades. The Meteor single-rail coaster, bumper cars, side shows, a wax display, and a reconstructed carousel from the Dentzel Carousel Company were also added during the 1963 season. As Webb and Knapp&#x27;s financial troubles increased in the 1960s, the firm placed the site of the proposed Freedomland Inn for sale at an auction in July 1963, with a minimum asking price of $2 million. The site, covering , did not garner any bids. Zeckendorf also sold off adjacent plots of land. The park closed for the season on September 29, 1963.

In total, Freedomland earned a combined $3 million from admissions during the 1962 and 1963 seasons. However, Freedomland still had a large amount of debt. Webb and Knapp faced serious financial troubles of its own, in part because of declining revenues from its hotels, prompting the firm to write off its entire investment in Freedomland in 1963. The company also sought to sell its lease of the land. That December, Zeckendorf obtained a $25 million mortgage loan from a pension fund of the Teamsters Union. Zeckendorf secured the loan by giving the Teamsters Union his lease of the park&#x27;s site, an adjacent plot in Baychester, and a development in Dunedin Beach, Florida. This resolved the park&#x27;s short-term debt. Zeckendorf was also considering ways to keep Freedomland open year-round, proposing ideas such as a ski slope, a horse-racing track, a bowling alley, and a series of Christmas events.

=== 1964 season ===
Freedomland&#x27;s fifth operating season began on May 16, 1964, with the park operating only on weekends until June. In advance of the 1964 season, the park&#x27;s operators added a haunted castle attraction. By then, the San Francisco-themed area already had been walled off. For several months prior to the start of the 1964 season, there were rumors that Freedomland would be moved to Florida, where it could operate year-round. Staff members were also told that only Little Old New York, Old Chicago, and Satellite City might be open for 1965, while the rest of the park would be redeveloped. That July, Freedomland stopped booking rock-and-roll bands and started hiring big bands.

In July 1964, the IRC acquired Webb and Knapp&#x27;s stake in Freedomland Inc. National Development Corporation president Hyman Green, who owned 20 percent of the NDC, bought the remaining 80 percent stake from Zeckendorf. The transactions were intended to reduce Webb and Knapp&#x27;s large debt, which it had incurred after writing off $17.9 million in investments in IRC and Freedomland Inc. At the time, Green said he expected Freedomland to make a profit during the 1964 season, even as it had lost money year-to-date. Zeckendorf later said that Webb and Knapp&#x27;s involvement in Freedomland &quot;hurt the financial position of Webb and Knapp more than anything we&#x27;ve ever done.&quot; Toward the end of the 1964 operating season, Freedomland was expected to reopen the next year, even though it had only earned $738,000 from admissions. In an indication of its deep financial troubles, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Freedomland Inc. had paid its employees with bad checks totaling $60,000.

== Demise ==

=== Bankruptcy ===

On September 13, 1964, Freedomland closed for the season. Within three days, Freedomland Inc. had filed for bankruptcy. At the time, Freedomland Inc.&#x27;s liabilities were $27 million, about three times its $9 million in assets. The largest creditors, in order, were the IRC, the NDC, Zeckendorf, and the Internal Revenue Service. The bankruptcy filing nearly caused the collapse of the Teamsters Union, which held the mortgage on the property. Freedomland had never earned a net profit in each of its five operating seasons; if it were downsized , Freedomland estimated that it could make a $25,000 profit if it were to reopen in 1965. Freedomland never reopened, and its attractions, buildings, and other features were auctioned and sold during 1965.

==== Causes ====
Freedomland Inc.&#x27;s bankruptcy filings cited competition from the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair as a direct reason for the park&#x27;s closure. The author Michael Virgintino wrote that the World&#x27;s Fair was unlikely to be the main reason for Freedomland&#x27;s bankruptcy, as the World&#x27;s Fair had been announced in 1959, and many of the fair&#x27;s visitors only attended that event a few times. Furthermore, the World&#x27;s Fair had recorded a financial loss in 1964, and several amusement attractions at the fair had gone bankrupt during that year. This was part of a decline in New York City&#x27;s amusement industry in general, as the city&#x27;s traditional amusement area of Coney Island had declined simultaneously.

Several factors contributed to Freedomland&#x27;s failure. First, it only operated seasonally, thus reducing potential income; this contrasted with Disneyland, which operated year-round. Freedomland was only open for three or four months a year, so its capacity was much lower than Disneyland&#x27;s, which had 6 million guests in 1964. Second, the marshland was unstable and contributed to damage to many of the structures, requiring additional repair costs. A third factor was Freedomland&#x27;s weak sense of identity, as people wishing for more traditional attractions could go to other places like Coney Island or Rye Playland. The park&#x27;s failure may also have been exacerbated by the fact that Webb and Knapp had acquired too many assets, such as hotels, which had also struggled financially in the early 1960s.

Freedomland may not have been intended to last long from the outset. William Zeckendorf said in 1970 that Freedomland was a &quot;placeholder&quot; to obtain land variances to permit more lucrative residential and commercial development of the marshland; the durability of the amusement structures obviated the need to undergo a proper monitoring period of 15 to 20 years.

=== Redevelopment ===
The NDC indicated in 1965 that it would sell about of its holdings in the northeast Bronx to the United Housing Foundation. In February 1965, the United Housing Foundation announced plans for the Co-op City development, a 15,500-unit housing cooperative, on the site. Even as these plans were announced, Freedomland was still negotiating to operate 30 acres adjacent to Co-op City. The New York City Planning Commission approved these plans in May 1965, with no provisions for an amusement park. By early the next year, most remaining portions of Freedomland were destroyed. Co-op City was constructed on Freedomland&#x27;s parking lot and the Little Old New York and Satellite City areas during the late 1960s, and the first residents began moving to the area in 1968. The construction of Co-op City contributed to large areas of salt marsh degradation, exacerbating a process that had started when Freedomland was built.

The rest of the park remained decrepit and undeveloped through the 1970s, and some of the park&#x27;s abandoned buildings remained on site. During the early 1980s, Bay Plaza Shopping Center was constructed on the land occupied by five additional park areas. Another proposal during the late 20th century, which called for light industrial development on the Freedomland site, failed when the developer could not obtain funding. Subsequently, Prestige Properties and Development Company proposed redeveloping part of the site as a commercial and office complex in 1990, following the completion of the adjacent Bay Plaza. A small part of the Freedomland development—a tract at the convergence of the New England Thruway and Hutchinson River Parkway, which had been intended for the Freedomland Inn—remained undeveloped until 2012, when an expansion of Bay Plaza Shopping Center opened at the site.

== Reception ==
The areas were not historically or geographically accurate, and they primarily depicted events from the late 19th century. A writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that the themed lands were &quot;perhaps not quite acceptable to the Geodetic Survey because so many dull places have been left out&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot; magazine called the park &quot;nothing less than a replica of the continental U.S.A., 833 yds from parkway to shining parkway&quot;. Furthermore, most of the attractions were themed on the American frontier, a factor influenced by Wood&#x27;s and Raynor&#x27;s respective upbringings in Texas and Chicago, as well as Zeckendorf&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s adventures in Arizona Territory. This led writer Paul D. Naish to state, &quot;The photographed streetscapes at Freedomland have a distinctly generic quality.&quot; Walt Disney said of the park in 1961: &quot;I think it was wrong from the start.&quot;

Freedomland generally received negative attention from members of the media. For instance, at the groundbreaking ceremony, writer Gay Talese observed that the park, characterized by its backers as the future &quot;&#x27;greatest outdoor entertainment center in the history of man&#x27;&quot;, was to be built on such a &quot;vast wasteland&quot;. Historian Walter Muir Whitehill described Freedomland as an operation with a &quot;veneer of pseudo history&quot; whose main purpose was to make money. &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote of the simulated attractions in the park, which included &quot;an electromagnetic dragon [and] real buffalo grazing the prairies&quot;, as well as so-called &quot;birch-bark Chippewa war canoes&quot; that were actually fiberglass Cherokee ships. However, the magazine also stated that the public did not initially seem to mind these false representations. By contrast, a reporter for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote in 1962 that &quot;the Bronx is cheering&quot; for Freedomland, even though &quot;there is very little to cheer about in the Bronx&quot;.

Soon after the park&#x27;s opening, it also gained a negative reputation among the public: toward its final years, mention of Freedomland often provoked reactions of either &quot;ridicule or apathy&quot;. After the park closed, a &quot;Newsday&quot; writer called Freedomland a &quot;flop&quot; and said of many of the opening day visitors: &quot;They came. They saw. They left. And most never came back.&quot; According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, when Walt Disney World was being developed in central Florida in the late 1960s, some people expressed skepticism about whether Walt Disney World would be commercially successful, citing Freedomland&#x27;s quick failure.

In 1993, The Walt Disney Company proposed developing Disney&#x27;s America, an American history theme park near Manassas, Virginia. The proposal was similar to the Freedomland concept, but it was abandoned the following year after massive opposition. Russell Miller, one of the critics of Disney&#x27;s America, found that plan deficient compared to Freedomland. Miller praised Freedomland as &quot;an open-air theatre [that] promised not historical truth but national myth, infused with a spirit&quot;, while he questioned whether Disney&#x27;s America was &quot;a theme park or a bad night on PBS&quot;.

== Legacy ==

=== Site ===
In nearby neighborhoods such as Williamsbridge, motels built primarily for Freedomland remained operational, despite the death of visitor attractions in the northeast Bronx. In August 2013, a plaque commemorating the park was installed near the site of its flagpoles. During mid-2019, remnants of &quot;Totsie&quot;, one of the New York Harbor tugboats, were placed near the plaque. The remains of &quot;Totsie&quot; were donated by Rob Friedman, an unofficial archivist of Freedomland history.

A small portion of the former park site, at the northeast corner of Bartow and Baychester Avenues, remains zoned as a C7 district. Such districts are reserved &quot;for large open amusement parks&quot;; Coney Island is the only other such district in the city. The zoning district is a holdover from Freedomland&#x27;s operation. Due to its C7 zoning, the lot lacked any restrictions for the surface areas of signs located within its limits. This prompted a subsequent landowner to erect a tall billboard on the lot in 2019, although the billboard was controversial. As a result, Co-op City residents proposed changing the lot&#x27;s zoning to a standard commercial use.

===Attractions moved to other parks===

Some Freedomland attractions and design features were auctioned or sold to other parks, and many of these attractions no longer exist. The Crystal Maze, Danny the Dragon, an interior diorama of the Mine Caverns, the Tornado dark ride, and the King Rex Carrousel were moved to The Great Escape &amp; Splashwater Kingdom, when it was owned by Charles R. Wood and known as Storytown USA, in Lake George, New York. The Tornado briefly operated at Kennywood from 1962 before moving to Lake George in 1967. The Crystal Maze building was converted into a concession stand and then an administration building.

Two of the three Santa Fe Railroad stations were moved to Clark&#x27;s Trading Post (subsequently called Clark&#x27;s Bears), a family-owned park in Lincoln, New Hampshire. The park obtained Freedomland&#x27;s Chicago station and the one-room prop station based in the Old Southwest-themed area of Freedomland; it was used for the still-operating White Mountain Central Railroad. Other Freedomland items that appear at Clark&#x27;s include bricks from Little Old New York, seats from the Braniff Space Rover and street lamps from all over the park.

One of the two sternwheelers was moved to the Byram River between Greenwich, Connecticut, and Port Chester, New York, where it supposedly still serves as a restaurant. San Francisco&#x27;s Earthquake and New Orleans&#x27; Buccaneers (renamed Pirate Ride) attractions were moved to Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, in 1966; both attractions have been removed. The tugboat &quot;Totsie&quot; operated for many years at Quassy Amusement Park in Middlebury, Connecticut. Other Freedomland objects and attractions were moved to places such as Niagara Falls on the New York-Ontario border and the Magic Mountain site in Colorado. Forest Park Highlands, an amusement park in St. Louis that closed in 1963, apparently sold its Aero Jet ride to Freedomland, which in turn sold it to Knoebels Amusement Resort in Elysburg, Pennsylvania.

===Historical commemoration===
Freedomland&#x27;s history has been the subject of several books. Arcadia Publishing published two books in the &quot;Images of America&quot; series; the second book, &quot;Freedomland: 1960–1964&quot; by Robert McLaughlin, was published in 2015. A detailed book about the park&#x27;s history, &quot;Freedomland U.S.A.: The Definitive History&quot; by Michael Virgintino, was published in 2019. C. V. Wood&#x27;s life and contributions to Disneyland are recalled in the book &quot;Three Years In Wonderland&quot; (2016) by Todd James Pierce.

In 1999, a website dedicated to the history of Freedomland was set up by Friedman. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported at the time that &quot;the site quickly became a lightning rod for Freedomland enthusiasts, receiving 6 to 10 E-mail messages a week with reminiscences and offers of material for its creator&#x27;s growing collection.&quot;

<text>A plate block is a block of stamps from the edge of the sheet which shows the &quot;plate&quot; or &quot;cylinder&quot; from which the stamps were printed.

==Background==
The numbering of printing plates has long been a part of quality control in the printing process. That way, if someone at the printing plant notices a problem with the printing of a certain stamp, the plate number can be used to locate the proper plate or cylinder so the problem can be investigated. 

In some cases, for instance the Penny Reds of Great Britain and modern United States plate number coils, the plate numbers appear in the stamps themselves, but the more common practice is to include the number in the margin of each sheet, sometimes alongside the name of the printer.

On coil stamps (stamps issued in a long band of single stamps with the edges imperforate) a plate number sometimes is printed on the margin of a stamp, which collectors refer to as a plate number coil. Mint plate number coil stamps are most often collected as strips of three or five with the stamp with the plate number at the center of the strip.

==In the United Kingdom==
In the U.K. plate blocks are also commonly known as &quot;cylinder blocks&quot; and are widely collected as they still form an important part of the printing process for current British stamps.

British stamps have also included a system of &quot;controls&quot; which were first used in February 1884 and continued until 1947. The &quot;control&quot; consisted of a letter in the selvedge of the sheet and was introduced as an accounting method by the printers due to the very large number of low value definitive stamps they were printing.

==In the United States==
Until the late 1960s, United States stamps included two rows of stamps attached to one another in a block of four or more, with printing information, including the printing plate number, on attached margin paper. A number is used to identify one specific plate or cylinder used to print the stamps. 
Then plate block collecting changed in the US due to the addition of up to eight multi-digit numbers which represented different colors used to print the stamps. The numbers were printed along the selvage. This meant collectors needed many more stamps to save a single plate block. This lasted for about ten years before the post office reverted to the traditional single number for most stamps. In a press release dated Dec. 10, 1980, the postal service announced a new plate numbering system that would, except in cases where more than four designs appear on a pane, &quot;establish a plate block as consisting of four stamps regardless of the number of inks used or the press used to print the stamps.&quot; Now, new issues often begin with a number such as &quot;11111,&quot; with each digit in a different color. Stamps printed in large quantities may have multiple plate numbers so the next plate combination might be identified as &quot;22222&quot; and so on.

==Collecting==
The usual practice in plate block collecting varies by country and era; the classic 20th century US plate block consisted of a 2 x 3 block in the middle top, bottom and/or sides of the sheet for flat plate issues (a 2 x 2 block in the corner of the sheet for rotary press issues). Ambitious collectors will seek to own blocks displaying every known plate number for the stamp; specialized stamp catalogs will list these. They may also collect all of the block positions, such as the numbers of each corner that exist after a large sheet is quartered.

<doc id="568741" wikidata="Q1564327" url="?curid=568741" title="HMS Argonaut (F56)">
<text>HMS &quot;Argonaut&quot; (F56) was a that served with the Royal Navy from 1967 to 1993. She took part in the Falklands War in 1982, sustaining damage and casualties in action.

==Construction==
The ship was built at Hebburn, in Tyneside, by the Hawthorn Leslie and Company shipyard in the mid-1960s. She was launched on 8 February 1966, and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 17 August 1967.

==Service history==
===1967–1982===
In her first year &quot;Argonaut&quot; escorted the ocean liner on her last voyage across the North Atlantic Ocean to a permanent berth to serve as a hotel/tourist attraction in California, United States.

In 1968 &quot;Argonaut&quot; joined NATO (STANAVFORLANT)

In 1969 &quot;Argonaut&quot;, with other Royal Navy vessels, sailed with the &quot;Beira Patrol&quot;, a United Nations operation preventing the importation of oil by Rhodesia as a part of the British Government&#x27;s economic sanctions against that country.

In 1969 in an eleven-month deployment &quot;Argonaut&quot; circumnavigated the globe, visiting multiple countries, and also conducted a famine relief operation to FIJI(SUVA)

In 1973, &quot;Argonaut&quot; was recommissioned, completed a six-week work up at Portland, visited Brest, France and then served as a guard ship for the Gibraltar station. Following Iceland&#x27;s declaration of a 200-mile fishing limit, &quot;Argonaut&quot; carried out fishery protection duties for British fishing trawlers inside the zone, in what became known as the &quot;Second Cod War&quot;.

In 1974 from mid January, &quot;Argonaut&quot; spent nine months as part of the group deployment named &#x27;Task Group 317.1&#x27;, led by Flag Officer Second Flotilla (Commander Task Group 317.1). The other ships in the task group were the HMS &quot;Fife&quot;, the frigates of the 7th Frigate Squadron (of which &quot;Argonaut&quot; was one): HMS &quot;Ariadne&quot;, HMS &quot;Danae&quot;, HMS &quot;Londonderry&quot;, and HMS &quot;Scylla&quot; (Captain 7th Frigate Squadron), and two Royal Fleet Auxiliaries (one tanker and one solid stores). In November 1974 &quot;Argonaut&quot; carried out fishery protection duties in the Barents Sea. During this period she visited Hammerfest and Honningsvåg in Norway to take on fuel. Before returning to Devonport she visited Newcastle upon Tyne.

In early 1975 &quot;Argonaut&quot; took part in the annual NATO &#x27;Gate&#x27; naval exercise (called &#x27;Locked Gate&#x27; or &#x27;Open Gate&#x27; in alternating years), and visited Lisbon before returning to Devonport. &quot;Argonaut&quot; joined the Standing Naval Force Atlantic (Stanavforlant) by late 1975. &quot;Argonaut&quot; underwent Exocet modernisation between 1976 and 1980, giving her a potent anti-ship capability. In 1981, &quot;Argonaut&quot; deployed as the Armilla Patrol ship in the Persian Gulf.

==Falklands War==

On 2 April 1982 the Falkland Islands were invaded by the armed forces of Argentina. At the direction of Her Majesty&#x27;s Government, an advanced group of Royal Naval vessels began to steam towards Ascension Island. On 19 April 1982 &quot;Argonaut&quot;, along with and two Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships and headed for Ascension Island, arriving on 29 April 1982. On 6 May 1982 the &quot;Argonaut&quot; Group departed the island heading South for the Falklands, joining the Amphibious Group centred on and , on 16 May, and the Carrier Battle Group on 18 May 1982.

On 21 May 1982 &quot;Argonaut&quot;, along with other destroyers and frigates, provided close escort for amphibious vessels during the opposed arrival at San Carlos by British Forces, with &quot;Argonaut&quot; standing off the &quot;Fanning Head&quot; headland within Falkland Sound guarding the Northern approaches to the operational area. Whilst this operation was underway, she was attacked by Argentine warplanes throughout the day which &quot;Argonaut&quot;, engaged with anti-aircraft weapons. Two of the air attacks succeeded in damaging &quot;Argonaut&quot;.

The first at 10:15 was an improvised assault from a lone Argentine aircraft, piloted by Lt. Guillermo Owen Crippa flying an Aermacchi MB-339 from the Argentine Navy&#x27;s 1st Naval Air Attack Squadron, who had been despatched on a reconnaissance flight over Falkland Sound to ascertain the veracity of reports it had received from an Argentine Army post present at San Carlos. Spotting the landing underway, Crippa attacked &quot;Argonaut&quot; with cannon fire and rockets, causing damage to her Type 965 radar.

The second air attack was made at 13.37 by five A-4 Skyhawks from the Argentinian Air Force&#x27;s 5th Air Brigade, piloted by Lieutenants Fillipini, Autiero, Osses, Robledo, and Ensign Vottero, which hit her with two bombs. Neither exploded, although one killed two sailors, Able Seaman Iain M. Boldy and Able Seaman Matthew J. Stuart, when it entered the ship&#x27;s Sea Cat missile magazine, detonating two missiles and the other did severe damage to her boiler room, knocking out the ship&#x27;s power and leaving her dead in the water. came to the assistance of &quot;Argonaut&quot;. &quot;Plymouth&quot; provided electrical power to the stricken Argonaut, Captain Layman sending a signal &quot;we are damaged and have lost power but we can still fight&quot;. The next day &quot;Argonaut&quot; was towed into San Carlos bay (later known as bomb alley) by 3 RM LSL vessels. Both bombs were still live and it took some days to defuse them.

On 14 June, Argentine forces on the Falkland Islands surrendered to the British task force. On 26 June 1982 &quot;Argonaut&quot; sailed back under her own steam to Devonport Dockyard, where she had her battle damage repaired and new sonar equipment fitted.

===1982–1993===
In 1987 &quot;Argonaut&quot; rescued the businessman/adventurer Richard Branson from the Atlantic Ocean after he had ditched at sea whilst trying to cross it in a hot-air balloon.

In 1990 &quot;Argonaut&quot; represented the Royal Navy at commemorations at the Gallipoli peninsula on the 75th Anniversary of the Gallipoli landings.

In August 1992 &quot;Argonaut&quot; was involved in the pursuit and arrest on the high seas in the South Atlantic Ocean of Roderick Newall, a former British Army officer who had murdered his parents in Jersey.

==Fate==
&quot;Argonaut&quot; was decommissioned from the Royal Navy on 31 March 1993, and was laid up at Fareham Creek. On 25 January 1995 she left Portsmouth Harbour under tow to a port in Spain where she was broken up.

<doc id="568742" wikidata="Q237937" url="?curid=568742" title="Karin Månsdotter">
<text>Karin Månsdotter (in English Catherine; 6 November 1550 – 13 September 1612) was first the mistress and then the queen consort of King Erik XIV of Sweden.

==Early life==
Karin was born in Stockholm to a soldier and later prison guard named Måns (her surname is a patronym, literally &quot;daughter of Måns&quot;) and his wife Ingrid. Her mother came from a family of peasants in Uppland, and was said to have sold vegetables on the square. Both her parents are believed to have died 1560. According to legend, Erik XIV first noticed her selling nuts at a square in Stockholm, and was so astonished by her beauty that he took her to court as his lover, a story mentioned by Dorothea Ostrelska In reality, however, Karin Månsdotter was in 1564 employed as a servant to Karin, wife of the king&#x27;s trusted court musician Gert Cantor, who held a tavern and a guest house in his home, and likely served their guests as a waitress. She was a maid to the king&#x27;s sister, Princess Elizabeth, when she became mistress to the king in 1565.

== Royal mistress ==

Karin seems to have entered into a relationship with Erik in the spring of 1565. The position seems to have been quite official, as she was given expensive clothes and appeared with him openly at court, and was given her own apartment and servants. In the summer of 1565, she belonged to the king&#x27;s retinue to Skara, where she was provided for from the bailiff&#x27;s provision for the warfaring army, which was otherwise reserved for the army, and illustrates her new status. The royal accounts states that she was given a new and expensive wardrobe and her own staff, among them her own former employer: Karin, the wife of Gert Cantor. When her daughter Sigrid was born in 1566, she was treated as a legitimate princess. Before this the king had several mistresses in parallel, such as Agda Persdotter and Doredi Valentinsdotter, but when Karin entered his life, he dismissed them all. She also received education and learned to read and write. His treatment of her caused much astonishment. The ideas of the time suggested witchcraft and love potions to explain the deep attachment.

Karin is reported to have had a fiancé before she met Erik, an ensign named Maximilian. After she became royal mistress, he managed to get into the palace, where he was discovered by Carl the manservant and taken to the king, who had him killed. According to chronicler Daniel Hund, he was in fact trapped by Erik, who had asked Karin to send for him. The truth of the story is unknown.

Karin Månsdotter&#x27;s portrait was done only in her husband&#x27;s scribbled drawings in captivity and in a latter-day bust at her grave (a portrait long believed to be of her has been discovered to be of her sister-in-law). She was described as very beautiful with long blond hair and innocent eyes, and her personality seems to have been calm, humble and natural. The king was mentally unstable, and she seems to have been the only one who could comfort him and calm him down, which made her appreciated by his relatives, who considered her good for him. She had no personal enemies at court, but she was not respected, and their marriage in 1568 was considered a scandal and may have contributed to his dethronement.

Sometime in 1567, Erik decided to marry Karin in accordance to the agreement he made with the council in 1561, which allowed him to marry whom he pleased. His plans was supported by his advisor Jöran Persson, as foreign negotiations had failed and a native aristocrat as queen would have threatened Persson&#x27;s position. Karin is reported to have been a good friend of Persson&#x27;s wife Anna Andersdotter, who apparently often accompanied her on her travels between the different royal palaces.

It is unknown whether Karin Månsdotter had any political influence, but a popular image in Swedish history was of her serving as a counterweight to Jöran Persson; a painting by Georg von Rosen three hundred years later (1871) illustrates this, showing the king on the floor, confused by his inner demons, with Karin Månsdotter at one side holding his hand, looking like an innocent angel giving him strength to resist the demands of Jöran Persson, standing on the other side of him, trying to get him to sign a document.

Her contemporaries, especially the nobles at court, early used her to appeal to Erik on their behalf, and it seems as she did her best to do so, which is illustrated in the Sture Murders in Uppsala in 1567, which could perhaps describe the form of her influence on Erik. In May 1567, Erik is considered to have suffered from some sort of mental collapse. He imprisoned several men from the Sture noble family, among them Count Svante Sture. Countess Märta Sture, sister of the former queen Margaret Leijonhufvud, appealed to Karin Månsdotter for the prisoners&#x27; protection. Karin assured her no-one would hurt the prisoners. Later the same morning, the king visited Svante Sture in prison, fell on his knees before him and begged for his friendship. Later the same day, however, the Sture prisoners were executed. Erik disappeared shortly afterwards, and Karin participated in the search; he was found in the Odensala vicarage.

Karin Månsdotter donated to the sisters of Vadstena Abbey on three occasions between 1566 and 1568, and it is noted that her largest donation was made during Erik&#x27;s sickness in 1567.

== Queen ==

Erik XIV married Karin morganatically in 1567, and officially in 1568, when she was ennobled and crowned queen under the name Katarina Magnusdotter (a formal version of her name). The first, secret wedding ceremony, was performed by Archbishop Laurentius Petri on 29 December 1567. During this period, Erik was periodically affected by his mental problems, and a regency ruled in his stead. The marriage, Erik&#x27;s mental problems and Karin&#x27;s elevation caused rumours. In a letter to Erik&#x27;s sister Sophia, it was reported that &quot;The lunacy which dominates him is a consequence of his deeds. He was somewhat unstable even before, and now he is completely so, guided by his wife&quot;, implying that Karin used witchcraft. The wife of Jöran Persson, Anna Andersdotter, a close friend of Karin, was accused of having spread the rumours and sentenced for slander, but was pardoned at the request of Karin herself. The regency arrested many of Erik&#x27;s advisors, and Karin intervened for many of them. When Erik recovered and the regency was ended, Karin intervened to make peace between Erik and his brother, Duke John.

On 10 February 1568, Karin was ennobled and given the official seal of a queen. In a letter to her sisters-in-law, the princesses Sophia and Elisabeth, she erased the first draft, which formally called them &quot;Dear sisters&quot;, and she did not call herself &quot;Queen&quot;, but &quot;Chosen Queen&quot;, which has been interpreted as meaning that she knew that her position was not fully accepted within the aristocracy. Erik is reported to have plans to have his brothers and other enemies killed before the wedding, but they were warned of these plans by Karin Månsdotter through the dowager queen Catherine Stenbock. These people did not attend the wedding.

The official wedding took place in Storkyrkan on 4 July 1568, followed the next day by the coronation. Karin Månsdotter was walked to the altar by the king&#x27;s cousin Per Brahe under a banner of golden textile carried by four nobles. The wedding was unique; never before had the children of the couple been present at a royal wedding. Both the infant son and the daughter of Erik and Karin were present to confirm their official status. They were placed under the banner between their parents. On 9 June the son was baptized carried by Catherine Stenbock. The coronation was celebrated with great festivities in Stockholm to confirm the new queen&#x27;s legitimacy. Karin&#x27;s peasant relatives, her three maternal uncles from Uppland, Hans Jakobsson, Jakob Jakobsson and Erik Nilsson, were present dressed in clothes made for them by the royal tailor. During the coronation, Lord Chancellor Nils Gyllenstierna fainted and dropped the crown he was carrying to the floor. This was regarded as a bad omen.

During her period as queen, Karin gave gifts to her friends and relatives, such as Anna Nilsdotter i Hammarstorp, who has been identified as her sister despite her different patronymicon, her paternal cousins in Sko kloster, and her &quot;Fränka&quot; (meaning &quot;female relative&quot;) Anna Eriksdotter i Sko. Queen Karin is noted to have granted two royal estates in 1568: on 1 May, she granted the income from Rörstrand in Solna to Torbrjörn Klockare in Stockholm, and on 24 July, she granted Aleby in Botkyrka to Lasse Jakobsson, signing herself in the first document as &quot;Karin Månsdotter&quot; and in the second as &quot;Katarina Regina&quot;. On both occasions, she described different privileges and conditions for the holders. Granting royal estates and deciding their privileges was something normally done by monarchs, and showed her personal influence.

Soon after the coronation, Erik&#x27;s brothers rebelled and he was imprisoned.

===Imprisonment===
Karin was imprisoned with Erik at first at the Royal Palace of Stockholm, and then at the Castle of Turku (1570–71), at Kastelholm Castle in Åland, at Gripsholm Castle (1571–73) and Västerås Castle (1573). Shortly after they were imprisoned, their children were placed in the care of Catherine Stenbock and their French governess Johanna (Jeanne) de Herboville, but were reunited with their parents in 1570. Karin gave birth to two children in captivity in 1570 and 1572, both of whom died in prison. During their imprisonment, it was reported that Karin reproached Erik for the people he had killed during his reign, &quot;as he in his power had innocent people put to death and by doing so caused the imprisonment and misery of his wife and children as well as himself&quot;.

In the summer of 1569, an attempt to free the prisoners and restore Erik to his throne (the 1569 Plot) was made by a group of conspirators led by Karin&#x27;s head lady-in-waiting, Elin Andersdotter, and Karin&#x27;s personal secretary, Thomas Jakobsson. The conspiracy was discovered, and Andersdotter and Jakobsson were executed. Erik was involved in the plans, but it is not mentioned in the documents if Karin was, although the leading conspirators were in her employment. It is known that Erik was on at least three occasions physically abused by his keeper, but it is not thought that this happened in the presence of Karin.

Queen Karin and her children were separated from her husband on 14 June 1573 to prevent the birth of any more legitimate offspring. King Erik wrote in his diary: &quot;My wife has been taken from me by use of violence&quot;. Karin and her children were taken to the Castle of Turku (Åbo) in Finland, where she remained under house arrest until the death of her husband four years later. During these years, two conspiracies were discovered with the purpose of reinstating Erik: the Mornay Plot, and another plot two years later. In 1575, her son was taken from her and sent to Poland to be placed under the care of the Jesuits, but she was allowed to keep her daughter. In 1577, she received the news of her husband&#x27;s death. She was treated with kindness and given the royal estate Liuksiala Manor in Kangasala, Finland, where she lived the rest of her life.

== Widowhood ==
Karin Månsdotter returned to the Swedish court on two occasions. In 1577, newly widowed, she travelled to Stockholm to ask for financial support, which she received. The second time was in 1582, when she met with Queen Catherine Jagiellon and the dowager queen Catherine Stenbock at Svartsjö Castle, in what was called &quot;The Meeting of Three Queens Catherine&quot;.

In 1587, her daughter Sigrid was appointed lady-in-waiting to the new king&#x27;s daughter, Princess Anna, who followed her brother King Sigismund to Warsaw where he had been elected king. Karin accompanied her on her journey. In Warsaw, she met her son Gustaf again, twelve years after he had been taken from her. She saw him once again in Estonia in 1595, and unlike the previous meeting, this meeting has been confirmed. He was now a Catholic, had forgotten her and they could not speak to each other because he had forgotten the Swedish language, the only language Karin was able to speak; she could identify him only by his birthmarks. He was poor and worked as a mercenary. She tried to help him financially, and for the rest of her life tried to get permission for him to return to Sweden, but never saw him again. Her daughter Sigrid, on the other hand, married two Swedish noblemen and often spent time with her mother.

Karin became respected and liked in Finland; during the great peasant rebellion (Cudgel War) in 1596–97, the rebels refrained from plundering her estate. She was also successful in managing the affairs of the estate; in 1587, Liuksiala Manor was one of the most lucrative estates in Finland, and in 1599 it became the second-most lucrative. She kept her neutrality during the Finnish aristocracy&#x27;s conflict with Charles IX of Sweden in 1597–99. Her daughter, whose spouse had been loyal to King Sigismund, was forced to flee from Charles IX to Riga in 1598, but when she returned in 1603, Karin gave her refuge.

In August 1605, Charles IX gave instructions that Karin and her niece (her sister&#x27;s daughter, who was apparently staying with her) be moved to Stockholm. It is not known why, but it may have been because of the political situation in Russia, where her son was a participant. However, the instructions were never carried out. In 1606, Karin asked Charles for permission to free her tenants from the royal taxes so she could use their tax money to buy the freedom of her son, who was at the time a prisoner in Russia, but the king refused. In 1607, Karin nonetheless forbade her tenants to pay the royal taxes. The king then sent her his representatives to explain that this could not be accepted. Soon after, the affair ended with the death of her son in captivity. 

She died peacefully after a period of illness at Liuksiala. She is buried in the Cathedral of Turku.

Karin Månsdotter was the first royal mistress to a Swedish monarch to become queen since Christina Abrahamsdotter in 1470. Although three queens of Sweden in her same century were not of royal blood, but noblewomen, Karin Månsdotter was the only one before Silvia (1976) who was a commoner — not counting Queen Desideria, who although born a commoner became Princess of Ponte Corvo four years before becoming Swedish royalty.

== Family ==
Karin Månsdotter had the following children with the king:

* Princess Sigrid of Sweden (1566–1633) (born before the marriage), lady-in-waiting, spouse of two nobles
* Prince Gustav of Sweden (1568–1607)
* Henrik (1570–1574)
* Arnold (1572–1573)

== Karin Månsdotter in fiction ==
Karin Månsdotter has been portrayed in films and books. The film &quot;Karin Månsdotter&quot; by Alf Sjöberg was made in 1954. Finnish author Mika Waltari wrote a historical novel &quot;&quot; in 1942 (originally written in Finnish, and translated in to Swedish in 1943).

==Legacy==
The asteroid 832 Karin is named in her honour.
