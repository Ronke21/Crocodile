<text>The McMurdo Dry Valleys are a row of largely snow-free valleys in Antarctica, located within Victoria Land west of McMurdo Sound. The Dry Valleys experience extremely low humidity and surrounding mountains prevent the flow of ice from nearby glaciers. The rocks here are granites and gneisses, and glacial tills dot this bedrock landscape, with loose gravel covering the ground. It is one of the driest places on Earth, though there are several anecdotal accounts of rainfall within the Dry Valleys.

The region is one of the world&#x27;s most extreme deserts, and includes many features including Lake Vida, a saline lake, and the Onyx River, a meltwater stream and Antarctica&#x27;s longest river. Although no living organisms have been found in the permafrost here, endolithic photosynthetic bacteria have been found living in the relatively moist interior of rocks, and anaerobic bacteria, with a metabolism based on iron and sulfur, live under the Taylor Glacier.

The valleys are located within the McMurdo Valleys Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA-2).

==Climate==

The Dry Valleys are so named because of their extremely low humidity and lack of snow or ice cover. They are also dry because, in this location, the mountains are sufficiently high that they block seaward-flowing ice from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet from reaching the Ross Sea. At , the valleys constitute around 0.03% of the continent and form the largest ice-free region in Antarctica. The valley floors are covered with loose gravel, in which ice wedge polygonal patterned ground may be observed.

The unique conditions in the Dry Valleys are caused, in part, by katabatic winds; these occur when cold, dense air is pulled downhill by the force of gravity. The dry wind evaporates the snow rapidly and little melts into the soil. During the summer, this process can take only hours.

Another important factor is a lack of precipitation. Precipitation averages around per year over a century of records, almost exclusively in the form of snow. This contributes to the low humidity of the area.

For several weeks in the summer, the temperature increases enough to allow for glacial melt, which causes small freshwater streams to form. These streams feed the lakes at the base of the valleys, which do not have outflow to the sea, causing them to become highly saline.

==Geology==
The McMurdo Oasis constitutes approximately of &quot;deglaciated mountainous desert&quot;, according to McKelvey, bounded by the coastline of south Victoria Land and the Polar Plateau. The Taylor and Wright Valleys are major ice-free valleys within the Transantarctic Mountains. These &quot;dry valleys&quot; include hummocky moraines, with frozen lakes, saline ponds, sand dunes, and meltwater streams. Basement rocks include the Late Precambrian or Early Palaeozoic Skelton Group metamorphic rocks, primarily the Asgard Formation, which is a medium-high-grade marble and calc schist. The Palaeozoic Granite Harbour intrusives include granitoid plutons and dykes, which intruded into the metasedimentary Skelton Group in the Late Cambrian–Early Ordovician during the Ross orogeny. The basement complex is overlain by the Jurassic Beacon Supergroup, which is itself intruded by Ferrar Dolerite sheets and sills. The McMurdo Volcanic Group intrudes, or is interbedded with, the Taylor and Wright Valleys&#x27; moraines as basaltic cinder cones and lava flows. These basalts have ages between 2.1 and 4.4 Ma. The Dry Valley Drilling Project (1971–75) determined the Pleistocene layer within the Taylor Valley was between 137 and 275 m thick, and composed of interbedded sandstones, pebble conglomerates, and laminated silty mudstones. This Pleistocene layer disconformably overlies Pliocene and Miocene diamictites.

==Life==
Endolithic bacteria have been found living in the Dry Valleys, sheltered from the dry air in the relatively moist interior of rocks. Summer meltwater from the glaciers provides the primary source of soil nutrients. Scientists consider the Dry Valleys perhaps the closest of any terrestrial environment to the planet Mars, and thus an important source of insights into possible extraterrestrial life.

Anaerobic bacteria whose metabolism is based on iron and sulfur live in sub-freezing temperatures under the Taylor Glacier.

It was previously thought that algae were staining the red ice emerging at Blood Falls but it is now known that the staining is caused by high levels of iron oxide.

Irish and American researchers conducted a field expedition in 2013 to University Valley in order to examine the microbial population and to test a drill designed for sampling on Mars in the permafrost of the driest parts of the valleys, the areas most analogous to the Martian surface. They found no living organisms in the permafrost, the first location on the planet visited by humans with no active microbial life. 

In 2014, drones were used in the McMurdo Dry Valleys by a team of scientists from Auckland University of Technology (AUT) to create baseline maps of the vegetation. In 2015, the New Zealand Antarctic Research Institute granted funding to AUT to develop methods for operating unmanned aerial vehicles. Over successive summer seasons in Antarctica, the AUT team created three dimensional maps with sub-centimeter resolution, which are now used as baselines. 

Part of the Valleys was designated an environmentally protected area in 2004.

<text>Ivan Fyodorov or Ivan Fеdorov (; ; born c. 1510 or c. 1525 – died December 16, 1583) sometimes transliterated as Fiodorov, was one of the fathers of Eastern Slavonic printing (along with Schweipolt Fiol and Francysk Skaryna). He was also a skilled cannon maker and the inventor of a multibarreled mortar. Fyodorov was forced out of Moscow because of his attempts to employ the “blasphemous” new printing techniques, and found refuge in Poland–Lithuania, first in Zabłudów, then most notably in Ostroh, where he was instrumental in the publication of the Ostrog Bible.

== Name ==
In those times Russians still did not have hereditary surnames, but used patronymics or nicknames, which were also not stable. In his first book &quot;Apostolos&quot; (printed in Moscow in 1564) he called himself in typical Russian style &quot;Ivan Fedorov&quot; that is &quot;Ivan, son of Fedor&quot;. In his other famous book &quot;Ostrog Bible&quot; (1581) he called himself in both Church Slavonic and Greek as &quot;Ivan, son of Feodor (&quot;Феодоров сын&quot;, Θεοδώρου υἱός), a printer from Moscow&quot;. In the Greek version there was &quot;from Great Russia&quot; instead of &quot;from Moscow&quot;. But when he was living for a long time in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, he adopted a local Ruthenian style patronymic in Polish spelling &quot;Fedorowicz&quot; and also added a nickname indicating his origin. In his Latin documents he signed &quot;Johannes Theodori Moscus&quot; (that is &quot;a Muscovite&quot;), or &quot;Ioannes Fedorowicz Moschus, typographus Græcus et Sclavonicus&quot;. As a result of the dialectical replacement of consonant with in early East Slavic the first letter F was sometimes changed, so the patronymic became Chwedorowicz&quot; or Chodorowicz&quot;. In his later Slavonic books (printed in PLC) he signed &quot;Ioann (Ivan) Fe(o)dorovich&quot; (with some orthographic differences), and added a nickname &quot;a Muscovite printer&quot; or just simply &quot;a Muscovite&quot;.

==Biography==
Neither his place nor his date of birth are known. It is assumed that he was born or , most likely in Moscow during the Grand Duchy period - he called himself a Muscovite even after his move to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and in his afterword to the Lviv edition of &quot;Apostle&quot; he named Moscow &quot;our home, our fatherland and our kin&quot;. In 1935 a Russian historian of heraldry, , advanced the hypothesis that his printer&#x27;s mark was the coat of arms of Rahoza, a Belarusian family, and that Fyodorov had a connection with that family either by descent or by adoption. No subsequent researchers have accepted that theory other than Nemirovsky (2002), who agreed only with the possibility of adoption but not with the theory of Fyodorov&#x27;s descent from the .

Fyodorov graduated from the University of Kraków in 1532 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

In 1564–5 Fedorov accepted an appointment as a deacon in the church of Saint Nicolas (Gostunsky) in the Moscow Kremlin. Together with Pyotr Timofeev from Mstislavl (i.e. Mstislavets), he established the Moscow Print Yard and published a number of liturgical works in Church Slavonic using moveable type. This technical innovation created competition for the Muscovite scribes, who began to persecute Fyodorov and Mstislavets, finally forcing them to flee to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania after their printing workshop had been burned down (an alleged arson, as related by Giles Fletcher in 1591).

The printers were received by the Great Lithuanian Hetman Hrehory Chodkiewicz at his estate in Zabłudów (northern Podlaskie), where they published &quot;Yevangeliye uchitel’noye&quot; (Didactic Gospel, 1569) (see Zabłudów Gospel) and &quot;Psaltir’&quot; (Psalter, 1570).

Fyodorov moved to Lviv in 1572 and resumed his work as a printer the following year at the Saint Onuphrius Monastery. (Fyodorov&#x27;s tombstone in Lviv is inscribed with the phrase &quot;renewed neglected printing&quot;.) In 1574 Fyodorov, with the help of his son and Hryn Ivanovych of Zabłudów published the second edition of the &quot;Apostolos&quot; (Apostle, previously published by him in Moscow), with an autobiographical epilogue, and an Azbuka (Alphabet book).

In 1575 Fyodorov, now in the service of Prince Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski, was placed in charge of the Derman Monastery near Dubno; in 1577–9 he established the Ostrog Press, where, in 1581, he published the Ostrog Bible — the first full version of the Bible in Church Slavonic printed in moveable type — as well as a number of other books. Fyodorov returned to Lviv after a quarrel with Prince Konstantyn Ostrogski, but his attempt to reopen his printing shop was unsuccessful. His printing facilities became the property of the Lviv Dormition Brotherhood (later the Stauropegion Institute). The brotherhood used Fyodorov&#x27;s original designs until the early 19th century.

In 1583 he visited Vienna and Kraków, where he showed the Emperor his latest inventions. He then returned to Lviv, where he died on December 16, 1583; he was buried there on the grounds of the Saint Onuphrius Monastery.

<doc id="576676" wikidata="Q735100" url="?curid=576676" title="Helter skelter (ride)">
<text>A helter skelter, or helter-skelter lighthouse,
is an amusement ride resembling a lighthouse with a spiral shaped slide built around the tower. Typically, fairgoers climb up a flight of stairs inside the tower and slide down the spiral on the outside using a coir mat. The ride is most prevalent in amusement parks and fairgrounds in the United Kingdom.

==History==

The first known appearance of the helter skelter was at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in 1906, which survived for thirty years until 1935. However, the ride&#x27;s development began around the turn of the 20th century, when a helter skelter was built on Great Yarmouth&#x27;s new Britannia Pier.

The helter skelter was also present at Dreamland in Margate, Kent. This amusement park was similar in appearance to Blackpool Pleasure Beach during its opening in 1920, which was marked by the opening of the Scenic Railway as a key attraction. In the 1920s, visitors at Dreamland would have experienced both more modern and permanent rides such as the House of Nonsense and the Tumble Bug, as well as traditional rides like the Helter Skelter.

Fairground rides like the helter skelter appeared not only in amusement parks during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but were also popular on seafronts, piers and other convenient spots of land. Birnbeck Pier at Weston-super-Mare in North Somerset is one such example, with a helter skelter being one of its entertainment facilities in the twentieth century.

==Etymology==

The term ‘helter-skelter’ has origins stemming from the word ‘kelter’ or ‘kilter’, meaning working order or alignment. In reconstructed Anglo-French, this translates to ‘eschelture’, or &quot;the state of being in military formation&quot;. ‘Kelter’ was subsequently used to describe the correct configuration of the parts of artillery pieces. Nonetheless, the Latin preposition ‘oltre’, meaning &quot;beyond&quot; was added to ‘eschelture’. The resulting Middle English phrase, ‘helter-skelter’, was adapted from the Anglo-French and Latin terms based on the pattern of reduplicative compounds, with the resulting meaning being &quot;out of formation&quot; and &quot;in disordered haste, confusedly&quot;.

==Design==

The tower on the helter skelter is generally a wooden or aluminium construction, whereas the chute of the slide is usually made from laminated wood. Instead of climbing up a flight of stairs to reach the top of the slide, some helter skelters included an escalator-like lift that fairgoers were loaded onto, and this updated mechanism maintained technical consistency amongst the amusement park rides. This technology was based on familiar transport and factory mechanisms such as electric winches, cogs, ratchets and hydraulic valves. Yet, the familiarity of these mechanisms was understood by fairgoers as modern in an amusement park context, which added to the novelty factor of the ride.

==Variants==

Whilst the traditional British helter skelter resembled a lighthouse, many other variations of the helter skelter have different features and have adopted different themes, including variations on the spiral slide.

Variations on the lighthouse helter skelter include Thomas Warwick&#x27;s slide at Cleethorpes in North East Lincolnshire, England, as well as Manchester White City&#x27;s Dragon Slide. Rather than the traditional lighthouse tower, Thomas Warwick&#x27;s slide was shaped like a castle tower with turrets at the top. It was built by Thomas Warwick, who also gave the town their first observation tower and subsequent swing ride. Manchester White City&#x27;s Dragon Slide, also called The Holland Slide, kept the lighthouse theme, but instead featured a decorative slide around the tower, which was designed to look like a dragon, with the dragon&#x27;s head at the bottom.

The Hurry Skurry is another noteworthy variation of the helter-skelter. The Hurry Skurry included a slide which zigzagged down the structure rather than spiralling around it and examples existed at Crystal Palace in London, and on the Birnbeck Pier at Weston-super-Mare

The Bowl Slide was introduced at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in 1911, and the popularity of this ride saw further development occur into the 1920s and 1930s, where examples of the slide surfaced at the Whitley Bay Spanish City in North Tyneside, the Kursaal at Southend-on-Sea, 
and Southport Pleasureland.

==In popular culture==
The helter skelter was the subject and inspiration of the song of the same name by the Beatles from &quot;The White Album&quot;. Paul McCartney explained that he was &quot;using the symbol of a helter-skelter as a ride from the top to the bottom--the rise and fall of the Roman Empire--and this was the fall, the demise, the going down.&quot; Upon listening to the album, American criminal Charles Manson interpreted Helter Skelter as a call to violence, and so the song came to embody his Family&#x27;s internal belief system, leading to their goal to incite an apocalyptic race war. In 1969, Manson and his followers murdered Sharon Tate and four others in her Los Angeles home of 10050 Cielo Drive, and the murder of a grocery store owner and his wife the following night. At this second crime scene, a misspelling of the term &quot;helter-skelter&quot; was found written in blood, which stopped McCartney from performing the song live for many years to come.

The ride has also been featured in &quot;Planet Coaster 2&quot;.

<text>Lake Vida is a hypersaline lake in Victoria Valley, the northernmost of the large McMurdo Dry Valleys, on the continent of Antarctica. It is isolated under year-round ice cover, and is considerably more saline than seawater. It came to public attention in 2002 when microbes frozen in its ice cover for more than 2,800 years were successfully thawed and reanimated.

==Introduction==
Lake Vida is one of the largest lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valley region and is a closed-basin endorheic lake. The permanent surface ice on the lake is the thickest non-glacial ice on earth, reaching a depth of at least . The ice at depth is saturated with brine that is seven times as saline as seawater. The high salinity allows the brine to remain liquid at an average yearly water temperature of . The ice cap has sealed the saline brine from external air and water for thousands of years, creating a time capsule for ancient DNA. This combination of lake features makes Lake Vida a unique lacustrine ecosystem on Earth.

The lake gained widespread recognition in December 2002 when a research team, led by the University of Illinois at Chicago&#x27;s Peter Doran, announced the discovery of 2,800‑year‑old halophile microbes (primarily filamentous cyanobacteria) preserved in ice layer core samples drilled in 1996. The microbes reanimated upon thawing, grew and reproduced. Due to this discovery and the freezing mechanisms forming Lake Vida&#x27;s ice-seal, Lake Vida is now noted as a location for research into Earth&#x27;s climate and life under extreme conditions, specifically the fauna that could have existed on Mars. The unmanned Lake Vida Meteorological Station monitors climate conditions around the lake year round for such scientific study.

A 2010 field campaign, funded by the National Science Foundation through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, to investigate the microbiology and geochemistry of Lake Vida. Led by Peter Doran and Alison Murray from Nevada&#x27;s Desert Research Institute, the expedition recovered ice cores, brine and sediment samples from the lake using clean drilling procedures to avoid contamination.

The lake itself has no permanent settlements or infrastructure. The nearby Lake Vida Meteorological Station is unmanned, sending meteorological data to McMurdo Dry Valleys Long Term Ecological Research organization. The closest human settlement is Scott Base McMurdo approximately away. In addition to the unmanned observation station, a 5-day emergency supply of food for 6 people is cached from the southwestern shore. Research teams establish temporary camps from which research activities are conducted on short term basis in the summer months.

==Composition==
Lake Vida does not possess many factors attributed to the existence of life formations. Lake Vida contains high levels of nitrous oxide (N2O) and also molecular hydrogen (H2). The chemicals are believed to be released from chemical reactions between the brine and underlying sediments. The molecular hydrogen may be crucial as an energy source for life in the lake and aids in justifying the presence of life in an oxygen-deprived environment.

==Hydrology==
Lake Vida has at least three named inflows: Victoria River, Kite Stream, and Dune Creek. Victoria River passes through the Vida Basin into Victoria Valley, Victoria Land as ephemeral glacial meltwater from the Upper Victoria Glacier, draining from Victoria Upper Lake, to the northwest, to finally drain into the west end of Lake Vida. Kite Stream is also located in the Vida Basin and flows as ephemeral glacial meltwater west from the Victoria Lower Glacier into the east end of Lake Vida. The United States Geological Survey&#x27;s Atlas of Antarctic Research maps up to nine Lake Vida inflows or outflows including Victoria River and Kite Stream. The inflows and outflows are normally dry due to average annual temperatures down to at Lake Vida. Meltwater flows for a few weeks in the summer months when temperatures rise sufficiently for the nearby glaciers to melt. The McMurdo Dry Valleys are classified as extreme desert. The area receives less than of snow precipitation a year, in the form of snow that builds the nearby glaciers.

==Geology==

=== Main geological features ===
In the vicinity of Lake Vida, a variety of geological features are noted, the most significant being glaciers, lakes, valleys, ridges, and summits. There are approximately 25 named glaciers within a radius with the nearest being Upper Victoria Glacier, Packard Glacier, Clark Glacier, and Clio Glacier. In the same radius, there are approximately 14 named ridges with the nearest being Robertsons Ridge, Helios Ridge, and Nottage Ridge. In addition to Victoria Valley, there are 16 named valleys with the nearest being Sanford Valley, Barwick Valley and McKelvey Valley. In addition to Upper Victoria Lake that feeds Lake Vida with meltwater, there are approximately 11 other lakes, the nearest being Lake Thomas. The summits around Lake Vida are as follows, Mautino Peak, Mount Saga, Mount Allen, Mount Theseus, Mount Cerberus, Mount Insel, Nickell Peak, and Sponsors Peak.

===Other geological features===
Other more minor features include benches, cliffs, gaps, and streams. The Victoria Valley dunefield, an approximately 1.5 km2 belt which is about 3.1 km long, lies to the east of Lake Vida. It is an important site for research into the landforms and processes of perennial niveo-aeolian environments.

==Natural history==
Kite Stream is named after a researcher, James Kite, who found numerous meteorites in the area (1977–1978).

==History==
Lake Vida lies north of Mount Cerberus in the Victoria Valley of Victoria Land. Named by the Victoria University of Wellington Antarctic Expedition (1958–59) after Vida (Vaida), a sledge dog of the Nimrod Expedition, 1910-13. Lake Vida was originally thought to be frozen to the lakebed.

==Life==
Scientists have found life in an Antarctic Lake Vida that was sealed off from the outside world by a thick sheet of ice several thousands of years ago. The discovery of the ecosystem pushes the boundaries of what life can endure, and may inform the search for alien microbes on other planets, such as Mars, or on icy moons, for instance, Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa.

<doc id="576680" wikidata="Q1057533" url="?curid=576680" title="Helter Skelter (song)">
<text>&quot;Helter Skelter&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1968 album &quot;The Beatles&quot; (also known as the &quot;White Album&quot;). It was written by Paul McCartney and credited to Lennon–McCartney. The song was McCartney&#x27;s attempt to create a sound as loud and dirty as possible. It is regarded as a key influence in the early development of heavy metal. In 1976, the song was released as the B-side of &quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot; in the United States, to promote the Capitol Records compilation &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Music&quot;.

Along with other tracks from the White Album, &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; was interpreted by cult leader Charles Manson as a message predicting inter-racial war in the US. A vision of this uprising was named after the song. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; 52nd on its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Beatles Songs&quot;. Siouxsie and the Banshees, Mötley Crüe, Aerosmith, U2, Oasis and Pat Benatar are among the artists who have covered the track, and McCartney has frequently performed it in concert.

==Background and inspiration==

Paul McCartney was inspired to write &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; after reading an interview with the Who&#x27;s Pete Townshend in which he described their September 1967 single, &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot;, as the loudest, rawest, dirtiest song the Who had ever recorded. McCartney said he then wrote &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; to have &quot;the most raucous vocal, the loudest drums&quot;. On 20 November 1968, two days before the release of &quot;The Beatles&quot; (also known as &quot;the White Album&quot;), McCartney gave Radio Luxembourg an exclusive interview, in which he commented on several of the album&#x27;s songs. Speaking of &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, he said:

In British English, a helter skelter is a fairground attraction consisting of a tall spiral slide winding around a tower; however, the phrase can also mean chaos and disorder. McCartney said that he was &quot;using the symbol of a helter skelter as a ride from the top to the bottom; the rise and fall of the Roman Empire – and this was the fall, the demise.&quot; He later said that the song was a response to critics who accused him of writing only sentimental ballads and being &quot;the soppy one&quot; of the band. Although the song is credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership, it was written by McCartney alone. John Lennon acknowledged in a 1980 interview: &quot;That&#x27;s Paul &quot;completely&quot;.&quot; 
==Composition==

The song is in the key of E major and in a time signature. On the recording issued on &quot;The Beatles&quot;, its structure comprises two combinations of verse and chorus, followed by an instrumental passage and a third verse–chorus combination. This is followed by a prolonged ending during which the performance stops, picks up again, fades out, fades back in, and then fades out one final time amidst a cacophony of sounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack/Notes&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The stereo mix features one more section that fades in and concludes the song.

The only chords used in the song are E7, G and A, with the first of these being played throughout the extended ending. Musicologist Walter Everett comments on the musical form: &quot;There is no dominant and little tonal function; organized noise is the brief.&quot; The lyrics initially follow the title&#x27;s fairground theme, from the opening line &quot;When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide&quot;. McCartney completes the first half-verse with a hollered &quot;and then I see you again!&quot; The lyrics then become more suggestive and provocative, with the singer asking, &quot;But do you, don&#x27;t you, want me to love you?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;O&#x27;Toole/SomethingElse&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In author Jonathan Gould&#x27;s description, &quot;The song turns the colloquialism for a fairground ride into a metaphor for the sort of frenzied, operatic sex that adolescent boys of all ages like to fantasize about.&quot;

==Recording==
&quot;Helter Skelter&quot; was recorded several times during the sessions for the White Album. During the 18 July 1968 session, the Beatles recorded take 3 of the song, lasting 27 minutes and 11 seconds. However, this version differs greatly from, and is slower than, the album version. Chris Thomas produced the 9 September session in George Martin&#x27;s absence. He recalled the session was especially spirited: &quot;While Paul was doing his vocal, George Harrison had set fire to an ashtray and was running around the studio with it above his head, doing an Arthur Brown.&quot; Ringo Starr recalled: Helter Skelter&#x27; was a track we did in total madness and hysterics in the studio. Sometimes you just had to shake out the jams.&quot; In Mark Lewisohn&#x27;s book &quot;The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions&quot;, Abbey Road engineer Brian Gibson was quoted saying that the Beatles were &quot;jamming away, completely oblivious to the world&quot; that night, and that management ignored what went on in the studio.

On 9 September, 18 takes lasting approximately five minutes each were recorded, with the last one featured on the original LP. At around 3:40, the song completely fades out, then gradually fades back in, fades back out partially, and finally fades back in quickly with three cymbal crashes and shouting from Starr. During the end of the 18th take, he threw his drum sticks across the studio and screamed, &quot;I got blisters on my fingers!&quot; Starr&#x27;s shout was only included on the stereo mix of the song; the mono version (originally on LP only) ends on the first fadeout without Starr&#x27;s outburst. On 10 September, the band added overdubs which included a lead guitar part by Harrison, trumpet played by Mal Evans, piano, further drums, and &quot;mouth sax&quot; created by Lennon blowing through a saxophone mouthpiece.

According to music critic Tim Riley, although McCartney and Lennon had diverged markedly as songwriters during this period, the completed track can be seen as a &quot;competitive apposition&quot; to Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey&quot;. He says that whereas Lennon &quot;submerges in scatalogical contradictions&quot; in his song, &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; &quot;ignites a scathing, almost violent disorder&quot;. In Everett&#x27;s view, rather than the Who&#x27;s contemporaneous music, the song &quot;sounds more like an answer to [Yoko Ono]&quot;, the Japanese performance artist who, as Lennon&#x27;s new romantic partner, was a constant presence at the White Album sessions and a source of tension within the band.

Musicologists Kenny Jenkins (of Leeds Beckett University) and Richard Perks (of University of Kent) have expressed the opinion that a Bartell fretless guitar belonging to Harrison was used on this track.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Helter Skelter&quot; was sequenced as the penultimate track on side three of &quot;The Beatles&quot;, between &quot;Sexy Sadie&quot; and &quot;Long, Long, Long&quot;. The segue from &quot;Sexy Sadie&quot; was a rare example of a gap (or &quot;rill&quot;) being used to separate the album&#x27;s tracks, and the brief silence served to heighten the song&#x27;s abrupt arrival. In Riley&#x27;s description, the opening guitar figure &quot;demolishes the silence ... from a high, piercing vantage point&quot; while, at the end of &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, the meditative &quot;Long, Long, Long&quot; begins as &quot;the smoke and ash are still settling&quot;. The double LP was released by Apple Records on 22 November 1968.

In his contemporary review for &quot;International Times&quot;, Barry Miles described &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; as &quot;probably the heaviest rocker on plastic today&quot;, while the &quot;NME&quot;″s Alan Smith found it &quot;low on melody but high on atmosphere&quot; and &quot;frenetically sexual&quot;, adding that its pace was &quot;so fast they all only just about keep up with themselves&quot;. &quot;Record Mirror&quot;″s reviewer said the track contained &quot;screaming pained vocals, ear splitting buzz guitar and general instrumental confusion, but [a] rather typical pattern&quot;, and concluded: &quot;Ends sounding like five thousand large electric flies out for a good time. Ringo then blurts out with excruciating torment: &#x27;I got blisters on my fingers!&#x27;&quot;

In his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Jann Wenner wrote that the Beatles had been unfairly overlooked as hard rock stylists, and he grouped the song with &quot;Birthday&quot; and &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey&quot; as White Album tracks that captured &quot;the very best traditional and contemporary elements in rock and roll&quot;. He described &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; as &quot;excellent&quot;, highlighting its &quot;guitar lines behind the title words, the rhythm guitar track layering the whole song with that precisely used fuzztone, and Paul&#x27;s gorgeous vocal&quot;. Geoffrey Cannon of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised it as one of McCartney&#x27;s &quot;perfect, professional songs, packed with exact quotes and characterisation&quot;, and recommended the stereo version for the way it &quot;transforms&quot; the song &quot;from a nifty fast number to one of my best 30 tracks of all time&quot;. Although he misidentified it as a Lennon song, William Mann of &quot;The Times&quot; said &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; was &quot;exhaustingly marvellous, a revival that is willed by creativity ... into resurrection, a physical but essentially musical thrust into the loins&quot;.

In June 1976, Capitol Records included the track on its themed double album compilation &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Music&quot;. In the United States, the song was also issued on the single promoting the album, as the B-side to &quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; appeared on the iTunes compilation album &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, which the band&#x27;s website described as a collection of &quot;the Beatles&#x27; most influential rock songs&quot;.

On the Beatles&#x27; 2006 remix album &quot;Love&quot;, the song was remixed in mashup along with &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot;, and snippets of that song and &quot;I Want You (She&#x27;s So Heavy)&quot; are mixed in with the repeated guitar riff. The mix also included the organ solo and the guitar solo from the Trident studio outtake.

==Charles Manson interpretation==
According to Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi, who led the prosecution of Manson and four of his followers who acted on Manson&#x27;s instruction in the Tate–LaBianca murders, Charles Manson told his followers that several White Album songs, particularly &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, were part of the Beatles&#x27; coded prophecy of an apocalyptic war in which racist and non-racist whites would be manoeuvred into virtually exterminating each other over the treatment of blacks. Upon the war&#x27;s conclusion, after black militants had killed off the few whites that had survived, Manson and his &quot;Family&quot; of followers would emerge from an underground city in which they would have escaped the conflict. As the only remaining whites, they would rule blacks, who, as the vision went, would be incapable of running the United States. Manson employed &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; as the term for this sequence of events. In his interpretation, the lyrics of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; described the moment when he and the Family would emerge from their hiding place – a disused mine shaft in the desert outside Los Angeles.

Bugliosi named his best-selling book about the murders &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;. At the scene of the LaBianca murders in August 1969, the phrase (misspelt as &quot;HEALTER SKELTER&quot;) was found written in the victims&#x27; blood on the refrigerator door. In October 1970, Manson&#x27;s defence team announced that they would call on Lennon for his testimony. Lennon responded that his comments would be of no use, since he had no hand in writing &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;.

Bugliosi&#x27;s book was the basis for the 1976 television film &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;. The film&#x27;s popularity in the US ensured that the song, and the White Album generally, received a new wave of attention. As a result, Capitol planned to issue &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; as the A-side of the single from &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Music&quot; but relented, realising that to exploit its association with Manson would be in poor taste. In the final interview he gave before his murder in December 1980, Lennon dismissed Manson as &quot;just an extreme version&quot; of the type of listener who read false messages in the Beatles&#x27; lyrics, such as those behind the 1969 &quot;Paul is dead&quot; rumour. Lennon also said: &quot;All that Manson stuff was built around George&#x27;s song about pigs [&#x27;Piggies&#x27;] and this one, Paul&#x27;s song about an English fairground. It has nothing to do with anything, and least of all to do with &quot;me&quot;.&quot;

Reflecting on &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; and its appropriation by the Manson Family in his 1997 authorised biography, &quot;Many Years from Now&quot;, McCartney said, &quot;Unfortunately, it inspired people to do evil deeds&quot; and that the song had acquired &quot;all sorts of ominous overtones because Manson picked it up as an anthem&quot;. Author Devin McKinney describes the White Album as &quot;also a black album&quot; in that it is &quot;haunted by race&quot;. He writes that, in spite of McCartney&#x27;s comments about the song&#x27;s meaning, the recording conveys a violent subtext typical of much of the album and that &quot;Here as ever in Beatle music, performance determines meaning; and as the adrenalized guitars run riot, the meaning is simple, dreadful, inarticulate, and instantly understood: &quot;She&#x27;s coming down fast.&quot;&quot; In her 1979 essay collection, titled &quot;The White Album&quot;, Joan Didion wrote that many people in Los Angeles cite the moment that news arrived of the Manson Family&#x27;s killing spree in August 1969 as having marked the end of the decade. According to author Doyle Greene, the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; effectively captured the &quot;crises of 1968&quot;, which contrasted sharply with the previous year&#x27;s Summer of Love ethos. He adds: &quot;While &#x27;Revolution&#x27; posited a forthcoming unity as far as social change, &#x27;Helter Skelter&#x27; signified a chaotic and overwhelming sense of falling apart occurring throughout the world politically and, not unrelated, the falling apart of the Beatles as a working band and the counterculture dream they represented.&quot;

This theory was introduced by Bugliosi in Manson&#x27;s trial. Mike McGann, the lead police investigator on the Tate–LaBianca murders stated, &quot;Everything in Vince Bugliosi&#x27;s book (&quot;Helter Skelter&quot;) is wrong. I was the lead investigator on the case. Bugliosi didn&#x27;t solve it. Nobody trusted him.&quot; Police detective Charlie Guenther who investigated the murders and Bugliosi&#x27;s co-prosecutor Aaron Stovits have also discredited this as the motive for the murders.

==Retrospective reviews and legacy==
Writing for MusicHound in 1999, &quot;Guitar World&quot; editor Christopher Scapelliti grouped &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; with &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; and &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Gun&quot; as the White Album&#x27;s three &quot;fascinating standouts&quot;. The song was noted for its &quot;proto-metal roar&quot; by AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erlwine/AM&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the album&#x27;s release, Jacob Stolworthy of &quot;The Independent&quot; listed the same three songs as its best tracks, with &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; ranked at number 3. Stolworthy described it as &quot;one of the best rock songs ever recorded&quot; and concluded: &quot;The fiercest, most blistering track that arguably paved the way for heavy metal is far removed from the tame love songs people were used to from [McCartney].&quot; Writing in 2014, Ian Fortnam of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine cited &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; as one of the four songs that made the Beatles&#x27; White Album an &quot;enduring blueprint for rock&quot;, along with &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, &quot;Yer Blues&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Pass Me By&quot;, in that together they contained &quot;every one of rock&#x27;s key ingredients&quot;. In the case of McCartney&#x27;s song, he said that the track was &quot;one of the prime progenitors of heavy metal&quot; and a major influence on 1970s punk rock.

Ian MacDonald dismissed &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; as &quot;ridiculous, [with] McCartney shrieking weedily against a massively tape-echoed backdrop of out-of-tune thrashing&quot;, and said that in their efforts to embrace heavy rock, the Beatles &quot;comically overreached themselves, reproducing the requisite bulldozer design but on a Dinky Toy scale&quot;. He added: &quot;Few have seen fit to describe this track as anything other than a literally drunken mess.&quot; Rob Sheffield was also unimpressed, writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004) that, following the double album&#x27;s release on CD, &quot;now you can program &#x27;Sexy Sadie&#x27; and &#x27;Long, Long, Long&#x27; without having to lift the needle to skip over &#x27;Helter Skelter.&#x27;&quot; David Quantick, in his book &quot;Revolution: The Making of the Beatles&#x27; White Album&quot;, describes the song as &quot;Neither loud enough to bludgeon the listener into being impressed nor inspired enough to be exciting&quot;. He says that it becomes &quot;a bit dull after two minutes&quot; and, after its laboured attempts at an ending, is &quot;redeemed only&quot; by Starr&#x27;s closing remark.

Doyle Greene argues that the Beatles and Manson are &quot;permanently connected in pop-culture consciousness&quot; as a result of Manson&#x27;s supposed interpretation of &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, &quot;Piggies&quot; and other tracks from the White Album. &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; was voted the fourth worst song in one of the first polls to rank the Beatles&#x27; songs, conducted in 1971 by WPLJ and &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. According to Walter Everett, it is typically among the five most-disliked Beatles songs for members of the baby boomer generation, who made up the band&#x27;s contemporary audience during the 1960s.

In March 2005, &quot;Q&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; at number 5 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Tracks Ever&quot;. The song appeared at number 52 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2010 list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Beatles Songs&quot;. In 2018, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; selected it as one of &quot;The 50 Most Evil Songs Ever&quot; due to its association with the Manson Family murders.

==Cover versions==
Since the producers of the 1976 film &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; were denied permission to use the Beatles recording, the song was re-recorded for the soundtrack by the band Silverspoon. Siouxsie and the Banshees included a cover of &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; at live shows from mid 1977, and recorded it as a Peel Session in 1978, before releasing a version later that year, produced by Steve Lillywhite, on their debut album &quot;The Scream&quot;. Fortnam cites the band&#x27;s choice as reflective of how the song&#x27;s &quot;macabre association with Charles Manson ... only served to accentuate its enduring appeal in certain quarters&quot;. While discussing the stereo and mono versions of the Beatles&#x27; 1968 recording and the best-known cover versions of the track up to 2002, Quantick highlights the Siouxsie and the Banshees recording as &quot;the best of all of them&quot;. In an article about the legacy of the song, &quot;Financial Times&quot; further commented the Banshees&#x27; version, saying: &quot;The abrupt ending on &#x27;stop&#x27; also leaves the listener mentally stuck at the top of the slide with no way down&quot;.
In 1983, Mötley Crüe included the song on their album &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot;. Nikki Sixx, the band&#x27;s bassist, recalled that &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; appealed to them through its guitars and lyrics, but also because of the Manson murders and the song&#x27;s standing as a &quot;real symbol of darkness and evil&quot;. Mötley Crüe&#x27;s 1983 picture disc for the song featured a photo of a fridge with the title written in blood. That same year, the Bobs released an a cappella version on their album &quot;The Bobs&quot;. It earned them a 1984 Grammy nomination for Best Vocal Arrangement for Two or More Voices.

In 1988, a U2 recording was used as the opening track on their album &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot;. The song was recorded live at the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colorado on 8 November 1987. Introducing the song, Bono said, &quot;This is a song Charles Manson stole from the Beatles. We’re stealing it back.&quot; Aerosmith included a cover of &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, recorded in 1975, on their 1991 compilation &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;. Aerosmith&#x27;s version charted at number 21 on the Album Rock Tracks chart in the US.

&quot;Helter Skelter&quot; has been covered by many other artists, including Pat Benatar, Vow Wow, Hüsker Dü, Dianne Heatherington and Thrice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fontenot/About&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Shock rock artists Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson collaborated on a cover of &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, which was released in 2018 to promote their co-headlining &quot;Twins of Evil: The Second Coming Tour&quot;. Their version peaked at number nine on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hard Rock Digital Songs. Swiss industrial black metal band Samael covered the song on their 2017 album &quot;Hegemony&quot;, with a music video released in 2021 where they credit &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; as being the &quot;first metal song ever recorded&quot;.

==McCartney live performances==
Since 2004, McCartney has frequently performed &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; in concert. The song featured in the set lists for his &#x27;04 Summer Tour, The &#x27;US&#x27; Tour (2005), Summer Live &#x27;09 (2009), the Good Evening Europe Tour (2009), the Up and Coming Tour (2010–11) and the On the Run Tour (2011–12). He also played it on his Out There Tour, which began in May 2013. In the last tours, the song has been generally inserted on the third encore, which is the last time the band enters the stage. It is usually one of the last songs, performed after &quot;Yesterday&quot; and before the final medley including &quot;The End&quot;. McCartney played the song on his One on One Tour at Fenway Park on 17 July 2016 accompanied by the Grateful Dead&#x27;s Bob Weir and New England Patriots football player Rob Gronkowski. 

McCartney performed the song live at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards on 8 February 2006 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. In 2009, he performed it live on top of the Ed Sullivan Theater marquee during his appearance on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

At the 53rd Grammy Awards in 2011, the version of the song from McCartney&#x27;s live album &quot;Good Evening New York City&quot;, recorded during the Summer Live &#x27;09 tour, won in the category of Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance. It was his first solo Grammy Award since he won for arranging &quot;Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey&quot; in 1972. McCartney opened his set at 12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief with the song. On 13 July 2019, the final date of his Freshen Up tour, McCartney performed &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles with Starr playing drums.

<text>A speedometer or speed meter is a gauge that measures and displays the instantaneous speed of a vehicle. Now universally fitted to motor vehicles, they started to be available as options in the early 20th century, and as standard equipment from about 1910 onwards. Other vehicles may use devices analogous to the speedometer with different means of sensing speed, eg. boats use a pit log, while aircraft use an airspeed indicator.

Charles Babbage is credited with creating an early type of a speedometer, which was usually fitted to locomotives.

The electric speedometer was invented by the Croat Josip Belušić in 1888 and was originally called a velocimeter.

== History ==
The speedometer was originally patented by Josip Belušić (Giuseppe Bellussich) in 1888. He presented his invention at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris. His invention had a pointer and a magnet, using electricity to work.
German inventor Otto Schultze patented his version (which, like Belušić&#x27;s, ran on eddy currents) on 7 October 1902.

== Operation ==
===Mechanical===
Many speedometers use a rotating flexible cable driven by gearing linked to the vehicle&#x27;s transmission. The early Volkswagen Beetle and many motorcycles, however, use a cable driven from a front wheel.

Some early mechanical speedometers operated on the governor principle where a rotating weight acting against a spring moved further out as the speed increased, similar to the governor used on steam engines. This movement was transferred to the pointer to indicate speed. 

This was followed by the Chronometric speedometer where the distance traveled was measured over a precise interval of time (Some Smiths speedometers used 3/4 of a second) measured by an escapement. This was transferred to the speedometer pointer. The chronometric speedometer is tolerant of vibration and was used in motorcycles up to the 1970s.

When the vehicle is in motion, a speedometer gear assembly turns a speedometer cable, which then turns the speedometer mechanism itself. A small permanent magnet affixed to the speedometer cable interacts with a small aluminium cup (called a &quot;speedcup&quot;) attached to the shaft of the pointer on the analogue speedometer instrument. As the magnet rotates near the cup, the changing magnetic field produces eddy current in the cup, which itself produces another magnetic field. The effect is that the magnet exerts a torque on the cup, &quot;dragging&quot; it, and thus the speedometer pointer, in the direction of its rotation with no mechanical connection between them.

The pointer shaft is held toward zero by a fine torsion spring. The torque on the cup increases with the speed of rotation of the magnet. Thus an increase in the speed of the car will twist the cup and speedometer pointer against the spring. The cup and pointer will turn until the torque of the eddy currents on the cup are balanced by the opposing torque of the spring, and then stop. Given the torque on the cup is proportional to the car&#x27;s speed, and the spring&#x27;s deflection is proportional to the torque, the angle of the pointer is also proportional to the speed, so that equally spaced markers on the dial can be used for gaps in speed. At a given speed, the pointer will remain motionless and point to the appropriate number on the speedometer&#x27;s dial.

The return spring is calibrated such that a given revolution speed of the cable corresponds to a specific speed indication on the speedometer. This calibration must take into account several factors, including ratios of the tail shaft gears that drive the flexible cable, the final drive ratio in the differential, and the diameter of the driven tires.

One of the key disadvantages of the eddy current speedometer is that it cannot show the vehicle speed when running in reverse gear since the cup would turn in the opposite direction – in this scenario, the needle would be driven against its mechanical stop pin on the zero position.

===Electronic===

Many modern speedometers are electronic. In designs derived from earlier eddy-current models, a rotation sensor mounted in the transmission delivers a series of electronic pulses whose frequency corresponds to the (average) rotational speed of the driveshaft, and therefore the vehicle&#x27;s speed, assuming the wheels have full traction. The sensor is typically a set of one or more magnets mounted on the output shaft or (in transaxles) differential crown wheel, or a toothed metal disk positioned between a magnet and a magnetic field sensor. As the part in question turns, the magnets or teeth pass beneath the sensor, each time producing a pulse in the sensor as they affect the strength of the magnetic field it is measuring. Alternatively, particularly in vehicles with multiplex wiring, some manufacturers use the pulses coming from the ABS wheel sensors which communicate to the instrument panel via the CAN Bus. Most modern electronic speedometers have the additional ability over the eddy current type to show the vehicle&#x27;s speed when moving in reverse gear.

A computer converts the pulses to a speed and displays this speed on an electronically controlled, analogue-style needle or a digital display. Pulse information is also used for a variety of other purposes by the ECU or full-vehicle control system, e.g. triggering ABS or traction control, calculating average trip speed, or increment the odometer in place of it being turned directly by the speedometer cable.

Another early form of electronic speedometer relies upon the interaction between a precision watch mechanism and a mechanical pulsator driven by the car&#x27;s wheel or transmission. The watch mechanism endeavours to push the speedometer pointer toward zero, while the vehicle-driven pulsator tries to push it toward infinity. The position of the speedometer pointer reflects the relative magnitudes of the outputs of the two mechanisms.

====Virtual====
Virtual speedometers typically approximate speed based on distance traveled over time with the help of a satellite radio navigation system, such as GPS. Virtual speedometers tend to be less accurate than their analog counterparts and are affected by environmental factors such as weather conditions, terrain, and obstructions in the way of the signal.

==== Bicycle speedometers ====

Typical bicycle speedometers measure the time between each wheel revolution and give a readout on a small, handlebar-mounted digital display. The sensor is mounted on the bike at a fixed location, pulsing when the spoke-mounted magnet passes by. In this way, it is analogous to an electronic car speedometer using pulses from an ABS sensor, but with a much cruder time/distance resolution – typically one pulse/display update per revolution, or as seldom as once every 2–3 seconds at low speed with a wheel. However, this is rarely a critical problem, and the system provides frequent updates at higher road speeds where the information is of more importance. The low pulse frequency also has little impact on measurement accuracy, as these digital devices can be programmed by wheel size, or additionally by wheel or tire circumference to make distance measurements more accurate and precise than a typical motor vehicle gauge. However, these devices carry some minor disadvantages in requiring power from batteries that must be replaced every so often in the receiver (and sensor, for wireless models), and, in wired models, the signal is carried by a thin cable that is much less robust than that used for brakes, gears, or cabled speedometers.

Other, usually older bicycle speedometers are cable driven from one or other wheel, as in the motorcycle speedometers described above. These do not require battery power, but can be relatively bulky and heavy, and may be less accurate. The turning force at the wheel may be provided either from a gearing system at the hub (making use of the presence of e.g. a hub brake, cylinder gear, or dynamo) as per a typical motorcycle, or with a friction wheel device that pushes against the outer edge of the rim (same position as rim brakes, but on the opposite edge of the fork) or the sidewall of the tire itself. The former type is quite reliable and low maintenance but needs a gauge and hub gearing properly matched to the rim and tire size, whereas the latter requires little or no calibration for a moderately accurate readout (with standard tires, the &quot;distance&quot; covered in each wheel rotation by a friction wheel set against the rim should scale fairly linearly with wheel size, almost as if it were rolling along the ground itself) but are unsuitable for off-road use, and must be kept properly tensioned and clean of road dirt to avoid slipping or jamming.

== Error ==
Most speedometers have tolerances of some ±10%, mainly due to variations in tire diameter. Sources of error due to tire diameter variations are wear, temperature, pressure, vehicle load, and nominal tire size. Vehicle manufacturers usually calibrate speedometers to read high by an amount equal to the average error, to ensure that their speedometers never indicate a lower speed than the actual speed of the vehicle, to ensure they are not liable for drivers violating speed limits.

Excessive speedometer errors after manufacture can come from several causes, but most commonly is due to nonstandard tire diameter, in which case the error is:
formula_1

Nearly all tires now have their size is shown as &quot;T/A_W&quot; on the side of the tire (See: Tire code), and the tires.

formula_2
formula_3

For example, a standard tire is &quot;185/70R14&quot; with diameter = 2*185*(70/100)+(14*25.4) = 614.6 mm (185x70/1270 + 14 = 24.20 in). Another is &quot;195/50R15&quot; with 2*195*(50/100)+(15*25.4) = 576.0 mm (195x50/1270 + 15 = 22.68 in). Replacing the first tire (and wheels) with the second (on 15&quot; = 381 mm wheels), a speedometer reads 100 * ((614.6/576) - 1) = 100 * (24.20/22.68 - 1) = 6.7% higher than the actual speed. At an actual speed of 100 km/h (60 mph), the speedometer will indicate 100 x 1.067 = 106.7 km/h (60 * 1.067 = 64.02 mph), approximately.

In the case of wear, a new &quot;185/70R14&quot; tire of 620 mm (24.4 inch) diameter will have ≈8 mm tread depth, at legal limit this reduces to 1.6 mm, the difference being 12.8 mm in diameter or 0.5 inches which is 2% in 620 mm (24.4 inches).

===International agreements===
In many countries the legislated error in speedometer readings is ultimately governed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Regulation 39, which covers those aspects of vehicle type approval that relate to speedometers. The main purpose of the UNECE regulations is to facilitate trade in motor vehicles by agreeing on uniform type approval standards rather than requiring a vehicle model to undergo different approval processes in each country where it is sold.

European Union member states must also grant type approval to vehicles meeting similar EU standards. The ones covering speedometers are similar to the UNECE regulation in that they specify that:

* The indicated speed must never be less than the actual speed, i.e. it should not be possible to inadvertently speed because of an incorrect speedometer reading.
* The indicated speed must not be more than 110 percent of the true speed plus at specified test speeds. For example, at , the indicated speed must be no more than .

The standards specify both the limits on accuracy and many of the details of how it should be measured during the approvals process. For example, the test measurements should be made (for most vehicles) at , and at a particular ambient temperature and road surface. There are slight differences between the different standards, for example in the minimum accuracy of the equipment measuring the true speed of the vehicle.

The UNECE regulation relaxes the requirements for vehicles mass-produced following type approval. At Conformity of Production Audits the upper limit on indicated speed is increased to 110 percent plus for cars, buses, trucks, and similar vehicles, and 110 percent plus for two- or three-wheeled vehicles that have a maximum speed above (or a cylinder capacity, if powered by a heat engine, of more than ). European Union Directive 2000/7/EC, which relates to two- and three-wheeled vehicles, provides similar slightly relaxed limits in production.

===Australia===
There were no Australian Design Rules in place for speedometers in Australia before July 1988. They had to be introduced when speed cameras were first used. This means there are no legally accurate speedometers for these older vehicles. All vehicles manufactured on or after 1 July 2007, and all models of vehicle introduced on or after 1 July 2006, must conform to UNECE Regulation 39.

The speedometers in vehicles manufactured before these dates but after 1 July 1995 (or 1 January 1995 for forward control passenger vehicles and off-road passenger vehicles) must conform to the previous Australian design rule. This specifies that they need only display the speed to an accuracy of ±10% at speeds above 40 km/h, and there is no specified accuracy at all for speeds below 40 km/h. 

All vehicles manufactured in Australia or imported for supply to the Australian market must comply with the Australian Design Rules. The state and territory governments may set policies for the tolerance of speed over the posted speed limits that may be lower than the 10% in the earlier versions of the Australian Design Rules permitted, such as in Victoria. This has caused some controversy since it would be possible for a driver to be unaware that they are speeding should their vehicle be fitted with an under-reading speedometer.

===United Kingdom===
The amended Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 permits the use of speedometers that meet either the requirements of EC Council Directive 75/443 (as amended by Directive 97/39) or UNECE Regulation 39.

The Motor Vehicles (Approval) Regulations 2001 permits single vehicles to be approved. As with the UNECE regulation and the EC Directives, the speedometer must never show an indicated speed less than the actual speed. However, it differs slightly from them in specifying that for all actual speeds between 25 mph and 70 mph (or the vehicles&#x27; maximum speed if it is lower than this), the indicated speed must not exceed 110% of the actual speed, plus 6.25 mph.

For example, if the vehicle is actually traveling at 50 mph, the speedometer must not show more than 61.25 mph or less than 50 mph.

===United States===
Federal standards in the United States allow a maximum 5 mph error at a speed of 50 mph on speedometer readings for commercial vehicles. Aftermarket modifications, such as different tire and wheel sizes or different differential gearing, can cause speedometer inaccuracy.

== Regulation in the US ==
Starting with U.S. automobiles manufactured on or after 1 September 1979, the NHTSA required speedometers to have a special emphasis on 55 mph (90 km/h) and display no more than a maximum speed of 85 mph (136 km/h). On 25 March 1982, the NHTSA revoked the rule because no &quot;significant safety benefits&quot; could come from maintaining the standard.

== GPS ==

GPS devices can measure speeds in two ways:

# The first and simpler method is based on how far the receiver has moved since the last measurement. Such speed calculations are not subject to the same sources of error as the vehicle&#x27;s speedometer (wheel size, transmission/drive ratios). Instead, the GPS&#x27;s positional accuracy, and therefore the accuracy of its calculated speed, is dependent on the satellite signal quality at the time. Speed calculations will be more accurate at higher speeds when the ratio of positional error to positional change is lower. The GPS software may also use a moving average calculation to reduce error. Some GPS devices do not take into account the vertical position of the car so will under-report the speed by the road&#x27;s gradient.
# Alternatively, the GPS may take advantage of the Doppler effect to estimate its velocity. In ideal conditions, the accuracy for commercial devices is within 0.2–0.5 km/h, but it may worsen if the signal quality degrades.

As mentioned in the satnav article, GPS data has been used to overturn a speeding ticket; the GPS logs showed the defendant traveling below the speed limit when they were ticketed. That the data came from a GPS device was likely less important than the fact that it was logged; logs from the vehicle&#x27;s speedometer could likely have been used instead, had they existed.

<text>Roy Asberry Cooper III ( ; born June 13, 1957) is an American attorney and politician who served as the 75th governor of North Carolina from 2017 to 2025. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 50th attorney general of North Carolina from 2001 to 2017, and in the North Carolina General Assembly, in both the House, from 1987 to 1991, and the Senate, from 1991 to 2001.

Cooper graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1979. He began his career as a lawyer and in 1986 was elected to represent the 72nd district in the North Carolina House of Representatives. In 1991, he was appointed a member of the North Carolina Senate, a position he held until 2001. He was elected North Carolina Attorney General in 2000 and reelected in 2004, 2008, and 2012, serving for nearly 16 years, the longest tenure for an attorney general in the state&#x27;s history.

Cooper defeated Republican incumbent Pat McCrory for the governorship in a close race in the 2016 election. This election made Cooper the first challenger to defeat a sitting governor in the state&#x27;s history. Cooper was reelected in 2020 against the Republican nominee, Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest. The Republican-dominated legislature passed bills in a special session to reduce the power of the governor&#x27;s office before he took office, but Cooper continued to emphasize increases in education and healthcare funding throughout his tenure, culminating in successful negotiations of statewide Medicaid expansion.

==Early life and education==
Roy Asberry Cooper III was born in Nashville, North Carolina, on June 13, 1957, to Beverly Thorne () (1929–2013), a teacher and Roy Asberry Cooper II (1927–2015), a lawyer and Democratic Party operative who was a close advisor to Jim Hunt; he later co-chaired Hunt&#x27;s successful 1976 gubernatorial campaign. Cooper attended public schools and worked on his parents&#x27; tobacco farm during summers. He attended Northern Nash High School and as a senior was selected to represent Nash County in the Youth Legislative Assembly. He graduated in 1975.

Cooper received the Morehead Scholarship at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for his undergraduate studies. As an undergraduate at UNC, he was a member of the Chi Psi fraternity and was elected president of the university&#x27;s Young Democrats. He earned a Juris Doctor degree from the University of North Carolina School of Law in 1982.

== Early career ==
While Cooper was still in law school, then-Governor Jim Hunt appointed him to the State Goals and Policy Board, an advisory group that sought to achieve long- and short-range goals and policies for the state. He was the youngest person ever to serve on the board. Hunt also appointed Cooper to the Interim Balance Growth Board and the North Carolina 2000 Commission. He was also a member of the Rocky Mount Chamber of Commerce and UNC-Chapel Hill&#x27;s Board of Visitors.

In 1982, Cooper joined the law firm Fields, Cooper &amp; Henderson in Nashville, North Carolina, the same firm his father had been a founding member of. Three years later, he was named a partner in the firm. In 1984, Cooper served as the Rocky Mount and Nash County chairman of Lauch Faircloth&#x27;s unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign.

===State legislature===

On November 19, 1985, Cooper filed to run for the North Carolina House of Representatives in the 72nd district. He challenged 12-term incumbent Allen Barbee in the Democratic primary and ran on a campaign of supporting agriculture and resolving a school merger dispute in Nash County. Cooper won the primary with 76% of the vote to Barbee&#x27;s 24%, including more than a six times gap in votes for Nash county (5,966 vs 884), and he was unopposed in the general election.

Cooper continued to practice law while serving in the legislature. The nonpartisan North Carolina Center for Public Policy Research ranked him the most effective freshman representative. In January 1989, he joined Republicans and 20 other dissident Democrats to unseat Speaker Liston B. Ramsey in favor of Josephus Mavretic, who appointed Cooper chair of the House Judiciary Committee, of which he had been a member during his first term. Cooper also voted with all House Republicans and 15 Democrats in favor of an unsuccessful attempt to amend the constitution to grant the governor veto power over legislation.

In February 1991, after State Senator Jim Ezzell was killed in a car crash, Cooper was appointed to the Senate to serve the remainder of Ezzell&#x27;s term representing the 10th district, which encompassed parts of Edgecombe, Halifax, Nash, and Wilson Counties. In 1995, Cooper negotiated a compromise bill to schedule a referendum to amend the constitution and grant the governor veto power. In July 1997, he was elected Majority leader of the Senate upon Richard Conder&#x27;s abrupt resignation. During his last term in the Senate, he was elected to the North Carolina Bar Association&#x27;s Board of Governors, a position he held until June 2002.

Cooper&#x27;s accomplishments in the legislature include implementing penalties for minors who bring guns to school, making public records more accessible, toughening the state&#x27;s open meetings law, and giving the governor more veto power.

==North Carolina Attorney General==
===Elections===
In January 2000, Cooper filed with the state Board of Elections to launch a campaign for North Carolina attorney general. In the November general election, he defeated Republican lawyer Dan Boyce and Reform Party candidate Margaret Palms. He took office on January 6, 2001, and was reelected in 2004. He was easily reelected in 2008, defeating Republican Bob Crumley and garnering more votes than any other statewide candidate that year. Cooper ran unopposed for a fourth term in 2012, and received 2,828,941 votes.

Both state and national Democrats attempted to recruit Cooper to run for governor in 2008, the U.S. Senate in 2010, and again for governor in 2012, but he declined each time. A 2009 Public Policy Polling survey matching him against incumbent U.S. Senator Richard Burr showed Cooper leading Burr by four points.

===Tenure===

In 2001, Cooper initiated legislation that established new mentoring and tutoring programs for middle and high school students out on short-term suspension. Governor Mike Easley signed the bill in June of that year.

In 2002, a controversy arose after the North Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles was accused of covering up the speeding citation issued for Democratic U.S. House candidate James Ferguson during the 2000 campaign, and the North Carolina Republican Party called on Cooper to launch an investigation. Faced with potential fallout for investigating members of his own party, Cooper called on federal prosecutors to convene an investigative grand jury, arguing that they had powers to compel testimony not available to the state.

In January 2007, when Durham District Attorney Mike Nifong asked to be recused from dealing with the Duke lacrosse case, Cooper&#x27;s office assumed responsibility for the case. On April 11, 2007, after revelations of Nifong&#x27;s withholding of evidence, fabrications, and other ethics violations, Cooper dismissed the case against the Duke lacrosse team players, taking the extraordinary step of declaring them &quot;innocent&quot; and victims of a &quot;tragic rush to accuse&quot;. The decision won him bipartisan praise. 

Days after the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, Cooper created the Campus Safety Task Force to analyze school shootings and make policy recommendations to help the government prevent and respond to them. The task force delivered its report in January 2008. After the release of its findings, Cooper assisted members of the North Carolina General Assembly in passing a law that required court clerks to record involuntary commitments in a national gun permit database.

After a 2010 decision by a three-judge panel to exonerate Gregory Taylor, who had served nearly 17 years for the first-degree murder of Jaquetta Thomas, Cooper ordered an audit after it was learned that officials at the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation forensic lab had withheld information. This suppression of evidence had contributed to Taylor&#x27;s conviction for murder. The audit was released in 2010; it found that it had been common practice for two decades for a select group of agents at the State Bureau of Investigation to withhold information. In addition, they did not keep up with scientific standards and the latest tests. The two investigators, Chris Swecker and Micheal Fox, cited almost 230 cases tainted by these actions. Three people convicted in such cases had been executed; 80 convicts were still in prison. A massive state effort was undertaken to follow up on their cases.

In 2011 Cooper argued his first case before the United States Supreme Court, &quot;J. D. B. v. North Carolina&quot;, a case related to Miranda rights in juvenile cases. The Court ruled 5–4 against North Carolina.

In 2014, after a major coal ash spill in the Dan River, then-Governor Pat McCrory accused Cooper of politicizing the incident after Cooper criticized Duke Energy, the company responsible for the spill. McCrory later accused Cooper of &quot;fighting against&quot; efforts to clean up the spill, a claim WRAL-TV called &quot;nonexistent&quot;.

==Governor of North Carolina==
===Elections===
====2016====
Cooper ran for governor of North Carolina in the 2016 election against incumbent Republican Pat McCrory. In March 2016, the North Carolina General Assembly passed the Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act—commonly known as &quot;House Bill 2&quot;—which McCrory signed into law. Numerous corporations began boycotting the state in protest of the law, cancelling job investment and expansion plans. Cooper denounced the law as unconstitutional and refused to defend it in court in his capacity as attorney general.

As a result of the economic damage the law caused, McCrory&#x27;s approval rating fell dramatically in the months before the election. When initial election results showed Cooper leading, McCrory claimed without evidence that the election had been manipulated by voter fraud. Recounts resulted in slightly higher margins of victory for Cooper, and after an extended legal battle, McCrory conceded the election on December 5. Out of 4.7 million total ballots, Cooper won by 10,227 votes.

====2020====

On December 5, 2019, Cooper announced his candidacy for reelection. He won the November 3 election, defeating Republican nominee Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest by 4.5 points.

=== Transition ===
Dismayed by Cooper&#x27;s win, in late 2016 the General Assembly passed special legislation before he was inaugurated to reduce the power of the governor&#x27;s office. In what &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as a &quot;surprise special session&quot;, Republican legislators moved to strip Cooper&#x27;s powers before he assumed the governorship. Throughout December, Cooper oversaw an attempt to repeal the Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act. The repeal attempt failed after a deal between state Republican and Democratic lawmakers and Charlotte officials fell apart.

=== Tenure ===

Cooper was sworn in as governor on January 1, 2017, in a small ceremony. His planned public inauguration was canceled due to a snowstorm.

After taking office, as of January 6, 2017, Cooper requested federal approval for Medicaid coverage expansion in North Carolina. Effective January 15, a federal judge halted Cooper&#x27;s request, an order that expired on January 29. In his first months in office, Cooper focused on repealing the Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act. After long negotiations with Republican state legislators, Cooper agreed in late March to sign a law prohibiting North Carolina cities from passing local ordinances pertaining to public accommodations or employment practices for three years in exchange for the reversal of the facilities act. On May 9, 2017, President Donald Trump appointed Cooper to a commission tasked with reducing opioid addiction.

After the Supreme Court of the United States declared North Carolina&#x27;s legislative maps unconstitutional, Cooper called for a special redistricting session on June 7, 2017, but the House and Senate canceled the session, calling it unconstitutional. On June 29, Cooper signed the STOP Act, an overhaul of the prescribing and dispensing regulations of opioids.
On July 1, Cooper signed into law a bill that allows alcohol sales after 10 AM on Sundays, nicknamed the &quot;Brunch Bill&quot;. On July 11, he signed &quot;Britny&#x27;s Law&quot;, which makes homicide first-degree murder if the killing was committed with malice and the defendant has been convicted of domestic violence or stalking the victim. He also signed bills to allow domestic violence protective orders granted by a judge to fully go into effect even when they are under appeal and to expand the state&#x27;s &quot;revenge porn&quot; law from cases involving former lovers to those involving strangers. On July 12, Cooper signed a bill that would add lessons on what to do when pulled over by law enforcement to the state&#x27;s driver&#x27;s education curriculum. The bill passed both chambers unanimously.

On July 26, 2017, Cooper signed a bill to mount cameras on school buses in order to discourage drivers from illegally passing stopped buses. On August 31, 2017, he declared a state of emergency due to plummeting gas supply, which was rescinded on September 18.

Fellow Appalachian governors elected Cooper co-chair of the Appalachian Regional Commission for 2019, making him the first North Carolina governor to co-chair the ARC since Jim Hunt in 1978. In the 2018 elections, the Republican Party lost seats in the General Assembly, ending its supermajorities in both houses and rendering it unable to override gubernatorial vetoes. On March 6, 2019, Cooper proposed a $25.2 billion budget for the year. It included salary increases for public school teachers and state workers, expansion of Medicaid, and a $3.9 billion bond (subject to a referendum) to help fund school construction and local infrastructure projects. Cooper said that he was confident he could get the legislature, without enough Republican members to override a veto, to implement some of his ideas.

On February 11, 2020, Cooper announced the creation of a Novel Coronavirus Task Force for North Carolina ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 10, Cooper declared a state of emergency after the seventh reported case was identified in the state. Four days later, he issued an executive order banning gatherings of over 100 people, and closed all K-12 schools for two weeks. In June, he imposed a statewide face mask requirement for all areas open to the public.

It was speculated that Cooper might run for the U.S. Senate seat held by retiring Republican Richard Burr in 2022, but he announced in March 2021 that he would not.

On March 27, 2023, Cooper signed into law landmark legislation expanding Medicaid after the Republican-controlled General Assembly passed the bill through both houses, despite almost a decade of GOP opposition. It is estimated that over 600,000 low-income North Carolinians will become eligible for the state&#x27;s Medicaid program.

After President Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential election and Vice President Kamala Harris announced her presidential campaign in July 2024, Cooper was named as a possible running mate for her. He was reportedly seriously considered for the position and received vetting materials during the process, but on July 29, he withdrew his name from consideration without giving a reason.

On December 31, 2024, a day before leaving office, Cooper commuted the sentences of 15 inmates on North Carolina&#x27;s death row. Cooper was succeeded by Josh Stein.

====Vetoes====

During his first two years in office, Cooper faced a Republican supermajority in the General Assembly capable of overriding his vetoes, thereby limiting his legislative influence. His first veto as governor was of a bill that would make elections to the North Carolina Superior Court and to the District Court partisan, after being conducted on a nonpartisan basis for many years. The House overrode the veto on March 22, 2017. The Senate followed suit on March 23, resulting in the bill becoming law over Cooper&#x27;s objection.

Cooper vetoed a bill on April 21, 2017, to reduce the size of the North Carolina Court of Appeals by three judges. The veto was overridden on April 26. He also vetoed a bill on April 21, 2017, that would create a new State Board of Elections (and new county boards of elections) split evenly between the Republicans and the Democrats. It would replace the longstanding system that gave the governor&#x27;s party a majority on the board. Both houses of the legislature voted to override the veto on April 24 and 25.

Cooper also vetoed a bill that would limit individuals&#x27; ability to sue hog farms. The legislature also overrode this veto. On June 27, Cooper vetoed the proposed state budget, which he had called &quot;irresponsible&quot; the day before. In his veto message, he cited the budget&#x27;s income tax cuts and argued it &quot;lacks structural integrity by failing to account for population growth, inflation and looming federal reductions, by using one-time revenue for recurring expenses, and by adopting a tax plan that will cause the state to fail to fund promised teacher salary increases in future years&quot;. He said the proposed bill included &quot;provisions that infringe upon the governor&#x27;s ability to faithfully execute the laws, including the administration of this Act, as required by the Constitution, and violating the separation of powers&quot;. The legislature overrode his veto the next day.

In July 2017, Cooper vetoed a bill to authorize nonprofit organizations to operate &quot;game nights&quot;, saying it would unintentionally create a new opportunity for the video poker industry.

In December 2018, the North Carolina General Assembly passed a bill that would require new primary elections if a do-over election was called in the 9th district election. Cooper vetoed the bill due to a provision that made campaign finance investigations less public, but the General Assembly overrode his veto. In total, during his first two years in office, Cooper vetoed 28 bills, 23 of which were overridden by the legislature. As a result of the 2018 legislative elections, the Republicans lost their supermajority in the General Assembly, thus giving Cooper and legislative Democrats more leverage in legislative negotiations.

In May 2019, Cooper vetoed a bill that proposed punishments in the form of prison time and fines against physicians and nurses who do not resuscitate newborns that survive an abortion. He said that the &quot;bill is an unnecessary interference between doctors and their patients&quot; and that laws &quot;already protect newborn babies&quot;.

==Personal life==

Roy Cooper is married to Kristin Cooper (née Bernhardt), who worked as a guardian ad litem for foster children in Wake County. They have three daughters, who all graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Cooper has taught Sunday school classes, serving as a deacon and elder at White Memorial Presbyterian Church, and is an avid fan of the NHL&#x27;s Carolina Hurricanes.

Cooper has accepted a teaching position at Harvard University.

===Pronunciation of surname===
In 2023, Cooper said that his last name should actually be pronounced , with the letters &quot;oo&quot; resembling the &quot;oo&quot; sound in &quot;foot&quot;, as opposed to the more conventional , which most people have called him for many years. He explained that the former is a local pronunciation of &quot;Cooper&quot; in Eastern North Carolina, where he grew up in Nash County, and his name was always said this way until he went to college. But he said that he is fine with people using the latter, more common pronunciation.

<doc id="576689" wikidata="Q4634100" url="?curid=576689" title="March 19 shooting incident">
<text>The March 19 shooting incident (), also known as the 319 incident, was an assassination attempt on President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu while they were campaigning in Tainan, Taiwan on 19 March 2004, the day before Taiwan&#x27;s presidential election. Their injuries were not life-threatening, and both Chen and Lu were released from Chi-Mei Hospital on the same day without losing consciousness or undergoing surgery.

The attack provoked shock and unease in Taiwan, where political violence of this kind was commonplace against non-KMT members 40 years earlier. The Taiwan dollar fell by 0.2 percent but quickly recovered.

Reaction to the incident divided along partisan lines. Some including Lu pointed to Beijing and the People&#x27;s Republic of China for orchestrating the attack because of her and Chen&#x27;s stance supporting Taiwanese independence from the mainland. By contrast their election opponent, Lien Chan, supported by the Pan-Blue Coalition, was a supporter for integration with the mainland. The opposing Pan-Blue supporters believed that the incident was faked in order to win the sympathy of voters in the upcoming election, which Chen and Lu won by 29,500 votes. Several forensic studies, including one conducted by an American team, showed that the gun wounds were real.

In August 2005, the case was officially closed with all evidence pointing to a single deceased suspect, Chen Yi-hsiung.

==Sequence of events==
President Chen and Vice President Lu were standing in the back seat of an open convertible Jeep moving slowly through a crowded street when around 1:45 pm, a bullet penetrated the windshield of the vehicle, grazed Chen&#x27;s stomach, and was stopped in his clothes. Chen received a flesh wound long and wide. The other bullet penetrated the windshield and hit a cast on Lu&#x27;s knee which she was wearing due to an earlier injury and was later found in the vehicle. Wang Hsin-nan, a lawyer traveling with Chen, also confirmed the shots.

At first both believed that they had been hit by firecrackers, which are common in Taiwanese political parades and rallies. Chen realized that it was something more serious when he noticed that he was bleeding from the abdomen and that there was a bullet hole in the window. Chen reported pain in his abdomen and Lu reported pain in her knee and they were taken to the Chi-Mei Hospital. At 3:30 pm, the spokesperson for the president, Chiou I-jen, announced that the &quot;National Security Mechanism&quot; had been activated. By 5:30 pm, both the Pan-Blue and Pan-Green coalitions announced that they would cease all scheduled campaigning activities.

At 5:45 pm, the hospital announced that the president had suffered an long and wide gash across his abdomen. Around 6:00 pm, two shells were found on the campaign route where the shooting took place. Pictures of Chen&#x27;s scars were also displayed publicly.

The president returned to his official residence by 9:00 pm and, in a video released to the public, he urged the Taiwanese people to remain calm and indicated that neither his health nor the security of Taiwan was threatened.

The next day&#x27;s election was not postponed, as Taiwanese law only allows for suspension of an election on the death of a candidate. Chen&#x27;s opponent, Lien Chan, and Lien&#x27;s campaign manager Wang Jin-pyng tried to visit Chen on the night of the incident, but were unable to see the president because he was resting. Chen appeared in public the next day when he turned out to cast his vote.

==Investigation==
Within hours, police announced that the crime was not political, and that the People&#x27;s Republic of China was not involved. Some Pan-Blue supporters theorized that the incident was staged in order for Chen to gain sympathy votes, while some Pan-Green supporters theorized that the assassination was a plot of China.

These speculations were considered highly offensive by both camps and were not condoned by the leaderships of the two sides until after Chen had already won the election.

Two bullet casings were found by a civilian under a police car after it was driven away. The casings found suggested that only two shots were fired at the motorcade. Their assembly also suggested that they were fired from home-made guns. It is unclear as to whether they were fired from the same gun, or from different guns.

The police did not find or identify any suspect involved in the shooting. There were several people the police wanted to question based on erratic behavior, such as leaving the scene in a hurry as recorded by surveillance camera. A few people showed up after they recognized themselves on the broadcast footage, but these proved to be inconclusive.

The bullet trajectory proposed by the police suggested that a bullet struck the windshield, entered Lu&#x27;s knee, and then fell out. Another bullet fired from the Jeep&#x27;s side struck Chen&#x27;s stomach and traveled through his jacket and lodged in the rear of the jacket until recovered by the hospital staff.

===Conclusion===
On 29 March 2004 three American forensic scientists arrived in Taiwan to help with the investigation. They were Cyril Wecht, a forensic expert, Michael Haag, an expert on bullet trajectory, and Timothy Palmbach, an expert on crime scene integrity. Wecht personally examined Chen&#x27;s belly and concluded it was consistent with a gunshot wound.

They were followed by Henry C. Lee on 9 April 2004. After examining the Jeep, he deduced that the shots were fired from the outside because there were shards of glass on the Jeep&#x27;s floor. But due to the incompleteness of evidence preservation, and the lack of an accurate record on the Jeep&#x27;s speed at the day of procession, he pointed out that it might be impossible to determine from which direction the bullets entered the Jeep.

Interior Minister Yu Cheng-hsien announced his resignation on 4 April 2004, and National Security Bureau director Tsai Chao-ming stepped down the week before to take responsibility for the shooting, in keeping with the Taiwanese tradition that government officials take responsibility for perceived or implied dereliction of duty.

From 10 to 20 June 2004, a group of former Combined Logistics Command engineers, including former Olympian Chen An-hu, took part in the investigation by simulating the shooting in a Los Angeles shooting range.

On 24 August 2004, the Pan-Blue controlled Legislative Yuan approved legislation setting up the &quot;3–19 truth investigative commission&quot; to probe the shooting. Members of the commission were selected to reflect the political composition of the Fifth Legislative Yuan. The commission had the right to interview government officials and demand documents, and later presented its findings to the legislature. The law suspended the right to silence and forbid influencing the commission&#x27;s investigation. The commission was also authorized to command a government prosecuting attorney, to unilaterally utilize the disaster reserve funds from the Executive Yuan, and to override court verdicts. Because such a law was suspected unconstitutional, the Pan-Green Coalition opposed the commission.

Forensic scientist Henry Lee submitted a 130-page report and a CD containing 150 photos to Andrew Hsia, director general of Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York on 29 August 2004. He concluded that the incident was not a political assassination attempt because &quot;a more powerful weapon than a homemade pistol would have been used.&quot; He was unable to make a conclusive report, but indicated his findings would help locate the gun and its factory. Lee&#x27;s findings prompted immediate outrage from conspiracy theorists as it did not fit well with either side.

On 9 September 2004, three men – Yeh Ho-chiang, 37, Chen Ching-hung, 33, and Huang Chin-shou, 43 – were arrested at an illegal weapons factory near Tainan possessing bullets matching those found at the crime scene.

On 7 March 2005, Taiwanese police held a conference about the shooting incident. Two suspects were named; Chen Yi-hsiung and Huang Hung-Ren. Both of them were found dead shortly after the 3–19 incident. Chen was living in the vicinity and resembled one of the unknown persons shown on police tapes in the hot zone (the &quot;yellow coat bald guy&quot;). The tape was released by the police on 26 March 2004, and Chen was found drowned in a harbor on March 28. The connection between Chen and the weapon maker was established by confirming Chen as being the 5th hand of a possible weapon; additionally family members of Chen stated that he left suicide notes, which according to the Taiwanese police&#x27;s interpretation hinted that he committed the crime, although the notes had been burned by the family, and the interpretation held by the police is at best tenuous. Additionally the family members were reported to have recalled strange behavior of Chen following the 3–19 shooting. On the other hand, Huang also committed suicide with a gun that was made from the same manufacturer as that of the incident, and the bullet found shared traits with the one that hit the vice-president.

A fisherman reported to have seen Chen &quot;with the suspected agents near Anping Harbor on March 26 and 27, 2004 — a few days prior to Chen Yi-hsiung’s death — seeking to rent a boat from the fisherman, possibly to use it to escape.&quot;

On 17 August 2005, the case was officially closed after the investigators concluded that Chen acted alone. However, there continue to be lingering doubts among a substantial part of the population of both sides. Lien, who happened to be leaving office as KMT chairman on the same day, publicly expressed disbelief. A &quot;China Times&quot; poll purportedly showed that only 19% of the surveyed persons believe that there had been a sufficiently thorough investigation. Pan-Blue legislators have called for continued investigation of the case, as has Vice President Lu.

==Aftermath==
Lu &quot;cited exiled Chinese academic Yuan Hongbing as saying that Beijing might have plotted the assassination to polarize Taiwan as part of its scheme to annex the nation.&quot; Allegedly, Hu Jintao and PLA officer Xin Qi plotted to injure Chen and Lu without fatally wounding them. Moreover, it was aimed &quot;at damaging Taiwan&#x27;s democracy and making Taiwanese believe that elections were rigged, but it had to see Chen Shui-bian and Lu re-elected so that the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT), losing power and authority, would be willing to succumb to China.&quot;

Some pan-Blue supporters painted the incident as a sham staged to boost sympathy for Chen and win the election, arguing that the wounds inflicted upon the President and Vice President were improbably light and citing various perceived irregularities in the chronology of events and the physical and photographic evidence.

The Pan-Blue claimed the activation of National Security Mechanism after the incident recalls military and police personnels on leave, which may have affected the election&#x27;s outcome as the recalled personnels were not able to vote. The court refuted the claim because the military and police said the number of staying personnel was not affected.

==In popular culture==
The incident was dramatized in the film (2019), directed by Fu Changfeng.

<text>The siciliana or siciliano (also known as sicilienne or ciciliano) is a musical style or genre often included as a movement within larger pieces of music starting in the Baroque period. It is in a slow or time with lilting rhythms, making it somewhat resemble a slow jig or tarantella, and is usually in a minor key. It was used for arias in Baroque operas, and often appears as a movement in instrumental works. Loosely associated with Sicily, the siciliana evokes a pastoral mood, and is often characterized by dotted rhythms that can distinguish it within the broader musical genre of the pastorale.

==History and notable examples==
In a 2006 book, Raymond Monelle found musicologists&#x27; attempts to trace the style to any authentic tradition in Sicily inconclusive, though he did trace its origins back to Italian Renaissance madrigals from the 1500s, in triple time with dotted rhythms. These madrigal rhythms may themselves derive from the dactylic hexameter of the epic poetry of ancient Greece and Rome.

===Baroque era===
The siciliana was firmly established as a signifier of a pastoral context in the operas of Sicilian-born Alessandro Scarlatti, though only two of his slow arias in are actually titled &quot;aria siciliana&quot; in the scores. Monelle notes that the texts of Scarlatti&#x27;s siciliana arias are generally lamenting and melancholic. Several written references to the genre are known from earlier in the 1600s; and sicilianas are described in musical dictionaries since 1703.

Further examples of Baroque sicilianas are found in J. S. Bach&#x27;s music: for instance, in his Sonata in G minor for solo violin, BWV 1001, in his Sonata in E-flat for flute and harpsichord, BWV 1031, and in his Concerto in E for harpsichord and strings, BWV 1053. Other well-known Baroque sicilianas are: the middle movement of Antonio Vivaldi&#x27;s Concerto Grosso, Op. 3, No. 11, from L&#x27;estro armonico (which Bach then transcribed as his Concerto in D minor for organ, BWV 596), the first movement of Giuseppe Tartini&#x27;s &quot;Devil&#x27;s Trill Sonata&quot; for violin, and the last movement of Arcangelo Corelli&#x27;s Christmas Concerto, Op. 6, No. 8.

===Classical era===

Works in siciliana rhythm appear occasionally in the Classical period. Joseph Haydn, perhaps inspired by the bucolic associations of the genre, wrote a siciliana aria for soprano in his oratorio &quot;The Creation&quot;, &quot;Nun beut die Flur das frische Grün&quot; (&quot;With verdure clad the fields appear&quot;), to celebrate the creation of plants. For Mozart, the hesitating rhythm of the siciliana lent itself to the portrayal of grief, and some of Mozart&#x27;s most powerful musical utterances are tragic sicilianas: the aria for soprano &quot;Ach, ich fühl&#x27;s, es ist verschwunden&quot; (&quot;Ah, my heart, &#x27;tis gone forever&quot;) from &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, the F-sharp minor slow movement of the Piano Concerto, K. 488, the F minor Adagio from the Piano Sonata, K. 280, and the finale of the String Quartet in D minor, K. 421. In a more cheerful A major, he used a siciliana as the opening theme of his Piano Sonata, K. 331.

Other examples of Classical sicilianas are the third movement of Domenico Cimarosa&#x27;s Oboe Concerto, the last movement of Carl Maria von Weber&#x27;s Violin Sonata No. 5, and the second movement of Anton Reicha&#x27;s Clarinet Quintet in F major, Op. 107.

The guitar virtuoso Mauro Giuliani (1781–1829) was very fond of the siciliana style and frequently composed in it. A notable example is the second movement of his Guitar Concerto No. 1 in A major, Op. 30. Another siciliana written for guitar (with vocal) is Franz Xaver Gruber&#x27;s renowned Christmas carol, &quot;Silent Night&quot;.

===Romantic era===
At the beginning of the Romantic period, John Field inserted a refined siciliana (&quot;Siciliano&quot;) in G minor in his Fourth Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (1814). Bernhard Crusell used a &quot;siciliano&quot; as a slow part in one of his clarinet duets (1821). Later in the Romantic era, Brahms wrote a siciliana as the 19th variation in his Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel for solo piano (1861). In another set of variations by Brahms, the orchestral Variations on a Theme by Haydn (1873), the seventh variation also takes the form of a siciliana. The second of Moritz Moszkowski&#x27;s &quot;Trois Morceaux poétiques&quot;, Op. 42 (1887), is a &quot;Siciliano&quot;.

Hélène&#x27;s aria, &quot;Merci, jeunes amies&quot; (&quot;Thank you, beloved friends&quot;) from Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Les vêpres siciliennes&quot; is another example of a siciliana, suited to its setting, and is referred to as such in the score, even though it is popularly called a bolero. The opening aria of Mascagni&#x27;s masterpiece &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; is the Siciliana &quot;O Lola&quot;.

Ernest Chausson composed a sicilienne as the second movement of his Concerto for Piano, Violin, and String Quartet, Op. 21 (1892). The orchestral suite from &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; by Gabriel Fauré includes his well-known Sicilienne, which he had composed for an incomplete project in 1893.

===20th–21st centuries===
Examples of sicilianas in 20th-century music include Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s Serenata from his ballet &quot;Pulcinella&quot;, Ottorino Respighi&#x27;s Siciliana from &quot;Ancient Airs and Dances&quot;, Suite No. 3, and Malcolm Arnold&#x27;s Siciliano from the Little Suite No. 1 for Brass. Sergei Rachmaninoff utilized siciliana style and rhythms in three of his Op. 32 Preludes for piano: the B-flat minor (No. 2), the B minor (No. 10), and the B major (No. 11). Maurice Duruflé&#x27;s Suite for Organ (Op. 5) contains a Sicilienne notable for its Impressionist harmonies, and another prominent example is the middle movement of Paul Hindemith&#x27;s Organ Sonata No. 2.

Hungarian composer György Kurtág references the style in a surprising way in his 1987 magnum opus, &quot;Kafka-Fragmente&quot; Op. 24, for soprano and violin in the movement &quot;Der wahre Weg&quot; (&quot;The true path&quot;). Nino Rota&#x27;s &quot;Godfather Waltz&quot; is a classic siciliana at the start of his Grammy-winning score for the 1972 film. &quot;Hedwig&#x27;s Theme&quot;, composed by John Williams for the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films, is also in the siciliana genre, with a particular similarity to Fauré&#x27;s Sicilienne. Other notable examples of siciliana style include the &quot;Intrada&quot; and &quot;Rhapsody&quot; from Gerald Finzi&#x27;s 1939 cantata &quot;Dies Natalis&quot;.

<text>Milkis () is a Korean soft drink produced by Lotte Chilsung, a South Korean beverage company. 

It combines many of the common elements of traditional carbonated beverages such as sugar and carbonated water with milk to create a creamy taste; its label proclaims &quot;New feeling of soda beverage&quot;. As of 2024, U.S.-market Milkis cans state &quot;Korea&#x27;s No. 1 Cream Soda&quot;. 

Milkis is available in orange, strawberry, mango, melon, banana, peach, apple, and classic (regular) flavors; the classic flavor is also featured as a glaze in pastries. It is a popular beverage in South Korea, and it is available worldwide.

==History==
Milkis launched in 1989 with a huge marketing campaign, notably with the appearance of Hong Kong actor Chow Yun-fat in its television advertisements. Chow was enjoying huge popularity from the success of the film &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; and his saying the catchphrase &quot;&quot;Saranghaeyo&quot;, Milkis!&quot; (Korean: 사랑해요, 밀키스!, literally &quot;I love you, Milkis!&quot;) in his strong accent became a huge hit; sales soared and the catchphrase remains as one of the most popular.

== Popularity abroad ==
The beverage has experienced a sharp increase in popularity in Taiwan. Chilsung began selling Milkis there in late 2020, exporting 200,000 cans. Demand increased rapidly, selling 2.3 million cans in 2021. 10 million cans were sold in the first 8 months of 2022 alone.

The drink has also seen success in the United States, selling 10 million cans in 2021, mainly through Asian supermarkets.

<doc id="576694" wikidata="Q310425" url="?curid=576694" title="C-terminus">
<text>The C-terminus (also known as the carboxyl-terminus, carboxy-terminus, C-terminal tail, carboxy tail, C-terminal end, or COOH-terminus) is the end of an amino acid chain (protein or polypeptide), terminated by a free carboxyl group (-COOH). When the protein is translated from messenger RNA, it is created from N-terminus to C-terminus. The convention for writing peptide sequences is to put the C-terminal end on the right and write the sequence from N- to C-terminus.

==Chemistry==
Each amino acid has a carboxyl group and an amine group. Amino acids link to one another to form a chain by a dehydration reaction which joins the amine group of one amino acid to the carboxyl group of the next. Thus polypeptide chains have an end with an unbound carboxyl group, the C-terminus, and an end with an unbound amine group, the N-terminus. Proteins are naturally synthesized starting from the N-terminus and ending at the C-terminus.

==Function==
===C-terminal retention signals===
While the N-terminus of a protein often contains targeting signals, the C-terminus can contain retention signals for protein sorting. The most common ER retention signal is the amino acid sequence -KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) or -HDEL (His-Asp-Glu-Leu) at the C-terminus. This keeps the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum and prevents it from entering the secretory pathway.

===Peroxisomal targeting signal===

The sequence -SKL (Ser-Lys-Leu) or similar near C-terminus serves as peroxisomal targeting signal 1, directing the protein into peroxisome.

===C-terminal modifications===
The C-terminus of proteins can be modified posttranslationally, most commonly by the addition of a lipid anchor to the C-terminus that allows the protein to be inserted into a membrane without having a transmembrane domain.

====Prenylation====

One form of C-terminal modification is prenylation. During prenylation, a farnesyl- or geranylgeranyl-isoprenoid membrane anchor is added to a cysteine residue near the C-terminus. Small, membrane-bound G proteins are often modified this way.

====GPI anchors====

Another form of C-terminal modification is the addition of a phosphoglycan, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), as a membrane anchor. The GPI anchor is attached to the C-terminus after proteolytic cleavage of a C-terminal propeptide. The most prominent example for this type of modification is the prion protein.

====Methylation====

C-terminal leucine is methylated at carboxyl group by enzyme leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 1 in vertebrates, forming methyl ester.

===C-terminal domain===
The C-terminal domain of some proteins has specialized functions. In humans, the CTD of RNA polymerase II typically consists of up to 52 repeats of the sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser. This allows other proteins to bind to the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase in order to activate polymerase activity. These domains are then involved in the initiation of DNA transcription, the capping of the RNA transcript, and attachment to the spliceosome for RNA splicing.

<doc id="576696" wikidata="Q16149677" url="?curid=576696" title="List of people granted honorary French citizenship during the French Revolution">
<text>During the French Revolution, France granted honorary citizenships to foreigners deemed champions of the revolutionary cause: to eighteen people on 26 August 1792 and to three more people throughout 1793. Three of them, Thomas Paine, Anacharsis Cloots and Joel Barlow, subsequently became naturalized citizens.

==Background==
During the French Revolution, the Constitution of 1791 was adopted. Article 4 of Title II allowed the legislature to grant foreigners exceptional naturalizations, under special circumstances. The abolition of the monarchy on 10 August 1792 caused the diplomatic isolation of France. The revolutionaries sought &quot;a further morale-boosting endorsement of their actions&quot; by adopting foreign thinkers as French citizens, to show that the most enlightened minds support the revolution. Marie-Joseph Chénier proposed &quot;the adoption of those who in the various countries of the world have ripened human reason and prepared the paths of liberty&quot; on 24 August.

==List of honored foreigners==
===26 August 1792===

On 26 August 1792, the Legislative Assembly of France granted honorary citizenship to eighteen foreigners deemed champions of the cause (&quot;these men who, by their writing and by their courage, have served the cause of liberty and prepared the liberation of peoples&quot;). The list consisted of:

*Jeremy Bentham 
*Joachim Heinrich Campe 
*Thomas Clarkson 
*Anacharsis Cloots 
*Cornelius de Pauw 
*Alexander Hamilton 
*Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock 
*Tadeusz Kościuszko 
*James Mackintosh 
*James Madison 
*Thomas Paine 
*Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi 
*Joseph Priestley
*George Washington 
*William Wilberforce 
*David Williams
Friedrich Schiller (introduced as &quot;sir Giller, the German publicist&quot; with no first name) was also included in an amendment on that day, due to a Legislative Assembly member&#x27;s request. Ten of the recipients were from English-speaking countries. Joseph Priestley&#x27;s son William had been granted citizenship earlier, on 8 June 1792, in recognition of his father&#x27;s accomplishments. 

James Madison and Thomas Paine enthusiastically accepted the honorary citizenship. Nobody turned down the offer, the conservative William Wilberforce &quot;prudently failed to reply&quot;.

French politicians Claude Basire and Jacques-Alexis Thuriot opposed the decree, doubting the loyalty of these foreigners, who could now hold public office in the country. Most of the Assembly did not share their sentiments. The decree signified &quot;openness to foreigners and a universalist outlook&quot;.

===25 September 1792 proposal and 1793===
On 25 September 1792, Joel Barlow, Thomas Christie, Thomas Cooper, John Horne Tooke, John Oswald, George Rous and Joseph Warner were proposed to a committee to be commended like the previous group, however nothing came of it. Barlow was American, while the rest were British. Afterwards, only three honorary citizenship decrees were made: for Joel Barlow on 17 February 1793, Philippe Buonarroti on 27 May 1793, and the Belgian Pierre Plouvier on 10 June 1793.

==Subsequent events==
The recipients could only become naturalized citizens upon taking up legal residence in France (and also swearing the civic oath). Two people from the 26 August decree, Thomas Paine and Anacharsis Cloots, fulfilled those requirements; both were also elected to become members of the National Convention. Joel Barlow also became a naturalized citizen, in February 1793. As the War of the First Coalition progressed, the war and internal factional conflicts gave rise to xenophobic nationalism. Various decrees limiting the rights of foreigners were passed, such as one on 25 December 1793 that prohibited them from representing the French people (thus making Paine and Cloots lose their Convention membership). During the 1793–1794 Reign of Terror, Paine was imprisoned and Cloots was executed on the guillotine. As France was at war with Great Britain, Paine was now considered an enemy subject due to his original British citizenship. He was only freed when James Monroe, the American ambassador to France, recognized him as a citizen of the United States. Jeremy Bentham, using his honorary citizenship, voted to give life consulship to Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802.

<doc id="576704" wikidata="Q284398" url="?curid=576704" title="N-terminus">
<text>The N-terminus (also known as the amino-terminus, NH2-terminus, N-terminal end or amine-terminus) is the start of a protein or polypeptide, referring to the free amine group (-NH2) located at the end of a polypeptide. Within a peptide, the amine group is bonded to the carboxylic group of another amino acid, making it a chain. That leaves a free carboxylic group at one end of the peptide, called the C-terminus, and a free amine group on the other end called the N-terminus. By convention, peptide sequences are written N-terminus to C-terminus, left to right (in LTR writing systems). This correlates the translation direction to the text direction, because when a protein is translated from messenger RNA, it is created from the N-terminus to the C-terminus, as amino acids are added to the carboxyl end of the protein.

==Chemistry==
Each amino acid has an amine group and a carboxylic group. Amino acids link to one another by peptide bonds which form through a dehydration reaction that joins the carboxyl group of one amino acid to the amine group of the next in a head-to-tail manner to form a polypeptide chain. The chain has two ends – an amine group, the N-terminus, and an unbound carboxyl group, the C-terminus.

When a protein is translated from messenger RNA, it is created from N-terminus to C-terminus. The amino end of an amino acid (on a charged tRNA) during the elongation stage of translation, attaches to the carboxyl end of the growing chain. Since the start codon of the genetic code codes for the amino acid methionine, most protein sequences start with a methionine (or, in bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts, the modified version &quot;N&quot;-formylmethionine, fMet). However, some proteins are modified posttranslationally, for example, by cleavage from a protein precursor, and therefore may have different amino acids at their N-terminus.

==Function==

===N-terminal targeting signals===
The N-terminus is the first part of the protein that exits the ribosome during protein biosynthesis. It often contains signal peptide sequences, &quot;intracellular postal codes&quot; that direct delivery of the protein to the proper organelle. The signal peptide is typically removed at the destination by a signal peptidase. The N-terminal amino acid of a protein is an important determinant of its half-life (likelihood of being degraded). This is called the N-end rule.

====Signal peptide====

The N-terminal signal peptide is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP) and results in the targeting of the protein to the secretory pathway. In eukaryotic cells, these proteins are synthesized at the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In prokaryotic cells, the proteins are exported across the cell membrane. In chloroplasts, signal peptides target proteins to the thylakoids.

====Mitochondrial targeting peptide====
The N-terminal mitochondrial targeting peptide (mtTP) allows the protein to be imported into the mitochondrion.

====Chloroplast targeting peptide====
The N-terminal chloroplast targeting peptide (cpTP) allows for the protein to be imported into the chloroplast.

==N-terminal modifications==
Protein N-termini can be modified co - or post-translationally. Modifications include the removal of initiator methionine (iMet) by aminopeptidases, attachment of small chemical groups such as acetyl, propionyl and methyl, and the addition of membrane anchors, such as palmitoyl and myristoyl groups

===N-terminal acetylation===

N-terminal acetylation is a form of protein modification that can occur in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It has been suggested that N-terminal acetylation can prevent a protein from following a secretory pathway.

===N-Myristoylation===
The N-terminus can be modified by the addition of a myristoyl anchor. Proteins that are modified this way contain a consensus motif at their N-terminus as a modification signal.

===N-Acylation===
The N-terminus can also be modified by the addition of a fatty acid anchor to form N-acetylated proteins. The most common form of such modification is the addition of a palmitoyl group.

<doc id="576712" wikidata="Q4661865" url="?curid=576712" title="Aaron Boone">
<text>Aaron John Boone (born March 9, 1973) is an American professional baseball manager and former infielder who is the manager of the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played in MLB for 13 seasons from 1997 to 2009. As a player, Boone is most recognized for his 2003 campaign with the Yankees, during which he hit the winning walk-off home run of the 2003 American League Championship Series.

Following the conclusion of his playing career, Boone was an analyst for ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; and &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot; from 2010 to 2017. He began serving as the Yankees&#x27; manager in 2018, leading the team to two 100-win records during his first two seasons and playoff appearances in the first five. In 2024, Boone led the team to their first World Series appearance since 2009 and lost.

==Early life==
Boone attended Villa Park High School in Villa Park, California. He batted .423 with 22 stolen bases for the school&#x27;s baseball team in his senior year, and was named the Century League&#x27;s co-player of the year. The California Angels selected Boone on the third day of the 1991 MLB draft, but he had no intention to sign a professional contract.

==College career==
He attended the University of Southern California (USC) and played college baseball for the USC Trojans. In 1993, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League, where he was named a league all-star and helped lead Orleans to the league championship.

==Professional career==

===Cincinnati Reds (1997–2003)===
The Cincinnati Reds selected Boone in the third round of the 1994 MLB draft. Boone made his MLB debut in June 1997, and was ejected from the game after being called out sliding into home. On the last day of the 1998 season, the Reds started the only MLB infield composed of two sets of brothers: first baseman Stephen Larkin, second baseman Bret Boone, shortstop Barry Larkin, and third baseman Aaron Boone.

On September 22, 2002, Boone hit the last home run in Riverfront Stadium in the eighth inning of the Reds&#x27; 4–3 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies, a solo home run off reliever Dan Plesac. Boone hit a career-high 26 home runs in 2002, playing in all 162 games. The Reds named Boone their team&#x27;s most valuable player. He appeared in the 2003 MLB All-Star Game.

===New York Yankees (2003)===
The New York Yankees acquired Boone from the Reds for Brandon Claussen, Charlie Manning, and cash on July 31, 2003. In 54 games after the trade, he hit .254 with a .720 OPS, six home runs and 31 RBIs.

During Game 7 of the 2003 American League Championship Series (ALCS), Boone hit a walk-off home run in the 11th inning, off Tim Wakefield, which gave the Yankees a 6–5 victory over the Boston Red Sox, thus prolonging the Curse of the Bambino. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; dubbed the play the &quot;Curse of the Boonebino&quot;. This home run was rated the ninth-best home run of all time on &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot;. Afterward, some Red Sox fans called Boone &quot;Aaron Fucking Boone,&quot; much as they called Bucky Dent &quot;Bucky Fucking Dent.&quot;

In January 2004, Boone tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during a pick-up basketball game. The game violated the standard MLB player contract, which forbids taking part in off-season basketball, skiing, and surfing. The Yankees immediately hinted that they would terminate his contract.
Soon after trading for Alex Rodriguez to play third base, the Yankees released Boone on February 27, 2004.

===Cleveland Indians (2005–2006)===
Boone signed a two-year contract with the Cleveland Indians in June 2004. He earned $600,000 for 2004, $3 million for the 2005 season, and a club option for the 2006 season worth $4.5 million. After missing the entire 2004 season, Boone played 154 games in 2005. He batted .243 with 16 home runs and 60 RBIs. The Indians exercised an option on Boone&#x27;s contract for the 2006 season. In his second season with Cleveland, he batted .251 with seven home runs.

===Florida Marlins (2007)===

On December 29, 2006, Boone signed a one-year contract with the Florida Marlins worth $925,000. He batted .286 in 69 games for the Marlins in 2007.

===Washington Nationals (2008)===
On December 6, 2007, Boone signed a one-year, $1,000,000 contract with the Washington Nationals. In 104 games, Boone hit .241 with 6 home runs and 28 RBIs in 2008.

===Houston Astros (2009)===
On December 18, 2008, Boone signed a one-year $750,000, plus incentives, deal with the Houston Astros. He played in only 10 games in 2009, reaching base only once—on a hit by pitch—in 14 plate appearances.

In March 2009, Boone underwent open-heart surgery to replace a bicuspid aortic valve, a condition that he has been aware of since childhood, but which routine tests indicated had recently worsened. Boone stated that doctors told him he could play baseball when he recovered, but he was not sure if he would choose to do so. Boone returned to baseball on August 10, when he began his rehabilitation with the Corpus Christi Hooks, the Astros&#x27; Double-A minor league affiliate. He played five innings and was hitless in two plate appearances. Boone stated after the game that his goal was to return to the major leagues by September 1, the date that major league rosters expand. Boone was activated on September 1, and added to the Astros&#x27; expanded roster. On September 2, Boone made his season debut, playing at first base and going 0 for 3. On September 16, Boone stated that he was leaning towards retirement, and on October 4, he played his last game.

==Broadcasting career==
Boone served as a guest analyst for the MLB Network coverage of the 2009 ALCS between the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.

On February 23, 2010, Boone announced his retirement and that he would become an analyst for ESPN. Boone appeared on &quot;Monday Night Baseball&quot; and for &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot;″s pregame show on Sunday night. Boone called the 2014 and 2015 World Series for ESPN Radio with play-by-play announcer Dan Shulman. Jessica Mendoza and he became color commentators on &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; with Shulman in 2016. Boone and Shulman continued to call World Series games for ESPN Radio through 2017.

==Managerial career==
===2018 season===
After the 2017 season, the Yankees decided not to retain Joe Girardi as their manager; they hired Boone to succeed him on December 4, 2017. The Yankees started the 2018 season with a 6–1 win against the Toronto Blue Jays on March 29, 2018. On September 2, 2018, Boone was suspended for one game for making illegal contact with an umpire. He finished his first season with a 100–62 record, good for second in the American League East, and led the Yankees to the wild card game against the Oakland Athletics, despite losing star outfielder and team leader Aaron Judge for two months with a wrist injury. On October 3, 2018, the Yankees defeated the Athletics 7–2 to advance to the American League Division Series, giving Boone his first postseason win as a manager. The Boston Red Sox eliminated the New York Yankees three–games–to–one in the American League Division Series &quot;en route&quot; to a World Series victory.

===2019 season===

The Yankees started the 2019 season with a 7–2 win against the Baltimore Orioles on March 28, 2019. On September 19, after winning against the Los Angeles Angels 9–1, the Yankees clinched the American League East, becoming AL East Division Champions for the first time since 2012 and also earning their 100th win. Boone became the first manager in MLB history to have 100 or more wins in each of his first two seasons. The Yankees went on to lose to the Houston Astros in the American League Championship Series.

Following the 2019 season, Boone was named a finalist for American League Manager of the Year award. He finished runner-up to Minnesota Twins manager, Rocco Baldelli.

=== 2020 season ===
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Yankees and the other 29 Major League Baseball teams only played a 60-game regular season. The Yankees started off the shortened season with a hot 16–6 start, but then lost 15 of their next 20 games, evening their record at 21–21. The Yankees then won 10 straight to finish the season second in their division with a 33–27 record, seven games behind the division-champion Tampa Bay Rays, who they lost eight of 10 games to in the regular season, in the AL East, but good enough for the fifth seed in the American League due to MLB&#x27;s postseason expansion for the season. The Yankees swept the Cleveland Indians in a best-of-three wild card series to advance to the ALDS against the Tampa Bay Rays, but their struggles against the Rays continued, as they were eliminated in five games.

=== 2021 season ===
During the 2021 season, the Yankees had what was called one of the &quot;streakiest [teams] in recent memory. Through July 4, the team struggled to a 41–41 record with half of the season left to play, then went on a 51–29 run to end the season at 92–70. Between August 14 and 28, the Yankees won 13 consecutive games, tied for fifth-longest in franchise history. Following the winning streak, the team stumbled, going 3–12 between August 28 and September 12, and finished tied for second in the American League East behind the Tampa Bay Rays, but lost the wild card game to the Boston Red Sox 6–2.

Following the season, Boone signed a three-year contract with the Yankees with a club option for 2025.

=== 2022 season ===
In 2022, he was ejected nine times, four times more than any other MLB manager. The Yankees were 64–28 in the first half of the season by the All-Star Game and potentially headed to 100 wins. They proceeded to win 35 of their next 70 games to finish with 99 wins and an AL East title. They earned home-field advantage in Games 1, 2, and 5 of the ALDS. They beat the Cleveland Guardians in five games, but got swept by the Houston Astros in the ALCS, marking Boone&#x27;s fifth-straight playoff exit.

===2023 season===
MLB suspended Boone for one game on May 26, 2023, for his conduct towards umpires after his fourth ejection of the season, and second in four days, the prior day. As of June 9, Boone has the third-highest ejection rate in MLB history among managers, behind only Paul Richards and Frankie Frisch, and ahead of Earl Weaver, Bobby Cox, and Ron Gardenhire, managers who were all known for their proclivity for getting ejected. The team was eliminated from playoff contention for the first time under his management on September 24.

===2024 season===
The Yankees finished the season first in the American League East at 94–68, beat the Kansas City Royals in four games in the ALDS and Cleveland Guardians in five games in the ALCS for their first AL Pennant and World Series appearance since 2009, where they subsequently lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games. On November 8, 2024, the Yankees exercised the 2025 option clause for Boone.

===2025 season===
Before the 2025 regular season began, Boone and the Yankees agreed to a two-year contract extension.

===Managerial record===


==Personal life==
Boone is the son of former catcher and manager Bob Boone, the brother of All Star and four-time Gold Glove winner Bret Boone, the brother of former Cincinnati Reds minor leaguer Matt Boone, and the grandson of former major leaguer Ray Boone. As children, Aaron and Bret spent time in the Phillies clubhouse with fellow sons of other major league players, including Pete Rose Jr. Boone is a descendant of pioneer Daniel Boone. Boone is a fan of the Philadelphia Eagles football team.

Boone&#x27;s wife, Laura Cover, was a &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate (Miss October 1998). Boone lived in Scottsdale, Arizona until becoming Yankees manager, when he moved to Greenwich, Connecticut. Boone and Cover have four children—two biological children and two adopted.

Boone had open-heart surgery in 2009 and had surgery to implant a pacemaker in March 2021. Boone was quoted as feeling &quot;awesome&quot; after being on the bench for two weeks following the procedure.

<doc id="576713" wikidata="Q1463705" url="?curid=576713" title="Congruence of squares">
<text>In number theory, a congruence of squares is a congruence commonly used in integer factorization algorithms.

==Derivation==
Given a positive integer &quot;n&quot;, Fermat&#x27;s factorization method relies on finding numbers &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; satisfying the equality

:formula_1

We can then factor &quot;n&quot; = &quot;x&quot;2 − &quot;y&quot;2 = (&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;)(&quot;x&quot; − &quot;y&quot;). This algorithm is slow in practice because we need to search many such numbers, and only a few satisfy the equation. However, &quot;n&quot; may also be factored if we can satisfy the weaker congruence of squares conditions:

:formula_2
:formula_3

From here we easily deduce
:formula_4
:formula_5

This means that &quot;n&quot; divides the product (&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;)(&quot;x&quot; − &quot;y&quot;). The second non-triviality condition guarantees that &quot;n&quot; does not divide (&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;) nor (&quot;x&quot; − &quot;y&quot;) individually. Thus (&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;) and (&quot;x&quot; − &quot;y&quot;) each contain some, but not all, factors of &quot;n&quot;, and the greatest common divisors of (&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) and of (&quot;x&quot; − &quot;y&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) will give us these factors. This can be done quickly using the Euclidean algorithm.

Most algorithms for finding congruences of squares do not actually guarantee non-triviality; they only make it likely. There is a chance that a congruence found will be trivial, in which case we need to continue searching for another &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.

Congruences of squares are extremely useful in integer factorization algorithms. Conversely, because finding square roots modulo a composite number turns out to be probabilistic polynomial-time equivalent to factoring that number, any integer factorization algorithm can be used efficiently to identify a congruence of squares.

==Using a factor base==
A technique pioneered by Dixon&#x27;s factorization method and improved by continued fraction factorization, the quadratic sieve, and the general number field sieve, is to construct a congruence of squares using a factor base.

Instead of looking for one pair formula_6 directly, we find many &quot;relations&quot; formula_7 where the &quot;y&quot; have only small prime factors (they are smooth numbers), and multiply some of them together to get a square on the right-hand side.

The set of small primes which all the &quot;y&quot; factor into is called the factor base. Construct a logical matrix where each row describes one &quot;y&quot;, each column corresponds to one prime in the factor base, and the entry is the parity (even or odd) of the number of times that factor occurs in &quot;y&quot;. Our goal is to select a subset of rows whose sum is the all-zero row. This corresponds to a set of &quot;y&quot; values whose product is a square number, i.e. one whose factorization has only even exponents. The products of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; values together form a congruence of squares.

This is a classic system of linear equations problem, and can be efficiently solved using Gaussian elimination as soon as the number of rows exceeds the number of columns. Some additional rows are often included to ensure that several solutions exist in the nullspace of our matrix, in case the first solution produces a trivial congruence.

A great advantage of this technique is that the search for relations is embarrassingly parallel; a large number of computers can be set to work searching different ranges of &quot;x&quot; values and trying to factor the resultant &quot;y&quot;s. Only the found relations need to be reported to a central computer, and there is no particular hurry to do so. The searching computers do not even have to be trusted; a reported relation can be verified with minimal effort.

There are numerous elaborations on this technique. For example, in addition to relations where &quot;y&quot; factors completely in the factor base, the &quot;large prime&quot; variant also collects &quot;partial relations&quot; where &quot;y&quot; factors completely except for one larger factor. A second partial relation with the same larger factor can be multiplied by the first to produce a &quot;complete relation&quot;.

==Examples==
===Factorize 35===
We take &quot;n&quot; = 35 and find that 

:formula_8. 

We thus factor as

:formula_9

===Factorize 1649===
Using &quot;n&quot; = 1649, as an example of finding a congruence of squares built up from the products of non-squares (see Dixon&#x27;s factorization method), first we obtain several congruences

:formula_10
:formula_11
:formula_12

Of these, the first and third have only small primes as factors, and a product of these has an even power of each small prime, and is therefore a square

:formula_13

yielding the congruence of squares

:formula_14

So using the values of 80 and 114 as our &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; gives factors

:formula_15

<doc id="576724" wikidata="Q360244" url="?curid=576724" title="Savion Glover">
<text>Savion Glover (born November 19, 1973) is an American tap dancer, actor and choreographer.

==Early life==
The youngest of three sons, Glover was born to a white father, who left the family before he was born, and a black mother. Glover&#x27;s great-grandfather on his mother&#x27;s side, Dick Lundy, was a shortstop in the Negro leagues. He managed eleven Negro League baseball teams, including the Newark Eagles. His grandfather, Bill Lewis, was a big band pianist and vocalist. His grandmother, Anna Lundy Lewis, was the minister of music at New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey. She played for Whitney Houston when she was singing in the gospel choir, and was the one who first noticed Savion&#x27;s musical talent. She once held him and hummed some rhythms to him, and he smiled and joined along. Glover graduated from Newark Arts High School in 1991.

==Career==
Glover stated that his style is &quot;young and funk.&quot; When asked to describe what funk is, he says it is the bass line. &quot;Funk is anything that gets one&#x27;s head on beat. It is riding with the rhythm. It is a pulse that keeps one rolling with the beat.&quot; Gregory Hines, a tap legend, was one of Glover&#x27;s tap teachers. Hines stated that &quot;Savion is possibly the best tap dancer that ever lived.&quot; Glover liked to start his pieces with some old school moves from famous tappers and then work his way into his own style. Hines said it is like paying homage to those he respects. When Honi Coles died, Savion performed at his memorial service. He finished his dance with a famous Coles move: a backflip into a split from standing position, then getting up without using one&#x27;s hands. Glover rarely does this move because it wasn&#x27;t his style, but he did it because it was Coles&#x27; style that he wanted to keep alive. &quot;I feel like it&#x27;s one of my responsibilities to keep the style.&quot; Henry LeTang called Glover &quot;the Sponge&quot; because he learned very quickly with everything thrown at him. LeTang taught the Hines brothers back in the 1950s and taught Glover for a little while before having him work for &quot;Black and Blue,&quot; a tap revue in Paris in 1987. Many legendary tappers taught Glover such as LeTang, the Hines brothers, Jimmy Slyde, Dianne Walker, Chuck Green, Lon Chaney (Isaiah Chaneyfield), Honi Coles, Sammy Davis Jr., Buster Brown, Howard Sims, and Arthur Duncan.

===Teaching===
He has been teaching tap since he was 14 years old. Glover created &quot;Real Tap Skills&quot;, and started &quot;HooFeRz Club School for Tap&quot; in Newark, New Jersey. At age seven, Glover drummed in a group called &quot;Three Plus One&quot;. In the group, he demanded that he dance while he played the drum. Glover has a heavy foot for tap. He dances hard and loud in every step, and teaches his students how to &quot;hit,&quot; a term related to one&#x27;s ability to express oneself, complete a tap sequence, or say something.

===Choreography===

====Notable choreographed pieces====
*&quot;Bring in &#x27;Da Noise, Bring in &#x27;Da Funk&quot;
*&quot;Savion Glover&#x27;s Nu York&quot;, ABC special
*ABC opening to Monday Night Football
*&quot;The Rat Pack&quot;, HBO movie
*Created a dance company called NYOTs (Not Your Ordinary Tappers)
*PBS for President Clinton in Savion Glover&#x27;s Stomp, Slide, and Swing: In Performances in the Whitehouse
*Savion Glover/Downtown: Live Communication
*&quot;Shuffle Along, or, the Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed&quot;

When Glover choreographs a piece, he improvises as he generates a dance sequence. As he finds rhythms, he listens for new sounds at many points on the stage. &quot;I&#x27;m feelin&#x27; the stage for sounds. You might find a spot on it that gives you that bass; you might find a spot on the floor that gives you that dead type tom-tom sound.&quot; &quot;I think what makes Savion an incredible artist is his extraordinary joy in what he does. He is able to live in that state of joy and not compromise his emotional complexity like the earlier tap dancers had to,&quot; says George C. Wolfe.

One of the timesteps performed in Barbra Streisand&#x27;s &quot;Timeless&quot; in Glover&#x27;s performance as &quot;Brother Time&quot; has been informally named the &quot;Savion Glover Timestep&quot; by many tap dancers.

===Broadway===
===&quot;The Tap Dance Kid&quot; (1985)===
This musical was based on the 1974 novel &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Family is Going to Change&quot; by Louise Fitzhugh. Glover&#x27;s Broadway debut, at the age of 11, was as a replacement with this show. The musical was choreographed by Danny Daniels, with direction by Vivian Matalon; the music was by Henry Krieger and lyrics by Robert Lorick. Reviews of this show were mediocre. &quot;The New York Times&quot; claimed it was a traditional story to give children a dream to look forward to, but was not anything exceptional. However, the musical went on to be nominated for seven Tony Awards, including Best Musical.

===&quot;Black and Blue&quot; (1989)===
Performed at the age of 15. For this performance, he became one of the youngest performers ever nominated for a Tony Award.

===&quot;Jelly&#x27;s Last Jam&quot; (1992)===
In &quot;Jelly&#x27;s Last Jam&quot; (1992), the tap dancing was choreographed by Ted Levy and Gregory Hines, who starred as Jelly Roll Morton. Glover played the role of &quot;Young Jelly&quot;,
and was nominated for the Drama Desk Award as Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical.

===&quot;Bring in &#x27;Da Noise, Bring in &#x27;Da Funk&quot; (1996)===
Glover performed in this musical and also choreographed it. He was nominated for the Tony Award, Actor in a Musical for his roles as Lil&#x27; Dahlin&#x27; and &#x27;da Beat and for Choreography. &quot;Mr. Glover meticulously and respectfully demonstrates the techniques made famous by each, then blends them all into an exultant stylistic brew that belongs to no one but him. As dance, as musical, as theater, as art, as history and entertainment, there&#x27;s nothing Noise/Funk cannot and should not do.&quot; -&quot;The New York Times&quot;.

===&quot;Shuffle Along, or, the Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed&quot; (2016)===
Glover choreographed the musical &quot;Shuffle Along, or, the Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed&quot;, which opened in 2016 at the Music Box Theatre. He has been nominated for a Tony Award for Best Choreography and a Drama Desk Award for his work on the musical.

<doc id="576725" wikidata="Q5710627" url="?curid=576725" title="Helter Skelter (book)">
<text>Helter Skelter: The True Story of The Manson Murders is a 1974 book by Vincent Bugliosi and Curt Gentry. Bugliosi had served as the prosecutor in the 1970 trial of Charles Manson. The book presents his firsthand account of the cases of Manson, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, and other members of the self-described Manson Family. It is the best-selling true crime book in history.

== Description ==
The book recounts and assesses the investigation, arrest, and prosecution of Charles Manson and his followers for the notorious 1969 murders of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, pregnant actress Sharon Tate, and several others.

The book takes its title from the apocalyptic race war that Manson allegedly believed would occur, which in turn took its name from the song &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; by the Beatles. Manson had been particularly fascinated by the Beatles&#x27; &quot;White Album&quot;, from which the song came.

== Reception and legacy ==
&quot;Helter Skelter&quot; was first published in the United States in 1974 and became a bestseller. The book won the 1975 Edgar Award for Best Fact Crime book, and was the basis for two television films, released in 1976 and 2004. At the time of Bugliosi&#x27;s death in 2015, it had sold over seven million copies, making it the best-selling true crime book in history. The book was also the primary influence for the story line of the 2008 film &quot;The Strangers&quot;.

Since its initial hardcover edition, the book has had several printings as a mass market paperback. A 25th anniversary edition (since the crimes) was published in 1994 with an update added by Bugliosi. Bugliosi himself narrated the Talking Books unabridged audiobook at the time of the book&#x27;s original release, and read an abridged version of his update for the 25th anniversary edition abridged audiobook read by Robert Foxworth. Audible.com commissioned Scott Brick to read an unabridged version of the 25th anniversary edition in 2011.

<doc id="576729" wikidata="Q2629361" url="?curid=576729" title="GnomeVFS">
<text>GnomeVFS (short for GNOME Virtual File System) was an abstraction layer of the GNOME platform for the reading, writing and execution of files. Before GNOME 2.22 GnomeVFS was primarily used by the appropriate versions of Nautilus file manager (renamed to GNOME Files) and other GNOME applications.

A cause of confusion is the fact that the file system abstraction used by the Linux kernel is also called the virtual file system (VFS) layer. This is however at a lower level.

Due to perceived shortcomings of GnomeVFS a replacement called GVfs was developed. GVfs is based on GIO and allows partitions to be mounted through FUSE.

With the release of GNOME 2.22 in April 2008, GnomeVFS was declared deprecated in favor of GVfs and GIO, requesting that developers not use it in new applications.

<doc id="576731" wikidata="Q5298677" url="?curid=576731" title="Dorothy Wellesley, Duchess of Wellington">
<text>Dorothy Violet Wellesley, Duchess of Wellington ( Ashton; 30 July 1889 – 11 July 1956), styled Lady Gerald Wellesley between 1914 and 1943, was an English author, poet, literary editor and socialite.

==Background==

She was born in White Waltham, the daughter of Col. Robert Ashton of Croughton, Cheshire (himself a second cousin of the 1st Baron Ashton of Hyde), descended from wealthy cotton manufacturers, and his wife (Lucy) Cecilia Dunn-Gardner (later Countess of Scarbrough), and stepdaughter of the 10th Earl of Scarbrough.

==Poetry==
As Dorothy Wellesley, the name she took after her marriage to Lord Gerald Wellesley, she was the author of more than ten books, mostly of poetry, but including also &quot;Sir George Goldie, Founder of Nigeria&quot; (1934), and &quot;Far Have I Travelled&quot; (1952). She was editor for Hogarth Press of the Hogarth Living Poets series. She also edited &quot;The Annual&quot; in 1929.

According to W. B. Yeats, Wellesley was one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century - see his Introduction to the &quot;Oxford Book of Modern Verse 1892–1935&quot;. &quot;Within two minutes of our first meeting at my house he said: ‘You must sacrifice everything and everyone to your poetry&#x27;&quot;. 

Yeats discovered her poetry while researching the &quot;Oxford Book of Modern Verse&quot; and said &quot;My eyes filled with tears. I read in excitement that was more delightful because it showed that I had not lost my understanding of poetry.&quot; Only later did he find who she was and what was her station in life.

Yeats scholar R. F. Foster, however, has written that she was &quot;a moderately accomplished if minor poet&quot; though adding that &quot;the quality of some of her work has been vindicated by time&quot;.

She was introduced to Yeats in 1935, and he eventually would edit and revise her poems as well as soliciting her comments on his works. Together they edited the second series of &quot;Broadsides: New Irish &amp; English Songs&quot; in 1937. Yeats spent much of his final time towards the end of his life with Wellesley at her Sussex home, and she would be at his deathbed in 1939.

==Marriage==
Dorothy Ashton married Lord Gerald Wellesley (later 7th Duke of Wellington), on 30 April 1914; they separated in 1922 but did not divorce.

They had two children:

# Valerian Wellesley, 8th Duke of Wellington (2 July 1915 – 31 December 2014)
# Lady Elizabeth Wellesley (26 December 1918 – 25 November 2013)

==Female lovers==
Dorothy Wellesley became the lover of Vita Sackville-West, for whom she left her husband and children in 1922, according to a memoir published in 2009 by her granddaughter, Lady Jane Wellesley. 

After that relationship ended, for eight years she became the lover and companion of Hilda Matheson (1888–1940), a BBC producer who lived in &quot;Rocks Farm&quot; in the grounds of her house in the Sussex village of Withyham called &quot;Penns-in-the-Rocks&quot;. A certain distance was called for due to Dorothy&#x27;s (family nickname &quot;Dotty&quot;) sometimes erratic and demanding behaviour. This relationship, a key stabilizer in both their lives, ended tragically with the death of Hilda during a routine thyroid operation.

==Death==

The Duchess of Wellington died at Withyham, Sussex. After her death, her widower proposed to her half-sister, Lady Serena James ( Lumley), widow of his former brother-in-law the Hon. Robert James), but she refused him.

== In popular culture ==
She was one of a series of society beauties photographed as classical figures by Madame Yevonde.
Dorothy Wellesley is portrayed by Karla Crome in the 2018 film &quot;Vita and Virginia&quot;.

<doc id="576735" wikidata="Q3306444" url="?curid=576735" title="Merry Gentry">
<text>Meredith &quot;Merry&quot; Gentry is the protagonist of an eponymous fantasy series by US writer Laurell K. Hamilton, best known for her other fantasy series &quot;Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter&quot;. The series comprises nine novels and was written between 2000 when the series began with &quot;A Kiss of Shadows&quot; and the final book, &quot;A Shiver of Light&quot;, published in June 3, 2014.

==Character profile==
Meredith NicEssus is a faerie princess turned private investigator in a world where faeries are not only known to the general public, but are also fashionable. She takes on the pseudonym &quot;Merry Gentry&quot; to hide from her family and her past while hiding out in Los Angeles, California as a private investigator at Grey&#x27;s Detective Agency. Merry, the only Sidhe (pronounced &quot;shEE&quot;) royal to be born on American soil, fearing the continuous assassination attempts on her life thinly disguised as duels, flees the Unseelie Court in a final act of self-preservation. Her glamour (the art of magical disguise through illusion) is nearly unrivaled at court, and she is able to pass herself off as a human with fey blood.

The general tone of the writing is less of an outright fantasy and more of an alternate history. The point of divergence from normal history is not provided, although hints are given about how the faerie history intersects with human history (Adolf Hitler, the Great Famine of Ireland, and Thomas Jefferson are examples). In the books, Jefferson gave the Unseelie and Seelie courts asylum after the European courts exiled them—however with the caveat that they could not set themselves up as gods or make war on one another, by doing so they would risk being evicted from US soil.

Flash forward to present times. The fey are quite fashionable in the modern United States, and there are many faeriephiles. &quot;Sightings&quot; of the Elven American Princesses have covered the tabloids for years now, and Queen Andais&#x27; magic is constantly following these false leads—which are becoming more popular than Elvis sightings.

At the beginning of the first book in the series, Merry&#x27;s full name and title is &quot;Princess Meredith NicEssus, Child of Peace, Besaba&#x27;s Bane&quot;. &quot;NicEssus&quot; means, literally, &quot;daughter of Essus&quot;; it is the sort of name given to a child and laid aside once the child has come into his or her powers. That Merry used the name into her thirties is a sign that she is a late bloomer at best, a lesser sidhe at worst. After a child comes into their power, the last name is dropped. Later in the series it is revealed that Meredith is a descendant of fertility deities of both courts.

As of the end of the second book in the series, Merry&#x27;s titles are &quot;Princess of Flesh and Blood&quot;; at the end of the fourth book, &quot;The Red And White Goddess&quot; is added to her title by demi-fey who gave her the title when her magic gave wings to wingless demi-fey.

The series chronicles the return of Meredith to the Unseelie Court by way of an invitation sent by her Aunt Andais, the Queen of Air and Darkness in the form of her right hand, Doyle, also known as The Queen&#x27;s Darkness. She is given men from the queen&#x27;s own guard, her Ravens, to guard her body and fill her bed as heir to the throne, provided she can conceive a child before her cousin, Cel. Later Merry adds to her collection of men first by taking the men offered to her by Queen Andais, as well as forming alliances with the demi-fey, goblins, and Red Caps.

==Alliances formed by Meredith==

Meredith formed her first alliance with Sholto King of the Sluagh when he is sent to Los Angeles by an unknown man (later theorized to be Cel, her cousin). Once there, Sholto uses his guards to track her down. However the hags (Sholto&#x27;s guards and lovers) attempt to kill Merry. Once Sholto convinces Merry to accompany him to his hotel room. They agree to form an alliance which was to be consecrated by Merry having sex with Sholto. They are interrupted by Nerys The Gray who attempts to kill Merry. However, Merry comes into her first hand of power (the Hand of Flesh) due to her &quot;shining&quot; moment with Sholto and uses her newly found hand of power on Nerys. She is eventually convinced to kill Nerys with Doyle&#x27;s killing blade by Doyle and Sholto, because Nerys is immortal and cannot die even if she is turned into an inside-out ball of flesh (the results of Merry&#x27;s hand of power).

The second alliance is formed between Merry and Kurag, King of the Goblins. This occurs when Merry is bled by the roses that line the entrance to the throne room of the Unseelie Court. She passes out from blood loss and opens her eyes to see one of the goblins drinking from her open wound (to goblins bodily fluids are sacred). She has the goblin detained and bargains with Kurag for a 6-month alliance in return for Merry taking a goblin (Kitto) into her bed. She deems this acceptable payment for the theft of her blood. Later Merry bargains for an extended alliance of 1 month for each sidhe-sided goblin that she brings into power. Also, Merry brings the Red Caps back to their full original power because she is the only Sidhe who possesses the full Hand of Blood. By doing so, the Red Caps owe her their own alliance outside of the one formed between Merry and Kurag.

The final alliance is struck between Merry and Niceven (Queen of the Demi-Fey). This is struck when Merry bargains for the cure to a curse that the Demi-Fey placed on Galen, under the direction of Cel. She bargains with Niceven for a year alliance during which the demi-fey will spy for Merry in exchange for weekly blood donations by Merry. This alliance is brought into question later on when Queen Niceven&#x27;s surrogate, who can become nearly human sized, has sex with Meredith and becomes stuck in his form (at the same time, Meredith brings Nicca, one of her lovers, the wings that he should have been born with but instead had become a supernatural tattoo on his back) because of this, Queen Niceven sends to Meredith the Demi-Fey that were born without wings in hopes that she will also give them their wings.

==Meredith&#x27;s lovers==
To name the most prominent of her lovers (with titles in parentheses):

* Doyle (the Queen&#x27;s Darkness, Nodons, Bearer of the Painful Flame, Baron Sweet Tongue)
* Frost (the Killing Frost, once was Jackie Frost)
* Sholto (King of the Sluagh, Lord of That Which Passes Between, Lord of Shadows)
* Galen (the Green Knight)
* Mistral (The Storm Lord)
* Rhys (Cromm Cruach)
* Kitto
* Nicca
** Nicca left Merry&#x27;s harem, with her blessings, after a magical artifact pointed him to his soulmate Biddy.

In &quot;A Lick of Frost&quot;, it was revealed that Merry was pregnant with twins, each with three fathers; the six fathers were Doyle, Frost, Sholto, Galen, Mistral and Rhys. These six, therefore, will become her kings if and when she ever takes the throne. She has (as of &quot;Swallowing Darkness&quot;) been specifically crowned by Faerie as Sholto&#x27;s queen as well as Doyle&#x27;s queen; however, she has made it quite clear that this does not mean she is bound to have either of them as her only king.

In addition, she has also bedded the roane [seal shapeshifter] Roane, the Sidhe Adair, Amatheon, Abeloec, Ivi, and Brii, the half-goblin twins Ash and Holly, and the demi-feys named Sage and Royal. She has also had metaphysical sex with Barinthus (formerly Manannan Mac Lir).

In &quot;A Shiver of Light&quot;, it is in fact revealed to Merry&#x27;s surprise that she is in fact having triplets, one of her babes was hiding behind her siblings in the womb

==Thrones held by Merry==

In &quot;Swallowing Darkness&quot;, Merry was crowned Queen of the Sluagh by Faerie, and soon was formally recognized by the Sluagh as Sholto&#x27;s queen. Near the end of the same book, Merry was crowned Queen of the Unseelie Court (the Crown of Moonlight and Shadows) and Doyle was crowned her king (with the Crown of Thorn and Silver); however, when offered a chance by the Goddess, they gave up the Unseelie throne in exchange for Frost&#x27;s life.

She has also been offered the Seelie throne by certain members of the Seelie court, as their infertile king has gone mad and is no longer fit to rule, but has refused. Merry repeatedly states, both in her own thoughts and to her guards, that she does not believe she would be accepted on either the Seelie or Unseelie thrones because of her mortality and mixed (human, brownie, and sidhe) blood, and that she would invite certain death for either herself or some of her men by attempting to rule either court.

In the most recent book, &quot;A Shiver of Light&quot;, King Sholto&#x27;s death threatens Merry&#x27;s place and queen of the Sluagh. She is surprised that the Sluagh remain loyal to her and refuse to elect another king till Sholto is avenged. At the end of the book she still remains Queen of the Sluagh, as well as claiming the title of the Queen of Faerie in the westerlands with approval of the Goddess and Consort.

==Merry&#x27;s development of powers==
Early in &quot;A Kiss of Shadows&quot;, Merry is assaulted by a human using Branwyn&#x27;s Tears, a magical aphrodisiac/date-rape drug, apparently unlocking her sidhe powers. Branwyn&#x27;s Tears temporarily turns any creature into a sidhe and forces them to crave sexual intercourse. Sexual intercourse is one of a few fae rituals which can raise power and activate personal magics. When Merry had intercourse with her boyfriend, who was a roane, she simultaneously returned his ability to change shape (which he had lost after a fisherman burned his seal-skin) and raised magic in her two hands indicating she possesses two hands of power.

Her first hand of power (Hand of Flesh) develops when she is attacked by Nerys the Grey, a night hag. In the process of defending herself, Merry accidentally turns Nerys into a screaming, agonized ball of inside-out flesh. (As Nerys was a creature of Faerie, she was able to survive the process, much to Merry&#x27;s horror and revulsion.) This power is known as the Hand of Flesh, which Merry&#x27;s father, Essus, also possessed. After this, Doyle gives her Queen Andais&#x27;s sword, Mortal Dread, which she uses to put the inside-out night hag out of her misery. In the process, she becomes covered with blood, and Doyle tells her that in order to cement her powers, she had to cover herself in the blood of an enemy (which was his purpose in giving her the blade).

In &quot;A Caress of Twilight&quot;, Merry develops her second hand of power. Merry must protect Maeve Reed, an exile from the Seelie court, from the Nameless (when the fey came to America they gave up their most deadly magicks; the Nameless was made up of those magicks). During the battle, she charges the mass of energy and puts her left hand out; she feels her blood begin to boil, and large gashes appear on the enormous mass of magic. All Merry has to do is think &quot;Bleed&quot; (occasionally &quot;Bleed for me!&quot;), and the person (or things) bleeds. This is the development of the Hand of Blood.

Following Merry&#x27;s destruction of The Nameless, fae magic (called &quot;wild magic&quot;) inside The Nameless is released, resulting in the return of old powers to fae as well as the development of new powers. Merry develops the ability to both return godhood to fae and elevate fae to godhood who had never been gods. Merry also begins attracting ancient relics of power that had disappeared over time including the ancient cauldron (which took the form of a chalice). Further, Merry re-energizes existing ancient relics of power including Queen Andais&#x27;s ring and the Healing Spring.

Near the end of &quot;Seduced by Moonlight&quot;, after Merry duels with a Sidhe, her opponent does not die, though she is mortally wounded and has (as part of the pre-battle ritual) shared blood with Merry. As sharing Merry&#x27;s mortal blood has previously caused other opponents to become mortal in battle, this may indicate that Merry is no longer a mortal. However, later books have not yet followed up on this development, and Merry herself still believes she is mortal.

In &quot;Swallowing Darkness&quot;, we see a darker side to Merry and her magic. For the second time she uses her magic as a tool for death. When facing Onilwyn she puts her left hand out and thinks &quot;die&quot; not &quot;bleed&quot;. It is also detailed that during her fight with her cousin Cel she visualizes a fist inside him and when she opens that fist he exploded.

However, for all the dark deeds done with her magic there is a lighter side. It seems that many times when she has sex with another person of power, something natural and beautiful grows. This is witnessed frequently throughout the books. The most amazing example of the lighter side to her magic is during one of the battle scenes in &quot;Swallowing Darkness&quot;, when Merry uses the hands of Flesh and Blood to heal wounded and dying soldiers who have fallen protecting her, showing that for every dark power there is a light use for it.

==Means of communication Used by characters==

*&quot;By Mirror&quot;: The first type of magical communication shown (with possible exception of mention of Queen Andais&#x27;s ability to hear anything said in the dark). Method is achieved by coating a mirror with your own personal power or magic and willing the communication via a spell (spell not specified in book). In-text, it would seem communication is achieved by speaking the other person&#x27;s name, and willing communication. Text shows that there are variations on theme, such as using a smooth, still pool, shiny blade, or pool of blood. Also, Doyle places a spell so that they can choose when communication commences, instead of instantaneous connection. See scrying, specifically hydromancy.
*&quot;By Blade&quot;: Using essentially the same principle as communication by mirror, by applying blood and breath, communication between two people can be established by calling them by name. Communication by this method was used between Merry and Kurag in &quot;A Caress of Twilight&quot; (Merry Gentry #2) and Merry and Rhys in &quot;A Stroke of Midnight&quot; (Merry Gentry #4). See scrying.
*&quot;By Dream (or Vision)&quot;: Generally accomplished through connection with God or Goddess, always magic or mystic communication type. In fact, the God and Goddess are the only people or beings that use this method due to their immense magical ability and influence. Usual methods of induction are either the Ring or Chalice. Examples of this type of communication are the Goddess&#x27;s repeated messages to Sidhe men and Merry that they need to have sex in order to regain old powers, and Merry&#x27;s vision of soldiers in Iraq in Divine Misdemeanors (Merry Gentry #8). See Oneiromancy and Visions.

They married on 18 November 1939 at St. Peter&#x27;s Church, Vere Street, in London, with her brother as best man. A reception followed at her father&#x27;s home at Chester Terrace, featuring a wedding cake designed by Rex Whistler and made by Fortnum &amp; Mason.

The family lived at Dorney, Buckinghamshire.

Her children are:
* Jeremy Clyde (born 22 March 1941), actor and musician
* Robin Clyde (19 April 1943 – 13 February 1950)
* William Jonathan Clyde (born 27 May 1949)

<text>Lotte Chilsung Beverage Co., Ltd. () is a drink manufacturer in South Korea affiliated with Lotte Corporation. The company&#x27;s name, Chilsung (), signifies &quot;Big Dipper&quot; or seven stars, and its logo displays seven stars aligned in a row.

==History==
Chilsung was founded in May 1950, then known as the Dongbang Beverage Company, and began with the launch of Chilsung Cider, a lemon-lime soft drink.

In 1967, they became Hanmi Foods Industry Co., then changing to Chilsung Hanmi Foods Corporation in 1973, eventually becoming the Chilsung Beverage Company.
In 1975, the company acquired Busan Joint Beverage Corporation and signed a technology partnership agreement with PepsiCo in 1976.

In 1985, it was appointed the official beverage supplier for the 1986 Seoul Asian Games and 1988 Seoul Olympics, merged with Lotte Brewery in July 1986 and introduced CIP in December. In 1987, the Opo plant became the first in the industry to receive the KS mark. 

By 2009, Chilsung products accounted for 36.7% of the Korean beverage market, compared to Coca Cola&#x27;s 17.6%.and rebranded it as Lotte Liquor BG and built a logistics centre in Gwangmyeong, Gyeonggi-do, and acquired PepsiCo Products Philippines Inc (PCPPI) in 2010 and merged with Lotte Liquor BG the following year.

As Lotte founder Shin Kyuk-ho&#x27;s health was deteriorating, his sons vied for control of the conglomerate. The fraternal feud hit a peak in 2015 when eldest son Dong-joo was removed from his position as Vice President of Lotte Holdings and his younger brother Shin Dong-bin assumed control. News of the leadership struggle created doubts about Lotte&#x27;s future, and Lotte Chilsung Beverage&#x27;s market value dropped 6.85% in August.

In 2016, amidst a police probe into embezzelment, Lotte Group companies lost a combined market value of in just four days, with Lotte Chilsung&#x27;s shares falling by 3.93% in a single day.

In February 2018, Chairman Shin Dong-bin was convicted on charges of bribery as part of the 2016 South Korean political scandal and sentenced to 2.5 years&#x27; incarceration. After serving for 234 days, an appeals court released him from prison, and he went back to his duties as Chairman shortly after. When news of his release broke, Lotte Group&#x27;s market value was boosted by 4.2%.

In 2018, Chilsung Beverage was fined by the Securities &amp; Futures Commission of Financial Services for underreporting the losses of an affiliate. It was found that the drinks company masked net losses of , reporting them as just .

==Corporate governance==
As of October 2023.

==Products==
===Chilsung Cider===
By the end of 2013, Lotte had sold over 18.5 billion bottles of Chilsung Cider. In December 2019, they had to retire the iconic green bottle due to new government regulation about PET plastic. The bottles are now clear.

=== Cola ===

American military presence as a result of the Korean War in the 1950s led to carbonated beverages appearing in South Korea for the first time. Chilsung released their own version of Cola in 1961, prior to Coca-Cola&#x27;s official entry into the Korean market. It was first named &quot;Speci Cola&quot;, but then changed to &quot;Chilsung Cola&quot; to match its sister product Chilsung Cider, but this has since been discontinued.

Nowadays, Lotte Chilsung does not produce their own cola but instead bottles &amp; distributes Pepsi Cola across Korea.

=== Milkis ===
&quot;See Milkis.&quot;

===Juices===

Lotte Chilsung Beverage currently produces a range of natural fruit juices in orange, grape, apple, tangerine, pear, and mango flavors. In 1982, the company established a partnership with US-based, Del Monte, and now manufactures the Premium Orange and Del Monte Cold products. In 2009, the license for Tropicana was acquired and Tropicana Homemade style blends and other popular choices were produced.

===Coffee and tea===
The lineup in coffee include Let&#x27;s Be, South Korea&#x27;s No. 1 canned coffee; Cantata, a coffee blend made with Arabica beans from plantations worldwide; and black tea drinks Ceylon Tea and Lipton.

===Other beverages/bottled water===
Other beverages range from soy milks to traditional beverage and health drinks. Other varieties in the catalog include the sports drink Gatorade, the carbonated water Trevi, the purified water Icis, and France-imported Evian and Volvic.

===Alcoholic drinks===
Lotte Chilsung Beverage has been marketing Scotch Blue, Korea&#x27;s local whiskey brand, along with fruit liquor, traditional Mirin, and other alcoholic beverages. Other alcoholic drinks include soju, cheongju Baekhwasubok, plum liquor Seoljungmae Plus, and South Korean wine Majuang.

Their soju brand Chum-Churum () is the world&#x27;s first soju made from alkaline-reduced water. In 2021, the spirit brand recorded sales worth in 37 countries.

== Expansion Abroad ==
In 1966, Lotte Chilsung began exporting its Chilsung Cider to Vietnam. In 1989, Lotte Chilsung acquired a JAS mark. In the late 1990s, the manufacturer grew to be the largest beverage company in Asia, holding 35% of the domestic market share. Lotte Chilsung continued to grow signing a contract with Gatorade in 2001.

By the end of 2024, a Lotte spokesperson claimed overseas sales will make up more than 30% of Chilsung Beverage&#x27;s total revenue.

=== US ===
In 2017, Lotte sought to expand their presence in the US beverage market, promoting Cider, Milkis and energy drink Hot6. They first began exporting their flavoured soju brand Cheom-cheoreum Soonhari to the US in 2019.

=== China ===
In 2016, the South Korean government chose Lotte Skyhill Country Club as the site to install a new advanced anti-missile system, THAAD. This led to a sharp rise in anti-Korean sentiment in China, with much of the frustration targeted at Lotte. There were widespread boycotts and protests, with employees of a mall in Xuchang protesting Lotte as they sung the Chinese national anthem.

As a result, Lotte&#x27;s Chinese business operations suffered greatly, with four out of six of Lotte Confectionery and Lotte Chilsung Beverage’s factories in Beijing, Qingdao, Henan and Qingbai shutting down in Q1 2019. All of Chilsung Beverage &amp; Lotte Confectionary&#x27;s Chinese operations had ceased by 2019.

Despite this difficult diplomatic backdrop, Lotte Chilsung was still able to sell beverages into Chinese markets. In 2021, Chilsung sold more than 25 million cans of Milkis to Chinese markets, with Taiwan&#x27;s consumption increasing 1100% in just a year. Between January and August 2022, they had exported over 10 million cans of Milkis to Taiwan.

=== The Philippines ===
Chilsung Beverage first entered the Filipino market in 2010 by purchasing a 34.4% stake in Pepsi Cola Products Philippines (PCPPI). In 2020, Chilsung paid to increase their stake to 72.9%. They completed their acquisition of the country&#x27;s 2nd largest beverage producer in October 2023.

== Use of Celebrities ==
As a Korean brand, Lotte Chilsung has incorporated many famous Korean entertainers into their advertising.

Singer Lee Hyori represented their soju brand Chum-Churum () between 2007 and 2012. Then, a marketing campaign with the idol nicknamed the &quot;nation&#x27;s first love&quot;, Bae Suzy, ran from 2016 to 2018. BLACKPINK&#x27;s Jennie led the brand from 2021 to 2023, with actress Han So-hee becoming their latest representative.

For one soju campaign with BLACKPINK&#x27;s Jennie, Chum-Churum released a special promotional gift box which included Jennie photo cards, a Jennie mini cutout, a Jennie soju glass and a Soonhari Bluetooth microphone.

In 2014, Korean BBQ restaurant owner, Ham Sun-bok, went viral for making &#x27;so-maek&#x27;, a cocktail of beer and soju. Lotte made her a brand representative for Chum-Churum, reportedly signing a contract for more than .

In 2017, Chilsung Cider released an advertisement with actor Park Seo-joon and LABOUM singer Solbin. In 2023, actor Jung Hae-in became the face of Chilsung Cider.

== Antitrust violations ==

<doc id="576748" wikidata="Q649546" url="?curid=576748" title="Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)">
<text>is a character from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; video game series developed by Square (now Square Enix), appearing as the main antagonist of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. A former soldier of the megacorporation Shinra and the coworker of Zack Fair and superior of Cloud Strife, he possesses superhuman physiology as a result of an experiment in which Shinra injected him with cells from the extraterrestrial lifeform Jenova when he was still a fetus. Upon discovering this, Sephiroth becomes consumed by rage and vengeance, decides to take control of the Planet by harnessing its life force and annihilating all life on it in order to become a god amidst the destruction. Sephiroth&#x27;s background and role in the story are expanded upon in the &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot;. Additionally, he appears as a guest character in other video games and media, such as a recurring boss in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series and as a playable character in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;.

Character designer Tetsuya Nomura conceived and designed Sephiroth as an antagonist and foil to Cloud, as he rejects his identity in order to fulfill what he believes to be his destiny, while Cloud re-affirms his self-worth amidst a similar crisis of identity. In Japanese, Sephiroth has been voiced by voice actor Toshiyuki Morikawa in the majority of his appearances. He was voiced by Shin-ichiro Miki in &quot;Ehrgeiz&quot; and Yūichirō Umehara as a young Sephiroth in &quot;Ever Crisis&quot;. In English, Sephiroth has been voiced by Lance Bass in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; (2002), and by George Newbern in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; (2005) and the Compilation of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; metaseries (2004–present). In &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot; (2020), he was voiced by Tyler Hoechlin, a role he reprises in the remastered &quot;Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion&quot; (2022), replacing Newbern&#x27;s English performance in the original release, as well as &quot;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&quot; (2024).

Sephiroth has been well-received within the video game community and is highly ranked on many lists of the best video game villains and &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; characters based on his role in the narrative and his high challenge level. He was also the subject of analysis as a &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; villain who lost his humanity upon learning of his alien heritage, and how he attempts to corrupt Cloud by exploiting his mental weaknesses.

==Concept and creation==

Sephiroth was a collaborative effort between Yoshinori Kitase, Tetsuya Nomura, and scenario writer Kazushige Nojima. Going into the third he designed, Kitase says back when he was designing Sephiroth there were villains like Darth Vader and Thanos who were absolute evil powers. All of these different characters have these different ideals about where they think the world should be and how it should change. The conflict between them is clearer in the &quot;Remake&quot;, the idea of multiple possibilities and worlds that could happen, which will become clear in later installment. Looking at the villain, he was a heroic SOLDIER operative just like Cloud was, more experienced, and Sephiroth was an idol to the people. A character like that turning evil was the kind of appeal he was going for. Kitase believes the inspirations for Sephiroth came from a lot of different places. Kitase further said Sephiroth is not a copy of one character, but taking different aspects and merging them together resulted in the character shown in the game. In regards to his characterization, the character does not see himself as an evil being but instead a chosen man to accomplish a goal; changing the world throughout his chaos will reach the Promised Land, which is the opposite of what Cloud&#x27;s group wants.

Sephiroth was designed by &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;″s character designer Tetsuya Nomura. Nomura has stated that Sephiroth was made to be a contrast to the game&#x27;s main protagonist, Cloud, who was originally designed to have slicked-back, black hair. Kitase believes Sephiroth&#x27;s role in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; to be one of the main reasons for the game&#x27;s popularity. His name was derived from the Kabbalah, in which the ten sephirot on the Tree of life represent the ten attributes through which God reveals himself. His character and role as main antagonist existed from the earliest stages of development, as originally, Nomura thought that the game&#x27;s plot would deal exclusively with Cloud Strife pursuing him. His weapon, the , which has been featured in numerous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles, is an elongated nodachi that he learned to use during his days in SOLDIER. The Masamune is named after the famous Japanese swordsmith Goro Nyudo Masamune, whose blades are considered national treasures in Japan. When designing Cloud and Sephiroth, Nomura was influenced by his view of their rivalry mirroring the legendary animosity between Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojirō, with Cloud and Sephiroth being Musashi and Kojirō respectively. Sephiroth&#x27;s look was defined as &quot;kakkoii&quot;, a Japanese term combining good looks with coolness. Yoshitaka Amano, who had handled character illustrations for previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles, noted a contrast between Cloud, a &quot;young, passionate boy&quot;, and Sephiroth, a &quot;more mature and cool&quot; individual, as &quot;intriguing&quot;, though not unusual as a pairing.

Nomura wanted Sephiroth to appear early on in the game, and then have the plot deal with the protagonists following him, so that gamers would not meet the final boss until extremely late in the game. Sephiroth was initially going to be Aerith Gainsborough&#x27;s sibling, as indicated by their similar hairstyles. Later, however, he was changed to Aerith&#x27;s past love, whom she would remember upon meeting Cloud. This character was then changed to Zack Fair, and Sephiroth&#x27;s prior relationship with Aerith was dropped. In early drafts of the game, Sephiroth&#x27;s personality was brutal and cruel, with a strong-willed and calm ego. He was to suffer from Mako addiction, resulting in a semi-conscious state as a result of high exposure to Mako energy. Sephiroth was also intended to manipulate Cloud into believing that he was a creation of his will, but this aspect of the story was later abandoned. In another cut scene, when Sephiroth&#x27;s physical body is first seen in the Northern Crater, it was to be female. Jason Greenberg, the only artist working on the original PC port, recalled a crash bug that happened during Sephiroth&#x27;s technique. Near the end of the development cycle, many team members were done with their work and helped to test the game as much as possible. Greenberg spent nearly 24 hours playtesting battle during development. Since his transformation into Safer Sephiroth in the game&#x27;s final battle, Sephiroth has had a single black wing on his back, referencing his theme song &quot;One Winged Angel&quot;.

Nomura has called Sephiroth &quot;the ultimate antagonist in the &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; saga, there can&#x27;t be anyone else&quot;, and regards him as an enemy from a previous generation, in contrast to his &quot;Remnants&quot; who appear in &quot;Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children&quot;. For &quot;Advent Children&quot;, the film sequel to &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, scriptwriter Kazushige Nojima thought that the film&#x27;s plot would be less entertaining without Sephiroth. His revival in the film was introduced in the early stages of development, but the official decision as to how to bring him back was not reached until later. Nomura originally planned to have him appear from the start, but as it took the staff two years to develop his design, the idea of his presence throughout the film was scrapped, and it was decided instead to have him only appear onscreen for a short time. Sephiroth was designed for the film to emphasize his other-worldliness, such as the fact that he is never seen blinking or breathing, and his voice is always monotone and calm. In the film, the staff stated that his strength had considerably increased, to the point that he had &quot;ascended to a new level of existence&quot;.

Despite initially encountering problems as to who would voice him, Nomura said that once Toshiyuki Morikawa auditioned for the role, they knew they had their actor. Morikawa was instructed by the staff to speak all of Sephiroth&#x27;s dialogue as if he felt superior to every other character in the film. The voice director and Morikawa agreed to make Sephiroth&#x27;s voice sound calm to the point that he believes he &quot;cannot&quot; lose to Cloud, suggesting to Morikawa that he may reappear at some point in the future. In the prequel &quot;Crisis Core&quot;, Morikawa portrayed Sephiroth in a charismatic fashion, as early on Sephiroth is presented as a hero. The black wing that Sephiroth and the other Shinra expermients Angeal and Genesis show act as a sign of corruption.

For &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot;, Yoshinori Kitase wanted Sephiroth to have more scenes than in the original game due to his popularity, and compared him with the build of the film &quot;Jaws&quot;. In the climax of the remake, Cloud encounters Sephiroth once again, and his words following the fight were kept as ambiguous. While &quot;Remake&quot; and &quot;Rebirth&quot; focus on the adult Sephiroth, the mobile phone &quot;Ever Crisis&quot; and &quot;First SOLDIER&quot; instead focus on Sephiroth&#x27;s childhood where he was given a more sensitive characterization as he interacts with other characters related to SOLDIER. Nomura reworked the design to fit properly, focusing more on his shorter hair. Yuichiro Umehara was shocked upon being cast for Sephiroth&#x27;s role in the game, pressured due to how Morikawa already established Sephiroth&#x27;s popularity in previous installments. He was influenced by Morikawa&#x27;s presence when recording for the game to the point he feared Sephiroth did not sound as young as requested by the demands. As a result, he often talked with the director and the rest of the staff about how he should sound.

==Musical themes==
In &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Sephiroth is the focus of two pieces of music written by series composer Nobuo Uematsu. His primary theme is , a piece utilizing bells, low drums, and a deep chorus, which accompanies his appearances throughout the game. In the final battle, plays while the player fights Sephiroth&#x27;s first form, &quot;Bizarro Sephiroth&quot;, also known as &quot;Reverse Sephiroth&quot;. The most well-known piece is which is played during the final confrontation with Sephiroth. It contains Latin lyrics taken from sections of the Carmina Burana. In an interview featured on G4&#x27;s &quot;Game Makers&quot; (formerly &quot;Icons&quot;), Uematsu revealed that the piece was designed to be a fusion of the musical styles of Russian composer Igor Stravinsky and rock musician Jimi Hendrix. The song revolves around his character, as this was what Uematsu was thinking about when writing it. Two official covers have been done of the song. The first is an orchestration used in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, arranged by the series&#x27; composer Yoko Shimomura. The second is used in &quot;Advent Children&quot;, which plays throughout the battle between Cloud and Sephiroth and features the progressive metal stylings of Nobuo Uematsu&#x27;s former band The Black Mages, as well as orchestral elements and new lyrics. There is also a fourth version titled &quot;Vengeance on the World&quot;, which plays in &quot;Crisis Core&quot;.

==Appearances==
===In &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;===

Sephiroth is the main antagonist in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, who first appears after assassinating President Shinra. It is revealed over the course of the game that Sephiroth was once the most powerful member of SOLDIER, Shinra&#x27;s elite military division, who was celebrated as a heroic veteran of the Shinra-Wutai war. After the war, Sephiroth was sent on a mission to the village of Nibelheim, where he discovered that he was the product of a biological experiment that combined a human fetus with tissue from the extraterrestrial lifeform Jenova. Upon discovering the truth of his origins and the experiments that created him, Sephiroth developed an intense hatred for Shinra, which developed into hatred for all life. After learning that Jenova, who he comes to consider his &quot;mother&quot;, attempted to take control of the Planet 2,000 years ago, he decided to follow in her footsteps and become a god who would rule over the Planet. He burnt down Nibelheim, resulting in the deaths of many people, but was assumed dead after a confrontation with Cloud inside a nearby Mako reactor; this event came to be known as the Nibelheim incident. However, Cloud does not believe he killed Sephiroth, since his skill and might dwarfs his, and acknowledges Sephiroth most likely had won, but spared him for unknown reasons. However, a few years later, Sephiroth reappears, determined to continue with his mission.

His plan to become a god is based upon his belief that he can merge with the Planet&#x27;s Lifestream, taking control of it and the Planet itself. To do so, he must summon Meteor, a destructive meteorite entity from outer space capable of catastrophically damaging the Planet. At this point, the Lifestream will flow to attempt to heal the injury, allowing Sephiroth to merge with it and its Spirit Energy. Despite appearing multiple times throughout the game, it is revealed that Sephiroth&#x27;s physical body is actually sealed in the Northern Crater. The Sephiroth Cloud and his allies fought were parts of Jenova&#x27;s body taking on his appearance and remotely controlled by Sephiroth from the Planet&#x27;s core. In the game&#x27;s final battle, Sephiroth takes on two final forms. The first is called Bizarro Sephiroth, which is known as in the original Japanese version, meaning &quot;The Core of Sephiroth&quot; or &quot;Sephiroth&#x27;s Core&quot; in Hebrew (ליבת ספירות). The second is called Safer Sephiroth, which is known as in the original Japanese version, meaning &quot;Final Sephiroth&quot; or &quot;The Last Part of Sephiroth&quot; in Hebrew (סיפא ספירות). After his defeat, Sephiroth reappears only to Cloud as an apparition, and the exhausted duo fight once again. Cloud eventually wins the fight and kills Sephiroth with his sword. With Sephiroth dead, Aerith&#x27;s prior magic manages to deflect the meteor towards only Midgar, shielding the rest of the world from its impact. Many years later, Midgar is shown to be healing, possibly being able to be saved in the years to come.

===In &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot;===
Sephiroth makes several cameo appearances in the &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; prequel, &quot;Before Crisis&quot;, in which he supports Shinra in their battle against the eco-terrorist organization AVALANCHE. The Nibelheim incident is also featured in the game. The OVA &quot;Last Order&quot; also depicts the Nibelheim incident. Sephiroth also appears in &quot;Advent Children&quot;, a CGI film set two years after &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. In the film, Kadaj, Loz, and Yazoo, his &quot;Remnants&quot;, try to reincarnate him. Although Kadaj eventually succeeds, Cloud once again defeats Sephiroth, whose body changes back to Kadaj&#x27;s upon his defeat. Sephiroth is also the focus of the &quot;On the Way to a Smile&quot; novella &quot;Case of the Lifestream — Black and White&quot;. The story is set after the end of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; but prior to the events of &quot;Advent Children&quot;, and centers on Aerith and Sephiroth&#x27;s journeys through the Lifestream and Sephiroth&#x27;s creation of Geostigma, a disease that infects anyone who came into contact with the tainted Lifestream. He is mentioned in &quot;Dirge of Cerberus&quot;, a game set one year after &quot;Advent Children&quot;, in which his biological mother, Lucrecia Crescent, discusses the experiments which gave birth to him.

==== &quot;Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII&quot; ====
He is one of the main characters in the &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; prequel &quot;Crisis Core&quot;, in which he and protagonist Zack Fair search for two missing SOLDIERs, Genesis Rhapsodos and Angeal Hewley, This game also depicts the Nibelheim incident, where Sephiroth appears as a boss. Executive producer Yoshinori Kitase was pleased with Sephiroth&#x27;s role in &quot;Crisis Core&quot;, feeling that he was given a more human side.

==== &quot;Remake&quot; and &quot;Rebirth&quot; continuity ====
Sephiroth appears in &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot; as the main antagonist. While his role as a presumed dead Shinra SOLDIER remain similar, Sephiroth now appears in the early hours of the game as an illusion to taunt Cloud and warn him to leave the Planet. He also projects himself as a &quot;Sephiroth-clone&quot; named Marco. In the final hours, Sephiroth appears in the Shinra building, showcasing his goal to summon Meteor destroying Midgar; and killing President Shinra before fleeing. After the group escapes Shinra&#x27;s troops, Sephiroth awaits them at the end of the Midgar Expressway, where he acts as the final boss. Defeated, Sephiroth spares Cloud and gives him &quot;seven seconds until the end&quot; before disappearing, leaving behind only a fallen black feather.

In &quot;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&quot;, Sephiroth appears as a playable character and party member in the game&#x27;s first chapter &quot;Fall of a Hero&quot;, which depicts their survey for the Nibelheim&#x27;s reactor, and his villainous origins with the infamous Nibelheim incident. In the present time, Sephiroth taunts Cloud again with illusions. He is then pursued by Cloud and the party, where they encounter Sephiroth-clones as well. Sephiroth later manipulates Cloud into giving him the &quot;Black Materia&quot; to summon Meteor. When Aerith attempts to stop him by summoning Cloud into an alternate reality, Sephiroth appears behind and swiftly kills her, prompting the party to avenge her. However, Sephiroth transforms as &quot;Sephiroth Reborn&quot; and upon defeat, flees in the northern regions.

===Other appearances===
Sephiroth&#x27;s first appearance outside &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; was as a selectable character in the fighting game &quot;Ehrgeiz&quot;. A redesigned Sephiroth also appears in the North American and European versions of &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; as an optional boss character in Olympus Coliseum. Lance Bass voiced Sephiroth in the game, while in subsequent titles he was replaced by George Newbern. In the Japanese re-release of the game, &quot;Final Mix&quot;, an additional scene was added in which Sephiroth fights Cloud, although the result of the fight is not revealed. Sephiroth was not included in the sequel &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot;, as director Tetsuya Nomura could not give him a storyline related to Cloud, and feared negative fan response if Sephiroth did not have a notable role in the story. He reappears as an optional boss in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, where he is first encountered by the series&#x27; protagonist, Sora, and then Cloud, who is pursuing him. When Sephiroth battles Cloud, both of them disappear, with Sora believing that they went somewhere else to continue their fight. Nomura said that in the game, Sephiroth represents Cloud&#x27;s dark side, in contrast to Tifa Lockhart, who represents his light side. Although Sephiroth does not appear in the prequel &quot;Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep&quot;, he is mentioned as a hero that Zack Fair aspires to be. The staff, however, did not know if they would portray him as a being of darkness like he was depicted as in other titles. Due to Sephiroth&#x27;s many appearances as a boss in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series, Square Enix decided he would not return in &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;, as it would be redundant. Sephiroth also appears in the &quot;Itadaki Street&quot; games &quot;Special&quot; and &quot;Portable&quot; as an unlockable playable character.

Sephiroth was also the representative villain of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; in &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot;, and is featured in his &quot;FFVII&quot; guise, while an alternative outfit features his &quot;Safer Sephiroth&quot; form. His fight against Cloud in the game was based on their fights from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;Advent Children&quot;. Along with the rest of the &quot;VII&quot; characters in &quot;Dissidia&quot;, Sephiroth appears in the prequel &quot;Dissidia 012&quot;. The game includes a slightly altered &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; form for Sephiroth, as well as his &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; form. Sephiroth returns as a playable character opposite Cloud in the third entry, &quot;Dissidia NT&quot;. His form from &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot; also appeared in &quot;Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&quot;. He is featured in the rhythm game &quot;Theatrhythm Final Fantasy&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Curtain Call&quot;, as an unlockable character, representing &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. He appears in the puzzle-platform game &quot;LittleBigPlanet&quot;, and its sequel as a character model; Media Molecule&#x27;s Alex Evans felt &quot;honored&quot; that Sephiroth was allowed to appear in the games. He also appeared as a cameo in &quot;Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate&quot; as a weapon, which was designed as a single black wing, referencing Sephiroth&#x27;s appearance during the final battle of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. Sephiroth was included as a playable fighter in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, as the third fighter in Fighters Pass Vol. 2. Despite being officially released on December 22, 2020, he was made available five days prior for a limited time via an event called the Sephiroth Challenge, in which the player must defeat him in a &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;-themed stamina match.

==Cultural impact==
===Merchandise===
Sephiroth has served as the basis for several types of merchandise, such as the &quot;Extra Knights&quot; action figures first published by Bandai in Japan in 1997. A different model was released as part of the &quot;Play Arts&quot; collection, following the release of &quot;Advent Children&quot;. At the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con, Kanji Tashiro, Square Enix&#x27;s manager of merchandise, said that the figure was one of their best-selling items. With the release of the film, Sephiroth was also included in a series of promotional material, primarily consisting of posters. Kotobukiya has included the character in numerous merchandise, including a series of cold casts based on his appearance in both the original game and the film sequel. As part of promotional campaigns organized in Japan by Square Enix and Coca-Cola, a version of Sephiroth drawn in a super deformed style was featured in the first two volumes of a promotional collection.

Products not connected to the release of games or films have also been produced. These include a figure as part of the &quot;Final Fantasy Trading Arts Vol. 1&quot; series, a set as part of the &quot;Square Minimum Collection&quot; alongside Cloud, and a rare figure of &quot;Safer Sephiroth&quot; as part of the &quot;Final Fantasy Creatures&quot; series (Chromium). &quot;Reverse Sephiroth&quot; was also released as a normal figure in volume 2. A figure based on his appearances in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; games was released in the second series of the &quot;Play Arts Kingdom Hearts&quot; sub-line. Some replica weapon companies have produced replicas of Sephiroth&#x27;s sword, the Masamune, as a katana with a stainless steel unsharpened blade. A statue at Kyoto University depicting Sephiroth was also made. Sephiroth received an amiibo figurine for use in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, which was released in January 2022.

The OLED update to the Steam Deck, which was announced in 2023, replaces the system&#x27;s accelerated processing unit (APU), built using 7 nm processing and nicknamed Aerith, with a newer 6 nm-based APU named Sephiroth.

==Reception==
On multiple occasions, numerous gaming magazines, including &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot;, described Sephiroth as one of the best video game bosses, and best villains from both the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series and in video games. Dave Smith of &quot;IGN&quot; called him the &quot;heavyweight champion of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; villains&quot;, and praised his appearance and backstory. Sephiroth was also named the 14th-best character of all time in &quot;Dengeki PlayStation&quot;″s retrospective awards feature about the original PlayStation. Professional wrestler Kenny Omega wore a Sephiroth-style ring outfit with a &quot;One-Winged-Angel&quot; entrance at Wrestle Kingdom 17, and additionally sported the attire as part of a downloadable content bundle in the 2023 remake of the 2014 game &quot;Like a Dragon: Ishin!&quot;. Adi Shankar cites Sephiroth as an artistic and stylistic influence.

===Critical response===
A reader&#x27;s choice poll organized by &quot;GameSpot&quot; placed Sephiroth as the best boss of all time, receiving five times more votes than Bowser, who finished in second place; most of the comments noted the difficulty of the final fight against him, as well as its distinctive elements when compared to other games. His boss battle appeared in &quot;1UP&quot;″s &quot;25 More of the Most Badass Boss Fights Ever&quot; in which the staff praised how the original battle from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; was expanded in the title. &quot;AnimeFringe&quot; called him &quot;the most notorious villain in the entire &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series&quot; and &quot;quintessential bishōnen in the eyes of many fans -- male and female&quot;, comparing him with Kefka and praising his complexity. According to Inside Games, Sephiroth stands out from previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games because his humanity and heroic nature is early explored which draws parallels to famous figures like Sasaki Kojiro or the lead character from &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot;.

The scene in which Sephiroth kills Aerith has also prompted much commentary. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; called him &quot;the biggest cock blocker in the gaming world&quot;, as writer Shane Patterson found Aerith&#x27;s character to be appealing, and due to the fact Sephiroth killed her, players were no longer able to use her. Also referring to the scene as a shocking moment, &quot;GameSpot&quot; suggested that the FMV sequence of Sephiroth appearing in front of the Nibelheim fire &quot;might be one of the most recognizable cutscenes ever to grace video games&quot;.

However, some game editors have criticized Sephiroth&#x27;s character. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Smith has stated that &quot;Sephiroth was certainly a good-looking fellow, but his motivations were about as clear as mud&quot;. When comparing Sephiroth with the &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; villain, Kefka Palazzo, &quot;GamesRadar&quot; commented that he &quot;seems as interesting as a dead accountant painted brown&quot;, while &quot;Screen Rant&quot; said that &quot;Sephiroth is an iconic character, but not the most interesting villain to emerge from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise&quot;. &quot;GameSpy&quot; editor Ryan Scott called Sephiroth the &quot;King of Overrated Characters&quot; during its villain feature for &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot;, arguing that gamers were impressed by him only because of his design and him murdering Aerith.

Critics have also commented on Sephiroth&#x27;s role in works. &quot;Destructoid&quot; noted there was a message within the writing of the film regarding the characters&#x27; lives in Midgar, as the people of Midgar are able to move on with their lives, but Cloud is unable to due to past trauma. They compared this to how the team behind &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and its fans are still attached to it and unable to move on. &quot;Kotaku&quot; saw the focus on Midgar&#x27;s ruins as a parallel with psychological trauma due to how its survivors are suffering from Geostigma, a disease that cannot be fought physically, in contrast to Cloud&#x27;s fights with Sephiroth. Yoshinori Kitase stated that the popularity of the fight between Cloud and Sephiroth caused Japanese gamers to do a remake of it for &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot; and expected that Western fans would also emulate it. In relation to &quot;Crisis Core&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot; AU said that &quot;even Sephiroth gets his moments in the sun&quot;, praising the depth in his backstory, which would later make his boss battle more entertaining. &quot;IGN&quot; UK had a similar sentiment, stating that his character was granted &quot;a more human dimension&quot; and enjoying the events from before his descent into villainy. Though Meristation found Sephiroth to be more friendly in the prequel, his relationship with Genesis was criticized for influencing his decisions rather than him acting of his own will.

The idea that there are four characters with Sephiroth&#x27;s name led &quot;VG247&quot; to note the remake still had its own mysteries that original players would not understand while the title. &quot;Siliconera&quot; described this incarnation of Sephiroth as haunting, due to how he often appears within Cloud&#x27;s hallucinations across the plot. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; felt the remake&#x27;s depiction of Sephiroth was more menacing than in the original due to his constant threats towards Cloud. Tyler Hoechlin&#x27;s work as Sephiroth was the subject of praise. &quot;Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis&#x27;s&quot; depiction of a young Sephiroth drew praise from fans. Sephiroth being playable in &quot;Rebirth&quot; also attracted positive response due to his friendlier relationship with Cloud during their visit to Nibelheim.

Several writers also noted Sephiroth&#x27;s overpowered nature as a &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; boss, noting that, regardless of the player&#x27;s skill, &quot;walking away from this match unscathed&quot; is not possible, and stating that the fight was more difficult than the entirety of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. &quot;AnimeFringe&quot; stated that only advanced gamers would be able to defeat &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;″s Sephiroth, as the player has no backup and his &quot;devastating attacks can kill in seconds&quot;. After the addition of Sephiroth to &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,&quot; Masahiro Sakurai acknowledged the belief that there are too many sword fighters in the roster, stating that &quot;Well, even if it is another sword fighter, it will be fine as long as we balance them properly&quot;. Chris Carter of &quot;Destructoid&quot; and Ethan Gach of &quot;Kotaku&quot; both praised the addition of Sephiroth.

===Analysis===
In &quot;Reverse Design: Final Fantasy VII&quot;, it was noted that Sephiroth&#x27;s desire for world domination makes him come across as simpleminded, but the lack of humanity in his background serves as the cause for this characterization. It was also noted that Sephiroth may come across as lost in his own insanity, he is also intelligent and cunning. In the book &quot;The World of Final Fantasy VII: Essays on the Game and Its Legacy&quot;, it is stated that Sephiroth&#x27;s realization of his connection with Jenova and his descent into villainy caused him to lose his humanity makes him comparable to Satan. Like Satan, Sephiroth claims he will never die, most notably in &quot;Advent Children&quot;, as upon being defeated by Cloud, he tells him &quot;I will never be a memory&quot;. His origins as a test subject to Hojo have been compared to Frankenstein&#x27;s monster.

Although Sephiroth is not based on any mythical figure, in &quot;The Secret Mythology of Final Fantasy&quot;, his final boss form was compared to &quot;777 and Other Qabalistic Writings of Aleister Crowley&quot;, which also explores Hermetic Qabalah. &quot;PCGamer&quot; saw Sephiroth as Cloud&#x27;s shadow, who he has to surpass as his mental issues and vulnerability are connected to their past, which &quot;Kotaku&quot; agreed with.

<text>The NCAA Skiing Championships are held annually to crown the National Collegiate Athletic Association combined men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s team skiing champion. Before 1983, the championship was only for men&#x27;s skiing. Unlike many NCAA sports, only one National Collegiate championship is held each season with teams from Division I, Division II, and Division III competing together.

The University of Denver has won a record 24 team titles, including ten since 2000. The University of Colorado is second with 20 titles (plus one AIAW title), and the University of Utah is third with 14 (plus one AIAW title).

Denver won the first NCAA championship in 1954 at Reno with 384 points, 34.4 points ahead of runner-up Seattle University. The scoring system has been modified over the years; in 2012, Vermont scored a record 832 points, with a record margin of 161 points over second-place Utah.

The 2020 edition started on schedule, but was canceled in progress due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="576757" wikidata="Q310342" url="?curid=576757" title="Jebel Akhdar (Libya)">
<text>The Jebel Akhdar ( , , ) is a heavily forested, fertile upland area in northeastern Libya. It is located in the modern &quot;shabiyahs&quot; or districts of Derna, Jabal al Akhdar, and Marj.

==Geography==
The Jebel Akhdar consists of a mountainous plateau rising to an altitude of , cut by several valleys and wadis. It forms the north-western part of the peninsula that sticks north into the Mediterranean Sea, with the Gulf of Sidra on the west, and the Levantine Basin on the east. It runs from Bengazi eastward to just east of Derna, fronting the coast for about . Due to erosion and deposition, the plateau is sometimes as much as from the shore, but it forms cliffs on the headlands. The final uplift and arching of the plateau was completed in the Miocene.

The region is one of the very few forested areas of Libya, which taken as a whole is one of the least forested countries on Earth. The Jebel Akhdar is the wettest part of Libya, receiving some of precipitation annually. The high rainfall contributes to the area&#x27;s large forests containing Chammari, and enables rich fruit, potato, and cereal agriculture, something of a rarity in an arid country like Libya. Camels, goats and sheep are herded in and around the Jebel Akhdar and the herders tend to be nomadic.

==Flora==

In marked contrast to the aridity prevailing in most of Libya, there are forested areas in this region totalling around 3200 km2, although approximately a third of the original forest has already been destroyed to make way for agriculture. In addition to the forests there are also large areas of maquis and steppe-like vegetation. Typical maquis species are the Phoenician juniper (&quot;Juniperus phoenicea&quot;), the mastic tree (&quot;Pistacia lentiscus&quot;), the Kermes oak (&quot;Quercus coccifera&quot;) and the carob tree (&quot;Ceratonia siliqua&quot;). In the drier steppe-like areas, branched asphodel (&quot;Asphodelus ramosus&quot;), prickly burnet (Sarcopoterium spinosum) and white wormwood (&quot;Artemisia herba-alba&quot;) predominate.
More than half of the endemic plant species in Libya are to be found in the Jebel Akhdar and, of these, seven are found only in the region: &quot;Arbutus pavarii&quot;, &quot;Arum cyrenaicum&quot;, &quot;Bellis sylvestris var. cyrenaica&quot;, &quot;Cyclamen rohlfsianum&quot;, &quot;Cynara cyrenaica&quot;, &quot;Onopordum cyrenaicum&quot; and &quot;Romulea cyrenaica&quot;. 

==History==
===Ancient===

Documents created during the New Kingdom of Egypt record that to the west there were large populations of metal workers who lived in towns and had plentiful livestock. The only plausible location for these &quot;Libyans&quot; is the Jebel Akhdar.

The ancient Greek colony of Cyrene was located in a lush valley in the Jebel Akhdar, with the ruins remaining. It was the Greeks who introduced farming to the Jebal Akhdar when they colonised its verdant valleys in around 600 BC.

===Italian occupation===
During the Italian occupation these mountains were identified as a promising area for agriculture and many Italians moved here in the 1930s. This settlement was interrupted during World War II and the villages and farms were deserted and were later reoccupied by Libyans. The mountain chain was the site of major battles between the British Commonwealth and the Axis forces during World War II.

===Liberation===
The Libyan leader Omar al-Mukhtar used this heavily forested mountainous region to resist the Italian colonization of Libya for more than twenty years.

<doc id="576758" wikidata="Q8010470" url="?curid=576758" title="William H. Keith Jr.">
<text>William H. Keith (born August 8, 1950) is an American author mainly contributing to military science fiction and military fiction and related game design, who writes also under several pen names, such as Ian Douglas, Robert Cain and H. Jay Riker. His newer original works are written under the name of Ian Douglas.

==Early life==
William H. Keith grew up with his brother J. Andrew Keith.

William H. Keith served in the United States Navy as a hospital corpsman from 1969 to 1972 during the Vietnam War era.

==Career==
William H. Keith Jr. and his brother J. Andrew Keith noticed ads in &quot;Journal of the Travellers Aid Society&quot; which announced that Game Designers&#x27; Workshop (GDW) was looking for authors; Loren Wiseman hired them to start freelancing for GDW in 1978 or 1979, and the three worked together on a lot of the early material for the &quot;Traveller&quot; universe. William Keith also contributed heavily to the graphical appearance of that era of &quot;Traveller&quot; releases. The Keith brothers began earning enough money that they were able to do freelance work full-time beginning around 1979. The Keith brothers began working for FASA by the end of 1980, with William Keith contributing artwork for the magazine &quot;High Passage&quot; beginning in 1981. FASA began publishing adventures for &quot;Traveller&quot; beginning with &quot;Ordeal by Eshaar&quot; (1981) by the Keith brothers, who then wrote the &quot;Sky Raiders&quot; trilogy (1981-1982) for FASA. William Keith designed the role-playing game &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot; (1982), the first RPG set in the 1940s. FASA ended its support of &quot;Traveller&quot; in 1983, so the Keith brothers continued writing for &quot;Traveller&quot; with the new company Gamelords, but continued to work for FASA on other projects. The Keith brothers authored seven &quot;Traveller&quot; supplements published by Gamelords, including &quot;The Mountain Environment&quot; (1983), &quot;The Undersea Environment&quot; (1983), and &quot;The Desert Environment&quot; (1984), and adventures intended for the environments described in those rulebooks.

The Keith brothers produced some material for the &quot;Chivalry &amp; Sorcery&quot; line in 1984, and in 1985 they began working on other lines for Fantasy Games Unlimited including &quot;Aftermath!&quot;, &quot;Daredevils&quot;, &quot;Flashing Blades&quot;, and &quot;Psi World&quot;. The Keith brothers also designed &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot; (1986), one of the final role-playing games published by FGU. William Keith authored &quot;Delta Force: America Strikes Back!&quot; (1986), the first role-playing game from Task Force Games. William Keith wrote &quot;Decision at Thunder Rift&quot; (1986), the first novel published by FASA. William Keith authored a large &quot;MegaTraveller&quot; campaign set in the Gateway sector for &quot;The MegaTraveller Journal&quot; #4 (1993), the final publication of Digest Group Publications.

William Keith became a professional artist and writer, working in the game industry with his brother Andrew, particularly for Game Designers&#x27; Workshop and FASA before becoming a full-time author. Much of his early work, including the &quot;Warstrider&quot; series, the &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Rangers&quot; series, the &quot;Cybernarc&quot; series, and the &quot;Invaders of Charon&quot; series, is currently out of print; &#x27;Warstrider&#x27; will be re-released in 2014. He was also an early author for BattleTech, writing the saga of the Gray Death Legion.

Keith also writes under various pseudonyms and &quot;house names&quot;, including Ian Douglas and H. Jay Riker, and is a shadow author of several books &quot;by&quot; celebrities. He has written extensively in Keith Laumer&#x27;s &quot;Bolo&quot; series, contributing several short stories to the Bolo anthologies, as well as three full-length books, &quot;Bolo Brigade&quot;, &quot;Bolo Strike&quot;, and &quot;Bolo Rising&quot;. As Ian Douglas, he writes military science fiction: the &quot;Galactic Marines&quot; series (composed of the &quot;Heritage Trilogy&quot;, the &quot;Legacy Trilogy&quot;, and the &quot;Inheritance Trilogy&quot;), and the newer &quot;Star Carrier&quot; series. As H. Jay Riker he writes military fiction: a series about the United States Navy SEALs progression from World War II through the Vietnam War, Desert Storm, and Iraqi Freedom, and another series, &quot;The Silent Service&quot;, about the United States submarine service.

Other novels include &quot;Diplomatic Act&quot; with Peter Jurasik, and &quot;Two of Minds&quot;, nominated for a Newbery Award. He also continued Keith Laumer&#x27;s Retief series with &quot;Retief&#x27;s Peace&quot;. His first non-fiction book, &quot;The Science of the Craft&quot;, was published in 2005; it is about the link between witchcraft and science.

Keith&#x27;s recent work includes three books in Stephen Coonts&#x27; &quot;Deep Black&quot; series; a police procedural/detective novel in the Android universe; and a new series about Navy Hospital Corpsmen in the future.

Keith, a Wiccan and a Reiki master, is also a member of Western Pennsylvania Mensa.

<text>After Henry is a British sitcom written by Simon Brett. It started on BBC Radio 4 and later moved to television. Prunella Scales and Joan Sanderson starred in both radio and television versions.

A novel, also by Simon Brett, followed the series.

==Cast==
*Prunella Scales – Sarah France
*Joan Sanderson – Eleanor Prescott
*Gerry Cowper – Clare France
*Benjamin Whitrow – Russell Bryant

==Plot==
Sarah France is the 42-year-old widow of a GP, Henry. She lives in an often volatile family situation with her mother, Eleanor Prescott, and her daughter, eighteen-year-old Clare France. After Henry&#x27;s death, the three generations of women have to cope with one another as best they can, under their shared roof.

Sarah often finds herself in the middle of things, usually figuratively but always literally, as her mother lives upstairs and her daughter has the downstairs flat. Eleanor, ruthlessly cunning and emotionally manipulative, takes every opportunity to get one over on Sarah. Anything told to Eleanor will spread quickly throughout the extensive &quot;geriatric mafia&quot;, the elderly of the area. Clare is trying to be independent of her mother, though often has to come running back in times of crisis.

The relationships among the three women change constantly through each episode. Sometimes mother and daughter ally against grandmother, sometimes mother and grandmother go against daughter, but usually grandmother and granddaughter gang up on the long-suffering Sarah, whose one haven is Bygone Books, the remarkably unsuccessful second-hand bookshop where she works for Russell, who dispenses in turn sympathy and wisdom. Most of the time, Russell sees the women&#x27;s relationships second-hand through Sarah, although he isn&#x27;t opposed to taking the occasional more active role when necessary. In turn, Sarah can see some of Russell&#x27;s difficulties of living with a gay partner in 1980s London suburbia, while at the same time seeing Russell&#x27;s relationship as the one perfect marriage she knows.

==Episode list==
==Transfer to television==

The BBC was reluctant to produce &quot;After Henry&quot; for television, so in 1988 after the third radio series Thames Television did so. Prunella Scales and Joan Sanderson returned as Sarah and Eleanor, but Gerry Cowper was, at the age of 30, considered too old to play Clare and was replaced by Janine Wood. Benjamin Whitrow was replaced in the role of Russell by Jonathan Newth. The show was popular, attracting over 14 million viewers. A second television series was shown during the same months as the fourth radio series with, in many cases, both radio and television episodes being broadcast on the same nights. The fourth television series was broadcast from July 1992, after the death of Joan Sanderson, who had died on 24 May.

<text>The Warstrider series is a series of novels by William H. Keith, Jr., a former author of licensed BattleTech tie-in novels. 

==Premise==
The future. Japan has taken control of Earth politics and of the majority of human colonies on other worlds and humanity is engaged with aliens known as Xenophobes. Humanity has never managed to communicate with the Xenophobes and only has the latter&#x27;s attacks to learn about them. Later books detail humanity&#x27;s conflict with itself, and a race of artificial beings called the Web. A subplot involves collective intelligence.

==Development==
&quot;This was my baby, my first SF series that was entirely my own universe. It&#x27;s set in the 26th century and involves fringe-of-empire settlers breaking away from an overbearing Earth government dominated by the Japanese Empire [...] which had the sense to grab the high ground of space when the U.S. abandoned it in the early 2000s. Most of the first book revolves around a war with some VERY strange aliens, while the rest pit frontier rebels against the Empire[,] [...] then involve both in a struggle against a malevolent AI machine threat from the Galactic Core.&quot; From the William H. Keith, Jr. website

<doc id="576772" wikidata="Q349013" url="?curid=576772" title="Roger Hargreaves">
<text>Roger Hargreaves (9 May 1935 – 11 September 1988) was a British cartoonist, illustrator and writer of children&#x27;s books. He created the &quot;Mr. Men&quot; series, &quot;Little Miss&quot; series and &quot;Timbuctoo&quot; series, intended for young readers. The simple and humorous stories, with bold, brightly coloured illustrations, have sales of more than 85 million copies worldwide in 20 languages. 

==Birth==
Charles Roger Hargreaves was born in a private hospital at 1 Bath Road, Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire, England, on 9 May 1935 to Alfred Reginald Hargreaves and Ethel Mary Hargreaves. He grew up at 703 Halifax Road, Hartshead Moor, Cleckheaton, outside of which there now is a commemorative plaque.

==Early life==
Hargreaves attended Sowerby Bridge Grammar School (now Trinity Academy Sowerby Bridge). He then spent a year working in his father&#x27;s laundry and dry-cleaning business before gaining employment in advertising. By 1968, he was creative director of the Foote, Cone &amp; Belding agency where he wrote slogans such as &quot;Emigrate to Canada Dry (for the sake of your Scotch)&quot;. Originally wanting to become a cartoonist, in 1971, he created a successful series of characters used to promote Askit Powders on television (these were used from 1971 to 1994).

==Career==
Also, in 1971 while working as the creative director at a London firm, he wrote the first Mr. Men book, &quot;Mr. Tickle&quot;. Initially, he had difficulty finding a publisher, but once he did, the books became an instant success, selling more than one million copies within three years. In 1974, the books spawned a BBC animated television series narrated by Arthur Lowe. A second series the following year saw newer titles transmitted in double bill format with those from the first series.

By 1976, Hargreaves had quit his day job. In 1981, the Little Miss series of books was launched and in 1983, it also was made into a television series narrated by Pauline Collins and her husband, John Alderton. Although Hargreaves wrote many other children&#x27;s stories—including the Timbuctoo series of 25 books, John Mouse and the Roundy and Squarey books—he is best known for his 46 Mr. Men and 33 Little Miss books.

==Death==
Between 1975 and 1982, Hargreaves lived with his family on Guernsey. Then, they settled at Sussex House Farm near Cowden, Kent. Hargreaves died on 11 September 1988 at the age of 53 and at the Kent and Sussex Hospital in Royal Tunbridge Wells following a stroke. He was buried in Cowden, East Sussex. He bought the adjacent field to the grave yard at Cowden Church so that he could be buried there. After his death, his son, Adam, continued writing and drawing the Mr. Men and Little Miss characters with new stories (while signing the covers in his father&#x27;s signature). In April 2004, Hargreaves&#x27; widow Christine sold the rights to the Mr. Men characters to the UK entertainment group Chorion, for £28 million. In December 2011, Chorion sold the Mr. Men brand and its associated merchandise business to Japan&#x27;s Sanrio.

On 4 March 2021, Hargreaves was posthumously awarded a gold &quot;Blue Peter&quot; badge.

==Family==
Hargreaves and his wife had four children: Adam, Giles and twins Sophie and Amelia. The first of the Mr. Men characters was allegedly created when Hargreaves&#x27; son Adam, then aged 8, asked his father what a tickle looked like. Hargreaves drew a figure with a round orange body and long arms which became Mr. Tickle.

<doc id="576775" wikidata="Q336859" url="?curid=576775" title="Arthur Wellesley, 4th Duke of Wellington">
<text>Arthur Charles Wellesley, 4th Duke of Wellington (15 March 1849 – 18 June 1934), styled Lord Arthur Wellesley from 1884 to 1900, was a British peer and politician, and a member of the well-known Wellesley family. He joined the military and served in the Household Division. Upon his childless brother&#x27;s death in 1900, he inherited the family title and estates.

== Early life and career ==
Wellesley was born in 1849, the second son of Major-General Lord Charles Wellesley and Augusta Sophia Anne Pierrepont. Wellesley&#x27;s paternal grandparents included the famous Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, Catherine Pakenham and, on the maternal side, Henry Pierrepont, Lady Sophia Cecil. Between 1861 and 1866, he was educated at Eton. After graduating, Wellesley joined the military. He served as an officer in the Grenadier Guards, the most senior regiment of the Guards&#x27; division. The Guards formed part of the Household Division, the elite of the military that provided security for the monarch. To be selected as a member of the Household Division was a great honour, and consequently, recipients received two ranks, one as a member of the Household Division and a second, higher rank, as a member of the armed forces. Wellesley received the rank of Ensign, in his regiment, and Lieutenant, in the British Army, on 13 June 1868. He would later gain the rank of Lieutenant, in his regiment, and Captain, in the British Army, on 15 February 1871.

== Later life and career ==

Throughout his career Wellesley saw no combat action: his duties were largely ceremonial as part of the Household Guard. He received the rank Captain in his regiment and Lieutenant-Colonel in the British Army on 5 April 1879. Wellesley received the rank of Major in his regiment and Colonel in the British Army on 1 August 1887.

On 8 June 1900, his childless brother Henry died. Wellesley succeeded to all of his brother&#x27;s titles: Duke of Wellington, Prince of Waterloo, Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo, and Duke of Victoria. He also inherited the London town-house, Apsley House, and the sprawling family estates of Stratfield Saye House, with over of land granted to the first duke by parliamentary purchase for military services. The estate also included four advowsons; Wellesley had the duty, right, and obligation to select the chief clergyman of those parishes.

From 1900 until 1934 Wellesley was a member of the House of Lords on the Conservative benches. He was also a member of the Marlborough Club, a gentleman&#x27;s club.

The Duchess died on 24 June 1927 at Apsley House and was interred on 28 June at Stratfield Saye. Wellesley died at Ewhurst Park (House), Basingstoke, Hampshire, on 18 June (Waterloo Day) 1934, aged eighty-five, and was buried three days later at Stratfield Saye House, Hampshire, the home conferred on the Dukes of Wellington. His probate was sworn that year at ; a further grant was in 1936, for , all of which excluded underlying third-party family interests in entrusted land and any gifts before death.

His son, Arthur, succeeded him to the Wellesley family estates and titles.

==Honours==

The Duke received the Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) on 1 May 1902. He was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Garter (KG) in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, and was invested by King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 8 August 1902. He was also awarded the Spanish decoration of the Grand Cross of Charles III, and the Portuguese decoration of the Grand Cross of the Tower and Sword (GCTE), and the Prussian decorations of the Order of the Black Eagle and the Order of the Red Eagle.

== Family ==
On 24 October 1872, he married Kathleen Emily Bulkeley Williams, daughter of Captain Robert Griffith Williams (brother of Sir Richard Bulkeley Williams-Bulkeley, 10th Baronet) and wife Mary Anne Geale (daughter of Piers Geale, of Dublin). He and his wife had six children :

*Lady Evelyn Kathleen Wellesley (30 July 1873 – 19 January 1922) married Hon. Robert James, had one son

<doc id="576792" wikidata="Q3376011" url="?curid=576792" title="Privy Purse">
<text>The Privy Purse is the British sovereign&#x27;s private income, mostly from the Duchy of Lancaster. This amounted to £20.1 million in net income for the year to 31 March 2018.

==Overview==
The Duchy is a landed estate of approximately 46,000 acres (200 square kilometres) held in trust for the sovereign since 1399. It also has of foreshore. The Duchy was valued at approximately £533 million in 2018. The land is organised into the Lancashire Survey, the Yorkshire Survey, the Crewe Survey, the Needwood Estate and the South Survey.

The sovereign is not entitled to the Duchy&#x27;s capital, but the net revenues of the Duchy are the property of the sovereign in right of the Duchy of Lancaster. While the income is private, the King uses the larger part of it to meet official expenses incurred by other members of the British royal family. Only the King receives payments from Parliament that are not reimbursed by the King.

==Administrators==

===Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster===
The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who is the equivalent of the chairman of the trustees, has for the past several centuries always been a Government minister, although this is not a requirement.

===Keeper of the Privy Purse===
The Keeper of the Privy Purse looks after the sovereign&#x27;s personal financial affairs. His title is derived from the Privy Purse (an embroidered bag borne by the Keeper at a coronation) which contrasts with his Department&#x27;s present-day use of computers and up-to-date accounting procedures. He manages the revenues which come from the Duchy of Lancaster. The Privy Purse meets both official expenditure incurred by The King as sovereign and private expenditure.

===Treasurer to the King===
In recent years, the office of Keeper has been held jointly with that of Treasurer to the King, who is responsible for the use of the Civil List, funds used to meet official expenditure relating to the King&#x27;s duties as Head of State. He also oversees the grant-in-aid from the Royal Household for the maintenance of the occupied Royal Palaces and for royal travel. He is also responsible for the property maintenance of the Occupied Royal Palaces (such as Buckingham Palace and St James&#x27;s Palace) and their gardens, for the financial aspects of royal travel, for personnel matters in the Royal Household, for the King&#x27;s private estates (which include Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House) and for the commercial activities of the Royal Collection Trust (for which annual accounts are published).

==History==

In the past, Great Britain&#x27;s civil government day-to-day costs were paid for by the sovereign under normal circumstances, the monies in this Public Purse being raised from the income of the Crown Estate lands and holdings. Under extraordinary circumstances, namely in time of war or during budget shortfalls, Parliament raised additional monies through taxation. The system was to a large degree self-funding through the Crown&#x27;s large holdings, taxes being applied only when necessary, and almost always at the risk of public outcry. Taxes were normally very low, and the necessity to go to Parliament to fund wars was an effective check on the monarch&#x27;s power.

As the role of the government increased in the 18th century, the Public Purse was increasingly unable to raise enough to fund the development of the country. In 1760 when George III came to the throne, it was decided that the whole cost of civil government should be provided by Parliament, with the Crown surrendering most of the hereditary revenues (principally the net surplus of the Crown Estate) by the king for the duration of the reign. In this system, Parliament was responsible for the finances of the state, including paying the Crown the Civil List allowance to meet the sovereign&#x27;s official expenses. In the fiscal year 2007/2008, the Crown Estate paid the Treasury £211.0 million in return for £7.9 million in Civil List payments to the Queen.

In 2012, the Civil List was replaced by the Sovereign Grant, through the Sovereign Grant Act 2011.

<text>East Asian Madhyamaka is the Buddhist tradition in East Asia which represents the Indian Madhyamaka (&quot;Chung-kuan&quot;) system of thought. In Chinese Buddhism, these are often referred to as the &quot;Sānlùn&quot; (Ch. 三論宗, Jp. &quot;Sanron&quot;, &quot;Three Treatise&quot;) school, also known as the &quot;emptiness school&quot; (&quot;K&#x27;ung Tsung&quot;), although they may not have been an independent sect. The three principal texts of the school are &quot;the Middle Treatise&quot; (&quot;Zhong lun&quot;), &quot;the Twelve Gate Treatise&quot; (&quot;Shiermen lun&quot;), and &quot;the Hundred Treatise&quot; (&quot;Bai lun&quot;). They were first transmitted to China during the early 5th century by the Buddhist monk Kumārajīva (344−413) in the Eastern Jin Dynasty. The school and its texts were later transmitted to Korea and Japan. The leading thinkers of this tradition are Kumārajīva&#x27;s disciple Sēngzhào (Seng-chao; 374−414), and the later Jízàng (Chi-tsang; 549−623). Their major doctrines include emptiness (&quot;k&#x27;ung&quot;), the middle way (&quot;chung-tao&quot;), the twofold truth (&quot;erh-t&#x27;i&quot;) and &quot;the refutation of erroneous views as the illumination of right views&quot; (&quot;p&#x27;o-hsieh-hsien-cheng&quot;). 

==History in China==

===Early period===

The name &quot;Sānlùn&quot; derives from the fact that its doctrinal basis is formed by three principal Madhyamaka texts composed by the Indian Buddhist philosophers Nāgārjuna (&quot;Longshu&quot;, 龍樹), and Āryadeva, which were then translated into Chinese by the Kuchean monk Kumārajīva (pinyin: &quot;Jiūmóluóshí&quot;) and his team of Chinese translators in Chang&#x27;an&#x27;s Xiaoyao garden. 

These three foundational texts are:

* &quot;The Middle Treatise&quot; (Ch. 中論, pinyin: Zhonglun, T. 1564; Skt. Madhyamakaśāstra), comprising Nāgārjuna&#x27;s &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot; (&quot;Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way&quot;) alongside a commentary by *Vimalākṣa / *Piṅgala (Ch. 青目, pinyin: Qingmu).

* &quot;The Treatise on the Twelve Gates&quot; (Ch. 十二門論, pinyin: Shiermenlun, T. 1568), allegedly Nāgārjuna&#x27;s *&quot;Dvādaśadvāraśāstra&quot;, also reconstructed as *&quot;Dvādaśamukhaśāstra&quot; or as *&quot;Dvādaśanikāyaśāstra.&quot;

* &quot;The Hundred(-Verse) Treatise&quot; (Ch. 百論, pinyin: Bailun, T. 1569; Skt. &quot;Śatakaśāstra&quot;, or &quot;Śataśāstra&quot;), consisting of a commentary by a certain master Vasu on some verses by Āryadeva.

Sometimes a fourth text is added, changing the collection&#x27;s title to the &quot;Four Treatises&quot; (Ch. 四論, pinyin: Silun):

* &quot;Commentary on the Great Perfection of Wisdom&quot; (Ch. 大智度論, pinyin: Dazhidulun, T. 1509; Skt. &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitopadeśa&quot;). Attributed to Nāgārjuna, but disputed by some modern scholars.

Another text translated by Kumārajīva and his team, the Satyasiddhi shastra (&quot;Ch&#x27;eng-shih lun&quot;), while not being a Madhyamaka text per se, was influential in the study of Chinese Madhyamaka, since it also taught the emptiness of dharmas.

Sengrui was one of Kumārajīva&#x27;s main disciples--he aided in the translation project of numerous texts, including the Middle Treatise and the &quot;Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot;. Six days after Kumārajīva arrived in Chang&#x27;an, Sengrui requested that he translate a meditation manual now understood to be the &quot;Zuochan sanmei jing&quot; (&quot;Sutra of sitting dhyāna samādhi,&quot; Taisho 15 no. 614). Sengrui refers to this manual as &quot;Chanyao&quot; 禪要 in the preface he wrote for it: the &quot;Guanzhong-chu chanjing xu&quot; (&quot;Preface to the Meditation Manual Translated in the Guanzhong Area&quot;, T. 55: 65 a–b) (dates uncertain)&quot;.&quot;

Another of Kumārajīva&#x27;s main disciples, Sēngzhào continued to promote Madhyamaka teachings, and wrote several works from this standpoint, his main one being the &quot;Zhao Lun&quot;. Two of the essays in this work (&quot;Prajña Is Without Dichotomizing Knowledge&quot; and &quot;Nirvana Is Without Conceptualization&quot;) follow a similar debate format to Nagarjuna&#x27;s MMK. Sēngzhào is often seen as the founder of the &quot;Sānlùn&quot; school proper&quot;.&quot; His philosophy drew from various sources, including the three treatises, Mahayana sutras such as the Vimalakirti sutra, as well as Taoist works such as Lao-tzu, Chuang-tzu and Neo-Daoist &quot;Mystery Learning&quot; (&quot;xuanxue&quot; 玄学) texts. His use of Taoist influenced paradoxes made him a favorite in the Chan school who considers him a patriarch.

Sēngzhào saw the central problem in understanding emptiness as the discriminatory activity of &quot;prapañca.&quot; According to Sēngzhào, delusion arises through a dependent relationship between phenomenal things, naming, thought and reification and correct understanding lies outside of words and concepts. Thus, while emptiness is the lack of intrinsic self in all things, this emptiness is not itself an absolute and cannot be grasped by the conceptual mind, it can be only be realized through non-conceptual wisdom (&quot;prajña&quot;).

=== Tang era and Jízàng ===

An important &quot;Sānlùn&quot; figure during the Tang dynasty was Fa-lang (507–581). He studied widely under various teachers, including the Madhyamaka master Seng-chuan (470–528) and eventually received an imperial decree to reside at Hsing Huang monastery in Ch&#x27;ien-k&#x27;ang, where he continued to give sermons on the Four Treatises for twenty five years. 

The most influential &quot;Sānlùn&quot; scholar of the Tang was Fa-lang&#x27;s pupil Jízàng (549–623), a prolific writer who composed commentaries on these three treatises. One of his most famous works is the &quot;Erdi Yi&quot; (二諦意), or &quot;Meaning of the Two Truths&quot;, referring to the conventional and ultimate truths. In one passage of the &quot;Erdi Yi&quot;, Jizang cites Falang, and argues that the four treatises have the same goal, &quot;to explain the two truths and manifest the doctrine of non-duality&quot;.

Jízàng criticized numerous Chinese Buddhists for their unwarranted metaphysical assumptions. He ultimately rejects all metaphysical assertions of being and non-being as dogmatic conceptual confusions. Thus according to Hsueh-Lu Cheng, for Jízàng:True wisdom (prajña) is the abandonment of all views. Chi-tsang argues that metaphysical speculation of Being and Nothingness is a disease (ping). It is the root of all erroneous or perverted views. The cure of the disease lies not so much in developing a new metaphysical theory as in understanding the proper nature and function of human conceptualization and language. Chi-tsang, following Nagarjuna, claims that the very language men create and use plays a trick on them and destroys their &quot;eyes of wisdom.&quot; Enlightened men should discard conceptualization so as to avoid being taken in by this trick. Emptiness, for Chi-tsang, is a medicine (yao) for curing the &quot;philosophical disease&quot;.Jízàng called his philosophical method &quot;deconstructing what is misleading and revealing what is corrective&quot;. He insisted that one must never settle on any particular viewpoint or perspective but constantly reexamine one&#x27;s formulations to avoid rectification of thought and behavior. 

In addition to popularizing Madhyamaka, Jízàng also wrote commentaries on the Mahāyāna sūtras such as the &quot;Lotus Sūtra,&quot; the &quot;Vimalakīrti Nirdeśa Sūtra&quot; and &quot;Tathāgatagarbha&quot; teachings. 

=== Influence on Chan ===
After Jízàng, the school declined considerably, though its texts remained influential for other traditions such as Tiantai and Chan Buddhism. In, Chan (Zen), Nagarjuna is seen as one of the patriarchs of the school and thus its key figures such as Huineng must have been familiar with the four treatises. According to Hsueh-li Cheng, &quot;Zen masters such as Niu-t&#x27;ou fa-yung (594–657) and Nan-ch&#x27;uan P&#x27;u-yuan (748–834) were San-Iun Buddhists before they became Zen masters.&quot; Furthermore, major &quot;Sānlùn&quot; tenets such as the negation of conceptualization, the rejection of all views, and the twofold truth were adopted by Zen, thus Hsueh-li Cheng concludes that &quot;in many respects Zen appears to be a practical application of Madhyamika thought.&quot; 

===Modern Chinese Buddhism===

In the early part of the 20th century, the laymen Yang Wenhui and Ouyang Jian (Ch. ) (1871–1943) promoted Buddhist learning in China, and the general trend was for an increase in studies of Buddhist traditions such as Yogācāra, Madhyamaka, and the Huayan school.

A major influential figure in the modern Chinese study of Madhyamaka is Yìnshùn (印順導師, 1906–2005)&quot;.&quot; Yìnshùn applied his study of the Chinese Agamas to Madhyamaka, and argued that the works of Nagarjuna were &quot;the inheritance of the conceptualisation of dependent arising as proposed in the Agamas&quot;. Yìnshùn saw the writings of Nagarjuna as the correct Buddhadharma while considering the writings of the &quot;Sānlùn&quot; school as being corrupted due to their synthesizing of the &quot;Tathagata-garbha&quot; doctrine into Madhyamaka. 

While he was seen among his colleagues as a &quot;Sānlùn&quot; scholar, he himself did not claim such direct affiliation:Many modern Chinese Mādhyamaka scholars such as Li Zhifu, Yang Huinan and Lan Jifu have been students of Yìnshùn.

==History in Japan==
The school was known in Japan as Sanron (三論宗) and was introduced around 625 by the Korean Goguryeo monk Hyegwan (Jp. = Ekan 慧灌) who resided at Gangōji Temple. Prince Shōtoku is known to have had two Buddhist mentors from the Sanron school. Ekan is also known for introducing the Jōjitsu (Satyasiddhi) school to Japan and the Satyasiddhi system was taught as a supplement, together with Madhyamaka, in Japanese Sanron.

During the Heian period, an important Sanron figure was master Chiko (709–781), whose commentary on the Heart Sutra became a classic work of Heian Buddhist scholarship and the most authoritative commentary on the Heart Sutra in the early Heian. This commentary criticized the Hosso (Yogacara) school&#x27;s interpretation of the Heart Sutra, promoted the Heart Sutra as a text of definitive meaning (nītārtha) while also drawing on the work of Jizang.

This school was later overshadowed by other Japanese schools such as Tendai and Zen.

<text>The Jebel Akhdar Mountains () is a mountain range approximately long and wide, that is part of the Hajar Mountains in Ad Dakhiliyah Governorate of Oman. 

It rises to a height of and encompasses the Saiq Plateau at above sea level. 

Jebel Akhdar Mountains is famous for its labyrinth of wadis (river valleys) and terraced orchards, where pomegranates, apricots, and roses grow in abundance due to its mild Mediterranean climate.
The highest peak in the Jebel Akhdar Mountains is Jebel Shams, which with its elevation of is also the highest peak in the Hajar range and in Oman.

Jebel Shams also has a second summit (the South Summit), which is publicly accessible for trekking via the W4 Trail. The elevation of the second south summit is .

==Geology and geography==
This mostly limestone mountain is one of the highest points in Oman and eastern Arabia. Jebel Akhdar lies at the central section of the Hajar range, located around from Muscat and accessible only by four-wheel drive. The range is mostly desert, but at higher altitudes receives around of precipitation annually — moist enough to allow the growth of shrubs and trees and support agriculture. It is this that gives the mountains their &quot;green&quot; name.

An old stronghold on the inland side of the mountain is Birkat al-Mawz, or Pool of the Plantains, with a layout similar to the nearby Jabrin palace.
The area is about a 45-minute drive from Nizwa and is known for its traditional rose water extraction and agricultural products including pomegranates, walnuts, apricots, black grapes, and peaches. It is also the site of honey bee breeding for much of Oman. Agricultural production is improved by the use of Falaj irrigation channels and their associated terraces system devised by the local farmers, who have lived on this mountain for hundreds of years. Al Sogara is a historic village carved into the mountainside. The Jebel is mostly inhabited by the ancient Arab tribe Bani Riyam (al Riyamy). Most descendants of the tribe are now in the four nearby villages, including Nizwa, Izki and Ibra.

==Ecology==
Jebel Akhdar Mountains is in Al Hajar montane woodlands ecoregion. The plant communities on the mountain vary with elevation. Shrublands and dry grasslands are found from 450 to 1,300 meters elevation. The grasses and shrubs are adapted to arid conditions, and include many drought-deciduous and succulent plants. Typical shrubs include &quot;Convolvulus acanthocladus, Euphorbia larica, Grewia tenax&quot; subsp. &quot;makranica, Jaubertia aucheri, Maerua crassifolia, Moringa peregrina&quot;, and &quot;Pseudogaillonia hymenostephana&quot;.

Semi-evergreen woodlands of sclerophyllous trees are found between 1,350 and 2,350 meters elevation. Common trees and shrubs include &quot;Sideroxylon mascatense, Dodonaea viscosa&quot;, Olive (&quot;Olea europaea&quot;), &quot;Ebenus stellatus, Grewia villosa, Juniperus seravschanica, Myrtus communis&quot;, and &quot;Sageretia spiciflora&quot;.

Above 2300 meters elevation, open woodlands of juniper (&quot;Juniperus seravschanica&quot;) predominate, with the shrubs &quot;Cotoneaster nummularius, Daphne mucronata, Ephedra pachyclada, Euryops arabicus, Lonicera aucheri, Periploca aphylla&quot;, and &quot;Sageretia spiciflora&quot;.

==Farming==
The mountain is a traditional farming area, with mountain springs providing sufficient for irrigation needs. However, climate change has reduced annual rainfall and increased nighttime temperatures.

==History==
Between 1954 and 1959, the area became a site of the Jebel Akhdar War, a conflict between Omani forces loyal to the sultan of Oman (aided by British soldiers, including the Special Air Service) and Saudi Arabian-backed rebel forces of the inland Imamate of Oman.

In August 2011, Sultan Qaboos designated Jebel Akhdar a nature reserve in a bid to conserve its unique yet fragile biodiversity. A decree issued by Sultan Qaboos established the &#x27;Jebel Akhdar Sanctuary for Natural Sceneries&#x27;. The Minister of Environment and Climate Affairs has authority to draft guidelines regulating access and developmental activity within the reserve.

Since 2011, the mountain has featured as the principal climb in the Tour of Oman road bicycle race. In the area, several important rock art sites, with figures dating back to 6,000 years ago, have been discovered and studied.

<doc id="576831" wikidata="Q233453" url="?curid=576831" title="Hiromi Uehara">
<text>, known professionally as Hiromi, is a Japanese jazz composer and pianist. She is known for her virtuosic technique, energetic live performances and blending of musical genres such as stride, post-bop, progressive rock, classical, nu jazz and fusion in her compositions. In 2021 she performed at the opening ceremony of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

== Biography ==
Uehara was born in Hamamatsu, Japan. She started learning piano at the age of six and was introduced to jazz by her piano teacher Noriko Hikida when she was eight. At age 14, she played with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra. When she was 17 years old, she met Chick Corea by chance in Tokyo and was invited to play with him at his concert the next day. 

=== Early Career ===
After being a jingle writer for a few years for Japanese companies such as Nissan, she enrolled to study at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. There, she was mentored by Ahmad Jamal and had already signed with jazz label Telarc before her graduation.

=== The Trio Project ===
Uehara&#x27;s Trio Project brought together Anthony Jackson, who was previously a guest on the &quot;Brain&quot; album, and drummer Simon Phillips. The group made four albums together: &quot;Voice&quot; (2011), &quot;Move&quot; (2012), &quot;Alive&quot; (2014), and &quot;Spark&quot; (2016). &quot;Move&quot; and &quot;Alive&quot; both charted inside the top 10 on the U.S. Billboard Jazz Album charts, while &quot;Spark&quot; reached the number one position.

== Instruments ==
In a 2010 interview, Uehara said she plays the Yamaha CFIII-S concert grand piano, Nord Lead 2, Clavia Nord Electro 2 73, Clavia Nord Stage Piano, and Korg microKORG.

<text>The consultative status is a phrase that has been in use since the establishment of the United Nations and is used within the UN community to refer to &quot;Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council&quot; (see list). Also some international organizations could grant Consultative Status to NGOs (for example - Council of Europe). Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) could grant Consultative Status in the form of &quot;Researcher-in-residence programme&quot; (run by the Prague Office of the OSCE Secretariat): accredited representatives of national and international NGOs are granted access to all records and to numerous topical compilations related to OSCE field activities.

Consultative Status has its foundation in Article 71 of Chapter 10 of the United Nations Charter:

:&quot;The Economic and Social Council may make suitable arrangements for consultation with non-governmental organizations which are concerned with matters within its competence. Such arrangements may be made with international organizations and, where appropriate, with national organizations after consultation with the Member of the United Nations concerned.&quot;

===1296 (XLIV)===

ECOSOC Resolution 1296 (XLIV) in 1968 had defined the criteria and rights associated with Consultative Status for almost forty years, during which time there was a substantial growth in the number of NGOs.

The primary impetus for the 1996 revision of the arrangements was the unprecedented level of NGO participation, especially from national NGOs, in the preparations for UNCED - the 1992 Earth Summit. The use of ICT - mostly in the form of electronic conferences on the Institute for Global Communications network, and electronic mail - had played a major role.]

=== 1993 ===
The rules for Consultative Status for international non-governmental organizations are appended to the resolution (93)38 &quot;On relations between the Council of Europe and international non-governmental organisations&quot;, adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on 18 October 1993 at the 500th meeting of the Ministers&#x27; Deputies.

===1996/31===

The criteria for NGO accreditation to Consultative Status have been revised several times, most recently in 1996 in ECOSOC Resolution 1996/31, following an extensive United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on the Review of Arrangements for Consultation with Non-Government Organizations.

A significant section of 1996/31 was the following paragraph:

:&quot;69. The Secretary-General is requested to make every effort to enhance and streamline as appropriate Secretariat support arrangements, and to improve practical arrangements on such matters as greater use of modern information and communication technology, the establishment of an integrated database of non-governmental organizations, wide and timely dissemination of information on meetings, distribution of documentation, provision of access and transparent, simple and streamlined procedures for the attendance of non-governmental organizations in United Nations meetings, and to facilitate their broad-based participation.&quot;

== Statistics ==
In 1948, shortly after the founding of the United Nations, there were 45 NGOs in Consultative Status, mostly large international organizations. Currently there are 3900 NGOs in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), and some 400 NGOs accredited to the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD).

==Categories of Consultative Status==

There are three classes of Consultative Status defined by 1996/31, General, Special, and Roster. These classes were the equivalent of Category I, Category II, and Roster status that were defined in 1296 (XLIV). Below are the current definitions - paragraph numbers are from 1996/31.

1996/31 grants different rights for participation in ECOSOC and its subsidiary bodies - principally ECOSOC&#x27;s Functional Commissions - including rights to United Nations passes, to speak at designated meetings, and to have documents translated and circulated as official UN document; e.g. Information Technology, Public Participation, and Global Agreements submitted to the Commission on Social Development in 1998.

===General===

:&quot;22. Organizations that are concerned with most of the activities of the Council and its subsidiary bodies and can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Council that they have substantive and sustained contributions to make to the achievement of the objectives of the United Nations in fields set out in paragraph 1 above, and are closely involved with the economic and social life of the peoples of the areas they represent and whose membership, which should be considerable, is broadly representative of major segments of society in a large number of countries in different regions of the world shall be known as organizations in general consultative status.&quot;

===Special===

:&quot;23. Organisations that have a special competence in, and are concerned specifically with, only a few of the fields of activity covered by the Council and its subsidiary bodies, and that are known within the fields for which they have or seek consultative status shall be known as organizations in special consultative status.&quot;

===Roster===

:&quot;24. Other organizations that do not have general or special consultative status but that the Council, or the Secretary-General of the United Nations in consultation with the Council or its Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations, considers can make occasional and useful contributions to the work of the Council or its subsidiary bodies or other United Nations bodies within their competence shall be included in a list (to be known as the Roster). This list may also include organizations in consultative status or a similar relationship with a specialized agency or a United Nations body. These organizations shall be available for consultation at the request of the Council or its subsidiary bodies. The fact that an organization is on the Roster shall not in itself be regarded as a qualification for general or special consultative status should an organization seek such status.&quot;

The three sub-categories of Roster Status - see below - have been supplemented by a fourth category, the definition of whose rights remains somewhat vague, namely &quot;NGOs accredited to the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD)&quot;:

====ECOSOC Roster====

The primary form of Roster Status, for NGOs with a focus on one or two of the areas of competence of ECOSOC.

====Secretary-General&#x27;s Roster====

There are special provisions in 1996/31, and before that in 1296 (XLIV) for the UN Secretary-General to recommend NGOs for the Roster.

====Agency Roster====

The Agency Roster refers to accreditation to the Roster of United Nations specialized agencies such - e.g. UNICEF, UNESCO, ILO, ITU, etc.

====CSD Roster====

Although not defined in 1996/31, a fourth category of NGOs accredited to the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) was established by ECOSOC decision 1996/302. There are currently approximately 400 NGOs in this status.

==Application procedure==
An NGO that wishes to obtain consultative status with the ECOSOC must first submit an application online at the NGO Branch of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the UN Secretariat. After the application is screened by the NGO Branch, it will be reviewed by the ECOSOC Committee on NGOs. The Committee decides to recommend, or not recommend, granting status to the NGO. The final decision is taken by the ECOSOC at its annual Substantive session.

Although the review made by the NGO Committee is theoretically a technical one, it is sometimes quite politicised. Human rights NGOs that are critical of specific member states have sometimes had difficulties getting consultative status.

<text>Major-General Lord Charles Wellesley (16 January 1808 – 9 October 1858) was an Anglo-Irish soldier, Conservative politician, and courtier from the aristocratic Wellesley family. He was the younger son of Prime Minister Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.

==Early life and education==
Lord Charles was born at the Chief Secretary&#x27;s Lodge, Phoenix Park, Dublin, the second of two sons of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington and Catherine Pakenham Wellesley, Duchess of Wellington.

He was educated at Eton College, and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford in 1824, aged 16. He was rusticated by the Dean of Christ Church, Samuel Smith, transferring in 1826 to Trinity College, Cambridge.

==Career==
Lord Charles entered the British Army in January 1824 at age 16. He accompanied his regiment, the 15th Regiment of Foot, to Canada during the Rebellions of 1837–1838. He returned in 1840 with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He retired from the army in 1845.

He was appointed Chief Equerry and Clerk Marshal to Queen Victoria in 1841 and held the post until 1846.

He represented the Conservative Party as the Member of Parliament (MP) for South Hampshire from 1842 to 1852, and the MP for Windsor from 1852 to 1855. As a politician, Lord Charles was a liberal conservative who voted for free trade and supported Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel&#x27;s progressive policies.

He left Parliament in February 1855 due to loss of sight.

==Marriage and issue==

Lord Charles married Augusta Sophia Anne Pierrepont, daughter of The Hon. Henry Pierrepont, on 9 July 1844. They had six children:

* Arthur Wellesley (5 May 1845 – 7 July 1846)
* Major Henry Wellesley, 3rd Duke of Wellington (5 April 1846 – 8 June 1900)
* Lady Victoria Alexandrina Wellesley (2 April 1847 – 31 July 1933), named for her godmother Queen Victoria; married in 1877 Ion Hamilton, 1st Baron HolmPatrick
* Colonel Arthur Charles Wellesley, 4th Duke of Wellington (15 March 1849 – 18 June 1934), married in 1872 Kathleen Bulkeley Williams
* Lady Mary Angela Wellesley (21 October 1850 – 26 April 1936), married in 1875 George Arthur Jervoise Scott, son of James Winter Scott 
* Georgina Wellesley (15 May 1853 – 3 February 1880), married banker William Rolle Malcolm; mother of Sir Dougal Orme Malcolm (1877–1955)

After several months of declining health, Lord Charles died on 9 October 1858 at Conholt Park, Wiltshire.

When his older brother, Arthur, died in 1884 with no heirs, Lord Charles&#x27;s eldest surviving son, Henry, inherited his uncle&#x27;s dukedom as Duke of Wellington. His other surviving children were raised to the rank and precedence of children of a duke in November 1884.

When Henry also died childless in 1900, the peerage passed to Lord Charles&#x27; third son Arthur Wellesley, Henry&#x27;s brother.

<doc id="576842" wikidata="Q3443980" url="?curid=576842" title="Fernando Consag">
<text>Fernando Consag, known in his native Croatian as Ferdinand Konščak (December 2, 1703 – September 10, 1759), was a Croatian Jesuit missionary, explorer and cartographer, who spent most of his life in Mexico, in Baja California.

==Education==
Consag was born in Varaždin, Croatia, and attended primary and secondary school in his native city. At sixteen he finished the expected grades and was admitted to the novitiate of the Society of Jesus in Trencsén, Hungary (now Trenčín, Slovakia), where he stayed for two years. He was then sent to Leoben in Styria to study classics, stylistics, and rhetoric. Later he studied philosophy in Graz, Austria and in 1725–1726 he lectured on the elements of grammar at the Jesuit Academy in Zagreb in Croatia. In 1726–1727 he taught classical studies at a secondary school in Buda in Hungary. In 1728 Consag published a collection of poems titled &quot;Nagadia versibus latinus&quot;, which is kept at Budapest. From 1727 to 1729 he studied theology at the University of Graz.

==Missionary==
In 1729, Consag left for Cádiz in Spain, then went to North America, where he was active as a missionary on New Spain&#x27;s Baja California Peninsula (today part of Mexico), from 1732 to the end of his life. His headquarters was at Mission San Ignacio. From 1748 he acted as the superior of the mission and later, in 1758, inspector of all missions in Baja California. Consag spoke various dialects of the local Cochimí language. He directed and oversaw the building of new missions, aqueducts, embankments, drainage channels, and the first silver mines. He died at San Ignacio in 1759.

==Expeditions==
Consag mounted three expeditions (in 1746, 1751 and 1753) systematically exploring previously unknown parts of the peninsula.

In June and July 1746 he was sent by sea to the head of the Gulf of California in order to investigate the disputed question of whether Baja California was an island. Although he closely followed the coast and reached the Colorado River, the issue continued to be in dispute for nearly another three decades

His second expedition comprised a journey by land across the peninsula to the Pacific coast. The third expedition went up the western side of the peninsula, to around 30 degrees of latitude near Bahía San Luis Gonzaga.

During his expeditions, Consag recorded information on the peninsula&#x27;s unknown topography, natural resources, and native inhabitants.
==Maps and writings==
On the basis of the data obtained, Consag made a precise map of Baja California (1748) and a map of the Gulf of California (around 1750).

His maps of the regions explored were popular at the time frequently copied and used. Denis Diderot and D&#x27;Alembert used some of them within the French encyclopedia, where his name is cited as &quot;P. Consaqua&quot;. Alexander von Humboldt used the maps in his work &quot;Carte generale ... de la Nouvelle Espagne&quot;, (Paris, 1804). The same is the case with Arrowsmith in his book &quot;Map of America&quot;, published in London in 1805.

His diaries, after his death translated and reprinted into many languages, were published during his lifetime by Villa-Señor y Sanchez, Ortega-Balthasar, and Venegas-Buriel.

The 1761 copy of his manuscript on California is held in the British Museum. His &quot;Carta del P. Fernando Consag de la Compañia de Jesus, Visitador de las Misiones de Californias&quot; are kept at:

* British Museum in London
* Library of Congress in Washington
* John Carter Library in Providence, Rhode Island 
* Honnold-Mudd Library of the Claremont Colleges in Claremont, California 
* The Huntington Library in San Marino, California

Seven copies of maps are published by Ernest J. Burrus.

Consag&#x27;s name has also been associated with two anonymous accounts of Baja California: &quot;Descripción compendiosa de lo descubierto y conocido de la California&quot; and &quot;Adiciones&quot; to the same. Homer Aschmann in 1966 and Damir Zorić in 2000 suggested that Consag was the author of the second of these, while Miguel León-Portilla in 1988 suggested that he wrote the first.

==Legacy==

There is an outcrop in the northern Gulf of California named Roca Consag, located offshore near San Felipe. Consag mapped many water springs so that even today there are shops and other facilities in California bearing his name like &quot;Licores Konsag&quot;, (Liquor Store and Market), &quot;Konsaqua&quot; (purified water).

<text>George Spelvin, Georgette Spelvin, and Georgina Spelvin are traditional pseudonyms used in programs in American theater.

&quot;Georgina Spelvin&quot; has fallen out of general use since it was adopted as a screen name by pornographic actress Shelley Graham, who was credited by that name in &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot; (1973) and her subsequent films.

==History==
According to a 1910 &quot;New York Sun&quot; article, actor-manager William Gillette created the pseudonym for an actor doubling in a second role in his 1908 play &quot;Ticey&quot; (aka &quot;That Little Affair of Boyd&#x27;s&quot;). The actor was afraid that his reputation would be damaged if his name appeared in the cast list for a bit part. Gillette apparently made up the name George Spelvin on the spot. However, the Encyclopedia Britannica notes without citation that the name is said to have first appeared on a cast list in 1886 in &quot;Karl the Peddler&quot;, a play by Charles A. Gardiner, and that it was used by a cast member of Winchell Smith&#x27;s &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot; in 1906. According to a 1916 New York Times article, Winchell Smith insisted on having the pseudonym used in &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot; and later used it in other plays including &quot;Via Wireless&quot;.

==Reasons for use==
The reasons for the use of an alternate name vary. Actors who do not want to be credited, or whose names would otherwise appear twice because they are playing more than one role in a production, may adopt a pseudonym. Actors who are members of the trade unions (such as the Actors&#x27; Equity Association) but are working under a non-union contract for a given production may use pseudonyms to avoid fines or other penalties by their union.

In some plays, this name has appeared in cast lists as the name of an actor (or actress) portraying a character who is mentioned in the dialogue but never turns up onstage: with the role credited to &quot;George Spelvin&quot;, the audience is not forewarned that the character never makes an entrance. The 1927 musical play &quot;Strike Up the Band&quot; by George S. Kaufman and George and Ira Gershwin features a character named George Spelvin. The name can also be used when one actor is playing what appear to be two characters, but is later revealed as being one person with two names or identities. Because of the pseudonym, the audience is not clued-in that the two seemingly separate characters are meant to be the same person. This is especially useful in murder mysteries.

The name may also be used for a character who never delivers a line, and thus any member of the stage crew might be filling in the role. For example, a person makes a delivery to a character onstage: the doorbell rings, the delivery is made, and the delivery carrier disappears, with no words spoken.

==Examples==
The 1948–49 seasons of the old time radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, saw lead actor Wendell Holmes (who was playing Dr. Watson) credited as George Spelvin. This was supposedly done to avoid confusion between &quot;Spelvin&#x27;s&quot; actual surname and the surname of the show&#x27;s titular protagonist.

In Players de Noc&#x27;s production of &quot;The Full Monty&quot;, about a group of men who try their luck as male strippers, a member of the production&#x27;s orchestra, not wanting members of his church to find he was involved with such a risqué play, had his name credited as George Spelvin.

==Contrary examples==
The name has also been used as a character name on several occasions. The one-act play &quot;The Actor&#x27;s Nightmare&quot; by Christopher Durang features a main character named George Spelvin, and the January 27, 1942, episode of &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; (&quot;The Blizzard&quot;) features a visit by a stranger calling himself George Spelvin (played by Frank Nelson). The name was used in the &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; episode &quot;Don Juan is Shelved&quot;, in &quot;The Munsters&quot; episode &quot;The Sleeping Cutie&quot; as the real name of an actor, in the &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; episode &quot;Fangs A Lot, Mama&quot; as the author of a book called &quot;A Nun&#x27;s Life&quot;, and as the name of a character villain voiced by Peter Serafinowicz in the &quot;Tragical History&quot; episode of &quot;Archer&quot;.

The columnist Westbrook Pegler used this name in his writings; one of his books of collected columns is titled &quot;George Spelvin, American&quot;.

<doc id="576847" wikidata="Q1368195" url="?curid=576847" title="Second baseman">
<text>In baseball and softball, second baseman, abbreviated 2B, is a fielding position in the infield, between second and first base. The second baseman often possesses quick hands and feet, needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly, and must be able to make the pivot on a double play. In addition, second basemen are usually right-handed; only four left-handed throwing players have ever played second base in Major League Baseball since 1950. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the second baseman is assigned the number 4.

Good second basemen need to have very good range since they have to field balls closer to the first baseman who is often holding runners on, or moving towards the base to cover. On a batted ball to right field, the second baseman goes out towards the ball for the relay. Due to these requirements, second base is sometimes a primarily defensive position in the modern game, but there are hitting stars as well.

Second base is often referred to as the &quot;Keystone&quot;. This is due to its position on the infield at the top of the diamond, similar to the keystone block in architecture.

==Functions==

The second baseman catches line drives or pop flies hit near them, and fields ground balls hit near them and then throws the ball to a base to force out a runner. In this case, if the runner is to be forced out at second base then that base is covered by the shortstop.

With a runner on first base, on a ground ball to the shortstop or third baseman the second baseman will cover second base to force out the runner coming from first. Moreover, if there are fewer than two outs they will attempt to turn the double play: that is, they will receive the throw from the other player with their foot on second base (to force out the runner coming from first base), and in one motion pivot toward first base and throw the ball there (to force out the batter before they get there).

If a runner on first base attempts to steal second base, or if the pitcher attempts to pick off a runner already at second base, then either the second baseman or the shortstop will cover second base.

<text>Shelley Bob Graham (born March 1, 1936), known professionally as Georgina Spelvin, is an American former actress and pornographic performer, best known as the star of the classic 1973 pornographic film &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot;, released during the Golden Age of Porn (1969–1984).
==Life and career==

=== Early life ===
Spelvin was born in Houston, Texas, at 2:24 pm on March 1, 1936, as Shelley Bob Graham. Her father was a geophysicist, and the family moved frequently. She often took dancing lessons during childhood. She graduated from high school in 1954.

=== New York City ===
Graham began her professional career as dancer and later as a chorus girl in &quot;Pajama Game&quot;, and was featured in the Broadway productions of &quot;Cabaret&quot;, &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;. During that time, she changed the spelling of her name to &quot;Chele Graham&quot;, but kept the pronunciation the same. When performance offers dwindled, she worked in theater production as a choreographer, director, and lighting technician in a number of musicals, which led to the underground film scene.

=== Pornography ===
The stage name she adopted is a variation on George Spelvin, traditionally used as a pseudonym by stage actors for the second billing, when playing two roles.

She made her first movie, &quot;The Twilight Girls&quot;, a softcore lesbian film, in 1957, and appeared in a few sexploitation features during the late 1960s.

Graham moved into porn when her friend, actor Marc Stevens, introduced her to adult film director Gerard Damiano. She became one of the best-known figures in hardcore pornography for her starring role in &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot; in 1973.

In 1973, Robert Berkvist, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, commented that &quot;&#x27;Miss Jones&#x27; is as familiar in [the respectable and well-to-do New York suburb of] Scarsdale as she is on Broadway.&quot;

In 1974, she appeared in the low-budget exploitation film &quot;Girls For Rent&quot; (aka &quot;I Spit on Your Corpse)&quot;, for which she also served as costume designer.

In 1974, while living in Maine, she was charged with transporting obscene materials across state lines for her film &quot;Devil in Miss Jones&quot; in Tennessee. The charges were eventually dropped in 1977.

In 1975, she moved to El Cajon, California, with Claire Lumiere (aka Judith Hamilton), met Vince Miranda and appeared in &quot;Take It Off&quot; at his theatre, the Off-Broadway.

Spelvin appeared in more than 70 adult films, such as &quot;Desires Within Young Girls&quot; (1977), &quot;Sensual Encounters of Every Kind&quot; (1978), &quot;Honky Tonk Nights&quot; (1978), &quot;The Ecstasy Girls&quot; (1979), &quot;Ring of Desire&quot; (1981), and &quot;Center Spread Girls&quot; (1982), before retiring from the industry in 1982.

=== Later life ===
Spelvin made cameo appearances in &quot;Police Academy&quot; (1984) and &quot;Police Academy 3: Back in Training&quot; (1986). She later had film roles in &quot;Bad Blood&quot; (1989), in which she was credited as &quot;Ruth Raymond&quot;, &quot;Return to Justice&quot; (1990), and &quot;Next Year in Jerusalem&quot; (1997), as well as guest-starring roles on the television shows &quot;Dream On&quot; and &quot;The Lost World.&quot;

Spelvin learned desktop publishing and worked for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; until retiring from its staff in 2004.

In 2004, she made a cameo appearance in Vivid Video&#x27;s remake of &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot;, titled &quot;The New Devil in Miss Jones.&quot; Her role did not involve any sex acts. In 2005, she was interviewed for the documentary film &quot;Inside Deep Throat&quot;. In 2006, she was interviewed for the documentary film &quot;Devil in Miss Spelvin&quot;, a special feature intended for inclusion with &quot;Devil in Miss Jones: The Definitive Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;.

In 2009, she appeared as herself in the video for Massive Attack&#x27;s song &quot;Paradise Circus.&quot;

In 2011, Spelvin was a guest on an episode (season 1, episode 5) of the Showtime series &quot;Dave&#x27;s Old Porn&quot;, in which she viewed and discussed clips from a number of her films (including &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot;) with host Dave Attell and guest Adam Carolla. In 2017, Spelvin was interviewed in the documentary &quot;After Porn Ends 2&quot;, about her career in porn.

==Personal life==
Spelvin met her future husband, actor John Welsh, in 1983.

==Autobiography==
In May 2008, she published her autobiography, &quot;The Devil Made Me Do It&quot;, and appeared on camera in a short web clip announcing its release; a self-published work, the book is available through her official website.

<doc id="576855" wikidata="Q864155" url="?curid=576855" title="Binary decision diagram">
<text>In computer science, a binary decision diagram (BDD) or branching program is a data structure that is used to represent a Boolean function. On a more abstract level, BDDs can be considered as a compressed representation of sets or relations. Unlike other compressed representations, operations are performed directly on the compressed representation, i.e. without decompression.

Similar data structures include negation normal form (NNF), Zhegalkin polynomials, and propositional directed acyclic graphs (PDAG).

== Definition ==
A Boolean function can be represented as a rooted, directed, acyclic graph, which consists of several (decision) nodes and two terminal nodes. The two terminal nodes are labeled 0 (FALSE) and 1 (TRUE). Each (decision) node formula_1 is labeled by a Boolean variable formula_2 and has two child nodes called low child and high child. The edge from node formula_1 to a low (or high) child represents an assignment of the value FALSE (or TRUE, respectively) to variable formula_2. Such a BDD is called &#x27;ordered&#x27; if different variables appear in the same order on all paths from the root. A BDD is said to be &#x27;reduced&#x27; if the following two rules have been applied to its graph:
* Merge any isomorphic subgraphs.
* Eliminate any node whose two children are isomorphic.

In popular usage, the term BDD almost always refers to Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagram (ROBDD in the literature, used when the ordering and reduction aspects need to be emphasized). The advantage of an ROBDD is that it is canonical (unique up to isomorphism) for a particular function and variable order. This property makes it useful in functional equivalence checking and other operations like functional technology mapping.

A path from the root node to the 1-terminal represents a (possibly partial) variable assignment for which the represented Boolean function is true. As the path descends to a low (or high) child from a node, then that node&#x27;s variable is assigned to 0 (respectively 1).

=== Example ===
The left figure below shows a binary decision &quot;tree&quot; (the reduction rules are not applied), and a truth table, each representing the function formula_5. In the tree on the left, the value of the function can be determined for a given variable assignment by following a path down the graph to a terminal. In the figures below, dotted lines represent edges to a low child, while solid lines represent edges to a high child. Therefore, to find formula_6, begin at x1, traverse down the dotted line to x2 (since x1 has an assignment to 0), then down two solid lines (since x2 and x3 each have an assignment to one). This leads to the terminal 1, which is the value of formula_6.

The binary decision &quot;tree&quot; of the left figure can be transformed into a binary decision &quot;diagram&quot; by maximally reducing it according to the two reduction rules. The resulting BDD is shown in the right figure.

Another notation for writing this Boolean function is formula_8.

=== Complemented edges ===
An ROBDD can be represented even more compactly, using complemented edges, also known as &quot;complement links&quot;. The resulting BDD is sometimes known as a &quot;typed BDD&quot; or &quot;signed BDD&quot;.
Complemented edges are formed by annotating low edges as complemented or not. If an edge is complemented, then it refers to the negation of the Boolean function that corresponds to the node that the edge points to (the Boolean function represented by the BDD with root that node). High edges are not complemented, in order to ensure that the resulting BDD representation is a canonical form. In this representation, BDDs have a single leaf node, for reasons explained below.

Two advantages of using complemented edges when representing BDDs are:
* computing the negation of a BDD takes constant time
* space usage (i.e., required memory) is reduced (by a factor at most 2)
However, Knuth argues otherwise:
:&quot;Although such links are used by all the major BDD packages, they are hard to recommend because the computer programs become much more complicated. The memory saving is usually negligible, and never better than a factor of 2; furthermore, the author&#x27;s experiments show little gain in running time.&quot;

A reference to a BDD in this representation is a (possibly complemented) &quot;edge&quot; that points to the root of the BDD. This is in contrast to a reference to a BDD in the representation without use of complemented edges, which is the root node of the BDD. The reason why a reference in this representation needs to be an edge is that for each Boolean function, the function and its negation are represented by an edge to the root of a BDD, and a complemented edge to the root of the same BDD. This is why negation takes constant time. It also explains why a single leaf node suffices: FALSE is represented by a complemented edge that points to the leaf node, and TRUE is represented by an ordinary edge (i.e., not complemented) that points to the leaf node.

For example, assume that a Boolean function is represented with a BDD represented using complemented edges. To find the value of the Boolean function for a given assignment of (Boolean) values to the variables, we start at the reference edge, which points to the BDD&#x27;s root, and follow the path that is defined by the given variable values (following a low edge if the variable that labels a node equals FALSE, and following the high edge if the variable that labels a node equals TRUE), until we reach the leaf node. While following this path, we count how many complemented edges we have traversed. If when we reach the leaf node we have crossed an odd number of complemented edges, then the value of the Boolean function for the given variable assignment is FALSE, otherwise (if we have crossed an even number of complemented edges), then the value of the Boolean function for the given variable assignment is TRUE.

An example diagram of a BDD in this representation is shown on the right, and represents the same Boolean expression as shown in diagrams above, i.e., formula_9. Low edges are dashed, high edges solid, and complemented edges are signified by a circle at their source. The node with the @ symbol represents the reference to the BDD, i.e., the reference edge is the edge that starts from this node.

== History ==
The basic idea from which the data structure was created is the Shannon expansion. A switching function is split into two sub-functions (cofactors) by assigning one variable (cf. &quot;if-then-else normal form&quot;). If such a sub-function is considered as a sub-tree, it can be represented by a &quot;binary decision tree&quot;. Binary decision diagrams (BDDs) were introduced by C. Y. Lee, and further studied and made known by Sheldon B. Akers and Raymond T. Boute. Independently of these authors, a BDD under the name &quot;canonical bracket form&quot; was realized Yu. V. Mamrukov in a CAD for analysis of speed-independent circuits. The full potential for efficient algorithms based on the data structure was investigated by Randal Bryant at Carnegie Mellon University: his key extensions were to use a fixed variable ordering (for canonical representation) and shared sub-graphs (for compression). Applying these two concepts results in an efficient data structure and algorithms for the representation of sets and relations. By extending the sharing to several BDDs, i.e. one sub-graph is used by several BDDs, the data structure &quot;Shared Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagram&quot; is defined. The notion of a BDD is now generally used to refer to that particular data structure.

In his video lecture &quot;Fun With Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs)&quot;, Donald Knuth calls BDDs &quot;one of the only really fundamental data structures that came out in the last twenty-five years&quot; and mentions that Bryant&#x27;s 1986 paper was for some time one of the most-cited papers in computer science.

Adnan Darwiche and his collaborators have shown that BDDs are one of several normal forms for Boolean functions, each induced by a different combination of requirements. Another important normal form identified by Darwiche is decomposable negation normal form or DNNF.

== Applications ==
BDDs are extensively used in CAD software to synthesize circuits (logic synthesis) and in formal verification. There are several lesser known applications of BDD, including fault tree analysis, Bayesian reasoning, product configuration, and private information retrieval.

Every arbitrary BDD (even if it is not reduced or ordered) can be directly implemented in hardware by replacing each node with a 2 to 1 multiplexer; each multiplexer can be directly implemented by a 4-LUT in a FPGA. It is not so simple to convert from an arbitrary network of logic gates to a BDD (unlike the and-inverter graph).

BDDs have been applied in efficient Datalog interpreters.

== Variable ordering ==
The size of the BDD is determined both by the function being represented and by the chosen ordering of the variables. There exist Boolean functions formula_10 for which depending upon the ordering of the variables we would end up getting a graph whose number of nodes would be linear (in &quot;n&quot;) at best and exponential at worst (e.g., a ripple carry adder). Consider the Boolean function formula_11 Using the variable ordering formula_12, the BDD needs formula_13 nodes to represent the function. Using the ordering formula_14, the BDD consists of formula_15 nodes.

It is of crucial importance to care about variable ordering when applying this data structure in practice. The problem of finding the best variable ordering is NP-hard. For any constant &quot;c&quot; &gt; 1 it is even NP-hard to compute a variable ordering resulting in an OBDD with a size that is at most &quot;c&quot; times larger than an optimal one. However, there exist efficient heuristics to tackle the problem.

There are functions for which the graph size is always exponential—independent of variable ordering. This holds e.g. for the multiplication function. In fact, the function computing the middle bit of the product of two formula_16-bit numbers does not have an OBDD smaller than formula_17 vertices. (If the multiplication function had polynomial-size OBDDs, it would show that integer factorization is in P/poly, which is not known to be true.)

Researchers have suggested refinements on the BDD data structure giving way to a number of related graphs, such as BMD (binary moment diagrams), ZDD (zero-suppressed decision diagrams), FBDD (free binary decision diagrams), FDD (functional decision diagrams), PDD (parity decision diagrams), and MTBDDs (multiple terminal BDDs).

== Logical operations on BDDs ==
Many logical operations on BDDs can be implemented by polynomial-time graph manipulation algorithms:
* conjunction
* disjunction
* negation

However, repeating these operations several times, for example forming the conjunction or disjunction of a set of BDDs, may in the worst case result in an exponentially big BDD. This is because any of the preceding operations for two BDDs may result in a BDD with a size proportional to the product of the BDDs&#x27; sizes, and consequently for several BDDs the size may be exponential in the number of operations. Variable ordering needs to be considered afresh; what may be a good ordering for (some of) the set of BDDs may not be a good ordering for the result of the operation. Also, since constructing the BDD of a Boolean function solves the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem and the co-NP-complete tautology problem, constructing the BDD can take exponential time in the size of the Boolean formula even when the resulting BDD is small.

Computing existential abstraction over multiple variables of reduced BDDs is NP-complete.

Model-counting, counting the number of satisfying assignments of a Boolean formula, can be done in polynomial time for BDDs. For general propositional formulas the problem is ♯P-complete and the best known algorithms require an exponential time in the worst case.

<doc id="576856" wikidata="Q56184" url="?curid=576856" title="Chanco">
<text>Chanco () is a name traditionally assigned to a Native American who is said to have warned a Jamestown colonist, Richard Pace, about an impending Powhatan attack in 1622. This article discusses how the Native American came to be known as Chanco.

== Unnamed Indian ==
The Native American&#x27;s warning to Richard Pace is described in the London Company&#x27;s official account of the 1622 attack, but the Native American is not named. He is described only as a converted Native American &quot;belonging to one Perry&quot;:

The account later makes reference to other Native Americans who warned settlers of the impending attack:
None of the Native Americans who gave warnings are named.

==Chauco==
A Native American named Chauco is mentioned in a letter from the Council in Virginia to the Virginia Company of London, dated April 4, 1623:

==&quot;Chauco&quot; misread as &quot;Chancho&quot;==
In 1740, William Stith published his &quot;History of the first discovery and settlement of Virginia&quot;. According to a description of the book on the Library of Congress website, &quot;William Stith compiled this detailed factual history of Virginia by culling material from the Records of the Virginia Company, a manuscript archive that Jefferson later owned and used in his own work.&quot; The archive was subsequently acquired by the Library of Congress and is now available online 

Stith evidently read the letter in which Chauco&#x27;s peace mission is mentioned, and concluded that Chauco (misread by Stith as &quot;Chanco&quot;) was the same person as the Native American who warned Richard Pace. This identification is explicitly made by Stith in the following passage:

Whether Stith&#x27;s identification was correct or mistaken, remains undetermined. In &quot;Pocahontas&#x27;s People&quot;, Helen C. Rountree argues that Chauco and the Pace&#x27;s Paines Native American have probably been wrongly conflated.

Whatever the truth, the name &quot;Chanco&quot; has by now been firmly established in folklore as the name of &quot;the Native American who saved Jamestown,&quot; and seems unlikely ever to be dislodged.

== Appearance in modern culture ==
Chanco on the James (formerly Camp Chanco) is an outdoor events facility and summer camp in Surry County, Virginia owned and operated by the Episcopal Diocese of Southern Virginia.

<doc id="576862" wikidata="Q1650350" url="?curid=576862" title="Prospecting">
<text>Prospecting is the first stage of the geological analysis (followed by exploration) of a territory. It is the search for minerals, fossils, precious metals, or mineral specimens. It is also known as fossicking.

Traditionally prospecting relied on direct observation of mineralization in rock outcrops or in sediments. Modern prospecting also includes the use of geologic, geophysical, and geochemical tools to search for anomalies which can narrow the search area. Once an anomaly has been identified and interpreted to be a potential prospect direct observation can then be focused on this area.

In some areas a prospector must also stake a claim, meaning they must erect posts with the appropriate placards on all four corners of a desired land they wish to prospect and register this claim before they may take samples. In other areas publicly held lands are open to prospecting without staking a mining claim.

== Historical methods ==

The traditional methods of prospecting involved combing through the countryside, often through creek beds and along ridgelines and hilltops, often on hands and knees looking for signs of mineralization in the outcrop. In the case of gold, all streams in an area would be panned at the appropriate trap sites looking for a show of &#x27;colour&#x27; or gold in the river trail.

Once a small occurrence or &quot;show&quot; was found, it was then necessary to intensively work the area with pick and shovel, and often via the addition of some simple machinery such as a sluice box, races and winnows, to work the loose soil and rock looking for the appropriate materials (in this case, gold). For most base metal shows, the rock would have been mined by hand and crushed on site, the ore separated from the gangue by hand.

These shows were commonly short-lived, exhausted and abandoned quite soon, requiring the prospector to move onwards to the next and hopefully bigger and better show. Occasionally, the prospector would strike it rich and be joined by other prospectors to develop a larger-scale mining operation. Although these are thought of as &quot;old&quot; prospecting methods, these techniques are still used today, but usually coupled with more advanced techniques such as geophysical magnetic or gravity surveys.

In most countries in the 19th and early 20th century, it was very unlikely that a prospector would retire rich even if he was the one who found the greatest of lodes. For instance Patrick (Paddy) Hannan, who discovered the Golden Mile, Kalgoorlie, died without receiving anywhere near a fraction of the value of the gold contained in the lodes. The same story repeated at Bendigo, Ballarat, Klondike and California.

== The gold rushes ==

In the United States and Canada, prospectors were lured by the promise of gold, silver, and other precious metals. They traveled across the mountains of the American West, carrying picks, shovels and gold pans. The majority of early prospectors had no training and relied mainly on luck to discover deposits.

Other gold rushes occurred in Papua New Guinea, Australia at least four times, Fiji, South Africa and South America. In all cases, the gold rush was sparked by idle prospecting for gold and minerals which, when the prospector was successful, generated &#x27;gold fever&#x27; and saw a wave of prospectors comb the countryside.

== Modern prospecting ==
Modern prospectors today rely on training, the study of geology, and prospecting technology.

Knowledge of previous prospecting in an area helps in determining location of new prospective areas. Prospecting includes geological mapping, rock assay analysis, and sometimes the intuition of the prospector.

Prospecting of minerals found in mobile fluids, as is often the case of lithium, adds a &quot;temporal element&quot; to be considered.

=== Metal detecting ===
Metal detectors are invaluable for gold prospectors, as they are quite effective at detecting gold nuggets within the soil down to around 1 metre (3 feet), depending on the acuity of the operator&#x27;s hearing and skill.

Magnetic separators may be useful in separating the magnetic fraction of a heavy mineral sand from the nonmagnetic fraction, which may assist in the panning or sieving of gold from the soil or stream.

=== Prospecting pickaxe ===
Prospecting pickaxes are used to scrape at rocks and minerals, obtaining small samples that can be tested for trace amounts of ore. Modern prospecting pickaxes are also sometimes equipped with magnets, to aid in the gathering of ferromagnetic ores. Prospecting pickaxes are usually equipped with a triangular head, with a very sharp point.

=== Electromagnetic prospecting ===

The introduction of modern gravity and magnetic surveying methods has greatly facilitated the prospecting process. Airborne gravimeters and magnetometers can collect data from vast areas and highlight anomalous geologic features. Three-dimensional inversions of audio-magnetotellurics (AMT) is used to find conductive materials up to a few kilometers into the Earth, which has been helpful to locate kimberlite pipes, as well as tungsten and copper.

Another relatively new prospecting technique is using low frequency electromagnetic (EM) waves for &#x27;sounding&#x27; into the Earth&#x27;s crust. These low frequency waves will respond differently based on the material they pass through, allowing for analysts to create three-dimensional images of potential ore bodies or volcanic intrusions. This technique is used for a variety of prospecting, but can mainly be for finding conductive materials. So far these low frequency EM techniques have been proven for geothermal exploration as well as for coal bed methane analysis.

=== Geochemical prospecting ===
Geochemical prospecting involves analyzing the chemical properties of rock samples, drainage sediments, soils, surface and ground waters, mineral separates, atmospheric gases and particulates, and even plants and animals. Properties such as trace element abundances are analyzed systematically to locate anomalies.

<text>Stratfield Saye House is a large stately home at Stratfield Saye in the north-east of the English county of Hampshire. It has been the home of the Dukes of Wellington since 1817.

==Early history==

The line of the Roman Road the Devil&#x27;s Highway passes East to West just within the Northern boundary of the grounds of Stratfield Saye House 
The Manor of Stratfield Saye was created by the joining of two older manors. In the 12th century Stratfield was owned by the Stoteville family, and then early in the 13th century this passed by marriage to the Saye family.

Before 1370 the manor passed on again by marriage to the Dabridgecourts, and in 1629 they sold the property to the Pitt family, cousins of the great father-and-son Prime Ministers.

The main part of the house was extensively enlarged around 1630 by Sir William Pitt, Comptroller of the Household to King James I. Sir William&#x27;s eldest son, Edward Pitt (1592–1643), MP, of Steepleton Iwerne, Dorset, and later of Stratfield Saye, bought the estate for £4,800 in 1629. Further extensive alterations were carried out to the house and park in the 18th century by George Pitt, 1st Baron Rivers.

==Purchase by the state==
The estate was purchased by the state in 1817, so that it could be given by a grateful nation to the victorious Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. The government gave £600,000 for the construction of a proposed &quot;Waterloo Palace&quot; to rival Blenheim Palace, home of the Dukes of Marlborough. 

The Hampshire site Wellington chose was the estate of Stratfield Saye, home of the Pitt family. He was advised on the purchase by the architect Benjamin Dean Wyatt who had once been his private secretary. He originally planned to demolish the existing house, and replace it with a more prestigious home, to be known as Waterloo Palace. These plans were abandoned in 1821, when they proved to be too expensive, and subsequently the duke made numerous additions and improvements to the existing building. All but the 1st and 6th Dukes are buried at Stratfield Saye House.

==The Wellington Exhibition==
The stables are grade II listed buildings. They now contain the Wellington Exhibition, which depicts the life and times of the 1st Duke. It houses a large collection of military mementoes. The Duke&#x27;s cast bronze funeral carriage, made from melted-down French cannons captured at the Battle of Waterloo, was moved to Stratfield Saye in the 1980s.

==Duke of Wellington Commemorative Column==

The Duke of Wellington Commemorative Column stands at the entrance to Stratfield Saye on the eastern Heckfield side. The Corinthian column, which can be viewed from the A33, is topped by a bronze statue by Baron Carlo Marochetti. The column was erected in 1863.

==Places named after Stratfield Saye House==
Strathfieldsaye, now a suburb of Bendigo in Victoria, Australia, was named after Stratfield Saye House. Between 1861 and 1994, there was also a Shire of Strathfieldsaye. The name of Strathfield, now a suburb of Sydney, Australia, also comes ultimately from Stratfield Saye House. The names of the suburbs of North Strathfield and Strathfield South, and the Municipality of Strathfield have the same origin.

==In popular culture==
Filming of the Steven Spielberg film &quot;War Horse&quot; began in August 2010 with the cavalry scenes being filmed at Stratfield Saye House, where Wellington&#x27;s war horse, Copenhagen, is buried.

<text>The West Slavic languages are a subdivision of the Slavic language group. They include Polish, Czech, Slovak, Kashubian, Silesian, Upper Sorbian and Lower Sorbian. The languages have traditionally been spoken across a mostly continuous region encompassing the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, the westernmost regions of Ukraine and Belarus, and a bit of eastern Lithuania. In addition, there are several language islands such as the Sorbian areas in Lusatia in Germany, and Slovak areas in Hungary and elsewhere.

== Classification ==
West Slavic is usually divided into three subgroups—Czech–Slovak, Lechitic and Sorbian—based on similarity and degree of mutual intelligibility. The groupings are as follows:

The Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology classifies the West Slavic languages within their Glottolog database as follows:

Some linguists include Upper and Lower Sorbian in the Lechitic branch, but other linguists regard it as a separate branch. The reason for this is that &#x27;the Sorbian dialects are extremely diverse, and there are virtually no linguistic features common to all Sorbian dialects which distinguish them as a group from the other Slavic languages&#x27; (Sussex &amp; Cubberley 2006). Czech and Slovak are more closely related to each other than to the other West Slavic languages, and also closer to each other than Polish and Sorbian are. Czecho-Slovak (Slovak in particular) shares certain features with other Slavic languages, such as Slovene and BCMS.

==Distinctive features==
Some distinctive features of the West Slavic languages, as from when they split from the East Slavic and South Slavic branches around the 3rd to 6th centuries AD (alternatively, between the 6th and 10th centuries), are as follows:
* Development of Proto-Slavic &quot;*tj&quot;, &quot;*dj&quot; into palatalized &quot;ts&quot;, &quot;(d)z&quot;, as in modern Polish/Czech/Slovak &quot;&quot; (&quot;night&quot;; compare Russian (&quot;noch&quot;));
* Retention of the groups &quot;kv&quot;, &quot;gv&quot; as in Polish (&quot;flower&quot;); &quot;&quot; (&quot;star&quot;) (Compare Russian (&quot;cvet&quot;); (&quot;zvezda&quot;));
* Retention of &quot;tl&quot;, &quot;dl&quot;, as in Polish/Slovak/Czech &quot;&quot; (&quot;ard&quot;; compare Russian );
* Palatized &quot;h&quot; developed into &quot;š&quot;, as in Polish &#x27; (locative case of &#x27;, &quot;fly&quot;);
* The groups &quot;pj&quot;, &quot;bj&quot;, &quot;mj&quot;, &quot;vj&quot; developed into (soft) consonant forms without the epenthesis of &quot;l&quot;, as in Polish &quot;&quot; (&quot;I shall buy&quot;; compare Russian );
* A tendency towards fixed stress (on the first syllable in Czech and Slovak and on the penultimate syllable in Polish);
* Use of the endings &quot;-ego&quot; or &quot;-ého&quot; for the genitive singular of the adjectival declension;
* Extension of the accusative form &quot;*tъnъ&quot; to nominative in place of &quot;*tъ&quot;, leading to Slovak/Polish/Czech &quot;&quot; (&quot;this&quot; (masc.); compare Russian ; Old Church Slavonic );
* Extension of the genitive form &quot;*čьso&quot; to nominative and accusative in place of &quot;čь(to)&quot;, leading to Polish/Czech &quot;&quot; (&quot;what&quot;, compare Russian ; OCS , genitive чьсо).

Although influences from other language families have contributed a lot of loanwords, and to a lesser extent to verb morphology and syntax, the Slavic languages retained a distinctly Slavic character, with clear roots in Indo-European.

The West Slavic languages are all written in the Latin script, while the East Slavic branch uses Cyrillic and the South Slavic branch is mixed.

==History==
The early Slavic expansion reached Central Europe in c. the 7th century, and the West Slavic dialects diverged from Common Slavic over the following centuries. West Slavic polities of the 9th century include the Principality of Nitra and Great Moravia. The West Slavic tribes settled on the eastern fringes of the Carolingian Empire, along the &quot;. The Obotrites were given territories by Charlemagne in exchange for their support in his war against the Saxons.

In the high medieval period, the West Slavic tribes were again pushed to the east by the incipient German &quot;, decisively so following the Wendish Crusade in the 11th century. The Sorbs and other Polabian Slavs like Obodrites and Veleti came under the domination of the Holy Roman Empire and were strongly Germanized. 

The Bohemians established the Duchy of Bohemia in the 9th century, which was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in the early 11th century. At the end of the 12th century the duchy was raised to the status of kingdom, which was legally recognized in 1212 in the Golden Bull of Sicily. Lusatia, the homeland of the remaining Sorbs, became a crown land of Bohemia in the 11th century, and Silesia followed suit in 1335. The Slovaks, on the other hand, never became part of the Holy Roman Empire, being incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary. Hungary fell under Habsburg rule alongside Austria and Bohemia in the 16th century, thus uniting the Bohemians, Moravians, Slovaks, and Silesians under a single ruler. While Lusatia was lost to Saxony in 1635 and most of Silesia was lost to Prussia in 1740, the remaining West Slavic Habsburg dominions remained part of the Austrian Empire and then Austria-Hungary, and after that remained united until 1992 in the form of Czechoslovakia.

Over the past century, there have been efforts by some to standardize and to recognize Silesian, Lachian, and Moravian as separate languages.

<text>Rzepin () is a town in western Poland. Situated in the Lubusz Voivodeship (since 1999), in Słubice County it is the seat of Gmina Rzepin. From 1975 until 1998 the town, from an administrative point of view, belonged to the Gorzów Wielkopolski Voivodeship. As of 2019, the town had a population of 6,529 inhabitants.

==Geography==
The town is situated in the western part of the Lubusz Lake District and Torzymska Plain (315.43), in the longitudinal postglacial valley, in the historical region of Lubusz/Lebus Land.

===Hydrology===
The Ilanka river, which is the right-bank tributary of the Oder river, flows through the town and takes the tributary Rzepin to the south of the town, near Nowy Młyn. Among the Ilanka&#x27;s hydrological curiosities is the phenomenon of bifurcation, occurring to the north of Rzepin, where the river separates its stream. As a result, some waters flow into the Łęczna river to the Warta drainage. Rzepin surroundings is rich in glacial lakes, among others: Busko, Długie – local bathing beach, Głębiniec, Linie, Lubińskie, Oczko, Papienko (Popienko) and Rzepsko.

===Rzepin Forest===
Rzepin was given ownership of the adjacent forests before 14th century, which was confiscated in 1553 because of the wrongly laid tax by the town authorities. The town maintained its rights only to a small part of the rickety woodland. High population of game animals in the region was confirmed by the presence of two royal forests in the vicinity of Rzepin. In the 18th century, a royal forest district was established under administration of the &quot;Oberforsthaus Reppen&quot;, which, under current name of Dąbrówka, also known as Osęka (currently a part of the Rzepinek settlement) is still being used as a forest lodge. Currently the term Rzepin Forest should only be treated in historical context, or to some extent, as an equivalent of the Lubusz Forest, which is a vast woodland situated mostly in the vicinity of Rzepin and Torzym in the Lubusz Voivodeship. The forest district administration is located in Rzepin.

==Etymology==
The origin is, without any doubt, Slavic. In 1856 Berghaus investigated the town name origin of words: repina (a folk name of maple), rjepa (turnip), or rjepnik (field of turnip). According to Mucke, the name could originate from the word ryby (fish) – Rybin, Rybek, Rybno – fisherman&#x27;s colony (town located by the riverside). Current Polish etymology (according to Rospond, Rymut and Malec) clearly indicates a nickname Rzepa (Polish name of turnip), or the name of turnip itself, as the town name origin.

==History==
The town was founded in the place of a 10th-century fort and a craftsmen settlement outside the fort, which was located near a convenient crossing of the Ilanka river. It was located in Lubusz Land, which was part of the provinces of Greater Poland and Silesia of the Medieval Kingdom of Poland. In the second half of the 13th century the land was handed over by archbishops of Magdeburg to Brandenburg margraves. Rzepin&#x27;s history become turbulent ever since. The town was sold many times and its land was regularly confiscated. Medieval Rzepin was a town inhabited by craftsmen. There were guilds of clothiers, butchers, bakers and shoemakers. Its citizens were also earning their living as fishermen and brewers. A water mill was a part of the town landscape. Thanks to the citizens’ resourcefulness and valor the town was developing rapidly, however, it was hindered by plagues and other disasters, including numerous fires. One of them destroyed a historical town hall. Between 1373 and 1415 the town was part of the Lands of the Bohemian (Czech) Crown. From the 18th century the town was part of the Kingdom of Prussia and between 1871 and 1945 it was part of Germany. 
In 1945 it was assigned to Poland. Already in June 1945, the entire town populace was deported from their home for new Polish settlers to take their place.

The oldest record about Rzepin dates back to 1297 and it regards the presence of pleban de Repin (Repin&#x27;s parson) Iacobus Craft at a ceremony of granting the village of Wystok to the Paradyż monastery. In 14th and 15th century the town was defined with a ‘New’ suffix, which could signify its new location or new town charter: 28 July 1329 – Newen Reppin, 1335 – Nyen Rypin, 1441 – Nyen Reppen. The grad was possibly transferred into a more convenient place because the remains of an earlier grad upon the Ilanka river, between Tarnawa Rzepińska and Starościn, survived until our times. The names Reppin or Reppen appear in the German literature, while Rypin or Rzepin can be found in the Polish sources. In 1437 the name Stat Kleynen Reppin appeared once more, however an attempt to call the town ‘little’ was unsuccessful. Since the mid-15th century, its name was written without the adjective. After World War II, during a short period of time, the town was called Rypin Lubuski, whereas since the late 1940s the current form has been used. It also became the county town (Rzepin County with its seat in Słubice).
A short history of the town (1850–1945):
* 1869 – construction of the railway line Frankfurt (Oder)–Rzepin–Poznań
* 1875 – construction of the railway line Szczecin–Rzepin–Głogów
* 1881 – construction of a Richter Fund Hospital (the building in Słubicka Street doesn&#x27;t exist any more)
* 1890 – construction of the railway line Rzepin–Ośno Lubuskie–Sulęcin–Międzyrzecz
* 1904 – the town becomes a seat of Rzepin County
* 1911–1913 – construction of new primary and secondary schools
* 1926 – founding and parceling out of a new settlement land near the Drenziger Weg (now Słowacki Street)
* 1927 – a new municipal beach and sports center is being opened by Długie Lake
* 1929 – construction of a new post office (now in Wojsko Polskie Street)
* 1939 – according to the census from 17 May, the town was inhabited by 6442 citizens, and its area consisted of 2610,6 hectares
* 1945 – Rzepin is captured by the Soviets and then turned over to the Polish administration; the expulsion of the town population takes place

==Urban planning==
The shape of the medieval Rzepin resembled a rectangle 300 x 400 m. The town layout revealed three parallel streets, that were crossing the town longitudinally and transversely, distinguishing the medieval marketplace. The oldest plan of Rzepin was compiled by Eichler in 1725.
The Old Town, with high – density housing, is located on the right bank of the Ilanka, whereas from the remaining sides it was surrounded by a ditch (town moat), which was subsequently filled back in due to the negative influence of the humid microclimate. Now it serves as a park alley.

Town layout consists of 69 streets and 2 squares: the Kościelny (Church) Square and the Ratuszowy (Town Hall) Square.

==Sights==

* Sacred Heart of Jesus Church – built around the mid-13th century in the late-Romanesque style, converted in the neo-Gothic style in 1878, which coincided with the addition of a belfry. Only stone walls of the south and the north elevations along with the chancel with three characteristic windows have remained from the previous sanctuary. A 15th-century Gothic brick chapel annex with an ogival portal and groin vault is adjacent to the church from the North.; The church has been in possession of 19-pipe organs since 1879. Currently the parochial church is situated in the town center on the Koscielny square;
* Hunting lodge – a classicistic building, erected in the 18th century; currently on the Słubicka Street;
* Town Hall (&quot;Ratusz&quot;) – a building erected in 1833, severely damaged during World War II, rebuilt between 1950 and 1960;
* Piast Oak – a natural monument, Quercus robur, circumference , height . It is estimated to be around 600 years old, placed in the village of Liszki, around South from the town;
* Beaver&#x27;s Path Nature Trail – situated at the Rzepia river&#x27;s mouth to the Ilanka river, with its beginning at the forest&#x27;s lodge in the settlement of Nowy Młyn;
* Water Mill – built in the beginning of the 19th century, currently powered by an electric turbine;

==Nature==
* Natural monuments: ‘Oak Piast’ Pedunculate Oak (circumference 613 cm; estimated to be around 700 years old); additionally, several single trees – mostly old oaks in the forest district of Nowy Młyn; two groups of the Scots Pines (Nowy Młyn, Grodzisko near Starościn); there are also Populuses and Willows in the town; the only monument of the unanimated nature is a glacial erratic near the settlement of Gajec.
* The nearest nature reserves: the Torfowiska Sułowskie Peat Bog Reserve (an area included in the Natura 2000 Networking Programme, where a habitat of Aldrovanda vesiculosa has been introduced)
* Several ecological sites, most of which are within the borders of the National Forests, e.g. ‘Łąki’, ‘Wzdłuż Ilanki’, ’Przy Ilance’, ‘Wokół Jeziora Popienko’ (the habitat of Bog Orchid).

<text>Relic Entertainment Inc. (formerly known as THQ Canada Inc.) is a Canadian video game developer based in Vancouver, founded in 1997. The studio specializes in real-time strategy games and is known for series such as &quot;Homeworld&quot;, &quot;Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War&quot; and &quot;Company of Heroes&quot;. Acquired by THQ in 2004, the company was sold to Sega on January 22, 2013, as part of THQ&#x27;s bankruptcy and operated under its European division. By May 2024, Relic had secured a partnership with an external investment group, allowing it to split from Sega and operate independently.

==History==
===Founding and &quot;Homeworld&quot; (1997–2004)===
Relic was founded in May 1997 by Alex Garden, Luke Moloney, Erin Daly, Aaron Kambeitz, Rob Cunningham, Gary Shaw, and Shane Alfreds. The name of the company was chosen because they liked the name and it was easy to pronounce. Their first title, &quot;Homeworld&quot;, was released on September 28, 1999, to critical acclaim and successful sales. Though they did not immediately continue working on the franchise (Sierra Entertainment, the game&#x27;s publisher, owned the rights), the game did have a spin-off, &quot;&quot;, developed by Barking Dog Studios and published by Sierra.

Their next title was &quot;Impossible Creatures&quot;, released by Microsoft on January 7, 2003. It focused on a fictional environment during the 1930s, allowing players to design units from different anatomical parts of animals. The game was successful, though it did not receive the same attention as &quot;Homeworld&quot;.

&quot;Homeworld 2&quot; was released on September 16, 2003. Although it boasted improved graphics and features and changed some elements of gameplay from the original, reviews cited some issues and did not score it as highly as its predecessor.

===Acquisition by THQ (2004–2013)===
On April 27, 2004, publisher THQ announced it was acquiring Relic for close to in an all-cash transaction, completed around early May 2004.

Relic released &quot;Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War&quot; on September 20, 2004, a real-time strategy game based on Games Workshop&#x27;s popular &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; franchise. The game was a success, with many reviewers applauding its innovative resource management system and squad-based interface. As a series &quot;Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War&quot; has sold more than 7 million copies worldwide as of January 2013. Following up on the success of &quot;Dawn of War&quot;, Relic released an expansion pack entitled &quot;Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War: Winter Assault&quot; on September 23, 2005. The expansion added a fifth faction, the Imperial Guard, to the game, as well as giving the existing races several new units. The expansion was mildly successful, although it did not have the impact of the original game. &quot;Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War: Dark Crusade&quot;, a second, standalone expansion pack for &quot;Dawn of War&quot;, was released on October 9, 2006.

Relic&#x27;s first foray into the console world of gaming, &quot;The Outfit&quot;, was released on March 13, 2006, for the Xbox 360. Not very successful, many reviewers saw it as a love-it-or-hate-it game. It was also criticized for its weak single-player modes.

&quot;Company of Heroes&quot;, a World War II-themed real-time strategy game, was released on September 12, 2006. It used Relic&#x27;s new Essence engine. The engine, which had been designed in-house by Relic, featured many next-generation graphical effects, including HDR and dynamic lighting, as well as utilizing the Havok middleware physics engine. The game was very successful and won many awards from multiple gaming magazines and websites. As of January 2013, the &quot;Company of Heroes&quot; series has sold more than 4 million copies worldwide. On September 25, 2007, &quot;Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts&quot;, the stand alone expansion pack to &quot;Company of Heroes&quot; was released. It introduced two new playable armies, the British 2nd Army and the German Panzer Elite. On November 3, 2008, Relic announced a second &quot;Company of Heroes&quot; stand-alone expansion, &quot;Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor&quot;, which was released on April 9, 2009. This expansion introduced a new campaign, new units, weapons, game play features and three new game types.

There has been speculation supported through various sources that Relic has re-acquired the rights to the &quot;Homeworld&quot; franchise from Vivendi. Finally, following the discovery of a document on the United States Patent and Trademark Office&#x27;s electronic filing system by a fan, THQ confirmed that Relic indeed owns the trademark again, making a continuation of the series under THQ&#x27;s lead possible. However, no comment on future installments was given.

Relic released the sequel to &quot;Dawn of War&quot;, &quot;Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II&quot;, on February 18, 2009. It featured the introduction of the Tyranids to the &quot;Dawn of War&quot; series. In an attempt to avoid recent complaints about digital rights management, Relic chose to release &quot;Dawn of War II&quot; on Steam and use Games for Windows – Live to arrange multiplayer matches. Subsequently, expanded with &quot;Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II – Chaos Rising&quot; in March 2010, and &quot;Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II – Retribution&quot; in March 2011, the latter saw the multiplayer platform move to Steamworks.

In early September 2011, Relic released its second cross platform console title, &quot;Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine&quot;. It was released for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on September 6, 2011, in North America and September 9, 2011, in Europe. It features the Ultramarines chapter. Its gameplay focuses on a hybrid shooting and melee combat model.

In May 2012, Relic Entertainment announced it was developing the highly anticipated sequel &quot;Company of Heroes 2&quot; for the PC platform, scheduled for release in early 2013. In this sequel the game moves the battle away from the Western Front of World War II and refocuses on the Eastern Front.

===Acquisition by Sega (2013–2024)===
In December 2012, during THQ bankruptcy filings, it was revealed that Relic Entertainment &quot;is currently developing &quot;Company of Heroes 2&quot; for a calendar year 2013 release and a new game with the working title &quot;Atlas&quot; for a release in calendar year 2014.&quot; On January 23, 2013, it was revealed that THQ had sold Relic Entertainment to Sega for as part of an auction of the company&#x27;s properties. Sega outbid ZeniMax Media by $300,000. The &quot;Homeworld&quot; franchise was sold to Gearbox Software at a separate auction in April 2013.

In November 2015, Relic Entertainment and Sega relinquished the rights of &quot;Impossible Creatures&quot; to THQ Nordic after it was revealed that neither THQ nor Microsoft Studios owned the rights to the video game. In May 2016, Relic Entertainment announced &quot;Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War III&quot;, which was released for personal computers in 2017.

On August 21, 2017, Microsoft announced that Relic will develop &quot;Age of Empires IV&quot;.

On July 12, 2021, Relic Entertainment announced &quot;Company of Heroes 3&quot; for PC to be released late 2022. It was revealed the game is in pre-alpha stage and that they have &quot;been co-developing the game with the community members for years now.&quot; On May 23, 2023, three months to the day after the release of &quot;Company of Heroes 3&quot;, it was reported that Sega would be laying off more than 120 employees at Relic, blaming external factors negatively impacting the wider industry.

===Independent company (2024–present)===
On March 28, 2024, Relic Entertainment announced that an external investor had assisted them in going independent. One week later, the studio laid off over 40 employees.

== Technology ==
The Essence Engine featured many new graphical effects at the time it was introduced, including high-dynamic-range lighting, dynamic lighting and shadows, advanced shader effects and normal mapping. The Essence Engine is also one of the first RTS engines to create detailed faces with facial animations.

In &quot;Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts&quot;, the Essence Engine was further improved to include weather effects, and also added support for DirectX 10 on Windows Vista.

&quot;Dawn of War II&quot; uses an updated version of Essence Engine (Essence 2.0) which allows for more detailed models and textures; more advanced lighting and shading effects; more complex &quot;sync-kills&quot; than those in &quot;Dawn of War&quot;; and better support for multi-processor systems.

&quot;Company of Heroes 2&quot; is the first game to feature the 3rd generation of the Essence Engine (Essence 3.0) which features DirectX 11 support. Improvement to the engine featured in the game include the new line-of-sight technology, TrueSight, which aims to better emulate troop visibility in real combat. In contrast to traditional unit visibility, TrueSight more accurately represents a unit&#x27;s visibility range based on environmental conditions and type of unit. Essence 3.0 also incorporates a weather-simulating technology known as ColdTech which allows for realistic obstacles and destructible environments.

<doc id="576891" wikidata="Q5708634" url="?curid=576891" title="Hello Cheeky">
<text>Hello Cheeky is a comedy series starring Barry Cryer, John Junkin and Tim Brooke-Taylor, broadcast on BBC Radio 2 between 1973 and 1979, and also broadcast on television - on the ITV network - in 1976. The format was short comedy sketches, often as short as one line, with occasional longer sketches.

The BBC radio show was broadcast weekly in a half-hour timeslot, usually on Saturday or Sunday lunchtime. Its three stars were normally the only performers who appeared, although the show&#x27;s musical director, Denis King, was often given a small speaking role in one or two of the shorter items.

The radio series featured music by the Denis King Trio, and was produced initially by David Hatch, then by Richard Willcox, and thereafter by Bob Oliver Rogers.

==Radio==
The series ran on BBC Radio 2 from 1973 to 1979. There were also three Christmas specials: &quot;Hello Cheeky Hello Christmas&quot; in December 1973, &quot;Hello Christmas&quot; in December 1974, and the pantomime-style &quot;Cheeky Whittington and his Magic Ballpoint&quot; in 1976. There was also a Summer Special in 1974.

Initially, the scripts were written by all three of the show&#x27;s stars. Later in the run, as Tim Brooke-Taylor&#x27;s time became increasingly absorbed by his television work on &quot;The Goodies&quot;, the scripts were written solely by Barry Cryer and John Junkin.

During the first two series in 1973-74 it was ordinarily produced by David Hatch, but occasional editions were produced by Richard Willcox (with both men credited on the 1974 summer special, &quot;Hello Summer&quot;) From series 3, in 1975, it was produced by Bob Oliver Rogers (with David Hatch returning briefly to produce some editions of the final series, aired in 1979, due to Bob&#x27;s unexpected death).

The initial experiment of broadcasting it at lunchtime on Saturdays lasted for one series only. From series 2 it was transmitted at lunchtime on Sundays, a more natural home for comedy shows, which had traditionally occupied that spot in the station&#x27;s schedules since the heyday of the old BBC Light Programme in the early 1960s.

To describe it as a sketch show, while technically correct, would also be misleading. It was typically more a succession of quick-fire gags and one-liners, rather than actual sketches. So many of the items were one-line, that co-writer Barry Cryer was moved to comment publicly that &quot;a minute was a long sketch on &quot;Hello Cheeky&quot;&quot;. One consequence of this was that the show lacked anything resembling a regular structure.

Some items did reappear each week, but not in any kind of regular order: these included quickfire &quot;meanwhile&quot;s, &quot;would you believe it?&quot;s, &quot;home hints for the handyman&quot;, &quot;the Encyclopedia of the Air&quot;, comic songs, spoof phone calls (one cast member would pretend to be a listener or celebrity, phoning to complain about the previous item), spoof news flashes, and &quot;Hello Cheeky&#x27;s personal column&quot; (a spoof advice forum). A number of the items that were used had previously been recorded by Marty Feldman (who John Junkin and Tim Brooke-Taylor had known since working together on television in 1968).

Many of the jokes were topical, featuring references to well-known personalities of the day: not only showbusiness celebrities (everyone from comedian Ken Dodd to actor Roger Moore), but also BBC presenters (including Michael Aspel, Frank Bough, Nicholas Parsons and Terry Wogan), politicians (especially the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, and the Leader of the Opposition, Mrs Thatcher), sportsmen (such as England international footballer Martin Peters), and prominent personalities of the day (the inevitable references to clean-up-TV campaigner Mary Whitehouse, and the anti-immigration MP, Enoch Powell).

The show gained a reputation for its puns. Two examples: &quot;I once spent an evening with twelve Benedictines&quot;. &quot;What happened?&quot; &quot;I drank them all, and fell over&quot;; and &quot;Enoch Powell sent me a draught board for Christmas. Trouble is, all the squares are white.&quot;

The final item each week, which was typically the longest item in the show, often featured a comic amalgam of three ostensibly serious broadcasts (e.g. Z-Cars, Gardeners&#x27; Question Time and A Book At Bedtime), with one of the cast changing channels on his TV or radio, such that a line from one programme (the &quot;feed&quot; line) was followed by one from a very different type of programme (the &quot;punchline&quot;), to get a laugh.

Occasionally, the final sketch was a film spoof. For instance, secret agent Jim Bellybutton appeared in an espionage sketch spoofing the James Bond films. These sketches tended to lampoon famous celebrities of the day. For example: &quot;Agent Bellybutton, not so much Roger Moore with the stamina of Martin Peters; more Patrick Moore, with the stamina of Sylvia Peters.&quot; A mad scientist has to rebuild him after an accident (spoofing The Six Million Dollar Man TV series): &quot;Six Pounds 37 New P? We couldn&#x27;t even rebuild Ronnie Corbett for that.&quot;

In later series the celebrities who were the butt of the jokes were invited onto the show, to be lampooned to their faces. Famous stars of the day who put themselves through this treatment included chat show host Michael Aspel, BBC TV sports presenter Frank Bough, and radio DJ Terry Wogan.

On 6 April 1975, &quot;The Least Worst of Hello Cheeky&quot; was recorded before a live audience in the BBC&#x27;s Paris Studio in Regent Street, produced by Bob Oliver Rogers. From the two-hour show, 45 minutes of material was released on a vinyl LP, while two 30-minute radio shows containing material from this recording session were broadcast on 25 January and 1 February 1976 as the final editions of the third series.

The Christmas and Summer specials were somewhat atypical. They did not reflect the standard format, and were in the main a collection of unrelated musical items interspersed with occasional jokes; the Christmas shows did not even have a preference for seasonal pieces. Some of the shorter musical items were performed by the show&#x27;s three stars, but many items solely featured guests. The Specials were also much longer than the standard half-hour of the regular episodes: the Summer Special was one hour, while the Christmas specials varied - the 1973 Christmas show was also one hour, while in 1974 it was 90 minutes. For the third and final seasonal edition, in 1976, in order to achieve a more comedy-focused show - this time allotted only 45 minutes of airtime - Cryer and Junkin wrote a &quot;Hello Cheeky&quot; pantomime (&quot;Cheeky Whittington and his Magic Ballpoint&quot;).

After the completion of four successful series for radio, plus the six Specials, a combination of unfortunate events occurred which curtailed what had been a popular and successful show. Firstly, a dispute arose with BBC Management, concerning the cast&#x27;s decision to defect to ITV, to make a TV version of the show. And then, unexpectedly, the radio show&#x27;s 29-year-old producer died. Former producer David Hatch was brought in to put together a final half-dozen episodes, from material already in the can, for a truncated final series: which was only transmitted after more than three years had elapsed since the previous series.

In recent years, some of the half-hour episodes from &quot;Hello Cheeky&quot; have been re-broadcast on digital station BBC Radio 7 and its successor BBC Radio 4 Extra. These have mostly been editions first heard in 1973, although &quot;Cheeky Whittington and his Magic Ballpoint&quot; also receives seasonal re-runs as an item in the three hour special, &quot;Barry Cryer&#x27;s Christmas Selection Box - Part 2&quot;.

With the exception of the two specials recorded on 6 April 1975, all of the radio broadcasts are known to exist (at least as off-air recordings).

==Television==
In 1976 an unsuccessful attempt was made to present &quot;Hello Cheeky&quot; on television, with the same writing and performing team. When BBC-TV turned the proposal down, the show aired instead on the ITV network. It was made by Yorkshire Television, with Len Lurcuck as producer, and ex-BBC comedy producer Duncan Wood as its executive producer.

The first series, comprising eight episodes, was broadcast between 19 January and 22 March 1976. A second series, comprising a further five episodes, was broadcast later that year, between 26 May and 23 June: the timing was a deliberate attempt to benefit from the popularity of the radio show, the latest series of which ran throughout that summer.

The TV show was not a ratings success. The reason for this was considered to be the fact that no attempt was made to make the material more visual for television.

The failure of the attempt to transfer the show to television, plus the impact on BBC Management of the cast defecting to ITV (and, in effect, using BBC Radio to promote a TV series on the rival ITV channel), had a disastrous effect on what had, up until then, been a very successful radio show: only a handful of further radio episodes would be made, and their transmission was postponed for several years (until the television show had ceased to air in re-runs on the ITV network).

The two TV series (except for Episode 10, which no longer exists in the archive) were released on DVD by Network in June 2010. The DVD was deleted from their catalogue on 13 January 2013.

<text>The Barbara Stanwyck Show is an American anthology drama television series which ran on NBC from September 1960 to September 1961. Barbara Stanwyck served as hostess, and starred in all but four of the half-hour productions. The four in which she did not star were actually pilot episodes of potential series programs which never materialized. Stanwyck won the Emmy Award in 1961 for Outstanding Performance by an Actress in a Series.

Three of the episodes in which Stanwyck starred were an attempt at spinning off a dramatic series of her own, in which she appeared as &quot;Josephine Little&quot;, an American woman running an import-export shop in Hong Kong.

The series, produced at Desilu Studios, was directed by different directors, Robert Florey, Jacques Tourneur, Stuart Rosenberg. &quot;The Barbara Stanwyck Show&quot; lasted one season. It aired at 10 p.m. Eastern on Mondays opposite Jackie Cooper&#x27;s military sitcom &quot;Hennesey&quot; on CBS and the second half of Gardner McKay&#x27;s &quot;Adventures in Paradise&quot; on ABC.

The American Gas Association sponsored the program on alternate weeks.

<text>A first information report (FIR) is a document prepared by police organisations in many South and Southeast Asian countries, including Myanmar, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, when they receive information about the commission of a cognisable offence, or in Singapore when the police receive information about any criminal offence. It generally stems from a complaint lodged with the police by the victim of a cognisable offence or by someone on their behalf, but anyone can make such a report either orally or in writing to the police, so it is necessary to know about cognisable offences. These are serious criminal offences that pose an immediate danger to society such as murder, rape, or robbery.

For a non-cognisable offence an entry in a community service register or in the station diary is made.

Each FIR is important as it sets the process of criminal justice in motion. It is only after the FIR is registered in the police station that the police take up investigation of most types of cases. Anyone who knows about the commission of a cognisable offence, including police officers, can file an FIR.

As described in law:
* When information about the commission of a cognisable offence is given orally, the police must write it down.
* The complainant or supplier of the information has a right to demand that the information recorded by the police be read to them.
* Once the information has been recorded by the police, it must be signed by the person giving the information.
* The complainant can get a free copy of an FIR.

An FIR includes the date, time, place, incident details, and a description of the person(s) involved.

<text>Barnaby Jones is an American detective television series starring Buddy Ebsen as a formerly retired investigator and Lee Meriwether as his widowed daughter-in-law. They run a private detective firm in Los Angeles, California. The show was originally introduced as a midseason replacement on the CBS network and ran from 1973 to 1980. Halfway through the series&#x27; run, Mark Shera was added to the cast as a much younger cousin of Ebsen&#x27;s character, who eventually joined the firm.

&quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; was produced by QM Productions (with Woodruff Productions in the final two seasons). It had the second-longest QM series run (seven and a half seasons), following the nine years of &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;. The series followed the characteristic Quinn Martin episode format with commercial breaks dividing each episode into four &quot;acts,&quot; concluding with an epilogue. The opening credits were narrated by Hank Simms.
Jerry Goldsmith composed the series&#x27; distinctive theme music.

The first episode of the show, &quot;Requiem for a Son&quot;, featured a crossover with another QM program, &quot;Cannon&quot;, with William Conrad guest-starring as detective Frank Cannon. There was another crossover between the two programs in the 1975 two-part episode &quot;The Deadly Conspiracy&quot;.

==Plot==

After Barnaby Jones (Buddy Ebsen) had worked as a private eye for many years, he decided to retire and left the business to his son Hal. When Hal was murdered while working on a case, Barnaby came out of retirement to find the killer. After this case, his widowed daughter-in-law, Betty Jones (Lee Meriwether), went to work for him at the detective agency. Jones was unusual, ordering milk in restaurants and bars, counter to the stereotypical hard-drinking detective.

In 1976, the character of Jedediah Romano &quot;J.R.&quot; Jones (Mark Shera), the son of Barnaby&#x27;s cousin, joined the show. He had come from Chicago to try to solve the murder of his father, who was a retired police officer. After that case was closed, he stayed in Los Angeles to help Barnaby and Betty, while also attending law school. Initially a somewhat angry young man, J.R. soon became an easygoing, fun-loving character.

Besides the Joneses, the only other recurring character on the show was their police contact, Lt. John Biddle (John Carter). He was introduced in the latter half of the second season and appeared in most episodes thereafter, though often only briefly.

As Ebsen aged and expressed an interest in slowing down a bit, Meriwether&#x27;s and Shera&#x27;s characters became more prominent, allowing Ebsen to reduce his role. During the last two seasons, episodes were divided evenly between the two actors, Meriwether and Shera each being the focus of half of the season&#x27;s episodes with Ebsen&#x27;s involvement limited to slightly more than episodic cameos. Ratings went up in the sixth and seventh seasons, after Shera&#x27;s character was added, but they plummeted during Season 8.

The show was canceled in 1980 due to declining ratings; Ebsen had also tired of playing the role. After the series&#x27; cancellation, reruns aired in syndication.

==Reception==
==Home media==
On February 16, 2010, CBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) released season one of &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; on DVD in Region 1 for the first time. The episode &quot;The Murdering Class&quot; has had the word &quot;nigger&quot; bleeped out when one of the characters speaks, although one can still hear the &quot;n&quot; sound of the word; because of this audio edit, the release was not called &quot;The Complete First Season&quot;. The episodes on the DVD include their broadcast trailers. This edit also exists on the VEI release.

As of September 2014, this release has been discontinued and is out of print.

On May 4, 2015, Visual Entertainment announced it had acquired the rights to the series in Region 1. It was subsequently announced that VEI would release &quot;Barnaby Jones—The Complete Collection&quot; on DVD on December 15, 2015. The 45-disc set features all 179 episodes (sourced from both network and syndication analog videotape masters for Seasons 2-8 made in the 1970’s and early-1980’s; Season 1 is the 2010 digital remaster with the bleeped out word) of the series as well as a bonus prequel episode.

==In other media==
===Film===
During the mid-1990s, Meriwether and Shera expressed interest in a &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; reunion television movie, but could not talk Ebsen into joining the project. However, in 1993, Ebsen reprised the role of Barnaby Jones in the film &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, adapted from Ebsen&#x27;s television series of the same name (Jim Varney played Jed Clampett, the role that Ebsen had played on the television series, in the film). It was Ebsen&#x27;s final theatrical appearance.

===Reruns===
From 1978 to 1983, &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; began broadcasting in off-net syndication.
Beginning September 3, 2019, MeTV began broadcasting &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; reruns.

<text>Ajahn Chah (17 June 191816 January 1992) was a Thai Buddhist monk. He was an influential teacher of the &quot;Buddhadhamma&quot; and a founder of two major monasteries in the Thai Forest Tradition.

Respected and loved in his own country as a man of great wisdom, he was also instrumental in establishing Theravada Buddhism in the West. Beginning in 1979 with the founding of &quot;Cittaviveka&quot; (commonly known as Chithurst Buddhist Monastery) in the United Kingdom, the Forest Tradition of Ajahn Chah has spread throughout Europe, the United States and the British Commonwealth. The dhamma talks of Ajahn Chah have been recorded, transcribed and translated into several languages.

More than one million people, including the Thai royal family, attended Ajahn Chah&#x27;s funeral in January 1993 held a year after his death due to the &quot;hundreds of thousands of people expected to attend&quot;. He left behind a legacy of dhamma talks, students, and monasteries.

==Name==
Ajahn Chah () was also commonly known as Luang Por Chah (). His birth name was Chah Chuangchot (), his Dhamma name was Subhaddo (), and his monastic title was Phra Bodhiñāṇathera ().

==Early life==
Ajahn Chah was born on 17 June 1918 near Ubon Ratchathani in the Isan region of northeast Thailand. His family were subsistence farmers. As is traditional, Ajahn Chah entered the monastery as a novice at the age of nine, where, during a three-year stay, he learned to read and write. The definitive 2017 biography of Ajahn Chah &quot;Stillness Flowing&quot; states that Ajahn Chah took his novice vows in March 1931 and that his first teacher as a novice was Ajahn Lang. He left the monastery to help his family on the farm, but later returned to monastic life on 16 April 1939, seeking ordination as a Theravadan monk (or bhikkhu). According to the book &quot;Food for the Heart: The Collected Writings of Ajahn Chah&quot;, he chose to leave the settled monastic life in 1946 and became a wandering ascetic after the death of his father. He walked across Thailand, taking teachings at various monasteries. Among his teachers at this time was Ajahn Mun, a renowned meditation master in the Forest Tradition. Ajahn Chah lived in caves and forests while learning from the meditation monks of the Forest Tradition. A website devoted to Ajahn Chah describes this period of his life:
==Thai forest tradition==

During the early part of the twentieth century Theravada Buddhism underwent a revival in Thailand under the leadership of teachers whose intentions were to raise the standards of Buddhist practise throughout the country. One of these teachers was Ajahn Mun. Ajahn Chah continued Ajahn Mun&#x27;s high standards of practice when he became a teacher.

The monks of this tradition keep very strictly what they believe to be the original monastic rule laid down by the Buddha known as the vinaya. The early major schisms in the Buddhist sangha were largely due to disagreements over which set of training rules should be applied. Some adopted a more flexible set, whereas others adopted a more strict one, both sides believing to follow the rules as the Buddha had framed them. The Theravada tradition is the heir to the latter view. An example of the strictness of the discipline might be the rule regarding eating: they uphold the rule to only eat between dawn and noon. In the Thai Forest Tradition, monks and nuns go further and observe the &#x27;one eaters practice&#x27;, whereby they only eat one meal during the morning. This special practice is one of the thirteen dhutanga, optional ascetic practices permitted by the Buddha that are used on an occasional or regular basis to deepen meditation practice and promote contentment with subsistence. Other examples of these practices are sleeping outside under a tree, or dwelling in secluded forests or graveyards.

==Monasteries founded==

After years of wandering, Ajahn Chah decided to plant roots in an uninhabited grove near his birthplace. In 1954, Wat Nong Pah Pong monastery was established, where Ajahn Chah could teach his simple, practice-based form of meditation. He attracted a wide variety of disciples, which included, in 1966, the first Westerner, Venerable Ajahn Sumedho. Wat Nong Pah Pong includes over 250 branches throughout Thailand, as well as over 15 associated monasteries and ten lay practice centers around the world.

In 1975, Wat Pah Nanachat (International Forest Monastery) was founded with Ajahn Sumedho as the abbot. Wat Pah Nanachat was the first monastery in Thailand specifically geared towards training English-speaking Westerners in the monastic Vinaya, as well as the first run by a Westerner.

In 1977, Ajahn Chah and Ajahn Sumedho were invited to visit the United Kingdom by the English Sangha Trust who wanted to form a residential sangha. 1979 saw the founding of Cittaviveka (commonly known as Chithurst Buddhist Monastery due to its location in the small hamlet of Chithurst) with Ajahn Sumedho as its head. Several of Ajahn Chah&#x27;s Western students have since established monasteries throughout the world.

==Later life==
By the early 1980s, Ajahn Chah&#x27;s health was in decline due to diabetes. He was taken to Bangkok for surgery to relieve paralysis caused by the diabetes, but it was to little effect. Ajahn Chah used his ill health as a teaching point, emphasizing that it was &quot;a living example of the impermanence of all things...(and) reminded people to endeavor to find a true refuge within themselves, since he would not be able to teach for very much longer&quot;. Ajahn Chah would remain bedridden and ultimately unable to speak for ten years, until his death on 16 January 1992, at the age of 73.

<doc id="576916" wikidata="Q1033458" url="?curid=576916" title="Cannon (TV series)">
<text>Cannon is an American detective television series produced by Quinn Martin that aired from 1971 to 1976 on CBS. William Conrad played the title character, private detective Frank Cannon. The series was the first Quinn Martin production to run on a network other than ABC.

In total, there were 122 episodes, plus the series&#x27; two-hour pilot and a &quot;revival&quot; television film, &quot;The Return of Frank Cannon&quot; (1980).

==Synopsis==
Cannon was portrayed in the series as a veteran of the Korean War and a former member of the Los Angeles Police Department. He was not only street smart but also appeared to have an unusually high level of education outside the law enforcement field. Besides his familiarity with several languages, he showed extensive knowledge of such diverse subjects as science, art, and history. Cannon was a widower, having lost his wife and son in a bomb attack while he was on the police force, as revealed in the two-hour pilot.

Conrad was an overweight actor, and the series, especially in its early episodes, made frequent mention of Cannon&#x27;s weight. Other characters would often remark critically about it, while he himself would joke self-deprecatingly about his girth and great love of food. In fact, Cannon was a gourmet cook who enjoyed preparing food for his friends. Despite his large size, he was a man of action. While he preferred to use his wits to escape a difficult situation, he could engage successfully in fistfights and shoot-outs with bad guys.

The plots, as in other detective series, revolved around Cannon solving crimes for a variety of clients. In a number of early episodes, he was hired by insurance companies to investigate losses. Other episodes involved him working for former police colleagues or other people from his past. In some cases, he was forced into action to clear himself of falsified charges. Many episode plot lines involved Cannon traveling and having to deal with various and sundry incompetent and/or corrupt law enforcement agencies and officials.

Throughout the series&#x27; run, Cannon drove Lincoln Continentals. In the pilot movie, he drove a 1970 model year 53A four-door hardtop sedan, which later crashed. In the series, he switched to the two-door personal luxury cars, driving a new model year every season – in Season 1, he drove a 1971 Mark III, before switching to Mark IVs for later seasons. In the 1980 TV movie, he drove a 1978 Cadillac Coupe de Ville.

==Cast==

Series star William Conrad was the only main cast member.

Other than the title role, the series had very few recurring characters. In the first season, Martin Sheen appeared twice as ex-policeman Jerry Warton, but the character did not extend beyond the first year. In fact, Sheen guest-starred in the third season as a completely different character: a lawyer who murdered Cannon&#x27;s client. The only other actors to appear in multiple episodes as the same character were Charles Bateman (five episodes as Lieutenant Paul Tarcher) and Arthur Adams (three episodes as Officer Bill Murray).

===Guest stars===
Notable guest stars included Anne Baxter, Johnny Cash, Cathy Lee Crosby, Micky Dolenz, Joan Fontaine, Mark Hamill, Larry Linville, Sondra Locke, Gary Lockwood, Leslie Nielsen, Nick Nolte, Susan Oliver, Stefanie Powers, Gordon Pinsent, Denver Pyle, Roy Scheider, and Martin Sheen.

==Production==
&quot;Cannon&quot; debuted as a two-hour movie on March 26, 1971, that served as the pilot. In the movie, Cannon returns from an extensive overseas assignment and investigates the murder of a close friend. A later episode would reveal that his wife and child were killed by a car bomb meant for him, prompting him to retire from the Los Angeles police force and become a private detective. The pilot was picked up as a regular series for the 1971–72 television season, and the first one-hour episode aired September 14, 1971. The first season aired on Tuesday nights at 9:30 pm Eastern, following the popular &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;.

The series moved to 10:00 pm Wednesday nights in season 2, then moved up to 9:00 pm Wednesdays for season 3, where it remained for the rest of the series run. Following three consecutive seasons in the Top 20 Nielsen ratings, plot violence and controversial themes increased in season 5 and &quot;Cannon&quot; fell to 39th and was cancelled.

===Props===
In an era before cell phone use, Cannon was frequently shown using a &quot;mobile phone&quot; in his signature Lincoln Continental, which was very rare at the time. Cannon would first ask the mobile operator to dial a call for him. Phones of this type were precursors to modern cell phones. The phone prop itself was a Motorola brand MTS mobile phone.

===Series overview===

===Connections to &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;===
Frank Cannon met Barnaby Jones (Buddy Ebsen), an aging veteran private investigator who had retired and turned over his agency to his son, Hal, when Hal is killed. With the aid of Cannon and Hal&#x27;s widow, Betty Jones (Lee Meriwether), he hunts down Hal&#x27;s killer. Afterwards, Jones decides to come out of retirement. The premiere episode of &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;, &quot;Requiem for a Son&quot; was planned as a second-season &quot;Cannon&quot; episode, but when &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; was sold as a separate series the script was reworked into the premiere of that series. William Conrad appeared as a special guest star.

&quot;Cannon&quot; had a second &quot;crossover&quot; with the &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; series. The first part of the two-part episode, &quot;The Deadly Conspiracy&quot;, was aired as the second episode of the fifth season of &quot;Cannon&quot; on September 17, 1975; the second part aired two nights later as the fourth-season premiere of &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;.

==Home media==
CBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) has released the first two seasons of &quot;Cannon&quot; on DVD in Region 1. Season 3 was released on January 10, 2013, via Amazon.com&#x27;s CreateSpace program. This is a manufacture-on-demand (MOD) release, available exclusively through Amazon.com.

On May 4, 2015, it was announced that Visual Entertainment had acquired the rights to the series in Region 1. They subsequently released &quot;Cannon – The Complete Collection&quot; on September 2, 2015.

On March 18, 2016, VEI re-released the first season on DVD and on April 1, 2016, they re-released the second season.

In Region 4, Shock Entertainment has released the first two seasons on DVD in Australia.

== Awards and nominations ==

==Parody==
In an episode of his Thames Television series, British comedian Benny Hill parodied 1970s American detective series. In the skit, Hill played several staple characters of the genre: Frank Cannon, Robert Ironside, Theo Kojak, Sam McCloud (ironically, all but the latter were airing on BBC1 at the time rather than on Hill&#x27;s home of ITV) and, although he was not a part of the genre, Agatha Christie&#x27;s Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot.

<text>Aiti (in Corsican &quot;Àiti&quot;, pronounced [ˈaː.i.di]) is a commune in the Haute-Corse department of France on the island of Corsica.

==Geography==
Aiti is some 15 km north of Corte and about 25 km inland from the east coast of Corsica. The Highway N193 from Corte goes north passing near the eastern border of the commune however the commune can only be accessed from this side by the D39 from Francardo a tortuous and circuitous road. The commune can also be accessed from the eastern side from San-Lorenzo on the Highway D39 which has a small connecting road across a bridge to the D39 road which enters the commune from the south and is another tortuous and circuitous route to the village of Aiti. Other than some short mountain access roads there are no other roads in the commune.

===Relief===
Aiti occupies the northern part of the mountain chain in the west of the massif of &quot;Monte San Petrone&quot; (1,767 m) which is separated by the Casaluna Valley.

The commune lies &quot;below the hill&quot; (&quot;Cismonte&quot; in Corsican), or &quot;Corsican Shale&quot; in the north-east of the island along the edge of the Cap Corse shale which continues to the San Petrone mountains and ends south of Castagnicia. These mountains are a block of lustrous shale from the Tertiary period during the uplift of the Alps on the Hercynian bedrock at the end of the Paleozoic era.

The highest point in the commune is the &quot;Cima a l&#x27;Orzale&quot; (1,121 m) south of the town and the lowest point is next to the Golo river (238 m) to the north-west.

The commune is mountainous with the hills of Castagnicia to the west. It occupies a small portion of a low-lying area called &quot;Cuvette de Ponte Leccia&quot; (Ponte Leccia Basin) which is one of a series of central low-lying areas stretching from L&#x27;Île-Rousse to Solenzara through Ponte Leccia, Corte, and Cateraggio. It includes many small valleys where streams flow to the Golo or the Casaluna.

===Hydrography===
The western border of the commune is the Callasima River which flows north to join the Golo River near Ponte-Leccia.

Several streams run through the commune, emerging from either side of the valley. The main streams are Poggie, Coticcio (fed by the Campo and Riduri), and Fossa Ceca.

<doc id="576928" wikidata="Q2887756" url="?curid=576928" title="Bat Masterson (TV series)">
<text>Bat Masterson is an American Western television series which was a fictionalized account of real-life marshal, gambler, and journalist Bat Masterson. The title character was played by Gene Barry, and the half-hour black-and-white series ran on NBC from 1958 to 1961. The show was produced by Ziv Television Productions. &quot;Bat&quot; is a nickname for Masterson&#x27;s first name Bartholemew, although the fictional Masterson says that his name is William Barkley Masterson.

The series was based on the biography &quot;Bat Masterson&quot; by Richard O&#x27;Connor, as noted in the closing credits.

==Overview==
The fictionalized Masterson dressed in expensive clothing, including a walking stick with a hidden sword. He preferred to use his cane rather than a gun to get himself out of trouble. He was portrayed as a ladies&#x27; man who traveled the West looking for women and adventure. He also came to the aid of innocents wrongly accused of crimes.

==Cast==


===Main cast===
* Gene Barry as Bat Masterson (108 episodes)
* Allison Hayes as Ellie Winters (7 episodes)
* Allen Jaffe as belligerent drunk (7 episodes)
* Ken Drake as Burdette (6 episodes)
* Troy Melton as government agent (6 episodes)

== Episodes ==

==Production==
===Development===
The series is a fictionalized account of the life of real-life Bat Masterson, who had been an Army scout, Indian fighter, lawman, and a deputy of Wyatt Earp. It was produced by Ziv Television Productions, and is loosely based on Richard O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s 1957 biography of Masterson. This was highlighted by the book&#x27;s front cover being shown at the end of the closing credits with an onscreen notation &quot;based on&quot;. A 1959 TV Guide article quoted the producer as stating they wanted the show to be as accurate as possible. The series was sponsored by Kraft.

=== Casting ===
Gene Barry originally turned down the role of Bat Masterson because he preferred to stay working in film, and he did not like ordinary cowboys. But when Barry, who wore a homburg and chesterfield coat when looking for work as an actor in New York, found out the character carried a cane and wore a derby hat, he jumped at the opportunity. Barry was selected for the part directly by Fred Ziv. Barry was the only regular cast member of the series, while guest stars each week included both name and soon-to-be-name performers.

=== Production design ===
While Bat Masterson&#x27;s dapper attire and gold-tipped cane might not seem like the look of a typical Wild West hero, Bat Masterson&#x27;s derby hat and cane were trademarks of the real-life Masterson, having been presented to him by the citizens of Dodge City and were thus incorporated into the character as portrayed in the series. In the series, his cane contained a hidden sword.

=== Music ===
The popularity of the singing cowboys of the fifties led to several classic Westerns having themes resembling cowboy ballads, and &quot;Bat Masterson&quot; was no exception. According to BMI and the sheet music, the theme music was written by Havens Wray (although incorrectly spelled by BMI as Ravens Wray). However, it was likely written by David Rose, an ASCAP member who couldn&#x27;t use his own name for a BMI composition. The words were by BMI writer Bart Corwin. The theme song was sung by Bill Lee, a member of the Mellomen.

=== Cancellation ===
Although &quot;Bat Masterson&quot; was positively reviewed by critics, the show was aired at a time when there were many other Westerns, and it was lost in the crowd. It never appeared in the Nielsen top 25. The show was cancelled after only three seasons.

==Release==

=== Broadcast ===
The show originally aired on NBC from October 8, 1958 to September 21, 1961. It was placed in a different time slot for each of its three seasons:

* October 1959September 1960, Thursdays from 8:008:30

=== Home media ===

TGG Direct released the first and second seasons on DVD in Region 1 on January 29, 2013. The third and final season was released on November 5, 2013. Due to licensing issues, the episode &quot;Terror on the Trinity&quot; is not included.

== Reception ==
A fictional Bat Masterson appeared in 34 episodes of the unrelated ABC/Desilu western series &quot;The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot; from 1955 to 1959. Mason Alan Dinehart played the role of Bat Masterson, with Hugh O&#x27;Brian as frontier peace officer Wyatt Earp. Dinehart was so associated with the role of Masterson that it was difficult for television audiences to adapt to a different actor in the role.

The show was extremely popular in Brazil. Gene Barry visited the country in 1961, the year that the show was first broadcast there, and he was received by President João Goulart for a talk in Brasilia.

==Other media==
===&quot;Guns of Paradise&quot; (1990)===
Barry recreated the role of Bat Masterson in an episode of the television series &quot;Guns of Paradise&quot; (1990), alongside Hugh O&#x27;Brian as Wyatt Earp.

===&quot;The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw&quot; (1991)===
In &quot;The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw&quot; (1991) Barry played Masterson, also with O&#x27;Brian as Earp, as well as Jack Kelly as Bart Maverick and Clint Walker as Cheyenne Bodie.

===Comic book===
Dell Comics issued nine issues of a quarterly &quot;Bat Masterson&quot; comic book between Aug./Oct. 1959 and Nov. 1961/Jan. 1962 with the initial issue a Four Color tryout (#1013).

===Comic strip===
Columbia Features syndicated a comic strip from September 7, 1959 to April 1960 written by Ed Herron and drawn by Howard Nostrand (Sept. 1959–Dec. 1959) and Bob Powell (Dec. 1959–April 1960). Nostrand was assisted (on backgrounds) by Neal Adams who had just graduated from the School of Industrial Arts; it was among his first professional art jobs.

<doc id="576940" wikidata="Q1248480" url="?curid=576940" title="Burke's Law (1963 TV series)">
<text>Burke&#x27;s Law is an American detective series that aired on ABC from 1963 to 1966. The show starred Gene Barry as millionaire captain of Los Angeles Police homicide division Amos Burke, who is chauffeured around to solve crimes in his 1962 Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud II complete with an early car phone.

The original series was converted into a spy drama, Amos Burke Secret Agent, in its third and final season. The series was revived in 1994–1995 on CBS, with Barry reprising the role of the millionaire detective.

==Premise==
The show shares stylistic similarities with Barry&#x27;s previous series, &quot;Bat Masterson&quot;, in which he played a debonair lawman of the Old West. During the opening credits, as the title flashes onscreen, a woman&#x27;s voice seductively pronounces the words &quot;It&#x27;s Burke&#x27;s Law!&quot; The title also reflects Burke&#x27;s habit of dispensing wisdom to his underlings in a professorial manner, &quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;Never ask a question unless you already know the answer. Burke&#x27;s Law.&quot;
The anomaly of a millionaire police captain is explained in a first episode conversation between Detective Tim Tilson and a potential witness. Told that Amos Burke is Head of the Homicide Division and a millionaire, the witness asks: &quot;Why a cop?&quot;
::Tilson: &quot;Why&#x27;re you a construction man?&quot;
::Witness: &quot;It&#x27;s what I do best.&quot;
::Tilson: &quot;That&#x27;s why he&#x27;s a cop.&quot;
:A variant is repeated in the 1994 revival.

The title of each episode begins with the words &quot;Who Killed...?&quot; with the name or description of the victim (who invariably dies or is found dead in the show&#x27;s opening minutes) completing it. Five or six &quot;special guest stars&quot; comprise the list of suspects. Burke is then driven to the crime scene in his Rolls-Royce by his loyal chauffeur, Henry.

Burke is an eligible bachelor whose dates with various gorgeous women are often interrupted by calls to begin a new case. He can be—though rarely—distracted by an alluring woman, and is often the object of much female interest.

Burke is assisted by Detective Tim Tilson (Gary Conway), Detective Sergeant Les Hart (Regis Toomey), and chauffeur Henry (Philippine actor Leon Lontoc). Two recurring characters were coroner George McLeod/McCloud (Michael Fox) and desk sergeant Gloria Ames (Eileen O&#x27;Neill).

Tilson is a brilliant, thorough young detective whose skill at finding clues and tracing references results in his &quot;almost&quot; solving the crime, only to be outflanked by Burke&#x27;s cool intuition and years of experience. Les Hart is a no-nonsense, seen-it-all veteran (perhaps a nod to Toomey&#x27;s numerous roles as cops in feature films) who has known Burke for years and is on a first name basis, while Henry often provides comic relief. The characters share a team camaraderie reflected in mild jokes about each other&#x27;s foibles.

==Production==
The role of Amos Burke actually antedated Barry&#x27;s series, having been played by Dick Powell in &quot;Who Killed Julie Greer?,&quot; the initial episode of &quot;The Dick Powell Show&quot; in September 1961. The first incarnation of the series was produced by Powell&#x27;s company, Four Star Television. As in the later series, the episode features several well-known TV and movie stars in cameo appearances as suspects – one of whom is the murderer (in the original Dick Powell episode Ronald Reagan played one of the suspects). John Damler played Sgt. Hart, the role played in the show by Regis Toomey. Leon Lontoc was the only cast member of the episode to reprise his role in the later series.

In the final season of the original series (1965–1966), the show was given a complete overhaul and retitled &quot;Amos Burke Secret Agent&quot;. Burke went to work for a secret government agency, but still drove around in his Rolls, which had been discreetly bulletproofed by the agency. The supporting cast of the earlier seasons was dropped, as was the heavy use of celebrity cameos. According to producer Aaron Spelling, the change was forced by ABC in reaction to the success of &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; and the James Bond films. The change was disliked by Barry and the crew. Ratings plummeted, and it was cancelled midway through the season.

As of 2010, the Rolls-Royce used in the original 1963 series was owned by a collector in Palm Beach, Florida.

==Music==
The musical score for &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; was largely the work of Herschel Burke Gilbert, who also wrote the show&#x27;s theme, although Richard Shores and Joseph Mullendore also composed scores. Gilbert&#x27;s theme was rearranged for &quot;Amos Burke, Secret Agent&quot;.

==Home media==
The following DVD sets of &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; have been released by VCI Entertainment.

VCI released the complete first season on April 5, 2016.

==Spin-off==

Actress Anne Francis, who appears in season-one episode &quot;Who Killed Wade Walker?&quot; and as female private detective Honey West in season-two episode &quot;Who Killed the Jackpot?&quot;, starred in the 30-episode spin-off &quot;Honey West&quot; TV series. Francis later reprised the role on the 1994 revival series, in the episode &quot;Who Killed Nick Hazard?&quot;

==1994 revival series==

In 1994, CBS premiered a revival of the show with the same title &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;. The revival was produced by Aaron Spelling&#x27;s production company, Spelling Productions.

In the revival of the show, Burke was back at work as a police detective — now as a deputy chief instead of a captain — and was assisted by his son, Peter (Peter Barton), a police detective. The only character to return was Henry, now played by Danny Kamekona (Lontoc had died in 1974).

<doc id="576942" wikidata="Q2270725" url="?curid=576942" title="Smash (wrestler)">
<text>Barry Allen Darsow (born October 6, 1959) is an American retired professional wrestler who performed as Smash, one half of the tag team Demolition. He also wrestled as Krusher Kruschev, Repo Man, the Blacktop Bully, Man Mountain Darsow and &quot;Mr. Hole in One&quot; Barry Darsow.

Throughout his career, he worked for Jim Crockett Promotions, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and several regional promotions in the 1980s and 1990s. He is a four-time former world tag team champion, winning three WWF World Tag Team Championships as part of Demolition and one NWA World Tag Team Championship as part of a three-man team with Ivan and Nikita Koloff (although the NWA no longer recognizes any former tag team champions prior to 1992, Darsow&#x27;s championship is considered part of the WCW World tag team championship lineage), and a one-time NWA United States Tag Team Champion.

==Early life==
Darsow attended high school in Robbinsdale, Minnesota, with six other future wrestlers: Curt Hennig, Richard Rood (Rick Rude), Brady Boone, Tom Zenk, John Nord (The Berzerker), and Scott Simpson (Nikita Koloff). He also worked as a bouncer with The Road Warriors, Hawk and Animal.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1983–1984)===
Darsow made his debut in Hawaii as Tsar Mongo, before a short stint in New Zealand. He returned to Hawaii, before he began wrestling in 1983 in Georgia for Georgia Championship Wrestling where he briefly wrestled under the ring name Man Mountain Darsow. He then moved later that year to Mid-South Wrestling as Crusher Darsow, a turncoat American who was now a Soviet sympathizer and a tag team partner of Nikolai Volkoff. He changed his name to Krusher Khruschev and became the first ever Mid-South Television Title champion in a tournament by beating Terry Taylor in the finals on May 2, 1984, but lost it to Taylor on June 16, 1984. Darsow moved on to Florida Championship Wrestling where he teamed with Jim Neidhart. They won the Florida United States Tag Team Titles on October 11, 1984, from Hector Guerrero and Cocoa Samoa. The team held them until December 1984, when they lost them to Mark and Jay Youngblood.

===Jim Crockett Promotions (1984–1987)===

Khruschev moved on to the National Wrestling Alliance to work for Jim Crockett Jr. in December 1984. He was awarded a third of the NWA World Six-Man Tag Team Championship with Ivan and Nikita Koloff after they fell out with their former partner Don Kernodle. The Koloffs had already won the NWA World Tag Team Championship and Ivan declared that any two of them could defend the titles. They feuded with The Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) and The Road Warriors. On July 9, 1985, he and Ivan lost the NWA Tag Titles to the Rock &#x27;N Roll Express. The Koloffs subsequently regained and defended the belts without Khruschev&#x27;s participation. At Starrcade 1985, on November 28, Khruschev won the vacant NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship by defeating Sam Houston. Later on that night, he was in the Koloffs&#x27; corner as they lost their Tag titles back to the Express in a cage match with Kernodle in the Express&#x27;s corner. On January 11, 1986, Khruschev severely injured his knee in a match with Houston on TBS. He lost the title to Houston and had to take almost six months off to recover.

When Khruschev returned, Nikita was feuding with Magnum T. A. for the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship. On August 17, 1986, Khruschev helped Nikita win the title in the final match of a Best of 7 series by holding the referee while Nikita used his &quot;Russian&quot; chain on Magnum. After helping Nikita defeat Magnum, Khruschev and Ivan targeted the new NWA United States Tag Team Championship, which was to be awarded to the winners of a tournament. They reached the finals, held on September 26, 1986, and defeated the Kansas Jayhawks (Dutch Mantel and Bobby Jaggers) with Nikita&#x27;s help to become the first US Tag Team Champions. In October 1986, Magnum T. A. had a car accident that ended his career, and after admitting that he respected his one-time rival, Nikita turned his back on Ivan and Khruschev to team with Magnum&#x27;s good friend, Dusty Rhodes. Kruschev and Ivan briefly feuded with Nikita and Rhodes but primarily defended their titles in rematches against Mantel and Jaggers. On December 9, 1986, they lost the US Tag Titles to Ron Garvin and Barry Windham. Darsow left the NWA after disputing a pay off with Jimmy Crockett.

===World Wrestling Federation (1987 − 1993)===
====Demolition (1987–1991)====

Darsow next went to the World Wrestling Federation. He was brought into the company to be part of the tag team Demolition, which had originally consisted of Bill Eadie as Ax and Randy Colley, who had been Moondog Rex of The Moondogs, as Smash. Darsow was tabbed as the new Smash after Colley, who wore face paint like Eadie did as part of his character, was deemed too recognizable even in disguise due to fans chanting &quot;Moondog&quot; at him whenever Demolition wrestled. At first, they were managed by Luscious Johnny V, but he was soon replaced by Mr. Fuji. Their initial feuds involved the team of Ken Patera and Billy Jack Haynes, and Strike Force (Tito Santana and Rick Martel). On March 27, 1988, at WrestleMania IV, they defeated Strike Force to win their first WWF World tag team title, which they held for a record 16 months. During this reign, they fell out with Mr. Fuji as he turned on them to manage their arch-rivals, The Powers of Pain (The Barbarian and The Warlord). This double turn at Survivor Series &#x27;88 was the solution to the massive popularity being enjoyed by Demolition. Originally, they were the heels in their rivalry with the Powers of Pain; however, as a result of the incident at the Survivor Series, Demolition became full-fledged babyfaces. Demolition conclusively won the feud with their ex-manager and his new team when they defeated the Powers and Fuji in a five-man handicap tag match at WrestleMania V.

They lost the WWF Tag Team Title to The Brain Busters (Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard) on the July 29, 1989&quot; Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXII&quot;. They regained the title on October 2, but lost them to The Colossal Connection (Haku and André the Giant) on December 13. They defeated the Connection at WrestleMania VI on April 1, 1990, to become the third ever team to win the titles a third time in WWF history. The duo was joined by Crush (Brian Adams) later in 1990, making them a 3-man tag team and the second team Darsow had been involved in whose title reign operated under the Freebird Rule. Ax began appearing in a managerial role which was to eventually lead to the phasing out of the character. Demolition lost the titles to The Hart Foundation at SummerSlam &#x27;90. After a feud with Legion of Doom, the team dropped down the card and would disband in the spring of 1991, with Crush leaving the WWF for a year and Smash wrestling as a singles wrestler, primarily in house show undercards, where he was used to elevate other stars, such as Kerry Von Erich, Greg Valentine and Ricky Steamboat. His only victories during this run came over Jim Powers and Shane Douglas. He also appeared under a mask as an unnamed man hired by Ted DiBiase to wrestle Virgil on the August 18, 1991 &quot;SummerSlam Spectacular&quot; special. His final recorded WWF match as Smash would occur on August 24, 1991, getting pinned by The British Bulldog.

====Repo Man (1991–1993)====
While still wrestling as Demolition Smash, Darsow made his initial appearance as Repo Man on July 30, 1991, in Portland, Maine, wrestling in a dark match at a Wrestling Challenge taping. Four days before his final match as Smash, he made a second appearance in a dark match at another Challenge Taping in Erie, PA and defeated Phil Apollo on August 20. Following the August 24 house show defeat to Davey Boy Smith, Darsow retired the Demolition gimmick and was off the road for three months. On the November 9 edition of Prime Time Wrestling a vignette aired that introduced his new Repo Man character. The repackaging was of a character who was a ubiquitous, sneaky heel character who delighted in repossessing items such as cars from people when they were late on (or unable to make) their payments. As Repo Man, Darsow wore a black domino mask (similar to The Lone Ranger and Zorro) and an outfit decorated with tire tracks, and had mannerisms similar to Frank Gorshin&#x27;s portrayal of The Riddler. He always carried a tow rope that he would tie up opponents with after defeating them and then assault them after. The character was actually the idea of Darsow himself, who previously had a job repossessing cars. Shortly after his debut, he was hired by Ted DiBiase to help him defeat Virgil for the Million Dollar Championship, leading to a series of matches with Virgil. At the This Tuesday in Texas pay-per-view, Repo Man and DiBiase defeated Virgil and Tito Santana. Repo Man made a memorable appearance at the 1992 Royal Rumble, sneaking to the ring and eliminating Nikolai Volkoff and Greg &quot;The Hammer&quot; Valentine before eventually being eliminated by The Big Boss Man. He also appeared at WrestleMania VIII, teaming with The Mountie and The Nasty Boys to be defeated by The Big Boss Man, Virgil, Hacksaw Jim Duggan and Sgt. Slaughter.

Repo Man&#x27;s most notable feud was with The British Bulldog in mid-1992, sparked by Repo Man hanging the Bulldog over the ring ropes with his tow rope on the May 3, 1992, episode of &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot;. The two had a series of house show matches as well as a match on &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot;, all of which saw Bulldog come out victorious. Repo Man lost a match to former partner Crush at SummerSlam, though it was never acknowledged on television that Repo Man was actually Smash. He also worked against Jim Duggan on house shows during this period. Repo Man also had a short feud with Randy Savage in January 1993 when he repossessed Savage&#x27;s hat on an episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;. The two had a match the following week, which Savage won. Repo Man made his final PPV appearance at the 1993 Royal Rumble, where he was eliminated by Savage. Originally, Darsow had planned that after a run as a villain, Repo Man would become a heroic character. However, the turn never happened. His final recorded match in the WWF would be on March 28, 1993, a loss to Typhoon.

===Independent Association of Wrestling (1993)===
In 1993, Darsow joined the IAW promotion where he teamed with Paul Roma to win the IAW Tag Team titles on February 4, 1993 (while he was still on the WWF roster). They held them until July 24, when they lost them to The Iron Sheik and Brian Costello.

===World Championship Wrestling (1994–1995)===
In 1994, Darsow signed with WCW. He first wrestled under his real name in January. By August, he began appearing in the front of events with a blow horn, making noise and berating the faces while they wrestled, and would sometimes be kicked out of arenas by security. On the November 26 edition of WCW Saturday Night, he was eventually kayfabe arrested for pushing Dustin Rhodes. Col. Rob Parker bailed Darsow out from jail, after which point Darsow became known as The Blacktop Bully, with Parker as his manager. He feuded with Rhodes, but both were fired after Uncensored 1995, when he and Rhodes both bladed (which was against WCW&#x27;s &#x27;no-blood&#x27; policy) during a &quot;King of the Road&quot; match in the back of a moving flatbed truck, which Darsow won.

===Independent circuit (1995–1997)===
From there, he went to Pro Wrestling America in Minnesota to feud with Wahoo McDaniel and Tom Zenk. He next appeared in the American Wrestling Federation, with Jimmy Valiant&#x27;s wife Big Mama as his valet. The AWF folded at the beginning of 1997.

===Return to WCW (1997–1999)===
Darsow returned to WCW under his real name on October 6, 1997, teaming with John Nord to defeat Mike Enos and Wayne Bloom in a dark match prior to &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;. For the following year, he appeared in the undercard as a heel, mostly on WCW&#x27;s tertiary and quaternary shows &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot; and &quot;WCW Worldwide&quot;. He also notably lost to Goldberg on the March 9, 1998, edition of &quot;Nitro&quot; and the April 16, 1998, edition of &quot;WCW Thunder&quot;. On the October 17, 1998, edition of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, he was repackaged as &quot;Mr. Hole-In-One&quot;, Barry Darsow, a villainous golf player. He often entered the ring in casual wear and a flat cap as if ready to golf and, prior to matches, would offer his opponents a victory if they could make a putt in the ring, often only to sneak attack the opponent. Darsow feuded with &quot;Hacksaw&quot; Jim Duggan and Chris Adams during this time, typically on &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. On the April 24, 1999, edition of &quot;Worldwide&quot;, Darsow dropped the golfer gimmick, returning to his given name and wearing a black singlet. On August 28, 1999, Darsow teamed with Bobby Eaton in a loss to Harlem Heat on &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. After Booker T pinned Darsow, Harlem Heat hit Darsow in the head with their WCW World Tag Team Championships. Due to the blow to the head, in the following weeks, Darsow took on an amnesia gimmick, wherein he would reprise a different one of his past JCP/WCW gimmicks every week (the Smash and Repo Man gimmicks were WWE trademarks). On the September 18, 1999, edition of &quot;Worldwide&quot;, Darsow reprised his Krusher Kruschev gimmick, and then returned to &quot;Mr. Hole-In-One&quot; on the September 18, 1999, edition of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. On October 2, 1999, he returned to his Blacktop Bully gimmick, which he used for the remainder of his time in WCW. His final match was a loss against Steven Regal on the December 18, 1999, edition of &quot;Worldwide&quot;.

===Return to the independent circuit (2000–2001, 2007-2017)===

Darsow joined the WXO promotion run by Ted DiBiase. He feuded with Mike Enos until it folded shortly after in 2001. That same year, Darsow made a special WWF appearance at WrestleMania X-Seven for the gimmick battle royal as Repo Man. After his Wrestlemania appearance Darsow retired from wrestling.

The Millennium Wrestling Federation (MWF) helped reunite Darsow with his partner Ax as Demolition and the two appeared at the Wrestling Living Legends reunion in Windsor, Ontario, Canada in March 2007. On the March 2008 MWF Ultra television program, Darsow, as Demolition Smash teamed with former WCW wrestler Rick Fuller to defeat Ox Baker&#x27;s Army in a tag team casket match. On &quot;Raw XV&quot;, on the 15th-anniversary &quot;WWE Raw&quot; special on December 10, 2007, Darsow participated in the 15th Anniversary Battle Royal under his Repo Man persona.

Alongside Ax and One Man Gang, he competed in the Chikara King of the Trios Tournament in 2008, but were eliminated in the second round by &quot;The Fabulous Three&quot; (Larry Sweeney, Mitch Ryder and Shayne Hawke). On October 28, 2009, Smash appeared, with his partner Ax, at the Keystone State Wrestling Alliance. Where they defeated Tag Team Champions Shawn Blanchard and Lou Martin for the KSWA Tag Team Championship, which they would hold for that match only before relinquishing them due to not being able to return for further shows. Darsow still competes on the independent circuit to this day with Ax. They are currently the GLCW and USXW Tag Team Champions. On March 12, 2011, Darsow made his Dynamic Wrestling Alliance debut at &quot;Dynamic Destiny 2011&quot; teaming with Ax as they took on another former WWF World Tag Team combination, &quot;The Dream Team&quot; (Greg &quot;The Hammer&quot; Valentine and Brutus &quot;The Barber&quot; Beefcake).

On May 21, 2011, Demolition reunited at Full Impact Pro&#x27;s debut iPPV &quot;In Full Force&quot;. Their match against Tony DeVito and Ralph Mosco went to a no contest when local commentator and manager Larry Dallas came out and said his men wanted revenge. The ring was stormed by Manu, Sami Callihan, Blain Rage and Joey Attel. Demolition, Devito and Mosco managed to clear the ring and beat Dallas to end the show. Demolition returned to Chikara on September 16, 2012, taking part in a tag team gauntlet match, from which they eliminated The Devastation Corporation (Blaster McMassive and Max Smashmaster), before being eliminated themselves by their old WWF rivals, the Powers of Pain.

He retired from wrestling in 2017 after Ax retired.

==Outside wrestling and in popular culture==
Darsow balances his time between wrestling, his two businesses, his family, and the golf course. Darsow owns Added Value Printing, a printing company that specializes in hard-hats and medical supplies, and also sells real estate. In December 2008, Darsow&#x27;s son, Dakota, signed a developmental contract with WWE. Darsow has worked with the Millennium Wrestling Federation (MWF)&#x27;s efforts with the Special Olympics. Darsow is good friends with Arn Anderson, Barry Horowitz, Bill Irwin, and Brad Rheingans. He was also good friends with Curt Hennig, Rick Rude (both of whom he attended high school with), Brady Boone, Dino Bravo, and Brian Adams. Japanese band Aural Vampire produced a song called &quot;The Repoman&quot; and use video footage of Darsow and other wrestlers in live performances. Former Ring of Honor performer Adam Pearce is often heckled by fans who call him &quot;Repo Man&quot; because he looks similar to Darsow. At one match in 2007, at the pay-per-view taping for Driven, against Takeshi Morishima, Pearce pulled a mask similar to the Repo Man&#x27;s out of his tights and put it on to the delight of the crowd.

==Personal life==
In July 2016, Darsow was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit is litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in some number of other lawsuits against WWE. The lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant in September 2018. In September 2020, an appeal for the lawsuit was dismissed by a federal appeals court.

<text>Angelfish was a short-lived early-1990s Scottish alternative rock group originating from Edinburgh, Scotland, formed as a side-project to Scottish group Goodbye Mr Mackenzie, after keyboardist and backing vocalist Shirley Manson was signed as a solo artist to circumvent the Mackenzies&#x27; existing record contract. 

==Career==
Angelfish released a single self-titled studio album, &quot;Angelfish&quot;, and two singles of which the first was an EP for minor college radio hit &quot;Suffocate Me&quot;. The &quot;Angelfish&quot; album was born out of necessity when Goodbye Mr Mackenzie&#x27;s record distributor MCA expressed interest in recording an album with Manson on lead vocals rather than furthering its commitment to the Mackenzies. The Mackenzies&#x27; record label boss Gary Kurfirst signed Manson as a solo artist, with the remaining Mackenzies performing as her backing band to circumvent the band&#x27;s existing deal with MCA. &quot;Angelfish&quot; received a positive response from contemporary music critics and journalists. Barry Egan of &quot;Creem&quot; wrote: &quot;Their self-titled debut displays the kind of out-of-kilter charm and intensity that most artists can only lie about possessing... this is indeed a record that owes much to Scotland&#x27;s Cocteau Twins as it does to Lou Reed&#x27;s feel-good dark angels, The Velvet Underground.&quot; In the &quot;Gavin Report&quot; trade publication, their alternative reviewer wrote &quot;An interesting sound... one that recalls elements of early Blondie and Patti Smith&quot;.

Two releases promoted the album; the first an EP, &quot;Suffocate Me&quot; was released mid-1993, while the second, &quot;Heartbreak to Hate&quot;, was released to radio at the time of the album&#x27;s release. The music video for &quot;Suffocate Me&quot; famously aired once by MTV during &quot;120 Minutes&quot;, where it was seen by Garbage co-founder Steve Marker. Manson was asked to join Garbage, and accepted. The Angelfish side-project was dissolved, while Goodbye Mr. Mackenzie continued on for another two years without Manson.

<text>Montrose is an unincorporated community on the border between Bath Township, Copley Township, and the city of Fairlawn in Summit County, Ohio, United States. It is an area of restaurants, stores, and businesses located along a stretch of State Route 18 near Interstate 77. The community is served by the Fairlawn (44333) post office. It is included in the Montrose-Ghent census-designated place. It had been a quiet hamlet for much of its history, with such establishments as a drive-in theater, golf courses, and a church. It became a busy retail area in the 1990s as new commercial development moved in.

Montrose was originally called Latta&#x27;s Corners and then Ellis&#x27; Corners. The community first developed around a tavern built by one Mr. Latta. A post office called Montrose was established in 1849, and remained in operation until 1911. The present name most likely is derived from wild roses near the elevated town site.

<doc id="576965" wikidata="Q5246680" url="?curid=576965" title="Dean of the United States House of Representatives">
<text>The dean of the United States House of Representatives is the longest continuously serving member of the House. The current dean is Hal Rogers, a Republican from Kentucky, who has served in the House since 1981. The dean is a symbolic post, whose only customary duty is to swear in a speaker of the House after the speaker is elected. This responsibility was first recorded in 1819 but has not been observed continuously – at times, the speaker-elect was the current dean or the speaker-elect preferred to be sworn in by a member of their own party when the dean belonged to another party. The dean comes forward on the House Floor to administer the oath to the speaker-elect, before the new speaker then administers the oath to the other members.

While deans perform the swearing-in ceremony for the newly elected speaker, they do not preside over the election of a speaker, as do the Father of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom and the dean of the Canadian House of Commons (that duty falls to the previous House&#x27;s Clerk).

Because of other privileges associated with seniority, the dean is usually allotted some of the most desirable office space, and is generally either chair or ranking minority member of an influential committee.

It is unclear when the position first achieved concrete recognition, though the seniority system and increasing lengths of service emerged in the early 20th century. As late as 1924, Frederick H. Gillett was dean, and also speaker, before becoming a senator. Modern deans move into their positions so late in their careers that a move to the Senate is highly unlikely. When Ed Markey broke Gillett&#x27;s record for time in the House before moving to the Senate in 2013 he was still decades junior to the sitting dean.

The deanship can change hands unexpectedly. In the 1952 election, Adolph J. Sabath became the first Representative elected to a 24th term, breaking the record of 23 terms first set by former Speaker Joseph Gurney Cannon, whose service had been non-consecutive, whereas Sabath&#x27;s was not. North Carolina&#x27;s Robert L. Doughton had not contested that election as he was retiring at the age of 89 years and two months, a House age record broken in 1998 by Sidney R. Yates, and again by Ralph Hall in 2012. However, Sabath died before the new term began and Doughton was dean for the old term&#x27;s final months before Speaker Sam Rayburn became dean in the new Congress.

==List of deans of the House==
Years as dean are followed by name, party, state, and start of service in Congress.

All the members of the First Congress had equal seniority (as defined for the purpose of this article), but Muhlenberg, as the speaker, was the first member to be sworn in. Muhlenberg, Hartley and Thatcher were among the 13 members who attended the initial meeting of the House on March 4, 1789.

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, some state delegations to the House were often not elected until after the term had begun. To avoid confusion, this fact is ignored in the list below.

<doc id="576968" wikidata="Q540787" url="?curid=576968" title="Warren Ellis">
<text>Warren Girard Ellis (born 16 February 1968) is an English comic book writer, novelist, and screenwriter. He is best known as the co-creator of several original comics series, including &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot; (1997–2002), &quot;Global Frequency&quot; (2002–2004) and &quot;Red&quot; (2003–2004), which was adapted into the feature films &quot;Red&quot; (2010) and &quot;Red 2&quot; (2013). Ellis is the author of the novels &quot;Crooked Little Vein&quot; (2007) and &quot;Gun Machine&quot; (2013) and the novella &quot;Normal&quot; (2016).

A prolific comic book writer, Ellis has written several Marvel series, including &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;, &quot;Thunderbolts&quot;, &quot;Moon Knight&quot; and the &quot;Extremis&quot; story arc of &quot;Iron Man&quot;, which was the basis for the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Iron Man 3&quot; (2013). Ellis created &quot;The Authority&quot; and &quot;Planetary&quot; for WildStorm, and wrote a run of &quot;Hellblazer&quot; for Vertigo and &quot;James Bond&quot; for Dynamite Entertainment. Ellis wrote the video games &quot;Hostile Waters&quot; (2001), &quot;Cold Winter&quot; (2005), and &quot;Dead Space&quot; (2008). He also wrote the animated TV movie &quot;G.I. Joe: Resolute&quot; (2009), wrote the English version of &quot;Marvel Anime&quot; (2010–2011), and served as the head writer on the acclaimed animated Netflix series &quot;Castlevania&quot; (2017–2021).

Ellis is well known for sociocultural commentary, both through his online presence and through his writing, which covers transhumanist (most notably nanotechnology, cryonics, mind transfer and human enhancement) and folkloric themes, often in combination with each other. He is a humanist and former patron of Humanists UK, a charity focused on promoting humanism and advancing secularism. He is a resident of Southend-on-Sea, England.

==Early life==
Ellis was born in Essex in February 1968. He has stated that the televised broadcast of the Moon landing is his earliest coherent memory. He was a student at the South East Essex Sixth Form College, commonly known as SEEVIC. He contributed comic work to the college magazine &quot;Spike&quot; along with Richard Easter, who also later followed a career in writing.

Before starting his career as a writer, he worked in a book and stationery store, a pub, in bankruptcy, in a record shop, and lifted compost bags.

==Career==

===Early career===
Ellis&#x27;s writing career started in the British roleplaying magazine &#x27;Adventurer&#x27; for which he wrote the 1920s &quot;Cthulhu mythos&quot; strip &#x27;Whiplash&#x27; throughout 1986. This was followed by a six-page short story published in 1990 in independent magazine &quot;Deadline&quot;. Other early works include a Judge Dredd short and a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; one-pager. His first ongoing work, &quot;Lazarus Churchyard&quot; with D&#x27;Israeli, appeared in &quot;Blast!&quot;, a short-lived British magazine.

By 1994, Ellis had begun working for Marvel Comics, where he took over the series &quot;&quot; with issue number 12, which he wrote until its cancellation after issue number 21. He also wrote for the Marvel 2099 imprint, most notably in a storyline in which a futuristic Doctor Doom took over the United States. Other notable early Marvel work is a run on &quot;Excalibur&quot;, a superhero series set in Britain. He also wrote a four-issue arc of &quot;Thor&quot; called &quot;Worldengine&quot;, in which he dramatically revamped both the character and book (though the changes lasted only as long as Ellis&#x27;s run), and wrote&quot; Wolverine&quot; with artist Leinil Francis Yu.
=== &quot;The Authority&quot;, &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot; and critical acclaim ===
Ellis then started working for DC Comics, Caliber Comics and Image Comics&#x27; Wildstorm studio, where he wrote the &quot;Gen13&quot; spin-off &quot;DV8&quot; and took over &quot;Stormwatch&quot;, a previously action-oriented team book, to which he gave a more idea- and character-driven flavor. He wrote issues 37–50 with artist Tom Raney, and the 11 issues of volume two with artists Oscar Jimenez and Bryan Hitch. Hitch and he followed that with the &quot;Stormwatch&quot; spin-off &quot;The Authority&quot;, a cinematic super-action series for which Ellis coined the term &quot;widescreen comics&quot;.

In 1997, Ellis started &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot;, a creator-owned series about an acerbic &quot;gonzo&quot; journalist in a dystopian future America, co-created with artist Darick Robertson and published by DC&#x27;s Helix imprint. When Helix was discontinued the following year, &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot; was shifted to the Vertigo imprint, and remained one of the most successful nonsuperhero comics DC was then publishing. &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot; ran for 60 issues (plus a few specials), ending in 2002, and the entire run was later collected in a series of trade paperbacks. It remains Ellis&#x27;s largest work to date.

&quot;Planetary&quot;, another Wildstorm series by Ellis and John Cassaday, launched in 1999, as did Ellis&#x27;s short run on the DC/Vertigo series &quot;Hellblazer&quot;. He left that series when DC announced, following the Columbine High School massacre, that it would not publish &quot;Shoot&quot;, a &quot;Hellblazer&quot; story about school shootings, although the story had been written and illustrated prior to the Columbine massacre. &quot;Planetary&quot; concluded in October 2009 with issue 27.

===Return to superhero titles===
Ellis returned to Marvel Comics as part of the company&#x27;s &quot;Revolution&quot; event, to head the &quot;Counter-X&quot; line of titles. This project was intended to revitalise the X-Men spin-off books &quot;Generation X&quot;, &quot;X-Man,&quot; and &quot;X-Force&quot;, but it was not successful and Ellis stayed away from mainstream superhero comics for a time.

In 2002, Ellis started &quot;Global Frequency&quot;, a 12-issue limited series for Wildstorm, and continued to produce work for various publishers, including DC, Avatar Press, AiT/Planet Lar, Cliffhanger and Homage Comics.

In 2004, Ellis came back to mainstream superhero comics. He took over &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four&quot; and &quot;Iron Man&quot; for Marvel under a temporary exclusive work for hire contract.

Toward the end of 2004, Ellis released the &quot;Apparat Singles Group&quot;, which he described as &quot;An imaginary line of comics singles. Four imaginary first issues of imaginary series from an imaginary line of comics, even&quot;. The Apparat titles were published by Avatar, but carried only the Apparat logo on their covers.

In 2006, Ellis worked for DC on &quot;Jack Cross&quot;, which was not well received and was subsequently cancelled. For Marvel, he worked on &quot;Nextwave&quot;, a 12-issue limited series. He also worked on the Ultimate Galactus trilogy. Ellis also took over the &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; monthly title, which deals with the aftermath of the Marvel Civil War crossover.

In honour of the 20th anniversary of Marvel&#x27;s New Universe in 2006, Ellis and illustrator Salvador Larroca created a new series that reimagines the New Universe under the title &quot;newuniversal&quot;. The first issue was released on 6 December 2006.

Ellis continued to work on several projects for different publishers, including &quot;Desolation Jones&quot; (for DC/Wildstorm) and &quot;Blackgas&quot; and &quot;Black Summer&quot; (for Avatar Press). Ellis also wrote an episode of &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; entitled &quot;Dark Heart&quot;.

===2007–2012===
Ellis&#x27;s first prose novel, &quot;Crooked Little Vein&quot;, was published in mid-2007 by William Morrow (an imprint of HarperCollins).

Ellis has described himself as &quot;a notorious pain in the arse for getting involved in book design&quot;. According to a comment made in the first issue of &quot;Fell&quot;, he has more trade paperbacks in print than anyone else in the American comic industry.

On 29 July 2007, Ellis announced two new projects for Avatar Press: &quot;FreakAngels&quot;, a free long-form webcomic illustrated by Paul Duffield, and &quot;Ignition City&quot;, a five-issue miniseries. He also has five other current series with Avatar: &quot;Anna Mercury&quot;, &quot;No Hero&quot;, along with two long series &quot;Doktor Sleepless&quot; and Gravel.

The first quarter of 2009 had the release of &quot;G.I. Joe: Resolute&quot;, a series of webisodes written by Warren Ellis and later released on DVD in December.

He worked with D&#x27;Israeli again in 2010–2011 for a one-off comic, &quot;SVK&quot;, to be published by BERG, a London consultancy firm. It uses a UV torch to reveal the thoughts of the characters in the story.

In 2010, a documentary film on Ellis, &quot;Warren Ellis: Captured Ghosts&quot;, was announced for 2011 completion. Its co-producer Sequart Organization also plans on publishing, in 2011, three books studying Ellis&#x27;s work: on &quot;Planetary&quot;, &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot; and Ellis&#x27;s overall career. Sequart has dubbed this push &quot;The Year of Ellis.&quot;

=== 2013–2015: &quot;Gun Machine&quot;, subsequent Marvel work and return to Image ===
Ellis&#x27;s second novel, hardboiled detective thriller &quot;Gun Machine&quot;, was released on 3 January 2013 by Mulholland Books. The novel follows a Manhattan detective investigating a murder, which expands into the hunt of a serial killer. &quot;Gun Machine&quot; hit &quot;The&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Sellers list and received mostly positive reviews. In June 2013, Ellis announced on his website that he would be ending his relationship with Mulholland Books due to &quot;continuing issues&quot; and cancelling the release of his short story &quot;Dead Pig Collector&quot;. In July 2013, &quot;Dead Pig Collector&quot; was picked up by Farrar, Straus and Giroux and published as a digital original.

In March 2014, Ellis relaunched &quot;Moon Knight&quot; for Marvel, with art by Declan Shalvey and colors by Jordie Bellaire. The series received critical acclaim and helped establish Moon Knight as a major character in the Marvel Universe. Ellis ended his run after six issues, after which the series was taken on by writer Brian Wood. &quot;Trees&quot;, a new creator-owned comics collaboration between Ellis and artist Jason Howard, debuted in May 2014 through Image Comics. The science fiction series explores a world in which aliens have invaded Earth, but completely ignored humans. The first story arc concluded in January 2015, and was followed by a second volume, &quot;Trees: Two Forests&quot;, which ended its run in August 2016&quot;.&quot; A third volume is planned.

Ellis joined main writer Kelly Sue DeConnick to co-write two issues of her &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; series in early 2015. In May 2015, Ellis reteamed with his &quot;Moon Knight&quot; collaborators Shalvey and Bellaire to publish &quot;Injection&quot; with Image Comics. The creator-owned science-fiction series follows the members of a think tank given the task of improving the future, who deal with mistakes made after trying to prevent human innovation from dying off. Three volumes of &quot;Injection&quot; have been released.

Ellis launched a new ongoing comics series featuring James Bond in November 2015, published by Dynamite Entertainment in partnership with Ian Fleming Publications and illustrated by Jason Masters. &quot;James Bond&quot; depicts the original character from the Ian Fleming novels, as opposed to the one in the films, but is set in present day. The first story arc, &quot;Vargr&quot;, was followed in June 2016 with a second arc titled &quot;Eidolon&quot;. Ellis stepped down from the series after 12 issues in December 2016 and was succeeded as writer by Benjamin Percy. As part of Marvel&#x27;s All-New All-Different relaunch, Ellis wrote the series &quot;Karnak&quot;, following the eponymous Inhuman character. The series debuted in October 2015 with art by Gerardo Zaffino to positive reviews. &quot;Karnak&quot; suffered several delays which resulted in Zaffino being replaced by Roland Boschi. The series ended its six-issue run in February 2017.

=== 2016–present: &quot;Normal&quot; and WildStorm revival ===
&quot;Normal&quot;, Ellis&#x27;s new novella, was serialized as four digital installments beginning in July 2016. It was published as a single volume by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in November 2016. The near-future thriller follows the residents of an asylum for futurists as they investigate a disappearance. The novella received a mostly positive reception, with reviewers praising its plot, humor and commentary on the future.

In October 2016, Ellis launched &quot;Shipwreck&quot;, a new six-issue comics miniseries with artist Phil Hester, published by AfterShock Comics. The series follows the survivor of a shipwreck trying to find out what happened after he washes up on another world. Though Ellis has left open the possibility of expanding the book past six issues, he said he is focused finishing the story as planned first.

Despite rarely returning to his early work, in October 2016, DC Comics announced a relaunch of the WildStorm publishing line as a new imprint curated by Ellis. Taking a similar approach to Gerard Way&#x27;s Young Animal imprint, DC asked Ellis to write a main series, titled &quot;The Wild Storm&quot;, and curating others set in the same universe. The series begins a complete reboot of the WildStorm Universe, with Ellis saying his goal is for the imprint to be new reader-friendly. &quot;The Wild Storm&quot; debuted in February 2017 with art by John Davis-Hunt. In his newsletter &quot;Orbital Operations&quot;, Ellis stated that he has a two-year plan for the series. Three more WildStorm series are expected to follow.

In 2017, Netflix launched a &quot;Castlevania&quot; animated television series adaptation, written and produced by Ellis. Ellis had been previously hired to write a screenplay for &quot;Castlevania: Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot;, an animated film based on &quot;Castlevania III: Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot;. The first season of the &quot;Castlevania&quot; TV series was released in 2017, and seasons 2 through 4 were released during the period of 2018 to 2021. Executive producer Adi Shankar confirmed that Ellis would be writing every episode.

=== Planned projects ===
In 2012, Ellis announced he would publish a nonfiction book, tentatively titled &quot;Spirit Tracks&quot;, with Farrar, Straus, and Giroux. The book is &quot;about the future of the city, the ghosts that haunt it and the science-fiction condition we live in.&quot; It is based on a talk Ellis gave in Berlin at a conference titled &quot;Cognitive Cities&quot;, which was based on a series of posts on his website. At Image Expo 2015, &quot;Heartless&quot;, a new creator-owned comic book with Ellis&#x27;s &quot;Supreme: Blue Rose&quot; collaborator Tula Lotay, was announced. , &quot;Heartless&quot; has yet to be released, though Ellis has commented in 2016 that Lotay and he are working on it at their &quot;own pace&quot;.

&quot;Finality&quot;, a new webcomic written by Ellis and illustrated by Colleen Doran, was announced in September 2016. Set to be published by Webtoon in 2017, the 26-issue weekly series follows a middle-aged female detective working a murder mystery.

In 2020, anime streaming platform Crunchyroll announced that it was adapting the webcomic &quot;FreakAngels&quot; as one of the first Crunchyroll Originals anime TV series.

==Unrealised projects==
In 2006, Ellis was hired to develop a science-fiction television series for AMC titled &quot;Dead Channel&quot;, but the project was put on hiatus. The series followed a television network executive who discovers the existence of aliens and decides to turn the discovery into a reality show. &quot;Listener&quot;, a near-future science fiction novel, was planned as Ellis&#x27;s next book after &quot;Crooked Little Vein.&quot; The novel has since been lost and cancelled.

&quot;Wastelanders&quot;, a web-based &quot;end-of-the-world&quot; collaboration with director Joss Whedon, was postponed due to Whedon&#x27;s work on &quot;The Avengers&quot;. Ellis and British producer Vivek Tiwary developed an adventure thriller television miniseries title &quot;Ascension&quot;, with Idris Elba in talks to star, though nothing has come of the project.

== Adaptations and nonfiction ==
=== Film and television adaptations ===
Adaptations of Ellis&#x27;s works have frequently been planned, to limited success. Ellis and Cully Hamner&#x27;s miniseries, &quot;Red&quot;, has been loosely adapted as two films: &quot;Red&quot; (2010) and &quot;Red 2&quot; (2013), written by Jon Hoeber and Erich Hoeber, produced by Lorenzo di Bonaventura and starring Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren. The sequel was simply inspired by the comics as no source material exists outside the original miniseries. The Hoebers were commissioned to write a third installment in 2013, though no further developments have occurred since. A television series based on the &quot;Red&quot; film franchise, produced by di Bonaventura and written the Hoeber brothers, was announced as in development in 2015. The &quot;Iron Man&quot; &quot;Extremis&quot; story arc written by Ellis was used as the primary influence on the plot of the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Iron Man 3&quot;, directed by Shane Black. Elements of &quot;Extremis&quot; were also used in the first &quot;Iron Man&quot; film.

&quot;Global Frequency&quot; has been at various stages of adaptation since its publication. A television pilot written by John Rogers was produced in 2005, but development ended after it was leaked. Several more attempts to bring the limited series to television include writers Scott Nimerfro in 2009, and Rockne S. O&#x27;Bannon in 2014, though none have materialized. &quot;Gravel&quot; was at one point being developed with Tim Miller attached as director, with Ellis commissioned to write the first draft of the screenplay and serving as executive producer. &quot;Black Summer&quot; has also been optioned as a feature film. Ellis&#x27;s comics collaboration with Chris Sprouse, &quot;Ocean&quot;, has been optioned, and Ryan Condal hired to write a screenplay. Ellis&#x27;s novel &quot;Gun Machine&quot; has been set up as a television series first with writer Dario Scardapane at Fox in 2012, and later in 2014 at the now-defunct Xbox Entertainment, with a script by Brett Conrad. In 2016, it was announced that NBCUniversal had optioned the rights to Ellis and Jason Howard&#x27;s &quot;Trees&quot; and would be developing it as a television series with Tom Hardy&#x27;s production company.

=== Talks and speaking engagements ===
In 2013, Ellis spoke at the HowTheLightGetsIn festival in Hay. In his first talk, titled Our Hopeless Future and Other Comedy, he discussed the power of Twitter and how it can &#x27;break&#x27; other people&#x27;s websites. In the second, Thinking Differently, he explored how the internet revolution is changing people&#x27;s lives and asked whether it is changing how people think. A festival regular, he has returned in subsequent years to debate the risks and rewards of artificial intelligence with physicist Stephen Hawking and collaborator Roger Penrose.

=== Nonfiction and email newsletters ===
Ellis is a contributor of nonfiction articles and columns to magazines and websites. He has been a columnist for SuicideGirls, &quot;Reuters&quot;, &quot;Vice&quot;, &quot;Wired UK&quot;, and &quot;Esquire&quot;. From 1995 to 1999, he wrote an email list titled &quot;From the Desk of&quot;, where he wrote about various subjects including the comic industry and his work. &quot;From the Desk of&quot; was collected in two print volumes by Avatar Press. When technical issues forced that list to shut down in 2001, Ellis started a new email list, &quot;Bad Signal&quot;, which was described as &quot;anarchy in your mailbox to brighten up your day&quot;. &quot;Bad Signal&quot; was replaced in 2012, two years after its closing, by &quot;Machine Vision&quot;; Ellis ended &quot;Machine Vision&quot; alongside his relationship with his publisher Mulholland Books a year later. Since 2013, Ellis has been writing the weekly email newsletter &quot;Orbital Operations&quot;, which features work updates and thoughts on books, comics and current events. As of late 2015, &quot;Orbital Operations&quot; had 13,000 subscribers.

In 2007, Ellis launched the now-defunct message board &quot;Whitechapel&quot; as a companion to his webcomic &quot;FreakAngels&quot;, though it rapidly evolved into his internet home. He is frequently referred to as &quot;The Boss&quot;, &quot;Stalin&quot;, &quot;The Love Swami&quot; or &quot;Internet Jesus&quot; on these forums. Ellis maintains a blog at his personal website, thought it is rarely updated. Beginning in 2014, he wrote regularly at &quot;Morning.Computer&quot;. In 2015, Ellis published &quot;Cunning Plans&quot;, an ebook collection of talks he gave at technology and futurism conferences.

==Sexual coercion allegations==
In June 2020, several people (including musician Meredith Yayanos, artist Zoetica Ebb, and photographer Jhayne Holmes) publicly accused Ellis of sexual coercion and manipulation, in having engaged in simultaneous relationships with several of them without the others&#x27; knowledge. &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; reported that &quot;by 19 June, over 60 women had joined a group organized by Holmes, all of them accusing Ellis of a largely consistent pattern of behavior&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; later reported that &quot;roughly 100 women have come forward, while 33 of them have composed written statements, supported by emails and text messages, which have been seen by &quot;The Guardian&quot;&quot;. These testimonials were posted together on a new website, SoManyofUs.com, in July 2020 and contain accounts of &quot;manipulation, gaslighting, coercion, and other forms of emotional abuse&quot;.

Ellis responded, writing that he had not considered that others would see him as having &quot;a position of power and privilege&quot;, and that &quot;I have hurt many people that I had no intention of hurting. I am culpable. I take responsibility for my mistakes. I will do better and for that, I apologize.&quot; DC Comics subsequently announced that, at Ellis&#x27;s request, a two-page story written by him would not be included in an upcoming anthology. Ellis ended his long-running email newsletter, which he had published under various titles since 1995.

In mid-July 2020, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported &quot;Ellis responded to these accounts with self-pity and what seemed to be genuine contrition. [...] Ellis insists that the problem was relationship trouble, &#x27;not predatory behaviour&#x27;, but concedes that &#x27;[t]here is a differing of perception here, and I&#x27;ve been listening to it&#x27;. He said he was going to try therapy on the advice of friends&quot;. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; later reported Ellis would not be returning to &quot;Castlevania&quot; for subsequent seasons and that a planned Batman comic would no longer be moving forward.

In June 2021, a week after Ben Templesmith announced that he would be reteaming with Ellis for new issues of &quot;Fell&quot;, Image Comics announced that they would not be publishing the series following negative reaction from within the industry.
An update on SoManyofUs.com informed that Ellis reached out to the collective which created the site. He wrote that he was made aware of the offer of a mediated dialogue and that he would be available to begin a conversation. After having closed his newsletter in June 2020, he used it again to inform his subscribers about this development.

In an update in January 2022, SoManyofUs.com reported that their members have been in a mediated dialogue with Ellis since August 2021 and that they were making progress in a guided transformative justice process. In February 2022, Ellis relaunched his newsletter, in which he linked to the SoManyofUs.com update and website. On January 19, 2023, SoManyOfUs.com once again updated the site, alleging that Ellis &quot;took none of the steps we hoped he would&quot;, stating &quot;we do not anticipate our involvement in any progress he might make in the future.&quot;

<text>Beat the Clock is an American television game show. Contestants attempted to complete challenges such as physical stunts within a time limit in order to win prizes. The show was a creation of Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions.

The show began on radio as &quot;Time&#x27;s A-Wastin&quot;&#x27; in 1948, hosted by Bud Collyer, and changed its name to &quot;Beat the Time&quot; on January 5, 1949. The show moved to television on the CBS nighttime schedule starting on March 23, 1950. On September 16, 1957, CBS premiered an afternoon version of the show as well, which ran for a year. The nighttime show was cancelled on February 16, 1958, and the afternoon program followed on September 12, 1958.

Soon, the show moved to ABC&#x27;s daytime schedule, and ran from October 13, 1958 to January 27, 1961. A brief revival aired on CBS from September 17, 1979 to February 1, 1980.

In 2006, the show made up the third segment of &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot;, a seven-part summer series that aired on CBS, with Ricki Lake as host and Rich Fields as announcer.

The most recent revival aired on Universal Kids from February 6, 2018 to July 8, 2019.

== 1950–1961 ==
The first edition of &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; was a production of CBS and aired there until 1958. The show then moved to American Broadcasting Company where it stayed until 1961. Bud Collyer emceed the original series.

Contestants were required to perform tasks (called &quot;problems&quot; by Collyer) within a certain time limit which was counted down on a large 60-second clock. If they succeeded, they were said to have &quot;beaten the clock&quot;—otherwise, &quot;the clock beat them&quot;. The show had several sponsors over its run, with the most longstanding being the electronics company Sylvania.

=== On-air personalities ===
Substitute hosts on the original version included Bill Hart (1951), John Reed King (1952), stunt creator Frank Wayne (1953), Bob Kennedy (1954), Win Elliot (1955), and Sonny Fox, who became Collyer&#x27;s permanent substitute from 1957 to 1960. Collyer was referred to in the introductions as &quot;America&#x27;s number one clockwatcher&quot;, and the fill-in hosts were each named &quot;America&#x27;s number two clockwatcher&quot;.

The show had several female on-air assistants. The original hostess was Roxanne (née Delores Evelyn Rosedale). Roxanne was replaced by Beverly Bentley in August 1955. Bentley&#x27;s departure in 1956 coincided with Hazel Bishop&#x27;s sponsorship and a period of having no main assistant (see production changes below). She reappeared as one of the models on the original version of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; for its entire run.

The announcer for the show&#x27;s run on CBS was Bernard (&quot;Bern&quot;) Bennett until 1958. In October 1957, &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; ran a contest inviting viewers to submit drawings of what Bennett, who was never shown on camera, might look like. Over 20,000 viewers participated, and winner Edward Darnell, of Columbus, Indiana, was flown in to appear with Bennett on the December 2, 1957, show. When &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; moved to ABC, Dirk Fredericks became the announcer. Substitute announcers included Lee Vines, Bob Sheppard, Hal Simms, and Dick Noel.

=== Contestants ===
Contestants were chosen from the studio audience and usually were married couples. Other pairs were engaged, dating, or had a familial relationship. Collyer would ask them general questions (usually including where they were from and how long they&#x27;d been married) and usually asked if they had children, their ages and genders. Sometimes the couple would bring children on the show. Collyer usually would talk to the children, asking them what they wanted to be when they grew up, or, if the kids were not at the show, to have their parents wave to them on TV. The husbands on the show usually wore a business suit. Collyer would often ask the husband to take off his coat for stunts to make it less cumbersome (there were hooks on the contestants&#x27; podium) or Collyer would hold the coat.

Occasionally, if there was going to be a messy stunt, the husband would come out dressed in a plastic jumpsuit. Similarly, wives would sometimes play in their &quot;street clothes&quot;, but sometimes the women would appear in a jumpsuit because their own clothing might be too cumbersome or perhaps fragile. The women&#x27;s jumpsuits, unlike the men&#x27;s, which were rather plain, were patterned to look like a pair of overalls with a collared blouse underneath. The women would also often be issued running shoes instead of their own high heels.

=== Game format ===

==== Main Game ====
One couple competed against the clock to win a prize in stunts that required one or both members of the couple. The stunt was described and the time limit was set on a giant onstage clock. The time limit was always a multiple of 5 seconds, usually at least 30 seconds. At one point Collyer said that a 55-second time limit was the maximum, but later on, stunts occasionally had 60-second limits. On the primetime edition, the first stunt was called the $100 clock. If the couple beat the $100 clock, they moved on to the $200 clock and the same rules applied. If they failed to beat the $100 clock, they received a consolation prize worth less than $100. If they failed to beat the $200 clock, they got a prize worth more than $100. On the daytime versions, couples continued playing as long as they kept beating the clock, with various prizes awarded for each victory.

==== Jackpot Clock ====
On the primetime version, if the couple beat the $200 clock, the wife would play the jackpot clock in which the words of a famous saying or quote were scrambled up on a magnetic board and that phrase had to be unscrambled in 20 seconds or less. If successful, then the couple won the Jackpot Prize. If not, they got a prize worth more than $200. Occasionally, when the wife of the couple did not speak English very well, the husband was allowed to perform the jackpot clock.

The jackpot clock and the Bonus Stunt would provide the templates for the traditional quiz show bonus round, which would become a TV staple, starting in 1950 with the bonus question round on &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;.

In the show&#x27;s earliest set design in available episodes, there was a round display near the contestants mirroring the clock. This display had three rings of light like a target. The outer ring would light during the $100 clock, the middle ring for the $200 clock, and the center circle would light during the jackpot clock. This feature was removed in later set designs.

==== Bonus Stunt ====
Some time during every episode (between normal stunts), a bell would sound. The couple playing at the time would attempt the Bonus Stunt for the Bonus Prize that started at $100 in cash. If the stunt was not beaten, it would be attempted the next week with $100 added to the prize. When it was beaten, it was retired from the show and a new Bonus Stunt began the next week at $100. The bonus (as the name suggests) did not affect the regular game, and win or lose the couple continued the regular clocks wherever they left off. Beginning in August 1954, the starting amount for each Bonus Stunt was raised to $500, still increasing $100 each week.

Bonus Stunts were harder than the usual $100 and $200 clocks and sometimes reached $2,000 and even $3,000 on rare occasions. The first time the Bonus reached $1,000 was on February 28, 1953, when it was won for that amount. In 1956, the Bonus Stunt was replaced by the Super Bonus.

There was usually a special technique for performing the stunt that had to be figured out, but even then, the stunt was usually difficult enough to require some skill or luck once the technique was realized. Viewers would usually try to figure it out and after a few weeks on the air viewers would often get it (sometimes Collyer would remark that viewers had been writing in and he would give certain dimensions of the props used so viewers could try to figure it out at home).

Usually either contestants themselves would start appearing on the show with the technique in mind, or audience members would shout it out to try to help them. A stunt would usually take a few weeks before the audience realized the technique, and then a few more weeks before someone was able to properly employ it.

==== Super Bonus Stunt ====
In response to the big money prizes on other networks&#x27; game shows, CBS talked Mark Goodson into increasing the stakes on &quot;Beat The Clock&quot;. Ultimately the plan was unsuccessful as the ratings never did improve much, perhaps leading to the end of the Super Bonus. Starting on February 25, 1956, after the last regular Bonus Stunt had been won, it was replaced by the super bonus which started at $10,000 and went up by $1,000 every time a couple failed to beat the clock. Unlike with the regular bonus stunt and the &quot;Big Cash Bonus Stunt&quot; that followed it, the Super Bonus was attempted by every couple who qualified by beating the $200 clock. Originally the stunt was played at the end of the show by each couple that qualified, and &quot;because of the high prize value&quot; a special timing machine made by the Longines company was used, which was touted as the most accurate portable timer available. Probably realizing that seeing the same stunt a few times in a row was a bit boring, they moved the Super Bonus right after the $200 clock and before the jackpot clock on March 17, dropping the Longines clock.

Partway through the run of the second Super Bonus, a rolling desk/table with dollar value of the bonus printed on it was used to roll out the props for the stunt. This carried over to the Big Cash Bonus Stunt. It is notable that in the earliest surviving episodes from 1952 that air, the original bonus had a similar desk with the value of the bonus on it. The desk was done away with for several years until the idea was reused in 1956.

==== Big Cash Bonus Stunt ====
Starting on September 22, 1956, the bonus reverted to the original Bonus Stunt format (attempted once per episode by whatever couple heard the &quot;bonus bell&quot; ringing). The Jackpot started at $5,000 and increased $1,000 every week it was not won. If successful, the couple left the show with the top prize. Otherwise, they continued on with the regular game.

==== Bonus Cash and Prize Stunt ====
Featured on the daytime version. A lucky couple had a chance to win a bundle of cash and their choice of a new car or boat. To win, they had to successfully complete their Bonus Stunt. Like the original Bonus Stunt, the cash value started at $100, going up each time the stunt was not successfully completed. The largest cash bonus won on the daytime edition was $20,100 during its years on ABC, setting a record for daytime TV winnings in the post-scandal era.

=== Stunts ===
The stunts performed on the show were mostly created by staff stunt writers Frank Wayne and Bob Howard. In the early days of the show, playwright Neil Simon was also a stunt writer. The stunts were usually aimed towards fun with difficulty being secondary. The stunts would usually be constructed out of common household props such as cardboard boxes, string, balloons, record players, dishes, cups, plates, cutlery, and balls of almost every type. As was the case with many other game shows during television&#x27;s infancy, the budget was low. Each stunt had to be thoroughly tested before it could be used on the show.

The stunts performed varied widely, but there were some common themes. Most stunts in some way involved physical speed or dexterity. Contestants often had to balance something with some part of their body, or race back and forth on the stage (for example, releasing a balloon, running across the stage to do some task, and running back in time to catch the balloon before it floated too high). Often the challenge was some form of target practice, in terms of throwing, rolling, bowling, etc.

The setup for the stunt was often designed to look easy but then have a complication or gimmick revealed. For example, Collyer would say &quot;All you have to do is stack four plates&quot;, check the clock to see how much time they had to do it, and then add &quot;Oh, and one more thing...you can&#x27;t use your hands&quot;. Common twists included blindfolding one or both contestants, or telling them they could not use their hands (or feet or any body part that would be obvious to use for whatever the task was).

The other common element in the stunts was to get one of the contestants messy in some way often involving whipped cream, pancake batter, and such (usually limited to the husband of the couple). While it was not a part of every stunt, and sometimes it didn&#x27;t even happen in an episode, it was common enough that when a couple brought a child on, Collyer would often ask what they thought the parents might have to do and the child would often respond &quot;get whipped cream in their face&quot;. Many times the wife would be shown a task, be blindfolded, and then her husband would be quietly brought out and unknown to her she would be covering him with some sort of mess. When the mess was not hidden from the wife, Collyer would often jokingly tell the husband (who usually had a short haircut) that they would put a bathing cap on his head &quot;to keep your long hair out of your eyes&quot; before revealing what form of mess he would be involved with. Occasionally Collyer himself would get caught in the mess accidentally.

Technicality in the rules was not a major issue on the show. The goal was usually to make sure the contestants had fun. Collyer would often stop the clock in the middle of a stunt if the contestant(s) was struggling so he advised them on a better way to do the stunt. Often if a condition of the stunt was &quot;don&#x27;t use your hands,&quot; Collyer would ignore the first use of hands and just warn the contestant. If the time limit was nearly up on a task, he would often give them a few moments extra, or tell them if they started before the clock ran out and succeeded in that attempt, he would count it. Sometimes if a contestant had come close enough (for example, if they had to stack cups and saucers without the pile falling over, and the contestant knocked the pile over while putting the last cup on top), he would give them the stunt if they did not have time to do it again. If there was a problem with a prop breaking or running out of a supply, such as balloons, Collyer would simply give the stunt to the couple, citing it as the show&#x27;s fault. Similarly, on the messy stunts, since the goal was just to mess up the husband, the time limit was often unimportant and the clock would be stopped when Bud felt the husband was messy enough.

=== Prizes ===
Prizes varied depending on the era of the show and the sponsor at the time. During Sylvania&#x27;s tenure as sponsor (which began in March 1951), consolation prizes for losing the $100 clock were usually a Sylvania radio.
* $100 clock prizes included Michael C. Fina silverware sets, a collection of four Knapp-Monarch small kitchen appliances, or a Hoover upright, among others.
* $200 clock prizes included International-Harvester refrigerators, air conditioning units (usually in the summer), a Tappan range/oven, a James dishwasher, Speed Queen washers and dryers (they were only offered separately) and small Sylvania TVs. All of these prizes, except the Sylvania radio, were shown on &quot;art cards&quot; and not actually brought out on the show.
* The Jackpot Prize during Sylvania&#x27;s tenure was always a Sylvania television set. Sometimes a hi-fi stereo/phonograph (with &quot;famous surround sound&quot;) was included with the television, and it was noted that the Jackpot Prize was &quot;worth more than $500&quot;. A notable (and often pointed out) feature of Sylvania&#x27;s TVs at the time was the &quot;halo light&quot;, which was an illuminated &quot;frame&quot; around the image which was supposed to have made watching the image easier on the eyes, similar to the &quot;AmbiLight&quot; feature on some modern television sets.

The sets, as was the style at the time, were freestanding pieces of furniture that sat on legs on the floor with a speaker mounted below the screen. Various models were given away over the years—sometimes the same model several times in one episode, sometimes a different model each time the Jackpot was won in an episode. Roxanne (later Beverly) would pose with the TV which was revealed from behind a curtain in a small faux living room.

There were also various gifts given to the contestants just for appearing on the show. There was a Sylvania &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; home game produced which was given to contestants starting in the mid-50s. When it was novel, Collyer would open the box and explain that it would be fun for not just children but adults at parties, and he would point out the working clock and the instructions for stunts and all the props. Later in the run it would be brought out, shown and whisked away just as quickly. The boxes were reworked a few times, and there was a new edition released later in the run. Both versions were manufactured by Lowell Toy Mfg. Co. of New York, who produced a number of television-based home games at the time.

When children were brought on the show, there were special gifts. Starting on September 6, 1952, girls brought on the show were given a Roxanne doll that was produced at the time. On October 11, 1952, the Buck Rogers Space Ranger Kit was debuted for boys. In the mid-50s, each child was given a camera kit.

If contestants were involved in a messy stunt, Roxanne (later Beverly) would come out and take a picture. Initially it wasn&#x27;t made clear how the couple would get the photo (perhaps mailed to them), but later in the run, the camera would be given to the couple in addition to any their children might already have been given. Collyer would explain that when they developed the film, the first photo would be that of the husband/couple.

From 1956 and for the rest of the show&#x27;s run on CBS, the Jackpot Prizes usually consisted of a Magnavox Color TV, Fedders air conditioners (usually awarded as a pair), Westinghouse washer and dryer pairs, and refrigerators, Hardwick ranges, Whirlpool freezers, and Easy &quot;Combomatic&quot; combination washer-dryers.

== 1969–1974 ==
On September 15, 1969, &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; returned to television in five-day-a-week syndication. This series continued to air until September 20, 1974. For the first season (1969–1970), the show was taped at The Little Theatre on Broadway in New York City, sharing the stage with &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; and &quot;The David Frost Show&quot;. After that, taping moved to Montreal, Quebec as a cost-saving measure. This was the only time Goodson-Todman taped a series in Canada that was not for a Canadian-specific audience. The show was broadcast by CTV in Canada.

Jack Narz hosted the first three seasons of the series before leaving and his announcer, Gene Wood, replaced him for the remainder of the run.

The music for this version of &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; was played live on the organ by keyboardist and arranger Dick Hyman.

=== Jack Narz (1969–1972) ===
In early episodes, couples, now aided by a weekly celebrity guest, played for points simply by completing stunts. The first couple to reach 100 points won a prize package. This was subsequently changed to the couples receiving a prize every time they won, which was later replaced by the winning couple facing a &quot;cash board&quot; with &quot;BEAT THE CLOCK&quot; spelled out on three levels, each letter concealing a money amount: either $25 (4), $50 (5), $100 (2), or $200. The couple would agree on a letter, select it, and the winnings would be revealed.

In addition, if a couple completed a stunt in less than half the time, the remaining time would be used for awarding a cash bonus. Anywhere from $10 to $50 would be awarded for each time the stunt was completed in the time remaining.

At some point during the show, the celebrity would perform a &quot;Solo Stunt&quot; (which seemed to have supplanted the Bonus Stunt on the original show). The couples won $50 if they guessed correctly whether the star could beat the clock or vice versa. Towards the end of Narz&#x27;s tenure as host, stunts would be replaced in the second half of the show with the celebrity playing a game of intuition with the couples, who would play for a cash prize that was divided among them.

During this time, the show was syndicated through 20th Century Fox Television. One curious aspect of this version of the show was that Narz&#x27;s suit jackets sported an embroidered patch of the show&#x27;s &quot;Beat The Clock&quot; logo sewn onto the left breast. This practice was similar to hosts Jim Lange and Bob Eubanks&#x27; wearing logo patches from &quot;The Dating Game&quot; and &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; respectively, and also the scrambled &quot;mystery logo&quot; seen on Hugh Downs&#x27; (and later Bob Clayton&#x27;s) blazer when they hosted &quot;Concentration&quot;.

=== Gene Wood (1972–1974) ===
Jack Narz left the show in 1972. At the time, he made no announcement and gave no reason for his departure. In a 2007 Internet radio interview, Narz finally explained that the show&#x27;s budget did not include his personal travel expenses. Narz had to pay for his travel, and the cost of airline fare between his Los Angeles home and Montreal became prohibitive. His travel costs were essentially equal to his earnings, and even a successful appeal to Mark Goodson for more money was not enough.

Announcer Gene Wood hosted the show for the next two seasons. Wood had also been hosting a similar stunt game titled &quot;Anything You Can Do&quot;, a battle of the sexes competition which was also recorded in Canada. CFCF-TV Montreal staff announcer Nick Hollinrake became the show&#x27;s announcer (he had previously announced for a week during Narz&#x27;s final season in which Wood was the celebrity guest). At this time, the show also changed syndicators to Firestone Syndication Services, which syndicated another Goodson-Todman show, &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, which had originally been hosted by Bud Collyer.

The show was now called &quot;The New Beat the Clock&quot; (although the logo still read simply &quot;Beat the Clock&quot;), and the set was refreshed with a new color scheme and a redesigned clock. Like his predecessor, Wood also wore suit jackets with the show&#x27;s logo sewn on the pockets.

The only changes in the format were that couples were introduced separately and played two stunts, win or lose (a win still getting a trip to the Cash Board), and both couples competed simultaneously in a final stunt, with the winning couple receiving a prize. Celebrity guests were retained in the new format, once again aiding the contestants, and performing the Solo Stunt as well as &quot;co-judge&quot; with Wood in the final stunt of the day. Another throwback to the Collyer era (when the show was seen in the daytime) was the revival of &quot;Ladies&#x27; Day&quot;, where women only (not counting the celebrity for that week) would play the game.

Despite continued popularity on local stations in both daytime and prime time access timeslots, Goodson-Todman decided to discontinue production of &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; in 1974 when the Canadian government asked the company for half of the proceeds from advertisers awarding their wares as contestant consolation prizes. Wood returned to voice-over work, and went on to a 20-year career announcing Los Angeles-based shows for Goodson-Todman and occasionally other packagers.

== 1979–1980 ==
In 1979, CBS elected to bring the series back as &quot;All-New Beat the Clock&quot; for its daytime schedule. Production moved to CBS Television City, taping in Studio 31 and marking the first time a &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; series originated from Los Angeles. The series premiered on September 17, 1979, at 10:00a.m., replacing reruns of &quot;All in the Family&quot; in the time period, preceding &quot;Whew!&quot;. Monty Hall, who had not hosted a game show his company did not produce since he was host of Heatter-Quigley&#x27;s &quot;Video Village&quot;, was the emcee for the series while former host of the 1970s syndicated series, Jack Narz, served as his announcer and a series producer. The show faced competition from NBC&#x27;s &quot;Card Sharks&quot;. (ABC did not start programming until 11:00a.m.)

There were two theme songs used (both composed by Score Productions). The second one was performed live in the studio by a small band led by Arthur B. Rubinstein.

Two couples, one usually a returning champion, competed against each other and the clock. The champion couple (or champion-designate if the previous episode had ended with a retiring champion couple) wore red sweaters while the opposing couple wore green.

=== Rounds 1 and 2 ===
The first two rounds began with the couples competing against each other in a stunt worth $500 for the winner. One stunt usually featured the women of the couples, while the other featured the men, though the other partner sometimes had to help as well. The stunts were conducted for 60 seconds and were either races against the clock to perform an objective or competitions to outscore the opponent in the stunt before the clock ran out. In the former case, the clock was run as a fail safe, and if neither couple managed to complete the stunt, the team furthest along won.

Hall would then bring the winning couple across the stage to compete in a stunt by themselves for an additional $500. After Hall described the stunt and what both partners had to do, the clock was set and the couple had to complete the stunt in the allotted time. Doing so won the $500, but failure to do so did not.

=== Bonus Shuffle ===
After the first two rounds, both teams squared off in a modified table shuffleboard game called the &quot;Bonus Shuffle&quot;.

The teams took turns throwing pucks down the shuffleboard table. The team leading had the advantage of throwing three pucks and going first, followed by the other team with two pucks. If there was a tie, a coin was tossed with the winners going first and there were two pucks per side. The table had eight stripes on it, and each stripe had a higher dollar amount on it. The first stripe was worth $300 and each subsequent stripe was worth $100 more, with the stripe at the very end of the table worth $1,000. There was just enough space in between the stripes where a puck could land and not score any money. Pucks had to remain on the table to count, and if a puck failed to reach the first stripe it was taken off the board and discarded. The teams were allowed to try to knock each other&#x27;s pucks off the board if they so desired but did so at their own risk, as they could just as easily knock their own puck off the board or push a puck up the board and onto a higher value.

The team whose puck was furthest along on the board after all pucks had been thrown won the money attached to the space their puck was touching and became the day&#x27;s champions. They then moved on to play the Bonus Stunt for ten times the amount of their Bonus Shuffle total. In the event of a tie, each team threw one puck. The first puck&#x27;s landing spot was marked and the other team had to beat the mark to win.

=== Bonus Stunt ===
The Bonus Stunt round was conducted the same way as the solo stunts were. Hall would give the objective of the Bonus Stunt to the champion couple, then the clock would be set and the couple had to complete the stunt before time ran out. If they did so, as previously mentioned, they won ten times their Bonus Shuffle score for a maximum of $10,000 and a new Bonus Stunt would be played on the next show. If a Bonus Stunt was played five consecutive times without a couple managing to complete it, the stunt would be replaced with a new one.

Couples continued to appear until they were either defeated or surpassed $25,000 in total winnings.

=== &quot;The All-New All-Star Beat The Clock&quot; ===
On November 5, 1979, the show switched to an all-celebrity format. The changes that were made included:
* Celebrity pairs played for designated rooting sections (&quot;a la Tattletales,&quot; another Goodson-Todman game of the 1970s) of the audience which split the winnings.
* Both rooting sections could be seen on-camera.
* Stunts in the first two rounds were only worth $250 for the rooting sections.
* If the winning team completed the bonus stunt, $1,000 went to their rooting section while the remaining money went to their favorite charity.
* Both star teams remained on the show for a week. The pairings stayed the same on four of the five days, with the teams changing colors (the red team on Monday and Thursday was the green team on Tuesday and Friday). On Wednesdays, the teams switched, although still one man and one woman per team.
* In case of a tie going into the Bonus Shuffle, a coin toss determined who went first.
* In the last two weeks of the run, after each head-to-head stunt, both teams got to perform the next stunt, with the losing team from the previous stunt going first. If both teams performed this stunt within the time limit, whoever finished faster received the $250.
* The theme song was now an upbeat version of the first one used in its run (it was previously used going into and out of the commercials of the earlier episodes), and was performed live in the studio.

== 2002–2003 ==
This version, the show&#x27;s previous appearance other than the &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot; special, aired daily from September 2, 2002, to September 4, 2003, on PAX TV (the first week of shows was called a &quot;preview week&quot;). Taped in Universal Studios Florida, three couples competed in this version with no returning champions. The couples were distinguished by color—red, blue, and gold.

=== Round 1 ===
To start the game, all three couples faced off in a stunt. The first couple to complete the stunt got 10 points and the advantage of having to play a 30-second solo stunt first, as well as the ability to assign the stunts to the other teams—prior to gameplay the couple was shown 3 items on a tray that represented the stunts themselves, picked one for themselves to play, and divided the other two among the remaining players.

Before the playing of each stunt, a two-part trivia question was asked. Answering it correctly gave the team 10 extra seconds to complete the stunt and both parts had to be answered correctly, one by each player, in order to get those 10 seconds. 10 points were given for completing the stunt with one additional point for each second remaining on the clock (for example, if a couple completed a stunt with three seconds remaining, they scored 13 points for the round).

=== Round 2 ===
The second round consisted of two parts. The first part was another face-off stunt, i.e. trying to throw a ring around a pole the other player is wearing on their head. In a stunt like this, the first place couple&#x27;s ring tosser would be closest to their partner, the second place couple would be slightly further back, and the third place couple would be the furthest back (the first place couple was always given an advantage, with the second having less of one and the third the least). Play continued until two of the couples completed the stunt, with those two teams continuing on.

The two remaining couples were then shown the stunt they would have to attempt. After the stunt was described, another trivia question was asked. In this case, the female half of the couple was given the option to answer it, have her partner answer it, or pass it to the other team to make them answer. If the couple answered correctly they would be given control, but if they did not the opponents did. The two couples then bid down from a base time of two minutes to see who could complete the stunt in the fastest amount of time, and bidding continued until one team challenged the other to beat the clock. The stunt was then played, and if the challenged couple completed it they won the game and advanced to the bonus game. If they were not successful, the challenging couple won the game.

=== Bonus Round (&quot;The Swirling Whirlwind of Cash and Prizes&quot;) ===
The winning couple played the &quot;Swirling Whirlwind of Cash and Prizes&quot;, which took place inside a machine similar to a vertical wind tunnel. $25,000 in cash was inside the machine, as well as several &quot;prize vouchers&quot; (coloured slips of paper with the names of prizes written on them). Several more vouchers would be tossed into the machine prior to the start of the round.

Once inside the machine, both players tried to grab as much money and prize vouchers as they could within a 1-minute time limit. For protection, the couple was equipped with goggles and gloves that they wore while in the machine. There were three rules that had to be followed at all times. One, only items that were in the air could be grabbed and neither teammate could bend over and pick anything up from the ground; however, if any vouchers or cash had somehow gotten stuck in a pile they were permitted to kick the pile to get it loose. Two, each item that they grabbed had to be placed in a bag which the male partner wore around his waist in order to be counted. Three, once the clock stopped the couple both had to stop whatever they were doing and raise their hands in the air. Later in the run, several gold certificates were added to the machine and if the couple picked one up, the cash they had grabbed would be doubled. (If the couple somehow picked up more than one, only one was counted.)

The &quot;swirling whirlwind&quot; was previously used in the bonus round of &quot;The Diamond Head Game&quot;, a show hosted by Bob Eubanks in 1975.

== 2018 ==
On October 12, 2017, Universal Kids announced that it had ordered a revival of &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; from FremantleMedia North America, which premiered on February 6, 2018. The new version (taped in Los Angeles, making it the second version taped there) features children and adults competing as teams and was hosted by Paul Costabile.

=== Game Format ===
Two teams of two kids or one kid and their adult relative, one dressed in purple and the other dressed in green, compete in a race against time filled with stunts &amp; challenges. There are three rounds of stunts.

The first round is worth $100/stunt and the second round is worth $150/stunt. The third and final round is a head-to-head challenge for $300 for a possible grand total of $550. Both teams get to keep the cash, but the team with the most money at the end of round three wins the game and goes on to try and Beat The Big Clock for over $2,000. In the event of a tie, whoever completes the task first, or does the most tasks within the time limit in the head-to-head wins. If neither teams complete the challenge and are still tied, whoever has the most money wins.

=== The Big Clock ===
The winning team has 60 seconds to complete one final four-part stunt. Each part completed is worth $250, and completing all four parts wins the team $2,000, along with a $1,000 donation to a children&#x27;s charity of the team&#x27;s choice.

<text>A mother ship, mothership or mother-ship is a large vehicle that leads, serves, or carries other smaller vehicles. A mother ship may be a maritime ship, aircraft, or spacecraft.

Examples include bombers converted to carry experimental aircraft to altitudes where they can conduct their research (such as the B-52 carrying the X-15), or ships that carry small submarines to an area of ocean to be explored (such as the Atlantis II carrying the &quot;Alvin&quot;).

A mother ship may also be used to recover smaller craft, or go its own way after releasing them. A smaller vessel serving or caring for &quot;larger&quot; craft is usually called a tender.

== Maritime craft ==
During World War II, the German Type XIV submarine or &quot;Milchkuh&quot; (Milk cow) was a type of large submarine used to resupply the U-boats.

Mother ships can carry small submersibles and submarines to an area of ocean to be explored (such as the Atlantis II carrying the DSV &quot;Alvin&quot;).

Somali pirates use mother ships to extend their reach in the Indian Ocean. For example, the FV &quot;Win Far 161&quot; was captured and used as a mother ship in the &quot;Maersk Alabama&quot; hijacking.

== Aircraft ==
In aviation, motherships have been used in the airborne aircraft carrier, air launch and captive carry roles. Some large long-range aircraft act as motherships to parasite aircraft. A mothership may also form the larger component of a composite aircraft.

=== Airborne aircraft carriers ===

During the age of the great airships, the United States built two rigid airships, and , with onboard hangars able to house a number of Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk biplane fighters. These airborne aircraft carriers operated successfully for several years. These airships utilized an internal hangar bay using a &quot;trapeze&quot; to hold the aircraft.

=== Air launch ===

In the air launch role, a large carrier aircraft or mother ship carries a smaller payload aircraft to a launch point before releasing it.

During World War II the Japanese Mitsubishi G4M bomber was used to carry the rocket-powered Yokosuka MXY7 &quot;Ohka&quot; aircraft, used for &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks, within range of a target ship. Germany also planned a jet-carrying bomber, called the Daimler-Benz Project C.

In the US, NASA has used converted bombers as launch platforms for experimental aircraft. Notable among these was the use during the 1960s of a modified Boeing B-52 Stratofortress for the repeated launching of the North American X-15.

===Captive carry=== 

Experiments on air launching the Shuttle were carried out with the test frame &quot;Enterprise&quot;, but none of the Space Shuttle fleet was launched in this way once the Space Shuttle program was commenced. In a captive carry arrangement the payload craft, such as a rocket, missile, aeroplane or spaceplane, does not separate from the carrier aircraft.

Captive carry is typically used to conduct initial testing on a new airframe or system, before it is ready for free flight

Captive carry is sometimes also used to transport an aircraft or spacecraft on a ferry flight. Notable examples include:
* A pair of modified Boeing 747s known as the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft, were used by NASA to transport the Space Shuttle orbiter and to launch the orbiter for flight tests.
* The Soviet Union developed and used the Antonov An-225 &quot;Mriya&quot; to ferry the Buran spacecraft.

=== Parasite carriers ===


Some large long-range aircraft have been modified as motherships in order to carry parasite aircraft which support the mothership by extending its role, for example for reconnaissance, or acting in a support role such as fighter defence.

The first experiments with rigid airships to launch and recover fighters were carried out during World War I.

The British experimented with the 23-class airships from that time. Then in the 1920s, as part of the &quot;Airship Development Programme&quot;, they used the R33 for experiments. A de Havilland Humming Bird light aeroplane with a hook fitted was slung beneath it. In October 1925 Squadron Leader Rollo Haig, was released from the R33, and then reattached. Later that year, the attempt was repeated and the Humming Bird remained attached until the airship landed.
In 1926, it carried two Gloster Grebe fighters releasing them at the Pulham and Cardington airship stations.

In the U.S., USS &quot;Los Angeles&quot; (ZR-3), used for prototype testing for the Akron and Macon airborne aircraft carriers.

During World War II the Soviet Tupolev-Vakhmistrov Zveno project developed converted Tupolev TB-1 and TB-3 aircraft to carry and launch up to five smaller craft, typically in roles such as fighter escort or fighter-bomber.

During the early days of the jet age, fighter aircraft could not fly long distances and still match point defence fighters or interceptors in dogfighting. The solution was long-range bombers that would carry or tow their escort fighters.

B-29 Superfortress and B-36 Peacemaker bombers were tested as carriers for the RF-84K Thunderflash (FICON project) and XF-85 Goblin fighters.

In November 2014, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) requested industry proposals for a system in which small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) would be launched and recovered by their existing conventional large aircraft, including the B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer bombers and C-130 Hercules and C-17 Globemaster III transports.

=== Composites ===
In a composite aircraft, two or more component aircraft take off as a single unit and later separate. The British Short S.21 &quot;Maia&quot; experimental flying boat served as the mother ship component of the Short Mayo Composite two-plane maritime trans-Atlantic project design in the 1930s.

== Spacecraft ==
The mother ship concept was used in Moon landings performed in the 1960s. Both the 1962 American Ranger and the 1966 Soviet Luna uncrewed landers were spherical capsules designed to be ejected at the last moment from mother ships that carried them to the Moon, and crashed onto its surface. In the crewed Apollo program, astronauts in the Lunar Module left the Command/Service Module mother ship in lunar orbit, descended to the surface, and returned to dock in a lunar orbit rendezvous with the mother ship once more for the return to Earth.

The Scaled Composites White Knight series of aircraft are designed to launch spacecraft which they carry underneath them.

== In popular culture ==
===UFO lore===
There have been numerous sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) claimed to be mother ships, many in the U.S. during the summer of 1947. A woman in Palmdale, California, was quoted by contemporary press as describing a &quot;mother saucer (with a) bunch of little saucers playing around it&quot;. The term &quot;mothership&quot; was also popularized in UFO lore by contactee George Adamski, who claimed in the 1950s to sometimes see large cigar-shaped Venusian motherships, out of which flew smaller-sized flying saucer scout ships. Adamski claimed to have met and befriended the pilots of these scout ships, including a Venusian named Orthon.

===Science fiction===
The concept of a mother ship also occurs in science fiction, extending the idea to spaceships that serve as the equivalent of flagships among a fleet. In this context, &quot;mother ship&quot; is often spelled as one word: &quot;mothership&quot;. 

A mothership may be large enough that its body contains a station for the rest of the fleet. Examples include the large craft in &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; and &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;.

== In other languages ==
In many Asian languages, such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Indonesian, the word &quot;mothership&quot; (, , , , literally &quot;mother&quot; + &quot;(war)ship&quot;) typically refers to an aircraft carrier, which is translated as &quot;aircraft/aviation mothership&quot; (, , , ).

<doc id="576988" wikidata="Q6144884" url="?curid=576988" title="USS Silversides (SS-236)">
<text>USS &quot;Silversides&quot; (SS/AGSS-236) is a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the silversides.

&quot;Silversides&quot; was one of the most successful submarines in the Pacific Theater of World War II, with 23 confirmed sinkings, totalling more than of shipping. She received a Presidential Unit Citation for cumulative action over four patrols, and twelve battle stars. She presently serves as a museum ship in Muskegon, Michigan, and is a National Historic Landmark.

== Construction ==
Her keel was laid down on 4 November 1940, by the Mare Island Navy Yard in Vallejo, California. She was launched on 26 August 1941, sponsored by Mrs. Elizabeth H. Hogan, and commissioned on 15 December 1941, with Lieutenant Commander Creed C. Burlingame in command.

==Service in World War II==
=== First patrol: April–June 1942 ===
After shakedown off the California coast, &quot;Silversides&quot; set course for Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 4 April 1942. Departing Pearl Harbor on 30 April, &quot;Silversides&quot; headed for the Japanese home islands, in the area of Kii Suido, for the first of her many successful war patrols. On 10 May, just after 8:00 local time, the submarine used her gun to heavily damage the Japanese guard boat &quot;Ebisu Maru No.5&quot;. During this 75-minute action, an enemy machine-gun bullet killed one of her deck gunners, Torpedoman&#x27;s Mate Third Class Mike Harbin of Oklahoma, the only man lost in action aboard &quot;Silversides&quot; during World War II. Harbin was buried at sea later that evening. On 13 May, &quot;Silversides&quot; fired torpedoes at an enemy submarine; although explosions were heard, a definite sinking could not be confirmed.

On 17 May, while maneuvering through an enemy fishing fleet and approaching her targets, &quot;Silversides&quot;&#x27; periscope became entangled in a fishnet marked by Japanese flags held aloft on bamboo poles. The sub continued her approach, fishnet and all, and fired three torpedoes at the first ship, a 4,000-ton cargo ship. Two hits tore the victim&#x27;s stern open. While that ship was sinking, the second cargo ship was also hit, but its fate could not be determined. Patrol boats were closing in as the submarine, probably the only American submarine to make an attack while flying the Japanese flag, quickly left the vicinity. After damaging a freighter and tanker in the same area, &quot;Silversides&quot; terminated her first war patrol at Pearl Harbor on 21 June.

=== Second and third patrols: July–November 1942 ===
&quot;Silversides&quot;″s second war patrol was also conducted in the area of Kii Suido, from 15 July to 8 September. On 28 July, she sank a 4,000-ton transport, followed by the sinking of the passenger/cargo ship &quot;Nikkei Maru&quot; on 8 August. She scored damaging hits on a large tanker on the night of 14 August and, on 31 August, sank two enemy trawlers before returning to Pearl Harbor.

Her third war patrol, conducted in the Caroline Islands, did not result in any sinkings, although severe damage was done to a large cargo ship and there were two observed torpedo hits on a Japanese destroyer or light minelayer, which did an undetermined level of damage. She terminated her third patrol at Brisbane, Australia, on 25 November.
=== Fourth patrol: December 1942 – January 1943 ===
&quot;Silversides&quot; departed Brisbane on 17 December 1942 and set course for New Ireland for her fourth war patrol. While far out at sea on the night of 22 December, the submarine&#x27;s medical orderly, Pharmacist’s Mate First Class Thomas Moore, performed a successful emergency appendectomy on Fireman Second Class George Platter, using ether as anesthesia and rudimentary tools primarily fashioned from kitchen utensils. With the operation over at 3:00 on 23 December, the submarine surfaced only to be immediately forced down by a Japanese destroyer and compelled to endure a severe depth charge attack. Thinking herself safe, &quot;Silversides&quot; surfaced only to find the destroyer still there. Additionally, a Japanese airplane had arrived on the scene and proceeded to drop three bombs on the submarine, severely damaging her bow planes and causing them to lock on full dive. &quot;Silversides&quot; managed to level off just short of crush depth and eventually evaded the enemy ship before surfacing to recharge her batteries and effect emergency repairs.

While off Truk on 18 January 1943, &quot;Silversides&quot; torpedoed and sank her largest target of the war, the 10,022 ton oil tanker &quot;Toei Maru&quot;. Two days later, the submarine had one of her most productive days of the war. After paralleling a convoy throughout the daylight hours, she moved on ahead at sundown and lay in wait (an &quot;end around&quot; position). As the targets moved into range, &quot;Silversides&quot; fired torpedoes at overlapping targets and sank three enemy ships—the cargo ships &quot;Surabaya Maru&quot;, &quot;Somedono Maru&quot;, and &quot;Meiu Maru&quot;. The attack had scarcely abated when it was discovered that an armed torpedo was stuck in a forward torpedo tube. Since it was impossible to disarm the torpedo, the commanding officer decided to attempt to refire it, an extremely dangerous maneuver. The submarine moved in reverse at top speed and fired. The torpedo shot safely from the tube, disappearing as it moved toward the horizon.

When a serious oil leak was discovered later that night, the submarine left the patrol area two days ahead of schedule and returned to Pearl Harbor on 31 January for a major overhaul.

=== Fifth and sixth patrols: May–September 1943 ===
&quot;Silversides&quot;″s fifth war patrol commenced on 17 May and was conducted in the Solomon Islands area. Enroute the patrol area on 28 May, one of the more unusual moments of the war occurred. Stated in the 5th war patrol report as follows:

Proceeded on surface toward assigned position. On the 28th a frigate bird made a high level bombing attack, scoring a direct hit on the bare head and beard of the OOD, Lt. Bienia. No indication by radar prior to attack.

Continuing on, the submarine&#x27;s primary mission for this patrol was to lay a minefield in Steffan Strait, between New Hanover and New Ireland, but she did not neglect enemy shipping. On the night of 10 – 11 June, she sank the 5,256-ton cargo ship &quot;Hide Maru&quot;; for her efforts, &quot;Silversides&quot; was forced to endure a severe depth charging. She returned to Brisbane for refit on 16 July.

For her sixth war patrol, under newly assigned Lt. Commander John S. &quot;Jack&quot; Coye, Jr., from 21 July to 4 September, &quot;Silversides&quot; patrolled between the Solomons and the Carolines. Since she was plagued with malfunctioning torpedoes and a scarcity of targets, she returned to Brisbane empty-handed.

=== Seventh and eighth patrols: October 1943 – January 1944 ===
&quot;Silversides&quot; set sail on 5 October for her seventh war patrol, in which she sank four enemy ships in waters ranging from the Solomon Islands to the coast of New Guinea. On 18 October, she torpedoed and sank the cargo ship &quot;Tairin Maru&quot;, and, on 24 October, made a series of daring attacks to send the cargo ships &quot;Tennan Maru&quot; and &quot;Kazan Maru&quot; and the passenger/cargo ship &quot;Johore Maru&quot; to the bottom. She returned to Pearl Harbor for refit on 8 November.

&quot;Silversides&quot; patrolled off the Palau Islands for her eighth war patrol, where, on 29 December 1943, she brought havoc to an enemy convoy of cargo ships, sinking &quot;Tenposan Maru&quot;, &quot;Shichisei Maru&quot;, and &quot;Ryuto Maru&quot;. She terminated her eighth patrol at Pearl Harbor on 15 January 1944.

=== Ninth and tenth patrols: February–June 1944 ===
For her ninth war patrol, &quot;Silversides&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 15 February and set course for waters west of the Marianas Islands. On 16 March, she sank the cargo ship &quot;Kofuku Maru&quot;. The remainder of the patrol was devoid of worthwhile targets, so the submarine returned to Fremantle on 8 April.

While on her tenth war patrol, again off the Marianas Islands, &quot;Silversides&quot; destroyed six enemy vessels for a total of over 14,000 tons. On 10 May, she torpedoed and sank the cargo ship &quot;Okinawa Maru&quot;, followed up with the passenger/cargo ship &quot;Mikage Maru&quot;; and then sent the converted gunboat &quot;Choan Maru Number Two&quot; beneath the waves. Ten days later, she added to her score when she sank another converted gunboat, the 998-ton &quot;Shosei Maru&quot;. On 29 May, the submarine torpedoed and sank the cargo ships &quot;Shoken Maru&quot; and &quot;Horaizan Maru&quot;; and then headed for Pearl Harbor, arriving on 11 June. Two days later, she got underway for Mare Island Navy Yard for overhaul, returning to Pearl Harbor on 12 September.

=== Eleventh and twelfth patrol: September 1944 – February 1945 ===
&quot;Silversides&quot; cleared Pearl Harbor on 24 September for her eleventh war patrol, conducted off Kyūshū, Japan. Although this patrol was unproductive, she aided in the rescue of a stricken sister submarine. had been badly damaged in a severe depth charging and was forced to surface and try to escape while fighting enemy escorts in a gun battle, a task for which a submarine is badly outmatched. The gunfire flashes brought &quot;Silversides&quot; to the scene. She deliberately drew the attention of some of the escorts, then quickly dove to escape the gunfire. Soon, submarines and joined in helping &quot;Silversides&quot; to guard &quot;Salmon&quot;, and in escorting the stricken submarine back to Saipan, arriving on 3 November. &quot;Silversides&quot; terminated her eleventh patrol at Midway Island on 23 November.

&quot;Silversides&quot;&#x27; twelfth war patrol commenced on 22 December 1944, and was spent in the East China Sea. Despite aggressive searching, she found few worthwhile targets. However, when an opportunity did come her way, &quot;Silversides&quot; took full advantage. On 25 January 1945, she torpedoed the 4,556-ton cargo ship &quot;Malay Maru&quot;. She returned to Midway Island on 12 February.

=== Thirteenth and fourteenth patrols: March–July 1945 ===
During her thirteenth war patrol, &quot;Silversides&quot; was a member of a coordinated attack group with submarines and , patrolling off Kyūshū. Although she again found few worthwhile targets, the submarine did manage to damage a large freighter and to sink a trawler before returning to Pearl Harbor on 29 April.

&quot;Silversides&quot;″s fourteenth and final war patrol began with a departure from Pearl Harbor on 30 May. This patrol was spent on lifeguard station in support of airstrikes on Honshu, Japan. On 22 July, she rescued a downed fighter pilot from the light aircraft carrier , and two days later recovered a downed United States Army Air Forces airman. She ended this patrol at Apra Harbor, Guam, on 30 July. The submarine was undergoing refit there when the hostilities with Japan ended on 15 August.

== Post-war service: 1945–1969 ==
&quot;Silversides&quot; transited the Panama Canal on 15 September 1945, arriving at New York City on 21 September. After shifting to New London, Connecticut, she was decommissioned on 17 April 1946 and placed in reserve until 15 October 1947, when she was placed in service as a training ship for Naval Reservists at Chicago, Illinois. After a 1949 overhaul, she remained at Chicago in support of Naval Reserve training as a stationary training vessel for the rest of her service.

The last time &quot;Silversides&quot; was dry-docked was in 1949, when the submarine went into the reserve fleet and her solid brass propellers were removed.

On 6 November 1962, &quot;Silversides&quot; was reclassified as an auxiliary submarine with hull classification symbol AGSS-236, and on 30 June 1969, her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. The South Chicago Chamber of Commerce promptly applied to the United States Department of the Navy for custody of &quot;Silversides&quot; to preserve her as a memorial.

== 1973–present ==

&quot;Silversides&quot; became a part of the Combined Great Lakes Navy Association in Chicago, Illinois, behind Chicago&#x27;s Naval Armory on 24 May 1973. For years, the submarine was tended by a small crew of dedicated volunteers, drawn to her illustrious history and technical marvels. They donated tens of thousands of man-hours to restore her, maintained her at their own expense, and served as docents and chaperones. When association volunteers first stepped on board, they faced a musty, mildewed sub with paint peeling off in sheets inside and out, and junk scattered everywhere. After many years, the refrigeration compartment had produced a growth so thick, it could be measured in multiple inches instead of millimeters. Evidence of water damage prevailed in the forward compartments but the aft end was in reasonably good condition. Topside, the decking was weathered and worn in spots and some areas of the superstructure were rusted and in need of replacement.

Volunteers quickly took steps to stop the decay. Rotted lines were replaced and the boat re-secured to the pier, the bilges were pumped dry, electric power and heat were brought on board and a leak in the No. 3 torpedo tube sealed off. The first major renovation completed was stripping, undercoating and repainting the hull to the waterline. The job took several months, with a break over the winter, but once completed, the &quot;Silversides&quot; looked nearly new. Below decks, the boat was cleaned and general restoration got underway. Considerable rewiring was done to bring light to all areas of the boat, the plumbing underwent investigation for leaks sprung in once-frozen pipes and a crew set about surveying the Fairbanks Morse 38D8 nine-cylinder, , opposed-piston engines. The seven-cylinder auxiliary engine was brought back to life in 1975.

She was moved to Navy Pier in 1979. That July, the first main engine, No. 3, was brought back to life for the first time since 1946. The No. 4 engine was restored in time for the 1984 US Submarine Veterans of World War II convention. In 1987, the submarine was moved to Muskegon, Michigan, to serve as the centerpiece of the new Great Lakes Naval Memorial &amp; Museum.

Normally, United States Navy submarines are dry-docked every five years while on active duty. If permanently moored in freshwater the maintenance interval can be extended to 25 years. In 2004, 55 years after &quot;Silversides&quot;″s last dry-docking, the museum and two submarine veterans organizations formed a &quot;Save the Silversides&quot; fund and began soliciting tax-deductible donations through veterans groups and military publications. They based their plans on the dry-dock overhaul of , a memorial in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, which cost US$500,000 in 1996.

== Film production ==
&quot;Silversides&quot; was used for exterior scenes in the 2002 film &quot;Below&quot; to depict the fictional USS &quot;Tiger Shark&quot;. She was towed in Lake Michigan for filming.

== Awards ==
&quot;Silversides&quot; received twelve battle stars for World War II service, and was awarded one Presidential Unit Citation for cumulative action over four patrols. She is officially credited with sinking 23 ships, the third-most of any allied World War II submarine, behind only the and , according to JANAC figures. The tonnage of the ships sunk by &quot;Silversides&quot; amounted to 90,080 tons, ranking among the top five for tonnage sunk by an American submarine during the war. Judged by the Joint Army-Navy Assessment Committee (JANAC), &quot;Silversides&quot; has the most prolific combat record of any still-extant American submarine.
Other sources state that &quot;Silversides&quot; sank 31 ships totaling 100,685 tons during World War II.

== USS Silversides Submarine Museum ==

Originally opened as the Great Lakes Naval Memorial &amp; Museum, the museum is now known as the USS Silversides Submarine Museum, which also includes (a United States Coast Guard cutter) and a museum building.

The museum staff starts the USS &quot;Silversides&quot;″ Fairbanks Morse engines up to six times per year in order to keep the engines healthy.

<text>Ben Casey is an American medical drama television series that aired on ABC from 1961 to 1966. The show was known for its opening titles, which consisted of a hand drawing the symbols &quot;♂, ♀, ✳, †, ∞&quot; on a chalkboard, as cast member Sam Jaffe said &quot;Man, woman, birth, death, infinity.&quot; Neurosurgeon Joseph Ransohoff served as a medical consultant for the show.

==Plot==
The series stars Vince Edwards as medical doctor Ben Casey, the young, intense, and idealistic neurosurgeon at County General Hospital. His mentor is chief of neurosurgery Doctor David Zorba, played by Sam Jaffe, who, in the pilot episode, tells a colleague that Casey is &quot;the best chief resident this place has known in 20 years.&quot; In its first season, the series and Vince Edwards were nominated for Emmy awards. Additional nominations at the 14th Primetime Emmy Awards on May 22, 1962 went to Sam Jaffe, Jeanne Cooper (for the episode &quot;But Linda Only Smiled&quot;), Joan Hackett (for the episode &quot;A Certain Time, a Certain Darkness&quot;), and George C. Scott (for the episode &quot;I Remember a Lemon Tree&quot;). In its second season, the series garnered several more Emmy nominations, with Glenda Farrell and Kim Stanley both winning for the episode &quot;A Cardinal Act of Mercy&quot;. The show began running multi-episode stories, starting with the first five episodes of season four; Casey developed a romantic relationship with Jane Hancock (Stella Stevens), who had emerged from a coma after 15 years. At the beginning of season five (the last season), Jaffe left the show, and Franchot Tone replaced Zorba as the new chief of neurosurgery

==Production notes==
Creator James E. Moser based the character of Ben Casey on Dr. Allan Max Warner, a neurosurgeon whom Moser met while researching &quot;Ben Casey&quot;. Warner served as the program&#x27;s original technical advisor in 1961. According to an article in &quot;TV Guide&quot; (September 30 – October 6, 1961), he worked with the actors to show them how to handle medical instruments, 

&quot;Ben Casey&quot; had several directors, including Irvin Kershner and Sydney Pollack. Its theme music was written by David Raksin, and it is played in 5/4 time signature; a version performed by pianist Valjean was a Billboard Top 40 hit in the United States, peaking at number 28 on 23 June 1962.

Filmed at the Desilu Studios, the series was produced by Bing Crosby Productions.

===Spin-off===

Vince Edwards appeared on the television series &quot;Breaking Point&quot; as Ben Casey. The episode was &quot;Solo for B-Flat Clarinet&quot; and debuted 16 September 1963. Both &quot;Ben Casey&quot; and &quot;Breaking Point&quot; were produced by Bing Crosby Productions. Cast members of &quot;Breaking Point&quot; also had guest roles on &quot;Ben Casey&quot;.

==Television series tie-ins==
===Comics===
Both a comic strip and a comic book were based on the television series. The strip was developed and written by Jerry Capp (né Caplin) and drawn by Neal Adams. The daily comic strip began on November 26, 1962, and the Sunday strip debuted on September 20, 1964. Both ended on July 31, 1966 (a Sunday). The daily strip was reprinted in &quot;The Menomonee Falls Gazette&quot;. The comic book was published by Dell Comics for 10 issues from 1962 to 1964. All had photo covers, except for that of the final issue, which was drawn by John Tartaglione.

===Novels===
From 1962 through 1963, the paperback publisher Lancer Books issued four original novels based on the series. They were &quot;Ben Casey&quot; by William Johnston, &quot;A Rage for Justice&quot; by Norman Daniels, &quot;The Strength of His Hands&quot; by Sam Elkin, and &quot;The Fire Within&quot;, again by Daniels, small-print standard mass-market size paperbacks of 128 or 144 pages each. The covers of the books featured photographs of Edwards as Casey, or in the case of the third novel, a drawing of a doctor with Edwards&#x27; appearance.

== 1988 television film &quot;The Return of Ben Casey&quot;==
In 1988, the TV movie &quot;The Return of Ben Casey&quot;, with Vince Edwards reprising his role as Casey, aired in syndication. Harry Landers was the only other original cast member to reprise his role (as Dr. Ted Hoffman). The film was directed by Joseph L. Scanlan. The pilot was not picked up by the major networks to bring the series back.

==In popular culture==
In 1962, the series inspired the semicomic rock song &quot;Callin&#x27; Dr. Casey&quot;, written and performed by songwriter John D. Loudermilk. In the song, Loudermilk refers to the TV doctor&#x27;s wide-ranging medical abilities and asks whether Casey has any cure for heartbreak. The song reached number 83 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

During the Vietnam War, the term &quot;Ben Casey&quot; was used by American troops as slang for a medic.

In the popular Japanese medical drama &quot;Doctor-X: Surgeon Michiko Daimon&quot; the office cat is named Ben Casey.

There is a street named Ben Casey Drive in San Antonio, Texas. 

===Parodies===
Cleveland, Ohio&#x27;s late-night movie program &quot;The Hoolihan and Big Chuck Show&quot; and its successor program &quot;The Big Chuck and Lil&#x27; John Show&quot; regularly aired comedy skits under the title &quot;Ben Crazy&quot; that parodied &quot;Ben Casey&quot;. The skits opened with a spoof of the chalkboard sequence, adding one more symbol at the end — a dollar sign ($), accompanied by a laugh track. &quot;Big Chuck&quot; Schodowski, one of the hosts of the show, said that the skits continued to air for so many years after the 1966 cancellation of &quot;Ben Casey&quot; that younger viewers probably did not recognize the opening and that real-life doctors would send in ideas for skits, some of which were used on the show.

Dickie Goodman released a novelty song in 1962 titled &quot;Ben Crazy&quot; that parodied Ben Casey as &quot;Ben Crazy&quot; and Dr. Zorba as &quot;Dr. Smorba&quot;, and it parodied Dr. Kildare, the main character on another popular 1960s medical drama series. Goodman&#x27;s recording used his &quot;break-in&quot; technique of sampling lines from then-popular songs to &quot;answer&quot; comedic questions; it sampled the &quot;Ben Casey&quot; title sequence and theme. The record reached number 44 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.
&quot;The Flintstones&quot; featured several parodies of Ben Casey:

* &quot;The Blessed Event&quot; (season three, episode 23, 1963) features the birth of Pebbles Flintstone. While wandering around the hospital looking for the maternity ward, Fred Flintstone runs into caricatures of Ben Casey and Dr. Zorba. They help Fred on his way, and then walk into a TV studio (which is inexplicably in a hospital), as Fred remarks that they seemed awfully familiar.
* &quot;Ann-Margrock Presents&quot; (season four, episode 1, 1963) features a dentist named Ben Cavity, who is a parody of Ben Casey.
* &quot;Monster Fred&quot; (season five, episode two, 1964) featured a mad doctor character named &quot;Len Frankenstone&quot; (voiced by Allan Melvin) and his associate &quot;Dr. Zero&quot; (voiced by Doug Young). These characters were parodies of Ben Casey and Dr. Zorba.

In &quot;My Husband Is Not a Drunk&quot;, a 1962 episode of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, a hypnotized Rob addresses the bald Mel Cooley as &quot;Dr. Zorba&quot;, a rare instance of the show referencing another TV series.

The veterinarian in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, first introduced in the episode &quot;Dog of Death&quot; performing surgery on Santa&#x27;s Little Helper, was based on Ben Casey. In addition, the Springfield Hospital motif played at the start of a Hospital-based scene is based on the opening of the Ben Casey musical theme.

In his song &quot;One Hippopotomi&quot;, a parody of &quot;What Kind of Fool Am I?&quot; by Anthony Newley, Allan Sherman sings the lyrics: &quot;When Ben Casey meets Kildare, that&#x27;s called a paradox.&quot;

In the 1966 &quot;Batman&quot; episode “Rats Like Cheese”, the Dynamic Duo are brought to a hospital because Mr. Freeze froze them solid. Chief O’Hara refers to the Ben Casey-lookalike doctor as Vince. Dr. Vince yells back in Ben Casey fashion that he’s doing all he can.
