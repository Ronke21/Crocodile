<text>William Emmett Smith (March 24, 1933 – July 5, 2021) was an American actor. In a Hollywood career spanning more than 79 years, he appeared in almost three hundred feature films and television productions in a wide variety of character roles, often villainous or brutal, accumulating over 980 total credits, with his best known role being the menacing Anthony Falconetti in the 1970s television mini-series &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot;. Smith is also known for films like &quot;Any Which Way You Can&quot; (1980), &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; (1982), &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; (1983), and &quot;Red Dawn&quot; (1984), as well as lead roles in several exploitation films during the 1970s and 1990s. He also appeared in episode 2 of the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; television series as Tolar.

==Early life and career==
Smith was born on March 24, 1933, in Columbia, Missouri, to William Emmett Smith and Emily (Richards) Smith and grew up on their cattle ranch. His family later moved to Southern California, where he began his acting career at the age of eight in 1942, entering show business as a child actor in such films as &quot;The Ghost of Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot; and &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;.

Smith served in the United States Air Force. He won the 200-pound (91 kg) arm-wrestling championship of the world multiple times, also winning the United States Air Force weightlifting championship. A lifelong bodybuilder, Smith was a record holder for reverse-curling his own body weight. His trademark arms measured as much as inches. Smith held a 31–1 record as an amateur boxer. A fluent Russian speaker with a master&#x27;s degree in the discipline from UCLA, during the Korean War Smith was a Russian Intercept Interrogator and flew secret ferret missions over the Russian SFSR. He was reportedly also fluent in French, German and Serbo-Croatian. While working on his doctorate, Smith was offered a contract with MGM, which would pave his career.

From 1961 to 2014, Smith established himself as a prolific and talented character actor with roles in a diverse range of genres. Although often typecast as an anti-social personality, he sporadically got the opportunity to prove his effectiveness in other kinds of roles as a law enforcement officer or an anti-heroic protagonist. He was a regular on the 1961 ABC television series &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot;, portraying police Sergeant Danny Keller. In 1964, he appeared in the episode &quot;The Rope of Lies&quot; as Bill, a ranch hand from the Shiloh Ranch in the syndicated television series &quot;The Virginian&quot;. He appeared in the 1964 Wagon Train episode &quot;The Bob Stuart Story&quot; and also gave a moving performance as the orphaned Native American valet who rails against violence opposite Guy Stockwell in &quot;The Richard Bloodgood Story&quot; S8 E10 which aired on 11/28/1964. One of his earliest leading roles was Joe Riley, a good-natured Texas Ranger with arms of steel on the NBC western series &quot;Laredo&quot; (1965–1967). Smith guest starred as Jude Bonner on James Arness&#x27;s long-lived western &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; in a 1972 episode, &quot;Hostage!&quot;; his character abducts, beats, and apparently rapes (off-screen) Amanda Blake&#x27;s character, Miss Kitty Russell, and shoots her twice in the back. Smith has been described as the &quot;greatest bad-guy character actor of our time&quot;.

Smith joined the cast of the final season of &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; as Detective James &quot;Kimo&quot; Carew, a new officer in the Five-O unit. He had previously appeared with Jack Lord in &quot;Stoney Burke&quot;. Smith starred in one episode each of the Adam West &quot;Batman&quot; TV series (in the episode &quot;Minerva, Mayhem and Millionaires&quot; as Adonis, one of the minions of the title guest villainess portrayed by Zsa Zsa Gabor), &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; (in the episode &quot;Operation: First Couple on the Moon&quot; as Turk Parker), &quot;Kung Fu&quot; and as The Treybor, a ruthless warlord, in the &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot; episode &quot;Buck&#x27;s Duel to the Death&quot;. Smith also made guest appearances opposite James Garner in the 1974 two-hour pilot for &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; (titled &quot;Backlash of the Hunter&quot;) and George Peppard in &quot;The A-Team&quot; (in two appearances as different characters, in the first season&#x27;s &quot;Pros and Cons&quot; and the fourth season&#x27;s &quot;The A-Team Is Coming, The A-Team Is Coming&quot;). In the 1976 television miniseries &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot;, he portrayed Anthony Falconetti, nemesis of the Jordache family, and reprised the role in the sequel, &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man Book II&quot;.

Other 1970s TV appearances included the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;The Energy Eater&quot;, as an Indian medicine man who advises Kolchak, and an early &quot;Six Million Dollar Man&quot; episode &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot; as Commander Maxwell. He also appeared in the 1979 miniseries &quot;The Rebels&quot; as John Waverly; in an episode of &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; as Jason Steele, a bounty hunter hired by Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane to frame the Duke Boys into jail; and an episode of &quot;Knight Rider&quot; as Harold Turner, the manipulative leader of a hellish biker gang whom Michael Knight (David Hasselhoff) has to outsmart.

On the big screen, Smith became the star of several cult feature films in the early 1970s. He appeared as heavy Terry Bartell in &quot;Darker than Amber&quot; in 1970. In the fist fight scene that ends the film, Rod Taylor hit Smith (who was playing the villain) who retaliated in kind, and a staged-fight scene became a real fight as the cameras continued to roll. Smith later reported that Taylor was &quot;a very tough guy&quot; who broke three of his ribs while he broke Taylor&#x27;s nose.

Also in 1970, Smith featured in two biker flicks &quot;Nam&#x27;s Angels&quot; (originally released under the title &quot;The Losers&quot;) co-starring Bernie Hamilton and &quot;C.C. and Company&quot;, the latter of which was directed by Seymour Robbie and written by Roger Smith. He starred in 1972&#x27;s &quot;Grave of the Vampire&quot; as James Eastman and in 1973&#x27;s &quot;Invasion of the Bee Girls&quot;, and 1975&#x27;s &quot;The Swinging Barmaids&quot;.

In 1972 and 1975, respectively, he appeared in two popular Blaxploitation films, &quot;Hammer&quot; and the controversially titled &quot;Boss Nigger&quot;, both with Fred Williamson. In 1972, he appeared in a Columbo episode &quot;The Greenhouse Jungle&quot; as Ken Nichols, a handsome swindler who may be a person of interest in Columbo&#x27;s murder investigation. After that, he appeared as a vindictive sergeant in &quot;Twilight&#x27;s Last Gleaming&quot; (1977), as a drag-racing legend in &quot;Fast Company&quot; (1979), as the title character&#x27;s father in &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; (1982) (a movie in which he was also briefly considered for the lead role), as bad guy Matt Diggs in &quot;The Frisco Kid&quot; (1979), as Clint Eastwood&#x27;s bare-knuckle opponent Jack Wilson in 1980&#x27;s &quot;Any Which Way You Can&quot; and had the top villainous role as a Soviet Spetsnaz commander in 1984&#x27;s &quot;Red Dawn&quot;.

In 1983, Smith appeared in two films from Francis Ford Coppola in &quot;The Outsiders&quot; as a store clerk and in &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; as a police officer. In 1985, he landed the starring role of Brodie Hollister in the short-lived Disney Western series &quot;Wildside&quot; and another role as the bookmaker Dutchman&#x27;s strongarm enforcer known simply as &quot;Panama Hat&quot;, in director Richard Brooks&#x27;s final movie, &quot;Fever Pitch&quot; (1985).

From the late 80&#x27;s on and into the new millennium, Smith&#x27;s icy stare, physique and continuous essaying of scene-stealing character villainy continued in a string of B-features and direct-to-video productions. Many were continuing collaborations with filmmakers he had worked with years prior along with other character players who also achieved cult status in their own right. Such names include Robert Z&#x27;Dar, Joe Estevez, Tim Thomerson, James Drury, Lloyd Kaufman, Gary Graver, Wolf Larson and Jürgen Prochnow. 

In 2002, Smith voiced Draaga, an alien gladiator, in the &quot;Justice League&quot; episode &quot;War World&quot;.

Although it was reported that Smith retired in 2014, he made a cameo appearance in &quot;Irresistible&quot; (2020).

==Post-retirement and death==
In 2009, Smith published &quot;The Poetic Works of William Smith&quot;.

Smith died at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital in Los Angeles on July 5, 2021, at the age of 88.

<text>2CH was a commercial radio station in Sydney, Australia which aired from 1932 to 2022. It was latterly owned by Sports Entertainment Network.

==History==
2CH commenced broadcasting on 15 February 1932 on 1210 kHz. It moved to its final AM frequency of 1170 kHz in 1935.

===Ownership===
The CH stands for &quot;churches&quot;. In 1944, the NSW Council of Churches sub-let the licence to AWA who provided program content for six days per week, with the Council of Churches being responsible for programming on Sundays. By 1991, MLC had a 74% shareholding. It was sold to John Singleton in April 1994 becoming part of the Macquarie Radio Network. In June 2003, its studios moved from Sussex Street to Pyrmont.

In January 2017, 2CH was sold to a consortium of Oceania Capital Partners, Glenn Wheatley and John Williams for $5.6 million. The station had to be sold to comply with an undertaking given to the Australian Communications &amp; Media Authority following the merger of the Macquarie Radio Network and Fairfax Media (owners of 2GB and 2UE respectively) to comply with legislation allowing one party to only control two radio stations in a market.

The station posted a loss of $1.9 million on revenue of $2.4 million for the year to March 2019 In June 2020, it was sold for $11 million to Sports Entertainment Network.

===Church thanksgiving===
On 18 February 2007, a thanksgiving service to celebrate 2CH&#x27;s 75 years of broadcasting was held at St Andrew&#x27;s Anglican Cathedral commencing at 2 pm. The Reverend Peter Jensen, the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney presided with Rev. Dr. Ross Clifford preaching.

=== Transition to &#x27;DAB+ only&#x27; radio station and final end ===
In August 2020 after the station was purchased by Pacific Star, it was announced that 2CH would be switching to only broadcasting on digital radio. 2CH was heard on DAB+ radio until 10 June 2022, after briefly simulcasting on DAB+ and 1170 kHz in the AM broadcast band. The station used be live-streamed over the internet until the station demise.

Although not the first &#x27;DAB+ only&#x27; radio station in Australia, 2CH was probably the first to transition by relinquishing its AM radio frequency allocation.

Trevor Sinclair broadcast his final show on the AM broadcast band from Midday-7pm on 22 October 2020. Chris Kearns broadcast his show on both AM and DAB+ until midnight 22 October 2020, when the AM frequency 1170 kHz was taken over by 1170 SEN, carrying a dedicated sports broadcasting network, known as the Sports Entertainment Network. At 6pm on 10 June 2022, 2CH left the airwaves for the final time with Jane Nield as the last live announcer. This follows an 18 month legacy after the Sports Entertainment Network purchased the station in 2020, and an unsuccessful DAB+ trial.

The former 2CH medium wave frequency, 1170 kHz, is now used by SEN 1170.

Veteran radio presenter Bob Rogers worked at the station, from 1995 until he retired in early October 2020, at the age of 93.

<doc id="581527" wikidata="Q2908369" url="?curid=581527" title="Bodhisena">
<text>Bodhisena or Bodaisenna (704–760) was a Buddhist scholar and monk from India known for traveling to Japan and China and establishing the Kegon school, the Japanese transmission of the Huayan school of Chinese Buddhism.

His stay has been noted in the official history records called the Shoku Nihongi, where he is referred to as Bodai-Senna.

==Early years==
Bodhisena was born in Madurai around 704 AD. He got mystical inspiration from Manjusri Bodhisattva. He initially went to China, having heard that he could meet the incarnation of Manjusri at Mount Wutai. However, on reaching Mount Wutai, he was told the incarnation was in Japan. While in China, Bodhisena met a Japanese ambassador. The ambassador invited him to Japan on behalf of Emperor Shomu (701-756 AD), who was a devoted Buddhist. He also became acquainted with the tenth Japanese ambassador to China, Tajihi no Mabito Hironari. He also met the Japanese monk Rikyo.

== Voyage to Japan ==
On the invitation of Emperor Shōmu, he visited Japan to establish Huayan Buddhism in the country. He traveled with the Japanese delegation of Tajihi no Hironari, via Cambodia and Champa in Vietnam.

On the same ship were other important historical figures.

They included the traveling companions Genbō and Kibi no Makibi. Genbo was a monk and was returning from China with the over 5,000 fascicles that made up the Chinese Buddhist Canon. Kibi brought with him the arts of embroidery, playing the lyre, and the game of Go.

== Life in Japan ==
The party arrived at Naniwa (Osaka) in August 736 and was met by the monk Gyoki.

According to a number of sources, Gyoki and Bodhisena recognised each other from a past life. According to the Shūi Wakashū, quoting from the Tōdaiji Yōroku, Gyoki stated that they were together at Vulture Peak when the Buddha preached the Lotus Sutra. Bodhisena, called the &quot;Baramon Sojo&quot; (Brahmin Priest), additionally refers to them being together at Kapilavastu. He also recognised Gyoki as the rebirth of the boddhisatva Manjusri he was seeking. Their exchange is recorded thus:

Gyoki:

Baramon Sojo in reply:

Gyoki conducted Bodhisena to Nara and presented him to the emperor. He was treated with great honour and lodged in the temple called Daian-ji, where he founded Kegon Buddhism and also taught Sanskrit.

In 752, Emperor Shōmu asked him to perform the eye-opening ceremony for the giant bronze statue of the Buddha Vairocana built in Tōdai-ji. Dosen also played a significant role. The painting of the eyes was done by Bodhisena.

After a visit to Mount Tomi (Nara), Bodhisena petitioned the emperor to name the prayer hall there , as he found the place to strongly resemble the mountain in India where the Buddha preached, known as Vulture Peak, or &quot;Ryoujusen&quot; () in Japanese.

Bodhisena resided in Daian-ji () in Heijō-kyō for the rest of his life. He died on 25 February 760 at Daian-ji temple, and was buried on the &quot;Ryoujusen&quot; () mountain, following his wish when he died.


== Legacy ==
Japan&#x27;s traditional court dance and music still preserve some of the forms introduced by Bodhisena into Japan.

The forty-seven characters of the Japanese script are said to have been devised after the pattern of the Sanskrit alphabet by the Japanese Buddhist Kobo Daishi (774-835 AD). The arrangement of the Japanese syllabary based on the Sanskrit system is also attributed to the influence of Bodhisena in Japan, which, according to Riri Nakayama, &quot;will continue as long as the Japanese language continues to exist&quot;.

He is also revered in China, Korea and Vietnam.

<text>The Los Angeles Master Chorale is a professional chorus in Los Angeles, California, and one of the resident companies of both The Music Center and Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. It was founded in 1964 by Roger Wagner to be one of the three original resident companies of the Music Center of Los Angeles County. Grant Gershon has been its music director since 2001, replacing Paul Salamunovich.

The Master Chorale performs about ten times per year in its own season. It has presented more than 450 concerts, including early choral music to contemporary compositions. Noted for presenting numerous world, U.S. and West Coast premieres, the chorus has commissioned 24 and premiered 40 new works. The Master Chorale regularly performs with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, both at the Music Center and at the Hollywood Bowl, with such leading conductors as Gustavo Dudamel, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Zubin Mehta, André Previn, Pierre Boulez, Michael Tilson Thomas and Roger Norrington, among many others. Notable guest conductors have included Robert Shaw, Helmuth Rilling, Margaret Hillis, Robert Page and Richard Westenburg. It served as the chorus for Los Angeles Opera during that organization&#x27;s early years before it had established its own in-house chorus. It also performs in community concerts throughout Southern California.

The Chorale originally performed at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, but since 2003 the group&#x27;s principal concert venue has been Walt Disney Concert Hall. Morten Lauridsen was its composer-in-residence from 1994 through 2001.

Composed by Orlando di Lasso, conducted by Grant Gershon, and directed by Peter Sellars, &quot;Lagrime di San Pietro&quot; (The Tears of St. Peter) is an a cappella Renaissance masterpiece set to the poetry of Luigi Tansillo (1510–1568). Debuting in 2016, singers from the Los Angeles Master Chorale transform this 75-minute work into an emotional performance piece centered around the Apostle Peter accepting responsibility and the seven stages of grief that he experienced after disavowing his knowledge of Jesus on the day he was arrested. Since its debut, &quot;Lagrime&quot; has toured internationally and been presented at the Melbourne International Arts Festival, Palacio de Bellas Artes, Cal Performances, The Barbican Center, and Cité de la Musique among others.

&quot;Voices Within,&quot; another of the Chorale&#x27;s highly successful outreach programs, is an in-depth, ten-week, in-school residency program for middle and high school students that helps children who have little or no musical background to “find their voices.” With the assistance of a teaching artist, lyricist, and composer who work with teams of students in the classroom, children write music and lyrics to create original songs.

The Master Chorale provides education outreach to approximately 13,000 children each year.

<doc id="581537" wikidata="Q707005" url="?curid=581537" title="Yegor Ligachyov">
<text>Yegor Kuzmich Ligachyov ( Ligachev; ; 29 November 1920 – 7 May 2021) was a Soviet and Russian politician who was a high-ranking official in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), and who continued an active political career in post-Soviet Russia. Originally an ally of Mikhail Gorbachev, Ligachyov became a challenger to his leadership.

==Early life==
Ligachyov was born on 29 November 1920 in the village Dubinkino in the of the Tomsk province (in the present-day Chulymsky District of the Novosibirsk Oblast). Between 1938 and 1943 he attended the Ordzhonikidze Institute for Aviation in Moscow and attained a technical engineering degree. Ligachyov joined the Communist Party at the age of 24 in 1944, later studying at the in Moscow in 1951.

==Political career==
Ligachyov&#x27;s career began in his native Siberia and took him to some of the highest functions of the Party. He was often regarded as Gorbachev&#x27;s second man, holding important posts such as the Secretary for Ideology. However, Ligachyov lost his posts in 1990, a year before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, resigning from his political career at the 28th Party Congress. Ligachyov was critical of Boris Yeltsin and Gorbachev to an extent, although he is often portrayed as having been Gorbachev&#x27;s primary critic.

===In the USSR===

Ligachyov was First Secretary of the Novosibirsk Komsomol, before becoming Deputy Chairman of the Novosibirsk Soviet, and then Secretary of the Novosibirsk Obkom between 1959 and 1961.

Ligachyov gained his first major post in 1961, when he began working in the Central Committee of the CPSU. In 1965, he became First Secretary of the Party in Tomsk, Siberia. He was reputed to be an effective administrator. In a memoir published in 1984, Nikolai Baibakov, the chairman of the USSR State Planning Committee, praised Ligachyov for introducing &quot;modern management methods&quot; in Tomsk, and for his &quot;tremendous contribution to all branches of the region&#x27;s economy.&quot; During his time there he led the cover-up of the Stalin-era mass grave at Kolpashevo. He was to hold this position until 1983, when he was discovered by Yuri Andropov and made head of the Party Organization Department and a Secretary of the Central Committee.

In 1966, Ligachyov was elected a candidate member of the Central Committee, and ten years later in 1976 he was promoted to a full member. When Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary in 1985, Ligachyov was promoted to become a Secretary of higher status, and was generally viewed as one of Gorbachev&#x27;s primary allies: he had helped organize a pro-Gorbachev faction in hope of having Gorbachev succeed Andropov in 1984, although this attempt failed (instead, Konstantin Chernenko was chosen as a stop-gap candidate). Ligachyov was made head of the Secretariat.

Ligachyov supported reform of the Soviet Union and initially supported Gorbachev; however, as Gorbachev&#x27;s policies of perestroika and glasnost began to resemble what were seen as social democratic policies, he distanced himself from Gorbachev, and by 1988 he was recognized as the leader of the more conservative, anti-Gorbachev faction of Soviet politicians. During this period, Ligachyov began to utter the phrase &quot;Boris, you are wrong&quot; when referring to Yeltsin in a political discourse. Ligachyov served in the Politburo between 1985 and 1990. Ligachyov, having made some speeches criticizing Gorbachev, was demoted from his more prestigious position as Secretary for Ideology to Secretary for Agriculture on 30 September 1988.

At the 28th Congress of the CPSU in 1990, he criticized Gorbachev for circumventing the Party via the Soviet Presidency, and he argued Glasnost had gone too far. During the Party Congress, Ligachyov challenged Gorbachev for the office of General Secretary, standing as the &quot;Leninist&quot; candidate. Having been defeated, Ligachyov left the Politburo for temporary retirement.

===Russian Federation===
After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Ligachyov became a communist politician in the Russian Federation. Ligachyov was elected three times to the Russian State Duma as a member for the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. Ligachyov was a member of its Central Committee from 1993 on. However, he lost his seat in the Duma in 2003, when he polled 23.5 percent of the vote against United Russia candidate Vladimir Zhidkikh&#x27;s 53 percent.

Ligachyov&#x27;s memoirs, &quot;Inside Gorbachev&#x27;s Kremlin&quot;, were published in 1996. Serge Schmemann of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the author was driven &quot;to seek explanations for what went wrong, to understand his own role&quot; and while the reviewer wished for more intrigue (in the form of detailed accounts of events other than the dissolution of the USSR), he believed the book was an interesting and detailed account of that period from the perspective of an &quot;honest Bolshevik&quot;.

==Significance==
Ligachyov became one of Gorbachev&#x27;s primary critics, and was accused of leading a conservative faction. Although publicly endorsing perestroika, Ligachyov was opposed to Gorbachev&#x27;s attempts to expand Soviet authority and limit the responsibilities of party officials. Ligachyov did not support the decision to end the CPSU&#x27;s monopoly of political power in 1990, nor did he support Gorbachev&#x27;s response to the gradual withdrawal of Soviet authority in Eastern Europe. He saw the quick reunification of Germany as being an &quot;impending danger&quot;.

However, in 1988, Ligachyov denied that he was leading a conservative faction, saying that the Party leadership were united behind Gorbachev. He also rejected suggestions after the fall of the Soviet Union that he had been opposed to Gorbachev in his memoirs and in speeches. Ligachyov clearly demonstrated conservative ideas in his opposition of Yeltsin&#x27;s political ideas, on the other hand, opposing the principles of glasnost. He later repudiated his opposition to Gorbachev&#x27;s policies, saying it was &quot;only too late [he] discerned a social democrat in Gorbachev&quot;. However, Ligachyov repeatedly denied he was opposed to Gorbachev in sources including his memoirs.

Ligachyov&#x27;s economically hard-line views were upheld in speeches he made to the CPSU&#x27;s Congress in 1990. The following deplored privatization of the economy:

However, in this speech he also rejected the idea he was a conservative, saying he was a realist. Ligachyov also stated earlier that &quot;the slackening of state discipline&quot; was &quot;among the reasons for the troubled state of the economy&quot;. Furthermore, together with KGB chief Viktor Chebrikov, Ligachyov took several opportunities before he was demoted to Secretary for Agriculture in 1988 to warn against rapid reform.

Although not mentioned in his memoirs to any notable extent, Ligachyov played a significant role in dismissing Yeltsin, arguing with him for long periods of time in 1987. Ligachyov opposed Yeltsin&#x27;s idea that Party officials enjoyed greater privilege.

Ligachyov was considered &quot;Second Secretary&quot; of the Central Committee (and thus the Soviet Union) for most of his time in the Politburo.

==Death==
On April 5, 2021, he was hospitalized at the Moscow Central Clinical Hospital. A few days before his death, he was admitted to intensive care, where he was connected to a ventilator. He was diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia and multiple autonomic disorders according to the doctors; they assessed Ligachyov’s condition as extremely serious because of his old age.

Ligachyov died during his sleep from pneumonia at the age of 100. He was buried at the Troekurovskoye cemetery.

<text>The Crotalinae, commonly known as pit vipers, or pit adders, are a subfamily of vipers found in Asia and the Americas. Like all other vipers, they are venomous. They are distinguished by the presence of a heat-sensing pit organ located between the eye and the nostril on both sides of the head. Currently, 23 genera and 155 species are recognized: These are also the only viperids found in the Americas. The groups of snakes represented here include rattlesnakes, lanceheads, and Asian pit vipers. The type genus for this subfamily is &quot;Crotalus&quot;, of which the type species is the timber rattlesnake, &quot;C. horridus&quot;.

These snakes range in size from the diminutive hump-nosed viper, &quot;Hypnale hypnale&quot;, that grows to a typical total length (including tail) of only , to the bushmaster, &quot;Lachesis muta&quot;, a species known to reach a maximum total length of in length.

This subfamily is unique in that all member species share a common characteristic – a deep pit, or fossa, in the loreal area between the eye and the nostril on either side of the head. These loreal pits are the external openings to a pair of extremely sensitive infrared-detecting organs, which in effect give the snakes a sixth sense to help them find and perhaps even judge the size of the small, warm-blooded prey on which they feed. The pit organ is complex in structure and is similar to the thermoreceptive labial pits found in boas and pythons. It is deep and located in a maxillary cavity. The membrane is like an eardrum that divides the pit into two sections of unequal size, with the larger of the two facing forwards and exposed to the environment. The two sections are connected via a narrow tube, or duct, that can be opened or closed by a group of surrounding muscles. By controlling this tube, the snake can balance the air pressure on either side of the membrane. The membrane has many nerve endings packed with mitochondria. Succinic dehydrogenase, lactic dehydrogenase, adenosine triphosphate, monoamine oxidase, generalized esterases, and acetylcholine esterase have also been found in it. When prey comes into range, infrared radiation falling onto the membrane allows the snake to determine its direction. Having one of these organs on either side of the head produces a stereo effect that indicates distance, as well as direction. Experiments have shown, when deprived of their senses of sight and smell, these snakes can strike accurately at moving objects less than warmer than the background. The paired pit organs provide the snake with thermal rangefinder capabilities. These organs are of great value to a predator that hunts at night, as well as for avoiding the snake’s own predators.

Among vipers, these snakes are also unique in that they have a specialized muscle, called the muscularis pterigoidius glandulae, between the venom gland and the head of the ectopterygoid. Contraction of this muscle, together with that of the muscularis compressor glandulae, forces venom out of the gland.

== Evolution ==
The earliest known fossil pit viper remains are from the Early Miocene of Nebraska. As pit vipers are thought to have had an Asian origin before eventually colonizing the Americas, this suggests that they must have originated and diversified even earlier. During the Late Miocene, they reached as far west as eastern Europe, where they are no longer found; it is thought that they did not expand further into Europe.

==Geographic range==
The subfamily Crotalinae is found from Central Asia eastward and southward to Japan, China, Indonesia, peninsular India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. In the Americas, they range from southern Canada southward to Central America to southern South America.

==Habitat==

Crotalines are a versatile subfamily, with members found in habitats ranging from parched desert (e.g., the sidewinder, &quot;Crotalus cerastes&quot;) to rainforests (e.g., the bushmaster, &quot;Lachesis muta&quot;). They may be either arboreal or terrestrial, and at least one species (the cottonmouth, &quot;Agkistrodon piscivorus&quot;) is semiaquatic. The altitude record is held jointly by &quot;Crotalus triseriatus&quot; in Mexico and &quot;Gloydius strauchi&quot; in China, both of which have been found above the treeline at over 4,000 m above sea level.

==Behavior==
Although a few species of crotalines are highly active by day, such as &quot;Trimeresurus trigonocephalus&quot;, a bright green pit viper endemic to Sri Lanka, most are nocturnal, preferring to avoid high daytime temperatures and to hunt when their favored prey are also active. The snakes&#x27; heat-sensitive pits are also thought to aid in locating cooler areas in which to rest.

As ambush predators, crotalines typically wait patiently somewhere for unsuspecting prey to wander by. At least one species, the arboreal &quot;Gloydius shedaoensis&quot; of China, is known to select a specific ambush site and return to it every year in time for the spring migration of birds. Studies have indicated these snakes learn to improve their strike accuracy over time.

Many temperate species of pit vipers (e.g. most rattlesnakes) congregate in sheltered areas or &quot;dens&quot; to overwinter (brumate, see hibernation), the snakes benefiting from the combined heat. In cool temperatures and while pregnant, pit vipers also bask on sunny ledges. Some species do not mass together in this way, for example the copperhead, &quot;Agkistrodon contortrix&quot;, or the Mojave rattlesnake, &quot;Crotalus scutulatus&quot;.

Like most snakes, crotalines keep to themselves and strike only if cornered or threatened. Smaller snakes are less likely to stand their ground than larger specimens. Pollution and the destruction of rainforests have caused many pit viper populations to decline. Humans also threaten pit vipers, as many are hunted for their skins or killed by cars when they wander onto roads.

==Reproduction==
With few exceptions, crotalines are ovoviviparous, meaning that the embryos develop within eggs that remain inside the mother&#x27;s body until the offspring are ready to hatch, when the hatchlings emerge as functionally free-living young. In such species, the eggshells are reduced to soft membranes that the young shed, either within the reproductive tract, or immediately after emerging.

Among the oviparous (egg-laying) pit vipers are &quot;Lachesis&quot;, &quot;Calloselasma&quot;, and some &quot;Trimeresurus&quot; species. All egg-laying crotalines are believed to guard their eggs.

Brood sizes range from two for very small species, to as many as 86 for the fer-de-lance, &quot;Bothrops atrox&quot;, which is among the most prolific of all live-bearing snakes.

Many young crotalines have brightly coloured tails that contrast dramatically with the rest of their bodies. These tails are known to be used by a number of species in a behavior known as caudal luring; the young snakes make worm-like movements with their tails to lure unsuspecting prey within striking distance. 

==Taxonomy==
In the past, the pit vipers were usually classed as a separate family: the Crotalidae. Today, however, the monophyly of the viperines and the crotalines as a whole is undisputed, which is why they are treated here as a subfamily of the Viperidae.

<text>Nikolaus Erik Auf der Maur (April 10, 1942 – April 7, 1998) was a Canadian journalist and politician from Montreal, Quebec. He was the father of rock musician Melissa Auf der Maur.

== Early life ==
Auf der Maur was born in 1942, the youngest of four children of Swiss German immigrants J. Severin and Theresa Auf der Maur. 

==Journalist==
Auf der Maur was on the staff of the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; as a regular columnist. When the &quot;Montreal Star&quot; ceased operation in 1977, most of the staff of the Gazette moved into the Star building on Saint-Jacques Street. His daughter Melissa Auf der Maur was a frequent subject of his newspaper columns as she was growing up. Melissa once observed that she had been known her whole life as Nick Auf der Maur&#x27;s daughter, until she became the bassist for Hole, whereupon he became known as Melissa Auf der Maur&#x27;s father.

Auf der Maur was also a television personality, serving as co-host of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s &quot;Quelque-Show&quot; with Les Nirenberg during the early 1970s. He worked for CJAD-AM radio.

==Politician==
As a young man, Auf der Maur participated in left-wing politics. While working as a story editor at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, he and his producer were arrested under the War Measures Act during the October Crisis. His cell was across from that of future Parti Québécois cabinet minister Gérald Godin. He was not charged.

In 1974, he was elected as a city councillor for Montreal for the &quot;Montreal Citizens&#x27; Movement&quot;. His campaign manager in his first election campaign was Stuart McLean. In 1976, he formed the &quot;Alliance démocratique&quot; (Democratic Alliance) party and ran as a candidate in the 1976 provincial election; the party won no seats and soon disbanded. In 1978 and 1982, he was again elected city councillor for the Municipal Action Group, and in 1986 was re-elected as an independent candidate. In the 1984 federal election, he ran as a Progressive Conservative candidate in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, and although the Conservatives won that election in a landslide, including many Quebec seats, Auf der Maur failed to win his seat.

Auf der Maur was a frequent candidate in provincial and federal elections in Quebec, never successfully. He changed political affiliation often. He accurately predicted the massive cost overruns and deficits of the 1976 Summer Olympics held in Montreal, and was a sharp critic of longtime mayor Jean Drapeau. In 1987 Auf der Maur controversially supported the Overdale development, which saw nearly 100 of his constituents evicted from their homes, which were then demolished in 1989.

In 1988, he briefly joined the Civic Party of retired former mayor Jean Drapeau, to whom he had previously been bitterly opposed. He left that party a year later, eventually joining the Montreal Municipal Party, an evolution of the Municipal Action Group. Following a merger of the Montreal Municipal Party and the old Civic Party in 1992, he again became part of the new Civic Party, but again left a year later. In 1994, he ran in his final election as an independent, and was defeated. Columnist Allan Fotheringham wrote that half the voters in Montreal thought Auf der Maur was a joke and the other half thought he was a legend. 

== Personal life and death ==
In 1972, he had a child with dramaturg Linda Gaboriau. He did not meet his daughter, Melissa Auf der Maur, until she was three. He married Gaboriau when Melissa was five, and they were divorced in less than a year.

Auf der Maur was a regular at various downtown Montreal bars, and often transacted official and unofficial business there. 

In November 1996, Courtney Love&#x27;s estranged father Hank Harrison was in Montreal to promote a film that made veiled accusations against Love&#x27;s alleged involvement in the death of Kurt Cobain. While Harrison was speaking at a press conference, Auf der Maur took the microphone away and denounced Harrison causing a scene in his hometown.

Known for his smoking, drinking, and fighting, he was diagnosed with throat cancer in December 1996 and died in 1998. His funeral at St. Patrick&#x27;s Basilica was attended by nearly 3,000 people. He was interred in the Cimetière Notre-Dame-des-Neiges in Montreal, Quebec.

He was strongly opposed to the practice of renaming streets after well-known individuals. Therefore, after his death, when it was decided to honour him with a street name, it was necessary to find a street with no name. A small alley off of Rue Crescent, at whose bars Auf der Maur was a regular, was therefore renamed Ruelle Nick-Auf der Maur.

==Books==
He wrote the book &quot;The Billion-Dollar Game: Jean Drapeau and the 1976 Olympics&quot; (). He was a co-author, along with Robert Chodos and Rae Murphy, of the 1984 book &quot;Brian Mulroney: The Boy from Baie Comeau&quot;, a biography of the new Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney. He edited &quot;Quebec: A Chronicle 1968-1972&quot; () along with Robert Chodos, which is a collection of articles from the &quot;Last Post&quot;, a short-lived left-leaning English publication in Quebec during the 1970s.

He is the subject of the book &quot;Nick: A Montreal Life&quot; (), a collection of his columns published posthumously by the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;. The introduction was written by his long-time friend Mordecai Richler, and contains over 20 caricatures of Auf der Maur drawn by political cartoonist Aislin.

<text>The red-necked falcon (Falco chicquera) is a bird of prey in the falcon family with two disjunct populations, one in India and the other in Africa. This medium-sized falcon has bluish grey wings and upper body, a chestnut red cap with short chin straps passing through the eye. The primary feathers of the wing are black and a single black band at the tip of the tail are distinctive. The Indian subspecies &quot;Falco chicquera chicquera&quot; also known as the red-headed merlin or red-headed falcon is found mainly in the open plains of the India Subcontinent although it is thought to have occurred further west in southeastern Iran. The subspecies &quot;Falco chicquera ruficollis&quot; found in sub-Saharan Africa is sometimes treated as a full species, the rufous-necked falcon (&quot;Falco ruficollis&quot;), on the basis of its well-separated geographic range and distinctive pattern. It appears very similar to the Indian form but has dark barring on the upperparts, a rufous breast band, and black moustachial and eye stripes. As in most falcons, the females are larger and falconers in India called the female &quot;turumti&quot; and the male as &quot;chatwa&quot;. They hunt in pairs mostly at dawn and dusk, capturing small birds, bats and squirrels.

==Description==
The red-necked falcon is a medium-sized, long-winged species with a bright rufous crown and nape. It is on average in length with a wingspan of . The wings and upper parts are bluish grey and the tail has narrow bars, a broad subterminal black band tipped with white. The wingtip does not reach the tip of the tail at rest. The second and third primaries are the longest and almost equal in length while the first is a fourth the length. The first two primaries are notched. The legs, ceres and eyering are yellow. The tip of the bill is black while the basal portion is greenish yellow. The voice of this species is a shrill &quot;ki-ki-ki-ki&quot;. The sexes are similar except in size, males are smaller than females as is usual in falcons. Young birds are buff below with less extensive barring and duller upper plumage.

===Subspecies===
The adult of the African subspecies &quot;Falco chicquera ruficollis&quot; (a full species, &quot;F. ruficollis&quot;, in many treatments) first described by William Swainson in 1837 has a white face apart from black on the moustachial stripe. The upperparts are pale grey, with black primary wing feathers and the broad tail band. The underparts are white with dark barring on the underwings, lower breast, belly and undertail. There is a rufous foreneck band (not present in the Indian form). West African males are known to weigh between 139 and 178 grams, while females are found between 190 and 305 grams. The particularly large African birds from south of the Zambezi River are often separated as subspecies &quot;Falco chicquera horsbrughi&quot;, which was described by J. W. B. Gunning &amp; Austin Roberts in 1911 on the basis of a single specimen, but the size variation may be clinal and the subspecies may not be valid.

The Asian nominate subspecies &quot;Falco chicquera chicquera&quot; has rufous moustachial stripes, lacks the buff breast band, and is less extensively barred than the African form.

== Taxonomy ==

The species was described on the basis of a specimen obtained by François Levaillant from Chandernagore in Bengal where he was told it went by the name of Chicquera. This local name was probably attributed to this species by mistake as the name probably referred to a shikra. Levaillant did not use binomials but called it Le Chicquera and François Marie Daudin gave it the binomial &quot;Falco chicquera&quot; in 1800. Early authors placed it in the genus &quot;Aesalon&quot; along with the merlin and later in the genus &quot;Lithofalco&quot;. Others have placed it in the genus &quot;Chicquera&quot; or &quot;Hypotriorchis&quot;.

Studies of molecular sequence divergence in the cytochrome b gene suggest that the African and Indian forms are distinctive due to separation for as long as 0.9 million years. With non-overlapping ranges they are often treated as full species.

== Habitat and distribution ==
In Africa, the red-necked falcon is found in semi-desert, savannah and other dry open country with some trees, but also riverine forest. It often perches and makes use of the crowns of Borassus palms (&quot;Borassus aethiopum&quot;) for breeding. They are mostly resident but may make nomadic movements in response to weather. In India, they are found in open habitats and is not found in dense forests or high hills. The nominate subspecies is believed to have occurred west until Iran although no records exist from there since 1970. They were recorded breeding in 1911 by Nikolai Zarudny. It is a winter vagrant in northern Sri Lanka where it was first recorded by E.L. Layard.

== Behaviour ==
The red-necked falcon usually hunts in pairs, often at dawn and dusk, sometimes utilizing a technique in which one of the pair flies low and flushes up small birds while the other follows higher up and seizes the prey as it flushes from cover. They fly with a fast and dashing flight.

It prefers to prey on birds found in open areas and some of the species it has been recorded to hunt are Eurasian tree sparrow (&quot;Passer montanus&quot;), house sparrow (&quot;Passer domesticus&quot;), white-browed wagtail (&quot;Motacilla madaraspatensis&quot;), rosy starling (&quot;Sturnus roseus&quot;), chestnut-tailed starling (&quot;Sturnus malabaricus&quot;), Indian cuckoo (&quot;Cuculus micropterus&quot;), Kentish plover (&quot;Charadrius alexandrinus&quot;), little ringed plover (&quot;Charadrius dubius&quot;), ashy-crowned finch-lark (&quot;Eremoptrix griseus&quot;), besides robins, quails, babblers, swifts, bulbuls, pipits, larks (mainly &quot;Calandrella&quot;, &quot;Alauda&quot;, &quot;Galerida&quot; sp.), pied cuckoo (&quot;Clamator jacobinus&quot;), rock dove (&quot;Columba livia&quot;), collared dove (&quot;Streptopelia decaocto&quot;), laughing dove (&quot;Streptopelia senegelensis&quot;), brown crake (&quot;Lanius cristatus&quot;), tailor bird (&quot;Orthotomus sutorius&quot;), brown shrike (&quot;Lanius cristatus&quot;), white-breasted kingfisher (&quot;Halcyon smyrnensis&quot;), little stint (&quot;Calidris minuta&quot;), plain martin (&quot;Riparia paludicola&quot;) and pied bushchat (&quot;Saxicola caprata&quot;). In addition mice, lizards, large insects are also taken. In one study in Bangladesh, adults fed mainly on small sparrow sized birds (72%) and &quot;Pipistrellus&quot; bats (28%). They may sometimes pirate prey obtained by other medium-sized raptors. Prey may sometimes be cached and eaten subsequently.

The red-necked falcon drinks water where available during the afternoons. This has been observed both in India and in Africa, where it sometimes visits waterholes.

The breeding season in India is January to March. In Zambia, the breeding season begins in August. Pairs may indulge in courtship feeding in which the female feeds the male, an unusual behaviour that has also been noted in captivity. This falcon usually reuses the old tree nest platforms, particularly of corvids, or lays its 3-5 eggs in a nest that it builds on the fork of a tall tree or in the crown of a palm tree. In Africa, they have been known to reuse the nests of pied crows (&quot;Corvus albus&quot;), African fish eagles (&quot;Halieaetus vocifer&quot;) on &quot;Acacia&quot; apart from building their own nest in &quot;Borassus&quot; palms. In India, the nest is often placed in a large mango tree (&quot;Mangifera indica&quot;) and concealed inside foliage. The nest territory is well-guarded and crows and kites driven away. This falcon has been documented to nests in trees amidst dense human population. The clutch consists of two to four eggs which are incubated only by the female which begins after the last egg of the clutch is laid. The eggs hatch after about 32 to 34 days and the newly hatched young are covered in white down and are brooded by the female for a week. The male brings food which is torn by the female and fed to the chicks. The young fledge in about 35 to 37 days in Africa and up to 48 days in India.

== In falconry ==
The turumti was a favourite among Indian falconers who would fly it especially at the Indian roller which would make evasive aerial manoeuvres that entertained the onlookers. These falcons were caught using a bal-chatri, as they not only captured prey in the air like other falcons, but will also pursue on the ground and thereby could get entangled in the horsehair nooses. Turumta was a name used in Iran for the merlin.

== Parasites and diseases ==
Captive birds can be affected by Newcastle disease virus, as well as many parasites including &quot;Trichomonas&quot; (in subsp. &quot;ruficollis&quot;) and nematodes such as &quot;Cyrnea eurycerca&quot;.

<doc id="581560" wikidata="Q3071715" url="?curid=581560" title="Isogonal figure">
<text>In geometry, a polytope (e.g. a polygon or polyhedron) or a tiling is isogonal or vertex-transitive if all its vertices are equivalent under the symmetries of the figure. This implies that each vertex is surrounded by the same kinds of face in the same or reverse order, and with the same angles between corresponding faces.

Technically, one says that for any two vertices there exists a symmetry of the polytope mapping the first isometrically onto the second. Other ways of saying this are that the group of automorphisms of the polytope &quot;acts transitively&quot; on its vertices, or that the vertices lie within a single &quot;symmetry orbit&quot;.

All vertices of a finite -dimensional isogonal figure exist on an -sphere.

The term isogonal has long been used for polyhedra. Vertex-transitive is a synonym borrowed from modern ideas such as symmetry groups and graph theory.

The pseudorhombicuboctahedronwhich is &quot;not&quot; isogonaldemonstrates that simply asserting that &quot;all vertices look the same&quot; is not as restrictive as the definition used here, which involves the group of isometries preserving the polyhedron or tiling.

==Isogonal polygons and apeirogons==

All regular polygons, apeirogons and regular star polygons are &quot;isogonal&quot;. The dual of an isogonal polygon is an isotoxal polygon.

Some even-sided polygons and apeirogons which alternate two edge lengths, for example a rectangle, are &quot;isogonal&quot;.

All planar isogonal 2&quot;n&quot;-gons have dihedral symmetry (D&quot;n&quot;, &quot;n&quot; = 2, 3, ...) with reflection lines across the mid-edge points.

==Isogonal polyhedra and 2D tilings==
An isogonal polyhedron and 2D tiling has a single kind of vertex. An isogonal polyhedron with all regular faces is also a uniform polyhedron and can be represented by a vertex configuration notation sequencing the faces around each vertex. Geometrically distorted variations of uniform polyhedra and tilings can also be given the vertex configuration.

Isogonal polyhedra and 2D tilings may be further classified:

* &quot;Regular&quot; if it is also isohedral (face-transitive) and isotoxal (edge-transitive); this implies that every face is the same kind of regular polygon.
* &quot;Quasi-regular&quot; if it is also isotoxal (edge-transitive) but not isohedral (face-transitive).
* &quot;Semi-regular&quot; if every face is a regular polygon but it is not isohedral (face-transitive) or isotoxal (edge-transitive). (Definition varies among authors; e.g. some exclude solids with dihedral symmetry, or nonconvex solids.)
* &quot;Uniform&quot; if every face is a regular polygon, i.e. it is regular, quasiregular or semi-regular.
* &quot;Semi-uniform&quot; if its elements are also isogonal.
* &quot;Scaliform&quot; if all the edges are the same length.
* &quot;Noble&quot; if it is also isohedral (face-transitive).

==&quot;N&quot; dimensions: Isogonal polytopes and tessellations==
These definitions can be extended to higher-dimensional polytopes and tessellations. All uniform polytopes are &quot;isogonal&quot;, for example, the uniform 4-polytopes and convex uniform honeycombs.

The dual of an isogonal polytope is an isohedral figure, which is transitive on its facets.

==&quot;k&quot;-isogonal and &quot;k&quot;-uniform figures==
A polytope or tiling may be called k&quot;-isogonal if its vertices form &quot;k&quot; transitivity classes. A more restrictive term, k&quot;-uniform is defined as a &quot;k-isogonal figure&quot; constructed only from regular polygons. They can be represented visually with colors by different uniform colorings.

<text>Rudolph Ernst Boesch ( ; January 20, 1928 – November 1, 2019) was a United States Navy SEAL, and two-time competitor on the reality competition show &quot;Survivor&quot;.

Born and raised in Rochester, New York, Boesch enlisted in the United States Navy at age 17. He became an Underwater Demolition Team (UDT) Frogman in 1951, serving on two UDT Teams. He was chosen as one of the first SEALs, becoming chief of the boat of newly created SEAL Team TWO in 1962. Starting in 1968 and 1970, Boesch completed two combat deployments during the Vietnam War, where he earned the Bronze Star for heroic action. During that time and later, Boesch set physical and operational standards at SEAL Team TWO. In 1987, he became Senior Enlisted Advisor for United States Special Operations Command. Designated the &quot;Bullfrog&quot;, the longest-serving SEAL still on active duty, Boesch achieved considerable renown within the force for his physical fitness training regimens and his military appearance. After 45 years of continuous service, he retired from the Navy in 1990 as a master chief petty officer.

The oldest competitor on the inaugural &quot;&quot; at 72 years of age, Boesch finished in third place. The program was the top-rated show on American television during summer 2000, and with his gruff, cantankerous manner, and his politically incorrect &quot;Rudyisms&quot;, he became one of the show&#x27;s most popular contestants. Boesch set the age record again when he competed on &quot;&quot; at 75. He parlayed his fame into several other television appearances, including hosting the show &quot;Combat Missions&quot; in 2002. He died from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2019.

== Early life ==
Boesch was born in Rochester, New York on January 20, 1928, the son of Austrian immigrants Clara (a housewife) and August (a butcher). Boesch credited his parents&#x27; Central European upbringing for instilling him with discipline and work ethic. He attended a Catholic primary school in Rochester; he later recalled that the nuns teaching there &quot;beat intelligence into you. We did a little bit of everything – arithmetic, geography, honesty. Those were the things we learned.&quot; Boesch&#x27;s father fought for the German Army during World War I, inspiring him to seek military service as well.

==Military career==
Too young to join the Marines, Boesch dropped out of high school and enlisted in the United States Navy in April 1945 at age 17. Following boot camp at Naval Training Station Sampson in New York, he volunteered for the Amphibious Scouts and Raiders at Fort Pierce, Florida, where he was tentatively assigned to conduct covert reconnaissance of China&#x27;s coastline.

The Second World War ended before the training completed, but he was still sent to China. For a while he and a few others guarded a decommissioned ship in Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong. He then had a tour as a boatswain&#x27;s mate (BM) on board USS &quot;Massey&quot;, a destroyer ported on the Chinese coast. That was followed by a period of shore duty in London. He volunteered for UDT Frogman training in late 1950, graduating in Underwater Demolition Team Replacement Class #6 in 1951.

Boesch met his future wife, Marge, at a wedding circa 1950–1951. They married in 1955 and had three daughters in the following years. Meanwhile, he served in UDT Team 2 and later UDT Team 21 alongside Richard Marcinko.

In 1962, Roy Boehm selected Boesch, a Chief Boatswain&#x27;s Mate (BMC), to be chief of the boat of newly created SEAL Team Two. One of the first opportunities for the team came later that year during the Cuban Missile Crisis, when they were put on alert for possible action. Orr Kelly&#x27;s 1995 &quot;Never Fight Fair: Navy SEALs&#x27; Stories of Combat and Adventure&quot; contains a description by Marcinko, also a member of the team, of a near-suicidal mission that never took place – to parachute into Havana Harbor and attack strategic targets – and of Boesch fielding direct calls from President John F. Kennedy inquiring as to their readiness. In 1967, Boesch was promoted to the rank of master chief petty officer.

In 1968, Boesch was sent on a combat deployment to the Vietnam War, as a platoon chief based in Mỹ Tho in the Mekong Delta. The general combat mission of SEALs in Vietnam was to do intelligence gathering and to conduct raids and ambushes and make prisoner grabs. In Boesch&#x27;s own 1995 retelling, he did all those things on that tour. In the 2010 Vietnam-era memoir &quot;SEAL Warrior: The Only Easy Day Was Yesterday&quot;, Thomas Keith describes Boesch leading a platoon in nighttime ambush raids against the Viet Cong during the war, operating in the delta and using LCM-8 &quot;Mike boats&quot; for access. Boesch earned the Bronze Star for heroic action during more than 45 combat operations. Another primary mission for SEALs during the conflict was to train South Vietnamese special forces. When Boesch deployed to Vietnam again, in 1970, as he later related, he was sent to Cam Ranh Bay, where he conducted training for the Liên Đoàn Người Nhái, the South Vietnamese equivalent of the UDT, as part of the so-called &quot;Vietnamization&quot; strategy. Boesch later concluded that these allied forces were capable, but overly dependent upon the U.S., and that &quot;Vietnamization was an idea that came too late to do enough good.&quot;

Between the Vietnam deployments, Boesch trained and competed for the U.S. Navy&#x27;s bobsled team. One was the Kennedy Memorial Winter Games in Lake Placid, New York, in early 1970. Boesch also competed with the Hurricane Bobsled Club of the Adirondacks in competitions at Lake Placid.

During and after his stint in Vietnam, Boesch set physical and operational standards at SEAL Team Two. With the creation of Special Operations Command (SOCOM) in 1987, its first Commander-in-chief General James J. Lindsay selected BMCM Boesch to serve as SOCOM&#x27;s first Senior Enlisted Advisor. Before his retirement, Boesch was designated the &quot;Chief SEAL&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Bull Frog&quot;), a title identifying the longest-serving SEAL still on active duty. Upon his retirement from the Navy on August 1, 1990, as a command master chief petty officer, he was awarded the Defense Superior Service Medal.

Boesch&#x27;s time and character as a SEAL has been described in a number of books and other publications. Editor Bill Fawcett included his story as the opening, 30-page recollection in his 1995 &quot;Hunters &amp; Shooters: An Oral History of the U.S. Navy SEALs in Vietnam&quot;. Orr Kelly&#x27;s aforementioned 1995 volume included descriptions by Rudy (and Marge as well) of their parachuting experiences, along with a few of Rudy&#x27;s recollections of Vietnam. In his 1998 memoir, &quot;Good to Go: The Life and Times of a Decorated Member of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Elite SEAL Team Two&quot;, former SEAL Harry Constance describes Boesch as giving a no-nonsense introduction to SEALs in training and then later giving him informal advice not to take a posting that would involve troublesome superiors. A 1999 documentary on the SEALs on the History channel featured Boesch (it was released later that year as the DVD &quot;The Complete History of the U.S. Navy SEALs&quot;). In an early 2000s interview, a SEAL said that Boesch was &quot;a walking Bible on Special Operations.&quot; In his aforementioned 2010 memoir, Thomas Keith portrayed Boesch as a master of the military art of gathering resources: &quot;From weapons to the men who would use them, Rudy could scrounge like nobody else in the SEAL Teams. He wasn&#x27;t going to let anything or anybody get in the way of putting together the best platoon he could build, beg, borrow, coerce, or dig out of the Operations Department.&quot;

Boesch was a physical training fanatic whose dog tag listed &quot;PT&quot; as his religion and who through the decades gained a reputation for leading grueling runs that men would look for ways to avoid by faking injuries or hiding in bushes. In former SEAL James Watson&#x27;s 1995 memoir &quot;Point Man&quot;, he states of 1964 training that, &quot;We had to be physically fit to perform what was expected of us. And for all our trying [to get out of the runs], Rudy Boesch made sure that we stayed in condition.&quot; Kevin Dockery&#x27;s 2003 work &quot;Navy Seals: A History Part III – Post-Vietnam to the Present&quot; includes three different SEALs relating how, when Boesch was 50 to 57 years old, he could keep up with or surpass trainees less than half his age in five-mile runs, obstacle courses, and open sea swimming. In his 2011 memoir, &quot;SEAL Team Six: Memoirs of an Elite Navy SEAL Sniper&quot;, former SEAL Howard E. Wasdin tells of being assigned to SEAL Team TWO in the late 1980s, where Boesch, though nearly 60 years old, nevertheless ran with the trainees over an obstacle course; he then made every person who finished behind him run it again. Even Boesch&#x27;s physical appearance made a mark: Wasdin refers to him as an exemplar of military form; another account talks of his haircut and uniform being perfect at 5 or 6 o&#x27;clock in the morning; and, in 2002&#x27;s &quot;One Perfect Op&quot;, former SEAL Dennis Chalker said that, among SEALs based on the U.S. East Coast in the late 1970s, the style was known as a &quot;Rudy Boesch haircut&quot;, an even more severe version of the normal military crew cut.

Overall, in his history of SEAL operations in Vietnam, former SEAL T.L. Bosiljevac writes that Boesch symbolizes much of what the SEAL teams represent and that, &quot;There are a lot of colorful personalities among the teams, but even considering the best of those, Rudy Boesch is a legend. Everybody knows Rudy, and you can bet that Rudy knows everyone in return ... [including] some of the Navy&#x27;s top brass.&quot; Several of these other accounts have also referred to Boesch as a legend within the SEALs.

==&quot;Survivor&quot;==
===&quot;Borneo&quot;===

In 2000, Boesch appeared in &quot;&quot;, the name later assigned to the inaugural season of the U.S. version of &quot;Survivor&quot;, filmed on the remote Malaysian island of Pulau Tiga. Initially placed with Tagi tribe, he befriended the former West Point student Richard Hatch. Despite his discomfort with Hatch&#x27;s homosexuality and penchant for nudity, Boesch aligned with Hatch and admonished his tribemates to &quot;shut up and let [Hatch] lead.&quot; Despite his earlier life of athleticism, Boesch struggled against the ageism of the younger castaways and needed Richard&#x27;s alliance for his own safety.

Boesch found his niche in camp life cooking for his tribe, using the resourcefulness learned from his tours in Vietnam. His preparation area was dubbed &quot;Rowdy Rudy&#x27;s Diner&quot;. While his tribemates relied on boiling water to avoid pathogens, he drank unpurified water, advising, &quot;If I&#x27;m not still standing at noon, don&#x27;t drink it&quot;, and explaining that his lack of fear was based on his having drunk much fouler water in Vietnam. At the final challenge for tribal immunity, he single-handedly sprinted with a heavy wooden chest across the beach to seal his tribe&#x27;s victory. He also won an individual immunity challenge by defeating the other competitors on a human-sized checkerboard.

Going into the final immunity challenge, Rudy was the most popular player remaining in the game. Thus, he was the favorite to win the million-dollar prize provided he made it to the final Tribal Council. Host Jeff Probst and the show&#x27;s production staff thought Rudy was likely to win the final challenge and the game. In the final challenge, competitors had to stand in the hot sun for hours while touching an idol. Richard made a strategic move to drop out of the challenge early, while Rudy fatigued himself by competing for four hours, before inadvertently dropping his hand from the idol, which led to his elimination. This left 23-year-old Kelly Wiglesworth the challenge victor, and she voted Boesch out of the game as she believed she had a better chance of defeating Hatch than Boesch at the Final Tribal Council. Despite his resentment about Hatch&#x27;s move, Boesch still voted for Hatch at the final tribal council, so Hatch became the first &quot;Survivor&quot; winner.

The Boesch weakened physically during the castaway experience, losing off his SEALs-era weight of that he started the show with, but unlike some of the other contestants, he did not get sick. He later said, &quot;the real survival part [for me] was putting up with the young kids who were there. I don&#x27;t speak their language.&quot;

The summer series had become the top-rated show on American television and the finale was watched by over 50 million people. As the show&#x27;s episodes aired, Boesch became one of the cast&#x27;s most popular contestants, and his appeal extended across all demographic groups. The &quot;Rudy&quot; persona was based around his gruff, cantankerous manner, his flattop haircut and stoic approach to life on the island, and to his being a man of his word. Blunt about survival needs, the Catholic, but non-church-attending Boesch memorably said that the only use for the Bible on the island was as toilet paper. His politically incorrect statements became known as &quot;Rudyisms&quot; and made him even more popular. By the time the final episode arrived and four contestants were left, 69 percent of the viewing public wanted Rudy to win.

After the airing of the show, while praising Hatch as &quot;forthright, trustworthy&quot; and &quot;humorous and kind-hearted,&quot; Boesch became publicly known for how he would always qualify his respect for Hatch with comments such as &quot;we&#x27;ve become real good friends, but not in a homosexual way.&quot; Boesch would proclaim in front of the cameras, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t allow Hatch in my home; wouldn&#x27;t allow him to meet my family&quot; and, referring to when some Green Berets came to build an obstacle course, &quot;When them Green Berets were here, I made sure they knew Hatch was queer.&quot;

Following the initial season of &quot;Survivor&quot;, there were two elements of controversy raised that involved Boesch. One was a claim from a voted-out contestant that show producer Mark Burnett had at one point influenced tribal council members to vote her out and not Rudy, because he had more appeal to viewers. This was adamantly denied by Burnett and CBS. Another was a claim from a different cast member that Boesch had told them that he had known Burnett before the show. By some accounts, Boesch had been cast by responding to a newspaper advertisement. However, he had also previously worked in 1996 as part of the logistics team for Burnett&#x27;s earlier adventure race show &quot;Eco-Challenge&quot;. Boesch said several hundred others had also worked on the show in that capacity and that he had not known Burnett personally, and Burnett said he had not realized Boesch&#x27;s earlier involvement until after &quot;Survivor&quot; had begun.

===&quot;All-Stars&quot;===

In 2004, Boesch appeared in &quot;&quot;, set on the Pearl Islands of Panama. At age 75, Boesch was the oldest contestant ever, topping the record he set four years prior. Initially placed in the Saboga tribe, he formed an early alliance with Rupert Boneham and again drank potentially tainted water. After he complained of pain from an injured ankle and the tribe lost its second straight immunity challenge, other members became concerned about his age and ability to compete. In a 3–to–2 decision, he became the second person voted off the show placing 17th.

===Post-&quot;Survivor&quot; fame===

Boesch earned $85,000 for his third-place finish on &quot;Survivor&quot; and shared the money with his three daughters. But such was the immediate impact of the show that Boesch hired two agents to manage his personal appearances, which included magazine covers, talk shows, television commercials, and &quot;Survivor&quot; discussion panels. Boesch was honored by both his hometown of Virginia Beach as well as by the Commonwealth of Virginia, where he received a standing ovation in the Virginia House of Delegates after they passed a resolution commending his service. 
In November 2000, Boesch was included in &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual &quot;Sexiest Man Alive&quot; issue as the &quot;Sexiest Survivor&quot;, reflecting the number of female fans he had garnered.

In February 2001, Blue Box Toys put out a action figure of Boesch for its Elite Force Military History collection. He was also licensed to appear in a &quot;Survivor&quot; slot machine from WMS Gaming, wherein (when it came out several years later) if you hit his bonus, it shows a clip of him from the show. His book &quot;The Book of Rudy: The Wit and Wisdom of Rudy Boesch&quot;, written with the assistance of Jeff Herman, was published later in 2001 and he went on a twelve-city book tour to promote it. Neither an account of his time on &quot;Survivor&quot; nor a full biography, it was instead a collection of thoughts on various subjects.

In 2000, he appeared in the &quot;JAG&quot; television series episode &quot;The Princess and the Petty Officer&quot; as Rear Admiral (and then head of JAG) A.J. Chegwidden&#x27;s Navy SEAL instructor. In 2001 he hosted the History channel&#x27;s &quot;Modern Marvels&quot; installment &quot;Survivor Guide Week&quot;. His role consisted of standing in a desert and introducing experts who explained how to cope in a variety of survival scenarios. Boesch later hosted &quot;Combat Missions&quot;, a Mark Burnett-produced reality series that aired on the USA Network in 2002. He served as the titular commandant of &quot;Camp Windstorm&quot;, the garrison location in the Mojave Desert where the show took place. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that his hosting duties were &quot;one-dimensional&quot; and that, &quot;Looking menacing and acting rigorous, his only job is to explain rules and oversee discharges.&quot;

As someone who would never consider an acting career, Boesch felt challenged with the scripted lines given to him both on &quot;JAG&quot; and &quot;Combat Missions&quot;. Citing his inability to memorize dialogue, he explained &quot;anything over five words, I&#x27;m mumbling.&quot; He expressed that people recognized him wherever he goes, and that he was surprised his 15 minutes of fame had lasted this long.

==Later activities==
Boesch&#x27;s career had become known enough that mentions of him were included in novels about SEALs, including S. M. Gunn&#x27;s 2004 &quot;SEALs Sub Strike: Operation Black Snow&quot; and Charles Ingram&#x27;s 2007 &quot;Deep Siege&quot;. His uniform is on display at the National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum in Florida, a reflection both of his record-setting service with the SEALs and his fame from &quot;Survivor&quot;.

Boesch&#x27;s wife of 53 years, Marge, died on November 1, 2008, following a long illness. &quot;&quot; showed an &quot;In Memory&quot; dedication to Marge during its 8th episode.

Boesch remained one of the most popular contestants among &quot;Survivor&quot; viewers, with a survey of them after the show&#x27;s first ten seasons placing him among the top ten contestants. In 2013, &quot;Survivor&quot; fan site &quot;&quot;Survivor&quot; Oz&quot; ranked Boesch as among the top 25 greatest players of all time, at #23. In 2015, Boesch was one of three inductees into Xfinity&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Survivor&quot; Hall of Fame,&quot; alongside Jerri Manthey and Benjamin &quot;Coach&quot; Wade. In a 2015 retrospective interview, Probst said that the first season&#x27;s outcome, when the &quot;most likable and root-worthy guy&quot; Boesch failed to win and the villainous Hatch did, established that the game&#x27;s appeal to viewers did not depend upon the personal qualities of the victor and helped explain the show&#x27;s long-lasting appeal.

On October 27, 2010, Boesch was one of 14 initial inductees to the Commando Hall of Honor at Macdill Air Force Base. Boesch hosted the annual &quot;Rudy Run SEAL Challenge&quot; on Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek to raise funds for the charity Naval Special Warfare Foundation. He was represented by the Premier Speakers Bureau. Boesch&#x27;s perceived slurs towards homosexuals irked some, going back to the initial &quot;Survivor&quot; season. He was criticized for ostensibly homophobic comments he made both in 2012 at the 50th Anniversary of the SEALs and in 2013 at the season finale of &quot;&quot;.

By 2015, Boesch was living in a retirement community in Virginia Beach and leading his fellow residents in exercise-based activities.

==Death==
By August 2019, Boesch suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and required around-the-clock care. False reports of his demise surfaced on August 1, 2019, which were debunked by his family. Boesch died on November 1, 2019, at age 91.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; summarized his fame as &quot;An ex-Navy man, he was the oldest, and probably bluntest, castaway ever to appear on CBS’s popular reality show, becoming a Season 1 fan favorite.&quot;
Host Jeff Probst posted on Twitter, &quot;The Survivor family has lost a legend. ... He is one [of] the most iconic and adored players of all time. And he served our country as a 45-year Navy SEAL. Rudy is a true American hero.&quot;

The November 6, 2019 episode of &quot;&quot; included a brief, silent screen in tribute to him at the end of the episode.

<text>The Fool&#x27;s Errand is a 1987 computer game by Cliff Johnson. It is a meta-puzzle game with storytelling, visual puzzles, and a cryptic treasure map. It is the tale of a wandering Fool who seeks his fortune in the Land of Tarot and braves the enchantments of the High Priestess. A sequel titled &quot;The Fool and His Money&quot; was released October 25, 2012.

== Plot ==
The plot focuses on The Fool card of the tarot, who is portrayed as a silhouette of a young man wearing a peaked, feathered cap, curled-toed shoes, and carrying a knapsack on a stick. The Fool is the protagonist of the story, and he encounters various other cards from the tarot. In the beginning of the story, The Sun gives him a map, which has been scrambled, and directs him to find the &quot;Lost 14 Treasures of the World.&quot; The Fool journeys through four kingdoms (each representing a suit from the minor arcana of the tarot), where he encounters other characters, who either give him more information or provide him with additional tasks. The High Priestess card of the tarot is set up as the villain of the story, and all the characters he meets are other cards from the tarot. Each character is drawn as a black silhouette, as is the background art.

== Gameplay ==
The game is structured as a storybook divided into five parts, each containing a large number of different chapters; the storybook can be paged through and read as continuous prose on screen. However, not every chapter is available at the start of the game, and those chapters which are available are not consecutive. Many chapters have a puzzle (called an &quot;enchantment&quot;) associated with them; completing such a puzzle unlocks further chapter(s). Many of the chapters are named after a tarot card in either the Major Arcana or the Minor Arcana.

Frequently, the puzzles are designed in such a way that the result of the puzzle leads logically into the unlocked chapter; for example, the player may complete an &quot;acrostic puzzle&quot; which results in the phrase &quot;No Ship&quot;, which then unlocks part of the story in which a watchman indeed reports that no ship has been sighted and deals with the consequences. Other puzzles feature pictures which portray parts of the story or even clues to other puzzles.

The first chapter, &quot;The Sun&quot;, features the puzzle &quot;The Sun&#x27;s Map&quot;. This is a jigsaw puzzle with one piece for every chapter in the story; each puzzle piece appears only when the appropriate chapter is unlocked. Each piece contains a symbol representing the chapter from which it came, plus part of a continuous path which flows through all pieces in the order in which they are mentioned in the narrative. Once the map is successfully completed, other designs on the map become active click targets and can be used as clues or processes to decipher the true final puzzle: &quot;The Book Of Thoth&quot;, hidden within the chapter &quot;The High Priestess&quot;, which requires the reader to peruse the entire story as continuous prose and identify a number of phrases hidden within the narrative.

==Development==
Cliff Johnson, who at that point had worked as a filmmaker, was inspired by films like &quot;Sleuth&quot; and &quot;The Last of Sheila&quot; which included puzzle-mysteries for the viewer to solve; he aimed to host &quot;mystery&quot; dinner parties where players would uncover clues to find the hidden secrets.

The 1979 work &quot;Masquerade&quot; by Kit Williams served as further inspiration. The final chapter of the picture book revealed that the protagonist bunny had lost his treasure, and dared the reader to uncover the clues throughout the book to work out where on Earth it is located; this book sold over 2 million copies and while Johnson was not personally enamoured by the work he felt the idea behind it was exciting.

Johnson decided to create a similar work which he would distribute to his friends as a 1984 Christmas present. The concept, a series of puzzles and a narrative that fit together into an overarching mystery like a jigsaw, was an early incarnation of what became &quot;The Fool&#x27;s Errand&quot;. Having recently purchased his first PC, a Macintosh, Johnson began coding the game in 1985. He learned to program specifically to bring the idea to the interactive entertainment format. His goal was to “make the experience pleasant and solvable in a single afternoon.” His initial approach to programming was guided by his experience making animated film, which involved &quot;a very tedious frame-by-frame process&quot;, creating a blueprint and putting the pieces together to assemble the whole picture in a manner similar to a jigsaw puzzle.

Johnson took out a $50,000 loan to finance the project himself, and he had a nervous breakdown during development. By 1986 he had created over 30 individual data-driven programs, which he then had to convert into one application on &quot;ZBasic.&quot;

== Release ==
&quot;The Fool&#x27;s Errand&quot; was released in 1987 by Miles Publishing. The game saw slow sales initially, but, as positive reviews began to be published, more customers purchased the title. Electronic Arts took over the distribution, and it was ported to many other consoles. The game was also circulated illegally on file-sharing sites for many years.

Created with Microsoft BASIC and ZBasic for the Apple Macintosh, the game was ported to MS-DOS, Commodore Amiga and Atari ST. The ports add color, but in a lower resolution (320×200, as opposed to the original version&#x27;s 512×342). In 2002 the game was released as shareware, available for download from Johnson&#x27;s website Fools-errand.com. The game is now offered free of charge. Johnson advises PC-based players to download the Macintosh version and play using a Macintosh emulator. The non-Macintosh versions of the game were protected by a symbol-based code wheel. The free version currently offered by the author has this mechanism disabled: the challenge screen still appears, but any answer is accepted.

== Reception ==
&quot;The Fool&#x27;s Errand&quot; did not sell well at first, but after a very positive July 1988 review in &quot;MacUser&quot; it became very successful, causing Miles Computing to port the game to other platforms. 100,000 copies were sold by the end of 1989. The &quot;MacUser&quot; review gave the game five out of five mice, saying it &quot;goes beyond being &#x27;just&#x27; an excellent game&quot; and &quot;ventures into the realm of myth, into the prototypical lands of the epic legend, into the maelstrom of the Jungian archetype, and it returns to our world and offers us a way to extend ourselves beyond the boundaries of our normal existence.&quot; In December 1989, &quot;MacUser&quot; named &quot;The Fool&#x27;s Errand&quot; one of the 27 best games available for the Macintosh.

&quot;Macworld&quot; reviewed the game positively, calling it a difficult and epic collection of diverse puzzles that demanded &quot;considerable interaction and ingenuity.&quot; The review praised the attractive and unique presentation of the puzzles and the beautiful graphics of the animated prologue and finale. In a review for Cliff Johnson&#x27;s next game, &quot;At the Carnival&quot;, &quot;Macworld&quot; called &quot;The Fool&#x27;s Errand&quot; &quot;a new kind of computer game that transcends traditional categories.&quot;

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; praised the game, stating &quot;You feel like you&#x27;re matching wits with the author directly, instead of playing &#x27;hunt the parser&#x27;&quot;; the magazine&#x27;s Scorpia described it as &quot;one of the best games I&#x27;ve ever played&quot;. &quot;STart&quot;″s reviewer confessed that he had come close to finishing &quot;The Fool&#x27;s Errand&quot; but that &quot;I felt like I&#x27;d run, and lost, a mental marathon&quot;.

&quot;The Games Machine&quot; awarded the PC version of &quot;The Fool&#x27;s Errand&quot; its Golden Scroll and rated it 93%, calling it &quot;fresh, original and addictive&quot;. &quot;Game Player&#x27;s PC Strategy Guide&quot; reviewed the PC version positively, singling out the &quot;great graphics&quot;, &quot;consistent level of challenge&quot;, and above all the fact that the puzzles &quot;play fair&quot; with no obscurely hidden clues or tricks. &quot;.info&quot; magazine called the Amiga version of the game &quot;a magnificent achievement in game design&quot; but dropped the rating from five stars to three stars due to the poor quality of the port, with its unused right mouse button, &quot;insufferable EGA&quot; graphics and poor quality sounds. &quot;Amiga Format&quot; rated the game 70%, praising the &quot;sheer number and variety of the puzzles&quot; and calling it &quot;an intelligent use of the machine&quot; despite reservations about the graphics and sound quality.

=== Retrospective reviews ===
In 2004, &quot;Inside Mac Games&quot; selected &quot;The Fool&#x27;s Errand&quot; as one of the 20 games that made the biggest impact on the Macintosh, calling the game &quot;intriguing and visually-rich&quot;, with an &quot;original and compelling&quot; story that was &quot;thick with mysticism, witchcraft, folklore, and hints on how to solve the game&#x27;s final meta-puzzle&quot;. In 2007, &quot;Game Set Watch&quot; deemed it &quot;one of the greatest puzzle games in personal-computing history&quot;. In a 2012 interview with Johnson, &quot;Wired&quot; crowned it &quot;the greatest puzzle game of all time&quot;. In 2018, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; selected &quot;The Fool&#x27;s Errand&quot; for its weekly best free PC games feature, saying the &quot;whimsical fantasy&quot; would challenge the player&#x27;s brain.

&quot;GamesTM&quot; featured &quot;The Fool&#x27;s Errand&quot; in its &quot;Greatest Retro Game Ever&quot; column, calling it &quot;obscenely addictive&quot; and &quot;revered by nearly everyone&quot; who played it. In a 2013 feature on the evolution of puzzle video games, &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; called &quot;The Fool&#x27;s Errand&quot; an excellent strategy fantasy game with &quot;a well-crafted narrative&quot; that &quot;arguably paved the way for games like the &quot;Professor Layton&quot; series, which now feature similar narrative puzzles to solve.&quot;

===Awards===
&quot;The Fool&#x27;s Errand&quot; was inducted into the 1987 &quot;Macworld&quot; Game Hall of Fame as Best Brain-Teasing game. &quot;GAMES Magazine&quot; selected &quot;The Fool&#x27;s Errand&quot; as one of the best computer games of 1988, saying &quot;Some puzzles are easy, others tricky; all are charming and great fun to figure out.&quot;

&quot;VideoGames &amp; Computer Entertainment&quot; named &quot;The Fool&#x27;s Errand&quot; Best Computer Strategy Game of 1988, ahead of runners-up &quot;Prime Time&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Solitaire Royale&quot;. The magazine praised &quot;The Fool&#x27;s Errand&quot; as &quot;the most clever framework for an anthology of word games and puzzles ever devised.&quot;

The editors of &quot;Game Player&#x27;s PC Strategy Guide&quot; presented the game with their 1990 &quot;Best PC Puzzle Game&quot; award. They wrote, &quot;One of the best puzzle games ever produced — everything from mazes to cryptograms worked into an elaborate, witty narrative, and presented with exceptional graphic flair.

<text>I Think We&#x27;re All Bozos on This Bus is the fourth comedy album made by the Firesign Theatre for Columbia Records, released in August 1971 on standard stereo vinyl LP, and Quadraphonic LP and 8-track tape. It was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in 1972 by the World Science Fiction Society.

The title comes from a line spoken by one of the two main characters, and contains a pun on the term &quot;computer bus&quot; since the story parodies then-developing computer technology. It also parodies Walt Disney parks.

==Plot==
This album, like its predecessor &quot;Don&#x27;t Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers&quot;, is one complete narrative that covers both sides of one LP. The first LP side is 20 minutes 51 seconds, and the second side is 18 minutes 7 seconds.

Side one starts with an audio segue from the end of &quot;Don&#x27;t Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers&quot;: the music box tune played by the ice cream truck chased by George Tirebiter is heard approaching, played this time by a bus announcing a free Future Fair, which it touts as &quot;a fair for all, and no fare to anybody&quot;. A trio of computer-generated holograms pop up outside the bus: the Whispering Squash (Phil Austin), the Lonesome Beet (David Ossman), and Artie Choke (Peter Bergman), singing &quot;We&#x27;re back from the shadows again&quot; to the tune of Gene Autry&#x27;s &quot;Back in the Saddle Again&quot;. They encourage the onlookers to attend the fair, which the Beet describes as &quot;technical stimulation&quot; and &quot;government-inflicted simulation&quot;. Then they disappear &quot;back to the shadows again&quot;. A young man named Clem (Philip Proctor) boards and takes a seat next to Barney (Austin), an older man who identifies himself as a bozo (A person with a large nose that honks when squeezed. FST later revealed that &quot;bozo&quot; is an acronym for &quot;brotherhood of zips and others,&quot; and that a &quot;zip&quot; is the type of person who enjoys doing their own taxes.); he says, &quot;I think we&#x27;re &quot;all&quot; bozos on this bus.&quot; After a stewardess tells the passengers to prepare for &quot;a period of simulated exhilaration&quot;, broadcaster Floyd Dan (Bergman) tells them they are riding the rim of the Grand Canyon, the floor of which is five thousand feet below. The &quot;bus&quot; is apparently some sort of hybrid vehicle that can travel on the ground, yet turn into a jet plane which takes off for a &quot;flight to the future&quot;.

As Clem and Barney disembark at the fair, a public address announcer directs all bozos to report for cloning, so Barney leaves Clem. The Lonesome Beet pops up and recommends Clem visit the Wall of Science. He boards a moving walkway taking him to the exhibit, which opens with a parody of religious creation myth and segues into a brief overview of history from ancient times to the emergence of mankind, then to the modern scientific era. Two scientific discoveries are reenacted: Fudd&#x27;s First Law of Opposition (&quot;If you push something hard enough, it will fall over&quot;), and Teslicle&#x27;s Deviant (&quot;What comes in, must go out&quot;). Then recordings of selected audience members&#x27; reactions to the future are played.

Next, the Honorable Chester Cadaver (Ossman) addresses the audience, and relates a meeting with Senator Clive Brown (Bergman), who demonstrates a &quot;model government&quot; consisting of a model train-sized automated maze of bureaucracies which terminates with an animatronic President as the output bus, whom Brown says everyone asks questions. When Cadaver asks Clem to state his name, he stammers slightly and says &quot;Uh, Clem&quot;, and the central computer permanently identifies him throughout the park as &quot;Uh, Clem&quot;. As side 1 closes, Clem is directed onto another moving walkway which takes him in to see &quot;the President&quot;.

Side two opens with the exhibit of &quot;the President&quot; (Austin), who sounds like Richard Nixon. Each visitor is asked to speak their name, which is then played back to appear as if the president is addressing them by name. A black welfare recipient named Jim (Bergman) relates his family&#x27;s harsh urban living conditions and asks the President where he can get a job. The President responds with a vague, positive-sounding reply only remotely related to the question and completely unrelated to Jim&#x27;s concerns, and Jim is given the &quot;bum&#x27;s rush&quot;. When it is Clem&#x27;s turn, he puts the President into maintenance mode by saying, &quot;This is Worker speaking. Hello.&quot; The computer responds with the length of time that it has been running. Clem then gets access to Doctor Memory (the master control), and attempts to confuse the system with a riddle: &quot;Why does the porridge bird lay his egg in the air?&quot; This causes the President to shut itself down. As Clem leaves, an Hispanic visitor is heard to say &quot;He broke the President!&quot;.

Clem meets up with Barney back on the Funway. They encounter sideshows such as astronaut Mark Time (Ossman) recruiting a crew for a trip to the Haunted Space Station, and Hideo Nutt&#x27;s Bolt-a-drome, where fairgoers are invited to participate in boxing matches with electrical appliances such as water heaters and toasters. Public announcers repeatedly page &quot;Mr. Ah Clem&quot; to come to the &quot;hospitality shelter&quot;, and Artie Choke pops up again, programmed to take lost children back to their parents. He says he will send Deputy Dan to take Clem to the hospitality shelter. Clem then uses Artie to create a clone of himself which enters the system for another confrontation with Dr. Memory. He repeats his porridge bird riddle, which the computer struggles with several attempts to parse, finally mangling it into &quot;Why does the poor rich Barney delay laser&#x27;s edge in the fair?&quot; Clem succeeds in confusing the computer into contradicting itself, causing a total crash which ends the fair with a display of fireworks.

The entire experience is then revealed to be a vision seen in the crystal ball of a Gypsy doctor (Proctor) telling Barney his fortune. After Barney leaves, the Gypsy plots with his partner (Bergman) to make a quick escape after their last client, a sailor.

==Portrayal of theme parks and computer technology==
The fair rides and exhibits are similar to those at Disneyland and the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair.

Clem is one of the first &quot;computer hackers&quot; mentioned in pop culture, and his dialogue with the fair&#x27;s computer includes messages found in the DEC PDP-10, a popular mainframe at the time. (Some of the lines are error messages from MACLISP.) An identification followed by the word &quot;hello&quot; initiated an interactive session on contemporary Univac, General Electric, and university timesharing systems. Many of the things the computer said were based on ELIZA, a computer program which simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist. For example, the phrase Clem used to put The President into maintenance mode, &quot;this is Worker speaking,&quot; is based on the fact that the user could type &quot;worker&quot; at Eliza&#x27;s command prompt, and Eliza would then display the command prompt for the Lisp software environment in which Eliza ran. And if the user neglected to end a statement or question to Eliza with a punctuation mark, Eliza&#x27;s parser would fail, displaying the message &quot;Unhappy: MkNam&quot; to indicate that a function called &quot;MkNam&quot; was failing. The President said the same thing, pronouncing it &quot;unhappy macnam.&quot;

==Award nominations==
The album was nominated by the World Science Fiction Society in 1972 for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.

==Film==
This album inspired Ivan Stang&#x27;s 1973 film &quot;Let&#x27;s Visit the World of the Future&quot;.

==Cultural influence==
Apple&#x27;s Siri used to respond to &quot;This is worker speaking. Hello.&quot; with &quot;Hello, Ah-Clem. What function can I perform for you? LOL.&quot;

<text>Mahinda Rajapaksa (; ; born Percy Mahendra Rajapaksa; 18 November 1945) is a Sri Lankan politician. He served as the sixth President of Sri Lanka from 2005 to 2015; the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka from 2004 to 2005, 2018, and 2019 to 2022; the Leader of the Opposition from 2002 to 2004 and 2018 to 2019, and the Minister of Finance from 2005 to 2015 and 2019 to 2021.

Rajapaksa is a lawyer by profession and was first elected to the Parliament of Sri Lanka in 1970. He served as the leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party from 2005 to 2015. Rajapaksa was sworn in for his first six-year term as president on 19 November 2005. He was subsequently re-elected in 2010 for a second term. Rajapaksa was defeated in his bid for a third term in the 2015 presidential election by Maithripala Sirisena, and he left office on 9 January 2015. Later that year, Rajapaksa unsuccessfully sought to become prime minister in the 2015 parliamentary election; that year, the United People&#x27;s Freedom Alliance was defeated but Rajapaksa was elected as a Member of Parliament for the Kurunegala District.

On 26 October 2018, Rajapaksa was controversially appointed to the office of prime minister by president Maithripala Sirisena after the UPFA withdrew from the unity government. The incumbent, Ranil Wickremesinghe, refused to accept his dismissal, stating that it was unconstitutional. This disagreement resulted in a constitutional crisis. The Sri Lankan Parliament passed two no-confidence motions brought against Rajapaksa on 14 and 16 November 2018. Failing to follow proper procedures, president Sirisena rejected both. On 3 December 2018, a court suspended Rajapaksa&#x27;s powers as prime minister, ruling that his cabinet could not function until establishing its legitimacy. Rajapaksa resigned from the post of prime minister on 15 December 2018. Wickremesinghe was re-appointed as prime minister, and Rajapaksa was appointed Leader of the Opposition.

Rajapaksa became the leader of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna in 2019, a proxy of the former president that had split from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. He became prime minister again on 21 November 2019 after being appointed by his brother, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who had become president on 18 November after winning the 2019 presidential election. On 9 August 2020, Rajapaksa was sworn in as Prime Minister of Sri Lanka for the fourth time at a Buddhist temple on Colombo&#x27;s outskirts. On 3 May 2022, a motion of no confidence aimed at Rajapaksa and his cabinet was declared by opposition leaders. He was targeted during the 2022 Sri Lankan protests over the corruption and mismanagement by the Rajapaksa family which led to an economic crisis that brought Sri Lanka to the point of bankruptcy as it defaulted on its loans for the first time in its history since independence. Protesters called him &quot;Myna&quot; and demanded his resignation which he resisted. On 9 May 2022, Mahinda Rajapaksa organised his supporters at his official residence who were brought by buses and led by SLPP MPs. The loyalists then attacked protestors at Temple Trees before assaulting protestors at Galle Face as attacks were carried out simultaneously against protests in other areas; however this intensified protests and retaliatory violence against Rajapaksa loyalists erupted islandwide and Mahinda Rajapaksa submitted his letter of resignation the same day.

During Rajapaksa&#x27;s political career, he has been accused of multiple crimes including war crimes during the last years of the Sri Lankan civil war as well as other criminal accusations including human rights violations during his presidency, corruption and for instigating violence on anti-government protestors on 9 May 2022. As of 2023 he has been sanctioned by Canada for human rights violations.

== Early life and education ==
Born in 1945, Rajapaksa was the third child and second son of D. A. Rajapaksa and Dandina Samarasinghe Dissanayake. Rajapaksa spent his formative years at his family home in Medamulana. At the age of six he was sent to his father&#x27;s school, Richmond College in Galle. Initially, he and his elder brother Chamal were boarded with a family in Galle. Later, their mother rented a house in Galle called the &#x27;Singapore House&#x27; and moved there to facilitate the education of the growing family. In the mid-fifties, the Rajapaksa family moved to Colombo and Mahinda Rajapaksa was admitted to Nalanda College, Colombo. Later in 1957, he transferred to Thurstan College, where he took part in sports such as cricket, rugby and athletics, taking part in the 400m relay team and becoming the shot put champion.

In the mid-sixties, he started work as a library assistant at the Vidyodaya Pirivena and soon became active in left-wing politics. He became a member of the Ceylon Mercantile Union and was elected its branch secretary in 1967. His father. who had lost his parliamentary seat in the 1965 general elections, died in November 1967. Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) leader Sirimavo Bandaranaike offered his father&#x27;s post of SLFP party organiser for the Beliatta electorate to Mahinda&#x27;s older brother Chamal. Chamal, who had joined the Ceylon Police Force as a sub-inspector, turned down Bandaranaike&#x27;s offer in favour of his younger brother, thus Mahinda Rajapaksa was appointed as SLFP organiser for Beliatta in 1968.

==Political career==
===House of Representatives===
Rajapaksa contested the 1970 general elections as the SLFP candidate for the Beliatta constituency and was elected to the House of Representatives, having gained 23,103 votes against his rival Dr. Ranjit Atapattu from the United National Party (UNP) who gained 16,477. At the time, he was the youngest member of parliament (MP) at the age of 24 and served as a backbencher for the governing party. Following changes to the admission process to the Sri Lanka Law College, which allowed young MPs to gain admission, he entered Sri Lanka Law College and studied law while serving as an MP. In July 1977, Rajapaksa lost his parliamentary seat in the SLFP&#x27;s landslide defeat in the 1977 general elections, to Dr. Ranjit Atapattu who had gained 24,289 votes to Rajapaksa&#x27;s 17,896.

=== Legal career ===
In November 1977, Rajapaksa was called to the bar as an attorney at law. He thereafter started his legal practice in criminal law in the Unofficial Bar in Tangalle, which he did until 1994.

=== Opposition ===
He continued to engage in politics and was re-elected to parliament in 1989, representing the Hambantota District under proportional representation. He came to prominence as a leader, together with Dr Manorani Saravanamuttu of the Mothers&#x27; Front. Saravanamuttu&#x27;s organization united the mothers of individuals who had &quot;disappeared&quot; during the 1987–1989 JVP insurrection; the insurrection was instigated by a rebel group that called themselves , or &quot;Patriotic National Movement&quot;.

During the insurrection, Rajapaksa frequently tried to encourage third-party intervention. He frequently complained about Sri Lanka&#x27;s situation while in Geneva; he claimed that to restore democratic ideals, it is neither treacherous nor unpatriotic to seek third-party intervention. He also demanded that the United Nations, alongside NGOs such as Amnesty International, be allowed to come to Sri Lanka and investigate.

Rajapaksa requested that foreign nations put human-rights-related conditions on Sri Lanka when giving aid. On 25 October 1990, he said, &quot;If the government is going to deny human rights, we should go not only to Geneva, but to any place in the world, or hell if necessary, and act against the government. The lamentation of this country&#x27;s innocents should be raised anywhere.&quot; In 1994, Rajapaksa appeared in the Sinhalese film &quot;Nomiyena Minisun&quot;.

===Appointment as cabinet minister===
In 1994, following the victory of the People&#x27;s Alliance, a political front led by Sri Lanka Freedom Party and headed by Chandrika Kumaratunga, Rajapaksa was appointed Minister of Labor. He held this post until 1997 when, following a cabinet reshuffle, his portfolio was changed to Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources.

===Leader of the Opposition===
When the United National Party (UNP) defeated the People&#x27;s Alliance in the 2001 elections, Rajapaksa lost his position in the government. He was however appointed as Leader of the Opposition in March 2002.

===First premiership (2004–2005)===
After the 2004 parliamentary elections, in which the United People&#x27;s Freedom Alliance gained a slim majority, Rajapaksa became the new prime minister. He was sworn in as Sri Lanka&#x27;s 13th Prime Minister on 6 April 2004. While Rajapaksa was prime minister, he was also in charge of the Ministry of Highways, Ports &amp; Shipping.

==Presidency (2005–2015)==
===First term===

Mahinda Rajapaksa was chosen by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party to run against Ranil Wickremesinghe, former prime minister and Opposition Leader. Wickremesinghe was the leader of the United National Party in the presidential election held on 17 November 2005. Despite the huge election campaign led by the UNP, Mahinda Rajapaksa was able to gain a narrow victory, by 190,000 votes. Rajapaksa&#x27;s opponents claimed that he won only because the LTTE called for Tamil voters to boycott the polls. Most voters in these areas were forcibly restrained from voting, and it is said that they would have favoured Wickremesinghe of the UNP.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc-11/18/05&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rajapaksa received 50.3% of the vote.

After becoming President of Sri Lanka, Rajapaksa reshuffled the cabinet and took the portfolios of Defense and Finance in the new cabinet, which was sworn in on 23 November 2005. Immediately following his election in 2005, Rajapaksa extended the term of the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army, Sarath Fonseka, less than 30 days before he was scheduled to retire. Over the next three and a half years, Fonseka and Rajapaksa&#x27;s brother, Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, led the country&#x27;s armed forces in their battle against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE, or Tamil Tigers), ultimately defeating the Tigers and killing their leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran.

====Sri Lankan Civil War====
Although styling himself as a man of peace and a willing negotiator, Rajapaksa signalled his intention to end the peace process once in power by allying with Sinhalese nationalist parties such as the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and Jathika Hela Urumaya. The JVP had opposed the original 2002 peace process as treasonous.

The agreement made with Rajapaksa included provisions that called for a revision of the ceasefire agreement to give the military broader powers against the LTTE, as well as ruling out any devolution of power to the Tamil people. Furthermore, the cessation of aid to the tsunami-damaged LTTE-occupied areas, and the sidelining of the Norwegian facilitators due to their alleged bias were included.

Immediately following his election victory, a series of mine blasts blamed on the LTTE claimed the lives of many off-duty servicemen and civilians, pushing the country back to the brink of civil war. Following the closure by the LTTE of the Mavil Aru reservoir supplying water to 15,000 people in government-controlled areas on 21 July 2006, the Sri Lankan military launched an offensive against the LTTE, bringing the entire reservoir under government control. Further military engagements led to the LTTE being driven out of the entire Eastern Province of Sri Lanka and loss of 95% of the territory they had controlled. The Sri Lankan government declared total victory on 18 May 2009. On 19 May 2009, President Rajapaksa delivered a victory address to the Parliament and declared that Sri Lanka was liberated from terrorism.

==== Relationship with Lasantha Wickrematunge ====
On 11 January 2006, Lasantha Wickrematunge alleged he was threatened by President Mahinda Rajapaksa with whom he had a close personal friendship with for over 20 years. Wickrematunge was allegedly abused in foul language in a telephone call According to Wickrematunge, the President had threatened to “destroy him” over a publication in his newspaper involving First Lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa. Wickrematunge was detained briefly at Bandaranaike International Airport on 21 February 2006 as he arrived for a flight to Geneva. Airport officials had claimed that Wickrematunge required &quot;special permission&quot; to leave Sri Lanka.

On 8 January 2009, Lasantha Wickrematunge was assassinated on the streets of Colombo.

After Mahinda Rajapaksa&#x27;s defeat at the presidential election in 2015, the new government of President Maithripala Sirisena reopened the investigation over allegations that former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa ordered the assassination.

====Allegations of war crimes====
In 2010, WikiLeaks made public classified US messages sent during 2009 and 2010, stating that American diplomats, including the US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Patricia A. Butenis, believed that Rajapaksa was responsible for massacres of Tamil civilians and captured LTTE fighters at the end of the war against the LTTE. The cables also stated that the responsibility for many of the alleged crimes rested with the country&#x27;s senior civilian and military leadership, including President Rajapaksa, his brothers, and General Fonseka.

In April 2011, the Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon published a report by an UN-appointed panel of experts, which concluded that as many as 40,000 people were killed in the final weeks of the war between the Tamil Tigers and the government forces. A number of foreign journalists and news teams, such as the UK&#x27;s Channel Four News, have reported and filmed evidence of targeted shelling of civilians, executions, and atrocities. Dead female Tamil fighters appeared to have been raped or sexually assaulted, abused, and murdered.

Rajapaksa and his government have denied all allegations of war crimes. 

===Second term===


Following the end of the conflict, a rift emerged between Rajapaksa and Fonseka over reasons which are still disputed. On 15 November 2009, Rajapaksa ordered Fonseka to leave his post as Chief of the Defence Staff with immediate effect through a letter from his secretary. Fonseka then joined the opposition as the candidate against Rajapaksa in the 2010 presidential election, which Rajapaksa won in a landslide. Fonseka was subsequently sentenced to two years in jail for various offences by a court martial. President Rajapaksa signed documents for the release of Fonseka in May 2012.

====Infrastructure development projects====
During his second term after ending the civil war in 2009, Rajapaksa initiated several large-scale infrastructure projects such as the Colombo Lotus Tower, Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port, the Colombo Harbour South Container Terminal, the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, the Colombo–Katunayake Expressway, and the Mahinda Rajapaksa International Cricket Stadium.

Sri Lanka also rose into the &quot;high&quot; category of the Human Development Index during this period. Development projects included highways, roads, a Colombo beautification project, and rural infrastructure development. However, the roadway projects reportedly had extremely high costs and were suspected of corruption, and large Chinese loans tripled the country&#x27;s foreign debt and created an economic crisis. Rajapaksa claimed that under his tenure, Sri Lanka started to experience rapid economic growth and that the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate reached over 7%. However, these claims have been disputed, and after his terms in office ended, the successor government revealed that GDP growth was inflated by using the year 2002 as the base year. GDP growth for 2013 and 2014, which had been calculated at 7.2% and 7.4% using 2002 as the base year, was reduced to 3.4 and 4.5 percent, respectively.

A forensic audit was launched, with International Monetary Fund help, on various projects initiated by Rajapaksa. The audit confirmed that Sri Lanka had additional liabilities of 1.3 trillion rupees (8.9 billion US dollars).
====Allegations of election fraud====
Rajapaksa was accused of election fraud in relation to both of his previous presidential election runs. During the 2005 presidential election, opposition parties accused Rajapaksa of bribing the LTTE to dissuade people from voting in the northern and eastern provinces. Most voters in these areas were forcibly restrained from voting by the militant group and, according to observers, they would have favoured the opposition candidate Ranil Wickremesinghe. In the 2010 election, Rajapaksa was accused of manipulating election results using computers.

In the 2015 election, according to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating irregularities into SriLankan Airlines, it was revealed that security officers and vehicles of the national carrier had been used in the Rajapaksa&#x27;s 2015 presidential campaign. At the time, Nishantha Wickramasinghe, a brother-in-law of Rajapaksa, was also Chairman of SriLankan Airlines until Rajapaksa lost the presidential election in 2015.

====Abolition of term limits====
Capitalizing on the end of the Sri Lankan Civil War in May 2009, coming off an election win in January 2010, and with the near-collapse of the opposition United National Party, President Rajapaksa rallied more than the two-thirds majority in Parliament necessary to pass an amendment to the constitution removing presidential term limits. On 9 September 2010, Parliament passed the amendment to remove presidential term limits from the Constitution. This amendment allowed Rajapaksa to run for a third term and cement his grip on power. The move came just a day after the Supreme Court ruled that a referendum was not required to make the change. The amendment had consequences beyond just term limits, including provisions that increased the president&#x27;s power to act without oversight, removing an independent advisory council that the president was previously required to consult before appointing people to important non-partisan posts, such as Supreme Court judges and members of the human rights and electoral commissions. A Parliamentary Council without veto power and with only two opposition members was created in its place.

In a move that was widely seen as solidifying his control over the Supreme Court, Rajapaksa removed chief justice Shirani Bandaranayake from office in January 2013, allowing Rajapaksa to appoint an ally and legal adviser, former Attorney General Mohan Peiris, as Chief Justice. In November 2014, the Supreme Court dismissed legal objections regarding President Rajapaksa&#x27;s eligibility to seek a third term.

Two years ahead of schedule, in November 2014, Rajapaksa signed an official proclamation confirming that he would seek re-election for a third term, after being unanimously endorsed by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Though his second term officially was to end in November 2016, he could legally seek re-election after completing four years in office, a marker he passed on 19 November.

====2015 presidential campaign====

In the run-up to the election, several people had been suggested for nomination as the common opposition candidate: former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, UNP Leadership Council Chairman Karu Jayasuriya, former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake, and leader of the National Movement for Social Justice Maduluwawe Sobitha Thero. However, on 21 November 2014, after the election had been called, Maithripala Sirisena was announced as the common opposition candidate by the UNP. Sirisena had been Minister of Health in Rajapaksa&#x27;s government and general secretary of the SLFP before defecting to the opposition coalition. Sirisena immediately received the support of former President Chandrika Kumaratunga and several UPFA MPs that had defected alongside him (Duminda Dissanayake, M. K. D. S. Gunawardena, Wasantha Senanayake, Rajitha Senaratne, and Rajiva Wijesinha). Sirisena and the other UPFA MPs were stripped of their ministerial positions and expelled from the SLFP.

Rajapaksa received the backing of a number of small constituent parties of the UPFA, including the Ceylon Workers&#x27; Congress, Communist Party, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP), the National Freedom Front, the National Union of Workers, and the Up-Country People&#x27;s Front. On nomination day, 8 December 2014, two opposition MPs, Tissa Attanayake and Jayantha Ketagoda, defected to the government to support Rajapaksa. Attanayake was later appointed Minister of Health, the post previously held by Sirisena. Rajapaksa also received support from the Buddhist extremist group Bodu Bala Sena.

However, the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) party withdrew from the UPFA government on 18 November 2014, citing Rajapaksa&#x27;s refusal to reform the executive presidency and enact reforms to promote accountability. After much hesitation, the All Ceylon Makkal Congress and the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress also withdrew from the UPFA government on 22 and 28 December 2014 respectively, blaming the government&#x27;s failure to protect Sri Lankan Muslims from Sinhalese Buddhist extremists.

Rajapaksa released his manifesto, titled &quot;Mahinda&#x27;s Vision — The World Winning Path&quot;, on 23 December 2014 at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall. The manifesto pledged to introduce a new constitution within one year of being elected, but not to abolish the executive presidency — it would be amended and the &quot;weakness&quot; in the parliamentary system eliminated. A naval force and a special security force would be set up, with the help of the army, to tackle drug trafficking and other organised crime. The manifesto also pledged to establish a transparent judicial inquiry into the alleged war crimes during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War, but Rajapaksa had refused to co-operate with the UN investigation.

In the presidential election of 8 January 2015, Rajapaksa was defeated by his ex-aide Maithripala Sirisena, winning only 47.6% of the vote. Many had accused Rajapaksa of authoritarianism, nepotism, poor governance, and corruption.

====Chinese interference and vote buying====
In June 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that President Rajapaksa, during the 2015 presidential campaign and elections, received large payments from a Chinese port construction fund that flowed directly to campaign aides and activities. Rajapaksa had agreed to Chinese terms and was seen as an important ally in China&#x27;s efforts to tilt influence away from India in South Asia. The payments were confirmed by documents and checks detailed in a government investigation report obtained by &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

During the final months of the election, the ambassador of China to Sri Lanka had lobbied voters, &quot;even caddies at Colombo&#x27;s premier golf course&quot;, to support Rajapaksa over the opposition, which was threatening to tear up economic agreements with the Chinese government.

With the election coming around, large payments started to flow toward the president&#x27;s circle. Affiliates of Rajapaksa&#x27;s campaign received at least $7.6 million that was dispensed from China Harbor&#x27;s account at Standard Chartered Bank. A sum of around $3.7 million was distributed in checks with ten days to go before polls opened, including $678,000 to print campaign t-shirts and other promotional material, and $297,000 to buy supporters&#x27; gifts, including women&#x27;s saris. $38,000 was paid to a popular Buddhist monk who was supporting the Rajapaksa campaign, while two checks totalling $1.7 million were delivered by volunteers to Temple Trees. A subaccount controlled by China Harbor, called &quot;HPDP Phase 2&quot;, shorthand for Hambantota Port Development Project, was the source of most of the payments.

Rajapaksa responded in the &quot;Colombo Telegraph&quot; by calling the article &quot;part of a political mudslinging campaign&quot;.

In July 2018, a joint Chinese-Sri Lankan company, Colombo International Container Terminals Limited (CICT), confirmed paying nearly 20 million Sri Lankan rupees as a donation to the Pushpa Rajapaksa Foundation, a private fund meant to build houses for the poor. Pushpa Rajapaksa is Mahinda Rajapaksa&#x27;s sister-in-law, wife of his brother, Basil Rajapaksa, who was also his economic development minister. CICT did not say how the money was used.

==Post-presidency==
===Alleged coup d&#x27;état attempt===
According to Sri Lankan MP Athuraliye Rathana Thero, Rajapaksa attempted a coup d&#x27;état hours after the announcement of the election results, in order to remain in power, but the Army Chief, Jagath Jayasuriya, disobeyed the orders. According to MPs Rajitha Senaratne and Mangala Samaraweera, before going to the Army Chief, Rajapaksa had earlier instructed the Attorney General to prepare the necessary documentation for the issuance of a State of Emergency, but the Attorney General had refused. Rajapaksa subsequently accepted defeat and left the Temple Trees, the official residence of president, with the control of the government peacefully transferring to Maithripala Sirisena.

The Sirisena government launched a probe into the alleged coup by Rajapaksa. The government argued that Rajapaksa attempted to seize the poll-counting centres when he realised that he was losing the election. One of the witnesses, the Attorney General, described to the Criminal Investigation Department the coup attempt made by Rajapaksa. The Attorney General said that he had refused to act on behalf of Rajapaksa. Former army chief General Sarath Fonseka claimed that the Rajapaksa had moved about 2,000 troops into Colombo from the Northern Province three days before the election results were announced. The general claimed that the troops were ready take action on a coup.

However, the cabinet spokesperson of the new government stated, during a press conference held on 24 March 2015, that there was no evidence to prove that such a coup was attempted on the night of the election. A spokesman for Rajapaksa has denied the allegations as baseless. The army and police also denied the allegations.

===Prime Ministerial candidacy in 2015===
Rajapaksa unsuccessfully sought to become prime minister again, after losing his third-term presidential bid, in the 2015 parliamentary elections. The position of Prime Minister is largely that of a senior member of the cabinet who acts as a deputy to the President. The President directly appoints the Prime Minister, a person &quot;who, in the President&#x27;s opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of Parliament&quot;; this is usually the leader of the party in power. Although Rajapaksa was elected as a Member of Parliament for Kurunegala with 423,529 preferential votes, his party was defeated in the election by Ranil Wickremesinghe&#x27;s United National Party; Wickremesinghe was appointed as prime minister.

===Return to legislature===
Rajapaksa returned to Parliament after his tenure as president, becoming the first former president to do so. He was elected as a Member of Parliament for Kurunegala District. On 23 January 2015, the Seychelles government announced that it would assist the Sri Lankan government in their search for funds that were allegedly transferred by the Rajapaksa regime into Port Victoria offshore bank accounts. In February, India announced that it would assist the Sri Lankan government in tracing billions of dollars that were allegedly deposited into overseas bank accounts belonging to Rajapaksa and associates. The government sought help from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in locating this hidden wealth to expose the alleged corruption of the previous regime.

On 7 May 2015, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera received intelligence reports from four foreign nations that involved tracing billions of dollars stashed abroad, stating that the Rajapaksa family holds $18 billion (approximate Rs. 238,000,000,000) worth of assets in foreign countries. Minister Samaraweera didn&#x27;t mention the names of the countries that were involved in this investigation. The government asserted that they had traced only $2 billion and were seeking access to a bank account that was held by the Rajapaksa family; Minister Samaraweera stated that it would not be an easy task to retrieve the assets held by the Rajapaksa family abroad, and was willing to go after those belonging to the state.

In 2016, Rajapaksa loyalists created the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna party in an attempt to split with the SLFP. While Rajapaksa is not officially the leader of the party, the inaugural meeting was held in his political office which had a 15-foot cut-out of Rajapaksa smiling and surrounded by school children. In the courtyard was a banner of similar size showing golden rice fields and Rajapaksa&#x27;s smiling face at its centre.

Rajapaksa adopted a more anti-China policy, opposing major development projects such as the Southern Economic Development Zone, in which China planned to invest over US$5 billion. During the opening ceremony, protesters led by joint opposition MPs ignored a court order banning protests in the area and pelted stones at the event&#x27;s participants, during which the Chinese envoy claimed that China will ignore &quot;negative forces&quot;. Rajapaksa also changed his stance on private medical universities such as the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM); during his rule, SAITM was accepted with several concessions from the Board of Investment, and at the request of Rajapaksa, SAITM gave scholarships to students who gained 3As in advanced-level exams. Ten students were given each given Rs. 7 million scholarships by Rajapaksa himself. However, in 2017 he claimed that &quot;there needs to be a standard. The law cannot interfere. If it happens, everyone in this country will try to become doctors,&quot; opposing the institution. In reply, Dr Neville Fernando, the chairman of SAITM, called him an opportunist, as the students to whom Rajapaksa had granted scholarships, were then in their final year.

====2018 local election====
Mahinda Rajapaksa&#x27;s proxy, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), won a landslide victory in the 2018 local authority elections. They were able to secure 239 local government bodies out of 340. The SLPP called for the resignation of the government and for fresh general elections to be held.

====2018 constitutional crisis====
On the evening of 26 October 2018, President Maithripala Sirisena appointed Rajapaksa as prime minister after the United People&#x27;s Freedom Alliance withdrew from the unity government and informed Ranil Wickremesinghe that he was being removed from office. Wickremesinghe refused to accept the dismissal, stating that it was unconstitutional, which resulted in the 2018 Sri Lankan constitutional crisis. Amid claims that Rajapaksa had failed to secure a majority in Parliament while the crisis was prolonged, Sirisena dissolved Parliament by proclamation on 9 November and called for snap elections. On 11 November 2018, Rajapaksa left the SLFP and joined the SLPP. The president&#x27;s proclamation was challenged in the Supreme Court by multiple petitions, the court stayed the proclamation on 12 November, and Parliament met soon after. Rajapaksa faced multiple no-confidence motions, and after a quo warranto writ petition filed by 122 MPs against the appointment of Rajapaksa as prime minister and other Ministers, the Court of Appeal issued an interim order on 3 December restraining the functioning of the respondents, Mahinda Rajapaksa as prime minister as well as other cabinet ministers, deputy ministers, and state ministers. The following day, Rajapaksa filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the interim order.

On 13 December 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that President Sirisena&#x27;s decision to dissolve the Parliament 20 months before the end of its term was unconstitutional. The following day, the Supreme Court refused to vacate the interim order given by the Court of Appeal restraining Rajapaksa and his cabinet from functioning. The next day, 15 December, Rajapaksa publicly resigned from the post of prime minister.

===Leader of the Opposition (2018–2019)===
On 18 December 2018, the Speaker of Parliament, Karu Jayasuriya, announced that Mahinda Rajapaksa had been appointed as Leader of the Opposition, with the UPFA joining the opposition benches in Parliament. He replaced R. Sampanthan, who was the leader of the Tamil National Alliance.

===Third premiership (2019–2022)===
The Rajapaksa family regained power in the 2019 presidential election that November, when his younger brother and former wartime defence chief Gotabaya Rajapaksa won the election and was sworn in as the new president of Sri Lanka. Their firm grip of power was consolidated in parliamentary elections in August 2020. The SLPP won a landslide victory and a clear majority in the parliament. Five members of the Rajapaksa family won seats in the parliament. Mahinda Rajapaksa was sworn in as the new prime minister.

The Rajapaksa family was targeted during the 2022 Sri Lankan protests as their mismanagement and corruption was blamed for the destruction of the Sri Lankan economy, leading to an economic crisis that caused Sri Lanka to default on its foreign debt for the first time in its history since independence. Mahinda was called &quot;Myna&quot; by the protesters, who established a protest site named &quot;MynaGoGama&quot; outside his official residence at Temple Trees.

On 3 May 2022, opposition leaders declared a motion of no confidence aimed at Rajapaksa and his cabinet, in an attempt to remove him from power.

On 9 May 2022, Rajapaksa loyalists were transported to his residence on buses who were then addressed by Rajapaksa. The loyalists were then armed with iron bars and assaulted unarmed protesters near Temple Trees and destroyed MynaGoGama. The Rajapaksa loyalists then travelled to Galle Face where they assaulted protesters and burned down their tents.

With the uprising of violent clashes and unstable situations in the country, Prime Minister Rajapaksa resigned from his post on 9 May 2022. The following day, a gazette was released confirming Mahinda Rajapaksa&#x27;s resignation from the post as prime minister. On 10 May 2022, Rajapaksa and his family members fled to Trincomalee navy base for security reasons. This was confirmed by the Ministry of Defence on 11 May 2022.

The opposition and protestors called for the arrest of Mahinda Rajapaksa for inciting violence against peaceful protesters. Protests erupted demanding the arrest of Rajapaksa and loyalists responsible for the attacks.

=== 2024 elections and resignation from politics ===
In the 2024 presidential election, the SLPP fielded Mahinda Rajapaksa&#x27;s son, Namal Rajapaksa, as its presidential candidate. Namal Rajapaksa suffered a humiliating defeat, finishing in fourth place and winning only 2.57% of the popular vote. Following the SLPP&#x27;s defeat, Mahinda Rajapaksa chose not to stand for re-election in the 2024 parliamentary elections, thus ending his 54-year long political career.

==Controversies and criticism==

=== Corruption ===
Rajapaksa&#x27;s governments have been criticised for their corruption. During his leadership, Sri Lanka scored extremely low in the Transparency International Corruption Index. A Transparency International-led coalition revealed Rs. 3,000,000,000 had gone missing from a road project for a 2012 exhibition.

Rajapaksa was being investigated by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) over alleged financial losses incurred by the state-run Independent Television Network (ITN) due to his campaign&#x27;s failure to pay for advertisements broadcast during Rajapaksa&#x27;s 2015 presidential election campaign and also over the appointment of the ITN Chairman in September 2014. However, Rajapaksa has accused the PRECIFAC of being unconstitutional, and Rajapaksa&#x27;s lawyers objected to its composition.

On 16 January 2015, The Sirisena government announced that it would investigate Rajapaksa&#x27;s deals with China and other countries that allegedly included kickbacks and mega-project deals. Furthermore, the government stated that the deals would be suspended until the investigations were completed. Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) announced that they had filed corruption charges against the Rajapaksa brothers at the Bribery and Corruption Commission and demanded that 11 individuals and an institution be investigated for massive corruption. Meanwhile, MP Mervyn Silva also filed corruption charges against Mahinda&#x27;s brothers, Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Basil Rajapaksa. Silva criticised former Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa for human rights violations and the death of Lasantha Wickrematunge. The Anti-Corruption Unit led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe included a high-powered &quot;rapid response team&quot; to look into corrupt land transactions, stock market price-fixing, and the abuse of state funds for political purposes by the Rajapaksa family and the close associates of Mahinda Rajapaksa.

The Sri Lanka Air Force announced that Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family had used military aircraft for the Presidential election campaign, using $17,300 (Rs. 2,278,000) of public funds to travel across the island. Rajapaksa and his family were the subjects of numerous state resource abuse complaints from organizations and election monitors, including claims of their involvement in fraud, misuse of powers, murder, and money-laundering activities that are said to have taken $5.31 billion (Rs. 700 billion) out of the country illegally through the Central Bank using Rajapaksa&#x27;s close association with Ajith Nivard Cabraal, the former governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

===Abduction and assault of Keith Noyahr===
In August 2018, Rajapaksa was questioned at his official residence in Colombo by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) in connection with the abduction and assault of journalist and former associate editor of &quot;The Nation&quot; Keith Noyahr in 2008. The CID detectives questioned Rajapaksa about a phone call from Karu Jayasuriya and the then-editor of &quot;The Nation&quot; newspaper, Lalith Alahakoon, to Rajapaksa, after which Noyahr was released. Rajapaksa had said that he did not recall receiving a phone call, and claimed the case was political revenge. Noyahr was abducted and severely assaulted before being released in May 2008, after which he fled to Australia with his family, fearing for his life.

=== Nepotism ===
Rajapaksa has been accused of nepotism, appointing three brothers to run important ministries and giving other political positions to relatives, regardless of their merit. The Rajapaksas held the offices of the ministries of finance and planning, defence, ports and aviation, and highways and road development. Appointments have included his brother, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, who was given the post of Defence Secretary without holding any elections for the post; he controlled the armed forces, the police, and the Coast Guard, and was in charge of immigration and emigration. Rajapaksa appointed another brother, Basil Rajapaksa, as minister of Economic Development. His oldest brother, Chamal Rajapaksa, was appointed the Speaker of the Parliament of Sri Lanka from 2010 to 2015. The Rajapaksa family controlled over 70% of Sri Lanka&#x27;s budget during their governance.

Other appointees include his nephew, Shashindra Rajapaksa, who served as the Chief minister of Uva from 2009 to 2015. Some of his cousins were given ambassadorial positions: Jaliya Wickramasuriya was appointed as Sri Lanka&#x27;s ambassador to the United States, and Udayanga Weeratunga was appointed as the ambassador to Russia. Dozens of nephews, nieces, cousins and in-laws have also been appointed as heads of banks, boards, and corporations.

Rajapaksa has a long history of denying allegations that are levelled against his family members and political associations. He is also widely accused of using his family members for government duties, claims he has rejected.

===Media freedom===
Media groups have alleged that media freedom was curtailed in Sri Lanka during Rajapaksa&#x27;s terms as president. In 2008, Reporters Without Borders ranked Sri Lanka 165th among 173 countries in its annual Worldwide Press Freedom Index. The next year, the country was ranked 162. By 2010, following the end of the war, the RSF ranking was 158th. These rankings have been questioned by independent Sri Lanka newspapers.

A total of 17 journalists and media workers were killed during Rajapaksa&#x27;s presidency.

===Ethnic relations===
Rajapaksa&#x27;s policies on ethnic relations were mixed. The content of the president&#x27;s historic speech in Tamil at the UN was an effort to establish that he is a people&#x27;s leader, representing all the peoples of Sri Lanka, including the Tamil minority.

He added, in Tamil,

At the same time, he took no action against Sinhala Buddhist extremists, and his brother, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, was accused of supporting the extremist Bodu Bala Sena but later distanced himself from the organization, accusing it of being a &quot;Western conspiracy&quot;.

President Rajapaksa also imposed an unofficial ban on the Tamil version of the Sri Lankan anthem, which has existed since 1948 and has been sung at various events including the 1949 Independence Day. State administrators in Tamil-speaking regions blocked the Tamil version of the anthem and in some cases used security forces to disrupt events. He continued to stand against the Tamil version of the anthem and slammed his successors for removing the ban and singing it again on Independence Day, claiming that the &quot;national anthem should be sung in one language and not two or three languages&quot;; the Pro-Rajapaksa Joint Opposition also boycotted the event.

=== Sanctions ===
In 2023, Rajapaksa was sanctioned by the Canadian government for the &quot;gross and systematic violations of human rights&quot; committed during the civil war between the Government of Sri Lanka and the militant organization Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam from 1983 to 2009.

=== Conviction of economic mismanagement ===
On 14 November 2023, Rajapaksa, his brothers Gotabaya, Basil and other senior officials were found guilty of economic mismanagement between 2019 and 2022 by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, which stated that the respondents breached the fundamental rights to equal protection of the law in terms of Article 12(1) of the Constitution in a fundamental rights petition filed by Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) and four other activists. The court also ordered Rajapaksa and the other respondents to pay about $450 (150,000 rupees) in legal costs to the petitioners. The following day, Rajapaksa stated in Kandy that he will not accept the court’s judgement.

== Personal life and family ==
Rajapaksa was born Percy Mahendra Rajapaksa, in Weeraketiya, in the rural southern district of Hambantota to an established political family. His father, D. A. Rajapaksa, had succeeded his brother D. M. Rajapaksa&#x27;s seat in the State Council of Ceylon following the latter&#x27;s death in May 1945. D. M. Rajapaksa had started wearing the earthy brown shawl to represent &quot;kurakkan&quot; (finger millet), which was cultivated by the people of his area; he championed their cause throughout his life. In later years Mahinda Rajapaksa would follow his uncle&#x27;s example and wear a similar characteristic shawl. D. A. Rajapaksa, went on to serve as the member of parliament from Beliatta from 1947 to 1965, and served as Cabinet Minister of Agriculture and Land in Wijeyananda Dahanayake&#x27;s government. His mother Dona Dandina Samarasinghe Dissanayake was from Palatuwa, Matara. He was the second eldest of nine chidden in the family which included six boys and three girls. His elder siblings are Chamal, Jayanthi and younger siblings were Tudor, Gotabaya, Basil, Preethi, Dudley and Gandini.

Several members of Rajapaksa&#x27;s family are currently active in politics. Most notable is his brother, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the former president of Sri Lanka and a former secretary for the Ministry of Defence. His career in the Ministry of Defence ended at the same time as Mahinda Rajapaksa&#x27;s presidency, on 9 January 2015. Another brother, Basil Rajapaksa, was elected to the Parliament of Sri Lanka from the Gampaha District in April 2010. He was later appointed Minister of Economic Development. Basil was arrested in April 2015 on corruption charges. He served as minister of finance of Sri Lanka from 2021 until his resignation in 2022. Mahinda Rajapaksa&#x27;s eldest brother, Chamal Rajapaksa, was an MP from 1989 to 2024. He was elected Speaker of the 14th Parliament of Sri Lanka. Other family members involved in politics include his nephew, Shashindra Rajapaksa, the Chief Minister of Uva Province. Shameendra Rajapaksa, another nephew, is the director of SriLankan Airlines. His cousin Jaliya Wickramasuriya is Sri Lanka&#x27;s ambassador to the United States. His cousin Udayanga Weeratunga is Sri Lanka&#x27;s ambassador to Russia. Prasanna Wickramasuriya, another cousin, is chairman of Airport &amp; Aviation Services. Rajapaksa&#x27;s brother-in-law, Nishantha Wickramasinghe, is the chairman of SriLankan Airlines.

In 1983, Rajapaksa married Shiranthi Wickremesinghe, a child psychologist and educator. Shiranthi Rajapaksa is the daughter of Commander E. P. Wickremasinghe, of the Sri Lanka Navy. The Rajapaksas have three sons: Namal, Yoshitha, and Rohitha. In April 2010, Namal Rajapaksa was elected as a Member of Parliament for the Hambantota District, obtaining the highest number of preferential votes in his father&#x27;s former district. Namal was again elected to Parliament by obtaining the most votes from the Hambantota district in the 2015 General Elections. Yoshitha Rajapaksa was commissioned as an Acting Sub Lieutenant in the Sri Lanka Navy in March 2009.

Mahinda Rajapaksa is superstitious; he wears talismans and consults astrologers in his decision-making. He is known for acquiring a large number of valuable rings as lucky charms, some with colored stones and elephant hair. This has earned him the nickname &quot;lord of the rings&quot;. During a wedding, which Rajapaksa attended as a VIP guest, he lost a gem-studded ring. After covertly searching under carpets and in washrooms, hotel staff found the ring on the floor near the VIP table.

==Public image==
Rajapaksa was considered to be the most popular Sri Lankan politician of his time. However, Rajapaksa has been accused of creating a cult of personality around himself, using the civil war victory and Sinhalese chauvinism to boost his image. He was referred as a &quot;King&quot; by some of his supporters, and he used the media to portray himself as a strongman. During his time in power, his pictures were shown on buses, billboards, and all forms of media. Television ads where songs were sung by school children in his rallies would hail him as &quot;our father&quot; and &quot;father of the country&quot;. Rajapaksa also printed his picture on currency and named the budget airline Mihin Lanka after himself. Rajapaksa thought having his name in the sky would bring him good fortune. By 2022, the popularity of the Rajapaksas had declined significantly and during the 2022 Sri Lankan protests protesters named him &quot;Myna&quot; as an insulting nickname and demanded his resignation alongside the entire Rajapaksa family.

Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port, Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre, and Mahinda Rajapaksa International Stadium are all high-profile lavish infrastructure projects initiated by Rajapaksa during his administration and are named after him. Critics have accused Rajapaksa of being narcissistic.

<text>In ancient Greece, the moriai (plural of moria) were olive trees considered to be the property of the state because of their religious significance.

== Overview ==
From &quot;Attic Orators&quot;, vol. I. p. 289: Throughout Attica, besides the olives which were private property (ἴδιαι ἐλαῖαι, Lys. or. 7 § 10) there were others which, whether on public or on private lands, were considered as the property of the State. They were called &quot;moriae&quot; (μορίαι), the legend being that they had been propagated (μεμορημέναι) from the original olive which Athena herself had caused to spring up on the Acropolis. This theory was convenient for their conservation as State property, since, by giving them a sacred character, it placed them directly under the care of the Areiopagus, which caused them to be visited once a month by Inspectors (ἐπιμεληταί, Lys. or. 7 § 29), and once a year by special Commissioners (γνώμονες, ib. § 25). To uproot a moria was an offence punishable by banishment and confiscation of goods (ib. § 41).From &quot;Moriai: Sacred Arboriculture in Athens&quot;:Athena&#x27;s gift to her protégés was the olive she planted on the sacred rock of the Acropolis. From this primordial olive twelve new trees were transplanted in the sanctuary of the hero Akademos and comprised a sacred grove. These trees, we are told by our ancient sources, were called moriai. The etymology remains obscure, but the most compelling explanation is the connection of the word &quot;moria&quot; with the stem μερ, which bears the meaning &quot;to be part of&quot;; the moriai were part of Athena&#x27;s property.

== Mythical origin of moria (olive) trees in ancient Greece ==
=== Contest for Attica (Athens) ===
According to Greek mythology, upon his establishment of the newly founded city (polis) of Attica, king Cecrops desired to appoint a patron deity and protector over his new city. Poseidon (Olympic god of the sea, earthquakes, and horses) and Athena (Olympic goddess of wisdom, craft, and war) both desired to lay claim to the ancient Greek city. Appearing before king Cecrops and a gathering of the people of Attica on the Acropolis, it was decided that a contest between the two powerful Olympians would be held. Whoever could bestow the more useful gift to the people of Attica would be declared patron deity and have the city named in his/her honor. Poseidon was the first to present his gift; striking a rock with a powerful blow of his trident, a spring of salt water burst through. Athena came next; as she thrust her spear into the ground of the Acropolis, she knelt down and planted an olive branch in the hole, which quickly grew into Greece&#x27;s first moria (olive) tree. King Cecrops and the people of Attica deliberated the usefulness of the gifts. Poseidon&#x27;s spring made of salt water was not suitable for drinking or much else, yet Athena&#x27;s precious gift proved to be suitable for an abundance of purposes. Athena was hailed winner of the competition and was crowned patron goddess and protector of the city (polis) of Attica, whose people adopted the name Athens in her honor. From &quot;Olive Oil Times&quot;, Laura Aitken-Burt writes:
The Athenians chose Athena&#x27;s gift and the olive tree has remained a central part of Greek life ever since for all of its profound qualities. The leaves have been used to crown the heads of victorious athletes, generals and kings, the wood used to construct houses and boats, the oil used to give fuel to lamps, rubbed into the toned, muscled bodies of lithe athletes, added to all food dishes and the olives themselves—a staple in the Mediterranean diet and a valuable export throughout antiquity and today. Even the iconic Athenian tetradrachm coins had the leaves of the olive branch peeping to the left of Athena&#x27;s owl.

<text>Erik Steenfeldt Reinert (born 15 February 1949) is a Norwegian economist, with development economics, economic history and history of economic policy as his specialties.

==Biography==
Reinert was born in Oslo, attended the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland (where he studied economics), Harvard University (MBA), and Cornell University (Ph.D.). Already during his studies, he spent time in Latin America, working with a community development project in the Peruvian Andes, as well as in private industry. In 1972 he founded and later developed a small industrial firm, Matherson-Selig, (color sampling to the paint and automotive industries) in Bergamo, Italy. Adding production plants also in Norway and Finland, the company had become the largest of its kind in Europe when Reinert sold it in 1991.
Reinert then worked for the STEP group in Oslo (1991–1995) and later became Director of Research of the Norsk Investorforum, a think tank set up by large Norwegian corporations (1995–2000). He also held a part-time position at The Centre for Development and the Environment (SUM), a research institution established by the University of Oslo. In 2000, he became the Executive Chairman of The Other Canon Foundation, a small center and network for heterodox economics research. Since 2004, he is Professor of Technology Governance and Development Strategies at the Tallinn University of Technology in Tallinn, Estonia, and since June 2020 he is Honorary Professor at the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose (IIPP) at University College London. He lectures in five languages.

==Work==
Reinert&#x27;s research interests and publications - starting with his PhD thesis in 1980 - focus around the theory of uneven development and the history of economic thought and policy. As a consultant, Reinert&#x27;s emphasis is on industrial and economic policy, the preconditions and management of innovations, and the relations between financial and production capital. According to his profile on the UCL web pages his work has taken him to more than 65 different countries.

His best known book, &quot;How Rich Countries Got Rich ... and Why Poor Countries Stay Poor&quot; (2007), has been widely reviewed and discussed. While some reviews, like those in Prospect Magazine, and The Economist, and others were dismissive many – including those from the developing countries – were positive and even those in publications generally opposed to Reinert&#x27;s framework, such as Martin Wolf in the Financial Times, have called the book an important contribution to the debate. According to NORLA - a Norwegian organization concerned with of Norwegian books abroad, &quot;How Rich Countries Got Rich and Why Poor Countries Stay Poor&quot; has been translated into 27 languages.

The main message of the book is that neo-classical economics damage developing countries, mostly via adherence to the theory of comparative advantage of David Ricardo, an English economist of the 19th century. The theory posits the virtues of trade irrespective of the nature of the goods traded. Based on a long intellectual tradition - started by the Italian economists Giovanni Botero (1589) and Antonio Serra (1613), Reinert recalls that the country which trades increasing returns goods – e.g. high-end manufacture – has advantages over the country which trades diminishing returns goods – e.g. commodities. As Botero argued, the combination of economic diversity and adding value to raw materials are key elements that make nations rich.
Since the Renaissance, argues Reinert, successful countries – including England and the United States - have first protected their nascent manufactures, then opened themselves to the world markets. Citing Friedrich List, a 19th-century German economist, Erik Reinert suggest that protectionism is thus important and that free trade is only mutually beneficial among countries of the same level of development. 
No country can achieve development without a sustained level of industrialization, and no poor country can achieve this in the strictures of free trade. For this reason, Reinert calls the Millennium development goals ‘palliative economics’, and presents historical records of conscient strategic behaviour of the colonial countries to keep their colonies de-industrialized.
Reinert refers to former World Bank Chief Economist Justin Yifu Lin who affirms that ‘Except for a few oil-exporting countries, no countries have ever gotten rich without industrialization first’.

In 2008, Reinert received the annual Gunnar Myrdal Prize as best monograph in evolutionary political economy, and in 2010 he was the only Norwegian economist invited to the Cambridge opening conference of the Institute for New Economic Thinking, financed by George Soros.

Based on his experience in the Andes and studies of economic anthropology at Cornell University, Reinert has also worked as an adjunct professor at Sámi University of Applied Sciences in Kautokeino, Norway, and published on the economics of reindeer herding and climate change.

An original strand of research originated at the Kress Library at Harvard Business School, where his wife Fernanda worked as a librarian, Erik Reinert and his wife have been investigating the history of economic thought from the point of view of the record of economics books - published before 1750 and 1850 respectively - which reached more than 10 editions (including translations) before 1850. Several former economic bestsellers are today virtually unknown.

His work on the role of the state in economic growth has been republished in Chinese, Estonian, Russian, and Spanish.

A recurrent theme in the work of Erik Reinert is the cyclicality of economic thought and theories, and the role of development geography in economics.

<doc id="581598" wikidata="Q2864541" url="?curid=581598" title="Art James">
<text>Art James (born Arthur Simeonovich Efimchick; October 15, 1929 – March 28, 2004) was an American game-show host, best known for shows such as &quot;The Who, What, or Where Game&quot;; &quot;It&#x27;s Academic&quot;; and &quot;Pay Cards!&quot; He was also the announcer and substitute host on the game show &quot;Concentration.&quot;

==Biography==
James was born in Dearborn, Michigan, to Russian immigrants (fluent in Russian, he taught English to Russian immigrants). He attended Wayne State University in nearby Detroit, where he studied engineering. He worked as an announcer for the Armed Forces Network while stationed in Germany after World War II.

An old Army friend, who was an executive with NBC, asked James to audition for a new game show, &quot;Concentration,&quot; hosted by Hugh Downs, which needed an announcer. &quot;Concentration&quot; ran from 1958–73, and was NBC&#x27;s longest-running game show. He went on to either announce or host over a dozen game shows, including &quot;Say When!!&quot;; &quot;It&#x27;s Academic&quot;; &quot;The Who, What, or Where Game&quot;; &quot;Pay Cards!&quot;; &quot;Temptation&quot;; &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot;; &quot;Blank Check&quot;; &quot;The Magnificent Marble Machine&quot;; &quot;Concentration&quot;; &quot;Catchphrase&quot;; and &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot;. He also made an appearance in Kevin Smith&#x27;s movie &quot;Mallrats&quot;.

He started Art James Productions in 1975 with his business partner and producer, Dan Cross. Their joint company staged game shows that were specially created to communicate marketing and corporate strategies to key stakeholders of Fortune 500 companies.

One episode of &quot;Say When!&quot; included a classic blooper by James while doing a live in-show commercial for Peter Pan peanut butter; during the sales pitch, he dropped a knife into the near-empty glass jar, breaking out the bottom and causing the knife to fall through. Though he struggled to keep from laughing, and because a retake was impossible, James still finished the commercial. The gaffe has been shown on many blooper specials.

==Later years and death==
James was a frequent contributor to &quot;TV Guide&quot;, writing about the world of game shows. He was living in Chaska, Minnesota, at the end of his life, and died of unspecified natural causes during a visit to his brother in Palm Springs, California.

<text>The Kingdom of the Iberians () was a medieval Georgian monarchy under the Bagrationi dynasty which emerged circa 888 AD, succeeding the Principality of Iberia, in historical region of Tao-Klarjeti, or upper Iberia in north-eastern Turkey as well parts of modern southwestern Georgia, that stretched from the Iberian gates in the south and to the Lesser Caucasus in the north.

Historically, the area comprised the following historical districts: West of the Arsiani Mountains were Tao, Klarjeti, Nigali, and Shavsheti, to the east lay Meskheti, Erusheti, Javakheti, Artaani, Abotsi, Kola and Basiani. The landscape is characterised by mountains and the river-systems of the Çoruh and the Kura. The region played a crucial role in the unification of all Georgian lands and principalities into the Kingdom of Georgia in 1008.

== History ==

=== Establishment ===
In 813, the last Iberian prince Ashot I of the Bagrationi dynasty established himself in his patrimonial Duchy of Klarjeti, where he restored the castle of Artanuji, said to have been built by the king Vakhtang I of Iberia in the 5th century, and received the Byzantine protection. Being recognized as the presiding prince and curopalates of Iberia, Ashot fought the Arabs from there, gradually incorporating the surrounding lands from the Arab dominance.

Ashot I encouraged resettlement of Georgians in these lands, and patronized monastic life initiated by the prominent Georgian ecclesiastic figure Gregory of Khandzta ( 759–861). For a long time the region became a cultural safe-house and one of the most important religious centers of Georgia. As a result, the political and religious center of Iberia was effectively transferred from central Iberia to the south-west, in Tao-Klarjeti. The geographical position of the princedom, between the great Empires of the East and the West, and the fact that one branch of the Silk Road ran through its territory, meant that it was subject to a constant stream of diverging influences.

With local Arab emirs in the Caucasus growing ever more independent, the Caliph recognized Ashot as the prince of Iberia in order to counter the rebellious emir of Tbilisi Isma’il ibn Shu’aib c. 818. The emir of Tbilisi had enlisted support of Ashot&#x27;s foe, the prince Grigol of Kakheti and the Georgian highland tribes of Tsanars. Ashot allied himself with king Theodosius II of Abkhazia and met the emir on the Ksani, winning a victory and pushing the Kakhetians from central Iberia. But when the governor of Arminiya, Khalid ibn Yazid al-Shaybani reasserted control over eastern Georgia, Ashot was pushed back to Tao-Klarjeti.

=== Division ===
On Ashot the Great&#x27;s death he divided his principality between his three sons:

* The eldest son Adarnase II (826–869), a grand duke (Eristavt-Eristavi), ruled the capital, Artanuji, and the centre of his father&#x27;s territory, Shavsheti, and western Klarjeti.
* The middle son Bagrat I (826–876) ruled the district of Kola and most of Tao, which reached deep into Anatolia and, eventually, proved to be the strategic core of Ashot&#x27;s domain.
* The youngest son Guaram (826–882) ruled the north: Samtskhe, Javakheti and Trialeti (western Kartli), and had the non-regal title Mampali meaning &#x27;ruler&#x27;.
Upon Ashot&#x27;s death, Arabs seized Kartli (central Iberia) and demanded taxes from the remaining domains. Bagrat I allied himself with Caliph against Emirate of Tbilisi and Principality of Kakheti. In 853, now supporting Bugha al-Kabir, Bagrat regained central Iberia, but only for a brief time as the resurgent Abkhazians forced him out of this region.

Ashot&#x27;s eldest son, Grand Duke Adarnase II, was the first brother to die. His possessions were equally divided among his sons: Gurgen I obtained Tao, while Sumbat I received Klarjeti.

Ashot&#x27;s youngest son, Guaram pursued an aggressive policy of expansion. In 880 he seized the Bagratids&#x27; traditional foe, the Arab emir of Tbilisi, named Gabulots, and sent him in chains to Constantinople, a triumph which won him Trialeti and Javakheti. Prior to 876, Guaram handed over some of his possessions to his brothers and retired himself at the Opiza convent where he was buried after his death in 882.

=== Dynastic strife ===
Liparit, of the Liparitids, took over Trialeti, where he built the stronghold Klde-Karni and placed himself under suzerainty of Guaram&#x27;s nephew David I (son of Bagrat I) soon after 876. These rearrangements left Guaram&#x27;s son Nasra essentially with no inheritance and probably induced him in 881 to murder his cousin David I in a plot. After the murder, Nasra fled to the Byzantine territory from where he was retrieved by his brother-in-law Bagrat I of Abkhazia, the latter managed to secure the Byzantine military aid and invaded the Bagratid possessions on Nasra&#x27;s behalf. Anxious to counterbalance the Byzantine influence in the Caucasus, Ashot I of Armenia interfered in support of David I&#x27;s son Adnarnase. Thus, a Bagratid dynastic feud evolved into a regional conflict. Nasra succeeded in taking the forts of Odzrkhe, Juaristsikhe and Lomsianta, but was finally defeated, captured and put to death at Aspindza.

As Adarnase was still a minor, the Byzantine emperor – pursuant to the policy of division – appointed as curopalates, not Adarnase, but his cousin Gurgen I of Tao. Allied with the resurgent Armenians, Adarnase then launched, from his base in Lower Tao, a policy of expansion. Not being a curopalates and having Armenia&#x27;s example before him, Adarnase assumed the title of king. The relations between Adarnase and Gurgen grew tense and degenerated into an open warfare. Gurgen was fatally wounded and captured at Mglinavi near Artaani by Adarnase and his ally Bagrat I of Klarjeti (son of Sumbat I) in 891. The Byzantine government adapted itself to the circumstances and, upon Gurgen death in 891, recognized Adarnase as curopalates.

Gurgen I of Tao left two sons behind – Adarnase and Ashot the Immature – thus being a founder of the Bagratid &quot;first house of Tao&quot; which would become extinct with his grandson Gurgen II (r. 918–941).

=== Restoration of the Kingdom ===

Adarnase rewarded Ashot I of Armenia&#x27;s assistance with steadfast loyalty which continued into the reign of Ashot&#x27;s successor Smbat I whom Adarnase aided to win the crown in dynastic struggles in 890 and later joined him against Ahmed ibn-&#x27;Isâ of Diyarbakır, the Caliph’s former governor of Armīniya. In turn, Smbat recognized Adarnase&#x27;s royal status and personally crowned him in 899. The two men collaborated in defeating, in 904, the Abkhazian king Constantine III, their common relative, who competed with Adarnase for hegemony in Inner Iberia and with Smbat in Gogarene. Adarnase captured Constantine and turned him over to Smbat. But the latter, inclined to balance Adarnase&#x27;s growing power and extend Armenian influence to west Georgia, freed his captive. This move turned Adarnase against Smbat and the ensuing break and enmity weakened both monarchs: Adarnase was dispossessed by Constantine III in 904, while Smbat was defeated and tortured to death by Yusuf, a Sajid ruler of Azerbaijan in 914. As a result of these events, Adarnase was relegated to his portion of the Bagratid hereditary lands in Tao. This was the beginning of almost sixty years of Abkhazian dominance over Iberia.

Upon Adarnase&#x27;s death, his possessions were divided between his sons:

* The eldest son David II&#x27;s (r. 923–937) control was limited to Javakheti and Artaani as the core lands of Inner Iberia were under the Abkhazian control.
* The second son Ashot II&#x27;s (r. 937–954) original holding was Lower Tao. He also received Phasiane from the Byzantine emperor in c. 952.
* The third son Bagrat I (r. 937–945) obtained Upper Tao following the death of his relative Gurgen II of Tao (r. 918–941).
* The youngest son Sumbat I (r. 954–958) obtained lands and titles following the death of his brother Ashot II.

In spite of his royal title and unlike his father, David II did not bear the traditional high Byzantine title of &quot;curopalates&quot; which was bestowed by the emperor upon David&#x27;s younger brother Ashot II. David only had the title of &quot;magistros&quot; which he shared with his relative Gurgen II of Tao. As a result, David&#x27;s influence and prestige were overshadowed by those of his younger brother. Both Gurgen II of Tao and David resolutely opposed the Byzantine takeover of the Bagratid town of Artanuji, a fief of Gurgen&#x27;s father-in-law, Ashot of Klarjeti.

=== Abkhazian dominance ===
George II of Abkhazia (r. 923–957) continued the expansionist policy of his predecessor aimed primarily at retaining the control of Iberia. To secure the allegiance of local nobility, in 917 he appointed his son Constantine as a viceroy of Iberia, but the latter staged a coup against his father three years later. George entered into Iberia and placed the city of Uplistsikhe under siege. He lured Constantine by treachery and had him blinded and castrated. George installed his another son, Leon (the future king Leon III) to secure his supremacy over Iberia, George allied himself with the Bagratids, and gave his daughter, Gurandukht to Gurgen Bagrationi (the son of Bagrat II) in marriage.

=== Independence ===

In 958, Sumbat I&#x27;s son Bagrat II took over his father&#x27;s titles (except for Couropalates) and only ruled Lower Tao. Bagrat frequently appeared as a collaborator of his relative David III of Tao, the most influential person among the Bagratids of that time, aiding him against the Rawadids of Azerbaijan.

=== Principality of Tao ===

A just ruler and a friend of the church, David allied with the Byzantine Emperor Basil II to defeat the rebel Byzantine noble Bardas Skleros ( 976–979) and was rewarded with extensive lands, known to the contemporary Georgian sources as the &quot;Upper Lands of Greece&quot;, that made him the most powerful ruler in the south Caucasus: his state included several former Kaysite lands consisting chiefly of lands up to the Lake Van. The only setback was the 987–989 unsuccessful conflict with the Byzantine Empire that forced David to agree to cede his dominion to Emperor Basil II on his death, whose domains later would be organized into the theme of Iberia.

With the strong intention to unite all Georgian lands, David adopted Prince Bagrat (the future King Bagrat III), a grandchild of Bagrat II, also being an Abkhazian heir apparent. In 975, David installed him as a residing prince in Kartli (central Iberia) and later as king of Abkhazia (978), and helped Bagrat&#x27;s natural father Gurgen to be crowned as King of Iberia on the death of Bagrat II in 994, thus making Bagrat a ruler of the two and heir apparent of another two Georgian states. Upon David of Tao&#x27;s death in 1001, Gurgen, and Bagrat met with Basil but, unable to prevent the annexation of David&#x27;s realm to the Byzantine Empire, were forced to recognize the new borders.

== Unification ==

Despite this reverse, Bagrat III was able to become the first ruler of the unified Georgian kingdom (officially called: &quot;the Kingdom of the Abkhazians and the Iberians&quot;) on his father&#x27;s death in 1008. Bagrat&#x27;s reign, a period of uttermost importance in the history of Georgia, brought about the final victory of the Georgian Bagratids in the centuries-long power struggles. Anxious to create more stable and centralized monarchy, Bagrat eliminated or at least diminished the autonomy of the dynastic princes. In his eyes, the most possible internal danger came from the Klarjeti line of the Bagrationi, represented by the king&#x27;s cousins, Sumbat and Gurgen. Although seem to have acknowledged Bagrat&#x27;s authority, they continued to be styled as Kings, and Sovereigns of Klarjeti. To secure the succession to his son, George, Bagrat lured his cousins, on pretext of a reconciliatory meeting, to the Panaskerti Castle, and threw them in prison in 1010. Their children managed to escape to Constantinople, but Sumbat and Gurgen died in custody by 1012.

<text>Yeghegnadzor ( ) is a town and urban municipal community in southern Armenia, serving as the provincial capital of Vayots Dzor Province and the Yeghegnadzor Municipality. It is located at a road distance of south of the capital Yerevan, on the shores of Srkghonk River (), at a height of above sea level.

As per the 2016 official estimate, Yeghegnadzor had a population of around 6,600. As of the 2011 census, the population of the town was 7,944. Yeghegnadzor is the seat of the Diocese of Vayots Dzor of the Armenian Apostolic Church.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Yeghegnadzor&quot; consists of two Armenian words: &quot;yegheg&quot; () meaning &quot;cane&quot;, and &quot;dzor&quot; () meaning &quot;valley&quot;. Thus, the name of the town means &quot;valley of canes&quot;.

==History==
The settlement was first mentioned as Pondzatagh during the 5th century. Historically, it belongs to the Vayots Dzor canton of Syunik; the 9th province of Greater Armenia (Armenia Major). However, the excavated layer of a cemetery and the remains of a mausoleum from the 1st millennium BC testify that the area has been settled long before the 5th century. The remains of the Urartian fortress near the town dates back to the 7th century BC.

According to historical records from the 1st quarter of the 9th century, when Syunats Prince Philip, son of Vasak, moved his residence from Sisian to Vayots Dzor and fortified in Yeghegis, the name Yeghegnadzor or Yeghegyats Dzor spread across the entire province. During the Middle Ages, the Silk Road passed through the area of Vayots Dzor, particularly the road that currently links the town of Martuni with Yeghegnadzor. Many significant churches, monastic complexes, bridges and caravanserais were built in the region between the 10th and 13th centuries, when Yeghegnadzor was part of the Kingdom of Syunik under the rule of the Siunia dynasty.
At the beginning of the 16th century, Eastern Armenia fell under the Safavid Persian rule. The territory of Yeghegnadzor became part of the &quot;Erivan Beglarbegi&quot; and later the Erivan Khanate. The period between the 16th and 17th centuries is considered to be the darkest period in the history of Yeghegnadzor. The region was turned into a frequent battlefield between the invading troops of the Turkic and Iranian tribes. As a result, many significant monuments and prosperous villages were destroyed and the population was displaced. In 1747, Yeghegnadzor became part of the newly-formed Nakhichevan Khanate. By the beginning of the 19th century, Yeghgnadzor was known as Keshishkend.

As a result of the Treaty of Turkmenchay signed between the Russian Empire and Persia in 1828 following the Russo-Persian War of 1826–28, many territories of Eastern Armenia -including Vayots Dzor- became part of the Russian Empire. In 1828-30, many Armenian families from the Iranian towns of Salmas and Khoy were resettled in Eastern Armenia, particularly in the areas that later became part of the Erivan Governorate in 1840. The first wave of Armenian settlers arrived in the Vayots Dzor region in 1828-29. In 1870, Yeghegnadzor became part of the newly-formed Sharur-Daralagezsky Uyezd of the Erivan Governorate within the Russian Empire.

Between 1918 and 1920 it was included in the short-lived Republic of Armenia. After the Sovietization of Armenia, the town became one of the predominant centres of the resistance against the Soviet rule and formed the unrecognized Republic of Mountainous Armenia under the leadership of Garegin Nzhdeh. However, after falling to the Bolsheviks in July 1921, it became part of the Armenian SSR.

The town was known as Keshishkend until 1935 when it was renamed Mikoyan after the Bolshevik leader Anastas Mikoyan. On 6 December 1956, the town was renamed Yeghegnadzor, restoring its historical name.

Following the independence of Armenia in 1991, Yeghegnadzor became the capital of the newly-formed Vayots Dzor Province as per the 1995 administrative reforms.

==Geography and climate==
Yeghegnadzor is situated at 1,194 metres above sea level. The lower and medium highlands are mainly semi-deserts. It is built across the right and left banks of the Srkghonk River, a tributary of the Arpa River. The town is immediately bordered by the village of Gladzor from the north.

The town has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfa&quot;) and large diurnal temperature fluctuations with the average annual rainfalls of 400 mm and mountain-valley winds. The average air temperature in January is 5-6◦C, with a coldest temperature of -22◦C and highest of +35◦C in July. The climate is mild with snowy winters and warm summers.

The surrounding areas of the town are home to some mammals including bezoar ibex, wolf and fox; reptiles including adder and viper; and birds including partridge and sparrow.

The park is also home to a &quot;vishapakar&quot; (dragon stone) dating back to the 2nd millennium BC.

The people in Yeghegnadzor are mainly conservative. They largely celebrate the religious and traditional feasts, including Trndez and Vardavar. However, the most popular celebration in the town is the harvest festival, taking place every year on the second Sunday of October. Locals from all villages take part in the parade on cars decorated with flowers, bringing their own crops, berries typical to their territories. Theatrical shows and concerts are being held during the festival.

Yeghegnadzor is also popular for its cheese. Yeghegnadzor cheese is made from pasteurized cow&#x27;s or goat&#x27;s milk (or both) and mixed with local greens. It is stored in individual clay pots, then buried in the mountains and left to mature for at least 6 months before consumption. The flavors are strong, sharp, and salty, while the addition of mountain greens gives the cheese even more unique flavors. The texture is semi-soft, and crumbly.

<text>Frank Francis Fasi (August 27, 1920 – February 3, 2010) was an American politician who was the longest-serving Mayor of Honolulu, Hawaii, serving for 22 years. He also served as a territorial senator and member of the Honolulu City Council. To date, he remains the last Republican Mayor of Honolulu.

==Early life==

Frank Francis Fasi was born on 27 August 1920 in Hartford, Connecticut, to Sicilian immigrants Carmelo and Josephine Lupo Fasi. Carmelo owned an ice business, and Frank began working for his father at age 11. He finished 7th out of his class of 476 in high school, and graduated from Trinity College where he had been a history major on an academic scholarship.

Fasi tried to join the United States Marine Corps after graduation from Trinity. The Marines turned him down because of his color blindness. On his second try, he hired a friend to take the eye test for him, and he became a Marine. He served in the Pacific Theater of World War II and was briefly stationed on Kauai. He was discharged as a first lieutenant in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1946, and immediately returned to Hawaii. In 1956, he resigned his commission as captain in the Marine Corps Reserve.

Fasi settled in Honolulu, where he became an entrepreneur, opening his own contracting, building demolition and salvage company.

==Political career==

In 1958, Fasi entered politics, winning his first race to represent his district in the senate of the Territory of Hawaii. His term was cut short when Hawaii achieved statehood and the territorial legislature was dissolved in 1959. After returning to his business, Fasi once again ran for office in 1965, winning a seat on the Honolulu City Council, where he served as a councilman through 1968.

===Mayor of Honolulu===
By the late 1960s, Fasi had gained a colorful reputation. &quot;The Honolulu Advertiser&quot; and &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; newspapers were using the words &quot;firebrand,&quot; &quot;trailblazer,&quot; and &quot;maverick&quot; to describe him. In 1969, Fasi was elected mayor of Honolulu as a Democrat and served through 1981 when he was defeated for the first time for re-election in the Democratic primary by Eileen Anderson. He then joined the Republican Party to stage a comeback and defeated Anderson in the 1984 election, returning to Honolulu Hale once again and serving as mayor through 1994, when he resigned to seek the Hawaii governorship. After losing his 2004 bid for the office of mayor, Fasi, then 84 years old, announced that he would not run for office again. , he is the last Republican to have served as Mayor of Honolulu, Hawaii.

Fasi served 22 years as the mayor of Honolulu, the longest cumulative tenure of any Honolulu mayor.

===Best Party===
Fasi was a member of the Democratic Party in his early years. In 1984, he was persuaded by D. G. Anderson to quit and join the Republican Party. In 1994, both parties pushed him away in favor of younger, more popular candidates. In retaliation, Fasi established the Best Party of Hawaii and ran for Governor of Hawaii against Patricia F. Saiki and Benjamin J. Cayetano. John P. Craven ran against Fasi in the party&#x27;s primary. Fasi lost the general election, but his party lives on as the Aloha Āina Party of Hawaii, with which it merged in 1997.

== Indictment for corruption ==
Fasi was indicted for bribery in 1977 on charges of accepting $500,000 in bribes. The charges were later dropped.

==Legacy==
Much of Honolulu retains reminders of the Fasi era. He opened the Neal S. Blaisdell Center, and established TheBus, a public transportation system. Fasi also invented and built the Satellite City Hall system, established one of the nation&#x27;s largest elected neighborhood board systems, and pushed for the construction of the H-POWER waste-to-energy plant. Fasi created the Summer Fun recreational program for children and the annual Honolulu City Lights winter festival. Fasi popularized the &quot;shaka,&quot; a local hand gesture, when he ordered it to become the city&#x27;s signature logo and printed on all city signs and publications. He is also credited with transforming the Capitol District by bulldozing massive parking structures near the Hawaii State Capitol, Iolani Palace and Kawaiahao Church to create large parcels of green space known as the Honolulu Civic Center. He also created a central office building for many of the city&#x27;s departments.

In recognition of Fasi&#x27;s service to Honolulu, Mayor Mufi Hannemann renamed both the Civic Center and the Municipal Building in July 2006. In order to do so, the Honolulu City Council amended its charter with the passage of Bill 76 (2005) CD 1, FD 1, which bypassed a ban on naming city and county sites in honor of living persons. The Mayor Frank F. Fasi Civic Center and Mayor Frank F. Fasi Municipal Building now stand as memorials to him.

==Death==
Fasi died at his home of natural causes on February 3, 2010. He was 89.

==Organization membership==

Frank Fasi was a member of the following organizations:

*American Legion
*Rotary International
*Sigma Nu
*Veterans of Foreign Wars

<doc id="581610" wikidata="Q1548483" url="?curid=581610" title="Kummer theory">
<text>In abstract algebra and number theory, Kummer theory provides a description of certain types of field extensions involving the adjunction of &quot;n&quot;th roots of elements of the base field. The theory was originally developed by Ernst Eduard Kummer around the 1840s in his pioneering work on Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. The main statements do not depend on the nature of the field – apart from its characteristic, which should not divide the integer &quot;n&quot; – and therefore belong to abstract algebra. The theory of cyclic extensions of the field &quot;K&quot; when the characteristic of &quot;K&quot; does divide &quot;n&quot; is called Artin–Schreier theory.

Kummer theory is basic, for example, in class field theory and in general in understanding abelian extensions; it says that in the presence of enough roots of unity, cyclic extensions can be understood in terms of extracting roots. The main burden in class field theory is to dispense with extra roots of unity (&#x27;descending&#x27; back to smaller fields); which is something much more serious.

== Kummer extensions ==
A Kummer extension is a field extension &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;, where for some given integer &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1 we have

*&quot;K&quot; contains &quot;n&quot; distinct &quot;n&quot;th roots of unity (i.e., roots of &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 1)
*&quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; has abelian Galois group of exponent &quot;n&quot;.

For example, when &quot;n&quot; = 2, the first condition is always true if &quot;K&quot; has characteristic ≠ 2. The Kummer extensions in this case include quadratic extensions formula_1 where &quot;a&quot; in &quot;K&quot; is a non-square element. By the usual solution of quadratic equations, any extension of degree 2 of &quot;K&quot; has this form. The Kummer extensions in this case also include biquadratic extensions and more general multiquadratic extensions. When &quot;K&quot; has characteristic 2, there are no such Kummer extensions.

Taking &quot;n&quot; = 3, there are no degree 3 Kummer extensions of the rational number field Q, since for three cube roots of 1 complex numbers are required. If one takes &quot;L&quot; to be the splitting field of &quot;X&quot;3 − &quot;a&quot; over Q, where &quot;a&quot; is not a cube in the rational numbers, then &quot;L&quot; contains a subfield &quot;K&quot; with three cube roots of 1; that is because if α and β are roots of the cubic polynomial, we shall have (α/β)3 =1 and the cubic is a separable polynomial. Then &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is a Kummer extension.

More generally, it is true that when &quot;K&quot; contains &quot;n&quot; distinct &quot;n&quot;th roots of unity, which implies that the characteristic of &quot;K&quot; doesn&#x27;t divide &quot;n&quot;, then adjoining to &quot;K&quot; the &quot;n&quot;th root of any element &quot;a&quot; of &quot;K&quot; creates a Kummer extension (of degree &quot;m&quot;, for some &quot;m&quot; dividing &quot;n&quot;). As the splitting field of the polynomial &quot;Xn&quot; − &quot;a&quot;, the Kummer extension is necessarily Galois, with Galois group that is cyclic of order &quot;m&quot;. It is easy to track the Galois action via the root of unity in front of formula_2

Kummer theory provides converse statements. When &quot;K&quot; contains &quot;n&quot; distinct &quot;n&quot;th roots of unity, it states that any abelian extension of &quot;K&quot; of exponent dividing &quot;n&quot; is formed by extraction of roots of elements of &quot;K&quot;. Further, if &quot;K&quot;× denotes the multiplicative group of non-zero elements of &quot;K&quot;, abelian extensions of &quot;K&quot; of exponent &quot;n&quot; correspond bijectively with subgroups of

:formula_3

that is, elements of &quot;K&quot;× modulo &quot;n&quot;th powers. The correspondence can be described explicitly as follows. Given a subgroup

:formula_4

the corresponding extension is given by

:formula_5

where 

:formula_6 

In fact it suffices to adjoin &quot;n&quot;th root of one representative of each element of any set of generators of the group Δ. Conversely, if &quot;L&quot; is a Kummer extension of &quot;K&quot;, then Δ is recovered by the rule

:formula_7

In this case there is an isomorphism

:formula_8

given by

:formula_9

where α is any &quot;n&quot;th root of &quot;a&quot; in &quot;L&quot;. Here formula_10 denotes the multiplicative group of &quot;n&quot;th roots of unity (which belong to &quot;K&quot;) and formula_11 is the group of continuous homomorphisms from formula_12 equipped with Krull topology to formula_10 with discrete topology (with group operation given by pointwise multiplication). This group (with discrete topology) can also be viewed as Pontryagin dual of formula_12, assuming we regard formula_10 as a subgroup of circle group. If the extension &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is finite, then formula_12 is a finite discrete group and we have

:formula_17

however the last isomorphism isn&#x27;t natural.

=== Recovering from a primitive element ===
For formula_18 prime, let formula_19 be a field containing formula_20 and formula_21 a degree formula_18 Galois extension. Note the Galois group is cyclic, generated by formula_23. Let 

:formula_24

Then 

:formula_25 

Since formula_26 and 

:formula_27,
where the formula_28 sign is formula_29 if formula_18 is odd and formula_31 if formula_32.

When formula_33 is an abelian extension of degree formula_34 square-free such that formula_35, apply the same argument to the subfields formula_36 Galois of degree formula_37 to obtain 

:formula_38 

where 

:formula_39.

== The Kummer Map ==
One of the main tools in Kummer theory is the Kummer map. Let formula_40 be a positive integer and let formula_19 be a field, not necessarily containing the formula_40th roots of unity. Letting formula_43 denote the algebraic closure of formula_19, there is a short exact sequence

formula_45

Choosing an extension formula_33 and taking formula_47-cohomology one obtains the sequence

formula_48

By Hilbert&#x27;s Theorem 90 formula_49, and hence we get an isomorphism formula_50. This is the Kummer map. A version of this map also exists when all formula_40 are considered simultaneously. Namely, since formula_52, taking the direct limit over formula_40 yields an isomorphism

formula_54,

where &quot;tors&quot; denotes the torsion subgroup of roots of unity.

== For Elliptic Curves ==
Kummer theory is often used in the context of elliptic curves. Let formula_55 be an elliptic curve. There is a short exact sequence

formula_56,

where the multiplication by formula_40 map is surjective since formula_58 is divisible. Choosing an algebraic extension formula_33 and taking cohomology, we obtain the Kummer sequence for formula_58:

formula_61.

The computation of the weak Mordell-Weil group formula_62 is a key part of the proof of the Mordell-Weil theorem. The failure of formula_63 to vanish adds a key complexity to the theory.

== Generalizations ==

Suppose that &quot;G&quot; is a profinite group acting on a module &quot;A&quot; with a surjective homomorphism π from the &quot;G&quot;-module &quot;A&quot; to itself. Suppose also that &quot;G&quot; acts trivially on the kernel &quot;C&quot; of π and that the first cohomology group H1(&quot;G&quot;,&quot;A&quot;) is trivial. Then the exact sequence of group cohomology shows that there is an isomorphism between &quot;A&quot;&quot;G&quot;/π(&quot;A&quot;&quot;G&quot;) and Hom(&quot;G&quot;,&quot;C&quot;).

Kummer theory is the special case of this when &quot;A&quot; is the multiplicative group of the separable closure of a field &quot;k&quot;, &quot;G&quot; is the Galois group, π is the &quot;n&quot;th power map, and &quot;C&quot; the group of &quot;n&quot;th roots of unity. Artin–Schreier theory is the special case when &quot;A&quot; is the additive group of the separable closure of a field &quot;k&quot; of positive characteristic &quot;p&quot;, &quot;G&quot; is the Galois group, π is the Frobenius map minus the identity, and &quot;C&quot; the finite field of order &quot;p&quot;. Taking &quot;A&quot; to be a ring of truncated Witt vectors gives Witt&#x27;s generalization of Artin–Schreier theory to extensions of exponent dividing &quot;pn&quot;.

<doc id="581612" wikidata="Q2723815" url="?curid=581612" title="Parthiv Patel">
<text>Parthiv Ajay Patel (born 9 March 1985) is a former Indian professional cricketer, wicketkeeper-batsman, who played for the Indian national cricket team. He is a left-handed batsman and played for Gujarat in domestic cricket. Having lost a finger at the age of 9, he initially found it hard to keep wickets, but after enough practice, he got used to it. When Parthiv played for the Indian team in 2002, he became the youngest wicket-keeper to represent a country in Tests. He was a part of the Indian squad which won the 2016 Asia Cup.

In December 2020, Patel announced his retirement from all forms of cricket. After his retirement, Patel joined Mumbai Indians as a Talent Scout. He is also now seen as a commentator in the Indian Premier League and International Matches too.

In November 2024, Patel was appointed as the assistant and batting coach of Gujarat Titans for the upcoming season of the Indian Premier League.

== Domestic career ==
Patel led the Gujarat side in the 2016–17 Ranji Trophy. Beating Odisha and Jharkhand in the quarterfinal and semifinal, the team reached the final for only the second time. In the final in January, they met defending champions Mumbai in Indore. Patel scored 90 in the first inning and 143 in the second and helped beat Gujarat to win its first Trophy. Patel&#x27;s 143 was the highest in a successful chase in a Ranji Trophy final. The win also made Gujarat the first team and Patel the first captain to have won all three major titles in domestic cricket in India.

In July 2018, he was named as the captain for India Green for the 2018–19 Duleep Trophy. In October 2019, he was named as the captain of India B for the 2019–20 Deodhar Trophy.

===Indian Premier League===
Patel was auctioned in the inaugural Indian Premier League (IPL) to Chennai Super Kings. He used to be a regular in the team and opened with the former Australian opener Matthew Hayden. He did not keep wicket as the Indian wicketkeeper as captain MS Dhoni was in the team. For the fourth season, he was signed by Kochi Tuskers Kerala. On 16 May, it was announced that Parthiv will be leading the Kochi Tuskers Kerala for the rest of the 2011 Indian Premier League. As a result of the termination of Kochi Tuskers franchise, Parthiv along with the other players from the franchise was once again auctioned for the 2012 Indian Premier League season. He was picked by Deccan Chargers for $1m
During the 2012 IPL Trading Window. Parthiv was picked up by Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2013 and by Royal Challenger Bangalore in 2014. Patel was signed by Mumbai Indians for the 2015 IPL as an opening batsmen.

In January 2018, he was bought by the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the 2018 IPL auction.

===Other franchise cricket===

In 2022, Gujarat Giants selected him in the Legends League Cricket and gave him the captaincy in the 2023 Legends League Cricket season.

== International career ==

Parthiv debuted in the year 2002 against England at Trent Bridge at 17 years and 153 days to become Test Cricket&#x27;s youngest wicketkeeper. He had replaced the injured Ajay Ratra and eclipsed the record previously held by Pakistan&#x27;s Hanif Mohammed (17 years and 300 days). He played out an hour in the match while batting and hence saved India from defeat. However, with the emergence of Dhoni and poor wicketkeeping, he was sidelined for a few matches in 2004.

On 23 November 2016, Parthiv Patel was called up as a replacement for the regular wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha who had a thigh strain, for the third Test (at Mohali) of the India-England home series. He played his first Test in eight years, having missed 83 Test matches between appearances.

Patel made his ODI debut against New Zealand in January 2003. He was selected in the Indian squad for the 2003 Cricket World Cup but did not play any games, with Rahul Dravid being used as a makeshift wicket-keeper to allow the use of an extra batsman or bowler. With this policy in place, Patel only made intermittent appearances in ODIs, usually when Dravid was injured or being rested (in full or from wicket-keeping duties). He played 13 ODIs in a two-year span, and during an interrupted career managed only an average of 14.66 and a top-score of 28 and was dropped thereafter. Parthiv returned to the Indian team in 2010 in the 4th and 5th Odi vs New Zealand. He celebrated this moment by hitting two back to back half centuries. Later on he was called up for replacing injured Sachin Tendulkar in India tour South Africa .

===Tour of West Indies 2011===
With wicket-keeper captain MS Dhoni rested for the tour along with several seniors such as Sachin Tendulkar, Zaheer Khan, he was entrusted with the job of wicket-keeping in the tour along with Wriddhiman Saha. In the lone T20I match played in the tour, he made his T20I debut at the Queen&#x27;s Park Oval at Port-of-Spain. He opened the batting along with another left-handed debutante Shikhar Dhawan and made a 26 from 20 balls. In the second ODI against West Indies he scored 56 not out.

===England tour of India 2016===
With wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha injured, Parthiv was called to test team duty for the third test in Mohali. He proved the selectors&#x27; decision was right with two good innings including an unbeaten 67 runs from 54 balls in the second innings which led India to victory.

===One of the Indian cricketers to play T20 match in 2005===
Parthiv Patel, along with Robin Singh and Rohan Gavaskar played their first T20 match in 2005. This was the early phase of t20 format. But the first Indian cricketer to play a t20 match was Dinesh Mongia. He played his debut match in July 2004.

<text>A grand union is a rail track junction where two double-track railway or tramway lines cross at grade, often in a street intersection or crossroads. A total of sixteen railroad switches (sets of points) allow streetcars (or in rarer installations, trains) coming from any direction to take any of the three other directions. The same effect may be achieved with two adjacent wyes if the location allows for space.

==Complexity==
These types of complex junction are expensive to build and expensive to maintain. Special parts, sometimes made of manganese steel, are needed for each location where one rail crossed another (a &quot;frog&quot;); these parts often need to be custom-made and fitted for each single location, depending on the specific angle of crossing of the intersecting streets.

A full grand union junction consists of 88 frogs (where one rail crosses another rail), and 32 switchpoints (point blades) if single-point switches are not used. A tram or train crossing the junction will encounter four or twenty frogs within the space of crossing the junction.

For all of the possible tracks of a grand union to be used during normal operation, at least six different tram routes have to cross the union. In an intersection with lines oriented towards cardinal directions, these could be: north-south, north-east, north-west, south-east, south-west, and east–west.

== Three-quarter, half and butterfly unions ==
Three-quarter unions are similar to grand unions in that they are also rail track junctions where two double-track railway lines cross at grade, often in a street intersection or crossroads; the primary difference being that one corner of the crossing does not have curved junction tracks, with the union having a total of 12 railroad switches (sets of points).

Half unions are similar, but have curved junction tracks on only two adjoining corners of the intersection, with a total of eight switches.

Butterfly unions share the total of eight switches, but the curved junction tracks are on opposing corners.

<doc id="581625" wikidata="Q888675" url="?curid=581625" title="Bobby Short">
<text>Robert Waltrip Short (September 15, 1924 – March 21, 2005) was an American cabaret singer and pianist who interpreted songs by popular composers from the first half of the 20th century such as Rodgers and Hart, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, Harold Arlen, Richard A. Whiting, Vernon Duke, Noël Coward and George and Ira Gershwin.

Short also championed African-American composers of the same period such as Eubie Blake, James P. Johnson, Andy Razaf, Fats Waller, Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn, presenting their work not in a polemical way, but as simply the obvious equal of that of their white contemporaries.

Short&#x27;s dedication to his great love – what he called the &quot;Great American Song&quot; – left him equally adept at performing the witty lyrics of Bessie Smith&#x27;s &quot;Gimme a Pigfoot (And a Bottle of Beer)&quot; or Gershwin and Duke&#x27;s &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Started&quot;. Short stated his favorite songwriters were Ellington, Arlen and Kern, and he was instrumental in spearheading the construction of the Ellington Memorial in New York City. He was a friend of Tom Jobim and was present during the composer&#x27;s final days in New York City.

==Early life==
Short was born in Danville, Illinois, where two of his school classmates were Dick Van Dyke and Donald O&#x27;Connor. He began performing piano in dance halls and saloons, and as a busker, after leaving home at age 11 for Chicago with his mother&#x27;s permission.

==Career==

Short began his adult musical career in clubs in the 1940s. In 1968 he was offered a two-week stint at the Café Carlyle in New York City, to fill in for George Feyer. Short (accompanied by Beverly Peer on bass and Dick Sheridan on drums) became an institution at the Carlyle, as Feyer had been before him, and remained there as a featured performer for more than 35 years. He often performed impromptu all-night sets at his various favorite cafes and restaurants. He was a regular patron at Ted Hook&#x27;s Backstage, at Eighth Avenue and 45th Street.

In 1971 Short published &quot;Black and White Baby&quot;, a brilliant description of his childhood upbringing in the dance halls and saloons of Chicago and New York, and his family&#x27;s fight for survival after the death of his father. He followed with &quot;Bobby Short: The Life and Times of a Saloon Singer&quot; in 1995, chronicling his career into the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.

Short continued his career in the 1970s and 1980s singing for films and television. In 1972, he performed the theme song to James Ivory&#x27;s film &quot;Savages&quot;. In 1976, Short sang and appeared in a commercial for Revlon&#x27;s perfume &quot;Charlie&quot;. In 1979 he performed a 25-song set that was released on DVD in 2004 as &quot;Bobby Short at the Cafe Carlyle&quot;. In 1981, he made a cameo appearance on &quot;The Love Boat&quot; in a two-part episode. In 1985, he sang part of the opening theme for the NBC television show &quot;Misfits of Science&quot;. Short continued working in films when, in 1986, he appeared in the Woody Allen film &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot;. Allen used Short&#x27;s recording of &quot;I Happen to Like New York&quot; for the opening title of &quot;Manhattan Murder Mystery&quot; (1993).

In 1991, Short made a guest appearance as blues musician Ches Collins on the TV series &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; in the episode &quot;Sweet, Sweet Blues&quot;. He also performed the episode&#x27;s theme song. He reprised the role in the 1994 episode &quot;Ches and the Grand Lady&quot;. In 1993, he made an appearance in the Michael J. Fox comedy film &quot;For Love or Money&quot;, performing Marc Shaiman&#x27;s song &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;. Short&#x27;s final film role was in &quot;Man of the Century&quot; (1999).

==Later years==

In 2000, the Library of Congress designated Short a Living Legend, a recognition established as part of its bicentennial celebration. The next year, his voice was featured in the 200th episode of the sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot;. In 2004, Short announced plans to end his regular appearances at the Café Carlyle by the end of the year. He continued to tour and travel until the end of his life.

==Awards==
Bobby Short was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and in 1983 was awarded the Order of Lincoln by the governor of Illinois (the state&#x27;s highest honor) in the area of performing arts.

==Personal life==
Short adopted nephew Ronald Bell of San Francisco, the son of Short&#x27;s older brother William.

Although Short never publicly declared he was gay, it was well known among his friends, fellow musicians, and some of his fans. When asked by a friend why he hadn&#x27;t taken part in any of the gay pride marches of the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s, Short&#x27;s response was, &quot;I have a living to make! I can&#x27;t afford to march in the Gay Pride Parade.&quot;

==Death==
On March 21, 2005, Short died of leukemia at New York Presbyterian Hospital. He is buried in Atherton Cemetery in Danville, Illinois, the city of his birth.

<text>Rachel Sweet (born July 28, 1962) is an American singer, television writer and actress.

==Early life and education==
Rachel Sweet was born in Akron, Ohio, Because she pursued her singing career so young, she dropped out of high school to concentrate on her career, but she was still required to devote time to her studies.

Sweet resumed her education via correspondence courses, and she eventually graduated from Columbia University with a degree in French and English Literature in 1988.

==Singing career==
Sweet began her singing career at age three when she won an electric garage door opener in a local talent contest after singing &quot;I&#x27;m a Little Dutch Girl.&quot; She began recording commercials at the age of six, toured with Mickey Rooney, and performed in Las Vegas as the opening act for Bill Cosby at the age of 12. She began recording country music in 1974, but with little success beyond one minor hit.

Switching to rock and roll, she signed to Stiff Records and released her first album, &quot;Fool Around&quot;, in 1978, dropping out of high school to concentrate on her career, although she was still required to devote time to her studies. Sweet was backed by The Records on the Stiff Records tour in 1978. The album was a critical success, but sales were poor, although she did have some success with the single &quot;B-A-B-Y&quot; (a cover of the 1966 Carla Thomas song), which was a top-40 hit in the UK. The record label generated some controversy by pushing a Lolita-like image for her. Her follow-up album, &quot;Protect the Innocent&quot;, produced by Martin Rushent and Alan Winstanley, was largely ignored by the public and the music press, although it was popular with her fans and launched a well-received North American tour in 1980 with her band The Toys. She signed to Columbia Records in 1981, releasing the album &quot;... And Then He Kissed Me&quot; and its hit single &quot;Everlasting Love&quot;, a duet with Rex Smith. The album also includes &quot;Shadows of the Night,&quot; later a hit for Pat Benatar.

Sweet released only one more album, 1982&#x27;s &quot;Blame It on Love&quot;, which featured the song &quot;Voo Doo&quot;. The video for the song was played on MTV, and she performed the song on the musical TV show &quot;Solid Gold&quot;. An album she recorded tracks for in 1982-83 remains unreleased.

She returned to music sporadically as she focused on her education, co-writing and recording the title song for John Waters&#x27; film &quot;Hairspray&quot;, and several songs for Waters&#x27; musical film &quot;Cry-Baby&quot;.

In 1992, Rhino Records released &quot;Fool Around: The Best of Rachel Sweet&quot;. The CD compilation includes all of her first album, &quot;Fool Around&quot;, as well as tracks from her other three albums and the theme from &quot;Hairspray&quot;.

==Film and television==
In 1982, Sweet had a starring role in the low-budget musical film &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Hotel&quot;, which also featured Judd Nelson and was filmed in Richmond, Virginia, at the then-inoperative Jefferson Hotel. Shooting in Richmond with local extras began in October 1982 and was halted abruptly in December. The film&#x27;s original 3D version, with scenes in the style of early MTV music videos, received only two screenings in 1983, in Los Angeles and New York. It was never released theatrically, even after it was eventually re-cut and completed in 1986 under the supervision of Sweet&#x27;s father, Dick.

Sweet also appeared in the 1989 musical film &quot;Sing&quot;, performing &quot;Life Ain&#x27;t Worth Living (When You&#x27;re Dead)&quot;. While the song does not appear on the soundtrack album, Columbia Records released it as the B-side of the soundtrack single &quot;Romance (Love Theme from &quot;Sing&quot;) by Paul Carrack and Terri Nunn.

In 1989 and 1990, Sweet hosted a show on The Comedy Channel (forerunner of Comedy Central) called &quot;The Sweet Life&quot;, which also featured Jon Stewart. Her recording of the theme song to the Nickelodeon series &quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot; was a reworking of the theme song from &quot;The Sweet Life&quot;; and she provided vocals for songs in the &quot;Barbie&quot; animated series.

Sweet had a minor role as George Costanza&#x27;s cousin in &quot;The Contest&quot;, a 1992 episode of the TV sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. She played a waitress in the 1994 film comedy &quot;All Tied Up&quot;.

Focusing on a writing and producing career in television since the late 1990s, she has been a writer and/or executive producer on series including &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot;, &quot;Commando Nanny&quot;, &quot;George Lopez&quot;, &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;, &quot;2 Broke Girls&quot;, &quot;The Single Guy&quot; and &quot;&quot;The Goldbergs&quot;&quot;.

==Personal life==
Sweet owned Madonna&#x27;s former home Los Pavoreales, selling it in 2010.

Sweet married television writer and producer Tom Palmer in 1997; they have two children.

<text>The mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) is one of the two subspecies of the eastern gorilla. It is listed as endangered by the IUCN .

There are two populations: One is found in the Virunga volcanic mountains of Central/East Africa, within three National Parks: Mgahinga, in southwest Uganda; Volcanoes, in northwest Rwanda; and Virunga, in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
The other population is found in Uganda&#x27;s Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. Some primatologists speculate the Bwindi population is a separate subspecies, though no description has been finalized. The latest population count, released in 2019, revealed there to be approximately 1060 mountain gorillas in the wild

==Evolution, taxonomy, and classification==
Mountain gorillas are descendants of ancestral monkeys and apes found in Africa and Arabia during the start of the Oligocene epoch (34–24 million years ago). The fossil record provides evidence of the hominoid primates (apes) found in East Africa approximately 22–32 million years ago. The fossil record of the area where mountain gorillas live is particularly poor and so its evolutionary history is not clear.

It was about 8.8 to 12 million years ago that the group of primates who were to evolve into gorillas split from their common ancestor with humans and chimps; this is when the genus &quot;Gorilla&quot; emerged. Mountain gorillas have been isolated from eastern lowland gorillas for approximately 10,000 years and these two taxa separated from their western counterparts approximately 1.2 to 3 million years ago. The genus was first referenced as &quot;Troglodytes&quot; in 1847, but renamed to &quot;Gorilla&quot; in 1852. It was not until 1967 that the taxonomist Colin Groves proposed that all gorillas be regarded as one species (&quot;Gorilla gorilla&quot;) with three subspecies &quot;Gorilla gorilla gorilla&quot; (western lowland gorilla), &quot;Gorilla gorilla graueri&quot; (lowland gorillas found west of the Virungas) and &quot;Gorilla gorilla beringei&quot; (mountain gorillas, including &quot;Gorilla beringei&quot;, found in the Virungas and Bwindi). In 2003, after a review, they were divided into two species (&quot;Gorilla gorilla&quot; and &quot;Gorilla beringei&quot;) by The World Conservation Union (IUCN). There is now agreement that there are two species, each with two subspecies.

==Characteristics==

The fur of the mountain gorilla, often thicker and longer than that of other gorilla species, enables them to live in colder temperatures. Gorillas can be identified by nose prints unique to each individual

Males reach a standing height of , a girth of , an arm span of and a weight of . Females are smaller with a weight of .
This subspecies is smaller than the eastern lowland gorilla, the other subspecies of eastern gorilla. Adult males have more pronounced bony crests on the top and back of their skulls, giving their heads a more conical shape. These crests anchor the powerful temporalis muscles, which attach to the lower jaw (mandible). Adult females also have these crests, but they are less pronounced. Like all gorillas, they feature dark brown eyes framed by a black ring around the iris. Adult males are called silverbacks because a saddle of gray or silver-colored hair develops on their backs with age. The hair on their backs is shorter than on most other body parts, and their arm hair is especially long. Fully erect males average in height, with an arm span of and weigh . The tallest silverback recorded was tall with an arm span of , a chest of , and a weight of , shot in Alimbongo, northern Kivu in May 1938. There is an unconfirmed record of another individual, shot in 1932, that was and weighed . The heaviest silverback recorded was a tall specimen shot in Ambam, Cameroon.

The mountain gorilla is primarily terrestrial and quadrupedal. However, it will climb into fruiting trees if the branches can carry its weight. Like all great apes other than humans, its arms are longer than its legs. It moves by knuckle-walking, supporting its weight on the backs of its curved fingers rather than its palms.

The mountain gorilla is diurnal, spending most of the day eating, as large quantities of food are needed to sustain its massive bulk. It forages in the early morning, rests during the late morning and around midday, and in the afternoon it forages again before resting at night. Each gorilla builds a nest from surrounding vegetation to sleep in, constructing a new one every evening. Only infants sleep in the same nest as their mothers. They leave their sleeping sites when the sun rises at around 6 am, except when it is cold and overcast; then they often stay longer in their nests.

==Distribution and habitat==

The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forest, including the Virunga Mountains, ranging in elevation from . Most groups live on the slopes of three of the dormant volcanoes: Karisimbi, Mikeno, and Visoke. The vegetation is very dense at the bottom of the mountains, becoming more sparse at higher elevations, and the forests are often cloudy, misty and cold. The mountain gorilla also occasionally uses the border habitat with the Rwenzori-Virunga montane moorlands, at elevations higher than the Albertine Rift montane cloud forest.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
The home range used by one group of gorillas during one year is influenced by availability of food sources and usually includes several vegetation zones. George Schaller identified ten distinct zones, including: bamboo forest at ; &quot;Hagenia&quot; forest at ; and the giant senecio zone at . The mountain gorilla spends most of its time in &quot;Hagenia&quot; forest, where galium vines are found year-round. All parts of this vine are consumed: leaves, stems, flowers, and berries. It travels to the bamboo forest during the few months of the year when fresh shoots are available, and it climbs into subalpine regions to eat the soft centers of giant senecio trees.

=== Diet ===

The mountain gorilla is primarily a herbivore; the majority of its diet is composed of the leaves, shoots, and stems (85.8%) of 142 plant species. It also feeds on bark (6.9%), roots (3.3%), flowers (2.3%), and fruit (1.7%), as well as small invertebrates. (0.1%). In a year long study in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest adult males ate an average of of food a day, while females ate .

===Social structure===
The mountain gorilla is highly social, and lives in relatively stable, cohesive groups held together by long-term bonds between adult males and females. Relationships among females are relatively weak. These groups are nonterritorial; the silverback generally defends his group rather than his territory. In the Virunga mountain gorillas, the average length of tenure for a dominant silverback is 4.7 years.

61% of groups are composed of one adult male and a number of females and 36% contain more than one adult male. The remaining gorillas are either lone males or exclusively male groups, usually made up of one mature male and a few younger males. Group sizes vary from five to thirty, with an average of ten individuals. A typical group contains: one dominant silverback, who is the group&#x27;s undisputed leader; another subordinate silverback (usually a younger brother, half-brother, or even an adult son of the dominant silverback); one or two blackbacks, who act as sentries; three to four sexually mature females, who have bonded for life to the dominant silverback; and from three to six juveniles and infants.

Most males and approximately 60% of females leave their natal group. Males leave when they are about eleven years old, and often the separation process is slow: they spend more and more time on the edge of the group until they leave altogether. They may travel alone or with an all-male group for two–five years before they can attract females to join them and form a new group. Females typically emigrate when they are about eight years old, either transferring directly to an established group or beginning a new one with a lone male. Females often transfer to a new group several times before they choose to settle down with a certain silverback male.

The dominant silverback generally determines the movements of the group, leading it to appropriate feeding sites throughout the year. He also mediates conflicts within the group and protects it from external threats. When the group is attacked by humans, leopards, or other gorillas, the silverback will protect them, even at the cost of his own life. He is the center of attention during rest sessions, and young gorillas frequently stay close to him and include him in their games. If a mother dies or leaves the group, the silverback is usually the one who looks after her abandoned offspring, even allowing them to sleep in his nest. Young mountain gorillas have been observed searching for and dismantling poachers&#x27; snares.

When the silverback dies or is killed by disease, accident, or poachers, the family group may be disrupted. Unless there is an accepted male descendant capable of taking over his position, the group will either split up or adopt an unrelated male. When a new silverback joins the family group, he may kill all of the infants of the dead silverback. Infanticide has not been observed in stable groups.

Analysis of mountain gorilla genomes by whole genome sequencing indicates that a recent decline in their population size has led to extensive inbreeding. As an apparent result, individuals are typically homozygous for 34% of their genome sequence. Furthermore, homozygosity and the expression of deleterious recessive mutations as consequences of inbreeding have likely resulted in the purging of severely deleterious mutations from the population.

===Aggression===
Although strong and powerful, mountain gorillas are generally gentle and very shy. Severe aggression is rare in stable groups, but when two mountain gorilla groups meet, sometimes the two silverbacks can engage in a fight to the death, using their canines to cause deep, gaping injuries. Conflicts are most often resolved by displays and other threat behaviors that are intended to intimidate without becoming physical.

A ritualized charge display is unique to gorillas. The entire sequence has nine steps: (1) progressively quickening hooting, (2) symbolic feeding, (3) rising bipedally, (4) throwing vegetation, (5) chest-beating with cupped hands, (6) one leg kick, (7) sideways running four-legged, (8) slapping and tearing vegetation, and (9) thumping the ground with palms. Jill Donisthorpe has stated that a male charged at her twice. In both cases, the gorilla turned away when she stood her ground.

===Affiliation===
The midday rest period is an important time for establishing and reinforcing relationships within the group. Mutual grooming reinforces social bonds, and helps keep hair free from dirt and parasites. It is not so common among gorillas as in other primates, although females groom their offspring regularly.

Young gorillas play often and are more arboreal than the large adults. Playing helps them learn how to communicate and behave within the group. Activities include wrestling, chasing, and somersaults. The silverback and his females tolerate and, if encouraged, even participate.

===Vocalization===
Twenty-five distinct vocalizations are recognized, many of which are used primarily for group communication within dense vegetation. Sounds classified as grunts and barks are heard most frequently while traveling, and indicate the whereabouts of individual group members. They also may be used during social interactions when discipline is required. Screams and roars signal alarm or warning, and are produced most often by silverbacks. Deep, rumbling belches suggest contentment and are heard frequently during feeding and resting periods. They are the most common form of intragroup communication.

===Aversions===
Mountain gorillas generally demonstrate aversion to certain reptiles and insects. Infants, whose typical behavior is to chase anything that moves, will go out of their way to avoid chameleons and caterpillars. The gorillas also demonstrate an aversion to water bodies in the environment and will cross streams only if they can do so without getting wet, such as by using fallen logs to cross the stream. They also dislike rain.

==Research==
In October 1902, Captain Robert von Beringe (1865–1940) shot two large apes during an expedition to establish the boundaries of German East Africa. One of the apes was recovered and sent to the Berlin Zoological Museum, where Professor Paul Matschie (1861–1926) classified the animal as a new form of gorilla and named it &quot;Gorilla beringei&quot; after the man who shot it. In 1925, Carl Akeley, a hunter from the American Museum of Natural History who wished to study the gorillas, convinced Albert I of Belgium to establish the Albert National Park to protect the animals of the Virunga mountains.

George Schaller began his 20-month observation of the mountain gorillas in 1959, subsequently publishing two books: &quot;The Mountain Gorilla&quot; and &quot;The Year of the Gorilla&quot;. Little was known about the life of the mountain gorilla before his research, which described its social organization, life history, and ecology.

Dian Fossey began what would become an 18-year study in 1967. Fossey made new observations, completed the first accurate census, and established active conservation practices, such as anti-poaching patrols. The Digit Fund, which Fossey started, continued her work and was later renamed the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International. The Fund&#x27;s Karisoke Research Center monitors and protects the mountain gorillas of the Virungas. Close monitoring and research of the Bwindi mountain gorillas began in the 1990s.

==Conservation==
As of 2018, the mountain gorilla was listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List. Conservation efforts have led to an increase in the overall population of the mountain gorilla (&quot;Gorilla beringei beringei&quot;) in the Virungas and at Bwindi. The overall population is now believed to be at more than 1,000 individuals.

In December 2010, the official website of Virunga National Park announced that &quot;the number of mountain gorillas living in the tri-national forested area of which Virunga forms a part, has increased by 26.3% during the last seven years - an average growth rate of 3.7% per annum.&quot; The 2010 census estimated that 480 mountain gorillas inhabited the region. The 2003 census had estimated the Virunga gorilla population to be 380 individuals, which represented a 17% increase in the total population since 1989, when there were 320 individuals. The population has almost doubled since its lowest point in 1981, when a census estimated that only 254 gorillas remained.

The 2006 census at Bwindi indicated a population of 340 gorillas, representing a 6% increase in total population size since 2002 and a 12% increase from 320 individuals in 1997. All of those estimates were based on traditional census methods using dung samples collected at night nests. Conversely, genetic analyses of the entire population during the 2006 census indicated there only were approximately 300 individuals in Bwindi. The discrepancy highlights the difficulty in using imprecise census data to estimate population growth.

According to computer modeling of their population dynamics in both Bwindi and the Virungas, groups of gorillas who were habituated for research and ecotourism have higher growth rates than unhabituated gorillas. Habituation means that through repeated, neutral contact with humans, gorillas exhibit normal behavior when people are in proximity. Habituated gorillas are more closely guarded by field staff and they receive veterinary treatment for snares, respiratory disease, and other life-threatening conditions. Nonetheless, researchers recommended that some gorillas remain unhabituated as a bet-hedging strategy against the risk of human pathogens being transmitted throughout the population.
The main international non-governmental organization involved in conservation of mountain gorillas is the International Gorilla Conservation Programme, which was established in 1991 as a joint effort of the African Wildlife Foundation, Fauna &amp; Flora International, and the World Wide Fund for Nature. Conservation requires work at many levels, from local to international, and involves protection and law enforcement as well as research and education.

Dian Fossey broke down conservation efforts into the following three categories:
* Active conservation includes frequent patrols in wildlife areas to destroy poacher equipment and weapons, firm and prompt law enforcement, census counts in regions of breeding and ranging concentration, and strong safeguards for the limited habitat the animals occupy.
* Theoretical conservation seeks to encourage growth in tourism by improving existing roads that circle the mountains, by renovating the park headquarters and tourist lodging, and by the habituation of gorillas near the park boundaries for tourists to visit and photograph.
* Community-based conservation management involves biodiversity protection by, for, and with the local community.

A collaborative management process has had some success in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. The forest was designated a national park in 1991; this occurred with little community consultation and the new status prohibited local people from accessing resources within the park as well as reducing economic opportunities. Subsequently, a number of forest fires were deliberately lit and threats were made to the gorillas. To counteract this, three schemes to provide benefits from the existence of forest communities and involving the local community in park management were developed. They included agreements allowing the controlled harvesting of resources in the park, receipt of some revenue from tourism, and establishment of a trust fund partly for community development. Tension between people and the park has thus been reduced and now there is more willingness to take part in gorilla protection. Surveys of community attitudes conducted by CARE show a steadily increasing proportion of people in favour of the park. Moreover, there have been no cases of deliberate burning and the problem of snares in these areas has been reduced.

While community-based conservation bears out individual analysis, there are significant overlaps between active and theoretical conservation and a discussion of the two as halves of a whole seems more constructive. For example, in 2002, Rwanda&#x27;s national parks went through a restructuring process. The director of the IGCP, Eugène Rutagarama, stated that &quot;They got more rangers on better salaries, more radios, more patrol cars and better training in wildlife conservation. They also built more shelters in the park, from which rangers could protect the gorillas&quot;. The funding for these types of improvements usually comes from tourism - in 2008, approximately 20,000 tourists visited gorilla populations in Rwanda, generating around $8 million in revenue for the parks.

According to the Director of UNESCO, Audrey Azoulay, &quot;As we have seen in Rwanda, species conservation succeeds when local communities are placed at the heart of the conservation strategy. Biodiversity protection measures must go hand in hand with measures that meet the needs of these local communities&quot;. In Rwanda, it costs $1,500 per person to come and see the gorillas. Under Rwandan law, 10% of this revenue must be returned to the community, which represents around €10 million invested in building schools, roads and drinking water supplies. As Audrey Azoulay explains, in 1980 there were just 250 mountain gorillas, today there are 1,063 - and 80% of them in Rwanda.

In Uganda too, tourism is seen as a &quot;high value activity that generates enough revenue to cover park management costs and contribute to the national budget of the Uganda Wildlife Authority.&quot; Furthermore, tourist visits which are conducted by park rangers also allow censuses of gorilla sub-populations to be undertaken concurrently.

In addition to tourism, other measures for conservation of the sub-population can be taken such as ensuring connecting corridors between isolated areas to make movement between them easier and safer.

== Threats ==
The mountain gorilla is threatened by habitat loss and poaching.

===Habitat loss===
Loss of habitat is one of the most severe threats to gorilla populations. The forests where mountain gorillas live are surrounded by rapidly increasing human settlement. Through shifting (slash-and-burn) agriculture, pastoral expansion, and logging, villages in forest zones cause fragmentation and degradation of habitat. The late 1960s saw the Virunga Conservation Area (VCA) of Rwanda&#x27;s national park reduced by more than half of its original size to support the cultivation of Pyrethrum. This led to a massive reduction in mountain gorilla population numbers by the mid-1970s. The resulting deforestation confines the gorillas to isolated deserts. Some groups may raid crops for food, creating further animosity and retaliation.
The impact of habitat loss extends beyond the reduction of suitable living space for gorillas. As gorilla groups are increasingly isolated from one another geographically due to human settlements, the genetic diversity of each group is reduced. Some signs of inbreeding are already appearing in younger gorillas, including webbed hands and feet.

===Poaching===
Mountain gorillas are not usually hunted for bushmeat, but frequently, they are maimed or killed by traps and snares intended for other animals. They have been killed for their heads, hands, and feet, which are sold to collectors. Infants are sold to zoos, researchers, and people who want them as pets. The abduction of infants generally involves the loss of at least one adult, as members of a group will fight to the death to protect their young. The Virunga gorillas are particularly susceptible to animal trafficking for the illegal pet trade. With young gorillas worth from $1,000 to $5,000 on the black market, poachers seeking infant and juvenile specimens will kill and wound other members of the group in the process. Those of the group that survive often disband. One well-documented case is known as the &quot;Taiping 4&quot;. In this situation, a Malaysian Zoo received four wild-born infant gorillas from Nigeria at a cost of US$1.6 million using falsified export documents.
Poaching for meat also is particularly threatening in regions of political unrest. Most of the African great apes survive in areas of chronic insecurity, where there is a breakdown of law and order. The killing of mountain gorillas at Bikenge in Virunga National Park in January 2007 was a well-documented case.

===Disease===
Despite the protection garnered from being located in national parks, the mountain gorilla is also at risk from people of a more well-meaning nature. Groups subjected to regular visits from tourists and locals are at a continued risk of disease cross-transmission (Lilly et al., 2002) – this is in spite of attempts to enforce a rule that humans and gorillas be separated by a distance of seven metres at all times to prevent this.

With a similar genetic makeup to humans and an immune system that has not evolved to cope with human disease, this poses a serious conservation threat. Indeed, according to some researchers, infectious diseases (predominantly respiratory) are responsible for approximately 20% of sudden deaths in mountain gorilla populations.

With the implementation of a successful ecotourism program in which human-gorilla interaction was minimised, during the period of 1989–2000 four sub-populations in Rwanda experienced an increase of 76%. By contrast, seven of the commonly visited sub-populations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) saw a decline of almost 20% over only four years (1996–2000).

The risk of disease transmission is not limited to those of a human origin; pathogens from domestic animals and livestock through contaminated water are also a concern. Studies have found that waterborne, gastrointestinal parasites such as &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; sp., &quot;Microsporidia&quot; sp., and &quot;Giardia&quot; sp. are genetically identical when found in livestock, humans, and gorillas, particularly along the border of the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, Uganda.

===War and civil unrest===
Rwanda, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo have been politically unstable and beleaguered by war and civil unrest during the last decades. Using simulation modeling, Byers et al. (2003) have suggested that times of war and unrest have negative impacts on the habitat and populations of mountain gorillas. Due to the increase in human encounters, both aggressive and passive, this has resulted in a rise in mortality rates and a decrease in reproductive success.

More direct impacts from conflict can also be seen. Kanyamibwa notes that there were reports that mines were placed along trails in the Volcanoes National Park, and that many gorillas were killed as a result. Pressure from habitat destruction in the form of logging also increased as refugees fled the cities and cut down trees for wood. During the Rwandan genocide, some poaching activity also was linked to the general breakdown of law and order and lack of any ramifications.

<text>Saint Louis of Toulouse (9 February 1274 – 19 August 1297), also known as Louis of Anjou, was a Neapolitan prince of the Capetian House of Anjou and a Catholic bishop.

==Life==
Louis was born in Brignoles, Provence (or in Italy, at Nocera, where he spent a part of his early life), the second son of King Charles II of Naples and Mary of Hungary. His father, Charles, became king of Naples in 1285 and was taken prisoner in Italy, during the war with King Peter III of Aragon that followed the Sicilian Vespers. Charles obtained his own freedom by giving over his three sons as hostages. Louis and his brothers were taken to Catalonia, where they were placed under the care of Franciscan friars for their education and held for seven years. Impressed by one of the friars in particular, Arnauld de Villeneuve, Louis took up the study of philosophy and theology. Though still held in captivity, Louis was made archbishop of Lyon as soon as he reached his majority. When his older brother died of plague in 1295, Louis also became heir apparent to his father&#x27;s kingdom; however, when he was freed that same year, Louis went to Rome and gave up all claims to the Angevin inheritance in favor of his brother Robert and announced that instead he would take the Franciscan vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.

On 5 February 1297, Louis was consecrated Bishop of Toulouse by Boniface VIII, where his granduncle Alphonse had until recently been count, but had died in 1271 leaving no heir. Here Louis stood in an ambivalent dynastic and ecclesiastical position, in a territory between Provence and Aquitaine that was essential to Angevin interests. Despite the princely standing that had won him this important appointment at the age of about 22, Louis rapidly gained a reputation for serving the poor, feeding the hungry, and ignoring his own needs. After just six months, however, apparently exhausted by his labors, he abandoned the position of bishop. Shortly thereafter he died at Brignoles of a fever, possibly typhoid, at age 23.

Two music theory treatises, &quot;De musicae commendacione&quot; and &quot;Sentencia in musica sonora subiecti&quot;, are sometimes attributed to him, but are now thought to be the work of Lodewijk Heyligen (1304–1361).

==Veneration==
Procedures for the canonization of Louis were quickly urged. His case was promoted by Pope Clement V in 1307, and he was canonized by John XXII on 7 April 1317 with the bull &quot;Sol oriens&quot;. His brother Robert at Naples who owed his crown to Louis commissioned a great altarpiece from Simone Martini, depicting Louis being crowned by angels as he simultaneously crowned Robert.

The cult of Saint Louis of Toulouse took hold in Hungary. His nephew Charles I of Hungary (1307–1342) exalted his image and veneration, consecrating churches and a monastery in the settlement of Lippa in his honor, and giving the name of the saint to his eldest son, Louis I of Hungary (1342–1382). Louis of Toulouse was not otherwise widely venerated in the rest of Europe, but the Franciscans embraced him, keeping his day in their calendar and removing his relics in 1423 to Valencia, where he was made its patron saint.

Louis can be recognized in iconography as a young bishop, usually wearing a brown or grey Franciscan habit under his cope. The cope is usually decorated with the French fleur-de-lys. Sometimes there is a discarded crown by his feet.

A polyphonic motet, &quot;Flos&quot;/&quot;Celsa&quot;/&quot;Quam magnus pontifex&quot;, was written in honor of Louis&#x27;s canonization in 1317. The piece appears anonymously in the Ivrea Codex and has been attributed by modern scholars to Philippe de Vitry.

Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa, a Franciscan mission in California founded in 1772, is named for him as are the surrounding city and county of San Luis Obispo, California. Kolleg St Ludwig in Vlodrop, the Netherlands, was dedicated to him. A Vlodrop hotel is also named for Saint Ludwig.

<text>In computing, native software or data-formats are those that were designed to run on a particular operating system. In a more technical sense, native code is code written specifically for a certain processor. In contrast, cross-platform software can be run on multiple operating systems and/or computer architectures.

For example, a Game Boy receives its software through a cartridge, which contains code that runs natively on the Game Boy. The only way to run this code on another processor is to use an emulator, which simulates an actual Game Boy. This usually comes at the cost of speed.

== Applications ==
Something running on a computer natively means that it is running without any external layer requiring fewer software layers. For example, in Microsoft Windows the Native API is an application programming interface specific for the Windows NT kernel, which can be used to give access to some kernel functions, which cannot be directly accessed through a more universal Windows API.

== Operating systems ==
Used to denote either the absence of virtualization or virtualization at its lowest level. When various levels of virtualization take place, the lowest level operating system—the one that actually maintains direct control of the hardware—is referred to as a &quot;Native VM,&quot; for example.

== Machine code ==

Machine code, also known as native code, is a program which is written in machine language. Machine code is usually considered the lowest level of code for a computer, that, in its lowest level form, is written in binary (0s and 1s), but is often written in hexadecimal or octal to make it a little easier to handle. These instruction sets are then interpreted by the computer. With this, there is no need for translation. machine code is strictly numerical and usually isn&#x27;t what programmers program in, due to this complex nature. Machine code is also as close as you can get to the processor, so using this language, you are programming specifically for that processor as machine code for each processor may differ. Typically programmers will code in high-level languages such as C, C++, Pascal, (or other directly compiled languages) which gets translated into assembly code, which then translates it into machine code (or in most cases the compiler generates machine code directly). Since each CPU is different, programs need to be recompiled or rewritten in order to work on that CPU.

== Data ==

Applied to data, native data formats or communication protocols are those supported by a certain computer hardware or software, with maximal consistency and minimal amount of additional components.

For example, EGA and VGA video adapters &quot;natively&quot; support code page 437. This does not preclude supporting other code pages, but it requires either a font uploading or using graphic modes.

== Cloud computing ==
In cloud computing, &quot;cloud native&quot; refers to the software approach of building, deploying, and managing modern applications in cloud computing environments, for software optimised for running on a cloud-based platform. A cloud native application typically consists of individual modular microservices.

<doc id="581642" wikidata="Q1672313" url="?curid=581642" title="Ikalto Monastery">
<text>Iqalto () is a village about 10 km west of the town Telavi in the Kakheti region of Eastern Georgia. It is mostly known for its monastery complex and the Ikalto Academy.

The Ikalto monastery was founded by Saint Zenon, one of the 13 Assyrian Fathers, in the late 6th century. It was known as one of the most significant cultural-scholastic centres of Georgia. An academy was founded at the monastery during king David the Builder by Arsen Ikaltoeli (&quot;Ikaltoeli&quot; meaning &quot;from Ikalto&quot;), and advisor to David IV, in 1106. The Academy of Ikalto trained its students in theology, rhetoric, astronomy, philosophy, geography, geometry, arithmetic, music, grammar, chanting but also more practical skills such as pottery making, metal work, viticulture and wine making and pharmacology. According to a legend the famous 12th century Georgian poet Shota Rustaveli studied there.

There are three churches on the monastery grounds – Khvtaeba, Kvelatsminda and Sameba. The main church, Khvtaeba (&quot;Holy Spirit&quot;), was built in the 8th–9th century on the site of an older church (in which Saint Zenon had been buried). In 1616 the Persian invaders led by Shah Abbas I set the Ikalto Academy on fire and it ceased to exist.

<text>Fundidora Park (&quot;Parque Fundidora&quot; in Spanish) is an urban park located in the Mexican city of Monterrey, built in what once were the grounds of the Monterrey Foundry, the first steel and iron foundry in Latin America, and, for many years, the most important one in the region.

==History and location==
The Parque Fundidora is located inside the grounds formerly occupied by &quot;Fundidora Monterrey&quot;, a steel foundry company of great importance to the economic development of the city during the 20th century. After its bankruptcy in 1986, Federal and State government showed interest in using the land to create a public park with the aim to preserve its history as well as being a center of culture, business, entertainment and ecological awareness for the people of the city. In 1988 the land was expropriated and the &quot;Fideicomiso Fundidora&quot; &quot;(Fundidora Trust)&quot; was created to manage it in an arrangement between the State government and private investment. Construction began in 1989, starting with the preservation of historically important buildings and structures within the foundry and the dismantling of the others, followed by the construction of the CINTERMEX convention center, Plaza Sesamo amusement park, a hotel and a cinematheque. Construction and rehabilitation continued during the rest of the 1990s.

The park opened on February 24, 2001, with an area of , receiving the additional name of &quot;Museum of Industrial Archaeology Site&quot;. In 2010 the &quot;Paseo Santa Lucía&quot; development, consisting of a artificial river and accompanying river-walk, is incorporated to the park bringing it into its current state, with a total area of , of which are green space, 2 lakes, 23 fountains, 16 buildings, 27 large scale industrial structures and 127 pieces of steel-making machinery and tools of historical importance to the state of Nuevo Leon. There&#x27;s also a long track surrounding the original section of the park.

==Buildings==

===Monterrey Arena===

Arena Monterrey is an indoor arena in Monterrey, Mexico. It is primarily used for concerts, shows and indoor sports like indoor soccer or basketball. It used to be the home arena of the Monterrey Fury indoor soccer team and the Fuerza Regia, a professional basketball team in the Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional and the Monterrey La Raza, a team in the NISL.

The Arena Monterrey is owned by Publimax S.A. de C.V. (TV Azteca Northeast), part of the Avalanz Group, who owns 80% and by TV Azteca who owns 20%. The arena is 480,000 square feet (45,000 m) in size.

===Cintermex===

===Parque Fiesta Aventuras===

Parque Fiesta Aventuras (formerly Parque Plaza Sésamo) is a theme park located in the complex that originally opened in 1995. The park was operated under a license from Sesame Workshop, the owners of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;Plaza Sésamo&quot;.

On May 18, 2022, the park announced that it would rebrand as Parque Fiesta Aventuras for the 2022 season following a two-year period of closure. The reason for the rebranding was not classified by the park, but is likely that the owners had terminated the license to use the Plaza Sésamo branding and characters.

===Auditorio Banamex===

Auditorio Citibanamex (formerly named Auditorio Coca-Cola, Auditorio Fundidora and Auditorio Banamex) is an indoor amphitheatre with a capacity of 8,200.&lt;br&gt;
The amphitheatre opened in 1994 with a sponsorship by The Coca-Cola Company, and it was the primary venue for concerts until the Arena Monterrey opened in 2003.

<text>Jacob do Bandolim (born Jacob Pick Bittencourt; February 14, 1918 – August 13, 1969) was a Brazilian composer and musician. Born to a Brazilian-Jewish mother and a gentile father in Rio de Janeiro, his stage name means &quot;Mandolin Jacob&quot;, after the instrument he played.

A perfectionist, Jacob was able to achieve from his band &quot;Época de Ouro&quot; the highest levels of quality. Jacob hated the stereotype of the &quot;dishevelled, drunk folk musician&quot; and required commitment and impeccable dress from his musicians who, like himself, all held &quot;day jobs.&quot; Jacob worked as a pharmacist, insurance salesman, street vendor, and finally notary public, to support himself while also working &quot;full time&quot; as a musician.

In addition to his virtuoso playing, he is famous for his many &quot;choro&quot; compositions, more than 103 tunes, which range from the lyrical melodies of &quot;Noites Cariocas&quot; (&quot;Carioca Nights&quot;), &quot;Receita de Samba&quot; and &quot;&quot;Dôce de Coco&quot; to the aggressively jazzy &quot;Assanhado&quot;&quot;, which is reminiscent of bebop. He also researched and attempted to preserve the older choro tradition, as well as that of other Brazilian music styles.

== Death and legacy ==
Bandolim died of a heart attack, when coming back from spending the day with Pixinguinha, planning a recording project to benefit his friend. 
His son Sérgio Bittencourt (1941 - 1979) composed the hit song &quot;Naquela Mesa&quot; as a tribute to his father.

Jacob had 2 mandolins, which he called &quot;number one&quot; and &quot;number two&quot;. After his death, they were kept in storage until 2002, when they received minor restoration. Now under the care of Instituto Jacob do Bandolim, they have been used in a few recordings again.

<text>Andrew Maurice Gold (August 2, 1951 – June 3, 2011) was an American multi-instrumentalist, singer, songwriter, and record producer who influenced much of the Los Angeles-dominated pop/soft rock sound in the 1970s. Gold performed on scores of records by other artists, especially Linda Ronstadt, and had his own success with the U.S. top 40 hits &quot;Lonely Boy&quot; (1977) and &quot;Thank You for Being a Friend&quot; (1978), as well as the UK top five hit &quot;Never Let Her Slip Away&quot; (1978). In the 1980s, he had further international chart success as one half of Wax, a collaboration with 10cc&#x27;s Graham Gouldman.

During the 1990s, Gold produced, composed, performed on and wrote tracks for films, commercials, and television soundtracks, such as &quot;Final Frontier&quot;, the theme of the sitcom &quot;Mad About You&quot;. Some of his older works experienced newfound popularity: &quot;Thank You for Being a Friend&quot; sung by another performer was used as the opening theme for &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, and the children&#x27;s novelty song &quot;Spooky, Scary Skeletons&quot; (1996) became an Internet meme in the 2010s. In 1997, Gold released a tribute to 1960s psychedelic music, &quot;Greetings from Planet Love&quot;, issued under the pseudonym &quot;the Fraternal Order of the All&quot;. He died in 2011 aged 59 from heart failure.

==Early life==
Gold was born on August 2, 1951, in Burbank, California, and eventually followed his parents into show business. His mother was singer Marni Nixon, who provided the singing voice for numerous actresses, notably Natalie Wood in &quot;West Side Story&quot;, Deborah Kerr in &quot;The King and I&quot;, and Audrey Hepburn in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;; his father was Ernest Gold, an Austrian-born composer who won an Academy Award for his score for the movie &quot;Exodus&quot;. He had two younger sisters.

Gold began writing songs at the age of 13. While in school in the United Kingdom for one year, the 16-year-old Gold scored his first recording contract on the strength of a selection of demos he submitted to Polydor Records&#x27; London office. That contract resulted in the single &quot;Of All the Little Girls&quot;, which was recorded with his friend and collaborator Charlie Villiers, and released in 1967 under the name Villiers and Gold.

==Career==
===1970s===
By the early 1970s, Gold was working full-time as a musician, songwriter and record producer. He was a member of the Los Angeles band Bryndle, alongside Kenny Edwards, Wendy Waldman, and Karla Bonoff, releasing the single &quot;Woke Up This Morning&quot; in 1970. He played a major role as multi-instrumentalist and arranger for Linda Ronstadt&#x27;s breakthrough album, 1974&#x27;s &quot;Heart Like a Wheel&quot;, and her next two albums. After Ronstadt&#x27;s &quot;Hasten Down the Wind&quot;, Gold began a career as a solo artist. Among other accomplishments, he played the majority of instruments on &quot;You&#x27;re No Good&quot;, Ronstadt&#x27;s only No. 1 single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and on &quot;When Will I Be Loved&quot;, &quot;(Love Is Like a) Heat Wave&quot;, and many other hits. He was in her band from 1973 until 1977, and then sporadically throughout the 1980s and 1990s, performing at some of her concerts.

In 1975, Gold debuted as a solo artist, with the album &quot;Andrew Gold&quot;, and played most of the instruments on Art Garfunkel&#x27;s solo hit &quot;I Only Have Eyes For You&quot; (which was a major hit in the United Kingdom, where it topped the UK Singles Chart), as well as several other cuts on Garfunkel&#x27;s album &quot;Breakaway&quot;.

Gold&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;What&#x27;s Wrong with This Picture?,&quot; was released in 1976 and featured the hit single &quot;Lonely Boy&quot;, which reached No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in June 1977.

In 1977, Gold also played guitar on two cuts of Eric Carmen&#x27;s album &quot;Boats Against the Current&quot;, including &quot;She Did It&quot;, a No. 23 hit that year.

Although &quot;Lonely Boy&quot; was the bigger radio hit in the States, the single &quot;Thank You for Being a Friend&quot; from Gold&#x27;s third album, &quot;All This and Heaven Too&quot;, peaked at No. 25 in 1978, later gaining popularity as the theme song for &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, performed by Cindy Fee.

Gold&#x27;s biggest hit in the United Kingdom was &quot;Never Let Her Slip Away&quot;, which peaked at number five on the UK Singles Chart on two occasions, firstly by Gold himself in 1978 and again by dance-pop group Undercover in 1992. Freddie Mercury, a friend of Gold&#x27;s, was an uncredited background singer.

Gold also toured with the Eagles, worked in the studio and toured with Ronstadt and Jackson Browne, recorded and toured with James Taylor, and was second engineer on part of Joni Mitchell&#x27;s album &quot;Blue&quot;.

===1980s===

Gold played on Cher&#x27;s hit 1989 album &quot;Heart of Stone&quot; and, during the early &#x27;90s, wrote and composed hits for Trisha Yearwood as well as Wynonna Judd, for whom he co-wrote the No. 1 single &quot;I Saw The Light&quot; with Lisa Angelle. (Later, Gold would produce Angelle on her own album, which featured a number of songs on whose authorship and composition they collaborated.) He also produced singles for Vince Gill, wrote and produced tracks for Celine Dion, and arranged a cover of the Everly Brothers hit &quot;All I Have to Do Is Dream&quot; that was sung by stars Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen in the 1984 science-fiction film &quot;Starman.&quot;

====Wax====

In 1981, Gold produced, co-wrote, sang and played on three 10cc tracks that appeared on the hit-making pop-rock band&#x27;s 1981 album &quot;Ten Out of 10&quot;. Subsequently, Eric Stewart and Graham Gouldman of 10cc invited Gold to become a member of the group. Although he had worked with them in the studio, business conflicts prevented him from joining their ranks.

In late 1983, 10cc broke up, and in the aftermath, Gold and Gouldman formed Wax. Wax recorded and toured for five years. They enjoyed international success, particularly in the UK, where the duo had several hits including &quot;Right Between the Eyes&quot; and their biggest hit, &quot;Bridge to Your Heart&quot;. Wax broke up as a recording and touring entity in 1989, but Gold and Gouldman continued to write and record together whenever possible.

===1990s===
In the 1990s, Gold once again joined forces with ex-bandmates Karla Bonoff, Wendy Waldman and Kenny Edwards to re-form Bryndle and release their first full-length album, &quot;Bryndle.&quot;

In 1996, Gold left Bryndle and released the children&#x27;s Halloween-oriented novelty album &quot;Halloween Howls&quot;. It features covers of &quot;Monster Mash&quot; and the themes from &quot;The Addams Family&quot; and &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, plus nine original songs, including &quot;Spooky, Scary Skeletons&quot;, which regained popularity from the 2010s onwards as an Internet meme. The same year, he released the solo album &quot;...Since 1951,&quot; and produced Stephen Bishop&#x27;s &quot;Blue Guitar&quot; album. Thereafter, he recorded the psychedelic &#x27;60s tribute album &quot;Greetings from Planet Love&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;The Fraternal Order of the All,&quot; releasing it on his own record label, &quot;QBrain Records.&quot; This album was a multi-tracked solo affair with Gold essentially playing all of the instruments and singing all of the vocals on original songs in the style of Gold&#x27;s favorite 1960s bands such as The Beatles, The Byrds and The Beach Boys.

He produced, composed, and/or wrote tracks for numerous films, such as the comedy &quot;Rectuma&quot; from director Mark Pirro, and contributed songs to many television soundtracks and commercials. Among his more high-profile gigs, he sang &quot;Final Frontier,&quot; the theme song for the television sitcom &quot;Mad About You&quot;. In a remarkable turn of events, his rendition of the song was used as the wake-up call for the Mars Pathfinder space probe in 1996.

Gold also produced seven albums for Japanese singer-songwriter Eikichi Yazawa.

===2000s===
In 2000, Gold compiled a Wax rarities album, &quot;Bikini Wax&quot;, as well as recording and releasing a new solo album &quot;The Spence Manor Suite;&quot; this last was followed in 2002 by another solo collection, &quot;Intermission&quot;. In the early 2000s, he formed a Byrds tribute band, Byrds of a Feather, which performed in the Los Angeles area.

He appeared in a 2006 concert with the classic rock group America and singer-songwriter Stephen Bishop. The performance was later released as a DVD titled &quot;America And Friends – Live at the Ventura Theater&quot;. The show featured Gold performing &quot;Thank You for Being a Friend,&quot; &quot;Final Frontier,&quot; &quot;Bridge to Your Heart,&quot; and &quot;Lonely Boy,&quot; as well as accompanying America and Bishop on guitar and vocals. Gold had produced America&#x27;s &quot;Holiday Harmony&quot; Christmas album in 2002, in which he also played most of the instruments and co-wrote the track &quot;Christmas in California.&quot;

==Legacy==
In the early 2010s, Gold&#x27;s song &quot;Spooky Scary Skeletons&quot; became the subject of Halloween-related Internet memes through its popularity on 4chan&#x27;s video games board. Within a few years, the song turned into a viral phenomenon, with numerous highly viewed remixes and dance tutorials for it being posted on YouTube; it was described by &quot;New York&quot; magazine in 2019 as the &quot;Internet&#x27;s Halloween anthem&quot;. The YouTuber Dave Wave released a very popular remix of the song that was later published on Spotify by the Craft Recordings. The song also became highly popular on the social media site TikTok, with videos including it receiving several hundred million views. By 2019, the popularity of &quot;Spooky Scary Skeletons&quot; had inspired a deluxe digital release of &quot;Halloween Howls&quot;. This version of the album included the addition of two extended electronic dance remixes of &quot;Spooky Scary Skeletons.&quot;

&quot;Spooky, Scary Skeletons&quot; was adapted into a children&#x27;s picture book by Random House Children&#x27;s Books, featuring the lyrics to the song on August 27, 2024.

In 2020, an early version of Gold&#x27;s song &quot;Savannah&quot; was issued as a digital single. It was followed by &quot;Something New: Unreleased Gold&quot; – a posthumous compilation album of previously unavailable tracks, including some demos – in vinyl, CD and digital formats, along with two digital singles from the album: the title song and &quot;Come Down to Me.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Gold&#x27;s first marriage was to Vanessa Gold, with whom he had three daughters, Emily, Victoria, and Olivia.

In the early 1980s, Gold was engaged to singer Nicolette Larson, but the engagement ended shortly after the completion of Larson&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;All Dressed Up and No Place to Go&quot;, which Gold produced.

He later married Leslie Kogan, who continues to manage his musical legacy.

Although Gold put personal references in the lyrics to &quot;Lonely Boy&quot; (including his year of birth), he said in an interview with author Spencer Leigh that the song was not autobiographical. &quot;Maybe it was a mistake to do that,&quot; he said, &quot;but I simply put in those details because it was convenient. I hadn&#x27;t been a lonely boy at all – I&#x27;d had a very happy childhood.&quot;

Gold was diagnosed with kidney cancer and responded well to treatment. However, on June 3, 2011, he died in Los Angeles from heart failure while asleep, aged 59.

<text>Hednesford Town Football Club is a football club based in Hednesford, Staffordshire, England. They are currently members of the and play at Keys Park. They won the FA Trophy in 2004.

==History==
The club was established in 1880 as a merger of the Red &amp; Whites and Hill Top. Based at the Anglesey Hotel, they were sometimes known as Hednesford Anglesey. The club were founder members of the Birmingham &amp; District League in 1889 and finished sixth in their first season. Despite finishing third in 1890–91, they left the league at the end of the season, and played only friendly matches before joining the Walsall &amp; District Junior League in 1894. The club were runners-up in the league in their first two seasons, before the league was renamed the Walsall &amp; District League in 1897.

Hednesford were league runners-up again in 1899–1900 and 1901–02. After finishing third in 1907–08, they joined the Birmingham Combination, which they won in 1909–10. After World War II the club rejoined the Birmingham &amp; District League. They reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time in 1919–20, losing 2–0 at Castleford Town. The club finished bottom of the league in 1924–25, 1925–26 and 1931–32. They withdrew from the league during the 1937–38 season and folded before reforming as Hednesford. The new club rejoined the Birmingham &amp; District League for the 1938–39 season; however, with the league reduced to 10 clubs, two round robin leagues were played – the King&#x27;s Cup, in which the club finished bottom of the table, and the League Cup, in which they finished second-from-bottom.

After World War II Hednesford joined the Birmingham Combination. They won the league in 1950–51 and were runners-up in 1952–53, after which they rejoined the Birmingham &amp; District League. The league was split into two divisions for the 1954–55 season, with Hednesford playing in the Northern Division. A thirteenth-place finish saw them placed in Division Two the following season. They remained in Division Two until the league was reduced to a single division in 1960. In 1962 the league was renamed the West Midlands (Regional) League. Hednesford became members of the Premier Division when the league gained a second division in 1965. The club returned to its original name in 1971, and in 1972 they joined the Midland League. However, after finishing bottom of the table in 1973–77, the club left the league, returning to the Premier Division of the West Midlands (Regional) League. They were league champions in 1977–78, and after finishing as runners-up in 1983–84, the club moved up to the Midland Division of the Southern League.

In 1991–92 Hednesford were Midland Division runners-up, earning promotion to the Premier Division; they also reached the final of the Welsh Cup, losing 1–0 to Cardiff City. They won the Premier Division in 1994–95 and were promoted to the Football Conference. In their first season in the Conference the club finished third. The 1996–97 season saw the club reach the first round of the FA Cup for the first time since 1919–20. After beating Southport 2–1 in the first round, they defeated Second Division clubs Blackpool in the second round and York City in the third round, winning both games 1–0. In the fourth round they were drawn at home to Premier League Middlesbrough. However, the match was played at Boro&#x27;s Riverside Stadium. In what was a close game Hednesford lost the tie 3–2.

The following season saw Hednesford entered directly into the first round of the FA Cup, where they defeated Hull City 2–0, before losing 1–0 to Darlington in the second round. The club reached the second round again in 1998–99, beating Barnet 1–0 in the first round before losing 3–1 at Cardiff City. A gradual decline in league performances saw them finish bottom of the table in 2000–01, resulting in relegation back to the Southern League&#x27;s Premier Division. In 2003–04 the club reached the final of the FA Trophy, winning the competition with a 3–2 win over Canvey Island at Villa Park. In 2004–05 they finished fourth in the Premier Division, qualifying for the promotion play-offs; after beating Merthyr Tydfil 5–3 on penalties in the semi-finals after a 1–1 draw, they beat Chippenham Town 1–0 in the final to earn promotion to the Conference North.

Hednesford finished bottom of the Conference North in 2005–06, resulting in an immediate relegation, this time to the Premier Division of the Northern Premier League. In 2009 they were transferred to the Southern League&#x27;s Premier Division, and a fourth-place finish in 2009–10 saw them qualify for the play-offs again, this time losing 2–0 to Chippenham in the semi-finals. They were Premier Division runners-up the following season; another play-off campaign saw them beat Leamington 3–1 in the semi-finals before losing 3–2 on penalties to Salisbury City in the final after the game had ended 2–2. The club were transferred back to the Northern Premier League in 2011 and finished fifth in 2011–12 before losing 5–0 to Bradford Park Avenue in the play-off semi-finals.

A fourth successive play-off campaign was secured when Hednesford were Premier Division runners-up in 2012–13. After beating AFC Fylde 3–1 on penalties in the semi-finals following a 3–3 draw, they defeated F.C. United of Manchester 2–1 in the final, earning promotion to the Conference North. Their first season back in the Conference North ended with a fourth-place finish and a play-off semi-final defeat to Altrincham, losing 4–3 on aggregate. In 2015–16 they finished second-from-bottom of the renamed National League North and were relegated to the Northern Premier League&#x27;s Premier Division. The 2022–23 season saw them relegated to Division One West of the Northern Premier League.

==Ground==
The club originally played at a ground behind the Anglesey Hotel, which became known as &#x27;the Tins&#x27; due to the metal sheeting that was erected around the ground. In 1904 they moved to the Cross Keys ground after a local councillor agreed to pay off the club&#x27;s £40 debt if they moved away from the Tins. The first match at the new stadium drew a crowd of 900 to see Hednesford beat Stafford 3–1. A large wooden stand was erected on one side of the pitch and banking on the other. The banking was replaced by a pitch-length stand in the 1950s and floodlights were installed in 1953, with over 7,000 attending the inauguration match in which local rivals Wolves defeated West Brom 4–2.

By the 1990s the capacity of Cross Keys had been reduced to around 4,000. The final match at the ground saw Hednesford beat Leek Town to secure the Southern League title and promotion to the Football Conference in front of 2,776 spectators. The club then moved to Keys Park, which was built at a cost of £1.3m. The ground initially had a capacity of 3,500, but was expanded during the 1997–98 season and now has a capacity of 6,039, of which 1,011 is seated and 5,335 covered.

<doc id="581670" wikidata="Q705221" url="?curid=581670" title="Haruomi Hosono">
<text>, sometimes credited as Harry Hosono, is a Japanese musician, singer, songwriter and record producer. He is considered to be one of the most influential musicians in Japanese pop music history, credited with shaping the sound of Japanese pop for decades as well as pop music outside of Japan. He also inspired genres such as city pop and Shibuya-kei, and as the leader of the Yellow Magic Orchestra, contributed to the development and pioneering of numerous electronic genres.

The grandson of &quot;Titanic&quot; survivor Masabumi Hosono, Haruomi began his career with the psychedelic rock band Apryl Fool, before achieving recognition both nationally and internationally, as a founding member of the bands Happy End and Yellow Magic Orchestra. Hosono has also released many solo albums covering a variety of styles, including film soundtracks and a variety of electronic ambient albums. As well as recording his own music, Hosono has done considerable production work for other artists such as Miharu Koshi, Sheena and the Roketts, Sandii &amp; the Sunsetz, Chisato Moritaka and Seiko Matsuda. In 2003, Hosono was ranked by HMV Japan at number 44 on their list of the top 100 Japanese pop acts of all time.

==Biography==

Hosono is the grandson of Masabumi Hosono, the only Japanese passenger and survivor of the sinking of RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. Hosono first came to attention in Japan as the bass player of the psychedelic rock band Apryl Fool, alongside drummer Takashi Matsumoto, who released the album &quot;The Apryl Fool&quot; in 1969. Hosono and Matsumoto then formed the influential folk rock group Happy End with Eiichi Ohtaki and Shigeru Suzuki. One of the songs he composed for Happy End, &quot;Kaze wo Atsumete&quot; (1971), later appeared in the American film &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; and on its soundtrack in 2003. After &quot;Happy End&quot; disbanded around 1974, Hosono worked with Suzuki and a loose association of artists making &quot;exotica&quot;-style music under the title &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot;.

His involvement in electronic music also dates back to the early 1970s, when he performed the electric bass for Inoue Yousui&#x27;s folk pop rock album &quot;Ice World&quot; (1973) and Osamu Kitajima&#x27;s progressive/psychedelic rock album &quot;Benzaiten&quot; (1974), both of which were electronic rock records utilizing synthesizers, electric guitars, and in the latter, electronic drums and rhythm machines.

In 1977, Hosono invited Ryuichi Sakamoto and Yukihiro Takahashi to work on his exotica-flavoured album &quot;Paraiso&quot;, which included electronic music produced using the Yamaha CS-80 polyphonic synthesizer and ARP Odyssey synthesizer. The band was named &quot;Harry Hosono and the Yellow Magic Band&quot; and, having been recorded in late 1977, &quot;Paraiso&quot; was released in early 1978. The three worked together again for the 1978 electronic album &quot;Pacific&quot;, which included an early version of the song &quot;Cosmic Surfin&#x27;&quot;.

In 1978, he released an innovative electronic soundtrack for a fictional Bollywood film, &quot;Cochin Moon&quot;, together with artist Tadanori Yokoo and future YMO band members Ryuichi Sakamoto and Hideki Matsutake. Inspired by a trip to India and &quot;the exotic, luxurious, and seemingly wonder-filled scenarios played out in Indian cinemas&quot;, it was an experimental &quot;electro-exotica&quot; album fusing exotic Indian music (reminiscent of Ravi Shankar and Bollywood music) with electronic music, including an early &quot;synth raga&quot; song entitled &quot;Hum Ghar Sajan&quot; (from a Guru Granth Sahib phrase). The same year, he contributed to Sakamoto&#x27;s song &quot;1000 Knives&quot; for his solo album, &quot;Thousand Knives&quot;, which experimented with fusing electronic music with traditional Japanese music in early 1978.

He was one of the first producers to recognize the appeal of video game sounds and music. YMO&#x27;s self-titled debut in 1978 contained substantial video game sounds and after YMO disbanded an early project was an album simply titled &quot;Video Game Music&quot; containing mixed and edited Namco arcade game music and sounds. &quot;Video Game Music&quot; was released in 1984 as an early example of a chiptune record and the first video game music album. That same year, he also produced the theme song for Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s popular anime film &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot;, &quot;Kaze no Tani no Naushika&quot;, with vocals by actress-singer Narumi Yasuda. In the late 80s and early 90s, the influence of world music on his music deepened, and he worked with international singers and musicians such as Amina Annabi.

He has produced a number of short-term band projects as a band member. His first post-YMO band was Friends of Earth. As with most of his projects he combines musical styles he&#x27;s interested in. F.O.E. seemed to be a combination of funk and techno, and included a collaboration with James Brown and Maceo Parker for a remake of the song &quot;Sex Machine&quot;. Another notable band project was 1995&#x27;s Love, Peace &amp; Trance. Members were Mimori Yusa (&quot;Love&quot;), Miyako Koda (&quot;Peace&quot;), Haruomi Hosono (&quot;&amp;&quot;) and Mishio Ogawa (&quot;Trance&quot;).

In the 1990s he started the Daisyworld label to release a wide range of experimental artists from Japan and the rest of the world. Hosono collaborated on many of the releases, such as World Standard, a trip into Americana; HAT, a supergroup (the acronym stands for Hosono, Atom Heart, Tetsu Inoue), and &quot;Quiet Logic&quot;, by Mixmaster Morris and Jonah Sharp. The Orb also paid tribute with a series of remixes including the notorious &quot;Hope You Choke on Your Whalemeat&quot; remix of &quot;Nanga Def&quot;.
In 2002 Haruomi formed the duo Sketch Show with his YMO bandmate Yukihiro Takahashi. They have released two albums, one of which, &quot;Loophole&quot;, has received a UK release. When the third former YMO member, Ryuichi Sakamoto deepened his involvement it was decided to bill those collaborations as .

In the spring of 2007, his fellow YMO members and other artist paid tribute to Haruomi with a 2-disc album titled &quot;Tribute to Haruomi&quot;. That same year, the animated film &quot;Appleseed Ex Machina&quot; was released featuring a soundtrack performed and supervised by Hosono.

In September 2010 he performed at the De La Fantasia festival and played songs from his upcoming album.

In February 2011 it was announced that his new album, entitled &quot;HoSoNoVa&quot;, was to be released on April 20. He also performed a special concert to celebrate its release.

In May 2018, Light in the Attic Records announced a CD and vinyl reissue of five of Hosono&#x27;s albums—&quot;Hosono House&quot;, &quot;Cochin Moon&quot;, &quot;Paraiso&quot;, &quot;Philharmony&quot; and &quot;omni Sight Seeing&quot;—for release in August and September 2018. The former four albums had never been released outside of Japan previously. Coinciding was the announcement that Hosono would play his first UK concerts as a solo artist in June; the shows were scheduled as part of Sakamoto&#x27;s MODE festival happening throughout England in June and July. The June 23 concert at the Barbican Centre in London featured an appearance by his YMO bandmates, with whom he performed his &quot;Solid State Survivor&quot; composition &quot;Absolute Ego Dance&quot;.

2019 marked Hosono&#x27;s 50th anniversary in the music industry. On March 6, he released &quot;Hochono House&quot;, a mostly electronic remake of his solo debut &quot;Hosono House&quot; that reversed the track listing. That spring, he performed his first solo shows in the U.S. This run included two sold-out shows at the Gramercy Theatre in New York City and a concert at the Mayan Theater in Los Angeles. The second New York show saw an appearance by current NYC resident Akiko Yano, who collaborated with Hosono in Tin Pan Alley, as a live support member of YMO, and as a solo artist; she sang Hosono&#x27;s &quot;Ai Ai Gasa&quot;, which she covered on her 1977 album &quot;Iroha Ni Konpeitou&quot;. In LA, Canadian indie rock musician Mac DeMarco—whose vocal admiration of Hosono has spread to a portion of his own fanbase—appeared during the show to perform &quot;Honey Moon&quot; as a duet with Hosono; Light in the Attic had recently released a cover of the song on a 7&quot; single record, backed with the original version.

In the autumn of 2019, an exhibition on Hosono&#x27;s career—&quot;Hosono Sightseeing&quot;—was on display in Tokyo Sky View at the Roppongi Hills Mori Tower; along with other memorabilia, this featured many of the instruments associated with Hosono, such as the Roland TR-808, E-mu Emulator, and Prophet-5. A documentary film, &quot;No Smoking&quot;, was also released, including footage from the U.S. and UK shows; appearances include Sakamoto, Takahashi, Demarco, longtime friend Van Dyke Parks, and protégé Gen Hoshino.

<text>The American Heart Association (AHA) is a nonprofit organization in the United States that funds cardiovascular medical research, educates consumers on healthy living and fosters appropriate cardiac care in an effort to reduce disability and deaths caused by cardiovascular disease and stroke. They are known for publishing guidelines on cardiovascular disease and prevention, standards on basic life support, advanced cardiac life support (ACLS), pediatric advanced life support (PALS), and in 2014 issued the first guidelines for preventing strokes in women. The American Heart Association is also known for operating a number of highly visible public service campaigns starting in the 1970s, and also operates several fundraising events.

Originally formed in Chicago in 1924, the American Heart Association is currently headquartered in Dallas, Texas. It was originally headquartered in New York City. The American Heart Association is a national voluntary health agency.
The mission of the organization, updated in 2018, is &quot;To be a relentless force for a world of longer, healthier lives.&quot; The organization&#x27;s work can be divided into five key areas: research; heart and brain health; health equity; advocacy; and professional education and development.

==History==
===1924–1980s===

In 1924, cardiologists Paul Dudley White, Hugh D. McCulloch, Joseph Sailer, Robert H. Halsey, James B. Herrick, and Lewis A. Conner, formed the Association for the Prevention and Relief of Heart Disease as a professional society for doctors. In 1948, the organization transitioned into a nationwide voluntary health organization. Since 1949, it has funded over $5 billion in cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and brain health research. The organization, now known as the American Heart Association, consists of over 33 million volunteers who are dedicated to improving heart health and reducing deaths from cardiovascular diseases.

In the 1950s and 1960s, the American Heart Association published several reports and guidelines focused on recommended lifestyles to improve cardiovascular health. This included a 1957 report that said: (1) Diet may play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, (2) The fat content and total calories in the diet are probably important factors, (3) The ratio between saturated and unsaturated fat may be the basic determinant, and (4) A wide variety of other factors besides fat, both dietary and non-dietary, may be important.

By 1961, these findings had been strengthened, leading to the new 1961 American Heart Association recommendations: (1) Maintain a correct body weight, (2) Engage in moderate exercise, e.g., walking to aid in weight reduction, (3) Reduce intake of total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol. Increase intake of polyunsaturated fat, (4) Men with a strong family history of atherosclerosis should pay particular attention to diet modification, and (5) Dietary changes should be carried out under medical supervision. These recommendations continued to become more precise from 1957 to 1980, but there maintained &quot;a general coherence among them&quot;.

===1990s–2000s===
In 1994, the &quot;Chronicle of Philanthropy&quot;, an industry publication, released the results of the largest study of charitable and non-profit organization popularity and credibility. The study showed that the American Heart Association was ranked as the fifth &quot;most popular charity/non-profit in America&quot; of over 100 charities researched, with 95 percent of Americans over the age of 12 choosing the &quot;Love&quot; and &quot;Like A lot&quot; description categories.

In 1998, the AHA created the American Stroke Association to help prevent strokes, improve treatments, and maximize recoveries. In 2003, the two organizations created the Get With the Guidelines (GWTG)-Stroke program. It is a voluntary registry that hospitals can use to receive the latest scientific treatment guidelines. The program also collects data on patient characteristics, hospital adherence to guidelines, and patient outcomes.

In 2004 the American Heart Association launched the &quot;Go Red for Women&quot; campaign specifically targeting women, with information about risks and action they can take to protect their health. All revenues from the local and national campaigns go to support awareness, research, education and community programs to benefit women.

In 2008, the AHA recommended “hands only” CPR as an option for bystanders who want to help keep a cardiac arrest victim alive. This method removes the practice of performing rescue breaths and depends solely on chest compressions.

On November 30, 2009, The American Heart Association announced a new cardiac arrest awareness campaign called Be the Beat. The campaign&#x27;s aim is to teach 12- to 15-year-olds fun ways to learn the basics of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and how to use an automated external defibrillator.

===2012–present: Recent events and activities===

In 2012, the AHA renewed its focus on hands-only CPR by carrying out a national campaign to educate more people on how to perform this method. Jennifer Coolidge was a spokesperson for the campaign.

It also carried out a campaign in 2012 to educate more people on how to carry out hands-only CPR. The 2012 campaign, which began in New York City, had Jennifer Coolidge as the spokesperson.

In 2013, the American Heart Association issued a joint guideline recognizing obesity as a disease and recommending its treatment by weight loss.

In 2014, the American Heart Association issued its first guidelines for preventing strokes in women. Just as heart attack systems differ between men and women, men and women also face different stroke risks. For women, the guidelines for preventing strokes focus on factors such as birth control, pregnancy, and depression.

In 2015, the American Heart Association officially endorsed the Tobacco 21 campaign, urging local, state and national governments to raise the tobacco and nicotine sales age from 18 to 21.

In 2016, the American Heart Association, Verily Life Sciences, and AstraZeneca invested $75 million in the One Brave Idea program. The money was awarded to institutions researching new biomarkers, such as genetic and molecular factors, that put individuals at risk for atherosclerosis. It was hoped that the research would help the AHA reach its goals of increasing cardiovascular health by 20% and reducing cardiovascular mortality by 20% by 2020.

In 2017, the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and nine other groups redefined high blood pressure for the first time in fourteen years. Under the new guidelines, the high blood pressure reading is 130 over 80, a change from the old 140 over 80. The change was made in recognition of the risk of heart disease, disability, and death faced by those with blood pressures at 130 over 80. The organization said that they hoped by identifying cardiovascular risks earlier, more people would be able to address the health risks by lifestyle changes instead of medication.

In 2018, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology issued new guidelines for clinicians on the management of cholesterol as a way to reduce risk for heart attack and stroke. Newly included in the guidelines is a recommendation to use coronary artery calcium score if healthcare providers are having difficulty deciding if a patient could benefit from statin medications or should focus solely on lifestyle modifications. The cholesterol guidelines were last updated in 2013.

In 2020 and 2021, the annual flagship meeting of the organization was held virtually owing to the COVID-19 pandemic and resumed as an in-person conference in 2022.

In June 2024, the American Heart Association celebrated its 100 year anniversary of its founding. With the official celebration of its founding, the association was recognized as the nation’s oldest and largest voluntary organization dedicated to fighting heart disease and stroke. The association held CPR training, where in many places the first hundred or so people to participate in the 5-minute training were given take-home CPR kits.

== Focus areas ==
Some of the American Heart Association&#x27;s research, campaigns, and other work is included here.

=== Research ===
Since 1949, the association has funded over $5 billion in cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and brain health research.

==== Strategically Focused Research Network (SFRN) ====
In 2014, the American Heart Association announced the Strategically Focused Research Network initiative to address &quot;key strategic issues as determined by the AHA Board of Directors.&quot; Some of the topics focused on by SFRNs include hypertension, heart failure, heart disease, and health technologies and innovation.

=== Heart and brain health ===

==== Go Red for Women ====
The Go Red for Women campaign started in 2004 to raise awareness that women, and not only men, are vulnerable to heart disease. Between 2016 and 2021, the American Heart Association invested $20 million in the Go Red for Women Strategically Focused Research Network. The SFRN also received $52 million from the National Institutes of Health.

In 2017, the Go Red National Leadership Council was started to engage female executives in the campaign. Additional projects associated with the campaign include Research Goes Red and National Wear Red Day.

As of 2023, over 900,000 women have joined the campaign and receive updates on what they can do to improve their heart health. The campaign&#x27;s social media channels had audiences of over 5.3 million in 2022.

Also in 2023, Miss America’s Scholarship Foundation, a 501(c)(3), announced a 3-year commitment supporting American Heart Association’s women’s initiative, Go Red for Women®. This initiative raises funds and awareness of women’s heart health and bringing fitness initiatives back to the national Miss America competition stage after the swimsuit portion was scrapped in 2018.

==== Be the Beat ====
The &quot;Be the Beat&quot; challenge encourages people to learn CPR.

==== American Heart Association CEO Roundtable ====
The CEO Roundtable was formed in 2013 and focuses on implementing evidence-based approaches to workplace health. In 2020, the CEOs of CVS Health, Walgreens Boots Alliance, and US Foods joined the association. In 2023, there were almost 50 Fortune 100 CEOs in the association.

==== American Stroke Association ====
In 1998, the association created the American Stroke Association to help prevent strokes, improve treatments, and maximize recoveries. In 2003, the two organizations created the Get With the Guidelines (GWTG)-Stroke program. It is a voluntary registry that hospitals can use to receive the latest scientific treatment guidelines. The program also collects data on patient characteristics, hospital adherence to guidelines, and patient outcomes.

The American Heart Association announced in October of 2024 a grant aimed at improving heart health in rural communities by funding initiatives that address healthcare access and education. This support is expected to enhance resources for prevention and treatment of heart disease in underserved areas.

==== R.A.P.I.D.O. Campaign ====
This 2023 Spanish-language campaign works to raise awareness among Hispanic Americans about stroke symptoms. The acronym stands for:

* Rostro caído (face drooping)
* Alteración del equilibrio (loss of balance or lack of coordination)
* Pérdida de fuerza en el brazo (arm weakness)
* Impedimento visual repentino (sudden vision difficulty)
* Dificultad para hablar (slurred or strange speech)
* Obtén ayuda, llama al 911 (get help, call 911)
The American Stroke Association has launched a new Spanish-language website, to educate Hispanic and Latino communities about stroke recognition, prevention, and recovery.

==== Know Diabetes By Heart ====
This is a joint campaign from the American heart Association and the American Diabetes Association. It works to raise awareness about the connection between diabetes and heart disease. The AHA reports that adults with diabetes are 2-4 times more likely to die from heart disease than adults without diabetes.

==== Check. Change. Control. ====
The &quot;Check. Change. Control.&quot; program is an evidence-based hypertension management program that encourages blood pressure self-monitoring. In 2019 it was used by more than 315,000 people.

==== Nation of Lifesavers ====
This program was started in 2023 to “educate and prepare teens and adults to be confident to save life in a cardiac emergency.” More than 350,000 people have out-of-hospital cardiac arrests each year, and this program wants to help improve their survival rate.

As part of National Wear Red Day, Buffalo Bills NFL player Damar Hamlin joined the American Heart Association at the Empire State Building to raise awareness about heart health. Hamlin, who survived a cardiac arrest on the field during a January 2023 game versus the Cincinnati Bengals, shared his experience of how a direct hit caused his heart to stop and emphasized the importance of heart health and emergency response. Cardiologist Dr. Joseph Puma highlighted that timely medical attention, including heart scans, can prevent life-threatening events, urging individuals to seek care if experiencing chest pain, shortness of breath, or other warning signs of heart issues. 

==== Life’s Essential 8 ====
Life’s Essential 8 (LE8) are cardiovascular health measurements shared by the AHA. Previously the measurements were known as the LE7, but in 2022 the AHA added sleep health as an additional behavioral metric. The other metrics look at body weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, smoking, physical activity, and diet.

=== Health equity ===
The American Heart Association’s 2024 Impact Goal states, &quot;Every person deserves the opportunity for a full, healthy life. By 2024, as champions for health equity, the American Heart Association will advance cardiovascular health for all, including identifying and removing barriers to health care access and quality.&quot;

The AHA partnered with the Deloitte Health Equity Institute and the Society for Human Resource Management Foundation on the Health Equity in the Workforce initiative. The initiative provides tools to help employers improve health equity in the workplace.

==== Social Impact Fund ====
The AHA&#x27;s Social Impact Fund is a nationwide fund that provides financial resources for &quot;evidence-based, community driven entrepreneurial solutions that help remove the social and economic barriers to health equity and drive economic empowerment, healthy food access, affordable housing, access to quality healthcare, transportation, educational opportunities, and reduce recidivism.&quot;

Organizations that have received funding include:

* Sakan Community Resource
* Hmong American Farmers Association
* Better Futures Minnesota
* Sidekick Mobile Technologies
* Sweet Potato Patch

==== Hispanic Serving Institution Scholars Program ====
The HSI scholarship program is for students who identify as Hispanic/Latino who are enrolled in public health and healthcare focused programs at 18 Hispanic-serving colleges and universities. The program&#x27;s goal is to increase representation in health care. Students in the program are paired with volunteer mentors. They develop and present a research project that addresses basic, clinical, and educational science, receive a stipend, and participate in professional development workshops.

==== Historically Black Colleges and Universities Scholars Program ====
The HBCU Scholars program pairs students with a local American Heart Association researcher and was created to &quot;&quot;support the development of minority scientists and healthcare professionals&quot;,&quot; and increase the number of minority students who apply and are accepted into biomedical and health science programs. Students and researchers study the impact of cardiovascular disease in their community, learn the factors affecting vulnerable populations, and sample areas of scientific inquiry. Students also receive financial stipends.

==== HeartCorps ====
HeartCorps is the American Heart Association&#x27;s Public Health AmeriCorps program and is designed to drive health equity in rural America. As of November 2022, twenty-six states participated in the program.

=== Advocacy ===

==== Clean Indoor Air ====
The American Heart Association supports legislation that creates smoke-free workplaces and public spaces. Starting in 2014, the AHA called for regulations for e-cigarettes to prevent young people from becoming addicted to nicotine, referencing studies that suggest the e-cigarettes can be a gateway drug.

==== No Surprise Medical Billing ====
The American Heart Association supports the No Surprises Act, stating it will keep costs and premiums down and encourage more people to seek care from healthcare professionals.

==== Food is Medicine Research Initiative ====
In 2022, the American Heart Association, the Rockefeller Foundation, Kroger, and other partners announced a plan to build a national Food is Medicine Research Initiative to help provide concrete evidence that food-as-medicine programs improve health.

In September 2023, the AHA partnered with the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, the American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes Association, and the Food is Medicine Institute at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University to launch &quot;Nourish My Health&quot;. It is a national public education campaign that promotes the protective health benefits of nutritious food.

==== You&#x27;re the Cure ====
You&#x27;re the Cure is the national grassroots network of the American Heart Association.

=== Professional education and development ===
The American Heart Association publishes healthcare guidelines, statements, and performance measures.A small sample of these professional education and development resources include:

* Information to prevent strokes, improve treatments, and maximize recoveries
* Lifestyle recommendations to improve cardiovascular health
* Guidelines to prevent strokes in women
* High blood pressure definitions
* Management guidelines to reduce cardiovascular risk factors in adults with Type 2 diabetes
* Scientific statements on specific diseases
* Care guidelines for cardiovascular attacks
* Scientific statements looking at specific healthcare practices, such as shared decision-making
The AHA also holds an annual Scientific Sessions meeting, which covers several days and a number of medical/healthcare topics; and hosts an International Stroke Conference.

==== Second Century of Science Initiative ====
The Second Century of Science Initiative was announced in 2023 as part of the AHA’s plans to celebrate its first 100 years. Under the Initiative, the AHA awarded $20 million in grants to over 100 scientists in the U.S. The grants were awarded in three categories: the Second Century Implementation Science Award, the Second Century Early Faculty Independence Award, and the Clinical Fellow Research Education Program 

==== Get With the Guidelines ====
In 2003, the AHA and the American Stroke Association created the Get With the Guidelines (GWTG)-Stroke program. It is a voluntary registry that hospitals can use to receive the latest scientific treatment guidelines. The program also collects data on patient characteristics, hospital adherence to guidelines, and patient outcomes.

==Fellowship==

Fellowship is open to wide-ranged medical professionals (physicians, scientists, etc.) who demonstrate a major and productive interest in cardiovascular diseases and stroke. The association has 16 different councils. Members (at the Premium Professional or Premium Professional Plus level) of one of these councils can apply for Fellowship. All applicants from all councils will be evaluated against the same criteria. Fellows are entitled to use the post-nominal designation FAmerican Heart Association (Fellow of the American Heart Association), which reflects not only the professional stature of the Fellow but also their record of valuable service to the association and the council. In addition, American Heart Association fellowship offers several benefits; e.g., reduced subscription rates for all American Heart Association print journals and reduced registration fees for American Heart Association Scientific Sessions.

<doc id="581687" wikidata="Q16250470" url="?curid=581687" title="Basic life support">
<text>Basic life support (BLS) is a level of medical care which is used for patients with life-threatening condition of cardiac arrest until they can be given full medical care by advanced life support providers (paramedics, nurses, physicians or any trained general personnel). It can be provided by trained medical personnel, such as emergency medical technicians, qualified bystanders and anybody who is trained for providing BLS and/or ACLS .

==Background==
The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) was formed in 1992 to coordinate the efforts of resuscitation worldwide. The ILCOR representatives come from various countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and from the European, Asian, and African continents. In 2000, the committee published the first resuscitation guideline. In 2005, the committee published International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and Emergency Cardiovascular Care (ECC) Science with Treatment Recommendations. Since 2010, the committee has provided materials for regional resuscitation providers such as European Resuscitation Council and American Heart Association to write their own guidelines. Since 2015, ILCOR has used a new methodology called Consensus on Science with Treatment Recommendations (COSTR) to evaluate the quality of latest evidence available and to reach a conclusion on the best treatments available in resuscitation. Using the COSTR methodology, ILCOR also started to conduct yearly reviews and published updates on the latest evidence in resuscitation, changing it from the previous 5-yearly review on resuscitation.

CPR provided in the field increases the time available for higher medical responders to arrive and provide ALS care. An important advance in providing BLS is the availability of the automated external defibrillator or AED. This improves survival outcomes in cardiac arrest cases.

== Method ==

=== D - Danger ===
One of the first checks done in emergency response is to assess the situation for any danger. If the person does not remove themselves or others from the danger then they are liable to become a patient and require emergency assistance themselves or become unable to render assistance for the other patient. Examples of dangerous situations which should cease before BLS is administered are electrocution, assault, drowning, burning etc.

=== R - Response ===
Checking for response is the next step in emergency situations as continuing with other forceful methods of BLS could exacerbate the patient&#x27;s condition and can be seen as assault. AVPU (Alert, Verbal, Pain, Unconscious) is the commonly used acronym for quickly assessing the level of consciousness in a patient. Pain stimulus in particular should be used with caution as many methods if done incorrectly can leave bruises (sternal rub for example) commonly used methods for central stimulus are the trapezius squeeze and for peripheral stimulus it is squeezing the side of the finger.

=== S - Send for help ===
Sending for help allows much more assistance to be rendered upon the patient and increases their chances of receiving ALS.

=== A - Airway ===
Opening of the airway via the jaw-thrust maneuver is the preferred method as the head-tilt maneuver is thought to be more risky for people with suspected spinal injury or inconveniency. If the person is in danger of pulmonary aspiration then they should be placed in the recovery position or more advanced airway management should be used.

=== B - Breathing ===
Once the airway has been opened checking for breathing should begin, if the respiratory rate is below 12-20 breaths per minute then CPR should begin, however if the patient is breathing normally then the rescuer should place them in the recovery position and summon an ambulance.

=== C - CPR ===
=== D - Defibrillation ===
Once an automated external defibrillator (AED) has been acquired the rescuer should then finish the round of CPR, use the AED and then begin another round of CPR. However the AED will usually notify the rescuer of any impediments to continued CPR (such as a sinus rhythm or asystole) in which case the rescuer may be prompted to cease CPR.

== Indications ==
=== Cardiac arrest ===
Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart stops pumping in a regular rhythm. In this situation, early defibrillation is the key to returning the patient&#x27;s heart back to a normal rhythm. When a defibrillator is not readily available, a rescuer or bystander should keep the blood flowing by performing chest compressions and rescue breaths at an age-appropriate rate until it is.

=== Respiratory Arrest ===
Respiratory arrest is when there is no measurable breathing in a patient. It tends to occur in conjunction with cardiac arrest, but this is not always the case. Respiratory arrest is the most common indication of BLS in infants and toddlers. The most critical factor in restoring breathing in the patient is to provide high quality rescue breaths.

=== Shock ===
Shock, also known as Inadequate Tissue Perfusion, is a life-threatening condition that occurs as a result of the disruption to 3 major components of the cardiovascular system: Heart Function, Blood Vessel Function, and Blood Volume. Perfusion describes the process of adequate blood flow to the organs, where the waste and reactants that are involved in cellular respiration are removed or transported throughout the 3 parts of the cardiovascular system for metabolism to be processed effectively. However, if one part were to fail, important resources for cellular respiration such as oxygen would not be able to reach the organs that needs it function. In an attempt to compensate, the body diverts blood to organs that cannot tolerate the lack of blood, such as the heart and the brain, resulting in widespread vasoconstriction, or thinning of the blood vessels. Consequently, blood is prevented from reaching organs that can tolerate the lack of perfusion, or hypoperfusion, in organs such as the skin, resulting in the typical presentation of pale and clammy skin conditions during shock. Moreover, disruptions may present specifically to each component or multiple systems may be affected at the same time, which generally results in the 3 designated types of shock: Obstructive, Distributive, Hypovolemic. Typically, patients would have a presentation of shock at the Compensated, Decompensated, and Irreversible Stage.

=== Drowning ===
In cases of drowning, rescuers should provide CPR as soon as an unresponsive patient is removed from the water. In particular, rescue breathing is important in this situation. A lone rescuer is typically advised to give CPR for a short time before leaving the patient to call emergency medical services. Since the primary cause of cardiac arrest and death in drowning and choking patients is hypoxemia, it is recommended to start with rescue breaths before proceeding to chest compressions (if pulseless). If the patient presents in a shockable rhythm, early defibrillation is still recommended.

=== Choking ===

Choking occurs when a foreign body obstructs the trachea. Rescuers should only intervene in patients who show signs of severe airway obstruction, such as a silent cough, cyanosis, or inability to speak or breathe. If a patient is coughing forcefully, rescuers should not interfere with this process and encourage the patient to keep coughing. If a patient shows signs of severe airway obstruction, anti-choking maneuvers such as back slaps or in the most severe cases abdominal thrusts should be applied until the obstruction is relieved. If a patient becomes unresponsive he should be lowered to the ground, and the rescuer should call emergency medical services and initiate CPR. When the airway is opened during CPR, the rescuer should look into the mouth for an object causing obstruction, and remove with a finger sweep it if it is evident however many organisations state that the rescuer should not try to remove the foreign object as they might worsen the situation (either pushing it further down the trachea or initiating vomiting).

== Technique ==

=== United States ===
Basic Life Support Emergency Medical Services in the United States are generally identified with Emergency Medical Technicians-Basic (EMT-B). EMT-B is the highest level of healthcare provider that is limited to the BLS protocol; higher medical functions use some or all of the Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) protocols, in addition to BLS protocols. However, the American Heart Association&#x27;s BLS protocol is designed for use by laypeople, as well as students and others certified first responder, and to some extent, higher medical function personnel.

BLS for Healthcare Providers Course

According to the American Heart Association, in order to be certified in BLS, a student must take an online or in-person course. However, an online BLS course must be followed with an in-person skills session in order to obtain a certification issued by The American Heart Association.

Chain of survival

The American Heart Association highlights the most important steps of BLS in a &quot;five-link chain of survival.&quot; The chain of survival includes early recognition of an ongoing emergency, early initiation of CPR by a bystander, early use of a defibrillator, and early advanced life support once more qualified medical help arrives. Qualified bystanders with training in BLS are encouraged to perform the first three steps of the five-link chain of survival.

High Quality CPR

High quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and early defibrillation using an automated external defibrillator (AED) are the most important aspects of BLS to ensure a patient survives. CPR involves a rescuer or bystander providing chest compressions to a patient in a supine position while also giving rescue breaths. The rescuer or bystander can also choose not to provide breaths and provide compression-only CPR. Depending on the age and circumstances of the patient, there can be variations in the compression to breath ratio given.

=== Europe ===

European Resuscitation Council

According to 2015 guidelines published by European resuscitation council, early initiation of resuscitation and coordination of lay people with medical personnel on helping an unconscious person is very helpful in increasing the chance of survival of the patient. When a person is unconscious and is not breathing normally, emergency services should be alerted and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (rescue breaths) should be initiated. High quality CPR is important. An adequate ratio of high quality chest compressions and rescue breaths are crucial. An automated external defibrillator (AED) machine is essential during resuscitation. Defibrillation during the first 3 to 5 minutes during resuscitation can produce survival rates as high as 50 to 70%. Placing AEDs in public places where there is one cardiac arrest in five years is cost-effective.
Although the adult CPR sequence can be safely used in children, a modified sequence of basic life support that entails less forceful chest compression is even more suitable in children.

United Kingdom

Adult BLS guidelines in the United Kingdom were published in 2015 by the Resuscitation Council (UK), based on the &quot;2015 International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science with Treatment Recommendations (CoSTR)&quot; published in November 2005.
The newest guidelines for adult BLS allow a rescuer to diagnose cardiac arrest if the patient is unresponsive and not breathing normally. The guidelines also changed the duration of rescue breaths and the placement of the hand on the chest when performing chest compressions. These changes were introduced to simplify the algorithm, to allow for faster decision making and to maximize the time spent giving chest compressions; this is because interruptions in chest compressions have been shown to reduce the chance of survival. It is also acknowledged that rescuers may either be unable, or unwilling, to give effective rescue breaths; in this situation, continuing chest compressions alone is advised, although this is only effective for about 5 minutes.
For choking, the guidelines in the United Kingdom first call for assessing the severity of the situation. If the patient is able to speak and cough effectively, the obstruction is mild. If the patient is unable to speak or cough effectively, or is unable to breathe or is breathing with a wheezy sound, the airway obstruction is severe. It is then recommended to perform back blows until the obstruction clears. If the patient becomes unresponsive, CPR is started.

=== Other countries ===
The term BLS is also used in some non-English speaking countries (e.g. in Italy) for the education of first responders. Terms with similar meanings for similar skill sets are also common.
* Spain: SVB (&quot;soporte vital básico&quot;)
* Belgium: &quot;aide médicale urgente&quot; (&quot;emergency medical assistance&quot;)/ EHBO (&quot;eerste hulp bij ongelukken&quot;, &quot;first aid&quot;)
* Brazil: SBV (&quot;Suporte básico de vida&quot;)
* France: PSE 1 &amp; PSE 2 (&quot;Premiers Secours en Equipe niveaux 1 &amp; 2&quot;), &quot;First Aid as part of a team&quot;, level 2 includes stretchering and teamwork, (former CFAPSE before 2007 &quot;Certificat de Formation aux Activités des Premiers Secours en Equipe&quot;, &quot;Training certificate for first aid teamwork&quot;)
* Poland: &quot;Podstawowe zabiegi resuscytacyjne&quot;/ KPP (&quot;Kwalifikowana pierwsza pomoc&quot;)
* Portugal: SBV (&quot;Suporte Básico de Vida&quot;)
* Germany: &quot;Lebensrettende Sofortmaßnahmen&quot; (basic life support)
* Romania: SVB (&quot;support vital de bază&quot;)
* Netherlands: BLS (&quot;first aid&quot; is referred to as EHBO (&quot;Eerste hulp bij ongelukken&quot;))
* Turkey: TYD (&quot;temel yaşam desteği&quot;, &quot;basic life support&quot;)

== Special Populations ==
When performing BLS, laypeople and medical personnel are encouraged to remember that some groups of people have certain conditions that need to be taken into considerations.

=== Pregnant women ===
To relieve choking, chest thrusts should be used instead of abdominal thrusts when the patient is in late pregnancy.

=== Obese ===
If a patient of choking is obese and a rescuer cannot perform adequate abdominal thrusts, they are encouraged to instead perform chest thrusts.

=== Infants ===
To relieve choking, abdominal thrusts should not be used in infants under 1 year of age due to risk of causing injury. A sequence of back slaps and chest compressions are used instead.

<text>Latgale (; ; ; ; ; ; Belarusian Latin: &quot;Łathalija&quot;; ), also known as Latgalia or Latgallia, is one of the Historical Latvian Lands. It is the easternmost region of the country and lies north of the Daugava River. While most of Latvia is historically Lutheran, Latgale is predominantly Roman Catholic: 65.3% according to a 2011 survey. After the Counter-Reformation it was the northernmost predominantly Catholic province or region in Europe. There is a considerable Eastern Orthodox minority (23.8%), of which 13.8% are Russian Orthodox Christians and 10.0% are Old Believers. As of 2020, the region&#x27;s population was 255,968.

The region has a large population of ethnic Russians, especially in Daugavpils, the largest city in the region and the location of the region&#x27;s only public university, the University of Daugavpils. Many of the Russians who lived in Latgale before Soviet rule are Old Believers. Rēzekne, often called the heart of Latgale, Krāslava, and Ludza are other large towns in the region, which also has a Belarusian minority. There is also a significant Polish minority. As part of the Polotsk and Vitebsk guberniyas, the region was part of the Pale of Settlement and had a very large Jewish population – but many of the Jews were killed in WW2 and most of the remainder emigrated. Other than in Daugavpils, the Baltic German presence in Latgale was less sizable than in other regions of Latvia. According to the Latvian Official Statistics portal, Latgale is the only region of Latvia where the number of Slavs surpasses the number of ethnic Latvians. 

Average incomes in the region are lower than in other parts of the country. Latgale also has the highest percentage of people at risk of poverty (32.7% in 2023) in Latvia.

==History==
=== Name ===
Historically, several different forms of the name Latgalia have been used.

*Other names for the region include Lettigallia, Latgallia, and Latgola.
*The people are called &quot;latgalieši&quot; in Latvian (as distinct from &quot;latgaļi&quot;, which refers to the ancient tribe, though some modern Latgalians prefer &quot;latgaļi&quot;) – &quot;latgalīši&quot; in Latgalian, sometimes &quot;latgali&quot; – Latgalians, Latgallians, or Lettigalls in English, and are sometimes referred to as &quot;čangaļi&quot; (sometimes derogatory – the reference is to a novel, and Latgalians often call other Latvians &quot;čiuļi&quot;). The term &quot;latgalieši&quot; dates only to the early 20th century, and before that Latgalians were long referred to as Latvians or Inflantians (Latgalian: &quot;latvīši&quot;, &quot;inflantīši&quot;). 

Since 2004, use of the Latgalian language has been the subject of a major sociolinguistic/ethnolinguistic poll and study, conducted by the Rēzekne Augstskola and the Centre d&#x27;Étude Linguistiques Pour l&#x27;Europe.

As of 2011 97,600 people in the region spoke Latgalian language, which is a standardised form of local varieties of High Latvian dialect.

=== Early history ===

Originally the territory of what is now Latgale was populated by the Eastern Baltic Latgalian tribe. During the 10th–12th centuries two principalities, Jersika and Atzele, existed on the territory of modern Latgale and Eastern Vidzeme. In addition Latgalians inhabited parts of modern Pskov Oblast in Russia and Vitebsk Region in Belarus.

In the first decade of the 13th century the Principality of Jersika, also known as &quot;Lettia&quot;, was allied with the Principality of Polotsk and Lithuanian dukes against the Bishopric of Livonia, but was defeated in 1209. Part of it was divided between the Bishopric and the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, the remainder became a vassal country. In 1239, after the death of King Visvaldis, the latter was incorporated into the territory of the Livonian Order.

In 1242, after defeat in the Battle of the Ice, eastern Latgale (&quot;Lotygola&quot;) temporarily passed to the Novgorod Republic. In 1263, Livonian knights started to build the Wolkenburg castle as the seat of an order convent near the Rāzna lake (today within the Rāzna National Park). It became the oldest order stronghold of the Latgale region.

In 1277, Grand duke Traidenis of Lithuania unsuccessfully besieged the newly built castle of Daugavpils.

=== Latgale as part of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ===

Latgalian territories remained a part of Livonian confederation until the Livonian War. During this war, Latgale was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (1559–1562), which in 1569 was incorporated into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Ivan IV of Russia annexed Latgale in 1577, but renounced his claims to Livonia after the successful Livonian campaign of the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Stephen Báthory in Truce of Yam-Zapolsky on 15 January 1582.

In 1621 most of the Duchy of Livonia was ceded to the Swedish Empire, but part of the Duchy including Latgale remained under Polish-Lithuanian control. This became known as the Inflanty Voivodeship. The creation of Polish Inflanty is the birth of the region we now know of as Latgale. During this period the Latgalian language was influenced by Polish and developed separately from the Latvian spoken in other parts of Latvia.

=== Latgale as part of Russian Empire ===
In 1772, Latgale was annexed by the Russian Empire after the First Partition of Poland. Latgale was incorporated into the Vitebsk Governorate. In 1860, Daugavpils and Rēzekne became a part of the Saint Petersburg–Warsaw railway route. In 1865, as part of Russia&#x27;s anti-Polish policies, a period of Russification was begun, during which the Latgalian language (written in Latin script) was forbidden.

This ban was lifted in 1904, and a period of Latgalian reawakening began. Two years later, Latgalian politician Francis Trasuns was elected as a member of the State Duma of the Russian Empire.

=== Latgale as part of independent Latvia ===
After the First Latgale Latvians Congress in 1917, it was decided that Dvinsky, Lyutsinsky and Rezhitsky Uyezds, populated mostly by Latvians should be transferred to Governorate of Livonia. It became a part of the Latvian Soviet autonomy of Iskolat and a part of the Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic on 17 December 1918.
In January 1920, a joint force of Latvian and Polish armies defeated the Soviet 15th Army in the battle of Daugavpils which lead to the resignation of the government of Soviet Latvia on 13 January and Latvian-Russian cease-fire on 1 February 1920.

After signing of the Latvian–Soviet Peace Treaty, parts of the Vitebsk Governorate and Pskov Governorate were incorporated into the new Republic of Latvia. United with other ethnic Latvian territories, as claimed by the declaration of independence (ethnic borders as national borders), they formed the districts of Daugavpils, Ludza, Rēzekne and Jaunlatgale, later Abrene district.

=== Latgale during and after World War II ===
During the World War II, Latgale was first occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 and by the Nazi Germany in 1941. In 1944, at the beginning of the second occupation of Latvia by the Soviet Union, the eastern municipalities of the Abrene district including Abrene were incorporated into the Russian SFSR.

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the restoration of Latvian independence in 1991, Latgale regained its status of one of the cultural regions of the Republic of Latvia.

==Geography==

The land size of Latgale is 14,547 km2 and it is bigger than some of the European countries, such as Montenegro, Cyprus and Luxembourg. Latgale is the easternmost region of Latvia and is located north of the Daugava River. It is a landlocked region that has no access to sea or ocean. It shares international borders with Russia and Belarus. The most populated cities in Latgale are Daugavpils (82,046) and Rēzekne (31,216).

The municipalities of Latvia that are a part of Latgale are Balvi Municipality, the city of Daugavpils, Ludza Municipality, Līvāni Municipality, Preiļi Municipality, Rēzekne Municipality and Varakļāni Municipality, as well as parts of Alūksne Municipality (Liepna Parish), Augšdaugava Municipality, Jēkabpils Municipality (parts on the right bank of the Daugava), Krāslava Municipality (excluding Kaplava Parish), Madona Municipality (Barkava Parish and lower portion of Ošupe Parish) and half of Aiviekste Parish (on the left bank of Aizmata River) and the Gostiņi neighbourhood of Pļaviņas of Aizkraukle Municipality.

Latgale is known as &quot;The land of lakes&quot; due to large number of lakes in the region. The biggest lake in Latgale and second biggest in Latvia is Lake Rāzna in Rēzekne Municipality. Its area is 57.81 km2. Lake Drīdzis, located in the Krāslava Municipality is the deepest lake in Latvia with a maximum depth of 65.1 meters. Dubna is the longest river in Latgale and 8th longest river in Latvia with a length of 120 kilometres. Other major rivers of the region are Rēzekne (116 km) and Malta (105 km).

The highest point of Latgale is Lielais Liepukalns, 289.8 meters high.

==Culture==
Latgale region historically had its cultural differences in comparison to the rest of Latvia, such as religion, traditions, and language.

===Religion===
Due to the influence of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the population of Latgale has remained predominantly a Roman Catholic (65.8% of the population in 2011), while Lutheranism has been more common in other regions of Latvia.

One of the most important Catholic spiritual centers in Latvia is located in Aglona. Built in 1780, Basilica of the Assumption of Aglona that is one of the eight international shrines recognized by the Holy See, historically has been a popular destination for the pilgrims. Thousands of pilgrims from Latvia and abroad visit Aglona every year on 15 August, to attend the feast day of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Aglona has been twice visited by a Roman pontiff. Pope John Paul II visited Aglona in 1993 and Pope Francis in 2018.

=== Latgalian pottery ===
The region of Latgale historically has been the most prolific producer of ceramic wares. Archeological investigations have shown that Latgalians were well acquitted with the pottery craft in the period of early medieval state of Jersika. Most of the types of wares of Latgalian ceramics, such as &quot;vuoraunīks&quot; (a pot for cooking), &quot;madaunīks&quot; (a pot for honey storage), &quot;sloinīks&quot; (a pot for storing fruit preserves), &quot;stuodiņs&quot; (a pot for storing sour cream), &quot;ļaks&quot; (a vessel for storage of oil), &quot;pīna pūds&quot; (a pot for storing cow&#x27;s milk), &quot;kazeļnīks&quot; (a pot for goat milk storage), &quot;puorūss&quot; (lit. &quot;over-handle&quot;, a vessel for bringing food to the field), &quot;bļūda&quot; (bowl) and &quot;kryuze&quot;, were used in the local households for everyday use for several centuries.

In 20th century, Latgalian ceramicists started to create decorative wares, such as candlesticks and decorative plates. Latgalian ceramics rose to the international prominence, when Andrejs Paulāns and Polikarps Vilcāns works were awarded with a Gold Medal at the 1937 Paris Exhibition. In early Soviet period, Latgalian ceramicists struggled because of high taxes and being forced to join the kolkhoz&#x27;s. Since 50&#x27;s, ceramicists became more respected thanks to the enthusiasm of Gaigalava-born art historian Jānis Pujāts, who organized exhibitions in Latvia and outside its borders that showcased the works of several Latgalian ceramicists. In 1958, Andrejs Paulāns and Polikarps Vilcāns became first Latgalian ceramicists to be recognized as the People&#x27;s Artists of the Latvian SSR.

Ceramics remains one of the trademarks of Latgale and has a great legacy in the region. Established in 1976, Latgale Ceramics Studio in Rēzekne was renamed to Andrejs Paulāns Folk Applied Art Studio in 1986. One of the streets in the Latgalian town of Preiļi is named in honor of him. In Rainis Museum in Jasmuiža are located the relocated workshop and kiln of Andrejs Paulāns, and a unique tile stove made by ceramicist Ādams Kāpostiņš. In Preiļi there is a house museum, dedicated to the Order of the Three Stars recipient - ceramicist Polikarps Čerņavskis.

In 2020, the Bank of Latvia issued a commemorative &quot;Latgalian Ceramics&quot; 2 euro coin that features a candelabra on it.

==Notable people==
Famous people who have been born or lived in present-day Latgale:

<doc id="581695" wikidata="Q1282684" url="?curid=581695" title="Stichomythia">
<text>Stichomythia () is a technique in verse drama in which sequences of single alternating lines, or half-lines (hemistichomythia) or two-line speeches (distichomythia) are given to alternating characters. It typically features repetition and antithesis. The term originated in the theatre of Ancient Greece, though many dramatists since have used the technique. Etymologically it derives from the Greek &quot;stikhos&quot; (&quot;row, line of verse&quot;) + &quot;muthos&quot; (&quot;speech, talk&quot;).

Stichomythia is particularly well suited to sections of dramatic dialogue where two characters are in violent dispute. The rhythmic intensity of the alternating lines combined with quick, biting ripostes in the dialogue can create a powerful effect.

==In Ancient Greek drama==
Stichomythia originated in Greek drama, where, in the early plays of Aeschylus it applies to exchanges between the protagonist and the chorus. Adolf Gross concludes that stichomythia developed from choral response. J. Leonard Hancock differs in this regard, not finding overwhelming evidence for any particular origin theory, but admitting that the role of musical symmetry must have been significant. Instead he finds that the trends, within Ancient Greek aesthetics, toward agonistic expression, subtlety in language, and love of symmetry, helped to give rise to stichomythia as a popular dialogue device.

==In Seneca==
Senecan stichomythia, while ultimately derived from Athenian stichomythia (as Roman theatre is derived from Greek theatre generally) differs in several respects. First, Seneca uses the technique less than all but the earliest extant pieces of classical Greek tragedy. Secondly, the stichomythic form found in Seneca is less rigid. Finally, and most substantially, Seneca&#x27;s tragedies are much more prone to revolve around literary quibbles, even leaving aside the plot of the play for entire sections while the characters engage in an essentially linguistic tangent.

==In more recent theatre==
Renaissance Italian and French drama developed in many respects as an imitation of the classic drama of the Greeks and Romans. Stichomythic elements, however, were often absent. Where they did occur, they tended to follow the lead of Seneca in using “catchwords” as launching points for each subsequent line.

Modern theatre rarely uses verse, so any construct that depends on verse, such as stichomythia, is also rare. Where a form of stichomythia has been used, the characters involved are typically building subsequent lines on the ideas or metaphors of previous lines, rather than words.

==General trends==
In terms of character relationships, stichomythia can represent interactions as mundane as question-and-answer exchanges, or as tense as heated rapid-fire arguments. While the equal line lengths can create a sense of equality of voice between the characters, stichomythia can also feature one character silencing another with a vociferous rebuff, especially where one character&#x27;s line interrupts the other&#x27;s.

In terms of how stichomythia moves forward as a section of dialogue, the Ancient Greeks tended to favor subtle flavorings and reflavorings of grammatical particles, whereas Senecan (and by extension Renaissance) stichomythic passages often turned on verbal minutiae or “catchwords”. Modern theatre, on the other hand, uses the technique in such a manner that the characters use each line to add depth to a shared idea or metaphor.

==Examples==

===Sophocles===
A short example from R. C. Jebb&#x27;s translation of &quot;Antigone&quot;: the scene is an argument between Ismene and her sister Antigone.
For further examples from &quot;Antigone&quot;, consult the text at the Internet Classics Archive .

ISMENE: And what life is dear to me, bereft of thee? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Ask Creon; all thy care is for him. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE: Why vex me thus, when it avails thee nought? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Indeed, if I mock, &#x27;tis with pain that I mock thee. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE: Tell me,—how can I serve thee, even now? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Save thyself: I grudge not thy escape. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE: Ah, woe is me! And shall I have no share in thy fate? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Thy choice was to live; mine, to die. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE: At least thy choice was not made without my protest. &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: One world approved thy wisdom; another, mine.&lt;br&gt;
=== Shakespeare (an example of hemistichomythia) ===
&quot;Richard III&quot;, Act I, Scene ii. Richard Plantagenet, Earl of Gloucester (later Richard III of England) threatens to kill himself unless Lady Anne, widow of Prince Edward (of Lancaster), agrees to marry him.
LADY ANNE: I would I knew thy heart.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER: &#x27;Tis figured in my tongue.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE: I fear me both are false.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER: Then never man was true.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE: Well, well, put up your sword.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER: Say, then, my peace is made.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE: That shall you know hereafter.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER: But shall I live in hope?&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE: All men, I hope, live so.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER: Vouchsafe to wear this ring.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE: To take is not to give. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER: Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE: Foul devil, for God&#x27;s sake, hence, and trouble us not,&lt;br&gt;
In &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Act III, Scene iv (the Closet scene), Hamlet is confronted by his mother, the queen, about the play (III, ii) which Hamlet rigged to expose his murderous step-uncle.
QUEEN: Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.&lt;br&gt;
HAMLET: Mother, you have my father much offended.&lt;br&gt;
QUEEN: Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.&lt;br&gt;
HAMLET: Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.&lt;br&gt;
In &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, Act IV, Scene i, Shylock and Bassanio enter into an argument using stichomythia at 4.1.65-9, which &quot;catches the dramatic tension of a quasi-forensic interrogation&quot;:
SHYLOCK: I am not bound to please thee with my answers.&lt;br&gt;
BASSANIO: Do all men kill the things they do not love?&lt;br&gt;
SHYLOCK: Hates any man the thing he would not kill?&lt;br&gt;
BASSANIO: Every offence is not a hate at first.&lt;br&gt;
SHYLOCK: What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice? &lt;br&gt;
A further intensification is often achieved by antilabe, in which a single verse line is distributed on alternating speakers.

===Corneille===
An exchange in &quot;Le Cid&quot; (1.3.215–226), by Pierre Corneille, has been called &quot;an excellent instance of Corneille&#x27;s skilful handling of &#x27;stichomythia&#x27;&quot;. Don Diègue (an old man, the hero&#x27;s father) has been appointed the prince&#x27;s tutor, a post that the Count (&quot;le Comte&quot;) wanted.
LE COMTE: Ce que je méritois, vous avez emporté.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: Qui l&#x27;a gagné sur vous l&#x27;avoit mieux merité.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Qui peut mieux l&#x27;exercer en est bien le plus digne.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: En être refusė n&#x27;est pas un bon signe.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Vous l&#x27;avez eu par brigue, ėtant vieux courtisan.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: L&#x27;éclat de mes hauts faits fut mon seul partisan.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Parlons-en mieux, le Roi fait honneur a votre âge.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: Le Roi, quand il en fait, le mesure au courage.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Et par là cet honneur n&#x27;était dû qu&#x27;à mon bras.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: Qui n&#x27;a pu l&#x27;obtenir ne le méritoit pas.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Ne le méritoit pas! Moi?&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: Vous.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Ton impudence,&lt;br&gt;
Téméraire viellard, aura son récompense. [&quot;Il lui donne un soufflet&quot;


===Musical drama===
In the scene in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte, where Susanna learns that Marcellina is Figaro&#x27;s mother, she repeats her disbelief (&quot;Sua madre?&quot;, that is, &quot;his mother?&quot;) to each character and is reassured in the same words. A critic has called that &quot;the merriest and most congenial form imaginable&quot; of stichomythia. For another example from opera, the following passage from the libretto by Andrea Maffei for Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;I masnadieri&quot; has been called &quot;musical stichomythia&quot;, though it does not contain repetition or antithesis:
AMALIA: Qual mare, qual terra da me t&#x27;ha diviso?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Deh! cessa, infelice, l&#x27;inchiesta crudel!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Mendaci novelle ti dissero ucciso.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Beato se chiuso m&#x27;avesse l&#x27;avel!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Tu pure, o mio Carlo, provasti gli affanni?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Li possa il tuo core per sempre ignorar!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Anch&#x27;io, derelitta, ti piansi lung&#x27;anni.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: E un angelo osava per me lagrimar?

Examples from musicals are &quot;I Remember it Well&quot; (lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner, first version in the Broadway musical &quot;Love Life&quot;, second in the film &quot;Gigi&quot;) and &quot;Anything You Can Do&quot; (by Irving Berlin, from &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;). Another is from &quot;The Last Supper&quot; in &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. When Judas says Jesus knows who will betray him, a passage of stichomythia (with a two-line interruption) follows:
Jesus: Why don&#x27;t you go do it?&lt;br&gt;
Judas: You want me to do it!&lt;br&gt;
Jesus: Hurry, they&#x27;re waiting&lt;br&gt;
Judas: If you knew why I do it...&lt;br&gt;
Jesus: I don&#x27;t care why you do it&lt;br&gt;
Judas: To think I admired you,&lt;br&gt;
for now I despise you&lt;br&gt;
Jesus: You liar—you Judas&lt;br&gt;
===Film===
In the prose context of most film, stichomythia has been defined as a &quot;witty exchange of one-liners&quot; and associated with the film noir characters Jeff Bailey in &quot;Out of the Past&quot;, Sam Spade, and Philip Marlowe. Another film-noir example is in &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (dialog by Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler). Walter Neff flirts with Phyllis Dietrichson; she resists him.
Dietrichson: You were anxious to talk to [my husband] weren&#x27;t you?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Yeah, I was, but I&#x27;m sort of getting over the idea,
 if you know what I mean.&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: There&#x27;s a speed limit in this state, Mr. Neff, 45 miles an hour.&lt;br&gt;
Neff: How fast was I going officer?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: I&#x27;d say around 90.&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Suppose you get down off your motorcycle and give me a ticket?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: Suppose I let you off with a warning this time?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Suppose it doesn&#x27;t take?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: Suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Suppose I bust out crying and put my head on your shoulder?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: Suppose you try putting it on my husband&#x27;s shoulder?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: That tears it!&lt;br&gt;

<doc id="581699" wikidata="Q952341" url="?curid=581699" title="1980 Canadian federal election">
<text>The 1980 Canadian federal election was held on February 18, 1980, to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 32nd Parliament of Canada. It was called when the minority Progressive Conservative government led by Prime Minister Joe Clark was defeated in the Commons.

Clark and his government had been under attack for its perceived inexperience, for example in its handling of its 1979 election campaign commitment to move Canada&#x27;s embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to the hotly disputed territory of Jerusalem.

Clark had maintained uneasy relations with the conservative-populist Quebec-based Social Credit Party (nicknamed the Socreds), who were the fourth largest party in the House of Commons. While he needed support from the party&#x27;s six MPs to get legislation passed, he was unwilling to agree to the conditions they imposed for their support. Clark recruited one Social Credit MP, Richard Janelle, to join the PC caucus.

In December 1979, just six months after the 1979 election, Clark&#x27;s government could not collect enough votes in the House of Commons to survive. Clark&#x27;s Minister of Finance, John Crosbie, introduced an austere government budget that proposed to increase the excise tax on gasoline by 18¢ per Imperial gallon (about 4¢ a litre) to reduce the federal government&#x27;s deficit. The New Democratic Party&#x27;s finance critic, Bob Rae, proposed a subamendment to the budget motion, stating that the House of Commons did not approve of the budget. The NDP&#x27;s 27 MPs were set against the budget. The five remaining Social Credit MPs abstained, upset that the revenues from the increased gas tax were not allocated to Quebec.

In addition, one Tory MP (Alvin Hamilton) was too ill to attend the vote while two others (Flora MacDonald and Lloyd Crouse) were abroad. Meanwhile, the Liberals assembled all but one member of their caucus (Serge Joyal), even going as far as to take two MPs (Maurice Dionne and Claude Lajoie) out of the hospital for the vote. Rae&#x27;s subamendment was adopted by a vote of 139–133, bringing down the government and forcing an election.

Former Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, who had served since 1968, had announced his resignation as leader of the Liberal Party following its defeat in 1979. However, no leadership convention had been held when Clark&#x27;s Progressive Conservative government fell. Trudeau quickly rescinded his resignation and led the party to victory, winning 33 more seats than in 1979. That enabled the Liberals to form a majority government.

Clark&#x27;s Tories campaigned under the slogan, &quot;Real change deserves a fair chance,&quot; but less than a third of voters voted to give Clark another chance. The loss of the budget vote just seven months into his mandate and his subsequent defeat in the February 18 general election resulted in his ouster as leader by Brian Mulroney in 1983.

The Socreds&#x27; abstention on the crucial budget vote, even if not decisive (the vote would still have passed by 139–138 had they opposed it), contributed to a perception that the party had become irrelevant since the death of iconic leader Réal Caouette in 1976. In 1980 it ran 20 fewer candidates than it had run in 1979 and lost more than three-fifths of its vote share. It won no seats—Liberal challengers defeated all of the incumbent SC MPs—although four of its incumbent MPs did post respectable second-place finishes. Having lost its presence in the House of Commons for the first time since the 1958 Canadian federal election, Social Credit rapidly declined into obscurity. It was never a serious contender to win seats again, although the party nominally continued to exist until 1993.

The new House was very regionally polarized. The Liberals were shut out of seats west of Manitoba, although receiving more than 20 percent of the vote in each western province. The Liberal party piled up massive seat counts in the two most populous provinces to achieve their victory. Liberal candidates collected more than two thirds of the votes cast in Quebec, and the party took half its seats in just that one province. The Tories won only one seat out of 75 in Quebec, though they took 12 percent of the vote there. The Tories won 43 percent of the seats in the four Atlantic provinces, which helped them elect more than a hundred MPs overall. All but 14 of them were elected in ridings west of Quebec.

<text>Ragavardhini (pronounced rāgavardini) has two separate meanings in Indian classical music:

* a major part of the alapana of a raga. The performer gives a step-by-step elaboration of the raga, pausing at each major note or swara.
* the 32nd &quot;melakarta&quot; raga in the Katapayadi sankhya scheme of Carnatic music.

== Melakarta ==
It is the 32nd &quot;melakarta&quot; rāgam in the 72 &quot;melakarta&quot; rāgam system of Carnatic music. It is called Rāgachudāmaṇi in Muthuswami Dikshitar school of Carnatic music.

==Structure and Lakshana==
It is the 2nd rāgam in the 6th &quot;chakra Ritu&quot;. The mnemonic name is &quot;Ritu-Sri&quot;. The mnemonic phrase is &quot;sa ru gu ma pa dha ni&quot;. Its &quot;&quot; structure is as follows (see &quot;swaras&quot; in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
*: 
*: 

The notes in this scale are &quot;shatsruthi rishabham, antara gandharam, shuddha madhyamam, shuddha dhaivatham&quot; and &quot;kaisiki nishadham&quot;. As it is a &quot;melakarta&quot;, by definition it is a &quot;sampurna&quot; rāga (has all seven notes in ascending and descending scale). It is the &quot;shuddha madhyamam&quot; equivalent of &quot;Jyoti swarupini&quot;, which is the 68th &quot;melakarta&quot; scale.

== &quot;Janya&quot; rāgas ==
&quot;Ragavardini&quot; has a few minor &quot;janya&quot; rāgas (derived scales) associated with it. See List of &quot;janya&quot; rāgas for full list of rāgas associated with &quot;Ragavardini&quot;.

== Film Songs ==
=== Language:Tamil ===
==== Janya Ragam: Swaravardhini ====
==Related rāgas==
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāga.

&quot;Ragavardini&#x27;s&quot; notes when shifted using &quot;Graha bhedam&quot;, yields &quot;Varunapriya melakarta&quot; rāga, when the shift of Tonic note is to the &quot;madhyamam&quot;. See further details and an illustration at &quot;Graha bhedam on Ragavardini&quot;.

<doc id="581704" wikidata="Q241056" url="?curid=581704" title="Excimer laser">
<text>An excimer laser, sometimes more correctly called an exciplex laser, is a form of ultraviolet laser which is commonly used in the production of microelectronic devices, semiconductor based integrated circuits or &quot;chips&quot;, eye surgery, and micromachining.

Since the 1960s, excimer lasers have been widely used in high-resolution photolithography machines, one of the critical technologies required for microelectronic chip manufacturing.

== Terminology and history ==
The term excimer is short for &#x27;excited dimer&#x27;, while &#x27;exciplex&#x27; is short for &#x27;excited complex&#x27;. Most excimer lasers are of the noble gas halide type, for which the term &quot;excimer&quot; is, strictly speaking, a misnomer. (Although less commonly used, the proper term for such is an exciplex laser.)

Excimer laser was proposed in 1960 by Fritz Houtermans. The excimer laser development started with the observation of a nascent spectral line narrowing at 176 nm  reported in 1971 by Nikolai Basov, V. A. Danilychev and Yu. M. Popov, at the Lebedev Physical Institute in Moscow, using liquid xenon dimer (Xe2) excited by an electron beam. Spurred by this report, H.A. Koehler et al. presented a better substantiation of stimulated emission in 1972, using high pressure xenon gas. Definitive evidence of a xenon excimer laser action at 173 nm using a high pressure gas at 12 atmospheres, also pumped by an electron beam, was first presented in March 1973, by Mani Lal Bhaumik of Northrop Corporation, Los Angeles. Strong stimulated emission was observed as the laser&#x27;s spectral line narrowed from a continuum of 15 nm to just 0.25 nm, and the intensity increased a thousand-fold. The laser&#x27;s estimated output of 1 joule was high enough to evaporate part of the mirror coatings, which imprinted its mode pattern. This presentation established the credible potential of developing high power lasers at short wavelengths.

A later improvement was the use of noble gas halides (originally Xe Br) developed by many groups in 1975. These groups include the Avco Everett Research Laboratory, Sandia Laboratories, the Northrop Research and Technology Center, the United States Government&#x27;s Naval Research Laboratory, which also developed a XeCl Laser that was excited using a microwave discharge, and Los Alamos National Laboratory.

== Construction and operation ==
An excimer laser typically uses a combination of a noble gas (argon, krypton, or xenon) and a gas (fluorine or chlorine). Under the appropriate conditions of electrical stimulation and high pressure, a pseudo-molecule called an excimer (or in the case of noble gas halides, exciplex) is created, which can only exist in an energized state and can give rise to laser light in the ultraviolet range.

Laser action in an excimer molecule occurs because it has a bound (associative) excited state, but a repulsive (dissociative) ground state. Noble gases such as xenon and krypton are highly inert and do not usually form chemical compounds. However, when in an excited state (induced by electrical discharge or high-energy electron beams), they can form temporarily bound molecules with themselves (excimer) or with halogens (exciplex) such as fluorine and chlorine. The excited compound can release its excess energy by undergoing spontaneous or stimulated emission, resulting in a strongly repulsive ground state molecule which very quickly (on the order of a picosecond) dissociates back into two unbound atoms. This forms a population inversion.

=== Wavelength determination ===
The wavelength of an excimer laser depends on the molecules used, and is usually in the ultraviolet range of electromagnetic radiation:

Excimer lasers, such as XeF and KrF, can also be made slightly &quot;tunable&quot; using a variety of prism and grating intracavity arrangements.

=== Pulse repetition rate ===

While electron-beam pumped excimer lasers can produce high single energy pulses, they are generally separated by long time periods (many minutes).  An exception was the Electra system, designed for inertial fusion studies, which could produce a burst of 10 pulses each measuring 500 J over a span of 10 s. In contrast, discharge-pumped excimer lasers, also first demonstrated at the Naval Research Laboratory, are able to output a steady stream of pulses. Their significantly higher pulse repetition rates (of order 100 Hz) and smaller footprint made possible the bulk of the applications listed in the following section. A series of industrial lasers were developed at XMR, Inc in Santa Clara, California between 1980 and 1988. Most of the lasers produced were XeCl, and a sustained energy of 1 J per pulse at repetition rates of 300 pulses per second was the standard rating. This laser used a high power thyratron and magnetic switching with corona pre-ionization and was rated for 100 million pulses without major maintenance. The operating gas was a mixture of xenon, HCl, and Neon at approximately 5 atmospheres. Extensive use of stainless steel, nickel plating and solid nickel electrodes was incorporated to reduce corrosion due to the HCl gas. One major problem encountered was degradation of the optical windows due to carbon build-up on the surface of the CaF window. This was due to hydro-chloro-carbons formed from small amounts of carbon in O-rings reacting with the HCl gas. The hydro-chloro-carbons would slowly increase over time and absorbed the laser light, causing a slow reduction in laser energy. In addition these compounds would decompose in the intense laser beam and collect on the window, causing a further reduction in energy. Periodic replacement of laser gas and windows was required at considerable expense. This was significantly improved by use of a gas purification system consisting of a cold trap operating slightly above liquid nitrogen temperature and a metal bellows pump to recirculate the laser gas through the cold trap. The cold trap consisted of a liquid nitrogen reservoir and a heater to raise the temperature slightly, since at 77 K (liquid nitrogen boiling point) the xenon vapor pressure was lower than the required operating pressure in the laser gas mixture. HCl was frozen out in the cold trap, and additional HCl was added to maintain the proper gas ratio. An interesting side effect of this was a slow increase in laser energy over time, attributed to increase in hydrogen partial pressure in the gas mixture caused by slow reaction of chlorine with various metals. As the chlorine reacted, hydrogen was released, increasing the partial pressure. The net result was the same as adding hydrogen to the mixture to increase laser efficiency as reported by T.J. McKee et al.

== Major applications ==
=== Photolithography ===

Since the 1960s the most widespread industrial application of excimer lasers has been in deep-ultraviolet photolithography, a critical technology used in the manufacturing of microelectronic devices. Historically, from the early 1960s through the mid-1980s, mercury-xenon lamps were used in lithography for their spectral lines at 436, 405 and 365 nm wavelengths. However, with the semiconductor industry&#x27;s need for both higher resolution (to produce denser and faster chips) and higher throughput (for lower costs), the lamp-based lithography tools were no longer able to meet the industry&#x27;s requirements. This challenge was overcome when in a pioneering development in 1982, deep-UV excimer laser lithography was proposed and demonstrated at IBM by Kanti Jain. From an even broader scientific and technological perspective, since the invention of the laser in 1960, the development of excimer laser lithography has been highlighted as one of the major milestones in the history of the laser.

Current lithography tools (as of 2021) mostly use deep ultraviolet (DUV) light from the KrF and ArF excimer lasers with wavelengths of 248 and 193 nanometers (called &quot;excimer laser lithography&quot;), which has enabled transistor feature sizes to shrink to 7 nanometers (see below). Excimer laser lithography has thus played a critical role in the continued advance of the so-called Moore&#x27;s law for the last 25 years. By around 2020, extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) has started to replace excimer laser lithography to further improve the resolution of the semiconductor circuits lithography process.

=== Fusion ===
The Naval Research Laboratory built two systems, the Krypton fluoride laser (248 nm) and the Argon fluoride laser (193 nm) to test approaches to prove out Inertial Confinement Fusion approaches. These were the Electra and Nike laser systems. Because the excimer laser is a gas-based system, the laser does not heat up like solid-state systems such as National Ignition Facility and the Omega Laser. Electra demonstrated 90,000 shots in 10 hours; ideal for a Inertial fusion power plant.

=== Medical uses ===
The ultraviolet light from an excimer laser is well absorbed by biological matter and organic compounds. Rather than burning or cutting material, the excimer laser adds enough energy to disrupt the molecular bonds of the surface tissue, which effectively into the air in a tightly controlled manner through ablation rather than burning. Thus excimer lasers have the useful property that they can remove exceptionally fine layers of surface material with almost no heating or change to the remainder of the material which is left intact. These properties make excimer lasers well suited to precision micromachining organic material (including certain polymers and plastics), or delicate surgeries such as LASIK eye surgery. In 1980–1983, Rangaswamy Srinivasan, Samuel Blum and James J. Wynne at IBM&#x27;s T. J. Watson Research Center observed the effect of the ultraviolet excimer laser on biological materials. Intrigued, they investigated further, finding that the laser made clean, precise cuts that would be ideal for delicate surgeries. This resulted in a fundamental patent and Srinivasan, Blum and Wynne were elected to the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2002. In 2012, the team members were honored with National Medal of Technology and Innovation by the President Barack Obama for their work related to the excimer laser. Subsequent work introduced the excimer laser for use in angioplasty. Xenon chloride (308 nm) excimer lasers are also used to treat a variety of dermatological conditions including psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, alopecia areata and leukoderma.

As light sources, excimer lasers are generally large in size, which is a disadvantage in their medical applications, although their sizes are rapidly decreasing with ongoing development.

Research is being conducted to compare differences in safety and effectiveness outcomes between conventional excimer laser refractive surgery and wavefront-guided or wavefront-optimized refractive surgery, as wavefront methods may better correct for higher-order aberrations.

=== Scientific research ===
Excimer lasers are also widely used in numerous fields of scientific research, both as primary sources and, particularly the XeCl laser, as pump sources for tunable dye lasers, mainly to excite laser dyes emitting in the blue-green region of the spectrum. These lasers are also commonly used in pulsed laser deposition systems, where their large fluence, short wavelength and non-continuous beam properties make them ideal for the ablation of a wide range of materials.

<text>The Teaching Company, doing business as &quot;The Great Courses,&quot; formerly Wondrium, is a media production company which produces educational, video, and audio content in the form of courses, documentaries, and series under two content brands: The Great Courses Plus and The Great Courses. The company distributes their content globally through a mix of direct-to-consumer models, such as their streaming service Wondrium.com and TheGreatCourses.com, as well as distribution through third party platforms like the Apple TV app, Audible, Amazon Prime, and Roku.

The Teaching Company, founded by Tom Rollins in 1990, changed its name to The Great Courses and then to Wondrium, It is currently owned by Brentwood Associates PE and is headquartered in Chantilly which is west of Fairfax, Virginia.

== History ==
In 1990, the company was founded by Thomas M. Rollins, former chief counsel of the United States Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. He had been inspired by a 10-hour video-taped lecture series by Irving Younger which he watched to prepare for an exam while at Harvard Law School. He never forgot the series and wanted to share the experience with others. He recruited professors and experts to record lectures, with the first courses covering psychology, political theory, and Shakespeare.

By 2000, the company was well-established, with about $20 million (USD) in annual revenue. In October 2006, the company was acquired by Brentwood Associates, a private equity investment firm. After the acquisition over 6,000 hours of content were digitized, and the number of courses circulated rose from 20 million to 70 million. Sales increased more than 35% the first year and continued to grow at a double-digit pace. The company added indirect distribution channels like Netflix and Audible to their business model in 2013.

The company introduced its online subscription service in 2015 called The Great Courses Plus, which gave consumers streaming access to the majority of The Great Courses content library through a web browser or iOS, Android, Roku, Apple TV, or Fire TV app. A year later, it introduced The Great Courses Signature Collection, a subset of Great Courses content offered as a subscription video service through third party platforms like Comcast, Apple TV, and Roku Channels.

In 2016, the firm earned $150 million in annual revenue. In April 2021, the company announced the rebranding of its global streaming platform from the Great Courses Plus to Wondrium. Along with the rebranding, the company announced 1,000 hours of new content sourced from licensing agreements with Kino Lorber, MagellanTV, and Craftsy. The general reaction to changing the name from The Great Courses to Wondrium was one of contempt. Wondrium has now been returned to The Great Courses Plus.

As of 2021, it included over 7,500 hours of content in the format of documentaries, independent films, docuseries, short-form series, featurettes, courses, and tutorials. There are over 1,200 titles with more than 26,000 lectures.

==Content==
Wondrium produces video and audio content under its two brands: Wondrium and The Great Courses. Both brands focus on educational content with the promise of learning outcomes. The Wondrium line of content, while also educationally focused, focuses on learning experiences outside of the influence of traditional university curriculum and takes other forms of content outside of courses such as documentaries, docuseries, and travelogues. The Great Courses line of content typically features University level experts and professors presenting in-depth learning across multiple lectures. Courses are developed by the experts and the Wondrium production team. Many of the programs&#x27; episodes are around thirty minutes.

The production quality of the courses is &quot;a cut above&quot; free courses offered on YouTube, according to a report in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. President and CEO of Wondrium, Paul Suijk, said that the company is the &quot;Netflix of learning.&quot;

Content covers different subjects and categories such as science, math, economics, literature, language, history, religion, philosophy, fine arts, music, better living, health, wellness, how-to courses, personal enrichment, hobbies and leisure, and travel. The company has partnerships with The Culinary Institute of America, the Smithsonian Institution, the Mayo Clinic, National Geographic, Penguin Random House, &quot;Scientific American&quot;, and others. Self-described fans include Bill Gates and George Lucas, who delivered taped opening remarks to a Great Courses conference in 2015.

=== Professors and experts ===
Most programs are delivered by experts in their respective field. The lectures often involve computer graphics and animations; some offer an optional PDF guidebook to serve as a custom-made textbook for the course.

=== Audio-only titles available through Audible ===
While many Wondrium titles are available through Audible under The Great Courses brand, the company also produces a line of audio-only titles exclusively for the Audible Originals brand. As of 2022, the company has produced over 75 of those titles including:

* &quot;The Life and Times of Beethoven&quot;
* &quot;Falling in Love with Romance Movies&quot;
* &quot;Raising Curious Kids&quot;

==Distribution==

Wondrium distributes and monetizes their content in a number of ways including through direct-to-consumer models and partnerships with third party distributors.

=== Wondrium ===
Wondrium is the company&#x27;s direct-to-consumer subscription streaming service that offers most of what Wondrium and The Great Courses produces as well as additional licensed non-fiction content from select partners. The streaming service is distributed globally. In 2021, it offered about 7,500 hours of content with three pricing options: a monthly plan, a quarterly plan, and an annual plan. It is available on mobile, web, and platforms including Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, iOS, and Android. Wondrium offers both video streaming and audio streaming.

=== The Great Courses Signature Collection ===
The Great Courses Signature Collection is the second streaming subscription service offered by the company that is distributed by third parties, including Comcast, Roku Channels, Amazon Channels, YouTube, and Apple TV, and focuses specifically on The Great Courses line of content. It contains a limited portion of the total count of Wondrium, and The Great Courses produces and releases it relative to the Wondrium streaming service. This collection consists of more than 300 courses on subjects such as philosophy, ancient and modern history, photography, professional development, science and cooking. As of 2024, courses are offered both through a subscription to The Great Courses library and for individual purchase.

=== Audible ===
In 2013, courses were made available through Audible under the Great Courses brand. In 2019, the two companies announced their plan to create new audio-only nonfiction titles. The first three titles were &quot;Conspiracies and Conspiracy Theories: What We Should Believe - and Why&quot;, &quot;Medieval Myths and Mysteries&quot;, and &quot;No Calculator? No Problem!: Mastering Mental Math.&quot;

=== Great Courses (TheGreatCourses.com) ===
The titles are available to purchase digitally, audio or video, or on DVD. Customers can choose from over 1,200 titles in subject categories including the arts, science, literature, self-improvement, history, music, philosophy, theology, economics, mathematics, business, professional advancement, photography, and cooking.

=== True History ===
True History is a Free Ad-Supported Television (FAST) channel and it features over 650 hours of nonfiction programming from Wondrium. It is available through SelectTV (FreeCast) Roku, Xumo, and other services.

=== Wondrium Journeys ===
Wondrium Journeys are immersive vacations &quot;designed to bring the company&#x27;s vast collection of travel courses, videos, documentaries, and series to life.&quot; The first vacation was a 9-day, 8-night trip inspired by the company&#x27;s course &quot;Exploring the Mayan World.&quot; The vacations are usually in Europe.

<text>is a romantic comedy boxing and softball manga by Mitsuru Adachi. It was serialized by Shogakukan in the shōjo manga magazine &quot;Ciao&quot; from September 1986 through March 1991, and collected in seven tankōbon volumes. In 1991, it was adapted as a five-episode OVA. The anime version has some differences from the manga, including the ending.

==Plot==
&quot;Slow Step&quot; is a romantic comedy boxing and softball manga by Mitsuru Adachi. It follows Minatsu Nakazato, a popular high-school girl, as she deals with the unwanted romantic attentions of multiple boys and a teacher. Her plans for evading their pursuits of her grow increasingly convoluted, even involving taking on alternate identities.

==Characters==
: 
: A student at Asaoka High School and pitching ace for the softball club. She is the object of affection of both her classmate Shū Akiba and Coach Yamazakura. As her disguised alter ego Maria Sudō, she evades some local gangsters and is pursued by Naoto Kadomatsu, who lives in the same apartment building. Her father is a lesser-known pro wrestler. She tends to be curt and somewhat rough in her manners. In the anime, she falls for and marries Kango Yamazakura. 
: 
: A boy in the same class as Minatsu and a member of the Asaoka High School boxing club. His father is a company president and he has a light-hearted, somewhat irresponsible personality. He is in love with Minatsu, and in rivalry with Naoto Kadomatsu joins the boxing club, working hard to try to beat him in order to win Minatsu&#x27;s affection.
: 
: A third-year student at Jōsei High School and a member of its boxing club. He lives in the same apartment building as Minatsu but attends a different school, in a different grade. He is a high school boxing champion. He falls in love at first sight with Minatsu&#x27;s alter ego Maria, and becomes Shū&#x27;s rival in boxing and in trying to win Minatsu&#x27;s affections after learning that Maria and Minatsu are the same person.
: 
: A teacher at Asaoka High School and advisor to both the softball and boxing clubs. While in college, he worked toward becoming a professional boxer but gave up this dream after his sister died in order to take care of his sister&#x27;s daughter, Chika. He has a preoccupation with the female behind, and frequently gives unwanted attention to female students at the school. At the end of the anime series, he and Minatsu are married.
: 
: A rough, aloof girl who is the only person who can catch Minatsu&#x27;s pitching. She has a crush on Coach Yamazakura, and manages to date him by agreeing to join the softball club. After she is rejected by Yamazakura, she takes a hiatus from softball but soon returns for the team rather than for Yamazakura. She ends up with new teacher, Somei, who falls for her once she finds out that she is one of the only women who he is not deathly afraid of other than his mother.
: 
: Yamazakura&#x27;s orphaned niece. Even though she&#x27;s an elementary school student, she is very reliable and cooks nearly every meal for Yamazakura. She really likes Minatsu and hopes she and Yamazakura get together eventually.

== Reception ==
In 1995 &quot;Slow Step&quot; was released in the United Kingdom on VHS with English subtitles by the video company &quot;Western Connection&quot;. However, it was commercially unsuccessful.

Helen McCarthy in &quot;500 Essential Anime Movies&quot; calls Mitsuru Adachi &quot;the king of high school romance&quot; and states that the anime &quot;deserves a much bigger audience.&quot;

<text>Diet sodas (also known as sugar-free sodas, zero-calorie sodas, low-calorie sodas or zero-sugar sodas) are soft drinks which contain little or no sugar and/or calories. First introduced onto the market in 1949, diet sodas are typically marketed for those with diabetes or who wish to reduce their sugar or caloric intake.

==History==
Though artificial sweeteners had been known since the discovery of saccharin in 1878, the diet beverage era began in earnest with the 1949 launch of La Casera (also known as Gaseosa) in Madrid, Spain using cyclamate. The product, which belongs now to Suntory Beverage and Food Europe (SBFE), is still on the market. This was followed by the development of No-Cal ginger ale in 1952. Hyman and Morris Kirsch of Kirsch Beverages (Brooklyn, New York) formulated No-Cal for diabetic and otherwise sugar-restricted hospital patients, also using cyclamate calcium to replace the sugar. Recognizing Americans&#x27; growing desire for weight loss, Kirsch began marketing No-Cal to the general public, particularly to women. By 1953, the drink had become popular in New York City and the surrounding region. Canada Dry followed with Canada Dry Glamor in 1954.

In 1958, Royal Crown Cola introduced their own cyclamate and saccharin sweetened dietetic beverage, Diet Rite. Following highly successful trials in Chicago and North Carolina, RC began marketing Diet Rite nationwide for the general public in 1962. It shortly became the 4th-best selling soda in the US, behind only Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and RC Cola itself.

The following year (1963), Dr Pepper released a diet version of its own soft drink, &quot;Dietetic Dr. Pepper&quot; (later renamed to Sugar Free Dr. Pepper, then Diet Dr. Pepper), although it sold slowly due to the misconception that it was meant solely for diabetic consumption. The same year, The Coca-Cola Company joined the diet soft drink market with Tab, followed up by Pepsi with Patio Diet Cola (shortly renamed to Diet Pepsi). Coca-Cola added Fresca in 1966.

All of the above products were originally sweetened with cyclamates and saccharin, which soon proved disastrous. In 1969, an experiment at the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that a cyclamate combination caused bladder cancer in laboratory rats, quickly followed up by another from Abbott Labs (a manufacturer of cyclamate). This finding was quickly accepted in the medical field and by the public as evidence that cyclamate was carcinogenic in humans. Per the Delaney amendment, the FDA immediately announced a ban on cyclamate in food and drink products, to take effect in 1970. Diet sodas were quickly reformulated with saccharin alone (in the hopes that consumers would tolerate the metallic aftertaste), but the market share of diet sodas rapidly fell from 20% to 3% overall. 

After further studies in the 1980s linked saccharin to cancer as well, most manufacturers switched to aspartame in 1983.

By the early 1990s, a wide array of companies had their own diet refreshments on supermarket shelves. Tab made a comeback during the late 1990s after new studies demonstrated that saccharin is not an important factor in the risk of cancer. Nevertheless, The Coca-Cola Company has maintained its 1984 reformulation, replacing some of the saccharin in Tab with NutraSweet.

By 2002, some beverage companies had diversified to include such flavors as vanilla and lemon among their products and diet drinks were soon being produced with those flavors as well (see Diet Vanilla Coke, Diet Pepsi Vanilla). By 2004, several alcohol companies had released sugar-free or &quot;diet&quot; alcoholic products too.

== Sweeteners ==

Several different sweeteners are used to replace sugar in low-calorie diet beverages. The primary compounds worldwide are aspartame, saccharin, sucralose, cyclamates (outside the US), acesulfame potassium (&quot;Ace K&quot;), and stevia.

The ideal goal in artificial sweetening is to replicate the exact taste and texture effects of sucrose with one or more non-caloric sweeteners. Despite decades of research and development, this goal remains elusive. Most sweeteners carry a marked aftertaste, often described as &quot;bitter&quot; or &quot;metallic&quot;. The perception of this aftertaste has been studied intensively, and appears to be based on genetic factors that vary from person to person.

In recent years, rising consumer preference for &quot;natural&quot; products and concern over the possible health effects of artificial sweeteners has spurred demand for stevia-based sweeteners and driven manufacturers to seek novel phytochemicals.

===Aspartame===
Aspartame, commonly known by the brand name NutraSweet, is one of the most commonly used artificial sweeteners. The 1982 introduction of aspartame-sweetened Diet Coke accelerated this trend. Today, at least in the United States, &quot;diet&quot; is nearly synonymous with the use of aspartame in beverages.

Neotame and advantame are further derivatives of aspartame. They received FDA approval in 1998 and 2014 respectively. Due to its high efficiency (20,000 times sucrose) which enables use of minute quantities for sweetening, advantame has the advantage of being safe to consume for individuals with phenylketonuria. As such, products sweetened with it are not required to carry a phenylalanine warning label.

===Cyclamates===
In 1970, the Food and Drug Administration banned cyclamates in the United States based on the results of a study which found that it caused bladder cancer in rats in combination with saccharin. This effect was later revealed to be specific to rodents; neither saccharin nor cyclamate are now considered human carcinogens. Nevertheless, cyclamate remains banned in the US.

===Sucralose and acesulfame potassium; &quot;sugar-free&quot; soft drinks===
Recently, two other sweeteners have been used with increasing frequency: sucralose (marketed as Splenda) and acesulfame potassium (&quot;Sunett&quot; or &quot;Ace K&quot;). The K in &quot;Ace K&quot; represents the chemical symbol for potassium. Acesulfame potassium is usually combined with aspartame, sucralose, or saccharin rather than alone and its use is particularly common among smaller beverage producers (e.g. Big Red). Diet Rite is the non-aspartame diet soft drink brand with the highest sales today; it uses a combination of sucralose and acesulfame potassium.

In the US, sucralose and Ace-K received FDA approval for use in soft drinks in 1998.

Advocates say drinks employing these sweeteners have a more natural sugar-like taste than those made just with aspartame, and do not have a strong aftertaste. The newer aspartame-free drinks can also be safely consumed by phenylketonurics, because they do not contain phenylalanine. Critics say the taste is not better, merely different, or note that the long-term health risks of all or certain artificial sweeteners is unclear.

The widespread, though not universal, agreement that the newest formulations taste much more &quot;normal&quot; (sugar-like) than the older diet soft drinks have prompted some producers, such as Jones Soda, to abandon the &quot;diet&quot; label entirely in favor of &quot;sugar-free&quot;, implying that the taste is good enough to drink even when not trying to lose weight. (This idea was first floated by Diet Coke in 1984, with the tagline, &quot;Just For the Taste of It.&quot;)

In 2005, The Coca-Cola Company announced it would produce a sucralose-containing formulation of Diet Coke known as Diet Coke with Splenda, but that it would continue to produce the aspartame version as well. There were also rumors that a sugar-free version of Coca-Cola Classic, also sweetened with sucralose, was being formulated as well. This formulation was eventually called Coca-Cola Zero, though it is sweetened with aspartame in conjunction with acesulfame potassium.

===Stevia===
Stevia-based sweeteners incorporate steviol glycosides, sweet-tasting compounds produced in the leaves of the &quot;Stevia rebaudiana&quot; plant.

One study investigated the electrochemical properties of stevia rebaudiana, a herb with potential as a glucose sugar alternative. By using a cyclic voltammetric technique with a nano-sensor modified glassy carbon electrode, the limited safety dose was determined as 0.4 mM (28 mg/mL), where the stevia compound acted as an anti-oxidative sweetener. The study also showed that the electrochemical properties of stevia varied in acidic and alkaline pH, with an oxidative behavior in acidic and an anti-oxidative behavior in alkaline solutions.

Initially launched in Argentina in 2013, Coca-Cola Life is made with a mix of stevia and sugar as its sweeteners. Pepsi has also released a variant of their cola sweetened with stevia and sugar, called Pepsi Next.

==Amount of artificial sweeteners in diet soft drinks==
The table below displays milligrams of sweetener and phosphorus in a 12-ounce (≈355 ml) serving of canned soft drink, as provided by the manufacturers in the US market in 2012. Fountain drinks may contain different sweeteners or different amounts of the same sweeteners.

==Health concerns==
Many consumers are concerned about possible health effects of sugar substitutes and caffeine overuse.

Some older reviews and dietetic professionals have concluded that moderate use of non-nutritive sweeteners as a safe replacement for sugars can help limit energy intake and assist with managing blood glucose and weight. 

However, newer and industry-independent studies suggest an association with weight gain and increased diabetes risk. A meta-analysis published in Frontiers in Nutrition observed a significant association between artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs) and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, with a pooled relative risk (RR) of 1.32 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.56). Another study that suggests increased diabetes risk with diet soft drinks was published in 2015 which interestingly suggested a higher risk of diabetes with diet soft drinks compared to sugared soft drinks. While reverse causality could not be excluded, newer studies, for example MESA showed that regular consumption of diet soft drinks is associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, independent of adiposity measures. These results are largely consistent with other research in the field, providing a robust body of evidence for the potential adverse health effects of diet soft drinks.

There are several possible explanations for the counter-intuitive weight gain and increased diabetes risk with the so called diet sodas. Artificial sweeteners may alter the brain&#x27;s response to sweetness, potentially increasing cravings for high-calorie foods. Some research suggests that artificial sweeteners might affect insulin response and metabolism, potentially leading to weight gain

According to the World Health Organization, aspartame, a sweetener found in diet drinks and other food items, may be a potential cancer-causing agent. However, it is still considered safe to consume in moderation.

==Nomenclature==
In countries outside of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, the term &quot;light&quot; is often used instead of &quot;diet&quot;; sometimes, even in countries that do not speak English, the word &quot;light&quot; in English is used (e.g., &quot;Coca-Cola Light&quot; in Spain). The formulation of these is slightly different than the &quot;diet&quot;-named versions and thus the taste is slightly different.

==Reduced-calorie drinks==

In an effort to profit on the surging popularity of low-carbohydrate diets, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo both released reduced-calorie versions of their flagship colas in 2004. The products contain approximately half the sugar of the regular versions. The Pepsi variant, Pepsi Edge, is sweetened with sucralose and corn syrup. The sweetening of the Coca-Cola variant, Coca-Cola C2, is a combination of corn syrup, aspartame, acesulfame potassium and sucralose. Pepsi discontinued Edge in 2005, citing lackluster sales. Coca-Cola soon followed suit. Pepsi then released Pepsi Max in 2012.

Half of the sugar of a can of regular cola still exceeds the daily sugar allowance of some popular low-carbohydrate diets. It is possible that these soft drinks were targeted to so-called &quot;carb-conscious consumers&quot;, who are paying attention to their carbohydrate intake but not trying to drastically reduce it.

==Consumption==
According to a study by the National Center for Health Statistics, about one-fifth of the US population ages 2 years and over consumed diet drinks on a given day in 2009‒2010, and 11% consumed 16 fluid oz. of diet drinks or more. Overall, the percentage consuming diet drinks was higher among females compared with males. The percentage consuming diet drinks was similar for females and males at all ages except among 12- to 19-year-olds, where a higher percentage of females than males consumed diet drinks. A higher percentage of non-Hispanic white people consumed diet drinks compared with non-Hispanic black and Hispanic people. The study included calorie-free and low-calorie versions of soft drinks, fruit drinks, energy drinks, sports drinks, and carbonated water.

==Regulation==
Diet soda is defined in US law as a food of minimal nutritional value.

<text>Oswestry United Football Club was a football club from Shropshire, playing at Victoria Road. The club was formed in September 1893 after the demise of Oswestry Town in 1891. They joined the Shropshire &amp; District League.

The club won the Shropshire Senior Cup in 1899 and 1909, and won the Welsh Cup in 1901 and in 1907.

==Demise==
In September 1914 it was reported that the club had lost five players due to enlistments in World War I, and it was likely that the club would no longer be able to continue in the Lancashire Combination League. By October 1914 the club are shown to have only played two fixtures in the league. 
The club were due to play a Shropshire Cup fixture with Shrewsbury Town in March 1915, but could not raise a team and were later ejected from the competition. 

When football started again after World War I the club did not re-emerge.

A second incarnation of Oswestry Town replaced them as the main club in Oswestry in 1920.

<doc id="581729" wikidata="Q5495215" url="?curid=581729" title="Fred Gaisberg">
<text>Frederick William Gaisberg (1 January 1873 – 2 September 1951) was an American musician, recording engineer and one of the earliest classical music producers for the gramophone. He did not use the term &#x27;producer&#x27;, and was not an impresario like his protégé Walter Legge of EMI or an innovator like John Culshaw of Decca. Gaisberg concentrated on talent-scouting and persuading performers to make recordings for the newly invented Gramophone.

Gaisberg began working in the recording industry in America as a young man, becoming a pioneer of early recording, and also worked as piano accompanist for the Berliner Gram-O-Phone Company, the inventors of the practical lateral-groove disc and associated playback apparatus, the Berliner Gramophone. In 1898, he joined the Gramophone Company in England as its first recording engineer. In 1902, he recorded music sung by the tenor Enrico Caruso and the recordings became a sensation. By 1921, Gaisberg was artistic director of HMV&#x27;s &#x27;international artistes&#x27; department. After 1925, he concentrated on artist management. In 1939, he retired from his position but continued as a consultant in the industry through the 1940s.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Gaisberg was born in Washington, D.C. His father Wilhelm was the son of German immigrants. Gaisberg was educated in Washington and was a chorister at St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church.

A musically talented youngster, he encountered the fledgling recording technology in the early 1890s and got a job working for the Berliner Gram-O-Phone Company in America. Poor sound quality and short playing time, however, meant that recordings were more of an amusing novelty than a serious means of reproducing music. In this decade the first of the recording industry&#x27;s format wars was taking place, with the original cylinder recordings gradually being ousted by the more convenient Berliner flat disc. Gaisberg played an important role in this war, helping to establish 78 revolutions per minute as the standard playing speed and shellac as the standard material for making discs.

===The Gramophone Company and HMV===
In 1898, the Gramophone Company was formed in London. Gaisberg, by then working as piano accompanist and recording supervisor for Emile Berliner, left New York for London to join the Gramophone Company as its first recording engineer. He landed in Liverpool with recording outfit, a bicycle, and introductions and instructions from Berliner. Among his first recordings in London were several made by Syria Lamonte, an Australian singer working at Rules Restaurant in Maiden Lane.

Gaisberg made some of the first recordings of the tenor Enrico Caruso, in Milan on 11 April 1902. The voice recorded well even on the primitive equipment of the time, and the entire enterprise paid off financially as well as artistically. It also sparked a long and happy transatlantic arrangement. In the US the recordings were issued under the label of the Victor Talking Machine Company, spearheading the March 1903 introduction of Victor&#x27;s new premium Red Seal line. Caruso moved to the U.S. later in 1903, and recorded exclusively for Victor the rest of his life. Many of those Victor recordings, issued in the UK under the Gramophone Company&#x27;s label and in continental Europe under the labels of its several sister companies, were even more popular and profitable. Caruso himself said, &quot;My Victor records will be my biography.&quot;

Gaisberg&#x27;s brother William worked with him. They signed up and/or recorded such international stars as Adelina Patti, Francesco Tamagno, Feodor Chaliapin, Beniamino Gigli, Nellie Melba, John McCormack and Fritz Kreisler. Gaisberg was the only record producer to record a castrato singer (Alessandro Moreschi of the Sistine Chapel choir), and the first person to produce recordings in India and Japan. He cut India&#x27;s first gramophone recordings, which featured Gauhar Jaan singing a khayal, on 2 November 1902. These sessions took place in a makeshift studio rigged up in two rooms of a Calcutta hotel. In Japan, he recorded more than 270 titles in one single month of 1903. Gaisberg made a number of trips to pre-Revolutionary Russia, where his recordings helped develop one of recorded music&#x27;s largest early markets. He made the first recordings of the Russian tenor Vladimir Rosing.

Unlike his successors Legge and Culshaw, Gaisberg did not generally regard it as part of his function to influence the way performers performed. He found the best artists he could, signed them up and faithfully captured their performances on disc in the best possible sound available at the time of recording. He told a colleague that he saw his task simply as one of making as many sound photographs or gramophone (78-rpm) disc sides as possible during each recording session.

===Later years===
In 1921, Gaisberg became HMV&#x27;s artistic director in the newly formed &#x27;international artistes&#x27; department. After the introduction of electrical (microphone) recording in 1925, he delegated the role of producer and concentrated on artist-and-repertoire management. He remained as artistic director after the HMV and Columbia firms merged in 1931, creating Electric and Musical Industries (EMI). The recordings made under his supervision include Sir Edward Elgar&#x27;s series of records of his symphonies, concertos and other major works. With Bernard Shaw, the BBC and others, Gaisberg was partly responsible for persuading Elgar to write a third symphony, although he died before he could complete any more than initial sketches. (They were eventually &quot;elaborated&quot; into a symphonic shape by the composer Anthony Payne four decades later.)

Gaisberg refused offers of a directorship at HMV, preferring to remain a link between the artists and the company. At age 66, in 1939, he retired but continued on as a consultant at EMI, exerting considerable influence on the recording industry. In the late 1940s he argued in favour of long-play (LP) records, introduced by Columbia Records in 1948, and stereophonic recording, introduced in 1958 after his death. One of his last projects, in the early 1930s, was to conceive, and supervise the construction of, a major facility for classical recording, Abbey Road Studios.

A banquet was given at the Savoy Hotel to mark his retirement. It was attended by renowned musicians as diverse as Sir Thomas Beecham, Gracie Fields, Richard Tauber and Artur Rubinstein. Gaisberg retained his American citizenship to the end, and was a lifelong bachelor. He died at his home in Hampstead in 1951 at age 78, and was buried in Hampstead Cemetery in West Hampstead.

<text>Telšiai (; Samogitian: &quot;Telšē&quot;) is a city in Lithuania with about 21,499 inhabitants. It is the capital of Telšiai County and Samogitia region, and it is located on the shores of Lake Mastis.

Telšiai is one of the oldest cities in Lithuania, probably dating earlier than the 14th century. Between the 15th and 20th centuries, Telšiai became a district capital. Until 1795, Telšiai County formed the Duchy of Samogitia within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Between 1795 and 1802 it was included in the Vilnius Governorate. In 1873, Telšiai was transferred to the Kovno Governorate.

==Names==
The name Telšiai is a variant of the same Lithuanian language root (&quot;-telš-&quot;, &quot;-tilž-&quot;) as Tilžė or Talsi with the meaning connected to water. The name Telšiai or Telšē in Samogitian dialect of Lithuanian is derived from a verb &quot;telkšoti&quot; (literally, &quot;to be flooded with water&quot;, &quot;to splash&quot;, etc.). It is a cognate to the Greek thalassa - &quot;sea&quot;, compare the river Jūra - &quot;a sea&quot; flowing in the same longitude territory. It may also relate to the sum of 45° longitude of Greenwich as the core of Europe or also all western side or one fourth in the West of The Eastern Hemisphere.

The name of Telšiai has been recorded in different forms and different languages throughout its history. Most of them are derived from &quot;Telšē&quot; in Samogitian dialect. Some foreign names for the city include ; ; ; . In Yiddish, the name is (&quot;Telz&quot;). In English sources, Telšiai are known also by several alternative names, including Telsiai, Telshi and Telschi.

==History==
Lake Mastis is mentioned in various legends and myths. The city was named after a small rivulet, the Telšė, which flows into Lake Mastis. A legend has it that a knight named Džiugas founded the city. First mentions of Telšiai date back to 1398, but the oldest archeological findings in the area of the city are from the Stone Age. In the 15th century, Telšiai already had a state-owned manor. It and the parish were governed by Samogitian elders. Telšiai was at the centre of an uprising of Samogitian peasants.

At the end of the 17th century Telšiai became the centre of culture and politics of Samogitia. Local parliaments known as Sejmiks composed of noblemen were organised in the city and a court was established. Magdeburg rights were granted to Telšiai in the 17th century. Until the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Telšiai County formed the Duchy of Samogitia in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

During the November uprising of 1831 Telšiai became a sanctuary for Polish–Lithuanian partisans fighting the Russians. A revolutionary government of insurrectionists was formed and schools for the preparation of military officers and noncommissioned officers were opened. During the Uprising of 1863, Telšiai was one of the main centres of uprise in Samogitia since insurrectionist forces massed there.

At the end of the 19th century Telšiai started to grow. A team of firemen formed, and a pharmacy and a theater were opened. In 1908 the very first Lithuanian concert–performance was organised. Telšiai was the birthplace and residence of famous Samogitian noble brothers: Stanisław Narutowicz (member of the Council of Lithuania) and Gabriel Narutowicz (the first President of Poland, who was assassinated).

The city survived two Polish revolutions, was conquered by the Germans in World War I, and occupied by the Red Army for a short time in 1918.

During the years of Lithuanian independence, 1918 to 1940, Telšiai grew rapidly. Several girls&#x27; and boys&#x27; high schools, a crafts school and a teacher&#x27;s seminary were established. The Alka museum was built, and several cultural societies were operated. In 1935, Telšiai became the centre of county administration.

During the first Soviet occupation, as a result of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Telšiai became infamous for the nearby Rainiai massacre, a mass murder of 76 Lithuanian political prisoners perpetrated by the Red Army during the night of 24–25 June 1941.
Nowadays Telšiai is the 12th largest city in Lithuania. It is the centre of Telšiai County and Telšiai district municipality. The city has four high schools, four secondary schools, and five primary schools. Department of Vilnius Academy of Art, College of Social Sciences and College of Samogitia are also established in Telšiai.

On 22 January 2013, the Ministry of Culture officially announced that Telšiai will be named the Lithuanian Capital of Culture in 2016.

===Jews in Telšiai===

In 1897, the Jewish population numbered 3088, 51% of the total population. Jews were expelled during World War I, but by 1939, only 2800 had returned, out of a general population of 8000. Many were involved in trade which included produce, wood, and crafts.

A major source of income was the famous Telšiai Yeshiva, (a school for Talmudic study, sometimes called a rabbinical college). It was the largest and most famous yeshiva in Lithuania between 1875 and 1941, establishing Telšiai as a center of Torah studies (the entire body of religious law and learning, including both sacred literature and oral tradition). There was also an Orthodox Jewish rabbinical seminary and a Jewish day school providing secular and religious instruction for younger children.

Following World War I and the expulsion of the Jews—which decimated the Telšiai Jewish community—the city again became a center of traditional Jewish learning. There were also charitable institutions, including a Chevra Kadisha (burial society), a hospital, a loan society, a public kitchen, a clinic, special summer camps, and a women&#x27;s association for support of the sick and poor. There were also two Jewish newspapers, published in Yiddish.

In June 1940, following the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, Russians quickly closed down the yeshiva. Most of the students dispersed with only about a hundred students remaining in Telshe. Learning was done in groups of 20–25 students studying in various &quot;batai medrashim&quot; (&quot;small synagogues&quot;) led by the rosh yeshivas.

The Holocaust in Telšiai (in Yiddish Telz) was carried out by the local Lithuanian leadership with occasional supervision by Nazi German units. The Jewish population in 1939 was 2,800 some 35 percent of the town&#x27;s population. Further Jews found refuge in Telšiai following the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania. Telšiai was conquered by German troops on 25 June 1941. Jews were subjected to terror by the Germans and their Lithuanian collaborators and on 15–16 July all Jewish men were shot. The women were moved to a camp in Geruliai, and with the exception of 500–600 young women, were all shot on 30 August 1941. The 500–600 young women were moved back to a ghetto in Telšiai, and with the exception of some escapees, were shot on 30–31 December 1941. 64 Jewish survived after they escaped.

Telšiai has a rare surviving wooden synagogue.

The original Telšiai yeshiva building still stands. However, during the Soviet occupation it was transformed for industrial purposes and eventually neglected. It was renovated and opened as a Jewish museum in 2023. 

The yeshiva was transplanted to the United States in 1941, during World War II, when two of its roshei yeshiva (&quot;deans&quot;) who had escaped the Holocaust chose to re-establish it in Cleveland, Ohio, where it still remains. The yeshiva was opened in the house of Yitzchak &amp; Sarah Feigenbaum on 20 Cheshvan 5702 (1941). This yeshiva again became a well-respected center of Talmudic study, incorporating the distinct methods of the historic institution, and it is still going strong today.

<text>Ford Duratec engine is a brand name of the Ford of Europe used for the company&#x27;s range of gasoline-powered I3, I4, I5 and V6 passenger car engines. The original 1993 Duratec V6 engine was designed by Ford and Porsche. Ford introduced this engine in the Ford Mondeo. Over time, &quot;Duratec&quot; became an umbrella name for Ford&#x27;s gasoline engines unrelated to the original V6. The Ford Zeta engine, Ford Sigma engine and Ford Cyclone engine all carry the Duratec name, but are otherwise unrelated to each other or the original 1993 Duratec V6. The ambiguous use of the name is similar to Ford&#x27;s use of the Zetec for the previous generation of gasoline engines, the Duratorq name for diesel engines, and EcoBoost for turbocharged gasoline engines.

<text>The 1985 World Snooker Championship final, also known as the black-ball final, was played on the weekend of 1985 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. The final of the 1985 World Snooker Championship was between defending world champion Steve Davis and 1979 runner-up Dennis Taylor. It was Davis&#x27;s fourth appearance in a final and Taylor&#x27;s second. The best-of-35- match was split into four . Davis won every frame in the first session to lead 7–0 but only led 9–7 and 13–11 after the second and third sessions. Until the match was over, Taylor was never ahead in frames but had tied the contest three times at 11–11, 15–15 and 17–17. The culminated in a number of shots on the final . After both players had failed to it several times, Taylor potted the black to win his only world championship. Media outlets reported this as a major shock: Davis had been widely predicted to win the match, having lifted three of the previous four world championship titles.

The final took place during the eighth year of the BBC&#x27;s daily coverage of the championship and reached a climax in the early hours of Monday 29 April. It was viewed by 18.5 million people in the United Kingdom, which remains a record viewing figure for BBC2, and is still the record for a post-midnight audience for any British television channel. The total match time of 14 hours and 50 minutes is the longest ever recorded for a best-of-35-frames match. It is the only final at this venue to contain no century breaks.

The final is one of the most famous matches in snooker history and part of the reason for the surge in the sport&#x27;s popularity in the 1980s and 1990s. Two hour-long BBC documentaries, &quot;When Snooker Ruled the World&quot; from 2002 and &quot;Davis v Taylor: The &#x27;85 Black Ball Final&quot; made in 2010, commemorated the event. The final frame was released in full on home video as &quot;The Greatest Snooker Final of All Time&quot;. The post-match single-word responses to David Vine from Davis would later be used as a basis for a recurring caricature of him in the television show &quot;Spitting Image&quot;.

== Background ==
The World Snooker Championship is a professional snooker tournament first held in 1927 and becoming an annual event in 1969. The 1985 World Snooker Championship final was the culmination of the last world ranking event of the 1984–85 snooker season. The tournament featured a 32-participant main draw, with 16 seeded players and 16 players from a pre-tournament qualification competition. Matches at the event were played over a series of , the final being the best-of-35 frames over four . The final was broadcast on the BBC for the eighth year in a row, with the winner receiving £60,000 (), the highest prize for a snooker event to that date.

===Road to the final===

Steve Davis, ranked as the world number one, overcame Neal Foulds 10–8 in the opening round in what was Davis&#x27;s closest match until the final. He then played David Taylor in the second round, holding at least a three-frame lead throughout much of the match, and eventually won 13–4 after winning seven frames out of eight. Davis trailed for the first time at the event in the quarter-finals, as he played Terry Griffiths. Griffiths won the first four frames, but Davis won the next four to tie the match 4–4. With the scores even, Davis won six of the next eight to lead 10–6 after the second session and eventually won 13–6. In the semi-final, Davis required just three of the four scheduled sessions to overcome Ray Reardon 16–5.

Dennis Taylor, ranked 11, led Silvino Francisco 8–1 in the opening session, and won the match 10–2. In the second round, Taylor played Eddie Charlton where he won 13–6. Taylor played Cliff Thorburn in the quarter-finals, in a match full of slow play. He led 10–5 after an over nine-hour second session, but won the first three frames in the final session to win 13–5. In the semi-final Taylor lost the first two frames against Tony Knowles, but won 16 of the next 19 to win 16–5, the same scoreline as Davis.

==Match report==
The final was played on 27–28 April 1985 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. Davis went into the tournament as the defending champion. The two players had met twelve months earlier in the semi-finals of the 1984 World Championship, Davis winning 16–9, having only lost once to Taylor in nine matches. Davis was competing in his fourth world championship final, having reached the final and won in 1981, 1983 and 1984. Taylor was contesting his second final, having lost to Terry Griffiths 16–24 in 1979. Davis had never lost a prior ranking event final.

Taylor started the 1985 final with a of 50 but lost that frame as Davis gained a firm advantage by his opponent in the first session. Davis also won the first of the second session to lead 8–0. Taylor won the ninth frame on the after Davis missed a pot on the . Davis lost six of the next seven frames, as Taylor produced the highest break of the final, a 98, to trail 7–9 overnight. Davis won two of the first three frames on the second day, to lead 11–8, before Taylor tied the match at 11–11. Davis took both of the next two frames on the to lead 13–11. Taylor won four of the next six and again drew level at 15–15. Davis won the next two frames to regain the lead at 17–15. Taylor then won a closely fought 33rd frame, followed by a 57 break in frame 34, to level the match at 17–17 and force a .

===The final frame===
The 35th frame was the last of the final, and lasted 68 minutes. Davis led 62–44, with only the last four on the table, worth 22 points. Taylor potted the brown ball from much of the length of the table and then the with a slowly played along the bottom cushion into the green pocket. He then sank a difficult into the same pocket from the opposite . This left Taylor trailing 59–62 with only the , worth seven points, remaining.

Taylor attempted a into the left middle . He missed, but the ball rebounded to a position at the top of the table. Davis then played a safety shot, putting the black near the middle of the cushion and leaving the cue ball near the right-hand cushion, a little above the corner pocket. In response, Taylor again attempted to double the black ball, this time into the top-left corner pocket. The black missed but eventually landed above the left middle pocket to a safe position.

Davis&#x27;s next attempt and left Taylor with a middle-distance pot to the green pocket. Taylor missed the pot, which commentator Jim Meadowcroft described as &quot;the biggest shot of his life&quot;. This left Davis a thin cut shot into the top-left corner. He over-cut the black, missed the shot and left the black in a reasonably-straightforward pottable position into the same pocket. Taylor made his way to the table and potted the black to win the match. The final finished at 12:23 a.m. on 29 April 1985.

After potting the ball, Taylor held his above his head and waggled his finger in celebration. He said in a 2009 interview that the gesture was aimed at his &quot;good mate&quot; Trevor East, whom he had told he would win. In a post-match interview with David Vine, Davis commented that the loss was &quot;all there in black and white&quot;, and Taylor commented that the match was the greatest that he had been involved in. Taylor noted the importance of defeating Thorburn, whom he described as the &quot;hardest player in the world&quot;, and Davis, whom he described as the &quot;best player in the world&quot;. Taylor commented that as he had defeated Davis, he was &quot;the best this year&quot;.

==Legacy==
The final is one of the most famous snooker matches of all time. The match holds several records. The final is the longest match ever held over the length of 35 frames at 14 hours and 50 minutes. The concluding moments of the final were watched by 18.5 million viewers, which as of 2020 is the most ever in the United Kingdom for a broadcast after midnight and for any BBC2 programme. Taylor lost in the opening round at the following year&#x27;s event, and Davis lost again in the final to Joe Johnson 12–18. He won the next three championships between 1987 and 1989, winning the event six times in total. Davis and Taylor met on one further occasion, in the quarter-final of the 1991 World Snooker Championship, Davis winning comfortably 13–7. Taylor never reached the final again, but did win the Masters in 1987, again producing a comeback, this time against Alex Higgins.

Taylor&#x27;s mother had died in September 1984, the year prior, so he had dedicated his win at the 1984 Grand Prix in October to her. His win at the world championship he also dedicated to his mother&#x27;s life. On his return to Northern Ireland, Taylor received a victory parade in a Land Rover across his home town of Coalisland in front of 10,000 people. He was loaned mayoral robes on the day of the parade, and was accompanied by his wife and three children. He later signed a five-year contract with promoter Barry Hearn as his manager. The media described Davis as a &quot;bad loser&quot; for his silence and one-word responses to questions from David Vine at a press conference following the event. This was later used as the basis for a recurring caricature of Steve Davis on the television show &quot;Spitting Image&quot;.

Some months after the 1985 World Championship, a special programme was recorded in which both players watched the entire final frame and discussed it shot by shot. For the penultimate shot, where Davis missed the cut into the corner pocket, he stated &quot;I was saying to myself, don&#x27;t hit it thick&quot; and &quot;that&#x27;s how you bottle it, by hitting it thick.&quot; He summarised: &quot;although I missed the black, it wasn&#x27;t that shot which lost the match. There were other shots earlier in the frame.&quot; In particular, Davis mentions how close he was to being able to pot a pink which he suggested changed the course of the match. The programme was later released on DVD as &quot;The Greatest Snooker Final of All Time&quot; by Retro Videos. The black-ball finish was voted the ninth greatest sporting moment of all time in a 2002 Channel 4 poll.

During the 2010 World Championship, Taylor and Davis &#x27;re-created&#x27; the final frame of the 1985 final. Performed in a distinctly irreverent manner, the &quot;rerun&quot; was noticeable for the fact that in attempting to replicate the missed shots on the final black, they instead ended up potting it on all but one attempt. The one attempt on the black they missed was the shot Taylor potted in the 1985 match to win the championship. BBC Two aired a one-hour documentary on the final, &quot;Davis v Taylor: The &#x27;85 Black Ball Final&quot;, presented by Colin Murray, after the conclusion of the coverage of the 2010 final.

==6 cylinder==
Ford was late to offer a six-cylinder engine in their cars, only introducing a six in 1941 after the failure of the 1906 Model K. The company relied on its famous Flathead V8 for most models, only seriously producing six-cylinder engines in the 1960s. The company was also late with a V6 engine, introducing a compact British V6 in 1967 but waiting until the 1980s to move their products to rely on V6 engines. The company has relied on seven major V6 families ever since, the Cologne/Taunus V6, British Essex V6, Canadian Essex V6, Vulcan V6, Mondeo V6, Cyclone V6, and Nano V6. The first five of these lines are no longer in production, leaving only the Cyclone and Nano as the company&#x27;s midrange engines.

Ford introduced the Flathead V8 in their affordable 1932 Model 18, becoming a performance leader for decades. In the 1950s, Ford introduced a three-tier approach to engines, with small, mid-sized, and larger engines aimed at different markets.

<text>The Mitsubishi A7M Reppū (烈風, &quot;Strong Wind&quot;) was designed as the successor to the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s A6M Zero, with development beginning in 1942. Performance objectives were to achieve superior speed, climb, diving, and armament over the Zero, as well as better maneuverability – all parameters that were ultimately achieved towards the end of its development in 1945. However, limitations on Japanese industry towards the end of the war prevented the A7M from ever entering mass production or being deployed for active duty, and it never saw active service. Its Allied reporting name was &quot;Sam&quot;.

==Design and development==
Towards the end of 1940, the Imperial Japanese Navy asked Mitsubishi to start design on a carrier-based fighter, to meet specification &quot;16-Shi&quot; (a designation under a system using regnal years that indicated &quot;1941&quot; – the year in which the specification was formally issued). The fighter would be the successor to the carrier-based Zero. At that time, however, there were no viable high-output, compact engines to use for a new fighter. In addition, Jiro Horikoshi&#x27;s team was preoccupied with addressing early production issues with the A6M2b as well as starting development on the A6M3 and the 14-&quot;Shi&quot; interceptor (which would later become the Mitsubishi J2M &quot;Raiden&quot;, a land-based interceptor built to counter high-altitude bombers). As a result, work on the Zero successor was halted in January 1941.

In April 1942, the development of the A6M3 and the 14-&quot;Shi&quot; interceptor was complete, and the Japanese Navy once again tasked Mitsubishi and Horikoshi&#x27;s team with designing a new Zero successor to become the Navy Experimental 17-&quot;shi Ko&quot; (A) Type Carrier Fighter &quot;Reppu&quot;. In July 1942 the Navy issued specifications for the fighter: it had to fly faster than above , climb to in less than 6 minutes, be armed with two 20 mm cannon and two machine guns, and retain the maneuverability of the A6M3.

As before, one of the main hurdles was engine selection. To meet the specifications the engine would need to produce at least , which narrowed choices down to Nakajima&#x27;s NK9 (Ha-45/Homare), or Mitsubishi&#x27;s MK9 (Ha-43); both engines still being under development. These engines were based on 14-cylinder (Nakajima &quot;Sakae&quot; and Mitsubishi &quot;Kinsei&quot;, respectively) engines converted to 18-cylinder powerplants. The early NK9 had less output but was already approved by the Navy for use on the Yokosuka P1Y &quot;Ginga&quot; bomber, while the larger MK9 promised more horsepower.

With the larger, more powerful engine, wing loading became an issue. The Navy requested at most 150 kg/m2, but wanted 130 kg/m2 which complicated design considerations further. With the NK9 it could achieve 150 kg/m2, but with the less power it would not meet the specifications for maximum speed. With the MK9 the engineers concluded it could fulfill the requirements; however, production of the MK9 was delayed compared to the NK9, and the Japanese Navy instructed Mitsubishi to use the NK9.
Work on the 17-&quot;Shi&quot; was further delayed by factories prioritizing A6M and Mitsubishi G4M medium bomber production as well as further work on A6M variants and addressing &quot;Raiden&quot; issues. As a result, the 17-&quot;Shi&quot;, which became the A7M1, officially flew for the first time on 6 May 1944, four years after development started. The aircraft demonstrated excellent handling and maneuverability, but was underpowered as Mitsubishi engineers feared, and with a top speed similar to the A6M5 Zero. It was a disappointment, and the Navy ordered development to stop on 30 July 1944, but Mitsubishi obtained permission for development to continue using the Ha-43 engine, flying with the completed Ha-43 on 13 October 1944. The A7M2 now achieved a top speed of , while climb and other areas of performance surpassed the Zero, leading the Navy to change its mind and adopt the craft. The A7M2 was also equipped with automatic combat flaps, used earlier on the Kawanishi N1K-J, significantly improving maneuverability.

In June 1945, ace pilot Saburō Sakai was ordered to test the prototype at Nagoya. He was favorably impressed.

==Variants==

; A7M1 &quot;Reppū&quot;
:First prototype powered by a Nakajima Homare 22 engine, with a maximum speed of 574 km/h (356 mph). The armament consisted of two 13.2 mm (.52 in) Type 3 machine guns and two 20 mm (.80 in) Type 99 autocannon in the wings. While featuring excellent manoeuvrability, the A7M1&#x27;s &quot;Homare&quot; engine left it underpowered which resulted in its cancellation. Eight built.
; A7M2 &quot;Reppū&quot;
:Revised version powered by a Mitsubishi Ha-43 engine, with a maximum speed of 627 km/h (389 mph). Armament the same as previous model, or four 20 mm (.80 in) Type 99 autocannon. The A7M2 was to be the main production aircraft of the A7M series. Three were converted from A7M1. One massproduction type under assembling at the end of the war.
; A7M3 &quot;Reppū&quot;
:Proposed land-based fighter version powered by a mechanically driven three-speed supercharged Mitsubishi Ha-43 engine, with a maximum speed of 642 km/h (398 mph). The armament consisted of six 20 mm (.80 in) Type 99 cannons in the wings. Prototype under construction but was incomplete prior to end of war.
; A7M3-J &quot;Reppū-Kai&quot;
:Proposed land-based interceptor version powered by a turbo-supercharged Mitsubishi Ha-43 engine including an inter-cooler, with a maximum speed of 648 km/h (402 mph). The armament consisted of six 30 mm (1.20 in) Type 5 autocannon, four wing-mounted &amp; two oblique fuselage-mounted. Full-scale mock-up built, but no prototype.

==Production==

* Production was disrupted by an earthquake on 7 December 1944 in the Nagoya region, and Allied bombing raids of Nagoya on 11 March 1945, which caused the loss of full scale drawings and jigs for the A7M2 and Ki-83. This ceased the development of the A7M2 and the plane would never see combat.

The USSBS Report identifies nine aircraft (two A7M1 prototypes, seven A7M2 prototypes and service trials aircraft) while Francillon notes the same two A7M1 prototypes, seven A7M2 prototypes and service trials aircraft, but with one A7M2 final production build for a total of 10.

<text>The Ford Duratorq engine, commonly referred to as Duratorq, is the marketing name of a range of Ford diesel engines introduced in 2000. The larger capacity 5-cylinder units use the Power Stroke branding when installed in North American-market vehicles. The first design, codenamed &quot;Puma&quot; during its development, replaced the older Endura-D unit which had been around since 1984. Commercial versions of the Puma unit replaced Ford&#x27;s older &quot;2.5Di&quot; type unit used in the Transit, and many other manufacturers&#x27; vehicles - most notably the London Taxi and in the Land Rover Defender. Other unrelated units in this range have been developed by Ford and PSA. The TDCi Duratorq engines are available in vehicles from Ford, Jaguar, Land Rover, Volvo and Mazda. A new EcoBlue diesel engine range, originally codenamed &quot;Panther&quot; and planned to be available in 2.0- and 1.5-litre variants, will progressively replace the Duratorq engines from 2016.
==Engine reference==
==DLD==
The inline-four engines are sold under the Duratorq TDCi name by Ford, and as the HDi by Citroën and Peugeot. These are part of the DLD family. Mazda also uses the DLD engine in the Mazda2 and the Mazda3, calling it the MZ-CD or CiTD. The Ford/PSA joint-venture for the production of the DLD was announced in September, 1998.

Officially, there are two families of engines in the range:
* The 1.4L is generally non-intercooled
* The 1.5L derived from the 1.6L
* The 1.6 L always intercooled

Ford later added their unrelated 1.8 L DLD-418 engine to the DLD family, though it is properly part of the Ford Endura engine family.

=== 1.4 &quot;Tiger&quot; ===
The Duratorq DLD-414 (or DV4) is a inline-four Turbo–Diesel. Output is at 4500 rpm and at 2000 rpm. This engine was developed in Trémery by Peugeot, as described in the joint-venture agreement with Ford. This engine is built in France, UK and India.

The DV4 is available in two versions:
* One, an 8-valve design, uses a BorgWarner KP35 turbocharger, but no intercooler. This is the same turbocharger as the Renault K9K Diesel. It is Euro III compliant, but received a diesel particulate filter in 2006 to make it Euro IV compliant.
* A second version uses a DOHC 16-valve design, with an intercooled variable-geometry turbocharger. This derivation will no longer be built from 2006, as it will not be able to comply with the Euro IV regulations. It also uses Delphi Automotive&#x27;s DCR1400 common-rail injection system.

===1.5===
In 2012, Ford added the 1.5-litre, closely derived from the 1.6-litre engine. Bore was reduced from 75 to 73.5 mm while the stroke remained unchanged 88.3 mm.

=== 1.6 &quot;Tiger&quot; ===
The DLD-416 (or DV6) is a version also used by Ford, Mazda, Volvo, Mini, Peugeot and Citroën. This particular engine was designed by Peugeot engineers on behalf of PSA and Ford.

=== 1.8 &quot;Lynx&quot; ===
The Duratorq DLD-418 is a intercooled common rail diesel engine. It is completely unrelated to the 1.4/1.6 units, and is a development of Ford&#x27;s 1.8 8v Endura-D engine that saw service through the 1980s and 1990s. However, Ford considers it part of the DLD family, as evidenced by the official &quot;DLD&quot; name.

The Endura-D was heavily revised and updated with a variable-vane turbocharger and a Delphi high-pressure common rail injection system and relaunched in 2001 as the &#x27;DuraTorq TDCi&#x27;, with the original engine being rebadged &#x27;DuraTorq TDDi&#x27;.

This engine, possibly known within Ford as &quot;Kent Diesel&quot;, is the last evolution of the 997 cc petrol engine introduced in the 105E Anglia in 1959.

== ZSD (&quot;Puma&quot;)==
Codenamed Puma during development, these Ford 2.0 L, 2.2 L, and 2.4 L engines are called ZSD. They are produced at the company&#x27;s Dagenham plant in east London.

Note: the 2.5 and 3.0L &quot;W&quot; engines in above table are NOT Puma engines. They are Mazda designed commercial Diesel engines with no commonality to Puma. The &quot;W&quot; engine family is used in the Asia Pacific Ranger and Everest models currently running out.

===2.0===

Released in 2000, to coincide with the launch of the Mk3 Ford Mondeo, the Duratorq ZSD-420 was initially available as a direct injection turbodiesel. Producing and it was a vast improvement over the 1.8 Endura-D powering the Mk2 Mondeo. It featured a 16-valve cylinder head with twin chain driven camshafts and utilised a variable-geometry turbocharger with overboost function.

In late 2001 the engine was fitted with Delphi common rail fuel injection and called the Duratorq TDCi (Turbo Diesel Commonrail injection), with the original unit being renamed the Duratorq TDDi (Turbo Diesel Direct injection). Although generally identical to the original engine, the addition of the common rail system meant power was increased to , with torque rising to . In 2002 the Duratorq TDDi was replaced by a detuned version of the Duratorq TDCi. Producing and , this unit used a fixed geometry turbocharger in place of the variable geometry unit used in the TDDi and TDCi.

With 2005 came another detuned version of the TDCi for the Mondeo. Producing and , this engine was substantially cheaper than other versions and was mainly targeted at fleet buyers.

Applications:
*Ford Transit 2.0 TDDi &amp; TDCi 75, 85, 100 PS(TDDi) 125 (TDCi) (/) (/) (/) (/)
* 2000–2002 Ford Mondeo 2.0 TD &amp; TDDi, and 
* 2001–2007 Ford Mondeo 2.0 TDCi 130, and 
* 2002–2007 Ford Mondeo 2.0 TDCi 115, and 
* 2005–2007 Ford Mondeo 2.0 TDCi 90, and 
* 2003–2009 Jaguar X-Type 2.0d, and DSWDD

===2.2===

In 2004, Ford introduced the Duratorq ZSD-422, a turbodiesel for top-of-the-range versions of the Mondeo and Jaguar X-Type which produced . This is unrelated to the PSA DW12 2.2 unit used in Peugeot and Citroën applications.

Applications:
* 2006-2016 Ford Transit
* 2004–2007 Ford Mondeo 2.2 TDCi 155, and 
* 2004–2009 Jaguar X-Type

Applications:
* 2000-2011 Ford Transit
* 2002-2006 LDV Convoy
* 2002-2006 London Taxi TXII
* 2007-2011 Land Rover Defender

===2.5 (Mazda WLC)===
Introduced for the Thailand-built 2007 Ford Ranger (J97U) is a 2.5 L diesel engine. This truck is a clone of the Mazda B-Series and thus the engine is a Mazda engine. It has a bore and a stroke of . The engine has no commonality to Ford&#x27;s &quot;Puma&quot; engine or VM Motori. It is a development of the IDI Mazda 2.2L normally aspirated, later 2.5L NA and Turbo and later 2.9L NA, with Bosch common-rail direct injection and a variable geometry turbocharger. The WLC engine code is a Mazda engine code, not being changed for use in the Mazda B-Series clone Ford Ranger. It produces @ 3500 rpm and @ 1800 rpm.

===3.0 (Mazda WEC)===
A 3.0L Mazda W-engine similar to the 2.5 is also used in the 2007 Ranger as the top of the range. Displacement is increased with a wider bore of and longer stroke of . It produces @ 3200 rpm and @ 1800 rpm.

The W-engine family remains a Mazda engine and has no commonality to &quot;Puma&quot;

===3.2===
The 3.2 is an inline, 5-cylinder engine used in the Ford Transit, the Ford Ranger (2012–2022), Ford Everest (2015–2022), Mazda BT-50, Troller T4 and the Vivarail D-Train. For the North American-spec Transit, the 3.2L Duratorq is modified to meet American and Canadian emissions standards and is branded as a Power Stroke engine. The 3.2 Power Stroke is rated at and , and the DuratorqTDCi, available in Asia and Europe, has a power rating of at 3,000 rpm and a torque rating at between 1,750 and 2,500 rpm.

== 2005 TDCi (PSA DW Based)==

Continuing the Ford/PSA diesel engine joint-venture, these straight-four engines are sold under the Duratorq TDCi name by Ford, and as the HDi by Citroën and Peugeot. A development of the existing DW10/DW12 engine, the new engines have a traditional belt-driven system, moving away from the chain-driven camshafts of the previous generation (Puma) TDCi engines. Both engines utilise common rail diesel technology and are the result of the fourth phase of the cooperation between PSA and Ford (initiated in 1998).

Both engines utilise all-new, third-generation common rail injection systems. The 2.0 engines utilising a system from Siemens and the 2.2 a system from Bosch. In both systems the injection pressure has been increased to . This higher injection pressure, associated with new piezo-electric injectors in which each nozzle is equipped with seven apertures (instead of five previously), allows the number of injections to be multiplied (potentially up to six per cycle) and ensures meticulous uniformity of the diesel injection spray pattern. As a result of this optimised air/diesel mix, combustion is more complete and more uniform, and therefore reduces emissions at source.

=== 2.0 (PSA DW10 Based)===

Based on the PSA DW10 engine and with a capacity of , this engine was developed by Peugeot engineers in France on behalf of both PSA and Ford Motor Company. Production is currently taking place in France and Skövde in Sweden. The engine was released to Ford models in 2005 Ford Focus, and followed in the 2007 Mk IV Mondeo. It features a 16-valve cylinder head with twin belt driven camshafts (exhaust camshaft connected to cambelt with inlet camshaft indirectly linked via a timing chain) and utilises a variable geometry turbocharger with overboost function. An intercooler is always present, as opposed to some applications of its predecessor.

In the 2005 Focus, engine power output is ; and in the 2007 Mondeo it is offered with or , mated to a manual or 6-speed Aisin TF81 automatic gearbox. In early 2010 this 2.0 unit was updated, as well as the existing version, a new with of torque was added to the range.

<text>Thrust vectoring, also known as thrust vector control (TVC), is the ability of an aircraft, rocket or other vehicle to manipulate the direction of the thrust from its engine(s) or motor(s) to control the attitude or angular velocity of the vehicle.

In rocketry and ballistic missiles that fly outside the atmosphere, aerodynamic control surfaces are ineffective, so thrust vectoring is the primary means of attitude control. Exhaust vanes and gimbaled engines were used in the 1930s by Robert Goddard.

For aircraft, the method was originally envisaged to provide upward vertical thrust as a means to give aircraft vertical (VTOL) or short (STOL) takeoff and landing ability. Subsequently, it was realized that using vectored thrust in combat situations enabled aircraft to perform various maneuvers not available to conventional-engined planes. To perform turns, aircraft that use no thrust vectoring must rely on aerodynamic control surfaces only, such as ailerons or elevator; aircraft with vectoring must still use control surfaces, but to a lesser extent.

In missile literature originating from Russian sources, thrust vectoring is referred to as gas-dynamic steering or gas-dynamic control.

== Methods ==

=== Rockets and ballistic missiles ===

Nominally, the line of action of the thrust vector of a rocket nozzle passes through the vehicle&#x27;s centre of mass, generating zero net torque about the mass centre. It is possible to generate pitch and yaw moments by deflecting the main rocket thrust vector so that it does not pass through the mass centre. Because the line of action is generally oriented nearly parallel to the roll axis, roll control usually requires the use of two or more separately hinged nozzles or a separate system altogether, such as fins, or vanes in the exhaust plume of the rocket engine, deflecting the main thrust. Thrust vector control (TVC) is only possible when the propulsion system is creating thrust; separate mechanisms are required for attitude and flight path control during other stages of flight.

Thrust vectoring can be achieved by four basic means:

* Gimbaled engine(s) or nozzle(s)
* Reactive fluid injection
* Auxiliary &quot;Vernier&quot; thrusters
* Exhaust vanes, also known as jet vanes

====Gimbaled thrust====

Thrust vectoring for many liquid rockets is achieved by gimbaling the whole engine. This involves moving the entire combustion chamber and outer engine bell as on the Titan II&#x27;s twin first-stage motors, or even the entire engine assembly including the related fuel and oxidizer pumps. The Saturn V and the Space Shuttle used gimbaled engines.

A later method developed for solid propellant ballistic missiles achieves thrust vectoring by deflecting only the nozzle of the rocket using electric actuators or hydraulic cylinders. The nozzle is attached to the missile via a ball joint with a hole in the centre, or a flexible seal made of a thermally resistant material, the latter generally requiring more torque and a higher power actuation system. The Trident C4 and D5 systems are controlled via hydraulically actuated nozzle. The STS SRBs used gimbaled nozzles.

====Propellant injection====
Another method of thrust vectoring used on solid propellant ballistic missiles is liquid injection, in which the rocket nozzle is fixed, however a fluid is introduced into the exhaust flow from injectors mounted around the aft end of the missile. If the liquid is injected on only one side of the missile, it modifies that side of the exhaust plume, resulting in different thrust on that side thus an asymmetric net force on the missile. This was the control system used on the Minuteman II and the early SLBMs of the United States Navy.

====Vernier thrusters====
An effect similar to thrust vectoring can be produced with multiple vernier thrusters, small auxiliary combustion chambers which lack their own turbopumps and can gimbal on one axis. These were used on the Atlas and R-7 missiles and are still used on the Soyuz rocket, which is descended from the R-7, but are seldom used on new designs due to their complexity and weight. These are distinct from reaction control system thrusters, which are fixed and independent rocket engines used for maneuvering in space.

====Exhaust vanes====
One of the earliest methods of thrust vectoring in rocket engines was to place vanes in the engine&#x27;s exhaust stream. These exhaust vanes or jet vanes allow the thrust to be deflected without moving any parts of the engine, but reduce the rocket&#x27;s efficiency. They have the benefit of allowing roll control with only a single engine, which nozzle gimbaling does not. The V-2 used graphite exhaust vanes and aerodynamic vanes, as did the Redstone, derived from the V-2. The Sapphire and Nexo rockets of the amateur group Copenhagen Suborbitals provide a modern example of jet vanes. Jet vanes must be made of a refractory material or actively cooled to prevent them from melting. Sapphire used solid copper vanes for copper&#x27;s high heat capacity and thermal conductivity, and Nexo used graphite for its high melting point, but unless actively cooled, jet vanes will undergo significant erosion. This, combined with jet vanes&#x27; inefficiency, mostly precludes their use in new rockets.

=== Tactical missiles and small projectiles ===
Some smaller sized atmospheric tactical missiles, such as the AIM-9X Sidewinder, eschew flight control surfaces and instead use mechanical vanes to deflect rocket motor exhaust to one side.

By using mechanical vanes to deflect the exhaust of the missile&#x27;s rocket motor, a missile can steer itself even shortly after being launched (when the missile is moving slowly, before it has reached a high speed). This is because even though the missile is moving at a low speed, the rocket motor&#x27;s exhaust has a high enough speed to provide sufficient forces on the mechanical vanes. Thus, thrust vectoring can reduce a missile&#x27;s minimum range. For example, anti-tank missiles such as the Eryx and the PARS 3 LR use thrust vectoring for this reason.

Some other projectiles that use thrust-vectoring:
* 9M330
* Strix mortar round uses twelve midsection lateral thruster rockets to provide terminal course corrections
*Advanced Air Defence missile uses jet vanes
* Astra (missile)
* Akash (missile)
* BrahMos
* MPATGM uses jet vanes
* Pralay uses jet vanes
* QRSAM uses jet vanes
* NASM-SR uses jet vanes
* AAM-5
* Barak 8 uses jet vanes
* A-Darter uses jet vanes
* ASRAAM uses jet vanes
* R-73 (missile) uses jet vanes
* HQ-9 uses jet vanes
* PL-10 (ASR) uses jet vanes
* MICA (missile) uses jet vanes
* PARS 3 LR uses jet vanes
* IRIS-T
* Aster missile family combines aerodynamic control and the direct thrust vector control called &quot;PIF-PAF&quot;
* AIM-9X uses four jet vanes inside the exhaust, that move as the fins move.
* 9M96E uses a gas-dynamic control system enables maneuver at altitudes of up to 35km at forces of over 20&quot;g&quot;, which permits engagement of non-strategic ballistic missiles.
* 9K720 Iskander is controlled during the whole flight with gas-dynamic and aerodynamic control surfaces.
* Dongfeng subclasses/JL-2/JL-3 ballistic missiles (allegedly fitted with TVC control) 

=== Aircraft ===

Most currently operational vectored thrust aircraft use turbofans with rotating nozzles or vanes to deflect the exhaust stream. This method allows designs to deflect thrust through as much as 90 degrees relative to the aircraft centreline. If an aircraft uses thrust vectoring for VTOL operations the engine must be sized for vertical lift, rather than normal flight, which results in a weight penalty. Afterburning (or Plenum Chamber Burning, PCB, in the bypass stream) is difficult to incorporate and is impractical for take-off and landing thrust vectoring, because the very hot exhaust can damage runway surfaces. Without afterburning it is hard to reach supersonic flight speeds. A PCB engine, the Bristol Siddeley BS100, was cancelled in 1965.

Tiltrotor aircraft vector thrust via rotating turboprop engine nacelles. The mechanical complexities of this design are quite troublesome, including twisting flexible internal components and driveshaft power transfer between engines. Most current tiltrotor designs feature two rotors in a side-by-side configuration. If such a craft is flown in a way where it enters a vortex ring state, one of the rotors will always enter slightly before the other, causing the aircraft to perform a drastic and unplanned roll.

Thrust vectoring is also used as a control mechanism for airships. An early application was the British Army airship &quot;Delta&quot;, which first flew in 1912. It was later used on HMA (His Majesty&#x27;s Airship) No. 9r, a British rigid airship that first flew in 1916 and the twin 1930s-era U.S. Navy rigid airships USS &quot;Akron&quot; and USS &quot;Macon&quot; that were used as airborne aircraft carriers, and a similar form of thrust vectoring is also particularly valuable today for the control of modern non-rigid airships. In this use, most of the load is usually supported by buoyancy and vectored thrust is used to control the motion of the aircraft. The first airship that used a control system based on pressurized air was Enrico Forlanini&#x27;s &quot;Omnia Dir&quot; in 1930s.

A design for a jet incorporating thrust vectoring was submitted in 1949 to the British Air Ministry by Percy Walwyn; Walwyn&#x27;s drawings are preserved at the National Aerospace Library at Farnborough. Official interest was curtailed when it was realised that the designer was a patient in a mental hospital.

Now being researched, Fluidic Thrust Vectoring (FTV) diverts thrust via secondary fluidic injections. Tests show that air forced into a jet engine exhaust stream can deflect thrust up to 15 degrees. Such nozzles are desirable for their lower mass and cost (up to 50% less), inertia (for faster, stronger control response), complexity (mechanically simpler, fewer or no moving parts or surfaces, less maintenance), and radar cross section for stealth. This will likely be used in many unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs), and 6th generation fighter aircraft.

== Vectoring nozzles ==

Thrust-vectoring flight control (TVFC) is obtained through deflection of the aircraft jets in some or all of the pitch, yaw and roll directions. In the extreme, deflection of the jets in yaw, pitch and roll creates desired forces and moments enabling complete directional control of the aircraft flight path without the implementation of the conventional aerodynamic flight controls (CAFC). TVFC can also be used to hold stationary flight in areas of the flight envelope where the main aerodynamic surfaces are stalled. TVFC includes control of STOVL aircraft during the hover and during the transition between hover and forward speeds below 50 knots where aerodynamic surfaces are ineffective.

When vectored thrust control uses a single propelling jet, as with a single-engined aircraft, the ability to produce rolling moments may not be possible. An example is an afterburning supersonic nozzle where nozzle functions are throat area, exit area, pitch vectoring and yaw vectoring. These functions are controlled by four separate actuators. A simpler variant using only three actuators would not have independent exit area control.

When TVFC is implemented to complement CAFC, agility and safety of the aircraft are maximized. Increased safety may occur in the event of malfunctioning CAFC as a result of battle damage.

To implement TVFC a variety of nozzles both mechanical and fluidic may be applied. This includes convergent and convergent-divergent nozzles that may be fixed or geometrically variable. It also includes variable mechanisms within a fixed nozzle, such as rotating cascades and rotating exit vanes. Within these aircraft nozzles, the geometry itself may vary from two-dimensional (2-D) to axisymmetric or elliptic. The number of nozzles on a given aircraft to achieve TVFC can vary from one on a CTOL aircraft to a minimum of four in the case of STOVL aircraft.

; Converging nozzle: Generally used on subsonic and transonic jet aircraft where npr &lt; 3. The engine exhaust is expanded through a converging section to achieve Mach 1 at the exit plane, or less at low npr.
; Effective Vectoring Angle: The average angle of deflection of the jet stream centreline at any given moment in time.
; Fixed nozzle: A thrust-vectoring nozzle of invariant geometry or one of variant geometry maintaining a constant geometric area ratio, during vectoring. This will also be referred to as a civil aircraft nozzle and represents the nozzle thrust vectoring control applicable to passenger, transport, cargo and other subsonic aircraft.
; Fluidic thrust vectoring: The manipulation or control of the exhaust flow with the use of a secondary air source, typically bleed air from the engine compressor or fan.
; Geometric vectoring angle: Geometric centreline of the nozzle during vectoring. For those nozzles vectored at the geometric throat and beyond, this can differ considerably from the effective vectoring angle.
; Three-bearing swivel duct nozzle (3BSD): Three angled segments of engine exhaust duct rotate relative to one another about duct centreline to produce nozzle thrust axis pitch and yaw.
; Three-dimensional (3-D): Nozzles with multi-axis or pitch and yaw control.
; Thrust vectoring (TV): The deflection of the jet away from the body-axis through the implementation of a flexible nozzle, flaps, paddles, auxiliary fluid mechanics or similar methods.
; Thrust-vectoring flight control (TVFC): Pitch, yaw-pitch, yaw-pitch-roll, or any other combination of aircraft control through deflection of thrust generally issuing from an air-breathing turbofan engine.
; Two-dimensional (2-D): Nozzles with square or rectangular exits. In addition to the geometrical shape 2-D can also refer to the degree-of-freedom (DOF) controlled which is single axis, or pitch-only, in which case round nozzles are included.
; Two-dimensional converging-diverging (2-D C-D): Square, rectangular, or round supersonic nozzles on fighter aircraft with pitch-only control.
; Variable nozzle: A thrust-vectoring nozzle of variable geometry maintaining a constant, or allowing a variable, effective nozzle area ratio, during vectoring. This will also be referred to as a military aircraft nozzle as it represents the nozzle thrust vectoring control applicable to fighter and other supersonic aircraft with afterburning. The convergent section may be fully controlled with the divergent section following a pre-determined relationship to the convergent throat area. Alternatively, the throat area and the exit area may be controlled independently, to allow the divergent section to match the exact flight condition.

=== Methods of nozzle control ===

; Geometric area ratios: Maintaining a fixed geometric area ratio from the throat to the exit during vectoring. The effective throat is constricted as the vectoring angle increases.
; Effective area ratios: Maintaining a fixed effective area ratio from the throat to the exit during vectoring. The geometric throat is opened as the vectoring angle increases.
; Differential area ratios: Maximizing nozzle expansion efficiency generally through predicting the optimal effective area as a function of the mass flow rate.

=== Methods of thrust vectoring ===

; Type I: Nozzles whose baseframe mechanically is rotated before the geometrical throat.
; Type II: Nozzles whose baseframe is mechanically rotated at the geometrical throat.
; Type III: Nozzles whose baseframe is not rotated. Rather, the addition of mechanical deflection post-exit vanes or paddles enables jet deflection.
; Type IV: Jet deflection through counter-flowing or co-flowing (by shock-vector control or throat shifting) auxiliary jet streams. Fluid-based jet deflection using secondary fluidic injection.
; &quot;Additional type&quot;: Nozzles whose upstream exhaust duct consists of wedge-shaped segments which rotate relative to each other about the duct centreline.

== Operational examples ==
===Aircraft===
An example of 2D thrust vectoring is the Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine used in the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, as well as in the AV-8B Harrier II variant.
Widespread use of thrust vectoring for enhanced maneuverability in Western production-model fighter aircraft didn&#x27;t occur until the deployment of the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor fifth-generation jet fighter in 2005, with its afterburning, 2D thrust-vectoring Pratt &amp; Whitney F119 turbofan.

While the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II uses a conventional afterburning turbofan (Pratt &amp; Whitney F135) to facilitate supersonic operation, its F-35B variant, developed for joint usage by the US Marine Corps, Royal Air Force, Royal Navy, and Italian Navy, also incorporates a vertically mounted, low-pressure shaft-driven remote fan, which is driven through a clutch during landing from the engine. Both the exhaust from this fan and the main engine&#x27;s fan are deflected by thrust vectoring nozzles, to provide the appropriate combination of lift and propulsive thrust. It is not conceived for enhanced maneuverability in combat, only for VTOL operation, and the F-35A and F-35C do not use thrust vectoring at all.

The Sukhoi Su-30MKI, produced by India under licence at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, is in active service with the Indian Air Force. The TVC makes the aircraft highly maneuverable, capable of near-zero airspeed at high angles of attack without stalling, and dynamic aerobatics at low speeds. The Su-30MKI is powered by two Al-31FP afterburning turbofans. The TVC nozzles of the MKI are mounted 32 degrees outward to longitudinal engine axis (i.e. in the horizontal plane) and can be deflected ±15 degrees in the vertical plane. This produces a corkscrew effect, greatly enhancing the turning capability of the aircraft.

A few computerized studies add thrust vectoring to extant passenger airliners, like the Boeing 727 and 747, to prevent catastrophic failures, while the experimental X-48C may be jet-steered in the future.

===Other===
Examples of rockets and missiles which use thrust vectoring include both large systems such as the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB), S-300P (SA-10) surface-to-air missile, UGM-27 Polaris nuclear ballistic missile and RT-23 (SS-24) ballistic missile and smaller battlefield weapons such as Swingfire.

The principles of air thrust vectoring have been recently adapted to military sea applications in the form of fast water-jet steering that provide super-agility. Examples are the fast patrol boat Dvora Mk-III, the Hamina class missile boat and the US Navy&#x27;s Littoral combat ships.

<text>Stepan Plyushkin () is a fictional character in Nikolai Gogol&#x27;s novel &quot;Dead Souls&quot;. He is a landowner who obsessively collects and saves everything he finds, to the point that when he wants to celebrate a deal with the protagonist Chichikov, he orders one of his serfs to find a cake that a visitor brought several years ago, scrape off the mold, and bring it to them. At the same time, his estate is incredibly inefficient; the cut wheat rots on the ground and any potential income is lost. 

His surname is derived from the Russian word for flat bun pastry ().

== Background ==

Plyushkin had two daughters and a son, but upon the death of his wife he became a suspicious miser. The younger daughter died and the other two siblings left home. When his daughter Aleksandra Stepanovna visited him several times with gifts and grandchildren, but received no money in return, she stopped visiting. When Chichikov meets Plyushkin, he mistakes him for the steward due to his ignoble dress.

== Plyushkin syndrome ==

Today in Russia, the name &quot;Plyushkin&quot; is semi-humorously applied to people who collect and amass various useless things, a behavior known as compulsive hoarding. Sometimes the terms &quot;Plyushkin symptom&quot; or &quot;Plyushkin syndrome&quot; are used to describe such people,and &quot;Plyushkin&quot; is used as a colloquial metonymic reference to .

<text>The Countryside Party was a minor political party operating in the United Kingdom. It was formed on 22 May 2000 by Jim Crawford, a chiropodist and sport shooter who was the Northern Director of the Countryside Alliance. Much of the party&#x27;s agenda was the same as that of the Alliance, such as opposition to any restrictions on fox hunting. The party stood unsuccessfully in elections for the UK, Scottish and European parliaments in the early 2000s.

== Platform and membership ==
It was formed out of what it perceived as a lack of understanding or care about rural issues by the mainstream political parties. It was by and large a conservative-minded organisation, and unsuccessfully opposed measures such as the Scottish Land Reform Act which had been designed to give greater rights to tenant farmers and crofters.

According to its 2004 accounts, the party&#x27;s membership was formally &quot;limited to the two founders, Jim Crawford and Richard Malbon plus a very small number of supporters who are not actually members of the Party&quot;.

== Electoral history ==
Crawford contested Ross, Skye and Inverness West, then held by the Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy, for the Countryside Party in the 2001 UK general election. He did not win the seat and achieved less than 1% of the vote.

The Countryside Party stood in the Scottish Parliament 2003 election for the Highlands and Islands electoral region. It polled 1,768 votes (1.05% of the vote in the area).

It contested the 2004 European elections in the South West England and North West England constituencies. In the Southwest, it received 2.1% of the vote which was sufficient to retain its deposit. In the Northwest, it polled only 0.5%. Its relatively good standing in the Southwest may owe something to the notability of its candidates for reasons other than politics. The party&#x27;s six candidates in the region included Chris Thomas-Everard, whose family became famous during the 2001 foot and mouth crisis for refusing to allow his cows to be culled, Diana Scott, joint master of the Devon and Somerset hunt and a prominent pro-hunting campaigner and the explorer Ranulph Fiennes.

The party was deregistered in July 2008. Crawford, who was later elected as a member of The Highland Council for Inverness South, suggested in 2012 that the party could be reformed to oppose wind farm development. He died in 2020.

<doc id="581762" wikidata="Q631908" url="?curid=581762" title="Franklin Dam controversy">
<text>The Gordon-below-Franklin Dam (or simply Franklin Dam) project was a proposed dam on the Gordon River in Tasmania, Australia, that was never constructed. The movement that eventually led to the project&#x27;s cancellation became one of the most significant environmental campaigns in Australian history.

The dam was proposed for the purpose of generating hydroelectricity. The resulting new electricity generation capacity would have been . The proposed construction would have subsequently impacted upon the environmentally sensitive Franklin River, which joins with the Gordon river nearby. During the campaign against the dam, both areas were listed on the UNESCO World Heritage Area register.

The campaign that followed led to the consolidation of the small green movement that had been born out of a campaign against the building of three dams on Lake Pedder in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Over the five years between the announcement of the dam proposal in 1978 and the axing of the plans in 1983, there was vigorous debate between the pro- and anti-dam lobbies, with large protests from both sides.

In December 1982, the dam site was occupied by protesters, leading to widespread arrests and greater publicity. The dispute became a federal issue the following March, when a campaign in the national print media, assisted by the pictures of photographer Peter Dombrovskis, helped bring down the government of Malcolm Fraser at the 1983 election. The new government, under Bob Hawke, had promised to stop the dam from being built. A legal battle between the federal government and Tasmanian Government followed, resulting in a landmark High Court ruling in the federal government&#x27;s favour.

== Announcement of the plans ==
In 1978, the Tasmanian Hydro Electric Commission (HEC) announced intentions to construct the dam. The original proposal was for two dams:
*Gordon below Franklin Dam high, located at . This was the lowest point on the river possible for a dam, since the tidal zone extends to further downstream.
*Dam #2 high, located at . Accessed by the Mount McCall Track (Franklin River Road).

The idea polarised the Tasmanian community. It gained support from some sections of the community for generating jobs in an area of the state that was struggling economically. It was suggested that the construction of the dam would assist in bringing industry to Tasmania, on top of the jobs that it would create directly. The initial opinion polls showed around 70% support for the dam.

However, the protest movement which had gathered to fight the construction of the Lake Pedder Dam earlier in the 1970s began to reassemble in response to the announcement. The Tasmanian Wilderness Society which had formed from the anti-Lake Pedder Dam and South West Tasmania action groups, the Tasmanian Conservation Trust, and the Australian Conservation Foundation began to mount a public interest campaign concerning the river. The photographs of Dombrovskis and his colleague, Olegas Truchanas, attracted significant attention. The campaign generated 30,000 letters of support in a fortnight. A film, &quot;The Last Wild River&quot;, was shown on Tasmania&#x27;s two commercial television stations.

In June 1980, an estimated 10,000 people marched through the streets of Hobart, demanding that the government not proceed with construction. This was the largest rally in the history of the state.

== Attempts at compromise ==
The Labor state government, under premier Doug Lowe, backed down from the original proposal, and agreed to place the Franklin River in a new Wild Rivers National Park. Instead of the original &#x27;Gordon below Franklin&#x27; proposal, Lowe now backed an alternative, the &#x27;Gordon above Olga&#x27; scheme. While this was above the Gordon&#x27;s junction with the Franklin, it still would have intruded into wilderness quality areas. This compromise did not appease the environmental groups, who maintained a policy of no dams in southwest Tasmania.

In July, both the pro-dam and anti-dam groups (the former of which also included the union movement) initiated an advertising blitz in Tasmania. The HEC claimed that up to 10,000 potential jobs would be lost if the dam was not built. The conservative-dominated Legislative Council then blocked the Labor government&#x27;s &#x27;Gordon-above-Olga&#x27; compromise, instead insisting that they proceed with the original proposal. The two parties could not agree on a solution, which led to a deadlock between the two houses of parliament.

==Inquiry, referendum, and Tasmanian state election==
In 1981, Australian Democrats Senator Don Chipp initiated a Senate inquiry into &quot;the natural values of south-west Tasmania to Australia and the world&quot; and &quot;the federal responsibility in assisting Tasmania to preserve its wilderness areas of national and international importance&quot;.

From early 1981, archaeologists uncovered evidence of human habitation dating from about 15,000 years before present in caves which would be flooded if the dam were to be built. The most significant cave had been rediscovered by geomorphology student Kevin Kieran in January 1977, and he first named it Fraser Cave after the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, because &quot;...we were trying to direct the attention of politicians to the area...&quot;&#x27;. It was renamed Kutikina in mid-1982, as suggested by the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre. Kiernan and a group of cavers (speleologists) found over 100 caves in the region.

Concerns also began to be raised about habitat loss for endangered species.

On 12 December 1981, the state government held a referendum, the &quot;Power Referendum 1981&quot;, in an attempt to break the deadlock. The referendum gave voters only two choices, one for each dam proposal. In rounded figures, 47% voted in favour of the original Gordon below Franklin scheme, 8% for the compromise Gordon above Olga scheme, and 45% voted informally. There had been a significant campaign for voters to write &quot;No Dams&quot; on their ballot papers, and in total more than 33% of voters did this; these were initially all counted in the informal vote, but some were later recounted as formal as they also included a valid vote for one of the two dam options.

The ongoing crisis resulted in the replacement of Lowe as premier by Harry Holgate, a Labor politician who was markedly more supportive of the dam proposals. In response, both Lowe and Mary Willey, another Labor MP, resigned from the party and sat in the parliament as independents. This resulted in the loss of a Labor majority in the lower house. Norm Sanders, an Australian Democrats MP and anti-dam campaigner, moved a no-confidence motion, and a state election was called for 15 May.

In May 1982 the Holgate Labor government was defeated by the strongly pro-dam Liberal Party under Robin Gray. The new Premier immediately ordered the original plan to go ahead and passed the necessary legislation. Gray attempted to dissuade the federal government from intervening by threatening to secede from the Commonwealth if they did so. The federal government initially declined to intervene in the dispute.

== The campaigns broadens ==
During 1982, active membership of anti-dam organisations increased a hundredfold in mainland states. The iconic &quot;No Dams&quot; triangle sticker was printed. Rallies and events were held in cities around Australia. Bob Brown toured the country raising support for the anti-dam campaign, attempting to convince Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser to intervene and override the state legislation allowing the dam&#x27;s construction. British botanist and TV presenter Professor David Bellamy addressed 5,000 people at a Melbourne rally.

By the end of 1982, any perception that &quot;greenies&quot; equated with hippies had been greatly challenged, for example in Sydney, Bob Brown and Bellamy addressed 500 people at a candle-lit dinner serenaded by string quartet, ABC&#x27;s classical music radio station featured a &quot;Concert for the Franklin&quot;, and electronics entrepreneur Dick Smith committed to civil disobedience. Many people who had not previously considered conservation issues decided that wilderness was a vote-worthy issue, as evidenced by the following ballot paper write-in campaigns.

In the federal Lowe by-election in Sydney, March 1982, volunteers at every polling booth encouraged voters to write &quot;No Dams&quot; on their ballot paper, and 9% did so. At that first &#x27;Write-in&#x27; campaign, few people knew that they could write a message on their federal ballot paper without invalidating their vote. In the ACT House of Assembly mid-1982 election, up to 40% of voters wrote &quot;No Dams&quot; on their ballot paper. In the federal Flinders by-election in Victoria in December 1982, 40% of voters wrote &quot;No Dams&quot; on their ballot papers.

== Blockade ==

In November 1982, the conflict stepped up a notch when Brown announced that a blockade of the dam site would begin on 14 December. On the same day, the UNESCO committee in Paris was due to list the Tasmanian wild rivers as a World Heritage site. The blockade, at &quot;Warners Landing&quot; () drew an estimated 2,500 people, from not only Tasmania, but also from interstate and overseas. This resulted in the subsequent proclamation of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, which covered both the Franklin and Gordon Rivers. However, Tasmania itself was still divided, with a pro-dam rally in Hobart also attracting around 2,500 people. While the blockade was ongoing, Norm Sanders resigned from the Tasmanian House of Assembly to contest a seat in the Australian Senate. He was replaced in the Assembly by Bob Brown, who had only been released from jail the previous day after spending nineteen days behind bars for his role in the blockade.

Throughout January 1983 around fifty people arrived at the blockade each day. The state government made things difficult for the protesters, passing several laws and enforcing special bail conditions for those arrested. Bulldozers were unloaded at the site from a barge under the protection of police. A total of 1,217 arrests were made, many simply for being present at the blockade. Protesters impeded machinery and occupied sites associated with the construction work. Nearly 500 people were imprisoned for breaking the terms of their bail. This caused an overflow of prisons in the region. British botanist David Bellamy was jailed, which gave the dispute international attention. The author John Marsden, after being arrested at the blockade, was placed in the maximum security division of Risdon Prison for a week as there was nowhere else to hold him.

In February, a Hobart rally against the dam drew approximately 20,000 people. On 1 March, the movement launched a day of action, which they labelled &#x27;G-Day&#x27;. 231 people were arrested as a flotilla of boats took to the Gordon River. In Hobart, the Wilderness Society flag was flown above the HEC building.

On 2 March the Wilderness Society backed the publication of what were then rare full-page colour advertisements in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;The Age&quot; newspapers of what would soon become an iconic photograph: &quot;Morning Mist, Rock Island Bend, Franklin River&quot; by Peter Dombrovskis. It was accompanied by the caption &quot;Could you vote for a party that will destroy this?&quot;.

Folk rock singer Shane Howard from the band Goanna wrote &quot;Let the Franklin Flow&quot;, and released it in April 1983. It was performed by members of his band and members of folk band Redgum under the pseudonym, Gordon Franklin &amp; the Wilderness Ensemble. It was released as a single with a B-side, &quot;Franklin River – World Heritage&quot;, written and recorded by Bob Brown.

==Resolution==
On 5 March 1983, the Australian Labor Party won the federal election with a large swing. The new prime minister, Bob Hawke, had vowed to stop the dam from being built, and the anti-dam vote increased Hawke&#x27;s majority - some federal Victorian seats were notable for having a strong interest in the issue. However, in Tasmania, the vote went against the national trend and the Liberals held all five seats. Hawke&#x27;s government first passed regulations under the existing &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act&quot; 1975, and then passed the &quot;World Heritage Properties Conservation Act&quot; 1983, which prohibited Franklin River dam-related clearing, excavation and building activities that had been authorised by Tasmanian state legislation.

However, the Tasmanian government ignored both the federal regulations and legislation and continued to order work on the dam. In April 1983 the Australian Government sent a Mirage jet and later an RF-111, from the Royal Australian Air Force, to undertake a reconnaissance mission over the dam to gather evidence that the Tasmanian Government was not complying with Federal legislation to stop work.

The issue was brought before the High Court with the first day of hearings on 31 May 1983. The government of Tasmania claimed that the federal government had no powers under the Constitution to pass either the regulations or the legislation. They claimed that as the right to legislate for the environment was not named in the Constitution, and was thus a residual power held by the states, that the &quot;World Heritage Properties Conservation Act&quot; 1983 was unconstitutional. The federal government, however, claimed (successfully) that they had the right to do so, under the &#x27;external affairs&#x27; provision of the Constitution as, by passing legislation blocking the dam&#x27;s construction, they were fulfilling their responsibilities under an international treaty (the UNESCO &quot;Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage&quot;, Australia having signed and ratified that convention and the Franklin River having been listed on it). The Commonwealth government also argued (successfully) that the federal legislation was supported by the constitutional powers of a federal government to pass laws about corporations and about the people of any race (in this case the aboriginal race, whose sacred caves along the Franklin would have been inundated).

The resulting court case became known as Commonwealth v Tasmania. On 1 July 1983, in a landmark decision, the High Court on circuit in Brisbane ruled by a vote of 4 to 3 in the federal government&#x27;s favour. Judges Mason, Murphy, Brennan and Deane were in the majority and justices Wilson and Dawson with Chief Justice Gibbs were in the minority. This ruling gave the federal government the power to legislate on any issue if necessary to enforce an international treaty and has been the subject of controversy ever since. Justice Lionel Murphy wrote most broadly of the Franklin Dam decision&#x27;s broader environmental and social implications in terms of the UNESCO Convention&#x27;s common heritage of humanity principle, stating that &quot;The preservation of the world&#x27;s heritage must not be looked at in isolation but as part of the co-operation between nations which is calculated to achieve intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind and so reinforce the bonds between people which promote peace and displace those of narrow nationalism and alienation which promote war...[t]he encouragement of people to think internationally, to regard the culture of their own country as part of world culture, to conceive a physical, spiritual and intellectual world heritage, is important in the endeavour to avoid the destruction of humanity.&quot; The High Court ruling ended the dam&#x27;s construction, and the plans have never been revived.

On 5 July 1983, a Huon Pine known as the Lea Tree, over 2000 years old and about 9 feet (3 metres) across was chainsawed and set alight. Three people who are thought to be the perpetrators were photographed with the tree in the background. This photograph also shows graffiti containing expletives, which appears to be directed against environmentists on the tree. This was likely done by people who were angry that the project was cancelled.

However, dam-building by the Hydro was not finished. The corporation was still able to construct a &#x27;compromise&#x27; power development scheme on the nearby King River and Henty River to compensate for the loss of the potential power generation from the Franklin scheme. Further on in time, the West Coast Wilderness Railway - the reconstruction of the old Mount Lyell Abt Railway between Queenstown and Regatta point, was mainly financed by compensation funds allocated to the Tasmanian Government for the &quot;loss&quot; of the Franklin River or Gordon River dams.
