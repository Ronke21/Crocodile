<text>The Henschel Hs 126 was a twin-seat parasol wing reconnaissance and observation aircraft designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Henschel.

The Hs 126 that was derived from the Henschel Hs 122. The pilot was seated in a protected cockpit under the parasol wing and the gunner in an open rear cockpit. In the autumn of 1936, the first prototype made its maiden flight; it was soon followed by two more prototypes and a batch of pre-production aircraft. During early 1938, the Hs 126 underwent service evaluation; it was well received for its good short takeoff performance and low-speed flight characteristics, attributes that proved to be frequently useful during its operational history.

The Hs 126 saw combat on numerous fronts, the first occasion being with the &quot;Legion Condor&quot; contingent that participated in the Spanish Civil War during the late 1930s. It was active on numerous fronts of the Second World War, by which point it had become the principal short-range reconnaissance aircraft of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. Large numbers of Hs 126s flew during the Invasion of Poland, the Battle of France, and the Invasion of the Soviet Union. On 12 September 1943, a number of Hs 126s were used to tow ten DFS 230 attack gliders from Pratica Di Mare airfield near Rome to the Gran Sasso on a raid to rescue Benito Mussolini. The Royal Hellenic Air Force also operated 16 Hs 126s, which saw action during the Greco-Italian War. It was withdrawn from &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; service in 1943, by which point the Hs 126 had been superseded by the Fieseler Fi 156 Storch, a general-purpose STOL aircraft, as well as the twin-boom Focke-Wulf Fw 189 Uhu.

==Design and development==
The origins of the Hs 126 that was derived from the Henschel Hs 122, which did not advance beyond pre-production after flight testing demonstrated the type to offer no meaningful improvement over the existing Heinkel He 46. During 1936, Heinkel&#x27;s chief designer, Friedrich Nicolaus, commenced work on a more advanced version of the Hs 122; this was later redesignated as the Hs 126. While it retained the same basic configuration of the Hs 122, however, it differed by its redesigned parasol wing, cantilever undercarriage, and a semi-enclosed cockpit. The Hs 126 also featured all-metal stressed skin construction.

In the autumn of 1936, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight, powered by a single Junkers Jumo 210 V12 engine. The first prototype was not entirely up to &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. Early flights were made without the cockpit cover. Both the second and third prototypes were powered by the Bramo 323 radial engine; the former was fitted with a supercharger, an enlarged rudder, and twin tailplane bracing struts.

By the end of 1937, a pre-production batch of HS 126A-0s had been completed; these were broadly similar to the third prototype. The first production standard Hs 126A-1s came of Henschel&#x27;s production line in early 1938; this model differed from the pre-production aircraft mainly in terms of their fitout, being powered by a BMW 132Dc radial and equipped with a single fixed Zeiss camera in the rear fuselage bay as well as provisions for armaments, including a pair of machine guns and a Hardpoint#Bomb_rack. During early 1938, several Hs 126s were delivered to the reconniassance Lehrgruppe for service evaluation. During these evaluation flight, it was determined that the type possessed favourable flying characteristics and extremely good short-field performance.

During mid 1939, the improved Hs 126B-1 commenced production; this variant was powered by a Bramo 323 radial and accordingly possessed greater performance when flown at high altitudes along with improved short-field performance, as well as VHF radio apparatus. A total of 257 Hs 126s had been delivered to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; by the start of the Second World War. Production of the Hs 126 was terminated during January 1941.

==Operational history==
By the time the Hs 126 A-1 was introduced to service with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in 1938, the re-equipping of reconnaissance formations was already well advanced. The majority of aircraft operated by its short-range reconnaissance units comprised the Heinkel He 45 and Heinkel He 46; in comparison to the Hs 126, both of these aircraft were slower, more vulnerable to ground fire and inclement weather conditions alike, and had limited altitude capability. Accordingly, the Hs 126 had almost entirely replaced both of these aircraft in &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; service by May 1940.

During late 1938, six Hs 126s were dispatched to Spain, where it replaced the He 45s being flown by the &quot;Legion Condor&quot;; it saw live combat during the latter portion of the Spanish Civil War. The type&#x27;s performance in this theatre was reportedly satisfactory; following the end of the civil war, several Hs 126s were transferred to the Spanish Air Force.

By the start of the Second World War in September 1939, the Hs 126 served with Aufkl.Gr 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 21, 23, 31, 32 und 41. The type was used to great effect during the Invasion of Poland where it proved itself as a reliable observation and liaison aircraft. Virtually every corps of the German Army was working in coordination with its own army cooperation reconnaissance unit. Daylight reconnaissance flights by the Hs 126 were typically flown beneath an altitude of 2,000 meters; at night time, this decreased further to almost tree-top level. Information gathered was typically conveyed during a debriefing after the aircraft&#x27;s return; however, direct reports using the onboard radio were possible.

The Hs 126 was active during the Invasion of France in May 1940. Numerous aircraft were lost due to interception by Allied fighter aircraft: between 10 and 21 May 1940, 20 Hs 126s were lost alone. Nevertheless, losses of the type in this theatre were not considered to be high.

At the start of the Invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, a total of 47 army cooperation squadrons equipped with Hs 126s participated. A higher loss rate was incurred on the Eastern Front, to the extent that fighter aircraft were more commonly used to protect the type during missions. Additionally, the Hs 126 was used in North Africa, such as with the 2./Aufklärungsgruppe (H)/14; it was eventually withdrawn in favour of the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Messerschmitt Bf 110 towards the end of 1942.

The successor to the Hs 126, the Focke-Wulf Fw 189 Uhu, entered service with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during 1940. Despite this, the Hs 126 remained the principal short range reconnaissance aircraft with frontline units until early 1942.

Late in the conflict, the Hs 126 was used in glider tug and night ground attack roles. The Hs 126 was withdrawn from virtually all front line use during 1943. On 12 September 1943, a number of Hs 126s were used to tow ten DFS 230 attack gliders from Pratica Di Mare airfield near Rome to the Gran Sasso on a raid to rescue Benito Mussolini. Mussolini had been imprisoned there after being deposed by the Grand Council of Fascism, followed by a decree from the King of Italy. The Henschel was a smaller tow plane compared the usual Junkers Ju 52 three-engine tow plane and struggled to gain altitude to clear the mountains on the way. This led to confusion when the lead &quot;Kette&quot; of three gliders turned to gain altitude allowing Otto Skorzeny&#x27;s group of three gliders to assume the lead.

=== Greece ===
At the outbreak of Greco-Italian War of 1940–41, the Royal Hellenic Air Force (&quot;Ellinikí Vasilikí Aeroporía&quot;, RHAF) had in service 16 Henschels, with 3 Observation Mira, under III Corps, based in Thessaloniki and Veria. Two days after the start of the conflict, on 30 October, there was the first air battle between Italian &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; and the RHAF when some Henschel Hs 126 of 3/2 Flight from 3 Observation &quot;Mira&quot; took off to locate Italian Army columns. However, they were intercepted and attacked by Fiat CR.42s of 393a &quot;Squadriglia&quot;. A first Henschel was hit and crashed, killing its observer, Pilot Officer Evanghelos Giannaris, the first Greek aviator to die in the war. A second Hs 126 was downed over Mount Smolikas, killing Pilot Officer Lazaros Papamichail and Sergeant Constantine Yemenetzis.

<text>The 1976 UEFA European Football Championship tournament was held in Yugoslavia. This was the fifth UEFA European Championship, held every four years and endorsed by UEFA and the first and only tournament that was held in a socialist state. The final tournament took place between 16 and 20 June 1976.

Only four countries played in the final tournament, with the tournament consisting of the semi-finals, a third place play-off, and the final. This was the last tournament to have this format, as the tournament was expanded to include eight teams four years later. It was the only time that all four matches in the final tournament were decided after extra time, either on penalties or by goals scored. This was also the last tournament in which the hosts had to qualify for the final stage.

Czechoslovakia won the tournament after defeating holders West Germany in the final on penalties following a 2–2 draw after extra time. Antonín Panenka gained fame for his delicately chipped penalty, which has since been named after him, to win the penalty shootout and Czechoslovakia&#x27;s only European Championship title.

==Qualification==
The qualifying round was played in 1974, 1975 (group phase), and 1976 (quarter-finals). There were eight qualifying groups of four teams each, with matches played on a home-and-away basis. The group winners qualified for the quarter-finals, played in two legs, home and away. The winners of the quarter-finals would go through to the final tournament.

This was the first time the Soviet Union failed to qualify for the finals.

<doc id="584465" wikidata="Q3274230" url="?curid=584465" title="Mach Rider">
<text>is a vehicular combat racing video game developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo. It was first released for the Famicom console and Nintendo VS. System arcade board in Japan in 1985, then in North America for the VS. System in 1985 and Nintendo Entertainment System in 1986, and then for the PAL region in 1987. It was released on the Virtual Console for the Wii (2007), Nintendo 3DS (2013), Wii U (2014), and on the Nintendo Switch Online service (2024).

The Japanese Famicom release can use the Famicom Data Recorder to save custom tracks. The feature was missing from the American and European releases, but was retained in all versions of the Virtual Console release except for the 3DS version.

==Development==
In 1972, Nintendo originally released a plastic race car or hot rod toy called Mach Rider. It has a ramp for jumping and a stick shift with three different kinds of meters. The car is placed inside of it, to be charged up and released at high speed.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Mach Rider&quot; takes place in the year 2112, and planet Earth has been invaded by evil forces driving vehicles known as Quadrunners. The player controls Mach Rider, who travels from sector to sector on a high-powered superbike, searching for survivors and destroying any enemies in their path.

The game&#x27;s controls are somewhat more complex than other games at its time and require some extra skills. The left and right directions on the Control Pad steer Mach Rider and the A button accelerates. The B button fires Mach Rider&#x27;s machine gun which can be used to destroy enemies and obstacles on the road. The up and down buttons are used to shift gears. Mach Rider&#x27;s bike has four speeds and shifting to the fourth gear at high speed will grant the player in instant speed boost. Conversely, the player remaining in a higher gear while stopping results in a slower acceleration.

In each round, points can be scored by destroying enemies and certain obstacles with the machine gun. The number of points scored for destroying enemies and obstacles is determined by the type of enemy or obstacle destroyed. If the player blocks an attacking enemy by ramming it against a hazard on the track, they obtain more points — this also replenishes Mach Rider&#x27;s bullets.

* Fighting Course consists of the primary story sequence. The player controls Mach Rider as they travel across 10 different sectors, and tries to avoid being destroyed by obstacles such as Oil Drums and their enemies, the Quadrunners. If Mach Rider is destroyed, they will separate into fragments and then reform, as long as they have energy (lives from the second sector on) remaining. Much like other games of the time, such as &quot;Ice Climber&quot; and &quot;Balloon Fight&quot;, there is no ending sequence. Once the 10th sector is completed, the story starts anew, with a second quest of 10 entirely new sectors. After the 20th sector is done, then the story starts again, but with the original sectors. On each sector in Fighting Course, the player is given the choice to ride to the next sector on either Track A or Track B. The two tracks are different from one another and with each new sector there are new tracks.
* Endurance Course: The player must race a certain number of kilometres within a time limit while enemies and obstacles get in the way and slow down the progress. Lives and energy are not a factor in Endurance, but being destroyed causes a loss of time.
* Solo Course: This is the same as Endurance Course, but with no enemies.
* Design Mode: This is where the player may design their own sector and race on it using one any of the three other modes of play, but like &quot;Excitebike&quot;, the original game required the Famicom Data Recorder in order to save the tracks, and the device was never released outside Japan. The feature was restored for international markets in the Wii and Wii U Virtual Console versions of the game, which allow the player to save their tracks onto the system memory.

==&quot;VS. Mach Rider&quot;==
&quot;VS. Mach Rider&quot; was released for the Nintendo VS. System in arcades. It is essentially a modified version of the Endurance Course in the Famicom version. After each level, another piece of an image is revealed of a woman with a dagger next to Mach Rider&#x27;s bike.

<text>A kitchen stove, often called simply a stove or a cooker, is a kitchen appliance designed for the purpose of cooking food. Kitchen stoves rely on the application of direct heat for the cooking process and may also contain an oven, used for baking. &quot;Cookstoves&quot; (also called &quot;cooking stoves&quot; or &quot;wood stoves&quot;) are heated by burning wood or charcoal; &quot;gas stoves&quot; are heated by gas; and &quot;electric stoves&quot; by electricity. A stove with a built-in cooktop is also called a range.

In the industrialized world, as stoves replaced open fires and braziers as a source of more efficient and reliable heating, models were developed that could also be used for cooking, and these came to be known as &quot;kitchen stoves&quot;. When homes began to be heated with central heating systems, there was less need for an appliance that served as both heat source and cooker and stand-alone cookers replaced them. &quot;Cooker&quot; and &quot;stove&quot; are often used interchangeably.

The fuel-burning stove is the most basic design of a kitchen stove. As of 2012, it was found that &quot;Nearly half of the people in the world (mainly in the developing world), burn biomass (wood, charcoal, crop residues, and dung) and coal in rudimentary cookstoves or open fires to cook their food.&quot; More fuel-efficient and environmentally sound biomass cookstoves are being developed for use there.

Natural gas and electric stoves are the most common today in western countries. Electricity may reduce environmental impact if generated from non-fossil sources. The choice between the two is mostly a matter of personal preference and availability of utilities. Bottled gas ranges are used where utilities are unavailable.

Modern kitchen stoves often have a &quot;stovetop&quot; or &quot;cooktop&quot; in American English; known as the &quot;hob&quot; in British English as well as an oven. A &quot;drop-in range&quot; is a combination stovetop-and-oven unit that installs in a kitchen&#x27;s lower cabinets flush with the countertop. Most modern stoves come in a unit with built-in extractor hoods. Today&#x27;s major brands offer both gas and electric stoves, and many also offer dual-fuel ranges combining a gas stovetop and an electric oven.

== History ==

===Early kitchen stoves===

Early clay stoves that enclosed the fire completely were known from the Chinese Qin dynasty (221 BC – 206/207 BC), and a similar design known as &quot;kamado&quot; (かまど) appeared in the Kofun period (3rd–6th century) in Japan. These stoves were fired by wood or charcoal through a hole in the front. In both designs, pots were placed over or hung into holes at the top of the knee-high construction. In the Middle East, references to similar stoves and cooking ranges where the fire was lit from below are recorded as early as the 2nd-century AD, constructed of clay and either made portable or attached to the ground. Raised &quot;kamados&quot; were developed in Japan during the Edo period (1603–1867).

Prior to the 18th century in Europe, people cooked over open fires fueled by wood. In the Middle Ages, waist-high brick-and-mortar hearths and the first chimneys appeared, so that cooks no longer had to kneel or sit to tend to foods on the fire. The fire was built on top of the construction; the cooking done mainly in cauldrons hung above the fire or placed on trivets. The heat was regulated by placing the cauldron higher or lower above the fire.

Open fire systems had three significant disadvantages that prompted an evolutionary series of improvements from the 16th century onwards: it was dangerous, it produced much smoke, and the heat efficiency was poor. Attempts were made to enclose the fire to make better use of the heat that is generated and thus reduce the wood consumption. An early step was the &quot;fire chamber&quot;: the fire was enclosed on three sides by brick-and-mortar walls and covered by an iron plate. This technique also caused a change in the kitchenware used for cooking, for it required flat-bottomed pots instead of cauldrons. The first design that completely enclosed the fire was the 1735 &quot;Castrol stove&quot;, built by the Walloon-Bavarian architect François de Cuvilliés. This stove was a masonry construction with several fire holes covered by perforated iron plates and was also known as a &quot;stew stove&quot;. Near the end of the 18th century, the design was refined by hanging the pots in holes through the top iron plate, thus improving heat efficiency even more.

===Origins of the modern kitchen range===
The modern kitchen range was invented by Sir Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford in the 1790s. As an active scientist and prolific inventor, he put the study of heat onto a scientific basis and developed improvements for chimneys, fireplaces and industrial furnaces, which led to his invention of the kitchen range.
His Rumford fireplace created a sensation in London when he introduced the idea of restricting the chimney opening to increase the updraught. This was a much more efficient way to heat a room than earlier fireplaces. He and his workers modified fireplaces by inserting bricks into the hearth to make the side walls angled, and added a choke to the chimney to increase the speed of air going up the flue. The effect was to produce a streamlined air flow, so all the smoke would go up into the chimney rather than lingering and entering the room. It also had the effect of increasing the efficiency of the fire, and gave extra control of the rate of combustion of the fuel, whether wood or coal. Many fashionable London houses were modified to his instructions, and became free of smoke.

Following on from this success, Thompson designed a kitchen range made of brick, with a cylindrical oven and holes in the top for the insertion of pots. When not needed, the opening could be covered over leaving the fire to smolder gently. This kitchen range was much more fuel efficient than the prevailing open hearth method and to a great degree safer. His range was widely adopted in large cooking establishments, including at the soup kitchens that Thompson built in Bavaria. However, it was too big and unwieldy to make much of an impact on domestic cooking.

The first half of the nineteenth century witnessed a steady improvement in stove design. Cast iron stoves replaced those made of masonry and their size shrank to allow them to be incorporated into the domestic kitchen. By the 1850s, the modern kitchen, equipped with a cooking range, was a fixture of middle-class homes. In 1850 Mary Evard invented the Reliance Cook Stove, which was divided in two with one half for dry baking and the other half for moist. Patents issued to Mary Evard are and on April 7, 1868. She demonstrated this stove with her husband at the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair.
In 1867 Elizabeth Hawks of New York invented and received for a baking attachment for stoves, intended to spread heat thoroughly throughout loaves while keeping the top crust tender, which she called an &quot;Auxiliary Air-chamber for Stoves.&quot; This was so successful that she sold two thousand within months of its release.

Stoves of that era commonly burned charcoal as well as wood. These stoves had flat tops and the heat was concentrated on one side of the stove top so that cooks could cook things at different temperatures based on where the pot or pan was located. This was called the &quot;piano&quot; system. After coal was replaced with gas, French chefs continued to prefer the smooth cooking surface and so the majority of French gas stoves had flat metal surfaces over the gas burners, which continues to be known as the &quot;French style&quot; today.

===Gas stove===
A major improvement in fuel technology came with the advent of gas. The first gas stoves were developed as early as the 1820s, but these remained isolated experiments. James Sharp patented a gas stove in Northampton, England, in 1826 and opened a gas stove factory in 1836. His invention was marketed by the firm Smith &amp; Philips from 1828. An important figure in the early acceptance of this new technology, was Alexis Soyer, the renowned chef at the Reform Club in London. From 1841, he converted his kitchen to consume piped gas, arguing that gas was cheaper overall because the supply could be turned off when the stove was not in use.

A gas stove was shown at The Great Exhibition in London in 1851, but it was only in the 1880s that the technology became a commercial success in England. By that stage a large and reliable network for gas pipeline transport had spread over much of the country, making gas relatively cheap and efficient for domestic use. Gas stoves only became widespread on the European Continent and in the United States in the early 20th century.

===Electric stove===
Once electric power was widely and economically available, electric stoves became a popular alternative to fuel-burning appliances. One of the earliest such devices was patented by Canadian inventor Thomas Ahearn in 1892. Ahearn and Warren Y. Soper were owners of Ottawa&#x27;s Chaudiere Electric Light and Power Company. The electric stove was showcased at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair in 1893, where an electrified model kitchen was shown.

Unlike the gas stove, the electrical stove was slow to catch on, partly due to the unfamiliar technology, and the need for cities and towns to be electrified. Early electric stoves were unsatisfactory due to the cost of electricity (compared with wood, coal, or city gas), limited power available from the electrical supply company, poor temperature regulation, and short life of heating elements. The invention of nichrome alloy for resistance wires improved the cost and durability of heating elements.

The first practical design was patented by the Australian David Curle Smith in 1905. His device adopted (following the design of gas stoves) what later became the configuration for most electric stoves: an oven surmounted by a hotplate with a grill tray between them. Curle Smith&#x27;s stove did not have a thermostat; heat was controlled by the number of the appliance&#x27;s nine elements that were switched on.

The first electric stoves used heating elements made of high-resistance metal to produce heat. The stovetop (range) surface had one or more circular heating elements, insulated with compressed magnesia and sheathed in a spiral metal tube. Heating elements for the oven are of similar construction but an elongated loop to distribute heat. Elements were made as plug-in consumer-replaceable parts and could also be easily removed for cleaning. Temperature of cooking elements was regulated by adjusting a bimetal thermostat control switch, which switched power on and off to control the average heating effect of the elements.

===Other technologies===

A high-end gas stove called the AGA cooker was invented in 1922 by Swedish Nobel prize winner Gustaf Dalén. As a heat storage stove, it worked on the principle that a heavy frame made from cast iron components can absorb heat from a relatively low-intensity but continuously burning source, and the accumulated heat can then be used when needed for cooking.

Dalén took his design to Britain in 1929, where it was first manufactured under licence in the early 1930s. The cast iron components were first cast at the Coalbrookdale foundry in the 1940s, where they are still made today by the Aga Rangemaster Group. Its popularity in certain parts of English society (owners of medium to large country houses) led to the coining of the term &quot;Aga saga&quot; in the 1990s, referring to a genre of fiction set amongst stereotypical upper-middle-class society.

Microwave ovens were developed in the 1940s, and use microwave radiation to directly heat the water held inside food.

==Cooktop==

A cooktop or hob is a cooking appliance that heats the bottoms of pans or pots; it does not have an enclosed oven as used for baking or roasting. Cooktops may be heated by gas or electricity and may also have exhaust systems.

Flattop grills are also being installed into kitchen counters and islands, which do double-duty as a direct cooking surface as well as a platform for heating pots and pans. A hot plate is a similar device, which is mobile and can be used as an appropriate technology.

<text>Henry Draper (March 7, 1837 – November 20, 1882) was an American medical doctor and amateur astronomer. He is best known today as a pioneer of astrophotography.

==Life and work==
Henry Draper&#x27;s father, John William Draper, was an accomplished doctor, chemist, botanist, and professor at New York University; he was also the first to photograph the moon through a telescope (1840). Draper&#x27;s mother was Antonia Caetana de Paiva Pereira Gardner, daughter of the personal physician to the Emperor of Brazil. His niece, Antonia Maury was also an astronomer.

He graduated from New York University School of Medicine, at the age of 20, in 1857. He worked first as a physician at Bellevue Hospital, and later as both a professor and dean of medicine at New York University (NYU). On May 31, 1862, he joined S Company, 12th New York Infantry Regiment as a surgeon along with his brother John Christopher, who joined as an assistant surgeon. They served until October 8, 1862. In 1867 he married Mary Anna Palmer, a wealthy socialite who collaborated with him in his astronomy work.

Draper was one of the pioneers of the use of astrophotography. In 1872, he took a stellar spectrum that showed absorption lines. Others, such as Joseph Fraunhofer, Lewis Morris Rutherfurd and Angelo Secchi, preceded him in that ambition.

He resigned his chair in the medical department in 1873, to allow for more time for original research.

He directed an expedition to photograph the 1874 transit of Venus, and was the first to photograph the Orion Nebula, on September 30, 1880. Using his 11 inch Clark Brothers photographic refractor he took a 50-minute exposure. He photographed the spectrum of Jupiter in 1880.

The Henry Draper Observatory where he took his much-admired photographs of the moon, was in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. Today the building functions as the Hastings-on-Hudson Historical Society.

Draper received numerous awards, including honorary LL.D. law degrees from NYU and the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1882, a Congressional medal for directing the U.S. expedition to photograph the 1874 transit of Venus, and election to both the National Academy of Sciences and the Astronomische Gesellschaft. In addition, he held memberships in the American Photographic Society, the American Philosophical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

After his untimely early death from double pleurisy, his widow Mary Anna Draper funded the Henry Draper Medal for outstanding contributions to astrophysics and a telescope, which was used to prepare the Henry Draper Catalog of stellar spectra. This historical Henry Draper telescope is now at the Toruń Centre for Astronomy (Nicolaus Copernicus University) at Piwnice, Poland. The small crater Draper on the Moon is named in his honor.

<doc id="584471" wikidata="Q597933" url="?curid=584471" title="Televisión Nacional de Chile">
<text>Televisión Nacional de Chile (TVN) is a Chilean public service broadcaster. It was founded by order of President Eduardo Frei Montalva and it was launched nationwide on 18 September 1969. Since then, the company has been reorganized on several occasions and its operations areas have increased over the years, becoming one of the leading television broadcasters in Chile and South America. Law 17 377 of 1970 established that TVN must be a public, autonomous, pluralistic, and representative public service. TVN&#x27;s public mission determines the obligation to promote the national cultural identity, the values of democracy, human rights, care for the environment and respect for diversity. Furthermore, Televisión Nacional governs the programming of its services according to criteria established by the National Television Council (CNTV).

Televisión Nacional has been a pioneer in introducing technological advances in Chile. It was the first television network to have national coverage, satellite broadcast, colour television, stereo sound, and high-definition television. Several of their soap operas have reached the highest ratings in the history of Chilean television, and are recognized both in that country and abroad for their social content, realism and settings, while its news programs have been crucial in catastrophes such as the 2010 earthquake and aftermath, when TVN news teams arrived in the affected areas before the National Army and government authorities. Currently, TVN has higher pluralism in its programmes and is the second most credible television news brand in the country.

Its headquarters are located in Providencia, Santiago Metropolitan Region and it employs 638 total staff. Furthermore, TVN has nine additional television centres in the country. The company is directed through a chairperson appointed by the President of the Republic, which has a duration of four years, synchronized with the presidential period. The other six members of the board of directors are appointed three times per period in an agreement between the Senate and the President of the Republic for eight years. To them, a seventh member is added who is chosen democratically by the staff. Currently, the chairperson of Televisión Nacional de Chile is Andrea Fresard, while the executive director and legal representative is Alfredo Ramírez.

Televisión Nacional is the only publicly-owned television company in Chile and competes with other private broadcasting networks, having a self-financing scheme based mainly on the advertising sales that it has preserved since its inception and later regulated by Act 19,132 of 1992. TVN, under Act 20,694 of 2013, can fulfill the tasks of the exploitation of television services and the production of audiovisual or broadcasting content, as well as acting as a concessionaire of telecommunications services. Additionally, it is affiliated with the &quot;Asociación Nacional de Televisión&quot; or &quot;Anatel&quot; (National Association of Television) and the Council of Self-Regulation and Advertising Ethics, among others.

== History ==

The origins of television in Chile took ground after the promulgation of the Television Law 7,039 on 28 October 1958, which was the first legislation of its kind in that country. This regulation was decreed and implemented by the government of then President Jorge Alessandri given the need to regulate the only three existing channels in the national territory: Canal 13, Canal 9 and UCV Television, which at that time were university property and therefore were private broadcasters.

The essential need to own a channel belonging to the Chilean State took relevance from the 1960s, as the great challenge that the government of Eduardo Frei Montalva wanted to face, believing ideally, the existence of a public television station with national coverage, capable of transmitting in a territory of large geographical features. To this end, a limited liability company was created whose original partners were the entrepreneurship agency CORFO, the production company Chilefilms and Entel, all of which were public companies at the time, establishing Televisión Nacional de Chile on 31 January 1969 through the telecommunications trunk network of that country and a series of test transmissions that remained until several years later.

=== 1968–69: Development of Televisión Nacional ===
==== Establishment ====

The first regional station established by Televisión Nacional de Chile was Arica&#x27;s channel 7, with the support of the Board of Advancement of Arica (&quot;Junta de Adelanto de Arica&quot;), initiating its broadcast on 12 December 1968 with provisional studios located in the Edificio Plaza and its transmitter located then in the Morro de Arica. It was officially inaugurated on the same day by President Eduardo Frei Montalva, counting only on programming relayed from Santiago. Subsequently, on 1 February 1969, the broadcast of channel 6 of Punta Arenas began with an inauguration attended by President Eduardo Frei Montalva, as well as the Intendant of Magallanes, Mateo Martinic. The day before, 31 January, was the day TVN was officially incorporated as a public enterprise, it is still marked as the birthday of the network.

==== Initial expansion ====
On 21 May 1969, Talca began to receive TVN broadcasts on channel 10 directly from Santiago, although the Santiago channel would not be officially inaugurated until some months later. On 15 July 1969, the broadcast of channel 6 of Antofagasta was officially inaugurated, making some local programs and receiving programming from Santiago with some days of delay. Finally, on 18 September of that year, on Independence Day, TVN in Santiago on channel 7 signed on to cover Independence Day celebrations, and is still the flagship station, providing network-produced live coverage of national events, which are occasionally simulcast by other stations nationwide. This channel had previously and experimentally broadcast Chile&#x27;s matches in the Davis Cup that year, the presidential message to Congress of 21 May (Navy Day) and the arrival of man on the Moon that July.

=== 1969–73: Establishment of the national network ===
==== Establishment and initial studios ====
Regular broadcasts of Televisión Nacional began officially in Santiago on Independence Day, on 18 September 1969, covering 6 of the 25 provinces of the national territory at the time, and having stable programming with more than twelve hours of daily broadcast, although unlike what was expected, operating under the model of subsidiaries or associated channels in the provinces. Initially, the first studios of the new network were concentrated in a house leased to the family of the poet Vicente Huidobro, located at the intersections of Libertador General Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins Avenue (Alameda) and San Martín Street, near the Torre Entel. They later moved to one side of the Santiago Metropolitan Cathedral and finally, the then-new permanent studios were inaugurated on 20 August 1970 in Providencia.

==== Expansion across Chile ====
The expansion of the main signal was carried out in Iquique on 23 May 1970 on channel 10, while on 2 July, TVN was launched in Calama and Chuquicamata, also on channel 10. In August of the same year, the expansion of the network included Valdivia on channel 3, Osorno on channel 5, Puerto Montt on channel 4, and Ancud on channel 7. Subsequently, its expansion would reach new locations, such as Coyhaique on 21 May 1971, La Serena and Coquimbo on channel 4 in June 1972, and Castro on channel 10 in early 1973. TVN, already positioned as a means of information at the beginning of that decade, had to be ordered by Law 17,377 of 1970, which provided legal recognition to the station and made it &quot;public&quot;, since Law 7039 of 1958 did not contemplate this.

==== Usage as a propaganda tool ====
Originally, the network&#x27;s mission was to be a pluralistic and independent media of the current government, which was intended to &quot;integrate, inform, entertain and give culture to the Chilean family&quot;, as proposed by the Ministry of Education and the group of professionals who directed TVN. In later years, the governments of President Salvador Allende initially and later dictator, Augusto Pinochet, used the channel as a means of spreading propaganda and political ideology to support their governments and ideologies.

=== 1973–90: Military dictatorship ===
==== Temporary closure, occupation by Canal 13, and reopening ====
On 11 September 1973, after the coup d&#x27;état in the morning, Televisión Nacional did not start broadcasting during the day and the studios were closed for three days. There was also an assault on the headquarters, where abundant amounts of audiovisual material were burned by the military, including a large part of the records of the first years of broadcast. During the three days it was closed, Canal 13 decided to occupy TVN&#x27;s national network, because it was the only one authorized to broadcast after the coup d&#x27;état. After resuming the broadcast, it became the official television network of the new military dictatorship with informative management and strong control in the programming, granting an advantage in audiences to Canal 13 news programme &quot;Teletrece&quot;, which was considered &quot;more liberal&quot;. In January 1975, it opened a station in Easter Island.

==== Colour television ====

The first experimental colour broadcast in Chile was developed by Televisión Nacional in the final night of the Viña del Mar International Song Festival on 6 February 1978. However, Decree 480, which was in force since 10 September 1976, restricted the import of colour television sets. This regulation, promulgated by Augusto Pinochet, was abolished on 10 April 1978, with the promulgation of a new resolution, ending the restrictions and therefore officially beginning broadcasts in color, adopting the NTSC format from the United States as the official system. At the time of the authorization and start-up, a large part of the network&#x27;s programming was already in place, and programmes such as &quot;La cafetera voladora&quot; were fully developed with this technology. This allowed the use of innumerable special effects. It astonished the children of the time and could extend until 1982, setting a precedent in the production of programmes of this type in Chile.

==== Advances and reform ====
Throughout the 1980s, Televisión Nacional grew with diverse programmes and technological advances. It became the first Chilean television network to broadcast its programming via satellite, released its second channel in 1987, and inaugurated its international service in 1989. However, despite all the technical achievements, the company is criticized for its newscast, &quot;60 Minutos&quot;, by misrepresenting the news and information that every day reverberated society during this period. 

In addition to the loss of credibility, prestige, and audience, this led to the reorganization and rethinking the mission and identity of Televisión Nacional at times of political instability in Chile, as the last months of the regime were being developed, therefore, in democracy, the company seeks to be reformed and the new government authorities were prepared to make all kinds of changes.

=== 1990–2000: Return to democracy and new organisation model ===
With the arrival of the 1990s and the return to democracy, under the mandate of President Patricio Aylwin, he decreed the second Law of Television 19,132 of 1992. This was debated widely between the government and opposition, consecrating the publicly-owned network like an autonomous company with legal personality in its own right and establishing that its assets must be managed by a board of directors, whose designation involved the President of the Republic and the Senate, as well as a representative of the staff.

This legislation sought to transform TVN into a media, autonomous, pluralistic, and representative, achieving the original objective proposed at the outset of programmatic content impartiality trying to have independence from the government. Another factor was the complementation of a self-financing system, not receiving public funds. Subsequently, the second channel, Canal 9, was acquired by businessman Ricardo Claro and converted into Red Televisiva Megavisión (Mega). 

==== Further advances ====
With the new organisation model, TVN achieved major accomplishments, such as the creation of new regional television centres, the creation of the online service, &quot;TVN.cl&quot;, in 1998, the first experimental broadcast in high definition in 1999, and a complete remodeling the Santiago headquarters in 2000, whose first stage was inaugurated in 2002 and the second stage in 2005.

=== Expansion of audiences (2000–2015) ===
TVN received the so-called &quot;new millennium&quot; with the special program &quot;2000 Hoy&quot; (2000 today) that was broadcast in various segments during the day of 31 December 1999 and featured the participation of various faces of the channel. The space broadcast live the arrival of the year 2000 from different parts of the world and during the night after the message on the national network by President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, a musical show was broadcast from the center of Santiago to await the new year in Chile. Since then, the success of the channel continued at the end of the 1990s, and with the arrival of 2000, several programs became popular, such as the telenovela Romané, which obtained 50 audience points in its final episode. Additionally, that year it also broadcast the 2000 Sydney Olympics.

On the afternoon of 19 December 2000, the resignation of René Cortázar from his position as executive director was announced, after a controversy surrounding the episode &quot;La CIA en Chile&quot; of the Informe Especial program that detailed the intervention of the Central Agency of US intelligence during the government of President Salvador Allende. Before the broadcast, some board members asked the executive director to intervene. Cortázar requested modifications in the program to the press director, Jaime Moreno, but the latter refused and finally, the program was broadcast in its entirety in November of that year. This caused the abrupt departure of René Cortázar, despite the fact that during his tenure in his last year, TVN experienced a period of economic prosperity with profits in excess of three billion pesos.

==Programming==
With diverse programmes, Televisión Nacional de Chile has produced and created its own spaces, as well as in association with various production companies. In addition, it has broadcast information, fiction, foreign content, and sporting events since its inception. Every day the nationwide channel starts its broadcasts with the news programme &quot;24 AM&quot;, followed by a space that occupies a large part of the morning programming; During the afternoon two main news programmes are broadcast, &quot;24 Tarde&quot; at 1:00 pm and &quot;24 horas central&quot; at 9:00 pm, where the last one is considered as the flagship evening news.

The soap operas and series of own production or foreign origin have usually occupied since the beginning of the channel, the afternoon schedule, however, also since 2004, TVN has broadcast soap operas at night. Additionally, in the afternoon, apart from the dramas, programmes such as &quot;Rojo&quot; are broadcast. In the evening, after &quot;24 horas central&quot;, the weather forecast is broadcast on &quot;TV Tiempo&quot; and then programmes or soap operas. Next, the midnight newscast &quot;Medianoche&quot; is broadcast. During the weekends, cultural, children&#x27;s, or political discussion programmes such as &quot;El informante&quot; and &quot;Estado nacional&quot; are presented.

The news from Chile and the world is presented under the brand &quot;24 horas&quot; since 1990, with several daily editions, and all the news programmes are part of the 24-hours news channel Canal 24 horas that breaks into the national channel&#x27;s usual programming in an emergency, delivering news bulletins, including live broadcast during earthquakes. Previously the news carried the name of &quot;Telediario&quot;, &quot;Martini al instante&quot;, &quot;Noticiero&quot;, the controversial &quot;60 minutos&quot;, &quot;TVNoticias&quot;, and finally &quot;Noticias&quot; before its current name.

=== Special programming ===

Some special programmes that TVN broadcasts on an annual basis or from time to time, are the presidential debates that are organized by the National Television Association, general elections, special events, the messages of the President of the Republic and also the televised fundraising event Teletón, usually at the end of each year, along with other channels of Chilean television and has done so since the first edition of the event since 1978 for 27 hours like every other. Another activity that is covered annually is the pyrotechnic and musical show of the new year&#x27;s celebrations in Valparaíso. Previously, celebrations in Santiago were issued in past decades.

Televisión Nacional has been the official network of the Viña del Mar International Song Festival from 1971 to 1993, between 2007 and 2010, and again since 2019; the Festival del Huaso de Olmué from 1989 to 1990, and again since 2014; the Fiesta de la Independencia de Talca since 2016 and also in past decades broadcast the OTI Festival. Some sporting events that are and have been displayed on TVN are the Summer Olympic Games and some Winter editions, the FIFA World Cup, the Copa América, the Santiago Marathon, and in the past until the Formula 1, among other events.

The network broadcasts the Great Military Parade of Chile, a parade that takes place every year in Chile on 19 September in O&#x27;Higgins Park in Santiago. The broadcast achieves high audience ratings in conjunction with other television channels, but especially in TVN because it is the channel that makes the television production of the event.

== Services ==

Among its signals is considered a main channel of free reception which transmits by satellite to several repeaters that are located in Chilean territories, having a reach of 98% of the population. It also has nine regional channels with its own production centres, an international service called TV Chile; the news channel Canal 24 Horas and its internet counterpart 24Play; online presence with several sites, the music label TVN Records and a free streaming service called TVN Play.

== Headquarters and regional centres ==
The official headquarters of Televisión Nacional de Chile is located in Providencia, Santiago Metropolitan Region. The complex is the home of the national channel, the internet and worldwide services, music label, and Fox Sports Chile. Inaugurated in 1970, the renovation of the building began in 1999 and was completed in 2005. On 1 December 2004, the station suffered a fire due to an electrical failure. The incident caused the interruption of the main channel for one hour. There were no injuries or deaths and four fire companies controlled the fire.

The centre is familiar to many Chilean citizens and is currently a site visited by tour guides. Within the enclosure is an esplanade known as &quot;Patio de las Comunicaciones&quot;, occasionally used for corporate events and television programmes. The complex also includes 3 studios for the drama area, a center for domestic, global, and online news divisions and the sports area, a video editing room, an auditorium, warehouses of props, files of documentation, a cafeteria, dressing rooms for artists and technical staff, technical areas, office areas for the board of directors, general management, general secretary, administration and finance, press, as well as 2 levels of underground car parks.

Televisión Nacional de Chile has production centres with newsrooms and studios in Antofagasta, Copiapó, La Serena, Valparaíso, Rancagua, Talca, Concepción, Temuco and Punta Arenas. In addition, a commercial office in Arica y Parinacota Region.

== Structure and governance ==
=== Chairpersons of the Board of Directors ===
== Corporate identity ==
=== Mascots ===
From 1970 to 1973, the network had a mascot named &quot;Tevito&quot;, accompanied by &quot;Charagua&quot; as characteristic music that was composed by Víctor Jara and performed by Inti-Illimani. After the coup d&#x27;état on 11 September 1973, &quot;Tevito&quot; was suddenly removed from the advertisements, several video tapes where it appeared were destroyed by the Chilean Army, and finally, it was replaced by other characters. However, &quot;Tevito&quot; was again used symbolically on 11 March 1990, on the day of the presidential inauguration of Patricio Aylwin. Currently, &quot;Charagua&quot; in Chile is usually related to Televisión Nacional as &quot;de facto&quot; institutional theme.

==== &quot;Tevito&quot; ====
&quot;Tevito&quot; was a smiling cartoon dog personified in various ways. Sometimes, he was a boxer, sometimes he wore reading glasses, and also disguised himself as a vampire. He played the &quot;trutruca&quot;, a typical instrument of the Mapuche indigenous people of southern Chile. More often, &quot;Tevito&quot;, in the manner of a chinchinero, carried on his back a bass drum carrying the first network logo with both long mallets hitting the drum, with a set of suspended cymbals similar to a drum kit on top of the drum. The character was created by Carlos González, a student of the Fine Arts Institute in Santiago, Chile, whose drawing won the competition among six other submissions. Since then &quot;Tevito&quot; become part of the Chilean popular culture.

==== &quot;Ito e Ita&quot; ====
&quot;Ito e Ita&quot; was the second mascot of TVN. It debuted in 1974 and remained on screen until 1978 with the arrival of color television, they were usually accompanied by music from the band Los Huasos Quincheros.

==== &quot;Conejito TV&quot; ====
In 1979 a third mascot designed for colour broadcast named &quot;Conejito TV&quot;, was presented. &quot;Conejito TV&quot; remained until 1984 and was usually accompanied by Gabriela Velasco.

==== &quot;Clorofilo&quot; ====
In 1987, it was presented a mascot that consisted of a green extraterrestrial without name. The extraterrestrial was finally baptized as &quot;Clorofilo&quot;, in reference to the green chlorophyll, after a contest. Finally, &quot;Clorofilo&quot; was removed from the screen in mid-1988 and since then they have not used characters of that type as mascots.

=== Logos ===

Televisión Nacional de Chile has a corporate identity based on the promotion and strengthening of the Chilean culture. Since its inception, the colours of the national flag have been used mostly to identify the company in their logos, such as the current one where the red colour predominates.

==== Logo history ====
The original logo, which made its debut on 18 September 1969, featured a &quot;screen&quot; with the borders corresponding with the colors of the Chilean flag. Inside the &quot;screen&quot;, it has the TV Chile typograph (unrelated to the TV Chile international service), but the texts &quot;T&quot; and &quot;Chile&quot; were initially black before switching to blue on 6 February 1978, corresponding with the arrival of colour television. The colors on the &quot;screen&quot; border were modified and the gap between the colors became wider, along with the &quot;V&quot; going separate from the &quot;T&quot; and &quot;Chile&quot;.

On 1 April 1984, the logo was replaced with an &quot;N&quot; with Chilean flag color ribbons, before a modified version of the 1978 logo returned 3 years later. It first appeared on TVN&#x27;s news programs in 1987. The modified logo featured a different shade of blue along the &quot;screen&quot; border, and &quot;Chile&quot; had a more condensed font. The 1984 design continued to be the secondary logo until January 1988. When TV Chile launched in 1989, it had the same logo as TVN. The design continued to be used until 1990, but between 11 March and 21 November, the borders of the &quot;screen&quot; were changed to rainbow, and the text &quot;Chile&quot; was light blue. Prior to this, the modified logo&#x27;s red and blue stripes were also swapped.

The 1990 design, launched on 23 November 1990, ditched the &quot;screen&quot; with the TV typograph in black text, and &quot;Chile&quot; was replaced with a stripe of the Chilean colors. A modified version, launched on 2 June 1993, replaced the text color from black to grey, along with a more italicised look and a lighter blue colour stripe, and on 1 September 1996, it added the letter &quot;N&quot;, and the white stripe was removed, leaving only the blue and red stripes. The aforementioned stripes were also changed to be lighter.

A transitional logo, still keeping the 1996 logo, was introduced in late 2003. This would be the predecessor of the 2004 logo, as it featured the white TVN logo inside a red square. 

On 4 January 2004, the 1996 design was replaced with the &quot;red square&quot; logo, featuring the TVN typograph inside a red square. A modified version was introduced on 9 August 2016, with rounded edges. Prior to its debut as its corporate logo, the &quot;cuadrado rojo&quot; (red square) was a symbol that debuted in September 1994, and since then, it began to be used progressively in the advertising and in 2001, it was used for the first time on-screen to show the content rating system. Since then, it began to draw attention, and in January 2004, it ended up becoming the corporate logo. 

Since its release, the &quot;red square&quot; has influenced the logos and graphics of all brands of Televisión Nacional. In October 2020, the red square was removed, leaving just the TVN typograph in a red colour. However, it also featured a separate blue-coloured logo.

<doc id="584473" wikidata="Q4522" url="?curid=584473" title="Ujung Kulon National Park">
<text>Ujung Kulon National Park is a national park at the westernmost tip of Java, located in Sumur District of Pandeglang Regency, part of Banten province in Indonesia. It once included the volcanic island group of Krakatoa in Lampung province, although current maps has suggested the Krakatoa island group as its own protected area, the Pulau Anak Krakatau Marine Nature Reserve.

The area has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site for &quot;containing the largest remaining area of lowland rainforests in Java&quot;, and also for possessing the most threatened species of rhino, the Javan rhino. It was designated before its formation as a national park.

The park fully encompasses the Ujung Kulon peninsula, along with surrounding islands and the Gunung Honje mountain range. 

Ujung Kulon itself means &quot;Western End&quot; or &quot;Point West&quot; in Sundanese/Bantenese.

==Geography==
The park covers an area of , of which is marine.
Most of the park landmass lies on the mainland, specifically the Ujung Kulon Peninsula, with the highest elevation of atMt. Payung in the southwest of the peninsula. The eastern area of the park is marked by the Gunung Honje mountain range, possessing several low-lying mountains with the highest peak at Mt. Honje at .

==History==
The Ujung Kulon area was first introduced to the Western world by Dutch-German botanist, Franz W. Junghuhn in 1846, during one of his expeditions. Since then, scientists have started gaining interest in the peninsula&#x27;s biological abundance. Several years later, this supposed first trip to Ujung Kulon was included in a scientific journal.
However there are not many written records regarding Ujung Kulon before the eruption of Mount Krakatoa in 1883.

Following the Krakatoa eruption and the ensuing tsunami, which was reported to be 15 meters high, many of the peninsula&#x27;s settlements were destroyed and never completely rebuilt. The eruption also obliterated much of the local flora and fauna, leaving an average layer of volcanic ash across the area. Despite this, the area rapidly recovered, enabling it to serve as a repository for a large portion of Java&#x27;s flora and fauna as well as the majority of the island&#x27;s lowland forest. 

Conservation efforts for the area began in the early 20th century during colonial Dutch East Indies. Pulau Panaitan was first designated as a nature reserve (&quot;Suaka Alam&quot;) in 1921 before later being combined with Pulau Peucang to become a wildlife sanctuary (&quot;Suaka Margasatwa&quot;) in 1937. Post-independence, the area acclaimed restored status as a nature reserve along with the peninsula. The southern part of Gunung Honje Protection Forest was incorporated within the reserve in 1967, with the northern portion following in 1979. Lastly, it was declared a national park in 1992. Border reconstructions by Mt. Honje were finalized in 2004. 

It is Indonesia&#x27;s first proposed national park coincidentally designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1991 during its establishment for containing the largest remaining lowland rainforest in Java. By 2005, the park was designated as an ASEAN Heritage Park.

Villages that still survived within the area have now acclaimed cultural status as &quot;Kampung Wisata&quot; (literally &#x27;Recreational Village&#x27;). Future plans even intended to develop Cimenteng, one of the local hamlets, into an ecovillage.

==Wildlife==
Ujung Kulon is one of three national parks in Java housing a lowland rainforest ecosystem, together with Baluran and Alas Purwo National Park. It therefore possesses a somewhat similar ecosystem, despite being much wetter than the latter due to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification, the latter being found on East Java instead.

=== Flora ===
So far, 175 species have been observed within the park, with 57 of them being protected, This includes mangroves (e.g. &quot;Sonneratia alba&quot;, &quot;Excoecaria agallocha&quot;, &quot;Rhizophora apiculata&quot;, &quot;Aegiceras corniculatum&quot;), coastal plants (e.g. &quot;Nypa fruticans&quot;, &quot;Calophyllum inophyllum&quot;, &quot;Terminalia catappa&quot;, &quot;Hibiscus tiliaceus&quot;, etc.), Figs (e.g. &quot;Ficus benjamina&quot;, &quot;Ficus deltoidea&quot;, &quot;Ficus racemosa&quot;, &quot;Ficus septica&quot;) and other lowland vegetation such as &quot;Oroxylum indicum&quot;, &quot;Melastoma malabathricum&quot;, &quot;Sterculia foetida&quot;, and &quot;Durio zibethinus&quot;.
The park possesses three protected rare flora, namely &quot;Heritiera percoriacea&quot;, &quot;Vatica bantamensis&quot;, and &quot;Intsia bijuga.&quot; &quot;Rafflesia patma&quot; is also a notable species.

Currently one particular species of plant is considered troublesome, especially towards the rhino conservation program, the Arenga palm (&quot;Arenga obtusifolia&quot;). This species of palm has been noted to grow rapidly while consuming much area, starving the undergrowth of sunlight, reducing the rhino&#x27;s required food supply. Local authorities have claimed that eradication efforts have been and will continue to go on.

=== Fauna ===
Ujung Kulon is the last known refuge for the critically endangered Javan rhinoceros after the death of the last remaining Javan rhino in Cát Tiên National Park, Vietnam, where a small population of 10 or less remained in 2010. In Ujung Kulon the population has been estimated at 40–60 in the 1980s. Within 2001-2010 there have been 14 rhino births identified using camera and video traps. Based on recordings taken between February and October 2011, 35 rhinoceros had been identified, of which 22 were males and 13 females. Of these 7 were old, 18 adults, 5 youngsters, and 5 infant rhinos. Increasing from previous years, in 2013 there were 8 calves of which 3 of them were female and 50 teenage and adult of which 20 of them were female identified using 120 video cameras functioning at night with motion sensors. It can be said to be accurate data, since every rhino has its own unique morphology, mainly from skin wrinkles around the eyes. Current estimates are set to about 82 rhinos.

By 2013 feeding areas of &quot;Eupatorium odoratum&quot; vegetation have been reduced from 10 locations comprising to 5 locations comprising . This has increased competition for feeding grounds between the local rhino and banteng population.
Roughly 35 mammals species endemic to Java are found in the park, notably the banteng, silvery gibbon, Javan lutung, crab-eating macaque, Javan leopard, dhole, Java mouse-deer, Javan rusa, Sunda leopard cat and smooth-coated otter. There are 197 species of birds.
Javan tigers survived in the national park until the mid-1960s.

<text>Vanessa Lee Carlton (born August 16, 1980) is an American singer-songwriter and pianist. Her debut album, &quot;Be Not Nobody&quot; (2002), released by A&amp;M Records, received a platinum certification in the United States, and her debut single and signature song &quot;A Thousand Miles&quot; spent 41 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and earned three Grammy nominations. The album also spawned the singles &quot;Ordinary Day&quot; and &quot;Pretty Baby&quot;. Her next album, &quot;Harmonium&quot; (2004) debuted at number 33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album marked a stalwart divergence from pressure from record label executives who wanted to influence the recording. After departing from A&amp;M in 2005, Carlton released &quot;Heroes &amp; Thieves&quot; in 2007. Despite minimal chart success, the album was a critical success, receiving praise from Metacritic, AllMusic, PopMatters, and &quot;USA Today&quot;.

Carlton independently produced her next two albums, &quot;Rabbits on the Run&quot; (2011) and &quot;Liberman&quot; (2015), which were acclaimed by critics for both its personal subject matter and departure from her previous musical style. She released her sixth studio album &quot;Love Is an Art&quot; in 2020, and has additionally released the EPs &quot;Hear The Bells&quot; (2012) and &quot;Blue Pool&quot; (2015). She made her Broadway debut with a leading role in the Carole King musical in 2019.

==Early life==
Carlton was born on August 16, 1980, in Milford, Pennsylvania, the first of three children of Edmund &quot;Ed&quot; Carlton, a pilot, and Heidi Lee, a pianist and school music teacher. She has a sister, Gwen, and a brother, Edmund. Carlton’s mother comes from a Jewish family in Queens, New York. Her interest in music began at an early age. At the age of two she visited Disneyland, and played &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World&quot; on the piano when she came home. Her mother began to tutor her, and she was introduced to classical music. By the age of 9 she had become passionate about ballet, and in 1994, aged 14, she enrolled at the School of American Ballet.

Carlton has experienced depression and bouts of bulimia and has spoken publicly regarding these subjects.

After graduating, she sang in nightclubs and began to feel comfortable on stage. She later moved to New York City, where she attended Columbia University for one year before dropping out and had a stint as a waitress in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen.

== Career ==
===2002–2003: &quot;Be Not Nobody&quot;===
Carlton met songwriter/producer Peter Zizzo at a singer-songwriter circle and was invited to his studio to record a demo. Three months later she was signed by Jimmy Iovine to A&amp;M Records and began work on an album of her songs, to be titled &quot;Rinse&quot;. This album was never released, but a few tracks were reworked for &quot;Be Not Nobody&quot;. One song, &quot;Carnival&quot;, was re-recorded as &quot;Dark Carnival&quot; for the video game &quot;SpyHunter 2&quot;. Other tracks from &quot;Rinse&quot; were &quot;Interlude&quot; (later known as &quot;A Thousand Miles&quot;), &quot;Rinse&quot;, &quot;Ordinary Days&quot; (later known as &quot;Ordinary Day&quot;), &quot;Twilight&quot;, &quot;Pretty Baby&quot;, &quot;All I Ask&quot;, and &quot;Superhero&quot;. The first five of these were included in her first album, &quot;Be Not Nobody&quot;, together with a cover of the Jagger/Richards song &quot;Paint It Black&quot;. Other unreleased tracks from her early demo tapes include &quot;Faces&quot;, &quot;Meggie Sue&quot;, &quot;Little Mary&quot;, &quot;Burden&quot;, &quot;Wonder&quot;, &quot;Devil Dance&quot;, and &quot;Last Fall&quot;.

After hearing Carlton&#x27;s demo of &quot;A Thousand Miles&quot;, A&amp;M president Ron Fair organized recording sessions and produced and arranged the song himself. &quot;A Thousand Miles&quot; became a hit, peaking in the top five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and went on to become the sixth-most-played song of the year. It garnered Grammy Award nominations for &quot;Record of the Year&quot;, &quot;Song of the Year&quot;, and &quot;Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s).&quot; Fair produced the rest of the album. The tracks were recorded in Los Angeles at IGA Studios, Santa Monica; Henson Studios, Hollywood; and Royaltone Studios, Burbank. Carlton played piano and sang vocals; other instrumentation included a backing band, a 60-piece orchestra and sitar on &quot;Paint It Black&quot;.

&quot;Be Not Nobody&quot; was released in April 2002 and appeared at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart with 102,000 units sold. It went on to sell more than two million copies worldwide. Two more singles, &quot;Ordinary Day&quot; and &quot;Pretty Baby&quot;, were released. Carlton toured the US in 2002 to promote the album, opening for the Goo Goo Dolls and Third Eye Blind, before headlining her own tour at the end of 2002 and touring Europe in 2003.

Carlton collaborated with other artists before the release of her second album. She provided the descant vocals for the Counting Crows version of the Joni Mitchell song &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot;, played piano for Italian singer Zucchero, along with Haylie Ecker on violin for the song &quot;Indaco Dagli Occhi Del Cielo&quot;, and provided backing vocals for &quot;Moving On&quot; by Kimya Dawson for her album &quot;Hidden Vagenda&quot;.

===2004–2005: &quot;Harmonium&quot;===
Carlton&#x27;s second album, &quot;Harmonium&quot;, was released in November 2004. &quot;Harmonium&quot; debuted at number 33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and descended quickly after, selling fewer than 150,000 copies by February 2006, which was considered a disappointment after her successful debut. The album was produced by Stephan Jenkins from rock band Third Eye Blind, and included darker themes than those on her debut album. Carlton and Jenkins had met and begun a relationship in mid-2002, when she and Third Eye Blind, of which Jenkins was lead singer, were on tour together. After seeing Carlton perform live Jenkins offered to produce her music, and according to Carlton they decided very quickly that they had the same vision for the album. Carlton credited Jenkins with helping her to withstand pressure from record label executives who wanted to influence the recording. She said later that her label &quot;wasn&#x27;t very happy&quot; about the decisions she made during the making of the album.

Carlton stated that &quot;Harmonium&quot; contained more of her own aesthetic than &quot;Be Not Nobody&quot;. A single, &quot;White Houses&quot;, released to radio in late August 2004, peaked at number 86 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. MTV censored and later banned the single&#x27;s music video because of a controversial lyric in the song that refers to sexual intercourse. Carlton attributed the censoring of the song to the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy involving Janet Jackson which had occurred earlier that year. She embarked on a four-week North American concert tour in October and November 2004, with an opening act of Low Millions, and performed a second tour in March and April the following year, with Cary Brothers and Ari Hest as supporting acts.

Carlton left A&amp;M Records in mid-2005, feeling that her nonconformist attitude would create problems for her at the label. A&amp;M Records had sent Carlton into the recording studio because they wanted to re-release &quot;Harmonium&quot;, whereas Carlton felt the album should be promoted as it was. She decided to leave the label to find another record deal once promotion for &quot;Harmonium&quot; had ended. While in the studio she wrote songs with Linda Perry and The Matrix. In the same period she collaborated with the Italian singer Zucchero Fornaciari featuring his song &quot;Indaco Dagli Occhi Del Cielo&quot; (cover of the well known &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got to Learn Sometime&quot;), together with the violinist Haylie Ecker, in the album &quot;Zu &amp; Co.&quot;

===2006–2008: &quot;Heroes and Thieves&quot;===

In August 2005, Carlton said she was to enter the recording studio the following month with producer Linda Perry, with whom she had previously collaborated after executives at A&amp;M Records sent her into the studio to record a re-release single for &quot;Harmonium&quot;. The album was influenced by Carlton&#x27;s breakup with its co-producer, Stephan Jenkins, and Carlton said that one of the reasons they remained friends was that &quot;nothing took precedence over the music ... No matter what was going on in the emotional realm, all we cared about was the album. It created this kinetic environment that was kind of like Fleetwood Mac. It made for better music.&quot;

&quot;Heroes &amp; Thieves&quot; was released and greeted with generally positive reviews. It debuted at number 44 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, &quot;Nolita Fairytale&quot; was the first single and peaked at number 26 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Top 40 Tracks chart. To promote the album, Carlton embarked on the Haunted Club Tour, from November 2 to 24, 2007. Second single &quot;Hands on Me&quot; was sent out to radio in February 2008 and reached number 30 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Top 40 Tracks chart. One song on the album was &quot;Spring Street&quot;, based on Spring Street in SoHo in Manhattan. Carlton parted amicably with The Inc. once her promotional commitments to &quot;Heroes &amp; Thieves&quot; had passed.

She contributed a stripped-down version of the song &quot;More than This&quot; to &quot;Songs for Tibet&quot;, an album compiled in support of Tibet to draw attention to its human rights situation. On September 25, 2008, Carlton and several other musicians and scientists departed on a nine-day trip to the Arctic Circle. On behalf of the charity Cape Farewell, they worked alongside researchers for the purpose of studying climate change. Carlton had been a part for PETA&#x27;s Animal Birth Control Campaign; she owns a long haired dachshund named Lord Victor.

===2009–2012: &quot;Rabbits on the Run&quot; and &quot;Hear the Bells&quot;===

Carlton&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Rabbits on the Run&quot; was released on July 26, 2011, under Razor &amp; Tie, the third record label she signed with, and received praise from music critics who particularly noted its &quot;strikingly personal&quot; subject material. Before recording the album, Carlton was unsure whether she wanted to make another record or pursue film scoring instead. After deciding to try again, she decided that she needed to record in the ideal environment, choosing to record at Real World Studios Box, England. She chose the title for the symbolism often depicted by rabbits—&#x27;time slipping, mind floating&#x27;—which is something she has been relating to for the past few years. The album was further inspired by Stephen Hawking&#x27;s &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot; and Richard Adams&#x27;s &quot;Watership Down&quot;. The dreamy, fantastical sound of the album was achieved by recording direct to tape and features production by Steve Osborne.

The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Carousel&quot; was released on May 3. On September 19, a tweet on Carlton&#x27;s account made by her management stated that &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Be a Bride&quot; would be the next single off the record. Via Twitter, Carlton announced that her label would not produce a video for &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Be a Bride&quot;, instead producing one for &quot;Hear the Bells&quot;. The music video, which Carlton describes as her most revealing to date, was released on June 7, 2012.

On November 10, a tweet made by Carlton&#x27;s management announced the upcoming release of her holiday EP titled &quot;Hear the Bells&quot; on November 21. The EP consists of four tracks, two of which are acoustic versions of Carlton&#x27;s songs &quot;Hear the Bells&quot; and &quot;A Thousand Miles&quot;.

===2012–2016: &quot;Liberman&quot; and &quot;Blue Pool&quot; ===

Carlton announced in late 2012 that she had returned to Real World Studios to commence work on a new album with a theme of euphoria. On a small tour in late 2013, Carlton teased new songs &quot;Willows&quot;, &quot;House Of Seven Swords&quot;, &quot;A Matter Of Time&quot;, &quot;Take It Easy&quot; and &quot;Unlock The Lock&quot;.

On February 28, 2014, Carlton announced that she had finished recording the ten-track album, which was to be titled &quot;Liberman&quot;, and on April 11, 2014, she reported that &quot;Liberman&quot; was being mastered. Carlton&#x27;s 2014 summer tour supported the Barefoot Wine Beach Project, which encouraged people to clean the beach and keep it safe for wildlife. She performed a track titled &quot;Willows&quot; to promote the events for Fox New York TV, which she said was about the trees she had loved when she was growing up, and she revealed that &quot;Liberman&quot; would be released in 2015. In an interview with CBS News published on June 11, 2014, Carlton described the album as &quot;kind of lush, trippy and beautiful...You really feel like you&#x27;re falling into a rabbit hole of sounds.&quot; She said: &quot;It&#x27;s pretty short, it&#x27;s 10 songs. It&#x27;s meant to be listened to through your headphones.&quot;

&quot;Liberman&quot; was positively received, and like its preceding album, was also praised for touching on personal subjects for the singer. Writing for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, Ken Capobianco said the material &quot;finds her a long way from &#x27;A Thousand Miles&#x27; – and in a better place, artistically.&quot; Matthew Schnipper of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that &quot;Carlton&#x27;s voice is the key attraction on songs [from &quot;Liberman&quot;] that register between low-key pop, rock, and folk.&quot;

On April 20, 2015, it was announced that Carlton had signed with Dine Alone Records to release &quot;Liberman&quot; in October 2015. &quot;Esquire&quot; premiered &quot;Young Heart&quot;, a song not expected to be included on the album, which was released as a &quot;pre-release single&quot;. On June 15, 2015, Carlton released the song &quot;Blue Pool&quot; through &quot;Nylon&quot; magazine&#x27;s website. The song was included on the &quot;Blue Pool EP&quot;, released digitally on July 24, 2015. The songs on the EP were part of a deluxe version of the &quot;Liberman&quot; album. On August 3, 2015, &quot;Southern Living&quot; premiered the official music video for &quot;Blue Pool&quot;. On August 27, 2015, &quot;USA Today&quot; premiered the official lyric video for &quot;Willows&quot;. The album artwork for &quot;Liberman&quot; was revealed, along with its release date of October 23, 2015.

Carlton released &quot;Liberman Live&quot; on October 21, 2016. The album consisted of eight live tracks recorded in Nashville, Tennessee, while on tour.

=== 2017–present: &quot;Love Is an Art&quot; and Broadway debut ===

On February 17, 2017, Carlton released another live album titled &quot;Earlier Things Live&quot; via her own Victor Music label. It included six songs from albums that were released pre-&quot;Liberman&quot; and were played live throughout 2015–2016 on the &quot;Liberman&quot; tour. Carlton performed a song titled &quot;Love Is An Art&quot; throughout 2017, and stated that this might be the title of her next album. She began writing songs for the album, her sixth, in June 2017.

On December 25, 2018, Carlton posted on Instagram saying that she would start recording the album on January 23, 2019. In March 2018, she began to release one cover song a month while she worked on the album. The first of six songs, a cover of &quot;Call Your Girlfriend&quot; by Robyn, was released digitally March 23, 2018. The second, a cover of Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Dreams&quot; was released April 20, 2018. The third, a cover of Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart&quot; was released May 18, 2018. The fourth cover, Fred Neil&#x27;s &quot;Little Bit of Rain&quot; was released on June 15, 2018. The fifth cover, &quot;Needle in the Hay&quot; by Elliott Smith was released on July 20, 2018. The sixth and final cover song, &quot;Lonely Girls&quot; by Lucinda Williams was released on August 10, 2018. She released the covers EP as a triple vinyl collection, along with the &quot;Liberman Live&quot; and &quot;Earlier Things Live&quot; EPs, on November 23, 2018.

In May 2019, Carlton was announced to be making her Broadway debut with a lead role in the Carole King musical &quot;Beautiful&quot;, performing for a limited season from June 27. Speaking of her first time performing on Broadway, Carlton said: &quot;It was emotional for me to get through the show the first time, it’s a lot of work. And it was so exhilarating. And it just kind of worked out. I just cried at the end. ‘I did it! Now I have to do it 79 more times. How is this going to happen?&#x27;” Mark Kennedy of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; believed that the role marked &quot;another fascinating turn&quot; in Carlton&#x27;s career.

On May 27, 2019, Carlton announced via Instagram that her sixth album, produced by Dave Fridmann, was to be titled &quot;Love is an Art&quot;. The album was mastered the same day. &quot;Love is an Art&quot; was released on March 27, 2020. Carlton revealed via Twitter in January 2021 that she planned to re-release the album in March 2021 with new songs and demo recordings from the album&#x27;s studio sessions. 

In 2023, she went viral when a puppet sang her famous song &quot;A Thousand Miles&quot;. The puppeteer, Ben Howard, was recognized by Carlton when he brought the puppet to one of her concerts to perform. Howard said, &quot;She really seemed to love it.&quot;

During 2024 Vanessa &amp; her husband John Joseph McCauley III of the band &#x27;Deer Tick&#x27; created the score for the upcoming film &#x27;Wish You Were Here&#x27;. The film is directed by Vanessa&#x27;s longtime friend, actress Julia Stiles and was released in January 2025.

==Personal life==
In 2005, Carlton completed the New York City Marathon and donated the pledge money she collected to Musicians on Call, a nonprofit organization that brings live and recorded music to patients&#x27; bedsides.

On June 19, 2010, Carlton came out as bisexual while headlining Nashville Pride. She stated to the attending audience, &quot;I&#x27;ve never said this before, but I am a proud bisexual woman.&quot;

On October 9, 2013, at a live performance in Bay Shore, New York, Carlton announced that she was expecting her first child with her fiancé John McCauley (of the band Deer Tick). In November, she announced she had experienced an ectopic pregnancy, in which she later suffered a ruptured tube and internal bleeding. After surgery, her entire right fallopian tube was removed. On December 27, 2013, Carlton and McCauley married in a ceremony officiated by Stevie Nicks. On June 26, 2014, Carlton announced via Facebook that the release of &quot;Liberman&quot; would be delayed until the summer of 2015 because she was expecting a child with McCauley. On January 13, 2015, Carlton gave birth to their daughter, who was named Sidney Aoibheann Carlton-McCauley.

Carlton lived in Nashville with her family until 2021. She currently lives in Warwick, Rhode Island.

<text>Another Bad Creation (sometimes called ABC for short) was an American hip hop and new jack swing group from Atlanta who were active in the early 1990s.

==History==
ABC consisted of David &quot;Li&#x27;l Dave&quot; Shelton (b. November 11, 1982 from Boston, Massachusetts), cousins Romelle &quot;RoRo&quot; Chapman (b. June 15, 1978 from Atlanta, Georgia) and Christopher &quot;Chris&quot; Sellers (b. October 19, 1978 from Cleveland, Ohio), and brothers from Atlanta, Georgia Demetrius &quot;Red&quot; (b. September 23, 1979) and Marliss &quot;Mark&quot; (b. April 15, 1982) Pugh, as well as Adrian &quot;G.A.&quot; (General Austin) Witcher (b. September 7, 1978). They were discovered by Michael Bivins.
ABC&#x27;s debut album &quot;Coolin&#x27; at the Playground Ya Know!&quot; was released on February 11, 1991. The album&#x27;s two biggest singles were the first and second singles: &quot;Iesha&quot; and &quot;Playground&quot; respectively, which reached the top ten on both the R&amp;B and pop charts (the latter was also the group&#x27;s only showing on the Dance chart). A cover of New Edition&#x27;s song &quot;Jealous Girl&quot; followed, as well as the singles &quot;Spydermann&quot; and &quot;My World&quot;. The album reached #7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and eventually went platinum.

During this time, Mark and Dave appeared among other children (including Macaulay Culkin) in a scene of Michael Jackson&#x27;s video &quot;Black or White&quot;. Also during the same time, all the members of ABC made their only movie appearance to date, as characters in &quot;The Meteor Man&quot; (which also featured appearances from various other musicians). They dyed their hair blonde for the movie, a style they also showcased in the video for the East Coast Family&#x27;s only collective song, &quot;1-4-All-4-1&quot;.

On March 3, 1991, Another Bad Creation appeared on the sketch comedy show &quot;In Living Color&quot; singing &quot;Iesha&quot;. Keenen Ivory Wayans introduced them by comparing them to The Jackson 5, New Edition, and The Boys. 

ABC&#x27;s second album &quot;It Ain&#x27;t What U Wear, It&#x27;s How U Play It&quot; was released on September 21, 1993. The album and the singles did not chart on a Billboard chart.

<doc id="584496" wikidata="Q352561" url="?curid=584496" title="Ihara Saikaku">
<text>was a Japanese poet and creator of the &quot;floating world&quot; genre of Japanese prose (&quot;ukiyo-zōshi&quot;).

His born name may have been Hirayama Tōgo (平山藤五), the son of a wealthy merchant in Osaka, and he first studied haikai poetry under a follower of Matsunaga Teitoku and later studied under Nishiyama Sōin of the Danrin school of poetry, which emphasized comic linked verse. Scholars have described numerous extraordinary feats of solo haikai composition at one sitting; most famously, over the course of a single day and night in 1677 Saikaku is known to have composed 1,600 haikai verses and an amazing 23,500 verses in a single day and night in 1684.

Later in life he began writing racy accounts of the financial and amorous affairs of the merchant class and the demimonde. These stories catered to the whims of the newly prominent merchant class, whose tastes of entertainment leaned toward the arts and pleasure districts.

==Biography==
Ihara Saikaku was born in 1642 into a well-off merchant family in Osaka. From the age of fifteen he composed haikai no renga (linked verse). In 1662 at the age of twenty he became a haikai master. Under the pen name Ihara Kakuei, he began to establish himself as a popular haikai poet. By 1670 he had developed his own distinctive style, using colloquial language to depict contemporary chōnin life. During this time he owned and ran a medium-sized business in Osaka.

In 1673 he changed his pen name to Saikaku. However, the death of his dearly beloved wife in 1675 had an extremely profound impact on him. A few days after her death, in an act of grief and true love, Saikaku started to compose a thousand-verse haikai poem over twelve hours. When this work was published it was called &quot;Haikai Single Day Thousand Verse&quot; (&quot;Haikai Dokugin Ichinichi&quot;). It was the first time that Saikaku had attempted to compose such a lengthy piece of literature. The overall experience and success that Saikaku received from composing such a mammoth exerise has been credited with sparking the writer&#x27;s interest in writing novels.

Shortly after his wife&#x27;s death, the grief-stricken Saikaku decided to become a lay monk and began to travel all across Japan, thus leaving behind his three children (one of whom was blind) to be cared for by his extended family and his business by his employees. He started his travels after the death of his blind daughter.

In 1677 Saikaku returned to Osaka and had learned of the success his thousand-verse haikai poem had received. From then on he pursued a career as a professional writer. Initially Saikaku continued to produce haikai poetry, but by 1682 he had published &quot;The Life of an Amorous Man&quot;, the first of his many works of prose fiction.

As Saikaku&#x27;s popularity and readership began to increase and expand across Japan, so did the amount of literature he published. When he died in 1693, at the age of fifty-one, Saikaku was one of the most popular writers of the entire Tokugawa period. At the time his work was never considered &quot;high&quot; literature because it had been aimed towards and popularised by the &quot;chōnin&quot;. Nevertheless, Saikaku&#x27;s work is now celebrated for its significance in the development of Japanese fiction.

==Sample prose==
:&quot;Men take their misfortunes to heart, and keep them there. A gambler does not talk about his losses; the frequenter of brothels, who finds his favorite engaged by another, pretends to be just as well off without her; the professional street-brawler is quiet about the fights he has lost; and a merchant who speculates on goods will conceal the losses he may suffer. All act as one who steps on dog dung in the dark.&quot; —Ihara Saikaku, &quot;What the Seasons Brought to the Almanac-Maker&quot; (1686)

:&quot;In view of our years of intimacy, I am deeply hurt that you should hesitate to die with me. Lest it prove to be a barrier to my salvation in the next life, I decided to include in this final testament all of the grudges against you that have accumulated in me since we first met. First: I made my way at night to your distant residence a total of 327 times over the past three years. Not once did I fail to encounter trouble of some kind. To avoid detection by patrols making their nightly rounds, I disguised myself as a servant and hid my face behind my sleeve, or hobbled along with a cane and lantern dressed like a priest. No one knows the lengths I went to in order to meet you!&quot; —Ihara Saikaku, &quot;Love Letter Sent in a Sea Bass&quot; (1687)

<text>James Walter &quot;Jim&quot; Christy (born September 15, 1938) is an American astronomer known for discovering Charon, the largest moon of the dwarf planet Pluto.

== Early years ==
Christy was born in 1938 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He attended the University of Arizona and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in astronomy from there in 1965.

== Career ==
On June 22, 1978 while working at the United States Naval Observatory, he discovered that Pluto had a moon, which he named Charon shortly afterwards. The name remained unofficial until its adoption by the IAU in 1986.

The discovery was made by carefully examining an enlargement of a photographic plate of Pluto and noticing it had a very slight bulge on one side. This plate and others had been marked &quot;poor&quot; because the elongated image of Pluto was thought to be a defect resulting from improper alignment. The 1965 plates included a note &quot;Pluto image elongated&quot;, but observatory astronomers, including Christy, assumed that the plates were defective until 1978.

However, Christy noticed that only Pluto was elongated—the background stars were not. His earlier work at the Naval Observatory had included photographing double stars, so it occurred to him that this bulge might be a companion of Pluto. After examining images from observatory archives dating back to 1965, he concluded that the bulge was indeed a moon.

The photographic evidence was considered convincing but not conclusive (it remained possible that the bulge was due to Pluto having an unexpectedly irregular shape). However, based on Charon&#x27;s calculated orbit, a series of mutual eclipses of Pluto and Charon was predicted and observed, confirming the discovery.

In more modern telescopes, such as the Hubble Space Telescope or ground-based telescopes using adaptive optics, separate images of Pluto and Charon can be resolved, and the &quot;New Horizons&quot; probe took images showing some of Charon&#x27;s surface features.

In late 2008, the asteroid 129564 Christy was named in his honor. As of 2015, he resides in Flagstaff, Arizona. He has been married to Charlene Mary since 1975 and has four children. On July 14, 2015, he and Clyde Tombaugh&#x27;s children were guests at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory when the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft successfully performed the first flyby of the Pluto-Charon system.

Christy&#x27;s inspiration for the name &quot;Charon&quot; came about due to a personal interest in naming the moon after his wife. He used her nickname, &quot;Char&quot; for Charlene, and added -on (for his interest in physics in protons and electrons, which have -on endings) to make Charon. It was only later that he found the same name in mythology, that being the ferryman who carried souls across the Acheron River, one of the five mythical rivers that surrounded Pluto&#x27;s underworld.

<doc id="584504" wikidata="Q574427" url="?curid=584504" title="Metaphase">
<text>Metaphase ( and ) is a stage of mitosis in the eukaryotic cell cycle in which chromosomes are at their second-most condensed and coiled stage (they are at their most condensed in anaphase). These chromosomes, carrying genetic information, align in the equator of the cell between the spindle poles at the metaphase plate, before being separated into each of the two daughter nuclei. This alignment marks the beginning of metaphase. Metaphase accounts for approximately 4% of the cell cycle&#x27;s duration. 

In metaphase, microtubules from both duplicated centrosomes on opposite poles of the cell have completed attachment to kinetochores on condensed chromosomes. The centromeres of the chromosomes convene themselves on the metaphase plate, an imaginary line that is equidistant from the two spindle poles. This even alignment is due to the counterbalance of the pulling powers generated by the opposing kinetochore microtubules, analogous to a tug-of-war between two people of equal strength, ending with the destruction of B cyclin. 

In order to prevent deleterious nondisjunction events, a key cell cycle checkpoint, the spindle checkpoint, verifies this evenly balanced alignment and ensures that every kinetochore is properly attached to a bundle of microtubules and is under balanced bipolar tension. Sister chromatids require active separase to hydrolyze the cohesin that bind them together prior to progression to anaphase. Any unattached or improperly attached kinetochores generate signals that prevent the activation of the anaphase promoting complex (cyclosome or APC/C), a ubiquitin ligase which targets securin and cyclin B for degradation via the proteosome. As long as securin and cyclin B remain active, separase remains inactive, preventing premature progression to anaphase.

==Metaphase in cytogenetics and cancer studies==
The analysis of metaphase chromosomes is one of the main tools of classical cytogenetics and cancer studies. Chromosomes are condensed (thickened) and highly coiled in metaphase, which makes them most suitable for visual analysis. Metaphase chromosomes make the classical picture of chromosomes (karyotype). For classical cytogenetic analyses, cells are grown in short term culture and arrested in metaphase using mitotic inhibitor. Further they are used for slide preparation and banding (staining) of chromosomes to be visualised under microscope to study structure and number of chromosomes (karyotype). Staining of the slides, often with Giemsa (G banding) or Quinacrine, produces a pattern of in total up to several hundred bands. Normal metaphase spreads are used in methods like FISH and as a hybridization matrix for comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) experiments.

Malignant cells from solid tumors or leukemia samples can also be used for cytogenetic analysis to generate metaphase preparations. Inspection of the stained metaphase chromosomes allows the determination of numerical and structural changes in the tumor cell genome, for example, losses of chromosomal segments or translocations, which may lead to chimeric oncogenes, such as bcr-abl in chronic myelogenous leukemia.

<doc id="584514" wikidata="Q1104627" url="?curid=584514" title="Book of the Law of the Lord">
<text>The Book of the Law of the Lord is a sacred book of scripture used by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), a sect of the Latter Day Saint movement. It is alleged to be a translation by the Strangite prophet James Strang of the brass Plates of Laban, which were originally acquired by Nephi, a leading figure in the early portion of the Book of Mormon. Strang claimed to have translated them using the Urim and Thummim, which Mormons believe was used by Joseph Smith to translate the Book of Mormon from ancient gold plates. Strang&#x27;s followers believe that while the Book of the Law was lost to the Old World during Israel&#x27;s captivity in foreign lands, a copy was included in the plates that the ancient prophet Nephi took with him to the New World.

The book contains an elaborate constitution for a theocratic kingdom, in which the prophet-leader of the Latter Day Saint church equally rules as king over God&#x27;s kingdom on earth. The expanded version also contains various other revelations and teachings added by Strang to explain it.

The Book of the Law of the Lord was not viewed as a sacred text by any Mormon denomination other than the Strangite church, until April 6, 2019 when the Church of Jesus Christ in Christian Fellowship voted it in as canon.

==James J. Strang==

James J. Strang was a lawyer and newspaper editor from New York who converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1844. Shortly after his baptism, Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, was murdered by a mob. Strang was one of three individuals who claimed the leadership role after Smith&#x27;s death, but as a recent convert he did not possess the name recognition among rank-and-file Mormons held by his rivals Brigham Young and Sidney Rigdon. Hence, he faced an uphill battle in his quest to be recognized as the heir to Smith&#x27;s prophetic mantle. 

To advance his cause, Strang asserted that unlike Rigdon and Young, &quot;he&quot; had hard evidence of his prophetic calling. In September 1845, he announced the discovery of the Voree Record. This was presented as the final testament of Rajah Manchou of Vorito, an ancient inhabitant of the area, engraved on three brass plates that Strang dug up near Voree, Wisconsin. However, Strang&#x27;s claims to possession of divinely-revealed ancient records, and the ability to correctly translate them, did not end there. In 1851, he proclaimed the publication of the Book of the Law of the Lord, a far more substantial work.

==Alleged provenance of the book==

Strang explained that the Book of the Law, as it is often called, was &quot;kept in the Ark of the Covenant, and was held too sacred to go into the hands of strangers.&quot; However, &quot;when the Septuagint translation was made, the Book of the Law was kept back, and ... lost to the Jewish nation in the time that they were subject to foreign powers.&quot; Thus, &quot;the various books in the Pentateuch, containing abstracts of some of the laws, have been read instead of it, until even the existence of the book has come to be a matter of doubt.&quot; While it is not stated directly, this implies that this book is the original Torah. 

Strang did not claim that his 1851 edition was the complete Book of the Law mentioned in the Hebrew scriptures, but rather that it contained only selections that were pertinent for running the church and kingdom in the modern era. His 1856 expanded edition contains the same translation as the 1851 edition, but with added essays written by Strang and several modern revelations. Strangites also identify the Book of the Law with the &quot;Stick of Judah&quot; mentioned in . While other Latter Day Saint sects generally view the &quot;Stick of Judah&quot; as the Canonical Bible, Strangites assert that it refers primarily to this lost book. 

==Witnesses==

Seven witnesses testified to having seen and handled the plates that Strang claimed to possess. They described them as being eighteen in number, each measuring approximately seven and three-eighths inches wide, by nine inches long. Their brazen surfaces were &quot;occasionally embellished with beautiful pictures,&quot; and all appeared to be of &quot;beautiful antique workmanship, bearing a striking resemblance to the ancient oriental languages.&quot;

The witnesses of the plates were: Samuel Graham, Samuel P. Bacon, Warren Post, Phineas Wright, Albert N. Hosmer, Ebenezer Page, and Jehiel Savage. Wright and Post served as apostles in Strang&#x27;s church. Post wrote in his journal that the plates weighed approximately six pounds. Although some of these witnesses later left Strang&#x27;s church, none of them is known to have ever denied their testimony as given in the Book of the Law.

==Allegations of witness denials==

Although there is no evidence to support them, several opponents from other Latter Day Saint churches have sought to cast doubt on the witness testimonies by claiming to have heard the witnesses deny their testimonies decades before. LDS Church apologist Daniel C. Peterson claims, without citing a source, that Samuel Graham admitted to helping Strang fabricate the plates. Hearsay testimonies were commonly asserted to discredit the leaders of rival churches, including both James Strang and Joseph Smith.

In addition, Chauncy Loomis, in an 1888 letter to Joseph Smith III, reported that Samuel Bacon discovered &quot;fragments of those plates which Strang made the Book of the Law from&quot; hidden in the ceiling of Strang&#x27;s house, prompting Bacon to immediately relocate off Beaver Island and abandon the Strangite church. However, there are no journal entries, letters, or any other corroborating witnesses to support this claim, and Loomis did not tell anyone for over 30 years, casting further doubt on the story. Additionally, when Strang died, the Mormons&#x27; enemies from nearby Mackinac forced the Saints to leave Beaver Island and moved into their houses, and no one ever reported finding plate fragments during subsequent renovations.

Strang claimed to have returned the brass plates to the angel after completing the translation in 1851, much like his predecessor did with the gold plates, and to this day, no plates or plate fragments from them have ever been found.

==Editions of 1851 and 1856==
The Book of the Law of the Lord was published in two separate editions during Strang&#x27;s lifetime. The first edition of 1851 contained only eighty pages and consisted of material translated directly from the Plates of Laban, with five exceptions: three revelations given to Strang, and two sections written &quot;by inspiration of God.&quot;

In contrast, the edition of 1856 comprised 320 pages. It included all of the text in the 1851 edition, plus ten new chapters and a series of notes added by Strang to explain the text. The 1856 edition is the one generally used by Strangites today. It was never bound with a title page or preface; subsequent reprints have used the title page, testimony and preface from the 1851 edition. In fact, the 1856 edition was not bound at all until after Strang&#x27;s death, as he was assassinated before this was completed. Its uncut sheets had to be rescued from an anti-Mormon mob by Strang&#x27;s disciples.

Both editions of the Book of the Law are dated according to the year of Strang&#x27;s reign, he having been crowned &quot;king&quot; of his church on Beaver Island in 1850. Hence the 1851 edition is annotated &quot;A. R. I,&quot; while the 1856 edition carries the date &quot;A. R. VI.&quot;

==Monarchy and priesthood==
The most distinctive element of the Book of the Law is its overtly monarchical tone. Also of interest are the singular subdivisions Strang makes within the Melchizedek priesthood, which his book refers to as &quot;The Priesthood of an endless life,&quot; and the Aaronic priesthood, referred to as &quot;the Priesthood of life.&quot;

In the Melchizedek priesthood, Strang enumerates two &quot;orders,&quot; that of &quot;apostles,&quot; and that of &quot;priests.&quot;

*&quot;Apostles&quot; are subdivided into four &quot;degrees:&quot;
**The Prophet/President of the Strangite church is openly referred to throughout the book as a &quot;King,&quot; rather than as a &quot;President&quot; (as under Joseph Smith).
**His Counselors are designated as &quot;Viceroys.&quot; The viceroys are also referred to as &quot;kings,&quot; though this does not indicate a share in the unique royal dignity accorded to the President/King.
**Strang&#x27;s Twelve Apostles are named as &quot;Princes in his Kingdom forever.&quot; The leader of Strang&#x27;s Apostles is designated as &quot;Prince and Grand Master of the Seventies.&quot;
**A quorum of &quot;Evangelists&quot; is established, to be Apostles to a single &quot;nation, kindred, tongue or people&quot;—unlike the Twelve, who were sent to all nations. Seven Evangelists formed a quorum, and Strang noted that such a body had never been organized &quot;in this dispensation.&quot; This priesthood office was unique to the Strangite organization, and does not correspond in any way to the office of evangelist or patriarch found in some other Latter Day Saint churches.
*&quot;Priests&quot; are subdivided into two &quot;degrees:&quot;
**High Priests were to include &quot;all inferiour Kings, Patriarchs, or heads of tribes, and Nobles, or heads of clans.&quot; Furthermore, Strang continued, &quot;They who hold it are called Sons of God.&quot; From this group, said the Book of the Law, the king was to select &quot;counsellors, judges and rulers.&quot;
**The &quot;degree&quot; of Elders included both the offices of Seventy and Elder as generally constituted in Joseph Smith&#x27;s church.

In the Aaronic priesthood, Strang enumerates three &quot;orders:&quot;
*Priests were to teach, preach and baptize, but not (as set out in the Doctrine and Covenants) to bless the sacrament; that was reserved to the High Priests of the Melchizedek Priesthood. They were subdivided into two &quot;courses,&quot; one of which (the Singers) was opened to women:
**&quot;Sacrificators,&quot; who were to kill sacrifices in accordance with appropriate provisions of the Book of the Law [see below under &quot;Animal sacrifice&quot;], and
**&quot;Singers,&quot; who were to sing during the various services to be held in Strangite temples (no such temple was ever constructed by the Strangites, nor were its services ever apparently composed).
*Teachers were not merely to instruct in spiritual matters, but secular ones as well; they were to staff schools throughout Strang&#x27;s kingdom. This office, like the office of Priest (Singer) was opened to women, and was subdivided into five degrees:
**Rabboni,
**Rabbi,
**Doctor,
**Ruler, and 
**Teacher.
*Deacons were to serve as &quot;Stewards and keepers of the King’s prisons, and Stewards of the King’s Courts.&quot; They were subdivided into three &quot;degrees:&quot; 
**Marshals,
**Stewards, and
**Ministers.

In addition, a &quot;King&#x27;s Council&quot; and a &quot;King&#x27;s Court&quot; were established. While no direct link is made between the King&#x27;s Court and the &quot;High Council&quot; established in the Doctrine and Covenants, certain parallels exist, such as requiring all members to hold the High Priesthood, and limiting their number to twelve.

Although Strang briefly enjoyed the services of apostle William Smith as &quot;Chief Patriarch&quot; of his church, he makes no mention of this office anywhere in his book.

==The Decalogue==
Another unique feature of the Book of the Law is its version of the Decalogue, the &quot;Ten Commandments&quot; given to Moses on Sinai. Strang&#x27;s rendering is different from any other Jewish, Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Islamic or Protestant version, for it offers a commandment none of the others has: &quot;Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.&quot; In his &quot;Note on the Decalogue,&quot; Strang asserted that no other version of the Decalogue contains more than nine commandments, and speculates that his fourth commandment was lost perhaps as early as Josephus&#x27;s time (circa AD 37–100).

==Ordination of women==
As noted above, the Book of the Law opened two priesthood offices to women: Priest and Teacher. While only the &quot;course&quot; of &quot;Singer&quot; in the office of Priest was open to females, all five &quot;degrees&quot; in the office of Teacher were available. Furthermore, they could serve as &quot;leaders&quot; of the Singers. Strang ordained women to these ministries as early as 1851, and permitted them to lecture in his School of the Prophets by 1856. In contrast, no other major Latter Day Saint faction opened their priesthood to women until the Community of Christ did so in 1984. Women are still barred from the LDS Church priesthood today.

==Animal sacrifice==
Animal sacrifice was instituted in the Book of the Law, both for forgiveness of sins and as a part of Strangite celebration rituals. However, given the prohibition on sacrifices for sin contained in 3 Nephi 9:19–20, Strang did not require sin offerings. Rather, he focused on sacrifice as an element of religious celebration, especially the commemoration of his own coronation as king (July 8, 1850). The head of every house, from the king to his lowest subject, was to offer &quot;a heifer, or a lamb, or a dove. Every man a clean beast, or a clean fowl, according to his household.&quot;

The killing of sacrifices was a prerogative of Strangite Priests, but female Priests were specifically barred from participating in this aspect of the priestly office.

&quot;Firstfruits&quot; offerings were also demanded of all Strangite agricultural harvests. Animal sacrifices are no longer practiced by the Strangites, though belief in their correctness is still required.

==Monotheism and the vocation of Jesus Christ==
Some of the teachings in the Book of the Law differed substantially from those held by other Mormon sects. For instance, in his &quot;Note on the Sacrifice of Christ&quot; and &quot;The True God,&quot; Strang rejected both the traditional Christian doctrine of the virgin birth of Jesus and the Mormon doctrine of the Godhead. He insisted that there was but one eternal God, the Father, and that progression to godhood, a doctrine taught by Joseph Smith in the King Follett sermon, was impossible. God had always been God, said Strang, and he was one person (not three, as in the traditional Christian Trinity).

Jesus Christ, said Strang, was the natural-born son of Mary and Joseph, who was chosen from before all time to be the Savior of mankind, but who had to be born as an ordinary mortal of two human parents (rather than being begotten by the Father or the Holy Spirit) to be able to truly fulfill his Messianic role. Strang claimed that the earthly Christ was in essence &quot;adopted&quot; as God&#x27;s son at birth, and fully revealed as such during the Transfiguration. After proving himself to God by living a perfectly sinless life, he was enabled to provide an acceptable sacrifice for the sins of men, prior to his resurrection and ascension.

Strang denied that God could do all things, and insisted that some things were as impossible for him as for us. Thus, he saw no essential conflict between science and religion, and while he never openly championed evolution, he did state that God was limited in his power by both the matter he was working with and by the eons of time required to &quot;organize&quot; and shape it. Strang spoke glowingly of a future generation who would &quot;make religion a science,&quot; to be &quot;studied by as exact rules as mathematicks.&quot; &quot;The mouth of the Seer will be opened,&quot; Strang prophesied, &quot;and the whole earth enlightened.&quot;

Musing at length on the nature of sin and evil, Strang wrote that of all things that God could give to man, he could never give him experience. Thus, if free will were to be real, said Strang, humanity must be given the opportunity to fail and to learn from its own mistakes. The ultimate goal for each human being was to willingly conform oneself to the revealed character of God in every respect, preferring good to evil not out of any fear of punishment or desire for reward, but rather &quot;on account of the innate loveliness of undefiled goodness; of pure unalloyed holiness.&quot;

==Other distinctive teachings==

The Book of the Law taught the seventh-day Sabbath, and commanded it in lieu of Sunday. It also accredits baptism for the dead, but on a much more limited scale than that currently practiced by the LDS Church. Baptisms for the dead are not performed by the Strangites today, although belief in the doctrine is still maintained.

Eternal marriage is taught in the Book of the Law, though it is not required to be performed in a temple. Strangite Priests, Elders, High Priests or Apostles may all perform this ceremony. Eternal marriages are still contracted in the Strangite church today.

Oaths are taken very seriously in the Book of the Law, and severe spiritual penalties are forewarned upon all who break their solemn word, once given.

The Book of the Law permits not only the blessing of others, but cursing, as well. Cursing is not to be done in anger, nor indiscriminately; rather, it is only to be &quot;invoked on such as, on deliberate and candid thought, are found condemned to them by the Law of God; and then the curse should be invoked as in the presence of God, the searcher of hearts; conscious that whosoever curses in the bitterness of his ... corrupt heart, and not in the light of God’s truth, the curse will return upon him.&quot; &quot;Maledictions&quot; are also to be performed by Strangite leaders upon &quot;hereticks, schismaticks, and those guilty of gross and abominable immoralities, and acts of great cruelty and wickedness.&quot; The Strangite practice of &quot;maledictions&quot; is comparable to the &quot;anathemas&quot; pronounced in the New Testament and by the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches.

Conservation of forests and resources is mandated in the Book of the Law. Groves of trees were to be maintained upon each farm, and in each village and town. Farms and cities without trees were required to plant them, and also to establish parklands so that &quot;the aged and the young may go there to rest and to play.&quot;

Strangites are prohibited by the Book of the Law from dressing ostentatiously. Various (today mostly obsolete) styles are banned, though allowance is made for those who are &quot;sojourning among Gentiles&quot; to &quot;imitate, to some moderate extent, their foolish and ridiculous styles, to avoid impertinent observations.&quot;

The Book of the Law sanctions marriage only between persons who are not impotent, deformed, of reduced stature (&quot;a dwarf&quot;), or mentally handicapped. &quot;The same means which will improve a breed of cattle,&quot; Strang wrote, &quot;will improve a race of men.&quot;

==Polygamy==
Plural marriage is sanctioned, though not expressly commanded, in the Book of the Law. The applicable text reads: &quot;Thou shalt not take unto thee a multitude of wives disproportioned to thy inheritance, and thy substance: nor shalt thou take wives to vex those thou hast; neither shalt thou put away one to take another.&quot; Any wife already married to the prospective polygamist was given the right to express her opinion, and even to object, but not to veto the marriage. This passage seems to offer any aggrieved wife an appeal to the &quot;Judges,&quot; but how this was to be carried out is not made clear. Women, on the other hand, were not permitted to marry multiple husbands.

Strang&#x27;s defense of polygamy was rather novel. He claimed that, far from enslaving or demeaning women, it liberated and &quot;elevated&quot; them by allowing them to choose the best possible mate based upon any factors deemed important to them—even if that mate were already married to someone else. Rather than being forced to wed &quot;corrupt and degraded sires&quot; due to the scarcity of more suitable men, a woman could wed the one she saw as the most compatible to herself, the best candidate to father her children and the man who could give her the best possible life, even if he already had wives. Strangites did not approve of having more wives than a man could provide for, both monetarily and in time and affection, thus they disapproved of the practices of the LDS Church.

The practice of plural marriage has never been officially proscribed in the Strangite church, though no Strangites are known to be practicing it today. Only 22 men in Strang&#x27;s church ever contracted plural marriages, with most of them taking only one additional wife. Strang took four additional wives, the most of any member.

Polygamy was practiced by a few Strangites up to the 1880s. Because United States federal and state laws prohibit the practice, Strangites have abandoned polygamy in favor of observing the divine injunction to obey &quot;the law of the land&quot;. However, belief in plural marriage&#x27;s correctness is still maintained.

Strangites reject the LDS Church&#x27;s 1843 polygamy revelation, regarding it as a forgery from 1852 that was never received or approved by Joseph Smith.

<text>Sharon Pratt (born January 30, 1944), formerly Sharon Pratt Dixon and Sharon Pratt Kelly, is an American attorney and politician who was the mayor of the District of Columbia from 1991 to 1995, the first mayor born in the District of Columbia since Richard Wallach who took office in 1861 and the first woman in that position.

==Personal life==
Sharon Pratt was born to D.C. Superior Court judge Carlisle Edward Pratt and Mildred &quot;Peggy&quot; (Petticord) Pratt. After her mother died of breast cancer, her grandmother, Hazel Pratt, and aunt, Aimee Elizabeth Pratt, helped to raise Sharon and her younger sister.

Pratt attended D.C. Public Schools Gage ES, Rudolph ES, MacFarland Junior High School, and Roosevelt HS (1961, with honors). She excelled at baseball but did not pursue the sport in adolescence. At Howard University she joined the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority (1964), and earned a B.A. in political science (1965). She received a J.D. degree from the Howard University School of Law in 1968. She married Arrington Dixon in 1966 and has two daughters with him; they divorced after sixteen years.

She campaigned and was elected and inaugurated mayor of DC as Sharon Pratt Dixon, but when she married James R. Kelly III, a New York businessman, on December 7, 1991, she changed her name to Sharon Pratt Kelly. After their 1999 divorce, she resumed her maiden name, Sharon Pratt.

Pratt is a member of The Links.

==Career==
Initially her political energies were drawn to national rather than local politics. She was a member of the Democratic National Committee from the District of Columbia (1977–1990), the first woman to hold that position. She was DNC Treasurer from 1985 to 1989.

At the 1980 Democratic National Convention, she was a member of the Ad Hoc Credentials Committee, member of the Judicial Council, and co-chairman of the Rules Committee. In 1982, she ran Patricia Roberts Harris&#x27; mayoral campaign in the D.C. election.

In 1983, she was made Vice President of Community Relations at Pepco, the D.C. electric utility. She became the first woman and first African American to serve in that role. The same year, she won the Presidential Award from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

===1990 mayoral election===

Upset with the decline of her hometown, Pratt announced at the 1988 Democratic National Convention that she would challenge incumbent mayor Marion Barry in the 1990 election. Pratt was the only candidate to have officially announced her plans to run for mayor when Barry was arrested on drug charges and dropped out of the race in early 1990. Shortly thereafter, the race was joined by longtime councilmembers John Ray, Charlene Drew Jarvis and David Clarke. Pratt criticized her three main opponents, referring to them as the &quot;three blind mice&quot; who &quot;saw nothing, said nothing and did nothing as the city rapidly decayed.&quot; She was the only candidate who called on Barry to resign from office, and ran specifically as an outsider to his political machine.

Following a series of televised debates during the last few weeks of the campaign, Pratt received the endorsement of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.&quot; &quot;The day the endorsement appeared, her poll numbers skyrocketed, with many political observers attributing the rise specifically to the &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s backing. On the eve of the election, polls showed Councilmember John Ray holding the lead, but Pratt gaining ground fast and a large margin of undecided voters remaining. However, even with the smallest campaign staff and least money, Pratt won the election, defeating second-place Ray by 10%. As Washington is a heavily Democratic city, her victory over the Republican candidate, former police chief Maurice T. Turner, Jr., in the November 6 general election was a foregone conclusion. She was sworn in as mayor of Washington on January 2, 1991.

==Mayor of the District of Columbia==
Once in office, Pratt&#x27;s grassroots, reform posture met resistance. She made good on her promises to clean house, requesting the resignations of all Barry appointees the day after her election; however, as she began to slash the city employment payroll, her political support began to weaken. She angered labor leaders who claimed she had promised not to fire union employees, and began mandating unpaid furloughs and wage freezes citywide. She took great pains to remove all of Barry&#x27;s political cronies, even though these layoffs hurt her administration as well. Kelly faced criticism due to accusations of being elitist, thus distancing her from poor and working-class blacks in the city.
Kelly was at odds with several D.C. Council members with her proposal to temporarily move the city government to the building at One Judiciary Square, ten blocks away from Washington&#x27;s incumbent city hall, the District Building, while the latter underwent renovations. When Kelly moved her office and administration departments to One Judiciary Square in 1992, the Council refused to leave the District Building, although they had approved the proposal that spring. In February 1993, after accusing Kelly of deliberately neglecting maintenance in order to force them out, they voted to take full and exclusive control of the District Building.

According to the &quot;Washington City Paper&quot;, Kelly &quot;was never able to get control of a city government still loyal to Barry, and she often mistrusted the advice she got from aides.&quot; In the spring of 1992, just over a year into her term, Barry loyalists mounted a recall campaign, which, although unsuccessful, weakened her administration and forced Kelly to tread more carefully with the public, backing away from her reform efforts.

===Statehood===

Kelly&#x27;s drive to achieve D.C. statehood in order to improve the District&#x27;s financial and political standing created fierce opposition from Republican members of Congress, who unleashed a barrage of attacks on the District as a &quot;national disgrace&quot; of &quot;one-party rule...massive dependency, hellish crime...and unrelenting scandal.&quot; The attacks brought unwelcome negative press to the District, and the ultimate failure in the House of Representatives of DC statehood legislation weakened her political capital. She lost standing with the D.C. Council when she supported Council member Linda Cropp to serve as acting Chair after the suicide of John A. Wilson in May 1993; instead, the Council chose John L. Ray. 

===Redskins stadium===
Kelly was blamed for the Washington Redskins moving out of the city. Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke attempted to pressure the city to build a new stadium to replace aging RFK Stadium, with the threat of moving the team to nearby Alexandria, Virginia. After negotiations stalled and Cooke was publicly courted by Virginia&#x27;s governor, Kelly denounced Cooke vocally, saying that &quot;I will not allow our good community to be steamrolled by a billionaire bully.&quot; She announced that she had offered as much as she was willing to offer the Redskins and would go no further. Although an agreement was ultimately reached, in 1993 Cooke withdrew from negotiations and moved the team to what is now Northwest Stadium (originally Jack Kent Cooke Stadium; later FedEx Field) in Landover, Maryland.

===City finances and re-election campaign===
Kelly began her term having extremely good relations with Congress, including successfully lobbying them to increase federal aid for D.C. by $100 million and to authorize the sale of $300 million in deficit reduction bonds. As fiscal year 1994 began for DC government (in October 1993), DC faced a $500 million budget deficit, with financial experts predicting that the city&#x27;s debt would reach $1 billion by 1999; the US Congress commissioned a federal audit of the city finances by the GAO.

In February 1994, in the face of a ballooning deficit, Kelly faced heavy criticism when &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that she regularly spent taxpayer funds on makeup for cable television appearances. Kelly was reported to have set aside $14,000 of city money to pay her makeup artist. In the weeks following, Kelly came under fire for other inappropriate uses of city funds, including the addition of bulletproof glass and a marble fireplace in her office and a series of 1993 televised town hall meetings that she had promised would be paid for with private financing.

The GAO&#x27;s report on DC finances was published on June 22, 1994, and estimated that the city would run out of money in two years and &quot;may be forced to borrow from the U.S. Treasury by fiscal year 1995.&quot; The report specifically singled out Kelly&#x27;s administration for gross mismanagement of city funds and agencies, and accused her of concealing the city&#x27;s perilous fiscal condition from Congress for two years, &quot;using gimmicks and violating the federal anti-deficiency act, which prohibits over-spending of a federally approved budget.&quot; The report, coupled with Congress&#x27; subsequent assertion of power over DC&#x27;s budget (including deep cuts and new requirements for mayoral compliance), provided political ammunition for her challengers and effectively destroyed Kelly&#x27;s reelection campaign.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot;, which had endorsed Kelly in 1990, instead in 1994 endorsed Councilman John Ray. In its endorsement, the &quot;Post&quot; reflected that Kelly &quot;has not been a coalition builder, which a mayor – and perhaps particularly the mayor of a city under enormous financial and social stress – needs to be...the most aggressive members of the city council, those most sympathetic to her cost-cutting message, are not with her. Nor are key elements in the business community. She has lost them and with them, we believe, her chance to enact the measures she has stood for.&quot;

In the Democratic primary that September, Kelly finished a distant third, with only about 13% of the vote. Barry won the primary and would go on to win the general election in November against an unusually strong Republican opponent, Carol Schwartz.

==Post-mayoral activities==
===Consulting===
In 2003, Pratt was awarded a $235,000 contract from the District of Columbia&#x27;s Department of Health to be the city&#x27;s main contact with federal homeland security agencies. The contract also calls for her to investigate improved communications and technology to protect the district from bioterrorism. Pratt was required to meet with senior federal officials and write a report on potential opportunities, especially resource-sharing agreements. She was also required to look for additional funding sources. Pratt&#x27;s firm, Pratt Consulting, does management consulting and works with federal, state, and local agencies and non-profit groups.

<doc id="584518" wikidata="Q2281650" url="?curid=584518" title="Rosslare Europort">
<text>Rosslare Europort () is a modern seaport located at Rosslare Harbour in County Wexford, Ireland, near the southeasternmost point of the island of Ireland. The port is the primary Irish port serving the European Continent with 36 direct services to the Continent weekly. It handles passenger and freight ferries to and from Cherbourg, Dunkirk, St Malo and Roscoff, in France, Bilbao in Spain and Fishguard and Pembroke Dock in the United Kingdom. Since July 2022, a new freight route between Rosslare and Zeebrugge, Belgium was introduced by Finnlines (Grimaldi Group) for a twice weekly ro-ro service between the two ports.

As a result of Brexit, the port is expanding rapidly, providing new or increased direct sailings with extra capacity from Ireland to mainland Europe. The direct routes between Ireland and the continent allow freight transport firms to bypass the UK land bridge, in case there is severe congestion at British ports.

The port, formerly called Rosslare Harbour, is operated by Iarnród Éireann, Ireland&#x27;s national railway operator. Wexford politicians Verona Murphy and James Browne maintain that if Rosslare is to take advantage of its new market opportunities and undergo radical expansion to handle container traffic, this will require large-scale investment.

Rosslare Europort has direct sailings into Cherbourg, Dunkirk, St Malo/Roscoff and Bilbao ports. As a result of new routes or increased frequency and capacity on existing routes, there are 36 direct services (freight and passenger) to and from Rosslare to continental Europe weekly, a six-fold increase on the 3 weekly sailings to mainland Europe in 2019. 

==Current services==

The port predominantly handles RORO (roll-on/roll-off) cargo ships and ROPAX (roll-on/roll-off) passenger and freight vessels. The harbour has four cargo berths and a fishing vessel berth. Passenger ferries operate to and from Fishguard (Stena Line) and Pembroke Dock (Irish Ferries) in Wales, and to Cherbourg (Stena Line and Brittany Ferries) in France. Brittany Ferries also operate from Rosslare to Bilbao in Spain. DFDS operates a freight-only service from Rosslare to Dunkirk with six sailings a week in each direction, On 4 March 2021, DFDS announced that the Dunkirk-Rosslare freight-only service would be increased to eight times a week from 1 April 2021. In February 2021, Brittany Ferries announced additional (freight-only) sailings one-way only from Roscoff to Rosslare Europort and from Rosslare to St Malo. From 7 April 2021, Irish Ferries is introducing a new twice-daily ship on the Rosslare–Pembroke route, which will be the fastest RORO vessel between Ireland and the UK (4 hours 01 minute), with capacity for 1,500 passengers, 100 freight vehicles and 700 cars depending on freight volume. From July 2022, a new freight route between Rosslare and Zeebrugge, Belgium was introduced by Finnlines, part of the Grimaldi Group, for a twice weekly ro-ro service between the two ports.

Rosslare Europort has a Border Inspection Post since 2019, crucial for the importation of agri-food, fish or live animal products. It is the only one in Ireland outside Dublin Port. It is currently based in a 16-acre site 2 km from the port. Uniquely for Ireland, the new Border Inspection Post will offer a one-stop service for hauliers, as all necessary checks will be conducted on the same site (customs, agricultural and health inspections), so inspectors come to the hauliers rather than vice versa, saving them time and money.

An advantage for Rosslare is that direct sailings allow drivers to take their rest periods during the crossing, rather than when they land in France or Spain. It appears that there is substantial demand from industry (manufacturers and producers) to use direct sailings to avoid the practical difficulties of using the landbridge such as documentation, redtape, inspections, and the need to use several IT systems. The same holds true for French business intent on avoiding Brexit-related delays and formalities by using the direct routes.

In March 2020 Brittany Ferries commenced the Rosslare-Bilbao service which runs twice weekly, this effectively replaced their Cork Santander service. Brittany Ferries also offer a seasonal service with Roscoff/St Malo in France.

Neptune lines include Rosslare in a loop service which includes Santander, Bristol, Le Havre, Southampton and Zeebrugge, which is used to import motor vehicles.

==Facilities==

Existing facilities in the terminal building include a cafe with shop, ferry company desks, car rental, and self-service left-luggage lockers. A viewing balcony and foot passenger lounge are to be found on the first floor. Railway services to Wexford, Wicklow and Dublin Connolly are located at Rosslare Europort railway station around a seven-minute walk in the open air along a specially marked path. Bus services to Wexford, and Waterford leave from just outside. Bus and rail connections to Cork, County Kerry, and Limerick, and bus connections to County Clare and Galway are available from Waterford whereas connections to Dublin are available at Wexford.

==Port details==
At Rosslare, Iarnród Éireann is an infrastructure provider and operator, providing port facilities and related services, including stevedoring, to shipping lines. Rosslare Europort is operated as a Common User Terminal, meaning that the port authority carries out all stevedoring activities on a common user basis for all shipping lines using the port.

The import and export of motor vehicles (trade cars) is one of the most important trades of the port. In excess of 25,000 vehicles are handled per annum. The importer depot is in Rosslare Harbour Village.

The port can accommodate cruise liners. Rosslare Europort was included in the 2020 schedule of the Phoenix Reisen-owned liner MS &quot;Deutschland&quot;.

An all-weather RNLI lifeboat is on station, and the Irish Coast Guard helicopter at Waterford Airport provides air-sea rescue cover. An automatic weather station is maintained adjacent to the port by Met Éireann.

The port area is largely on reclaimed land. Reclamation work continued to the late 1990s when the northwest part of the port was constructed using a dragline. Modernisation of facilities has continued to encourage the increase in cars carried on the ferries despite a drop in foot passengers.

Rosslare has also handled rolltrailer traffic in the recent past, when Cobelfret operated a service from Rosslare to Zeebrugge/Rotterdam (October 2008 to September 2009). Rolltrailers enable the carriage of lift-on lift-off (LoLo) traffic on roll-on roll-off (RoRo) ships.

Rosslare Europort is the second most strategically important seaport in the state after Dublin. It is the second-busiest port in terms of ship visits and gross tonnage, and handles more unitised freight than any other Irish seaport except Dublin – in fact, Rosslare handles more unitised freight than all other seaports in the state, excluding Dublin, put together. Unitised freight is important because all of the high added-value exports on which Ireland&#x27;s economic recovery depends are exported as unitised freight.

Rosslare Europort 2020 yearly figures are as follows: 810,000 passengers, 130,000 freight units and 515,710 tonnes of freight.

==SailRail==

The Rosslare Europort ferry connection using Stena Line to Fishguard Harbour and then by train operated by Transport for Wales to Carmarthen, Swansea and Cardiff links into Great Western Railway services to Bristol Parkway, Reading and London Paddington. This is popular with Rugby fans going to the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff or the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. Train and ferry connections across the Irish Sea are promoted as an alternative to air.

==Irish Rail and ferry connections==

Trains connect the port on the Rosslare Line via , , Gorey, , , to Dublin Connolly. Connecting routes from Dublin Connolly include the Sligo Line and the Belfast Line.


 

==Planned development and investment at Europort==

The Europort is set to undergo a major transformation over a three to five-year period with new investment of over €30 million invested to provide capacity, facilities and technology to facilitate major growth. There will also be initiatives under the strategic plan for the port including development of the Rosslare Europort Business Park by the Dutch company XELLZ targeting the future Offshore Wind Market and the creation of a Free Zone at Rosslare Europort and the Europort Business Park. It is intended to use technology to create Ireland&#x27;s smartest digital and automated Port so that the Europort will meet all customs and Brexit requirements for state agencies.

Verona Murphy, former president of the Irish Road Haulage Association and a local TD, believes the port needs a €200m upgrade to take full advantage of the opportunities Brexit provides, as Rosslare is currently a roll-on roll-off port, taking trucks, drivers and trailers, whereas she maintains what is needed is to update to a load-on load-off container-type port, requiring crane infrastructure and significant land reclamation. The Irish government has said it will invest more in ports like Rosslare as businesses seek certainty amidst the confusion caused by Brexit.

The Europort’s Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) project received a major boost with the announcement of €2.5m in EU funding under the European Union’s Connecting Europe Facility (CEF).

In April 2023, the Irish Government approved a major capital investment programme at Rosslare Europort for the expansion of Terminal 7 at Rosslare including redeveloping the existing site and demolishing many existing buildings to allow for the construction of a new border control post, which will include new buildings and associated external site infrastructure. In total, as of April 2023, €350 million is set to be invested in the Offshore Renewable Energy, the infrastructure plans, the port Masterplan, digitilisation and the N25 Rosslare Europort Access Road.

==Planned road infrastructure: N11/N25 scheme==

A new motorway costing €350 million is being built linking the N11 at Enniscorthy, along the old N25 road past Wexford town, with the port. The aim is to construct 30 km of road which will link Rosslare Europort/Wexford with Dublin via the M11 motorway and Cork/Waterford via the N25. These routes form part of the European Designated European route E1 and provide a direct link to both mainland Europe and the United Kingdom via Rosslare Europort. The road infrastructure from Oilgate to Rosslare Europort is subject to major delays. In a press release of 8 March 2021, the competent authority stated that it is anticipated that the project could proceed through the statutory planning processes by the end of 2022 at the earliest. Public procurement, possible legal appeals and actual construction will add greatly to this. This could hinder significantly the development of Rosslare Europe, despite the European and national strategic importance of completing this stretch of road.

A very serious question mark has arisen over the ability or willingness of the local authority officials to prioritise and construct the new infrastructure at pace. The option selection process first conducted in 2011 is being repeated in 2021. Lead engineer Sean Dobbs told Wexford County Council at a meeting of March 2021 (the minutes of this meeting were not online as of 20 March 2021) that the preferred scheme option for the M11 motorway would now not be confirmed until 18 June 2021. The further delay was attributed to the increase in remote working.

The delays were criticised on a cross-party basis including by the Cathaoirleach (Chairperson), Cllr Ger Carthy. who accused the Council officials of delay tactics. Mr Dobbs said that the council was trying to predict likely commuter trends due to remote working in 2031, but it is not reported if he stated whether the council had the resources or know-how to carry out such a complex study. However he said that the huge increase in heavy goods vehicles using the current route to Rosslare Euoport was due to increase over the years, but how he arrived at this conclusion has not been reported. Cllr George Lawlor stated that the aim of the N11/N25 project was to assist and foster development of the Europort. Mr Dobbs stated a specialist team was investigating rail infrastructure, due to revived interest in the Waterford to Rosslare railway line, even though this was outside the scope of the N11/N25 project (Cllr Carthy also criticised this new focus). Fianna Fáil Councillor Lisa McDonald raised the issue that the council&#x27;s delays were unconstitutional and could lead to litigation.

The success of Rosslare Europort is already creating some road congestion in South Wexford and a further increase in traffic without adequate timely infrastructure being put in place could provoke tension.

However given the delays besetting the N11/N25 project, it is very likely that they will be a major factor in creating congestion to and from the Europort and will be a significant hindrance to the success of the Europort and to delivering a boost to the economy of the southeast of Ireland.

==Brexit== 
Rosslare Europort&#x27;s strategic importance to Ireland for freight transport has increased following Brexit as it offers direct routes from Ireland to continental Europe, offering an alternative to using the UK &quot;landbridge&quot; (a ferry from Ireland to Great Britain, then a drive through Great Britain to an English port before sailing on to the European mainland). In 2020, around 3,000 lorries took the British landbridge route from Ireland to mainland Europe each week. 

The importance of the Rosslare direct routes was dramatically highlighted following the confusion and disruption in the southeast of England after France closed its border to freight from the UK on 20 December 2020, leaving up to 250 Irish trucks stranded in Britain trying to access mainland Europe using the landbridge to the continent. Rosslare reduces pressure on Dublin Port by offering direct routes to Europe as an alternative to the British landbridge. 

Since then, demand for roll-on, roll-off lorry freight on direct routes from Rosslare to mainland Europe has surged as at least 150,000 lorries cross every year from Ireland to mainland Europe, hitherto mostly via Britain as the cheapest and fastest route before Brexit. An example is the temporary deployment of the new Stena Line Belfast-Liverpool Stena Embla ferry to the Rosslare Cherbourg route.

However some Brexit-related changes are permanent and introduce cumbersome, time-consuming and costly administrative procedures. They do not appear to have easy short-term solutions. Irish logistics companies using the UK Landbridge post-Brexit are facing new frictions affecting cross-border trade as they cross from the UK to the European mainland, just as if they were British, as they must now complete customs declarations and export health certificates that were not required when the UK was a member of the EU. 

In addition, Irish companies using the UK landbridge now have to complete Entry Summary Declarations (ENS) and PBN (Pre-Boarding Notification) declarations. Use of the Landbridge route also raises potential problems such as sanitary and phytosanitary inspections, UK export licenses for certain products, rules of origin difficulties, commodity classification code issues, the need to obtain an EORI number and possible UK VAT issues.

Companies using the direct Rosslare routes to the EU are obviously not subject to these onerous, time-consuming procedures which require heavy investment in new IT and trained staff. The complete absence of Brexit-related delays and formalities at Rosslare is of crucial importance. Market forces, and issues such as customs checks and sanitary and phytosanitary checks will determine the future of the UK Landbridge and the comparative attractiveness of Rosslare.

In January 2021 there was a 446 per cent increase in freight volumes on the direct routes to the European mainland compared with the same month in 2020. At the same time, UK freight volumes moving through the port fell by half. Overall freight volumes in January 2021 were 45 per cent higher than in January 2020 as a result of &quot;unprecedented demand&quot; for the new direct services operating between Rosslare and mainland Europe, as transport companies navigate the twin challenges posed by Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic.

For January and February 2021, UK freight traffic decreased about 43 per cent but overall freight through Rosslare Europort, (both UK and Europe combined) increased by 51 per cent. Figures from the Irish Central Statistics Office show that overall imports from Britain to Ireland fell by more than half in the first two months of 2021 but that Irish exports were not as badly affected; the value of imports from Britain in January and February 2021 was €1.2bn, a decrease of 57% compared to the same period in 2020 while Irish exports to Britain fell by 12% or €249m. 

Brexit-related difficulties also affect imports from the UK or from the EU using the UK Landbridge, as was reported to an Irish Senate Brexit Committee hearing. Dublin Port faced Brexit-related issues as regards EU goods coming into Ireland via the UK landbridge.

Despite the huge increase in sailings in 2021, the surge in demand has already showed the need for even more services. This had been predicted just before Brexit by the Irish Road Haulage Assocìation to a hearing of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, particularly as regards time-sensitive loads such as food but also as regards insufficient capacity generally even with the new services. One user, Amazon, is now routinely sending around 20 trailers on every sailing from Dunkirk to service the Irish market and &quot;to avoid the complications, tariffs, taxes and general headaches that have now become associated with the &#x27;landbridge&#x27; between the UK and Ireland&quot;. Already the port has instituted a system of standby prebooking due to demand. Glenn Carr, Port General Manager, intends to meet demand by turning the port into a 24-hour facility. He told a RTE interview &quot;We still have availability; we&#x27;re not 24 hours at the moment. We do intend going 24 hours, we&#x27;re working with the shipping lines around extra capacity and extra berthing slots being available and we&#x27;ll certainly be in a position to welcome more sailings into the port going forward.&quot;

==Brexit effect on local economy==

In the Rosslare area, businesses have welcomed the boost in traffic going through the port and the town since Brexit. A local entrepreneur was cited by RTE as highlighting beneficial changes such as increased personnel around the area, a big increase in traffic and in people working in Rosslare Harbour, as well as an increase in investment in local business. The BBC has noted that since Brexit, by end February 2021, about 160 new jobs had already been created at Rosslare by government agencies, shipping lines and the port authority itself, and extra business has been generated for local garages and cafes. The Netherlands broadcaster NOS stressed the positive economic effects not only on the immediate Rosslare Port area but also in the wider region.

==Ownership of Europort==

Rosslare is unique among the commercial ports in Ireland as it operates outside of the Irish Harbours Acts 1996–2009. The port is owned by the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company which owes its origins to the Fishguard Bay, Railway and Pier Act 1893 (56 &amp; 57 Vict. c. xcvii), as amended by the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Act 1894 (57 &amp; 58 Vict. c. cxxxvii), both acts of the UK Parliament, still valid in Ireland. The constituent ports (Rosslare and Fishguard) of the company are nowadays the operational and financial responsibility of Iarnród Éireann and Stena Line Ports Ltd respectively. On account of this historic arrangement, Rosslare Europort is operated as a division of Iarnród Éireann. As it is not a separate corporate entity, it cannot be accurately compared in terms of turnover, overheads and employees to the other port companies. This limits the ability to adequately benchmark its performance.

It has been reported that the Irish Government intends to re-examine the ownership status of Rosslare Europort to see if it can be freed from British ownership as it is believed that the port&#x27;s complicated ownership structure is a barrier to essential upgrades in the wake of Brexit, and should be fully owned by the Irish State. This follows earlier commitments by another Irish Government minister to raise the issue with the UK Government The issue of ownership was first raised in 2019 by James Browne, a legally qualified local TD, who described the issue as a major factor in the lack of investment in the port but ministers did not follow-up on Browne&#x27;s intervention. Deputy Browne also suggested that Ianróid Eireann should be divested of management of the Europort with a separate independent management entity. He said that the current arrangements was hindering investment and the development of Rosslare to the advantage of Dublin Port. Deputy Browne compared the huge disparity between investment in Dublin Port as compared to Rosslare Europort, partly due to the ownership issue.

==Rosslare Europort and Dublin Port==

If the Brexit-induced demand for direct services continues, Rosslare Europort may take at least some business from Dublin Port. Dublin Port is considered by some to be congested, lacks adequate space for parking trucks near the Port, and has not enough available land to have adequate facilities for inspection checks (health, customs, phytosanitary) and for COVID-19, the latter being carried out in a Dublin Airport car-park, over 12 km from Dublin Port. It also may have the potential to capitalize on demand from the more lucrative cruise-liner business, which offers far greater returns compared to traditional freight and passenger ferries, and would be more economically attractive both for Dublin Port and for Dublin city.

By contrast Rosslare Europort has a landbank of 100 acres of adjacent land for development, has virtually unlimited parking and its permanent inspection posts will all be located within the Port area itself.

The president of the Irish Road Haulage Association has called for the movement of some of Dublin Port activities to Rosslare. He cited Dublin traffic congestion, time wastage, NOx emissions and Rosslare&#x27;s geographical position as the closest Irish port to mainland Europe, providing a viable alternative to the UK land bridge.

DFDS CEO Torben Carlsen is quoted as stating that the Rosslare–Dunkirk route needs 40–50,000 freight movements per year to be viable. This is equal to around a third of all movements using the UK landbridge to continental Europe on an annual basis.

Eamon Rothwell, CEO of Irish Continental Group which operates Irish Ferries, has made a case for the continued success of the UK landbridge as it is faster and cheaper than direct sailings. He argues that it has more frequent services, is less prone to cancellations than direct services, and will continue to offer hauliers the flexibility to pick up goods in Britain, all of which in his view means that businesses will favour it. He pointed out that in the context of annual Irish export-import traffic using shipping, of some 2.77 million 40 ft shipping containers every year, 80 per cent is Irish-British trade, while only 11 per cent uses the landbridge to reach continental Europe. He stated that only 9 per cent use direct routes. He also pointed to the greater efficiency permitted by the landbridge, which he described as three times more efficient than a direct service in terms of crossings. He emphasised the need to streamline traffic and inspections between the UK and Ireland post-Brexit. Nevertheless, he stressed that his own business had invested €150 million in direct services to the European Continent.

On 22 March 2021, the Dublin Port Company (DPC), a semi-state company, stated that Dublin Port will reach capacity some time between 2030 and 2040 even with the completion of existing or planned development: a fourth terminal, a new jetty, passenger terminal buildings and a heritage zone which will double the existing port&#x27;s capacity to 77 million tonnes a year. The DPC is seeking planning permission to develop port lands on the Poolbeg Peninsula and build a new bridge to take port-related traffic off the East Wall Road, the Tom Clarke Bridge and Pigeon House Road. However, the DPC admitted those developments will not be enough to meet future demand. Additional capacity at other existing east coast ports – Rosslare, Drogheda and Waterford – would also be required, the company said, so as Dublin Port approached its ultimate capacity, volumes it could not handle could be accommodated elsewhere.

Eugene Drennan, head of the Irish Road Haulage Association, stated that Dublin Port was already at maximum capacity and suggested that congestion at Dublin could be relieved by Rosslare, Waterford and Cork ports. DPC states that the Dublin port should be open 24/7 and reduce the time trailers and containers spend at port terminals. However, he claimed that requests for longer opening hours had been met with blank refusal by DPC. The time spent by trailers and containers in the port, he believed could be greatly reduced by having all inspections for a shipment carried out in the same location (bringing the inspectors to the freight rather than vice versa, as is currently the case). The DPC invited public consultations by the end of June 2021.

<doc id="584531" wikidata="Q178374" url="?curid=584531" title="Kaval">
<text>The kaval is a chromatic end-blown oblique flute traditionally played throughout the Balkans (in Albania, Romania, Bulgaria, Southern Serbia, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Northern Greece, and elsewhere) and Anatolia (including Turkey and Armenia). The kaval is primarily associated with mountain shepherds.

Unlike the transverse flute, the kaval is fully open at both ends, and is played by blowing on the sharpened edge of one end. The kaval has eight playing holes (seven in front and one in the back for the thumb) and usually four more unfingered intonation holes near the bottom of the kaval. As a wooden rim-blown flute, kaval is similar to the &quot;kawala&quot; of the Arab world and &quot;ney&quot; of the Middle East.

==Construction==
While typically made of wood (cornel cherry, apricot, plum, boxwood, mountain ash, etc.), kavals are also made from water buffalo horn, &quot;Arundo donax&quot; Linnaeus 1753 (Persian reed), metal and plastic.

A kaval made without joints is usually mounted on a wooden holder, which protects it from warping and helps keep the interior walls oiled. According to the key, the kaval can be in the high register (C, C#)???, middle (D, H) or low (A, B). The kaval plays two octaves and a fifth, in the chromatic scale. Its sound is warm, melancholic and pleasant.

==History==
The kaval is primarily associated with mountain shepherds throughout the Balkans and Anatolia. Musician Pat MacSwyney suggests that the kaval spread with the Yoruks from the Taurus mountains of southern Anatolia into the southern Balkans of southeast Europe.

While in the past it was almost entirely a shepherd&#x27;s instrument, today it is widely used in folk songs and dances as part of ensembles or solo.

==Playing==
Unlike the transverse flute, the kaval is fully open at both ends, and is played by blowing on the sharpened edge of one end. The kaval has eight playing holes (seven in front and one in the back for the thumb) and usually four more near the bottom of the kaval. These holes are not used for playing the instrument, but determine the lowest tone&#x27;s pitch and timbre and are supposed to improve tone and intonation. In Bulgaria they are known as &quot;devil&#x27;s holes&quot;, based on a folk tale in which the devil tries to out-play a shepherd in a musical duel. While the shepherd is sleeping, the devil drilled holes in the shepherd&#x27;s kaval but instead of ruining the kaval, this only served to enhance the shepherd&#x27;s kaval playing thus thwarting the devil. In North Macedonia they are known as &quot;glasnici&quot; (гласници) meaning &quot;giving voice to/of&quot;.

When played, the kaval is held with both hands, at an angle of approximately 45° to the side, with the four fingers of the one hand covering the lower holes; the upper three holes and the thumbhole are covered with the other hand. The mouth covers approximately three quarters of the end. Change of the breath air pressure also changes the pitch.

==Types==
===Bulgaria===

The kaval that is most common in Bulgaria is the one in middle (D) register. The kaval in lower (C) register is also not uncommon for this country. What is characteristic for the Bulgarian style of kaval performance is the diversity of sound shades and techniques. According to the pitch there are four different registers that can be achieved with the Bulgarian kaval. What controls which register the performer works in is mostly the air flow and to some extent the position of the mouth and the lips on the end of the kaval. A very characteristic sound of kaval is achieved in the lowest register. It could sound very mild and gentle if blown lightly while by changing the air stream a deeper (flageolet like) sound is achieved. This sound is so outstanding that some consider it another register that they call - &quot;kaba&quot;. It is also very interesting to notice that the technique of circular breathing is successfully utilized while playing the kaval. This technique lets the performer play without interrupting the air flow, while taking a breath through the nose. In the past it has been considered an extraordinary skill while nowadays it is used by more and more young performers.

The Bulgarian kaval, once made of a single piece of wood, is now constructed of three separate sections (of cornel, walnut, plum or boxwood), with a total length of 60 to 90 cm. Bone rings cover the joints, to prevent the wood from cracking. Metal decoration is also found. The finger-holes are located in the central section, while the lower (shorter) section has four additional holes called &quot;dushnitsi&quot; or &quot;dyavolski dupki&quot; (‘devil’s holes’); these are not covered in performance.

In the south-west Rhodope mountains, two kavals in the same tuning (called &quot;chifte kavali&quot;) are played together, one performing the melody, the other a drone. This type of kaval is made from one piece of wood. A similar use of the kaval is also known in Macedonia and Kosovo, where one kaval of the pair (usually a lower one of a same key) is ‘male’, the other ‘female’.

===Romania And Moldova===
In Romania and Moldova there are three types of cavals: cavals from Moldova (with 6 holes), cavals from Oltenia (with 5 holes) and cavals from Dobrogea (similar with Bulgarian cavals). Their fundamental sound may be A, but for some instruments the lowest sound they can perform may vary between G and C. The Romanian cavals are ethnic instruments built by artisans (usually using two pieces, but there are older models made from a single piece) and therefore each instrument is unique in its own way. The Romanian caval in A has a playing range of two octaves (which lacks certain sounds).

The first five sounds belong to a minor scale with stage IV ascending chromatically. Grouped in this way they represent the low register of the instrument. These five sounds reappear one octave higher, complemented with the sounds F#, G and A, which complete the upper side of a mode of minor-melodic origin on A. The low pitched sounds between E and A cannot be obtained on the Romanian caval in A, which confers the instrument the special individualization of an “elliptic ambitus”. The last and most used octave is obtained without using the lip to cover the orifice by the head. The upper part of the playing range requires an increase in the pressure of the air column. The last four sounds also require more pressure. In the middle of the higher octave, the E2 sound can be obtained by two different pressure techniques, resulting in specific timbral effects.

===Turkey===

In Turkey the term &#x27;kaval&#x27; is used generally to refer to all shepherd&#x27;s pipes and more particularly (though not invariably) to &quot;ductless flutes&quot;. The presence or absence of a duct is sometimes specified by the addition of a qualification: &quot;dilsiz kaval&quot; (&#x27;kaval without a tongue&#x27;), &quot;dilli kaval&quot; (&#x27;kaval with a tongue&#x27;). Other qualifications may be added to describe materials, size or constructional features: &quot;kamiş kavalı&quot; (&#x27;reed kaval&#x27;), &quot;çam kavalı&quot; (&#x27;pine kaval&#x27;), &quot;madenı kavalı&quot; (&#x27;metal kaval&#x27;); &quot;cura kavalı&quot; (&#x27;small kaval&#x27;), &quot;çoban kavalı&quot; (&#x27;shepherd&#x27;s kaval&#x27;, i.e. long kaval); &quot;üç parçalı kavalı&quot; (&#x27;kaval with three parts&#x27;). The Turkish kaval can be made of wood, cane, bone or metal (usually brass) and has five or more finger-holes, one thumb-hole and sometimes additional unfingered holes like the Bulgarian instrument.

===Greece===
In Thrace and some of the Aegean Islands the term &#x27;kavali&#x27; refers to an end-blown flute of the &quot;flogera&quot; family. It has seven finger-holes and sometimes an additional thumb-hole. In Greece&#x27;s Macedonia the term &quot;kavali&quot; is also used to denote the &quot;souravli&quot;. In Epirus the end-blown kaval is known as &quot;dzhamara&quot;.

===North Macedonia===
There are five types of kavals in North Macedonia, according to their length and register:
* &quot;najmal kaval&quot; (smallest kaval) - length: 630 mm, basic tone: dis1;
* &quot;mal kaval&quot; (small kaval) - length: 672 mm, basic tone: d 1;
* &quot;kaval koj nema posebno ime&quot; (&quot;no-special-name&quot;, nondescript kaval) - length: 700 mm, basic tone: cis 1;
* &quot;sreden kaval&quot; (middle kaval) - length: 752 mm, basic tone: c 1;
* &quot;golem kaval&quot; (big kaval) - length: 785 mm, basic tone: h.

The most used in North Macedonia&#x27;s musical traditions are the smallest and nondescript kavals.

The North Macedonia&#x27;s &quot;šupelka&quot; is similar to the kaval (open on both ends), except that it is shorter (240–350 mm). It can be made of either walnut, barberry, ash wood, maple or other wood. The šupelka plays the chromatic scale (two octaves), except the first note of the lower octave. In the low register, its sound is soft and pleasant, while in the upper register it is sharp and shrill.

===Serbia===
The kaval (&quot;cevara&quot;) is widely used in the musical traditions of Southern, Southeastern and Eastern Serbia.

Presentations of musicians on frescoes of medieval monasteries and churches of this side of the Balkans say that the kaval dates back to the medieval ages. On the side where it is being played, there is a sharp bird which enables the easier obtaining of the tone. The tone is obtained just when the kaval is being stuck to the lips semi-horizontally, or under the angle of 45 degrees, as the player blows straight.

===Moldova===
The Moldovan caval has five and sometimes six holes and it is frequently used in traditional folk music both in Romania and Moldova.

===Albania and Kosovo===
The Albanian kavall is typically used by the Gheg Albanians of northern Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, and North Macedonia and by Tosks south of Albania. A kavall is traditionally made of wood. Lately, copper or even bronze has been employed. In Albania, it is called a &quot;Fyell&quot;. Most of the melodies are called &quot;Kaba&quot; and &quot;Vaj&quot; which are melancholy, but considered beautiful. It has been said that shepherds sent messages with a kavall when threatened by thieves or in order to send romantic signals to their beloved.

==Related flutes==
===Svirka===
The &quot;svirka&quot; (or &quot;tsafara&quot;, &quot;svorche&quot;, or &quot;little kaval&quot;) is a Bulgarian shepherd&#x27;s flute, consisting of one wooden tube 25 to 50 cm long with six or seven holes for fingers, and a bone lip where it is endblown. It is played much like the kaval.

===Armenia===
The &quot;&quot; () is an open end-blown shepherd&#x27;s flute traditionally played in Armenia and similar in structure to the kaval. It is made of either reed or apricot wood and has eight playing holes, including seven finger holes and one thumb hole. The resulting sound is diatonic, the timbre is described as soft and velvety. The &quot;blul&quot; is associated with the &quot;sring&quot; flute and occasionally equated with it, which is also a common term for Armenian end-blown flutes in general.

===Bashkirs and Caucasus===
An open end-blown flute similar to the kaval is used by the Bashkirs and the Caucasians; it is called by such terms as &quot;khobyrakh&quot;, &quot;Quray&quot; and &quot;choor&quot; or &quot;shoor&quot;.

A typical khobyrakh is a 70 cm-wide, smooth, hollow pipe made of an umbel (hollow stem of a big, parasol-like umbellifer) or wood, with 3 or sometimes 6 finger-holes. Nowadays, it is also made of plastic.

<doc id="584536" wikidata="Q2888576" url="?curid=584536" title="Battle of Frenchman's Butte">
<text>The Battle of Frenchman&#x27;s Butte, fought on May 28, 1885, occurred when the Alberta Field Force attacked a force of Cree, dug in on a hillside near Frenchman&#x27;s Butte. The battlefield is located in what was then the District of Saskatchewan of the North-West Territories, now the province of Saskatchewan.

==Background==
Members of a band of Cree led by war chief Wandering Spirit, living in what is now central Alberta and Saskatchewan joined the North-West Rebellion of 1885 after the government forces&#x27; defeat at the Battle of Duck Lake. The starving fighters seized food and supplies from several white settlements and captured Fort Pitt, taking prisoners. Major-General Thomas Bland Strange, a retired British officer living near Calgary, raised a force of cowboys and other white settlers, added to them two units of North-West Mounted Police (NWMP), and headed north. He was reinforced by three infantry units from the east, bringing his forces to some 1,000 men. 

His column consists of the Sixty-fifth Battalion 232 soldiers; Winnipeg Provisional Battalion (92nd) 307 soldiers; Strange&#x27;s Rangers (Alberta scouts) 50 men, and 67 NWMP policemen.

While he left some of his force to provide protection for isolated white settlements along the way, he secured Edmonton then he led his column east to Fort Pitt. As he approached, Cree insurgents burnt the fort as they left and retreated to nearby hills. Over the next few days, Strange&#x27;s scouts fought skirmishes with small groups of Cree and in pursuit of Big Bear, marched to the area of Frenchman&#x27;s Butte. On the night of May 27, the Cree dug in at the top of a hill east of the butte and waited.

==The battle==
Early on the morning of May 28, the Cree fighters divided into two groups. Wandering Spirit, the Cree war chief, led some 200 fighters to take positions in trenches and rifle pits on top of the hill, while Little Poplar and the other group remained to protect the camp, some 3 kms (two miles) away. General Strange arrived opposite the Cree-occupied hill at six in the morning and opened fire with a small cannon. The Cree then opened fire with their guns on Strange&#x27;s soldiers. 

Some of his soldiers started across the valley but found it soft going due to muskeg. As well, movement forward came under fire from Cree fighters on top of a steep, open hillside, making a frontal assault suicidal. Strange pulled his forces back and deployed them along the bottom of the valley. The two units of NWMP formed the left flank. To their right was the 65th Battalion, Mount Royal Rifles, with the Winnipeg Light Infantry Battalion in the centre, while the right flank was formed by Strange&#x27;s Alberta scouts.
The two sides exchanged gunfire for three hours. Cree rifle fire wounded some of the soldiers in the valley, while Strange&#x27;s artillery put holes in the hillside, damaging the trenches where Cree sheltered. 

Eventually, General Strange ordered Major Sam Steele to lead the NWMP north and outflank the Cree fighters. This manoevre was seen and Wandering Spirit and others moved along the crests of hills parallel to Steele and occasionally fired on them. This caused Steele to believe the Cree&#x27;s lines were longer than they were, so he ordered his NWMP force to turn back. 

Around the same time, some Cree warriors outflanked the Alberta Mounted Rifles and almost captured the column&#x27;s supply train. Afraid of being attacked from behind, General Strange ordered his force to retreat. Strange&#x27;s troops withdrew to Fort Pitt. The Cree fighters slipped away later that day, and soon more than 1,000 soldiers resumed their search for Big Bear&#x27;s band.

H.A. MacKay later recounted the day&#x27;s events and its aftermath.

&quot;On May 29, near Frenchman&#x27;s Butte Inspector S.B. Steele made contact with an Indian scouting party. Steele&#x27;s scouts called out to the party and were fired upon. Steele&#x27;s troops returned fire and killed the first Indian casualty of the war. They rode down with a friend to view the remains and found his body on top the hill where he evidently had been dragged by the scout. His body was stripped of all clothing with the rope (cut short to about one yard in length) still around his neck, which had cut into his jaw. He was a huge fine-looking Indian, &#x27;Ma-me-book&#x27; by name. The scout who had captured his mount (a swift-footed black stallion belonging to the HBCo) had galloped around the prairie with the rope attached to his saddle pommel, trailing the body in the grass in circles, the trails of which were still visible. He had thus been left exposed for days before being buried; and his body from the intense heat, was huge in size when I saw him. I requested to have him buried.&quot; H.A. MacKay, memories, HBCo archives and Glenbow Archives.

==Conclusion==

The battle was a victory for Big Bear&#x27;s band, albeit a hollow one. It bought them time to escape from Strange, but continued resistance was hopeless. The Métis had been defeated at the Battle of Batoche three weeks earlier, and Poundmaker&#x27;s joint Cree-Assiniboine force had surrendered. 

Big Bear&#x27;s band fell apart during the retreat to the north after the battle. The Battle of Loon Lake on June 3 demoralized them further. By early July the rebellion was over. Big Bear had surrendered at Carlton and was in prison. Wandering Spirit was later executed along with seven others. 

General Strange retired back to his ranch, and the Alberta Field Force disbanded.

==Legacy==
In the spring of 2008, Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Christine Tell proclaimed in Duck Lake, that &quot;the 125th commemoration, in 2010, of the 1885 Northwest Resistance is an excellent opportunity to tell the story of the prairie Métis and First Nations peoples&#x27; struggle with Government forces and how it has shaped Canada today&quot;.

Frenchman Butte is a national historic site of Canada, which locates the theatre of the 1885 battle staged between Cree and Canadian troops.

<text>William Lassell (18 June 1799 – 5 October 1880) was an English merchant and astronomer. He is remembered for his improvements to the reflecting telescope and his ensuing discoveries of four planetary satellites.

==Life==
William Lassell was born in Bolton, Lancashire, on 18 June 1799. He received his early education in Bolton and later attended Rochdale Academy.. After the death of his father, William Lassell was apprenticed to a merchant in Liverpool from 1814 to 1821. He later made his fortune as a beer brewer, which afforded him the means to pursue his passion for astronomy. He built an observatory at his house &quot;Starfield&quot; in West Derby, a suburb of Liverpool. There he had a aperture metal mirror reflector telescope (aka the &quot;two-foot&quot; telescope), for which he pioneered the use of an equatorial mount for easy tracking of objects as the Earth rotates. He ground and polished the mirror himself, using equipment he constructed. The observatory was later (1854) moved further out of Liverpool, to Bradstones.

In 1846, Lassell discovered Triton, the largest moon of Neptune, just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself by German astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle, using his self-built instrument. In 1848, he independently co-discovered Hyperion, a moon of Saturn. In 1851 he discovered Ariel and Umbriel, two moons of Uranus.

In 1855, he built a telescope, which he installed in Malta because of the observing conditions that were better than in often-overcast England. While in Malta his astronomical observing assistant was Albert Marth. On his return to the UK after several years in Malta, he moved to Maidenhead and operated his telescope in an observatory there. The 48-inch telescope was dismantled and was eventually scrapped. The 24-inch telescope was later moved to Royal Observatory, Greenwich in the 1880s, but eventually dismantled.

Lassell was a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society (FRAS) from 1839, won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1849, and served as its president for two years starting in 1870. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1849 and won their Royal Medal in 1858. Lassell was also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (FRSL). He was furthermore elected an honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (HonFRSE) and of the Society of Sciences of Upsala, and received an honorary LL.D. degree from the University of Cambridge in 1874.

Lassell died in Maidenhead in 1880 and is buried at St. Luke&#x27;s Church. Upon his death, he left a fortune of £80,000 (roughly ). His telescope was presented to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich.

The crater Lassell on the Moon, a crater on Mars, the asteroid 2636 Lassell and a ring of Neptune are named in his honour. At the University of Liverpool the William Lassell prize is awarded to the student with the highest grades graduating the B.Sc. program in Physics with Astronomy each year.

<text>The University of Chicago Booth School of Business (branded as Chicago Booth) is the graduate business school of the University of Chicago, a private research university in Chicago, Illinois. Founded in 1898, Chicago Booth is the second-oldest business school in the U.S. and is associated with 10 Nobel laureates in the Economic Sciences, more than any other business school in the world. The school has the third-largest endowment of any business school. Chicago Booth is considered part of the M7, an informal network of business schools recognized as having elite MBA programs, regarded as among the most prestigious in the United States. 

Notable Chicago Booth alumni include James O. McKinsey, founder of McKinsey &amp; Company; Susan Wagner, co-founder of Blackrock; Eric Kriss, co-founder of Bain Capital; Satya Nadella, current CEO of Microsoft; and other current and former CEOs of Fortune 500 companies such as Allstate Insurance, Booz Allen Hamilton, Cargill, Chevron, Chipotle, Credit Suisse, Dominos, Goldman Sachs, IBM, Morgan Stanley, Morningstar, PIMCO, Reckitt Benckiser, and Starbucks.

==History==
The University of Chicago Booth School of Business traces its roots to 1898 when university faculty member James Laurence Laughlin chartered the College of Commerce and Politics, which was intended to be an extension of the school&#x27;s founding principles of &quot;scientific guidance and investigation of great economic and social matters of everyday importance.&quot; The program originally served as a solely undergraduate institution until 1916, when academically oriented research masters and later doctoral-level degrees were introduced.

In 1916, the school was renamed the &quot;School of Commerce and Administration&quot;. Soon after in 1922, the first doctorate program was offered at the school. In 1932, the school was rechristened as the &quot;School of Business&quot;. The School of Business offered its first Master of Business Administration (MBA) in 1935. A landmark decision was taken by the school at about this time to concentrate its resources solely on graduate programs, and accordingly, the undergraduate program was phased out in 1942. In 1943, the school launched the first Executive MBA program. The school was renamed to &quot;Graduate School of Business&quot; (or more popularly, the &quot;GSB&quot;) in 1959, a name that it held till 2008. That year alumnus David G. Booth gave the school a gift valued at $300 million, and in honor of the gift the school was renamed the &quot;University of Chicago Booth School of Business&quot;.
During the latter half of the twentieth century, the business school was instrumental in the development of the Chicago School of economics, an economic philosophy focused on free-market, minimal government involvement, due to faculty and student interaction with members of the university&#x27;s influential Department of Economics. Other innovations by the school include initiating the first PhD program in business (1920), founding the first academic business journal (1928), offering the first Executive MBA (EMBA) program (1943), and for offering the first weekend MBA program (1986). Students at the school founded the National Black MBA Association (1972), and it is the only U.S. business school with permanent campuses on three continents: Asia (2000), Europe (1994), and North America (1898).

==Campuses==
In Chicago, the Booth School has two campuses: the Charles M. Harper Center in Hyde Park, which houses the school&#x27;s full-time MBA and Ph.D. programs, and the Gleacher Center in downtown Chicago, which hosts the part-time Evening and Weekend MBA Programs, Chicago-based Executive MBA Program, and Executive Education courses. Chicago Booth also has a campus in London, a short walk from St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, hosting the EMBA Program in Europe and Executive Education classes. Lastly, Chicago Booth has a campus in Hong Kong, located in the Hong Kong Jockey Club University of Chicago Academic Complex.

==Academics==
Chicago Booth offers Full-time, Part-time (Evening and Weekend) and Executive MBA programs. Starting in the 2024–2025 academic year, Booth intends to offer a Master in Finance and Master in Management degrees for recent college graduates who studied humanities, arts, social sciences, biological sciences, or physical sciences in college, and are interested in jobs that value business-oriented skills and knowledge.

The university also educates future academics, with graduate programs offering the A.M. and Ph.D. degrees in several fields. In addition to conducting graduate business programs, the school conducts research in the fields of finance, economics, quantitative marketing research, and accounting, among others. PhD graduates include Cliff Asness and John Liew, who co-founded money management firm AQR, and Ross Stevens, who founded Stone Ridge Asset Management. In April 2023, Stevens donated $100 million to support Chicago Booth&#x27;s PhD program, which is now named the Stevens Doctoral Program.

===Honors===
Chicago Booth grants &quot;High Honors&quot; to the top five percent of the graduating class and &quot;Honors&quot; to its next 15 percent, based on GPA averages of all MBA graduates from the previous academic year.

The Financial Times Rankings 2019 awarded Chicago Booth third place in Open Executive Education. Poets and Quants ranked the school #2 in their 2019 ranking.

==People==

== Publications ==
Chicago Booth currently publishes three academic journals:
*&quot;Journal of Accounting Research&quot;
*&quot;Journal of Law and Economics&quot;
*&quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot; (with the Department of Economics)

=== &quot;Chicago Booth Review&quot; ===
&quot;Chicago Booth Review&quot; is a magazine devoted to business research, particularly research conducted by Chicago Booth&#x27;s own faculty. In addition to covering new findings in finance, behavioral science, economics, entrepreneurship, accounting, marketing, and other business-relevant subjects, the magazine features essays from Chicago Booth faculty and other academics. It is published quarterly in print and several times a week online.

&quot;Chicago Booth Review&quot; is the most recent of several successive vehicles Chicago Booth has used to convey its intellectual capital to an outside audience. Starting in the 1960s, the school published the Selected Papers series, a collection of articles written by faculty members or excerpted from faculty speeches. In 1997, Booth launched &quot;Capital Ideas&quot; () as a separate newsletter featuring articles about faculty research. That subsequently evolved into a quarterly magazine, which in 2016 relaunched as &quot;Chicago Booth Review&quot;.

<doc id="584546" wikidata="Q393188" url="?curid=584546" title="Żubrówka">
<text>Żubrówka Bison Grass Vodka () is a flavored Polish vodka which contains a blade of bison grass (&quot;Hierochloe odorata&quot;) in every bottle. The Żubrówka brand name is also used on bottles of conventional vodka, labeled as Żubrówka Biała. The grass is sourced from the Białowieża Forest, hand-picked and dried under natural conditions.

The origins of Żubrówka production in Poland date back to the 16th century.

Żubrówka ranks as the third or fourth best-selling vodka brand in the world (after Smirnoff, Absolut, and occasionally Khortytsia). Żubrówka is available in more than 80 markets worldwide.

Żubrówka is manufactured at the Polmos Białystok distillery. While it is claimed that the recipe dates back as far as the 14th century, commercial production of Bison Grass Vodka first began at the distillery in 1928. The brand is owned by Central European Distribution Corporation International, which was acquired by Roust International in 2013. Since 2022, it has been owned by the Maspex Group.

== Etymology and brand ==
In Polish, the word is officially used for bison grass, while the name &quot;żubrówka&quot; has been used in folk terminology and colloquially. The name comes from the term &quot;zubr&quot; (, ), the word for the European bison in many Slavic languages and Baltic languages.

The brands &quot;Zubrovka&quot; and &quot;Żubrówka&quot; are registered by Sojuzplodoimport in Russia and Roust International in Poland.

== Types ==
In Poland, the Żubrówka brand is also used to label other vodkas that are not żubrówka. Thirteen different varieties have appeared on the market under this brand:

* Żubrówka Bison Grass – Classic Żubrówka, produced according to traditional methods from oak barrel maturing bison grass macerate. Its characteristic feature is the blade placed in the bottle.

* Żubrówka Biała – pure, distilled six times and filtered using platinum, the variety is characterized by its mild taste.
* Żubrówka Czarna – vodka with a mild flavor that is due to charcoal and oak filtration and selected wheat.
* Linia Fresh Żu – Light, refreshing. A combination of juicy fruit and bison grass. Available in 4 flavors: Sour Apple, Refreshing Mint, Sour Lemon, Invigorating Sea Buckthorn.

== United States variant ==
Before 2010 Żubrówka was illegal in the United States because the grass it is made from contains coumarin which the FDA classifies as a &quot;substances generally prohibited from direct addition or use as human food&quot;. Since 2011, the manufacturers have made a version of Żubrówka from rye grain which aims to have a flavor similar to the original.

== Methods of consumption ==
Żubrówka is sometimes mixed with apple juice, preferably unfiltered. Known in Poland as &quot;szarlotka&quot;, literally &quot;apple cake&quot;, overseas the drink is branded Apple ŻU and was included in Independent magazine&#x27;s list of the Top 50 drinks in the world (other names for this drink are Tatanka, Bison Fire, Apple Pie itd.). Known in the UK as a &quot;Frisky Bison&quot;, and in the US as a &quot;Polish Kiss&quot;. It is sometimes served over vanilla ice cream, and another common mixer is ginger ale.

<text>The North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) was a Canadian paramilitary police force, established in 1873, to maintain order in the new Canadian North-West Territories (NWT) following the 1870 transfer of Rupert&#x27;s Land and North-Western Territory to Canada from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, the Red River Rebellion and in response to lawlessness, demonstrated by the subsequent Cypress Hills Massacre and fears of United States military intervention. The NWMP combined military, police and judicial functions along similar lines to the Royal Irish Constabulary. A small, mobile police force was chosen to reduce potential for tensions with the United States and First Nations. The NWMP uniforms included red coats deliberately reminiscent of British and Canadian military uniforms.

The NWMP was established by the Canadian government during the ministry of Prime Minister Sir John Macdonald who defined its purpose as &quot;the preservation of peace and the prevention of crime&quot; in the vast NWT. Macdonald envisioned the police force as a para-military force, writing that the &quot;best force would be mounted riflemen, trained to act as cavalry... and styled police&quot;. Macdonald&#x27;s principal fear was that the activities of American traders such as the Cypress Hills Massacre would lead to the First Nations peoples killing the American traders, which would lead to the United States military being deployed into the NWT to protect the lives of American citizens on the grounds that Canada was unable to maintain law and order in the region. Macdonald&#x27;s greatest fear was that if the Americans occupied the NWT that they would not leave and the region would be annexed to the United States.

In 1874, the NWMP were deployed to the area of the present Alberta border. Their ill-planned and arduous journey of nearly became known as the March West and was portrayed as an epic journey of endurance. Over the next few years, the NWMP established a wide network of forts, posts and patrols and extended Canadian law across the region. The living conditions of the NWMP on the prairies were spartan and often uncomfortable, and only slowly improved over the course of the century.

By 1896, the government planned to pass policing responsibilities to the provinces and ultimately disband the NWMP. However, with the discovery of gold in the Klondike, the NWMP was redeployed to protect Canada&#x27;s sovereignty over the region and to manage the influx of prospectors. NWMP volunteers were sent to fight in the Second Boer War and, in recognition for that and 30 years of service policing the North-West and Yukon Territories, King Edward VII, awarded the title &quot;Royal&quot; to the North-West Mounted Police (RNWMP) in 1904. Plans for disbanding the Royal North-West Mounted Police were abandoned in the face of popular oppositions and regional politicians. Large numbers of the RNWMP volunteered for military service during the First World War and the future of the badly depleted force was once again in doubt. Towards the end of the war, however, fears grew about a potential Bolshevik conspiracy and the authorities tasked the RNWMP to investigate the threat. In the aftermath of the violence of the Winnipeg General Strike, the government amalgamated the RNWMP and Dominion Police, to form the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 1920.

==History==
===Background===
The NWMP was created due to the expansion of the newly formed Dominion of Canada into the NWT during the 1870s. The Dominion had been formed in 1867 by the confederation of the British colonies of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, but the extensive lands to the north-west known as Rupert&#x27;s Land remained governed by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company as a proprietary colony. The new Dominion government was keen to expand westwards, in part due to fears that the United States might annex the region. It agreed to purchase the company&#x27;s lands in exchange for £300,000 and various grants of land, adding around of territory to the Dominion in 1870.

The NWT varied geographically from the extreme conditions of the far north, through to the edges of the Great Plains in the south, covered by flat, semi-arid grasslands. A rocky area known as the Shield, which was unsuitable for arable farming, had formed a natural barrier to European colonists gradually spreading across from the eastern colonies. As a result, the territories remained thinly populated, with only around 150,000 First Nations, Inuit and occasional small groups of Europeans, and more substantial communities of around 12,000 Métis settled in the Red River valley of Manitoba and a further 8,500 European settlers in the colony of British Columbia. Surveys referred to the territories as the &quot;Wild North Land&quot; and the &quot;Great Lone Land&quot;.

The Canadian border along the southern edge of Alberta was occupied by the Blackfoot Confederacy, a First Nation whose economy was based on hunting bison. The Blackfoot had suffered badly from smallpox, and were under increasing pressure from rival groups of Sioux and Piegans that had crossed into Canada, fleeing the expansion of the United States military across the southern plains. Whisky-traders from the United States had come across the border, selling alcohol to the indigenous peoples, fuelling social problems and outbreaks of violence. Although the region remained relatively safe, there was no civil government, and military explorers highlighted the &quot;lawlessness&quot; and lack of &quot;security for life or property&quot; that resulted from the absence of a formal justice system.

In 1869, the government of John A. Macdonald, made plans to create a 200-strong mounted police force to maintain order along the border; such a force, he thought, would enable the colonization of the region and be much cheaper than deploying regular militia units for the task. The implementation of this proposal was delayed, however, first by the rebellion of the Métis, and then by the threat of a Fenian invasion. Meanwhile, a survey conducted in 1871 by Lieutenant William Butler recommended establishing a mounted force of up to 150 men under a magistrate or commissioner, based along the northern trade routes, leaving the border area as a liminal, ungarrisoned zone. Colonel Patrick Robertson-Ross conducted another survey in 1872, and recommended an alternative strategy of recruiting a larger force of 550 men who would be tasked to push south into the border region itself and establish law and order there.

===Establishment (1873–1874)===

====Formation====

Macdonald acquired approval for his new force on May 23, 1873, after Parliament, following a cursory debate, passed the &quot;Mounted Police Act&quot; into law unopposed. At this point, Macdonald appears to have intended to create a force of mounted police to watch &quot;the frontier from Manitoba to the foot of the Rocky Mountains&quot;, probably with its headquarters in Winnipeg. He was heavily influenced by the model of the Royal Irish Constabulary, which combined aspects of a traditional military unit with the judicial functions of the magistrates&#x27; courts, and believed that the new force should be able to provide a local system of government in otherwise ungoverned areas. Originally, Macdonald also had wanted to form units of Métis policemen, commanded by white Canadian officers in a similar manner to the British Indian Army, but he was forced to abandon this approach after the Red River Rebellion of 1870 called their loyalty into question.

In June 1873, around 30 members of the Assiniboine First Nation were killed in the Cypress Hills Massacre, creating a national furore. In response, Macdonald used a Privy Council order to enact the new legislation, formally creating the NWMP with the intention of mobilizing the force and deploying it early the next year. A report then arrived from Alexander Morris, the Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories, blaming the massacre on the activities of whisky traders at Fort Whoop-Up; Morris predicted that if action was not taken immediately, there would be a major uprising by the First Nations across the region, into which the United States might choose to intervene. Macdonald was not entirely convinced by the governor&#x27;s analysis, but nonetheless he agreed to recruit 150 men and send them west to Lower Fort Garry before winter weather blocked the route.

Macdonald&#x27;s Conservative government then fell from power as a result of the Pacific Scandal, and was replaced by the Liberal administration of Alexander Mackenzie, who placed more credence on Morris&#x27;s reports and had his own moral concerns about the whisky trade. These worries were amplified by calls from Washington for Ottawa to secure the frontier and so prevent American Indians from purchasing whisky in Canada. Mackenzie initially suggested sending a joint Canadian-United States military expedition, but, after the Governor General and others noted the serious implications of inviting the United States Army to deploy into Canadian territory, he instead agreed to deploy the new mounted police to carry out the operation. Another 150 men were recruited in eastern Canada and sent west by rail through the United States to rendezvous with the first part of the force at Fort Dufferin.

====March West====
The mounted police&#x27;s deployment onto the plains in 1874 became known as the &quot;March West&quot;. The commissioner of the new force, Colonel George French, was ordered to proceed west from Fort Dufferin to deal with what the authorities described as the &quot;band of desperadoes&quot; around Fort Whoop-Up, before then dispersing his force to establish police posts stretching across the territories. From Fort Dufferin, French could have simply traced the southern line of the frontier, following a well-established trail created two years before by the British and United States Boundary Commission. Lieutenant Governor Morris disagreed with this approach, arguing that it might encourage an attack by the Sioux, who he believed were gathering in the United States to attack across the border, and urged the government to send the police via a more northerly route.

Following instructions from Ottawa, French finally agreed with Morris that the expedition would initially follow the trail, but then would steer away from the border and Sioux territory, and the mounted police finally left Dufferin on July 8, 1874. The 275-strong expedition was divided into six divisions, supported by 310 horses, 143 draught oxen and 187 Red River carts and wagons, in all stretching out along the track. The force took two 9-pounder (4 kg) guns and two mortars for additional protection, cattle for food, and mowing machines to make hay. French had negotiated that the expedition be accompanied by Henri Julien, a journalist whom the commissioner hoped would write a positive account of the new force. The expedition made slow time along the boundary trail, progressing only a day at most. The police were already travelling under unpleasant and arduous conditions, made more difficult by the teamsters having little experience and their horses being unsuitable for draught work.

On July 29, the main force then turned off the trail and headed across the much drier and rougher prairies to the north-west. The police had no water bottles and soon both their food and water ran out; as the weather worsened, their horses began to die. When the force arrived at what they thought was Fort Whoop-Up at the junction of the Bow and South Saskatchewan rivers on September 10, there was nothing to be seen, as the fort was in fact around away. The police had expected the area to contain good grazing for their horses but it was barren and treeless. French was forced to abandon the plan to head to Whoop-Up and instead travelled south towards the border, where supplies could be purchased from the United States. Yet more horses died from the cold and hunger, and many of the men were barefoot and in rags by the time they arrived, having travelled a total of nearly .

After resupplying, French led some of his force back east, leaving Assistant Commissioner James Macleod to advance on Fort Whoop-Up with the three remaining divisions, approximately 150 men. When the police reached the fort on October 9, they were prepared for a confrontation, but the whisky traders were aware that they were approaching and had long since moved on. The force received new orders from Ottawa to garrison the area and settled down to build Fort Macleod on an island in Old Man&#x27;s River. The expedition had been badly planned and executed, and almost failed; the historian William Baker describes it as &quot;a monumental fiasco of poor planning, ignorance, incompetence, and cruelty to men and beasts&quot;. Nonetheless, it rapidly became portrayed by the force as epic story of bravery, endurance and determination.

===Early years (1874–1895)===
====Relations with First Nations====

With the arrival of the mounted police, the whisky trade around Fort Macleod collapsed, and the traders shifted into legitimate projects or moved elsewhere. The Blackfoot welcomed the arrival of the police and their leader, Crowfoot, promoted a policy of co-operation. After enduring a difficult winter with only limited supplies, the force broke up their main command, some remaining at Fort Macleod, with others establishing forts at Dufferin, Swan River, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Ellice, with Walsh and Calgary following soon after. Macdonald&#x27;s newly returned Conservative government was critical of the way that the Liberals had stood up the force, ordering an inspection in 1875 that concluded that &quot;for a newly-raised force, hastily enrolled and equipped, it is in very fair order&quot;, but recommended a variety of improvements, including to the quality of the commissioned officers. Commissioner French was forced to resign the following year, and was replaced by James Macleod.

Meanwhile, the frontier was changing rapidly, with large cattle ranches being established across the Canadian plains. The government also introduced a new Indian Policy, seeking to sign treaties with the First Nations, establish reserves and a system of annuities, which would then hopefully be followed by the integration of the First Nations into the agricultural economy. The mounted police&#x27;s approach to enabling this process has been characterized by the historian Ronald Atkin as a &quot;benevolent despotism&quot;, and by John Jennings as a &quot;legal tyranny&quot;. The police insisted that the Canadian law should be applied rigidly to the First Nations, but at the same time were relatively supportive of the First Nations when responding to the claims of the growing number of white ranchers. The force built cordial personal relationships with the First Nations&#x27; leaders, which led to a much lower level of violence between the government and indigenous peoples than in the United States. That the NWMP had evicted the American whisky traders whose sales had led to alcoholism becoming a serious problem was greatly appreciated by the First Nations peoples. The Blackfoot chief Crowfoot in 1877 stated: &quot;The Mounted Police protected us as the feathers of the bird protect it from the frosts of winter&quot;. The fact that the NWMP arrested whites accused of killing First Nations peoples led to the perception among First Nations peoples that the NWMP was high-handed, but fair.

The herds of buffalo migrated elsewhere on the plains in 1876 and starvation among the Blackfoot loomed. Crowfoot rejected a proposed alliance with the Sioux against the United States, arguing that the collapse of buffalo hunting and white immigration meant that his people needed a long-term alliance with the mounted police. Formal negotiations between the Canadian government and the Blackfoot began in 1877, with Macleod representing Queen Victoria. The resulting Treaty 7 established reserves for the Blackfoot, in exchange for gratuities and the promise of annuities. The Department of Indian Affairs was created to govern the reserves, supported by the police. By 1879, the last of the Canadian buffalo herds had been eliminated by hunting, and the Indians became dependent on supplies issued by the police to avoid starvation.

At the same time, the police were managing the Sitting Bull incident. In 1876 the United States military led a campaign against the Sioux in Dakota; the Sioux&#x27;s leader, Sitting Bull, concluded that the conflict was unwinnable, and chose to seek sanctuary in Canada. Sitting Bull arrived in May the following year and, by the summer, around 5,600 Sioux had crossed the border despite opposition from the Blackfoot. The mounted police helped to facilitate the negotiations with the Sioux, in which Assistant Commissioner Acheson Irvine played a prominent part. The Sioux declined to return south, however, and the police had to deploy around 200 men to Fort Walsh to oversee the immigrant community. The police lived in primitive conditions and voluntarily shared some of their own supplies with the Sioux, who were not covered by Treaty 7 and therefore ineligible for government support. Nonetheless, starvation gradually forced the return of most of the newcomers to the United States, and Sitting Bull himself finally surrendered in 1881.

Initially, the police focused their law enforcement efforts on dealing with the illegal consumption of alcohol, which was considered to promote violent behaviour among the First Nations. By the 1880s, however, the police also began to tackle horse theft. Horse stealing was common among the First Nations on the prairies: it formed part of intertribal competition and warfare, and the stolen horses enabled their hunting expeditions. In part the police crackdown was driven by the Department for Indian Affairs, who believed that the practice of horse theft was slowing the assimilation of the First Nations into broader Canadian society. The authorities were also concerned that if the First Nations were allowed to steal horses from across the border in the United States, it could provoke a military intervention into Canada.

From 1885 onward, the NWMP was charged with the enforcing the apartheid-like pass system, under which a First Nations person was permitted to leave a reservation only with a pass issued by the local Indian agent and had to return by the time the pass expired. The pass system was brought in as a temporary measure during the North-West Rebellion, but was then made permanent as the government found it a useful means of social control. The NWMP knew that the pass system had no basis in the law and in fact violated Treaty 7 with the Blackfoot, which promised that the Blackfoot people would be permitted go whatever they liked. The Indians often ignored the pass system, and in May 1893 Commissioner Herchmer ordered the NWMP to stop enforcing the pass system, saying it was illegal under Canadian law, only to be overruled by the Department of Indian Affairs. It was the intention of the Canadian government to colonize the Prairies, and the government believed that settlers would not come unless there were assurances that the First Nations peoples were under control, hence the pass system.

====Construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway====

The Canadian government began the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway between eastern Canada and British Columbia in 1881, with the aim of opening up the north-western territories for settlement. In response, the mounted police moved their headquarters to the town of Regina, the new territorial capital which had been founded alongside the railway line. The force was increased in size to 500 in 1882 to cope with the increased tasks being demanded of it, and the police began to use the railway to bring in recruits more easily from the eastern provinces.

The mounted police took on a range of tasks associated with the new project. Teams of police escorted the construction teams as they moved across the Rocky Mountains, having been given special jurisdiction over the area along the line of the route. They enforced the liquor laws, and oversaw the itinerant service workers who accompanied the main construction teams. They defused many of the tensions involving the construction workers and the company, including intervening to resolve cases where the workers had not been paid by the company as promised, but they also intervened to support the railway company. When the railway staff went on strike for higher wages in 1883, the mounted police guarded the company&#x27;s trains, escorted in new drivers and, when necessary, drove the locomotives themselves; two years later the police broke up a protest over unpaid wages by over a thousand construction workers, arresting the main leaders. The head of the Canadian Pacific Railway, William Van Horne, thanked the force for its contribution to the final completion of the project.

The construction of the railway introduced new tensions between the government and the First Nations. The authorities wished to move the indigenous peoples to reserves north of the railway in order to cut them off from the United States border. For their part, the First Nations were unhappy about the railway being built through their lands, stole company horses and disrupted the construction work. The mounted police made arrests and the government reduced their rations: by 1883, the threat of starvation had forced the First Nations to relocate to the northern side of the line.

====North-West Rebellion====
In 1885, the North-West Rebellion broke out along the North Saskatchewan River valley. Driven by a combination of political and economic issues, Louis Riel and his Métis followers intended to form a provisional government, gain the support of the Cree First Nation, defeat the mounted police and seize the region, forcing the Canadian government to the negotiation table. There had been worries among the police about potential instability since the previous fall, and the force had increased its presence in the area over the winter. As tensions rose, Irvine, who had replaced Macleod as Commissioner in 1880 after accusations of financial mismanagement, began to mobilize any spare police manpower in Regina, bringing the force up to an operational strength of 562.

When the rebellion finally broke out in Batoche in March, Irvine advanced quickly through the snow from Regina to Prince Albert, which he garrisoned with 90 police. Superintendent Leif Crozier took a force of police, civilian volunteers and a 7-pounder (3 kg) gun to Fort Carlton and attempted to seize a cache of supplies. In the process, Crozier confronted a larger force of rebels at Duck Lake, where his detachment came off much worse in the resulting fight. Emboldened, some of the Cree leaders, including Poundmaker and Big Bear, now joined the Métis in their revolt, although others continued to tacitly support the government, in part the result of the good relationship the police had built up with them. The police rapidly abandoned most of their posts along the valley, falling back to more easily defensible locations; Inspector Francis Dickens was forced to flee Fort Pitt with his men on a makeshift boat.

Meanwhile, more than 5,000 militia (the nascent Canadian army after the departure of British troops) commanded by Major-General Frederick Middleton hurried west along the Canadian Pacific Railway. Middleton split his forces into three groups and led the main column, intending to retake Batoche. The second column advanced to Battleford and then marched south to Cut Knife Creek, with 74 mounted police forming the advance guard. There the column surprised Poundmakers&#x27;s camp, but the attack by the advance troops failed and the government forces were forced to retreat. After many delays, Middleton finally attacked the rebel capital, winning the Battle of Batoche and forcing Riel to surrender, before relieving Prince Albert on May 20. The third column marched to Edmonton, supported by 20 mounted police and their 9-pounder (4 kg) gun, where the government captured Big Bear and the remnants of the rebel Cree. Riel was imprisoned by the mounted police at Regina, given a short trial, and hanged.

Middleton criticized Irvine and the mounted police for having remained in Prince Albert throughout the campaign, and for failing to reinforce him during the Battle of Batoche. The general recommended closing the force, and replacing it with a corps of mounted infantry. He publicly likened the police to &quot;gophers&quot;, who had retreated and hid during the fighting, and his complaints were picked up by the press. Irvine was criticized in the media for his lack of vigour and, lacking the support of the prime minister, he resigned the next year and was replaced by Lawrence Herchmer. In turn, Irvine complained about Crozier&#x27;s behaviour and &quot;the impetuosity displayed by both the police and volunteers&quot; at Duck Lake; when the details became public, Crozier resigned.

====Operations on the prairies====

In the years after the rebellion, the government&#x27;s National Policy to settle the north-west continued; by 1885, white settlers became the majority in the region as the railway brought in immigrants, and their numbers almost doubled over the course of the 1890s. The establishment of the mounted police was increased to 1,000 men in the aftermath of the rebellion, officially in order to cope with the growing white population, but also to prevent any future uprising by the Métis and First Nations. Levels of crime were initially low, with the police&#x27;s implementation of the law relatively informal, and focused on upholding the spirit, rather than the letter, of the law, but the force soon faced new challenges as the population grew.

Cattle ranchers had moved into the territories within a year of the police arriving, initially clustering around the police posts for protection. The government began to promote the development of the large ranches during the 1870s and early 1880s, enclosing land up to in size and excluding smaller farmers. The police had close links to the ranch owners, and many of the first recruits had gone on to become ranchers themselves after leaving the force. Illegal squatting by poorer settlers started to become a problem, however, boiling over into open disputes during the 1890s, and the mounted police were deployed to evict them. The task was unpopular among the force, but it grudgingly complied until government policy towards the smaller settlers finally changed in 1896. The police provided a range of other services for the new ranches, carrying out operations along the border to prevent cattle crossing north into the Canadian ranches, running quarantine schemes and helping with veterinary issues.

The scale of horse theft by white thieves along the border increased dramatically during the late 1880s, which the police&#x27;s sporadic deployments were unable to counter. In response, Commissioner Herchmer introduced a system of police patrols across the territories, with scheduled visits and inspections supported by surprise &quot;flying patrols&quot;. This approach was enabled by a network of new outposts across the major ranches. Police would visit almost every farm or ranch, seek to get to know every member of the community personally, gather intelligence and ask each settler to record any issues in a patrol book. Along the way, the police helped to distribute relief, including to the Métis communities affected by the rebellion, provided emergency medical assistance, and delivered mail to the more remote areas. Under the new patrol system, the mounted police travelled a total of on average each year on horseback. Backed by harsh sentences from the courts, the process virtually eliminated rural crime.

A new system of controlling the movement of the First Nations was introduced by the government after the rebellion. Known as the pass system, this required any individual leaving a reserve to possess a pass signed by a government agent, or to face arrest by the police. The police received advice that the new policy was illegal, as it contravened Treaty 7, which had given guarantees of free movement, but they continued to enforce it for several years. Eventually the force turned to the vagrancy laws as an alternative approach for removing First Nations from selected areas. Police used agents employed to collect intelligence from within First Nation and Métis communities, and, from 1887, they also employed members of the First Nations as special constables, typically deploying them as scouts and trackers. These scouts wore an informal uniform and were empowered to arrest other members of their communities, but not whites.

Enforcing the prohibition on liquor began to cause the force increasing problems. The liquor laws had been designed to prevent the First Nations from drinking alcohol, but their terms also applied to the increasing numbers of white settlers in the late 1880s. Although some temperance groups applauded the measures, most settlers opposed them. Special permits to import alcohol for personal consumption could be granted, but these were not issued impartially, adding to the general resentment. Many members of the force drank alcohol themselves, including liquor confiscated from smugglers, and police beer canteens were established to provide members of the force a legal alternative. Settlers also began to routinely evade the laws in the larger towns, despite mounted police searches, the deployment of undercover officers, and large fines being imposed by the courts. Public hostility towards the force grew and the police soon found themselves almost entirely occupied in attempting to enforce the unpopular laws. Legal changes were pushed through in 1892, removing prohibition and allowing the licensing of public bars; the new law was enforced by local town inspectors, removing most of the force&#x27;s responsibility for the problem.

As there were almost no white women on the Prairies, the influx of the male work crews for the railroad together with the mines being opened in the foothills of the Rocky mountains created an immense demand for prostitution, which flourished as a result. Prostitution was illegal, but the NWMP tended to see it as a &quot;necessary evil&quot;, arguing that the male workers wanted sex, and that to shut down the brothels would cause unmanageable social tensions. Between 1874 and 1890, there were only 12 convictions for prostitution in the North-West, which reflected the &quot;necessary evil&quot; policy of tolerating prostitution. The fact that the men of the NWMP themselves frequently made use of the services of the prostitutes was another reason to tolerate the brothels. In an editorial, the &quot;Regina Leader&quot; mockingly noted the &quot;redcoat of the Mounted Policeman is seen flashing in and out from these dens at all hours. As no arrests have been made the character of these visits can be easily surmised!&quot;. Commissioner Herchemer complained that venereal diseases caused more medical treatments in the NWMP than any other, leading him to deduct the costs of medical treatment from the venereal diseases from the pay of the men concerned.

The policy of the NWMP was to allow red-light districts to exist. However, every so often, they would launch a raid to shut down a brothel; this was in order to give the impression that the prostitution was not being tolerated. From 1890, pressure from Protestant churches led to a crackdown being launched on prostitution. However, the campaign was ineffective as the NWMP would raid a brothel and offer the madam the choice of paying a fine or leaving town; generally the latter option was taken. No sooner had the brothel been shut down, then another would open a few weeks later, leading to the cycle being repeated. An additional problem for the NWMP was the fact that the pay for a constable was 60 cents per day, making it difficult as an NWMP to recruit &quot;men of good character and steady habits&quot;. By 1904, an average of 10% of the force either were being dismissed or had deserted to the United States. Given that the average age for a NWMP constable was between 20 and 25 and the majority were unmarried, there was a marked tendency for them to associate with the &quot;sporting women&quot; as prostitutes were euphemistically described. The NWMP &quot;necessary evil&quot; policy caused much tension with Protestant churches and civic groups that demanded that prostitution be stamped out in the early 20th century. In 1907, following complaints that a brothel full of Japanese prostitutes was operating in Nose Creek just outside of Calgary, Superintendent Dean of the NWMP refused to shut it down, saying the brothel was medically inspected every 9 days and to shut it down would cause venereal diseases to spread, leading to a furor in the Calgary newspapers.

===Later years (1895–1914)===

====Growth of urban centres====

Towards the end of the 19th century, immigration, urbanization and industrialization transformed the territories, destroying the old frontier way of life. Three million immigrants arrived in Canada between 1910 and 1914, many of them from eastern Europe, and over half of them settled in the territories. The urban population grew significantly as new towns were established across the Prairies. Many of the immigrants were employed by the growing industries of the region, especially the large mining and manufacturing centres enabled by the Canadian Pacific Railway. As society changed, there were fears of immigrants and criminals exploiting the new rail network.

As a result, there were a growing range of demands on the mounted police, and they struggled to cope with the changes. The rising population drove an increase in the criminal cases tackled by the force: less than 1,000 were investigated in 1900, but within four years the number of cases had risen to over 4,000. There was controversy around what role the mounted police should play in the new towns, and the force became concerned that these were pulling in police manpower, at the expense of the wider, less populated areas of the Prairies, where the patrolling system had already had to be cut back. A special railway branch was briefly established in 1888, using undercover officers positioned along the railway line to gather intelligence, and plans were put forward, but not enacted, to create a larger detective branch. Attempts were made to enforce the prostitution laws in the new towns – previously these had been largely ignored – with the police informally regulating the local sex industries.

There was pressure on the mounted police to assist local government in a wide variety of ways, often opposed by the police themselves. These included supporting public health efforts, distributing relief, fighting and investigating fires, and continuing to manage the movement of cattle. New railway lines continued to be constructed, and the police were tasked to assist in the building the Canadian Northern and Grand Trunk Pacific lines, as well as the Crow&#x27;s Nest Pass branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway, following the pattern set by their earlier work in the 1880s. There was a heavy legal load on the force&#x27;s commissioned officers both in their role as magistrates and as informal arbitrators between company management and the construction teams.

====Industrial relations====

The new industrial workforce often lived and worked under very poor conditions, and enjoyed few employment rights. Workers who left their jobs in protest could find themselves arrested by the mounted police under the terms of the Masters and Servants Act for deserting their employment, or alternatively detained under the vagrancy laws. Although the position of organized labour was weak in Canada – the trade unions only had very limited legal rights – the number of industrial disputes grew significantly over this period. The resulting lockouts and strikes sometimes required armed government intervention. The militia was most commonly used for this purpose, but the mounted police were cheaper to deploy and were considered to be more politically reliable.

As a result, the force was called in to manage industrial disputes on a range of occasions between 1887 and 1906. In the mining town of Lethbridge, for example, the Alberta Railway and Coal Company locked out its workforce in 1894 during an attempt to cut staff and reduce wages; a team of ten police was deployed to maintain order, in particular any risks posed by eastern European immigrants, and to mediate in the dispute. Police deployed there again in 1906 for nine months during a dispute between the company, now called the Alberta Railway and Irrigation Company, and the workforce over union recognition, pay and working conditions. A team of 82 regular police were reinforced by 11 special constables recruited from within the company, with an undercover constable deployed to infiltrate the strike and send back intelligence. Efforts were made to collect information on the earnings of the union leaders, probably intended for use in discrediting them. The police maintained order and escorted non-striking workers past the picket lines.

Historians hold differing views as to whether the mounted police were neutral in these disputes or sided with the employers, although all agree that the position of the police in managing the strikes became more difficult as organized labour became better established. The mounted police disliked labour agitators and strikers with eastern or southern European backgrounds, but they also had some sympathy for the difficulties faced by ordinary workers, and were often unwilling to actively assist the company owners if there was a risk it might cause disturbances to break out.

====Klondike Gold Rush====
Up until the 1890s, the government had no presence in the far north-west of Canada. In 1894, the rise of gold mining and a growing population led to calls for Ottawa to intervene, both to control whisky trading and to protect the local First Nations. In response, the mounted police carried out a survey along the Yukon River and gathered customs duties. Fears grew that the United States might try to seize the mineral-rich region, and a twenty-man police team was established at Forty Mile in 1895. Although there was very little actual crime, frictions soon rose between the police and the Miners&#x27; Committees, which had been created to provide informal justice during the previous few years. The police brought the issue to a head in June 1896, sending a team into one of the mining camps to overturn the decisions of the local committee.

In 1896, huge amounts of gold were discovered in the Klondike valley. Once news of this circulated the following year, around 100,000 people rushed to the Klondike in search of wealth, most with no experience in the mining industry. To reach the area, many prospectors travelled by foot over arduous mountain routes and along rivers using primitive boats, although no more than 40,000 of them successfully reached the goldfields. A substantial and expensive mounted police detachment was established in the Klondike, amounting to 288 men by 1898, representing around a third of the entire force and including many of its most experienced personnel.

The borders in the region had been disputed since the American purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867, and most of the influx of prospectors were American. Amid fresh concerns that the United States might annex the gold fields, the mounted police were tasked to assert Canadian control along the border line. The force set up control posts at the borders of the Yukon and at easily controlled mountain passes, equipping the posts with Maxim guns. The police checked for illegal weapons and prevented the entry of criminals and collected customs duties, while helping protect and guide the flow of migrants, mediating in their disputes and providing practical advice.

The mounted police established their headquarters in the boomtown of Dawson City and patrolled out across the Yukon Territory, creating a network of thirty-three posts. Detectives were deployed to infiltrate American organizations to seek out potential conspiracies. The police&#x27;s role also encompassed fire safety, the management of local game hunting, operating the postal and telegraph system, acting as coroners and running the mining registration system. The historian Morris Zaslow describes the Yukon as forming a &quot;police state&quot; during this period, and William Morrison has highlighted the force&#x27;s paternalistic willingness to invent and enforce non-existent laws whenever they considered it necessary. The police acted efficiently and with probity during the period, largely curbing criminality in the region, although their task was helped by the geography of the Klondike, which made it relatively easy to bar entry to undesirables. The Klondike gold rush attracted immense worldwide publicity at the time, and the contrast between the relative order of Dawson City in the Yukon vs. the more chaotic and violent situation in Skagway, Alaska caused much comment in the newspapers. Reflecting the improved image of the NWMP, in 1897 as part of the celebrations of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria, a group of NWMP riders clad in their colorful scarlet uniforms marched down the streets of London as part of the Canadian contingent. The NWMP riders caused a sensation in London, and it was from that time onward the romantic image of the Mounties became popular in Britain.

====Second Boer War====

When the Second Boer War broke out in 1899, many members of the mounted police wanted to volunteer to serve in South Africa, motivated by sympathy for the British imperial cause and the strong military tradition within the force. Indeed, Commissioner Herchmer had proposed sending a force of 350 men to join the Sudan campaign in 1896, but was turned down by his superiors. There was public enthusiasm for a Canadian military response; however, at first, it appeared that only a minimal deployment would be needed, and it was only after several British defeats that an offer of a more substantive force was welcomed by London. The Canadian government turned to the mounted police as their main source for experienced mounted soldiers, and members were given leave from the force for the duration of their service. Combined with the pressures of maintaining the commitments in the Yukon, this reduced the number of the police in the remaining territories to only 682 men by 1900. The similarity of the vast expenses of the &quot;veld&quot; to the Prairies was felt to make the NWMP well qualified for operations in South Africa. Herchmer was an efficient bureaucrat, but his authoritarian leadership style made him ill-suited to &quot;handle the hardy dare-devils&quot; who rushed to join up to fight for Queen and Country in South Africa.

Herchmer recruited and commanded a group of 144 mounted police volunteers, who made up almost half of the new 2nd Battalion of the Canadian Mounted Rifles; many of the other volunteers in the battalion were also ex-policemen. The NWMP influence on the Canadian Mounted Rifles battalion was strong; of the officers of the battalion, 13 out of 19 were NWMP men. Of the policemen who volunteered to fight in South Africa, 67.4% were British-born while the remainder were Canadian-born, reflecting the tendency of male British immigrants in Canada to be the ones most likely to volunteer for service in South Africa. Soon after the battalion&#x27;s arrival in South Africa, however, Herchmer&#x27;s superior, Major General Edward Hutton, concluded that Herchmer was unsuited for military command and retired him from duty. Herchmer complained to the prime minister, who then dismissed him from the police altogether, replacing him with Aylesworth Perry, a career policeman and a supporter of the Liberal government.

The mounted police influenced the creation of other imperial units during the conflict. Lord Strathcona, the Canadian High Commissioner in London, raised a unit of mounted infantry modelled on the force, believing this would be particularly suitable for taking on Boer scouting parties. Thirty-three serving members of the police joined the unit, including Superintendent Samuel Steel, who became their commanding officer. The Strathconas wore the mounted police&#x27;s Stetson hat as part of their uniform, while in turn their distinctive boots were adopted by the police as their official footwear in 1901. The South African Constabulary was created in October 1900 to police the recaptured territories; it mirrored the mounted police, with its members again wearing the force&#x27;s Stetson hat; it incorporated forty-two members of the mounted police and one of its divisions was commanded by Steele. The mounted police volunteers suffered seven casualties during the conflict. Sergeant Arthur Richardson, a member of the Strathconas, won the Victoria Cross for rescuing a Canadian soldier under heavy fire at Wolve Spruit. In 1904, the Crown renamed the force the Royal Northwest Mounted Police to honour its contributions in the war.

====Controversy and criticism====

The mounted police continued to face criticism after 1885, through a sequence of allegations in the popular press known as the &quot;Herchmer scandals&quot;. Lawrence Herchmer had been appointed as commissioner partially because of his positive reputation within the Indian Department, but also because of his Conservative sympathies and his family links to Prime Minister Macdonald. Herchmer&#x27;s brother William – himself a mounted police superintendent – had arrested the newspaper-owner Nicholas Davin for public drunkenness several years before. Apparently motivated by a desire for revenge, Davin pursued a vendetta against Lawrence when he became commissioner, helped by another newspaper publisher, Charles Wood. Lawrence Herchmer was unpopular with many of his officers and Davin published their critiques of him, along with accusations of a wide range of misdemeanours. The government ordered an investigation, followed by a judicial inquiry, both of which cleared Herchmer of any serious charges.

Nonetheless, the force&#x27;s reputation suffered from the controversy and complaints persisted that the force was oversized, excessively funded and staffed by political appointees. By the 1890s, a political consensus had emerged in Ottawa that the western provinces should become autonomous and take up responsibility for their own policing; it was therefore time to plan for the closure of the force, which originally had only been intended to be a temporary organization. The force was reduced to 850 men in 1893, and to 750 by 1898. The Conservative government stood for reelection in 1896 with plans to further reduce the size of the force, reportedly to 500 men, but lost to the Liberal party, led by Wilfrid Laurier. The new prime minister had stood for election on a platform of increasing the rights of the provinces to carry out law enforcement. He produced plans to halve the size of the mounted police as a first step towards eliminating the force, and proposed to establish a new militia regiment in the NWT to fulfil any legacy military requirements.

The events of the Klondike Gold Rush challenged this policy, as the force soon became essential to controlling the borders in the far north. Moving the entire force to the remote region of the Yukon, though, would have more than doubled the cost of the police&#x27;s training and support arrangements, and their existing bases therefore remained vital to the northern operations. The increasing demands from the railway companies and mining companies for police assistance, and appeals from the ranching community for continued support, also made it harder for the Liberals to consider cutting back the force. The Second Boer War then disrupted plans to create a replacement militia unit, while Herchmer&#x27;s disastrous tour in South Africa enabled the Liberals to replace him with Perry, a Liberal supporter. As a result, the political argument began to swing back in favour of potentially retaining the force.

After the 1904 elections, the new provincial governments of Alberta and Saskatchewan announced their desire to take on similar responsibilities to those in the eastern provinces, but showed no sign of actually establishing provincial police forces of their own. Finally, Laurier proposed in 1905 that the mounted police should remain in the new provinces, under contract to the provincial authorities for $75,000 (~$ in ) per year apiece – about one-third of the actual operational cost – a solution which was approved by both sides. The workload on the police grew quickly as a consequence, with the criminal cases being handled almost trebling between 1905 and 1912 to over 13,000. Despite complaints from Commissioner Perry, the government refused to increase the establishment of the mounted police. By 1913, the provinces were expressing dissatisfaction about the service being delivered, and Saskatchewan indicated its intention not to renew the contract in 1916.

====Expansion into the north====

After the Klondike Gold Rush, the mounted police continued to spread their network of posts across the far north. In 1903, a small team of police under Inspector Charles Constantine were sent to Herschel Island to investigate the alleged sexual mistreatment of Inuit women by the transient whaling community there; the decision was also driven by fears that the United States might try to assert sovereignty over the wider Mackenzie Delta. The police found no evidence of sexual abuse, but took the opportunity to collect customs duties and to attempt to clamp down on liquor sales to the indigenous community. The same year, a well-publicized Canadian expedition was sent to Hudson Bay on the schooner SS &quot;Neptune&quot;, including Superintendent John Moodie and a small team of mounted police.

Extending the police&#x27;s presence across the region was logistically challenging, requiring the creation of a network of new posts and the use of steamers to move supplies around the coast. It proved to be a harsh existence for the force, particularly when deliveries of supplies were delayed by bad weather. Work began on a railroad to Hudson Bay in 1908, continuing for two decades, which, although it required substantial police assistance, gradually eased the challenge of supplying the police outposts around the bay. The police opened temporary detachments around York Factory in 1912, and then at Port Nelson in 1913, where the police established their divisional headquarters. Patrols pushed up into Baker Lake and along the Coppermine River until, by the end of the decade, the police presence in Hudson Bay had been reduced to a bare minimum, with the force focusing on reaching out into ever more remote areas.

The First Nations in the north typically had some prior experience of Europeans, for example through contact with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, and there was little conflict between the police and these native communities, and few crimes committed. The First Nations typically did not like the police, however, and often blamed them for wider government policies; for their part, the mounted police often regarded the First Nations with contempt. By comparison, the mounted police got on much better with the Inuit, who had seen far less contact with Europeans. The force generally took a more liberal, paternalistic attitude towards them, often applying informal justice rather than official laws when the occasional Inuit crime was committed. Members of the First Nations and Inuit were employed to drive police dog sleds and cook for their patrols.

===Final years (1914–1920)===
====First World War====

When Canada entered the First World War in 1914, the government became concerned that national security might be threatened, either by immigrants who still sympathized with their home countries in central Europe, or from citizens of the United States with German or Irish backgrounds crossing over the border. The authorities introduced new war-time secrecy regulations, including the censorship of the press. The responsibility for tackling these tasks was assigned to the federal Dominion Police but they had very limited resources; indeed, before the war they had often had to hire private detectives from the United States. The Dominion Police therefore delegated much of their responsibilities to local police forces, including, in the cases of the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, to the mounted police.

The mounted police initially began their wartime operations by focusing on the activities of immigrants and carrying out border security, but quickly widened their operations. Unlike during the Boer War, the mounted police at first were forbidden to volunteer for military duty abroad, and the size of the force was instead temporarily increased to 1,200 men. The force investigated rumours of conspiracies associated with the Central Powers, but, since most mounted police did not have links within the relevant ethnic communities, they instead used secret agents and informants to gather intelligence, supported by a few undercover officers. Meanwhile, tensions grew between temperance campaigners and soldiers over the implementation of the liquor laws. The police barracks in Calgary were attacked in October 1916 by a crowd of over two hundred soldiers and civilians, who were trying to release six soldiers arrested for alcohol offences. The building was destroyed, one police officer was shot and several more injured.

The demands of the force&#x27;s new security role, combined with its traditional policing responsibilities, soon overstretched the police&#x27;s resources. Commissioner Perry raised his concerns about the situation with the government and in response the Alberta and the Saskatchewan Provincial Police forces were created, allowing the closure of over 80 mounted police posts. Perry argued that the force had now &quot;largely finished the work for which it was called into existence&quot; and proposed that the mounted police should instead focus on supporting the Canadian Expeditionary Force in Europe, threatening to resign if the police were not allowed to fight. Despite complaints from the military that there was no longer any requirement for cavalry on the Western Front, a force of 738 mounted police were sent overseas in May 1918 to form &quot;A&quot; Squadron, and a further 186 were deployed to Siberia to support the British forces engaged in the Russian Civil War. By December, there were only 303 mounted police left in Canada, primarily focused on border protection, and the intelligence networks created earlier in the war were allowed to wind down.

====Bolshevik fears====

Conscription was introduced in Canada during the final years of the war, which was accompanied by labour shortages, pressures for social change, and the rapid unionization of the remaining workforce. While concerns about the Central Powers declined, fears grew in government at the end of 1918 that the new Bolshevik government in Russia might be covertly orchestrating a campaign of strikes across Canada. In response the Prime Minister, Robert Borden, created a Public Safety Branch led by the politician Charles Cahan. Cahan envisaged transforming this organization into a much larger secret service, similar to the Bureau of Investigation in the United States, but he soon fell out with Borden and ultimately resigned.

Meanwhile, Commissioner Perry had put forward three options for the future of the mounted police: the force could be absorbed into the Canadian military; the remit of the force could be reduced to simply policing the far north; or the force could be assigned a much wider role in public and secret policing across the whole of Canada. Perry promoted the third option and Arthur Meighen, the acting Minister for Justice, therefore proposed merging the mounted police and the Dominion Police, placing them under Perry&#x27;s command. This idea was turned down by Borden, who believed, incorrectly, that the merger would be unacceptable to Perry, whom he thought still wanted a military future for the force.

Instead, in December 1918, Borden reorganized the federal Canadian security system by splitting the policing of the country geographically, with the mounted police running the western half and reporting to the President of the Privy Council, and the Dominion Police running the eastern side, under the oversight of the Minister of Justice. The establishment of the mounted force was to be permanently kept at 1,200 men, creating a huge demand for manpower: those members of the force still serving in Europe and Siberia were ordered to return. The police began to recruit new networks of secret agents, whom Perry tasked to investigate &quot;foreign settlements&quot; to identify &quot;the least indication of Bolshevik tendencies and doctrines&quot;, and the force embraced new laws allowing for the deportation, without trial, of immigrants suspected of holding extremist views. The police&#x27;s operations were well run, although no significant evidence of any Bolshevik plot was actually discovered.

====Amalgamation====

The government remained deeply concerned about the Bolshevik threat, and in May 1919 the Winnipeg General Strike broke out, creating a national crisis which ministers feared would lead to a revolution. The mounted police were deployed to maintain public order and generate intelligence on the strikers; 245 mounted police were sent into the city, supported by four machine guns mounted on lorries. On June 21, which became known as Bloody Saturday, military veterans marched through the city in support of the strikers; the authorities called in the mounted police to break up the marchers. By the time the police arrived, the protesters had begun to riot and the police carried out two mounted charges. The police then concluded that they were losing control of the situation and fired their revolvers into the crowd, killing one man and injuring others. The marchers fled and the strike collapsed.

The events in Winnipeg highlighted the chaotic and ill-coordinated management of security issues across Canada, the artificial division between policing organizations in the west and east of the country, and the absence of a single senior leader for security work. Commissioner Perry recommended creating a new federal police force, ideally by amalgamating the Dominion Police into the existing mounted police force. The mounted police, he argued, were much larger, militarized, experienced and had a proven capacity to carry out secret intelligence work. They were also free from union influence and enjoyed high prestige among the public.

In response, Prime Minister Borden amended the policing legislation in November 1919, bringing together the RNWMP and the Dominion Police to form the RCMP, with the new force responsible for federal law enforcement and national security across Canada under the command of Perry. The legislation came into effect on February 1, 1920, officially marking the end of the older force.

==Organization and working life==
===Structure===

When the NWMP was formed in 1873, it initially had a rank structure of inspectors, sub-inspectors, staff constables, constables and sub-constables, with the force as a whole headed by the commissioner and the assistant commissioner: this system reflected that in use in the Royal Irish Constabulary, upon which the force was modelled. In 1878 this structure was overhauled and replaced by a hierarchy of superintendents, inspectors, staff sergeants, sergeants, corporals and constables. Informally, the commissioned officers were often referred to by equivalent army titles, the commissioner being associated with the rank of colonel, with superintendents and inspectors using the titles of major and captain respectively. Over the course of its life, the force had five commissioners: George French from 1873 to 1876, James Macleod to 1880, Acheson Irvine to 1886, Lawrence Herchmer to 1900 and Aylesworth Perry, who led the force until its amalgamation in 1920.

Although at first the force answered to the prime minister, in 1876 control was passed to the Secretary of State, an arrangement which was reinforced in the Mounted Police Act of 1879. The mounted police&#x27;s rules and regulations were initially very informal, drawing on the Mounted Police Act of 1873 and a &quot;Rules and Regulations&quot; document published in 1874. In the absence of further guidance, its officers made ad hoc use of British military regulations, effectively managing the force as they might have done a cavalry regiment. This led to a rather disorganized approach, and in 1886 Superintendent Richard Dean issued a revised set of standing orders, followed by a much longer, &quot;Regulations and Orders&quot; booklet in 1889. This framework empowered the Assistant Commissioner to monitor, inspect and investigate all aspects of the force, and encouraged a much more disciplined approach to tracking operations and resources.

The force was divided into various divisions, each typically commanded by a superintendent. The headquarters of the force was initially sited at Lower Fort Garry, until the March West to Fort Walsh, but in 1888 it was moved to Regina, to be closer to the new railway line. The Regina headquarters became known locally as &quot;the Barracks&quot;, and during the 1890s typically held around 200 police at any one time. Many of the force&#x27;s posts were linked by the telegraph network and, from 1885 onwards, by telephones, with the communications encrypted when necessary using Slater&#x27;s Telegraphic Code. Typewriters were acquired in 1886, and a printing press for disseminating orders in 1888. The force did not have its own prison – those sentenced to prison terms would be sent to the Manitoba Penitentiary – and until 1891 the only short-term jail facilities in the territories were the guardrooms of the force&#x27;s various divisional headquarters.

Although the force was commanded by its commissioner, there was also an influential senior post of comptroller, created in 1880 in response to Macleod&#x27;s financial mismanagement of the force. For most of the force&#x27;s history the role was occupied by Frederick White, until replaced by A. A. Mclean in 1913. The comptroller was responsible for keeping account of expenditure, auditing and managing procurement, and effectively removed most of the non-operational functions from the commissioner&#x27;s responsibility. White was a political client of Prime Minister John A. Macdonald, who took a close interest in the management of the force, and the post became critical for garnering support from Ottawa for investment in the police.

===Commissioned officers===

The NWMP was commanded by a relatively small team of commissioned officers, having an establishment of 25 officers in its early years, of whom around a quarter were medical and veterinary officers, rising to 50 after 1885, a ratio of approximately one officer to every twenty enlisted men. The officers were usually from middle- or upper-class backgrounds, and were typically Canadian-born; deliberate attempts were made to reflect the different religious and ethnic groups that made up white Canadian society. They depended on political patronage from the government of the day in Ottawa for their appointment and career progression, and were typically selected on the basis of their military experience, service in the police ranks or previous study at the Royal Military College in Ontario.

The officer corps formed part of the social elite in Canada, and considered themselves to be much closer to the prestigious, regular military than to their equivalents in the local police forces. Commissioned officers were expected to join and participate in an officers&#x27; mess, which the police based on the corresponding military tradition. Many were members of the Freemasons, a popular movement among Protestant Canadians. The officers were made Justices of Peace, giving them powers to try civilian cases, and they also had authority to summarily try members of the force itself, potentially imprisoning constables for up a year for even minor offences.

Commissioned officers were paid a respectable wage for the period; an inspector in 1886 earned an annual salary of $1,000 (approximately $ in ). Early in the force&#x27;s history, additional payments were made to officers for successfully collecting customs duties and seizing illegal goods; Superintendent Leif Crozier was paid a bonus of $3,659 in 1886 (approximately $ in ), for example. Once an officer had purchased items such as their uniform, which would cost around $500, and maintained a presence at key social events, however, this salary was thinly stretched. Most officers found it difficult to support a family on their police income alone, and either relied on their private wealth, or took on additional paid roles and government offices. Commissioned officers were members of the civil service pension scheme, but this was increasingly regarded as inadequate and their pension provisions were reformed in 1902.

===Other ranks===

The first enlisted men to be recruited in 1873 came from a wide variety of backgrounds, but most had some military experience. Many of the men enlisting in this tranche were later dismissed as unsuitable for service, less than half completing their term of enlistment, and more care was taken in later recruiting. Initially, a majority of the force were of Canadian origin but the number originating from Britain rose steadily during the 1880s until they made up over half of all new recruits, with British-born mounted police also tending to predominate in the non-commissioned cadre, mainly because they chose to stay longer in the force. Although the number of Canadian-born recruits increased for a while, the economic boom of the 1910s made the task much harder, and the mounted police opened a recruitment office in London; by 1914 almost 80 percent of the force had been born in Britain.

The first contingent of police enlisted for a three-year term of service, but later recruits enlisted for five year periods, with the possibility of their purchasing an early discharge. Early in the force&#x27;s history, the training of recruits was carried out on an ad hoc basis at the police&#x27;s headquarters; in response, a depot for training new recruits created in Regina in 1885, based on the Royal Irish Constabulary Depot in Dublin, which took a much more structured approach. The use of the depot declined in line with the reduced number of new recruits joining the force after 1895, and was ultimately replaced by the new School of Instruction in 1899. Efforts were taken throughout the 1880s and 1890s to improve the quality of recruits being accepted by the force, and to tackle the related problems of early discharge and desertion, which was making staff retention a serious problem.

Sub-constables, initially the lowest rank in the force, were paid 75 cents a day in 1873, with a promise of of land on completion of their enlistment, but the pay was cut by a third in 1878 and the land grants ceased. As a result, constables were paid a basic wage of 50 cents a day, with basic provisions included, with a senior non-commissioned officer earning three times as much. Combined with &quot;working pay&quot; bonuses for particular duties, a constable could earn over $300 a year, which was initially about the same as a Canadian school teacher. At the start of the 20th century, the rates of police pay were unchanged and had become quite low by wider Canadian standards; they were slowly increased, the basic rate rising to $1 a day in 1905, and then to $1.50 and finally $1.75 by 1919. A pension scheme was introduced in 1889, albeit in the face of political opposition.

Early in the force&#x27;s history, the police lived in buildings that they termed &quot;forts&quot;, typically one-storey buildings constructed by the police themselves from logs, with sod roofs. In the first year of the force, the poorly constructed fort at Swan River drew particular condemnation from senior officers: Commissioner French complained to Ottawa about the &quot;exposure and hardship&quot; that the police detachment were enduring. Even once the force was properly established, living conditions remained very basic: the forts used wood- and coal-burning stoves for heating and cooking, and were lit by oil lamps and candles, while the constables slept on wooden boards using straw-filled mattresses. In the early 1880s, conditions grew so bad that the constables at Fort Macleod issued a manifesto to their officers demanding improvements to their living conditions.

Gradual improvement began to be made in the 1880s and 1890s; the later police barracks lost the title of &quot;fort&quot; and were professionally assembled, made from planed lumber, often prefabricated in the east, and fitted with modern technology and iron beds. Canteens, reading rooms and sporting facilities were introduced at the larger barracks. Nonetheless, living conditions on the prairies remained difficult and spartan, and mosquitoes, lice and bed bugs were major irritants. When the force deployed to the far north, the police were once again living in extremely basic conditions, in a very dangerous climate; a network of small shelters had to be built to protect units out on patrol, although these did not prevent the well-publicized deaths of the &quot;Lost Patrol&quot; of Inspector Francis Fitzgerald during the winter of 1910–11.

The initial ranks for other ranks were Sub-constable, Constable, and Chief constable, with Staff constable between Constable and Chief constable added later. Though through the early years many enlisted members, as with officers, would refer to themselves by their former military ranks or the military equivalent of their NWMP rank.

==Uniform and badge==

The first recruits to the force in 1873 were issued uniforms comprising scarlet Norfolk jackets – issued from the militia stores and chosen on the advice of Colonel Patrick Robertson Ross and Governor Alexander Morris – brown belts, white helmets, grey breeches and brown boots, with a round forage cap for their undress uniform. The grey trousers were soon replaced with blue ones, with a yellow stripe along the sides. These early uniforms were quite plain, and commissioned officers and their enlisted men wore essentially the same uniform.

Changes were made in 1876, introducing more elaborate uniforms for commissioned officers based on those worn by the 13th Hussars, with similarly militaristic uniforms for the other ranks, using gold braid to distinguish the non-commissioned officers. These uniforms were initially of rather low quality, as the government had contracted out the work to prison convicts. The winter uniforms comprised grey overcoats with fur caps and moccasins, although the police preferred wearing warmer buffalo coats, which were available until the herds died out. In 1886, the hussar-style uniforms were replaced by a simpler dragoon version, and dark-blue undress uniforms introduced. In the 1880s, blue pea jackets made from pilot cloth became popular among the police as part of their winter outfit, and were officially issued from 1893 onwards. There were continual attempts to produce a consistent uniform across the force, but this was only ever partially successful due to the multiple government suppliers who each produced slightly different variants.

A tension remained between uniforms which were perceived as smart, reflecting the force&#x27;s military heritage, and practical uniforms which were suitable for the daily work of the police. The mounted police&#x27;s white helmets, forage caps and tight tunics were impractical for work on the plains, and a set of clothes termed &quot;prairie dress&quot; instead evolved unofficially, becoming the dominant style of uniform in the force by 1900. Prairie dress typically included a buckskin jacket, oilskins for wet weather, and leather leggings, combined with a wide-brimmed felt hat: by the late 1890s, the Stetson was the headgear of choice. A standardized form of prairie dress, called patrol dress, was formalized in time for the 1897 Jubilee celebrations, featuring a brown duck stable jacket. By the turn of the century, many police were wearing a combination of a red serge tunic, cut to resemble the prairie dress tunic, and the Stetson hat, a combination which later became famous.

The first police to deploy to the Yukon equipped themselves with specialized cold-weather clothing, and subsequent detachments were equipped with deer-skin parkas, fur hats and boots. In the more extreme conditions of the far north, the police adopted local Inuit clothing for use on their patrols, even though this required daily maintenance, often carried out by local Inuit women. Mounted police deployed to Siberia wore the standard army khaki uniform used by mounted forces.

The force&#x27;s badge emerged around 1876 and became commonly used by the late 1890s. It comprised a buffalo or bison head, maple leaves, a crown – early on, the St Edward&#x27;s crown, after 1903, the Tudor crown – and the police&#x27;s motto. The motto originally ran &quot;Maintien le Droit&quot;, meaning &quot;to maintain the right&quot;, but after 1915 was altered to read &quot;Maintiens le Droit&quot;. The expression &quot;They always get their man&quot;, or &quot;The Mountie always gets his man&quot;, associated with the force since 1877, has no official standing, but comes from the adaptation created by Hollywood from an American newspaper report, in the Fort Benton (Montana) Record from April 1877. Despite being a French phrase, this was a 14th-century English motto, first used in Canada by the Grand Trunk Railway Regiment, and it remains unclear why it was adopted by the mounted police. There are several explanations for the use of the buffalo head: it may have been due to Inspector James Macleod&#x27;s use of a buffalo head in his office in the mid-1870s, or may have been a prairie adaption of the Clan MacLeod&#x27;s bull badge.

==Equipment==
===Weaponry===

The mounted police were established to be an armed force, primarily due to the perceived threat from the First Nations on the prairies. The police were initially equipped with the Snider-Enfield Carbine Mark III and the Snider-Enfield Short Rifle, but these were single-shot breechloaders, and inferior to the repeating weapons already being used by Indian groups in the United States. These were replaced with the Winchester Model 1876 repeating rifle from 1878 onwards, but the new guns proved quite delicate and did not perform effectively during the 1885 rebellion. In 1895, the force began to replace the ageing Winchesters with the Lee–Metford carbine, but these rifles still used black powder and did not perform as well as hoped. The program was halted and instead the smokeless powder Lee–Enfield—the SMLE (Short Magazine Lee–Enfield Mk I)—was introduced in 1902 as the standard police small arm. The very limited supplies of ammunition held by the force meant that the police had few opportunities to practice with their weapons, and as a result their marksmanship was typically quite poor.

In addition to rifles and carbines, the police also sometimes carried revolvers. The early recruits used .44 calibre Smith &amp; Wesson American Model and .450 calibre Adams revolvers; Tranter revolvers; the Enfield Mark II revolver was introduced in 1882, but these were felt to be heavy and awkward, and were replaced by the Colt New Service Revolver in 1904. Smaller pocket revolvers, including the Smith &amp; Wesson .38 calibre Revolver, were purchased for use by undercover police officers.

When the force marched west in 1873, it brought twenty-five British Army 1868 pattern lances along on the expedition to impress the Blackfoot First Nation. The force also used swords, with the 1822 pattern British Light Cavalry sabre approved for commissioned officers, and the non-commissioned officers carrying the British 1853 pattern weapon; some constables unofficially equipped themselves with swords, despite Commissioner French having doubts about their utility. The policy around the carrying of these weapons was reviewed in 1880, due to concerns that swords were no longer practical in conflicts with the First Nations. Commissioner Irvine wanted to equip all of his force with swords for use in close quarter combat, while the authorities in Ottawa were opposed to any extension; as a compromise, some 1822 pattern swords were purchased for storage in the police armouries. In 1882, non-commissioned officers were authorized to carry the 1822 pattern sabre, and commissioned police officers adopted the new British 1896 pattern cavalry sword when it was issued a few years later. The mounted police deployed to Siberia at the end of the First World War carried the 1908 pattern cavalry sword.

The force was also equipped with artillery, primarily to deter attacks from the First Nations. In 1873, the force was assigned two 9-pounder (4 kg) Mark I muzzle-loading field guns and two 5.63 calibre brass mortars; a further four brass 7-pounder Mark II field guns were acquired in 1876. Despite requests for the force to be assigned machine-guns, two steel 7-pounder (3 kg) Mark II field guns were allocated instead in 1886, replacing two of the brass guns which were passed on to the militia. The machine-guns finally arrived in 1894, when two .303 calibre Maxim guns were approved for the police, with two more purchased in 1897. A final two bronze 7-pounder guns were donated to the force in 1900 by the Yukon Field Force. The 7-pounders acquired in 1876 saw service in the rebellion of the Métis, and one of these guns, combined with a 9-pounder, was later used to bombard and kill a fugitive member of the Cree First Nation, called Almighty Voice, in 1897.

===Horses and transport===

The mounted police initially deployed with 310 horses in 1873, both as mounts and as draught animals, but large numbers of these died on the march, and for much of the 1870s there were shortages of horses, impacting on the police&#x27;s work. The importance of horses to the force&#x27;s work grew, particularly once the new patrol system was introduced by Commissioner Herchmer. By the 1880s the police&#x27;s horses were looked after carefully and given good veterinarian support, although they were worked very hard. A large riding school was built in Regina at a cost of $30,000 in 1886 to allow training throughout the cold winter months. At their peak towards the end of the century, the force owned around 800 horses, and needed to purchase 100 new mounts each year. The police initially used a wide range of saddlery, mostly of the British Army&#x27;s Universal pattern, but this was found to be unsuitable for the prairies. After some experimentation, the force settled on the Western, or Californian, style of saddle in the 1880s, which was more comfortable for both the rider and horse.

The police did not rely solely on horses, using pack ponies and mules to carry equipment and supplies, and using oxen as draught animals in the early years of the force. Dog-sled teams and canoes were also used in the far north.

In the early 20th century, the development of the automobile began to make horses redundant for most police work, with the exception of crowd control. The force purchased its first car, a McLaughlin Model 55, in 1915, and mechanized its border patrols the following year, deploying a range of cars and motorcycles. By 1920, the mounted police owned 33 cars and trucks, and 28 motorcycles. There was a proposal in 1919 to equip the police with surplus wartime aircraft to create an &quot;Air Police Service&quot;, but it was turned down by the government.

The mounted police also purchased various boats for work along Canada&#x27;s coasts and rivers. The &quot;Keewatin&quot;, a sailing vessel, was bought in 1890 for use on Lake Winnipeg, but it capsized later the same year. In 1902, the steamboat &quot;Vidette&quot; was acquired to transport the police along the Yukon River, supported by three launches. &quot;Redwing&quot;, a small steamer, was purchased for transport on Lake Winnipeg in 1905. The police had the &quot;Rouville&quot; steamer specially constructed for patrolling in the far north in 1906, but tests demonstrated it burnt through too much fuel, and it was never deployed. By 1919, however, the &quot;Victory&quot;, &quot;Duncan&quot;, &quot;Lady Borden&quot; and &quot;Chakawana&quot; motor vessels were patrolling the far north and the west coast.

===Suppliers===
Early on in the force&#x27;s history, most of its equipment and weapons had to be imported from abroad, due to the lack of domestic Canadian industry. Its early saddlery and wagons were imported from the United States, although the police&#x27;s uniforms were made locally. After 1887, political pressure grew to use Canadian suppliers whenever possible. Supplies of food and similar goods were initially bought from the major trading companies in the west, such as the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, but this gradually changed once more of the territories were settled and goods could be purchased from smaller, local firms, with the police becoming an important source of business. Equipment and supplies had to be bought from companies that supported the government of the day, and after 1896 a formal list of politically approved suppliers was kept by the comptroller&#x27;s office. All of the police&#x27;s guns had to be imported, due to the lack of domestic manufacturers, and by 1890s the force was still buying most of its ammunition from abroad, as Canadian-manufactured cartridges remained substandard.

==Cultural legacy==
===Popular media===
The early reputation of the force was shaped by journalistic accounts published in the 1880s and 1890s, followed by various biographical accounts written by retired officers. The initial press response to the mounted police was mixed, particularly among Liberal newspapers, and focused on what the historian Michael Dawson describes as accounts of &quot;inefficiency, irresolution and impropriety&quot; within the new organization. In contrast, police memoirs promoted an image of a tough but fair force, focused on maintaining order in the wilderness. Quite quickly, however, a more heroic, romantic tone came to dominate newspaper accounts and a powerful myth was built up around the mounted police. This was reinforced by events such as the mounted police&#x27;s Musical Ride, performed for the first time in 1887, which entertained the crowds with cavalry charges and displays with lances.

The first appearance of the mounted police in fiction occurred in Joseph Collin&#x27;s &quot;The Story of Louis Riel&quot;, published in 1885. The police soon became a popular subject for writers, with over 150 novels about the force and its successor, the RCMP, being published between 1890 and 1940 across North America and Britain, along with magazine articles and publications for children. Gilbert Parker, James Curwood and Ralph Connor&#x27;s works proved particularly popular and influential. Connor&#x27;s &quot;Corporal Cameron&quot;, published in 1912, set the tone for many later books with a tale of its initially dissolute protagonist&#x27;s redemption through service with the police. Numerous poems were written about the force, with the best known probably being the &quot;Riders of the Plains&quot;, which was first published in 1878 and later expanded upon several times.

These novels used standard characters and plot. The mounted policeman was, as Dawson describes, an Anglo-Saxon, &quot;chivalric, self-abnegating hero&quot;, who would pursue his suspect – typically a foreigner or French-Canadian – across a hostile landscape, often overcoming them bloodlessly. The stories championed what the historian Andrew Graybill describes as &quot;Victorian manliness&quot;, with the narrative focusing on &quot;romance, manners and the preservation of justice through fair play&quot;. Within the genre, some national differences emerged. British writers often portrayed the police as upper-class colonial soldiers, carrying out their duty in serving the British Empire on the fringes of civilization. Canadian novels embraced much of this imperial narrative, but also depicted the force as a protector of wider moral authority and order, forming a reassuring, conservative image in the face of contemporary fears of immigrants and social instability. In contrast, authors in the United States usually reused familiar Western plot-lines, but using Canadian characters and scenery.

During the 1930s and 1940s, the force became the topic of many radio broadcasts and films. Radio series such as the &quot;Renfrew of the Mounted&quot; and &quot;Challenge of the Yukon&quot; continued the portrayal of the mounted police as iconic heroes, &quot;Challenge&quot; later translating onto television in the 1950s as &quot;Sergeant Preston of the Yukon&quot;. Over 250 films were made about the force in the 20th century, including the highly successful 1936 musical &quot;Rose Marie&quot;. The popularity of these films finally waned in the 1970s, although this image of the force continued to influence late-20th century television portrayals of the modern RCMP, such as the series &quot;Due South&quot; which centred on a mounted police constable from the Yukon.

===Historiography===
The extensive historical archives of the RNWMP were combined with those of its successor, the RCMP, in 1920, although the early archives from 1873 to 1885 had been destroyed in a fire in 1897. For most of the 20th century, the RCMP kept most of these historical archives closed, with the material inaccessible except to selected researchers, trusted to maintain a particular perspective on the police&#x27;s history. Historians had few other sources to work with other than the force&#x27;s own published annual accounts, autobiographies by members of the police, and popular narratives from the 19th century, and so their works tended to mirror the established image of the mounted police. The resulting histories put forward what the historian William Baker terms as &quot;episodic, nostalgic, eulogistic, antiquarian, non-scholarly, romantic, and heroic&quot; accounts of the force.

This traditional, historical portrayal of the NWMP influenced that of the RCMP, who used their predecessor&#x27;s history to build their own status as a Canadian national symbol. Although the RCMP as an organization formally dates from 1920, the modern force chose to trace its own history back to the foundation of the mounted police in 1873, rather than, for example, drawing on the Dominion Police&#x27;s foundation date of 1868. The RCMP&#x27;s centennial in 1973 saw celebratory events across Canada, various historical publications and even proposals – turned down by the mounted police – for a reenactment of the March West. The RCMP used the celebrations to redefine the early history of the mounted police in line with contemporary policing objectives, focusing on the force&#x27;s role in shaping the evolution of a liberal, tolerant, modern Canada.

During the early 1970s, professional historians began to reevaluate the force&#x27;s history. A wider set of themes, including social, race and class issues, began to be analysed, resulting in more challenging histories of the force being published. Legal challenges brought before the Canadian courts in the 1980s resulted in the release of archive material about the force&#x27;s role in the First World War for the first time, generating further new lines of research on their role in managing labour disputes and overseeing the changing security situation.

<text>Jerome Bernard Orbach (October 20, 1935 – December 28, 2004) was an American actor and singer, described at the time of his death as &quot;one of the last&quot; bona fide&quot; leading men of the Broadway musical and global celebrity on television&quot; and a &quot;versatile stage and film actor.&quot; Over his career he received a Tony Award and Screen Actors Guild Award as well as nominations for three Emmy Awards and a Grammy Award.

Orbach&#x27;s career began on the New York stage, both on and off-Broadway, where he created roles such as El Gallo in the original off-Broadway run of &quot;The Fantasticks&quot; (1960) where he was the first performer to sing that show&#x27;s standard &quot;Try to Remember.&quot; He won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for playing Chuck Baxter in the musical &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; (1968–1972). He was Tony-nominated for portraying Sky Masterson in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1965) and Billy Flynn in the original &quot;Chicago&quot; (1976). He also acted in &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; (1966) and &quot;42nd Street&quot; (1980). 

He gained worldwide fame for starring as NYPD Detective Lennie Briscoe on the NBC legal drama &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; from 1992 to 2004. For the role he earned the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series as well as a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. He reprised the role across several series including &quot;&quot; (1996–1999), &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (1999–2000), &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; (2001), and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury&quot; (2005). He also played private detective Harry McGraw in the CBS murder-mystery series &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; (1985–1991), and &quot;The Law &amp; Harry McGraw&quot; (1987–1988).

On film, Orbach often took numerous supporting roles such as a detective in the crime drama &quot;Prince of the City&quot; (1981), a coach in the comedy film &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot; (1985), an overly protective father in romance film &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; (1987), and a mobster in the drama &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; (1989). He voiced Lumiere the Candlestick in the Walt Disney animated musical film &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991).

==Early life==
Orbach was born on October 20, 1935, in the Bronx, the only child of Emily Orbach (née Olexy), a greeting card manufacturer and radio singer, and Leon Orbach, a restaurant manager and vaudeville performer. His father was a Jewish immigrant from Hamburg, Germany. Orbach said his father was descended from Sephardic Jewish refugees from the Spanish Inquisition. His mother, a native of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, was a Roman Catholic of Polish-Lithuanian descent, and Orbach was raised in her faith (a religious background later replicated in his character on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;). The Orbach family moved frequently during his childhood, living in Mount Vernon, New York; Wilkes-Barre, Nanticoke, and Scranton, Pennsylvania; Springfield, Massachusetts; and Waukegan, Illinois. Orbach attended Waukegan High School and graduated in 1952 (having skipped two grades in elementary school due to his high IQ of 163). He played on the football team and began learning acting in a speech class.

The summer after graduating from high school, Orbach worked at the theatre of Chevy Chase Country Club of Wheeling, Illinois, and enrolled at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the fall. In 1953, Orbach returned to the Chicago area and enrolled at Northwestern University. Orbach left Northwestern before his senior year and moved to New York City in 1955 to pursue acting and to study at the Actors Studio, where one of his instructors was the studio&#x27;s founder, Lee Strasberg.

==Career==
=== 1960–1979: Broadway debut and theatre roles ===

Orbach became an accomplished Broadway and off-Broadway actor. His first major role was El Gallo in the original 1960 cast of the decades-running hit &quot;The Fantasticks,&quot; and Orbach became the first to perform the show&#x27;s signature song and pop standard &quot;Try To Remember&quot;. He also starred in &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;; &quot;Carnival!&quot;, the musical version of the movie &quot;Lili&quot; (his Broadway debut); in revivals of &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; and &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (as Sky Masterson, receiving a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Musical); &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; (as Chuck Baxter, winning a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical); the original productions of &quot;Chicago&quot; (as Billy Flynn, receiving another Tony Award nomination); &quot;42nd Street&quot;; and a revival of &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;. Orbach made occasional film and TV appearances into the 1970s and appeared as a celebrity panelist on both &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and &quot;Super Password&quot;.

=== 1980–1991: Film roles and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; ===
In the 1980s, Orbach shifted to film and TV work full-time. Prominent roles included tough, corrupt NYPD narcotics detective Gus Levy in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s &quot;Prince of the City&quot;; he was the 1981 runner-up for the NSFC Best Supporting Actor award. He also portrayed gangsters in both the action-thriller &quot;F/X&quot; and the Woody Allen drama &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; (the latter of which also featured his future &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; co-star Sam Waterston). In 1985, Orbach became a regular guest star on &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; as private detective Harry McGraw, which led to him starring in the short-lived spin-off series &quot;The Law &amp; Harry McGraw&quot;. In 1987, he was featured in the hit film &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; as Dr. Jake Houseman, the father of Jennifer Grey&#x27;s character &quot;Baby&quot;. He made further TV appearances on popular shows such as &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; (for which he received his first Emmy nomination), and &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;.

In 1991, Orbach starred in Steven Seagal&#x27;s action film &quot;Out for Justice&quot; as police captain Ronnie Donziger, and starred in Disney&#x27;s Oscar-winning animated musical &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; as the voice (both singing and speaking) of the French-accented candelabrum Lumière, which he played &quot;halfway between Maurice Chevalier and Pepé Le Pew&quot;. At the 64th Academy Awards, Orbach performed a live-action stage rendition of the Oscar-nominated song, &quot;Be Our Guest&quot;, that he sang in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. He later reprised his voice role of Lumière for the film&#x27;s direct-to-video sequels, multiple episodes of &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, and the previously-deleted song (&quot;Human Again&quot;) that was added to the &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; 2002 IMAX re-release.

=== 1992–2004: &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and stardom ===
In 1992, Orbach joined the main cast of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; during its third season as the world-weary, wisecracking NYPD homicide detective Lennie Briscoe. He had previously guest-starred as a defense attorney on the series, and was subsequently cast as the new &quot;senior detective&quot; following Paul Sorvino&#x27;s departure. Orbach&#x27;s portrayal of Briscoe was based on his similar role from &quot;Prince of the City&quot; years before, which &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; creator Dick Wolf had personally suggested to him at the time of his casting. Orbach starred on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; for seasons, ultimately becoming the third longest-serving main cast member (behind S. Epatha Merkerson and Sam Waterston) in the show&#x27;s 20-year-run history, as well as one of its most popular. During Orbach&#x27;s tenure on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, the series won the 1997 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series among other accolades, made multiple crossover episodes with fellow NBC series &quot;&quot;, and spawned a franchise that included the TV film &quot;&quot;, the spin-off series &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; (both of which featured Orbach in guest appearances), and three video games. Orbach himself was nominated for a 2000 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (losing to James Gandolfini for &quot;The Sopranos&quot;). &quot;TV Guide&quot; named Lennie Briscoe one of their top-25 greatest television detectives of all time.

Also during his time on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, Orbach provided the voice of the main antagonist Sa&#x27;luk in the 1996 direct-to-video film &quot;Aladdin and the King of Thieves&quot;, and co-starred with Al Pacino in the independent film &quot;Chinese Coffee&quot;, which was filmed in the summer of 1997 and released three years later.

==Personal life==
=== Marriages and family ===
Orbach was married in 1958 to Marta Curro, with whom he had two sons, Anthony Nicholas and Christopher Benjamin. They divorced in 1975. Elder son Tony is a construction manager and an accomplished crossword puzzle constructor who has published more than 25 puzzles in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Younger son Chris Orbach is an actor and a singer; he played Lennie Briscoe&#x27;s nephew Ken Briscoe during the first season of &quot;Special Victims Unit&quot;.

In 1979, Jerry Orbach married Broadway dancer Elaine Cancilla, whom he met while starring in &quot;Chicago&quot;.

Orbach lived in a high-rise on 53rd Street off Eighth Avenue in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen and was a fixture in that neighborhood&#x27;s restaurants and shops. His glossy publicity photo hangs in Ms. Buffy&#x27;s French Cleaners, and he was a regular at some of the Italian restaurants nearby. As of 2007, the intersection of 8th Avenue and 53rd Street was renamed in honor of Orbach. The plans met with some resistance by local planning boards but were overcome thanks to his popularity and his love of the Big Apple.

===Illness and death===
In January 1994, less than two years into his stint on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, Orbach was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He was treated with radiation therapy, but by December 1994, the cancer had returned and metastasized. At that point, he went on hormone therapy, on which he remained over the next decade while he continued to star on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. After he left the series at the end of the 2003–04 season, Orbach underwent chemotherapy, but he ultimately succumbed to the cancer on December 28, 2004, at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York at age 69. Orbach&#x27;s decade-long illness was not revealed to the general public until just weeks before he died. Orbach was signed to continue in the role of Lennie Briscoe on the new spin-off &quot;Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury&quot;, which gave him a lighter schedule than the original series, but he was only featured in the first two episodes, both of which aired after his death.

The day after Orbach&#x27;s death, the marquees on Broadway were dimmed in mourning, one of the highest honors of the American theatre world, while NBC re-aired the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; episode &quot;C.O.D.&quot; (the last episode of the original series to feature Orbach) in honor of him. The &quot;Criminal Intent&quot; episode &quot;View from Up Here&quot; and the &quot;Trial by Jury&quot; episode &quot;Baby Boom&quot; were dedicated to Orbach, and the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; episode &quot;Mammon&quot; featured a pictorial memorial of him.

In addition to his sons, wife, and former wife, Orbach was survived by his mother and two grandchildren, Peter and Sarah Kate Orbach, children of his older son Tony. His mother died on July 28, 2012, at the age of 101. His wife Elaine died in 2009 at age 69, and his former wife Marta died in 2012 at age 79. Having had perfect 20/20 vision his whole life, Jerry Orbach requested that his eyes be donated after his death. His wish was granted when two people – one who needed correction for a nearsighted eye and another who needed correction for a farsighted eye – received Orbach&#x27;s corneas. His likeness has been used in an ad campaign for Eye Bank for Sight Restoration in Manhattan. Orbach was interred at Trinity Church Cemetery and Mausoleum in upper Manhattan.

==Honors and legacy==

In addition to his Tony Award and nominations, Jerry Orbach is also a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame, having been inducted in 1999. In 2002, Orbach was named a &quot;Living Landmark&quot; by the New York Landmarks Conservancy, along with his &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; co-star Sam Waterston. Orbach quipped that the honor meant &quot;that they can&#x27;t tear me down.&quot;

On February 5, 2005, he was posthumously awarded a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series for his longtime role on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. His wife Elaine accepted the award on his behalf.

In 2007, the Jerry Orbach Theatre was named for him in the Snapple Theater Center at 50th Street and Broadway in New York City. At the time, the theater was mounting a revival of &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;. On September 18, 2007, a portion of New York City&#x27;s 53rd Street near Eighth Avenue was renamed &quot;Jerry Orbach Way&quot; in his honor. After &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; was cancelled in 2010, executive producer René Balcer told &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;: &quot;I always think about the show as before Jerry and after Jerry...You saw the weariness of 25 years of crime-fighting in New York written on his face.&quot;

Author Kurt Vonnegut, a fan of Orbach, said during an Australian radio interview in 2005, &quot;People have asked me, you know, &#x27;Who would you rather be, than yourself?&#x27;&quot; and he replied &quot;Jerry Orbach, without a question...I talked to him one time, and he&#x27;s adorable.&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; writers Ben Brantley and Richard Severo analyzed the breadth and scope of Orbach&#x27;s career, and &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; co-star Patrick Swayze memorialized Orbach after his death.

<text>William Cranch Bond (September 9, 1789 – January 29, 1859) was an American astronomer, and the first director of Harvard College Observatory.

== Upbringing ==
William Cranch Bond was born in Falmouth, Maine (north of Portland) on September 9, 1789. When he was young, his father, William Bond, established himself as a clockmaker after a failed business venture; trained by his father and aided by his penchant for engineering, W. C. Bond built his first clock when he was fifteen years old. He eventually took over his father’s business, becoming an expert clockmaker himself. The William Bond clock shop remained in existence at 9 Park Street in Boston until the 1970s..

== Amateur astronomer ==

When he was seventeen years old, Bond saw the solar eclipse of June 16, 1806. Soon thereafter, he became an avid amateur astronomer. When he built his first house, Bond made its parlor an observatory, complete with an opening in the ceiling out of which his telescope could view the sky.

== Trip to Europe ==
In 1815, Bond traveled to Europe, commissioned by Harvard University to gather information on European observatories. On July 18, 1819, at Kingsbridge in Devon, England, Bond married his first cousin, Selina Cranch, who bore him four sons and two daughters. After Selina&#x27;s death in 1831, Bond married her older sister, Mary Roope Cranch. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1832.

== Harvard Observatory ==
In 1839, Bond was allowed to move his personal astronomical equipment to Harvard and serve as its (unpaid) &quot;Astronomical Observer to the University.&quot; Later, in 1843, a Sun-grazing comet aroused enough public interest in astronomy that Harvard was able to raise $25,730 towards the construction of a state-of-the-art observatory. Bond designed the building and the observing chair (both of which are still in working order today), and Harvard bought a fifteen-inch German-built refracting telescope, equal in size to the largest in the world at the time. The telescope was first put to use on June 24, 1847, when it was pointed at the Moon.

In 1852, Bond was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

== Discoveries ==
* Independently discovered the Great Comet of 1811
* Bond and his son George Phillips Bond discovered Saturn&#x27;s moon Hyperion; it was independently co-discovered at the same time by William Lassell in Britain, and both are given credit.
* Father and son were the first to observe the then innermost ring of Saturn, termed the Crepe ring, when they pointed Harvard’s telescope towards Saturn in 1850.
* Working with John Adams Whipple, the Bonds pioneered astrophotography, taking the first daguerreotype image of a star (Vega, in 1850) ever taken from America. In all, the three took between 200 and 300 photos of celestial objects.

== Legacy ==
A number of celestial objects have been named in Bond&#x27;s honor. A few of them include:
* The crater W. Bond on the Moon is named after him.
* A region on Hyperion is called the &quot;Bond-Lassell Dorsum&quot;
* Asteroid (767) Bondia is jointly named after him and his son.
* The Bond Gap within Saturn&#x27;s C Ring is jointly named after him and his son.

<text>Joel Feinberg (October 19, 1926 – March 29, 2004) was an American political and legal philosopher. He is known for his work in the fields of ethics, action theory, philosophy of law, and political philosophy as well as individual rights and the authority of the state. Feinberg was one of the most influential figures in American jurisprudence of the last fifty years.

==Education and career==

Feinberg studied at the University of Michigan, writing his dissertation on the philosophy of the Harvard professor Ralph Barton Perry under the supervision of Charles Stevenson. He taught at Brown University, Princeton University, UCLA and Rockefeller University, and, from 1977, at the University of Arizona, where he retired in 1994 as Regents Professor of Philosophy and Law.

Feinberg was internationally distinguished for his research in moral, social and legal philosophy. His major four-volume work, &quot;The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law&quot;, was published between 1984 and 1988. Feinberg held many major fellowships during his career and lectured by invitation at universities around the world. He was an esteemed and highly successful teacher, and many of his students are now prominent scholars and professors at universities across the US. His former students include Jules Coleman, Russ Shafer-Landau, and Clark Wolf.

==Philosophical work==

===&quot;The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law&quot;===

Feinberg&#x27;s most important contribution to legal philosophy is his four-volume book, &quot;The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law&quot; (1984-1988), a work that is frequently characterized as &quot;magisterial.&quot; Feinberg&#x27;s goal in the book is to answer the question: What sorts of conduct may the state rightly make criminal? John Stuart Mill, in &quot;On Liberty&quot; (1859), gives a staunchly liberal answer, that the only kind of conduct that the state may rightly criminalize is conduct that causes harm to others. Though Feinberg, who had read and re-read Mill&#x27;s classic text many times, shared Mill&#x27;s liberal leanings, he postulated that liberals can and should admit that certain kinds of non-harmful but profoundly offensive conduct can also properly be prohibited by law. In &quot;The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law&quot;, Feinberg sought to develop and defend a broadly Millian view of the limits of state power over the individual. In the process, he defended standard liberal positions on topics such as suicide, obscenity, pornography, hate speech, and euthanasia. He also analyzed nonmaterial concepts such as harm, offense, wrong, autonomy, responsibility, paternalism, coercion, and exploitation, conceding in the conclusion to the final volume that liberalism may not be fully defensible and that liberals ought to concede that there are rare cases where certain kinds of moral harms and harmless immoralities should be outlawed.

====A ride on the bus====

In &quot;Offense to Others&quot;, the second volume of &quot;The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law&quot;, Feinberg offers one of the most famous thought-experiments in recent philosophy: a series of imaginary scenarios he calls &quot;a ride on the bus.&quot; Feinberg invites us to imagine a bus ride in which you, a passenger rushing to an important appointment, are confronted by a series of deeply offensive but harmless acts. Some of the acts involve affronts to the senses (e.g., a man scratching his fingernails across a slate). Others involve acts that are deeply disgusting or revolting (e.g., eating various kinds of nauseatingly repulsive things). Still others involve affronts to our religious, moral, or patriotic sensibilities (e.g., overt acts of flag desecration); shocks to our sense of shame or embarrassment (such as acts of public sex); and a wide range of offensive conduct based on fear, anger, humiliation, boredom or frustration. The thought experiment is designed to test the limits of our tolerance for harmless but deeply offensive forms of behavior. More precisely, it raises the question &quot;whether there are any human experiences that are harmless in themselves yet so unpleasant that we can rightly demand legal protection from them even at the cost of other persons&#x27; liberties.&quot; Feinberg argues that even left-leaning, highly tolerant liberals must recognize that some forms of harmless but profoundly offensive conduct can properly be criminalized.

===&quot;Psychological Egoism&quot;===
In a paper prepared in 1958 for the benefit of students at Brown, Feinberg seeks to refute the philosophical theory of psychological egoism, which in his opinion is fallacious. So far as he can tell, there are four primary arguments for it:

#&quot;Every action of mine is prompted by motives or desires or impulses which are &quot;my&quot; motives and not somebody else&#x27;s.&quot;
#&quot;[W]hen a person gets what he wants, he characteristically feels pleasure.&quot;
#&quot;Often we deceive ourselves into thinking that we desire something fine or noble when what we really want is to be thought well of by others or to be able to congratulate ourselves, or to be able to enjoy the pleasures of a good conscience [...]. Indeed, it is a simple matter to explain away all allegedly unselfish motives [...]&quot; He quotes Lucius F. C. Garvin to this effect: &quot;Once the conviction that selfishness is universal finds root in a person&#x27;s mind, it is very likely to burgeon out in a thousand corroborating generalizations. It will be discovered that a friendly smile is really only an attempt to win an approving nod from a more or less gullible recording angel; that a charitable deed is, for its performer, only an opportunity to congratulate himself on the good fortune or the cleverness that enables him to be charitable; that a public benefaction is just plain good business advertising. It will emerge that gods are worshipped only because they indulge men&#x27;s selfish fears, or tastes, or hopes; that the &quot;golden rule&quot; is no more than an eminently sound success formula; that social and political codes are created and subscribed to only because they serve to restrain other men&#x27;s egoism as much as one&#x27;s own, morality being only a special sort of &quot;racket&quot; or intrigue using weapons of persuasion in place of bombs and machine guns. Under this interpretation of human nature, the categories of commercialism replace those of disinterested service and the spirit of the horse trader broods over the face of the earth.&quot;
#&quot;Psychological egoists often notice that moral education and the inculcation of manners usually utilise what Bentham calls the &#x27;sanctions of pleasure and pain.&#x27; Children are made to acquire the civilising virtues only by the method of enticing rewards and painful punishments. Much the same is true of the history of the race. People in general have been inclined to behave well only when it is made plain to them that there is &#x27;something in it for them.&#x27; Is it not then highly probable that just such a mechanism of human motivation as Bentham describes must be presupposed by our methods of moral education?&quot;

Feinberg observes that such arguments for psychological egoism are rarely mounted on the basis of empirical proof when, being psychological, they very well ought to. The opening argument he dubs a tautology from which &quot;nothing whatever concerning the nature of my motives or the objective of my desires can possibly follow [...]. It is not the genesis of an action or the &quot;origin&quot; of its motives which makes it a &#x27;selfish&#x27; one, but rather the &#x27;purpose&#x27; of the act or the &quot;objective&quot; of its motives; &quot;not where the motive comes from&quot; (in voluntary actions it always comes from the agent) but &quot;what it aims at&quot; determines whether or not it is selfish.&quot;

Similarly flawed in Feinberg&#x27;s opinion is the second argument. Just because all successful endeavour engenders pleasure does not necessarily entail that pleasure is the sole objective of all endeavour. He uses William James&#x27;s analogy to illustrate this fallacy: although an ocean liner always consumes coal on its trans-Atlantic voyages, it is unlikely that the sole purpose of these voyages is coal consumption.

The third argument, unlike the first two, contains no &quot;non sequitur&quot; that Feinberg can see. He nevertheless adjudges that such a sweeping generalisation is unlikely to be true.

In the final argument, Feinberg sees a paradox. The only way to achieve happiness, he believes, is to forget about it, but psychological egoists hold that all human endeavour, even that which achieves happiness, is geared towards happiness. Feinberg poses a thought experiment in which a character named Jones is apathetic about all but the pursuit of his own happiness. Because he has no means to achieve that end, however, &quot;[i]t takes little imagination [...] to see that Jones&#x27;s one desire is bound to be frustrated.&quot; To pursue only happiness, then, is to fail utterly to achieve it.

===&quot;The Rights of Animals and Future Generations&quot;===
In a 1974 paper, Feinberg addresses the possibility of legal rights for animals and future generations.

He begins by analyzing rights as &quot;claims &quot;to&quot; something and &quot;against&quot; someone&quot; which are recognized by legal rules. For instance, a worker&#x27;s legal right to a living wage is a claim &quot;to&quot; some amount of money and &quot;against&quot; an employer. Having clarified the nature of rights, Feinberg seeks to answer the question: What sort of entities can bear rights?

Feinberg adopts an interest theory of rights, according to which a right can be had by any entity with interests. In formulaic terms, some entity S &quot;can&quot; have some right R if and only if R protects some interest of S&#x27;s. Interests here are defined as products of mental states such as desires, beliefs, wants, plans, urges, and so on.

On this account, contrary to other theorists who adopt a will theory of rights, animals can be legitimately given rights. The question, then, is whether they ought to be given rights. In other words, given that some entity S &quot;can&quot; have some right R, is it the case that the interests which R functions to protect morally ought to be protected? Feinberg argues that our commonsense moral duties concerning animals are really duties &quot;towards&quot; animals (i.e., they are duties for the sake of the animals, not for the sake of some indirect effects), and so justice demands that animal interests be protected by rights.

Feinberg spends the rest of the paper applying his interest theory to other entities, including plants, species, corporations, severely mentally disabled humans, dead humans, fetuses, and future generations. He argues that:

* Plants cannot have rights, since they cannot be properly said to have interests. One might think that claims such as &quot;Water is good for a plant&quot; and &quot;A plant needs sunshine&quot; imply the existence of plant interests, but Feinberg maintains that this (and other errors) are due to linguistic confusions. He analyzes the claims that &quot;X is good for A&quot; or that &quot;A needs X,&quot; highlighting an ambiguity between two possible meanings:
*# X helps A to achieve some goal, or to carry out some function (e.g., oil is good for a car, and a car needs oil, only in the sense that oil helps a car to perform as desired).
*# X benefits A, and an absence of X harms A (e.g., food is good for a dog, and a dog needs food).
* Feinberg maintains that only the second interpretation makes sense for our claims about plants, since morally relevant benefits and harms require mental states such as desires, plans, goals, dreams, and so on.
* Likewise, Feinberg denies the possibility of rights for species &quot;as such&quot; , since there is no entity called &quot;the species&quot; which has the mental states necessary for legitimate interests. This suggests that any laws affecting a species must be grounded in the interests of individual species members, in the interests of humans (who may have some aesthetic preference for the species), or in the interests of future generations (who may benefit from the preservation of the species).
* On the other hand, Feinberg claims that the notion of rights for corporations, countries, and other similar entities is entirely legitimate, since we can ground these in the interests of &quot;real people&quot; acting in their official capacities.
* Severely mentally disabled humans may or may not be legitimate right-holders, depending on the severity of their conditions. So long as they have the mental states necessary for the attribution of legitimate interests, then they may have rights.
* Dead humans may not have rights since they lack any mental capacities, and so &quot;a fortiori&quot; lack the mental capacities necessary for interests. Feinberg thus grounds any laws regulating our actions with respect to the dead (such as acts of defamation) in one of two places: (i) they may be grounded in the interests of the dead person&#x27;s surviving friends and family, or (ii) they may be grounded in the future-oriented interests that the now dead person possessed prior to death. Thus Feinberg maintains that interests may be temporally extended, and so one&#x27;s rights can still be operative even once one has deceased.
* Similarly, Feinberg argues that interests may be intertemporal in the reverse direction. That is, he maintains that beings who have not yet been born can have rights grounded in the interests they will come to hold in the future once they are born. Importantly, however, this constrains the possibility of fetus rights to rights concerning quality of life, ruling out a right to &quot;be born&quot;, since (i) rights can only be granted to a fetus on the basis of the interests they will come to hold in the future once they are born, and (ii) these interests only exist contingent on the fetus being born. Thus a right to be born would seek to secure the very thing which is required for the notion of rights to apply—a circularity.
* Finally, Feinberg addresses the possibility of rights for future generations. By parity with the case of fetuses, the possibility of intertemporal interests can ground the existence of rights for future generations even though they have not yet come into existence.

<text>Robert McClelland (August 1, 1807 – August 30, 1880) was an American statesman, serving as U.S. Representative from Michigan, the ninth governor of Michigan, and United States Secretary of the Interior.

==Early life in Pennsylvania==
He was born in Greencastle, Pennsylvania, the son of a prominent Franklin County doctor. He entered Dickinson College at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and graduated among the top of his class in 1829. He studied law and was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in 1831 and practiced law in Pittsburgh for a short time before moving in 1833 to Monroe in what was then the Territory of Michigan.

==Life and politics in Michigan==
McClelland became a member of the Michigan bar and established a successful law practice in Monroe, and he was a member of the constitutional convention in 1835. After Michigan became a state, Governor Stevens T. Mason offered the positions of state Bank Commissioner and state Attorney General, both of which he declined in order to develop his private practice, although he maintained an active role in the new state&#x27;s Democratic Party. In 1836, McClelland married Sarah Elizabeth Sabine, with whom he had six children.

McClelland served on the board of regents of the University of Michigan in 1837 and again in 1850. He represented Monroe County in the Michigan House of Representatives in 1838, 1840 and was speaker of the house in 1843. He served as the mayor of Monroe in 1841. He was elected in 1842 as U.S. Representative from Michigan&#x27;s 1st congressional district, serving from 1843 to 1849 in the 28th, 29th, and 30th congresses. Going against the general opinion of the Democratic Party, he was a strong advocate of the Wilmot Proviso, which would have restricted the spread of slavery to new states. He was active in supporting his friend Lewis Cass&#x27;s unsuccessful run for president in 1848 and did not seek reelection in that year.

McClelland played a prominent role in the Michigan&#x27;s constitutional convention of 1850. Due to changes adopted in that constitution, he was elected to a one-year term as Governor of Michigan in 1851. He was re-elected to a full two-year term in 1852. During his tenure, he softened his support of the Wilmot Proviso and instead urged support for the Compromise of 1850. He played a prominent role at the national Democratic convention of 1852. He resigned as governor in March 1853 to become the Secretary of the Interior under Franklin Pierce, and was succeeded by his second Lieutenant Governor Andrew Parsons.

==Retirement and death==
Following the inauguration of James Buchanan in 1857, McClelland retired from public office and began a private law practice in Detroit. In 1867, he briefly returned to public service as a member of the Michigan constitutional convention.

McClelland died in Detroit at the age of 73, and is interred at Elmwood Cemetery.

His former residence at 47 East Elm Avenue in Monroe, Michigan, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 as the Governor Robert McClelland House, and is today privately owned.

<text>The Okanagan ( ), also called the Okanagan Valley and sometimes the Okanagan Country, is a region in the Canadian province of British Columbia defined by the basin of Okanagan Lake and the Canadian portion of the Okanagan River. It is part of the Okanagan Country, extending into the United States as Okanogan County in north-central Washington. According to the 2016 Canadian census, the region&#x27;s population is 362,258. The largest populated cities are Kelowna, Penticton, Vernon, and West Kelowna.

The region is known for its sunny climate, dry landscapes and lakeshore communities and particular lifestyle. The economy is retirement and commercial-recreation based, with outdoor activities such as boating and watersports, skiing and hiking. Agriculture has been focused primarily on fruit orchards, with a recent shift in focus to vineyards and wine.

The region stretches northwards via the Spallumcheen Valley to Sicamous in the Shuswap Country, and reaches south of the Canada–United States border, where it continues as Okanogan County. The Okanagan as a region is sometimes described as including the Boundary, Similkameen, and Shuswap regions, though this is because of proximity and historic and commercial ties with those areas.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from the Okanagan-language place name &quot;ukʷnaqín&quot;. An alternative explanation from Washington is ‘People living where you can see the top’, ostensibly of Chopaka Peak in the Lower Similkameen.

== Geography ==

The area was occupied by Pleistocene glaciation, and a widespread mantle of glacial drift covers the underlying bedrock.
At the end of the Pleistocene, marginal lakes formed along the sides of the melting ice lobe and streams deposited their loads in them as deltas and accumulations of silt.
These accumulations now form the white cliffs which are particularly prominent along the southern end of Okanagan Lake.

== Climate ==

The Okanagan has a mild, relatively dry climate that varies depending on latitude. Most of the Okanagan lies within the rain shadow of the Cascade Mountains to the southwest. Areas in the north end of the valley receive more precipitation and cooler temperatures than areas to the south. Generally, Kelowna is the transition zone between the drier south and the wetter north.

The Okanagan north of Kelowna has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;) with warm, sometimes hot summers and cold winters with highs around freezing, though mild by Canadian standards. Precipitation is well distributed year round. Some regions of the Okanagan, most notably near Kelowna, border on an inland oceanic climate due to it having an average temperature slightly above and below . Dry forests of ponderosa pine and low grasses dominate the valleys and mountains in this region.

The Okanagan south of Kelowna has a semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;Bsk&quot;) with hot, dry summers and cool winters. The average daytime temperature in this region is about , which is the warmest in Canada. The average annual precipitation in this region is also the second driest in Canada outside of the Arctic, the driest being the Thompson River Valley west of Kamloops. The southern Okanagan is dominated by northern reach of the Columbia Plateau ecoregion and is the only xeric shrubland ecosystem in Canada. Dry forests of ponderosa pine and low grasses can be found at higher elevations to the east. Despite being located in a xeric shrubland, areas near Osoyoos and Oliver claim to be part of Canada&#x27;s only desert.

Between 2000 BCE and 1900 CE, the climate and vegetation of the Okanagan had changed little. However, historical records from the Pacific Agrifood Research Station in Summerland indicate that the Okanagan climate had warmed by about 1 °C between 1908 and 1994.

== History ==
The Okanagan Valley is home to the Syilx, commonly known as the Okanagan people, an Interior Salish people who live in the valley from the head of Okanagan Lake downstream to near the river&#x27;s confluence with the Columbia River in present-day Washington, as well as in the neighbouring Similkameen Valley and the Upper Nicola to the north of that, though the whole of their traditional territory encompasses the entire Columbia River watershed and includes areas east of the Okanogan River in Washington, i.e. the Colville Reservation. At the height of Okanagan culture, about 3000 years ago, it is estimated that 12,000 people lived in this valley and surrounding areas. The Okanagan people employed an adaptive strategy, moving within traditional areas throughout the year to fish, hunt, or collect food, while in the winter months, they lived in semi-permanent villages of kekulis, a type of pithouse. Today the member bands of the Okanagan Nation Alliance are sovereign nations, with vibrant natural resource and tourism based economies. Their annual August gathering near Vernon is a celebration of the continuance of Syilx life and culture.

In 1811, the first non-natives came to the Okanagan Valley, in the form of a fur trading expedition voyaging north out of Fort Okanogan, a Pacific Fur Company outpost at the confluence of the Okanogan and Columbia Rivers. Within fifteen years, fur traders established, known as the Brigade Trail via the Cariboo Plateau and Thompson Country to Fort Kamloops and through the Okanagan, from Fort Alexandria at the southern end of the New Caledonia fur district in the Central Interior to the north, to Fort Vancouver, the HBC&#x27;s headquarters in the Columbia Department, for passing furs between New Caledonia and the Columbia River for shipment to the Pacific. The trade route lasted until 1846, when the Oregon Treaty laid down the border between British North America and the United States west of the Rocky Mountains on the 49th parallel. The new border cut across the valley, bisecting Osoyoos Lake. To avoid paying tariffs, British traders forged a newer route that bypassed Fort Okanogan via the Fraser Canyon from Spuzzum up over the Cascade Mountains, then via the Nicola, Coldwater and Fraser rivers to Fort Langley instead of to Fort Vancouver, which had come into being in American territory. The Okanagan Valley did not see many more outsiders for a decade afterward.
In 1859, the first European settlement was established when Father Charles Pandosy led the making of an Oblate mission at Okanagan Mission, now a neighbourhood of Kelowna. The Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858 eventually encouraged more settlement as some prospectors from the United States took the Okanagan Trail route on their way to the Fraser Canyon, although at the height of the rush the American adventurers who used the route did not settle because of outright hostilities from the Syilx, whom a few of the parties traversing the trail had harassed and brutalized. A few staked claims around the South Okanagan and Similkameen valleys and found gold and copper in places, with another trail from Fort Hope to newer goldfields at Rock Creek and Wild Horse Creek in the East Kootenay, skirting the US border and crossing Osoyoos Lake at Osoyoos, which was a customs post and also the location of the gold commissioner&#x27;s office. The Dewdney Trail, surveyed and built by Edgar Dewdney, was constructed to prevent trade in the region from going north-south instead of remaining firmly under British control, and also for military mobility purposes should the need arise. In the decades following the gold rushes, ranchers, mostly on military land grants, came to settle on Okanagan Lake; notable ones included the Coldstream Ranch near Vernon, the Ellis Ranch, which formed the basis of the City of Penticton once subdivided, and the Richter Ranch, which continues in operation today, in the mountains between the Town of Oliver and the Village of Keremeos in the Similkameen.

A mining industry began in the southern Okanagan region, with Fairview, now an empty benchland on the western side of Oliver, the best-known and largest of the boomtowns created in the later part of the 19th century. More farmers, as well as a small service industry, came to meet the needs of the miners.

Fruit production is a hallmark of the Okanagan Valley today, but the industry began with difficulty. Commercial orcharding of apples was first tried there in 1892, but a series of setbacks prevented the major success of commercial fruit crops until the 1920s. 
In 1936, the grower-owned BC Tree Fruits Cooperative was established to store, package and sell Okanagan fruit.
Until the 1930s, the demand for shipping fruit and other goods did drive a need for ongoing operations of the sternwheeler steamboats that serviced Okanagan Lake, operated by a subsidiary of the Canadian Pacific Railway, linking the Southern Mainline with the original transcontinental mainline at Sicamous: the SS &quot;Aberdeen&quot; from 1886 and then the SS &quot;Sicamous&quot; and SS &quot;Naramata&quot; from 1914, and others. The &quot;Sicamous&quot; and &quot;Naramata&quot; survive as a tourist attraction on Okanagan Beach on the north side of Penticton, the &quot;Sicamous&quot; serving both as a museum and also an event facility. Other steamboats operated on Skaha Lake to the south of that city. The club lounge and wheelhouse, without any keel or hull, of the SS &quot;Okanagan&quot; are in the same park as the &quot;Sicamous&quot; and &quot;Naramata&quot;.

While the last half-century has grown several resource-based enterprises in the region, primarily forestry, though mining had played an important role in earlier times. Favoured by its sunny climate, lakes, and winery attractions, the valley has become a popular destination for vacationers and retirees. The area also attracts seasonal fruit-picking labourers, primarily from Quebec and Mexico.

== Demographics ==

The population of the region was 403,950 as of the 2021 Canadian census. The three regional districts within the Okanagan and their populations were: Central Okanagan (222,162), North Okanagan (91,610) and Okanagan-Similkameen (90,178).

The statistical figures below are based on the 2011 Canadian census, 2021 Canadian census, and the British Columbia Ministry of Communities, Sport and Cultural Development.

===Indian reserves===
The Indian reserves of the Okanagan first peoples also form identifiable communities:
*Osoyoos Indian Band
*Penticton Indian Band
*Westbank First Nation (Kelowna)
*Okanagan Indian Band (Vernon)

The Osoyoos and Westbank Indian Reserves have large non-native populations because of band-governed residential and commercial development on their lands. The Osoyoos Indian Reserve leases large swathes of land to commercial vineyard developments and is where 40% of wine grapes used in the Okanagan come from.

===Ghost towns===
*Yankee Flats

==Sport==
Ice hockey is a popular sport in the region with WHL team Kelowna Rockets playing in the region&#x27;s most populated city. The Jr. A teams are the Vernon Vipers, West Kelowna Warriors and the Penticton Vees of the BCHL. Penticton were the 2012 national Jr. A champions, after they ousted the Woodstock Slammers for the title. Jr. B sides Kelowna Chiefs, Sicamous Eagles, Summerland Steam, Osoyoos Coyotes and North Okanagan Knights play in the KIJHL, Osoyoos having won the 2010/11 KIJHL season. Penticton and Summerland are both home to Chicago Blackhawks and Edmonton Oilers Defenceman Duncan Keith.

The area has been host to multiple junior hockey championships, including the Memorial Cup in Kelowna in 2004 and RBC Cup in Vernon in 1990 (then called the Centennial Cup) and 2014.

Kelowna is home to junior Canadian football team Okanagan Sun, and Jr. Baseball team Kelowna Falcons, including the UBC Okanagan Heat university program.

== Agriculture ==
The continued growth and operation of the agricultural industry in the Okanagan absolutely depends on the employment of temporary migrant workers.

In 2009, there were 3,000 Mexican migrant labourers working in the Okanagan.

<text>Line 4 Sheppard is the newest and shortest rapid transit line of the Toronto subway system, operated by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). It opened on November 22, 2002, and has five stations along of track, which is built without any open sections in the district of North York along Sheppard Avenue East between Yonge Street and Don Mills Road. All stations are wheelchair accessible and are decorated with unique public art. 

In the 2000s, the Sheppard East LRT was proposed to extend rapid transit along Sheppard Avenue. Despite approvals, the project did not proceed. In 2019, the Government of Ontario announced plans to extend the subway line east to Sheppard Avenue and McCowan Road in Scarborough to meet up with an extended Line 2 Bloor–Danforth.

==Name==

When the line opened in 2002, it was officially given the name &quot;Sheppard Subway&quot;. In October 2013, the TTC announced plans to give the lines official numbers to help riders and visitors navigate the system. The Sheppard line was renamed &quot;Line 4 Sheppard&quot; and new signage reflecting this began being gradually implemented in March 2014. The Toronto Rocket trains also use the numerical system for interchange station announcements, such as announcing &quot;Change for Line 1&quot; when the trains arrive at Sheppard–Yonge station.

== History ==

===Origins===
The TTC proposed the Sheppard line as part of the Network 2011 transportation plan, unveiled in 1985, which called for a line from Yonge Street to Victoria Park Avenue on the boundary between North York and Scarborough. The plan was approved by Metropolitan Toronto, but funding was delayed by the provincial government of David Peterson&#x27;s Liberal Party.

In 1993, the governing New Democratic Party (NDP) under Bob Rae proposed provincial funding for four subway/LRT projects for the TTC. Included in these four proposals were plans to build new subway lines along Eglinton and Sheppard Avenues and work was begun on both projects. The NDP was defeated in the 1995 provincial election and the Progressive Conservatives under Mike Harris were elected. Harris cancelled the Eglinton subway in York (though it would be later revived as Line 5 Eglinton, albeit as a light rail line with two long underground sections) but continued work on the Sheppard line.

Funding for the Sheppard line was initially rejected by city council. However, after a number of votes on different alterations to the project (including only building the subway line as far as Leslie Street), the proposal to build the Sheppard line tunnels only, without tracks, was passed by a narrow margin. After this vote passed city council, a re-vote was taken on the entire Sheppard line project to Don Mills, which then passed by a very narrow margin. James Bow, a Toronto transit reporter, documented that the political clout of North York mayor Mel Lastman (he was later elected mayor of the amalgamated City of Toronto in 1998) was crucial to the Sheppard line proposal being implemented. Councillor Joe Pantalone strongly supported the line, arguing it was a matter of civic equity and that the suburbs deserved good transit, which wouldin his opinionbring transit-oriented development to densify the suburbs. David L. Gunn, who was general manager of the TTC, opposed the Sheppard line, saying that it &quot;made no sense to build an expensive new subway when the existing system was strapped for cash to make basic repairs&quot; and &quot;if the city wanted to expand transit, it would be better to do it downtown, easing congestion in the busiest parts of the system&quot;.

===Completion and opening===

The Sheppard line was opened on November 22, 2002. It was the city&#x27;s first new subway line since the opening of the Bloor–Danforth line in 1966. It remained the newest subway infrastructure in Toronto for 15 years until the opening of the Toronto–York Spadina subway extension in 2017. It is shorter than had been planned, running from Yonge Street (at the former Sheppard station, renamed Sheppard–Yonge when the Sheppard line opened) east to Don Mills Road rather than further west to Downsview station (renamed Sheppard West in May 2017 to prevent confusion with Downsview Park station) and southeast to Scarborough Centre station. Downsview station had been built in 1996, ostensibly with the intention of being the western terminus of the Sheppard line before the line was truncated.

The Sheppard line cost just under C$1billion and took eight years to build. It is the first subway line in Canada that had plain tunnel sections built entirely by tunnel boring machine. The Sheppard line is the only subway line in Toronto that does not have any open sections. All stations on the line were constructed using the cut-and-cover method, with the expansion of Sheppard station having required an S-shaped diversion of Yonge Street during construction. Just east of Leslie station, there is an enclosed concrete bridge over the east branch of the Don River.

It was the first line to have accessible elevators at every station. The automated system to announce each station was installed in January 2006.

Its stations were built to accommodate the TTC&#x27;s standard subway trains of six cars, but part of each platform was blocked off since only four-car trains are needed to carry the amount of traffic on the line. The line was designed so that it can be extended at both ends, allowing for the construction of westward and eastward branches that had been planned. Likewise, the Sheppard line level of Sheppard–Yonge station was constructed with a roughed-in Spanish solution platform layout in anticipation of increased ridership, though in practice, the island platform is unused and only has advertising on the columns.

Platform screen doors were proposed for the Sheppard line. Installed at the edge of the platforms, platform screen doors would have aligned themselves with the subway-car doors when trains were in station for safety and suicide prevention. The proposed system was dropped because of its cost.

===Rolling stock===
From its opening in November 2002 to May 2016, the line was operated solely with four-car T1 subway trains, with two staff members operating the trains – one driver and one guard who operated the doors. On May 30, 2016, new four-car Toronto Rocket (TR) subway trains were introduced on this line. They replaced the older T1 subway trains, which were moved to Line 2 Bloor–Danforth. The TRs are based on Bombardier Transportation&#x27;s Movia-styled train sets and are the first TTC trains which have no separators between the cars. This allows passengers to walk freely from one end to the other, unlike Toronto&#x27;s previous subway cars. The change to TR trains was necessary because Line 4 trains are based in Davisville Yard, which is accessed via Line 1 Yonge–University. Line 1 was converted to operate using an automatic train control system, with the conversion finishing in September 2022. From October 9, 2016, Line 4 has been served entirely by four-car TR trains, which are operated by one staff member who both drives the train and operates the doors, similar to the model that was in use on the former Line 3 Scarborough.

===Residential development===

From its opening in 2002 to 2014, the Sheppard line spurred over $1billion of construction of new housing, including several high-rise condominium towers, along its route as transit-oriented developments. Since 2000, condominium towers have been built around all five stations on the line, with most of the new developments being centred around Bayview and Bessarion stations. The Daniels Corporation built a six-tower condominium development, called NY Towers, north of Highway 401 between Bayview and Bessarion stations; Arc Condominiums on the northeast corner of Bayview Avenue and Sheppard Avenue; and terraced condos just east of their NY Towers. Shane Baghai built a multi-tower development in the area.

In 2007, Leslie and Bessarion stations were the least-used stations in the system; in 2015, four of twenty planned buildings of Concord Adex Investments&#x27; condominium complex, Concord Park Place, located between these two stations, had been completed. The complex is developed on the site of a former Canadian Tire warehouse/distribution centre, though Canadian Tire retains a retail location there. There is also development around Swedish furniture chain IKEA and McDonald&#x27;s in the immediate area.

===Ridership===

From late 2002 to 2011, ridership on the Sheppard subway rose from about 10.7million riders annually to a peak of 15.9million. The following table shows the typical number of customer trips made on the Sheppard subway on an average weekday.

Note: 2017 figures, as well as figures between 2019 and 2021, are unavailable.

==Station art==
Line 4 features artwork in each station, such as the scenic mosaic mural at Sheppard–Yonge station, Bayview station&#x27;s trompe-l&#x27;œil and Leslie station&#x27;s individual wall tiles, each containing the words &quot;Sheppard &amp; Leslie&quot;.

==Initial criticism==

The line has been criticized as a &quot;subway to nowhere&quot;, a &quot;stubway&quot;, or a &quot;white elephant&quot;. In 2018, the total ridership on the Sheppard subway line was approximately 50,000 per average weekday, similar to a few of the TTC&#x27;s busiest streetcar and bus routes, though these routes are generally much longer than Sheppard&#x27;s length. The Sheppard line feeds passengers into the Yonge segment of Line 1 Yonge–University. During the City of Toronto&#x27;s 2008 budget crisis, the TTC considered shutting the line down on weekends or entirely. Similarly, as a result of financial pressures brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic in Toronto, Mayor John Tory announced in 2020 that the entire line would be shut down without financial support from upper levels of government, though funding was eventually secured to allow the line to remain open. 

Jarrett Walker, a transportation consultant and the author of the book &quot;Human Transit&quot;, says &quot;Sheppard&#x27;s technology makes it both expensive to abandon and expensive to extend; that&#x27;s the trap.&quot;

Councillor Josh Colle, who chaired the TTC from 2014 to 2018, said in May 2015 that, given the existing Sheppard subway&#x27;s performance, he could rationalize spending more money to expand it east from Don Mills or west from Sheppard–Yonge, but not both. He estimated that the Sheppard subway receives a subsidy of more than $10 per ride.

According to the &quot;Metro&quot; commuter newspaper, between the opening of the Sheppard line in November 2002 and December 2014, there was over $1billion in development along that corridor, much of it in the vicinity of Bayview, Bessarion and Don Mills stations. The area surrounding Don Mills station has a density suitable for a subway at . Despite this, a majority of commuters along the Sheppard subway drive to work rather than use public transit. In 2016, according to Royson James of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, residents in the area commuted to jobs throughout the Greater Toronto Area by automobile rather than taking public transit. James stated that subways are designed for corridors with four to eight times the ridership along Sheppard Avenue East.

==Future expansion==
Several informal proposals have been made to extend the line in both directions. The original proposal for the Sheppard line was for a major subway line running from Sheppard West station on the University portion of Line 1 to Scarborough Centre station on Line 3 Scarborough. Instead, funding was only approved for a truncated line with the possibility of several phased expansions. 

In the mid-2000s, under the Transit City plan, a Sheppard East LRT was proposed instead of an eastern subway extension. Despite various approvals, the construction of the line did not proceed as the construction of the Finch West LRT was deemed a priority. 

In 2019, the provincial government under Premier Doug Ford announced it supported an eastern extension of the line as a longer-term project. , a business case for the eastward and westward extensions was being undertaken by the provincial government. These projects were then unfunded, and a target date for completion had not been announced. In October 2023, Metrolinx sought public feedback regarding the potential extension by posting on its website. The mode of rapid transit, station count, and line length had not been determined. The agency explained that the feedback gathered would be used to guide the initial business case for the Sheppard extension.

On March 20, 2024, City of Toronto staff presented a report to city council on corridor evaluation results for the prioritization of planned higher-order transit projects, which yielded the following results for a subway extension: eastward from Don Mills station to McCowan Road (interchange with the Scarborough subway extension) and westward from Sheppard–Yonge station to Sheppard West station (second lowest priority).

===Eastward extension===
The TTC considered the eastward extension of the Sheppard line to Scarborough Centre station as one of its top priorities for rapid-transit expansion, which would have expanded rapid transit in Scarborough for the first time since the completion of Line 3 Scarborough. In 2015, the TTC estimated that a Sheppard subway to Scarborough Centre would have 7,800 riders per hour while 10,000 per hour was the minimum number of riders per hour considered appropriate for a subway. The maximum capacity of the subway option was about 30,000 riders per hour, approximately the load the Yonge portion of Line 1 carried in the morning rush.

In April 2019, the provincial government under Premier Doug Ford announced that it supported an eastward extension of Line 4 but included no promise of funding nor a proposed target date for completion. The province revised the proposed route to terminate and meet a then-proposed Scarborough Subway Extension of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth at Sheppard Avenue East and McCowan Road instead of at Scarborough Centre. The announcement noted that construction of the line would not begin until the 2030s, following the completion of the Scarborough Subway Extension. 

In November 2023, Metrolinx announced preparation of an initial business case for Line 4 extensions as previously supported in April 2019, and that it was also considering a further extension of Line 4 east of McCowan Road to Meadowvale Road as part of the study limits. In June 2024, Metrolinx held several public consultations with routing concepts.

===Westward extension===

A separate westward extension was proposed to Sheppard West station on Line 1. Lower population density made this expansion a much lower priority than the eastward one, as the minimal increase in ridership was insufficient to justify the costs. The approval of the Spadina subway extension to the Vaughan Metropolitan Centre in York Region renewed interest in this phase, as a subway connection between Sheppard West and Sheppard–Yonge stations would significantly lower commuting times for York University students, as well as commuters travelling to and from Vaughan Metropolitan Centre. The tunnel from Sheppard–Yonge station to Welbeck Road (one block east of Senlac Road) was built for train storage at the time of original construction. In December 2009, a westward extension was again considered by the TTC to link the line to the Wilson subway yard. It was immediately dismissed due to cost. In December 2013, this extension was listed as being under consideration as an &quot;unfunded future rapid transit project&quot; in the City of Toronto&#x27;s &quot;Feeling Congested?&quot; report. , the westward extension had neither provincial government support nor funding.

At its February 20, 2020, meeting, the Metrolinx board of directors endorsed a prioritization framework for a proposed frequent rapid transit network that was inclusive of a proposed subway extension from Sheppard–Yonge station to Sheppard West station; with a forecast ridership of 9,800 per hour in 2031 and a proposed line length of along Sheppard Avenue West, the project scored &quot;medium&quot; with a preliminary benefit-cost ratio of 0.26 to 0.35.

In November 2023, Metrolinx announced preparation of an initial business case for Line 4 extensions, and that Metrolinx was also considering a westward extension of Line 4 to Sheppard West Station. In June 2024, Metrolinx held several public consultations with routing concepts.

===Political debates and proposals===
Since 2007, there have been a series of political debates and proposals about whether to extend Line 4 east or west, or whether Line 4 should be continued eastwards as a separate light-rail line or as a heavy-rail extension of Line 4. Major political decisions were made only to be later reversed by succeeding governments. The following sections detail the major proposals.

====Transit City====

In March 2007, the City of Toronto, under the mayoralty of David Miller, and the TTC released the Transit City proposal to begin a new round of transit expansion using light rail technology on dedicated rights-of-way instead of subway technology. Under this plan, the Sheppard East subway extension had been replaced by a light rail line running from Don Mills Station along Sheppard Avenue East to Meadowvale Road, where it would have met the northern terminus of an extended Line 3 Scarborough. Under this proposal, there would be no direct connection between North York City Centre and Scarborough City Centre.

====Rob Ford era====
As a result of the election of Rob Ford as mayor of Toronto in 2010, the western extension of the Sheppard subway to Sheppard West Station and the eastern extension to Scarborough Centre were considered a priority again. He indicated in a December 2010 interview with &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that all other transit projects would come second to completing the Sheppard line, stating &quot;I&#x27;m just focusing on doing the Sheppard subway underground.&quot;

On March 31, 2011, Rob Ford announced that the proposed Sheppard East LRT line would be replaced by western and eastern extensions for the Sheppard line so that the completed line would run from Sheppard West station to Scarborough Centre. The Ontario government approved this plan, which was estimated to cost $4.2billion. The City of Toronto would assume complete financial responsibility for the project, which was proposed to be funded through a public–private partnership, as well as through the use of surplus funds from the proposed Eglinton Crosstown line (later renamed Line 5 Eglinton), if there were any. Massive redevelopment along the route would be needed to generate these funds, as the then-current population density and projected ridership was too low to support the cost of the expansion by itself.

In 2011, Metrolinx estimated that the westward extension to Sheppard West would be long, add two stations, and cost $1.48billion. The Sheppard East extension would be long, add seven stations, and cost $2.75billion.

Gordon Chong, head of the TTC agency tasked with analyzing the new subway plans at the time, said it was possible that no new transit development would occur along Sheppard Avenue.

====Stintz&#x27;s alternative====
On January 23, 2012, TTC chair Karen Stintz suggested a plan to extend the line two stops eastwards funded by making the eastern portion of Line 5 Eglinton at street level. This motion was defeated by the TTC board. She then got 24 councillors (a majority) to sign a petition calling for a special council meeting for February 8 of that year.

In the meeting, council voted to build the Eglinton project according to the original Transit City plan (partly underground and partly at grade), build an at-grade Finch West LRT, and to appoint a panel to recommend whether to pursue the eastward extension of the Sheppard subway or construct the Sheppard East LRT instead. The panel reported back to council on March 31, 2012. At this council meeting, council approved light rail rather than a subway extension for Sheppard. On April 26 of that year, the motion to build the LRT was announced by the Minister of Transportation after being approved unanimously by Metrolinx. The plan still needed to be approved by Ontario&#x27;s cabinet, though on June 29, 2012, the Board of Directors of Metrolinx unanimously approved the same motion approved by Metrolinx in April.

====Early Tory era====
During the 2014 Toronto mayoral election, incumbent mayor Rob Ford (and his brother Doug Ford, after the prior&#x27;s withdrawal) were the only major candidates who supported completing Line 4 Sheppard east to McCowan Road (phase-one project) and west to Sheppard West station (phase-two project). John Tory, who won the election, did not include anything on the Sheppard corridor in his maps; instead, he favoured SmartTrack, a proposal to enhance GO Transit rail service with the city of Toronto. However, he did say that he would proceed with the LRT, although the project would not be a priority for him.

On April 27, 2015, Steven Del Duca, the Ontario Minister of Transportation, said that the LRT project would not start until at least 2021. In July 2016, Toronto City Council approved a one-stop subway extension on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth to Scarborough Centre station. During this vote, city council also approved putting an extension of Line 4 into Scarborough back into consideration.

====Doug Ford era====
In April 2019, Doug Ford, who had since become premier of Ontario after the 2018 provincial election, unveiled a new transportation plan for Toronto, including the new Ontario Line to replace the proposed Relief Line, an extension of Line 1 to Richmond Hill, a northeastward extension of Line 2 with new stations to replace Line 3 Scarborough, a westward extension of Line 5 Eglinton to Toronto Pearson International Airport in Mississauga and an extension of Line 4 Sheppard east to McCowan Road, where it would intersect with the Line 2 extension about north of Scarborough Town Centre. However, money was not set aside in the government&#x27;s budget for the Line 4 extension. During the 2022 provincial election, Doug Ford campaigned for the eastward extension of Line 4 to Scarborough to intersect with the Line 2 extension, as well as for other subway extensions in Toronto. Following Ford&#x27;s re-election as premier of Ontario, the Ontario Fall Economic Statement in 2022 recommitted the government to the eastward extension by confirming planning work had continued for the Sheppard subway extension, which would extend Line 4 from its existing terminus at Don Mills station to McCowan Road. 

On June 8, 2023, Associate Minister of Transportation Stan Cho announced that he and Minister of Transportation Caroline Mulroney had given official direction to agency officials to prepare an initial business case to extend Line 4 eastwards to the terminus station of the Scarborough subway extension (located at McCowan Road and Sheppard Avenue East) and to explore the potential for extending the line westwards to Sheppard West station. In November 2023, Metrolinx held public consultations to receive feedback on potential extensions along Sheppard Avenue eastward from Don Mills station to McCowan Road, and westward from Sheppard–Yonge station to Sheppard West station. Metrolinx was also considering a further extension eastwards from McCowan Road to Meadowvale Road. Before this announcement, the City of Toronto was planning that its proposed Eglinton East LRT would serve Sheppard Avenue between McCowan Road and Morningside Avenue, overlapping a potential Metrolinx expansion of Line 4 east of McCowan Road. In case of an overlap, city planners would modify the Eglinton East LRT route. In June 2024, there was a public consultation regarding the Line 4 eastward extension in which the public selected their preferred alignment, with the extension to Scarborough Town Centre being the most popular among the options.

== Service frequency ==

The frequency for this line is 5 to 6 minutes at all times during scheduled hours.

On September 4, 2005, an overnight service on Sheppard Avenue East was introduced. The 385 Sheppard East Blue Night bus route provides late-night service when the subway is not in operation with the frequency of 30 minutes. This service terminates at Sheppard–Yonge station and follows Sheppard Avenue East to Meadowvale Road.

<text>Mount Ainslie is a hill with an elevation of that is located in the northeastern suburbs of Canberra, in the Australian Capital Territory, Australia. Mount Ainslie lies within part of the Canberra Nature Park.

== Cultural significance ==
According to the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people, Mount Ainslie is a sacred place primarily for women’s business. Mount Ainslie and adjacent Galambary (Black Mountain) are referred to as women’s breasts.

==Location and features==
Mount Ainslie borders on the inner suburbs of , and and is named in honour of James Ainslie, a 19th-century settler who was the overseer on &quot;&quot;, a large property in the area.

The Mount Ainslie tourist outlook, one of Canberra&#x27;s most popular, provides excellent views of central Canberra and to the south and Black Mountain to the west, especially towards sunset. According to an article written in 1922, this outlook &quot;will afford an ever changing bird&#x27;s eye and panoramic picture of the city&#x27;s buildings and beauty spots, as well as of the lovely plains that run to join the Yass Plains on the north.&quot; An air beacon located at the summit is part of the national capital&#x27;s air navigation system guiding air traffic towards the nearby Canberra Airport.

A walking trail which leads from the back of the Australian War Memorial, called the Mount Ainslie Kokoda summit trail, is well maintained with steps and is paved. The trail is used by around 200 people each day. It has a number of plaques commemorating the battles fought in World War II in the Kokoda Trail in Papua New Guinea, with the plaques set out as though it was on the Kokoda Trail. A quarry is located around from the peak.

Mount Ainslie is the northernmost point of a land axis, planned by Walter Burley Griffin, that stretches through North and South Canberra. This axis takes in the Australian War Memorial and the old and new Parliament Houses. In 1912, Burley won the international design competition for the capital and called the area an &quot;irregular amphitheatre&quot;. The design included his wife&#x27;s inputs, and thus the view from the summit of Mount Aisle was named as Marion Mahony Griffin in 2013.

==Summit design competition==
In 2016 the ACT Government and the National Capital Authority ran a design competition for, with the aim to produce a ten-year strategy for the Mount Ainslie summit. The competition winners were Sue Barnsley and Jane Irwin, who proposed new parking, signage, picnic areas, lawns and plantings.

<text>The Gotha G.I was a bomber aircraft used by the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; (Imperial German Air Service) during the First World War.

==Design and development==

In mid-1914, Oskar Ursinus, the founder and editor of the German flying magazine , began designing a large twin-engine seaplane of unconventional configuration. While most biplane designs have the fuselage attached to the lower wing, Ursinus had a snub-nosed fuselage attached to the upper wing, and twin engine nacelles mounted on the lower one. The purpose of this arrangement was to allow the engines to be kept close together thereby minimizing asymmetrical thrust in the event of an engine failure, although Ursinus later also claimed that this design balanced out the lowering of the centre of pressure as speed increased and minimised the drag on the upper wing caused by turbulence from the fuselage.
Ursinus was conscripted into the army on 1 August 1914 and little over a week later, presented his commanding officer, Major Helmut Friedel, with the seaplane design adapted into a (battle aircraft) intended for ground attack duties. Apart from the aerodynamic benefits claimed by Ursinus, the aircraft&#x27;s unorthodox layout provided excellent views for the three crewmen and broad fields of fire for the gunner. The design also matched the specifications that (, Inspectorate of Flying Troops) had issued in March that year for a &quot;Type III&quot; large military aircraft, and Friedel ordered the construction of a prototype.

This aircraft was built by the men in his unit, 3 (Aviator Replacement Unit 3) and received the serial number B.1092/14 (B: a two-seat unarmed biplane in the IdFlieg type system), although it was generally known as the FU for &quot;&quot;. It was powered by two Mercedes D.I engines, and in keeping with the &quot;Type III&quot; requirement, was armed with a machine gun in the nose. The engines and crew were protected by of chrome-nickel armor.

===Prototype===
The prototype first flew on 30 January 1915 and was inspected by Dr Heller, an engineer, on 20 February. His report confirmed that the aircraft conformed to the specification and Ursinus&#x27; claims about the excellent field of fire and advantages of the design in single-engine operation. He also noted that the aircraft was difficult to fly, lacking in structural integrity, dangerous to the crew in the event of a crash landing and underpowered. Despite its shortcomings, the FU was sent to the front, assigned to 28 (FFA 28) reconnaissance unit at Ujatz on the Russian Front in early 1915.

=== contract===

With the design proved under service conditions, issued a contract on 1 April for series production to , which acquired a license from Ursinus, who held the patent to the design. chief engineer Hans Burkhard simplified and refined the design, which was originally known as the (GUH, Gotha-Ursinus Army Aircraft) later known as the Gotha G.I or Gotha-Ursinus G.I. The first production aircraft was completed on 27 July 1915. These aircraft were powered by two Benz Bz.III engines. built eighteen G.I aircraft in three batches of six before production ceased at the end of the year. The final batch was powered by Mercedes D.III engines and featured an extra defensive machine gun and nearly double the armor of previous examples.

===Floatplane===
One Navy Number 120 (UWD, Ursinus Water Biplane) floatplane version of the G.I was also built, ordered by the Navy in April 1915 and delivered in February 1916; as per Ursinus&#x27; original intentions from two years earlier. During a test flight, six men climbed aboard to take the place of ballast. When they emerged after landing, a nearby naval officer likened the aircraft to the Trojan Horse () and this nickname stuck. It was used operationally until 2 October when it was written off after a hard landing at Zeebrugge.

==Operational history==

Today, little is known about the G.I&#x27;s service history. records show only small numbers ever in service, the most being five in October and six in December 1915. At this stage of the war, Type G aircraft were being used for defensive patrols, reconnaissance and only rarely for bombing. By the time it reached the front, the Gotha G.I was already an easy target for faster and more maneuverable fighters and the few pilot recollections that have survived are largely unfavourable to the type. Manfred von Richthofen served as a machine gunner in a Gotha G.I at Ostend and in Champagne-Ardenne during the First Battle of Champagne with Georg Zeumer as his pilot. The UWD seaplane is known to have participated in an air-raid on Dover on 19 March 1916, bombing Langton Fort and the Shoulder of Mutton battery.

==Variants==
* FU - (Friedel-Ursinus) - single prototype (B.1092/14)
* G.I - standard production version
* UWD - (&quot;Ursinus Wasser Doppeldecker&quot; - Ursinus Water Biplane) - seaplane variant with twin floats (1 only built), also known as the WD.4.

<text>The red-necked spurfowl or red-necked francolin (Pternistis afer), is a gamebird in the pheasant family Phasianidae that is a resident species in southern Africa.

==Taxonomy==
The red-necked spurfowl was described in 1776 by the German zoologist Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller and given the binomial name &quot;Tetrao afer&quot;. The type locality was later designated as Benguela in western Angola. The specific epithet &quot;afer&quot; is the Latin word for &quot;African&quot;. The species is now placed in the genus &quot;Pternistis&quot; that was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Georg Wagler in 1832. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2019 found that the red-necked spurfowl is sister to the grey-breasted spurfowl.

Although many subspecies have been described only four are now recognised:
* &quot;P. a. cranchii&quot; — north Gabon and south Congo Republic though south, east Democratic Republic of the Congo to central Angola and west Zambia to central Tanzania, west Kenya and Uganda
* &quot;P. a. afer&quot; — west Angola, northwest Namibia
* &quot;P. a. castaneiventer&quot; — south and east South Africa
* &quot;P. a. humboldtii&quot; — southeast Kenya and north and east Tanzania to Mozambique, northeast Zambia and east Zimbabwe

==Description==
The red-necked spurfowl is in length, with significant size differences between the subspecies. It is a generally dark spurfowl, brown above and black-streaked grey or white underparts. The bill, bare facial skin, neck and legs are bright red.

==Distribution and habitat==
The red-necked spurfowl breeds across the central belt of Africa and down the east coast to South Africa.
==Behaviour and ecology==
The red-necked spurfowl is a wary species, keeping to deep cover, although it sometimes feeds in open scrub or cultivation if disturbance is limited and there are thickets nearby. The nest is a bare scrape, and three to nine eggs are laid.

==Status==
Widespread and common throughout its large range, the red-necked spurfowl is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

<text>Biebrich is a borough of the city of Wiesbaden, Hesse, Germany. With over 38,000 inhabitants, it is the most-populated of Wiesbaden&#x27;s boroughs. It is located south of the city center on the Rhine River, opposite the Mainz borough of Mombach. Biebrich was an independent city until it was incorporated into Wiesbaden in 1926.

==History==
Numerous prehistoric and early-historical archeological finds indicate that the Biebrich area has been continuously inhabited since the Neolithic Age. In the Middle Ages, from the beginning of the reign of Charlemagne, the places &quot;Biburc&quot; (Biebrich) and &quot;Moskebach&quot; (Mosbach) were part of the Königssondergau Wiesbaden, held by the Frankish king as his personal property.

Biebrich was first mentioned in historical documents in 874. King Louis the German and his entourage boarded vessels at &quot;Villa Biburg&quot; on a trip from Frankfurt to Aachen.

Beginning of the 18th century, the princes (&quot;Fürsten&quot;) of Nassau built the Baroque Biebrich Palace (&quot;Schloss Biebrich&quot;). When this magnificent building was completed in 1744, the Prince of Nassau-Usingen relocated his residence from the far side of the Taunus to Biebrich. Until the completion of the City Palace in Wiesbaden in 1841, Biebrich was the principal residence of the Princes (and, after 1806, the Dukes) of Nassau.

In the 19th century, Biebrich became an important industrial center of the Rhine Main Area with the plants of Dyckerhoff Concrete (now owned by Buzzi Unicem), Kalle and Albert Chemistry (now Celanese), and Henkell (sparkling wine = Sekt). In the economical crisis of the post-World War I Era, the small town, struck hard by unemployment of the majority of his working-class residents, merged with the bigger and much wealthier nearby spa city of Wiesbaden.

In 1951, the 633rd AAA Gun Battalion, 90mm, 7th Army U.S. NATO Occupation Forces were stationed in Biebrich.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Biebrich is twinned with:
* Glarus, Switzerland

==Notable people==
*Seligman Baer (1825–1897), Biblical scholar and scholar of Jewish liturgy
*Wilhelm Dilthey (1833–1911) and Wilhelm Heinrich Riehl (1823–1897), pioneers of the early German cultural studies of the 19th century, grew up in Biebrich
*Sophia of Nassau (1836–1913), Queen consort of Sweden and Norway (1873–1907), wife of King Oscar II
*Wilhelm Ferdinand Kalle (1870–1954), chemist, industrialist and politician
*Ludwig Beck (1880–1944), general
*Toni Sender (1888–1964), socialist politician
*Walther Gerlach (1889–1979), physicist
*Jürgen Grabowski (1944–2022), footballer, grew up in Biebrich and was part of two its youth clubs (FV Biebrich 1902 und SV Biebrich 1919)
*In the years 1863-1866 was Béla Kéler the music director at the ducal court of Nassau in Wiesbaden
*In 1862, Richard Wagner lived for one year in a newly built country house (later called Villa Annika) near the castle at the bank of the river Rhine, working on the first act and the prelude of the third act of &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot;. Following the composer&#x27;s wishes, local wind instrument producer Wilhelm Heckel invented the so-called &quot;Heckelphone&quot; (a basso-oboe, used by Richard Strauss, Paul Hindemith, and others).

<doc id="584584" wikidata="Q367635" url="?curid=584584" title="Otto Struve">
<text>Otto Lyudvigovich Struve (; 12 August 1897 – 6 April 1963) was a Russian-American astronomer of Baltic German origin. Otto was the descendant of famous astronomers of the Struve family; he was the son of Ludwig Struve, grandson of Otto Wilhelm von Struve and great-grandson of Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve. He was also the nephew of Karl Hermann Struve.

With more than 900 journal articles and books, Struve was one of the most distinguished and prolific astronomers of the mid-20th century. He served as director of Yerkes, McDonald, Leuschner and National Radio Astronomy Observatories and is credited with raising worldwide prestige and building schools of talented scientists at Yerkes and McDonald observatories. In particular, he hired Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and Gerhard Herzberg who later became Nobel Prize winners. Struve&#x27;s research was mostly focused on binary and variable stars, stellar rotation and interstellar matter. He was one of the few eminent astronomers in the pre-Space Age era to publicly express a belief that extraterrestrial intelligence was abundant, and so was an early advocate of the search for extraterrestrial life.

==Early years in Russia==

Struve was born in 1897 in Kharkov, the largest city of Sloboda Ukraine, then Russian Empire (now Ukraine), as the first child of Ludwig Struve and Elizaveta Khristoforovna Struve (1874–1964). His father was a member of the extensive political and scientific Struve family of Baltic Germans who were prominent in 19th-century Russia. His astronomy experience started early: from the age of eight, he was accompanying father in the telescope tower and from 10 carried out some minor observations, despite his fear of the dark spaces. After having received home education, at the age of 12, Struve started attending a school in Kharkov and showed mathematical talents. Otto was the first child of the Struve family in Russia who attended a Russian-speaking rather than German-speaking school, and was bilingual in German and Russian. After graduating in 1914, he continued his astronomy work. In June 1914, Struve took part in preparations for observation of a total solar eclipse (August 21, 1914) and later used that experience and results for his master&#x27;s degree work defended in 1919 at Kharkov University.
Struve entered the Imperial Kharkov University in 1915, at the time of political unrest and wars in Russia. In the beginning of 1916, just having finished the first semester, he interrupted his studies and enlisted to a military artillery school in St. Petersburg. He passed an accelerated training program, and in February 1917, was sent to the Turkish front. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed, Struve returned to Kharkov for a year between spring 1918 and spring 1919 and completed a full university course. in June 1919, he received a certificate signed by the rector of Kharkov University stating that Struve would stay with the university to prepare for professorship at the department of astronomy and geodesics. During that time, Struve also worked at the &quot;workshop school of precision mechanics&quot; and obtained a license of a workshop trainer. The workshop was organized by his father with the goal of creating traditions of astronomy engineers in Russia. Those were non-existent and foreign engineers were personally invited from abroad for high-quality mechanical work.

==Moving to the United States==
The German origin of Struves and the military history of Otto Struve with the White Russian Army took its toll. To avoid repression by the Bolsheviks, his family had to move from Kharkov to Sevastopol which was still under control of the White Army. There, a series of tragedies took away most of the family: the youngest sister Elizabeth drowned, brother Werner died from tuberculosis, and his father died from a stroke on November 4, 1920. Whereas his mother and sister chose to return to Kharkov, on November 16–17, 1920, Otto followed the escaping Wrangel&#x27;s Army. With a military transport, he escaped from Sevastopol to Turkey. He never returned to Russia. He was later invited several times to conferences in the Soviet Union, but for various reasons declined to attend.

During the year and a half that Otto spent in exile in Gallipoli and later in Constantinople, he became an impoverished refugee, eating at relief agencies and taking any job he could find. For some time, he worked as a woodcutter, residing with fellow Russian officers, often 6 people in a tent. One night, a neighboring tent was hit by lightning, killing everyone inside. Struve wrote to his uncle Hermann Struve in Germany for assistance, without knowing that his uncle had died a few months earlier, on August 12, 1920. However, the widow of Hermann, Eva Struve, contacted Paul Guthnick, her late husband&#x27;s successor at the Berlin-Babelsberg Observatory. Germany itself was suffering after the wars, and there was little chance to obtain a position for a Russian there. Therefore, Guthnick wrote, on December 25, 1920, to the director of Yerkes Observatory in Williams Bay, Wisconsin, Edwin B. Frost asking a position for Struve. He received a reply on January 27, 1921, where Frost promised to do his best. On March 2, 1921, Frost wrote to Struve, offering him a position at Yerkes. Given his situation in Turkey, it was a lucky chance that Struve received that letter. On March 11, Struve sent a reply, thanking Frost for the offer and accepting it. The letter was formally written in English but with German grammar, revealing the poor English proficiency of Struve (when they later met in US, they spoke in German). Struve also acknowledged that he had no experience in spectral astrophysics. Nevertheless, when applying for his position, Frost mentioned that &quot;I am perfectly willing to take him on his lineage. We regard Otto Struve as a first-class spectroscopist and astrophysicist&quot;, and that his degree in Kharkov was equivalent to a doctoral degree (which Struve never claimed and which was hardly so). It took several months to arrange for travel documents and funding. In late August 1921, Struve received his visa and travel tickets at the US Consulate in Turkey. In September, he boarded &quot;S.S. Hog Island&quot; and on October 7, 1921, arrived in New York. He was met there, put on the train, and two days later arrived in Chicago.

==Life in the United States==
In late 1921, Struve began working as a stellar spectroscopy assistant at Yerkes with a monthly salary of $75, starting with taking a training course. The observatory was in decline and Struve was alone in class. Three more students joined him in 1922, but only for a summer, and only one of those continued later. There were no lectures, and the students were learning by reading, practice and discussions with professors.

Struve proved to be a quick learner and talented scientist. Five months after arrival, he made his first discovery of a pulsating star at Gamma Ursae Minoris and wrote an article on it in September 1922. He was spending more time with observations than anyone at Yerkes, trying every telescope available there, and also making weather observations at Williams Bay. On October 24, 1922, he discovered the asteroid 991 McDonalda and on November 14 of the same year, another asteroid 992 Swasey.

As early as December 1923, Struve defended his PhD thesis on short-period spectroscopic double stars at the University of Chicago. Frost helped him in waiving some required PhD examinations, e.g. in French and German, stating that Struve had done ample reading of scientific literature back in Russia, and was fluent in those languages. Struve then became an instructor (January 1924), assistant professor (1927) and full professor (1932) at the university. His rapid promotion was again assisted by Frost, who also used job-offer letters from other observatories to Struve as proof that Struve was a highly valued scientist who must be kept at the University of Chicago. Between 1932 and 1947, Struve headed Yerkes Observatory; from 1939 to 1950 he acted as a founding director of the McDonald Observatory, and from July 1, 1952, to 1962 served as the first director of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at University of Virginia. All those years, he remained in America except for conferences and an 8-month sabbatical leave to the University of Cambridge between August 1928 and May 1929. He applied for and won a Guggenheim Fellowship to cover his travel to, and living expenses in, Cambridge. While in Cambridge, Struve mostly worked on interstellar matter; he also went on a short trip to Leiden to meet Jan Oort.

Struve was a highly successful administrator who brought fame to Yerkes Observatory and rebuilt the astronomy department of the University of Chicago. In particular, he gradually renewed the scientific staff, dismissing stagnated permanent researchers who were not making significant contributions to science but were occupying the faculty positions. The process was difficult. Struve used to arrive first and leave last from the observatory, taking notes on working hours of staff which he then used in his bureaucratic moves. In replacement, he hired several young and talented researchers who later became world-famous scientists. Those included Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar (Nobel Prize in Physics in 1983), Gerard Kuiper (protagonist of the famous Kuiper Prize), Bengt Strömgren, Gerhard Herzberg (Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1971), William Wilson Morgan and Jesse L. Greenstein. After World War II, he also invited a number of leading European researchers, such as Pol Swings, Jan Oort (father of radio astronomy), Marcel Minnaert, H. C. van der Hulst and Albrecht Unsöld. As most of them were foreigners, their appointment met strong opposition from the science officials for various reasons, such as taking jobs from Americans during the Great Depression. India-born Chandrasekhar, who spent a month in the Soviet Union in 1934, was also suspected of Communist connections. Struve spent extraordinary efforts defending and justifying each case, and those efforts paid off in building the scientific school at Yerkes and University of Chicago. For example, Chandrasekhar spent his entire career as a scientist and administrator at the University of Chicago, assisting Struve and eventually replacing him as president of the American Astronomical Society (from 1949) and as the Editor in Chief of the &quot;Astrophysical Journal&quot;.

By the late 1940s, many young researchers whom Struve invited to Yerkes became established scientists. This created friction, as they did not want to follow his every word and were building their own careers. In 1947, Struve resigned as director of Yerkes Observatory and became chairman of the astronomy department at Berkeley and director of the Leuschner Observatory. He was succeeded by Kuiper at Yerkes; their relations were strained at times because of Struve&#x27;s tendencies to keep control of Yerkes management. There were also rumors of similar strains between Struve and Chandrasekhar, but they were always dispersed by the latter, who insisted that Struve always kept scientific relations with his colleagues above the administrative ones. One reason for Struve&#x27;s move to Berkeley was his tiredness of bureaucracy. In Berkeley, he was spending more time with personal research and students than ever before.

==Research==
In 1937, Struve discovered a phenomenon which was later named the Struve-Sahade effect (S-S effect), that is the apparent weakness of lines of the secondary star in massive binary stars when the secondary is receding. This effect poses problems for the accurate reconstruction of the separated primary and secondary spectra. The same year, he discovered interstellar hydrogen in ionized form.

By 1959, Struve had published more than 900 journal articles and books, making him one of the most prolific astronomers (probably only Ernst Öpik published more, with 1,094 items). Many of those works aimed at popularizing astronomy. In particular, he published 39 articles (and 10 other items) in &quot;Popular Astronomy&quot; (1923–1951, the journal was discontinued in 1951), 154 in &quot;Sky and Telescope&quot; (1941–1963, the journal was started in 1941) and 83 reviews of books and works by other astronomers. Most of his co-authored scientific articles were co-authored with Pol Swings and were dedicated to spectroscopical studies of peculiar stars. To explain his interest in this topic, Struve once noted that he had never seen a spectrum of a star where he couldn&#x27;t find anything to work on.

Struve&#x27;s major discoveries were detection of stellar rotation and dependence of the
rotational speed on the stellar spectral class (temperature). They spurred the development of
stellar evolution theory. In addition to stellar rotation, he also studied Stark effect in stellar spectra, that is broadening of the spectral lines by the electric field in the stellar atmosphere. He also worked on the turbulence of stellar atmosphere and expanding shells around stars. This topic required a larger telescope than those available to him. Therefore, between 1933 and 1939, he built an 82-inch telescope at the McDonald Observatory, which was then the second largest telescope in the world (after the Mt. Wilson telescope).

==Views on extraterrestrial life==
Struve&#x27;s belief in the widespread existence of life and intelligence in the Universe stemmed from his studies of slow-rotating stars. Many stars, including the Sun, spin at a much lower rate than was predicted by contemporary theories of early stellar evolution. The reason for this, claimed Struve, was that they were surrounded by planetary systems which had carried away much of the stars&#x27; original angular momentum. So numerous were the slow-spinning stars that Struve estimated, in 1960, there might be as many as 50 billion planets in our Galaxy alone. As to how many might harbor intelligent life, he wrote:

An intrinsically improbable event may become highly probable if the number of events is very great. ... [I]t is probable that a good many of the billions of planets in the Milky Way support intelligent forms of life. To me this conclusion is of great philosophical interest. I believe that science has reached the point where it is necessary to take into account the action of intelligent beings, in addition to the classical laws of physics.

==Personal life, family relations, and late years==
Struve had a younger brother and two sisters, all of whom died in Russia in their youth: Werner (1903–1920), Yadviga (1901–1924) and Elizabeth (1911–1920). The last death in 1924 left his mother with no close relatives in Russia. After Struve arranged visa documents, she immigrated to the US in January 1925. Remarkably, his mother began working in astronomy in the US and assisted in processing of the measurements. She lived with Struve even after his marriage.
On May 25, 1925, Struve married Mary Martha Lanning, who considered herself a musician but worked as a secretary at Yerkes. Lanning was slightly older than Struve and had been previously married. They had no children; thus the famous Struve astronomical dynasty came to an end. Other branches of the Struve family besides the line of Otto Wilhelm von Struve continued, but yielded no distinguished scientists. On October 26, 1927, Struve became a naturalized US citizen. At that time, he was fluent in spoken and written English, but had a slight German accent which remained with him for life. Even after marriage, Struve continued working days and nights, something that his non-scientist wife could not fully accept. Although they remained together, their relations were cold in later years. Struve&#x27;s health deteriorated in the late 1950s. He was suffering from hepatitis, first contracted back in Russia and Turkey. In 1956, while using a telescope at Mount Wilson, Struve had a bad fall, breaking several ribs and cracking two vertebrae. He was hospitalized for about two months and had to wear a body cast for a month after recovery. He was permanently hospitalized around 1963 and died on April 6, 1963, in Berkeley. He was survived by his mother and wife. His mother died on October 1, 1964, at the age of ninety. Mary was discovered dead on August 5, 1966, but was estimated to have died in July 1966.

In 1925, Struve met his cousin, the astronomer Georg Hermann Struve at the Lick Observatory. In 1930s, they met again at Yerkes Observatory and reanalyzed observations of the complex multiple star system Zeta Cancri by their grandfather Otto Wilhelm von Struve.

==Personal qualities==
Struve was often described as a big and intimidating man. According to him, in his fifties, he was six feet tall, weighed 192 pounds, had gray hair and eyes. Struve was also known as persistent, dedicated and demanding, both to himself and others – the qualities preserved in his family for generations. He was first to arrive at the observatory, often working until late evening in the office, and then spending nights with a telescope. &quot;He had only one interest and concern, namely, that astronomy should be developed and pushed to the maximum that was possible&quot;. As a result, Struve was usually overworked, developed an insomnia and often appeared as in a daze after a 2–3 hour sleep.

Struve was hardly a good teacher: because of his devotion to research and frequent trips, he missed up to two-thirds of his lectures. Nobody was allowed to take his place and students had to do personal research in his absence. Yet, he kept the highest standards of knowledge at the qualifying exams. On the other hand, his infrequent appearances magnetized many students with his passion to astronomy. During his early years at Yerkes, he developed the practice of looking with one eye into the microscope of a micrograph instrument and with another at the nearby numerical table. This probably resulted in his eyes looking into slightly different directions.

Although he did not care much about himself, Struve worried about people. His first paper published in Russian was titled &quot;Aid to Russian Scientists&quot;. The Civil War brought suffering to most scientific families in Russia. Frost, Struve and George Van Biesbroeck formed a &quot;Committee for Relief of Russian Astronomers&quot; and organized sending packages of food and clothing. The funds and clothing came from astronomers from all over the US.

During the Great Depression, he was concerned about hiring foreigners when many Americans were jobless. Around that time, the wife of his deputy George Van Biesbroeck wrote a letter to Belgium, mentioning how Yerkes Observatory was being run by two Europeans. The letter was published and it upset Struve. Eventually, Van Biesbroeck was replaced by American-born W. W. Morgan.

==Awards and honors==
Struve was elected to both the United States National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society in 1937. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1942. He received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1944), the Bruce Medal (1948), the Henry Draper Medal of the National Academy of Sciences (1949) and the Henry Norris Russell Lectureship of the American Astronomical Society (1957). His Royal Society medal was the fourth (after Friedrich Georg Wilhelm, Otto Wilhelm and Hermann Struve) and the last received by Struves. The asteroid 768 Struveana was named in honor of Otto Wilhelm von Struve, Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve and Karl Hermann Struve; and a lunar crater was named for another 3 astronomers of the Struve family: Friedrich Georg Wilhelm, Otto Wilhelm and Otto. The 82-inch telescope which Struve used in his research at McDonald Observatory was named after him in 1966, three years after his death, whereas the asteroid 2227 Otto Struve bore Struve&#x27;s name from its discovery on October 13, 1955.

In 1925, Struve began reviewing articles for the &quot;Astrophysical Journal&quot; and from 1932 to 1947, acted as its Editor in Chief. From 1946 till 1949 he was president of American Astronomical Society. Between 1948 and 1952, he was vice-president and between 1952 and 1955 president of the International Astronomical Union. In April, 1954 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1950 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Between 1939 and 1961, he received honorary doctorate degrees from nine universities in Europe and America.

<text>Denzil Foster and Thomas McElroy are an American R&amp;B record production and songwriting duo, releasing recordings under the names Foster &amp; McElroy and Fmob. They have written and produced songs for musicians such as Club Nouveau, Tony! Toni! Toné!, Alexander O&#x27;Neal, Regina Belle, and Swing Out Sister. Their music has been sampled in hit songs by the Luniz, Puff Daddy, Ashanti, Jay-Z, Jennifer Lopez, LL Cool J, Jessica Simpson, and others. Foster &amp; McElroy are best known as the founders of the group En Vogue, listed by Billboard as one of the &quot;Top 10 Girl Groups of All Time&quot;. In addition to producing music for various television shows, they are also credited for songs in numerous movie soundtracks including &quot;The Great White Hype&quot;, &quot;Lean on Me&quot;, and &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot;.

==Biography==
Denzil Foster was born in Oakland, CA and was greatly influenced by different styles of music, from The Beatles to Parliament/Funkadelic. Thomas McElroy, also born in Oakland, was influenced by his father&#x27;s love for jazz music. The two musicians first met in California while attending college and decided to work together as colleagues.

==Career==

Signing to the independent Triangle label, they released one 12&quot; single. Soon after, Foster &amp; McElroy joined forces with Jay King producing Timex Social Club&#x27;s hit single &quot;Rumors&quot; in 1986. When that group disbanded, they regrouped with King to form Club Nouveau. Eventually, the duo left Club Nouveau after their first album &quot;Life, Love &amp; Pain&quot; to focus on production and songwriting. In 1988, they landed a production deal with Wing Records, eventually signing the band Tony! Toni! Toné!, as well as brother and sister act Channel 2.

Foster &amp; McElroy are considered pioneers of new jack swing, a genre they helped define with the group Tony! Toni! Tone!. The duo produced the group&#x27;s first album and had success with the first single release, &quot;Little Walter,&quot; which peaked at #47 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 1990, the group released &quot;The Revival&quot;, its second album which went 2x&#x27;s Platinum and had numerous #1 singles. Following the success of Tony! Toni! Toné!, Foster &amp; McElroy released their first album as a group, &quot;FM2&quot;, one of which included songs such as &quot;Around the World in 80 Beats&quot;, &quot;Gotta Be a Better Way&quot;, and &quot;Dr. Soul&quot;, the latter of which was a top ten R&amp;B hit featuring rapper MC Lyte. It earned moderate success. While working on the album, Foster &amp; McElroy made plans to put together a girl group that would be a modern-day version of The Supremes, with what eventually became the group En Vogue.

After several audition calls, Foster &amp; McElroy eventually selected Cindy Herron, Maxine Jones, and Dawn Robinson to become the members of the newly titled &quot;For You.&quot; The group became a quartet after the addition of Terry Ellis and the name was changed to &quot;Vogue.&quot; After learning that another group already had that moniker, Foster &amp; McElroy changed the name to &quot;En Vogue.&quot; The group&#x27;s first album, &quot;Born to Sing&quot;, was released in 1990 and sold over one million copies with numerous singles reaching #1 on Billboard charts. En Vogue&#x27;s second album, &quot;Funky Divas&quot;, was released in 1992 and became the highest selling album to date and one of the top selling albums of that year with over five million copies sold worldwide. With hits such as &quot;Hold On&quot;, &quot;Lies&quot;, &quot;Free Your Mind&quot;, &quot;My Lovin&#x27; (You&#x27;re Never Gonna Get It)&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go (Love)&quot;, En Vogue has become one of the most successful girl groups in music history. It was also listed as one of the Top 10 Girl Groups of All Time by &quot;Billboard&quot;.

They recorded a second album in 1994, a hip-hop jazz album &quot;Once in a Blue Moon&quot;, under their new name FMob. The duo has also written theme songs for television programs, including &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Mr. Cooper&quot;, &quot;Roc&quot; (both themes, used during the former’s first season and the latter’s final two seasons, were performed by En Vogue), and BET&#x27;s &quot;Video Soul&quot;. They have also been credited with numerous movie soundtracks.

<doc id="584593" wikidata="Q1642390" url="?curid=584593" title="Lake Burley Griffin">
<text>Lake Burley Griffin is an artificial lake in the centre of Canberra, the capital of Australia. It was created in 1963 by the damming of the Molonglo River, which formerly ran between the city centre and Parliamentary Triangle. The lake is named after Walter Burley Griffin, the architect who won the competition to design the city of Canberra.

Griffin designed the lake with many geometric motifs, so that the axes of his design lined up with natural geographical landmarks in the area. However, government authorities changed his original plans, and no substantial work was completed on the lake before he left the project in 1920. Griffin&#x27;s proposal was further delayed by the Great Depression and World War II, and it was not until the 1950s that planning resumed. After political disputes and consideration of other proposed variations, excavation work began in 1960 with the energetic backing of Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies. After the completion of the bridges and dams, the dams were locked in September 1963. However, because of a drought, the lake&#x27;s target water level was not reached until April 1964. The lake was formally inaugurated on 17 October 1964.

The lake is located in the approximate geographic centre of the city, and it is the centrepiece of the capital in accordance with Griffin&#x27;s original designs. Numerous important institutions, such as the National Gallery, National Museum, National Library, Australian National University and the High Court were built on its shores, and Parliament House is a short distance away. Its surrounds, consisting mainly of parklands, are popular with recreational users, particularly in the warmer months. Though swimming in the lake is uncommon, it is used for a wide variety of other activities, such as rowing, fishing, and sailing.

The lake is an ornamental body with a length of and a width, at its widest, of . It has an average depth of and a maximum depth of about near the Scrivener Dam. Its flow is regulated by the Scrivener Dam, designed to handle floods that occur once in 5,000 years. In times of drought, water levels can be maintained through the release of water from Googong Dam, located on an upstream tributary of the Molonglo River.

==Design history==
Charles Robert Scrivener (1855–1923) recommended the site for Canberra in 1909, which was to be a planned capital city for the country. One of the reasons for the location&#x27;s selection was its ability to store water &quot;for ornamental purposes at reasonable cost&quot;; Scrivener&#x27;s work had demonstrated that the topography could be used to create a lake through flooding.

In 1911, a competition for the design of Canberra was launched, and Scrivener&#x27;s detailed survey of the area was supplied to the competing architects. The Molonglo River flowed through the site, which was a flood plain and Scrivener&#x27;s survey showed in grey an area clearly representing an artificial lake—similar to the lake later created—and four possible locations for a dam to create it. Most of the proposals took the hint and included artificial bodies of water.

=== Walter Burley Griffin&#x27;s design ===

The American architect Walter Burley Griffin won the contest and was invited to Australia to oversee the construction of the nation&#x27;s new capital after the judges&#x27; decision was ratified by King O&#x27;Malley, the Minister for Home Affairs. Griffin&#x27;s proposal, which had an abundance of geometric patterns, incorporated concentric hexagonal and octagonal streets emanating from several radii.

His lake design was at the heart of the city and consisted of a Central Basin in the shape of a circular segment, a West and East Basin, which were both approximately circular, and a West and East Lake, which were much larger and irregularly shaped, at either side of the system. The East Lake was supposed to be higher than the remaining components. Griffin&#x27;s proposal was &quot;the grandest scheme submitted, yet it had an appealing simplicity and clarity.

The lakes were deliberately designed so that their orientation was related to various topographical landmarks in Canberra. The lakes stretched from east to west and divided the city in two; a land axis perpendicular to the central basin stretched from Capital Hill—the future location of the new Parliament House on a mound on the southern side—north northeast across the central basin to the northern banks along Anzac Parade to the Australian War Memorial (although a casino was originally planned in its place). This was designed so that looking from Capital Hill, the War Memorial stood directly at the foot of Mount Ainslie. At the southwestern end of the land axis was Bimberi Peak.

The straight edge of the circular segment that formed the central basin was designated the water axis, and it extended northwest towards Black Mountain. A line parallel to the water axis, on the northern side of the city, was designated the municipal axis. The municipal axis became the location of Constitution Avenue, which linked City Hill in Civic Centre and Market Centre. Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue were to run from the southern side from Capital Hill to City Hill and Market Centre on the north respectively, and they formed the western and eastern edges of the central basin. The area enclosed by the three avenues was known as the Parliamentary Triangle, and was to form the centrepiece of Griffin&#x27;s work.

Later, Scrivener, as part of a government design committee, was responsible for modifying Griffin&#x27;s winning design. He recommended changing the shape of the lake from Griffin&#x27;s very geometric shapes to a much more organic one using a single dam, unlike Griffin&#x27;s series of weirs. Griffin lobbied for the retention of the pure geometry, saying that they were &quot;one of the reasons d&#x27;etre of the ornamental waters&quot;, but he was overruled. The new design included elements from several of the best design submissions and was widely criticised as being ugly. The new plan for the lake retained Griffin&#x27;s three formal basins: east, central, and west, though in a more relaxed form.

Griffin entered into correspondence with the government over the plan and its alternatives, and he was invited to Canberra to discuss the matter. Griffin arrived in August 1913 and was appointed Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction for three years.

The plans were varied again in the following years, but the design of Lake Burley Griffin remained based largely on the original committee&#x27;s plan. It was later gazetted and legally protected by the federal parliament in 1926, based on a 1918 plan. However, Griffin had a strained working relationship with the Australian authorities and a lack of federal government funding meant that by the time he left in 1920, little significant work had been done on the city. A 1920s proposal to reduce West Lake into a ribbon of water was made on the basis of flood safety. However, the Owen and Peake report of 1929 ruled that the original design was hydrologically sound.

===Political disputes and modifications===

With the onset of the Great Depression, followed by World War II, development of the new capital was slow, and in the decade after the end of the war, Canberra was criticised for resembling a village, and its disorganised collection of buildings was deemed ugly. Canberra was often derisively described as &quot;several suburbs in search of a city&quot;.

During this time, the Molonglo River flowed through the flood basin, with only a small fraction of the water envisaged in Griffin&#x27;s plan. The centre of his capital city consisted of mostly farmland, with small settlements—mostly wooden, temporary and ad hoc—on either side. There was little evidence that Canberra was planned, and the lake and Parliamentary Triangle at the heart of Griffin&#x27;s plan was but a paddock. Royal Canberra Golf Course, and Acton Racecourse and a sports ground were located on the pastoral land that was to become the West Lake, and people had to disperse the livestock before playing sport. A rubbish dump stood on the northern banks of the location of the central basin, and no earth had been moved since Griffin&#x27;s departure three decades earlier.

In 1950, the East Lake—the largest component—was eliminated upon the advice of the National Capital Planning and Development Committee (NCPDC). Today, what would have been the East Lake corresponds to the suburb of Fyshwick. The rationale given was that around of farmland would be submerged and that the Molonglo would have insufficient water to keep the lake filled.

In 1953, the NCPDC excised the West Lake from its plans and replaced it with a winding stream, which was wide and covered around a fifth of the original area. As the NCPDC had only advisory powers, this change was attributed to the influence of senior officials in the Department of the Interior who felt that Griffin&#x27;s plan was too grandiose. Advocates of watered-down scheme thought it was more economical and saved of land for development. However, according to engineering reports that were ignored, the smaller plan would actually cost more money and require a more complicated structure of dams that would in any case be less able to prevent flooding.

Initially, there was little opposition during the consultation period before the alterations were made. However, opposition to the reduction of the water area grew. The process that resulted in the alteration was criticised for being non-transparent and sneaky. Some organisations complained that they were not given an opportunity to express their opinion before the change was gazetted, and many politicians and the chief town planner were not informed. Critics bitterly insinuated that politically influential members of the Royal Canberra Golf Club, whose course was situated on the location of the proposed West Lake, were responsible for the change in policy.

The Parliamentary Public Works Committee advised the Parliament to restore the West Lake. After an inquiry in late 1954, it concluded that:

The Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, regarded the state of the national capital as an embarrassment. Over time his attitude changed from one of contempt to that of championing its development. He fired two ministers charged with the development of the city, feeling that their performance lacked intensity.

In 1958, the newly created National Capital Development Commission (NCDC), which had been created and given more power by Menzies following a 1955 Senate inquiry, restored the West Lake to its plans, and it was formally gazetted in October 1959. The NCDC also blocked a plan by the Department of Works to build a bridge across the lake along the land axis between Parliament House and the War Memorial contrary to Griffin&#x27;s plans.

A powerful Senate Select Committee oversaw the NCDC and renowned British architect Sir William Holford was brought in to fine-tune Griffin&#x27;s original plans. He changed the central basin&#x27;s geometry so that it was no longer a segment of circle; he converted the southern straight edge into a polygonal shape with three edges and inserted a gulf on the northern shore. The result was closer to Scrivener&#x27;s modified design some decades earlier.

== Final layout ==

The lake contains of water with a surface area of . It is long, wide at its widest point, has a shoreline of and a water level of above sea level.

The lake is relatively shallow; the maximum depth is near the Scrivener Dam, and the average depth is . The shallowest part of the complex in the East Basin, which has an average depth of . The minimum depth of the water at the walls is around and rock is placed at the toe of the wall to inhibit aquatic plant growth.

Lake Burley Griffin initially contained six islands, three unnamed small islands and three larger named islands. Of the larger islands, Queen Elizabeth II Island is located in Central Basin while Springbank and Spinnaker Island are located in the West Lake. Queen Elizabeth II Island is connected to dry land by a footbridge, and is the site of the Australian National Carillon. A seventh island was created as part of the Kingston Foreshore development in the East Basin, where a wide channel was excavated creating an island out of the northern most part of the Kingston Foreshore.

==Construction==
In 1958, engineers conducted studies into the hydrology and structural requirements needed for the building of the dam. Further studies were done to model water quality, siltation, climate effects and change in land quality. Modelling based on the data collection suggested that the water level could be kept within a metre of the intended level of above sea level in the case of a flood.

In February 1959, formal authority for beginning construction was granted. However, while Menzies was on holiday, some officials from the Department of Treasury convinced ministers to withhold money needed for the lake, so the start of the construction was delayed. Once it started, progress was fast. At its peak, the number of people physically working on the construction in the lakes was between 400 and 500. John Overall, the Commissioner of the NCDC, promised Menzies that the work would be finished within four years, and he succeeded, despite the Prime Minister&#x27;s scepticism. Equipment was quickly requisitioned.

After the lengthy political wrangling over the design had passed, the criticism of the scheme died down. Menzies strongly denounced the &quot;moaning&quot; by opponents of the lake. Most critics decried the project as a waste of money that should have been spent on essential services across Australia. Less strident concerns centred on the potentially negative effects of the lake, such as mosquitoes, ecological degeneration, siltation and the possibility that the lake would create fog. The latter of these concerns has proven to be unfounded.

===Lakes, islands and foreshore===
The excavation of Lake Burley Griffin began in 1960 with the clearing of vegetation from the floodplain of the Molonglo River. The trees on the golf course and along the river were pulled up, along with the various sports grounds and houses.

During major earthworks, at least of topsoil was excavated. It was collected for use at several public parks and gardens, including the future Commonwealth Park on the northern shore. It was also used to create the six artificial islands including Springbank Island. The island was named after the former Springbank Farm that was situated there. Land excavated to create a sailing course at Yarralumla was used for the thematically named Spinnaker Island to its north, while excavated stone was moved beside the Kings Avenue Bridge at the eastern edge of the central basin from Queen Elizabeth II Island.

Care was taken to excavate the entire lake floor to a depth of at least to provide sufficient clearance for boat keels. Another reason given for this was that mosquitoes would not breed nor would weeds grow at such a depth. A soil conservation program was launched in the catchment and bed load traps were installed to minimise loss of earth. The traps have been used as a source of sand and gravel for building sites. Drainage blankets were used to prevent the loss of groundwater beneath the lake.

During the following phase of work, four types of lake margin were constructed. On the southern side of the Central Basin, low reinforced concrete retaining walls were used, while on the eastern side, grouted rock wall can be seen near Commonwealth Park, as well as much of the East Basin. Sand and gravel beaches were built to cater for lakeside recreational pursuits. These are mostly prevalent on the western half of the lake complex. Rocky outcrops, steeply sloping stable shores with water vegetation such as bullrushes were also used. This treatment is evident in the West Lake in Yarralumla. William Holford and Partners were responsible for the foreshore landscaping, and over 55,000 trees were planted in accordance with a detailed scheme. Eucalypts were preferred so as to maintain the natural colour of the city landscape.

===Bridges===
Lake Burley Griffin is crossed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge (), Kings Avenue Bridge () and a roadway over Scrivener Dam. The two bridges were constructed before the lake was filled, and replaced wooden structures. 

Site testing for both the Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue bridges took place during late 1959 to early 1960. The construction of the Kings Avenue Bridge began in 1960, followed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge the year after. Fortunately for the builders, Canberra was in a drought and the ground remained dry during construction. Both bridges use post-tensioned concrete, reinforced with rustproof steel cables.

Both bridges are made of concrete and steel and are dual-carriageway; Commonwealth Avenue has three lanes in each direction while Kings Avenue has two. Instead of traditional lamp post lighting, Kings Avenue Bridge was illuminated by a series of fluorescent tubes on the handrails, a concept known as &quot;integral lighting&quot;. The design was deemed a success, so it was introduced to the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge also. Both structures won awards from the Illuminating Engineering Society.

Kings Avenue Bridge opened on 10 March 1962. Prime Minister Menzies unlocked a ceremonial chain before the motorcade and pageant crossed the lake in front of a large crowd. Commonwealth Avenue Bridge opened in 1963 without an official ceremony. Menzies called it &quot;the finest building in the national capital&quot;.

===Dam===

The dam that holds back the waters of Lake Burley Griffin was named Scrivener Dam after Charles Robert Scrivener. The dam was designed and built by Rheinstahl Union Bruckenbau in West Germany, and used state-of-the-art post-tensioning techniques to cope with any problems or movements in the riverbed. This was required because of the quartz porphyry and geological faulting upon which the dam sits. About of concrete was used in its construction. The dam is high and long with a maximum wall thickness of . The dam is designed to handle a once in 5,000-year flood event. Construction began in September 1960 and the dam was locked in September 1963.

The dam has a five bay spillway controlled by wide, hydraulically operated fish-belly flap gates. The fish-belly gates allow for a precise control of water level, reducing the dead area on the banks between high and low water levels. The five gates have only been opened simultaneously once in the dam&#x27;s history, during heavy flooding in 1976. The gates hold two-thirds of the lake&#x27;s volume. They were designed to allow easy flow of debris out of the lake.

The dam has the capacity to allow a flow of but can withstand up to before &quot;catastrophic damage&quot; results; A flow of can be dealt with without any substantial change in the water level. The highest recorded flow in the Molonglo was during an earlier flood.

Lady Denman Drive, a roadway atop the dam wall, provides a third road crossing for the lake. It consists of a roadway and a bicycle path, and allows residents in western Canberra to cross the lake. This was possible because the dam gates are closed by pushing up from below, unlike most previous designs that wherein the gates were lifted from above.

===Lake filling===
A prolonged drought coincided with and eased work on the lake&#x27;s construction. The valves on the Scrivener Dam were closed on 20 September 1963 by Minister for the Interior, Gordon Freeth; Menzies was absent due to ill health. Several months on, with no rain in sight, mosquito-infested pools of water were the only visible sign of the lake filling. With the eventual breaking of the drought, the lake reached the planned level on 29 April 1964. On 17 October 1964, Menzies (by now Sir Robert) commemorated the filling of the lake and the completion of stage one with an opening ceremony amid the backdrop of sailing craft. The ceremony was accompanied by fireworks display, and Griffin&#x27;s lake had finally come to fruition after five decades, at the cost of A$5,039,050 (). Freeth suggested that Menzies had &quot;been in a material sense the father of the lake&quot; and that the lake should be named after him. Menzies insisted that the lake should be named after Griffin.

In times of severe drought, Lake Burley Griffin&#x27;s water level can fall unacceptably low. When this happens, a release of water from Googong Dam located upstream can be scheduled to top up and restore the lake water level. The Googong Dam is on the Queanbeyan River which is a tributary of the Molonglo River. The dam whose construction was finished in 1979 is one of three dams—the Cotter and Corin Dams are the others—that meet the water supply needs of the Canberra and Queanbeyan region. The Googong Dam&#x27;s water carrying capacity is .

== Later history and development==
Griffin&#x27;s design made the lake a focal point of the city. In the four decades since the initial construction of the lake, various buildings of national importance were added. According to the policy plan of the government, &quot;The lake is not only one of the centrepieces of Canberra&#x27;s plan in its own right, but forms the immediate foreground of the National Parliamentary Area.&quot;

The creation of the lake also gave a water frontage to many prominent institutions that were previously landlocked. The Royal Canberra Hospital was located on the Acton Peninsula between the West Lake and the West Basin on the north shore until its demolition. Government House, the historic Blundell&#x27;s Cottage—which was built over 50 years before construction of Canberra began—and the newly built Australian National University, on the southern and northern shores of the West Lake, both gained a waterfront.

In 1970, two tourist attractions were added to the middle of Central Basin. The Captain James Cook Memorial was built by the government to commemorate the Bicentenary of (then Lieutenant) James Cook&#x27;s first sighting of the east coast of Australia. It includes a water jet fountain located in the central basin (based on the Jet d&#x27;eau in Geneva) and a skeleton globe sculpture at Regatta Point showing the paths of Cook&#x27;s expeditions. On 25 April 1970, Queen Elizabeth II officially inaugurated the memorial. As part of the same ceremony, Queen Elizabeth also opened the National Carillon on Queen Elizabeth II Island, a set of 53 bronze bells donated by the British Government to commemorate the city&#x27;s 50th anniversary.
The completion of the central basin placed a waterway between Parliament House and the War Memorial and a landscaped boulevard was built along the land axis. Later, various buildings of national importance were built along the land axis in the late-1960s through to the early 1980s. The National Library was opened on the western side of the axis in April 1968. Building of the High Court and National Gallery occurred in the late-1970s and the buildings were opened in May 1980 and October 1982 respectively. The latter two buildings lie on the eastern side of the axis and are connected by an aerial bridge. In 1988, the new Parliament House was built on Capital Hill, thereby completing the most important structure in the Parliamentary Triangle.

The current home of the National Museum was built on the former site of the Royal Canberra Hospital in 2001. This occurred after the public were encouraged to watch the controlled demolition of the hospital in 1997, but a girl was killed by flying debris, leading to criticism of the ACT Government.

At the start of the 21st century, the layout of the lake was significantly altered for the first time since its construction, through the Kingston Foreshores Redevelopment on southern shore of the East Basin, which was planned in 1997. A bidding process was enacted, multimillion-dollar luxury apartment complexes were built in the suburb of Kingston, driving property values to record-breaking levels. After a dispute over the environmental impact of the development, building works commenced on the previously industrial lakeside area of the suburb. In 2007, work started to reclaim land from the lakebed to form a harbour.

The Kingston Powerhouse, which used to provide the city&#x27;s power supply, was converted into the Canberra Glassworks in 2007, 50 years after the electricity generators stopped. A tower of glass and light named &quot;Touching Lightly&quot; was unveiled on 21 May 2010 by Chief Minister and Minister for the Arts and Heritage Jon Stanhope. It was built by Australian artist Warren Langley.

In 2007, the government unveiled a proposal to redevelop the area surrounding the historic Albert Hall into a tourist and dining precinct. This included the building of an eight-storey building and the rezoning of some waterfront land currently designated as cultural to commercial. It was met with widespread hostility from heritage activists and the general community, which submitted more than 3,300 signatories in a petition against the scheme. One of the criticisms was that the project was tilted too heavily towards business, and neglected the arts and community events. The proposal was scrapped in 2009.

It was proposed that a footbridge, to be named Immigration Bridge, be built between the National Museum of Australia and Lennox Gardens on the south shore, in recognition of the contributions that immigrants have made to Australia. The proposal mostly received negative feedback. An inquiry recommended that the bridge be redesigned or moved to accommodate the needs of other lake users. The proposal was abandoned in March 2010.

==Lakeside recreation==

The surrounds of Lake Burley Griffin are very popular recreational areas. Public parks exist along most of the shore line, with free electric barbecue facilities, fenced-in swimming areas, picnic tables and toilets. These parklands form a large part of the area around the lake, and occupy in total. Some of the parks reserved for public recreation include Commonwealth, Weston, Kings and Grevillea Parks, Lennox Gardens and Commonwealth Place. Commonwealth and Kings Park on the northern shore of the Central Basin are among the two most popular. The former is an urban horticultural park and is the location of the Canberra Festival.

Commonwealth Park is the location of Floriade, an annual flower festival that is held for around a month in spring and attracts upwards of 300,000 visitors, a number comparable to the city population. The largest flower festival in Australia, the event is a major tourist attraction for the city, and legal action was threatened after another festival in Australia wanted to use the same name. An expansion is being planned to coincide with the centenary of the national capital. The Weston Park to the west is known for its woodland and conifers, while Black Mountain Peninsula is known as a picnicking site with eucalypts. Grevillea and Bowen Parks on the East Basin tend to be little used.

Owing to the proliferation of beaches, boat ramps and jetties, the West Lake is the area most used by swimmers and vessels. A bike path also surrounds the lake, and riding, walking or jogging around the lake are a popular activity on the weekends. Fireworks are often held over the lake on New Year&#x27;s Eve, and a large show called Skyfire has been held at the lake since 1989.

===Water sports===
Lake Burley Griffin, apart from being ornamental, is used for many recreational activities. Canoeing, sailing, paddleboating, windsurfing and dragon boating are popular. A rowing course is set up at the western end of the lake. The National Championships were held in the lake in 1964, but high winds have deterred organisers. On one occasion, winds swept a boat into a bridge pylon. While not particularly popular, opportunities for swimming have been limited recently because of increasingly frequent lake closures due to concerns about water quality; another deterrent against swimming is the generally cold water temperature. During summer, the lake is used for the swim leg of numerous triathlon and aquathlon events including the Sri Chinmoy Triathlon Festival.

Generally, powerboat use on the lake is not permitted. Permits are available for the use of powered boats on the lake for use in rescue, training, commercial purposes or special interest (such as historic steam-powered boats). Molonglo Reach, an area of the Molonglo River just before it enters the east basin is set aside for water skiing. Ten powerboats may be used in this limited area.

===Safety===

The lake is patrolled by the Australian Federal Police water police. The water police give assistance to lake users, helping to right boats and towing crippled craft to shore.

At most swimming locations around Lake Burley Griffin there are fenced-in swimming areas for safety. In the more popular areas, there are also safety lockers with life belts and emergency phones for requesting help. Between 1962 and 1991, seven people died from drowning.

For safety and water quality reasons, the lake has different zones for different activities. The eastern extremity is zoned for primary contact water activities such as swimming and water skiing. The East and Central Basins, closer to populated areas, are zoned for secondary contact water sports such as sailing or rowing. West Lake and Tarcoola Reach, which covers the area between Commonwealth Avenue and Kurrajong Point, is the primary recreational area of the lake, and both primary and secondary contact water sports are permitted. Yarramundi Reach near Scrivener Dam has a marked rowing course, and is zoned as secondary, although primary contact activities are also allowed.

== Environmental issues ==

===Water quality===

Toxic blue-green algae blooms are a reasonably common occurrence in the lake. Warnings about coming into contact with the water are released when an algal bloom is detected. Attempts are being made to limit the amount of phosphates entering the lake in the hope of improving its water quality. Blue-green algae (more correctly cyanobacteria) produce toxins, which can be harmful for humans and any other animals that come in contact with the contaminated water. There have been several cases of dogs being affected after playing in and drinking the lake water.

The water also appears murky due to a high level of turbidity; however, this is not usually a health risk. However, the turbidity, which is caused by wind, prevents photosynthetic stabilisation. Siltation is not considered a major problem and is only a factor in the East Basin, but dredging is not required. The problem has eased with the construction of the Googong Dam, and the spectre of heavy metal pollution has receded, partly due to the closure of some lead mines upstream. However, leaching and groundwater leakage still causes some pollution. Rubbish, oil and sediment traps have been set up at the incoming openings to the lake to minimise pollution.

===Aquatic life and fishing===
Fishing is quite popular in the lake. The most common species caught is the illegally introduced carp. Annual monitoring is carried out to determine fish populations. Almost equally as common are the introduced redfin European perch, with these being a regular by catch when fishing for golden perch. However, a number of less common species also inhabit the lake, including native Murray cod, western carp gudgeon and golden perch, as well as introduced goldfish, &quot;Gambusia&quot;, rainbow trout and brown trout.

The lake has been stocked annually with a variety of introduced and native species and over half a million fish have been released since 1981. There have been many changes to the fish populations in the lake as well as stocking practices since it was first filled.

Regular stocking since the start of the 1980s have re-established reasonable populations of golden perch and Murray cod; native fish that were indigenous to the Molonglo River before the lake was built, but had been lost to mining pollution of the Molonglo River in the first half of the 20th century. The main reason for stocking is to boost fish stocks along the Molonglo, which have been depleted by overfishing, introduced species and habitat destruction. One of the motives for raising the level of Murray cod and golden perch is to balance the ecosystem by having them act as native predators of other fish.

Native Silver perch and introduced brown trout were released in 1981–1983 and 1987–1989 respectively, but have not been stocked since. Silver perch stockings resulted in almost no captures. Introduced rainbow trout have been released sporadically, approximately once a decade, but have not been released since 2002–04, due to unacceptably low survival rates. According to a government report, the reason for the low survival rate is unknown, but the dominance of carp in the competition for food is one suggested theory. However, the eutrophic nature and high water temperatures of the lake in summer are more probable reasons. Golden perch and Murray cod have accounted for around four-fifths of the released fish in the last three decades and have been the only fish stocked in the last five years. The government plans to stock only these two species for the five years leading up to 2014.

<doc id="584598" wikidata="Q73346630" url="?curid=584598" title="Acidobacteriota">
<text>Acidobacteriota is a phylum of Gram-negative bacteria. Its members are physiologically diverse and ubiquitous, especially in soils, but are under-represented in culture.

==Description==
Members of this phylum are physiologically diverse, and can be found in a variety of environments including soil, decomposing wood, hot springs, oceans, caves, and metal-contaminated soils. The members of this phylum are particularly abundant in soil habitats representing up to 52% of the total bacterial community. Environmental factors such as pH and nutrients have been seen to drive Acidobacteriota dynamics. Many Acidobacteriota are acidophilic, including the first described member of the phylum, &quot;Acidobacterium capsulatum&quot;.

There is much that is unknown about Acidobacteria both in their form and function. Thus, this is a growing field of microbiology. Some of this uncertainty can be attributed to the difficulty with which these bacteria are grown in the laboratory. There has been recent success in propagation by using low concentrations of nutrients in combination with high amounts of CO2, yet, progress is still quite slow. These new methods have only allowed approximately 30% of subdivisions to have species documented.

Additionally, many of the samples sequenced do not have taxonomic names as they have not yet been fully characterized. This area of study is a very current topic, and scientific understanding is expected to grow and change as new information comes to light.

Other notable species are &quot;Holophaga foetida&quot;, &quot;Geothrix fermentans&quot;, &quot;Acanthopleuribacter pedis&quot; and &quot;Bryobacter aggregatus&quot;.
Since they have only recently been discovered and the large majority have not been cultured, the ecology and metabolism of these bacteria is not well understood. However, these bacteria may be an important contributor to ecosystems, since they are particularly abundant within soils. Members of subdivisions 1, 4, and 6 are found to be particularly abundant in soils.

As well as their natural soil habitat, unclassified subdivision 2 Acidobacteriota have also been identified as a contaminant of DNA extraction kit reagents, which may lead to their erroneous appearance in microbiota or metagenomic datasets.

Members of subdivision 1 have been found to dominate in low pH conditions. Additionally, Acidobacteriota from acid mine drainage have been found to be more adapted to acidic pH conditions (pH 2-3) compared to Acidobacteriota from soils, potentially due to cell specialization and enzyme stability.

The G+C content of Acidobacteria genomes are consistent within their subdivisions - above 60% for group V fragments and roughly 10% lower for group III fragments.

The majority of Acidobacteriota are considered aerobes. There are some Acidobacteriota that are considered anaerobes within subdivision 8 and subdivision 23. It has been found that some strains of Acidobacteriota originating from soils have the genomic potential to respire oxygen at atmospheric and sub-atmospheric concentrations.

Members of the &quot;Acidobacteriota&quot; phylum have been considered oligotrophic bacteria due to high abundances in low organic carbon environments. However, the variation in this phylum may indicate that they may not have the same ecological strategy.

==History==
The first species, &quot;Acidobacterium capsulatum&quot;, of this phylum was discovered in 1991. However, Acidobacteriota were not recognized as a distinct clade until 1997, and were not recognized as a phylum until 2012. First genome was sequenced in 2006.

== Subdivisions ==
In an effort to further classify Acidobacteria, 16S rRNA gene regions were sequenced from many different strains. These sequences lead to the formation of subdivisions within the phyla. Today, there are 26 accepted subdivisions recognized in the Ribosomal Database Project.

Much of this variety comes from populations of acidobacteria found in soils contaminated with uranium. Therefore, most of the known species in this phyla are concentrated in a few of the subdivisions, the largest being #1. Most of these microbes are aerobes, and they are all heterotrophic. Subdivision 1 contains 11 of the known genera in addition to the majority of the species that have been able to be cultivated thus far.

Within the 22 known genera, there are 40 conclusive species. The genera are divided amongst subdivisions 3, 4, 8, 10, 23, and 1. As the Acidobateria are a developing area of microbiology, it is hypothesized that these numbers will change drastically with further study.

== Metabolism ==

=== Carbon ===
Some members of subdivision 1 are able to use -glucose, -xylose, and lactose as carbon sources, but are unable to use fucose or sorbose. Members of subdivision 1 also contain enzymes such as galactosidases used in the breakdown of sugars. Members of subdivision 4 have been found to use chitin as a carbon source.

Despite the presence of genetic information generally known to encode for carbohydrate processing machinery in various genera of Acidobacteria, several experimental studies have demonstrated the inability to break down various polysaccharides.

Cellulose is the main component of plant cell walls and a seemingly opportune resource for carbon. However, only a single species across all subdivisions has been shown to process it, &quot;Telmactobacter bradus&quot; from subvision 1. Scientists note that it is much too early in their understanding of the field to draw conclusions about carbon processing in Acidobacteria, but believe that xylan degradation (a polysaccharide primarily found in the secondary cell wall of plants) currently appears to be the most universal carbon breakdown ability.

Researchers believe that an additional factor in the lack of understanding of carbon degradation by acidobacteria may stem from the present limited ability to provide adequate cultivation conditions. To study the natural behavior of these bacteria, they must grow and live in a controlled, observable environment. If such a habitat cannot be provided, recorded data cannot reliably report on the activity of the microbes in question. Therefore, the inconsistencies between genome sequence based predictions and observed carbon processes may be explained by present study methods.

=== Nitrogen ===
There has been no clear evidence that Acidobacteriota are involved in nitrogen-cycle processes such as nitrification, denitrification, or nitrogen fixation. However, &quot;Geothrix fermantans&quot; was shown to be able to reduce nitrate and contained the norB gene. The NorB gene was also identified in &quot;Koribacter verstailis&quot; and &quot;Solibacter usitatus&quot;. In addition, the presence of the nirA gene has been observed in members of subdivision 1. Additionally, to date, all genomes have been described to directly uptake ammonium via ammonium channel transporter family genes. Acidobacteriota can use both inorganic and organic nitrogen as their nitrogen sources.

<doc id="584602" wikidata="Q408458" url="?curid=584602" title="Dinitrogen pentoxide">
<text>Dinitrogen pentoxide (also known as nitrogen pentoxide or nitric anhydride) is the chemical compound with the formula . It is one of the binary nitrogen oxides, a family of compounds that contain only nitrogen and oxygen. It exists as colourless crystals that sublime slightly above room temperature, yielding a colorless gas.

Dinitrogen pentoxide is an unstable and potentially dangerous oxidizer that once was used as a reagent when dissolved in chloroform for nitrations but has largely been superseded by nitronium tetrafluoroborate ().

 is a rare example of a compound that adopts two structures depending on the conditions. The solid is a salt, nitronium nitrate, consisting of separate nitronium cations and nitrate anions ; but in the gas phase and under some other conditions it is a covalently-bound molecule.

==History==
 was first reported by Deville in 1840, who prepared it by treating silver nitrate () with chlorine.

==Structure and physical properties==
Pure solid is a salt, consisting of separated linear nitronium ions and planar trigonal nitrate anions . Both nitrogen centers have oxidation state +5. It crystallizes in the space group &quot;D&quot; (&quot;C&quot;6/&quot;mmc&quot;) with &quot;Z&quot; = 2, with the anions in the &quot;D&quot;3&quot;h&quot; sites and the cations in &quot;D&quot;3&quot;d&quot; sites.

The vapor pressure &quot;P&quot; (in atm) as a function of temperature &quot;T&quot; (in kelvin), in the range , is well approximated by the formula
:formula_1
being about 48 torr at 0 °C, 424 torr at 25 °C, and 760 torr at 32 °C (9 °C below the melting point).

In the gas phase, or when dissolved in nonpolar solvents such as carbon tetrachloride, the compound exists as covalently-bonded molecules . In the gas phase, theoretical calculations for the minimum-energy configuration indicate that the angle in each wing is about 134° and the angle is about 112°. In that configuration, the two groups are rotated about 35° around the bonds to the central oxygen, away from the plane. The molecule thus has a propeller shape, with one axis of 180° rotational symmetry (&quot;C&quot;2) 

When gaseous is cooled rapidly (&quot;quenched&quot;), one can obtain the metastable molecular form, which exothermically converts to the ionic form above −70 °C.

Gaseous absorbs ultraviolet light with dissociation into the free radicals nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen trioxide (uncharged nitrate). The absorption spectrum has a broad band with maximum at wavelength 160 nm.

==Preparation==
A recommended laboratory synthesis entails dehydrating nitric acid () with phosphorus(V) oxide:

Another laboratory process is the reaction of lithium nitrate and bromine pentafluoride , in the ratio exceeding 3:1. The reaction first forms nitryl fluoride that reacts further with the lithium nitrate:
: 

The compound can also be created in the gas phase by reacting nitrogen dioxide or with ozone: 
However, the product catalyzes the rapid decomposition of ozone:

Dinitrogen pentoxide is also formed when a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen is passed through an electric
discharge. Another route is the reactions of Phosphoryl chloride or nitryl chloride with silver nitrate 

==Reactions==
Dinitrogen pentoxide reacts with water (hydrolyses) to produce nitric acid . Thus, dinitrogen pentoxide is the anhydride of nitric acid:

Solutions of dinitrogen pentoxide in nitric acid can be seen as nitric acid with more than 100% concentration. The phase diagram of the system − shows the well-known negative azeotrope at 60% (that is, 70% ), a positive azeotrope at 85.7% (100% ), and another negative one at 87.5% (&quot;102% &quot;).

The reaction with hydrogen chloride also gives nitric acid and nitryl chloride :

Dinitrogen pentoxide eventually decomposes at room temperature into  and . Decomposition is negligible if the solid is kept at 0 °C, in suitably inert containers.

Dinitrogen pentoxide reacts with ammonia to give several products, including nitrous oxide , ammonium nitrate , nitramide and ammonium dinitramide , depending on reaction conditions.

===Decomposition of dinitrogen pentoxide at high temperatures===

Dinitrogen pentoxide between high temperatures of , is decomposed in two successive stoichiometric steps:
: 
In the shock wave, has decomposed stoichiometrically into nitrogen dioxide and oxygen. At temperatures of 600 K and higher, nitrogen dioxide is unstable with respect to nitrogen oxide and oxygen. The thermal decomposition of 0.1 mM nitrogen dioxide at 1000 K is known to require about two seconds.

===Decomposition of dinitrogen pentoxide in carbon tetrachloride at 30 °C===

Apart from the decomposition of at high temperatures, it can also be decomposed in carbon tetrachloride at . Both and are soluble in and remain in solution while oxygen is insoluble and escapes. The volume of the oxygen formed in the reaction can be measured in a gas burette. After this step we can proceed with the decomposition, measuring the quantity of that is produced over time because the only form to obtain is with the decomposition. The equation below refers to the decomposition of in :

And this reaction follows the first order rate law that says:

:formula_2

===Decomposition of nitrogen pentoxide in the presence of nitric oxide===

 can also be decomposed in the presence of nitric oxide :

The rate of the initial reaction between dinitrogen pentoxide and nitric oxide of the elementary unimolecular decomposition.

==Applications==

===Nitration of organic compounds===
Dinitrogen pentoxide, for example as a solution in chloroform, has been used as a reagent to introduce the  functionality in organic compounds. This nitration reaction is represented as follows:

where Ar represents an arene moiety. The reactivity of the can be further enhanced with strong acids that generate the &quot;super-electrophile&quot; .

In this use, has been largely replaced by nitronium tetrafluoroborate . This salt retains the high reactivity of , but it is thermally stable, decomposing at about 180 °C (into  and ).

Dinitrogen pentoxide is relevant to the preparation of explosives.

==Atmospheric occurrence==
In the atmosphere, dinitrogen pentoxide is an important reservoir of the species that are responsible for ozone depletion: its formation provides a null cycle with which and are temporarily held in an unreactive state. Mixing ratios of several parts per billion by volume have been observed in polluted regions of the nighttime troposphere. Dinitrogen pentoxide has also been observed in the stratosphere at similar levels, the reservoir formation having been postulated in considering the puzzling observations of a sudden drop in stratospheric levels above 50 °N, the so-called &#x27;Noxon cliff&#x27;.

Variations in reactivity in aerosols can result in significant losses in tropospheric ozone, hydroxyl radicals, and concentrations. Two important reactions of in atmospheric aerosols are hydrolysis to form nitric acid and reaction with halide ions, particularly , to form  molecules which may serve as precursors to reactive chlorine atoms in the atmosphere.

==Hazards==
 is a strong oxidizer that forms explosive mixtures with organic compounds and ammonium salts. The decomposition of dinitrogen pentoxide produces the highly toxic nitrogen dioxide gas.

<text>Ingeniero Aeronáutico Ambrosio L.V. Taravella International Airport (, ), more commonly known as Pajas Blancas, is located north-northwest of the center of Córdoba, the capital city of the Córdoba Province in Argentina. The airport covers an area of and is operated by &quot;Aeropuertos Argentina 2000 S.A.&quot;

==Overview==

Cordoba is Argentina&#x27;s third-busiest airport, after Ministro Pistarini International Airport and Aeroparque Jorge Newbery, both of which are located in Buenos Aires.

The airport had been a jetport for a long time, having received commercial jet aircraft services before, but it had been lacking the size to receive larger numbers of passengers until Aeropuertos Argentina 2000, a private company that operates several airports in Argentina, decided to give internal Argentine airports more money so that they could expand and lure more airlines. Up until that moment, the Taravella airport, which was named after an architect, only had one story and one terminal.

The construction of a second and third floor began in 2000, designed by prominent local architect Mario Roberto Álvarez; by 2002, it was finished and Aerolíneas Argentinas decided to make the Taravella airport a hub for domestic flights.

The airport is equipped with the necessary lights to have night air traffic, but pilots flying there, especially pilots of light aircraft, are recommended to look out for birds, as there is quite a substantial number of them inhabiting the areas nearby.

From October 2010 to January 2012, Iberia operated a route to Madrid. Air Europa commenced flights from Córdoba to Madrid via Asunción in December 2016. American Airlines began service to Miami in June 2019. The flight ended the following year.

== Airlines and destinations ==
Today, Córdoba Airport primarily serves only domestic and regional destinations across South America, though it does have flights to Central America and Europe, too.

<doc id="584611" wikidata="Q1574438" url="?curid=584611" title="President's Daily Brief">
<text>The President&#x27;s Daily Brief, sometimes referred to as the President&#x27;s Daily Briefing or the President&#x27;s Daily Bulletin, is a top-secret document produced and given each morning to the president of the United States; it is also distributed to a small number of top-level US officials who are approved by the president. It includes highly classified intelligence analysis, information about covert operations, and reports from the most sensitive US sources or those shared by allied intelligence agencies. At the discretion of the president, the PDB may also be provided to the president-elect of the United States, between election day and inauguration, and to former presidents on request.

The PDB is produced by the director of national intelligence, and involves fusing intelligence from the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency (NSA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Defense Department, Homeland Security and other members of the U.S. Intelligence Community.

==Purpose and history==
The need for daily update for the US President on world affairs became critical following the Second World War, as crises around the world developed rapidly. The first routine intelligence briefings began in 1946, as President Truman began to receive a daily summary. 

A prototype of the PDB termed the President&#x27;s Intelligence Check List (PICL) was first produced by CIA officer Richard Lehman at the direction of Huntington D. Sheldon on June 17, 1961 for John F. Kennedy. The PDB was introduced in 1964 to meet the desires of Lyndon B. Johnson.

Although the production and coordination of the PDB was a CIA responsibility, other members of the U.S. intelligence community reviewed articles (the &quot;coordination&quot; process) and were free to write and submit articles for inclusion.

The PDB is intended to provide the president with new intelligence warranting attention and analysis of sensitive international situations. While the name of the PDB implies exclusivity, it has historically been briefed to other high officials. The distribution list has varied over time but has always or almost always included the vice president, secretaries of State and Defense and the national security advisor. Rarely, special editions of the PDB have actually been &quot;for the president&#x27;s eyes only,&quot; with further dissemination of the information left to the president&#x27;s discretion.

Production of the PDB is associated with that of another publication, historically known as the National Intelligence Daily, that includes many of the same items but is distributed considerably more widely than the PDB.

==Sources==
The PDB is an all-source intelligence product summarized from all collecting agencies. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted that a leaked document indicated that the PRISM SIGAD (US-984) run by the NSA is &quot;the number one source of raw intelligence used for NSA analytic reports.&quot; The PDB cited PRISM data as a source in 1,477 items in the 2012 calendar year. Declassified documents show that as of January 2001 over 60% of material in the PDB was sourced from signals intelligence (SIGINT). According to the National Security Archive, the percentage of SIGINT-sourced material has likely increased since then.

==Political importance==
Former CIA director George Tenet considered the PDB so sensitive that during July 2000 he indicated to the National Archives and Records Administration that none of them could be released for publication &quot;no matter how old or historically significant it may be.&quot;

During a briefing on May 21, 2002, Ari Fleischer, former White House Press Secretary, characterized the PDB as &quot;the most highly sensitized classified document in the government.&quot;

On September 16, 2015, CIA director John Brennan spoke at the LBJ Presidential Library, at the public release of a total of 2,500 daily briefs and intelligence checklists from the John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson presidencies. The release was a reversal of the government&#x27;s previous stance in legal briefs attempting to keep the PDB indefinitely classified. On August 24, 2016, the CIA released a further 2,500 briefs from the Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford presidencies at a symposium held at the Nixon Presidential Library.

==Public awareness==
The PDB was scrutinized by news media during testimony to the 9/11 Commission, which was convened during 2004 to analyze the September 11, 2001 attacks. On April 8, 2004, after testimony by then-National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, the commission renewed calls for the declassification of a PDB from August 6, 2001, entitled &quot;Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US&quot;. Two days later, the White House complied and released the document with redaction.

==Usage by presidents and presidents-elect==
During the 2012 re-election campaign, a former Bush administration official and President Barack Obama critic reported that &quot;officials tell me the former president [Bush] held his intelligence meeting six days a week, no exceptions&quot; (for a putative 86% in-person attendance record) though &quot;Bush records [were] not yet available electronically for analysis&quot;.

Obama records, by contrast in this analysis, showed that during &quot;his first 1,225 days in office, Obama attended his PDB just 536 times—or 43.8 percent of the time. During 2011 and the first half of 2012 [within the 1,225 days analyzed], his attendance ... [fell] to just over 38 percent.&quot; Obama initiated electronic delivery of the written brief in 2014 and received it six days a week.

In the first six weeks of the first presidential transition of Donald Trump in 2016, the president-elect averaged about one PDB a week. He had &quot;participated in multiple PDBs in some weeks, CNN has learned. And the transition team said last week Trump would be increasing his PDB participation to three times a week.&quot; However, by the final weeks of his presidency Trump didn&#x27;t have a single PDB listed on his schedule.

During the presidential transition of Joe Biden in 2020, Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris gained access to the PDB in late November 2020. Upon taking office, Biden started committing to receiving the PDB on most days, with Harris in attendance.

In the second presidential transition of Donald Trump in 2024, President-elect Trump began to receive PDBs starting in November 2024.

<text>Max Rostal (7 July 1905 – 6 August 1991) was a violinist and a viola player. He was Austrian-born, but later took British citizenship.

==Biography==
Max Rostal was born in Cieszyn to a Jewish merchant family. As a child prodigy, he started studying the violin at the age of 5, and played in front of Emperor Franz Josef I in 1913.

He studied with Carl Flesch. He also studied theory and composition with Emil Bohnke and Matyás Seiber. He won the Mendelssohn Scholarship in 1925. In 1930–33 he taught at the Berlin Hochschule, from 1944 to 1958 at the Guildhall School of Music, and then at the Musikhochschule Köln (1957–82) and the Conservatory in Bern (1957–85). His pupils included Yfrah Neaman, Igor Ozim, Edith Peinemann, Bryan Fairfax, Lars Anders Tomter and members of the Amadeus Quartet. 

In 1945, in honour of Flesch, he co-founded what was later known as the Carl Flesch International Violin Competition with Edric Cundell.

Rostal played a wide variety of music, but was a particular champion of contemporary works such as Béla Bartók&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 2. He made a number of recordings. Rostal premiered Alan Bush&#x27;s Violin Concerto of 1946–8 in 1949. He was the dedicatee of Benjamin Frankel&#x27;s first solo violin sonata (1942), and he also made the premiere recording. He commissioned the violin concerto by Bernard Stevens in 1943.

Rostal played in a piano trio with Heinz Schröter (piano) and Gaspar Cassadó (cello), who was replaced in 1967 by Siegfried Palm. He edited a number of works for Schott Music, and also produced piano reductions.

Rostal&#x27;s daughter Sybil B. G. Eysenck became a psychologist and is the widow of the personality psychologist Hans Eysenck, with whom she collaborated. Rostal died on 6 August 1991 in Bern, Switzerland.

<doc id="584617" wikidata="Q203221" url="?curid=584617" title="Small interfering RNA">
<text>Small interfering RNA (siRNA), sometimes known as short interfering RNA or silencing RNA, is a class of double-stranded non-coding RNA molecules, typically 20–24 base pairs in length, similar to microRNA (miRNA), and operating within the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. It interferes with the expression of specific genes with complementary nucleotide sequences by degrading messenger RNA (mRNA) after transcription, preventing translation. It was discovered in 1998 by Andrew Fire at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C. and Craig Mello at the University of Massachusetts in Worcester.

== Structure ==

Naturally occurring siRNAs have a well-defined structure that is a short (usually 20 to 24-bp) double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) with phosphorylated 5&#x27; ends and hydroxylated 3&#x27; ends with two overhanging nucleotides.
The Dicer enzyme catalyzes production of siRNAs from long dsRNAs and small hairpin RNAs. siRNAs can also be introduced into cells by transfection. Since in principle any gene can be knocked down by a synthetic siRNA with a complementary sequence, siRNAs are an important tool for validating gene function and drug targeting in the post-genomic era.

==History==
In 1998, Andrew Fire at Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington DC and Craig Mello at University of Massachusetts in Worcester discovered the RNAi mechanism while working on the gene expression in the nematode, &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;. They won the Nobel prize for their research with RNAi in 2006. siRNAs and their role in post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) was discovered in plants by David Baulcombe&#x27;s group at the Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich, England and reported in &quot;Science&quot; in 1999. Thomas Tuschl and colleagues soon reported in &quot;Nature&quot; that synthetic siRNAs could induce RNAi in mammalian cells. In 2001, the expression of a specific gene was successfully silenced by introducing chemically synthesized siRNA into mammalian cells (Tuschl et al.) These discoveries led to a surge in interest in harnessing RNAi for biomedical research and drug development. Significant developments in siRNA therapies have been made with both organic (carbon based) and inorganic (non-carbon based) nanoparticles, which have been successful in drug delivery to the brain, offering promising methods to deliver therapeutics into human subjects. However, human applications of siRNA have had significant limitations to its success. One of these being off-targeting. There is also a possibility that these therapies can trigger innate immunity. Animal models have not been successful in accurately representing the extent of this response in humans. Hence, studying the effects of siRNA therapies has been a challenge.  

In recent years, siRNA therapies have been approved and new methods have been established to overcome these challenges. There are approved therapies available for commercial use and several currently in the pipeline waiting to get approval.

== Mechanism ==
The mechanism by which natural siRNA causes gene silencing through repression of translation occurs as follows:

# Long dsRNA (which can come from hairpin, complementary RNAs, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases) is cleaved by an endo-ribonuclease called Dicer. Dicer cuts the long dsRNA to form short interfering RNA or siRNA; this is what enables the molecules to form the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC).
# Once siRNA enters the cell it gets incorporated into other proteins to form the RISC.
# Once the siRNA is part of the RISC complex, the siRNA is unwound to form single stranded siRNA.
# The strand that is thermodynamically less stable due to its base pairing at the 5´end is chosen to remain part of the RISC-complex
# The single stranded siRNA which is part of the RISC complex now can scan and find a complementary mRNA
# Once the single stranded siRNA (part of the RISC complex) binds to its target mRNA, it induces mRNA cleavage.
# The mRNA is now cut and recognized as abnormal by the cell. This causes degradation of the mRNA and in turn no translation of the mRNA into amino acids and then proteins. Thus silencing the gene that encodes that mRNA.
siRNA is also similar to miRNA, however, miRNAs are derived from shorter stemloop RNA products. miRNAs typically silence genes by repression of translation and have broader specificity of action, while siRNAs typically work with higher specificity by cleaving the mRNA before translation, with 100% complementarity.

==RNAi induction using siRNAs or their biosynthetic precursors==

Gene knockdown by transfection of exogenous siRNA is often unsatisfactory because the effect is only transient, especially in rapidly dividing cells. This may be overcome by creating an expression vector for the siRNA. The siRNA sequence is modified to introduce a short loop between the two strands. The resulting transcript is a short hairpin RNA (shRNA), which can be processed into a functional siRNA by Dicer in its usual fashion. Typical transcription cassettes use an RNA polymerase III promoter (e.g., U6 or H1) to direct the transcription of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) (U6 is involved in RNA splicing; H1 is the RNase component of human RNase P). It is theorized that the resulting siRNA transcript is then processed by Dicer.

The gene knockdown efficiency can also be improved by using cell squeezing.
The activity of siRNAs in RNAi is largely dependent on its binding ability to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Binding of the duplex siRNA to RISC is followed by unwinding and cleavage of the sense strand with endonucleases. The remaining anti-sense strand-RISC complex can then bind to target mRNAs for initiating transcriptional silencing.

==RNA activation==
It has been found that dsRNA can also activate gene expression, a mechanism that has been termed &quot;small RNA-induced gene activation&quot; or RNAa. It has been shown that dsRNAs targeting gene promoters induce potent transcriptional activation of associated genes. RNAa was demonstrated in human cells using synthetic dsRNAs, termed &quot;small activating RNAs&quot; (saRNAs). It is currently not known how conserved RNAa is in other organisms. One report in the &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; mosquito has shown there is some evidence for RNAa and can be achieved by short or long dsRNAs targeting promoter regions.

== Post-transcriptional gene silencing ==
The siRNA-induced post transcriptional gene silencing is initiated by the assembly of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The complex silences certain gene expression by cleaving the mRNA molecules coding the target genes. To begin the process, one of the two siRNA strands, the guide strand (anti-sense strand), will be loaded into the RISC while the other strand, the passenger strand (sense strand), is degraded. Certain Dicer enzymes may be responsible for loading the guide strand into RISC. Then, the siRNA scans for and directs RISC to perfectly complementary sequence on the mRNA molecules. The cleavage of the mRNA molecules is thought to be catalyzed by the Piwi domain of Argonaute proteins of the RISC. The mRNA molecule is then cut precisely by cleaving the phosphodiester bond between the target nucleotides which are paired to siRNA residues 10 and 11, counting from the 5&#x27;end. This cleavage results in mRNA fragments that are further degraded by cellular exonucleases. The 5&#x27; fragment is degraded from its 3&#x27; end by exosome while the 3&#x27; fragment is degraded from its 5&#x27; end by 5&#x27; -3&#x27; exoribonuclease 1(XRN1). Dissociation of the target mRNA strand from RISC after the cleavage allow more mRNA to be silenced. This dissociation process is likely to be promoted by extrinsic factors driven by ATP hydrolysis.

Sometimes cleavage of the target mRNA molecule does not occur. In some cases, the endonucleolytic cleavage of the phosphodiester backbone may be suppressed by mismatches of siRNA and target mRNA near the cleaving site. Other times, the Argonaute proteins of the RISC lack endonuclease activity even when the target mRNA and siRNA are perfectly paired. In such cases, gene expression will be silenced by an miRNA induced mechanism instead 
Piwi-interacting RNAs are responsible for the silencing of transposons and are not siRNAs. PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a recently-discovered class of small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) with a length of 21-35 nucleotides. They play a role in gene expression regulation, transposon silencing, and viral infection inhibition. Once considered as &quot;dark matter&quot; of ncRNAs, piRNAs emerged as important players in multiple cellular functions in different organisms.

=== Transcriptional Gene Silencing ===
Many model organism, such as plants (Arabidopsis thaliana), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae ), flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and worms (C. elegans), have been used to study small non coding RNA-directed Transcriptional gene silencing. In human cell, RNA-directed transcriptional gene silencing was observed a decade ago when exogenous siRNAs silenced a transgenic elongation factor 1 α promoter driving a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporter gene.
The main mechanisms of transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) involving the RNAi machinery include DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications, and subsequent chromatin remodeling around the target gene into a heterochromatic state.
SiRNAs can be incorporated into a RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex. An active RITS complex will trigger the formation of heterochromatin around DNA matching the siRNA, effectively silencing the genes in that region of the DNA.

==Applications: Allele-specific gene silencing==
One of the potent applications of siRNAs is the ability to distinguish the target versus non-target sequence with a single-nucleotide difference. This approach has been considered as therapeutically crucial for the silencing dominant gain-of-function (GOF) disorders,where mutant allele causing disease is differed from wt-allele by a single nucleotide (nt). These types of siRNAs with the capability to distinguish a single-nt difference, are termed as, allele-specific siRNAs.

ASP-RNAi is an innovative category of RNAi with the objective of suppressing the dominant mutant allele while sparing expression of the corresponding normal allele with the specificity of single-nucleotide differences between the two. ASP-siRNAs are potentially a novel and better remedial alternative for the treatment of autosomal dominant genetic disorders especially in cases where wild-type allele expression is crucial for organism survival such as Huntington disease (HD),DYT1 dystonia (Gonzalez-Alegre et al. 2003, 2005), Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (Sierant et al. 2011), Parkinson&#x27;s disease (PD) (Takahashi et al. 2015), amyloid lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Schwarz et al. 2006), and Machado–Joseph disease (Alves et al. 2008). Their therapeutic potential has also been assessed for various skin disorders like epidermolysis bullosa simplex (Atkinson et al. 2011), epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (EPPK) (Lyu et al. 2016), and lattice corneal dystrophy type I (LCDI) (Courtney et al. 2014).

==Challenges: avoiding nonspecific effects==
RNAi intersects with a number of other pathways; as of 2010 it was not surprising that on occasion, nonspecific effects are triggered by the experimental introduction of an siRNA. When a mammalian cell encounters a double-stranded RNA such as an siRNA, it may mistake it as a viral by-product and mount an immune response. Furthermore, because structurally related microRNAs modulate gene expression largely via incomplete complementarity base pair interactions with a target mRNA, the introduction of an siRNA may cause unintended off-targeting. Chemical modifications of siRNA may alter the thermodynamic properties that also result in a loss of single nucleotide specificity.

===Innate immunity===
Introduction of too many siRNA can result in nonspecific events due to activation of innate immune responses. Most evidence to date suggests that this is probably due to activation of the dsRNA sensor PKR, although retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) may also be involved. The induction of cytokines via toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) has also been described. Chemical modification of siRNA is employed to reduce in the activation of the innate immune response for gene function and therapeutic applications. One promising method of reducing the nonspecific effects is to convert the siRNA into a microRNA. MicroRNAs occur naturally, and by harnessing this endogenous pathway it should be possible to achieve similar gene knockdown at comparatively low concentrations of resulting siRNAs. This should minimize nonspecific effects.

===Off-targeting ===
Off-targeting is another challenge to the use of siRNAs as a gene knockdown tool. Here, genes with incomplete complementarity are inadvertently downregulated by the siRNA (in effect, the siRNA acts as a miRNA), leading to problems in data interpretation and potential toxicity. This, however, can be partly addressed by designing appropriate control experiments, and siRNA design algorithms are currently being developed to produce siRNAs free from off-targeting. Genome-wide expression analysis, e.g., by microarray technology, can then be used to verify this and further refine the algorithms. A 2006 paper from the laboratory of Dr. Khvorova implicates 6- or 7-basepair-long stretches from position 2 onward in the siRNA matching with 3&#x27;UTR regions in off-targeted genes. The tool of siRNA off-target predition is available at http://crdd.osdd.net/servers/aspsirna/asptar.php and published as ASPsiRNA resource.

=== Adaptive immune responses ===
Plain RNAs may be poor immunogens, but antibodies can easily be created against RNA-protein complexes. Many autoimmune diseases see these types of antibodies. There haven&#x27;t yet been reports of antibodies against siRNA bound to proteins. Some methods for siRNA delivery adjoin polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the oligonucleotide reducing excretion and improving circulating half-life. However recently a large Phase III trial of PEGylated RNA aptamer against factor IX had to be discontinued by Regado Biosciences because of a severe anaphylactic reaction to the PEG part of the RNA. This reaction led to death in some cases and raises significant concerns about siRNA delivery when PEGylated oligonucleotides are involved.

=== Saturation of the RNAi machinery ===
siRNAs transfection into cells typically lowers the expression of many genes, however, the upregulation of genes is also observed. The upregulation of gene expression can partially be explained by the predicted gene targets of endogenous miRNAs. Computational analyses of more than 150 siRNA transfection experiments support a model where exogenous siRNAs can saturate the endogenous RNAi machinery, resulting in the de-repression of endogenous miRNA-regulated genes. Thus, while siRNAs can produce unwanted off-target effects, i.e. unintended downregulation of mRNAs via a partial sequence match between the siRNA and target, the saturation of RNAi machinery is another distinct nonspecific effect, which involves the de-repression of miRNA-regulated genes and results in similar problems in data interpretation and potential toxicity.

== Chemical modification ==

siRNAs have been chemically modified to enhance their therapeutic properties, Short interfering RNA (siRNA) must be delivered to the site of action in the cells of target tissues in order for RNAi to fulfill its therapeutic promise. A detailed database of all such chemical modifications is manually curated as siRNAmod in scientific literature. Chemical modification of siRNA can also inadvertently result in loss of single-nucleotide specificity.

==Therapeutic applications and challenges==
Given the ability to knock down, in essence, any gene of interest, RNAi via siRNAs has generated a great deal of interest in both basic and applied biology.

One of the biggest challenges to siRNA and RNAi based therapeutics is intracellular delivery. siRNA also has weak stability and pharmacokinetic behavior. Delivery of siRNA via nanoparticles has shown promise. siRNA oligos in vivo are vulnerable to degradation by plasma and tissue endonucleases and exonucleases and have shown only mild effectiveness in localized delivery sites, such as the human eye. Delivering pure DNA to target organisms is challenging because its large size and structure prevents it from diffusing readily across membranes. siRNA oligos circumvent this problem due to their small size of 21-23 oligos. This allows delivery via nano-scale delivery vehicles called nanovectors.

A good nanovector for siRNA delivery should protect siRNA from degradation, enrich siRNA in the target organ and facilitate the cellular uptake of siRNA. The three main groups of siRNA nanovectors are: lipid based, non-lipid organic-based, and inorganic. Lipid based nanovectors are excellent for delivering siRNA to solid tumors, but other cancers may require different non-lipid based organic nanovectors such as cyclodextrin based nanoparticles.

siRNAs delivered via lipid based nanoparticles have been shown to have therapeutic potential for central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Central nervous disorders are not uncommon, but the blood brain barrier (BBB) often blocks access of potential therapeutics to the brain. siRNAs that target and silence efflux proteins on the BBB surface have been shown to create an increase in BBB permeability. siRNA delivered via lipid based nanoparticles is able to cross the BBB completely.

A huge difficulty in siRNA delivery is the problem of off-targeting. Since genes are read in both directions, there exists a possibility that even if the intended antisense siRNA strand is read and knocks out the target mRNA, the sense siRNA strand may target another protein involved in another function.

Phase I results of the first two therapeutic RNAi trials (indicated for age-related macular degeneration, aka AMD) reported at the end of 2005 that siRNAs are well tolerated and have suitable pharmacokinetic properties.

In a phase 1 clinical trial, 41 patients with advanced cancer metastasised to liver were administered RNAi delivered through lipid nanoparticles. The RNAi targeted two genes encoding key proteins in the growth of the cancer cells, vascular endothelial growth factor, (VEGF), and kinesin spindle protein (KSP). The results showed clinical benefits, with the cancer either stabilized after six months, or regression of metastasis in some of the patients. Pharmacodynamic analysis of biopsy samples from the patients revealed the presence of the RNAi constructs in the samples, proving that the molecules reached the intended target.

Proof of concept trials have indicated that Ebola-targeted siRNAs may be effective as post-exposure prophylaxis in humans, with 100% of non-human primates surviving a lethal dose of Zaire Ebolavirus, the most lethal strain.

=== Legal categorization and legal issues in a near future ===
Currently, SiRNA are currently chemically synthesized and so, are legally categorized inside EU and in USA as simple medicinal products. But as bioengineered siRNA (BERAs) are in development, these would be classified as biological medicinal products, at least in EU. The development of the BERAs technology raises the question of the categorization of drugs having the same mechanism of action but being produced chemically or biologically. This lack of consistency should be addressed.

== Intracellular delivery ==

There is great potential for RNA interference (RNAi) to be used therapeutically to reversibly silence any gene. For RNAi to realize its therapeutic potential, small interfering RNA (siRNA) must be delivered to the site of action in the cells of target tissues. But finding safe and efficient delivery mechanisms is a major obstacle to achieving the full potential of siRNA-based therapies.  Unmodified siRNA is unstable in the bloodstream, has the potential to cause immunogenicity, and has difficulty readily navigating cell membranes. As a result, chemical alterations and/or delivery tools are needed to safely transfer siRNA to its site of action.
There are three main techniques of delivery for siRNA that differ on efficiency and toxicity.

=== Transfection ===
In this technique siRNA first must be designed against the target gene. Once the siRNA is configured against the gene it has to be effectively delivered through a transfection protocol. Delivery is usually done by cationic liposomes, polymer nanoparticles, and lipid conjugation. This method is advantageous because it can deliver siRNA to most types of cells, has high efficiency and reproducibility, and is offered commercially. The most common commercial reagents for transfection of siRNA are Lipofectamine and Neon Transfection. However, it is not compatible with all cell types and has low in vivo efficiency.

=== Electroporation ===

Electrical pulses are also used to intracellularly deliver siRNA into cells. The cell membrane is made of phospholipids which makes it susceptible to an electric field. When quick but powerful electrical pulses are initiated the lipid molecules reorient themselves, while undergoing thermal phase transitions because of heating. This results in the making of hydrophilic pores and localized perturbations in the lipid bilayer cell membrane also causing a temporary loss of semipermeability. This allows for the escape of many intracellular contents, such as ions and metabolites as well as the simultaneous uptake of drugs, molecular probes, and nucleic acids. For cells that are difficult to transfect electroporation is advantageous however cell death is more probable under this technique.

This method has been used to deliver siRNA targeting VEGF into the xenografted tumors in nude mice, which resulted in a significant suppression of tumor growth.

=== Viral-mediated delivery ===
The gene silencing effects of transfected designed siRNA are generally transient, but this difficulty can be overcome through an RNAi approach. Delivering this siRNA from DNA templates can be done through several recombinant viral vectors based on retrovirus, adeno-associated virus, adenovirus, and lentivirus. The latter is the most efficient virus that stably delivers siRNA to target cells as it can transduce nondividing cells as well as directly target the nucleus. These specific viral vectors have been synthesized to effectively facilitate siRNA that is not viable for transfection into cells. Another aspect is that in some cases synthetic viral vectors can integrate siRNA into the cell genome which allows for stable expression of siRNA and long-term gene knockdown. This technique is advantageous because it is in vivo and effective for difficult to transfect cell. However problems arise because it can trigger antiviral responses in some cell types leading to mutagenic and immunogenic effects.

This method has potential use in gene silencing of the central nervous system for the treatment of Huntington&#x27;s disease.

== Therapies ==
A decade after the discovery of RNAi mechanism in 1993, the pharmaceutical sector heavily invested in the research and development of siRNA therapy. There are several advantages that this therapy has over small molecules and antibodies. It can be administered quarterly or every six months. Another advantage is that, unlike small molecule and monoclonal antibodies that need to recognize specific conformation of a protein, siRNA functions by Watson-Crick basepairing with mRNA. Therefore, any target molecule that needs to be treated with high affinity and specificity can be selected if the right nucleotide sequence is available. One of the biggest challenges researchers needed to overcome was the identification and establishment of a delivery system through which the therapies would enter the body. And that the immune system often mistakes the RNAi therapies as remnants of infectious agents, which can trigger an immune response. Animal models did not accurately represent the degree of immune response that was seen in humans and despite the promise in the treatment investors divested away from RNAi.

However, there were a few companies that continued with the development of RNAi therapy for humans. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Sirna Therapeutics and Dicerna Pharmaceuticals are few of the companies still working on bringing RNAi therapies to market. It was learned that almost all siRNA therapies administered in the bloodstream accumulated in the liver. That is why most of the early drug targets were diseases that affected the liver. Repeated developmental work also shed light on improving the chemical composition of the RNA molecule to reduce the immune response, subsequently causing little to no side effects. Listed below are some of approved therapies or therapies in pipeline.

=== Alnylam Pharmaceuticals ===
In 2018, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals became the first company to have a siRNA therapy approved by the FDA. Onpattro (patisiran) was approved for the treatment of polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis in adults. hATTR is a rare, progressively debilitating condition. During hATTR amyloidosis, misfolded transthyretin (TTR) protein is deposited in the extracellular space. Under typical folding conditions, TTR tetramers are made up of four monomers. Hereditary ATTR amyloidosis is caused by a fault or mutation in the transthyretin (TTR) gene which is inherited. Changing just one amino-acid changes the tetrameric transthyretin proteins, resulting in unstable tetrameric transthyretin protein that aggregates in monomers and forms insoluble extracellular amyloid deposits. Amyloid buildup in various organ systems causes cardiomyopathy, polyneuropathy, gastrointestinal dysfunction. It affects 50,000 people worldwide. To deliver the drug directly to the liver, siRNA is encased in a lipid nanoparticle. The siRNA molecule halts the production of amyloid proteins by interfering with the RNA production of abnormal TTR proteins. This prevents the accumulation of these proteins in different organs of the body and helps the patients manage this disease.

Traditionally, liver transplantation has been the standard treatment for hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, however its effectiveness may be limited by the persistent deposition of wild-type transthyretin amyloid after transplantation. There are also small molecule medications that provide temporary relief. Before Onpattro was released, the treatment options for hATTR were limited. After the approval of Onpattro, FDA awarded Alnylam with the Breakthrough Therapy Designation, which is given to drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and are a substantial improvement over any available therapy. It was also awarded Orphan Drug Designations given to those treatments that are intended to safely treat conditions affecting less than 200,000 people.

Along with Onpattro, another RNA interference therapeutic drug has also been discovered (Partisiran) which has property of inhibiting hepatic synthesis of transthyretin. Target messenger RNA (mRNA) is cleaved as a result by tiny interfering RNAs coupled to the RNA-induced silencing complex. Patisiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic drug, uses this process to decrease the production of mutant and wild-type transthyretin by cleaving on 3-untranslated region of transthyretin mRNA.

In 2019, FDA approved the second RNAi therapy, Givlaari (givosiran) used to treat acute hepatic porphyria (AHP). The disease is caused due to the accumulation of toxic porphobilinogen (PBG) molecules which are formed during the production of heme. These molecules accumulate in different organs and this can lead to the symptoms or attacks of AHP.

Givlaari is an siRNA drug that downregulates the expression of aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1), a liver enzyme involved in an early step in heme production. The downregulation of ALAS1 lowers the levels of neurotoxic intermediates that cause AHP symptoms.

Years of research has led to a greater understanding of siRNA therapies beyond those affecting the liver. As of 2019, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals was involved in therapies that may treat amyloidosis and CNS disorders like Huntington&#x27;s disease and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. They have also partnered with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals to develop therapies for CNS, eye and liver diseases.

As of 2020, ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI, were available for commercial application, and two siRNAs, lumasiran (ALN-GO1) and inclisiran, have been submitted for new drug application to the FDA. Several siRNAs are undergoing phase 3 clinical studies, and more candidates are in the early developmental stage. In 2020, Alnylam and Vir pharmaceuticals announced a partnership and have started working on a RNAi therapy that would treat severe cases of COVID-19.

Other companies that have had success in developing a pipeline of siRNA therapies are Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, partnered Eli Lilly and Company and Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals partnered with Johnson and Johnson. Several other big pharmaceutical companies such as Amgen and AstraZeneca have also invested heavily in siRNA therapies as they see the potential success of this area of biological drugs.

<text>Bamyan (), also spelled Bamiyan or Bamian, is the capital of Bamyan Province in central Afghanistan. Its population of approximately 100,000 people makes it the largest city in Hazarajat. Bamyan is at an altitude of about above sea level. The Bamyan Airport is located in the middle of the city. The driving distance between Bamyan and Kabul in the southeast is approximately . The Band-e-Amir National Park is to the west, about a half-hour drive from the city of Bamyan.

Bamyan is referred to by some as the &quot;Shining Light&quot; and &quot;Valley of Gods&quot;. There are several tourist attractions near the city, including the Buddhas of Bamyan, which were carved into cliffs on the north side of Bamyan city in the 6th and 7th centuries CE, dating them to the Hephthalite rule. Other attractions close to the city include Shahr-e Gholghola and Zuhak. In 2008, in a maze of caves in the Bamiyan Valley were found the world&#x27;s oldest oil paintings. At the end of the 10th century, there was a Buddhist culture in which several thousand Buddhist monks lived in caves carved into the mountain. The 53 meters known as the Salsal and 35 meters known as Shahmama are the high-standing Buddha statues and best-known monuments left by the Buddhists, which were destroyed by the Taliban in 2001. Furthermore, there are several cultural sites left from both the Buddhist and the later Islamic era of the valley. After the overthrown of the Taliban from power in 2002, considerable efforts had been made to preserve the cultural monuments in the valley. The city of Bamyan has four districts and a total land area of 3,539 hectares. The total number of dwellings in this city is 4,435.

The Bamyan valley marked the most westerly point of Buddhist expansion and was a crucial hub of trade for much of the second millennium CE. It was a place where East met West and its archaeology reveals a blend of Greek, Turkic, Persian, Chinese, and Indian influences. The valley is one of Afghanistan&#x27;s most touristic places.

The city of Bamyan joined the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a Crafts and Folk Art city in 2017. &quot;UNESCO noted the Bamiyan Valley is the most monumental expression of western Buddhism&quot;. Bamiyan is now listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in Danger.

On 15 August 2021, Bamyan was seized again by Taliban fighters, becoming the twenty-ninth provincial capital to be captured by the Taliban as part of the wider 2021 Taliban offensive.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Bamiyan&quot; is derived from Middle Persian &quot;Bamikan&quot;.

== Geography ==

The 2,500 m high valley is about 230 km northwest of Kabul and separates the Hindu Kush mountain range from the Koh-e Baba mountains. On the north side, there is an approximately 1.5 kilometers long, high, almost vertical sandstone cliff that was formed by a glacier. The Buddha statues and most of the caves in the valley were carved into this rock face. In the valley itself and on the slopes, there are numerous ruins from earlier times.

&quot;Bamiyan is located between the Indian subcontinent (to the southeast) and Central Asia (to the north), which made it an important location close to one of the most important branches of the Silk Route&quot;. Situated on the ancient Silk Route, the town was at the crossroads between the East and West when all trade between China and the Middle East passed through it. The Hunas made it their capital in the 5th century. Because of the cliff of the Buddhas, the ruins of the Monk&#x27;s caves, Shahr-e Gholghola (&#x27;City of Sighs&#x27;, the ruins of an ancient city destroyed by Genghis Khan during the Siege of Bamyan, and its local scenery, it is one of the most visited places in Afghanistan. The Shahr-e Zuhak mound ten miles south of the valley is the site of a citadel that guarded the city, and the ruins of an acropolis could be found there as recently as the 1990s.

The town is the cultural center of the Hazara ethnic group of Afghanistan. Most of the population lives in downtown Bamyan. The valley is cradled between the parallel mountain ranges of the Hindu Kush and the Koh-i-Baba.

Mountains cover ninety percent of the province, and the cold, long winter, lasting for six months, brings temperatures of three to twenty degrees Celsius below zero. Mainly Daizangi Hazara people live in the area. Transportation facilities are increasing, but sparse. Notably, Bamyan is now connected by road to Kabul through Parwan province and Maidan Wardak. The connection between Maidan Shar and Bamyan – 136 km long – makes it possible to reach Kabul in a 2-hour drive. The connection is almost completed missing just 15 km of paving. 
The main crops are wheat, barley, mushung, and baquli, grown in spring. When crops are damaged by unusually harsh weather, residents herd their livestock down to Ghazni and Maidan provinces to exchange for food.

== Climate ==
Bamyan has a cold desert climate (Köppen &quot;BWk&quot;), with cold winters and warm, dry summers. Precipitation mostly falls in late winter and spring

== History ==

The city of Bamyan was part of the Kushan Empire in the early centuries of the Christian era. After the Kushan Empire fell to the Sassanids, Bamyan became part of the Kushansha, vassals to the Sassanids. The Buddhist pilgrim Fa Xian visited Bamyan in the fifth century and recorded that the king summoned the monks of the region for vows and prayers. Fa Xian also records landslides and avalanches in the mountains and the presence of snow during winter and summer. This latter statement suggests climatic change which could have contributed to the historical and economic importance of the area for the years to come. Another Buddhist traveller, Xuanzang, passed through Bamyan in the seventh century. His record shows that the Bamiyan Buddhas and cave monastery near it were already built. He also records that Buddhism in the region was in decay with the people being &quot;hard and uncultivated&quot;.

The Hephthalites conquered Bamyan in the 5th century. After their Khanate was destroyed by the Sassanids and Turks in 565, Bamyan became the capital of the small Kushano-Hephthalite kingdom until 870, when it was conquered by the Saffarids. Favoured by its location on one of the main trade routes from the West to China and India, the valley was of great strategic importance. It became a stop for trade caravans, a well-known artistic site and was also a major Buddhist center for centuries. It later fell to the Ghaznavids in the 11th century. Bamiyan was Islamized under the reign of Sultan Mahmud. This was around the time of the first millennium AD. At that time, the center of the city of Bamiyan was moved from the northwest of the valley, where the cliff with the Buddha statues is located, further to the southeast. Some of the fortifications in the valley also date from this period. During the Ghurids rule, Bamiyan was the capital of a large kingdom for about 60 years, namely from 1155 to 1212, which stretched north to the Oxus River (today&#x27;s Amu Darya). In 1221 the city and its population were said to be completely wiped out by Genghis Khan. It is claimed that he was taking revenge for his slain grandson. Bamiyan was unable to recover from this event for a long time. Even decades later, the city was still devastated, according to a report by a Persian historian. Several decades passed before a town appeared in the valley again, but it could only acquire regional importance. The Qarlughids established their capital in the city soon thereafter. There is some evidence that Bamyan was somewhat populated and reconstructed during the Timurid period in the 15th century.

From the age of the Timurids, there is said to have been a city again in Bamiyan. However, the general decline in coast-to-coast trade during this time meant that the city could no longer grow to its old size and could no longer achieve supra-regional importance.

Bamiyan is also mentioned again in the history books during the Mughal Empire, especially in connection with Aurangzeb, who had the 53 m tall Buddha statue shot at with cannons during his looting.

During the time of the Afghan monarchy, Bamiyan was a bulwark in the central mountain region. At that time, however, the area was still claimed by the Uzbek Miren ruling in the north. They demanded tribute payments, mainly in the form of deliveries from slaves from the Hazara tribes of the surrounding mountains.

In 1840, the region was under conflict because of the First Anglo-Afghan War when the British routed Dost Mohammad Khan and his forces. The first European to see Bamyan was William Moorcroft (explorer) about 1824.
During 1998–2001, Bamyan has been the center of combat between Taliban forces and the anti-Taliban alliance; mainly Hizb-i-Wahdat – amid clashes among the warlords of the local militia. Bamyan is also known as the capital of Daizangi.

=== Buddhas of Bamiyan ===
Ashoka, the ruler of the ancient Indian Maurya dynasty, according to an old inscription, was sent in 261 BC. to convert the area. This was just before the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom declared independence in the northern Hindu Kush region.

Under the rule of the Kushana dynasty, Buddhism gradually established itself in the Hindu Kush area. Between the 2nd and 4th centuries AD, a number of Buddhist sites arose along the trade routes at that. Bamiyan itself was to become the largest and most famous of these Buddhist sites. However, the exact point in time when Buddhism found its way into Bamiyan itself is not known.

This Buddhist art was significantly influenced by the earlier Gandhara culture, which was developed further in the south, and the Indian Gupta culture was the result of this cultural creation being unique of its kind. The Gandhara culture was already in retreat or largely collapsed when Buddhism experienced a revival here.

The two large Buddha statues were constructed on the large rock facing the north side of the valley in the 6th century. Corridors and galleries were carved into the rock around the figures and hundreds of prayer halls and caves were created, some of which were decorated with rich wall paintings.

The number of caves currently present in Bamiyan is estimated to be around 1,000. The time of origin is dated to the period from 450 to 850 AD. Some of the murals have been identified as the oldest known oil paintings in the world, dating to the 7th century. An earlier chronicle estimates the number at 12,000 caves, a number that is exaggerated for the Bamiyan Valley alone, but seems appropriate for the entire region, including around 50 km of surrounding valleys. The oil painting of Bamyan Buddha is related to the 5th to 9th century and those paintings were made of oil, hundreds of years before the technique was &quot;invented&quot; in Europe. The scientists discovered that 12 out of the 50 caves were painted with oil painting technique, using perhaps walnut and poppy seed drying oils.

In late ancient times, the adjoining room was mainly in the hands of tribes who were counted among the Iranian Huns and were in conflict with the Sassanid Empire. After 560, the Gök Turks became the dominant power in Transoxania.

Xuanzang, a Chinese monk, visited the valley around 630 AD and was welcomed by King Bamiyan. He spent around 15 days in the valley and described the Buddha statues present in the valley, as well as the location of some temples, whereby his information was confirmed by science as very exact. Based on further statements by Xuanzang, it is assumed that at least half of the one thousand caves known today must have been inhabited. Almost a hundred years later, in 727, the Korean monk Hyecho (Hui Chao) described Bamiyan as an independent and powerful kingdom, despite the presence of Muslim-Arab troops in the north and south of the region.

On the cliff face of a mountain nearby, three colossal statues were carved 4,000 feet apart. One of them was 175 feet (53 m) high standing statue of Buddha, the world&#x27;s tallest. The ancient statue was carved during the Kushan period in the fifth century. The statues were destroyed by the Taliban in March 2001, on the grounds that they were an affront to Islam. Limited efforts have been made to rebuild them, with negligible success. Destroying two giant Buddhas in Bamyan was one of the spectacular and worst attacks against the cultural art and history of Afghanistan on February 26, 2001. All news had reports about it around the world. It is all about history&#x27;s distorting by the commandant of extremist terrorist clerics of the Taliban.

At one time, two thousand monks meditated in caves among the sandstone cliffs. The caves were also a big tourist attraction before the long series of wars in Afghanistan. The world&#x27;s earliest oil paintings have been discovered in caves behind the destroyed statues. Scientists from the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility have confirmed that the oil paintings, probably of either walnut or poppy seed oil, are present in 12 of the 50 caves dating from the 5th to 9th century. The murals typically have a white base layer of a lead compound, followed by an upper layer of natural or artificial pigments mixed with either resins or walnut or poppy seed drying oils. Possibly, the paintings may be the work of artists who traveled on the Silk Road.

The caves at the base of these statues were used by the Taliban for storing weapons. After the Taliban were driven from the region, civilians made their homes in the caves. Recently, Afghan refugees escaped the persecution of the Taliban regime by hiding in caves in the Bamiyan valley. These refugees discovered a fantastic collection of Buddhist statues as well as jars holding more than ten thousand fragments of ancient Buddhist manuscripts, a large part of which is now in the Schøyen Collection. This has created a sensation among scholars, and the find has been compared with the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls.

From 2003 to 2013, a Provincial Reconstruction Team was based in Bamyan, first manned by U.S. forces, and, since April 2003, by New Zealand Defence Force personnel which made up the Provincial Reconstruction Team. The 34th Division in the area, part of the 4th Corps, was affiliated with Karim Khalili. Bamiyan was one of the first pilot centers for the Afghan New Beginnings Programme of Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration. On 4 July 2004 disarmament began in Bamiyan, and on 15 July 2004 disarmament was continued in Bamiyan including soldiers from the 34th and 35th Divisions of the then Afghan Army, often referred to as the Afghan Military or Militia Forces.

==Demography==
As of 2014, the population of the city of Bamyan is approximately 70,000. The population of the entire Bamiyan province is estimated 425,500.

== Bamyan&#x27;s festivals and bazaars ==

=== Potato flower festival ===
The potato Flower Festival is a famous festival in Bamyan as Agricultural for people which is organized by farmers and government organization and promote local Product. The Potato Flower Festival ( Gol-e- Kachalo in Dari) which celebrated for the first time in 2017 and people make many different foods from only potatoes and music is also part of the Festival. More than 80 percent of the population in Bamyan depends on agriculture products and potato is their main product. Furthermore, Bamyan produces 60 percent of the potatoes in Afghanistan. 

=== Dambura musical festival ===
Dambura is one of the Famous traditional music equipment which is guitar-like is made from mulberry wood, which is popular and largely used by classic singers and folklore, musicians mainly played in central. traditional Dambura festival is held each year in a bid to help improve the tourism industry of Bamyan province.

=== Bamyan art bazaar ===
&quot;Bamyan art bazaar&quot; which made by Afghan women in Bamyan where they display and sell their handicrafts to internal and foreign tourists who visit the province. Carpets, rugs, felts, embroidery, pottery and other local women&#x27;s products can be mostly found in the art market shops. All the sellers are women and the products they sell are either their own or bought from women providing at homes. The city of Bamiyan is the only urban settlement in the entire Bamiyan Province. It became the center of the then-newly created Bamiyan Province in 1964. The city grew rapidly, but at the same time suffered from the lack of a zoning plan. Bamiyan&#x27;s bazaar at that time had around 300 to 400 shops and its market was very busy twice a week.

== Natural beauty of Bamyan ==

Afghanistan established its first national park on April 22, 2009, to promote and protect the natural beauty of a series of intensely blue lakes created by natural dams high in the Hindu Kush. Band-e-Amir is a chain of six lakes in the mountainous desert of central Afghanistan. The lakes formed from mineral-rich water that seeped out of faults and cracks in the rocky landscape. Over time, the water deposited layers of hardened mineral (travertine) that built up into walls that now contain the water. According to the Wildlife Conservation Society, which helped the Afghan government set up the park, Band-e-Amir is one of the few travertine systems in the world. Bamyan Despite being one of the country&#x27;s poorest and least developed regions, Bamiyan remains one of the safest areas of Afghanistan today. For those who helped create the national park in 2009 after decades of delay due to war, the peaceful Band-e-Amir National Park tells an entirely different story of a country whose recent historical narrative has been defined by violence. Band-e-Amir National Park is located in central Afghanistan&#x27;s Bamiyan province, .The WCS, along with a number of international agencies and funding partners including USAID and the United Nations Development Programme, assisted the local Afghan government in helping to establish and manage the park. in Band-e-Amir the deep blue color of the lakes is due to the clarity of the air as well as the purity of the water. The high mineral content of the lakes also causes the intense and varying colors of the lake waters. In addition, Band-e- Amir made from six lakes; Of the six lakes, Band-e Panir is the smallest, with a diameter of approximately 100 m (330 ft). The largest is Band-e Zulfiqar, which measures some 6.5 km (4 mi) in length. The most accessible of the lakes is Band-e-Haibat, literally translated as Dam of Awe.

== Historical sites ==
The numerous remains of monasteries, painted caves, statues and fortifications have been on the UNESCO list of world cultural heritage since 2003. At the same time, they were also entered on the Red List of World Heritage in Danger.

The protected world heritage sites include in detail:

*The famous Bamiyan Buddha statues from the 6th century. Around the niches of the two 53 and 35 meter high, destroyed statues, at least 900 caves are carved into the rock, decorated with frescoes and stucco work.
*The Islamic fortress Schahr-i Suhak about 15 km east of the cliff from the time of the Ghaznavids and the Ghurids (10th to 13th centuries).
*The remains of Qallai Kaphari about 12 km east of the cliff with protective walls, towers, and castles.
*The fortified castle Schahr-e Gholghola on a hill in the middle of the valley (6th to 10th centuries).
*The Kakrak valley about 3 km southeast of the cliff contains over 100 caves from the 6th to 13th centuries, the remains of a 10 meter high Buddha statue and an altar with paintings from the Sassanid Empire.
*The caves in the Foladi Valley about 2 km southwest of the cliff, especially the ornate &quot;Qoul-i Akram&quot; and &quot;Kalai Ghamai caves&quot;.

<doc id="584635" wikidata="Q25228461" url="?curid=584635" title="Verrucomicrobiota">
<text>Verrucomicrobiota is a phylum of Gram-negative bacteria that contains only a few described species. The species identified have been isolated from fresh water, marine and soil environments and human faeces. A number of as-yet uncultivated species have been identified in association with eukaryotic hosts including extrusive explosive ectosymbionts of protists and endosymbionts of nematodes from genus &quot;Xiphinema&quot;, residing in their gametes. The verrucomicrobial bacterium &quot;Akkermansia muciniphila&quot; is a human intestinal symbiotic bacterium that is considered as a promising probiotic.

Verrucomicrobiota are abundant within the environment, though relatively inactive. This phylum is considered to have two sister phyla: Chlamydiota (formerly Chlamydiae) and Lentisphaerota (formerly Lentisphaerae) within the PVC superphylum. The Verrucomicrobiota phylum can be distinguished from neighbouring phyla within the PVC group by the presence of several conserved signature indels (CSIs). These CSIs represent unique, synapomorphic characteristics that suggest common ancestry within Verrucomicrobiota and an independent lineage amidst other bacteria. CSIs have also been found that are shared by Verrucomicrobiota and Chlamydiota exclusively of all other bacteria. These CSIs provide evidence that &quot;Chlamydiota&quot; is the closest relative to &quot;Verrucomicrobiota&quot;, and that they are more closely related to one another than to the &quot;Planctomycetales&quot;.

Verrucomicrobiota might belong in the clade Planctobacteria in the larger clade Gracilicutes.

In 2008, the whole genome of &quot;Methylacidiphilum infernorum&quot; (2.3 Mbp) was published. On the single circular chromosome, 2473 predicted proteins were found, 731 of which had no detectable homologs. These analyses also revealed many possible homologies with Pseudomonadota.

<text>Tenbury Wells (locally Tenbury) is a market town and civil parish in the north-western extremity of the Malvern Hills District of Worcestershire, England. Its northern border adjoins Shropshire and, at the 2021 census jointly with Burford, it had a population of 5,224.

==History==

The history of Tenbury Wells extends as far back as the Iron Age. The town has been described as being the home of the Castle Tump, but the Tump is now in Burford owing to boundary changes. The Tump, possibly the remains of an early Norman motte and bailey castle, can be seen from the main road (A456) but there are no visible remains of the castle that was constructed to defend and control the original River Teme crossing. It has also been described as &quot;... the remains of an 11th-century Norman Castle.&quot;

Originally named &quot;Temettebury&quot;, the town was granted a royal charter to hold a market in 1249. Over time, the name changed to &quot;Tenbury&quot;. A legal record of 1399 mentions a place spelt perhaps as &quot;Temedebury&quot;, which may be a further variation in spelling. Tenbury was in the upper division of Doddingtree Hundred.

The &quot;Wells&quot; element of the name was added following the discovery of mineral springs and wells in the town in the 1840s.

The arrival of the railways was a cause of great celebrations; a breakfast, carnival and ball were organised in Tenbury Wells in 1864 when the town was connected to the Kidderminster line. The name of the railway station, on the former Tenbury &amp; Bewdley Railway, was changed to &quot;Tenbury Wells&quot; in 1912, in an attempt to publicise the mineral water being produced from the wells around the town.

The St Michael and All Angels Choir School devoted to the Anglican choral tradition by Frederick Ouseley closed in 1985, after which the buildings served alternative educational purposes.

For more than 100 years, Tenbury has been well known throughout the country for its winter auctions of holly, mistletoe and other Christmas products. It is also known for its Chinese-gothic Pump Room buildings, built in 1862, which reopened in 2001 following a major restoration. They are now owned by Tenbury Town Council, having been transferred from Malvern Hills District Council in September 2008.

===Kyrewood Priory===
Kyrewood Priory was a small priory which was founded in the 13th century. It was a monastic house of Augustinian canonesses, dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene.

Little is known about the history of Kyrewood Priory, as few records have survived from its time in operation. It is believed to have been founded sometime around the year 1238, likely by the noblewoman Margery de Sapy, who had a manor in the area. The priory was relatively small, with a community of only a few nuns, and it appears to have been financially supported by local landowners.

Despite its small size, Kyrewood Priory was known for its piety and good works in the local community; it attracted several donations of land and money over the years. However, by the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries under King Henry VIII in the 16th century, the priory was in a state of decline and disrepair. In 1536, Kyrewood Priory was dissolved and its lands and buildings were sold off to a local landowner. Today, little remains of the priory except for a few fragments of stonework; the site is privately owned and not open to the public.

==Architecture==
One notable architectural feature in the town is the unique (often described as Chinese-Gothic) Pump Rooms, designed by James Cranston in the 1860s, to house baths where the mineral water was available.

Other notable structures in Tenbury include the parish church of St Mary, with a Norman tower, and a number of monuments.

The part-medieval bridge over the River Teme, linking Tenbury to Burford, was rebuilt by Thomas Telford following flood damage in 1795.

The Grade II-listed Eastham bridge collapsed into the River Teme on 24 May 2016. There were no casualties.

The Victorian workhouse, designed by George Wilkinson, was used as the local council buildings from 1937 until the early 21st century and is currently being converted into residential housing. The Victorian infirmary behind the workhouse was demolished to create car parking for a new Tesco supermarket, which opened on 27 April 2017.

The unique Victorian corrugated iron isolation hospital was demolished on 24 October 2006.

==Geography==
Tenbury Wells lies on the south bank of the River Teme; the river forms the border between Shropshire and Worcestershire. The settlement of Burford lies on the north bank of the river.

===Flooding===
For several centuries, Tenbury has been subject to flooding, most recently in 2007, 2008, 2020 and 2024: 
* The first of these floods, in 2007, was caused by the River Teme and the Kyre Brook bursting their banks. 
* The second was caused by a combination of 15mm (0.59 in) of rain falling in an hour and the town&#x27;s drainage system (much of which was blocked) failing to cope, creating flash flooding. 
* The third flood again involved the River Teme and the Kyre Brook bursting their banks. The 2008 flood damage was caused by a combination of the drainage not having been upgraded since the 2007 floods and the wall on Market Street (which should hold back the Kyre Brook) not having been rebuilt following the 2007 floods. Since then much work has been done in respect of improved drainage and particularly defences in Market Street.
* The River Teme and the Kyre Brook rose in February 2020; houses and shops were again flooded. 
* Storm Bert caused more flooding in November 2024, when the town centre flooded in the matter of minutes after the nearby Kyre Brook rose and caused a wall to collapse.

In December 2024, Jessica Murray, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, asked &quot;Could Tenbury Wells be the first UK town centre abandoned over climate change?&quot;

==Governance==
From 1894 to 1974, it was a rural district, comprising the town itself and villages such as Stoke Bliss, Eastham and Rochford. From 1974, Tenbury was in the District of Leominster until it became part of Malvern Hills District when Leominster District Council was taken over by Herefordshire Council in April 1998.

==Local interest==
===Regal Cinema===

The Regal Cinema on Teme Street in Tenbury Wells opened in 1937. It operated as a commercial cinema, one of six in the Craven Cinemas chain, until the decline of British cinema led to its closure in 1966. Following purchase by Tenbury Town Council to prevent demolition, various volunteer groups have run it.

The Regal has been the subject of a Heritage Lottery Fund supported restoration project. Replicas of the 1930s Mediterranean murals by artist George Legge have been painted around the auditorium; the detailing on the front of the building has been recreated and neon lighting has been erected on the front canopy.

The building, owned by Tenbury Town Council, is now under the management of a trust. Modern equipment now allows the showing of recently released films, live broadcasts and live acts. Paul Daniels was its patron until his death.

In 2016, The Regal was nominated for the &quot;Britain Has Spirit&quot; award.

===Apple and fruit heritage===
Tenbury was also known as &quot;the town in the orchard&quot; owing to the large numbers of fruit orchards of apple trees and also pear, quince and plum trees in the immediate vicinity of the town. This heritage is revisited every October at the Tenbury Applefest.

===Markets===
Until 2018, markets were held on Tuesday mornings, Friday mornings and Saturday mornings in and around the town&#x27;s Round Market building, which was built by James Cranston in 1858.

===Power station shelved===
A proposal to build a biomass power station on a business park failed owing to residents&#x27; concern about the disruption to local businesses during its construction. The proposal continued to attract protests and, in July 2007, a petition against the plans was signed by more than 2,300 people.
In July 2009, it was announced that the £965,000 grant offered to the power station had been withdrawn and the project shelved.

==Education==
For primary education, the town is served by Tenbury CofE Primary School on Bromyard Road. 

Tenbury High Ormiston Academy on Oldwood Road is the main secondary school for the area. The King&#x27;s St Michael&#x27;s College, a private international boarding school, closed in 2020.

==Transport==
Tenbury Wells railway station served the town between 1861 and 1962, on the Tenbury Railway from .

The nearest stations to the town are now at and on the Welsh Marches Line. Transport for Wales operates regular services on the Welsh Marches line between , , , and .

Bus services in the area are operated by Yarranton Brothers, which connect the town with Bewdley, Kidderminster, Ludlow and Worcester.

<text>Toghtua Bukha (; Toγtoγa Buqa; died 1376), also Toqto&#x27;a-Buqa, was a member of the House of Wang of the Goryeo dynasty. He was a grandson of Wang Ko. High-placed in the imperial court, he later became Prince of Shen (瀋王) (Sim Prince) of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty. He was a competitor to King Gongmin who competed for the Goryeo throne.

After his grandfather died, he succeeded his grandfather&#x27;s position as Prince of Shen in 1354. Empress Öljei Khutugh and her son, Crown Prince Ayushiridara (Emperor Zhaozong of Northern Yuan) tried to replace Gongmin of Goryeo because he had exterminated the Ki family in 1356. They tried to install Toghtua Bukha, but was declined. Toghtua Bukha expected Goryeo to welcome him as king&#x27;s death because the king had no legitimate son.

The Yuan dynasty was overthrown by the Ming dynasty in 1368 and King Gongmin kept pro-Ming policies. His assassination in 1374 reignited the race for successor. Yi Inim&#x27;s faction finally installed Wang U as Goryeo king but the Northern Yuan dynasty (rump state of the Yuan dynasty) attempted to appoint Toghtua Bukha. An Sagi (安師琦) also supported him in Goryeo and asked him to return to Goryeo. This group was, however, destroyed by the mainstream faction in 1374. Toghtua Bukha&#x27;s activity during this strife is almost unknown, but he seems to stayed in Naghachu&#x27;s camp in Manchuria and watched for a chance. After his death, the noble title of Prince of Shen was abolished.

<doc id="584651" wikidata="Q2142273" url="?curid=584651" title="Trusted third party">
<text>In cryptography, a trusted third party (TTP) is an entity which facilitates interactions between two parties who both trust the third party; the third party reviews all critical transaction communications between the parties, based on the ease of creating fraudulent digital content. In TTP models, the relying parties use this trust to secure their own interactions. TTPs are common in any number of commercial transactions and in cryptographic digital transactions as well as cryptographic protocols, for example, a certificate authority (CA) would issue a digital certificate to one of the two parties in the next example. The CA then becomes the TTP to that certificate&#x27;s issuance. Likewise transactions that need a third party recordation would also need a third-party repository service of some kind.

&#x27;Trusted&#x27; means that a system needs to be trusted to act in your interests, but it has the option (either at will or involuntarily) to act against your interests. &#x27;Trusted&#x27; also means that there is no way to verify if that system is operating in your interests, hence the need to trust it. Corollary: if a system can be verified to operate in your interests, it would not need your trust. And if it can be shown to operate against your interests one would not use it.

==An example==
Suppose Alice and Bob wish to communicate securely – they may choose to use cryptography. Without ever having met Bob, Alice may need to obtain a key to use to encrypt messages to him. In this case, a TTP is a third party who may have previously seen Bob (in person), or is otherwise willing to vouch for that &quot;this key&quot; (typically in a public key certificate) belongs to the person indicated in that certificate, in this case, Bob. Let&#x27;s call this third person &quot;Trent&quot;. Trent gives Bob&#x27;s key to Alice, who then uses it to send secure messages to Bob. Alice can trust this key to be Bob&#x27;s if she trusts Trent. In such discussions, it is simply assumed that she has valid reasons to do so (of course there is the issue of Alice and Bob being able to properly identify Trent as Trent and not someone impersonating Trent).

==Actual practice==
How to arrange for (trustable) third parties of this type is an unsolved problem. So long as there are motives of greed, politics, revenge, etc., those who perform (or supervise) work done by such an entity will provide potential loopholes through which the necessary trust may leak. The problem, perhaps an unsolvable one, is ancient and notorious. That large impersonal corporations make promises of accuracy in their attestations of the correctness of a claimed public-key-to-user correspondence (e.g., by a certificate authority as a part of a public key infrastructure) changes little. As in many environments, the strength of trust is as weak as its weakest link. When the infrastructure of a &quot;trusted&quot; CA is breached the whole chain of trust is broken. The 2011 incident at CA DigiNotar broke the trust of the Dutch government&#x27;s PKI, and is a textbook example of the weaknesses of the system and the effects of it. As Bruce Schneier has pointed out, after the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures, no third party should in fact ever be trusted.

The PGP cryptosystem includes a variant of the TTP in the form of the web of trust. PGP users digitally sign each other&#x27;s certificates and are instructed to do so only if they are confident the person and the public key belong together. A key signing party is one way of combining a get-together with some certificate signing. Nonetheless, doubt and caution remain sensible as nothing prevents some users from being careless in signing others&#x27; certificates.

Trusting humans, or their organizational creations, can be risky. For example, in financial matters, bonding companies have yet to find a way to avoid losses in the real world.

==Parallels outside cryptography==
Outside cryptography, the law in many places makes provision for trusted third parties upon whose claims one may rely. For instance, a notary public acts as a trusted third party for authenticating or acknowledging signatures on documents. A TTP&#x27;s role in cryptography is much the same, at least in principle. A certificate authority partially fills such a notary function, attesting to the identity of a key&#x27;s owner, but not to whether the party was mentally aware or was apparently free from duress (nor does the certificate authority attest to the date of the signature).

<doc id="584652" wikidata="Q1349847" url="?curid=584652" title="Thermomicrobia">
<text>The Thermomicrobia is a group of thermophilic green non-sulfur bacteria. Based on species &quot;Thermomicrobium roseum&quot; (type species) and &quot;Sphaerobacter thermophilus&quot;, this bacteria class has the following description:

The class Thermomicrobia subdivides into two orders with validly published names: &quot;Thermomicrobiales&quot; and &quot;Sphaerobacterales&quot; . Gram negative. Pleomorphic, non-motile, non-spore-forming rods. Non-sporulating. No diamino acid present. No peptidoglycan in significant amount. Atypical proteinaceous cell walls. Hyper-thermophilic, optimum growth temperature at 70-75 °C. Obligatory aerobic and chemoorganotrophic. 

As thermophilic bacteria, members of this class are usually found in environments which are distant from human activity. However, they have features like improved growth in antibiotics and CO oxidizing activity, making them interesting topics of research (e.g. for biotechnology application).

== History ==
In 1973, a strain of rose-pink thermophilic bacteria was isolated from Toadstool Spring in Yellowstone National Park, which was later named &quot;Thermomicrobium roseum&quot; and proposed as a novel species of the novel genus &quot;Thermomicrobium&quot;. At that time the genus was categorized under family Achromobacteraceae, but it became a distinct phylum by 2001.

In 2004, it was proposed, on the basis of an analysis of genetic affiliations, that the Thermomicrobia should more properly be reclassified as a class belonging to the phylum Chloroflexota (formerly Chloroflexi). The bacteria &quot;Sphaerobacter thermophilus&quot; originally described as an Actinobacteria is now considered a Thermomicrobia. In the same year, another strain of rose-pink thermophilic bacteria was isolated from Yellowstone National Park, which was named &quot;Thermobaculum terrenum&quot;. Later analysis based on genome put this species under Thermomicrobia class. However, the current standing of &quot;Thermobaculum terrenum&quot; is disputed.

In 2012, a thermo-tolerant nitrite-oxidizing bacterium was isolated from a bioreactor, which was named &quot;Nitrolancetus hollandica&quot; and proposed as a novel species later in 2014. While it has nitrite-oxidizing activity, which is unique in the Thermomicrobia class, it is placed under the Thermomicrobia class based on 16s rRNA phylogeny.

In 2014, two thermophilic, Gram-positive, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacteria (strains KI3T and KI4T) isolated from geothermally heated biofilms growing on a tumulus in the Kilauea Iki pit crater on the flank of Kilauea Volcano (Hawai&#x27;i) were proposed as representatives of new species based on 16s rRNA phylogeny. The KI3T strain, later named as &quot;Thermomicrobium carboxidum&quot;, is closely related to &quot;Thermomicrobium roseum&quot;. The KI4T strain, later named as &quot;Thermorudis peleae&quot;, was proposed as a type strain of new genus &quot;Thermorudis&quot;.

In 2015, a thermophilic bacteria strain WKT50.2 isolated from geothermal soil in Waitike (New Zealand) was proposed to be a novel species, later named &quot;Thermorudis pharmacophila&quot;. Phylogenic analysis based on 16s rRNA place it within Thermomicrobia class, as close relative to &quot;Thermorudis peleae&quot;.

== Characteristics ==

=== Living environment ===
Members of the class Thermomicrobia are broadly distributed across a wide range of both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. &quot;Thermomicrobium roseum&quot; was found in geothermally heated hot springs, &quot;Thermorudis pharmacophila&quot; and &quot;Thermobaculum terrenum&quot; from heated soils, and &quot;Thermomicrobium carboxidum&quot; and &quot;Thermorudis peleae&quot; from heated sediments In addition, &quot;Sphaerobacter thermophilus&quot; was found in sewage sludge that went through thermophilic treatment. The common features of their habitats include temperature ranging from around 65~75 °C and a pH around 6.0~8.0 (except for Nitrolancea hollandica which grow around 40 °C).

=== Metabolism ===
Members of Thermomicrobia class have variation in their basic metabolism. &quot;Nitrolancetus hollandica&quot; has nitrifying activity that utilize NO2− as energy source, which is unique in the whole Chloroflexota phylum. &quot;Thermomicrobium spp.&quot; and &quot;Sphaerobacter thermophilus&quot; have constitutive CO oxidizing not found in other species in this class. However, species of this class do share some features, as listed below:

* All members except &quot;Thermobaculum terrenum&quot; have inability to utilize some common monosaccharides (e.g. glucose, fructose, etc.) as sole carbon source&quot;.&quot; The mechanisms behind this inability are currently unknown.

=== Antibiotic resistance ===
Members of Thermomicrobia class exhibit certain level of resistance against metronidazole and/or trimethoprim, which are clinically relevant for humans. &quot;Thermomicrobium carboxidum&quot; and &quot;Thermorudis peleae&quot; show resistance against both of those antibiotics, while &quot;Sphaerobacter thermophilus&quot; shows resistance against only metronidazole. Interestingly, &quot;Thermomicrobium roseum&quot; and &quot;Thermorudis pharmacophila&quot; have an increased growth in both metronidazole and trimethoprim, a rare trait even within antibiotic resistant bacteria. The mechanisms behind are currently undocumented, and further study is required on this topic.

=== Cell envelope structure ===
Members of Thermomicrobia class have various Gram-staining results. &quot;Thermomicrobium roseum&quot;, &quot;Sphaerobacter thermophilus&quot; and &quot;Thermorudis pharmacophila&quot; are reported to be Gram-negative and have a typical layered diderm cell envelope structure. However, their cell envelope composition are atypical compared to typical Gram-negative bacteria. Cell envelope of &quot;Thermomicrobium roseum&quot; lacks significant amount of peptidoglycan, which is fundamental for typical Gram-negative bacteria, while being rich in protein. Membrane lipids of &quot;Thermomicrobium roseum&quot; are mostly long chain diols instead of glycerol-based lipids commonly found in bacteria. The same feature was found in &quot;Sphaerobacter thermophilus&quot; and &quot;Thermorudis pharmacophila.&quot; It was suggested that the high-protein and diol-based lipid composition are responsible for heat resistance of these bacteria.

Meanwhile, other members of Thermomicrobia class are reported to be Gram-positive and have typical monoderm cell envelope. There are some possible explanations of the inconsistency of Gram-staining result within the class. For &quot;Thermorudis pharmacophila&quot;, a possible explanation suggested by Houghton et al. is that it is actually an atypical monoderm bacterium, because its cell envelope contains amino acids usually associated with Gram-positive bacteria, have reaction to KOH, vancomycin and ampicillin, and lacks genes responsible for diderm formation. It is also suggested that further study is required to resolve this problem, since the inconsistent reports of cell envelope structure are found for the whole Chloroflexota phylum.

<text>Tickhill is a market town and civil parish in the City of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England, close to the border with Nottinghamshire. At the 2001 census it had a population of 5,301, reducing to 5,228 at the 2011 Census.
==Geography==
It lies eight miles south of Doncaster, between Maltby and Harworth, on the busy conjunction of the A631 and A60 roads, and adjacent to the A1(M) motorway. It is located at 53° 26&#x27; North, 1° 6&#x27; 40&quot; West, at an elevation of around 20 metres above sea level. The River Torne passes close to the south-east of the town where it is the boundary between South Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire, eventually meeting the River Trent.

Notable buildings in Tickhill include the substantial ruins of Tickhill Castle which contain a private residence leased by the Duchy of Lancaster, St Mary&#x27;s Church – a large 13th-century parish church, the parish room, an old hospital called St Leonard&#x27;s, and the market cross.

==Toponymy==

&quot;Tickhill&quot; is an Old English place-name, meaning either &quot;Hill where young goats are kept&quot; or &quot;Hill of man called Tica&quot;. It is composed of one of either &quot;ticce&quot; (&quot;young goat&quot;) or the name &quot;Tica&quot;, and the word &quot;hyll&quot;. The village was not recorded in the Domesday Book but was recorded as &quot;Tikehill&quot; sometime in the 12th century.

==History==
===William I===
Shortly after the Norman Invasion, William I of England gave the lands around Tickhill to Roger de Busli, who built a castle on a small hill. Richard de Busli, grandson of Roger&#x27;s brother Arnold, co-founded nearby Roche Abbey with Richard FitzTurgis in 1147.

===Middle Ages===
During the Middle Ages, Tickhill was the second most important town, after Doncaster, in what is now South Yorkshire. The Domesday Book lists the settlement under the former estate centre at Dadsley, now lying on the northern edge of the town. Dadsley was served by a church atop All Hallows Hill, which by 1361 had been downgraded to a chapel. Evidence suggests that the chapel was unused after the English Reformation, and was razed in the mid-17th century.

Tickhill&#x27;s eponymous hill was probably the base of what is now the motte of Tickhill Castle. The town grew up around the castle, and St Mary&#x27;s was built soon after to replace All Hallows as the settlement&#x27;s main church.

Initially, Tickhill was one of England&#x27;s most successful new towns. It gained a friary and St Leonard&#x27;s Hospital. The Guild of St Cross was established in the town, and it is believed to have acted as the settlement&#x27;s main governing body. In 1295, Tickhill sent two members to Parliament, but did not do so subsequently.

===Sixteenth century===
As castles declined in importance during the medieval period, so did Tickhill. By the 16th century, only a hall was occupied on the castle site, but the market and an annual fair on St Lawrence&#x27;s Day survived. A little trade was gained from its position on the main road to Bawtry. In 1777, a butter cross was erected in the marketplace in an attempt to revive the weekly market, but this ceased in the 1790s.

Strafforth and Tickhill was one of the wapentakes of the West Riding of Yorkshire. The Tickhill Psalter, an outstanding medieval illuminated manuscript was made in the Worksop Priory Nottinghamshire, is currently on display in New York City. It is named after John de Tickhill, born locally and who was made Prior of Worksop in the 14th century.

The following records from St Mary&#x27;s Church, Tickhill are available at the Doncaster Archives:

* Baptisms 1542–1895
* Marriages 1538–1910
* Burials 1537–1901
* Banns 1798–1838
* Index: Baptisms 1542–1718, 1771–1839 
* Index: Marriages 1538–1677, 1754–1838 
* Index: Burials 1538–1674, 1771–1855 
* Bishop&#x27;s transcripts 1600–1866

===1900s===
The Tickhill and Wadworth railway station was open from 1910 to 1929. There has been much debate whether to reopen this station.

==Castle==
Tickhill Castle was built by Roger de Busli, one of the most powerful of the first wave of Norman magnates who had come to England with William the Conqueror. The castle had an eventful history in national life. It was held for the usurping prince John against his brother King Richard I, when the latter returned from abroad in 1194, after his absence on crusade, was the site of a three-week siege during baronial conflicts in 1322. In the civil war of the 1640s, its importance as a local centre of resistance led to its ‘slighting’ (intentional disabling) by Parliament after the defeat of the royalist forces there in 1648. (Conisbrough, long disused as a fortress by this time, escaped such a fate.)

Today, Tickhill castle remains an impressive ruin, retaining its Norman gatehouse, built in 1129–1130, the foundations of the 11-sided keep (one of only two in the world) on a mound high, built in 1178–9 on the model of the keep at Conisbrough, substantial defensive ditches, some parts of which remain as a moat, and walls enclosing an inner courtyard covering .

===Jubilee Wood===
In 2002 a new public access wood was planted as a Queen&#x27;s Jubilee project. &#x27;Jubilee Wood&#x27; consists of 2002 native trees in 4 acres of land next to the River Torne, south of Tickhill (OS map reference SK 599917).
== Flooding ==
==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire (West). Television signals are received from the Emley Moor TV transmitter. The Belmont TV transmitter can also be received which broadcast BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Yorkshire (East). Local radio stations are BBC Radio Sheffield, Heart Yorkshire, Capital Yorkshire, Hits Radio South Yorkshire, Sine FM, Greatest Hits Radio South Yorkshire, and TX1 Radio. The town is served by local newspaper, &quot;Doncaster Free Press&quot;.

==Notable residents==
* James Burbeary, cricketer
* William de Tickhill, 14th-century civil servant and judge
* Francis Fletcher, late 16th-century Vicar of Tickhill, accompanied Francis Drake on his circumnavigation of the world
* Thomas Milnes, (c. 1810 – 1888), sculptor

<text>The Nogeoldae (&#x27;Old Cathayan&#x27;) is a textbook of colloquial northern Chinese published in Korea in several editions from the 14th to 18th centuries. The book is an important source on both Late Middle Korean and the history of Mandarin Chinese. Later editions were translated into Manchu and Mongolian.

== Contents ==
The word (Korean ; Old Mandarin &quot;Khita&quot;) of the title, like the term &quot;Cathay&quot;, is a transcription of the Mongolian form of &quot;Khitan&quot;, a people who ruled northern China as the Liao dynasty (907–1125).
It became a common name throughout Asia for China and all things Chinese.
Here it means &#x27;Chinese&#x27;.
The word (, Korean , literally &#x27;old&#x27;) had been used as a prefix indicating familiarity (as in modern Standard Chinese) since at least the Tang period.

The book mainly consists of dialogs centered on a journey of a Korean merchant to Beijing, and the Chinese travelers who join him on the way. It opens with the following lines:

After arriving in Beijing, they sell Korean commodities and purchase goods to sell back in Korea. The book concludes with the Korean merchant&#x27;s departure from Beijing.

The book focuses on language used in travel, business, banquets, and medicine. It also contains unique insights into life in Beijing, including the first instance of the word &quot;hutong&quot; (alley).

Later editions are accompanied by Korean-language annotation (諺解 ) interleaved with the text. Below each Chinese character are written two transcriptions in Hangul: a &quot;left reading&quot; taken from the &quot;popular readings&quot; in Shin Suk-ju&#x27;s 1455 dictionary, and a &quot;right reading&quot; reflecting contemporary pronunciation. Each Chinese sentence is followed by a colloquial Korean translation, also written in Hangul.

The text below is from eonhae edition

== Editions ==

Five editions of the book exist, as it was revised over the centuries to follow changes in the northern Chinese vernacular and the Korean language.

The original Chinese edition seems have been written around the middle of the 14th century. The &quot;Nogeoldae&quot; and a similar text, &quot;Bak Tongsa&quot; (&quot;Pak the interpreter&quot;), were very popular, and are mentioned in Korean records of 1426 as required texts for government translators. An early 15th century copy discovered in Daegu in 1998 is believed to be close to the original version. It includes valuable information on the colloquial Old Mandarin of the Yuan dynasty, called &quot;&quot;Han&#x27;er&quot; speech&quot; () in this book.

In 1480, the royal instructor ordered revisions of both textbooks to match the very different Middle Mandarin of the Ming dynasty. A Korean scholar, Choe Sejin, wrote a guidebook based on this edition in 1507–17. This edition is now conventionally called the &quot;Beonyeok Nogeoldae&quot; ( &quot;New Translation of the &#x27;Old Cathayan&#x27;&quot;) to distinguish it from the original. The Korean versions of the dialogs are written in a colloquial style, giving unique insight into Late Middle Korean.

A third edition, the &quot;Nogeoldae eonhae&quot;, was published in 1670 by the Bureau of Interpreters. It has the same Chinese text as the &quot;Beonyeok Nogeoldae&quot;, but the right readings and translations were updated to contemporary Korean.

During the Qing dynasty, the Chinese text was revised again as the &quot;Nogeoldae Sinseok&quot; ( &quot;New edition of the &#x27;Old Cathayan&#x27;&quot;), which was published in 1761. The revision is attributed to one Byeon Hon, who went to Beijing in 1760 with the official delegation. Among the revisions are changing the Chinese name of Korea from (; Korean ) to (; Korean ). A corresponding revised commentary, the &quot;Nogeoldae sinseok eonhae&quot;, was published in 1763 but is no longer extant.

The &quot;Junggan Nogeoldae&quot; ( &quot;Reprinted &#x27;Old Cathayan&#x27;&quot;) appeared in 1795, with a corresponding commentary &quot;Junggan Nogeoldae eonhae&quot;. Its Chinese text is less colloquial than the earlier versions.

== Translations ==

Translations of the &quot;Nogeoldae&quot; into other languages were also published by the Bureau of Interpreters. The &quot;Cheong-eo Nogeoldae&quot; (淸語老乞大 &quot;Manchu &#x27;Old Cathayan&#x27;&quot;) includes Manchu text along with Hangul pronunciation and Korean translations. It was written by Choe Hutaek () and others and published in 1704 and revised in 1765. I Choedae () made a Mongolian edition called the &quot;Mong-eo Nogeoldae&quot; (蒙語老乞大 &quot;Mongolian &#x27;Old Cathayan&#x27;&quot;) that was published in 1741 and revised in 1766 and 1790.
A textbook list included in an edict of 1669 mentions a Japanese translation, but it is no longer extant.

<text>James Daniel Richardson (March 10, 1843 – July 24, 1914) was an American politician and a Democrat from Tennessee for Tennessee&#x27;s 5th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 1885 through 1905.

==Early life and education==
James Daniel Richardson was born in Rutherford County, Tennessee, son of John Watkins and Augusta M. Starnes Richardson. He attended the country schools and Franklin College, near Nashville. He married Alabama Pippen on January 18, 1865, and they had five children, Annie Augusta, Ida Lee, James Daniel, Allie Sue, and John Watkins. Before graduating from college, Richardson enlisted in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War, and served nearly four years. The first year he was a private and the remaining three years as a first lieutenant and the adjutant of the 45th Tennessee Infantry Regiment.

==Career==
Richardson studied law; was admitted to the bar and commenced practice January 1, 1867, in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. He was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives, serving from 1871 to 1873, and then to the Tennessee Senate, serving from 1873 to 1875. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions in 1876, 1896, and 1900, and presided as permanent chairman at the 1900 convention.

Elected as a Democratic to the Forty-ninth and to the nine succeeding Congresses, Richardson served from March 4, 1885, to March 3, 1905. He was among the earliest U.S. House Minority Leaders, holding that position from 1899 to 1903, during the 56th and 57th United States Congresses.

Pursuant to an act of Congress on August 20, 1894, Richardson was charged with compiling the &quot;Messages and Papers of the Presidents,&quot; a multi-volume work including every single important document from the federal Government, from the early days of President Washington through the second administration of Grover Cleveland, plus some papers from the administration of William McKinley.

==Death==
Richardson died on July 24, 1914 (age 71 years, 136 days) in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. He is interred at Evergreen Cemetery.

==Personal life==
James Richardson was a freemason and was raised in Mt. Moriah Lodge 18, in Murfreesboro, on October 12, 1867. He was elected the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Tennessee in 1873. He also became the eleventh Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite&#x27;s Supreme Council for the Southern Jurisdiction. He held this office from 1900 until his death until 1914.

Richardson was also the Provincial Grand Master of the Royal Order of Scotland from 1903 to 1914.

<text>Rolls-Royce Deutschland is a subsidiary of British aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce plc. Its primarily facilities are located at Dahlewitz outside Berlin and Motorenfabrik Oberursel at Oberursel near Frankfurt am Main.

The company was formerly known as BMW Rolls-Royce (BRR), being initially operated as a joint venture company between the German car manufacturer BMW and Rolls-Royce. Early work involved the development and production of the BR700 family of jet engines, launched in 1992. During 1999, it was announced that BMW was to discontinue direct involvement in the venture, leading to Rolls-Royce assuming full control in the following year and to the business being renamed &quot;Rolls-Royce Deutschland&quot;. It has since become the hub for Rolls-Royce Group&#x27;s two-shaft engines, including the Tay, Spey and IAE V2500, along with the Dart turboprop engine.

==History==
The company was established during 1990 as a joint venture, originally known as &quot;BMW Rolls-Royce&quot;, between the German car manufacturer BMW and British aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce plc. The establishment of this venture marked the return of BMW to aero engine manufacturing after the firm had suspended its activities in the sector in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War.

The initial purpose of the venture was to develop and manufacture the BR700 family of jet engines. During 1992, development of this powerplant following a sizable order for 200 engines was secured from its launch customer, Gulfstream Aerospace. It was subsequently adopted on multiple aircraft, such as the Boeing 717 airliner, as well as the Bombardier Global Express and the Gulfstream G550 business jets.
In 1999, it was announced that BMW was seeking to reduce its direct involvement in &quot;BMW Rolls-Royce&quot;. During the following year, Rolls-Royce took full control of the joint venture, leading to it being renamed &quot;Rolls-Royce Deutschland&quot;. BMW maintained a significant stake in parent company Rolls-Royce Plc, being the single largest shareholder in the firm for a number of years. However, BMW opted to sell its remaining shares during 2006, the move representing the company&#x27;s formal exit for the aero engine sector after roughly 90 years of involvement.

Shortly after its rebranding as Rolls-Royce Deutschland, the company was assigned all responsibility for several of Rolls-Royce&#x27;s two-shaft turbofan engines, including the Tay, Spey and IAE V2500, along with the Dart turboprop engine, from the parent company. This redistribution of the work was part of a long-term strategy, allowing the company&#x27;s main facility at Derby to concentrate on the production and development of its three shaft turbofan powerplants, while Rolls-Royce Deutschland&#x27;s Dahlewitz facility is developed into a “centre of excellence” for all two-shaft engines within the group.

Around the time of the take-over, the Rolls-Royce Group was reportedly studying development of a new two-shaft family of engines, ranging from the 7,000 lb-thrust (31 kN) class up to 22,000 lb thrust, to eventually replacement its BR700, Tay and smaller AE 3700 turbofan product lines. This was intended to compete for the next generation of corporate aircraft, regional jets, and small airliners. By 2008, Rolls-Royce was yet to initiate a specific programme; instead, it was reportedly conducting market research via consultations with airlines on their requirements for a future prospective powerplant.

During the 2000s, the subsidiary became involved in the production of the Europrop TP400, the largest turboprop engine developed in Europe, to power the Airbus A400M Atlas, a military transport plane.

By 2005, the larger BR715 model of the BR700 family was being phased out as the only aircraft to have been powered by it, the Boeing 717, was being discontinued due to poor sales. However, the smaller BR710 continues to be produced for the Bombardier Global Express and Gulfstream G550 business jets. Furthermore, other operators were interested in adopting the BR710; China Aviation Industry Corporation I and Rolls-Royce Deutschland were at one point studying its potential use to power China&#x27;s upcoming regional jet, the Comac ARJ21. Development of the improved BR725, which had been selected to power the Gulfstream G650 business jet, was undertaken during the later half of the decade.

<text>Sligo ( ; , meaning &#x27;abounding in shells&#x27;) is a coastal seaport and the county town of County Sligo, Ireland, within the western province of Connacht. With a population of 20,608 in 2022, it is the county&#x27;s largest urban centre (constituting 29.5% of the county&#x27;s population) and the 24th largest in the Republic of Ireland.

Sligo is a commercial and cultural centre situated on the west coast of Ireland. Its surrounding coast and countryside, as well as its connections to the poet W. B. Yeats, have made it a tourist destination.

==History==
===Etymology===
Sligo is the anglicisation of the Irish name &quot;Sligeach&quot;, meaning &quot;abounding in shells&quot; or &quot;shelly place&quot;. It refers to the abundance of shellfish found in the river and its estuary, and from the extensive shell middens in the vicinity. The river now known as the Garavogue (), perhaps meaning &quot;little torrent&quot;, was originally called the Sligeach. It is listed as one of the seven &quot;royal rivers&quot; of Ireland in the ninth century AD tale &quot;The Destruction of Da Dergas Hostel&quot;. The river &quot;Slicech&quot; is also referenced in the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; in 1188.

The Ordnance Survey letters of 1836 state that &quot;cart loads of shells were found underground in many places within the town where houses now stand&quot;. The whole area, from the river estuary at Sligo, around the coast to the river at Ballysadare Bay, is rich in marine resources which were utilised as far back as the Mesolithic period.

===Early history===
The importance of Sligo&#x27;s location in prehistory is demonstrated by the abundance of ancient sites close by and even within the town. For example, Sligo town&#x27;s first roundabout was constructed around a megalithic passage tomb at Abbeyquarter North in Garavogue Villas. This is an outlier of the large group of monuments at Carrowmore on the Cúil Iorra Peninsula on the western outskirts of the town. The area around Sligo town has one of the highest densities of prehistoric archaeological sites in Ireland, and is the only place in which all classes of Irish megalithic monuments are to be found together. Knocknarea mountain, capped by the great cairn of Miosgan Maeve, dominates the skyline to the west of the town. Cairns Hill on the southern edge of the town also has two very large stone cairns.

Excavations for the National Roads Authority (NRA) for the N4 Sligo Inner Relief Road in 2002 revealed an early Neolithic causewayed enclosure. Built around 4000 B.C., the Magheraboy causewayed enclosure is located on high ground overlooking the town from the south. This is the oldest causewayed enclosure so far discovered in Britain or Ireland. It consists of a large area enclosed by a segmented ditch and palisade, and was perhaps an area of commerce and ritual. These monuments are associated with the coming of agriculture and hence the first farmers in Ireland. According to archaeologist Edward Danagher, who excavated the site, &quot;Magheraboy indicates a stable and successful population during the final centuries of the fifth millennium and the first centuries of the fourth millennium BC&quot;.
Danagher&#x27;s work also documented a Bronze Age Henge at Tonafortes (beside the Carraroe roundabout) on the southern outskirts of Sligo town.

Sligo Bay is an ancient natural harbour, being known to Greek, Phoenician and Roman traders as the area is thought by some to be the location marked as the city of Nagnata on Claudius Ptolemy&#x27;s second century A.D. co-ordinate map of the world. During the early medieval period, the site of Sligo was eclipsed by the importance of the great monastery founded by Columcille 5 miles to the north at Drumcliff. By the 12th century, there was a bridge and a small settlement in existence at the site of the present town.

===Medieval history===
The Norman knight Maurice Fitzgerald, the Justiciar of Ireland, is generally credited with the establishment of the medieval European-style town and port of Sligo, building Sligo Castle in 1245. The annalists refer to the town as a &quot;sraidbhaile&quot; (&#x27;street settlement&#x27;) which seems to have consisted of the castle and an attached defensive bawn in the vicinity of Quay street. A Dominican Friary (Blackfriars) was also founded by Maurice Fitzgerald and the King of Connacht, Felim mac Cathal Crobderg Ua Conchobair, in 1253. This was accidentally destroyed by fire in 1414, and was subsequently rebuilt in its present form by Tighernan O’Rourke. Norman hegemony was, however, not destined to last long in Sligo. The Norman advance was halted in Sligo after the battle of Credran Cille in 1257 at Ros Ceite (Rosses Point) between Godfrey O&#x27;Donnell, Lord of Tirconnell, and Maurice Fitzgerald. Both commanders were mortally wounded in single combat. The Norman invasion of Tír Chonaill was abandoned after this. In 1289 a survey indicates there were 180 burgesses in the town. The Normans had laid a foundation that was to last.

The town is unique in Ireland in that it is the only Norman-founded Irish town to have been under almost continuous native Irish control throughout the Medieval period. Despite Anglo-Norman attempts to retake it, it became the administrative centre of the O&#x27;Conor Sligo (O&#x27;Conchobar Sligigh) confederation of Iochtar Connacht (Lower Connacht) by 1315 AD. Also called Clan Aindrias, the O &#x27;Conors were a branch of the O&#x27;Conchobar dynasty of Kings of Connacht. It continued to develop within the túath (Irish territory) of Cairbre Drom Cliabh becoming the effective centre of the confederation of túatha. The other Irish túatha subject to here were Tír Fhíacrach Múaidhe, Luighne Connacht, Tir Olliol and Corann. Throughout this time Sligo was under the system of Fénechus (Brehon) law and was ruled by the Gaelic system of an elected Rí túath (territory king/lord), and an assembly known as an oireacht.

Through competition between Gaelic dynasties for the lucrative port duties of Sligo, the town was burned, sacked or besieged approximately 49 times during the medieval period, according to the annals of Ireland. These raids seem to have had little effect on the development of the town, as by the mid-15th century the town and port had grown in importance. It traded with Galway, Bristol, France and Spain. Amongst the earliest preserved specimens of written English in Connacht is a receipt for 20 marks, dated August 1430, paid by Saunder Lynche and Davy Botyller, to Henry Blake and Walter Blake, customers of &quot;ye King and John Rede, controller of ye porte of Galvy and of Slego&quot;.

Sligo continued under Gaelic control until the late 16th century when, during the Elizabethan conquest, it was selected as the county town for the newly shired County of Sligo. An order was sent by the Elizabethan Government to Sir Nicholas Malby, Knight, wanting him to establish &quot;apt and safe&quot; places for the keeping of the Assizes &amp; Sessions, with walls of lime &amp; stone, in each county of Connacht, &quot;judging that the aptest place be in Sligo, for the County of Sligo…&quot; The walls were never built.

===17th and 18th centuries===

Sligo Abbey, actually a Dominican Friary, although a ruin, is the only medieval building left standing in the town. Much of the structure, including the choir, carved altar (the only one in situ in Ireland) and cloisters, remains. When Sir Frederick Hamilton&#x27;s Parliamentarian soldiers partially sacked Sligo in 1642, the Friary was burned and many friars killed.

During the Williamite War (1689–91) the town was fought over between the Jacobite Irish Army loyal to James II and Williamite forces. Patrick Sarsfield was able to capture the town and repulsed a Williamite attack to retake it; however, Sligo was later surrendered to forces under the command of Arthur Forbes, 1st Earl of Granard.

In 1798, a mixed force of the Limerick Militia, Essex Fencibles and local yeomanry under a Colonel Vereker were defeated at the battle of Carricknagat at Collooney by the combined Irish and French forces under General Humbert. A street in the town is named after the hero of this battle Bartholomew Teeling. The &quot;Lady Erin&quot; monument at Market Cross was erected in 1899 to mark the centenary of the 1798 Rebellion.

===19th century===
The town suffered badly from a cholera outbreak in 1832. Scholars speculate that Bram Stoker, whose mother Charlotte Blake Thornley was probably (there are no records and the family lived in both Sligo and Ballyshannon) born in Sligo in 1818 and experienced the epidemic first hand, was influenced by her stories when he wrote his famous novel, &quot;Dracula&quot;. The family lived on Correction Street in the town. After fleeing to Ballyshannon, Charlotte wrote:


The Great Famine between 1847 and 1851 caused over 30,000 people to emigrate through the port of Sligo. On the Quays, overlooking the Garavogue River, is a cast bronze memorial to the emigrants. This is one of a suite of three sculptures commissioned by the Sligo Famine Commemoration Committee to honour the victims of the Great Famine.

A plaque in the background tells one family&#x27;s sad story:
===20th century===
The early years of the century saw much industrial unrest as workers in the Port of Sligo fought for better pay and conditions. This resulted in two major strikes, in 1912 and, in 1913 the prolonged Sligo dock strike. Both ended in victory for the workers.

Sligo Town was heavily garrisoned by the British Army during the War of Independence. For this reason IRA activity was limited to actions such as harassment, sabotage and jailbreaks. At various times during the war, prominent Republicans were held at the Sligo Gaol. The commander of IRA forces in Sligo was Liam Pilkington.

Arthur Griffith spoke in April 1922 on the corner of O&#x27;Connell Street and Grattan Street. To this day it is known as Griffith&#x27;s Corner.
During the Civil War, Sligo railway station was blown up by Anti-Treaty forces on 10 January 1923.

In 1961, St. John the Baptist&#x27;s Church became a cathedral of the Diocese of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh after St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Elphin was abandoned, being destroyed by a storm four years previously.

==Geography==

Situated on a coastal plain facing the Atlantic Ocean, Sligo is located on low gravel hills on the banks of the Garavogue River between Lough Gill and the estuary of the Garavogue river leading to Sligo Bay. The town is surrounded on three sides by an arc of mountains, with the Ox Mountain ridges of Slieve Daeane and Killery Mountain to the southeast bordering Lough Gill. The flat topped limestone plateaux of Cope&#x27;s, Keelogyboy and Castlegal Mountains to the north and northeast and the singular hill of Knocknarea with its Neolithic cairn to the west and the distinctive high plateau of Benbulben to the north.

Sligo is an important bridging point on the main north–south route between Ulster and Connacht. It is the county town of County Sligo and is in the Barony of Carbury (formerly the Gaelic &quot;túath&quot; of &quot;Cairbre Drom Cliabh&quot;). Sligo is the diocesan seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Elphin. It is in the Church of Ireland Diocese of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh.

County Sligo is one of the counties that make up the province of Connacht. The county is part of the Border Region due to the fact that part of North Sligo is relatively close to &#x27;the Border&#x27;. The Border Region in the Republic of Ireland has a population of over 500,000 people and consists of the counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth and Monaghan.

===Architecture===
The town consists of a medieval core street layout, but with mainly 19th-century buildings, many of which are of architectural merit. The town has a High Street which descends from the south of the town and terminates in a market flare at the Market Cross, a pattern typical of Norman street layouts. Here it meets the east west road leading from the Abbeyquarter on the east side to St. Johns Cathedral to the west. This seems to have been the first street laid out in the town. Burgage plots of Norman origin are also evident in the long narrow property boundaries typical of the centre of the town.

The only surviving medieval building is Sligo Holy Cross Dominican Friary built in 1252. An arched tower and three sided cloister of the Abbey Church still survive. The next oldest extant building is the Cathedral of St Mary the Virgin and St. John the Baptist on John Street. The current building dates from 1730 when it was designed by the German architect Richard Cassels who was visiting to design Hazelwood House. The cathedral contains four memorials to the Pollexfen family, maternal relatives of W. B. Yeats.

In the nineteenth century, Sligo experienced rapid economic growth and therefore architectural change was rapid. This was marked by the erection of many public buildings. These include Sligo Town Hall, designed by William Hague in a Lombardo-Romanesque style. Sligo Courthouse on Teeling street is an asymmetrical Neo-Gothic building designed by Rawson Carroll and built in 1878. The Gilooly Memorial Hall is an austere building on Temple Street built as a memorial to the Temperance campaigner Bishop Gillooly. His statue above the door bears the inscription &quot;Ireland sober, is Ireland free&quot;. The Model School, now the Model Arts &amp; Niland Gallery, was built by James Owen of the Board of Works to provide education to all denominations between 1857 and 1863, it was to serve as a model for other schools throughout the country.

The former Batchelors factory on Deep Water Quay is an industrial building which was built in 1905 as a maize mill and grain silo, and used an innovative construction method invented by François Hennebique in 1892. It is one of the earliest examples of its type in Ireland.

===Climate===

Sligo&#x27;s climate is classified, like all of Ireland, as temperate oceanic. It is characterised by high levels of precipitation and a narrow annual temperature range. The mean yearly temperature is 9.4 degrees Celsius (49 degrees Fahrenheit). The mean January temperature is , while the mean July temperature is . On average, the driest months are April to June while the wettest months are October to January.

Rainfall averages 1131 mm (44.5 in) per year. The high rainfall means Sligo is in the temperate rainforest biome, examples of which exist around Lough Gill. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Ireland was −19.1 °C (−2.4 °F) at Markree Castle, County Sligo, on 16 January 1881.


==Demographics==
Sligo had a population of 19,199 in 2016 and 20,608 in 2022, a growth of 7.3% according to the census.

From the 2022 population, 9,969 were males and 10,639 females. Irish citizens made up 79.6% of the population with Polish (542 persons or 2.6%), British (311, 1.5%) and Indian (255, 1.2%) as the next largest declared citizenships. People from other EU countries (674, 3.3%) and those from elsewhere outside the EU (978, 4.7%) were also noted.

6,522 persons could speak the Irish language. 3,410 persons spoke a language other than Irish or English at home and, of these, Polish was the most common foreign language spoken at home, with 744 speakers.

==Religion==

In the 2022 census, 13,226 residents (64.2%) identified their religion as Roman Catholic or Lapsed (Roman) Catholic. A further 791 (3.8%) identified as Islamic, 469 (2.3%) as Church of Ireland, Church of England, Anglican or Episcopalian and 242 as Orthodox (Greek, Coptic or Russian). 3,100 persons (15.0%) indicated that they had no religion, and a further 1,937 (9.4%) did not state any religion.

Sligo is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Elphin. The main church of the diocese is the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception which is located on Temple Street. Other Catholic churches in the town are St. Anne&#x27;s Church, Cranmore and St. Joseph&#x27;s Church, Ballytivnan.

The town is also part of the Church of Ireland United Diocese of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh. The primary church in the diocese is the St John the Baptist Cathedral, Sligo which is located on John Street. Sligo Presbyterian Church is located on Church Street and Sligo Methodist Church is located on Wine Street. There is also a small Baptist church at Cartron Village, Rosses Point Road.

The Sligo-Leitrim Islamic Cultural Centre (SLICC) is located on Mail Coach Road. The Indian Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church meets at the St. Johns Hospital Chapel, Benbullen Rehabilitation Unit, Ballytivan.

==Economy==
Sligo is in the Northern and Western Region, a NUTS 2 region classified as an underdeveloped &quot;region in transition&quot; by the EU Commission. This is an area where GDP is from 75% to 90% of the EU average. It is entitled to funding from European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) Operational Programmes, which are administered by the Northern and Western Regional Assembly. Sligo Town is part of the NUTS 3 Border Region, which recognises that part of north County Sligo is relatively close to the border with Northern Ireland. A study by the European Committee of the Regions found that the Border Region was the most exposed in Europe to the economic effects of Brexit.

Sligo is a major services and shopping centre within this region. As of 2016 the service sector is the primary employment sector in the county, employing 18,760 (71.7%) of workforce. Industry and construction makes up 17% (4,427) of employment, and agriculture, forestry and fishing 7.2% (1,868). The total number employed is 26,002. 3,843 people are employed in agency assisted (IDA) companies. Sligo borough labour catchment as of 2016 is 21,824. 92% of enterprises in Sligo are micro-enterprises of 10 or fewer employees.

Sligo has traditionally been a centre for the tool-making industry.

The pharmaceutical industry is significant with several companies producing goods for this sector, including Abbott (Ireland) Ltd, which is among the largest employers in Sligo.

Development has occurred along the River Garavogue with the regeneration of J.F.K. Parade (2000), Rockwood Parade (1993–1997), and The Riverside (1997–2006), as well as two new footbridges over the river, one on Rockwood Parade (1996) and one on The Riverside (1999). Sligo has a variety of independent shops and shopping malls. There is a retail park in Carraroe, on the outskirts of Sligo.

==Culture==
The culture of County Sligo, especially of North Sligo, was an inspiration on both poet and Nobel laureate W. B. Yeats and his brother, the artist and illustrator Jack Butler Yeats. A collection of Jack B. Yeats&#x27;s art is housed in The Niland Gallery, part of the Model centre on The Mall in Sligo. The Yeats Summer School takes place every year in the town.

Sligo town has connections with &quot;Goon Show&quot; star and writer Spike Milligan, whose father was from Sligo, and a plaque was unveiled at the former Milligan family home on Sligo&#x27;s Holborn Street.

=== Traditional Irish music ===

Traditional Irish music sessions are held in several venues in the town.

In the early 13th century, the poet and crusader Muireadhach Albanach Ó Dálaigh kept a school of poetry at Lissadell north of Sligo town. He was &quot;Ollamh Fileadh&quot; (High Poet) to the Ó Domhnaill kings of Tír Chonaill. The school appears to have been dissolved after the Norman invasion. In the 16th century, the poet Tadhg Dall Ó hÚigínn wrote many praise poems in strict &quot;Dán Díreach&quot; metre for local chiefs and patrons such as the O&#x27;Conor Sligo. He was killed for a satire he wrote on the O&#x27;Haras. The annals record the death in 1561 of Naisse mac Cithruadh, the &quot;most eminent musician that was in Éireann&quot;, by drowning on Lough Gill.

In the 17th century, two brothers from County Sligo, Thomas and William Connellan from Cloonamahon, were among the last of the great Irish bards and harpists. Thomas is the author of the tune &quot;Molly MacAlpin&quot;, now known as &quot;Carolan&#x27;s Dream&quot;, and William may have written &quot;Love is a Tormenting Pain&quot; and &quot;Killiecrankie&quot;.

Traditional musicians from Sligo active in the early 20th century include Michael Coleman, James Morrison and Paddy Killoran.

===Festivals===
Sligo hosts several festivals throughout the year, including Sligo Live, occurring every October; the Sligo Summer Festival, which celebrated the 400th anniversary of Sligo town; and the Fleadh Cheoil, which the town hosted in three consecutive years (1989, 1990 and 1991) and again in 2014 and 2015. Approximately 400,000 people attended the 2014 and 2015 festivals. During the festival, much of the music was played by musicians on the streets of Sligo.

The Sligo Jazz Project is held every July. Another annual festival, the Sligo Festival of Baroque Music, was started in 1995 and takes place on the last weekend of September.

===Theatre===
Sligo also has a tradition of theatre, both professional and amateur. Sligo has had a theatre at least as far back as 1750, according to Wood-Martins’ &quot;History of Sligo&quot;, and often &quot;her Majesty&#x27;s servants from the Theatre Royal, Crow Street …. visited Sligo, even during the Dublin season, showing that in those days the townsfolk appreciated the Drama, for in some instances the company remained during several months&quot;.

There are now two full-time theatres in the town, including the Blue Raincoat Theatre Company, was founded in 1990 and based in Quay street. Sligo is also home to Hawk&#x27;s Well Theatre, a 340-seat theatre founded in 1982.

===In media===
Sligo is the setting for author Declan Burke&#x27;s series of hard boiled detective novels, featuring detective Harry Rigby.

Sebastian Barry&#x27;s novels &quot;The Secret Scripture&quot; and &quot;The Whereabouts of Eneas McNulty&quot; are also set in Sligo town.

Sligo is the setting for John Michael McDonagh&#x27;s 2014 darkly comedic drama film &quot;Calvary&quot;, in which a priest continues to serve his parishioners despite their increased hostility towards him and the Catholic Church.

Together with Dublin, County Sligo is one of the two main settings for Sally Rooney&#x27;s 2018 novel, &quot;Normal People&quot;. A 2020 adaptation made by BBC Three and Hulu was partially filmed in Sligo.

==Sport==
===Football===
The town is home to League of Ireland Premier Division champions Sligo Rovers, who have played home matches at The Showgrounds since they were founded in 1928.

There are also a number of junior association football (soccer) clubs who play in the Sligo/Leitrim &amp; District league from the town. These include Calry Bohemians, Cartron United, City United &amp; St. John&#x27;s FC who play in the Super League and Glenview Stars, MCR FC, Merville United &amp; Swagman Wanderers who play in the Premier League.

===Gaelic games===
There are three GAA clubs located in and around the town, including Calry/St. Joseph&#x27;s of Hazelwood, St John&#x27;s of Cuilbeg and St Mary&#x27;s of Ballydoogan with Coolera/Strandhill of Ransboro and Drumcliffe/Rosses Point GAA also being close by. Calry/St Joseph&#x27;s and St Mary&#x27;s compete in the Sligo Senior Football Championship while St John&#x27;s compete in the Sligo Intermediate Football Championship. Calry/St Joseph&#x27;s also compete in the Sligo Senior Hurling Championship. These clubs also field Junior, Ladies, Minor and Underage teams. Many of the major Gaelic football and hurling matches, such as the inter-county home games of Sligo or a club championship finals, take place at Markievicz Park.

===Rugby===
Sligo RFC is situated at Hamilton Park, Strandhill, 8 km west of the town. This club participates in the Ulster Bank All-Ireland League Division 2B.

===Other sports===
Sligo (in particular Strandhill) is a location for surfing, and there are several surf schools in the area.

There are two nearby golf courses, County Sligo (Rosses Point) Golf Club and Strandhill Golf Club. Also just north of the borough boundary at Lisnalurg, there is Pitch and Putt called Bertie&#x27;s. Rosses Point hosted the West of Ireland Championship in which future golfing star Rory McIlroy won in consecutive years (2005 and 2006).

Two basketball clubs are based in the town. These are Sligo All-Stars (located at the Mercy College Gymnasium) and Sligo Giant Warriors (whose venue is the Sligo Grammar Gymnasium).

Sligo Racecourse at Cleveragh hosts race days at least 8 times per year.

==Administration==

Sligo was administered by its own local oireachtas and the kings of Cáirbre Drom Cliab until the English conquest in the early 17th century. This territory corresponds closely to the newly created Sligo Borough District.

Sligo town then became an incorporated municipal borough with a Royal charter issued by the British King James I between 1613 and 1614. Sligo has had a mayor since incorporation in 1613. It had the right to elect 12 burgesses to the corporation. It was one of ten boroughs retained under the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840. Under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, the area became an urban district, while retaining the style of a borough corporation.

Sligo Borough Corporation became a borough council in 2002. On 1 June 2014, the borough council was dissolved and administration of the town was amalgamated with the Sligo County Council. It retains the right to be described as a borough. The chair of the borough district uses the title of mayor, rather than Cathaoirleach.

As of the 2019 Sligo County Council election, the borough district of Sligo contains the local electoral area of Sligo–Strandhill, electing 10 seats to the council.

===Law enforcement===

From its foundation in the 13th century, Sligo was administered under local Fénechus (Brehon law) until the establishment of English Common law in the early 17th century after the battle of Kinsale. Courts were held regularly throughout the tuath at various buildings and on hilltops reserved for the purpose. Law enforcement was a function of the nobility and freemen of the area as no police force existed. No records survive from these early courts, but a case is recorded of a Dublin merchant being reimbursed by the local courts after he was fraudulently sold an out of date poem in the 1540s. Sligo then came under English martial law and eventually the common law as administered from Dublin and from which descends the present system.

The modern Sligo Courthouse was built in 1878. It hosts regular District and Circuit Court sittings throughout the year, and occasionally the High Court.

After 1922 the establishment of Garda Síochána.

Sligo-Leitrim divisional headquarters of the Garda Síochána is on Pearse Road in the town on the site of the old RIC barracks.

===Health services===
Sligo provides hospital services to much of the North Western region. The two main hospitals are Sligo University Hospital (formerly General and Regional) and St. John&#x27;s Community Hospital. There is also a private hospital at Garden Hill.

==Education==
As of 2016, 14.2 per cent of adults were educated to at most primary level only; a further 45.1 per cent attained second level while 40.7 per cent were educated to third level.

There are five secondary schools in Sligo. These are two all-girls schools (Mercy College and Ursuline College), one all-boys (Summerhill College) and two mixed (Sligo Grammar School and Ballinode Community College).

Sligo has a campus of Atlantic Technological University (ATU) located in Ash Lane. The university was formed in 2022 through the merger of: the Institute of Technology, Sligo (ITS); Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT) and Letterkenny Institute of Technology (LYIT). It offers courses in the disciplines of business, engineering, humanities and science.

St. Angela&#x27;s College (outside the town proper) is a campus of the Atlantic Technological University, and offers courses in nursing and health studies, home economics and education.

==Transportation==

===Road===
The main roads to Sligo are the N4 to Dublin, the N17 to Galway, the N15 to Lifford, County Donegal; and the N16 to Blacklion, County Cavan. The section of the N4 road between Sligo and Collooney is a dual carriageway. The first phase of this road was completed in January 1998, bypassing the towns of Collooney and Ballysadare. An extension to this road was completed in September 2005, and is known as the Sligo Inner Relief Road.

O&#x27;Connell Street – the main street in the town – was pedestrianised on 15 August 2006. Plans for the proposed redevelopment and paving of this street were publicly unveiled on 23 July 2008 in &quot;The Sligo Champion&quot;. The newspaper later revealed that people were not in favour of the pedestrianisation of the street. The street was reopened to traffic in December 2009.

Sligo has a certain amount of cycleways in proximity to the town and various road traffic calming measures have been installed helping to improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists. The &quot;Urban Cycle Sligo&quot; initiative, for example, created six cycle routes.

===Rail===
Sligo acquired a rail link to Dublin on 3 December 1862, with the opening of Sligo railway station. Connections to Enniskillen and the north followed in 1881 and Limerick and the south in 1895. The line to Enniskillen closed in 1957 and passenger services to Galway-Ennis-Limerick closed in 1963. For many years Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ) kept the latter line open for freight traffic, before its full closure. The proposed Western Rail Corridor redevelopment project seeks to reopen it. In 1966 Sligo railway station was renamed Sligo Mac Diarmada Station after Irish rebel Seán Mac Diarmada from County Leitrim. Irish Rail, the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s state railway operator, runs inter-city rail services on the Dublin-Sligo railway line. There are currently up to eight trains daily each way between Sligo and Dublin Connolly, with a frequency of every two hours.

===Air===
Sligo and County Sligo are served by Sligo Airport, from Sligo town and near Strandhill, though no scheduled flights operate out of the airport. The nearest airport with scheduled flights is Ireland West Airport near to Charlestown, County Mayo, away.

The Irish Coast Guard Helicopter Search &amp; Rescue has been based at Sligo Airport since 2004, callsign Rescue 118. CHC Ireland provide 24 hour search and rescue using a Sikorsky S-92 helicopter.

The helicopter is operated by a crew of four, maintained and supported year round. The most northerly base in Ireland, it deals with the stern challenges posed by the Atlantic Ocean and the clifftop environment along the north-west coast.

===Bus===
Bus Éireann operates four bus routes in the town: one serves the town centre and another the west of the town. The other two routes run from the town to Strandhill and Rosses Point respectively. Bus Éireann also provides inter-city services to: Enniskillen, via Manorhamilton; to Derry; to Galway, via Ireland West Airport; and to Dublin, via Dublin Airport and towns along the N4 road.

Bus Feda operates a route from Gweedore, County Donegal, via Sligo to Galway.

===Sligo Port===

Sligo is one of just two operating ports on Ireland&#x27;s northwest coast between Galway and Derry, the other being Killybegs. The harbour can accommodate ships with a maximum draft of and a maximum length of ; the Port of Sligo extends from the Timber Jetty for a distance of .

The Harbour Commissioners of Sligo administered the port from 1877 until Sligo County Council took over responsibility for the Harbour from Sligo Harbour Commissioners in June 2006.

Records show the development of Sligo&#x27;s port, exporting agricultural goods to Britain and Europe, in the 13th century with the arrival of the Normans. In 1420 port dues were levied for the first time. Later, as a port under Gaelic lords the harbour continued to flourish. Control of the taxes or &quot;cocket&quot; of Sligo port became a sought after prize of local dynasties. Native merchant families, like the O&#x27;Creans wine importers being the most well known. Sligo traded with France, Spain and Portugal throughout the Middle Ages.

After incorporation into the British Empire from 1607 onward Sligo was an important port. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the port was used for the transit of significant quantities of cattle, hides, butter, barley, oats, and oatmeal being exported and with the city&#x27;s linen exports well established. Imports included wood, iron, maize and coal. The town prospered due to the trade with wealthy merchants setting up homes along the then fashionable Castle Street and Radcliffe Street (later renamed Grattan Street).

During the time of the Great Famine 1847–1850, it is estimated that more than 30,000 people emigrated through Sligo Port, mainly to Canada and the United States.

The most notable ship companies to operate out of Sligo included Sligo Steam Navigation Company who introduced the first steamer in 1857, Messrs Middleton &amp; Pollexfen, Harper Cambell Ltd and the former Sligo Harbour Commissioners who owned a number of dredgers used for maintenance of the Channel (McTernan, 1992).

Linen was a major export also through Sligo port, with Pernmill road memorialising the linen textile mills.
The Sligo docks played an important role in the history of the labour movement in Ireland. The 1913 Sligo Dock strike lasted for 56 days and was a precursor to the Dublin Lockout that occurred 6 months later. Unlike the Dublin Lockout, the Sligo Dock strike resulted in victory to the workers.

The port of Sligo declined during the 20th century with the decline of sail and steamships and the increasing size of cargo vessels. In modern times, the port handles cargoes of coal, timber, fish meal and scrap metal and around 25 ships per year dock in the harbour. In 2012 a feasibility study was undertaken into the dredging of the shipping channel.

==Media==
There are three local newspapers in Sligo: The &quot;Sligo Weekender&quot; – out every Thursday (formerly Tuesday); the free &quot;Northwest Express&quot; – out the first Thursday of each month; and &quot;The Sligo Champion&quot; – out every Tuesday (formerly Wednesday). &quot;Sligo Now&quot; is a monthly entertainment guide for the town, while &quot;Sligo Sport&quot; is a monthly sports-specific newspaper.

The town has two local/regional radio stations: Ocean FM, which broadcasts throughout County Sligo and parts of some bordering counties; and West youth radio station i102-104FM, which merged with its sister station i105-107FM in 2011 to create iRadio.
