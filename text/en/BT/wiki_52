<text>The Crisis is the official magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). It was founded in 1910 by W. E. B. Du Bois (editor), Oswald Garrison Villard, J. Max Barber, Charles Edward Russell, Kelly Miller, William Stanley Braithwaite, and Mary Dunlop Maclean. &quot;The Crisis&quot; has been in continuous print since 1910, and it is the oldest Black-oriented magazine in the world. Today, &quot;The Crisis&quot; is &quot;a quarterly journal of civil rights, history, politics and culture and seeks to educate and challenge its readers about issues that continue to plague African Americans and other communities of color.&quot;

==History==

=== The Du Bois era ===

==== Beginnings and the Du Bois era ====
The original title of the magazine was The CRISIS: A Record of The Darker Races. The magazine&#x27;s name was inspired by James Russell Lowell&#x27;s 1845 poem, &quot;The Present Crisis&quot;. The suggestion to name the magazine after the poem came from one of the NAACP co-founders and noted white abolitionist Mary White Ovington. The first issue was typed and arranged by NAACP secretary Richetta Randolph Wallace.

As the founding editor of &quot;The Crisis&quot;, Du Bois proclaimed his intentions in his first editorial:

The object of this publication is to set forth those facts and arguments which show the danger of race prejudice, particularly as manifested today toward colored people. It takes its name from the fact that the editors believe that this is a critical time in the history of the advancement of men. ...Finally, its editorial page will stand for the rights of men, irrespective of color or race, for the highest ideals of American democracy, and for reasonable but earnest and persistent attempts to gain these rights and realize these ideals.&quot; (&quot;The Crisis&quot;, November 1910, 10)

Although &quot;The Crisis&quot; was officially an organ of the NAACP, Du Bois had a large degree of control over the periodical&#x27;s expressed opinion. Du Bois wrote in &quot;Dusk of Dawn&quot; (1940) that he intended for &quot;The Crisis&quot; to represent his personal opinions:

I determine to make the opinion of the &quot;Crisis&quot; a personal opinion; because, as I argued, no organization can express definite and clear cut opinions... the &quot;Crisis&quot; would state openly the opinion of its editor, so long, of course, as that opinion was in general agreement with that of the organization.

==== Affiliation with the NAACP ====
The NAACP was founded in response to the Springfield Race Riots of Illinois in 1908, calling attention to the injustices that the black community was subjected to. After this riot, William Walling composed an article in the newspaper, prompting his audience to fight racism in a united fashion. Oswald Villard responded to Walling&#x27;s article in one of his own titled &quot;The Call&quot;, an article welcoming individuals to attend a national meeting dedicated to intersectional justice for all citizens despite race. There were 60 individuals that attended the call, seven of them were persons of color, including Mary Church Terrell, Ida B. Wells, and W. E. B. Du Bois. This meeting and signing of the call led to the formation of the NAACP in 1909.

The NAACP was largely recognized as a grassroots foundation, as it relied on the surrounding to community to sell subscriptions to the magazine, &quot;The Crisis&quot;. In its first year, the journal had a monthly circulation of 1,000. Ten years later, by 1918, it had more than 100,000 readers. It also grew in size, beginning at 20 pages and rising to as many as 68 pages; and in price, beginning at 10 cents per issue and later increasing to 15 cents. &quot;The Crisis&quot; would go on to become incredibly influential during the 1910s and 1920s and would take a large role in the Harlem Renaissance literature movement.

==== Literary and artistic impact during the Harlem Renaissance ====
While the magazine was originally intended to be much more of a political and news publication than a literary publication, it had undeniable impact on the Harlem Renaissance literary and arts movement during the 1920s, especially from 1918 to 1926 when Jessie Redmon Fauset served as Literary Editor.

It was primarily during Jessie Fauset&#x27;s tenure that literature abounded. Though not nearly as well-known today as Du Bois, Fauset&#x27;s literary contributions were equal in importance. The poet Langston Hughes described Fauset as one of the &quot;midwives of the Harlem Renaissance. Hughes wrote in his 1940 autobiography &quot;The Big Sea&quot; that the parties at Fauset&#x27;s Harlem home were rather exclusive &quot;literary soirees with much poetry but little to drink&quot; (Hughes 244).

Some of the best-known writers of the Harlem Renaissance were first published or became well known by being published in &quot;The Crisis&quot; during Fauset&#x27;s tenure, including Hughes, Countee Cullen, Arthur Huff Fauset (Jessie Fauset&#x27;s younger half-brother), Jean Toomer, James Weldon Johnson, Claude McKay, Effie Lee Newsome, Zora Neale Hurston, Gwendolyn Bennett, Arna Bontemps, Charles Chesnutt, Marita Bonner, and Walter White. Despite Fauset&#x27;s personal tastes and interests in her own writing, she featured poetry, prose, short stories, essays and plays in &quot;The Crisis&quot;. Fauset was also the primary force that kept the New York office going logistically between 1919 and 1926. Following her departure from &quot;The Crisis&quot;, the quality and quantity of the literature section of the magazine declined. In her biography of Fauset, &quot;Jessie Redmon Fauset, Black American Writer&quot;, Carolyn Wedin Sylvander writes that after Fauset&#x27;s departure, several poets criticized Du Bois for neglecting literature, printing pieces the poets had specifically requested not be published, or printing old pieces.

In addition to literature, art played an important role in &quot;The Crisis&quot;″s overall message and function. In his famous October 1926 essay &quot;Criteria of Negro Art&quot;, which was delivered as an address at the Chicago conference of the NAACP in 1926, Du Bois stated one of his opinions on art:

Thus all art is propaganda and ever must be, despite the wailing of the purists. I stand in utter shamelessness and say that whatever art I have for writing has been used always for propaganda for gaining the right of black folk to love and enjoy. I do not care a damn for any art that is not used for propaganda. But I do care when propaganda is confined to one side while the other is stripped and silent.

This essay was published in conjunction with a seven-part series of responses to a symposium called &quot;The Negro in Art: How Shall He Be Portrayed?&quot;, which invited responses by black and white artists and intellectuals to seven questions on the freedoms and responsibilities of black artists.

In pursuing the use of art to positively portray the African-American race, Du Bois turned to photography as a favored medium. In &quot;Protest and Propaganda&quot;, Amy Helene Kirschke wrote: &quot;Du Bois believed that art was in fact the embodiment of freedom of expression and that through art, truth could be expressed, creating something beautiful. Through the inclusion of art and poetry, creative writing, and photography, &quot;The Crisis&quot; could bring beauty into the home&quot; (123). The arts were also used to capture current events. Political cartoons, illustrations and graphic photographs aligned with Du Bois&#x27; strong interest in social justice and in highlighting heinous crimes being committed against African Americans.

==== Educational impact under Du Bois ====
&quot;The Crisis&quot; magazine has played a major role in promoting the rise of African-American colleges and the rise of African-American studies. Early on, the magazine fostered an interest in higher education, reporting how the black universities were operating financially and administratively and on the hardships these colleges endured.

Children and education were two topics that mattered quite a bit to Du Bois, whose philosophy during that era was that a &quot;Talented Tenth&quot; of the African-American population should be bred, raised and trained to become elite intellectual and political leaders – a topic he first introduced in his 1903 book &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot;. Readers could see this reflected in the annual Children&#x27;s and Education numbers, which came out in October and July, respectively, and which leaned heavily on photography as a medium for showing off the best of the best of African-American youth.

Fauset, who contributed articles to &quot;Crisis&quot; long before becoming the literary editor in 1918, also seemed to care deeply about children&#x27;s literature, and contributed the large majority of content to &quot;The Brownies&#x27; Book&quot;, which was a monthly children&#x27;s magazine that Du Bois, the &quot;Crisis&quot; business editor, Augustus Dill, and Fauset printed in 1920 and 1921. &quot;The Brownies&#x27; Book&quot; focused heavily on promoting standards of gender, class and racial behavior and pride, also using photographs to inspire young African-American children. Common themes in &quot;The Brownies&#x27; Book&quot; included doing well in school, taking pride in one&#x27;s appearance, and learning about one&#x27;s heritage, with many African folk tales and other African cultural issues mentioned.

Advertising also tended to focus heavily on education, with ads for various schools, institutions, training courses, and, of course, colleges and universities, featured in every issue during this time period, appearing before the table of contents in many cases.

==== Political impact under Du Bois ====
Du Bois tended to view &quot;The Crisis&quot; as his personal soapbox to a certain degree, heavily pushing his own opinions through the opinion section. Common concerns in his writings included promoting a positive, dignified, progressive image of African-American people; calling for action, social justice and an end to violence against blacks; and promoting good international relations, especially in regards to the Pan-African movement.

All of the issues between 1910 and 1934 feature an opinion section that was written by Du Bois (later renamed from &quot;Opinion&quot; to &quot;Postscript&quot;). Other Du Bois-authored columns included a &quot;Men of the Month&quot; column, which featured successful black men in various professions, a news column called &quot;Along the Color Line&quot;, and a &quot;Horizon&quot; column, which read as more of a newsletter, detailing positive accomplishments by African Americans. Du Bois frequently included reviews of news articles from other publications that he felt were incorrect, and also tracked certain special causes. As an editor, Du Bois did not shy away from showing photographs of and writing about controversial issues, including lynching, racism in the U.S. military, labor issues, and political issues with as Booker T. Washington&#x27;s views and Marcus Garvey&#x27;s views.

&quot;The Crisis&quot; was also used to promote the production of black cinema. The center of their promotion was the Ethiopian Art Theatre, in Chicago. The theatre was a place that provided training and promotion of black actors as well as employment for black citizens of Chicago. It attracted thousands of blacks from the South, who saw it as evidence of success and pride within the black community.

However strongly Du Bois&#x27;s opinions were expressed in the pages of &quot;The Crisis&quot;, he was certainly not the only contributor. During Fauset&#x27;s tenure as literary editor, she wrote and edited a column entitled &quot;The Looking Glass&quot;, which was primarily literature and art review, but also included other essays. The &quot;Outer Pocket&quot; column featured letters from readers. While Fauset&#x27;s primary concern and duties were with the literature of the times, she shared other political outlooks with Du Bois, such as a concern for education and families. African cultural issues were also of concern to both Du Bois and Fauset in general, with their many trips overseas, their participation in several Pan-African Congresses and Conferences, and African-themed cover art and other art on the pages of &quot;The Crisis&quot; throughout the years.

=== After Du Bois ===
Du Bois&#x27;s initial position as editor was in line with the NAACP&#x27;s liberal program of social reform and racial equality, but by the 1930s Du Bois was advocating a form of black separatism. This led to disputes between Du Bois and the NAACP, resulting in his resignation as editor in 1934. He was replaced by Roy Wilkins. However, financial issues were also at play. In his 1940 memoir &quot;Dusk of Dawn&quot;, Du Bois wrote that the periodical suffered during the Great Depression as the &quot;circulation dropped steadily until by 1933 it was scarcely more than ten thousand paid subscriptions.&quot;

While &quot;The Crisis&quot; has been published continually since 1910, its years under Du Bois are arguably far better-known than any of its other years. There have been 15 editors at the magazine&#x27;s helm since Du Bois&#x27;s departure. Roy Wilkins remained editor after Du Bois until 1949, when he became the acting NAACP secretary. James W. Ivy subsequently became the editor of the magazine until his retirement in 1966. The magazine continued to print news articles and opinion columns on current events and social concerns.

After Ivy&#x27;s retirement, other persons who served as editor included Henry Lee Moon, Warren Marr II, Chester Arthur Higgins Sr. (1917–2000), Maybelle Ward, Fred Beauford, Garland Thompson, Denise Crittendon, Gentry Trotter, Paul Ruffins, Ida E. Lewis, Phil Petrie, and Victoria Valentine.

From 1997 to 2003, it appeared as &quot;The New Crisis: The Magazine of Opportunities and Ideas&quot;, but the title has since reverted to &quot;The Crisis&quot;.

On August 7, 2007, Jabari Asim was named editor of &quot;The Crisis&quot; by then publisher Roger Wilkins. Asim came to &quot;The Crisis&quot; from &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, where he was &quot;Book World&quot; deputy editor.

The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; named &quot;The Crisis&quot; one of its &quot;50 Favorite Magazines&quot; in 2008, stating: &quot;This venerable publication of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has continued to evolve and illuminate since its premiere issue in November 1910 (one year after the creation of the NAACP).&quot;[11]

== Advertisement ==

Advertisements in &quot;The Crisis&quot; showcase jobs, education, and businesses in the African-American community. These advertisements often reflected the views of the current editor. Under Du Bois, advertisements on education are most prevalent. All types of schools, institutions, training courses, colleges and universities. Some of the schools advertised are Howard University, Fisk University, Paine College, The Cheyney Training School for Teachers and many others. The number one thing these schools had in common was they were all only for colored students. Another popular advertisement under Du Bois was job advertisements. Some of the jobs advertised were teachers, vendors, nurses, dentists, civil service and stenographers. There was always a need for advertising agents. &quot;The Crisis&quot; even had its own ad for agents specifically for the magazine. The advertisement section also includes ads for other magazines and books to read. One of these magazines is &quot;The Brownies&#x27; Book&quot;, a magazine for children; a double subscription to &quot;The Brownies&#x27; Book&quot; and &quot;The Crisis&quot; for a special price is even offered. Another was &quot;Locoma Magazine&quot;, an adult magazine featuring such topics as marriage, divorce, eugenics, and birth control. &quot;The Crisis&quot; also advertised books that claimed to be necessary reading for all African Americans; among these books weree &quot;&quot; by Du Bois, &quot;Scott&#x27;s Official History of the American Negro in the Great War&quot; by Emmett Jay Scott, and &quot;As Nature Leads&quot; by J. A. Rogers. As the magazine continued its growth and influence, they added a table of books readers could buy from the magazine, which was called &quot;The Crisis Book Mart&quot;. This range of books featured influential writers including Langston Hughes, Alain Locke, Claude McKay and others. Many of the books and magazines advertised in &quot;The Crisis&quot; are aimed to showcase culture as well as to educate African Americans. Real estate was also included in the magazine&#x27;s advertisements, as well as plots of land for building homes and even for vacationing in various locations such as Orchardville, Idlewood, Pleasantville, and Atlantic City. This showed the spread of African Americans across different cities, as well as their prospering wealth.
Other types of advertisements in &quot;The Crisis&quot; promoted music as well as vocalists and musicians. Some of those promoted were lyric soprano Cleota Collins, concert violinist Wesley I. Howard, and high-class entertainers Invincible Concert Co. There were also advertisements for phonograph records as well as hymn books, and plays.

Other advertisements of &quot;The Crisis&quot; magazine covered a variety of topics: a Booker T Washington bust, colored dolls, hair grower/preparation (Madam C. J. Walker&#x27;s preparations for the hair/ Nile Queen), wigs (fashion book), tooth polish (Dr. Welters antiseptic tooth powder), tuxedos, NAACP membership, Christmas Seals (for the NAACP/ protecting against tuberculosis), &quot;On Health&#x27;s Highway&quot; to support cancer patients, laundry, Negro art photo calendar, undertaking and embalming, life health and accident insurance. Many of these advertisements showed the push for African Americans, women especially, to focus on their looks. One such advertisement even stated: &quot;It is the duty of human beings to be attractive.&quot;

<text>Bob and Ray were an American comedy duo whose career spanned five decades, composed of comedians Bob Elliott (1923–2016) and Ray Goulding (1922–1990). The duo&#x27;s format was typically to satirize the medium in which they were performing, such as conducting radio or television interviews, with off-the-wall dialogue presented in a generally deadpan style as though it were a serious broadcast.

==Radio==
Elliott and Goulding began as radio announcers (Elliott a disc jockey and Goulding a newscaster) in Boston with their own separate programs on station WHDH, and each would visit with the other while on the air. Their informal banter was so appealing that WHDH would call on them, as a team, to fill in when Red Sox baseball broadcasts were rained out. Elliott and Goulding (not yet known as Bob and Ray) would improvise comedy routines all afternoon, and joke around with studio musicians.

Elliott and Goulding&#x27;s brand of humor caught on, and WHDH gave them their own weekday show in 1946. &quot;Matinee with Bob and Ray&quot; was originally a 15-minute show, soon expanding to half an hour. (When explaining why Bob was billed first, Goulding claimed that it was because &quot;Matinee with Bob and Ray&quot; sounded better than &quot;Matinob with Ray and Bob&quot;.) Their trademark sign-off was &quot;This is Ray Goulding reminding you to write if you get work&quot;; &quot;Bob Elliott reminding you to hang by your thumbs.&quot;

===&quot;Matinee with Bob and Ray&quot;===
&quot;Matinee with Bob and Ray&quot; was broadcast Monday through Saturday on WHDH. The weekday half-hours were broadcast live; the Saturday shows were usually 25 minutes long and were sometimes recorded in advance. Staff musicians Ken Wilson (organ) and Bill Green (piano) opened each show with a sprightly rendition of &quot;Collegiate&quot;.

Fans who are familiar with Bob and Ray&#x27;s later routines, which were carefully scripted and timed, might be surprised by surviving episodes of &quot;Matinee with Bob and Ray&quot;. These shows were completely impromptu and always irreverent, demonstrating how very alert and quick-witted Bob and Ray were. They would follow any comic thread for a few minutes, and then just as suddenly abandon it to move on to another topic. If Ray happened to mention a distant city, Bob would solemnly introduce a travelogue and the pair would narrate a mock documentary. A chance remark about a labor-saving device would bring home-economics expert Mary Margaret McGoon (Ray) to the microphone, offering an unlikely recipe or promoting a useless appliance. If an idea ran out of steam, Bob and Ray&#x27;s cowboy entertainer Tex Blaisdell (voiced by Bob in a laconic drawl) came out of nowhere to plug his latest personal appearance in some tenth-rate theater. Almost all of the incidental characters passing through the studio were named Sturdley, which became a buzzword of the series.

A regular feature of &quot;Matinee with Bob and Ray&quot; was a soap opera parody, &quot;The Life and Loves of Linda Lovely&quot;. Ray would portray Linda, using a soft, breathy falsetto, with Bob portraying her beloved David in a halting, deliberate baritone. Neither Bob nor Ray knew what each story would involve, so each would cue the other and bat the dialogue back and forth as each situation got out of hand. A 1948 broadcast had Linda suddenly interrupting the story to take an urgent phone call, only to have David counter this turn of events by taking his own call; then Linda announced someone at the door and took a &quot;third&quot; phone call, which David accepted while Linda greeted the guest at the door and took a &quot;fourth&quot; phone call.

When the show took time out for a recorded commercial, the team would continue in the same vein. A testimonial by actor Basil Rathbone would be followed by Bob and Ray adopting British accents and outlining a mystery. A commercial for a toy dealer would result in Bob immediately introducing a children&#x27;s story as told by &quot;Uncle Ray&quot;. Beginning in October 1948 they satirized a regularly scheduled singing commercial for Mission Bell Wines, which called for an announcer to read the ad copy live between the opening chorus and the closing jingle. Bob and Ray took any number of liberties, singing the copy drunkenly or punctuating the written copy with sarcastic remarks.

Musicians Wilson and Green performed two selections during each show. Bob and Ray often dragged them into the action, with comments about their clothes, their vacation plans, their musicianship, or their work ethic (Ray: &quot;I don&#x27;t care if you two have Petrillo behind you, you always come in here thinking you own the place.&quot;). One episode had Bob and Ray commenting on a Wilson-Green duet and then discussing the many success stories of the Wilson and Green School of Music. These were all voiced by Bob and Ray, all awful musicians, and all named Sturdley.

Although &quot;Matinee with Bob and Ray&quot; did not have a studio audience, local residents (often high-school and college students) dropped by the studio daily to watch Bob and Ray. The team&#x27;s wilder flights of fancy would elicit laughter off-mike.

===Other radio projects===
&quot;Matinee with Bob and Ray&quot; became a favorite with listeners in New England, which brought Elliott and Goulding to the attention of NBC in New York. They continued on the air for over four decades on the NBC, CBS, and Mutual networks, and on New York City stations WINS, WOR, and WHN. From 1973 to 1976, they were the afternoon drive hosts on WOR, doing a four-hour show. In their last incarnation, they were heard on National Public Radio, ending in 1987.
They were regulars on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Monitor&quot;, often on standby to go on the air at short notice if the program&#x27;s planned segments developed problems, and they were also heard in a surprising variety of formats and time slots, from a 15-minute series in mid-afternoon to their hourlong show aired weeknights just before midnight in 1954–55. During that same period, they did an audience-participation game show, &quot;Pick and Play with Bob and Ray&quot;, which was short-lived. It came at a time when network pages filled seats for radio-TV shows by giving tickets to anyone in the street, and on &quot;Pick and Play&quot; the two comics were occasionally booed by audience members unfamiliar with the Bob and Ray comedy style.

Some of their radio episodes were released on recordings, and others were adapted into graphic story form for publication in &quot;MAD&quot; magazine. Their earlier shows were mostly ad-libbed, but later programs relied more heavily on scripts. While Bob and Ray created and improvised much of their material, they did accept sketches from writers. The first was Boston broadcaster Jack Beauvais, who had performed as a singer for WEEI in Boston during the 1930s and also worked for some of the big bands in the 1940s and 1950s. The pioneering radio humorist Raymond Knight was a fan, and submitted ideas and sketches. (Bob Elliott later married Knight&#x27;s widow.)

The most prolific freelance author was Tom Koch (pronounced &quot;Cook&quot;). In 1955 he was a staff writer for &quot;Monitor&quot;, and he sent Elliott and Goulding 10 bits. &quot;They bought eight,&quot; recalled Koch, &quot;so I sent them 10 more and they never did reject another one.&quot; Koch always submitted his work by interoffice or postal mail, and although Elliott and Goulding spoke with him in person occasionally, the working relationship was remote: &quot;The check would come and that would be it.&quot; Koch captured the Bob and Ray style so well that the team would recite from his scripts verbatim. Koch remained with Elliott and Goulding, off and on, for three decades.

==Characters and spoofs==

===Characters===
Elliott and Goulding lent their voices to a variety of recurring characters and countless one-shots, creating a multilayered world that parodied the real-life world of radio broadcasting. Elliott and Goulding played &quot;Bob&quot; and &quot;Ray&quot;, the hosts of an ostensibly serious radio program. Their &quot;staff&quot; (all voiced by Elliott and Goulding) was a comic menagerie of reporters, book reviewers, actors, and all other manner of radio personalities, all of whom interacted with &quot;Bob&quot; and &quot;Ray&quot;, as well as with each other. Almost all of these characters had picturesque names, as in one sketch where Bob introduced Ray as one Maitland Q. Montmorency. The guest replied, &quot;My name is John W. Norvis. I have &quot;terrible&quot; handwriting.&quot;

Recurring characters played by Bob Elliott included:
* Wally Ballou, an inept news reporter, man-on-the-street interviewer, &quot;and winner of 16 diction awards&quot;, whose opening transmission almost invariably begins with an &quot;up-cut&quot; with him starting early, before his microphone was live, as in &quot;–ly Ballou here&quot;. In one of his broadcasts, he was discovered to have started early on purpose and was chewed out by the location engineer (Ray) for making it look as though the mistake was his.
* Snappy sportscaster Biff Burns (&quot;So until next time, this is Biff Burns saying until next time, this is Biff Burns saying goodnight.&quot;)
* Johnny Braddock, another sportscaster, but with an obnoxious streak.
* Tex Blaisdell, a drawling cowboy singer who also did rope tricks on the radio (not to be confused with the real-life comic book artist and editor).
* Arthur Sturdley, an Arthur Godfrey take-off.
* Harry Backstayge, handsome stage actor and &quot;idol to a million other women&quot; (in the team&#x27;s parody of radio&#x27;s &quot;Backstage Wife&quot;).
* Pop Beloved, elderly stagehand in the Backstayge stories.
* Kent Lyle Birdley, a wheezing, stammering old-time radio announcer.
* Fred Falvy, &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; handyman, whose projects were usually absurdly expensive and/or utterly impractical – and occasionally illegal.
* One of the McBeeBee twins, either Claude or Clyde, were nonidentical twins who spoke in unison, led by Goulding with Elliott a syllable or two behind him, and always interviewed by Elliott.
* Cyril Gore, a Boris Karloff sound-alike, he often appeared as a butler or doorman; his catchphrase was &quot;Follow me down this cor-ree-dor.&quot;
* Peter Gorey, a character similar to Gore, but with a Peter Lorre-type voice, he would typically appear as a news reporter, reading the same gruesome stories (&quot;Three men were run over by a steamroller today...&quot;) each time he appeared. Bob and Ray also occasionally played a record of &quot;Music! Music! Music!&quot;, ostensibly sung by Gorey.

Any script calling for a child&#x27;s voice usually went to Elliott.

Ray Goulding&#x27;s roster of characters included:
* Mary Backstayge, wife of Harry Backstayge. 
* Webley Webster, mumble-mouthed book reviewer and organ player, whose reviews of historical novels and cookbooks were usually dramatized as seafaring melodramas.
* Calvin Hoogavin (using the same Webley voice), a character in the Mary Backstayge stories.
* Steve Bosco, sportscaster (who signed off with &quot;This is Steve Bosco rounding third, and being thrown out at home&quot;, parodying Joe Nuxhall&#x27;s signature sign-off of &quot;the old lefthander rounding third and heading for home&quot;).
* Jack Headstrong, the All-American American (satirizing the long-running &quot;Jack Armstrong&quot; radio series of juvenile adventures). The serious-voiced Jack was always entrusted with an impossible government mission, and had no patience with any of his friends and advisors (&quot;Quiet, Four-Star General! There&#x27;s no &quot;time&quot; for that now!&quot;).
* Artie Schermerhorn, another inept reporter. Sometimes partnered with Wally Ballou, often competing with him, especially when employed by the Finley Quality Network.
* Farm editor Dean Archer Armstead (his low, slurring delivery was unintelligible and punctuated by the sound of his spittle hitting a cuspidor); his theme music was a scratchy piano-lesson record of &quot;Old MacDonald Had a Farm&quot;.
* The other McBeeBee twin, either Clyde or Claude. As mentioned above, Goulding would speak first, usually trying to trip up and break up Elliott.
* Charles the Poet, who recited sappy verse (parodying the lugubrious Chicago late-night broadcaster Franklyn MacCormack and, to a lesser extent, the Ernie Kovacs character Percy Dovetonsils) but could never get through a whole example of his pathetic work without breaking down in laughter.
* Professor Groggins, a would-be space traveler who constructs a rocket ship in his backyard, but never successfully launches it.
* Recurring characters such as Matt Neffer, Boy Spot-Welder; failed actor Barry Campbell; crack-voiced reporter Arthur Schrank; Lawrence Fechtenberger, Interstellar Officer Candidate; and all female roles.

While originally employing a falsetto, Goulding generally used the same flat voice for all of his women characters, of which perhaps the best-known was Mary Margaret McGoon (satirizing home-economics expert Mary Margaret McBride), who offered bizarre recipes for such entrees as &quot;frozen ginger ale salad&quot; and &quot;mock turkey&quot;. In 1949, Goulding, as Mary, recorded &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Be a Cow in Switzerland&quot;, which soon became a novelty hit and is still occasionally played by the likes of Dr. Demento. Later, the character was known simply as Mary McGoon. Another female character was Natalie Attired, &quot;radio&#x27;s Song Sayer&quot; who, instead of singing songs, recited their lyrics to a drumbeat accompaniment.

===Spoofs and parodies===
Spoofs of other radio programs were another staple, including the continuing soap operas &quot;Mary Backstayge, Noble Wife&quot;, &quot;One Fella&#x27;s Family&quot;, and &quot;Aunt Penny&#x27;s Sunlit Kitchen&quot; (which spoofed &quot;Backstage Wife&quot;, &quot;One Man&#x27;s Family&quot;, and &quot;Aunt Jenny&#x27;s Real Life Stories&quot;, respectively). &quot;Mary Backstayge&quot; was serialized for such a long period of time that it became better known to many listeners than the show it lampooned. Another soap opera spoof, &quot;Garish Summit&quot; (which Bob and Ray performed during their stint on National Public Radio in the 1980s), recounts the petty squabbles for power among the wealthy family members who own a lead mine.

They also satirized &quot;Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons&quot; with the continuing parody, &quot;Mr. Trace, Keener than Most Persons&quot;. Each Mr. Trace sketch began with a simple plot that soon degenerated into total gibberish where the dialogue was concerned (&quot;Mister Treat, Chaser of Lost Persons&quot;, &quot;Thanks for the vote of treedle, Pete&quot;) and gunplay (&quot;You... You&#x27;ve shot me!... I&#x27;m... dead.&quot;). Juvenile adventures were given the satiric treatment: &quot;Jack Armstrong&quot; became &quot;Jack Headstrong&quot;, and &quot;Tom Corbett, Space Cadet&quot; became &quot;Lawrence Fechtenberger, Interstellar Officer Candidate&quot;.

The quiz show &quot;Dr. I.Q., the Mental Banker&quot; was parodied as &quot;Dr. O.K., the Sentimental Banker&quot;. Whereas the real Dr. I.Q. had several assistants with remote microphones, scattered through the audience to select contestants, Dr. O.K. (Bob) had to make do with a single assistant (Ed Sturdley, played by Ray), who eventually became exhausted from running around the theater. Other continuing parodies (both generic and specific) included game shows (&quot;The 64-Cent Question&quot;), children&#x27;s shows (&quot;Mr. Science&quot;, &quot;Tippy the Wonder Dog&quot;, &quot;Matt Neffer, Boy Spot-Welding King of the World&quot;), self-help seminars (&quot;Dr. Joyce Dunstable&quot;), and foreign intrigue (&quot;Elmer W. Litzinger, Spy&quot;).

In 1959 Bob and Ray launched a successful network radio series for CBS, broadcast from New York, known colloquially by a shortening of Goulding&#x27;s wry introduction: &quot;Bob &amp; Ray Present the CBS Radio Network.&quot; The CBS programming department frequently supplied scripts promoting the network&#x27;s dramatic and sports shows, but Bob and Ray never read these scripts entirely straight, and would often imitate the character voices heard on these shows. &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; and &quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot; were frequent targets, and &quot;Johnny Dollar&quot; inspired a full-fledged parody, &quot;Ace Willoughby, International Detective&quot;. In each installment, Willoughby (Ray, doing a letter-perfect impersonation of &quot;Johnny Dollar&quot; star Bob Bailey) traveled around the globe in pursuit of crooks, but always gave up when the crooks found him and kept beating him up. Bob and Ray revisited the Ace Willoughby format a decade later in a parody of the TV detective show &quot;Mannix&quot;. Their version, called &quot;Blimmix&quot;, featured a dimwitted detective and whatever thug served as the antagonist, with Blimmix being beaten up at the end of each segment.

In addition to parodies of specific programs and genres, many of Elliott and Goulding&#x27;s sketches turned on the inherent absurdities of reportage and interviewing. One particularly enduring routine cast Elliott as an expert on the Komodo dragon, and Goulding as the dense reporter whose questions trailed behind the information given. Another featured Elliott as the spokesman for the Slow Talkers of America (&quot;headquarters&quot; in Glens Falls, New York), whose lengthy pauses between words increasingly frustrate Goulding. The pair performed both of these sketches many times.

Their character known as &quot;The Worst Person in the World&quot; (a reference to &quot;New York&quot; magazine theatre critic John Simon, who gave their stage show a negative review) was, many years later, appropriated by MSNBC host Keith Olbermann.

===Commercial parodies===
Commercial parody was a popular forte with Bob and Ray. A typical show would have such &quot;sponsors&quot; as:
* The Monongahela Metal Foundry (&quot;Casting steel ingots with the housewife in mind&quot;)
* Einbinder Flypaper (&quot;The brand you&#x27;ve gradually grown to trust over the course of three generations&quot;)
* The Auburn Motor Car Company (&quot;Makers of fine automobiles up to, but not including, 1938&quot;)
* The United States Post Office (&quot;Makers and distributors of stamps&quot;)
* The Croftweiler Industrial Cartel (&quot;Makers of all sorts of stuff, made out of everything&quot;)
* Cool Canadian Air (&quot;Packed fresh every day in the Hudson Bay and shipped to your door&quot;)
* Grime (&quot;The magic shortening that spreads like lard&quot;)
* The United States Mint (&quot;One of the nation&#x27;s leading producers of genuine U.S. currency&quot;)
* Penuche (&quot;With or without nuts, the greatest name in fudge&quot;)
* Kretchford Braid and Tassel (&quot;Next time you think of braid or tassel, rush into your neighborhood store and shout, &#x27;Kretchford&#x27;!&quot;)
* Chocolate Cookies with White Stuff In Between (sponsoring Lawrence Fechtenberger)
* Gerstmeyer&#x27;s Puppy Kibbles (&quot;The dog food guaranteed to turn any pet into a vicious man-killer&quot;), sponsoring the police-drama spoof &quot;Squad Car 119&quot;.
* Mushies (&quot;The cereal that gets soggy even without adding milk or cream&quot;) sponsored &quot;Tippy the Wonder Dog&quot;.
* An unnamed beverage described as &quot;stuff that you pour in a glass and it fizzes up and gets all over your suit and everything&quot;.

==Television==

In the early 1950s, the two had their own 15-minute television series, entitled simply &quot;Bob &amp; Ray&quot;. It began November 26, 1951 on NBC with Audrey Meadows as a cast regular. During the second season, the title changed to &quot;Club Embassy&quot;, and Cloris Leachman joined the cast as a regular, replacing Audrey Meadows who left the series to join the cast of &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; on CBS. In the soap opera parodies, the actresses took the roles of Mary Backstayge and Linda Lovely. Expanding to a half-hour for the summer of 1952 only, the series continued until September 28, 1953. When &quot;The Higgins Boys and Gruber&quot; show began on The Comedy Channel in 1989, it occasionally included full episodes of Bob and Ray&#x27;s 1951–1953 shows (along with episodes of &quot;Clutch Cargo&quot; and &quot;Supercar&quot;).

The duo did more television in the latter part of their career, beginning with key roles of Bud Williams Jr. (Elliott) and Walter Gesundheit (Goulding) in Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s Hugo-nominated &quot;Between Time and Timbuktu: A Space Fantasy&quot; (1972), adapted from several Vonnegut novels and stories. (Vonnegut had once submitted comedy material to Bob and Ray.) Fred Barzyk directed this WGBH/PBS production, a science-fiction comedy about an astronaut-poet&#x27;s journey through the Chrono-Synclastic Infundibulum. This teleplay was first published in an edition that featured numerous screenshots of Bob and Ray and other cast members.

Bob and Ray also hosted a Goodson-Todman game show, &quot;The Name&#x27;s the Same&quot;, which was emceed originally by Robert Q. Lewis. Bob and Ray would do a brief comedy routine, and then play the normal game of having a celebrity panel try to guess the contestants&#x27; famous names. They would always end the show with their traditional closing: Ray saying, &quot;Write if you get work...&quot; and Bob finishing with &quot;And hang by your thumbs.&quot; The rigid format of the game gave the team little room to indulge their humor, and their run as hosts lasted only 10 weeks. In their final broadcast, they omitted the usual &quot;Write if you get work&quot; closing and simply said, &quot;So long.&quot; They were replaced the next week by Clifton Fadiman, who finished out the series.

During the late 1950s, Bob and Ray were also on radio and television as the voices of Bert and Harry Piel, two animated characters from a very successful ad campaign for Piels Beer. Since this was a regional beer, the commercials were not seen nationally, but the popularity of the ad campaign resulted in national press coverage. Based on the success of those commercials, they launched a successful advertising voice-over company, Goulding Elliott Graybar (so called because the offices were located in New York&#x27;s Graybar Building).

In 1971, Bob and Ray lent their voices to the children&#x27;s television program &quot;The Electric Company&quot; in a pair of short animated films; in one, explaining opposites, Ray was the &quot;writer of words&quot;, first for elevators, then doors, finally faucets. The other, illustrating words ending in -at, had Ray as &quot;Lorenzo the Magnificent&quot; who can read minds and who tries to read a word in Bob&#x27;s mind, that he thinks is an -at word such as &quot;hat&quot;, &quot;bat&quot;, &quot;rat&quot;, &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;mat&quot;, etc. (Bob&#x27;s word is actually &quot;Columbus&quot;.)

In 1973, Bob and Ray created an historic television program that was broadcast on two channels: one half of the studio was broadcast on the New York PBS affiliate WNET, and the other half of the studio was broadcast on independent station WNEW. Four sketches were performed, including a tug of war that served as an allegory about nuclear war. The two parts of the program are available for viewing at the Museum of Television &amp; Radio.

In 1979, they returned to national TV for a one-shot NBC special with members of the original &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast, &quot;Bob &amp; Ray, Jane &amp; Laraine &amp; Gilda&quot;. It included a skit (not written by Elliott and Goulding) in which the team sat in chairs, in business suits, facing the audience, nearly motionless, and sang a duet of Rod Stewart&#x27;s major hit &quot;Da Ya Think I&#x27;m Sexy?&quot; Elliott and Goulding, reviewing the script beforehand, didn&#x27;t like the idea at all and tried to refuse it, but their deadpan rendition of the song became the hour&#x27;s highlight. Near the beginning of the program, they announced a contest which would take suggestions for the &quot;new capital of Pennsylvania&quot;, not specifically mentioning the very recent Three Mile Island nuclear accident that had taken place near Harrisburg.

In 1980, they taped a one-hour pilot for CBS late night with the cast of SCTV titled &quot;From Cleveland&quot;, a sketch show staged on location in Cleveland. The show became a cult favorite with numerous showings at the Museum of Television &amp; Radio.

This was followed by a series of specials for PBS in the early 1980s. In 1982, Ray Goulding told the New York Times, &quot;It just keeps happening to us. I suppose each new generation notices that we are there.&quot;

Bob and Ray also appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; several times in the late 1950s and early &#x27;60s; guested on the Johnny Carson and David Letterman shows throughout the 1970s and &#x27;80s; provided voices for the animated 1981 special &quot;B.C.: A Special Christmas&quot;, and made guest appearances on episodes of &quot;The David Steinberg Show&quot;, &quot;Happy Days&quot;, and &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot;.

==Other media==

Elliott and Goulding starred in a pair of two-man stage shows: &quot;The Two and Only&quot; on Broadway in 1970 (featuring a Playbill drawn by Mort Drucker), and &quot;A Night of Two Stars&quot; at Carnegie Hall in 1984. They also did extensive work in radio and television commercials, and enjoyed supporting roles in the feature films &quot;Cold Turkey&quot; (1971), where they played caricatures of famous news personalities of that day, and &quot;Author! Author!&quot; (1982).

In 1960, Bob and Ray published a children&#x27;s book based on some of their characters and routines, &quot;Linda Lovely and the Fleebus.&quot;

The duo also collaborated on three books collecting routines featuring some of their signature characters and routines: &quot;Write If You Get Work: The Best of Bob &amp; Ray&quot; (1976; the title referenced Goulding&#x27;s usual sign-off line), &quot;From Approximately Coast to Coast: It&#x27;s The Bob &amp; Ray Show&quot; (1983), and &quot;The New! Improved! Bob &amp; Ray Book&quot; (1985). The team also recorded audiobook versions.

Along with the audio books and numerous collections of radio broadcasts, Bob and Ray recorded several albums, including recordings of their stage performances &quot;The Two and Only&quot; and &quot;A Night of Two Stars&quot;, &quot;Bob and Ray on a Platter&quot;, and &quot;Bob and Ray Throw a Stereo Spectacular&quot;.

==Later lives==
Ray Goulding became ill in the late 1970s, suffering from kidney disease and enduring regular dialysis treatments. He was forced to adjust his working schedule to accommodate his regimen of hospital visits and treatments. Goulding refused to consider a kidney transplant, preferring to continue leading his life as he had been. Because of the new demands on Goulding&#x27;s time, the team could no longer accept daily radio jobs or extensive advertising campaigns. This reduced their workload somewhat, but the team continued to work together for another decade, as outlined above.

Ray Goulding died on March 24, 1990. Elliott continued to perform, most notably with his son (actor/comedian Chris Elliott) on the TV sitcom &quot;Get a Life&quot;, on episodes of &quot;Newhart&quot;, &quot;LateLine&quot; and &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, in the films &quot;Cabin Boy&quot; (also with son Chris) and &quot;Quick Change&quot;, and on radio for the first season of Garrison Keillor&#x27;s &quot;American Radio Company of the Air&quot;. Chris would join the cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for season 20 in 1994, and his daughter Abby also joined the cast midway through season 34 in 2009, marking three generations of Elliotts appearing on the show.

Bob and Ray were inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1995. Many of their shows are available for listening at The Paley Center for Media in New York and Los Angeles. The Paley Center has such a large collection of Bob and Ray tapes that many of these remained uncatalogued for years.

Bob Elliott died on February 2, 2016, a victim of throat cancer.

==Honors==
Bob and Ray have won three Peabody Awards over the years, in 1951, 1956, and 1982.

Bob and Ray were inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in the radio division.

<text>Matunga (Marathi pronunciation: ) is a Neighbourhood in City area of Mumbai, India. It is accessible from the Matunga Road station on the Western line, Matunga station on the Central Line and King&#x27;s Circle station on the Harbour Line.

Geographically, Matunga is surrounded by the Mahim to the North-West, Byculla 
 to the South, Wadala to the East and Lower Parel  to the South.

== History ==
Matunga formed a part of the seven original islands of Mumbai with Mahim, then known as Mahikavati. It is said that the King of Mahikavati had his elephant stables in Matunga, and that the name Matunga was derived from &quot;Matanga&quot;, the Sanskrit word for Elephant.

Matunga was among the first well planned localities of Mumbai. The Dadar-Matunga-Wadala-Sion plan of 1899-1900 was formulated to evenly distribute population as well as provide better living standards. Matunga has a juxtaposition of Irani cafes and Udupis and houses one of the oldest residents of Mumbai.

The Dadar-Matunga-Wadala-Sion scheme of 1899-1900 was the first planned suburban scheme in Bombay. The City Improvement Trust formulated this plan in order to relieve congestion in the centre of the town, following the plague epidemics of the 1890s. According to the survey plan, 60,000 people were to be housed at Dadar-Matunga and an equal number in Sion-Matunga. 85,000 people were to be accommodated in the developments in Sewri-Wadala. The plans regulated constructions with emphasis on proper sanitation. No building was to be more than three storeys high, and the buildings were to have open spaces between them. The land-use was planned to be a mix of residential, commercial and institutional constructions. Parks and gardens were planned, and the streets were well laid out.

440 acres of land was procured and leased to the Government for selling. For the first time housing cooperatives were formed to take advantage of newly developed land. The Parsi and Hindu colonies in Dadar and the Tamil colony in Matunga were developed in this way.

Among the institutions which moved here according to the CIT plan were the VJTI and King George&#x27;s School.

== Demographics ==
Matunga has a large population of people who have been residing here for several decades. An effect of this has been a good number of traditional South Indian temples and restaurants serving authentic South Indian dishes that can be found in the area. The number of Gujaratis has also been on the rise in recent years. One of the earliest Gujaratis to come to Matunga were from the Kapol community. They built the Kapol Hostel and Kapol Niwas in Matunga.

Matunga, having a predominantly Hindu population, also has a sizeable presence of Marathis, Bengalis and members of the Parsi community.

Matunga is known for its eateries serving south Indian food.

Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated on a large scale in Matunga, with multiple Ganesh Mandals that are beautifully decorated during the 10 day festival.

== Matunga market ==

The Lal Bahadur Shastri Market in Matunga is the main market of Matunga, housing multiple shops and hawkers selling vegetables, clothes, jewellery and groceries. Matunga East does not house either a meat market or a fish market and the nearest shops for poultry and fish are in Matunga West, Wadala and Dadar.

The flower market of Matunga is famous for its South Indian essence and is quite well known in Mumbai.

== Educational institutions ==
The Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI), Institute of Chemical Technology (erstwhile University Department of Chemical Technology), Guru Nanak Khalsa College, R.A. Podar College, Ramnarain Ruia College, and Welingkar Institute of Management are some of higher education institutions located in Matunga. These institutions are accredited by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC).

Some of the other schools nearby are South Indian Education Society High School, J.B.Vacha School in Dadar Parsi Colony, and King George School nearby in Dadar, which is on the border of Matunga and Dadar.

In 1937, the general council of Salesians of Don Bosco approved a plan to buy land in Matunga from the Bombay Municipal Corporation. The Corporation approved the sale on 16 July 1937. The Salesians bought the land for ₹229,160. The Don Bosco High School (formerly known as The Catholic Educational Institute) run by them was shifted from the rented premises at Tardeo to the new Don Bosco campus at Matunga.

Matunga boarding which was known as &quot;Shri Hirji Bhojraj &amp; Sons KVO Jain Chhatralaya&quot; was established in 1915. This campus also houses &quot;Shishuvan school&quot;.

<doc id="573413" wikidata="Q7175195" url="?curid=573413" title="Peter King (Australian politician)">
<text>Peter Edward James King (born 29 June 1952) is an Australian politician who was a Liberal Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from November 2001 to October 2004, representing the seat of Wentworth, New South Wales. King is also a barrister and an author.

==Early life==
He was born in Bingara, New South Wales, and was educated at the Shore School, where he was School Captain and Captain of the GPS Rugby 1st XV, Sydney University, where he resided at St. Paul&#x27;s College, and Oxford University, where he gained an MA and was selected as a Rugby Blue against Cambridge. He was Rhodes Scholar for New South Wales in 1975.

==Early political career==
He was a member of the Woollahra Municipal Council and was Mayor 1990–91. He was NSW State President of the Liberal Party 1989–92. Throughout the 1990s King was a leading advocate of the Australian monarchy, opposing the push for an Australian republic. He was unsuccessful candidate for Liberal preselection at the 1994 Warringah by-election, losing to Tony Abbott. Between November 2001 and 2004 he held the seat of Wentworth in the Australian Parliament.

==Ousting by Malcolm Turnbull==
In 2003, after only two years in the federal Parliament, King was challenged for his Liberal endorsement in Wentworth by Malcolm Turnbull, then a wealthy merchant banker, Federal Treasurer of the Liberal Party and former head of the Australian Republican Movement. During the bitter pre-selection campaign, King accused Turnbull of branch stacking, by having local members transferring their membership to a branch that would decide the selection, what King referred to as &quot;branch stripping&quot;.

Following his preselection loss, on 3 September 2004 King announced that he would stand for Wentworth as an independent at the 2004 election. As a result, the traditionally Liberal electorate was turned into an electoral wildcard, with the contest becoming a three-person race between Turnbull, King and Labor candidate David Patch. During the campaign, Turnbull spent over A$600,000 on the campaign. While the Liberal primary vote fell 10.3 percent to 41.8 percent, King received 18 percent of the primary vote with a 57/43 Liberal/Labor preference split which brought Turnbull over the line, but on a reduced 55.5 percent two-party vote after a 2.4 percent swing it made Wentworth a marginal seat on paper for the first time since the 1993 election. For standing against a preselected Liberal party member, King was banned from the Liberal Party for ten years. His wife Fiona, daughter of former National Party leader Ian Sinclair, was banned for five years.

==Return to Politics==
In 2015, King rejoined the Liberal Party and in July 2017, an article appeared in the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; reporting he was supporting reform of the Liberal Party preselection processes. King refused to comment when asked whether he would like to re-enter Federal Parliament. In August 2017 King and lawyer Matthew Bransgrove formed an organisation called CivilDefenceNow and began a series of lectures to Liberal Party branches in the Wentworth electorate on the dangers posed to Australia&#x27;s national security by North Korea.

==Legal career==
King was a barrister prior to entering politics and still practises. He was a Judicial Member of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal of NSW 1995–2001. He is the author of Limitation of Liability in Australian Maritime Law (1991), and a critique of climate change policy called The Challenge of the Commons (2015). King appeared in cases for farmers against banks during the drought between 2001 and 2009 helping to keep many farmers on their farms; and in commercial and constitutional cases including the cases of Spencer v Commonwealth (2010) and Gaynor v Chief of Defence Force.

==Other Posts==
King is a member of the Sydney University Senate, was Chair of the Australian Heritage Commission 1998–2001, Chair of the World Heritage Committee in 2001–01, and President of the World Heritage Bureau in 2001–02. King was elected the President of Sydney College of Divinity in 2010, a position he still holds.

<text>The Flacourtiaceae is a defunct family of flowering plants whose former members have been scattered to various families, mostly to the Achariaceae and Salicaceae. It was so vaguely defined that hardly anything seemed out of place there and it became a dumping ground for odd and anomalous genera, gradually making the family even more heterogeneous. In 1975, Hermann Sleumer noted that &quot;Flacourtiaceae as a family is a fiction; only the tribes are homogeneous.&quot;

In Cronquist&#x27;s classification, the Flacourtiaceae included 79–89 genera and 800–1000 species. Of these, many, including the type genus &quot;Flacourtia&quot;, have now been transferred to the Salicaceae in the molecular phylogeny-based classification, known as the APG IV system, established by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. In the list below, the Salicaceae are circumscribed broadly. Some taxonomists further divide the Salicaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot; into three families: Salicaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot;, Scyphostegiaceae, and Samydaceae, or into three subfamilies.

<doc id="573419" wikidata="Q241399" url="?curid=573419" title="White-headed duck">
<text>The white-headed duck (Oxyura leucocephala) is a small diving duck some long. The male has a white head with black crown, a blue bill, and reddish-grey plumage. The female has a dark bill and rather duller colouring. Its breeding habitat is lakes with open water and dense vegetation at the margin. It dives under water and feeds on aquatic vegetation as well as some animal matter. It is more likely to swim away from a perceived threat than to fly. This duck is known from Spain, North Africa, Western Asia and Central Asia. Populations are declining, mostly due to loss of habitat and pollution, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the bird&#x27;s status as &quot;endangered&quot;.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
The white-headed duck was originally described as &quot;Anas leucocephala&quot; by Giovani Antonio Scopoli in 1769. It is currently in the genus Oxyura. Other generic synonyms used in the past include &quot;Erismatura&quot;, &quot;Cerconectes&quot;, &quot;Gymnura&quot;, &quot;Undina&quot;, &quot;Bythonessa&quot;, &quot;Plectrura&quot;, and &quot;Pervicauda&quot;. Other junior synonyms for the species include &quot;Anas mersa&quot;, &quot;Anas vindila&quot;, &quot;Anas ruthenica&quot;, and &quot;Oxyura unifasciata&quot;. Its scientific name comes from the Greek &quot;Oxyura&quot; (from &quot;oxus&quot;, &quot;sharp&quot;, and &quot;oura&quot;, &quot;tail&quot;) and &quot;leucocephala&quot; (from leukos, &quot;white&quot; and &quot;kephalos&quot;, &quot;head&quot;. The common name white-headed duck, like the specific name, refers to its white head.

It interbreeds with other species in its genus, such as the ruddy duck. The hybrids are fully fertile and capable of having viable offspring with both parent species.

The species is monotypic. Different populations of the white-headed duck do not display significant genetic differences. However, some studies have found that they do display morphological differences, with western populations being larger in size, having darker ventral coloration, and males having more yellow feathers on their back. Dark phase birds have only been found in the western populations.

In the genus Oxyura, it is generally thought to be related most closely to Maccoa duck. Some studies have also found that these two species form a clade with the blue-billed duck, although this is disputed and species relations between Oxyura ducks are unresolved.

==Description==
Adult males have a grey and reddish body, a blue bill and a largely white head with a black cap and neck. Adult females have a grey-brown body with a white face and a darker bill, cap, and cheek stripe. Length is and weight is .
==Distribution and habitat==

This duck breeds in Spain and North Africa, with a larger population in western and central Asia. Their breeding habitat is large tracts of open water, such as lakes and ponds including artificial water bodies, with dense stands of aquatic plants to provide shelter and nesting sites. Individuals are fairly frequently reported well north of their breeding range, but as with many wildfowl, the status of these extralimital records is clouded by the possibility of escapes from collections.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

=== Diet ===
These birds dive and swim under water. They are omnivorous, with vegetable matter predominating. They are reluctant to fly, preferring to swim for cover.

==Conservation==
This duck is considered endangered due to a large reduction in populations in the last 10 years. Most of this decline is due to habitat loss and hunting, but interbreeding of the Spanish population with the introduced ruddy duck (&quot;Oxyura jamaicensis&quot;) is a more recent threat. This has led to the attempted eradication of the American species from western Europe.

The white-headed duck is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the bird&#x27;s conservation status as being &quot;endangered&quot;.

<text>Henri Braconnot (; 29 May 178013 January 1855) was a French chemist and pharmacist.

He was born in Commercy, his father being a counsel at the local parliament. At the death of his father, in 1787, Henri began his instruction in an elementary school in Commercy and then with private teachers.

At 13, he was placed as apprentice in a pharmacy in Nancy where he learned and practiced pharmacy, chemistry, and botany. At 15, he left Nancy for a military service in a hospital in Strasbourg.

In 1801-1802, he lived in Paris where he learnt in various schools, Museum, school of medicine among others, and followed the lectures of Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. He carried out some chemical investigations on the composition of a fossil horn which were published later (J Chim Phys 1806).

From 1802 to his death, he lived in Nancy where he was named in 1807 as director of the botanical garden and member of the scientific academy of the town. He worked as a chemist until his death mainly on plant chemistry. He made several research on plant assimilation, organic acids, plant composition and fats. He made also minor contributions to mineralogy and hydrology.

He was elected in 1823 correspondent member of the Académie des Sciences in Paris. Until his death in 1855, he published 112 works.

In the fat domain, Braconnot described in 1815 that fats are formed of a solid part (&quot;absolute tallow&quot;) and an oily compound (&quot;absolute oil&quot;), their consistency resulting from the proportions of the two parts. This conclusion was obtained after pressing fats in the cold between filter papers (Ann Chimie 1815, 93, 225). Furthermore, after saponification and acidification Braconnot separated a solid fraction similar to &quot;adipocire&quot; described by Fourcroy (1806). Unfortunately, he did not observe its acid properties which led Chevreul to discover in 1820 stearic acid. 

As these data were similar to the first data obtained by Chevreul as soon as 1813, the later sent a letter to the journal &quot;Annales de Chimie&quot; claiming his priority and contesting the originality of Braconnot&#x27;s work (Ann Chim 1815, 94, 73).
As an application of his laboratory work, it occurred to Braconnot that the &quot;absolute tallow&quot; (similar to stearine) from beef or sheep could be used to make candles. He named that substance &quot;céromimène&quot; (wax-like). With Simonin F, a pharmacist in Nancy, he patented in 1818 a process of candle manufacture. An improved process using stearic acid was patented by Chevreul seven years later.

In the domain of plant chemistry, Braconnot contributed to the isolation and the description of several compounds, most of which were shown later to be mixtures of simpler products. Among others, Braconnot discovered gallic and ellagic acids (1818) and pyrogallic acid (pyrogallol) which later enabled the development of photography. He discovered also in 1811 chitin in mushrooms, the earliest known polysaccharide. In 1819, he published a memoir describing for the first time the conversion of wood, straw or cotton into a sugar by a sulfuric acid treatment. The name glucose was proposed 24 years later by Dumas for a sugar similarly obtained from starch, cellulose, or honey.
By the same acid process, Braconnot obtained a &quot;gelatin sugar&quot; (named later glycocolle, now glycine) from gelatin and leucine from muscle fibers. Furthermore, reacting concentrated nitric acid on wood or cotton, Braconnot obtained a flammable product, xyloïdine (a precursor of collodion and nitrocellulose), which could be transformed into a vitreous varnish. This substance may be considered as the first polymer or plastic material created by a chemist.

In 1825, he discovered a structural heteropolysaccharide, pectin.

<doc id="573451" wikidata="Q9983" url="?curid=573451" title="Emperor Yingzong of Ming">
<text>Emperor Yingzong of Ming (29 November 1427 – 23 February 1464), personal name Zhu Qizhen, was the sixth and eighth emperor of the Ming dynasty. He ruled as the Zhengtong Emperor from 1435 to 1449, and as the Tianshun Emperor from 1457 until his death in 1464.

He was the eldest son and successor of the Xuande Emperor. After ascending the throne, he adopted the era name Zhengtong, which means &quot;right governance&quot;. During his first reign, the empire was at its height of prosperity and power. As the first child emperor of the Ming dynasty, Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s rule was heavily influenced by high dignitaries at court. Initially, his grandmother, Grand Empress Dowager Zhang, along with the &quot;Three Yangs&quot; (Yang Shiqi, Yang Rong, and Yang Pu), held the highest positions of power. However, in 1442, the emperor began to listen more to the eunuch Wang Zhen.

In 1449, at Wang Zhen&#x27;s suggestion, Emperor Yingzong personally led the army against the Mongol army of Esen Taishi, but at the Battle of Tumu Fortress, the Ming army was defeated and the emperor was captured. This event shocked the government and the country, leading the court to elevate Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s brother, Zhu Qiyu, to the throne as the Jingtai Emperor. During his captivity, Emperor Yingzong had established good relations with Esen and was eventually released in 1450.

After Emperor Yingzong returned to his homeland, his brother felt threatened and ordered him to stay in the Southern Palace within the Forbidden City. He also restricted Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s contact with the outside world. Essentially, Emperor Yingzong was placed under house arrest. In early 1457, the Jingtai Emperor fell ill and, since his only son had died in 1453, there was no heir to the throne. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Emperor Yingzong organized a palace coup and regained power in February 1457. The era name of his second reign was Tianshun, which means &quot;obedience to Heaven&quot;. The following month, the Jingtai Emperor died.

Emperor Yingzong ruled for another seven years before his death in 1464 at the age of thirty-six. His eldest son, the Chenghua Emperor, then ascended to the imperial throne.

==Childhood and accession==
Zhu Qizhen, the future Emperor Yingzong, was born on 29 November 1427 as the elder of the two sons of the Xuande Emperor. His mother, Lady Sun, was one of the emperor&#x27;s concubines. On 20 February 1428, he was created crown prince, and in March of the same year, the Xuande Emperor promoted Lady Sun to empress. The father was overjoyed by his son&#x27;s birth and showed him love and affection. He also ensured that Zhu Qizhen received proper military training. In 1433, the Ministry of War assembled a detachment of 7,112 physically fit 11–12-year-old youths, as ordered by the emperor, and the prince was appointed as their commander. He also began his education in reading and writing, with his first teacher likely being the eunuch and former pedagogue, Wang Zhen.

The Xuande Emperor died on 31 January 1435 after a brief illness, less than two months. At the time of his father&#x27;s death, Zhu Qizhen was only seven years old, prompting a proposal to place his uncle, Zhu Zhanshan, Prince of Xiang and Xuande&#x27;s younger brother, on the throne. According to the 17th century Chinese historian Mao Qiling, Zhu Zhanshan was supported by the Grand Empress Dowager Zhang, who was both his and the Xuande Emperor&#x27;s mother. Empress Dowager Sun quickly intervened and prevented Zhu Zhanshan&#x27;s ascension, resulting in Zhu Qizhen being crowned as the new emperor. Despite this, Lady Zhang still held significant influence in the government.

In contrast, the editors of the &quot;History of Ming&quot;, the official history of the Ming dynasty completed in 1739, portrayed Empress Dowager Zhang as a supporter of Zhu Qizhen&#x27;s rights. According to their version, she summoned all three Grand Secretaries—Yang Shiqi, Yang Rong, and Yang Pu—to her and emphasized that her grandson Zhu Qizhen was now emperor. Thereupon, the Grand Secretaries expressed their allegiance to the young prince, followed by the entire court.

==Regency of Grand Empress Dowager Zhang==
Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s ascension to the throne was in accordance with the rules, as he was the eldest son of the deceased emperor and the officially created crown prince. However, the laws established by the founder of the dynasty, the Hongwu Emperor, enshrined a system of government in which a strong and decisive monarch was expected to make decisions independently, with the advice of ministers. This system did not account for the scenario of a child ruler, leaving no provisions or precedents for how to handle the situation. At court, the most respected and highest-ranking individual was the Grand Empress Dowager Zhang, who effectively, though not formally, became the regent. Empress Dowager Sun was also occasionally consulted, but she held a lower status than her mother-in-law.

Lady Zhang was the leader of the council, which consisted of three Grand Secretaries and three eunuchs. The Grand Secretaries, known as the &quot;Three Yangs&quot;—Yang Shiqi, Yang Rong, and Yang Pu—had been in their positions for many years, with Yang Pu serving as Grand Secretary since 1424 and the other two since 1402. They were highly skilled, influential, and respected. The eunuchs, Wang Jin, Fan Hong, and Jin Ying, were in charge of the Directorate of Ceremonial, the most powerful office in the Imperial Palace. They had all held their positions under the previous emperor. The empress dowager acted as a mediator between the grand secretaries and the head eunuchs. The emperor&#x27;s exclusion from decision-making was considered illegal, but it allowed for the successful rule of experienced statesmen, particularly the Three Yangs. This period of political stability was later seen as a golden age by future generations.

The eunuch Wang Zhen served as the teacher, tutor, and confidant of the emperor. He was from the northern Chinese province of Shanxi, just like Lady Zhang, and was significantly younger than the other members of the Imperial Council, being in his thirties. It quickly became evident that the emperor placed complete trust in him, leading to an increase in his power and the secretaries having to take his opinions into account. Lady Zhang, however, viewed Wang Zhen&#x27;s influence on the emperor as dangerous and attempted to restrict him, even going so far as to order him to commit suicide in 1437. Despite this, the emperor, with the support of some officials, managed to prevent the order from being carried out.

The political landscape underwent significant changes in the early 1440s. In 1440, Yang Rong, a prominent figure at the age of sixty-nine, died. On 8 June 1442, the emperor entered into marriage with Lady Qian, and on 18 November 1442, just a few days before his fifteenth birthday, he assumed control of the government. Two days later, Grand Empress Dowager Zhang died.

==Domination of Wang Zhen==

Wang Zhen&#x27;s time had finally arrived. He possessed great talent, was direct, attentive, and charismatic, but over time, he became conceited. His power primarily stemmed from his personal influence over the emperor, who held his teacher in the highest regard. Wang Zhen was also a skilled politician. He formed alliances with Xu Xi (), who was later promoted to Minister of War, as well as Imperial Guard commander Ma Shun and his deputy and nephew Wang Shan, and Left Vice Minister of War Wang Ji, who previously organized the &quot;youth-guards&quot; () of the young emperor, later also appointed as Minister of War. Wang Zhen also had control over the Imperial Guard, which he did not hesitate to use against his opponents, and he also had influence among the ministers. With these advantages, Wang Zhen easily gained the upper hand in politics. While he had held back during Lady Zhang&#x27;s lifetime, after her death, he began to push the Grand Secretaries, who were now in their seventies, out of active politics. Yang Shiqi died in 1444, and two years later, Yang Pu also died. After their deaths, only Cao Nai () remained a strong figure among the Grand Secretaries. His colleague Ma Yu () only handled routine work, and the new Grand Secretaries appointed in the late 1440s—Gao Gu (), Chen Xun (), and Miao Zhong ()—did not have a significant impact on politics.

So far, the system of grand coordinators (&quot;xunfu&quot;), who manage the &quot;three provincial offices&quot; (civil, military, and surveillance), has taken a definitive form in the provinces. They operate in all provinces except Fujian and in six of the nine border garrisons on the northern border. The immediate consequence of the introduction of grand coordinators was the transfer of command over the troops in the provinces to civilian hands, likely due to the decline in the quality of hereditary officers.

The court did not forget about culture either. During Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s reign, the re-publishing of sets of Buddhist and Taoist classics was completed. Specifically, in 1440, the Buddhist collection &quot;Chinese Buddhist Canon&quot; (; &quot;Dàzàngjīng&quot;; &#x27;Great Storage of Scriptures&#x27;) consisting of 6361 volumes in 636 books was published, with a preface written by the emperor. In 1445, the Taoist collection &quot;Zhengtong-era Daoist Canon&quot; (; &quot;Zhèngtǒng dàocáng&quot;) was published in 481 books of 5305 volumes. Additionally, in 1443, a work on the moral patterns of &quot;On the Five Relationships&quot; (; &quot;Wǔlúnshū&quot;) with 62 volumes was published. The emperor also wrote a preface to the new edition of the Song work on acupuncture &quot;Illustrated Manual of Acupuncture Points on a Bronze Figure&quot; (; &quot;Tóngrén Shùxué Zhēnjiǔ Tújīng&quot;) in 3 volumes. This work included text and illustrations engraved in stone and a bronze sculpture with 360 acupuncture points. The original illustrations and statue, created during the Song dynasty, had eroded and faded, so both were remade.

==Economy and finance==
===Economic downturn===
In the mid-1430s, a sixty-year cold period began in the Northern Hemisphere, accompanied by sporadic floods and droughts that resulted in crop failures, leading to famines and epidemics. China was also struck by a series of natural disasters in the late 1430s and 1440s, with floods, droughts, epidemics, and famines occurring in succession. In 1448, the Yellow River breached its dams, causing the waters to flow into northern Jiangsu. The following year, another dam broke, diverting part of the Yellow River&#x27;s flow into the Guo River and then the Huai River, eventually reaching the sea in southern Jiangsu. Flooding persisted into the 1450s, and the changing course of the Yellow River posed a threat to the water supply of Beijing.

The government attempted to assist the victims by remitting taxes in large quantities, particularly during the regency of Grand Empress Dowager Zhang, who consistently showed concern for the impoverished, but despite these efforts, dissatisfaction among the population continued to grow. This was largely due to the compulsory work system, which placed an unbearable burden on the people in some regions. As a result, artisans evaded state demands and peasants abandoned their land, leading to a significant decrease in population in certain areas. On the other hand, bandits and vagabonds multiplied.

The economic decline in China from the early 1440s to the mid-1460s resulted in a decrease in porcelain production, particularly for export. Even the emperor&#x27;s ban on the private sale of blue-and-white porcelain in 1439, which aimed to protect the state monopoly, did not contribute to the growth of production. In fact, in January 1448, the ban was reinforced and extended to forbid the production of porcelain in any colors other than blue and white (such as yellow, purple, red, green, dark blue, and light blue) for private sale in Raozhou prefecture, where Jingdezhen, known for its porcelain, is located. These prohibitions may have been one of the reasons for the scarcity of porcelain from the Zhengtong, Jingtai and Tianshun eras (1436–1464).

The &quot;Three Yangs&quot; responded to the economic problems mentioned above by cutting state spending. This was made worse by the struggles in the southwest during the 1430s and 1440s, which led to a decline in mining in the region. As a result, they cancelled overseas expeditions and restricted official foreign trade. These austerity measures were easier for them to accept because they directly affected the economic power of the eunuchs in the imperial palace, who were competing with other groups for power. The eunuchs were the ones involved in maritime expeditions and had a vested interest in silver mining, which was also limited in the mid-1430s.

===Currency—the recognition of silver===
By the end of the Xuande era, the government had recognized the failure to enforce &quot;baochao&quot; banknotes as the main currency and began tolerating silver. In 1433, Governor of South Zhili, Zhou Chen (), introduced the payment of land tax in silver instead of rice in the most tax-burdened prefectures. From 1436, the officers of the Beijing garrison were paid in silver. In the same year, the land tax in South Zhili, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Huguang was also converted to silver; this transition was accompanied by a tax cut. According to historian Ray Huang, this was a concession to southern landowners and a reversal from the Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s policy of suppressing the influence of wealthy landowners. Another historian, Richard Von Glahn, believes that it was an attempt to get the rich people&#x27;s silver out of their coffers. Additionally, the government reduced silver mining to a minimum.

After Wang Zhen gained influence in the government, the eunuchs pushed for the reopening of the silver mines under their supervision, but due to the low productivity of mining and the high demands of the eunuchs, there were a series of mining uprisings in Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi. After Emperor Yingzong was captured in a war with the Mongols in 1449, the new government restricted mining once again, but when Emperor Yingzong returned to power in 1457, the restrictions were lifted. Despite this, mining yields remained low.

The government&#x27;s decision to allow payment in silver resulted in the rapid decline of banknotes, much to the dismay of the statesmen. By the 1430s, banknotes had practically disappeared from use, with the state only using them to pay employees to a limited extent and withdrawing them as a compulsory payment for trade fees. However, these small transactions were relatively isolated from the country&#x27;s economy. While silver was used for large payments and taxes, copper coins remained the dominant currency for small transactions in cities.

===Closure of state mints===
In 1436, the Minister of Revenue proposed to buy out old banknotes and replace them with new ones covered in silver, but this proposal was ultimately unsuccessful. Around the same time (in the mid-1430s), the government began to tolerate the use of coins in commerce, although their prohibition was not consistently enforced even before this time. While the use of coins was officially not allowed until 1436, in response to a petition from a prefect of Guangxi, the government had actually stopped the production of coins in either 1433 or 1436.

With the closure of the mints, the shortage of coins worsened over time. Entrepreneurs responded to the demand for coins by producing them privately, which was illegal. Despite the efforts of disgruntled officials in Beijing, they were unable to suppress this private production, but they also did not take action to restore the state&#x27;s coin production.

In the northern cities, particularly Beijing, coins were the primary form of currency during the 15th century. This led officials to criticize them as the reason for the failure of banknotes. In 1447, the Governor of North Zhili called for a renewed campaign against coinage, citing its exclusive use in trade in Beijing and the Grand Canal cities as the cause of the banknotes&#x27; failure. Despite efforts by his successor to lift the ban, the Ministry of Revenue continued to prohibit coinage until 1453. By the mid-1450s, private coins from Jiangnan had become more prevalent in the markets of Beijing, replacing Yongle&#x27;s coins. Suggestions to combat private coinage by opening state mints were rejected, leading to the proliferation of illegal mints. These private coins were of lower quality, often containing tin or iron, but due to the scarcity of old coins, merchants had no choice but to use them, even at a nominal value. Some merchants refused to accept Ming coins altogether, while others only accepted silver. The shortage of currency resulted in a return to barter in certain regions, including Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Huguang, Shaanxi, and Shanxi.

Private mints in Ming China also had an impact on foreign trade, as their coins were accepted as currency in other countries, despite the Chinese government&#x27;s refusal to recognize them. The closure of these mints had far-reaching consequences, causing problems in places like Japan and Java. Japan, which had not minted coins since the 10th century, relied heavily on imports from China. The disruption of this supply in the early 15th century had a significant impact on the Japanese economy and even led to political turmoil, resulting in the division of Japan into competing domains during the Sengoku period.

==Fighting in the South==
===War in the Southwest===

In the first quarter of the 15th century, on the southwestern borders of the Ming dynasty, one of the Shan states, Möng Mao, called Luchuan by the Ming, grew in strength under the rule of the ambitious Si Renfa, who ruled from 1413. By 1436, Si Renfa had begun to pose a threat to Ming positions in the area. In 1438, Mu Sheng, the military commander of Yunnan, was ordered to attack Möng Mao with an army of conscripts from Guizhou and Huguang. Initially, the Ming army was successful in defeating the enemy, but they soon encountered supply problems and struggled to adapt to the subtropical climate. As a result, the weakened Ming army suffered a heavy defeat in 1440.

Wang Zhen believed that Grand Empress Dowager Zhang&#x27;s tax policy was too lenient and saw the war as an opportunity to increase state revenue. As a result, he pushed for a new campaign to be launched. Reinforcements were sent from Sichuan, Guizhou, and Huguang to Yunnan, and in early 1441, Minister of War Wang Ji was placed in overall command. Wang Ji was an experienced civil official who had held the position of Minister of War since 1435. He had also commanded the second to fourth campaigns in the Luchuan–Pingmian campaigns from 1441 to 1449. This was the first time in the history of the Ming dynasty that a civil official was given supreme command of the troops. Under Wang Ji&#x27;s leadership, a Ming army of 50,000 soldiers successfully defeated the Shans. Si Renfa was captured by the Burmese state and the Ming ally of Ava, and the territory of Luchuan was divided among other Shan states. As a reward for his success, Wang Ji was promoted to the rank of Count of Jingyuan, and his deputy Xu Xi took over as Minister of War. Any criticism that resources were being drained from the North to fund the war in the South was suppressed.

In 1443–1444 and 1445, the war continued with Ming troops unsuccessfully fighting against Ava. Another campaign took place in 1448–1449, during which the Chinese and Ava successfully defeated Si Renfa&#x27;s son, Si Jifa, who resided in Mong Yang west of the Irrawaddy River. In March 1449, Emperor Yingzong celebrated the victory.

These wars ultimately solidified Ming power in Yunnan, but at a high cost. Local rulers acknowledged Ming sovereignty and paid tribute to Beijing until the 16th century. Domestically, these wars were a success for Wang Zhen, increasing his prestige and reputation as a statesman, but they also revealed a lack of financial reserves and experienced generals on the northern frontier.

===Rebellion in the Southeast===

In response to the increased demand for silver due to the implementation of silver-based taxes in 1436, the government took action by shutting down silver mines and prohibiting small-scale silver mining along the border of Zhejiang and Fujian two years later. However, in an area with a high population and limited job opportunities, illegal silver mining persisted. In 1447, the leader of a group of silver miners in the mountains between Zhejiang and Fujian openly rebelled, gathering followers and forming an army.

In the interior of Fujian, two brothers, Deng Maoqi () and Deng Maoba (), opposed the exploitation of tenants. The tenants themselves demanded that landlords cancel payments beyond the scope of their leases. In March 1448, the Deng brothers rebelled and began to conquer one county after another. The government attempted to calm the situation by forgiving unpaid taxes and granting a three-year exemption from compulsory labor for the population in the region, but the more radical faction of the rebels, numbering several hundred thousand men, refused to back down. The local militia was unable to handle the situation, prompting the government to send an army of 50,000 to the southeast in September 1448.

In late 1448, the rebel miners were defeated by troops on the border between Fujian and Jiangsu. The Deng brothers were captured in February 1449, and their successors were defeated in May of the same year. According to Japanese historian Tanaka Masayoshi, the Deng brothers&#x27; revolt was the first Chinese peasant uprising aimed at challenging class relations within the village. The miners&#x27; revolt was ultimately suppressed by August 1449, and the remaining Fujian rebels were dispersed by 1452.

The emperor&#x27;s successes in the southeast and southwest may have led him to overestimate the strength of the Ming troops and his own willingness to personally lead the army.

==Trouble in the North==
===Relations with the Mongols===
The Mongols were divided into three main groups: the Uriankhai in the southeast, the Eastern Mongols (also known as Tatars) in the east, and the Oirats in the west. In 1434, the leader of the Eastern Mongols, Arughtai, was defeated in battle by the Oirats. This gave the Oirats control over Mongolia, and their chief Toghon solidified their power by arranging for his daughter to marry the young Khan of the Eastern Mongols, Toghtoa Bukha. After Toghon&#x27;s death in 1440, his son Esen took over as &quot;de facto ruler of all Mongols&quot;. Esen was more ambitious than his father, and in 1443 and 1445, he launched attacks on Hami, an important city on the route from China to Central Asia near the Chinese border. In 1448, he successfully conquered it. He also attempted to gain the support of the Mongol divisions in the Ming army in western Gansu. In the east, his authority extended to the borders of Korea. In Beijing, the unification of Mongolia was perceived as a threat by Wang Zhen&#x27;s opponents.

The Mongols were primarily interested in free trade with China, specifically exchanging horses for luxury goods such as tea and silk. Some Mongols who resided along the border relied on agriculture for their livelihood and sought support from the Ming authorities, but the Ming government focused on trading tea for horses in Gansu, with tribes in present-day Qinghai, rather than on the border with the Mongols. This trade involved exchanging a million &quot;jin&quot; (258 tons) of tea for 14 thousand horses every three years. The Ming authorities tightly regulated and restricted trade with the Mongols, with Wang Zhen overseeing the profitable trade through a network of eunuch-trustees in border towns.

As Essen&#x27;s power grew, so did his need for goods in order to maintain the loyalty of the Mongol tribes. This resulted in protests from the Chinese, who were concerned about the increasing influx of Mongols. By the late 1440s, up to two thousand Mongols were arriving in Datong, the main trading center, every year. The presence of such large groups of armed horsemen posed a security threat. This caused the Ming authorities to become increasingly hostile and fearful. In 1449, the Mongols were only given a fifth of the required goods, which led them to resort to force. The immediate cause of the war was Ming&#x27;s refusal to grant Esen&#x27;s request to marry an imperial princess for his son.

===Defense of the Northeast===
After the death of the Yongle Emperor, the state of defense along the northern borders began to deteriorate gradually. The quality of training, as well as the weapons and equipment, were declining. In fact, soldiers from the Beijing garrison were even being used for the construction of government and private buildings. At this time, the Great Wall had not yet been built, and the border was only guarded by patrol battalions. These battalions were expected to hold off the enemy until the main forces arrived, according to the plans. The main forces were located in three fortified cities—Xuanfu, Datong, and Beijing—each housing several tens of thousands of soldiers. The largest force, consisting of 160,000 men, was stationed in Beijing. The reserves were scattered throughout northeastern China, in North Zhili, Shandong, and Henan. However, since Xuanfu was less than 200 km from Beijing, the defense system lacked depth and relied on a quick and decisive response to any potential attack.

===Tumu Crisis===

In the summer of 1449, unrest was spreading on the northern border. On 20 July, news arrived of a Mongol raid led by Esen. In response, the emperor ordered four generals and 45,000 soldiers from the Beijing garrison to advance to Datong and Xuanfu to guard the border. On 30 July, news reached Beijing that the Mongols had launched a large-scale invasion and had already attacked Datong. Without consulting the government, Emperor Yingzong ordered the Beijing garrison to be mobilized on 1 August and decided to personally lead the campaign against the Mongols. This decision was met with protest from Minister of War, Kuang Ye (), and his deputy, Yu Qian. Later, Minister of Personnel, Wang Zhi (), also joined in the protest on behalf of a number of concerned officials. They believed that the emperor&#x27;s participation in the expedition was an unacceptably risky adventure. Emperor Yingzong defended his decision by citing precedents—all previous Ming emperors, except for the Jianwen Emperor, had personally led armies into battle.

On 3 August, the emperor entrusted his younger brother, Zhu Qiyu, with the provisional administration of Beijing and departed the city on 4 August. However, due to a storm, he arrived at Xuanfu seven days later. The emperor was accompanied by 20 experienced generals, most of whom held noble titles, and an equal number of high-ranking officials. They were also accompanied by hundreds of lower-ranking dignitaries. While the number of mobilized soldiers is unknown, it is often estimated to be around half a million, but this number is likely an exaggeration from a single contemporary source, as the actual number was likely much lower. Even under optimal conditions, it would have been difficult to supply such a large army. The troops were hastily assembled, poorly prepared, and incompetently led. Despite pleas from many members of his entourage to turn back, Wang Zhen advised the emperor to continue on. The army reached Datong on 18 August, with more soldiers dying from starvation during the journey than from skirmishes with Mongol troops. Two days later, Emperor Yingzong finally issued the order to return. Upon reaching Xuanfu on 30 August, the emperor learned that the rearguard had been defeated by the Mongols and that the auxiliary detachment of 40,000 men had been completely destroyed. The next evening, the army camped at the Tumu post station, without a source of water.

On the morning of 1 September, 20,000 Mongols launched a surprise attack on the Ming army, resulting in their defeat. Due to hunger and thirst, the Ming soldiers were unable to put up much resistance and only a few high-ranking officials were able to escape. Among the casualties were Wang Zhen, two dukes, two marquises, five counts, several generals, and hundreds of officials. The emperor was captured and on 3 September was sent to Esen&#x27;s main camp near Xuanfu. After reclaiming the area, the Ming troops recovered tens of thousands of firearms, armor, and other equipment. Despite their initial success, the Mongols failed in their attempts to occupy Xuanfu and Datong by using the captured Emperor Yingzong. They were also unsuccessful in their pursuit of Beijing and eventually retreated back to the steppe in November 1449. The Ming government restored the border but did not take any further offensive action.

Historians at the time, in an effort to avoid what is an obvious taboo of the country&#x27;s head of state becoming a prisoner of war, referred to this chapter of Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s life as the &quot;Northern Hunt&quot; ().

In Chinese historiography, the consequences of the Tumu crisis are often referred to as &quot;Tumu zhi bian&quot;. The term &quot;bian&quot; means &quot;to turn&quot; and is used to denote important turning points in Chinese history. As Charles Patrick Fitzgerald writes:
==Captivity, return and house arrest==
After news of the emperor&#x27;s capture reached Beijing, Empress Dowager Sun, Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s mother, proclaimed the emperor&#x27;s two-year-old son, Zhu Jianshen, as crown prince. She also appointed the emperor&#x27;s brother, Zhu Qiyu, to administer the country. Officials demanded punishment for the followers of Wang Zhen, whom they believed were responsible for the disaster, but when Zhu Qiyu refused, the officials became angry and killed two of Wang&#x27;s allies. At the insistence of Yu Qian, Zhu Qiyu eventually agreed to confiscate Wang Zhen&#x27;s fortune and execute his relatives. Yu Qian was then appointed as Minister of War and successfully stabilized the situation by organizing the defense of Beijing with a new army. On 17 September, Zhu Qiyu ascended the throne as the Jingtai Emperor and declared the captured brother as &quot;Taishang Huangdi&quot; (; &#x27;Emperor Emeritus&#x27;).

The new Jingtai regime aimed to discredit the previous ruler, who had been deemed a failure. Border commanders were instructed not to communicate with him. Esen attempted to secure the release of the former ruler and sent two delegations to China to negotiate his return. However, it was not until September 1450 that Emperor Yingzong was successfully returned. During his twelve and a half months in captivity, he was treated fairly by the Oirats and returned to China as their friend.

On 19 September, Emperor Yingzong arrived in Beijing. Officials were forbidden to greet him, and only two or three people were sent to meet him with a sedan chair and two horses. The Jingtai Emperor met him at the side door of the palace, and Emperor Yingzong renounced all claims to the throne. He was then assigned to the Southern Palace in the southeast of the Forbidden City, where he spent the next six and a half years as a virtual prisoner. His wives also lived with him there, and during this time, he fathered three sons (fifth to seventh). However, the living conditions were poor and the supply of resources was limited. Despite this, officials still requested permission to congratulate Emperor Yingzong on his birthday every year, but the government consistently refused.

On the night of 11 February 1457, the quiet atmosphere of the Southern Palace was abruptly shattered by a group of soldiers who forcefully entered the building, announcing to the former emperor that he had been reinstated and bringing him to the throne room. This coup was orchestrated by a small group, led by the eunuch-general Cao Jixiang (), along with generals Shi Heng (), Zhang Yue (), and strategist Xu Youzhen (). The initial invasion of the Southern Palace was carried out by 400 men, primarily consisting of Mongols. Later, an additional 2,800 men joined, with half of them escorting the emperor and the other half occupying strategic locations in Beijing. The conspirators had contacted Emperor Yingzong two days prior to the coup, although there is another version that suggests it was a surprise for him. This event became known as the &quot;duomen&quot;—&quot;forcing the palace gate&quot;, but later this name was considered too vulgar and the term &quot;fubi&quot;—&quot;restoration of the throne&quot;—began to be used.

== Second reign==
The emperor initially honored and promoted the organizers of the coup, but once he solidified his position as the leader of the government, he gradually removed them one by one. Xu Youzhen was dismissed in August 1457, Shi Heng died in prison in February 1460, and Cao Jixiang and his family were executed for treason in August 1461. The new regime wasted no time in purging the Jingtai Emperor&#x27;s followers, many of whom were innocent, such as Yu Qian. Even the deposed Jingtai Emperor was likely strangled and his reputation tarnished. In contrast, Wang Zhen was given an official burial, a statue in the Zhihua Temple, and the posthumous name &quot;Jingzhong&quot; (). These purges only served to make Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s regime unpopular. In an attempt to improve his image, the emperor appointed respected scholars Xue Xuan () and Li Xian () to the Grand Secretariat. In late June 1457, Shi Heng and Cao Jixiang decided that they no longer needed the cooperation of Xu Youzhen, who headed the Grand Secretariat, and had him arrested and banished to Yunnan. This move prompted the resignation of Xue Xuan and Minister of Justice Xuan Ni in protest.

In early 1460, mutual accusations and arrests led to the death of Shi Heng. Fearing a similar fate, Cao Jixiang and his adopted son Cao Qin planned a rebellion. In August 1461, General Cao Qin, along with the Mongol troops under his command, rose up in rebellion. The immediate cause of this uprising was the death of the head of Imperial Guard who was investigating Cao&#x27;s illegal business dealings with the Mongols. The rebel troops, led by Cao, set fire to both the west and east gates of the imperial city, but the flames were quickly extinguished by rain once the fighting began. They also killed several ministers before eventually surrendering to government troops. After the rebellion was defeated, Cao Qin committed suicide.

After the suppression of Cao&#x27;s rebellion, the government returned to a state of calm. Li Xian took charge of the Grand Secretariat with support from Peng Shi, while Wang Ao, Minister of Personnel, oversaw the outer court and ensured the quality of officials. The government remained stable in the subsequent years, with ministers and Grand Secretaries serving until their death or retirement.

Despite this, there were frequent conflicts between natives from the northern and southern regions of China. Until 1449, northerners were given preferential treatment, which was criticized by some as being influenced by Wang Zhen&#x27;s pro-northern bias. During the reign of the Jingtai Emperor from 1449 to 1457, many southerners were able to advance in their careers, but after the restoration, the influence of southerners decreased. In fact, the Jingtai Emperor relied heavily on the advice of Li Xian, a prominent Grand Secretary from Henan who was known for his support of the northern party and tendency to favor northerners in appointments.

During his second reign, Emperor Yingzong was actively involved in managing the government, starting his day early and attending to state affairs and correspondence daily. He was known for his compassion and, as a result, he abolished the practice of concubines committing suicide after the deaths of the emperors. In 1457, he also granted freedom to Zhu Wengui, the son of the Jianwen Emperor (who reigned from 1398 to 1402) who had been imprisoned in Nanjing since his father&#x27;s overthrow in 1402.

Emperor Yingzong died on 23 February 1464 after a brief illness. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Zhu Jianshen, who became the Chenghua Emperor. The relationship between Emperor Yingzong and Zhu Jianshen was strained, as the father had doubts about his son&#x27;s ability to rule. It was only after the Grand Secretaries, led by Li Xian, convinced him to preserve the succession of his eldest son that he agreed.

==Family==

Emperor Yingzong had multiple wives, including Lady Qian who became his empress when they married in 1442. After Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s death, Lady Qian became the empress dowager and died in 1468. Empress Qian was unable to bear children, so upon Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s death, his son Zhu Jianshen, born to Lady Zhou, one of his concubines, ascended to the throne. Lady Zhou was given the title of empress dowager after her son&#x27;s ascension, but she still harbored jealousy towards Lady Qian. She died in 1504.

<doc id="573452" wikidata="Q833293" url="?curid=573452" title="Trapezoidal rule">
<text>In calculus, the trapezoidal rule (also known as the trapezoid rule or trapezium rule) is a technique for numerical integration, i.e., approximating the definite integral:
formula_1

The trapezoidal rule works by approximating the region under the graph of the function
formula_2 as a trapezoid and calculating its area. It follows that
formula_3
The trapezoidal rule may be viewed as the result obtained by averaging the left and right Riemann sums, and is sometimes defined this way. The integral can be even better approximated by partitioning the integration interval, applying the trapezoidal rule to each subinterval, and summing the results. In practice, this &quot;chained&quot; (or &quot;composite&quot;) trapezoidal rule is usually what is meant by &quot;integrating with the trapezoidal rule&quot;. Let formula_4 be a partition of formula_5 such that formula_6 and formula_7 be the length of the formula_8-th subinterval (that is, formula_9), then 
formula_10
When the partition has a regular spacing, as is often the case, that is, when all the formula_7 have the same value formula_12 the formula can be simplified for calculation efficiency by factoring formula_13 out:.
formula_14

The approximation becomes more accurate as the resolution of the partition increases (that is, for larger formula_15, all formula_7 decrease).

As discussed below, it is also possible to place error bounds on the accuracy of the value of a definite integral estimated using a trapezoidal rule.
== History ==
A 2016 &quot;Science&quot; paper reports that the trapezoid rule was in use in Babylon before 50 BCE for integrating the velocity of Jupiter along the ecliptic.

== Numerical implementation ==

=== Non-uniform grid ===
When the grid spacing is non-uniform, one can use the formula
formula_17
wherein formula_18

=== Uniform grid ===
For a domain discretized into formula_15 equally spaced panels, considerable simplification may occur. Let
formula_20
the approximation to the integral becomes
formula_21

==Error analysis==

The error of the composite trapezoidal rule is the difference between the value of the integral and the numerical result:
formula_22

There exists a number &quot;ξ&quot; between &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, such that
formula_23

It follows that if the integrand is concave up (and thus has a positive second derivative), then the error is negative and the trapezoidal rule overestimates the true value. This can also be seen from the geometric picture: the trapezoids include all of the area under the curve and extend over it. Similarly, a concave-down function yields an underestimate because area is unaccounted for under the curve, but none is counted above. If the interval of the integral being approximated includes an inflection point, the sign of the error is harder to identify.

An asymptotic error estimate for &quot;N&quot; → ∞ is given by
formula_24
Further terms in this error estimate are given by the Euler–Maclaurin summation formula.

Several techniques can be used to analyze the error, including:
#Fourier series
#Residue calculus
#Euler–Maclaurin summation formula
#Polynomial interpolation

It is argued that the speed of convergence of the trapezoidal rule reflects and can be used as a definition of classes of smoothness of the functions.

=== Proof ===
First suppose that formula_25 and formula_26. Let formula_27 be the function such that formula_28 is the error of the trapezoidal rule on one of the intervals, formula_29. Then
formula_30
and
formula_31

Now suppose that formula_32 which holds if formula_33 is sufficiently smooth. It then follows that
formula_34
which is equivalent to
formula_35, or formula_36

Since formula_37 and formula_38,
formula_39 and formula_40

Using these results, we find
formula_41
and
formula_42

Letting formula_43 we find
formula_44

Summing all of the local error terms we find
formula_45

But we also have
formula_46
and
formula_47

so that

formula_48

Therefore the total error is bounded by

formula_49

=== Periodic and peak functions ===
The trapezoidal rule converges rapidly for periodic functions. This is an easy consequence of the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula, which says that
if formula_50 is formula_51 times continuously differentiable with period formula_52
formula_53
where formula_54 and formula_55 is the periodic extension of the formula_51th Bernoulli polynomial. Due to the periodicity, the derivatives at the endpoint cancel and we see that the error is formula_57.

A similar effect is available for peak-like functions, such as Gaussian, Exponentially modified Gaussian and other functions with derivatives at integration limits that can be neglected. The evaluation of the full integral of a Gaussian function by trapezoidal rule with 1% accuracy can be made using just 4 points. Simpson&#x27;s rule requires 1.8 times more points to achieve the same accuracy.

Although some effort has been made to extend the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula to higher dimensions, the most straightforward proof of the rapid convergence of the trapezoidal rule in higher dimensions is to reduce the problem to that of convergence of Fourier series. This line of reasoning shows that if formula_50 is periodic on a formula_59-dimensional space with formula_51 continuous derivatives, the speed of convergence is formula_61. For very large dimension, the shows that Monte-Carlo integration is most likely a better choice, but for 2 and 3 dimensions, equispaced sampling is efficient. This is exploited in computational solid state physics where equispaced sampling over primitive cells in the reciprocal lattice is known as &quot;Monkhorst-Pack integration&quot;.

=== &quot;Rough&quot; functions ===
For functions that are not in &quot;C&quot;2, the error bound given above is not applicable. Still, error bounds for such rough functions can be derived, which typically show a slower convergence with the number of function evaluations formula_15 than the formula_63 behaviour given above. Interestingly, in this case the trapezoidal rule often has sharper bounds than Simpson&#x27;s rule for the same number of function evaluations.

== Applicability and alternatives ==
The trapezoidal rule is one of a family of formulas for numerical integration called Newton–Cotes formulas, of which the midpoint rule is similar to the trapezoid rule. Simpson&#x27;s rule is another member of the same family, and in general has faster convergence than the trapezoidal rule for functions which are twice continuously differentiable, though not in all specific cases. However, for various classes of rougher functions (ones with weaker smoothness conditions), the trapezoidal rule has faster convergence in general than Simpson&#x27;s rule.

Moreover, the trapezoidal rule tends to become extremely accurate when periodic functions are integrated over their periods, which can be analyzed in various ways. A similar effect is available for peak functions.

For non-periodic functions, however, methods with unequally spaced points such as Gaussian quadrature and Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature are generally far more accurate; Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature can be viewed as a change of variables to express arbitrary integrals in terms of periodic integrals, at which point the trapezoidal rule can be applied accurately.

==Example==
The following integral is given: 
formula_64 

Solution 
 \approx \frac{b - a}{2n}\left\lbrack f(a) + 2\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1}{f(a + {ih})} + f(b) \right\rbrack &lt;/math&gt; 
formula_65 
Using the composite trapezoidal rule formula
formula_66 
formula_67 
| The exact value of the above integral can be found by integration by parts and is 
formula_68 
So the true error is
formula_69 
| The absolute relative true error is
formula_70

<text>Shawinigan (; ) is a city located on the Saint-Maurice River in the Mauricie area in Quebec, Canada. It had a population of 49,620 as of the 2021 Canadian census.

Shawinigan is also a territory equivalent to a regional county municipality (TE) and census division (CD) of Quebec, coextensive with the city of Shawinigan. Its geographical code is 36. Shawinigan is the seat of the judicial district of Saint-Maurice.

The name Shawinigan has had numerous spellings over time: Chaouinigane, Oshaouinigane, Assaouinigane, Achawénégan, Chawinigame, Shawenigane, Chaouénigane. It may mean &quot;south portage&quot;, &quot;portage of beeches&quot;, &quot;angular portage&quot;, or &quot;summit&quot; or &quot;crest&quot;. Before 1958, the city was known as Shawinigan Falls.

Shawinigan is the birthplace of former Prime Minister of Canada Jean Chrétien.

==History==

In 1651, the Jesuit priest Buteaux was the first European known to have travelled up the Saint-Maurice River to this river&#x27;s first set of great falls. Afterwards, missionaries going to the Upper Saint-Maurice would rest here. Before Shawinigan Falls was established, the local economy had been largely based on lumber and agriculture.

===Boomtown===

In the late 1890s, Shawinigan Falls drew the interest of foreign entrepreneurs such as John Joyce and John Edward Aldred of the Shawinigan Water &amp; Power Company (SW&amp;P), and of Hubert Biermans of the Belgo Canadian Pulp &amp; Paper Company because of its particular geographic situation. Its falls had the potential to become a favorable location for the production of hydroelectricity.

In 1899, the SW&amp;P commissioned Montreal engineering firm Pringle and Son to design a grid plan for a new industrial town on the banks of the Saint-Maurice River, providing the ground work for what would become Downtown Shawinigan.

In 1901, the place was incorporated as the Village Municipality of Shawinigan Falls and gained town (&quot;ville&quot;) status a year later in 1902. The hydro-electric generating station contributed to rapid economic growth and the town achieved several firsts in Canadian history: first production of aluminum (1901), carborundum (1908), cellophane pellets (1932). Shawinigan Falls also became one of the first Canadian cities with electric street lighting.

===Urban Growth===
For decades, the local pulp and paper, chemical and textile industries created thousands of jobs and stimulated city growth (see Sketch Map of Urban in Shawinigan, 1899-1951).

Urban development steadily increased in Downtown Shawinigan Falls. By 1921, this sector was densely filled with commercial buildings on Fourth and Fifth street, as well as Station Avenue, one-family residences along the Riverside corridor (current-day St-Maurice Drive) and multi-story tenements elsewhere.

The Olmsted Brothers design firm was hired by the city to implement a beautification program. By the late 1920s, Downtown Shawinigan Falls was home to a public market, a fire station, a technical school, several church buildings and two landscaped public parks, including the Saint-Maurice Park.

Many of the opulent uphill homes located in the somewhat secluded areas of Maple Street and Hemlock Avenue were occupied by more affluent people, many of whom happened to belong to the once vibrant English-speaking community, which at times comprised more than 30% of the local population.

As industrial plants began operation eastward and northward, neighbourhoods were established in Uptown Shawinigan Falls. The emergence of these new districts was defined by and intertwined with the parish structure of the Roman Catholic Church. The Saint-Marc neighbourhood, originally known as Village St-Onge, was annexed in 1902, extending the city limits to Dufresne Street. The uptown presence of the Canadian Carborundum and Alcan no. Two plants favoured the foundation the Christ-Roi neighbourhood, which was annexed in 1925 extending the city limits to St Sacrement Boulevard. The land now occupied by the section of town currently known as Shawinigan-Est was annexed in 1932.

Uptown Shawinigan Falls had its own fire station by 1922 and its own landscaped public park and swimming pool by 1940.

Westside near the Shawinigan River, the existence of the pulp and paper Belgo plant attracted enough residents to form a small, yet stable independent urban community called Baie-de-Shawinigan.

Across the Saint-Maurice River, Shawinigan-Sud (then Almaville) maintained home-rule and developed as a residential hub.

===Great Depression===

Local prosperity was interrupted by the Great Depression in the 1930s. Many plants were forced to temporarily reduce or stop their production, which left many residents jobless. Many families needed public assistance to survive. The City Council enacted a public works program to help families.

The promenade along the Saint-Maurice River was a project to create work during the depression.

===World War II===

World War II put Shawinigan Falls, and many others cities in Canada, back on the path of economic recovery.

During hostilities, the windows of local power plants were painted black to prevent any possible German aerial attack.

The Shawinigan-based 81st Artillery Battery was called to active duty during World War II. Its members were trained in Ontario and the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1944 and contributed to the Allies&#x27; effort in the Normandy Landings in 1944-45, which led to the Liberation of France.

In 1948, a cenotaph, known as Monument des Braves, was erected in downtown Shawinigan Falls at the intersection of Fourth Street and Promenade du Saint-Maurice (then Riverside Street) near the Saint-Maurice River, in honour of soldiers who died during that conflict as well as World War I.

===Rise of the working class===

By the early 1950s, the industrial growth in Shawinigan Falls was such that the city offered the steadiest employment and the highest wages in Quebec. Due to this advantageous position, Shawinigan Falls became a hot bed for organized labor and bargaining power. The rise of its working class also favoured the presence of numerous independently owned taverns.

====Labour unions====

As its working class gained economic ground and political leverage, Shawinigan Falls became fertile ground for labour unions. The workers of the Belgo pulp and paper plant went on strike in 1955. In the 1952 provincial election, Shawinigan sent a Liberal member to the legislature. The gesture was largely considered an affront to Premier Maurice Duplessis, who responded by refusing to approve the construction of a new bridge between Shawinigan Falls and Shawinigan-Sud. The new bridge was not built until after the Liberal Party won the 1960 election. It was completed on September 2, 1962.

====Taverns====

In the 1950s, a number of taverns provided a male-only social environment for industrial workers. They were mostly concentrated in Downtown Shawinigan Falls (Saint-Bernard and Saint-Pierre), as well as in the Saint-Marc neighbourhood, as Shawinigan-Sud remained a dry town until 1961, and included the following venues:

In 1951, the local tavern keepers formed a business association.

In 1981, the provincial government enacted a law that gave women access to most taverns. By 1986, women had already been admitted in most taverns.

While a handful of local taverns evolved into bistros or restaurants, most of them did not survive the industrial decline that characterized the last third of the 20th Century.

===Decline===

In the 1950s, Shawinigan Falls entered a period of decline that would last for several decades. Technological improvements made industries less dependent on Shawinigan Falls&#x27; geographic location. Therefore, many employers would relocate to nearby larger cities or close down.

In 1958, it received city (&quot;cité&quot;) status, and its name was abbreviated to just Shawinigan.

As a reaction to declining opportunities, many residents, many of whom were English-speakers, left the area. Shawinigan High School is the only remaining English-language school in the city following the closure of St. Patrick&#x27;s (closed circa 1983). Shawinigan&#x27;s last English-language newspaper, the Shawinigan Standard, ceased publication at the end of 1970.

In 1963, the provincial government of Jean Lesage nationalized eleven privately owned electricity companies, including SW&amp;P. While benefiting the population in general, the decision may have been damaging to local interests.

===Emerging hospitality industry===

In order to offset the decline of the heavy industry, leaders have promoted the expansion of the local hospitality industry. The most notable example of that initiative is the establishment of La Cité de l&#x27;Énergie, a theme park based on local industrial history, with a observation tower. Since it opened in 1997, it has attracted thousands of visitors to the area. It currently hosts bus tours and cruises, as well as entertainment shows and interactive exhibits. Since 2012, it is also home to the Museum of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, a venue similar to those operated by the U.S. presidential library system and which focuses on the gifts received by the former Prime Minister of Canada (1993-2003) during his official duties.

===Mergers===

 In 1998, Shawinigan merged with the Village Municipality of Baie-de-Shawinigan.

On January 1, 2002, Shawinigan amalgamated with much of the Regional County Municipality of Le Centre-de-la-Mauricie. The following municipalities were part of the merger:

<doc id="573460" wikidata="Q2667921" url="?curid=573460" title="Space Ghost Coast to Coast">
<text>Space Ghost Coast to Coast is an American adult animated television series created by Mike Lazzo for Cartoon Network and first broadcast in 1994. It takes the form of a surreal parody of talk shows, hosted by a reimagined version of the Hanna-Barbera character Space Ghost. It incorporates surrealism and non-sequitur humor.

&quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; is the first TV show produced by Williams Street (formerly known as Ghost Planet Industries), which started Adult Swim in the early 2000s. It contrasts the original 1960s series, &quot;Space Ghost&quot;, which aired as a standard Hanna-Barbera Saturday-morning superhero cartoon.

&quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; is one of the first original series produced for Cartoon Network, and the earliest not to broadcast pre-existing cartoons. It premiered on April 15, 1994, and originally ended on December 17, 1999. It was revived on May 7, 2001, and was moved to the new Adult Swim late-night programming block on September 2, where new episodes premiered until April 12, 2004. Two final seasons were released exclusively on GameTap from 2006 to 2008. 109 episodes were aired over 11 seasons.

&quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; helped launch the careers of the animators Adam Reed, Matt Thompson, Andy Merrill, Jim Fortier, Pete Smith, Michael Ouweleen, Erik Richter, Dave Willis, and Matt Maiellaro. It produced the spin-offs &quot;The Brak Show&quot;, &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, &quot;Perfect Hair Forever&quot;, and &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law.&quot; The series inspired or influenced other series for Adult Swim, including &quot;Sealab 2021&quot; and &quot;The Eric Andre Show&quot;.

== Premise ==

&quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; uses a subverted talk show format hosted by Space Ghost as he interviews live-action guest stars, whom Space Ghost believes to be fellow superheroes, appearing on a monitor beside Space Ghost&#x27;s desk. In early episodes, Space Ghost begins his interviews by asking guests about their superpowers. His interactions with guests can be awkward because the guests&#x27; answers are often changed to humorously match Space Ghost&#x27;s questions in post-production. Later episodes feature guests being allowed to interact directly with the characters. Although he starts out more level-headed and very much resembling his superhero ways, he becomes more and more eccentric, egomaniacal and idiotic with how he manages the show and treats his guests.

Space Ghost&#x27;s bandleader, an evil talking mantis named Zorak, and his director-producer, a red-helmeted lava man named Moltar, work forced unpaid labor for Space Ghost, ostensibly as punishment for their crimes committed on the original series. Because of their history as enemies of Space Ghost, they never get along with him even as co-workers and often make it very clear that they hate him and disrupt the show as retaliation for their forced labor. Zorak is especially hateful towards Space Ghost due to being his arch-enemy, whereas Moltar just puts up with being forced to do the show against his will, but will chime in to antagonize Space Ghost from time to time alongside Zorak.

=== Songs ===
Early seasons feature music played by Zorak and his band &quot;The Original Way-Outs&quot;. The original theme song, &quot;Hit Single&quot;, was composed by free jazz guitarist Sonny Sharrock and performed by Sharrock on guitar, Lance Carter on drums, Eddie Horst on bass, and Alfreda Gerald on vocals. Sharrock and Carter recorded songs for the show that were later compiled on the album &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;. As a tribute to Sharrock, who died in May 1994 shortly after the show first aired, the episode &quot;Sharrock&quot; featured fifteen minutes of unedited takes of music recorded for the show.

Seasons 4–6 feature a new closing theme by Man or Astro-man?, and in later seasons the opening theme and titles were nearly abandoned. Alternate songs are sometimes used as theme music, including the &quot;CHiPs&quot; theme song for the episode titled &quot;CHiPs&quot;. An hour-long musical season finale featuring the bands Yo La Tengo and Cornershop was planned for the 1998 season but never produced.

== Production ==
=== Original run ===
&quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; was created by Mike Lazzo after he was asked to develop a cartoon to appeal to adults. The series&#x27; original title stemmed from early 1993 when Andy Merrill and Jay Edwards were brainstorming names for a marathon of the 1960s &quot;Space Ghost&quot; for Cartoon Network, trying to find things that rhyme with &quot;Ghost&quot;. Because of budget limitations, Ned Hastings recycled clips from the original series and reorganized them on an Avid non-linear editor for a &quot;talk show&quot; style program. The characters&#x27; crudely animated lips, awkward movements that resembled &quot;paper dolls glued to Popsicle sticks&quot;, and continuity errors became part of the joke.

Merrill assembled a proof of concept test pilot in April of 1993, using archival footage of Denzel Washington, and Merrill voiced Space Ghost. The pilot never aired but an edited version later appeared on DVD, with Washington removed.

A second pilot was developed, interviewing Emma Thompson. Gary Owens, who originally voiced Space Ghost in the 1960s show, portrayed the character for the pilot. George Lowe was eventually cast as Space Ghost when &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; was officially picked up. Owens later made a cameo appearance on the show.

The series premiered on April 15, 1994, having aired initially at 11:00 p.m. ET on Friday nights, with an encore showing of the episode on Saturday night. Later, the program was moved to various late-night time slots, usually on weekends. Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim often aired two 11-minute episodes back-to-back with advertisements to make a 30-minute programming block. In its first few years, Cartoon Network showed episodes of the original 1960s and 1980s &quot;Space Ghost&quot; cartoons (sometimes with an added laugh track) after each 11-minute episode of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;.

In February 1995, an episode of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; was simulcast on Cartoon Network, TBS, and TNT for the &quot;World Premiere Toon-In&quot; special debut of Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;World Premiere Toons&quot; series. In the special, Space Ghost interviews a few of the new directors, while the Council of Doom members are the judges of the cartoon clips. The first run ended on December 17, 1999, with the episode &quot;King Dead&quot;.

=== Revivals ===
On September 2, 2001, new episodes and re-runs moved to Cartoon Network&#x27;s late-night programming block Adult Swim during the block&#x27;s premiere. The series ended its television run in 2004 with its 93rd episode, &quot;Live at the Fillmore&quot;. 

In 2006, the series returned as a five-minute web series on Turner Broadcasting&#x27;s GameTap online service, in which Space Ghost interviewed celebrities from the video game industry and GameTap&#x27;s artist of the month. The series officially concluded with the final webisode on May 31, 2008. As of today, it is unknown if Williams Street still have copies of the GameTap episodes after the show later got removed in 2008, following GameTap&#x27;s shutdown in 2010, and Adult Swim has not aired the GameTap seasons, released on home media, nor on any streaming services since. Despite this, almost all of the 17 episodes from the GameTap seasons are found.

On April Fools&#x27; Day 2014, Adult Swim broadcast an unannounced &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; marathon with new material in the form of commercials featuring Space Ghost, Zorak, and Moltar in a voice-recording booth ad-libbing lines from episodes. The series has seen occasional marathons on Adult Swim since, including one on October 22, 2021, in promotion of an Adult Swim tie-in with Carl&#x27;s Jr.

In commemoration of the show&#x27;s 30th anniversary, Adult Swim streamed a 16-episode marathon loop on the Adult Swim YouTube channel. The stream lasted for one month.

== Characters ==
=== Main ===
* Space Ghost (voiced by George Lowe) was a 1960s superhero who fought supervillains in outer space. In the 1990s, he was brought back as a host for his own fictional late-night talk show.
* Zorak (voiced by C. Martin Croker) is the band leader and Space Ghost&#x27;s sidekick. A mantis-like alien, known for his hatred of Space Ghost, he is Brak&#x27;s best friend although he gives him little respect. Though Space Ghost&#x27;s prisoner, Zorak retains his membership in the Council of Doom. He co-hosted &quot;Cartoon Planet&quot; and its revival with Brak.
* Moltar (voiced by C. Martin Croker) is the show&#x27;s director and producer. His body is made entirely of lava, and he normally wears an orange and gray full-body containment suit which has a breathing receptacle. He is defined by two things: his role as the straight man on the show (much to his chagrin), and his passion for the show &quot;CHiPs&quot;, in particular star Erik Estrada.

=== Supporting ===
* Brak (voiced by Andy Merrill) is a somewhat cat-like teenage alien with large fangs who, although a villain, is the weakest and least threatening one on both this program and the earlier &quot;Space Ghost&quot; series. He appeared on SGC2C periodically, often with the Council of Doom, of which he was a member, and was often victimized by Space Ghost. He co-hosted &quot;Cartoon Planet&quot; and its revival with Zorak.
* Tansut (voiced by Don Kennedy) is an overweight and cowardly man in an orange costume and helmet. His outfit makes him appear much more menacing than he actually is. He is a member of the Council of Doom. For about half the episodes of season 4, he announced the show off-screen until he was fired by Space Ghost.
* Lokar (voiced by Andy Merrill) is an erudite, giant hominid locust who is prone to violent outbursts. Lokar seems to harbor a grudge towards Space Ghost, and constantly seeks his destruction, perhaps more for his boorishness than anything else. Lokar is a member of the Council of Doom, though he&#x27;s not so much evil as a snob.
* Chad Ghostal (voiced by Brad Abelle) is Space Ghost&#x27;s evil twin brother. He is a beatnik, with a love for jazz music and outdated beatnik slang, both extremely cool and evil, and he&#x27;s quite the ladies&#x27; man.
* Harvey Birdman (voiced by Scott Finnell) was the host of the show in the episodes &quot;Pilot&quot; and &quot;Sequel&quot;. He then got a job as a lawyer in his own spin-off show &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;.

== Episodes ==

== International broadcast ==
In Canada, &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; previously aired on Teletoon&#x27;s Teletoon at Night block, and periodically airs on the Canadian version of Adult Swim.

== Reception ==
&quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; has received generally positive reviews from critics. In January 2009, &quot;IGN&quot; named &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; as their 37th favorite animated TV show in their Top 100 Best Animated TV Shows article. In 2013, &quot;IGN&quot; placed &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; as number 18 on their list of Top 25 animated series for adults.

Alex Toth, the creator of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;Space Ghost&quot;, was rumored to have been displeased with the usage of his characters in parody, but Toth wrote letters in which he admitted to appreciating all adaptations of his work.

In a 2012 interview, Eric André mentioned being a big fan of the show, stating it was a major influence on him while developing his own series for Adult Swim, &quot;The Eric Andre Show&quot;. Before shooting Andre would rewatch several episodes of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; in a row in order to &quot;absorb as much &quot;Space Ghost&quot;&quot; as he could. Andre would also ask executive producer and Adult Swim president Mike Lazzo several questions about the series, as he was an executive during its production run. To Andre&#x27;s surprise Lazzo had no interest in &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, saying &quot;Space Ghost is dead to me&quot;.

== Other media ==
=== Appearances in other works ===
The character Space Ghost has hosted various &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;-style interviews outside of the series, including an interview with Jim Carrey and film director Chuck Russell for the 1995 VHS release of &quot;The Mask&quot;, a 2009 interview with Zoe Saldaña to promote James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot;, a 2010 interview with Jack Black to promote &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, a 2010 short with Steve Nash to promote VitaminWater, a 2011 interview with Tommy Wiseau interspersed during commercial breaks on Adult Swim&#x27;s April Fools&#x27; Day broadcast of &quot;The Room&quot;, and a 2012 interview with Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis to promote &quot;The Campaign&quot;. Space Ghost has appeared in commercials for Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper, AT&amp;T, Nestea, Esurance, and VitaminWater as well as network promos for Cartoon Network and Adult Swim. Space Ghost, Moltar, Zorak, Brak, and Mojo Jojo from &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; appear in a 2002 interview with professional soccer player Hugo Sánchez on the Latin America Cartoon Network channel, and again in 2003 interviewing Óscar Pérez Rojas, which also features Eustace from &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot;.

Space Ghost frequently makes cameo appearances in episodes of or promos for other Cartoon Network or Adult Swim animated series, including a 2002 promo for &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot;, the 2002 &quot;The Brak Show&quot; episode &quot;Runaway&quot; and 2003&#x27;s &quot;Enter the Hump&quot;, the 2003 &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; episode &quot;The Dressing&quot;, a 2004 promo interview for &quot;Tom Goes to the Mayor&quot;, the 2004 Adult Swim special &quot;Anime Talk Show&quot;, the 2006 &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; episode &quot;Suck It&quot;, the 2007 film &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters&quot;, the 2011 &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Bold Beginnings&quot;, and the 2011 Adult Swim pilot &quot;Earth Ghost&quot;, a reworking of a 2007 live-action pilot &quot;Lowe Country.&quot; Space Ghost also appears on the 1998 series &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot; to promote the CD &quot;Space Ghost&#x27;s Surf &amp; Turf&quot;, and as the announcer for the 2011 video game &quot;Cartoon Network: Punch Time Explosion&quot;, with some of his dialogue alluding to &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;.

Space Ghost appears in or is referenced in various musical works. The character is mentioned in the opening lyrics of cello rock band Rasputina&#x27;s song &quot;The Olde Headboard&quot;, which is featured on their 1998 album &quot;How We Quit the Forest&quot;. &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; is featured in the Danger Doom song &quot;Space Ho&#x27;s&quot;. Rapper SpaceGhostPurrp named himself after the titular character and used the character&#x27;s image for the cover of his &quot;NASA&quot; mixtape. British indie band Glass Animals references &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; on their 2020 album &quot;Dreamland&quot; with a song of the same name.

=== Comics ===
From 1997 to 2003, &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; comics were published in anthology comics &quot;Cartoon Network Present&quot;, &quot;Cartoon Network Starring&quot; and &quot;Cartoon Cartoons&quot; by DC Comics. Issue 40 of the comic book &quot;Scooby-Doo Team-Up&quot; features a non-satirical Space Ghost in his traditional role as a space-traveling superhero, albeit one who captures Moltar and Zorak with the help of Scooby-Doo. Sidekicks Jan and Jace say that the two villains are clever and that once, to keep him from interfering in their plans, they even &quot;hypnotized him into thinking he was a talk show host! Fortunately, he snapped out of it after eight seasons.&quot; On hearing that, Space Ghost frowns and says, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to talk about it.&quot;

=== Home media ===
&quot;Space Ghost: Coast to Coast&quot; has been released on home media in three widespread DVD volumes and two additional volumes only available for purchase through the now-defunct Adult Swim online store. The final six episodes of the television run have never had an official DVD release. Nearly every episode was available to buy through a &quot;build your own DVD&quot; feature on Adult Swim&#x27;s website. Thus the final season episodes, early episodes that were left off the first volume, and unedited shows that had been altered on the official releases were now available to own, but only in DVD-ROM form.

In 2006, episodes were made available on the Xbox Live Marketplace. The series, along with other Adult Swim shows such as &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; and &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;, was released on HBO Max on its May 2020 launch. It was removed when the streaming service rebranded as Max.

=== Music releases ===
A &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; promotional CD titled &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast: Yeah, Whatever...&quot; featuring four tracks was released in 1995. A comedy album titled &quot;Space Ghost&#x27;s Musical Bar-B-Que&quot; was released by Kid Rhino and Cartoon Network in 1997. A follow-up album, &quot;Space Ghost&#x27;s Surf &amp; Turf&quot;, released the following year.

== Legacy, spin-offs, and other adaptations ==

&quot;Cartoon Planet&quot;, a spin-off featuring Space Ghost, Zorak, and Brak hosting a variety show on the Cartoon Planet, premiered on Cartoon Network and its sister network TBS in 1995. In 2000, the show either spun off or directly inspired the four original cartoons that constituted Adult Swim&#x27;s comedy block—&quot;Sealab 2021&quot;; &quot;The Brak Show&quot;; &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;; and &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;—all of which were created by &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; staff. Although &quot;Harvey Birdman&quot; uses traditional animation to flash animation, the rest uses the same limited animation style as &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;. &quot;The Brak Show&quot; includes the characters Brak and Zorak, recurring characters on &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;.

In 2007, Cartoon Network Spain produced an adaptation of the series which aired as part of the Adult Swim block on TNT Spain. This version replaces the guests with Spanish celebrities.

In 2020, a puppet version of Brak appeared in YouTube videos uploaded by Andy Merrill.

On January 21, 2023, Jason Segel announced in a podcast that he wrote a script for a live-action version of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;.

Four boulders found on the planet Mars were named after Space Ghost, Zorak, Moltar, and Brak.

Zorak and Brak make various cameos in the series &quot;Jellystone!&quot; Season 3&#x27;s &quot;Space Con&quot; features Space Ghost, Brak, Zorak, and Moltar, with Lowe and Merrill reprising their roles. The episode makes references to &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; and its spinoffs &quot;Cartoon Planet&quot; and &quot;The Brak Show&quot;.

<text>Maheshwari Udyan, also known by its former name King&#x27;s Circle (until 1962), is a park in Matunga, Mumbai. It was named after George V, the King-Emperor. The part of the road that leads to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus was formerly called Vincent Road. It was changed to Dr. Ambedkar Road almost 45 years ago. King&#x27;s Circle station and Matunga railway station are next to each other, the former on the Harbour and the latter on the Central line.

Morarji Desai, then Union Finance minister of India, laid the foundation stone on 3 February 1962 to commemorate the name change.

Located very close to King&#x27;s Circle station is South Indian Education Society High School, one of Mumbai&#x27;s oldest schools. King&#x27;s Circle is also central to places such as Koliwada, Wadala or Vadala, Sion, Dadar and C.G.S. Colony (Antop Hill); and is a location for real estate and business due to its central location and higher prices.

For several decades, Matunga and Sion were the roads terminal points. Beyond them was a marshy, unsuitable land mass, for habitation. All construction was taking place in South Mumbai. Land was reclaimed from the sea and made available for building sites.

Maheshwari Udyan is on the road. It passes through various flyovers reaching Thane Depot. From this Udyan, one can go by walk to western part of Matunga. The Railway workshop one small length bylane foot bridge, (Local folks call this lane &#x27;Monkey bridge&#x27;) which connects Matunga East to Matunga west.

<text>Formula 17 () is a 2004 Taiwanese film directed by Chen Yinjung. It stars Tony Yang, Duncan Chow, King Chin, Dada Ji, Jimmy Yang, and Jason Chang. It is a gay romantic comedy film about Chou Tien Tsai, a romantic Taiwanese young man who takes a trip to visit an online boyfriend in person for the first time. Finding his internet relationship unsuitable for his real life, he moves on with his life and rooms with an old time friend of his. The film describes Tien&#x27;s experiences with his loyal roommate and his friends, and a surprising relationship that he develops with the local &quot;Playboy&quot;.

==Plot==
Naïve country bumpkin Chou Tien Tsai (Tony Yang) goes to Taipei to meet an internet friend face-to-face. Being a romantic, and believing in &#x27;true love&#x27; (he even has a book called &quot;Love Is A Kind Of Faith&quot;), he is sorely disappointed when his internet friend, Kevin, suggests they have sex with no love. Tien instead goes to a bar and runs into his ex-classmate Yu (Jin Qin) and Yu&#x27;s friend CC (Dada Ji). In the same bar, he encounters the &#x27;Number One Playboy&#x27; Bai Tieh Nan (Duncan Chow), who is notorious for one night stands. Despite professing his dislike for &#x27;men who play with love&#x27;, Tien can&#x27;t help being drawn to Bai.

Tien becomes roommates with Yu. Yu enlists another friend, Alan (James Yun), to try and set Tien up with someone so he&#x27;ll lose his virginity, but their efforts fail against Tien&#x27;s unyielding belief in saving himself for true love. Tien later gets a job as a clubhouse attendant, where he has several run-ins with Bai, who seems to like Tien mutually. Despite warnings from his friends and rumors about Bai&#x27;s past, Tien very quickly develops a liking towards Bai. Scenes with Bai and his psychologist show that Bai has a problem kissing people despite having no qualms about sleeping with them. After being advised to practice kissing a mirror and then a mannequin, both of which fail to help him, he tries to kiss his longtime friend, Jun (Jason Chang), but can&#x27;t bring himself to do it. One night, Tien shows up at Bai&#x27;s doorstep and they end up kissing and having sex. True to his nature, Bai disappears the next day, leaving Jun to turn up at his house and explain to Tien that &#x27;he hopes you don&#x27;t misunderstand&#x27;, causing Tien to misunderstand the situation. Tien, hurt and unknowing of the entire story behind Bai&#x27;s intimacy issues, leaves a message saying that &#x27;this kind of misunderstanding won&#x27;t happen again&#x27;. Later, Bai, who would like to make amends with Tien, is thwarted from doing so before having to leave for an important business trip.

After failing to reach Bai by phone, Tien prepares to leave his roommate&#x27;s dwelling and return to his own home. Meanwhile, Tien&#x27;s friends corner Bai and Jun as they get back from the business trip. They ask Bai to tell them the truth, but Bai is very resistant to tell the story, so Jun decides to share instead. As a young boy, Bai was told by a fortune teller that he is cursed and that anything that he loves will be doomed. A lifetime of self-fulfilling this prophecy is what led Bai to become a serial one-night stander and lose his ability to love. Falling in love with Tien caught Bai off guard and, as a result, they both suffered. After a silent prayer for a second chance, he sees T&#x27;ien heading up an escalator. His first attempt to apologize fails, and Tien literally runs away. He nearly gets run down by a scooter, but Bai saves him and they make up.

The ending credits include a short segment on Yu, CC, and Alan and their somewhat stereotyped views upon gay fashion.

<text>Christopher Lance Cairns (born 13 June 1970) is a former New Zealand cricketer and former ODI captain, who played for the New Zealand cricket team as an all-rounder. Cairns finished his Test career with a batting average of 33.53 and a bowling average of 29.40. In 2000, he was named as one of five Wisden Cricketers of the Year. He has appeared in ICC Cricket World Cup tournaments on 4 occasions in 1992, 1996, 1999 and 2003. He is regarded as one of the greatest allrounders of the game. Cairns was a member of the New Zealand team that won the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy, the first time the country won an ICC trophy, and he had a major role in the final with 102 not out, and scored the winning run.

He is son of former New Zealand cricketer Lance Cairns. He starred in both the One-day and Test New Zealand teams, as well as the Canterbury New Zealand domestic championship team. After his playing career Cairns went on to become a commentator with Sky Sport New Zealand.

==Domestic career==
Cairns also played for Northland in the Hawke Cup. He had joined the Indian Cricket League, and was the captain of the Chandigarh Lions till its closure in 2008. He later went on to play for Nottinghamshire in the English Twenty20 cup competition.

==International career==
He was included in the New Zealand national under-19 cricket team for the 1988 Youth Cricket World Cup, which was also eventually the inaugural edition of the Under-19 Cricket World Cup. He was later selected to the senior national team. He made his test debut against Australia on 24 November 1989.

Cairns was a destructive batsman who could hit sixes straight down the ground and in his earlier days was an intelligent fast-medium bowler. Since then, persistent injuries have forced him to drop his pace and rely more on his hard-to-read slower ball.

With the bat, Cairns has been the author of some of New Zealand cricket&#x27;s most memorable innings, including his unbeaten 102 to win the final of the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy for New Zealand against India in Kenya, and his 158 from just 172 balls in a Test against South Africa in 2004. Cairns knocked Shane Warne out of Australia&#x27;s bowling attack during a 2000 test in Wellington when he launched several sixes out of the Basin Reserve and onto the adjacent street. Cairns formerly held the world record for most sixes in Tests (87, since surpassed by Adam Gilchrist), and for a time held the New Zealand record for fastest century in ODIs (75 balls, currently owned by Corey Anderson with 36 balls).

===ICC KnockOut Trophy===
Cairns was also the part of the victorious New Zealand campaign during the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy where they beat India in the final to lift their first title in major ICC global event. He played his part in the final and helped the Kiwis side, by scoring a match winning knock of 102* and was awarded the player of the final. Finally New Zealand went onto win the final and registered the highest ever chase in an ICC Champions Trophy final (265). He also went onto become the first player to score a century in an ICC Champions Trophy final (was previously called as ICC Knockout Trophy) in a winning cause. He became only the third player to score a century in a Champions Trophy final after Philo Wallace and Sourav Ganguly.

===Making history===
In an ODI against India in 1999, he went onto become the second ever player in ODI history after Gordon Greenidge to score a century in his 100th ODI and became the first batsman to score a century in his 100th ODI in a winning cause. He is currently the only New Zealand player to achieve that milestone.

Cairns&#x27; career-best bowling performance in Tests was 7/27 against the West Indies in 1999, and he is New Zealand&#x27;s sixth highest wicket taker in Tests, after Richard Hadlee, Daniel Vettori, Tim Southee, Trent Boult, and Chris Martin.

He is also one of only eight players to have reached the all-rounder&#x27;s double of 200 wickets and 3000 runs. Out of these seven players, Cairns reached the double 3rd fastest (58 Test) behind Ian Botham and Kapil Dev (50 tests). In ODIs, Cairns came close to another double of 200 wickets and 5000 runs. Cairns finished his ODI career on 4950 runs, just 50 short. Cairns Test batting average at number seven (44.02) is the 5th best average for that position of all time.

The New Zealand Herald journalist, Richard Boock said about Cairns: &quot;It&#x27;s not a scientific measure of course, but if Cairns&#x27; body had held together long enough for him to have played 100 Tests, his figures extrapolate out to something like 5334 runs and 351 wickets – very similar to those of Botham.&quot; He went on to say &quot;He was, and should be remembered as, one of the game&#x27;s best all-rounders.&quot;

===Late career===
During the Lord&#x27;s Test against England, he bowled England wicket-keeper Chris Read for zero. Read was ducking to the ball, what he thought was a beamer from Chris Cairns but was a well-disguised slower ball.

Cairns also played in the World Cricket Tsunami Appeal ODI, at the MCG. Cairns played for the ICC World XI and scored 69 off 47 balls before being stumped by Kumar Sangakkara off the bowling of Muttiah Muralitharan. During his innings, Cairns put a 91 run partnership on with his captain, Ricky Ponting. With the ball, Cairns picked up 1–37 off 6 overs.

Injuries plagued Cairns throughout his career. There remains some debate over his statistics and how they reflected his ability. In Cairns career he played 62 Test and missed a further 55 due to injury. Sidharth Monga writing in 2009 that Cairns&#x27; career returns &quot;were a poor justification of his prodigious talent.&quot;

===Retirement===

Cairns retired from the New Zealand Test team in 2004.

In the 2005 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Cairns was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to cricket.

On 22 January 2006, Cairns announced his retirement from ODIs in a press conference. A Twenty20 match against the West Indies on 16 February 2006 was his last game representing New Zealand. He was also part of the ICC World XI that played in the World Cricket Tsunami Appeal matches.

&quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; compared his retirement to those of Michael Jordan and Björn Borg on 15 February 2006. Cairns also left the door open for a comeback, but said &quot;I don&#x27;t think I could ever be tempted back&quot;.

In Cairns&#x27; final game, he bowled four overs for 24 and no wicket and scored a nine-ball duck, before being bowled by Chris Gayle. He also missed the stumps in both attempts during the bowl off. ESPNcricinfo describe his final international as &quot;an unfitting farewell&quot; and that &quot;he deserved better&quot;. He was named as the captain of the World XI for the 2009 ICL World Series Twenty 20 tournament which was set to be held in Hyderabad. However, the proposed tournament was cancelled due to payment disputes.

==Alleged match fixing==

In December 2013, Cairns was the subject of allegations in an ICC investigation into match-fixing. He is alleged to have attempted to manipulate games in India when he was captain of the Chandigarh Lions in the short lived Indian Cricket League. Cairns has rejected these claims.

Former New Zealand cricketer Lou Vincent, an admitted match fixer, has said that Cairns had approached him about fixing matches. New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum also told the Anti Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) of the International Cricket Council that Cairns made a match fixing approach to him. Cairns insists that he has never fixed a match, saying Vincent wanted to &quot;mitigate his sins by blaming others&quot; and taking issue with McCullum having waited three years before approaching the ICC.

In March 2012, Cairns successfully sued former Indian Premier League commissioner Lalit Modi for libel, after Modi posted on Twitter in 2010 that Cairns had been involved in match-fixing during 2008. He won costs and damages. On 12 September 2014, the Metropolitan Police announced that they would charge Cairns with perjury stemming from the Modi libel trial. He was acquitted of charges of perjury and perverting the course of justice on 30 November 2015.

==Personal life==
In August 1993, Cairns&#x27; sister Louise was killed in a train accident at Rolleston. In 2006, in collaboration with Kiwi Rail, he formed the Chris Cairns Foundation, which raises money to improve rail safety; in September 2008 he completed a walk promoting rail safety awareness.

Cairns married Melanie Croser in 2010, it is his third marriage. Croser, an Australian, had played basketball in the USA before working for a sports marketing group in Sydney. Cairns lives in Canberra and played for the local club North Canberra Gungahlin Eagles in the 2011/12 season.

On 10 August 2021, he was reported to be on life support after suffering a major heart attack resulting in aortic dissection in his home in Canberra, Australia about a week prior. He was later transferred to St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, Sydney and was kept in an intensive care unit. On 20 August 2021, Cairns was reported to be off life support and was able to communicate with his family. However, Cairns became paralysed from the waist down due to suffering a stroke during the surgery. On 19 September 2021, he recorded a message of gratitude on Twitter that he is recovering at home after being transferred to Spinal Unit on 10 September. It was his first post on his Twitter in 7 years.

On 5 February 2022, he revealed on his Instagram that he was diagnosed with bowel cancer after a routine check-up the day before.

<text>Humphry Ditton (29 May 1675 – 15 October 1715) was an English mathematician. He was the author of several influential works.

==Life==
Ditton was born on 29 May 1675 in Salisbury, the only son of Humphry Ditton, gentleman and ardent nonconformist, and Miss Luttrell of Dunster Castle, near Taunton. He studied theology privately, and was for some time also a dissenting minister, at Tonbridge, where he married a Miss Ball.

On his father&#x27;s death, Ditton devoted himself mainly to the study of mathematics. Through the influence of Isaac Newton he was elected mathematical master in Christ&#x27;s Hospital. He produced also a theological work, &quot;A Discourse Concerning the Resurrection of Jesus Christ&quot;, which sought to take a mathematical, deductive approach to the subject. The first of its four editions appeared in 1712 and it was translated into French and German. He was unable to complete his response to various criticisms of the work before his death.

A diary containing Ditton&#x27;s religious meditations appeared posthumously in the &quot;Gospel Magazine&quot; (September 1777, pp. 393–403; December 1777, pp. 437–441).

==Works==
He was author of the following memoirs and treatises:
*&quot;Of the Tangents of Curves&quot;, published in &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; vol. xxiii;
*&quot;A Treatise on Spherical Catoptrics&quot;, published in the &quot;Phil. Trans. vol. xxiv&quot;, from which it was reprinted in the &quot;Acta Eruditorum&quot; (1707), and also in the &quot;Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences at Paris&quot;;
*&quot;General Laws of Nature and Motion&quot; (1705), a work which was commended by Wolfius as illustrating and rendering easier the writings of Galileo Galilei and Christiaan Huygens, and
*&quot;Principia of Newton; An Institution of Fluxions, containing the First Principles, Operations, and Applications of that admirable Method, as invented by Sir Isaac Newton&quot; (1706).

In 1709 he published the &quot;Synopsis Algebraica of John Alexander&quot;, with additions and corrections. In his &quot;Treatise on Perspective&quot; (1712) he explained his mathematical principles; and anticipated the method afterwards elaborated by Brook Taylor.

In 1714 Ditton published his &quot;Discourse on the Resurrection of Jesus Christ&quot;, and &quot;The New Law of Fluids, or a Discourse concerning the Ascent of Liquids in exact Geometrical Figures, between two nearly contiguous Surfaces&quot;. To this was annexed a tract (&quot;Matter not a Cogitative Substance&quot;) to demonstrate the impossibility of thinking or perception being the result of any combination of the parts of matter and motion.

Ditton and William Whiston wrote a book, called &quot;A new method for discovering the longitude both at sea and land&quot;, concerning a method for discovering the longitude, which it seems they had published about half a year earlier. Although the method had been approved by Newton before being presented to the Board of Longitude, and successfully practised in finding the longitude between Paris and Vienna, the board determined against it. Jonathan Swift wrote mockingly about this plan.

Ditton died in the following year, and was buried in Christ Church Greyfriars in central London.

<text>Complicit absolution is an offense in Roman Catholic canon law consisting of the absolution of a party complicit with the absolving priest in an offense. Because it constitutes the abuse of a sacrament, it is held to be sacrilege.

Some cases involve secular clergy in the archdiocese of Boston who were similarly accused of abusing the confessional in the documents &quot;Crimen sollicitationis&quot; and &quot;De delictis gravioribus&quot;.

<doc id="573488" wikidata="Q205952" url="?curid=573488" title="Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park">
<text>Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is a national park of the United States located in Hawaii on the island of Hawaii. The park encompasses two active volcanoes: Kīlauea, one of the world&#x27;s most active volcanoes, and Mauna Loa, the world&#x27;s largest shield volcano. The park provides scientists with insight into the development of the Hawaiian Islands and access for studies of volcanism. For visitors, the park offers dramatic volcanic landscapes, glimpses of rare flora and fauna, and a view into the traditional Hawaiian culture connected to these landscapes.

The park was originally established on August 1, 1916, as &quot;Hawaii National Park&quot;, which was then split into this park and Haleakalā National Park. In recognition of its outstanding natural values, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park was designated as an International Biosphere Reserve in 1980 and a World Heritage Site in 1987. In 2012, the park was depicted on the 14th quarter of the America the Beautiful Quarters series.

On May 11, 2018, the park was closed to the public in the Kīlauea volcano summit area, including the visitor center and park headquarters, due to explosions and toxic ash clouds from Halemaʻumaʻu, as well as earthquakes and road damage. Portions of the park, including the visitor center, reopened to the public on September 22, 2018. As of early 2022, most of the park is open; however, some road segments and trails as well as the Jaggar Museum of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory are still closed to visitors.

Eruptive activity, ground collapses and explosions in the park ceased in early August 2018, and the lull in eruptive activity at Kīlauea continued until an eruption on December 20, 2020, at the Halemaʻumaʻu crater.

==Environment==

The park includes of land.
Around half of the park () was designated the Hawaii Volcanoes Wilderness area in 1978, providing solitude for hiking and camping. Wilderness designation covers the northwestern extension of the National Park, including Mokuaweoweo, the summit of the volcano Mauna Loa. In the southwestern portion of the park, a large chunk of wilderness includes several miles of coastline and a small portion southeast of the visitors center. The park encompasses diverse environments from sea level to the summit of the Earth&#x27;s most massive active volcano, Mauna Loa, at . Climates range from lush tropical rain forests, to the arid and barren Kaū Desert.

Recently eruptive sites include the main caldera of Kīlauea and a more active but remote vent called Puu Ōō.

The main entrance to the park is from the Hawaii Belt Road. The Chain of Craters Road leads to the coast, passing several craters from historic eruptions. The road had continued to another park entrance near the town of Kalapana, but that portion is covered by a lava flow, and is only available as an emergency evacuation route. The park&#x27;s Kahuku District is accessible via Kahuku Road off Highway 11 near mile marker 70.

===Climate===
==History==

Kīlauea and its Halemaʻumaʻu caldera were traditionally considered the sacred home of the volcano goddess Pele, and Hawaiians visited the crater to offer gifts to the goddess.

In 1790, a party of warriors, along with women and children who were in the area, were caught in an unusually violent eruption. Many were killed and others left footprints in the lava that are still visible.

The first western visitors to the site, English missionary William Ellis and American Asa Thurston, went to Kīlauea in 1823. Ellis wrote of his reaction to the first sight of the erupting volcano:
″A spectacle, sublime and even appalling, presented itself before us. &#x27;We stopped and trembled.&#x27; Astonishment and awe for some moments rendered us mute, and, like statues, we stood fixed to the spot, with our eyes riveted on the abyss below.″
The volcano became a tourist attraction in the 1840s, and local businessmen such as Benjamin Pitman and George Lycurgus ran a series of hotels at the rim. Volcano House is the only hotel or restaurant located within the borders of the national park.

Lorrin A. Thurston, grandson of the American missionary Asa Thurston, was one of the driving forces behind the establishment of the park after investing in the hotel from 1891 to 1904. William R. Castle first proposed the idea in 1903. Thurston, who then owned &quot;The Honolulu Advertiser&quot; newspaper, printed editorials in favor of the park idea. In 1907, the territory of Hawaii paid for fifty members of Congress and their wives to visit Haleakalā and Kīlauea, including a dinner cooked over lava steam vents. In 1908, Thurston entertained Secretary of the Interior James Rudolph Garfield, and another congressional delegation the following year. Governor Walter F. Frear proposed a draft bill in 1911 to create Kilauea National Park for $50,000. Thurston and local landowner William Herbert Shipman proposed boundaries, but ran into some opposition from ranchers. Thurston printed endorsements from John Muir, Henry Cabot Lodge, and former President Theodore Roosevelt. After several attempts, the legislation introduced by delegate Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaole finally passed to create the park. House Resolution 9525 was signed by Woodrow Wilson on August 1, 1916. Hawaii National Park became the eleventh national park in the United States, and the first in a territory.

As stated in the foundation document:
Within a few weeks, the National Park Service Organic Act created the National Park Service to run the system. The park was officially renamed Hawaii Volcanoes National Park after being split from Haleakalā National Park on September 22, 1961.

An easily accessible lava tube was named for the Thurston family. An undeveloped stretch of the Thurston Lava Tube extends an additional beyond the developed area and dead-ends into the hillside, but it is closed to the general public.
=== Painting of Pele ===

About 1929, D. Howard Hitchcock made an oil painting of Pele, the Hawaiian goddess of fire, lightning, wind, and volcanoes. In 1966, the artist&#x27;s son, Harvey, donated the painting to the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, where it was displayed in the visitor center from 1966 to 2005. The painting was criticized for portraying the Hawaiian goddess as a Caucasian.

In 2003, the Volcano Art Center announced a competition for a &quot;more modern and culturally authentic rendering&quot; of the goddess. An anonymous judging panel of Native Hawaiian elders selected a painting by Arthur Johnsen of Puna, Hawaii from 140 entries. In Johnsen&#x27;s painting, the goddess has distinctly Polynesian features. She is holding a digging stick (&quot;ōō&quot;) in her left hand and the egg that gave birth to her younger sister Hiiaka in her right hand. In 2005, the Hitchcock was replaced with Johnsen&#x27;s painting.

===Kahuku District expansion===

In 2003, an additional of the Kahuku Ranch were added to the park, the largest land acquisition in Hawaii&#x27;s history. Now named the Kahuku District, the park was enlarged by 56% with the newly acquired land, which is west of the town of Waiōhinu and east of Ocean View. The land was purchased for $21.9 million from the estate of Samuel Mills Damon, with financing from The Nature Conservancy.

===Recent events===

On March 19, 2008, there was a small explosion in Halemaʻumaʻu, the first explosive event since 1924 and the first eruption in the Kīlauea caldera since September 1982. Debris from the explosion was scattered over an area of . A small amount of ash was also reported at a nearby community. The explosion covered part of Crater Rim Drive and damaged Halemaʻumaʻu Overlook. The explosion did not release any lava, which suggests to scientists that it was driven by hydrothermal or gas sources.
This explosion event followed the opening of a major sulfur dioxide gas vent, greatly increasing levels emitted from Halemaʻumaʻu. The dangerous increase of sulfur dioxide gas prompted closures of Crater Rim Drive between the Jaggar Museum south/southeast to Chain of Craters Road, Crater Rim Trail from Kīlauea Military Camp south/southeast to Chain of Craters Road, and all trails leading to Halemaʻumaʻu, including those from Byron Ledge, Iliahi (Sandalwood) Trail, and Kaū Desert Trail.

In mid-May 2018, the Kīlauea District of the park was closed due to explosive eruptions at Halemaʻumaʻu, though the Kahuku District remained open. The Kīlauea District, including the visitor center, reopened to the public on September 22, 2018. Eruptive activity, ground collapses and explosions in the park had ceased in early August. At the summit, seismicity and deformation are negligible. Sulfur dioxide emission rates at both the summit and the Lower East Rift Zone are drastically reduced; the combined rate is lower than at any time since late 2007. Earthquake and deformation data show no net accumulation, withdrawal, or significant movement of subsurface magma or pressurization as would be expected if the system was building toward a resumption of activity.
A small water pond appeared in Halemaumau in the summer of 2019. The pond deepened and enlarged into a small lake since it was first observed, measuring deep as of December 1, 2020. An eruption in the crater that began on December 20, 2020, boiled away the water lake completely and began to partially refill the crater with lava.

As of 2022, most of the park is open, although some road segments, trails, and the Jaggar Museum of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory remain closed. The Thurston Lava Tube (Nāhuku) was reopened to the public on February 21, 2020. Several large rockfalls were cleared and sensors were installed to monitor new cracks, along with improvements to water drainage and parking. The rockfalls and cracks had been caused by some of the 60,000 earthquakes recorded during the Kīlauea eruption.

In 2022, the Mauna Loa volcano erupted, after many years.
===Pohue Bay expansion===
The park expanded in 2022 when The Trust for Public Land transferred its ownership of to the National Park Service. Pōhue Bay is home to numerous well-preserved and significant Hawaiian cultural sites, including the largest recorded abrader quarry in Hawaiʻi, lava tubes, burial site, mauka-makai (mountain to sea) trails, fishing shrines, remains of once-thriving coastal villages, and petroglyphs. A well-preserved portion of the Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail or Ala Loa, an ancient coastal trail system, hugs the coastline.

The Pōhue coastline is critical habitat for federally listed endangered Hawaiian species, including the Hawaiian hawksbill turtle (honu‘ea) and Hawaiian monk seal. Rare endemic opae&#x27;ula (red shrimp) live in the area&#x27;s anchialine ponds, and the bay is often frequented by native and migratory birds, including ʻiwa (frigate bird), koaʻe kea (white tailed tropic bird), kōlea (golden plover), &#x27;ulili (wandering tattler) and ʻaukuʻu (black crowned night heron).

==Historic places==

Several of the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii are located within the park:
* 1790 Footprints
* Ainahou Ranch
* Ainapo Trail
* Kīlauea Crater
* Puna-Kāʻu Historic District
* Volcano House
* Whitney Seismograph Vault No. 29 at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory
* Wilkes Campsite

==Visitor center and museums==

The main visitor center, located just within the park entrance at , includes displays and information about the features of the park. The nearby Volcano Art Center, located in the original 1877 Volcano House hotel, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and houses historical displays and an art gallery.

The Thomas A. Jaggar Museum, now closed due to damage from the 2018 eruptive events, is located a few miles west on Crater Rim Drive. The museum featured more exhibits and a close view of Kīlauea&#x27;s active vent Halemaʻumaʻu. The museum is named after scientist Thomas Jaggar, the first director of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, which adjoins the museum. The observatory itself is operated by the U.S. Geological Survey and is not open to the public.

The Kilauea Military Camp provides accommodations for U.S. military personnel. Volunteer groups also sponsor events in the park.

<doc id="573489" wikidata="Q286954" url="?curid=573489" title="C3 carbon fixation">
<text>carbon fixation is the most common of three metabolic pathways for carbon fixation in photosynthesis, the other two being  and CAM. This process converts carbon dioxide and ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP, a 5-carbon sugar) into two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate through the following reaction:
:CO2 + H2O + RuBP → (2) 3-phosphoglycerate

This reaction was first discovered by Melvin Calvin, Andrew Benson and James Bassham in 1950. C3 carbon fixation occurs in all plants as the first step of the Calvin–Benson cycle. (In and CAM plants, carbon dioxide is drawn out of malate and into this reaction rather than directly from the air.)

Plants that survive solely on fixation (plants) tend to thrive in areas where sunlight intensity is moderate, temperatures are moderate, carbon dioxide concentrations are around 200 ppm or higher, and groundwater is plentiful. The plants, originating during Mesozoic and Paleozoic eras, predate the  plants and still represent approximately 95% of Earth&#x27;s plant biomass, including important food crops such as rice, wheat, soybeans and barley.

 plants cannot grow in very hot areas at today&#x27;s atmospheric CO2 level (significantly depleted during hundreds of millions of years from above 5000 ppm) because RuBisCO incorporates more oxygen into RuBP as temperatures increase. This leads to photorespiration (also known as the oxidative photosynthetic carbon cycle, or C2 photosynthesis), which leads to a net loss of carbon and nitrogen from the plant and can therefore limit growth.

 plants lose up to 97% of the water taken up through their roots by transpiration. In dry areas, plants shut their stomata to reduce water loss, but this stops from entering the leaves and therefore reduces the concentration of in the leaves. This lowers the :O2 ratio and therefore also increases photorespiration. and CAM plants have adaptations that allow them to survive in hot and dry areas, and they can therefore out-compete plants in these areas.

The isotopic signature of plants shows higher degree of 13C depletion than the plants, due to variation in fractionation of carbon isotopes in oxygenic photosynthesis across plant types. Specifically, plants do not have PEP carboxylase like plants, allowing them to only utilize ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) to fix through the Calvin cycle. The enzyme Rubisco largely discriminates against carbon isotopes, evolving to only bind to 12C isotope compared to 13C (the heavier isotope), contributing to more 13C depletion seen in plants compared to plants especially since the pathway uses PEP carboxylase in addition to Rubisco.

== Variations ==
Not all C3 carbon fixation pathways operate at the same efficiency.

=== Refixation ===
Bamboos and the related rice have an improved C3 efficiency. This improvement might be due to its ability to recapture CO2 produced during photorespiration, a behavior termed &quot;carbon refixation&quot;. These plants achieve refixation by growing chloroplast extensions called &quot;stromules&quot; around the stroma in mesophyll cells, so that any photorespired CO2 from the mitochondria has to pass through the RuBisCO-filled chloroplast.

Refixation is also performed by a wide variety of plants. The common approach involving growing a bigger bundle sheath leads down to C2 photosynthesis.

=== Synthetic glycolate pathway ===
C3 carbon fixation is prone to photorespiration (PR) during dehydration, accumulating toxic glycolate products. In the 2000s scientists used computer simulation combined with an optimization algorithm to figure out what parts of the metabolic pathway may be tuned to improve photosynthesis. According to simulation, improving glycolate metabolism would help significantly to reduce photorespiration.

Instead of optimizing specific enzymes on the PR pathway for glycolate degradation, South et al. decided to bypass PR altogether. In 2019, they transferred &quot;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&quot; glycolate dehydrogenase and &quot;Cucurbita maxima&quot; malate synthase into the chloroplast of tobacco (a model organism). These enzymes, plus the chloroplast&#x27;s own, create a catabolic cycle: acetyl-CoA combines with glyoxylate to form malate, which is then split into pyruvate and CO2; the former in turn splits into acetyl-CoA and CO2. By forgoing all transport among organelles, all the CO2 released will go into increasing the CO2 concentration in the chloroplast, helping with refixation. The end result is 24% more biomass. An alternative using &quot;E. coli&quot; glycerate pathway produced a smaller improvement of 13%. They are now working on moving this optimization into other crops like wheat.

<doc id="573491" wikidata="Q1310978" url="?curid=573491" title="Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses">
<text>Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD, pronounced ), also known in the United States as &quot;Wild Weasel&quot; and (initially) &quot;Iron Hand&quot; operations, are military actions to suppress enemy surface-based air defenses, including not only surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) but also interrelated systems such as early-warning radar and command, control and communication (C3) functions, while also marking other targets to be destroyed by an air strike. Suppression can be accomplished both by physically destroying the systems or by disrupting and deceiving them through electronic warfare. In modern warfare, SEAD missions can constitute as much as 30% of all sorties launched in the first week of combat and continue at a reduced rate through the rest of a campaign. One quarter of American combat sorties in recent conflicts have been SEAD missions. Despite generally being associated with aircraft, SEAD missions may be performed using any means, including through actions by ground forces.

In some contexts, Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (DEAD) is used to reference physical destruction of air defense targets, while SEAD applies to sorties which discourage enemy use of their air-defense radar assets out of fear of placing the assets in jeopardy.

Primitive operations akin to SEAD emerged during the Second World War, during which multiple participants made attempts to degrade enemy ground radar stations. However, SEAD missions performed by dedicated aircraft first undertook combat missions during the Vietnam War, the United States Air Force&#x27;s EF-105F/F-105G Thunderchief and United States Navy&#x27;s A-6B Intruder being amongst these pioneers; Operation Linebacker intentionally incorporated SEAD actions to improve the survivability of bombers and increase overall effectiveness. Other early conflicts that saw SEAD missions conducted included the 1982 Falklands War, over Port Stanley, and the 1982 Lebanon War, in the Beqaa Valley. The tactical awareness, or lack thereof, of air defense operators proved to be a decisive factor in the success rate of these missions. During the 1986 United States bombing of Libya, while Libya&#x27;s integrated air defense network was not destroyed, it was damaged without major losses incurred by US forces.

During the 1990s, extensive use of SEAD was made, particularly during the Gulf War of the early 1990s. Intense aerial attacks of Iraq&#x27;s integrated air defenses were conducted during Operation Instant Thunder, the Coalition&#x27;s aerial attacks at the start of the conflict; Iraqi SAM operators regularly resorted to firing missiles with minimal or no guidance due to fears that radar use brought quick retaliation.
All Iraqi air defenses in the south were destroyed, although the skies remained unsafe for low altitude flight. In the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the defender&#x27;s air defences proved to be less vulnerable and more effective; although only two aircraft were reportedly lost to Yugoslavian SAMs, the downing of an F-117A Nighthawk marked the first combat loss ever of a stealth aircraft. In the Iraq War of the 2000s, coalition aircraft repeatedly targeted Iraqi SAMs during the opening phase of the conflict, despite this, aerial strikes were usually performed from stand-off distances to avoid these defenses, and low level flight was avoided. In the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, while many Ukrainian air defence facilities were reportedly destroyed or damaged in the first days of the war by Russian air strikes, Russia may not have been able to gain aerial superiority; it has been alleged that Ukrainian mid-range SAM sites have forced planes to fly low, but this makes them vulnerable to shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles.

==History==

===Pre-Vietnam War===
Prior to the Vietnam War, SEAD was an undefined mission: although attempts to destroy enemy air defense sites were undertaken, they were done so on an individual aircraft basis and in relation to specific targets or operations rather than as part of an overall strategy or doctrine of defense suppression. Near the end of the Second World War, US Navy pilots developed a doctrine that could be considered the first example of SEAD. When attacking enemy warships, US Navy fighters would attack enemy warships with machine guns and rockets to distract and or kill the enemy anti aircraft gunners While the torpedo and dive bombers could move in and more accurately target the ship. While crude, these tactics were frequently effective for their time.

====World War II====
During the Battle of Britain, the German Luftwaffe attempted to destroy Great Britain&#x27;s Chain Home radar stations in order to degrade the British air defense network. However, German High Command failed to realize the efficiency of not only the radar stations themselves but the command and control system directing Britain&#x27;s air defenses. After initial optimism regarding the radar sites&#x27; destruction, it was eventually decided to halt these attacks altogether except for exceptional circumstances. As the air war in Europe shifted in favor of the Allies, the Germans relied heavily on their AAA to defend against bombing attacks. This was borne out in Allied aircraft losses between 1943 and 1944, where losses to enemy fighters were cut in half but losses to flak increased tenfold.

Understanding the importance of Germany&#x27;s radar sites, the Allies directed attacks against these installations and introduced new technology to counteract the effects of radar-directed AAA, including CARPET (US) and WINDOW (UK). A change in tactics saw bomber formations flying higher and more spread out to avoid the effects of flak. Bombing missions were also carried out to accomplish the physical destruction of AAA sites, using imagery intelligence to locate the weapons and employing both heavy bombers and fighter-bombers to destroy them. The P-47 Thunderbolt in particular was chosen for this task due to its ability to survive enemy fire. The effect of these missions varied, with losses suffered by fighter-bombers much higher—up to 40% in some cases—on account of their low-altitude attacks. Artillery also played a major role in suppressing air defenses, with the British Army the first to develop what became known as counterflak or &quot;Apple Pie&quot; missions. These missions were first employed to limited effect during the Battle of France but matured as the war progressed. The largest SEAD mission in history took place on March 24, 1945, when artillery forces of the British XII Corps attempted to knock out the local German air defense network in support of Operation Varsity. Although twenty-four thousand artillery shells were fired over the course of twenty-two minutes at some one hundred targets, the mission was unsuccessful due to inaccurate targeting data and insufficient firepower.

In the Pacific Theater, the Japanese had made only limited progress in developing radar for air defense and what systems they did have were primitive and easy to avoid. Nevertheless, as the Americans began the bombing campaign against Japan there was concern over the large number of radar sites located on the home islands. For this purpose B-24 Liberators and B-29 Superfortresses were fitted with radar-homing devices to conduct &quot;ferret&quot; missions to locate and identify radar transmissions. The information brought back from these missions was used to outfit other B-29s with radar jammers and chaff to confuse Japanese air defense radars as they conducted their missions. B-25 Mitchells were also outfitted with radar-homing equipment and used to lead &quot;hunter-killer&quot; teams of other B-25s in locating and destroying Japanese early-warning radar sites.

====Korean War====
While there were some technological changes between World War II and the Korean War, many of the tactics for dealing with enemy air defenses remained the same. For aircraft performing missions at low altitudes, AAA remained a constant danger; in fact, it was less dangerous for a UNC pilot to engage in air-to-air combat than it was to attack ground targets. The terrain and weather of the Korean Peninsula also contributed to the dangers associated with ground-attack missions. Nevertheless, the advent of jet aircraft brought about many changes. Compared to propeller aircraft, jets were much faster, could climb more steeply, were more resistant to damage and were quieter in operation. They were thus able to more effectively attack ground targets and escape, and while both jet- and propeller-driven aircraft participated in the Korean War the latter suffered heavier losses and were largely phased out by the end of the conflict.

As the war progressed, the Communists developed a highly centralized integrated air defense network, incorporating early-warning radars, ground-controlled interception (GCI) and AAA. The potency of this network compelled UNC bombers to conduct bombing missions at altitudes beyond the reach of ground-based weapons, although this impacted the accuracy of their bombs. The UNC also possessed an effective air defense network, but the North Korean Air Force had been largely destroyed early in the war and the Chinese Air Force was almost exclusively focused on the mission of air superiority rather than attacking UNC ground forces.

===Vietnam War===
The Vietnam War saw the evolution of what would become known as SEAD over the course of the conflict. At the start of Operation Rolling Thunder, North Vietnam&#x27;s air defenses were only dealt with in a piecemeal fashion, in spite of intelligence indicating that the North Vietnam Army was developing an integrated air defense system (IADS) dedicated to air deniability. This included the construction of sixty SA-2 Guideline SAM sites by the end of 1965 which, though only accomplishing one hit for every thirteen missiles fired, were responsible for shooting down nearly 15% of American aircraft lost that year. Early attempts to counter this system consisted of modified F-100 Super Sabres using crude homing equipment to locate and bomb radar-guided SAM and AAA sites, but these missions incurred heavy losses and the threat to American aircraft continued to grow. In 1966 a task force was put together to analyze the challenges presented by the NVA&#x27;s air defense network and recommend ways to counter it. One of these was for aircraft to operate at low altitudes (below 500 meters) where the missiles were less effective. This also put the aircraft well within range of AAA, which would account for nearly 85% of all American aircraft losses during Rolling Thunder.

Eventually new SEAD-dedicated aircraft were introduced, the Air Force&#x27;s EF-105F/F-105G Thunderchief and Navy&#x27;s A-6B Intruder, which mounted more sophisticated detection equipment and carried the AGM-45 Shrike and AGM-78 Standard anti-radiation missiles (ARMs). These fighter-bombers became very adept at tracking down and destroying ground-based air defense weapons, such that it became common for a vast majority of NVA SAM operators to turn off their radars whenever an F-105G was spotted. While this prevented the SAM from physically being destroyed, it essentially accomplished the same mission of suppressing air defenses around the target. Electronic warfare aircraft were also used to suppress air defenses by jamming NVA radars, with first the EB-66 Destroyer joined later by the EA-6B Prowler. By the end of Rolling Thunder these changes had caused a significant degradation in the effectiveness of SAMs: only one SA-2 missile out of every forty-eight fired resulted in a hit. In spite of these changes, SEAD remained a primarily tactical function throughout Rolling Thunder, with American leadership either unaware or unappreciative of North Vietnam&#x27;s IADS.

Losses suffered by F-105 Wild Weasels spurred on the development of a new variant based on the F-4C Phantom II, the EF-4C Phantom Wild Weasel IV. The first thirty-six of these were delivered to Southeast Asia in 1969 and so missed taking part in Rolling Thunder. While carrying the same electronics as in the F-105G, the dense internal structure of the F-4 Phantom prevented the EF-4C from efficiently mounting this equipment, which meant it could not carry the superior AGM-78 Standard missile. By the start of Operation Linebacker, Wild Weasel missions were both more and less effective. Tactics and technology had evolved which improved the suppression of individual SAM sites, however the American military still failed to consider the integrated nature of North Vietnam&#x27;s air defense network. Not only did the network possess thousands of radar- and optical-guided AAA and SAM sites, it also consisted of early-warning radars, intelligence-gathering agencies, and hundreds of ground-controlled interceptors. Thus, while fewer American aircraft were lost to SAMs during Linebacker, many more were lost in air-to-air combat.

Operation Linebacker II started off similarly to Linebacker I with regards to SEAD tactics but was remarkable for the introduction of B-52 Stratofortress bombers in the defense-suppression role. During the early part of the operation, a combination of poor tactical employment and overconfidence on the part of Strategic Air Command resulted in the loss of a number of B-52s to SA-2 missiles, enough to force a rethink in how to counteract the enemy&#x27;s air defenses. The latter part of Linebacker II finally saw a concerted effort made to suppress the entire North Vietnamese IADS and significantly reduced the losses suffered. Only one SA-2 missile for every sixty-eight fired resulted in a hit, the lowest ratio of the entire war. The SEAD tactics displayed at the end of Linebacker II, involving the combination of traditional understanding of SEAD with electronic warfare and C3 countermeasures, laid the groundwork for future development.

===Post-Vietnam Wars===

With the phase-out of the F-105G, the US Air Force was in need of a new SEAD-dedicated aircraft. This effort was given more urgency in 1973 when, during the Yom Kippur War, Egypt employed a Soviet-built IADS that severely mauled the Israeli Air Force. After a series of tests, the new F-4G &#x27;Wild Weasel V&#x27; first took flight in 1975 and became operational in 1978. Built on the F-4E airframe, the F-4G removed the M61 Vulcan pod to make room for specialized detection and jamming equipment and could carry the latest anti-radiation missile, the AGM-88 HARM. The F-4G Wild Weasel was then joined by EF-111A Raven and EC-130H Compass Call to become part of the USAF&#x27;s &quot;triad&quot; of electronic combat aircraft. Each aircraft performed its own role in the overall mission of SEAD: the F-4G with seeking out and destroying enemy air defenses, the EC-130 with degrading the enemy&#x27;s C3 capabilities, and the EF-111A with jamming enemy early-warning and target-acquisition radars. Additional aircraft often part of SEAD missions included the E-3 Sentry, EC-130E Commando Solo and RC/EC-135.

On the other hand, the Soviets did not treat SEAD as an independent air operation but as a tactical role to be performed as part of a larger mission, namely an overwhelming air assault against NATO. This role was not carried out by SEAD-specific aircraft but normal bombers and fighter aircraft, such as the Tupolev Tu-16 and Tupolev Tu-22M, which could carry Soviet anti-radiation missiles. These aircraft would be organized into several strike groups whose mission was to lay down &quot;chaff corridors&quot; 40–50 kilometers across at intervals of 10 kilometers, including directly on top of suspected SAM sites. A small number of aircraft in these groups would be equipped with ARMs to physically destroy the sites. These missions were conducted against pre-planned targets which had been previously identified by signals intelligence and other reconnaissance efforts, rather than having aircraft seek out targets of opportunity. The closest the Soviets came to dedicated SEAD platforms were modified stand-off interceptors like the Mikoyan MiG-25BM and attack aircraft like the Sukhoi Su-24M.

The first example of a post-Vietnam SEAD campaign was by the United Kingdom during the 1982 Falklands War. The RAF Avro Vulcan B.Mk-2 was initially planned to be retired in early 1982 but the outbreak of the Falklands War, in April that year postponed it. The Falklands conflict was the only time that the Vulcan performed SEAD missions, flying very long-range missions against Port Stanley, armed with AGM-45 Shrike missiles mounted on makeshift underwing pylons and carrying a AN/ALQ-101 pod for jamming.

Shortly afterwards was Israel&#x27;s Operation Mole Cricket 19, launched at the start of the 1982 Lebanon War. During the prior Yom Kippur War of 1973, Egyptian and Syrian SAM batteries proved to be costly to attack for the Israeli Air Force (IAF), such as during Operation Model 5; during the first three days of the war alone, the IAF lost 50 aircraft in about 1,220 sorties, a loss rate of four percent. The IAF found it challenging to provide air support to ground forces. Shortly after the conflict&#x27;s end, the service stated a multiyear project, active between 1973 and 1978, specifically to devise an effective counter to the SAM threat. By 1982, the Bekaa Valley had been heavily reinforced by the Syrian Armed Forces with a modern Soviet-style air defense network consisting of multiple radar installations, GCI facilities, SAM and AAA sites, and a redundant C3 network. Prior to the start of the operation, Israel conducted an extensive intelligence-gathering effort, consisting of reconnaissance aircraft, remotely piloted vehicles (RPVs) and electronic surveillance aircraft, to paint an expansive picture of where Syrian air defense sites were located and which radar frequencies they were using.

Israel&#x27;s attack on the SAMs was inadvertently assisted by the Syrians, who often placed their sites in sub-optimal positions and failed to relocate their equipment, use dummy radars or maintain active combat air patrol. When the operation began, efficient coordination of jamming/deception efforts with attacks against air defense sites effectively neutralized the ground component of the Bekaa Valley IADS. In response to the attacks, the Syrians launched a large number of fighter aircraft, however without the aid of their radar and GCI facilities, these forces were &quot;flying blind&quot; and suffered crippling losses in the resulting air-to-air combat. So complete and disturbing was the Israeli dismantling of the Bekaa Valley IADS that the deputy commander of the Soviet Air Defense Forces was sent to investigate what had gone wrong. Part of Israel&#x27;s success was due to extensive reconnaissance and preparations prior to the battle, incompetence on the part of the Syrians, and desert conditions conducive to SEAD operations.

Operation El Dorado Canyon, the United States&#x27; response to the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing, employed lessons learned from the Bekaa Valley campaign, including extensive planning and practice runs. In contrast to the Israeli mission though the goal of El Dorado Canyon was not the destruction of Libya&#x27;s IADS itself but to conduct a punitive strike against Muammar Gaddafi. Suppressing the IADS through non-lethal means would help accomplish this mission and, just as important after the Vietnam War, reduce casualties suffered by the strike group. For this reason, electronic jamming played a more prominent role in the operation than at Bekaa Valley and was carried out by both EF-111A Ravens and EA-6B Prowlers in the first ever joint US Air Force-Navy SEAD operation. For several reasons, F-4G Wild Weasels could not take part in El Dorado Canyon, requiring the use of the Navy&#x27;s carrier-borne A-7E Corsair IIs and F/A-18 Hornets to attack Libyan SAM sites. Their lack of the Wild Weasel&#x27;s specialized equipment required these fighters to fire their HARMs preemptively at Libyan SAM sites, a costly and wasteful method which nevertheless was effective due to the limited nature of the raid. For their part, the Libyans and their Soviet advisers had also learned lessons from the Bekaa Valley campaign: their IADS was constructed with multiple redundancies (including overlapping radar coverage and hardened landlines between defense sites) and a wider array of both Soviet and Western radar systems able to operate on multiple frequencies to avoid jamming. In the end, US forces succeeded in suppressing the Libyan IADS and conducted their punitive strike with minimal casualties suffered.

===Gulf War===
Coalition forces made extensive use of SEAD during the Gulf War against Iraq in order to counter its – at least on paper – formidable IADS. By 1990 Iraq was protected by approximately 3,700 SAMs, organized into 105 firing batteries, and approximately 7,000 AAA pieces, supported by hundreds of overlapping early warning, search and acquisition radars. In the air the Iraq Air Force was the sixth largest in the world, including hundreds of interceptors which were housed and protected within hardened bunkers. At the center of the Iraqi IADS was Kari, an automated command and control system developed by Iraq and built by French contractors in the wake of Operation Opera (Kari in turn is the French spelling of Iraq backwards). Kari tied the entire IADS to a single location, the national Air Defense Operations Center (ADOC) located in an underground bunker in Baghdad, and in turn divided the country into four defense sectors each overseen by a Sector Operations Center (SOC) located at H-3, Kirkuk, Taji and Talil; a fifth SOC was added at Ali Al Salem to cover the recently conquered Kuwait. Each SOC oversaw the local airspace and commanded anywhere from two to five Intercept Operations Centers (IOCs) per sector. The IOCs were located in bunkers constructed at Iraqi Air Force bases and tied into local radar systems, whose information they could pass on to their SOC and thence on to Baghdad. In this way a SOC was capable of simultaneously tracking 120 aircraft and selecting for the appropriate weapon system to engage them. The SOC could automatically target for SA-2 and SA-3 SAM systems in their sector, which meant the SAMs did not have to turn on their own radar and reveal their position, or an IOC could direct local interceptors to engage the targets. Baghdad itself was one of the most heavily defended cities in the world – more heavily defended several times over than Hanoi during the Vietnam War – protected by 65% of Iraq&#x27;s SAMs and over half of its AAA pieces.

However, the Iraqi IADS had several fatal flaws of which Coalition air forces were able to take advantage. The system was primarily oriented towards defending against much smaller attacks from Iraq&#x27;s most likely enemies – Iran, Syria and Israel – and focused on point defense rather than area defense. This meant there were significant gaps in its coverage, particularly on the orientation from Saudi Arabia straight to Baghdad, and attacking aircraft would be able to approach their target from multiple directions. Much of the Iraqi air defense equipment was also quite outdated: Iraqi SA-2 and SA-3 systems were nearing the end of their operational lifespan and their countermeasures well known at this point, while what SA-6, SA-8 and Roland systems they possessed weren&#x27;t much younger either. Likewise a majority of Iraq&#x27;s interceptor force were less-capable MiG-21s, with fewer more modern variants including export versions of the MiG-29 and F1 Mirage. Furthermore, the IADS was centralized to a fault. Although each IOC was datalinked to their respective SOC and in turn back to the ADOC, the defense sectors couldn&#x27;t share information between each other. If a SOC was knocked out of action the attached air defense weapons lost all ability to coordinate their response; its respective SAM batteries would be forced to rely on their own radar systems while most AAA guns lacked any radar guidance. Training was also poor, with Iraqi pilots overly reliant on ground-control instructions such that if the IOCs were disabled they lost situation awareness and became easy targets.

Suppression of the Iraqi IADS played a prominent role in Operation Instant Thunder, the preliminary air campaign plan against Iraq which served as the basis for Operation Desert Storm&#x27;s air campaign. In its initial limited form, Instant Thunder called for three dedicated SEAD squadrons which would significantly degrade the IADS enough to allow decimating strikes against Iraq&#x27;s military and political leadership and other strategic targets. This role for SEAD was further expanded as the mission grew in scope, involving a larger number of aircraft to completely destroy the air defenses protecting southern Iraq and Kuwait. Planning for this mission was helped when the CIA contacted the French engineer responsible for designing the Kari IADS and passed along information about its vulnerabilities and limitations. In its final form, Phase II of the Desert Storm air campaign sought to decimate the southern Iraqi IADS within two days of the start of hostilities. F-4G Wild Weasels and other aircraft capable of carrying HARM missiles would destroy air defense sites themselves, electronic warfare aircraft would disrupt radars and other systems, and additional targets would be struck in order to support this mission, such as temporarily knocking out Iraq&#x27;s electrical infrastructure. In addition to traditional SEAD systems the Persian Gulf War would also see the use of unconventional assets in knocking out Iraq&#x27;s air defenses, in particular cruise missiles and F-117A Nighthawks, which would be used to attack sensitive targets.

The opening shots of Operation Desert Storm were fired on January 17 in pursuit of defense-suppression: at 2:20AM local time Task Force Normandy, a group of twelve American helicopters, infiltrated into Iraq with the goal of destroying two early-warning radar sites. Three MH-53J Pave Lows guided nine AH-64 Apaches to the targets, which the gunships destroyed, opening a hole in the Iraqi IADS for the initial wave of aircraft to exploit. Two F-117As knocked out the Nukhayb IOC, further widening the gap, although their next attack against the H-3 SOC was unsuccessful. Among the first targets hit by F-117As attacking into Baghdad, bombs damaged the Al Taqaddum IOC and Talil SOC, shortly followed by Tomahawk strikes that disabled the electrical grid upon which Kari depended; reportedly some used special warheads filled with carbon fiber bundles to short-circuit the network. For the next several hours dozens of Coalition aircraft poured into Iraq. Those which weren&#x27;t specifically directed to suppress air defenses had significant SEAD escort, including the use of BQM-74 drones and ADM-141 TALD decoys which would both &quot;take the hit&quot; for the manned airplanes and cause the Iraqis to reveal their position when they tracked or fired upon the lure. The first night&#x27;s largest sortie was a joint US Air Force-Navy SEAD mission consisting of fifty aircraft designed to look like a bombing raid on Baghdad but which instead were fitted out with decoys, drones and HARMs to destroy air defenses protecting the city. With Kari degraded due to the disabling of the civilian electrical grid the Iraqi SAMs were forced to use their organic radar, producing what one pilot called &quot;HARM Heaven&quot;. A total of 67 HARMs were fired over the course of twenty minutes, causing a significant reduction in Iraqi air defenses around the capital based on follow-up missions.

Throughout the rest of the first night additional air-defense targets were hit by Coalition aircraft with varying levels of success while strikes against other targets consisted of a high ratio of SEAD and escort to strike aircraft. This pace of attack against air-defense and other targets continued into the first day, involving a variety of different aircraft, and spread to targets in Kuwait. A-10 Thunderbolt IIs were used to attack early-warning radars and similar sites along the border in operations known humorously as &quot;Wart Weaseling&quot; (a play on the Wild Weasel and the A-10 &quot;Warthog&quot; nicknames). Unable to use Kari and fearful of turning their own radars on, Iraqi SAM operators resorted to firing their missiles with minimal or no guidance. Furthermore, units of the Iraqi Army – even the elite Republican Guard – possessed inadequate SAM defenses by NATO or Soviet standards. This allowed Coalition aircraft to attack them from the relative safety of higher altitudes.

By the end of the first forty-eight hours of Desert Storm, the Coalition had achieved its goal of significantly degrading Kari, including the destruction of all air defenses in the south. Although the Iraqis would replace most destroyed radars and bring back many IOCs and SOCs to at least partial operation, this was done so in an unorganized manner, with the Coalition continuing to bomb any reactivated sites. In effect, combined with the failure of Iraq&#x27;s air force to defend its airspace, the Coalition had gained air supremacy in the skies over Iraq from nearly the outset of the conflict.

Coalition aircraft conducting strategic bombing and interdiction inside Iraq were now free to operate at medium altitudes of and higher with no danger of SAM activity. This also put them beyond the effective range of most of Iraq&#x27;s AAA pieces, which remained a threat. Baghdad&#x27;s heavy AAA defenses also continued to make it a difficult target to attack, as Coalition forces found out during an attempted strike on January 19 against the Tuwaitha Nuclear Research Center. A variety factors, including the threat of AAA and ballistic SAMs, resulted in the strike&#x27;s failure and loss of two aircraft.

By January 27, no C3 activity was detected at the SOC level by Coalition forces, and only limited activity at the IOC level. At the end of the conflict, the DIA estimated Kari was operating at 25% its original capacity, and that it would take at least ten years to rebuild the system and another five to retrain the personnel needed to operate it. In total, the SEAD campaign by the Coalition was an unequivocal success, allowing Coalition aircraft to fly at medium and high altitudes over Kuwait and Iraq with impunity. The only losses Coalition aircraft suffered to Iraqi air defenses after the first two days occurred when they operated at low altitudes, primarily conducting close air support or other missions to assist ground forces.

===Operation Allied Force===
The bombing campaign of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia during mid-1999, dubbed Operation Allied Force, was an overall success for NATO forces, but the mission to suppress Yugoslav air defenses proved to be more difficult than prior operations during the Gulf War. SEAD operations for NATO were principally carried out by the US Air Force, with fifty F-16CJ Block 50 Fighting Falcons, and the US Navy and Marines, with 30 EA-6B Prowlers; additional support was provided by Italian and German Tornado ECRs, a purpose-developed SEAD model. Many NATO aircraft were furnished with new designed to lure away any missiles fired at them, and reportedly for the first time cyberwarfare was used to target Yugoslav air defense computer systems.

However, a number of deficiencies in NATO&#x27;s SEAD operations were revealed during the course of the bombing campaign. The US Air Force had allowed its electronic warfare branch to atrophy in the years after the Gulf War, resulting in greater response times to engaging a SAM threat. Airspace restrictions and rules of engagement limited where NATO aircraft could fly and what targets they could hit, leaving some air defense systems untouched. Kosovo&#x27;s mountainous terrain also made it difficult for NATO to locate and target Yugoslav air defenses, while at the same time the region&#x27;s poor infrastructure limited where Yugoslav SAM and AAA sites could be placed. Furthermore, according to a post-conflict US intelligence report, Yugoslavia had a spy in NATO&#x27;s headquarters in Brussels who in the early part of the conflict leaked flight plans and target details to the Yugoslav military, allowing Yugoslav military assets to be relocated to avoid detection; NATO responded by limiting the number of people with access to its plans, which appeared to be successful.

Yugoslavia had a much smaller IADS than Iraq during the Gulf War, but took greater steps at preserving it from NATO&#x27;s bombing campaign. The Yugoslav integrated air defence system (IADS) was extensive, including underground command sites and buried landlines, which allowed for information to be shared between systems; thus, active radar in one area could target NATO aircraft for SAMs and AAA in another area with no active radar, further limiting NATO&#x27;s ability to target air defences. By focusing on its operational survival, Yugoslav air defenses ceded a certain amount of air superiority to NATO forces. Yet the persistence of their credible SAM threat forced NATO to allocate greater resources to continued SEAD operations rather than conducting other missions, while Yugoslav AAA and MANPADS forced NATO aircraft to fly at or higher. NATO reportedly fired 743 HARMs during the course of the 78-day campaign, but could confirm the destruction of only three of the original 25 SA-6 batteries. At the same time, over 800 SAMs were fired by Yugoslav forces at NATO aircraft, including 477 SA-6s and 124 confirmed MANPADS, for the downing of only two aircraft and several more damaged. That one of the two aircraft shot down was an F-117A Nighthawk marked the first combat loss ever of a stealth aircraft and typified some of the issues NATO faced during the campaign.

===2003 US invasion of Iraq===

At the onset of the Iraq War, Iraq&#x27;s IADS was a fraction of what it had been during the Gulf War, though it was still one of the densest defense networks in the world. Over 200 SAM systems were still operational, mainly the older SA-2s, SA-3s and SA-6s, along with over 2,000 MANPADS and large numbers of AA guns. Improvements had been made to Kari, including greater usage of fiber optic cables, and more advanced equipment such as GPS guidance jammers were acquired. In addition to the ADOC and four original SOCs, a fifth SOC was created in Baghdad and specifically assigned to defend Saddam&#x27;s palaces, the Republican Guards, and key security facilities.

Still, the defense network was relatively outdated and thus unable to seriously challenge the Coalition&#x27;s dominance of Iraqi airspace, which had not only succeeded in suppressing Iraqi defenses during the Gulf War but continued to do so during the enforcement of Iraqi no-fly zones. Starting on March 1, aggressive &quot;enforcement&quot; of the no-fly zones accounted for the destruction of as many as a third of Iraq&#x27;s missile launchers and radars by the time the invasion commenced on March 20. Numerous aircraft, such as the Panavia Tornado fighter-bomber, penetrated Iraqi airspace to conduct bombing raids during the opening phase of the conflict, striking at Iraqi installations.

During the course of the invasion, there were 1,660 reports of SAM launches and similar numbers of AAA firings, for the loss of very few aircraft. While Iraq largely failed to shoot down many Coalition aircraft, the sheer numbers of their air defenses still made them dangerous until the final stages of the invasion. This was true in particular for its large number of short-range missile and AAA weapons, which made low-altitude missions deadly and were harder to suppress. Where possible, Coalition forces conducted stand-off strikes from outside the range of these defenses. The unsuccessful 2003 attack on Karbala exemplifies the dangers faced by aircraft operating at low altitudes around air defenses.

===2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine===

Many Ukrainian air defence facilities were reportedly destroyed or damaged in the first days of the invasion by Russian air strikes. On 5 March 2022, the Russian Air Force (VVS) declared that it had achieved air superiority, 11 days after the beginning of the invasion, but not air supremacy. However, that same day, Russia lost at least ten aircraft. On 11 March 2022, retired United States Air Force Lieutenant General David Deptula stated in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the Russian Air Force had not achieved air superiority, noting that supposedly vulnerable Ukrainian drones had continued to operate against Russian forces.

While several early air strikes on Yavoriv in Western Ukraine were performed by Russian bombers, their munitions were firing from a distance while flying within Russian air space, rather than entering Ukrainian air space; on 13 March 2022, dozens of air-launched cruise missiles were launched from within Russia to reach Western Ukraine, because it was allegedly too dangerous for the Russian Air Force to fly over Ukrainian space due to Ukrainian air defenses. Ukrainian mid-range SAM sites forced planes to fly low, making them vulnerable to Stinger and other shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles, while a lack of training and flight hours for Russian pilots allegedly rendered them inexperienced for the type of close ground support missions typical of modern air forces. On 18 May 2022, near Izyum, a Russian Zhitel electronic warfare apparatus was detected, located, and disabled by Ukraine&#x27;s ground and air forces.

On 30 August 2022, Command of Ukrainian Air Force (KpsZSU) released a video of its MiG-29 jets firing AGM-88 HARM missiles against Russian air defenses, one day after an alleged attack on Russian radar site for S-400 SAM batteries near Sevastopol in Russian-occupied Crimea. Earlier in the Summer, multiple Russian SAM batteries had been hit and the remains of AGM-88 missiles had been found on site. The U.S. government acknowledged the previously undisclosed transfer of AGM-88 missiles to Ukraine on August 8, 2022.

There are also suspicions of M31A1 GMLRS guided rockets firing from M142 HIMARS rocket artillery been used by Ukrainian military against Russian air defense systems.

On 15 February 2023 the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) wrote that neither the Russian Air Force (VVS) nor the Ukrainian Air Force (KpsZSU) have gained air superiority.

==Weapons==

The weapons most often associated with this mission are anti-radiation missiles (ARMs), which work by homing in on radio emission sources like radar antennae. These missiles are equipped with relatively small warheads, limiting collateral damage, but can easily destroy radar antennae and thus cripple an enemy&#x27;s air defense system. Early examples of ARMs could be fooled by turning off the radar system, which would cease emitting radiation for the missile to track; more recent missiles are fitted with fire-control systems which &quot;remember&quot; where the source was and continue towards that location. Anti-radiation missiles proved particularly effective during the Vietnam War where, despite the small number carried relative to other munitions, they accounted for 46% of all SA-2 batteries destroyed.

However, a weapon need not be designed specifically for SEAD missions to be used to damage or destroy a component of an air defense system. A Paveway LGB for example is not a SEAD-specific munition, but when used to destroy a radar antenna it still achieves the desired effect. The American AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon is a valuable SEAD weapon due to its fairly long standoff range which allows the launching aircraft to avoid being threatened by all but the longest-range missiles, and its relatively large area of destruction against lightly armored targets.

Possibly the most effective type of unguided (&quot;dumb&quot;) weapon used during SEAD strikes are cluster bombs. This is due to the fact many SAM sites are dispersed over a fairly wide area (in order to increase the difficulty of inflicting serious damage on the battery) and the relative &quot;softness&quot; of the targets (unarmored missile launchers, exposed radar antennas, etc.). The Mk-20 Rockeye II anti-armor cluster munition and the CBU-87 general-purpose cluster munition are typical examples of these types of weapons.

Artillery is also used to conduct SEAD missions. After World War II, the combined arms nature of warfare meant an increased role in ground forces performing SEAD missions in support of air operations. During the Cold War the American military developed a joint definition of SEAD responsibilities, with the Army responsible for all SEAD missions within the range of observable fire and the Air Force for all missions further away. The Soviet Union placed less emphasis on using artillery to conduct SEAD missions, although where possible artillery would be used to clear a path for attack helicopters. Because of their superior range, rocket artillery such as MLRS are the ideal weapon for conducting SEAD operations.

Loitering Munitions and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play an increasingly vital role in conducting SEAD missions. Due to the dangerous nature of attacking air defenses, the use of UAVs can provide a more cost-effective and less risky method of conducting SEAD. This is especially true since the pilot is not directly at risk and so a commander may be more willing to sacrifice UAVs to accomplish the mission. The first UAVs used in the SEAD role occurred during the Vietnam War, when versions of the Lightning Bug were adapted to carry chaff and other electronic countermeasures. Modern examples of SEAD-specific loitering munitions include the IAI Harpy which loiters over areas with potential SAM activity, searches for SAM activity, and then crashes (with in-built warhead) into the target.

=== Aircraft ===
* Eurofighter Typhoon ECR: It is the successor of the Panavia Tornado ECR / SEAD for the German Air Force. The program is known in Germany as LUWES (&quot;Luftgestätze Wirkung im Elektromagnetischen Spektrum&quot;). It is planned to reach its IOC by 2029. It is a 2-seat Eurofighter. Airbus Defence is the leading company for the development of the aircraft. In the SEAD/DEAD configuration it is planned to be equipped with:
** 2 GaN Escort Jammer Pods from Saab, based on the Arexis system, with a 360° coverage 
** Emitter Location System
** 6 missiles SPEAR EW
** 4 long-range air-to-air missiles Meteor
** 2 short range air-to-air missiles IRIS-T
** 3 fuel tanks
* F-35
** US Air Force The F-35A will be the future &quot;Wild Weasel&quot; of the Air Force, it will therefore replace the F-16CJ Fighting Falcon. A program for a new missile is ongoing (look at the section &quot;Missiles&quot; below). Some structural modifications were needed to integrate sensors and the new munition planned. Those modifications were applied to the Lots 14 in 15 of F-35 production.
** British Armed Forces The F-35B will fulfil the SEAD role with the integration of the SPEAR EW missiles as describes below.

=== Missiles ===
* Spear EW 
*: It is a new missile being developed by MBDA UK designed for SEAD missions. It is targeting integrated ground air defence (static and mobile), as well as the radar systems of ships. It uses next-gen miniature electronic warfare payloads (jammer and decoy). It is based on the SPEAR physical and electrical systems, but the seeker is replaced, the warhead is smaller, it embarks more fuel, and a modular EW payload with loitering capabilities. It will equip the British F-35B, 4 missiles will be able to fit in the missile bay.
* Stand-in Attack Weapon (SiAW) program 
*:A new program of the US Air Force for a new SEAD / DEAD weapon. Contracts have been issued to fund the initial development with Lockheed Martin, L3 Harris Technologies and Northrop Grumman that are in competition. During the Phase 1, the USAF is aligning the capabilities of the missile systems to the needs of the air force and to the technical requirements of the F-35. The end goal is 3,000 SiAW missiles for USD $8.6 billion.
*:* Northrop Grumman is offering the AARGM-ER, the latest variant of the AGM-88 HARM that is being developed for the US Navy after having been selected. Its low rate initial production started, and it is being integrated to the F-35C.
*:* Lockheed is starting the program from scratch with a new digital design. Lockheed leverages the advanced digital solutions developed by Skunk Works for other programs in this project. The concept is an open, agile, digital weapon.
*:* L3 Communications, part of L3 Harris acquired a radar / sensor supplier back in 2017, Mustang Technology Group LP, and with the new consolidated competence center, it is developing its new offer for this program.
* AGM-88G AARGM-ER: 
*: It is the latest variant of the AGM-88, and is being integrated to the US Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and the EA-18G Growler. The Australian government approved the purchase of 60 missiles for $431 million in August 2023. The Netherlands Air force announced the purchase of the missile in June 2023 for its F-35A.

<text>The Legionaries of Christ (in , abbreviated L.C.) is a Roman Catholic religious congregation of pontifical right founded on January 3, 1941, by the disgraced Mexican priest Marcial Maciel. It belongs constitutively to the spiritual family of Regnum Christi together with the Consecrated Women of Regnum Christi and the Lay Consecrated Men of Regnum Christi. Its official name is the Congregation of the Legionaries of Christ.

== History ==

=== Foundation in fact ===
On January 3, 1941, the &quot;Apostolic Missionary Mission of the Sacred Heart of Jesus&quot; was founded in Mexico City as a separate section of the Diocesan Seminary of Cuernavaca. This initiative was promoted by seminarian Marcial Maciel, marking the beginning of what would later become the Legion of Christ. The creation of this new entity had the approval of Bishop Francisco González Arias, Bishop of Cuernavaca, and Archbishop Luis María Martínez, Archbishop of Mexico City. The &quot;missionary work&quot;, as it was called at the beginning, was composed of a group of seminarians with the purpose of forming a new religious congregation. This objective was recorded in the diary of the founding community, where the seminarians referred to themselves as &quot;future congregated&quot;.

On March 25, 1946, a significant step was taken with the establishment of the first novitiate house, in what is called a &quot;foundation in fact&quot;, since the congregation did not yet have formal recognition by the Catholic Church in Rome.

==Affiliated groups==
The Congregation of the Legionaries of Christ is a Roman Catholic clerical religious congregation of Pontifical Right for men that forms part of the Regnum Christi Federation, founded by Maciel in 1959, which includes the Legionaries of Christ, the Society of Apostolic Life of the Consecrated Women of Regnum Christi, the Society of Apostolic Life of the Lay Consecrated Men of Regnum Christi, and other Catholics who associate individually. Its members add the nominal letters (LC) after their names to indicate their membership in the Congregation. The &quot;larger culture&quot; is often referred to as &quot;the movement&quot; within the Regnum Christi Federation.

==Ethos==

Members of the Legion take vows of humility, poverty, chastity, and obedience. The vow of humility, which is not one of the three vows taken by all major Catholic religious institutes, obligates Legionaries not to seek positions of power within the Legion or the Church as a whole. In addition, until 2007, all Legionaries were compelled to take &quot;private vows&quot;, never to &quot;speak ill of Maciel or any superiors, and to report to their superiors anyone who did&quot;, a policy that impeded the discovery of wrongdoing by Maciel and other Legionary leaders, according to investigative journalist Jason Berry. This vow was lifted by the pope, and has not been taken by new Legionaries.

Love for Christ is, for Legionaries, a personal experience. Through the Gospel, the cross, and the Eucharist, Legionary spirituality teaches that the Legionary should seek to know Christ intimately, and love him in a passionate way by embracing him as their model of holiness. Their spirituality is Christ-centered with a particular emphasis on the Sacred Heart, which is the patron of the Legion, in their vocation as religious and priests.

Love for Mary is seen as arising from the imitation of Christ. In the Legion, Our Lady is venerated as both Mother of the Church and of the individual Legionary&#x27;s vocation. Legionaries consecrate their spiritual and apostolic lives to her care, and seek to take on her virtues of faith, hope, charity, obedience to God, humility, and cooperation with Christ&#x27;s plan of redemption and justice.

Love for Souls is defined in the Legion as an ardent desire to spread Christ&#x27;s kingdom in this world. Legionaries focus on helping the greatest number of souls know and love Christ. In Legionary theology, time is a gift given by God which he wants to maximize to spread the Gospel and help bring the love of God to many souls.

==Formation==


According to the National Catholic Reporter, the Legion or Legionaries of Christ was founded so early in the career of Marcial Maciel, he was ordained as a priest after he was leading the order.

The Legion has been described as &quot;conservative&quot; and focusing on &quot;ministering to the wealthy and powerful in the belief that by evangelizing society&#x27;s leaders, the beneficial impact on society is multiplied&quot;. Today the Legion purports its priests &quot;are the confessors and chaplains to some of the most powerful businessmen in Latin America&quot;.

Legionaries have been described as &quot;easy to spot in Rome, young men with close-cropped hair in traditional cassocks or double-breasted blazers, walking two by two like a spiritual army.&quot; Legion culture has been described as &quot;insular&quot; and &quot;cultlike&quot;.

The Legion began in Mexico where its largest base remains. It is said to have created &quot;a vast network&quot; of private schools and universities for the children of the elite in that country, which provided funding for his movement’s worldwide expansion.
Houses of formation were established in Spain and Italy within its first decade. In the 1960s, chapters of the organization were founded in Ireland and then in the United States. In the 1970s and 80s the congregation expanded throughout Latin America. In the 90s it expanded to France and Central Europe.

The Legion presents itself as dedicated to advancing the Church&#x27;s mission in the world, and to this end claims to submit candidates to a rigorous formation of four dimensions: human, spiritual, intellectual, and apostolic. Critics accused the Legion of producing priests and religious who all spoke and behaved in the same way. The Legion&#x27;s defenders argued that, just as members of a family receive similar upbringing, so the members of the Legion were formed in like ways, but still respected the freedom of the individual. The new constitutions approved by Pope Francis present a more balanced approach to the formation of members.

As is the practice in many religious congregations of the Roman Catholic Church, Legionaries may visit their family according to their superiors&#x27; discretion and the norms of the Congregation, the average being for about 4–7 days a year not counting special occasions. Regular contact with their families is encouraged with respect to written, verbal, and video communication.

==Apostolates==

The apostolate of the Legionaries (i.e. organizations &quot;directed to serving and evangelizing the world&quot;) has many aspects, but focuses on the following:

:*Education and teaching at all levels. 
:*Pastoral attention to youth and families.
:*Catechesis and preaching of retreats and spiritual exercises.
:*Evangelization and mission work (especially in the Mexican State of Quintana Roo in the Yucatán Peninsula).
:*Attention to the underprivileged, especially those groups that undergo the greatest spiritual, moral or material privation.
:*Works of Christian charity and mercy.
:*Supporting bishops in the formation of diocesan seminarians and in the ongoing formation of their priests.
:*Spiritual attention to &quot;Regnum Christi&quot; members and accompanying them in their formation.

In the US, the congregation runs four schools. In 2012, all three of its high schools (Everest Collegiate High School, The Highlands School and Pinecrest Academy) were named in the list of top 50 Catholic High Schools developed by the Cardinal Newman Society&quot;.&quot;

In Mexico, the Legionaries administer the Anahuac University Network. Legionaries operate centers of education (minor seminaries, seminaries, schools and/or universities) in Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, Korea, Ireland, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, the United States, and Canada.

In 2006, the Legion launched a test phase of Mission Network in the United States. &quot;Catholic Mission Network, Inc.&quot;, is the umbrella organization that oversees and approves Legionary-endorsed apostolates that are not stand-alone like a school or retreat center. Its purpose is to provide both structure and supervision of the apostolates, and an overview as to what the Legion/Regnum Christi does as a whole, with brand-name-type recognition.

The youth wing of &quot;Regnum Christi,&quot; offering spirituality for youth 11 to 16, is called ECYD. The commitments in ECYD vary over time, adapting to the ages of the members. Many ECYD members are involved in clubs run or overseen by Legionaries or consecrated members of &quot;Regnum Christi&quot;.

==Founder==
Marcial Maciel was born in Cotija, Michoacán on March 10, 1920, into a devout Catholic family—four of his uncles were bishops—during a time in which the Mexican government was fiercely anticlerical. He became a priest after a troubled youth. 
Maciel was expelled from two seminaries for reasons that have never been explained, and became a priest only after one of his bishop uncles ordained him after private studies.

Maciel was ordained a priest on November 26, 1944, in Mexico City, but had already founded the congregation in 1941, with the support of Francisco González Arias, Bishop of Cuernavaca. Two years later in 1946, he presented a donation to the Vatican for $10,000, &quot;a huge sum in a city reeling from the war.&quot;

Pope John Paul II praised him in lavish ceremonies and called him an &quot;efficacious guide to youth&quot;. In general, the Holy See held Maciel &quot;up as a model of sainthood for the faithful&quot; in large part &quot;because he brought in money and vocations to the priesthood.&quot;

In the Legion of Christ, Maciel was called &quot;nuestro padre&quot;. Members of the congregation were taught &quot;the Legion message&quot;—that Maciel &quot;had his enemies, but that he was a living saint for his leadership as an evangelist, drawing the church back from liberal abuses of the Second Vatican Council and attracting young men to a strict religious life.&quot;

After Maciel&#x27;s abuses came to light, Pope Benedict XVI sentenced him to a life of &quot;prayer and penance&quot; in 2006. Maciel died in Jacksonville, Florida, on January 30, 2008, aged 87, and was buried in his hometown of Cotija de la Paz, Michoacán, Mexico. Immediately following Maciel&#x27;s death, the Legion&#x27;s leaders proclaimed &quot;his ascent to heaven&quot;.

==Abuses==
According to the BBC, the 2019 report by the order found that Marcial Maciel had abused at least 60 children, and that another 33 priests of the order abused minors, bringing the total number of children abused by the order since its founding in 1941 to at least 175.

One of the first English language public reports of abuse came in 1997 exposing abused that happened in the 1950s. Juan Vaca and seven other early victims of Maciel &quot;gave graphic accounts&quot; in the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; of how they watched Maciel inject himself with a morphine painkiller in Spain and Rome in the 1950s and finally had to be hospitalized. Cardinal Valerio Valeri received reports &quot;from an older seminarian in Mexico City&quot; and the head of the one Legion high school at the time (Cumbres Institute), who were concerned about Maciel&#x27;s drug use and &quot;overly affectionate behavior with boys&quot;. Valeri suspended Maciel but in 1959 he was reinstated by Clemente Micara, the interim vicar of Rome.

For a long time, the Vatican dismissed accusations by seminarians that Father Maciel had abused them sexually, some when they were as young as 12. After years of denial by the Congregation and the Regnum Christi movement and dismissal of accusations made by many former members, an investigation prompted by the Vatican concluded that allegations of sexual abuse of minors by Maciel were true. On 1 May 2010, the Holy See issued a communique on its year-long investigation of the Legionaries, condemning &quot;system of power&quot; created by Marcial Maciel, that hid &quot;true crimes&quot; and a private life &quot;without scruples or authentic religious sentiment.&quot; The communique called for the Legionaries to follow a &quot;path of purification&quot;, including a &quot;sincere encounter&quot; with Maciel&#x27;s abuse victims.

The superiors of the congregation did not officially inform the rest of the congregation until a year after his death, during which time, they continued to permit an internal culture of revering him as a saint. The Legionaries of Christ eventually acknowledged their founder&#x27;s &quot;reprehensible and objectively immoral behavior&quot; as head of the congregation. As a result of the scandal, Pope Benedict XVI also removed the vow of charity, which required members to maintain secrecy, impermeability, and refrain from criticism of superiors. The &quot;very serious and objectively immoral acts&quot; of Maciel, which were &quot;confirmed by incontrovertible testimonies&quot;, represented &quot;true crimes and manifest a life without scruples or authentic religious sentiment&quot;, the Vatican said.

After the scandals of Maciel came to light, some priests and seminarians left the congregation. Several schools and centers of formation closed.

In 2019, the organization admitted that Father Fernando Martínez Suarez had abused eight minors between 1990 and 1993. A month later, they admitted that members of the organization had sexually abused 175 children between 1941 and 2019. 60 of those were abused by its founder, some of whom were his own children from several relations. Six of the priests have died, eight have left the priesthood, one left the Congregation, and 18 continue in their posts but have been removed from tasks where they interact with the public or with children. The 2019 report by the Legion noted that 14 of the 33 priests who abused minors had been victims themselves when they were young, thus highlighting what it called &quot;chains of abuse&quot;, where &quot;a victim of a Legionnaire, over time, becomes in turn an aggressor&quot;.
The Legion of Christ also singled out former Secretariat of State Angelo Sodano for leading efforts to cover up the reports of abuse.

In 1998, nine men lodged formal charges at the Vatican that Maciel had abused them as youths and young men while studying under him; Maciel was initially investigated by the Holy See and suspended from his ministry in 2006. In 2009, an apostolic visitation was ordered by Pope Benedict XVI and shortly after Cardinal Velasio De Paolis was delegated to impose &quot;structural changes&quot;.

In 2014, the five-year renewal process was completed with the approval of amended constitutions; five years later, Pope Francis referred to the new Constitutions approvingly.

On December 21, 2019, the Legionaries of Christ released the &quot;Report 1941-2019 on the Phenomenon of Sexual Abuse of Minors in the Congregation of the Legionaries of Christ from its Founding to the Present Day&quot;. 

According to the report, &quot;the report was the result of an extensive study carried out by an internal commission that, within the limits of a study of this nature, verified the various accusations of sexual abuse of minors throughout the history of the Congregation of the Legionaries of Christ. It collected the global statistics of cases of abuse by its priests between 1941 and 2019 and included an appendix with the steps taken to prevent future abuse and guarantee safe environments.

On the same day, Father John Connor, LC, then North American territorial director and currently the general director of the Congregation worldwide, released a communication compiling the previously released names of Legionaries of Christ who were active in ministry with substantiated sexual abuse allegations in the United States into a list.

One month later, Father John again addressed the territory in a letter saying, &quot;We must pray that these victims receive the healing they need and that those who are still trying to find the courage to come forward are able to find it. This is an important part of the healing process for victims and it’s important for the Congregation to listen to the experiences of victims so that we can make reparation and be further purified.&quot;

In his letter, Father John also affirmed that facing our history with determination and helping victims heal is an important part of our mission as a Congregation, not a distraction from it. It is what God is calling us to at this point in our history. We are committed to transparency about the abuse that has been perpetrated by Legionaries of Christ, to working towards a culture in which all our priests deeply understand the effects of sexual abuse and their role as spiritual fathers dedicated to nourishing God’s people, and to helping those who have been harmed to heal from their wounds.&quot;

==Apostolic visitation==
In early 2009, the Vatican ordered an apostolic visitation of the institutions of the Legionaries of Christ following disclosures of sexual impropriety by Maciel. Vatican authorities named five bishops from five different countries, each one in charge of investigating the Legionaries in a particular part of the world:
*Ricardo Watty Urquidi, Bishop of Tepic, Mexico, in charge of Mexico and Central America, where the Legion has 44 houses, 250 priests and 115–120 religious seminarians;
*Charles J. Chaput, Archbishop of Denver, in charge of the United States and Canada, where the Legion has 24 houses, 130 priests and 260 religious seminarians;
*Giuseppe Versaldi, Bishop of Alessandria, in charge of Italy, Israel, the Philippines, and South Korea, where the Legion has 16 houses, 200 priests and 420 religious seminarians (in Italy 13, 168 and 418 respectively);
*Ricardo Ezzati Andrello, Archbishop of Concepción, Chile, in charge of Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Brazil and Venezuela, where the Legion has 20 houses, 122 priests and 122 religious seminarians;
*Ricardo Blázquez Pérez, Bishop of Bilbao, Spain, in charge of Spain, France, Germany, Switzerland, Ireland, Holland, Poland, Austria and Hungary, where the Legion has 20 houses, 105 priests, and 160 religious seminarians.

They met with the pope to report on the visitation in April 2010, and the Vatican issued a statement on 1 May 2010.

==Renewal==
The Legion underwent a visitation by the Vatican and a process of renewal through a series of discussions revolving around the charism of the movement, the relationship of the congregation to the lay movement, and the place of both within the Church.

In 2006, Maciel was investigated by the Holy See and suspended from his ministry, initially over breaches of celibacy. This followed public revelations that he had sexually abused minors, which were later confirmed. The Legion&#x27;s additional vow of &quot;charity&quot; had been used to induce secrecy, promising not to criticize superiors. This was lifted by Pope Benedict XVI in December 2007.

Cardinal Velasio De Paolis was delegated to examine the Legionaries&#x27; constitutions and conduct a visitation of its lay affiliate Regnum Christi in 2012. On October 19, 2012, De Paolis published a cover letter for a summary of the Regnum Christi&#x27;s charism which he had approved as a working document.

Under the guidance of Cardinal Velasio De Paolis, the congregation announced the congregation&#x27;s Extraordinary General Chapter in Rome in January 2014, for a &quot;total restructuring&quot;. Apologies to the victims were issued and a compensation commission established. In 2019, new statutes were adopted introducing collegial leadership and more transparent community life to prevent possible abuses in the future.

The Legion completed a five-year renewal process that included a revision of its constitutions, which were approved during an extraordinary general chapter. The entire congregation revised the Constitutional document under the direction of a central committee and presented a final version to the new Pope Francis. On 4 November 2014, after an extensive process of the reform of the Legionaries of Christ, the Vatican approved the congregation&#x27;s amended constitutions.

In December 2019, the organization accepted responsibility for 175 cases of child sexual abuse by 33 priests, including 60 minors who were abused by Marcial Maciel. However, Archbishop Rogelio Cabrera López, head of the Episcopal Conference of Mexico, said on December 22, 2019, that the report is &quot;late and incomplete&quot;: &quot;How is it possible that the founder committed crimes for 70 years and no one ever said anything?&quot;

10 years after the Holy See took over the Legion, in an address directed to Legionaries during their General Chapter of 2020 and to the General Assemblies of Regnum Christi held during the same period, Pope Francis recognized the progress made in their renewal saying: &quot;The new Constitutions and the new Statutes are truly &#x27;new,&#x27; be it because they reflect a new spirit and a new vision of religious life, consistent with Vatican Council II and the directions of the Holy See, be it because they are the product of a three-year endeavor, in which all your communities were involved and which has led to a change in mentality.&quot;

However, a report emerged around January 2020 alleging that the papal envoy in charge (the by then deceased Cardinal Velasio De Paolis) &quot;refused to punish or even investigate&quot; a case where a Legion priest, who had direct links to the founder, raped &quot;little girls aged 6 to 8 or 9&quot; in front of their classmates at an elite Catholic school in Cancún, Mexico, and noted a &quot;high-level cover-up by superiors who are still in power&quot;. According to a former Legion priest, Rev. Christian Borgogno, &quot;De Paolis&#x27; decision to leave in place Legion superiors, many of whom were close to Maciel, &#x27;made reform&#x27; of the Legion &#x27;impossible. In response, a month later the Legion promised &quot;accountability and transparency&quot; and &quot;vowed to investigate the confirmed cases of past abuse by 33 priests and 71 seminarians&quot;.

==Notable members==

*Deomar De Guedes Vaz (born 1961), second general councilor
*Anthony Freeman (1988–2018), religious brother
*Fernando Vérgez Alzaga (born 1945), president of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State and President of the Governorate of Vatican City State, since 2021 (cardinal in 2022)

<text>The Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall () is a national monument and tourist attraction erected in memory of Chiang Kai-shek, former President of the Republic of China. It is located in Taipei, Taiwan.

The monument, surrounded by a park, stands at the east end of Memorial Hall Square. It is flanked on the north and south by the National Theater and National Concert Hall.

==Description==
The Memorial Hall is white with four sides. The roof is blue and octagonal, a shape that picks up the symbolism of the number eight, a number traditionally associated in Chinese culture with abundance and good fortune. Two sets of white stairs, each with 89 steps to represent Chiang&#x27;s age at the time of his death, lead to the main entrance. The ground level of the memorial houses a library and a museum documenting Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s life and career, with exhibits detailing Taiwan&#x27;s history and development. The upper level contains the main hall, in which a large statue of Chiang Kai-shek is located, and where a guard mounting ceremony takes place at regular intervals.

==Development==

After President Chiang Kai-shek died on 5 April 1975, the executive branch of the government established a Funeral Committee to build a memorial. The design, by architect Yang Cho-cheng, was chosen in a competition. Yang&#x27;s design incorporated many elements of traditional Chinese architecture to mirror that of the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing, China. (The Kuomintang (KMT) revered Dr. Sun as founder of the party and the government Chiang had led.) Groundbreaking for the memorial took place on 31 October 1976, the 90th anniversary of Chiang&#x27;s birth. The hall officially opened on 5 April 1980, the fifth anniversary of the leader&#x27;s death.

Yang&#x27;s design placed the main building at the east end of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Park (), covering over in Zhongzheng District. A main gate, the Gate of Great Centrality and Perfect Uprightness () was placed at the west end on Chung Shan South Road, with a Gate of Great Loyalty () standing at the north side on Hsin Yi (Xinyi) Road and a Gate of Great Piety () standing at the south side on Ai Kuo (Aiguo) East Road. A Boulevard of Homage, bordered by manicured bushes, connected the main hall with the square.

==Subsequent history==
The square became Taipei&#x27;s site of choice for mass gatherings as soon as it opened. The nature of many of those gatherings gave the site new public meanings. The hall and square became the hub of events in the 1980s and early 1990s that ushered Taiwan into its era of modern democracy. Of the many pro-democracy demonstrations that took place at the square, the most influential were the Wild Lily student movement rallies of 1990. The movement provided the impetus for the far-reaching political reforms of President Lee Teng-hui. These culminated in the first popular elections of national leaders in 1996.

The site&#x27;s importance in the development of Taiwan&#x27;s democracy led to the plaza&#x27;s rededication as Liberty Square by President Chen Shui-bian in 2007. Memorial Hall was also renamed in a dedication to democracy. The announcement of the new names were greeted with hostility by Kuomintang officials. The original dedication to Chiang was subsequently restored to the hall by President Ma Ying-jeou, while the name Liberty Square was eventually affirmed by officials across party lines.

In 2017, on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the February 28 Incident and the 30th anniversary of the lifting of martial law, Taiwan&#x27;s Ministry of Culture announced plans to transform the hall into a national center for “facing history, recognizing agony, and respecting human rights.” Scholars and experts were invited to form an advisory group to help plan the hall&#x27;s transformation. Public discussion of the transformation began the following year in forums held throughout Taiwan. 

The Chinese inscription now over the main gate declares the plaza &quot;Liberty Square&quot;. The calligraphic style recalls that of Wang Xizhi in the East Jin Dynasty (see Chinese calligraphy). The style is noted for its sense of vitality, movement and freedom. The characters in the inscription are placed in left-to-right sequence to follow modern practice in Taiwan. (The right-to-left order of ancient Chinese tradition had been observed at the site up until then.)

In 2018, pro-independence student activists stormed the hall and threw paint on the statue of Chiang Kai-Shek; two were arrested and penalized for NT$2,000.

In 2019 the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall hosted an exhibition by the Chinese artist Ling Feng (靈峰). The 88 works exhibited were sharply critical of the Chinese Communist Party and authoritarianism in general. 

In 2024, the Ministry of Culture announced the removal of military honor guards from the memorial as part of efforts to stop the promotion of a &quot;cult of personality&quot; around Chiang Kai-shek and &quot;authoritarianism&quot;.

<doc id="573517" wikidata="Q4970683" url="?curid=573517" title="British Rail Class 03">
<text>The British Rail Class 03 locomotive was, together with the similar Class 04, one of British Railways&#x27; most successful 0-6-0 diesel-mechanical shunters. 230 were built at Doncaster and Swindon works between 1957 and 1962, and were numbered D2000–D2199 and D2370–D2399 (later 03004 to 03399). D2370 and D2371 were used as departmental locomotives and originally numbered 91 and 92 respectively.

==Overview==
The fleet of 230 locomotives entered service between December 1957 and June 1962. Like other shunters of this size, the Class 03 was built for light duties where a larger locomotive was not needed, especially for shunting at locomotive and carriage depots and as station pilots, or where larger or heavier locomotives could not be used. The reduction over time in the demand for shunting locomotives meant that they were progressively withdrawn from 1968 onwards, many being sold to private industry, including three that were exported to Belgium. However, some remained in service much longer, with two examples on the Isle of Wight lasting until 1993. Mainland examples had gone by 1989, the last being those allocated to Birkenhead North TMD, for use on the Birkenhead Dock Branch.

In 1998, one of the Isle of Wight locos, 03179, was reinstated by the West Anglia Great Northern for service at Hornsey depot. It was named &quot;Clive&quot; after a depot employee. It was not fitted with Train Protection &amp; Warning System equipment and thus confined to the depot from 2002. It was operated subsequently by First Capital Connect until withdrawal in 2008. In 2016 it was sold by Govia Thameslink Railway to the Rushden, Higham and Wellingborough Railway.

==Technical details==

The engine is a Gardner 8-cylinder, 4-stroke 8L3 of connected to a Wilson-Drewry CA5 R7, 5-speed epicyclic gearbox with RF11 spiral bevel reverse and final-drive unit. Drive is through a jackshaft mounted beneath the cab, driving the wheels through coupling rods.

During their later life, some locomotives were fitted with dual (air and vacuum) brakes. These were 03059, 03063, 03066, 03073, 03078, 03084, 03086, 03089, 03094, 03112, 03152, 03158, 03162, 03170, 03179, 03180, 03196, 03197, 03371, 03397 and 03399.

==Operation==
===Shunting===
Originally the Class 03s were often deployed where their attributes of short wheelbase and light weight enabled them to operate where other shunters could not. On lines such as that to Ipswich docks, bridge weight restrictions prevented the ubiquitous Class 08s from operating. Another common use was as station pilot, usually coupled to a shunters&#x27; truck to ensure operation of track circuits which did not always register the passage of the 03 due to its short wheelbase.

By 1979, Class 03s&#x27; operations included:
* Depot pilot duties at Hull Botanic Gardens DMU depot and Bradford Hammerton Street DMU depot
* Docks at Ipswich, Kings Lynn, and Poplar, London
* Freight trips along the Team Valley branch (Gateshead) and the Gwendraeth Valley line
* Shunting duties at Boston Yard, Ipswich Upper and Lower yards, Lincoln engineers&#x27; yard, and Tweedmouth yard near Berwick-upon-Tweed
* Spare loco on standby at Boston and Kings Lynn
* Motive power on the Kirkley goods branch line in Lowestoft
* Station pilot duties at Bradford Exchange, Hull Paragon, Ipswich, Newcastle Central, Norwich Thorpe, and Sunderland

===Passenger duties===
Despite the limited scope for the use of such a small locomotive on main line passenger duties, there were a number of duties rostered to the class. During the early 1970s Southern Region Class 03s worked Channel Islands boat trains through the streets to the harbour along the Weymouth Harbour Tramway, displacing the last of the 1366 Class 0-6-0 pannier tanks. In 1980, a Class 03 at Ipswich was booked to shunt the 23:20 Peterborough – Liverpool Street onto the rear of the 23:45 Norwich – Liverpool Street. Also, according to Mangapps Railway Museum, 03089 once hauled a Blackpool to Scarborough express along the York to Scarborough Line from Malton to Scarborough.

===Burry Port &amp; Gwendraeth Valley Line===
Several examples were rebuilt with cut-down cabs for working on the Burry Port &amp; Gwendraeth Valley Line, as there were several low bridges on the line that precluded the use of normal height locomotives.

The modified examples were nos. 03119, 03120, 03141, 03142, 03144, 03145, 03151, 03152 and late addition (ex-Bristol) 03382. Their duties included shunting (for example at Burry Port), and hauling full coal trains down from the valley&#x27;s pits. For this latter duty they sometimes worked triple-headed.

They were replaced by Class 08/9 locomotives, which were also rebuilt to a reduced height. Several cut-down locomotives have been preserved.

The Isle of Wight shunters, nos. 03079 and 03179, were also rebuilt with cut-down cabs, to enable them to pass through a low tunnel in Ryde.
==Preservation==
Fifty-six members of the class survive in preservation.

Loco numbers in bold mean their current number.

==Model railways==
Mainline Railways and Replica each offered OO gauge models. Mainline Railways introduced their OO gauge Class 03s in 1983; one in BR green and 03382 in BR blue. Mainline&#x27;s original &#x27;split-chassis&#x27; tooling later passed to Bachmann. When the company later took the decision to produce the Class 04 in its place the tooling was altered, retaining the split chassis power arrangement. However, Bachmann later announced that they would be producing a totally new Class 03 in OO gauge, which was introduced in 2010. In early 2011, Modelzone released special edition examples of the Isle of Wight prototypes, which were produced by Bachmann.

Graham Farish currently offers a British N gauge model. Past models have included D2388 in BR green livery and 03066 in BR blue livery.

In 2008, Bachmann introduced O gauge brass models of the Class 03 in BR green and BR blue liveries. Heljan currently offer a model in O gauge (7mm), which is available in BR green or rail blue with chevrons.

<text>The Bixaceae are a family of dicotyledonous plants commonly called the achiote family. Under the Cronquist system, the family was traditionally placed in the order Violales. However, newer arrangements move it, with some other families previously in the Violales, into the Malvales.

Although small, this family includes trees, herbs, and shrubs. The plants are bisexual, and all species have five sepals. All plants within the Bixaceae produce a red, orange, or yellow latex.

== Genera ==
The Bixaceae include three genera and a total of 25 species, although &quot;Cochlospermum&quot; is sometimes placed into its own family Cochlospermaceae. The best-known species is the source of annatto, the achiote, which belongs to the type genus of the family.

<doc id="573527" wikidata="Q657055" url="?curid=573527" title="Greco-Turkish War (1897)">
<text>The Greco-Turkish War of 1897 or the Ottoman-Greek War of 1897 ( or ), also called the Thirty Days&#x27; War and known in Greece as the Black &#x27;97 (, &quot;Mauro &#x27;97&quot;) or the Unfortunate War (), was a war fought between the Kingdom of Greece and the Ottoman Empire. Its immediate cause involved the status of the Ottoman province of Crete, whose Greek-majority population had long desired union with Greece. Despite the Ottoman victory on the field, an autonomous Cretan State under Ottoman suzerainty was established the following year (as a result of the intervention of the Great Powers after the war), with Prince George of Greece and Denmark as its first High Commissioner.

The war put the military and political personnel of Greece to test in an official open war for the first time since the Greek War of Independence in 1821. For the Ottoman Empire, this was also the first war-effort to test a re-organized military system. The Ottoman army operated under the guidance of a German military mission led (1883–1895) by Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz, who had reorganized the Ottoman military after its defeat in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878.

The conflict proved that Greece was wholly unprepared for war. Plans, fortifications and weapons were non-existent, the mass of the officer corps was unsuited to its tasks, and training was inadequate. As a result, the numerically superior, better-organized, -equipped and -led Ottoman forces, heavily composed of Albanian warriors with combat experience, pushed the Greek forces south out of Thessaly and threatened Athens,
only to cease fighting when the Great Powers persuaded the Sultan to agree to an armistice. The war is notable in that it was the first to be filmed on camera, though the footage has since been lost.

==Background==

In 1878 the Ottoman Empire, according to the provisions of the Congress of Berlin, signed the Pact of Halepa which entailed the implementation of the organic law of 1868, promised but never implemented by the Ottoman government, which was to give Crete a status of wide-ranging autonomy. The Ottoman commissioners, however, repeatedly ignored the convention, causing three successive rebellions in 1885, 1888 and 1889. In 1894 Sultan Abdul Hamid II re-appointed Alexander Karatheodori Pasha as governor of Crete, but Karatheodori&#x27;s zeal for the implementation of the agreement was met with fury by the Muslim population of the island and led to renewed clashes between the Greek and Muslim communities there in 1896.

To quell the unrest, Ottoman military reinforcements arrived while Greek volunteers landed on the island to support the Greek population. At the same time the fleets of the Great Powers patrolled the Cretan waters, leading to further escalation. Nevertheless, an agreement was reached with the Sultan and the tensions receded. In January 1897 inter-communal violence broke out as both sides tried to consolidate their grip on power. The Christian district of Chania was set on fire and many fled to the foreign fleet anchored outside the city. A struggle for independence and union with Greece was declared by Cretan revolutionaries.

Greek Prime Minister Theodoros Deligiannis was subjected to fierce criticism by his adversary Dimitrios Rallis over his alleged inability to handle the issue. Continuous demonstrations in Athens accused King George I and the government of betrayal of the Cretan cause. The National Society, a nationalistic, militaristic organisation that had infiltrated all levels of the army and bureaucracy, pushed for immediate confrontation with the Ottomans.

===Prelude to war===
On 6 February 1897 (according to the modern Gregorian calendar; it was 25 January 1897 according to the Julian calendar then in use in Greece and the Ottoman Empire, which was 12 days behind the Gregorian during the 19th century) the first troopships, accompanied by the battleship &quot;Hydra&quot;, sailed for Crete. Before they arrived, a small Greek Navy squadron under the command of Prince George of Greece and Denmark appeared off Crete on 12 February (31 January Julian) with orders to support the Cretan insurgents and harass Ottoman shipping. Six Great Powers (Austria-Hungary, France, the German Empire, the Kingdom of Italy, the Russian Empire, and the United Kingdom) had already deployed warships to Cretan waters to form a naval &quot;International Squadron&quot; to intervene and to maintain peace on Crete, and they warned Prince George not to engage in hostilities; Prince George returned to Greece the next day. However, the troopships disembarked two battalions of the Greek Army under Colonel Timoleon Vassos at Platanias, west of Chania, on 14 February (2 February on the Julian calendar). Despite the guarantees given by the Great Powers on Ottoman sovereignty over the island, Vassos upon his arrival unilaterally proclaimed its union with Greece. The Powers reacted by demanding that Deligiannis immediately withdraw Greek forces from the island in exchange for a statute of autonomy.

The demand was rejected, and so on 19 February (7 February Julian) the first full-scale battle between Greeks and Ottomans occurred, when the Greek expeditionary force in Crete defeated a 4,000-strong Ottoman force at the Battle of Livadeia. Ordered to keep away from Crete&#x27;s capital Canea (now Chania), Vassos accomplished little thereafter on Crete, but Cretan insurgents attacked Ottoman forces during February and March 1897. The warships of the International Squadron bombarded the insurgents to break up their attacks and put an international force of sailors and marines ashore to occupy Canea, and by the end of March major fighting on Crete came to an end, although the uprising continued.

===Opposing forces===

The Greek army was made up of three divisions, with two of them taking positions in Thessaly and one in Arta, Epirus. Crown Prince Constantine was the only general in the army. He took command of the forces on 25 March. The Greek army in Thessaly consisted of 45,000 men, 500 cavalry, and 96 guns, while that of Epirus comprised 16,000 men and 40 guns.

The opposing Ottoman army comprised eight infantry divisions, largely consisting of Albanians, plus one cavalry division. On the Thessaly front, it consisted of 58,000 men, 1,300 cavalry, and 186 guns, while in Epirus it could field 26,000 men and 29 guns. Edhem Pasha had overall command of the Ottoman forces.

Apart from the obvious difference in numbers, the two sides had also significant differences in the quality of armaments and soldiers. The Ottoman army was already being equipped with its second generation of smokeless powder repeater rifles (Mauser Models 1890 and 1893), while the Greeks were equipped with the inferior single-shot Gras rifle. There was also the potential for a naval contest. In 1897 the Greek navy consisted of three small &quot;Hydra&quot; class battleships, one cruiser, the &quot;Miaoulis&quot;, and several older small ironclads and gunboats. The Greek ships bombarded Turkish fortifications and escorted troop transports, but there was no major naval battle during the war. The Ottoman fleet had seven battleships and ironclads at least as large as the Greek battleships, and although most of these were obsolete designs, the had been rebuilt and modernized. The Ottoman navy also had several smaller ironclads, two unprotected cruisers and smaller ships including torpedo craft. The Ottoman fleet had not been maintained, perhaps due to the Sultan&#x27;s fear of a strong navy becoming a power base for plots against the government, and in 1897 when called into action most of the ships were in poor condition and could not contest control of the sea beyond the Dardanelles.

==War==
On 24th March, about 2,600 irregulars crossed the Greek border into Ottoman Macedonia in order to provoke disarray behind enemy lines by rousing locals against Ottoman administration. As a result, on 6 April Edhem Pasha mobilised his forces. His plan was to surround Greek forces and by using river Pineios as a natural barrier to push them back to central Greece. Nevertheless, his rear forces were halted while the center of his formation gained ground, altering his initial plans. The Greek plan called for a wider open field combat, which ultimately would cost heavy casualties against an already superior opponent.
There was no serious force left to prevent the Ottoman Army from entering the Greek capital, Athens. Halil Rifat Pasha, asked Abdul Hamid for permission to enter Athens. In agreement with the Great powers, the Russian Tsar, Nicholas II, telegraphed Abdul Hamid himself and demanded that the war be stopped. On 19 May, the Ottoman army stopped its advance. On 20 May 1897, a ceasefire went into effect.

===Thessalian front===
Officially, war was declared on 18 April when the Ottoman ambassador in Athens, Asim Bey, met with the Greek foreign minister announcing the cutting of diplomatic ties. Heavy fighting occurred between 21 and 22 April outside the town of Tyrnavos but when the overwhelming Ottoman forces converged and pushed together, the Greek general staff ordered a general withdrawal, spreading panic among soldiers and civilians alike. Larissa fell on 27 April, while the Greek front was being reorganised behind the strategic lines of Velestino, in Farsala. Nevertheless, a division was ordered to head for Velestino, thus cutting Greek forces in two, 60 km apart. Between 27 and 30 April, under the command of Col. Konstantinos Smolenskis, Greek forces checked and halted the Ottoman advance.

On 5 May three Ottoman divisions attacked Farsala, forcing an orderly withdrawal of Greek forces to Domokos; on the eve of those events Smolenskis had withdrawn from newly recaptured Velestino to Almyros. Volos fell into Ottoman hands on 8 May.

At Domokos the Greeks assembled 40,000 men in a strong defensive position, joined by about 2,000 Italian &quot;Redshirt&quot; volunteers under the command of Ricciotti Garibaldi, son of Giuseppe Garibaldi. The Ottoman Empire had a total of about 70,000 troops, of whom about 45,000 were directly engaged in the battle.

On 16 May the attackers sent part of their army around the flank of the Greeks to cut off their line of retreat, but it failed to arrive in time. The next day, the rest of their army made a frontal assault. Both sides fought ferociously. The Ottomans were held at bay by the fire of the defending infantry until their left flank defeated the Greek right. The Ottoman formation broke through, forcing a renewed withdrawal. Smolenskis was ordered to stand his ground at the Thermopylae passage, but on 20 May a ceasefire went into effect.

===Epirus front===
On 18 April, Ottoman forces under Ahmed Hifzi Pasha attacked the bridge of Arta but were forced to withdraw and reorganise around Pente Pigadia. Five days later Col. Thrasyvoulos Manos captured Pente Pigadia, but the Greek advance was halted due to lack of reinforcements against an already numerically superior opposition. On 12 May Greek forces tried to cut off Preveza but were forced to retreat with heavy casualties.

===Armistice===
On 20 September a peace treaty was signed between the two sides. Greece was forced to cede minor border areas and pay heavy reparations. To pay the latter, the Greek economy came under the formal oversight of the International Financial Commission. For the Greek public opinion and the military, the forced armistice was a humiliation, highlighting the unpreparedness of the country to fulfill its national aspirations.

==Aftermath==
Despite the end of the war, the uprising on Crete continued – although with no further organized combat – until November 1898, when the Great Powers evicted Ottoman forces from the island to make way for an autonomous Cretan State under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire. Officially founded in December 1898 when Prince George of Greece and Denmark arrived on Crete to take up his duties as High Commissioner, the Cretan State survived until 1913, when Greece formally annexed the island.

In Greece, the public awareness of the country&#x27;s unpreparedness for war in pursuit of its national aspirations laid the seeds for the Goudi coup of 1909, which called for immediate reforms in the Greek Army, economy, and society. When Eleftherios Venizelos came to power, as a leader of the Liberal party, he instigated reforms that transformed the Greek state, leading it to victory in the Balkan Wars fifteen years later.

<text>In systems engineering, information systems and software engineering, the systems development life cycle (SDLC), also referred to as the application development life cycle, is a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system. The SDLC concept applies to a range of hardware and software configurations, as a system can be composed of hardware only, software only, or a combination of both. There are usually six stages in this cycle: requirement analysis, design, development and testing, implementation, documentation, and evaluation. 

== Overview ==
A systems development life cycle is composed of distinct work phases that are used by systems engineers and systems developers to deliver information systems. Like anything that is manufactured on an assembly line, an SDLC aims to produce high-quality systems that meet or exceed expectations, based on requirements, by delivering systems within scheduled time frames and cost estimates. Computer systems are complex and often link components with varying origins. Various SDLC methodologies have been created, such as waterfall, spiral, agile, rapid prototyping, incremental, and synchronize and stabilize.

SDLC methodologies fit within a flexibility spectrum ranging from agile to iterative to sequential. Agile methodologies, such as XP and Scrum, focus on lightweight processes that allow for rapid changes. Iterative methodologies, such as Rational Unified Process and dynamic systems development method, focus on stabilizing project scope and iteratively expanding or improving products. Sequential or big-design-up-front (BDUF) models, such as waterfall, focus on complete and correct planning to guide larger projects and limit risks to successful and predictable results. Anamorphic development is guided by project scope and adaptive iterations.

In project management a project can include both a project life cycle (PLC) and an SDLC, during which somewhat different activities occur. According to Taylor (2004), &quot;the project life cycle encompasses all the activities of the project, while the systems development life cycle focuses on realizing the product requirements&quot;.

SDLC is not a methodology per se, but rather a description of the phases that a methodology should address. The list of phases is not definitive, but typically includes planning, analysis, design, build, test, implement, and maintenance/support. In the Scrum framework, for example, one could say a single user story goes through all the phases of the SDLC within a two-week sprint. By contrast the waterfall methodology, where every business requirement is translated into feature/functional descriptions which are then all implemented typically over a period of months or longer.

== History ==
According to Elliott (2004), SDLC &quot;originated in the 1960s, to develop large scale functional business systems in an age of large scale business conglomerates. Information systems activities revolved around heavy data processing and number crunching routines&quot;.

The structured systems analysis and design method (SSADM) was produced for the UK government Office of Government Commerce in the 1980s. Ever since, according to Elliott (2004), &quot;the traditional life cycle approaches to systems development have been increasingly replaced with alternative approaches and frameworks, which attempted to overcome some of the inherent deficiencies of the traditional SDLC&quot;.

== Models ==

SDLC provides a set of phases/steps/activities for system designers and developers to follow. Each phase builds on the results of the previous one. Not every project requires that the phases be sequential. For smaller, simpler projects, phases may be combined/overlap.

=== Waterfall ===
The oldest and best known is the waterfall model, which uses a linear sequence of steps. Waterfall has different varieties. One variety is as follows:

==== Preliminary analysis ====
Conduct with a preliminary analysis, consider alternative solutions, estimate costs and benefits, and submit a preliminary plan with recommendations.
:* Conduct preliminary analysis: Identify the organization&#x27;s objectives and define the nature and scope of the project. Ensure that the project fits with the objectives.
:* Consider alternative solutions: Alternatives may come from interviewing employees, clients, suppliers, and consultants, as well as competitive analysis.
:* Cost-benefit analysis: Analyze the costs and benefits of the project.

==== Systems analysis, requirements definition ====
Decompose project goals into defined functions and operations. This involves gathering and interpreting facts, diagnosing problems, and recommending changes. Analyze end-user information needs and resolve inconsistencies and incompleteness:
:* Collect facts: Obtain end-user requirements by document review, client interviews, observation, and questionnaires.
:* Scrutinize existing system(s): Identify pros and cons.
:* Analyze the proposed system: Find solutions to issues and prepare specifications, incorporating appropriate user proposals.

==== Systems design ====
At this step, desired features and operations are detailed, including screen layouts, business rules, process diagrams, pseudocode, and other deliverables.

==== Development ====
Write the code.

==== Integration and testing ====
Assemble the modules in a testing environment. Check for errors, bugs, and interoperability.

==== Acceptance, installation, deployment ====
Put the system into production. This may involve training users, deploying hardware, and loading information from the prior system.

==== Maintenance ====
Monitor the system to assess its ongoing fitness. Make modest changes and fixes as needed. To maintain the quality of the system. Continual monitoring and updates ensure the system remains effective and high-quality.

==== Evaluation ====
The system and the process are reviewed. Relevant questions include whether the newly implemented system meets requirements and achieves project goals, whether the system is usable, reliable/available, properly scaled and fault-tolerant. Process checks include review of timelines and expenses, as well as user acceptance.

==== Disposal ====
At end of life, plans are developed for discontinuing the system and transitioning to its replacement. Related information and infrastructure must be repurposed, archived, discarded, or destroyed, while appropriately protecting security.

In the following diagram, these stages are divided into ten steps, from definition to creation and modification of IT work products:

=== Systems analysis and design ===
Systems analysis and design (SAD) can be considered a meta-development activity, which serves to set the stage and bound the problem. SAD can help balance competing high-level requirements. SAD interacts with distributed enterprise architecture, enterprise I.T. Architecture, and business architecture, and relies heavily on concepts such as partitioning, interfaces, personae and roles, and deployment/operational modeling to arrive at a high-level system description. This high-level description is then broken down into the components and modules which can be analyzed, designed, and constructed separately and integrated to accomplish the business goal. SDLC and SAD are cornerstones of full life cycle product and system planning.

=== Object-oriented analysis and design ===
Object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) is the process of analyzing a problem domain to develop a conceptual model that can then be used to guide development. During the analysis phase, a programmer develops written requirements and a formal vision document via interviews with stakeholders.

The conceptual model that results from OOAD typically consists of use cases, and class and interaction diagrams. It may also include a user interface mock-up.

An output artifact does not need to be completely defined to serve as input of object-oriented design; analysis and design may occur in parallel. In practice the results of one activity can feed the other in an iterative process.

Some typical input artifacts for OOAD:

* Conceptual model: A conceptual model is the result of object-oriented analysis. It captures concepts in the problem domain. The conceptual model is explicitly independent of implementation details.
* Use cases: A use case is a description of sequences of events that, taken together, complete a required task. Each use case provides scenarios that convey how the system should interact with actors (users). Actors may be end users or other systems. Use cases may further elaborated using diagrams. Such diagrams identify the actor and the processes they perform.
* System Sequence Diagram: A System Sequence diagrams (SSD) is a picture that shows, for a particular use case, the events that actors generate, their order, including inter-system events.
* User interface document: Document that shows and describes the user interface.
* Data model: A data model describes how data elements relate to each other. The data model is created before the design phase. Object-oriented designs map directly from the data model. Relational designs are more involved.

=== System lifecycle ===
The system lifecycle is a view of a system or proposed system that addresses all phases of its existence to include system conception, design and development, production and/or construction, distribution, operation, maintenance and support, retirement, phase-out, and disposal.

==== Conceptual design ====
The conceptual design stage is the stage where an identified need is examined, requirements for potential solutions are defined, potential solutions are evaluated, and a system specification is developed. The system specification represents the technical requirements that will provide overall guidance for system design. Because this document determines all future development, the stage cannot be completed until a conceptual design review has determined that the system specification properly addresses the motivating need.

Key steps within the conceptual design stage include:
*Need identification
*Feasibility analysis
*System requirements analysis
*System specification
*Conceptual design review

==== Preliminary system design ====
During this stage of the system lifecycle, subsystems that perform the desired system functions are designed and specified in compliance with the system specification. Interfaces between subsystems are defined, as well as overall test and evaluation requirements. At the completion of this stage, a development specification is produced that is sufficient to perform detailed design and development.

Key steps within the preliminary design stage include:
*Functional analysis
*Requirements allocation
*Detailed trade-off studies
*Synthesis of system options
*Preliminary design of engineering models
*Development specification
*Preliminary design review

For example, as the system analyst of Viti Bank, you have been tasked to examine the current information system. Viti Bank is a fast-growing bank in Fiji. Customers in remote rural areas are finding difficulty to access the bank services. It takes them days or even weeks to travel to a location to access the bank services. With the vision of meeting the customers&#x27; needs, the bank has requested your services to examine the current system and to come up with solutions or recommendations of how the current system can be provided to meet its needs.

==== Detail design and development ====
This stage includes the development of detailed designs that brings initial design work into a completed form of specifications. This work includes the specification of interfaces between the system and its intended environment, and a comprehensive evaluation of the systems logistical, maintenance and support requirements. The detail design and development is responsible for producing the product, process and material specifications and may result in substantial changes to the development specification.

Key steps within the detail design and development stage include:
*Detailed design
*Detailed synthesis
*Development of engineering and prototype models
*Revision of development specification
*Product, process, and material specification
*Critical design review

==== Production and construction ====
During the production and/or construction stage the product is built or assembled in accordance with the requirements specified in the product, process and material specifications, and is deployed and tested within the operational target environment. System assessments are conducted in order to correct deficiencies and adapt the system for continued improvement.

Key steps within the product construction stage include:
*Production and/or construction of system components
*Acceptance testing
*System distribution and operation
*Operational testing and evaluation
*System assessment

==== Utilization and support ====
Once fully deployed, the system is used for its intended operational role and maintained within its operational environment.

Key steps within the utilization and support stage include:
*System operation in the user environment
*Change management
*System modifications for improvement
*System assessment

==== Phase-out and disposal ====
Effectiveness and efficiency of the system must be continuously evaluated to determine when the product has met its maximum effective lifecycle. Considerations include: Continued existence of operational need, matching between operational requirements and system performance, feasibility of system phase-out versus maintenance, and availability of alternative systems.

== Phases ==
=== System investigation ===
During this step, current priorities that would be affected and how they should be handled are considered. A feasibility study determines whether creating a new or improved system is appropriate. This helps to estimate costs, benefits, resource requirements, and specific user needs.

The feasibility study should address operational, financial, technical, human factors, and legal/political concerns.

=== Analysis ===
The goal of analysis is to determine where the problem is. This step involves decomposing the system into pieces, analyzing project goals, breaking down what needs to be created, and engaging users to define requirements.

=== Design ===
In systems design, functions and operations are described in detail, including screen layouts, business rules, process diagrams, and other documentation. Modular design reduces complexity and allows the outputs to describe the system as a collection of subsystems.

The design stage takes as its input the requirements already defined. For each requirement, a set of design elements is produced.

Design documents typically include functional hierarchy diagrams, screen layouts, business rules, process diagrams, pseudo-code, and a complete data model with a data dictionary. These elements describe the system in sufficient detail that developers and engineers can develop and deliver the system with minimal additional input.

=== Testing ===
The code is tested at various levels in software testing. Unit, system, and user acceptance tests are typically performed. Many approaches to testing have been adopted.

The following types of testing may be relevant:

* Path testing
* Data set testing
* Unit testing
* System testing
* Integration testing
* Black-box testing
* White-box testing
* Regression testing
* Automation testing
* User acceptance testing
* Software performance testing

=== Training and transition ===
Once a system has been stabilized through testing, SDLC ensures that proper training is prepared and performed before transitioning the system to support staff and end users. Training usually covers operational training for support staff as well as end-user training.

After training, systems engineers and developers transition the system to its production environment.

=== Operations and maintenance ===
Maintenance includes changes, fixes, and enhancements.

=== Evaluation ===
The final phase of the SDLC is to measure the effectiveness of the system and evaluate potential enhancements.

== Life cycle ==
=== Management and control ===
SDLC phase objectives are described in this section with key deliverables, a description of recommended tasks, and a summary of related control objectives for effective management. It is critical for the project manager to establish and monitor control objectives while executing projects. Control objectives are clear statements of the desired result or purpose and should be defined and monitored throughout a project. Control objectives can be grouped into major categories (domains), and relate to the SDLC phases as shown in the figure.

To manage and control a substantial SDLC initiative, a work breakdown structure (WBS) captures and schedules the work. The WBS and all programmatic material should be kept in the &quot;project description&quot; section of the project notebook. The project manager chooses a WBS format that best describes the project.

The diagram shows that coverage spans numerous phases of the SDLC but the associated MCD (Management Control Domains) shows mappings to SDLC phases. For example, Analysis and Design is primarily performed as part of the Acquisition and Implementation Domain, and System Build and Prototype is primarily performed as part of delivery and support.

=== Work breakdown structured organization ===
The upper section of the WBS provides an overview of the project scope and timeline. It should also summarize the major phases and milestones. The middle section is based on the SDLC phases. WBS elements consist of milestones and tasks to be completed rather than activities to be undertaken and have a deadline. Each task has a measurable output (e.g., analysis document). A WBS task may rely on one or more activities (e.g. coding). Parts of the project needing support from contractors should have a statement of work (SOW). The development of a SOW does not occur during a specific phase of SDLC but is developed to include the work from the SDLC process that may be conducted by contractors.

=== Baselines ===
Baselines are established after four of the five phases of the SDLC, and are critical to the iterative nature of the model. Baselines become milestones.

* functional baseline: established after the conceptual design phase.
* allocated baseline: established after the preliminary design phase.
* product baseline: established after the detail design and development phase.
* updated product baseline: established after the production construction phase.

== Alternative methodologies ==
Alternative software development methods to systems development life cycle are:

* Software prototyping
* Joint applications development (JAD)
* Rapid application development (RAD)
* Extreme programming (XP);
* Open-source development
* End-user development
* Object-oriented programming

== Strengths and weaknesses ==
Fundamentally, SDLC trades flexibility for control by imposing structure. It is more commonly used for large scale projects with many developers.

<doc id="573549" wikidata="Q725609" url="?curid=573549" title="Charles Pasqua">
<text>Charles Victor Pasqua (18 April 192729 June 2015) was a French businessman and Gaullist politician. He was Interior Minister from 1986 to 1988, under Jacques Chirac&#x27;s &quot;cohabitation&quot; government, and also from 1993 to 1995, under the government of Edouard Balladur.

==Early life and family background==
Pasqua was born on 18 April 1927 in Grasse, Alpes-Maritimes. His paternal grandfather was a shepherd from Casevecchie, Corsica and he could speak Corsican fluently. As of 1987, his cousin served as the mayor of Casevecchie.

During World War II, Pasqua joined the French Resistance at the age of sixteen.

He subsequently received his Baccalauréat, followed by a degree in Law.

==Business career==
From 1952 to 1971 Pasqua worked for Ricard, a producer of alcoholic beverages (most notably pastis), starting as a salesman.

In 1971, he founded Euralim, also known as Europe-Alimentation, an importer of Americano, a cocktail made by the Italian company Gancia.

==Politics==
In 1947, Pasqua helped create the section of the Gaullist Party RPF movement for the Alpes-Maritimes. With Jacques Foccart and Achille Peretti, he was the co-founder of the &quot;Service d&#x27;Action Civique&quot; (SAC) in 1959 to counter the terrorist actions of the OAS during the Algerian War of Independence (1954–1962). The SAC would be charged with the underground actions of the Gaullist movement and participated in the organization of the 30 May 1968 Gaullist counter-demonstration.

From 1968 to 1973, Pasqua was deputy to the French National Assembly for the Hauts-de-Seine &quot;département&quot; for the UDR party, of which he was a leading member from 1974 to 1976. He helped Jacques Chirac to take the lead of the party and participated in its transformation into the Rally for the Republic (RPR). Counsellor of Jacques Chirac alongside Marie-France Garaud, he was in charge of the organisation of Chirac&#x27;s campaign for the 1981 presidential election, won by the candidate of the Socialist Party (PS), François Mitterrand (1981–1995). As such, he is considered to be Chirac&#x27;s mentor in politics.

From 1981 to 1986 Pasqua was senator for the Hauts-de-Seine, then president of the RPR group in the Senate. From 1986 to 1988 he was Interior Minister (in charge of law enforcement). In 1992, he called a vote against the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty. He became Interior Minister again from 1993 to 1995, and supported the candidacy of Edouard Balladur at the 1995 presidential election. He is mostly remembered for having pushed a series of anti-immigration laws (lois Pasqua), and for his declaration &quot;we will terrorize the terrorists.&quot;

Pasqua headed the Rally for France (RPF), a sovereigntist (Eurosceptic) party, for a while in association with Philippe de Villiers. At the 1999 European Parliament election, their list got ahead of the RPR list. He served as the President of the General Council of the Hauts-de-Seine from 1988 to 2004. In 2004, he was elected senator by an electoral college.

In 2005, a US Senate report accused him, along with the British Respect politician George Galloway, of profiting illegally from the UN&#x27;s oil-for-food scheme. He and other French defendants were cleared of all charges in 2013 by a Paris court.

In 2008, Pasqua was convicted of illegal lobbying in the Mitterrand–Pasqua affair during his time serving as French Interior Minister. Sentenced in 2009 to serve one year of a three-year jail term, he was acquitted on appeal in 2011.

==Personal life and death==
Pasqua was married to Jeanne Joly, from Quebec, Canada. They had a son, , who died in February 2015.

He died of a heart attack on 29 June 2015 at the Foch Hospital in Suresnes, near Paris.

<doc id="573561" wikidata="Q2825983" url="?curid=573561" title="Corruption scandals in the Paris region">
<text>In the 1980s and 1990s there were, in the Paris region (Île-de-France), multiple instances of alleged and proved political corruption cases, as well as cases of abuse of public money and resources. Almost all involved were members of the conservative Rally for the Republic (RPR) ruling party, which became the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) in 2002.

==Central role of Jacques Chirac==

Jacques Chirac was mayor of Paris from 1977 to 1995 and has been named in several cases of alleged corruption and abuse, some of which have already led to felony convictions.

Chirac, as president of France (until 16 May 2007), enjoyed virtual immunity from prosecution for acts preceding his tenure as president, following from decision 98-408 DC of the Constitutional Council on 22 January 1999. This decision itself was highly controversial: the council was consulted on the treaty establishing the International Criminal Court, not about the status of the president with respect to the national criminal justice system. At the time, the president of the council was Roland Dumas, who later had to retire from his functions because of his implication in the Elf Aquitaine scandal.

Chirac refused to testify before investigating magistrate Éric Halphen, arguing that this would be incompatible with his presidential functions.

On 10 October 2001, the Court of Cassation ruled that, while the president cannot be prosecuted by normal judicial means during his mandate, such an impossibility suspends the delays of prescription (statute of limitation). If Chirac does not run for office again in 2007 or is not re-elected, he may then be prosecuted on the several affairs he is involved in. This might explain why in 2003 some in the presidential entourage floated around the idea of Chirac running for a third term.

Chirac&#x27;s foremost critic was deputy Arnaud Montebourg of the Socialist Party, who filed a motion to bring him in front of the High Court of Justice (a procedure similar to impeachment, which has never been applied).

==Vote rigging in Paris==

In several districts of Paris, people were allegedly illegally registered on the electoral rolls in an attempt to modify the outcome of elections. In some egregious cases, significant numbers of people were registered at the address of a hotel or of a shop.

* In the 3rd arrondissement, 859 (being 5% of the registered voters) were, according to enquiries, fraudulently registered on the electoral rolls between 1988 and 1995.
* In the 5th arrondissement, mayor Jean Tiberi, his wife Xavière Tiberi and alleged accomplices were put under formal investigation. According to the &quot;instruction&quot;, 7,228 people were fraudulently registered in the 5th arrondissement in 1997 and 3,315 of them voted when Jean Tiberi was elected deputy with 2,725 votes more than his opponent. On 21 March 2005, Jean Tiberi was put under criminal investigation for his alleged role in the altered electoral rolls. He denied having had anything to do with the action and pointed that he was re-elected by wide majorities, thus not needing fake voters.

==Manipulated biddings for public procurement==

===Paris public housing projects===

There was a shock when a videocassette of businessman was disclosed after his death in 1999, with &quot;Le Monde&quot; publishing its full contents in September 2000. In the tape, Méry gave details of kickback schemes in the Paris region; in particular, he said that he delivered FRF 5 million in cash to Michel Roussin, chief of staff of then prime minister Jacques Chirac, &quot;in Chirac&#x27;s presence&quot;. &quot;We only work on Mr. Chirac&#x27;s orders,&quot; Méry said in the video. It was on these grounds that investigating magistrate Éric Halphen summoned president Jacques Chirac in March 2001 as witness, declaring that there were sufficient &quot;clues&quot; to warrant a full investigation. In September 2001, the Paris Appeal Court cancelled part of the proceedings on procedural vices, and removing the affair from judge Halphen&#x27;s hands. In February 2005, investigating magistrate Armand Riberolles, who succeeded Halphen, abandoned charges against Jean Tiberi (who succeeded Chirac as mayor of Paris), who as former president of the OPAC (&quot;Office Public d&#x27;Aménagement et de Construction&quot;) of Paris, was prosecuted for &quot;complicity in corruption&quot; (&quot;complicité de traffic d&#x27;influence&quot;).

As of January 2006, several CEOs had been prosecuted in the trial, but not one politician. Forty-nine businessmen were prosecuted, among them , CEO of company and close to Chirac. According to &quot;Le Monde&quot;, this trial was met with &quot;relative indifference&quot;. The previous investigations had led to the resignation of magistrate Éric Halphen after several cases of intimidation and a tight struggle against the executive power. Personalities such as Michel Roussin, or Jean Tiberi, former mayor of Paris, had all been previously acquitted. The investigating magistrate Armand Riberolles, who succeeded Eric Halphen, wrote that the &quot;instruction hadn&#x27;t been able to formally establish the personal involvement of responsible members of the higher echelons of the RPR&quot;, while noting that &quot;a large number of testimonies, cross-checked by various factual elements, show that Jean-Claude Méry had been commissioned to ensure the financing of the RPR&#x27;s political activities by collecting funds, in particular through the firms working with the OPAC.&quot; All proceedings leading to president Chirac had been thrown out in September 2001 by the Paris Court of Appeal, leading to the resignation of judge Halphen.

===High-schools and other public works in the Île-de-France region===

About 40 are under investigation for the alleged corruption at the Île-de-France regional council. Inquiries showed that 2% of the payments from the Île-de-France council to companies involved in building or repairs on the region&#x27;s high schools were to be channeled as kickbacks to political parties, either through legal contributions (permitted under the 15 January 1990 law then in force), or through cash deliveries of fictitious employment (i.e. staff of political parties or politicians being paid by the involved companies). According to the enquiry, 1.2% went to the RPR, 0.8% to the French Socialist Party. Michel Giraud, then president of the Île-de-France region, was one of the prime suspects. The following companies admitted to such practices: , , (GTM), Bouygues, CBC, Nord France, Dumez, Chagnaud, Fougerolle, SAEP, SCGPM, (SPIE). The investigations were conducted by investigating judges Armand Riberolles and Marc Brisset-Foucault

In March 2005, the case went to trial before the Paris correctional court In October 2005, former president of the Île-de-France region Michel Giraud was condemned to four years of prison on probation and to pay an 80 000 euros fine; Michel Roussin, former chief of staff of Jacques Chirac, was also condemned to four years of prison on probation and to a 50 000 euros fine. These sentences were accompanied by a 5 years suspension of civil and familial rights. Louise-Yvonne Cassetta and Guy Drut were also condemned on probation. Among the 47 persons prosecuted, only Gérard Longuet, former president of the republican party, was acquitted. &quot;Libération&quot; could state that: &quot;Only one - big - absence in this trial and judgment: Jacques Chirac, whose shadow has constantly towered [over] this four months debate&quot;.

==Fictional jobs in government offices==

===City of Paris===
During the tenure of Jacques Chirac as mayor of Paris, some people paid by the city government actually worked (full-time) for the RPR party.

Alain Juppé, former secretary-general of the RPR (1988–1995) and former deputy mayor in charge of finances of the City of Paris (1983–1995) and had served as prime minister in 1995-97 was convicted along with accomplices and of abuse of public funds when he employed people on the city&#x27;s payroll to perform tasks wholly for the benefit of his party. On 31 January 2004, Alain Juppé was sentenced by the correctional court of Nanterre to 18-month suspended sentence, as well as the deprivation of the right to vote for five years and the right to run for national office for 10 years (reduced on appeal to one year). On 1 December 2004, the Versailles court of appeals reduced the sentence to a 14-month suspended sentence and a deprivation of the right to hold political office for one year. Juppé did not go to the Court of Cassation over this sentence, and had to resign from his position as mayor of Bordeaux.

Another scandal erupted after the ruling when the judges of the Nanterre court alleged that their offices and computers had been searched. President Chirac ordered an administration inquiry commission, composed of high-level magistrates (the vice-president of the Council of State, and the first presidents of the Court of Cassation and the Court of Auditors), to investigate the matter. This decision was criticized because there was no legal nor constitutional basis for it: normally, questions of judicial honesty are handled by the &quot;Conseil Supérieur de la Magistrature&quot; (CSM), which (politely) protested Chirac&#x27;s action. The Nanterre judges refused to be heard by the commission, arguing they should see the CSM. The commission concluded that there had been security lapses at the Nanterre court, but did not conclude that there was any wrongdoing. A criminal investigation has also been opened.

On 3 December 2004, the Court of Cassation ruled that a court of appeals had incorrectly ruled that some cases of employment by or payments received from the City of Paris (under the Chirac and Tiberi administrations) for fictitious work fell under prescription (statute of limitations). The court announced that the cases were now referred to the Versailles Court of Appeals. The current administration of the City of Paris, led by Socialist mayor Bertrand Delanoë, had appealed the prescription ruling before the Court of Cassation. Among the suspects are the deputy of Paris Jean de Gaulle, former minister Robert Pandraud etc.

===Essonne===
Xavière Tiberi, the spouse of mayor of Paris Jean Tiberi, received FRF 200,000 (approx. €30,000) for a report on francophonie for the general council of the Essonne &quot;département&quot;. This 36-page report, possibly written after the payment as a justification, was extremely poorly written and contained numerous spelling and grammatical mistakes.

==Illegal use of government services==

===Usage of City of Paris gardening services for private purposes===

In 2004, mayor Bertrand Delanoë filed a complaint for the past abuse of City of Paris gardening services for private purposes, estimating the public losses to at least €700,000. Individuals close to the RPR allegedly enjoyed free gardening services from City of Paris employees in their houses of the upscale areas of Paris and suburbs. City supplies were allegedly also taken for private usage.

François Fillon who held the position of Prime Minister from 2007 to 2012, was convicted in 2020 for falsely claiming a parliamentary salary for his wife. This conviction highlighted Fillon&#x27;s wrongdoing in improperly utilizing public funds by allegedly paying his spouse for work she did not actually perform.

<text>Rachel Carmel Hakim (née Nicolazzo), better known as Rachel Z, is an American jazz and rock pianist and keyboardist. She has recorded 13 albums as a leader and jazz musician. Her musical style, especially her improvisation, has been described as adjacent to Herbie Hancock and McCoy Tyner.

== Career ==
In 1999, Hakim was a part of a jazz fusion project by Stanley Clarke and Lenny White. The project, entitled Vertú, also featured such artists as Karen Briggs on violin and Richie Kotzen on guitar and resulted in an album of the same name that year. She experimented with her own rock group Peacebox as a vocalist. During this time, she was also working with the Neapolitan pop musician Pino Daniele, with whom she first began working in 1996 and toured with until his death in 2015. She toured with Peter Gabriel during his Growing Up tours from 2002 to 2006, which gave Rachel the opportunity to widen her fan base and work with bassist Tony Levin. Her project, entitled &quot;Dept. of Good and Evil&quot;, on Savoy received positive reviews.

Hakim and her husband Omar Hakim formed the OZExperience, now &quot;Ozmosys&quot; (Omar and Rachel Z), and in 2019, the new group recorded an EP Eyes to the Future Vol.1 at Power Station. The five-track EP was released on November 4, 2019 with Kurt Rosenwinkel on guitar and Linley Marthe on bass, with J. C. Maillard on additional guitar and voice. The band was hailed at the opening night of the 2019 London Jazz Festival in Jazzwise:

<text>Franck Roger Queudrue (born 27 August 1978) is a French former professional footballer who played as a left back. He began his career with Lens, for whom he played in Ligue 1, and went on to play in the Premier League for Middlesbrough, Fulham and Birmingham City, and in the Football League for Colchester United. He returned to Lens in 2010, and joined Red Star on a free transfer in 2012. Queudrue retired at the end of the 2012–13 season.

Queudrue played one match for France at B international level, and considered playing for the Republic of Ireland until being deemed ineligible by FIFA to play for them.

==Early life==
Franck Roger Queudrue was born on 27 August 1978 in Paris.

==Club career==
===Lens===
Queudrue began his football career in the youth system of Lens. He made 41 appearances for the club&#x27;s reserve team in the Championnat de France Amateur (CFA) from the 1997–98 season onwards, scoring seven goals, and stepped up to the first team during the 1999–2000 season. His debut in Ligue 1 came as a second-half substitute against Montpellier on 16 October 1999, and during that first season he played 16 league games, as well as six in the UEFA Cup. His first league goal came in his third appearance, a 90th-minute winner away to Marseille. He appeared frequently the following season, but made only two substitute appearances in 2001–02 before leaving for England on loan.

===Middlesbrough===
Queudrue joined English Premier League club Middlesbrough on loan in October 2001, and the deal was made permanent at the end of the season. He stayed until the summer of 2006. His preferred position was left-back, though he was comfortable at centre-back and, on certain occasions, played for Middlesbrough as a left or central midfielder. He was also renowned for his free kick and penalty converting ability.

He became popular with fans when he scored in his second game for the club – against North East rivals Sunderland. Queudrue impressed enough to earn a permanent move in May 2002 for a fee of £2.5 million. However, he was also recognised for his poor disciplinary record. His five yellow and three red cards in the 2002–03 season contributed hugely to Middlesbrough missing out on a place in the UEFA Cup through the fair play league – although, conversely, he was a major reason they were high enough up the league to be in contention. He was part of the Middlesbrough side who beat Bolton Wanderers to win the 2004 League Cup final. He also started for Middlesbrough in the 2006 UEFA Cup final which they lost 4–0 to Sevilla in Eindhoven.

In 2006, Queudrue announced that he was considering switching his nationality to British, after becoming eligible for UK citizenship. He had previously hoped to claim Irish citizenship, before revealing &quot;unfortunately I am one generation out&quot; to be eligible.

===Fulham===
Queudrue left for Fulham, signing a four-year contract in July 2006. Queudrue was a regular for Fulham under Chris Coleman, but he was made available for transfer by new manager Lawrie Sanchez, as he did not agree with Sanchez&#x27;s long-ball game. He scored once in the league for Fulham, an injury time equaliser against Charlton Athletic.

===Birmingham City===
On 3 August 2007, Queudrue signed a three-year contract with Birmingham City for a fee estimated at £2.5 million. After Birmingham&#x27;s relegation at the end of the 2007–08 season, co-owner David Sullivan claimed he should have intervened to stop manager Steve Bruce &quot;buying a pile of rubbish&quot; and singled out Queudrue as &quot;a major disappointment&quot;. Sullivan&#x27;s apology the next day was accepted, but after Queudrue reported back late for pre-season training, he was told he could leave on a free transfer. However, he returned to the team the following season, produced man-of-the-match performances, and in October Sullivan issued a public apology in the match programme. Voted player of the season both by the fans and by the local newspaper, the &quot;Birmingham Mail&quot;, Queudrue also received personal message of congratulation from Sullivan via the club website.

In March 2010, Queudrue joined Colchester United of League One on loan for the remainder of the 2009–10 season, but injury restricted him to just three appearances. On his return to Birmingham, the club announced that he would be released when his contract expired at the end of June 2010.

===Return to Lens===
Queudrue had a trial at Peterborough United, but was reported to have joined Greece Super League club Panionios instead. However, he chose not to proceed with that move for family reasons, and after several weeks training with his first club, Lens, he rejoined them on 27 September until the end of the season.

===Red Star===
On 1 August 2012, Queudrue signed a two-year contract with Red Star on a free transfer. He scored his first goal for the club in a 3–0 win over Cherbourg, and his second in a 1–1 draw with Quevilly.

==International career==
While a Lens player in 2000, Queudrue earned one cap for the France B national football team. He was hopeful of being able to represent Republic of Ireland as he believed he had an Irish grandfather, but it was later discovered he in fact had an Irish great-grandfather, thus making him ineligible.

<doc id="573642" wikidata="Q72975" url="?curid=573642" title="Philipp Nicodemus Frischlin">
<text>Philipp Nicodemus Frischlin (also spelled &quot;Nikodemus&quot;) (22 September 1547 – 29 November 1590) was a German philologist, poet, playwright, mathematician, and astronomer, born at Erzingen, today part of Balingen in Württemberg, where his father was parish minister.

== Life ==

He was educated as a scholar of &quot;Tübinger Stift&quot; at the university of Tübingen, where in 1568 he was promoted to the chair of poetry and history. In 1575 for his comedy of &quot;Rebecca&quot;, which he read at Regensburg before the emperor Maximilian II, he was rewarded with the laureateship, and in 1577 he was made an imperial
count palatine (&quot;Comes palatinus Caesareus&quot;) or &quot;Pfalzgraf&quot;.

In 1582 his unguarded language and reckless life made it necessary that he should leave Tübingen, and he accepted a mastership at Laibach in Carniola (nowadays Ljubljana in Slovenia), which he held for about two years. Shortly after his return to the university in 1584, he was threatened with a criminal prosecution on a charge of immoral conduct, and the threat led to his withdrawal to Frankfurt am Main in 1587. For eighteen months he taught in the Brunswick gymnasium, and he appears also to have resided occasionally at Strasbourg, Marburg and Mainz. From the last-named city he wrote certain libelous letters, which led to his being arrested in March 1590. He was imprisoned in the fortress of Hohenurach, near Reutlingen, where, on the night of 29 November 1590, he was killed by a fall in attempting to let himself down from the window of his cell.

== Work ==

Frischlin&#x27;s prolific and versatile genius produced a great variety of works, which entitle him to some rank both among poets and among scholars. In his Latin verse he often successfully imitated the classical models; his comedies are not without freshness and vivacity; and some of his versions and commentaries, particularly those on the &quot;Georgics&quot; and &quot;Bucolics&quot; of Virgil, though now well-nigh forgotten, were important contributions to the scholarship of his time. There is no collected edition of his works, but his &quot;Opera poetica&quot; were published twelve times between 1535 and 1636.

Among those most widely known may be mentioned:
*the &quot;Hebraeis&quot; (1590), a Latin epic based on the &quot;Scripture history of the Jews&quot;
*the &quot;Elegiaca&quot; (1601), his collected lyric poetry, in twenty-two books
*the &quot;Opera scenica&quot; (1604) consisting of six comedies and two tragedies (among the former, &quot;Julius Caesar redivivus&quot;, completed 1584)
*the &quot;Grammatica Latina&quot; (1585)
*the versions of Callimachus and Aristophanes
*the commentaries on Persius and Virgil

<doc id="573646" wikidata="Q744589" url="?curid=573646" title="Early Buddhist schools">
<text>The early Buddhist schools refers to the Indian Buddhist &quot;doctrinal schools&quot; or &quot;schools of thought&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;vāda&quot;) which arose out of the early unified Buddhist monastic community (saṅgha) due to various schisms in the history of Indian Buddhism. The various splits and divisions were caused by differences in interpretations of the monastic rule (Vinaya), doctrinal differences and also due to simple geographical separation as Buddhism spread throughout the Indian subcontinent. 

The early Buddhist community initially split into two main Nikāyas (monastic groups, divisions), the Sthavira (&quot;Elders&quot;), and the Mahāsāṃghika (&quot;Great Community&quot;). This initial split occurred either during the reign of Aśoka (c. 268-232 BCE) or shortly after (historians disagree on the matter). 

Later, these groups became further divided on doctrinal grounds into numerous schools of thought and practice (with their own monastic rules and doctrinal Abhidharma texts). Some of the main sects included the Sarvāstivādins (&quot;Temporal Eternalists&quot;), the Dharmaguptakas (&quot;Preservers of Dharma&quot;), Lokottaravadins (&quot;Transcendentalists&quot;), the Prajñaptivādins (&quot;Conceptualists&quot;), the Vibhajyavādins (&quot;the Analysts&quot;), and the Pudgalavādins (&quot;Personalists&quot;). According to traditional accounts these sects eventually proliferated into 18 (or, less-commonly, 20) different schools. 

The textual material shared by the early schools is often termed the early Buddhist texts and these are an important source for understanding their doctrinal similarities and differences. There were are various works of Abhidharma and other treatises written by these various schools which contain more unique doctrines which were specific to each school.

== Formation and development ==
=== The first council ===
According to the scriptures (&quot;Cullavagga&quot; XI.1 ff), three months after the parinirvana of Gautama Buddha, a council was held at Rajagaha Rajgir) by some of his disciples who had attained arahantship, presided over by Mahākāśyapa, one of his most senior disciples, and with the support of king Ajātasattu, reciting the teachings of the Buddha. The accounts of the council in the scriptures of the schools differ as to what was actually recited there. Purāṇa is recorded as having said: &quot;Your reverences, well chanted by the elders are the Dhamma and Vinaya, but in that way that I heard it in the Lord&#x27;s presence, that I received it in his presence, in that same way will I bear it in mind.&quot; [&quot;Vinaya-pitaka&quot;: &quot;Cullavagga&quot; XI:1:11]. According to Theravāda tradition, the teachings were divided into various parts and each was assigned to an elder and his pupils to commit to memory, and there was no conflict about what the Buddha taught.

Some scholars argue that the first council actually did not take place.

=== Divergence between the &quot;Sthaviravāda&quot; and the &quot;Mahāsāṃghika&quot;===
The expansion of orally transmitted texts in early Buddhism, and the growing distances between Buddhist communities, fostered specialization and sectarian identification. One or several disputes did occur during Aśoka&#x27;s reign, involving both doctrinal and disciplinary (&quot;vinaya&quot;) matters, although these may have been too informal to be called a &quot;council&quot;. The Sthavira school had, by the time of Aśoka, divided into three sub-schools, doctrinally speaking, but these did not become separate monastic orders until later.

Only two ancient sources (the Dīpavaṃsa and Bhavya&#x27;s third list) place the first schism before Aśoka, and none attribute the schism to a dispute on Vinaya practice. Lamotte and Hirakawa both maintain that the first schism in the Buddhist sangha occurred during the reign of Ashoka. According to scholar Collett Cox &quot;most scholars would agree that even though the roots of the earliest recognized groups predate Aśoka, their actual separation did not occur until after his death.&quot; According to the Theravada tradition, the split took place at the Second Buddhist council, which took place at Vaishali, approximately one hundred years after Gautama Buddha&#x27;s parinirvāṇa. While the second council probably was a historical event, traditions regarding the Second Council are confusing and ambiguous. According to the Theravada tradition the overall result was the first schism in the sangha, between the Sthavira nikāya and the Mahāsāṃghika, although it is not agreed upon by all what the cause of this split was. 

The various splits within the monastic organization went together with the introduction and emphasis on Abhidhammic literature by some schools. This literature was specific to each school, and arguments and disputes between the schools were often based on these Abhidhammic writings. However, actual splits were originally based on disagreements on vinaya (monastic discipline), though later on, by about 100 CE or earlier, they could be based on doctrinal disagreement. Pre-sectarian Buddhism, however, did not have Abhidhammic scriptures, except perhaps for a basic framework, and not all of the early schools developed an Abhidhamma literature.

=== Third council under Aśoka ===
Theravādin sources state that, in the 3rd century BCE, a third council was convened under the patronage of Aśoka. Some scholars argue that there are certain implausible features of the Theravādin account which imply that the third council was ahistorical. The remainder consider it a purely Theravāda-Vibhajjavāda council. 

According to the Theravādin account, this council was convened primarily for the purpose of establishing an official orthodoxy. At the council, small groups raised questions about the specifics of the &quot;vinaya&quot; and the interpretation of doctrine. The chairman of the council, Moggaliputta Tissa, compiled a book, the &quot;Kathavatthu&quot;, which was meant to refute these arguments. The council sided with Moggaliputta and his version of Buddhism as orthodox; it was then adopted by Emperor Aśoka as his empire&#x27;s official religion. In Pali, this school of thought was termed Vibhajjavāda, literally &quot;thesis of [those who make] a distinction&quot;.

The distinction involved was as to the existence of phenomena (&quot;dhamma&quot;s) in the past, future and present. The version of the scriptures that had been established at the third council, including the &quot;Vinaya&quot;, &quot;Sutta&quot; and the &quot;Abhidhamma Pitaka&quot;s (collectively known as the &quot;Tripiṭaka&quot;), was taken to Sri Lanka by Emperor Aśoka&#x27;s son, the Venerable Mahinda. There it was eventually committed to writing in the Pali language. The Pāli Canon remains the most complete set of surviving &quot;Nikāya&quot; scriptures, although the greater part of the Sarvāstivādin canon also survives in Chinese translation, some parts exist in Tibetan translations, and some fragments exist in Sanskrit manuscripts, while parts of various canons (sometimes unidentified), exist in Chinese and fragments in other Indian dialects as in Gāndhārī.

=== Further divisions ===
Around the time of Aśoka that further divisions began to occur within the Buddhist movement and a number of additional schools emerged. Etienne Lamotte divided the mainstream Buddhist schools into three main doctrinal types:
#The &quot;personalists&quot;, such as the Pudgalavādin Vātsīputrīyas and Saṃmittīyas
#The &quot;realists&quot;, namely the Theravāda and Sarvāstivāda Ābhidharmikas
#The &quot;nominalists&quot;, e.g. the Mahāsāṃghika Prajñaptivādins, and possibly non-Abhidharma Sthaviravadins.

One of them was faction of the Sthavira group which called themselves Vibhajjavādins. One part of this group was transmitted to Sri Lanka and to certain areas of southern India, such as Vanavasi in the south-west and the Kañci region in the south-east. This group later ceased to refer to themselves specifically as &quot;Vibhajjavādins&quot;, but reverted to calling themselves &quot;Theriyas&quot;, after the earlier Theras (Sthaviras). Still later, at some point prior to the Dipavamsa (4th century), the Pali name Theravāda was adopted and has remained in use ever since for this group.

Other groups included the Sarvāstivāda, the Dharmaguptakas, the Saṃmitīya, and the Pudgalavādins. The Pudgalavādins were also known as Vatsiputrīyas after their putative founder. Later this group became known as the Sammitīya school after one of its subdivisions. It died out around the 9th or 10th century CE. Nevertheless, during most of the early medieval period, the Sammitīya school was numerically the largest Buddhist group in India, with more followers than all the other schools combined. The Sarvāstivādin school was most prominent in the north-west of India and provided some of the doctrines that would later be adopted by the Mahāyāna. Another group linked to Sarvāstivāda was the Sautrāntika school, which only recognized the authority of the sutras and rejected the abhidharma transmitted and taught by the Vaibhāṣika wing of Sarvāstivāda. Based on textual considerations, it has been suggested that the Sautrāntikas were actually adherents of Mūlasarvāstivāda. The relation between Sarvāstivāda and the Mūlasarvāstivāda, however, is unclear. All of these early schools of Nikāya Buddhism eventually came to be known collectively as &quot;the eighteen schools&quot; in later sources. With the exception of the Theravāda, none of these early schools survived beyond the late medieval period by which time several were already long extinct, although a considerable amount of the canonical literature of some of these schools has survived, mainly in Chinese translation. Moreover, the origins of specifically Mahāyāna doctrines may be discerned in the teachings of some of these early schools, in particular in the Mahāsānghika and the Sarvāstivāda.

The schools sometimes split over ideological differences concerning the &quot;real&quot; meaning of teachings in the &quot;Sutta Piṭaka&quot;, and sometimes over disagreement concerning the proper observance of vinaya. These ideologies became embedded in large works such as the &quot;Abhidhammas&quot; and commentaries. Comparison of existing versions of the &quot;Suttapiṭaka&quot; of various sects shows evidence that ideologies from the &quot;Abhidhamma&quot;s sometimes found their way back into the &quot;Suttapiṭaka&quot;s to support the statements made in those &quot;Abhidhammas&quot;. 

Some of these developments may be seen as later elaborations on the teachings. According to Gombrich, unintentional literalism was a major force for change in the early doctrinal history of Buddhism. This means that texts were interpreted paying too much attention to the precise words used and not enough to the speaker&#x27;s intention, the spirit of the text. Some later doctrinal developments in the early Buddhist schools show scholastic literalism, which is a tendency to take the words and phrases of earlier texts (maybe the Buddha&#x27;s own words) in such a way as to read-in distinctions which it was never intended to make.

== The eighteen schools ==


During the first millennium, monks from China such as Faxian, Xuanzang, and Yijing made pilgrimages to India and wrote accounts of their travels when they returned home. These Chinese travel records constitute extremely valuable sources of information concerning the state of Buddhism in India during the early medieval period.

By the time the Chinese pilgrims Xuanzang and Yijing visited India, there were five early Buddhist schools that they mentioned far more frequently than others. They commented that the Sarvāstivāda/Mūlasarvāstivāda, Mahāsāṃghika, and Saṃmitīya were the principal early Buddhist schools still extant in India, along with the Sthavira sect. The Dharmaguptakas continued to be found in Gandhāra and Central Asia, along the Silk Road.

It is commonly said that there were eighteen schools of Buddhism in this period. What this actually means is more subtle. First, although the word &quot;school&quot; is used, there was not yet an institutional split in the &quot;saṅgha&quot;. The Chinese traveler Xuanzang observed even when the Mahāyāna were beginning to emerge from this era that monks of different schools would live side by side in dormitories and attend the same lectures. Only the books that they read were different. Secondly, no historical sources can agree what the names of these &quot;eighteen schools&quot; were. The origin of this saying is therefore unclear.

A.K. Warder identified the following eighteen early Buddhist schools (in approximate chronological order): Sthaviravada, Mahasamghika, Vatsiputriya, Ekavyavaharika, Gokulika (a.k.a. Kukkutika, etc.), Sarvastivada, Lokottaravāda, Dharmottariya, Bhadrayaniya, Sammitiya, Sannagarika, Bahusrutiya, Prajnaptivada, Mahisasaka, Haimavata (a.k.a. Kasyapiya), Dharmaguptaka, Caitika, and the Apara and Uttara (Purva) Saila. Warder says that these were the early Buddhist schools as of circa 50 BCE, about the same time that the Pali Canon was first committed to writing and the presumptive origin date of the Theravada sect, though the term &#x27;Theravada&#x27; was not used before the fourth century CE.

A hypothetical combined list would be as follows:
==Innovations of the sects==
The classic sets of ten, six or four paramitas (perfections) were codified and developed by these various schools in later sources. Though the actual ideas of these virtues (like dhyana, sila, prajña, etc) and the idea of the Buddha&#x27;s past lives are drawn from early Buddhist sources (such as early jatakas), they were developed further into specific doctrines about the bodhisattva path and how exactly the Buddha undertook it. 

The new schools also developed new doctrines about important Buddhist topics. The Sarvastivadins for example were known for their doctrine of temporal eternalism. Meanwhile the Mahasamghika school was known for its doctrine of &quot;transcendentalism&quot; (lokottaravada), the view that the Buddha was a fully transcendent being.

=== Abhidhamma ===
As the third major division of the various canons, the Abhidharma collections were a major source of dispute among the various schools. Abhidharma texts were not accepted as canonical by the Mahasanghika school and several other schools. Another school included most of their version of the Khuddaka Nikaya within their Abhidharma Pitaka. Also, the Pali version of the Abhidhamma is a strictly Theravada collection, and has little in common with the Abhidhamma works recognized by other Buddhist schools. The various Abhidhamma philosophies of the various early schools disagree on numerous key points and belong to the period of sectarian debates among the schools. 

The earliest texts of the Pali Canon (the Sutta Nipata and parts of the Jataka), together with the first four (and early) Nikayas of the Suttapitaka, have no mention of (the texts of) the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Abhidhamma is also not mentioned at the report of the First Buddhist Council, directly after the death of the Buddha. This report of the first council does mention the existence of the Vinaya and the five Nikayas (of the Suttapitaka).

Although the literature of the various Abhidharma Pitakas began as a kind of commentarial supplement upon the earlier teachings in the Suttapitaka, it soon led to new doctrinal and textual developments and became the focus of a new form of scholarly monastic life. The various Abhidharma works were starting to be composed from about 200 years after the passing away of the Buddha.

Traditionally, it is believed (in Theravadin culture) that the Abhidhamma was taught by Buddha to his late mother who was living in Tavatimsa heaven. However, this is rejected by scholars, who believe that only small parts of the Abhidhamma literature may have been existent in a very early form. The Sarvastivadins also rejected this idea, and instead held that the Abhidharma was collected, edited, and compiled by the elders (sthaviras) after the Buddha&#x27;s death (though they relied on the Buddha&#x27;s words for this compilation).

Some schools of Buddhism had important disagreements on subjects of Abhidhamma, while having a largely similar Sutta-pitaka and Vinaya-pitaka. The arguments and conflicts between them were thus often on matters of philosophical Abhidhammic origin, not on matters concerning the actual words and teachings of Buddha.

One impetus for composing new scriptures like the Adhidhammas of the various schools, according to some scholars, was that Buddha left no clear statement about the ontological status of the world – about what &quot;really&quot; exists. Subsequently, later Buddhists have themselves defined what exists and what not (in the Abhidhammic scriptures), leading to disagreements.

=== Late Theravada texts ===
Oliver Abeynayake has the following to say on the dating of the various books in the &quot;Khuddaka Nikāya&quot;:

The Khuddaka Nikaya can easily be divided into two strata, one being early and the other late. The texts Sutta Nipata, Itivuttaka, Dhammapada, Therigatha (Theragatha), Udana, and Jataka tales belong to the early stratum. The texts Khuddakapatha, Vimanavatthu, Petavatthu, Niddesa, Patisambhidamagga, Apadana, Buddhavamsa and Cariyapitaka can be categorized in the later stratum.

The texts in the early stratum date from before the second council (earlier than 100 years after Buddha’s parinibbana), while the later stratum is from after the second council, which means they are definitely later additions to the Sutta Pitaka, and that they might not have been the original teachings by the Buddha, but later compositions by disciples.

The original verses of the Jatakas are recognized as being amongst the earliest part of the Canon, but the accompanying (and more famous) Jataka Stories are commentaries likely composed at later dates.

===Parivara===
The Parivara, the last book of the Vinaya Pitaka, is a later addition to the &quot;Vinaya Pitaka&quot;.

===Other later writings===
*all literature of the Mahayana (the Mahayana Sutras).
*all commentarial works (atthakatha) of Theravada and other early Buddhist schools.

== Hinayana and Mahāyāna ==
Early Mahayana came directly from &quot;early Buddhist schools&quot; and was a successor to them.

Between the 1st century BCE and the 1st century CE, the terms &quot;Mahāyāna&quot; and &quot;Hīnayāna&quot; were first used in writing, in, for example, the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;. The later Mahayana schools may have preserved ideas which were abandoned by the &quot;orthodox&quot; Theravada, such as the Three Bodies doctrine, the idea of consciousness (&quot;vijnana&quot;) as a continuum, and devotional elements such as the worship of saints. 

Although the various early schools of Buddhism are sometimes loosely classified as &quot;Hīnayāna&quot; in modern times, this is not necessarily accurate. According to Jan Nattier, Mahāyāna never referred to a separate sect of Buddhism (Skt. &quot;nikāya&quot;), but rather to the set of ideals and doctrines for bodhisattvas. Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate vinaya or ordination lineage from the early Buddhist schools, and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school.

Membership in these &quot;nikāyas&quot;, or monastic sects, continues today with the Dharmaguptaka nikāya in East Asia, and the Mūlasarvāstivāda nikāya in Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore, Mahāyāna was never a separate rival sect of the early schools. Paul Harrison clarifies that while Mahāyāna monastics belonged to a nikāya, not all members of a nikāya were Mahāyānists. From Chinese monks visiting India, we now know that both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side. Additionally, Isabella Onians notes that Mahāyāna works rarely used the term &quot;Hīnayāna&quot;, typically using the term &quot;Śrāvakayāna&quot; instead.

The Chinese Buddhist monk and pilgrim Yijing wrote about relationship between the various &quot;vehicles&quot; and the early Buddhist schools in India. He wrote, &quot;There exist in the West numerous subdivisions of the schools which have different origins, but there are only four principal schools of continuous tradition.&quot; These schools are namely the Mahāsāṃghika nikāya, Sthavira, Mūlasarvāstivāda and Saṃmitīya nikāyas. Explaining their doctrinal affiliations, he then writes, &quot;Which of the four schools should be grouped with the Mahāyāna or with the Hīnayāna is not determined.&quot; That is to say, there was no simple correspondence between a Buddhist monastic sect, and whether its members learn &quot;Hīnayāna&quot; or &quot;Mahāyāna&quot; teachings.

<text>Albert Eberhard Friedrich Schäffle (24 February 183125 December 1903) was a German sociologist, political economist, and newspaper editor.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Albert Schäffle was born at Nürtingen in Württemberg on 24 February 1831. In 1848 he became a student at the University of Tübingen.

===Career===

He had studied for the ministry, but started out in journalism as his career. From 1850 to 1860 he was attached to the editorial staff of the &quot;Schwäbische Merkur&quot; in Stuttgart, and in the latter year accepted a call to the chair of political economy at the University of Tübingen.

From 1862 to 1864 Schäffle was a member of the Württemberg diet, and in 1868 he received a mandate to the German &quot;Zollparlament.&quot; During this year he was appointed professor of political science at the University of Vienna.

In 1871 Schäffle resigned his professorship to join the cabinet of Count Karl Sigmund von Hohenwart as minister of commerce for Austria. The government fell in that same year, however, and Schäffle took up residence in Stuttgart, where he devoted himself entirely to literary work.

Schäffle&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus,&quot; a treatise called &quot;Bau und Leben des sozialen Körpers&quot; (Construction and Life of the Social Body) was published in four volumes from 1875 to 1878. The work was a grandiose attempt to create a unified system combining the natural and social sciences. Schäffle attempted to show a unity between human social behavior and the biological processes observed by natural science, while retaining a spiritual aspect in the tradition of German idealist philosophy.

In a second edition of this work, published in two volumes in 1896, Schäffle emphasized the state-interventionist implications of his work, describing the economy of the &quot;rational social state&quot; in fine detail.

In his &quot;Quintessence of Socialism&quot; (1875) and &quot;The Impossibility of Social Democracy&quot; (1885), Schäffle developed a critique of socialism which focused on the problem of incentives in large-scale collectives. His conclusion was that classical socialism and democracy were incompatible. Schäffle thus foreshadowed some of the criticisms of socialism by Ludwig von Mises and Freidrich Hayek.

From 1892 to 1901 Schäffle was the sole editor of the &quot;Zeitschrift für die gesamte Staatswissenschaft.&quot;

===Death and legacy===

Albert Schäffle died at Stuttgart on 25 December 1903.

<doc id="573652" wikidata="Q155344" url="?curid=573652" title="John Bellingham">
<text>John Bellingham (c. 176918 May 1812) was an English merchant and perpetrator of the 1812 murder of Spencer Perceval, the only British prime minister to be assassinated.

==Early life==
Bellingham&#x27;s early life is largely unknown, and most post-assassination biographies included speculation as fact. Recollections of family and friends show that Bellingham was born in St Neots, Huntingdonshire, and brought up in London, where he was apprenticed to a jeweller, James Love, aged fourteen. Two years later, he went as a midshipman on the maiden voyage of the &quot;Hartwell&quot; from Gravesend to China. A mutiny took place on 22 May 1787, which led to the ship running aground and sinking off the coast of Africa.

In early 1794, a man named John Bellingham opened a tin factory on London&#x27;s Oxford Street, but it failed and the owner was declared bankrupt in March. It is not certain this is the same person, but Bellingham definitely worked as a clerk in a counting house in the late 1790s, and about 1800 he went to Arkhangelsk, Russia, as an agent for importers and exporters. He returned to England in 1802 and was a merchant broker in Liverpool. He married Mary Neville in 1803. In the summer of 1804, Bellingham again went to Arkhangelsk to work as an export representative.

==Russian imprisonment==
In autumn 1803, the Russian ship &quot;Soleure&quot; (or sometimes &quot;Sojus&quot;), insured at Lloyd&#x27;s of London, was lost in the White Sea. Her owners (the house of R. Van Brienen) filed a claim on their insurance, but an anonymous letter told Lloyd&#x27;s the ship had been sabotaged. Soloman Van Brienen believed Bellingham was the author, and retaliated by accusing him of a debt of 4,890 roubles to a bankruptcy of which he was an assignee. Bellingham, about to return from Russia to Britain on 16 November 1804, had his travelling pass withdrawn because of the alleged debt.

Van Brienen persuaded the local Governor-General to imprison Bellingham, and he was placed in a Russian jail. One year later, Bellingham secured his release and went to Saint Petersburg, where he attempted to impeach the Governor-General. This angered the Russian authorities, who charged him with leaving Arkhangelsk in a clandestine manner. He was again imprisoned until October 1808, when he was put out onto the streets, but still without permission to leave. In desperation, he petitioned the Tsar. He was allowed to leave Russia in 1809, arriving in England in December.

==Assassination of the Prime Minister==
Once home, Bellingham began petitioning the United Kingdom&#x27;s government for compensation over his imprisonment. This was refused, as the United Kingdom had broken off diplomatic relations with Russia in November 1808. Bellingham&#x27;s wife urged him to drop the matter and he did so reluctantly.

In 1812, Bellingham renewed his attempts to win compensation. On 18 April, he visited the Foreign Office where a civil servant told him he was at liberty to take whatever measures he thought proper. On 20 April, Bellingham purchased two .50 calibre (12.7 mm) pistols from a gunsmith of 58 Skinner Street. He also had a tailor sew an inside pocket to his coat. At this time, he was often seen in the lobby of the House of Commons.

After taking a friend&#x27;s family to a painting exhibition on Monday 11 May 1812, Bellingham remarked that he had some business to attend to. He made his way to Parliament, where he waited in the lobby. When Prime Minister Spencer Perceval appeared, Bellingham stepped forward and shot him in the heart. He then calmly sat on a bench. Bellingham was immediately restrained and was identified by Isaac Gascoyne, MP for Liverpool.

==Trial, execution and legacy==

John Bellingham was tried on Friday 15 May 1812 at the Old Bailey, where he argued that he would have preferred to shoot the British ambassador to Russia, but insisted as a wronged man he was justified in killing the representative of his oppressors.

He made a formal statement to the court, saying:
Recollect, Gentlemen, what was my situation. Recollect that my family was ruined and myself destroyed, merely because it was Mr Perceval&#x27;s pleasure that justice should not be granted; sheltering himself behind the imagined security of his station, and trampling upon law and right in the belief that no retribution could reach him. I demand only my right, and not a favour; I demand what is the birthright and privilege of every Englishman.

Gentlemen, when a minister sets himself above the laws, as Mr Perceval did, he does it as his own personal risk. If this were not so, the mere will of the minister would become the law, and what would then become of your liberties?

I trust that this serious lesson will operate as a warning to all future ministers, and that they will henceforth do the thing that is right, for if the upper ranks of society are permitted to act wrong with impunity, the inferior ramifications will soon become wholly corrupted.

Gentlemen, my life is in your hands, I rely confidently in your justice.

Evidence was presented that Bellingham was insane, but it was discounted by the trial judge, Sir James Mansfield. Bellingham was found guilty, and was sentenced to death.

Bellingham was hanged in public three days later. , a Frenchman who wrote an account of his ten years in England, described the sentiment of the crowd at the execution:
Farewell poor man, you owe satisfaction to the offended laws of your country, but God bless you! You have rendered an important service to your country, you have taught ministers that they should do justice, and grant audience when it is asked of them.

A subscription was raised for the widow and children of Bellingham, and &quot;their fortune was ten times greater than they could ever have expected in any other circumstances&quot;. His widow remarried the following year.

Bellingham&#x27;s skull was preserved at Barts Pathology Museum.

In September 2009, the St Neots Local History Society erected a plaque on Bellingham House in St Neots. The house, on the corner of Huntingdon Street and Cambridge Street, is said to be the birthplace of Bellingham.

<doc id="573658" wikidata="Q765709" url="?curid=573658" title="Strange Fruit">
<text>&quot;Strange Fruit&quot; is a song written and composed by Abel Meeropol (under his pseudonym Lewis Allan) and recorded by Billie Holiday in 1939. The lyrics were drawn from a poem by Meeropol published in 1937. The song 
protests the lynching of Black Americans with lyrics that compare the victims to the fruit of trees. Such lynchings had reached a peak in the Southern United States at the turn of the 20th century and the great majority of victims were black. The song was described as &quot;a declaration of war&quot; and &quot;the beginning of the civil rights movement&quot; by Atlantic Records co-founder Ahmet Ertegun.

Meeropol set his lyrics to music with his wife Anne Shaffer and the singer Laura Duncan and performed it as a protest song in New York City venues in the late 1930s, including Madison Square Garden. Holiday&#x27;s version was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1978. It was also included in the &quot;Songs of the Century&quot; list of the Recording Industry Association of America and the National Endowment for the Arts. In 2002, &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;.

&quot;Strange Fruit&quot; originated as a protest poem against lynchings. In the poem, Abel Meeropol expressed his horror at lynchings of African Americans, inspired by Lawrence Beitler&#x27;s photograph of the 1930 lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith in Marion, Indiana.

Meeropol published the poem under the title &quot;Bitter Fruit&quot; in January 1937 in &quot;The New York Teacher&quot;, a union magazine of the New York teachers union. Though Meeropol had asked others (notably Earl Robinson) to set his poems to music, he set &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; to music himself. First performed by Meeropol&#x27;s wife Anne Shaffer and their friends in social contexts, his protest song gained a certain success in and around New York. Meeropol, Shaffer, and the Black vocalist Laura Duncan performed it at Madison Square Garden.

==Billie Holiday&#x27;s performances and recordings==
One version of events claims that Barney Josephson, the founder of Café Society in Greenwich Village, New York&#x27;s first integrated nightclub, heard the song and introduced it to Billie Holiday. Other reports say that Robert Gordon, who was directing Holiday&#x27;s show at Café Society, heard the song at Madison Square Garden and introduced it to her. Holiday first performed the song at Café Society in 1939. She said that singing it made her fearful of retaliation but, because its imagery reminded her of her father Clarence Holiday, she continued to sing the piece, making it a regular part of her live performances. Because of the power of the song, Josephson drew up some rules: Holiday would close with it; the waiters would stop all service in advance; the room would be in darkness except for a spotlight on Holiday&#x27;s face; and there would be no encore. During the musical introduction to the song, Holiday stood with her eyes closed, as if she were evoking a prayer.

Holiday approached her recording label, Columbia, about the song, but the company feared reaction by record retailers in the South, as well as negative reaction from affiliates of its co-owned radio network, CBS. When Holiday&#x27;s producer John Hammond also refused to record it, she turned to her friend Milt Gabler, owner of the Commodore label. Holiday sang &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; for him &quot;a cappella&quot;, and moved him to tears. Columbia gave Holiday a one-session release from her contract so she could record it; Frankie Newton&#x27;s eight-piece Café Society Band was used for the session in an arrangement by Newton. Because Gabler worried the song was too short, he asked pianist Sonny White to improvise an introduction. On the recording, Holiday starts singing after 70 seconds. It was recorded on April 20, 1939. Gabler worked out a special arrangement with Vocalion Records to record and distribute the song.

Holiday recorded two major sessions of the song at Commodore, one in 1939 and one in 1944. The song was highly regarded; the 1939 recording eventually sold a million copies, in time becoming the biggest-selling recording of Holiday&#x27;s career.

In her 1956 autobiography, &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot;, Holiday suggested that she, together with Meeropol, her accompanist Sonny White, and arranger Danny Mendelsohn, set the poem to music. The writers David Margolick and Hilton Als dismissed that claim in their work &quot;Strange Fruit: The Biography of a Song&quot;, writing that hers was &quot;an account that may set a record for most misinformation per column inch&quot;. When challenged, Holiday—whose autobiography had been ghostwritten by William Dufty—claimed, &quot;I ain&#x27;t never read that book.&quot;

Holiday was so well known for her rendition of &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; that &quot;she crafted a relationship to the song that would make them inseparable&quot;. Holiday&#x27;s 1939 version of the song was included in the National Recording Registry on January 27, 2003.

In October 1939, Samuel Grafton of the &quot;New York Post&quot; said of &quot;Strange Fruit&quot;, &quot;If the anger of the exploited ever mounts high enough in the South, it now has its Marseillaise.&quot; The anti-lynching movement adopted &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; as its anthem. Since the 1930s several unsuccessful attempts were made in Congress to have lynching made a federal crime which were stymied by filibusters in the Senate by Southerners. In an attempt to achieve a two-thirds majority in the Senate that would break the filibusters by Southern senators, anti-racism activists were encouraged to mail copies of &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; to their senators. 

==Cover versions==
Cover versions of this song include Nina Simone, René Marie, Jeff Buckley, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Josh White, UB40, Bettye LaVette, and Edward W. Hardy.

Simone recorded the song for her album &quot;Pastel Blues&quot; in 1965, a recording described by journalist David Margolick in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as featuring a &quot;plain and unsentimental voice&quot;. René Marie&#x27;s rendition was coupled with the Confederate anthem &quot;Dixie&quot; on her album &quot;Vertigo&quot;, making for an &quot;uncomfortable juxtaposition&quot;. Journalist Lara Pellegrinelli wrote that Jeff Buckley while singing it on the live album &quot;Live at Sin-é: (Legacy Edition)&quot; &quot;seems to meditate on the meaning of humanity the way Walt Whitman did, considering all of its glorious and horrifying possibilities&quot;. &quot;LA Times&quot; noted that Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27;s version from the 1987 album &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; contained &quot;a solemn string section behind the vocals&quot; and &quot;a bridge of New Orleans funeral-march jazz&quot; which enhanced the singer&#x27;s &quot;evocative interpretation&quot;. The group&#x27;s rendition was selected by the &quot;Mojo&quot; staff to be included on the compilation &quot;Music Is Love: 15 Tracks That Changed the World&quot;.

<text>Tamanrasset or Tamanghasset ( &quot;Wilāya Tamanrāssat&quot;, ) is a province (&quot;wilaya&quot;) in southern Algeria. It is named after its province seat, Tamanrasset. The province is the home of two national parks: Ahaggar National Park and Tassili n&#x27;Ajjer National Park. It is the largest province in Algeria, with an area of 336,839 km2.

==Geography==
Tamanrasset is located in the deep southern region of Algeria, approximately 2,000 kilometers south of Algiers. It is bordered by In Salah Province on the north, Illizi Province on the northeast, Djanet Province on the east, In Guezzam Province on the south, Bordj Badji Mokhtar Province on the southwest, and Adrar Province on the west. It also borders Agadez Region in Niger to the southeast.

Tamanrasset is located in the heart of the Algerian Desert of the Sahara. In general, the province has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;), with very hot summers and mild winters, though more mountainous areas, such as the Hoggar Mountains, tend to have cooler temperatures compared to the flatter southern and western parts of the province. The average altitude of the province is about 1,400 meters. The province is home to the highest peak in Algeria, Mount Tahat, located in the Hoggar Mountains with an elevation of 3,003 meters. 

==History==
In 1961, the village of In Eker, located in present-day Tamanrasset Province, was the location of several underground nuclear tests by the French military. According to the Victims of Nuclear Tests in In Eker, over 500 people in the province of Tamanrasset have been impacted by these tests.

The province was created on July 2, 1974 from the Oasis Department following a reorganization of Algeria&#x27;s provinces. In 1983, its borders were modified.

On November 26, 2019, the districts of In Salah and In Guezzam, previously delegated &quot;wilayas&quot; (provinces), were promoted to province status. Prior to 2019, the area of the province was 557,906 km2.

==Government==

=== Administrative divisions ===
The province is divided into 3 districts (&quot;daïras&quot;), which are further divided into 5 &quot;communes&quot; or municipalities.

<text>Wilhelm Hauff (29 November 180218 November 1827) was a German poet and novelist.

==Early life==
Hauff was born in Stuttgart, the son of August Friedrich Hauff, a secretary in the Württemberg ministry of foreign affairs, and Hedwig Wilhelmine Elsaesser Hauff. He was the second of four children.

Hauff lost his father when he was seven years old, and his early education was practically self-gained in the library of his maternal grandfather at Tübingen, where his mother had moved after the death of her husband. In 1818 he was sent to the Klosterschule at Blaubeuren, and in 1820 began to study at the University of Tübingen. In four years he completed his philosophical and theological studies at the Tübinger Stift, graduating with a PhD.

==Writings==
On leaving the university, Hauff became tutor to the children of the Württemberg minister of war, General Baron Ernst Eugen von Hugel (1774–1849), and for them wrote his &quot;Märchen&quot; (fairy tales), which he published in his &quot;Märchen Almanach auf das Jahr 1826&quot; (&quot;Fairytale Almanac of 1826&quot; published as &quot;Tales of the Caravan, Inn, and Palace.&quot; in the US). Some of these stories are very popular in German-speaking countries to this day, such as &quot;Der kleine Muck&quot; (&quot;The Story of Little Muck&quot;), &quot;Kalif Storch&quot; (&quot;Caliph Stork&quot;) and &quot;Die Geschichte von dem Gespensterschiff&quot; (&quot;The Tale of the Ghost Ship&quot;)—all set in the Orient—as well as &quot;Der Zwerg Nase&quot; (&quot;Little Longnose&quot;), &quot;Das kalte Herz&quot; (&quot;The Cold Heart&quot; or &quot;The Marble Heart&quot;) and &quot;Das Wirtshaus im Spessart&quot; (&quot;The Spessart Inn&quot;), set in Germany.

A story from Tales of the Caravan, &quot;Die Geschichte von der abgehauenen Hand&quot; (The Severed Hand) was included in the 10 volume anthology Stories by Foreign Authors (German Volume 2) published in English translation by Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons in 1898.

He also wrote the first part of the &quot;Mitteilungen aus den Memoiren des Satan&quot; (1826; &quot;Memoirs of Beelzebub&quot;) and &quot;Der Mann im Mond&quot; (1825; &quot;The Man in the Moon&quot;). The latter, a parody of the sentimental and sensual novels of Heinrich Clauren (the pseudonym of Carl Gottlieb Samuel Heun, 1771–1854), became in the course of composition a close imitation of that author&#x27;s style and was actually published under his name. As a result, Clauren brought and won an action for damages against Hauff, whereupon Hauff followed up the attack in his witty and sarcastic &quot;Kontroverspredigt über H. Clauren und den Mann im Mond&quot; (1826) and attained his original object: the moral annihilation of the mawkish and unhealthy literature with which Clauren was flooding the country.
Meanwhile, inspired by Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s novels, Hauff wrote the historical romance &quot;Lichtenstein: Romantische Sage aus der wuerttembergischen Geschichte&quot; (1826; &quot;Lichtenstein: Romantic Saga from the History of Württemberg&quot;), which became hugely popular in Germany and especially in Swabia, treating as it did the most interesting period in the history of that country, the reign of Duke Ulrich (1487–1550). This novel was the inspiration for Duke Ulrich&#x27;s heir, Duke Wilhelm of Urach, to rebuild the castle, which had fallen into disrepair, in accordance with Hauff&#x27;s description.

While on a journey to France, the Netherlands, and northern Germany he wrote the second part of the &quot;Memoiren des Satan&quot; and some short novels, among them the charming &quot;Die Bettlerin vom Pont des Arts&quot; (1826; &quot;The True Lover&#x27;s Fortune; or, the Beggar of the Pont des Arts&quot;) and his masterpiece, the novella &quot;Phantasien im Bremer Ratskeller&quot; (1827; &quot;The Wine-Ghosts of Bremen&quot;). He also published some short poems, which have passed into &quot;Volkslieder&quot;, among them &quot;Morgenrot, Morgenrot, leuchtest mir zum frühen Tod?&quot; (&quot;Dawn&#x27;s light, you are lighting my way to early death&quot;) and &quot;Steh ich in finstrer Mitternacht&quot; (&quot;I stand in the darkest midnight&quot;). The novella &quot; Jud Süß&quot; (&quot;Süss the Jew&quot;), &quot;naïvely anti-Semitic&quot;, was published in 1827 by Wilhelm Hauff; a film version (different from Hauff&#x27;s novella) was produced by the Nazi Party as propaganda in 1940.

In January 1827, Hauff undertook the editorship of the &quot;Stuttgart Morgenblatt&quot; and in the following month married his cousin Luise Hauff, but his happiness was prematurely cut short by his death from typhoid fever on 18 November 1827.

==Editions==
His &quot;Sämtliche Werke&quot; (Collected works), with a biography, edited by Gustav Schwab were published in 3 volumes 1830–1834, and 5 volumes (18th ed.) in 1882. They were also published by Felix Bobertag 1891–1897. A selection from his works was published by M. Mendheim (3 vols, 1891). A six-volume edition, with a biographical introduction by Alfred Weile, was published in 1911 by A. Weichert.

Christopher Morley&#x27;s English translations of Hauff&#x27;s short story &quot;The Young Foreigner&quot; and Alfred de Musset&#x27;s tale &quot;The Story of a White Blackbird&quot; were published together in book form by Doubleday in 1925.

<text>Illizi () is a large province (&quot;wilaya&quot;) in the south-eastern corner of Algeria named after its eponymous seat.
It borders Ouargla Province to the north, Tunisia to the extreme northeast, Libya to the east, Djanet Province to the south and, to the west, In Salah Province and Tamanrasset Province. As of the 2008 census, the province had a population of 52,333 and an annual growth rate of 4.5%.

==History==
The province was created from Ouargla Province in 1984. In January 2013, a hostage crisis occurred in a natural gas facility near In Amenas.

==Administrative divisions==
The province is divided into 2 districts, which are further divided into 4 &quot;communes&quot; or municipalities.
===Natural resources===
The area is rich in natural gas. One of the most promising sites for natural gas production is the Ain Tsila gas field in the Isarene permit, some 57% of which is owned by the Irish company Petroceltic International, 18% by the Italian company Enel, and the rest by the Algerian government-owned Sonatrach. Reportedly, Petroceltic&#x27;s 56.7% is worth between US$800 million and US$1 billion.

<text>West Derby ( ) is an area of Liverpool, in the county of Merseyside, England. It is located east of the city and is also a Liverpool City Council ward. At the 2011 Census, the population was 14,382.

==History==
=== West Derby ===
Mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, West Derby achieved significance far earlier than Liverpool itself. The name West Derby comes from an Old Norse word meaning &quot;place of the wild beasts&quot; or &quot;wild deer park&quot; and refers to the deer park (now Croxteth Park) established there by King Edward the Confessor. West Derby became the main administrative area in today&#x27;s Liverpool for the Norman Conquest and was the largest area within the West Derby Hundred which covered most of south west Lancashire.

Contrary to popular belief, the original Earls of Derby were not conferred their title from West Derby, but from Derbyshire, Robert de Ferrers being the first Earl. Subsequent titles were created and bestowed on the Stanley Family. The Derby (horse race) is named after Edward Smith-Stanley, the 12th Earl. 

Note that the term &#x27;local Derby&#x27; actually comes from the town of Derby.

There still remains a courthouse built in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I: the first (Wapentake) court in West Derby was established around 1,000 years ago. The West Derby Courthouse, built in 1586, was restored and conserved in 2005 and is the only freestanding post-medieval courthouse in Britain. The tiny Grade II* listed building is open to the public between 2 pm and 4 pm every Sunday except Easter from April to October inclusive, admission free.

Opposite the courthouse is a set of Victorian cast iron stocks once used as a public restraint for offenders. Villagers used fruit and rotten vegetables to throw at the offenders. The stocks were placed in their current position to commemorate the coronation of Edward VII in 1902. Temporarily removed in 2008 whilst the site was renovated, the stocks have since been put back in place.

The area was home to the Earls of Sefton (family name Molyneux), whose house, Croxteth Hall, and the surrounding countryside estate now forms Croxteth Park, an attractive public space.

In 1835 and 1895, Liverpool boundaries expanded to include West Derby.

From 1894 to 1895 West Derby was an urban district. In 1921 the civil parish had a population of 168,915. On 1 April 1922 the parish was abolished and merged with Liverpool.

=== West Derby Castle ===
West Derby once had a Motte and Bailey castle, now completely disappeared, at Castlesite Road and Meadow Lane In 1327 it was reported to be in ruins. There is also some suggestion of a Roman site on a street called Castlesite (nicknamed &quot;The Rosies&quot; by some locals). The site is now a small public park, the shape and dimensions of which are similar to that of a Roman barracks or castra. The remnants of a wooden castle were unearthed on this plot during excavations in the mid 1930s.

==Governance==
West Derby is mostly within the Liverpool West Derby Parliamentary constituency currently represented by Ian Byrne.
The part of West Derby that is in the Croxteth Country Park ward is within the Liverpool Walton Parliamentary constituency currently represented by Dan Carden.

The district is covered by the Sandfield Park, West Derby Deysbrook, West Derby Leyfield, West Derby Muirhead, and the Croxteth Country Park wards.

As of the 2023 elections West Derby is represented on Liverpool City Council by:

Until 2023 West Derby was represented on the council by the West Derby ward.
==Organisations==
Alder Hey Children&#x27;s Hospital is located on the south side of West Derby, at Eaton Road.

Both Everton and Liverpool football clubs located their training grounds in West Derby, Everton at Bellefield and Liverpool at Melwood. However, Everton moved to their new complex in south Liverpool called Finch Farm in 2007 and Liverpool announced the sale of the Melwood training ground in August 2019.

The West Derby Society was founded in 1977 and holds regular monthly meetings and outings. It lobbies on planning and environmental issues. The West Derby Community Association, a registered charity, owns Grade II-listed &#x27;Lowlands&#x27; in West Derby. This 1846 mansion underwent restoration and renovation with the help of a £1 million Heritage Lottery Fund grant.

==Education==
West Derby is home to a number of schools that have produced famous pupils: 
* St. Edward&#x27;s College produced Sir Terry Leahy, former England rugby union player Mike Slemen and actor Michael Williams. 
* Cardinal Heenan Catholic High School includes Liverpool footballer Steven Gerrard, professional boxer David Price and musician Mike di Scala.

*David Price (boxer), Olympic bronze medal boxer.
*Bill Shankly the Liverpool F.C. football manager, whose house in Bellefield Avenue overlooked Bellefield, Everton&#x27;s then training Ground.

==Transport==

The station building has since become a shop and the access ramps to the former platforms remain, although one of the passages have been closed off to the public. The track has been lifted and the trackbed now forms part of National Cycle Network National Cycle Route 62 and a public footpath between Liverpool and Southport.

Bus routes 12, 13 and 15 run through West Derby and provide links to the City Centre, Huyton, and Stockbridge Village; the 15 bus also links to the nearby Alder Hey Children&#x27;s Hospital. Bus route 61 also runs through West Derby, and provides a bus service to Bootle Strand and Aigburth Vale, to the south of the city. Bus route 18 runs from the Croxteth Park estate to Liverpool City Centre.

Known globally as &quot;the world&#x27;s most beautiful marathon&quot;, the race is run against a backdrop of spectacular scenery through the Cape Peninsula.

Both races start in Newlands. The Ultra Marathon follows a more or less circular route through Muizenberg, Fish Hoek, over Chapman&#x27;s Peak, through Hout Bay and Constantia Nek, and eventually finishes at the University of Cape Town campus. On occasions when Chapman&#x27;s Peak Drive has been closed due to construction or rock falls, the Ultra Marathon has followed an alternative route over Ou Kaapse Weg.

The Half Marathon takes runners along Edinburgh Drive (the M3 highway), before turning into forest roads past Kirstenbosch (where runners meet up with Ultra Marathon participants) and finishing at the University of Cape Town campus.

Since its inaugural edition in 1970, the event has grown. Selling out every year, the Half Marathon sees some 16,000 participants (making it the biggest half marathon in South Africa), while 11,000 athletes tackle the 56 km Ultra Marathon.

In addition to the main events, other events take place the day before (Good Friday):
*Approximately 6 000 runners - including toddlers and young children with their families - take part in various fun runs
*Approximately 1 000 trail runners traverse the trails of the Table Mountain National Park
*International participants get to run a scenic 5 km route along the Sea Point promenade as part of the International Friendship Run

The 2020 and 2021 editions of the race were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="573677" wikidata="Q128941731" url="?curid=573677" title="Kei apple">
<text>Dovyalis afra, commonly known as the Kei apple, is a small to medium-sized tree, native to southern Africa. Its distribution extends from the Kei River in the south, from which the common name derives, northwards along the eastern side of the continent to Tanzania. The ripe fruits (which are present from December to January) are edible and similar in appearance to apricots, though they are quite acidic due to having a high concentration of malic acid.

It is a usually found in dry types of woodland when it grows to 6 m tall. In moister types of open woodland it reaches its greatest size of about 8–9 metres. A tree, with sharp, 3–6 cm long stem spines in the leaf axils, and large sturdy thorns. Buds at the base of the spine produce clusters of alternately arranged simple ovate leaves 3–6 cm long.

The flowers are inconspicuous, solitary or clustered, with no petals. It is dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate plants, though some female plants are parthenogenetic.

The fruit is an edible bright yellow or orange globose berry 2.5–4 cm diameter, with the skin and flesh of a uniform colour and containing several small seeds. Production is often copious, weighing down the branches during the summer. They are juicy, tasty and very acidic.

==Cultivation and uses==
A traditional food plant in the areas it occurs, this little-known fruit has potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable landcare.

Kei-apples are often eaten fresh or sprinkled with sugar to complement their natural acidity. Aside from being eaten fresh, the fruit can be made into jam, used in desserts, or pickled (their natural acidity means vinegar is not needed). In Kenya, it is mostly used for live fences and hedges.(Chiel) locally known in luo

Although it is native to southern Africa, it has also been introduced to the Mediterranean, California, Florida, and other regions with subtropical and warm temperate climates. In these places it is most often grown as an ornamental plant, being popular as an impenetrable hedge. It is salt and drought-tolerant, so useful for coastal landscaping in dry regions.

Although a subtropical species, the Kei apple is able to survive temperatures as low as . Gardeners who want fruit require a female plant; a fertile female plant and a fertile male plant is ideal. Kei apples are propagated by seed. Plants will bear about four years later.

== Taxonomy ==
The original species name &quot;caffra&quot; is related to kaffir, an ethnic slur used towards black people in Africa. At the July 2024 International Botanical Congress, a vote was held with the result that &quot;caffra&quot; related names will be emended to &quot;afra&quot; related ones, with the implementation of this happening by the end of July 2024.

== Ecology ==
The species is invasive in New Caledonia.

<text>Dennis Waterman (24 February 1948 – 8 May 2022) was an English actor and singer. He was best known for his tough-guy leading roles in television series including &quot;The Sweeney&quot;, &quot;Minder&quot; and &quot;New Tricks&quot;, singing the theme tunes of the latter two.

Waterman&#x27;s acting career spanned 60 years, starting with his childhood roles in film and theatre, and adult roles in film, television and West End theatre. He was known for the range of roles he played, including drama (&quot;Up the Junction&quot;), horror (&quot;Scars of Dracula&quot;), adventure (&quot;Colditz&quot;), comedy (&quot;Fair Exchange&quot;), comedy-drama (&quot;Minder&quot;), musical (&quot;Windy City&quot;) and sport (&quot;The World Cup: A Captain&#x27;s Tale&quot;). He appeared in 29 films, the last being released in 2020.

==Early life and education==
Waterman was born on 24 February 1948, as the youngest of nine children to Rose Juliana (née Saunders) and Harry Frank Waterman in Clapham, south west London. The family, which included siblings Ken, Peter, a welterweight boxing champion, Stella, Norma, and Myrna, lived at 2 Elms Road, Clapham Common South Side. Harry Waterman was a ticket collector for British Railways. Two older sisters, Joy and Vera, had already left home by the time Dennis was born, and another brother, Allen, had died as a young child.

Boxing was a big part of Waterman&#x27;s childhood. His father had been an amateur boxer and made all of his sons box. His older brother Ken first took Dennis boxing when he was three years old, and when he was ten Dennis joined Caius Boxing Club.

Waterman was educated at the Granard Primary School, a state primary school on the Ashburton Estate in Putney, southwest London, followed by Corona Stage School, an independent school at Ravenscourt Park in Hammersmith, West London.

An audio tribute episode was released after seven weeks. In May 2023 the show broadcast a second tribute, Revisiting Reminder.

==Personal life==

Waterman was married four times:
*Penny Dixon (1967–1976)
*Patricia Maynard (1977–1987), an actress with whom he had two daughters, one of whom, Hannah Waterman, is also an actress. Hannah is best known for playing Laura Beale in the BBC1 soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, and later appeared in &quot;New Tricks&quot; alongside Waterman as his character&#x27;s daughter.
*Rula Lenska (1987–1998)
*Pam Flint (November 2011–2022)

Waterman&#x27;s marriage to Lenska ended because of his violent behaviour towards her. In March 2012, he caused controversy with some comments on this issue: &quot;It&#x27;s not difficult for a woman to make a man hit her. She certainly wasn&#x27;t a beaten wife, she was hit and that&#x27;s different.&quot; Lenska said there was a &quot;violent, abusive pattern&quot;; Waterman himself admitted he might have &quot;drunk too much&quot; to remember details. The interview was broadcast in full on &quot;Piers Morgan&#x27;s Life Stories&quot; on ITV in May 2012.

Waterman emigrated to Spain with his wife Pam in 2015 after &quot;New Tricks&quot; ended, living at a villa in La Manga, and playing golf at the La Manga Club.

Waterman was banned from driving for three years in January 1991, following his second drink-driving conviction in four years. He was a fan of Chelsea F.C. His love of football was reflected in his being chosen to present &quot;Match of the Seventies&quot; from 1995 to 1996, a nostalgic BBC show celebrating the best football matches from the 1970s.

In 2015, his friend of many years, George Cole, who had played Arthur Daley in &quot;Minder,&quot; died aged 90. Waterman delivered the eulogy at Cole&#x27;s funeral on 12 August.

==Death==
Waterman died from lung cancer at his home in La Manga, Spain on 8 May 2022 at the age of 74.

== In popular culture ==

=== &quot;Little Britain&quot; ===
Waterman was caricatured by David Walliams in the radio and TV comedy series &quot;Little Britain&quot;, in sketches where he visits his agent, Jeremy Rent (played by Matt Lucas) looking for parts. Most of the jokes in these sketches feature Waterman being extremely small, with common objects being made to appear massive in comparison. The Waterman caricature is offered, but always declines, respectable parts because he is not allowed to &quot;write the theme tune, sing the theme tune&quot; of the particular production. This running joke is based on Waterman having sung the theme tunes for at least four of the programmes in which he starred, namely for &quot;Minder&quot;, &quot;Stay Lucky&quot;, &quot;On the Up&quot; and &quot;New Tricks&quot;. In November 2006, Waterman made a guest appearance in &quot;Comic Relief Does Little Britain Live&quot;, alongside the comedy character version of himself.

<doc id="573683" wikidata="Q808628" url="?curid=573683" title="Baron Howard de Walden">
<text>Baron Howard de Walden is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created by writ of summons in 1597 by Queen Elizabeth I for Admiral Lord Thomas Howard, a younger son of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, by his second wife, the Honourable Margaret Audley, daughter of Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden.

==History==
The title was reputedly granted for the admiral&#x27;s role in the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. He subsequently went on to obtain the title of Earl of Suffolk from Elizabeth I&#x27;s successor, King James I, which latter title continues in his male-line descendants. However, the barony of Howard de Walden eventually passed out of the Howard family with the death in 1688 of James Howard, 3rd Earl of Suffolk, and it came briefly to the 4th Earl of Bristol before passing in 1803 to his great-grandson, the four-year-old Charles Ellis.

The title actually fell into abeyance between 1688 and 1784, between the heirs of the 3rd Earl&#x27;s two daughters — Lady Essex Howard (a daughter by his first marriage) and Lady Elizabeth Howard (a daughter by his second marriage). Lady Essex Howard married Edward Griffin, 1st Baron Griffin, and had descendants. Her granddaughter, the Hon. Ann Griffin, was the only surviving daughter of the 2nd Baron Griffin, and her son John Griffin Whitwell, later Field Marshal John Griffin Griffin (he changed his surname in 1749), inherited one-half or a moiety of the barony when his maternal uncle the 3rd Baron Griffin died without legitimate issue. In 1784, the barony was called out of abeyance in his favour. In 1788, the new 4th Baron Howard de Walden was also created 1st Baron Braybrooke with special remainder to a kinsman, Richard Aldsworth Neville, who had married a daughter of the powerful Grenville family (and thus a cousin of William Pitt the Younger).

At the death of Lord Howard de Walden and Braybrooke in 1797 without any issue, the barony of Howard de Walden passed to the only other heir—the representative of the 3rd Earl of Suffolk&#x27;s younger daughter, Lady Elizabeth Felton. Her daughter Elizabeth Felton had married as his 2nd wife John Hervey, 1st Earl of Bristol, and their grandson was Frederick Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol (1730–1803). He had inherited the earldom only upon the death of two older brothers. At his death, his second but eldest surviving son inherited the earldom as 5th Earl and eventually became the 1st Marquess of Bristol. However, the barony of Howard de Walden passed out of the Hervey family too, to a great-grandson, Charles Ellis, 6th Baron Howard de Walden, who inherited in 1803 also became 2nd Baron Seaford. The Ellis family owed their wealth to sugar plantations at Montpelier in the Colony of Jamaica, although Charles lived in England and does not seem to have visited there until in his mid-forties. The family&#x27;s English properties comprised a house in Audley Square, London, and an estate at Seaford in Sussex.

The young Lord Howard de Walden (1799–1868), aged four when he inherited the title from his great-grandfather, eventually married Lady Lucy Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck, youngest daughter of William Bentinck, 4th Duke of Portland, and sister and co-heiress of the reclusive John Bentinck, 5th Duke of Portland. With her childless sister, Viscountess Ossington, she inherited the Duke of Portland&#x27;s London estate in Marylebone in 1879. Building leases granted from the mid-18th century began to make huge financial returns from the 1870s and quickly made the Howard de Walden family one of the wealthiest in the country. Charles died in 1868 and his heir had to wait until the death of his mother in 1899 before receiving his London inheritance. Meanwhile the indebted Jamaican estates were conveyed to his younger brother Evelyn in 1891.

The 7th Baron, Frederick George (1830–1899), was a soldier with the 4th Light Dragoons. Aged 46 he married Blanche Holden, a beauty 25 years younger than he, whom he subsequently divorced, to the scandal of the day. Their only child, a son Thomas Evelyn Ellis (1880–1946) became the 8th Baron Howard de Walden on his father&#x27;s death in 1899. He adopted the name of Scott-Ellis instead of Ellis and was a keen sportsman and playwright with a particular interest in promoting the Welsh performing arts. The London estate which came through his grandmother made him one of the wealthiest men in England and his main residences were Seaford House in Belgrave Square, London, and Chirk Castle in Wales; he was also involved in the Second Boer War as part with the British military. He was succeeded by his son John Scott-Ellis, 9th Baron Howard de Walden and 5th Baron Seaford (1912–1999).

In 1999, while a cousin succeeded as Baron Seaford, the barony of Howard de Walden fell into abeyance among the 9th Baron&#x27;s four daughters and co-heiresses, who also jointly inherited substantial estates in London. By royal warrant dated 25 June 2004, the Queen called the barony of Howard de Walden out of abeyance in favour of the eldest daughter, Hazel Czernin (born 1935). In 1957, she had married Joseph Czernin, son of Count Franz Josef Czernin. He is descended from one of the oldest and most prominent families of the Kingdom of Bohemia (in modern-day Czech Republic). The Czernin family&#x27;s noble titles of &quot;freiherr&quot; and imperial count were granted by the Holy Roman Emperors in 1607 and 1623, respectively. By her husband, she had five daughters and a son, Peter Czernin (born 1966), who inherited the title on her death in 2024.

The principal estate owned by previous barons—Audley End House at Saffron Walden in Essex—which had been obtained by Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk, from his maternal grandfather Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley, was separated from the title when it was left by the 4th Baron Howard de Walden and 1st Baron Braybrooke to his relative Richard Aldworth Neville, 2nd Baron Braybrooke.

Due to their substantial Central London landholdings, known as the Howard de Walden Estate, the Howard de Walden family is one of the wealthiest in Britain, with a net worth of about £4 billion in 2016, in which year Baroness Howard de Walden was ranked the fifth-richest woman in Britain by the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot;.

<text>is a private university in Mejiro, Toshima, Tokyo. 

The Gakushūin (or &quot;Peers School&quot;) was established during the Meiji period to educate the children of the Japanese nobility, but back then the institution had only the primary and secondary education departments. The university was established after World War II as tertiary component of the reorganised and privatised Gakushūin School Corporation.

The university is still noted for its royal connections, with most of the members of the present Imperial Family among its alumni.

==Faculties==

* Faculty of Law

* Faculty of International Social Sciences
* Faculty of Letters
* Faculty of Science
* Graduate School of Law
* Graduate School of Political Science
* Graduate School of Economics
* Graduate School of Business Administration
* Graduate School of Humanities
* Graduate School of Science and Technology
* Law School

The university provides a range of Japanese-language classes for foreign students. Although designed for Japanese students, approximately 60 classes are held in English, mainly in the Faculty of International Social Sciences. Each year the university admits approximately 80 foreign students (including short-term exchange students) of high academic and social standing to study in each faculty and graduate school.

==Academic rankings==

===General rankings===
The university was ranked 72nd in 2010 (63rd in 2009, 78th in 2008) in the Truly Strong Universities ranking issued by Toyo Keizai.

QS World University Rankings ranked Gakushuin University as 161st in Asia in 2010.

===Research performance===
Japanese national universities generally have higher standards of research than private universities. However, Gakushuin is one of the few private universities which competes with the top national universities. According to Quacquarelli Symonds, Gakushuin is the 6th-best research university in Japan and the 9th-best in Asia in terms of citations per paper.

Gakushuin is the highest-ranked Japanese university in the Nature Index measurement of research output quality.

===Graduate school rankings===
Gakushuin Law School was 24th in 2009 and 25th in 2010 in Japan on the basis of the number of its successful candidates for bar examination.

===Alumni rankings===
According to Yomiuri Weekly&#x27;s 2008 rankings, alumni of Gakushuin have the 3rd best graduate prospectives among Japanese universities. Gakushuin was top in the rankings of the Finance and Tourism industries.

École des Mines de Paris ranked Gakushuin University as 92nd in the world in 2010 in terms of the number of alumni listed among CEOs in the 500 largest worldwide companies.

===Popularity and selectivity===
Gakushuin had 7.58 applicants per place (13,765/1,815) in the 2011 undergraduate admissions. Its entrance exams are also selective.

<doc id="573694" wikidata="Q123026" url="?curid=573694" title="Charles Édouard Guillaume">
<text>Charles Édouard Guillaume (; 15 February 1861 – 13 May 1938) was a Swiss physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1920 &quot;for the service he had rendered to precision measurements in physics by his discovery of anomalies in nickel steel alloys&quot;. In 1919, he gave the fifth Guthrie Lecture at the Institute of Physics in London with the title &quot;The Anomaly of the Nickel-Steels&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Charles-Edouard Guillaume was born in Fleurier, Switzerland, on 15 February 1861. Guillaume received his early education in Neuchâtel, and obtained a doctoral degree in Physics at ETH Zurich in 1883.

Guillaume was married in 1888 to A. M. Taufflieb, with whom he had three children.

He died on 13 May 1938 at Sèvres, aged 77.

== Scientific career ==
Guillaume was head of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. He also worked with Kristian Birkeland, serving at the Observatoire de Paris – Section de Meudon. He conducted several experiments with thermostatic measurements at the observatory. 

=== Nickel–steel alloy ===

Guillaume is known for his discovery of nickel–steel alloys he named invar, elinvar and , also known as red platinum. Invar has a near-zero coefficient of thermal expansion, making it useful in constructing precision instruments whose dimensions need to remain constant in spite of varying temperature. Elinvar has a near-zero thermal coefficient of the modulus of elasticity, making it useful in constructing instruments with springs that need to be unaffected by varying temperature, such as the marine chronometer. Elinvar is also non-magnetic, which is a secondary useful property for antimagnetic watches.

=== Space radiation ===
Guillaume is also known for the &quot;earliest&quot; estimation of the &quot;radiation of the stars” in his 1896 article (&quot;The Temperature of Space&quot;). This publication made him a pioneer in plasma cosmology, the study of conditions far from any particular star. The concept was later known as the Cosmic microwave background. He was one of the first people in history to estimate the temperature of space, as 5–6 K.

=== Horology ===
As the son of a Swiss horologist, Guillaume took an interest in marine chronometers. For use as the compensation balance he developed a slight variation of the invar alloy which had a negative quadratic coefficient of expansion. The purpose of doing this was to eliminate the &quot;middle-temperature&quot; error of the balance wheel. The &quot;Guillaume balance&quot; (a type of balance wheel) in horology is named after him.

<text>Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk, (24 August 1561 – 28 May 1626), of Audley End House in the parish of Saffron Walden in Essex, and of Suffolk House near Westminster, a member of the House of Howard, was the second son of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, by his second wife Margaret Audley, the daughter and eventual sole heiress of Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden, of Audley End.

==Early life and marriages==
Thomas was born at Audley End on 24 August 1561, the second of four children Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, had by his second wife, Margaret Audley. His older sister was Elizabeth Howard, who died in infancy, and his younger siblings were Margaret and William. His maternal grandparents were Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden, and his second wife Elizabeth Grey. His paternal grandparents were Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, and his wife Frances de Vere. On her father&#x27;s side, Thomas had an older half-brother, Philip Howard, who would later become Earl of Arundel who in turn was also a second cousin of Thomas (Philip&#x27;s mother, Mary FitzAlan and Margaret Audley were first cousins).

When his mother died in January 1564, Thomas inherited the manor of Saffron Walden and other Audley family properties.

Thomas&#x27;s father, a Roman Catholic with a Protestant education, was arrested in 1569 for being involved in intrigues against Queen Elizabeth, mainly due to the Duke&#x27;s intention to marry Mary I Stewart, Queen of Scots. Although he was released in August 1570, a few months later he became involved in the Ridolfi plot to overthrow Elizabeth, install Mary on the English throne and restore Catholicism, and was arrested again in September 1571, when his participation in the plot was discovered. Norfolk was tried for high treason and sentenced to death in January 1572. He was executed in June of that same year, when Thomas was almost eleven years old. After his father&#x27;s death, Thomas and his siblings Philip, William and Margaret were left in the care of their uncle Henry Howard, who also took charge of their education. During this time, Thomas and his siblings lived with their uncle at Audley End. Due to his father&#x27;s execution, much of his paternal family&#x27;s property was forfeit, although Thomas, his younger siblings, and his older half-brother Philip were able to recover some of the forfeited estates.

His father, while imprisoned in the Tower awaiting execution, urged Thomas to marry his stepsister Mary Dacre, the daughter of Thomas Dacre, 4th Baron Dacre and Elizabeth Leybourne, the duke&#x27;s third wife. He did so; but Mary died, childless, in April 1578 at Walden.

In or before 1582, Howard remarried, his second wife being Katherine Knyvet, widow of Richard Rich, son of Robert Rich, 2nd Baron Rich. A noted beauty, she was also the eldest daughter and heiress of her father, Sir Henry Knyvet of Charlton. She survived her husband, dying in 1633.

==Naval exploits==
In December 1584, he was restored in blood as Lord Thomas Howard. Lord Thomas commanded the &quot;Golden Lion&quot; in the attack on the Spanish Armada. On 25 July 1588, the &quot;Golden Lion&quot; was one of the three ships that counter-attacked the Spanish galleasses protecting the &quot;Saint Anne&quot;. He was knighted the next day aboard &quot;Ark Royal&quot; by his kinsman, Admiral Lord Howard of Effingham.

In 1591, he was sent with a squadron to the Azores which was to waylay the Spanish treasure fleets from America. However, one fleet reached Spain before his arrival, and the second would not arrive in the islands until September. Forced by the long delay to land his sick and repair his ships, he was barely able to re-ballast and get to sea off Flores in time when his scouts reported an arriving fleet. To his horror, this proved to be, not the treasure fleet, but a powerful Spanish force dispatched from Ferrol to destroy his squadron. All of Howard&#x27;s fleet escaped, by the barest of margins, except &quot;Revenge&quot;, commanded by the squadron&#x27;s vice-admiral, Sir Richard Grenville. &quot;Revenge&quot;, some distance from the remainder of the fleet, attempted to break through the Castilian Squadron and was forced to surrender after a long fight, in which &quot;Revenge&quot; was virtually destroyed and Grenville mortally wounded.

In 1596, Howard served as vice-admiral of the expedition against Cadiz, which defeated a Spanish fleet and captured the town. Favoured by Queen Elizabeth, he was installed as a Knight of the Garter in April 1597, and in June sailed with the unsuccessful expedition to the Azores, which he had partly funded.

==Political career==
He was seriously ill in the autumn of 1597, and was created Baron Howard de Walden by writ of summons. While he recovered from his illness, he was unable to attend Parliament until January 1598. On 2 February 1598, he was admitted an honorary member of Gray&#x27;s Inn. In 1599, he commanded the fleet in The Downs; in that same year, he became an admiral. He was appointed Constable of the Tower of London on 13 February 1601 after the revolt of the Earl of Essex, and was one of the commission who tried Essex and Southampton. Still active in privateering ventures, he never obtained significant profit from them. At this time, he was also sworn High Steward of Cambridge University, and would hold the post until 1614. (He received an MA from Cambridge in 1605.)

A friend of Sir Robert Cecil, he became acting Lord Chamberlain at the close of 1602, and entertained the Queen at the Charterhouse, towards the end of her life in January 1603. Under James I, Howard immediately entered the King&#x27;s favour, being appointed Lord Chamberlain on 6 April 1603 and a Privy Counsellor on 7 April. Later that year, on 21 July 1603, he was created Earl of Suffolk. He was also appointed a commissioner for creating Knights of the Bath, and from 1604 to 1618 a commissioner for the Earl Marshalcy. He was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Suffolk in 1605, having several years earlier been made Lord Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire.

Suffolk accepted a gift from the Spanish ambassador negotiating the peace treaty of 1604, but his countess proved a more valuable informant and Catholic sympathiser. Avaricious, she accepted an annual pension of £1000 from the Spanish. While Suffolk was less pro-Spanish and pro-Catholic than his wife, she was felt to dominate her husband in matters of politics, a circumstance which would later bring him to grief.

By 1605, Cecil, now Earl of Salisbury, Suffolk, the Earl of Northampton, and the Earl of Worcester were James&#x27;s principal privy counsellors. Suffolk and Salisbury were both privy to the communications made by Lord Monteagle revealing the existence of the Gunpowder Plot, and Suffolk examined the cellar, spotting the brushwood concealing the gunpowder. Later that evening, the Keeper of the Palace, Sir Thomas Knyvet (Suffolk&#x27;s brother-in-law) made further search, revealing the gunpowder, and the plot collapsed. Suffolk was one of those commissioned to investigate and try the plotters.

Numbered by James as one of his &quot;trinity of knaves&quot; (with Salisbury and Northampton), he was nonetheless thought loyal and reliable to the King. By 1607, work was completed on Charlton Park, a house which is still home to his descendants. In December 1608, Salisbury&#x27;s eldest son and heir, William married Suffolk&#x27;s third daughter, Catharine. Salisbury, who died in 1612, praised Suffolk&#x27;s friendship in his will; and upon his death, Suffolk was appointed one of the Lords of the Treasury. Though he disliked Sir Robert Carr, the royal favourite, Suffolk supported his daughter Frances&#x27; desire to divorce her husband, the Earl of Essex to marry him. She did so in December 1613, shortly after his creation as Earl of Somerset.

On 8 July 1614, Suffolk was appointed Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, replacing his kinsman Northampton, and on 11 July 1614 was made Lord High Treasurer. His new son-in-law, Somerset, replaced him as Lord Chamberlain, and Suffolk and his family now dominated the court.

In 1615, however, Suffolk&#x27;s fall began. James had become deeply infatuated with Sir George Villiers, and Suffolk&#x27;s daughter Frances, now Countess of Somerset, was implicated in the poisoning of Sir Thomas Overbury. Suffolk was accused by James of complicity with Somerset in trying to suppress the investigation of the crime, but successfully weathered the storm. However, Suffolk then made the mistake of attempting to undermine the rising power of Villiers by grooming another handsome young man to succeed him in James&#x27;s favour. Completely unsuccessful, this only provoked a counterattack by Villiers, now (1618) Marquess of Buckingham, upon Suffolk&#x27;s conduct as Lord High Treasurer.

Suffolk&#x27;s finances were always in a perilous state. His early privateering and naval ventures nearly bankrupted him, despite some financial help from Queen Elizabeth. Under James, the situation was somewhat eased by his preferment at court, which gave him board and lodging and valuable emoluments, and the regrant of some of the sequestered estates of his father. Some of this he invested in land in East Anglia, and he further benefited from a series of customs farms and bequests from relatives. He had been forced to sell his London residence, the Charterhouse, in 1611, but this was replaced in 1614 when he inherited the Earl of Northampton&#x27;s house at Charing Cross. Suffolk added to his own troubles with extravagant building programmes. Audley End House, built from 1603 to 1616, was the largest private house in England. He also added an expensive new wing to Charing Cross, and his wife built Charlton Park on the Knyvett estates she had inherited. Suffolk&#x27;s children were also well provided for. He spent considerable sums to keep up their profile at court, and provided generous marriage portions to improve their matches. While this strategy was successful, it generated crushing debts for him, owing £40,000 in bonds and mortgages by 1618. His appointment as Lord High Treasurer in 1614 provided the opportunity to ameliorate his financial position through selling patronage and through deals with customs farmers, although it did not completely relieve his debts. It was also to prove the instrument of his downfall.

==Arrest and fall==
Through the agency of Buckingham, James was made aware of Suffolk&#x27;s misconduct in the Treasury, particularly allegations that Lady Suffolk harassed creditors of the crown, and extorted bribes from them before they could obtain payment. Suffolk was suspended from the Treasurership in July 1618. Early in 1619, his wife suffered an attack of smallpox which destroyed her famous beauty, and Suffolk himself pleaded ill health in an attempt to avoid trial. These efforts failed: in October 1619, he, his wife, and their crony Sir John Bingley, Remembrancer of the Exchequer were prosecuted on a variety of counts of corruption in the Court of Star Chamber. Sir Francis Bacon, the prosecutor, compared Lady Suffolk to an exchange woman keeping shop while her apprentice, Bingley, cried &quot;What d&#x27;ye lack?&quot; outside. On 13 November 1619, they were found guilty on all counts. A fine of £30,000 was imposed, and they were sentenced to imprisonment at the King&#x27;s pleasure.

After ten days, Suffolk and his wife were released and appealed to Buckingham to intercede for them. Although Suffolk further irritated James by legal manoeuvres to avoid seizure of his property, Buckingham was willing to be magnanimous to his rival now that his power had been destroyed. Buckingham obtained for Suffolk an audience with the King, and the fine was subsequently remitted except for £7,000. In 1623, Suffolk&#x27;s youngest son Edward married Buckingham&#x27;s niece, Mary Boteler. While Suffolk never again rose to high office, he was active in the Lords and served twice as a commissioner of ecclesiastical causes. He died at Charing Cross on 28 May 1626 and was buried on 4 June at Saffron Walden.

<text>Molvanîa (subtitled &quot;A Land Untouched by Modern Dentistry&quot;) is a book parodying travel guidebooks. The guide describes the fictional country Molvanîa, a post-Soviet state, a nation described as &quot;the birthplace of the whooping cough&quot; and &quot;owner of Europe&#x27;s oldest nuclear reactor&quot;. It was created by Australians Tom Gleisner, Santo Cilauro and Rob Sitch (locally known in Australia for television shows &quot;The D-Generation&quot;, &quot;The Late Show&quot; and &quot;The Panel&quot;, and films &quot;The Castle&quot; and &quot;The Dish&quot;). Along with the other Jetlag Travel volumes, 2004&#x27;s &quot;Phaic Tăn&quot; and 2006&#x27;s &quot;San Sombrèro&quot;, the book parodies both the language of heritage tourism and the legacy of colonialism and imperialism. The book has been criticised for promoting racial stereotypes.

== History ==
The book became a surprise success after its initial publication in Australia, sparking a bidding war for the international publication rights. Qantas has even run the half-hour video segment produced in association with the book on its international flights.

== About Molvanîa ==
The Republic of Molvanîa is a composite of many of the worst stereotypes and clichés about former Eastern Bloc and post-Soviet states. The exact location of Molvanîa is never specified; it is said to border around Hungary, Slovakia, and Slovenia. The shape of the country with its divisions strongly suggests Moldova, and the name has similarities (as has the location description by the authors as &quot;somewhere between Romania and downwind from Chernobyl&quot;); it can also represent a composite country consisting of parts of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Ukraine, Croatia, and Serbia). The book mentions Bulgarians, Hungarians, and perhaps Moldovans as its inhabitants: &quot;The Molvanian population is made up of three major ethnic groups: the Bulgs (68%) who live predominantly in the centre and south, the Hungars (29%) who inhabit the northern cities, and the Molvs (3%) who can be found mainly in prison.&quot;

The book describes the nation as having been a desolate barren-like wasteland for much of its history, similar to Russia since the 12th century, torn by civil war and ethnic unrest. Eventually Molvanîa&#x27;s various warring factions were united as a single kingdom, ruled by a series of cruel despotic kings. In the late 19th century the monarchy was overthrown, but the royal family remained popular in exile. During World War II the country was allied with Nazi Germany, and then afterwards was occupied by the Soviet Union, who set up a Communist puppet government. After the fall of European Communism in the 1990s, the country became a dictatorship run by a corrupt government with heavy ties to the Mafia.

Molvanîa is described as a very poor and rural country, heavily polluted and geographically barren. The infrastructure is terrible, with necessities such as electricity, clean water, and indoor plumbing being rare finds, largely due to bureaucratic incompetence. Though the travel guide tries to suggest otherwise, there is little to do in the country; the hotels are tiny, filthy and dilapidated, the ethnic cuisine disgusting, and the &quot;tourist attractions&quot; boring and overpriced.

The Molvanîan people are portrayed as being generally rude, dirty, and at times slightly psychotic, with numerous bizarre and illogical beliefs and traditions. The country&#x27;s patron saint is Fyodor.

=== Language ===
The fictional Molvanîan language is said to be so complicated that it takes an average of 16 years to learn. Not only is the tone in which one speaks important to the meaning, but also the pitch. It is a gendered language, with different articles being used depending on whether a noun is masculine, feminine, neutral, or a type of cheese. There are language schools for tourists to attend, which are described by the book as a &quot;waste of time&quot;.

=== Flag ===
The flag of Molvanîa is called the &quot;Trikolor&quot; despite the fact it only contains two colours: red and yellow. During the Soviet occupation, the flag had a yellow hammer and sickle in the top left corner. After the fall of communism, Molvanîa became one of the few ex-Soviet states to retain the hammer and sickle, but added a trowel into the symbol.

=== Anthem ===
The country&#x27;s national anthem could be heard on the website Molvania.com (via Wayback Machine). Its lyrics are largely anti-gypsy, yet when anyone leaves the country, the border security gives citizens and tourists the gypsy curse, and it rubs in the fact that the country is a failed state.

== Criticism ==
The book was criticised by the United Kingdom&#x27;s former Minister for Europe Keith Vaz, who accused it of exploiting prejudice. Vaz said the book was a little &quot;cheeky&quot; because &quot;it does reflect some of the prejudices which are taking root [in Europe]. He [Mr Gleisner] does try and show exactly where we are lacking in our knowledge; the sad thing is, some people might actually believe that this country exists.&quot;

<doc id="573710" wikidata="Q312673" url="?curid=573710" title="Joost van den Vondel">
<text>Joost van den Vondel (; 17 November 1587 – 5 February 1679) was a Dutch playwright, poet, literary translator and writer. He is generally regarded as the greatest writer in the Dutch language as well as an important figure in the history of Western literature. In his native country, Vondel is often called the &quot;Prince of Poets&quot; and the Dutch language is sometimes referred to as &quot;the language of Vondel&quot;. His oeuvre consists of 33 plays, a large number of poems in different genres and forms, an epic poem and many translations of predominantly classical literature. Vondel lived in the Dutch Republic during the Eighty Years&#x27; War and became the leading literary figure of the Dutch Golden Age.

Although Vondel was born in Cologne, his family, who were Mennonites, originally came from Antwerp, but had to flee after the fall of the city in 1585. They settled in Cologne, but were persecuted there as well. Eventually they moved to Amsterdam in the then newly formed Dutch Republic. In Amsterdam, Vondel joined the Chamber of rhetoric, a literary society where members studied and composed poetry together. This was the start of his long career as a writer. In 1610 he married Mayken de Wolff, with whom he had five children, of which three died in infancy. A pivotal moment in Vondel&#x27;s life was his conversion to Catholicism, which was met with controversy in the then dominant Protestant society of the Dutch Republic. In his later life Vondel dedicated himself almost exclusively to his dramatic work and religious poetry. He wrote plays until he was 80 years old and eventually died in Amsterdam at the age of 91. 
Vondel&#x27;s earliest known poem dates from 1605. The first play Vondel wrote was &quot;Het Pascha&quot; in 1612 and his last &quot;Noach&quot;, written in 1667. Vondel primarily wrote tragedies, of which a great deal were written in the period between 1654 and 1667. Although his &quot;Palamedes&quot; (1625) and &quot;Gijsbrecht van Aemstel&quot; (1637) are acclaimed works, the tragedies he wrote after 1654 are considered to be the highlights of his oeuvre. Plays like &quot;Lucifer&quot;, &quot;Jephta&quot;, &quot;Adam in ballingschap&quot; (Adam in exile) and &quot;Noach&quot; are among Vondel&#x27;s most celebrated works and are consistently ranked among the greatest works of Dutch literature. Especially &quot;Lucifer&quot; is almost by common consent regarded as Vondel&#x27;s masterpiece. Like his plays, Vondel&#x27;s poetry is acclaimed as well, in particular for the virtuosic style and mastery of verse. Notable poems include &quot;Het stockske van Oldenbarneveldt&quot; (&quot;The Cane of Oldenbarnevelt&quot;), &quot;Roskam&quot; (Curry Comb) and &quot;Kinder-lijck&quot; (Childlike), about the death of his son.

==Life==
===Early life===

Vondel was born on 17 November 1587 on the Große Witschgasse in the Free imperial city of Cologne, Holy Roman Empire. His family were originally Catholics from Antwerp (at the time part of the Spanish Netherlands), but had to flee in 1585 after the fall of the city, for becoming Anabaptists of the Mennonite faith. His father, also named Joost van den Vondel, and mother, Sara Cranen (who was the daughter of Peter Cranen, an important poet from Antwerp), lived in Cologne when their eldest son Joost was born. As Mennonites, however, they were barely tolerated in Cologne and eventually the repression against Mennonites grew to such an extent that, in 1595, the city officials informed that all local Mennonites had to leave Cologne within fourteen days. The Vondel family was left adrift and lived at Frankfurt am Main, Bremen, Emden, and Utrecht, before eventually settling at Amsterdam in the newly formed Dutch Republic. 

Joost van den Vondel the Elder managed to acquire Dutch citizenship, which enabled him to set up a business, on 27 March 1597, and he became a silk merchant on the Warmoesstraat. Amsterdam at the time was in the process of taking over the position of Antwerp as the most important trading centre of the Low Countries and was soon becoming the wealthiest city of the Dutch Republic. In part this was made possible by the enormous influx of migrants, chiefly from the Southern Netherlands (roughly 60.000 to 80.000 people migrated from the south to Amsterdam, on a population of around 115.000 in 1622). These migrants brought their own (literary) culture, especially the Chamber of rhetoric - a literary society that occupied an important place in the culture of the Low Countries - would prove to be vital for the (literary) upbringing of Vondel. 

Vondel&#x27;s parents valued good education and made sure their son went to a proper school. It is thought that Vondel may have been a pupil of the famous mathematician and educator Willem Bartjens, to whom he would later dedicate an ode. Apart from mathematics, Bartjens taught German, French and wrote poems. Not long after Vondel received his first education he started writing poems. Vondel&#x27;s first biographer, Gerard Brandt, remarked that Vondel was very young when he first started writing poetry. It is not known how old Vondel was when he wrote his first poems, though his earliest known poem dates from 1605 and was written when he was 17 years old. The poem was written for the marriage of a girl in his neighborhood and was signed with &quot;Liefde verwinnet al&quot; (Love conquers all), with which Vondel signed all of his early verses. By 1606 he was a member of the Chamber of rhetoric &quot;Het Wit Lavendel&quot; (The White Lavender), a literary society founded by Flemish Protestant refugees from the Spanish Netherlands. The choice for this Chamber of rhetoric was understandable considering the recent history of Vondel&#x27;s family. It was at this place where Vondel wrote the first of his occasional poetry. In 1606 he received Mennonite adult baptism from the congregation led by Cornelis Claesz Anslo and the following year his father died, so Vondel was brought into the family silk business as a partner. Vondel&#x27;s early poetry was still heavily influenced by the Flemish poetry of the Chamber of rhetoric, especially the poetry fellow Mennonite Karel van Mander. His early poems were eventually anthologized in the work &quot;Den nieuwen verbeterden lust-hof&quot; (The New Improved Pleasure Garden) of 1607. In the last months of 1610 Vondel married Mayken de Wolff, with whom he had five children, of which three died in infancy.

===Early works===
In 1612 Vondel wrote his first play titled &quot;Het Pascha&quot; (Passover), which dramatizes the events of the Book of Exodus and features an epilogue comparing the liberation of the enslaved Israelites from Biblical Egypt to Christ&#x27;s redemption of the human race and to the success of the Dutch Revolt against King Philip II of Spain, which was still ongoing at the time when Vondel wrote his play. It has been said that, though the power and splendor of his verse is already apparent in &quot;Het Pascha&quot;, it also lacked consistency. Nonetheless, the work was received well by both the public and critics, and was praised by Gerbrand Bredero in an ode. Apart from the virtuosic poetry, &quot;Het Pascha&quot; already contained two important aspects that would later turn out to be exemplary for Vondel&#x27;s work: firstly the usage of literature to comment on political matters, and secondly an admiration for classical antiquity. After this Vondel continued to write occasional poetry and went on to write the play &quot;Hierusalem verwoest&quot; (Jerusalem destroyed) in 1620. This work was the first play that was structurally entirely based upon classical literature, in this case Seneca&#x27;s Troades. Apart from classical literature, Vondel&#x27;s work also underwent a strong influence from French literature, in the case of &quot;Hierusalem verwoest&quot; the work of Robert Garnier, and in general the work of Guillaume de Salluste Du Bartas. In the period between 1613 and 1620 Vondel learnt Latin at the local Latin school, and by 1620 he was able to read the most important Latin writers, particularly Virgil, Seneca and later Ovid. 

In this period two other significant events occurred in his life. Firstly, Vondel apparently recovered from what Gerard Brandt called &quot;a long, languishing sickness, which greatly weakened him, exhausting his spirits and making him long for death&quot;. It is now thought that Vondel probably suffered from depression, since he mentioned he was suffering from &quot;melancholia&quot; in a letter. Secondly, in 1618 the tragedy of the arrest and execution of Johan van Oldenbarnevelt happened, which may also have contributed to Vondel&#x27;s melancholy. At the time there was a conflict in the Dutch Republic between the Arminians (also called Remonstrants) on the one side, and the Calvinists led by Franciscus Gomarus (also called Counter-Remonstrants), on the other side. Vondel, who gradually became one of the most vocal advocates for religious toleration, sided with the Arminians and had great admiration for the religious tolerance propagated by Johan van Oldenbarnevelt (who was not only the political leader of the Remonstrants, but also as Land&#x27;s Advocate the de facto leader of the Dutch Republic). As a consequence, the trial and subsequent execution of Johan van Oldenbarnevelt by Maurice of Orange not only had a great impact on Vondel, it also resulted in religious persecution of followers of Roman Catholicism, Anabaptism and Arminianism. 
Apart from the effect that this event had on Vondel personally, especially with regard to his mental health, it also led him to put his outrage into words; even five years later, in 1625, when he published his play &quot;Palamedes&quot;. There probably is no other play in the Dutch literature of the 17th century that sparked so much controversy and conversation. Although the play dealt with a minor story from the Trojan War - namely the betrayal of Palamedes by Odysseus and Diomedes (supported by the commander of the Greeks, Agamemnon) - the story was in reality an allusion on the trial and execution of Johan van Oldenbarnevelt. In the play, the unjust killing of Palamedes represents the unfair trial of Van Oldenbarnevelt, and likewise, the tyrannical Agamemnon represents the dictatorial behavior of Maurice of Orange. Although the play is an allusion, it was never Vondel&#x27;s intention to conceal the message for his readers, nor were the connotations to Van Oldenbarnevelt a mystery to the contemporary audience; everyone immediately understood what the play was really about. Also the fact that Vondel put his name on the title page and sent a copy of the work to his colleague Constantijn Huygens, indicates that he had no problem to make a statement under his own name. Although this affair eventually led him to be heavily fined by the authorities, his play, however, proved to be widely popular and went through seven editions. 
Around the same time Vondel made acquaintance with the poet Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft at the home of fellow poet Roemer Visscher, who died shortly after they met in 1620. It was there that Vondel also met the two daughters of Roemer Visscher who were talented poets as well: Maria Tesselschade Visscher and Anna Visscher. These meetings at the house of Roemer would later continue with a more diverse group of people, including Constantijn Huygens, Gerbrand Bredero, Casparus Barlaeus, Gerardus Vossius, Dirck Sweelinck (the son of Jan Pieterszoon) and P.C. Hooft as the central figure. This gathering of people, who represented the culture and science of the Dutch Republic, would later be referred to as the Muiderkring and would get a legendary status in the cultural history of The Netherlands. As a result of the meetings at the house of Roemer Visscher, Vondel would write one of his greatest poems, &quot;Het lof der zee-vaert&quot; (The Praise of Seafaring), a secular 478-verse poem with the subject of overseas trade as a means to provide peace and prosperity. The poem ends with a direct reference to the meetings at the house of Roemer Visscher. 


After the publication of Palamedes and the controversy that followed, Vondel went into another period of melancholy, but he recovered quickly and after that he published poems in quick succession. Besides &quot;The Praise of Seafaring&quot;, the most notable of these poems is the long poem &quot;Roskam&quot; (Curry Comb) wherein he denounced the selfishness and greed of the regents. &quot;Roskam&quot; is one of the many satires Vondel wrote throughout his life, most notably in the form of poetry, but also in the form of plays like &quot;Palamedes&quot;.

===Conversion to Catholicism===

After Maurice of Orange died in 1625, he was succeeded by his half-brother Frederick Henry, who was eventually capable of reconciling the differences within the Dutch Republic. In 1630, the council of Amsterdam even granted the Remonstrants new freedom of worship, which was praised by Vondel in his &quot;Inwying van den Christen tempel t’Amsterdam&quot; (Consecration of the Christian Temple of Amsterdam). Around the same time Vondel was elected dean or “prince” of the Chamber of rhetoric &quot;Het Wit Lavendel&quot; of which he was a member since his youth. An important event that occurred a year later was the founding of the Athenaeum Illustre of Amsterdam in 1631, the predecessor of the University of Amsterdam, with Gerard Vossius and Caspar Barlaeus as the first professors; two of Vondel&#x27;s close friends. Both would remain in contact with him, especially Vossius, whose library would provide Vondel with a wealth of knowledge which he would draw upon when writing his later tragedies. 

Later that year, Hugo Grotius, who, after his trial, received a prison sentence and famously escaped from Loevestein Castle, returned from exile in France in the hope of receiving rehabilitation. Vondel now finally met the scholar he admired so much and was able to have a conversation with him about the conception of a &quot;Christian-classical epic&quot; in emulation of the classical poet Virgil and the Christian poet Torquato Tasso. The work in progress, called &quot;Constantinade&quot;, was to be based on the life of Constantine the Great, after whom Vondel also named his recently born son. Grotius apparently approved of the idea, since Grotius had sympathy for a general reconciliation between Christians, based on law and ecclesiastical history, such as the situation of the early church in the first few centuries AD; an idea that was in accordance with Vondel&#x27;s own pleas for peace and toleration. Not soon after this meeting, in 1632, Vondel&#x27;s son Constantine died. As a consequence Vondel wrote the poem &quot;Kinder-lijck&quot; (meaning both Child-like [sic] and Child&#x27;s corpse – cf. the obsolete English word ‘lych’), to express his grief. This work eventually went on to become one of the most famous poems in the history of Dutch literature. 

Not long after the death of Constantine, Vondel&#x27;s 8-year-old daughter Saartje also died, in 1633 (about which he wrote a lament), and two years later another blow in his personal life occurred when his wife Mayken died in 1635. Meanwhile, at least five canto&#x27;s of his epic &quot;Constantinade&quot; were finished, but for some reason Vondel stopped writing his great work and gradually lost interest in finishing it; possibly for lack of creative energy as a result from the losses he had to endure. 
A few years later more uplifting events occurred, when in 1637 the architect Jacob van Campen led the drastic renovation of the First Dutch Academy (where the most important plays in the city were performed), to replace the small wooden building for a stately stone building; the Theatre of Van Campen. Whether Vondel was asked to write a play for the opening of the newly build theatre, or whether he wrote the play on his own initiative, is not clear. What is clear, however, is that Vondel wrote the play &quot;Gijsbrecht van Aemstel&quot; rather quickly, so that by 1637, only six months after the start of the renovation, the play was ready to be performed at the opening of the Stadsschouwburg. The subject of &quot;Gijsbrecht van Aemstel&quot; was taken from the history of Amsterdam and involved the murder of Floris V, Count of Holland. Vondel encountered a history that involved the historical figure of Gijsbrecht IV of Amstel, who allegedly played a role in the assassination, and whose castle in Amsterdam was besieged as a revenge for his involvement. Vondel modelled the play after Virgil&#x27;s Aeneid, where the siege of Troy and the subsequent sack of the city were used as parallels for contemporary Amsterdam. Although the play sparked a lot of controversy because of the Catholic imagery Vondel included, the highly dramatic play would eventually become one of his supreme achievements and would establish his reputation as a tragedian for centuries to come. Vondel dedicated &quot;Gijsbrecht van Aemstel&quot; to his friend Grotius, who, although he never saw a performance of it because of his exile, regarded this “beautifully embellished history” as “an immortal work”. 

In the period after the publication of &quot;Gijsbrecht van Aemstel&quot;, Vondel gradually began considering the genre of the play as more important than the epic, and as a result not only began writing more plays, but also started translating the plays from Ancient Greece (partly because of his growing fascination with the theatre of ancient Greece). Through his humanist friends he became acquainted with the Greek tragedies, and the first tragedy he translated was &quot;Electra&quot; by Sophocles. In the same year, in 1639, the play &quot;Maeghden&quot; (&quot;Maidens&quot;) was published; a dramatization of the history of Saint Ursula. More importantly, however, was the play &quot;Gebroeders&quot; (&quot;Brothers&quot;) in 1640, since it was the first of his tragedies to be written entirely after the Greek model, and moreover, it had success with both scholars and the general public. 
Somewhere around 1641 one of the most significant events in Vondel&#x27;s life occurred, namely his conversion to Catholicism. His conversion to Catholicism didn&#x27;t came entirely out of nowhere, since Vondel already showed sympathy for Catholicism by using Catholic imagery in plays such as &quot;Gijsbrecht van Aemstel&quot; and &quot;Maidens&quot;. Exactly when his conversion took place is not entirely clear, but most scholars agree that it must have been around 1641 (although Brandt and Jacob van Lennep date it between 1639 and 1640). Because Vondel never left a justification as to why he converted to Catholicism, it remains a guess what his motivations might have been. What certainly helped was the fact that his daughter Anna already converted to the Catholic faith and his friend Hugo Grotius earlier made pleas for a reconciliation between Christians and a return to the church of the first centuries AD. According to Smits-Veldt, Vondel apparently favored the idea of &quot;a united community of believers for whom ecclesiastical authority was binding&quot; over the internal struggles in for instance his own Mennonite community, where only the Bible can be a source of faith. His conversion in any case resulted in two important works that were directly related to his new faith. The first of which was the tragedy of 1646 &quot;Maria Stuart&quot; (Mary Stuart), in which the Catholic queen Mary was portrayed as an innocent victim of the bloodthirsty Elizabeth I. As with many of his previous plays, also this play had a strong political dimension and was very controversial. Firstly, it angered the Calvinists, who were abhorred by the glorification of Catholicism, and secondly, it offended the people who did not wish to see their one-time ally in the war against Spain, Elizabeth I, to be portrayed as a rebel. The second work of this period that dealt with his Catholic convictions is a long epic-didactic poem called &quot;Altaergeheimenissen&quot; (Secrets of the Altar, 1645), in which Vondel provides a plea in favor of the Sacraments of the Catholic Church. Although Vondel also defended his new faith in &quot;De heerlijkheid der kerke&quot; (On the Church), &quot;Altaergeheimenissen&quot; is one of the few instances in his oeuvre where he deals explicitly with his Catholic faith. In the centuries that followed &quot;Altaergeheimenissen&quot; eventually went on to be regarded as one of Vondel&#x27;s most beautiful and important works. 

===Lucifer===

One of the consequences of his conversion was that Vondel more or less alienated himself from several of his friends, such as P.C. Hooft, Barlaeus and Huygens. The matter of Vondel&#x27;s conversion was considered to be especially inconvenient since he was generally regarded as the greatest living poet of the Dutch Republic. As a gesture of reconciliation Vondel dedicated several works to his friends, for example his prose translations of the three great works by Virgil, the Georgics, the Eclogues and the Aeneid, were dedicated to P.C. Hooft. Meanwhile, the Eighty Years&#x27; War, of which the events had such a big impact on Vondel&#x27;s life, came to an end with the Treaty of Munster. To celebrate this important event he decided to write a pastoral inspired by Giovanni Battista Guarini&#x27;s work Il Pastor Fido and Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Georgics&quot;, but also with the latest theoretical insights as formulated by Vossius in his recently published &quot;Institutiones poeticae&quot; (Institutes of Poetics) with regard to its structure; this work became &quot;Leeuwendalers&quot; (Lion Fallers), his only pastoral play. 

Vondel&#x27;s understanding of Vossius&#x27;s &quot;Institutiones poeticae&quot;, a compilation of everything that was known at the time about ancient poetics (but the work also covered principles regarding the composition of music and drama), was important for the dramatic development of his future tragedies. The first of these tragedies, &quot;Salomon&quot;, was written around the same time as &quot;Leeuwendalers&quot; and was published in 1648. In the play Vondel demonstrated his deepened knowledge of the principles of the Ancient Greek drama, largely because of his careful study of the notions that were theorized by Aristotle in his Poetics. Of particular importance in this light was his admission that he previously violated the Aristotelian requirement that if an action was to arouse &quot;terror and empathy&quot;, the protagonist should be neither entirely good nor entirely bad; this demand was to be of seminal importance for his future plays, in particular for his tragedy Lucifer of 1654. 
Around this time several of his long-time friends died; first Grotius succumbed to a shipwreck in 1645, then Hooft passed away in 1647, followed by the suicide of Barlaeus in 1648 and eventually the death of Vossius in 1649. Vondel continued to write occasional poetry, for instance the elegy on the death of his friend Vossius. The highlights of his poetry of this time are two occasional poems in particular, the first is his long ode to the construction of the Royal Palace of Amsterdam (at the time the new city hall) called &quot;Inwydinge van ’t stadhuis t’Amsterdam (Inauguration of the Amsterdam Town Hall)&quot;; this work has been called &quot;the most beautiful ode to Amsterdam ever written&quot;. The second noteworthy poem is, together with &quot;Kinder-lijck&quot;, arguably his most famous poem, &quot;Het stockske van Oldenbarneveldt&quot; (The Cane of Oldenbarnevelt, referring to the cane with which Oldenbarnevelt was said to have walked to the scaffold) of 1657. Almost 40 years after the execution of Van Oldenbarnevelt, Vondel apparently was still preoccupied with what happened; which shows how great the impact of the event must have been. One of the most glorious moments in his professional life occurred in 1653, when, aged sixty-five, he was crowned with a laurel wreath at the festival of St. Lucas by some hundred poets, painters and lovers of art, to honor him in recognition of his uncontested mastery of the art of poetry.
The apotheosis of what Vondel achieved as a playwright occurred one year later with the publication of what many would call his absolute masterpiece, &quot;Lucifer&quot; (1654). In &quot;Lucifer&quot; Vondel not only achieves what has been called &quot;a triumph of the poetic imagination&quot;, but also a dramatic effect that is the result of characters who are at the height of their powers, but have conflicting aspirations, so that their relationships are leading to the greatest tensions. For this reason this work has been called &quot;Vondel&#x27;s Baroque piece par excellence&quot;, since the greatest contrasts and conflicts - typical for the Baroque - are the subject matter of the work. The play, which is in essence the primordial conflict between good and evil, is about the rebellion against God and the two consequences it had, namely the Fall of the Angels and the Fall of Man. Although the play is about the battle between good and evil, one of the most acclaimed aspects of the work is the fact that its characters, especially Lucifer, are much more complex and do not act either entirely good or evil. In February 1654, the authorities unexpectedly removed the performance of &quot;Lucifer&quot; from the repertoire; this time the controversy was apparently not of a political nature, as with &quot;Palamedes&quot;, or because the play included Catholic imagery (the Catholic elements in &quot;Lucifer&quot; were absent), but simply because of the sacrilegious aspect of “showing the high matter of the depths of God”. 

===Later years and death===

With the completion of &quot;Lucifer&quot;, Vondel was at the peak of his artistic powers. Meanwhile, in his private life the business of selling silk that was started by his father, was handed over to his son Joost Jr. in 1652. In the same year the First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–54) broke out and caused great poverty in Amsterdam; as a result Joost Jr. went bankrupt and his father had to take over his debts. Vondel then was given a job as bookkeeper at the municipal pawnbroking bank, which provided him with an above-average income, until he turned 80 and was dismissed with the retention of his salary. In the meantime - as a result of his debts - Vondel&#x27;s son Joost went to the East Indies in 1659 and died on the outward journey; along with the death of his wife Mayken, this was certainly his biggest personal tragedy. It has been said that all the plays Vondel wrote in the early 1660s - many of which are in-depth explorations of the father-son relationship - are really about sorrow over the loss of his son. 

In the same year Joost jr. died, he published his play &quot;Jephta&quot; (Jephthah) in which he explored the principles of the Aristotelian tragedy that he encountered in Vossius’ work even further. The play, based on a work by the Scottish humanist George Buchanan, is especially notable for conforming even more to the Aristotelian tragedy; he even went so far as to make of it &quot;a model tragedy&quot;. This is for instance visible in the protagonist of the piece, Jephta, who is neither completely good, nor completely bad. For many &quot;Jephta&quot; is considered to be one of the highlights of Vondel&#x27;s dramatic work. Even though the three tragedies he wrote after &quot;Jephta&quot; all deal with father-son relationships, the central subject of &quot;Koning David in ballingschap&quot; (King David Exiled), &quot;Koning David herstelt&quot; (King David Restored) and &quot;Samson&quot; (all published in 1660) is really that of a &quot;change of state&quot; (&quot;staetveranderinghe&quot;), a subject that is already present in his &quot;Jephta&quot; with its reversal of fortune from happiness to sadness. Three years later Vondel interrupted his plays based on biblical themes and wrote two plays - both dealing with the themes of guilt, justice and punishment - that were based on secular stories; the first play, &quot;Batavische gebroeders&quot;, used an episode from the revolt of the Batavians against Rome as told by Tacitus, and the second, &quot;Faëton&quot;, used the mythological story about the son of Apollo from the Metamorphoses. 
A year earlier, in 1662, Vondel produced what has been called “the greatest Dutch epic”, &quot;Joannes de Boetgezant&quot;, about the life of John the Baptist. Whereas Vondel&#x27;s previous attempt, with &quot;Constantinade&quot;, at writing an epic was abandoned for unknown reasons, &quot;Joannes de Boetgezant&quot; became the first successful biblical epic of the Dutch Republic. Vondel&#x27;s model departed from the Virgilian-Tassonian model with regard to its didactic bias, but retained the characteristic motif of the epic since Tasso of the duality between good and evil. &quot;Joannes de Boetgezant&quot; would become a model for heroic poems in the 18th century. The motif of good versus evil that pervaded &quot;Joannes de Boetgezant&quot; became a central theme in his final three plays &quot;Adam in ballingschap&quot; (Adam Exiled) of 1664, and &quot;Zungchin&quot; and &quot;Noach&quot;, both published in 1667. Especially the publication of &quot;Adam in ballingschap&quot; and &quot;Noach&quot; are significant for the completion of the trilogy that Vondel intended with &quot;Lucifer&quot;. At the same time, &quot;Adam in ballingschap&quot; and &quot;Noach&quot; are also considered to be two of the most &quot;characteristic and admirable highlights of Vondel&#x27;s imagination.&quot; With his last three plays, Vondel tried to harmonize the duality of good and evil with that of the &quot;change of state&quot; theme, to achieve a synthesis of all of his work from the previous two decades. 

From the publication of &quot;Noach&quot; onwards, which was completed when he was 80 years old, Vondel no longer wrote long poems. Because of his old age, his daughter Anna had moved in with her father to take care of him. As a result of an outbreak of the plague in Amsterdam in 1664 (which cost the lives of 24000 people; 10% of the population), his grandson Adriaan died in 1664 and not much later also his granddaughter Maria. Although Vondel&#x27;s family lived relatively prosperous, partly because of an inheritance they received from one of the widows of Joost jr., disaster struck the family once more when also Vondel&#x27;s grandson Willem died in 1670 and not much later his daughter Anna in 1675. As a result, Vondel&#x27;s only remaining grandchild Justus and his wife moved in with him. In the meantime the Third Anglo-Dutch War broke out, along with the Rampjaar in 1672; events that were particularly devastating for Vondel, because Johan de Witt, who was greatly admired by him for defending the policy of toleration, was murdered by an angry mob. About this tragedy Vondel wrote a short poem. At the end of his life Vondel was occasionally visited by friends, such as his first biographer Gerard Brandt and the painter Philips Koninck, who made several drawings and paintings of Vondel. On 5 February 1679 Vondel died at the age of 91. 

==Works==
In his lifetime, Vondel produced a considerable amount of literary works in a great variety of different genre&#x27;s and different forms. He wrote thirty-three plays, hundreds of poems - consisting of occasional poetry, satires, odes, sonnets and didactic poems - an epic and numerous translations of Classical and contemporary literature. His work is considered by many to be remarkable for its virtuosity, especially with regard to his use of language and verse. In his work, especially in his dramatic output, Vondel is rarely lighthearted; his work is generally concerned with the great questions of human history, for example how state and law function, the essence of good and evil, matters relating to guilt and punishment, and especially how mankind relates to God. In that light it can be said, that mankind&#x27;s lack of certainty and freedom of the will are two important motifs in Vondel&#x27;s dramatic work. What applies to his dramatic work, can also be said about his poetry: Vondel writes mostly about the general essences of things, even when he writes for specific occasions, Vondel generally tends to transcend the matter to a more abstracted level of truths and values; his own feelings and sentiments are in that respect not his primary concern. Vondel&#x27;s main objective in writing dramas for instance, is not so much entertainment, but the increasing of competence, as the theatre was for him especially a means that could be used to elevate the spectator; it had the function of conveying knowledge. 

Regardless of the abstraction in his work, Vondel was also a deeply engaged writer, it has been said that “everything that was to be seen in the world of his time, lives in his work, in some way or another”. It is with his literary work that Vondel took part in the great debates of his time, for instance the theological-political struggle between the Remonstrants and Contra-Remonstrants, the trial of Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, the politics of toleration or the occasional poetry for regents and stadtholders. The sources Vondel drew upon for his works were generally the poets and playwrights from the classical period; according to W.A.P. Smit his most important literary influences were Du Bartas, Seneca, Virgil, Grotius, Vossius, Sophocles, Euripides and Tasso. Indeed, Vondel was highly influenced by the playwrights of Ancient Greece, but at the same time he tried to use their own concept of emulation (&quot;aemulatio&quot;) to not only imitate their work, but also improve on it. Besides his indebtedness to classical literature, his work is at the same time deeply rooted in Christian philosophy and the humanism as encountered in the works of Erasmus; especially with an adherence to a form of religious toleration. 

===Plays===
Although Vondel produced thirty-three plays in his life, eight of his plays were translations of mainly classical works. Almost all of his plays are tragedies, with the exception of &quot;Leeuwendalers&quot;, which is a pastoral work and &quot;Het Pascha&quot;, which is a tragicomedy. Vondel&#x27;s development as a playwright was largely subject to his reading and translations of works on Ancient Greek theatre and the poetics of Seneca and Aristotle in particular. According to the literary historian W.A.P. Smit, four turning points in the oeuvre of Vondel can be made, which makes it possible to divide his dramatic output in five periods. The &quot;first period&quot; covers the years between 1610 and 1620; when in 1612 Vondel wrote his first play &quot;Het Pascha&quot;, and eight years later, in 1620, &quot;Hierusalem verwoest&quot;. This period is characterized by a highly symbolic style of which especially &quot;Hierusalem verwoest&quot; is very much indebted to Seneca&#x27;s work. The &quot;second period&quot; covers the years after 1620 until 1640 and has to be seen against the backdrop of Vondel&#x27;s acquaintance with P.C. Hooft, Laurens Reael and other members of the Muiderkring on the one hand, and his acquaintance with the works of Virgil, Seneca and Tasso on the other. This period produced the play &quot;Amsteldamsche Hecuba&quot; (1626), but more significant is his highly dramatic work &quot;Palamedes&quot; from 1625, in which Vondel used the mythology of the eponymous Greek hero to function as an allegory for the execution of Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, whilst at the same time taking side in the religious-political debate that dominated the Dutch Republic at the time. The second great work of this period is his tragedy set in medieval Holland &quot;Gijsbrecht van Aemstel&quot;, about the siege and the subsequent sack of Amsterdam. This play, written for the opening of the new Theatre of Van Campen, is probably his most famous and frequently performed play. The last play of this period is the work &quot;Maeghden&quot; (&quot;Maidens&quot;), about the legend of Saint Ursula, in which Vondel showed a new affinity with the Ancient Greek drama.

The &quot;third period&quot;, from 1640 until 1648, starts with the play &quot;Gebroeders&quot; (&quot;Brothers&quot;) about the moral struggle of King David, who is forced by the command of God to execute seven descendants of Saul. Vondel&#x27;s translation of Sophocles&#x27; Elektra was according to W.A.P. Smit a vital impulse for the start of this period, because of the Sophoclean emphasis of the emotional effect that the struggles in the protagonist could have on the inner self. In the same year Vondel wrote two plays about Joseph, &quot;Joseph in Dothan&quot; and &quot;Joseph in Egypten&quot;, that completed a trilogy with his earlier translated work by Hugo Grotius &quot;Sophompaneas&quot;. These plays, along with &quot;Gijsbrecht van Aemstel&quot; proved to be highly popular and were the peak of his success at the theatre of Amsterdam. A year later, in 1641, Vondel published his play &quot;Peter en Pauwels&quot;, a Roman Catholic drama about the martyrdom of Saint Peter and Saint Paul; a play that was far less popular than his previous ones. In 1646, Vondel produced a second play influenced by Catholicism, &quot;Maria Stuart&quot;, this time about the execution of the Scottish queen Mary Stuart. The last play that marked this period is Vondel&#x27;s only pastoral play &quot;Leeuwendalers&quot; (Lion Fallers), a celebration piece for the end of the Eighty Years’ War, in which peasants and hunters from North and South finally end their longstanding conflict. 
The beginning of the &quot;fourth period&quot; of Vondel&#x27;s dramatic work is marked by the influence that Gerardus Vossius and especially Vossius’ translations of the poetics of Aristotle had on Vondel. The period starts in 1648 with the work &quot;Salomon&quot;; a highly popular tragedy about the downfall of King Salomon. This period produced some of the greatest works Vondel has written, especially the publication of what many would call his masterpiece &quot;Lucifer&quot;, which deals with the rebellion of Lucifer against God and the subsequent Fall of the Angels and the Fall of Man. But also &quot;Jephta&quot;, a play about the sacrifice of Jephthah&#x27;s daughter to God, is regarded as one of Vondel&#x27;s finest works and “a pinnacle of his dramatic art”. Another play that Vondel produced in this period is &quot;Salmoneus&quot; about the wicked King of Eleia who wants to be worshipped as Zeus. The &quot;fifth period&quot; W.A.P. Smit discerns, is the last period in the development of Vondel&#x27;s dramatic work. According to Smit it begins in 1660, and once again with a translation of a work by Sophocles; this time Oedipus Rex. This period covers, with nine plays by far the most productive period in Vondel&#x27;s career, and is dominated by Vondel&#x27;s choice of centralizing the insight of Sophocles of a &quot;change of state&quot; (&quot;staetveranderinghe&quot;) in the protagonist. His first two plays of this period are &quot;Koning David in ballingschap&quot; (King David Exiled) and &quot;Koning David herstelt&quot; (King David Restored) and deal with King David&#x27;s conflict with his son Absalom; both plays are regarded as two of the highlights of this period. In 1661 the play &quot;Samson&quot; was published, about Samson&#x27;s humiliation and revenge. And one year later the play &quot;Adonias&quot; which tells the story of Adonijah and his attempt to get rid of his younger brother Salomon. The play &quot;Batavische gebroeders&quot; (Batavian Brothers) is an exception with regard to its secular subject: the revolt of Gaius Julius Civilis and his brother against the Roman Empire. In the same year, 1663, Vondel wrote the tragedy &quot;Faëton&quot; about the hubris of the son of the sun god Helios. The tragedy &quot;Adam in ballingschap&quot; (Adam in exile) that Vondel wrote in 1664, which tells the story of the fall of Adam and Eve, is today considered as one of the absolute highlights of Vondel&#x27;s oeuvre. Three years later, in 1667, Vondel published his last two plays. The first &quot;Zunghchin&quot; (Chongzhen), deals with the end of the Ming dynasty in 1644, when the Chongzhen Emperor took his own life. Vondel&#x27;s acclaimed swan song is the tragedy &quot;Noach&quot;, which not only completed the trilogy he intended to make with &quot;Lucifer&quot; and &quot;Adam in ballingschap&quot;, but can also be seen as a synthesis of everything he made before; W.A.P. Smit refers to it as &quot;not only Vondel&#x27;s last tragedy, but also his most surprising one&quot;.

Although as a playwright, Vondel worked in primarily one specific genre; the tragedy, as a poet he covered almost every poetic genre: odes, elegies, satires, occasional poetry, paeans, obituary poetry, hymns and sonnets. Vondel&#x27;s work as a poet has to be seen in the context of the tradition of the Chamber of rhetoric, which were literary societies that originated in the Southern Netherlands in the 15th century, but spread to the Northern provinces, where members studied and composed poetry together especially for specific occasions. From 1606, if not earlier, Vondel was a member of &quot;’t Wit Lavendel’&quot; (The White Lavender). Many of his poems were written for specific occasions and are therefore occasional poetry, but at the same time, the occasional poems were sometimes written as e.g. hymns, or sometimes as e.g. funerary poetry; and are therefore overlapping in terms of genre. The characteristics that apply to Vondel&#x27;s plays, can to a certain extent also be applied to Vondel&#x27;s poetry. Like many of his plays, Vondel used his poems to comment on political, religious and cultural matters. And just like in his plays, Vondel aims to elevate the reader of his poetry and at the same time to propagate a certain point of view (often of a moralistic and didactic nature) on an abstract level of truths and values. The model Vondel used for his poems is derived from classical literature. But whereas his plays are modelled on the Ancient Greek playwrights and the poetics of Aristotle, his poetry is more indebted to Virgil, Ovid and especially Horace (i.e. his poetry, but also his theoretical work Ars Poetica). Apart from the influences of Latin literature, the works of the French poet Guillaume de Salluste Du Bartas were also an important influence.
An acclaimed and controversial aspect of Vondel&#x27;s poetic oeuvre is without question his satires (‘hekeldichten’). Most of the satires Vondel wrote were written in the early period of his life, until 1654, whilst later in his life he generally seemed to have lost interest in commenting on political struggles and was more preoccupied with religious matters and his dramatic work. The highlight of Vondel&#x27;s satires are represented by two large poems published in 1630, the first of which &quot;Roskam&quot; (Curry-comb) is a denunciation of the selfishness and greed of the regents, whilst the second, &quot;Harpoen&quot; (Harpoon), is a satire in which Vondel attacks the intolerance of preachers. The &quot;brutal ferocity of his satirical verse&quot; was - just like many of his plays - highly controversial at the time and this prevented his satires from being published even thirty years later. In the years 1625 until 1632, Vondel wrote most of his satires, around 32 in total, with great variety in tone and subject matter. The execution of Johan van Oldenbarnevelt was a subject that was clearly important to Vondel, as can be seen in the satire ‘’Geuze-vesper’’ (Beggar&#x27;s Vespers), which hits out at Van Oldenbarnevelt&#x27;s judges. With his satires, Vondel took part in the political debates of his time, and, as he himself wrote in &quot;Roskam&quot;, couldn&#x27;t remain silent to what he considered in his heart to be injustice. 

Apart from the satires, Vondel&#x27;s odes are another important aspect of his poetry. His ode&#x27;s were written to a large extent as occasional poetry, for instance for the occasion of the opening of buildings, such as the poem &quot;Inwying van den Christen tempel t’Amsterdam&quot; (Consecration of the Christian Temple of Amsterdam) for the inauguration of the first Remonstrant church building in Amsterdam, in 1630. Another notable example is the &quot;Inwydinge van ’t stadhuis t’Amsterdam&quot; (Inauguration of the Amsterdam Town Hall), which has been called &quot;the most beautiful ode to Amsterdam ever written&quot;. In his &quot;Aan de beurs van Amsterdam&quot; (To the Commodity Exchange of Amsterdam), he praised the architecture of Hendrick de Keyser, but also emphasized the unreliability of fortune and the volatility of fate; an abstraction to universal values that was a common technique in Vondel&#x27;s poetry. Apart from the many ode&#x27;s on buildings, Vondel also wrote ode&#x27;s to a great variety of different subjects; an example of this is his great poem &quot;Lof der Zeevaert&quot; (In Praise of Seafaring) of 1623, which celebrates overseas trade. Other examples are a large number of ode&#x27;s to different people, such as his ode for Erasmus, an ode to Michiel de Ruyter or his &quot;Zegezang ter eeren van Fredrik Hendrik prince van Oranje&quot;; an ode to Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange. 

Two other important aspects of his poetic output are his obituary poems (or elegies) and his religious poems. Throughout his life, Vondel wrote poems to commemorate or lament the loss of people who were either close to him or close to his friends. Two of the most famous examples of this kind of poetry are the poems &quot;Kinder-lijck&quot; (meaning both Child-like and Child&#x27;s corpse) and &quot;Uitvaart van mijn dochtertje&quot; (Funeral of my little daughter), that Vondel wrote for the loss of his son Constantijn (in 1632) and for the loss of his daughter Saartje (in 1633). But Vondel also wrote similar poetry for others, for instance his &quot;Vertroostinge aan Geeraerdt Vossivs&quot; (Consolation to Geeraerdt Vossius) for his friend Gerard Vossius who lost his son Dionys. Many of these poems have a similar tendency in that they relate the consolation somehow to a kind of Christian-stoic attitude, an example of this can be found in the last stanza of Vondel&#x27;s consolation to Vossius. Apart from his obituary poetry, of which many have a thematic nature that is deeply Christian, Vondel also wrote poetry to account for his religious convictions. Two poems in particular stand out, first his &quot;Altaergeheimenissen&quot; (Secrets of the Altar) of 1645, about the Sacraments of the Catholic Church, and secondly &quot;De heerlijkheid der kerke&quot; (&quot;On the Church”) which deals with Vondel&#x27;s vision of the history Catholic Church; i.e. the origin of the church and its contemporary place in the world.

==Style==
Vondel&#x27;s style is influenced by the cultural-historical environment to which he was subject; in that light the lyrical poetry of the Chamber of rhetoric was vital for his poetry throughout his career, but also the characteristics of the Baroque is essential to explain his style. The poetry of the Chamber of rhetoric is characterized by an emphasize on technical poetry, with lots of rhyme (end rhyme as well as internal rhyme) and lots of embellishment with e.g. exotic words, alliteration and onomatopoeia. The characteristics of the baroque can be discerned in both the poetic and dramatic works of Vondel, for instance in his &quot;Lucifer&quot; the typical aspects of the Baroque are present with the emphasis on the colossal and the overwhelming. But also with regard to the use of language his style is typically baroque: lots of rhetoric, lots of antithesis (which enhances the drama), and the language is usually sensitive and sensual with regard to the use of metaphors. The abundance of language, with its rich imagery, extended comparisons, sound effects and “the majestic rhythm of his alexandrines” can therefore be explained through Vondel being a writer of the Baroque, but also through his connection with the Chamber of rhetoric. Vondel&#x27;s dramatic works, but also many of his poems, are generally written by employing alexandrines (i.e. iambic hexameters with masculine and feminine endings). But there are exceptions, for instance his tragedy &quot;Jephta&quot; and the chori of his plays, deviate from the standard practice of using alexandrines. The style of his verses is furthermore characterized by a great virtuosity in terms of rhyme and rhythm; in that light, it has been argued that “Vondel was a language virtuoso; more than that, he was a builder of language.” 

The nature of his work is to a certain extent directly connected to his style. It can be said that his work, especially his dramatic work, can best be understood as symbolic, rather than psychological; in the sense that Vondel strives to use the characters of his plays as symbolic for mankind in general. The drama in Vondel&#x27;s tragedies for instance are drama&#x27;s of idea&#x27;s, in particular idea&#x27;s that are related to religious matters. For this reason, the individual characterization and development of the inner life of the characters of his play is only given to a certain extent; the real drama that rages in the protagonists&#x27;s mind is achieved with Vondel&#x27;s poetry. His poetry is therefore a crucial element of his dramatic work, since style is being employed to create the tension of his work and the conflicts with which his characters are confronted. In this sense, it can be said that there is a preference in Vondel&#x27;s style to narrate the developments of the play, rather than the usage of overflowing personal emotions; as a result his drama&#x27;s have a clear epic style.

==Legacy==
===Influence===

Vondel&#x27;s work had an enormous impact on Dutch literature. It has been argued that even in the late nineteenth century, Dutch poetry was still colored by Vondel&#x27;s language. Vondel&#x27;s plays continued to be read and performed after his death, although certainly not all of his plays continued to be performed. &quot;Gijsbrecht van Aemstel&quot; however did, as it was performed annually on New Year&#x27;s Day and the days that followed. During the 18th century, although the dominant style switched to French classicism, Vondel&#x27;s work continued to be admired, for instance by Balthasar Huydecoper, as representing the “language of the Parnassus”. Although his work was less acclaimed in comparison to the previous century, he was still a source of inspiration for 18th century writers such as Johannes le Francq van Berkhey. The same goes for the work of Lucretia van Merken, one of the most important Dutch poets and playwrights of the 18th century, who was profoundly influenced by Vondel&#x27;s writings and modeled her plays after his work. Another example is Willem Bilderdijk, the most important figure of 18th and 19th century Dutch literature, who explicitly called Vondel his master and his example. In the 19th century, partly because of the influence of Romanticism, with the emphasis on poetic originality and genius, Vondel&#x27;s work was more appreciated. Two authors of the 19th century were important in giving his work renewed attention. The first was Jacob van Lennep, who was vital in arranging and editing his complete works and eventually established Vondel&#x27;s reputation as the national poet of The Netherlands. The second was Joseph Albert Alberdingk Thijm, who championed his work and at the same time emphasized his Catholicism. Moreover, some of the most important literary figures of the 19th and early 20th century were distinctly influenced by Vondel&#x27;s work, examples are Guido Gezelle, Hendrik Tollens, Albert Verwey and Herman Gorter. 
Apart from his influence on works of Dutch-language literature, Vondel&#x27;s work had significant - although at the same time limited - influence abroad; to a large extent this had to do with the fact that his work was not translated during his life in any other language but German. Because of the German translations of his work, Vondel had a considerable influence on German Baroque literature, especially on the dramatic works of this period. Particularly the works of Andreas Gryphius, the creator and master of German Baroque tragedy, were significantly influenced by Vondel&#x27;s plays. Since Andreas Gryphius lived in The Dutch Republic for several years, it is assumed that he visited the performance of Vondel&#x27;s plays. Gryphius was in any case well acquainted with his work; he translated Vondel&#x27;s &quot;Gebroeders&quot; into German, and moreover, his verse and style, as well as his dramatic technique, were derived from the plays of Vondel. Partly through Gryphius, but also through motifs that were common in Vondel&#x27;s drama&#x27;s, playwrights like Daniel Casper von Lohenstein and Johann Christian Hallmann were indebted to his work as well. Another significant influence that Vondel had on German literature was through the work of “the father of German literature” Martin Opitz, who was particularly influenced with regard to the structure of the rhythm and meter of his verses. 
A controversial and ongoing discussion, is the possible influence Vondel had on the works of John Milton. During the 1880s, it was suggested by George Edmundson, that John Milton drew inspiration from Vondel&#x27;s &quot;Lucifer&quot; (1654) and &quot;Adam in ballingschap&quot; (1664) for the writing of his epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (1667). Subsequently, this view has been heavily criticized and today there is consensus among scholars that there is not a direct influence of &quot;Lucifer&quot; on &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, but rather a common use of the biblical creation story as the main source of both works, and possibly similarities of Vondel and Milton both using Hugo Grotius’ &quot;Adamus Exul&quot; as a model for their work. According to Watson Kirkconnell, Edmundson merely demonstrated, &quot;scores of parallels.&quot; However, writing in 1952, Kirkconnell laid out his case that Milton was aware of Vondel. To prove that Milton knew the Dutch language, Kirkconnell quoted letter by Roger Williams to John Winthrop, &quot;The Secretary of the Council, Mr. Milton, for my Dutch I read &quot;him&quot;, read me many more languages.&quot; Edmundson departs from a similar premise, namely that John Milton had a proficient knowledge of the Dutch language, and argues that Milton was acquainted with Vondel&#x27;s work. Similarly, it has been argued that Milton at least knew who Vondel was, since Milton met Vondel&#x27;s friend Hugo Grotius in Paris and was well acquainted with Franciscus Junius, who lived in England for many years. These matters led Kirkconnell - just like Edmundson - to believe that Vondel&#x27;s &quot;Samson&quot; was in fact a major influence upon Milton&#x27;s &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot;. The discussion remains unresolved, although it can be said that “Edmundson may have gone too far in a few respects in asserting Milton&#x27;s indebtedness, (...) the other extreme by denying every relationship between Vondel and Milton” goes too far as well.

===Critical reputation===

Vondel is generally regarded as the greatest playwright and poet in the history of Dutch language literature. In his native country he is often referred to as “the Prince of Poets” and Dutch is sometimes - especially in France - called “the language of Vondel”. Although his plays are generally considered to be his masterpieces, Vondel is equally acclaimed for his poetry. It has been said that Dutch lyric poetry reached the sublime in the work of Vondel, not only in the lyric “but in all genres”. Theodoor Weevers for instance writes that Vondel “surpasses all Dutch poets by his versatility, by the scope and profundity of his thought, and by his apparently effortless command of all metrical forms with the exception of one, the sonnet, in which his achievement, although notable, is second to that of Hooft.&quot; Vondel was revered during his lifetime, by the 1640s he was already generally acknowledged as the greatest living poet in the Dutch Republic. This assessment was emphasized in 1653, when he was crowned with a laurel wreath at the festival of St. Lucas, to honor him “in recognition of his uncontested mastery of the art of poetry”. When Vondel died, the pallbearers were given a memorial coin showing the poet on one side and on the other the inscription: “The country&#x27;s oldest and greatest poet.” In the centuries that followed, the view of Vondel as the greatest poet the Dutch language has produced, has not changed, although he has certainly not been without criticism, for instance with regard to his Catholicism or with regard to the structural choices of his plays. Nevertheless, from the 19th century onwards Vondel&#x27;s play Lucifer has been regarded as a masterpiece and the absolute highlight of his oeuvre. In that light Albert Verwey remarked that “Vondel&#x27;s work is like a mountain with a statue on top. That statue is his &quot;Lucifer&quot;.”

It has been said that Vondel&#x27;s European importance lies in the fact that “his drama (...) is a consummation in classical (Sophoclean) form of the late medieval drama as it had become a Dutch tradition.” A similar view is voiced by Jan Konst, who wrote: “Nowhere in the Europe of the 1660s does one find plays that breathe the spirit of Aristotle, that execute his ideas to such an extent as Vondel&#x27;s tragedies.” Moreover, it has been said, for instance by P.H. Albers, that Vondel “is the greatest poet the Netherlands has produced, one who is distinguished in every form and who occupies a place among the best poets of all time.&quot; Over the course of centuries many writers made analogies to poets and playwrights of other languages to illustrate Vondel&#x27;s mastery of versification. Examples include comparisons to Dante Alighieri, William Shakespeare, Pedro Calderón de la Barca and Johann Wolfgang Goethe. Similar comparisons have been voiced by Watson Kirkconnell, who said &quot;Vondel is to the Netherlands what Shakespeare is to England.&quot; Or Sir Edmund Gosse: “Not merely is he to Holland all that Camoens is to Portugal and Mickiewicz is to Poland, but he stands on a level with these men in the positive value of his writings.&quot; And Jean Stals, who translated Vondel&#x27;s work into French and wanted to give it “its rightful place” amidst Dante, Corneille, Racine, Goethe, Schiller, Shakespeare, “not to mention the old ones.” Indeed, Vondel&#x27;s work, although acclaimed, is generally not well known outside of the Netherlands and Flanders, and for that reason many of the analogies are considered to be flawed. In that light, the novelist Frans Kellendonk wrote: “Indeed, Vondel is not a Dante, not a Shakespeare, not a Corneille. Vondel is Vondel.” 

===Commemoration===

Over the centuries, many commemorations were initiated for Vondel. The veneration for Vondel in the Netherlands started in the late 19th century and probably reached the highpoint with the Commemoration of 1937, when a solemn meeting in Amsterdam was held and a commemoration book was published as a permanent contribution. Today, almost all cities in the Netherlands have at least one street named after Vondel, just like his native Cologne, where there is a &quot;Vondelstraße&quot; in the Neustadt-Süd-district. Another commemorative example is the Dutch five guilder banknote, which bore Vondel&#x27;s portrait from 1950 until they were discontinued in 1990.

Arguably the most important commemoration for Vondel is Amsterdam&#x27;s biggest park, the Vondelpark, especially with the statue of Vondel in the northern part of the park. The statue was erected in 1867 and made by the sculptor Louis Royer; the plinth for the statue was designed by the famous architect Pierre Cuypers.

<doc id="573712" wikidata="Q4966416" url="?curid=573712" title="Bridge of Birds">
<text>Bridge of Birds is a fantasy novel by Barry Hughart, first published in 1984. It is the first of three novels in &quot;The Chronicles of Master Li and Number Ten Ox&quot; series. The original draft of &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot; is included in a special slipcased version of the omnibus collection, &quot;The Chronicles of Master Li and Number Ten Ox&quot;, released by Subterranean Press in 2008.

Hughart called the novel &quot;a modern version of a classical form of Chinese novel, which was an underground Taoist form designed to fight back against Confucians. Confucians liked to castrate people who fought the establishment. Without mentioning names, the Taoists could use real emperors and real power structure in a fantasy form.&quot;

==Plot==

The book is set in a fantastical version of imperial China (Hughart subtitled it &quot;A Novel of an Ancient China That Never Was&quot;). It draws on and reinvents the traditional tale of The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl and other myths, poems and incidents from Chinese history. The real story of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl is referenced at the end of the book.

In the beginning of the novel, the village of Ku-fu is stricken by a plague which kills its silkworms and sends its children between the ages of eight and thirteen into a coma. Number Ten Ox, the narrator, is dispatched to find a wise man who can cure the children. In Peking, he finds Master Li Kao, a drunken scholar with a self-described &quot;slight flaw in his character&quot;, who immediately identifies the cause of the plague as &quot;ku&quot; poison, an incurable poison inflicted on the village by two dishonest villagers trying to corner the silk crop. In order to cure the children, Ox and Master Li set out to find the Great Root of Power, which can cure anything. They begin by seeking it in the palace of the feared Ancestress.

As it turns out, however, the Ancestress possesses only the lesser Root of Power, and the true Great Root is in the possession of the tyrannical and avaricious Duke of Ch&#x27;in. After surviving the Duke of Ch&#x27;in&#x27;s deadly games that consisted of labyrinths and terrible monsters, they succeed in gathering different parts of the Ginseng. Still, these are all ineffective in curing the children. Along with the Ginseng, they also find three handmaiden ghosts that repeated the same story, &quot;The birds of China must fly!&quot; One of the many people they meet in their adventure is Henpecked Ho, who tells them the story of how a god, Star Shepherd, fell in love with a human girl, who was given the title of Princess of Birds. They also meet Key Rabbit, who is married to Lotus Cloud. Like every other man with a pure heart, Ox worships Lotus Cloud and showers her with expensive gifts. The heroes visit the Old Man of the Mountain. There they learn that in order to become immortal one must obtain something from the gods, and to become invulnerable one&#x27;s heart must be removed. This information helps them figure out that somehow their quest to find the Ginseng is intertwined with the story of the Princess of Birds. They also conclude that the Duke of Ch&#x27;in knows the secrets of immortality and invulnerability, and was the same Duke who tricked the Princess of Birds and her three handmaidens centuries ago.

Master Li and Number Ten Ox are able to find the Duke&#x27;s heart. The Duke is killed, and Master Li bows to Lotus Cloud and calls her the Princess of Birds. Master Li and Number Ten Ox listen to a sound that turns out to be the sound of a trillion birds making a bridge to heaven. The Princess places the Great Root of Power in Ox&#x27;s hand. Back at the village of Ku-Fu, the children are cured. Great glorious explosions of stars streak across the sky as Star Shepherd opens his arms to receive Lotus Cloud, the Princess of Birds.

* The Old Man of the Mountain: The wisest man in the world. He lives in the Omei Mountains at the end of Bear&#x27;s Path, and he does not sell his secrets cheaply. He gives Master Li the secret of immortality in exchange for the loot from raiding the Ancestress&#x27;s castle.

==Original draft==
Barry Hughart&#x27;s unpublished original draft for &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot; featured a similar plot, but Number Ten Ox, the village of Ku-fu, and the ginseng plot were not present in the original draft.

===Synopsis===
The story of the original draft begins at the Monastery of Shu, whose abbot abuses Li Kao until he saves the abbot&#x27;s life. The abbot then gives him a beggar&#x27;s bowl and robe and tells him one day he will be called and it is his duty to follow that call. Li Kao departs on a quest to become rich and stay young in China.

Li Kao begins his journey in the city of Peking where he steals five hundred gold coins in order to start his life of wealth. While fleeing, he falls off a cliff and finds the legendary skull of Cheng Hang, who charges him to find three trinkets, a crystal ball, a bronze bell, and a small flute, in order to fix a terrible event that happened in heaven which has separated two gods in love who are unable to see each other due to the laws of heaven and can only be reunited by forming the Bridge of Birds. Li Kao is given only the knowledge of what to look for and the hint that Cheng Hang will somehow provide Li Kao with a dragon that will help guide him on his quest. His quest takes him to have multiple quarrels with the savage Duke of Ch&#x27;in who will do anything in his power to stop Li Kao from succeeding from finding a secret truth hidden inside the quest for the trinkets. In the end, he completes the quest, the Bridge of Birds is formed, and all in heaven is set right again.

==Influences==

===20th century orientalist novels and chinoiserie===
&quot;Bridge of Birds&quot; has been compared to the literary genre of chinoiserie, a synonym for &quot;orientalist&quot; which can refer to the genre of China-based stories (and is also used describe decorative art forms). Well-known novels in the chinoiserie tradition include the Kai Lung stories by Ernest Bramah, &quot;The Painted Veil&quot; by W. Somerset Maugham, &quot;The Good Earth&quot; by Pearl S. Buck, and the Chia Black Dragon trilogy by Stephen Marley, all novels written in the twentieth century that reflect on the landscape of China and include cultural aspects. Bramah&#x27;s Kai Lung stories are said to be so accurate to the actual setting and culture of China that he must have lived there at some point in his life; however, there is no evidence of that. Since chinoiserie focuses more on the artistic and beautiful side of China, Stephen Marley likes to refer to his trilogy as Chinese Gothic because its fantasy is darker than that of a book like &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot;.

===Classic Chinese novels===
In the &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot;″ author biography Barry Hughart mentions that the book was influenced by the fact that &quot;vast numbers of Chinese deities had really originated as characters in novels&quot; and &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot; contains substantial references and allusions to the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese culture, especially &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; and &quot;Journey to the West&quot;.

&quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;, written by Cao Xueqin, is one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese culture. This novel turned Chinese writing toward the use of personal experience and tragedy and away from a previous reliance on well-known myths and legends and stereotypical characters that had earned fiction a reputation for moral irrelevance. This novel is mentioned in &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot;.

&quot;Journey to the West&quot;, by Wu Cheng&#x27;en, a quest story like &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot;, tells a tale of a long pilgrimage from China to India in search of enlightenment. Many obstacles like dragons, tigers, demons and monsters are faced along the way.

&quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; was written by Luo Guanzhong, and &quot;The Water Margin&quot; is credited to Shi Nai&#x27;an. These two novels are also part of the collection of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese culture. Although these two novels are the least like &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot;, there are still some similarities.

===Chinese culture===
There are numerous allusions to actual Chinese cultural practices and events in &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot;, including the following:
* Bamboo Dragonfly – The traditional Chinese version of the illuminating flying toy was made of bamboo. This version contained two blades that functioned as the propeller. They were connected to a thin rod. When you would rub the rod with your palms, it would rotate and release the bamboo dragonfly. Because there is no electricity involved, the bamboo dragonfly did not fly to great heights. A helicopter-sized version features in the novel.
* Chinese village life – &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot; begins in a traditional Chinese village named Ku-fu. In Chinese culture, villages are traditionally considered the foundation of society because they contain the culture, traditions, and customs of China.
* Dragon Boat Festival – A Chinese holiday is celebrated by boat races on the fifth day of the fifth lunar moon, which is the same day the Chinese poet Chu Yuan died in 277 B.C. On this day citizens throw bamboo leaves filled with rice into the water symbolizing the attempt to distract fish from eating his corpse. In &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot;, a man dressed as the dead poet appears to rob the celebrants during the ceremony.
* The August Personage of Jade – A supreme Taoist deity who created the Chinese zodiac by making the animals race across the river to see the order in which they would be on the calendar. In &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot;, he manipulates the characters to save Jade Pearl.
* Dragon Dance – The dragon dance is an important part of traditional Chinese culture. The dragon dance expresses happiness and wishes. Usually performed by a group of people with stage props that they will use to form the head, body, and tail of a dragon. They perform the many different forms and models of the dance during celebrations. Master Li and Number Ten Ox perform this dance when they celebrate at the end of &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot;.
* Ginseng is a major plot element in the book due to its legendary healing powers, which reflects traditional Chinese belief in ginseng, or &quot;ren shen&quot;, as the &quot;king of a hundred herbs&quot; . The actual herb reportedly assists brain function, limits the adrenal stress response, has anti-neoplastic properties, is an antioxidant, and stimulates insulin release. In traditional Chinese medicine, Ginseng is considered a &quot;warm&quot; food that can tonify primal qi, nourish yin Ginseng has been traded in China for over 3000 years, a fact reflected in the book.
* Legalism – Literally means &quot;school of law&quot;. This philosophy had three subjects: fa, shu, and shi. Fa meant &quot;law or principle&quot; and the law code must be clearly written and made public. Laws should reward those who obey them and punish those who break them. Shu meant &quot;method, tactic or art&quot; and this meant that secrets were to be employed by the ruler so others cannot take control of the dynasty. Shi meant &quot;legitimacy, power, or charisma&quot; and this meant that the position of the ruler was what held power. In the novel, the Duke of Ch&#x27;in espouses this philosophy.
* Moon Festival – Also known as the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Mooncake Festival, or the Zhongqui Festival. Customs include eating mooncakes, matchmaking, carrying lanterns, burning incense, and Fire Dragon Dances. In &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot;, Number Ten Ox visits the city of Peking during the hectic Moon Festival.
* Sword dance – A popular dance in Chinese culture that combined the dancing of swords of all different sizes with acrobatics. Sword dancing evolved from the martial art of &quot;wu shu&quot; and was very popular within the Chinese opera performances.
* Tomb Festival – Known as Qingming Festival in China, but is also referred to as Tomb Sweeping Day because one of the major customs for this day is sweeping the tombs. This is a day spent honoring the dead. People will visit the graves of their ancestors to clean them, leave offerings of food, and honor the dead. Master Li and Number Ten Ox take the time on this day to honor their dead ancestors in &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot;.
* Yama King – Judge of the dead in Chinese folk religion. When people die he would either grant them good fortune because they led a good life, or punish them if they led a life of evil deeds and misfortune. This religious figure is alluded to in &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot; when characters speak about what they want to be reborn as in their next life.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
Most critics praised &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot; and appreciated its tone, although they agreed that the book started off slowly. The book was singled out as being beautifully written, and the plot, with its incorporation of Chinese myths, characters, and ancient figures, made the novel &quot;a fun read&quot;. However, those same side stories and myths could make the book confusing for some readers. The book used considerable comic relief even when there was a plague, the death of children, and what seemed to be an accidental attempt at murder.

The book series is currently under option to be adapted into a live-action film.

James Van Fleet was born in the Coytesville section of Fort Lee, New Jersey. His family then moved to Florida while he was an infant, and he grew up there. Van Fleet received his high school education at the Summerlin Institute in Bartow, Florida.

After graduating from Summerlin in 1911, Van Fleet received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. While he was a cadet at West Point, he was a member of the Army football team and was a standout fullback on the undefeated Army team of 1914. Van Fleet graduated in the famous West Point Class of 1915, which included so many future generals that it has been called &quot;the class the stars fell on&quot; (stars being the insignia of generals). Van Fleet&#x27;s classmates included Dwight D. Eisenhower and Omar Bradley, among many others.

==Career==
===Early career===
After graduation, Van Fleet was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Infantry Branch of the United States Army. He was assigned to a company of the 3rd Infantry Regiment at Plattsburgh, New York, where he served from 12 September to 1 October 1915. He then served at Madison Barracks, in Sacketts Harbor, New York, until 11 May 1916. The 3rd Infantry was then transferred to Eagle Pass, Texas, for service on the Mexican border until 8 October 1917, over six months after the American entry into World War I. During his time in Texas, Van Fleet was promoted twice, to first lieutenant on 1 July 1916, and to captain on May 15, 1917.

Van Fleet then transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he served as an instructor for provisional officers, 10 October 1917 to 22 March 1918; commanding Army Service Schools Detachment No. 2, to 6 April 1918; at Kansas City, Missouri, inspecting 7th Infantry Regiment, National Guard of Missouri, April 1 to 5; at Camp Forrest, Ga., Camp Wadsworth, S. C., and Camp Mills, Long Island, commanding a company of the 16th Machine Gun Battalion, from 10 April to 4 July 1918. He received a temporary promotion to major on 17 June 1918.

Van Fleet was then shipped to France, where he commanded the 17th Machine Gun Battalion, part of the 6th Division, from 12 September 1918 to 11 June 1919. He was wounded in action in the Meuse–Argonne offensive on 4 November 1918, just seven days before the Armistice with Germany which caused hostilities to cease.

===Interwar period===
After the war, Van Fleet was reduced to his permanent rank of captain in 1922 and promoted to major in the Regular Army in December 1924. While serving as the senior officer of the University of Florida&#x27;s U.S. Army Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) program, Van Fleet also served as the head coach of the Florida Gators football team in 1923 and 1924, after assisting William G. Kline for a year. He led the Gators into national prominence with a 12–3–4 (.737) record.

From 1924 to 1927 he was stationed at Camp Galliard in the Panama Canal Zone where he commanded the 1st Battalion of the 42nd Infantry. This assignment was followed by one at the Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia. At Fort Benning Van Fleet served as an instructor from April 1927 to September 1928 and as a student in the Advanced Course from September 1928 to June 1929. In addition to his other duties, Van Fleet served as head coach of the post&#x27;s football team. Van Fleet then returned to the University of Florida where he was the Professor of Military Science and Tactics from July 1929 to June 1933.

From July 1933 to July 1935 he was stationed at Fort Williams in Cape Elizabeth, Maine, where he served as commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 5th Infantry and also as the post&#x27;s executive officer. During this assignment, he oversaw the construction of a duck pond in the northwest corner of the parade field.

Unlike the majority of his fellow officers who rose to high command in the next few years, Van Fleet was unique in the sense that he never attended either the Command and Staff College or the Army War College during his military career.

===World War II===
Van Fleet commanded the 8th Infantry Regiment (part of the 4th Infantry Division) for three years (July 1941 to July 1944) and led it into combat in Europe in World War II, participating in the D-Day landings on Utah Beach in June 1944. On Utah Beach Van Fleet distinguished himself by outstanding combat leadership and was awarded his first Distinguished Service Cross (DSC).

Although widely regarded by many as an outstanding officer, he was blocked from promotion because the Army Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall, who had a tendency to forget and confuse names, erroneously confused Van Fleet with a well-known alcoholic officer with a similar name. When General Dwight D. Eisenhower, a former West Point classmate of Van Fleet&#x27;s and now the Supreme Allied Commander in Western Europe, informed Marshall of his mistake, Van Fleet was soon promoted to divisional and corps command.

Following promotion to brigadier general in August 1944, Van Fleet became the Assistant Division Commander of the 2nd Infantry Division (July to September 1944) and then briefly commanded the 4th Infantry Division (September to October 1944) before assuming command of the 90th &quot;Tough Ombres&quot; Infantry Division (October 1944 to February 1945) and gaining a promotion to major general in November. He gained the admiration and respect of his superiors, in particular Lieutenant General George S. Patton, commander of the Third Army, for his command of the 90th.

After briefly commanding XXIII Corps, on 17 March 1945 Van Fleet replaced Major General John Millikin as commander of III Corps where Millikin served with Patton&#x27;s Third Army. Van Fleet commanded III Corps through the end of the war and the occupation of Germany until returning to the United States in February 1946.

=== Germany and Greek Civil War ===
Van Fleet was reassigned to Governor&#x27;s Island, New York, as commander of the 2nd Service Command before becoming the Deputy Commanding General of the 1st United States Army in June 1946. In December 1947 he went to Frankfurt, Germany as G-3 (operations officer) of the United States European Command.

In February 1948, Van Fleet was promoted to lieutenant general and sent to Greece as the head of the Joint U.S. Military Advisory Group and executor of the &quot;Truman Doctrine&quot;. He was instrumental in the outcome of the Greek Civil War by providing advice to the Greek government and 250 military advisers, as well as administering $400 million in military aid. The central square in the northern Greek city of Kastoria has featured a bust of Van Fleet for many years, and was replaced with a new statue as recently as 2007.

Van Fleet was commanding general of the Second United States Army from 10 August 1950 to 11 April 1951.

===Korean War===
On 14 April 1951, Van Fleet arrived in Korea, replacing General Matthew B. Ridgway as commander of the U.S. Eighth Army and United Nations forces. Van Fleet was then promoted to four-star general on July 31, 1951. He commanded the Eighth United States Army.

In early 1951, Van Fleet proposed an amphibious landing at Wonsan, behind communist lines. The political fallout of MacArthur&#x27;s removal, however, persuaded Ridgway to veto the plan.

Van Fleet played a significant role in reorganizing the Republic of Korea Army and reestablishing the Korea Military Academy (KMA), which is now considered the top military academy in the country. Taking inspiration from his previous experiences, Van Fleet said he wished to do for the Republic of Korea (ROK) army &quot;the same as we did for the Greek divisions&quot;.

In October 1951, the ROK Army Chief of Staff proposed an academy with a four-year course modeled after West Point. They created a temporary site for this school at Jinhae-gu, and appointed three West Point graduates to oversee the program. They held an opening ceremony on 20 January 1952. The KMA was very popular among South Koreans, with ROK Army Chief of Staff Lee Jong-chan writing:The Korean Defense Ministry called Van Fleet the &quot;father of the Korean Army&quot; in 2015 for his contributions to the KMA and elsewhere. A statue of Van Fleet was erected on the KMA campus on 31 March 1960 to honor his contributions towards the academy.

In April 1952, Van Fleet&#x27;s son died while piloting a B-26 bomber over Haeju.

=== Activities after the Korean War ===
Van Fleet commanded the 8th Army until 11 February 1953, when he was relieved by General Maxwell Taylor. Before he left Korea, during a 19 January 1953 speech on the steps of the Korean Capitol Building, Van Fleet said, &quot;I shall come back. You have made me a part of you. I know you are a part of me. I shall not ask you to give me back my heart. I leave it with you.&quot;

He retired from the Army at the end of March at the age of 61.

He appeared on the 26 July 1953, episode of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;

Van Fleet made significant efforts to fundraise and advocate for Korea-US ties after the war. He was chairman of the American-Korean Foundation (AFK) in the 1950s. And in 1957, Van Fleet was one of five signers of the Certificate of Incorporation of The Korea Society, the first nonprofit organization in the United States dedicated to the promotion of friendly relations between the peoples of the United States and Korea.

In May 1962, he was invited by ROK President Park Chung Hee to visit Korea again. He returned to the US on June 1, 1962, and gave a speech called &quot;The Miracle on the Han&quot;, in which he said:

== Death ==
Van Fleet died in his sleep on his ranch outside Polk City, Florida, on 23 September 1992, six months after his 100th birthday that March. He was the oldest living general officer in the United States at the time of his death. Van Fleet and his wife Helen are buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Buried with them is Van Fleet&#x27;s second wife, Virginia, who died in 1986.

==Legacy==
At the time of his retirement from active duty on 31 March 1953, former President Harry S. Truman said, &quot;You want to know about a great general? There&#x27;s Van Fleet. I sent him to Greece and he won that war. I sent him to Korea and he won that war. He&#x27;s the greatest general we ever had.&quot; Van Fleet then allegedly replied &quot;Well actually Mr. President you never quite let me finish that last one&quot;.

Van Fleet was the recipient of three Distinguished Service Crosses, four Distinguished Service Medals, three Silver Stars, three Bronze Star Medals, three Purple Hearts for wounds received in combat, and his most prized decoration—the Combat Infantryman&#x27;s Badge (CIB) of the common foot soldier. 

Shortly after his death, The Korea Society established the annual James A. Van Fleet Award to recognize people who have made significant contributions to US-Korea ties.

The University of Florida presented Van Fleet an honorary doctorate in 1946, and the university&#x27;s military sciences building, which houses the U.S. Air Force, Army and Navy ROTC programs, is named Van Fleet Hall. He was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as an &quot;honorary letter winner&quot; in 1971. In 1998, a panel of Florida historians and other consultants named Van Fleet one of the fifty most important Floridians of the 20th century. The General James A. Van Fleet State Trail, running from Polk City to Mabel, Florida, is also named in his honor.

Van Fleet&#x27;s estate donated his papers to the George C. Marshall Foundation.

A statue honoring him was erected at the central square of the Greek city of Kastoria, which was the location of his advanced command post during the Greek Civil War. There is also a statue honoring him at the grounds of Korean Military Academy, in recognition of his support for the South Korean Army during the Korean War.

In June 2015, the ROK issued a stamp to honor in Van Fleet&#x27;s honor. In Fall 2015, the ROK Ministry of Defense awarded him the Paik Sun Yup ROK-US Alliance Award.

== Personal life ==
Van Fleet and his wife, Helen Moore Van Fleet, had three children, eight grandchildren, and twelve great-grandchildren. His only son, James Alward Van Fleet Jr., died during the Korean War.

Van Fleet was also an art collector and donated many rare and exceptional Asian objects to the Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art.

<doc id="573724" wikidata="Q33790" url="?curid=573724" title="Niuean language">
<text>Niuean (; ) is a Polynesian language, belonging to the Malayo-Polynesian subgroup of the Austronesian languages. It is most closely related to Tongan and slightly more distantly to other Polynesian languages such as Māori, Samoan, and Hawaiian. Together, Tongan and Niuean form the Tongic subgroup of the Polynesian languages. Niuean also has a number of influences from Samoan and Eastern Polynesian languages.

== Speakers ==
Niuean was spoken by 1,600 people on Niue Island (97.4% of the inhabitants) in 1991, as well as by speakers in the Cook Islands, New Zealand, and Tonga, for a total of around 8,000 speakers. There are thus more speakers of Niuean outside the island itself than on the island. Most inhabitants of Niue are bilingual in English.

In the early 1990s, 70% of the speakers of Niuean lived in New Zealand.

== Dialects ==
Niuean consists of two main dialects, the older Motu dialect from the north of the island and the Tafiti dialect of the south. The words mean, respectively, &quot;the people of the island&quot; and &quot;the strangers&quot; (or &quot;people from a distance&quot;).

The differences between the dialects are mainly in vocabulary or in the form of some words.

Examples of differences in vocabulary are volu (Tafiti) vs matā (Motu) for &quot;scrape, scraper&quot; and lala (Tafiti) vs kautoga (Motu) for &quot;guava (plant)&quot;; examples of differences in form include hafule (T) / afule (M), aloka/haloka, nai/nei, ikiiki/likiliki, and malona/maona.

== Phonology ==
 is an allophone of before front vowels (both long and short and ); this most likely arose from the affrication of to before these vowels and subsequent change of to . While older foreign borrowings (such as from English &#x27;tea&#x27;) underwent this change along with (or perhaps by analogy with) native words, words borrowed into Niuean after this development retain the original (for example, and from &#x27;telephone&#x27; and &#x27;degree&#x27;).

 and are marginal phonemes, only appearing in foreign borrowings. Some speakers substitute and , respectively.

=== Vowels ===

Vowel length is distinctive in Niuean; vowels are either long or short. Furthermore, two adjacent identical vowels (whether short-short, short-long, long-short, or long-long) form a rearticulated vowel; the sound is distinct from one long vowel.

Both short and long vowels can occur in any position.

All short vowels may combine with one another to form diphthongs. The possible diphthongs are outlined in the table below.

=== Hiatus ===
Hiatus is the separate pronunciation of two adjacent vowels, as opposed to diphthongs, which are written as two letters but pronounced as one sound. These two vowels may be the same or be different ones.

Hiatus typically occurs across morpheme boundaries, such as when a prefix ending with a vowel comes before a root beginning with that same vowel. It may also occur, rarely, within monomorphemic words (words that consist of only one morpheme) as a result of the elision of a historical intervocalic consonant.

Two adjacent identical short vowels are always pronounced separately, as are combinations of any two long vowels or a short and a long vowel; two adjacent different short vowels may undergo hiatus or form a diphthong. This must be determined from the morphology or etymology of the word.

=== Syllable structure ===
The basic structure of a Niuean syllable is (C)V(V); all syllables end in a vowel or diphthong, and may start with at most one consonant. Consonant clusters in borrowed words are broken up with epenthetic vowels, e.g. English &#x27;tractor&#x27; becomes .

=== Stress ===
The stress on a Niuean word is nearly always on the penult (second-to-last syllable), though multi-syllable words ending in a long vowel put primary stress on the final long vowel and secondary stress on the penult. Long vowels in other positions also attract a secondary stress.

=== Glottal stop ===
The Niuean language does not contain the glottal stop, which is present in its closest relative, Tongan. This has caused some distinct words to merge. For example, Tongan (&#x27;year&#x27;) and (&#x27;fight&#x27;) have merged in Niuean as (&#x27;year; fight&#x27;).

== Orthography ==
Niuean orthography is largely phonemic; that is, one letter stands for one sound and &quot;vice versa&quot;.

=== Alphabet ===
The traditional alphabet order, given with the traditional names of the letters, is ā, ē, ī, ō, ū, fā, gā, hā, kā, lā, mō, nū, pī, tī, vī, rō, sā. Note that rō and sā as introduced letters are ordered at the end.

Sperlich (1997) uses an alphabetical order based on English for his dictionary: a, ā, e, ē, f, g, h, i, ī, k, l, m, n, o, ō, p, s, t, u, ū, v (r is left out since no words start with this letter). He recommends that consonants be named consistently with a following ā: fā, gā, hā, kā, lā, mā, nā, pā, tā, vā, rā, sā.

Vowel length can be marked with a macron; however, this is not always done.

=== History ===
As with many languages, writing was brought to Niue in connection with religion, in this case with Christianity by missionaries educated in Samoa. This has led to some Samoan influences in morphology and grammar and also to a noticeable one in spelling: as in Samoan, the sound () is written g, rather than ng as in Tongan and some other Polynesian languages with this sound. (McEwen (1970) uses ng in his dictionary; however, this feature of his spelling was not popular, particularly since it conflicted with the spelling used in the Niuean Bible.)

== Grammar ==
=== Typology ===
Niuean can be considered a VSO language; however, one analysis of Niuean uses ergative terminology, in which case it may be better to speak of verb–agent–patient word order.

Because the unmarked case is the absolutive, Niuean transitive verb constructions often appear passive in a literal translation.

Compare:



The first example sentence could also be translated into English as the nominative–accusative construction &quot;He saw the crab&quot;.

=== Pronouns ===
Niuean pronouns are differentiated by person and number. Furthermore, first person non-singular (dual and plural) pronouns distinguish inclusive and exclusive forms, including and excluding the listener, respectively. However, they are not differentiated by gender or case; for example, ia means both &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot;, &quot;him&quot; and &quot;her&quot; (inanimates [&#x27;it&#x27;] are not usually pronominalised).

Note that the endings of the dual and plural forms resemble the numbers 2 and 3, ua and tolu.

=== Numbers ===
Some numbers in Niuean are:

(*Note: Both McEwen (1970) and Sperlich (1997) give fā for four; however, Kaulima &amp; Beaumont (1994) give fa with a short vowel.)

Tens and ones combine with ma, e.g. hogofulu ma taha, 11; tolugofulu ma ono, 36.

The numbers from one to nine (and occasionally higher numbers) can take the prefix toko- when used to count persons; for example, tokolima &quot;five (for people)&quot;.

Numbers are used as verbs, for example:


or


or


=== Morphology ===
Morphology comprises the ways in which words are built up from smaller, meaningful sub-units, or how words change their form in certain circumstances.

==== Suppletion ====
Suppletion concerns closely related words (often singular and plural forms of nouns or verbs) which are based on very different forms, for example fano &quot;to go&quot; (used with a singular subject) and ō &quot;to go&quot; (used with a plural subject). This can be compared to English &quot;go&quot; and &quot;went&quot;, which are forms of the same verb yet differ in form.

==== Reduplication ====
Reduplication is frequently used in Niuean morphology to derive different nouns. Reduplication is the process of taking the entire morpheme, or sometimes only the first or last syllable or two, and repeating it.

This is used for several purposes, including:

*forming a &quot;plural&quot; verb from a &quot;singular&quot; one (that is, a verb form used when the subject is plural, as opposed to the form used when the subject is singular)
*forming a &quot;frequentative&quot; form of a verb (an action that is carried out several times)

An example of a whole-morpheme reduplication indicating a plural verb is molemole &quot;to have passed by, to be gone&quot; from mole &quot;to have passed by, to be gone&quot;; an example of a whole-morpheme reduplication indicating a frequentative verb is molomolo &quot;to keep squeezing&quot; from molo &quot;to squeeze, to compress&quot;.

Examples of part-morpheme reduplication are gagau &quot;to bite&quot; from gau &quot;to chew&quot; (first part of the syllable reduplicated), gegele &quot;to make a crying sound&quot; from gele &quot;to start to cry (of babies&quot;) (first syllable reduplicated), and molūlū &quot;to be very soft, to be very weak&quot; from molū &quot;to be soft, to be weak&quot; (last syllable reduplicated).

Reduplication is also frequently employed together with affixes.

==== Affixes ====
Affixes (prefixes and suffixes) are frequently used for a variety of purposes; there is also one circumfix, fe- -aki (sometimes fe- -naki or fe- -taki), which is used to form reciprocal verbs (&quot;to ... one another&quot;).

A common suffix is -aga, which is a nominaliser: it forms nouns from verbs.

A common prefix with faka-, with a variety of meanings, the most common being a causative one (e.g. ako &quot;to learn&quot;, fakaako &quot;to teach&quot;).

Words may also have more than one prefix or suffix, as fakamalipilipi &quot;to break&quot; (used with a plural object), from faka-, ma-, and a reduplicated lipi &quot;to break&quot;.

==== Compound words ====
Many words are simply formed by joining together other words, for example vakalele &quot;aeroplane&quot; from vaka &quot;canoe&quot; and lele &quot;fly&quot; (i.e. literally, &quot;flying canoe&quot;). Diane Massam has extensively studied a special type of compounding which she has termed pseudo noun incorporation, a type of noun incorporation.

<text>Jim Knopf, nicknamed Jim Button (&quot;Knopf&quot; meaning &quot;button&quot; in German) (October 20, 1942 – October 1, 2013), was considered by many to be one of the &quot;fathers&quot; of shareware (so named by fellow software veteran Peter Norton). As an IBM employee, he wrote a program to help with a local church congregation. When demand for his program consumed too much of his time, he quit IBM and created Buttonware. He released his first program, PC-File (a flat file database), in late 1982 as &quot;user supported software&quot;. He has been quoted as saying this expression not only reflected the optional payment model, but also that comments from users drove the development of later releases.

He collaborated with PC-Talk (communications software) developer Andrew Fluegelman to adopt similar names (PC-File was originally &quot;Easy-File&quot;), and prices, for their initial shareware offerings; they also agreed to mention each other&#x27;s products in their program&#x27;s documentation. Fluegelman referred to this distribution method as &quot;freeware&quot;.

A few months later (early 1983), Bob Wallace followed suit, coining the term &quot;shareware&quot; for his similarly marketed product, PC-Write, a word processor.

Knopf had a near-death experience in 1992, when his heart stopped beating briefly while experiencing a heart attack. Shortly thereafter, he sold all his business assets and retired to the Pacific Northwest. He died on October 1, 2013, after suffering for several years from heart disease and Crohn&#x27;s disease.
