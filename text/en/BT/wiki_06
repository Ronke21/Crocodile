<text>Daniel Okrent (born April 2, 1948) is an American writer and editor. He is best known for having served as the first public editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; newspaper, inventing Rotisserie League Baseball, and for writing several books (such as &quot;Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition&quot;, which served as a major source for the 2011 Ken Burns/Lynn Novick miniseries &quot;Prohibition)&quot;. In November 2011, &quot;Last Call&quot; won the Albert J. Beveridge prize, awarded by the American Historical Association to the year&#x27;s best book of American history. His most recent book, published May 2019, is &quot;The Guarded Gate: Bigotry, Eugenics, and the Law That Kept Two Generations of Jews, Italians, and Other European Immigrants Out of America&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Born to a Jewish family in Detroit, Michigan, Okrent graduated from Cass Technical High School in Detroit in 1965 and from the University of Michigan, where he worked on the university&#x27;s student newspaper &quot;The Michigan Daily&quot;.

==Career==
Most of his career has been spent as an editor, at such places as Alfred A. Knopf; Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich; &quot;Esquire Magazine&quot;; &quot;New England Monthly&quot;; &quot;Life Magazine&quot;; and Time, Inc.

His book &quot;Great Fortune: The Epic of Rockefeller Center&quot; (Viking, 2003) was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for History.

In October 2003, Okrent was named public editor for &quot;The New York Times&quot; following the Jayson Blair scandal. He held this position until May 2005.

Okrent and Peter Gethers, having acquired the theatrical rights to the site and name of the web series &quot;Old Jews Telling Jokes&quot;, co-wrote and co-produced a revue of that name. It opened at the Westside Theatre in Manhattan on May 20, 2012.

From 2003-2008, he was chairman of the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery. He has been awarded honorary degrees by the University of Michigan and the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts.

Since 2017, Okrent has been listed on the Advisory Board of the Secular Coalition for America.

== Okrent&#x27;s law ==

Okrent formulated what has become known as &quot;Okrent&#x27;s law&quot; in an interview comment he made about his new job. It states: &quot;The pursuit of balance can create imbalance because sometimes something is true&quot;, referring to the phenomenon of the press providing legitimacy to unsupported fringe viewpoints in an effort to appear even-handed.

==Baseball==
Okrent invented Rotisserie League Baseball, the best-known form of fantasy baseball, in 1979. The name comes from the fact that he proposed the idea to his friends while dining at La Rôtisserie Française restaurant on New York City&#x27;s East 52nd Street. Okrent&#x27;s team in the Rotisserie League was called the &quot;Okrent Fenokees&quot;, a pun on the Okefenokee Swamp. He was one of the first two people inducted into the Fantasy Sports Hall of Fame. Okrent was still playing Rotisserie as of 2009 under the team name Dan Druffs. Despite having been credited with inventing fantasy baseball he has never been able to win a Rotisserie League. His exploits of inventing Rotisserie League Baseball were chronicled in &quot;Silly Little Game&quot;, part of the ESPN &quot;30 for 30&quot; documentary series, in 2010.

Okrent is also credited with inventing the baseball stat, WHIP. At the time he referred to it as IPRAT, signifying &quot;Innings Pitched Ratio&quot;.

In May 1981, Okrent wrote and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; published &quot;He Does It by the Numbers&quot;. This profile of the then-unknown Bill James launched James&#x27;s career as baseball&#x27;s foremost analyst.

In 1994, Okrent was filmed for his in-depth knowledge of baseball history for the Ken Burns documentary &quot;Baseball&quot;. During the nine-part series, a red-sweater-wearing Okrent delivered a detailed analysis of the cultural aspects of the national pastime, including a comparison of the dramatic Game 6 of the 1975 World Series between the Boston Red Sox and Cincinnati Reds to the conflict and character development in Russian novels.

==The death of print==
In the late 1990s, as editor of new media at Time Inc., Okrent wrote about the future of magazine publishing. He believed that the advancement of digital technologies would make it easier for people to read newspapers, magazines and books online. In late 1999, Okrent made a prediction about the future of print media in the Hearst New Media Lecture at the Graduate School of Journalism of Columbia University. He told his audience:

<text>Julius Blank (June 2, 1925 – September 17, 2011) was an American semiconductor pioneer. A member of the traitorous eight, he left Nobel-winning physicist William Shockley&#x27;s company to form Fairchild Semiconductor.

== Early life and education ==
Blank was born and raised in Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side, the youngest of three children of Jewish immigrants Charles and Gussie Blank. His father made musical-instrument cases and luggage, and also worked as a Russian translator.

Julius Blank attended Erasmus Hall High School, graduating at 15. He began taking classes at City College of New York while working at various jobs. His first job, in a factory, motivated him to learn more, and he attended a trade school as well.

When he turned 18, he was drafted to serve in the U.S. Army in World War II. He reported for active duty on July 5, 1943. After basic infantry training, he was placed in the Army Specialized Training Program. In April 1944, he was sent overseas, where he was injured in December 1944 during the Battle of Hürtgen Forest. He was subsequently transferred to the Air Corps to serve as a machinist for airplane parts to overhaul radial engines. He held a variety of positions during the war, gaining considerable experience in the practicalities of general engineering.

In 1946 he returned home, where he completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering from the City College of New York, financed by the G.I. Bill.

== Career ==

Blank worked as an engineer at Babcock &amp; Wilcox in Barberton, Ohio, from 1950 to 1951, making large steam boilers for the power industry. He then moved to Goodyear Aircraft, where he worked from 1951 to 1952 on a wide variety of research and design projects including aircraft propulsion, air ship fabrics, parachutes, and submarines.

Because his wife Ethel wanted to move back to New York, they returned there in 1952. After their return, Blank found a job in manufacturing engineering at Western Electric in Kearny, New Jersey where he worked from 1952 to 1956. At Western Electric he worked on No. 4 toll crossbar switching equipment, used in the first dialing systems for connecting calls automatically without a human long-distance operator. One of the pieces of equipment involved was a card translator with an array of germanium photo transistors that routed calls in the switching system. Blank also worked as a troubleshooter for a plating room, where he gained practical experience in metal finishing and the use of acids and chemicals.

=== Shockley Semiconductor===
Two of the people Blank worked with at Western Electric were Dean Knapic and Eugene Kleiner. Knapic was approached by William Shockley to form an engineering group at the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory division of Beckman Instruments, in California. Knapic recommended Blank and Kleiner, who were interviewed by Shockley in a restaurant at Newark Airport, between flights. In April 1956, Blank joined Shockley Semiconductor, followed a couple of months later by Kleiner. Blank was a Senior Staff Engineer from 1956 to 1957. The Blanks lived initially in Palo Alto, California, moving to Los Altos Hills, California in 1966.

One of Blank&#x27;s first assignments at Shockley was to build a crystal grower. Shockley had a number of ideas about how to build a crystal grower so as to eliminate contamination from oxygen in the quartz, but the resulting equipment was elaborate and had several problems. Blank eventually built a conventional crystal grower based on the Czochralski process instead. Diffusion furnaces also had to be built, because existing laboratory furnaces did not meet the requirements of semiconductor production. They were too small, not well enough controlled, and not capable of being used for long periods of time. Vacuum evaporators for evaporating metals also needed to be more robust and readily controlled.

Blank worked at Shockley Semiconductor until he and others, later dubbed the &quot;traitorous eight&quot;, left to form the influential Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation. Blank indicated that he personally had not had problems with Shockley, but that Shockley&#x27;s treatment of others was disturbing. Management difficulties accelerated after Shockley won the Nobel Prize:

=== Fairchild Semiconductor ===
In August 1957 Julius Blank, Victor Grinich, Jean Hoerni, Eugene Kleiner, Jay Last, Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce and Sheldon Roberts reached an agreement with Sherman Fairchild of Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation. On September 18, 1957, they formed Fairchild Semiconductor.

Julius Blank found the company&#x27;s first home, a 14,000 square foot building at 844 Charleston Road, between Palo Alto and Mountain View. Little more than a shell, it lacked both plumbing and electricity. Kleiner and Blank were in charge of transforming the empty building into usable spaces for production, research and offices. In addition to mundane requirements like sewer and water, the work spaces required extra electrical power, air conditioning to afford some level of climate control during processing, and piping and venting of gases. Blank&#x27;s experience during the war and at Western Electric was helpful in dealing with these physical requirements. As they were readying the building itself, the founders were also ordering desks, lab benches and scientific equipment, and starting to build specialized equipment that they couldn&#x27;t order: crystal growers, diffusion furnaces, vacuum evaporators, and optical lithography equipment for mask-making. Everyone worked toward the goal of getting the business underway.

The group&#x27;s initial research had led to a breakthrough, the design of the integrated circuit (IC), or silicon &quot;chip&quot;. Much of the responsibility for learning how to mass-produce silicon chips, and building the machinery needed to do it, fell to Julius Blank and Eugene Kleiner as the only engineers in the group. At Fairchild, they were responsible for setting up the initial machine shop and assembly areas. What they were doing was fundamentally new: no one built the equipment that they needed. Blank and Kleiner were in charge of designing &quot;the first assembly line for the basic building blocks of the electronic world&quot;, silicon chips, &quot;from the ground up&quot;. &quot;A brilliant mechanical engineer&quot;, Blank designed everything from furnaces and crystal growers to optical alignment and assembly equipment.

Later on, as the semiconductor industry developed, it became easier to order equipment and materials. However, there continued to be an ongoing tension, trying to find robust equipment that could produce at high capacity.

As the company expanded, Blank&#x27;s role changed. He became responsible for establishing manufacturing facilities for the company in Hong Kong and other countries.

Blank was aware of the challenges of starting up a business in another country, both socially and physically.

Fairchild Semiconductor became a leader of the semiconductor industry. At Fairchild, Blank was part of the team that established a &quot;model for entrepreneurs for the rest of [the 20th] century&quot;: stock options, no job titles and open working relationships. The incubator of Silicon Valley, Fairchild was directly or indirectly involved in the creation of dozens of corporations such as AMD and Intel.

=== Consultancy ===
In 1969, Blank decided to leave Fairchild and become a consultant to new startup companies. He was the last of the original eight founding members to leave Fairchild.

In 1978, Blank co-founded Xicor, where he was a member of its board of directors. The company&#x27;s NOVRAM computer chip, a type of non-volatile memory, was designed so that systems could retain and save data in the event of power failure. In 2004, Xicor was acquired by Intersil Corp. for approximately US$529 million.

== Awards ==
In May, 2011, the California Historical Society in San Francisco gave the Legends of California Award to Blank, 85, and other founders of Fairchild Semiconductor.

== Later life ==
In 2011, Blank lived in a retirement center across the street from the old Fairchild headquarters at 844 Charleston Road in Palo Alto, where he used to have his office. The site is now a California Historical Landmark.

Blank died on September 17, 2011, in Los Altos Hills, California. His wife, Ethel, an art curator, had died previously in 2008 after nearly 60 years of marriage. He was survived by two sons, Jeffrey and David, and two grandsons.

<text>Carcosa is a fictional city in Ambrose Bierce&#x27;s short story &quot;An Inhabitant of Carcosa&quot; (1886). The ancient and mysterious city is barely described and is viewed only in hindsight (after its destruction) by a character who once lived there.

American writer Robert W. Chambers borrowed the name &quot;Carcosa&quot; for several of his short stories featured in the 1895 book &quot;The King in Yellow&quot;, inspiring generations of authors to similarly use Carcosa in their own works.

==&quot;The King in Yellow&quot;==
The city was later used more extensively in Robert W. Chambers&#x27; book of short stories published in 1895, titled &quot;The King in Yellow&quot;. Chambers had read Bierce&#x27;s work and borrowed a few additional names from his work, including Hali and Hastur.

In Chambers&#x27; stories, and within the apocryphal play titled &quot;The King in Yellow&quot;, which is mentioned several times within them, the city of Carcosa is a mysterious, ancient, and possibly cursed place. The most precise description of its location is the shores of Lake Hali, either on another planet, or in another universe.

For instance:
:
:—&quot;Cassilda&#x27;s Song&quot; in &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; Act 1, Scene 2

==Associated names==
&quot;Lake Hali&quot; is a misty lake found near the city of Hastur. In the fictional play &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; (obliquely described by author Robert W. Chambers in the collection of short stories of the same title), the mysterious cities of Alar and Carcosa stand beside the lake. Like Carcosa, it is referenced in the Cthulhu Mythos stories of H.P. Lovecraft and the authors who followed him.

The name Hali originated in Ambrose Bierce&#x27;s &quot;An Inhabitant of Carcosa&quot; (1886) in which Hali is the author of a quote which prefaces the story. The narrator of the story implies that the person named Hali is now dead (at least in the timeline of the story).

Several other nearly undescribed places are alluded to in Chambers&#x27; writing, among them Hastur, Yhtill, and Aldebaran. &quot;Aldebaran&quot; may refer to the star Aldebaran, likely as it is also associated with the mention of the Hyades star cluster, with which it shares space in the night sky. The Yellow Sign, described as a symbol, not of any human script, is supposed to originate from the same place as Carcosa.

One other name associated is &quot;Demhe&quot; and its &quot;cloudy depths&quot; − this has never been explained either by Chambers or any famous pastiche-writer and so it is not known what exactly &quot;Demhe&quot; is.

Marion Zimmer Bradley (and Diana L. Paxson since Bradley&#x27;s death) also used the names &quot;Hali&quot; and &quot;Lake of Hali&quot; in her &quot;Darkover&quot; series.

==Other appearances==
===Written references===
Later writers, including H. P. Lovecraft and his many admirers, became admirers of Chambers&#x27; work and incorporated the names used by Chambers into their own stories, set in the Cthulhu Mythos. &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; and Carcosa have inspired many modern authors, including Karl Edward Wagner (&quot;The River of Night&#x27;s Dreaming&quot;), Joseph S. Pulver (&quot;Carl Lee &amp; Cassilda&quot;), Lin Carter, James Blish, Michael Cisco (&quot;He Will Be There&quot;), Ann K. Schwader, Robert M. Price, Galad Elflandsson, Simon Strantzas (&quot;Beyond the Banks of the River Seine&quot;), Charles Stross (in the &quot;Laundry Files&quot; series), Anders Fager and S. M. Stirling (in the &quot;Emberverse&quot; series).

Joseph S. Pulver has written nearly 30 tales and poems that are based on and/or include Carcosa, The King in Yellow, or other elements from Robert W. Chambers. Pulver also edited an anthology &quot;A Season in Carcosa&quot; of new tales based upon The King in Yellow, released by Miskatonic River Press in 2012.

John Scott Tynes contributed to the mythology of Chambers&#x27; Carcosa in a series of novellas, &quot;Broadalbin&quot;, &quot;Ambrose&quot;, and &quot;Sosostris&quot;, and essays in issue #1 of &quot;The Unspeakable Oath&quot; and in &quot;Delta Green&quot;.

In Paul Edwin Zimmer&#x27;s &quot;Dark Border&quot; series, Carcosa is a city where humans mingle with their nearly immortal allies, the Hastur.

In Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson&#x27;s &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot;, Carcosa is connected with an ancient civilization in the Gobi Desert, destroyed when the Illuminati arrived on Earth via flying saucers from the planet Vulcan.

In maps of the world of George R. R. Martin&#x27;s &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, a city named Carcosa is labeled on the easternmost edge of the map along the coast of a large lake, near other magical cities such as Asshai. In &quot;The World of Ice and Fire&quot;, it is mentioned that a sorcerer lord lives there who claims to be the sixty-ninth Yellow Emperor, from a dynasty fallen for a thousand years.

In the satirical novel &quot;Kamus of Kadizhar: The Black Hole of Carcosa&quot; by John Shirley (St. Martin&#x27;s Press, 1988), Carcosa is the name of a planet whose weird black hole physics figures in the story.

Swedish writer Anders Fager&#x27;s &quot;Miss Witt&#x27;s Great Work of Art&quot; features a Stockholm-based coterie known as &quot;The Carcosa Foundation&quot; that worships Hastur.

In David Drake&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Isles&quot; series, Carcosa is the name of the ancient capital of the old kingdom, which collapsed a thousand years before the events of the series.

In S.M. Stirling&#x27;s &quot;Emberverse&quot; series, Carcosa is the name of a South Pacific city inhabited by evil people led by the Yellow Raja and the Pallid Mask.

In Lawrence Watt-Evans&#x27; &quot;The Lords of Dûs&quot; series, a character known as the Forgotten King, who dresses in yellow rags, reveals that he was exiled from Carcosa.

In writer Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;Neonomicon&quot;, drawn by artist Jacen Burrowes, the character Johnny Carcosa is the key to a mystical Lovecraftian universe.

===Television===
In the HBO original series &quot;True Detective&quot;, &#x27;Carcosa&#x27; is presented as a man-made temple. Located in the backwoods of Louisiana, the temple serves as a place of ritualistic sexual abuse of children and child murder organized by a group of wealthy Louisiana politicians and church leaders. The main characters, Rust Cohle and Marty Hart, storm the temple in the final episode of the season, where they confront a serial killer, who is the most active member of the cult. It is understood that the cult worships the &quot;Yellow King&quot;, to whom an effigy is dedicated in the main chamber of &#x27;Carcosa&#x27;. The series hints at a larger conspiracy that continues beyond the show, which is in line with Lovecraftian horror, as is a vision experienced by one character that underscores Lovecraftian themes like cosmic indifference.

In Part 3 of the &quot;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&quot;, the barker of the traveling amusement park and carnival is named Carcosa, and the carnival in turn named, presumably, after him. Throughout the season of the show, it becomes apparent that the workers at the carnival are all mythological beings of old, with Carcosa himself being the god Pan, his true form being that of a satyr, in the show understood to be the god of madness. The arc of the season revolves partially around the attempts of the carnival workers to resurrect an older deity identified as The Green Man. Themes of madness, death, and resurrection parallel the works of Robert W. Chambers et al.

In the early 2000s, a Mysterious Package Company experience called &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; was introduced, heavily inspired by story and title. Later, a sequel experience entitled &quot;Carcosa: Rise of the Cult&quot; was created, obviously connected to this shared universe and connected to the original The King in Yellow.

In 2017, Fantasy Flight Games released an expansion for &quot;Arkham Horror: The Card Game&quot; titled &quot;The Path to Carcosa&quot; in which players investigate occurrences based on &quot;The King in Yellow&quot;.

Carcosa is mentioned in the song &quot;Strange and Eternal&quot; of the 2022 album Netherheaven by the American technical death metal band Revocation.

==Publishers using the name Carcosa==
Two different publishers have used the name Carcosa.

===Carcosa House===
Carcosa House was a science fiction specialty publishing firm formed in 1947 by Frederick B. Shroyer, a boyhood friend of T. E. Dikty, and two Los Angeles science fiction fans, Russell Hodgkins and Paul Skeeters. Shroyer had secured a copy of the original newspaper appearance of the novel &quot;Edison&#x27;s Conquest of Mars&quot; by Garrett P. Serviss which he wished to publish. Shroyer talked Hodgkins and Skeeters into going in on shares to form the publisher which issued the Serviss book in 1947. Dikty offered advice, and William L. Crawford of F.P.C.I. helped with production and distribution. Carcosa House announced one other book, &quot;Enter Ghost: A Study in Weird Fiction&quot;, by Sam Russell, but due to slow sales of the Serviss book, it was never published.

* &quot;Edison&#x27;s Conquest of Mars&quot;, by Garrett P. Serviss (1947)

===Carcosa===

Carcosa was a specialty publishing firm formed by David Drake, Karl Edward Wagner, and Jim Groce, who were concerned that Arkham House would cease publication after the death of its founder, August Derleth. Carcosa was founded in North Carolina in 1973 and put out four collections of pulp horror stories, all edited by Wagner. Their first book was a huge omnibus volume of the best non-series weird fiction by Manly Wade Wellman. It was enhanced by a group of chilling illustrations by noted fantasy artist Lee Brown Coye. Their other three volumes were also giant omnibus collections (of work by Hugh B. Cave, E. Hoffman Price, and again by Manly Wade Wellman). A fifth collection was planned, &quot;Death Stalks the Night,&quot; by Hugh B. Cave; Lee Brown Coye was working on illustrating it when he suffered a crippling stroke in 1977 and eventually died, causing Carcosa to abandon the project. The book was eventually published by Fedogan &amp; Bremer. Carcosa also had plans to issue volumes by Leigh Brackett, H. Warner Munn, and Jack Williamson; however, none of the projected volumes appeared. The Carcosa colophon depicts the silhouette of a towered city in front of three moons.

====Awards====
* 1976, World Fantasy Award, Special Award - Non-Professional to Karl Edward Wagner, David Drake &amp; Jim Groce for Carcosa.

====Works published by Carcosa====
* &quot;Worse Things Waiting&quot;, by Manly Wade Wellman (1973)
* &quot;Far Lands, Other Days&quot;, by E. Hoffmann Price (1975)
* &quot;Murgunstrumm and Others&quot;, by Hugh B. Cave (1977)

==Places called Carcosa==
In 1896–7, the Carcosa mansion was built as the official residence of the Resident-General of the Federated Malay States for the first holder of that office, Sir Frank Swettenham. It was in use as a luxury hotel, the Carcosa Seri Negara, from 1989 to 2015 and has been abandoned since then. Swettenham took the name from &quot;The King in Yellow&quot;.

In the Quebec-based geopolitical/live-action role-play game &quot;Bicolline&quot;, Carcosa is a kingdom in the west. It was established upon principles of freedom and is populated by pirates, nomads, escaped slaves, and religious exiles.

<text>In computer science and operations research, approximation algorithms are efficient algorithms that find approximate solutions to optimization problems (in particular NP-hard problems) with provable guarantees on the distance of the returned solution to the optimal one. Approximation algorithms naturally arise in the field of theoretical computer science as a consequence of the widely believed P ≠ NP conjecture. Under this conjecture, a wide class of optimization problems cannot be solved exactly in polynomial time. The field of approximation algorithms, therefore, tries to understand how closely it is possible to approximate optimal solutions to such problems in polynomial time. In an overwhelming majority of the cases, the guarantee of such algorithms is a multiplicative one expressed as an approximation ratio or approximation factor i.e., the optimal solution is always guaranteed to be within a (predetermined) multiplicative factor of the returned solution. However, there are also many approximation algorithms that provide an additive guarantee on the quality of the returned solution. A notable example of an approximation algorithm that provides &quot;both&quot; is the classic approximation algorithm of Lenstra, Shmoys and Tardos for scheduling on unrelated parallel machines.

The design and analysis of approximation algorithms crucially involves a mathematical proof certifying the quality of the returned solutions in the worst case. This distinguishes them from heuristics such as annealing or genetic algorithms, which find reasonably good solutions on some inputs, but provide no clear indication at the outset on when they may succeed or fail.

There is widespread interest in theoretical computer science to better understand the limits to which we can approximate certain famous optimization problems. For example, one of the long-standing open questions in computer science is to determine whether there is an algorithm that outperforms the 2-approximation for the Steiner Forest problem by Agrawal et al. The desire to understand hard optimization problems from the perspective of approximability is motivated by the discovery of surprising mathematical connections and broadly applicable techniques to design algorithms for hard optimization problems. One well-known example of the former is the Goemans–Williamson algorithm for maximum cut, which solves a graph theoretic problem using high dimensional geometry.

== Introduction ==
A simple example of an approximation algorithm is one for the minimum vertex cover problem, where the goal is to choose the smallest set of vertices such that every edge in the input graph contains at least one chosen vertex. One way to find a vertex cover is to repeat the following process: find an uncovered edge, add both its endpoints to the cover, and remove all edges incident to either vertex from the graph. As any vertex cover of the input graph must use a distinct vertex to cover each edge that was considered in the process (since it forms a matching), the vertex cover produced, therefore, is at most twice as large as the optimal one. In other words, this is a constant-factor approximation algorithm with an approximation factor of 2. Under the recent unique games conjecture, this factor is even the best possible one.

NP-hard problems vary greatly in their approximability; some, such as the knapsack problem, can be approximated within a multiplicative factor formula_1, for any fixed formula_2, and therefore produce solutions arbitrarily close to the optimum (such a family of approximation algorithms is called a polynomial-time approximation scheme or PTAS). Others are impossible to approximate within any constant, or even polynomial, factor unless P = NP, as in the case of the maximum clique problem. Therefore, an important benefit of studying approximation algorithms is a fine-grained classification of the difficulty of various NP-hard problems beyond the one afforded by the theory of NP-completeness. In other words, although NP-complete problems may be equivalent (under polynomial-time reductions) to each other from the perspective of exact solutions, the corresponding optimization problems behave very differently from the perspective of approximate solutions.

==Algorithm design techniques==
By now there are several established techniques to design approximation algorithms. These include the following ones.
# Greedy algorithm
# Local search
# Enumeration and dynamic programming (which is also often used for parameterized approximations)
# Solving a convex programming relaxation to get a fractional solution. Then converting this fractional solution into a feasible solution by some appropriate rounding. The popular relaxations include the following.
#* Linear programming relaxations
#* Semidefinite programming relaxations
# Primal-dual methods
# Dual fitting
# Embedding the problem in some metric and then solving the problem on the metric. This is also known as metric embedding.
# Random sampling and the use of randomness in general in conjunction with the methods above.

== A posteriori guarantees ==
While approximation algorithms always provide an a priori worst case guarantee (be it additive or multiplicative), in some cases they also provide an a posteriori guarantee that is often much better. This is often the case for algorithms that work by solving a convex relaxation of the optimization problem on the given input. For example, there is a different approximation algorithm for minimum vertex cover that solves a linear programming relaxation to find a vertex cover that is at most twice the value of the relaxation. Since the value of the relaxation is never larger than the size of the optimal vertex cover, this yields another 2-approximation algorithm. While this is similar to the a priori guarantee of the previous approximation algorithm, the guarantee of the latter can be much better (indeed when the value of the LP relaxation is far from the size of the optimal vertex cover).

== Hardness of approximation ==
Approximation algorithms as a research area is closely related to and informed by inapproximability theory where the non-existence of efficient algorithms with certain approximation ratios is proved (conditioned on widely believed hypotheses such as the P ≠ NP conjecture) by means of reductions. In the case of the metric traveling salesman problem, the best known inapproximability result rules out algorithms with an approximation ratio less than 123/122 ≈ 1.008196 unless P = NP, Karpinski, Lampis, Schmied. Coupled with the knowledge of the existence of Christofides&#x27; 1.5 approximation algorithm, this tells us that the threshold of approximability for metric traveling salesman (if it exists) is somewhere between 123/122 and 1.5.

While inapproximability results have been proved since the 1970s, such results were obtained by ad hoc means and no systematic understanding was available at the time. It is only since the 1990 result of Feige, Goldwasser, Lovász, Safra and Szegedy on the inapproximability of Independent Set and the famous PCP theorem, that modern tools for proving inapproximability results were uncovered. The PCP theorem, for example, shows that Johnson&#x27;s 1974 approximation algorithms for Max SAT, set cover, independent set and coloring all achieve the optimal approximation ratio, assuming P ≠ NP.

== Practicality ==

Not all approximation algorithms are suitable for direct practical applications. Some involve solving non-trivial linear programming/semidefinite relaxations (which may themselves invoke the ellipsoid algorithm), complex data structures, or sophisticated algorithmic techniques, leading to difficult implementation issues or improved running time performance (over exact algorithms) only on impractically large inputs. Implementation and running time issues aside, the guarantees provided by approximation algorithms may themselves not be strong enough to justify their consideration in practice. Despite their inability to be used &quot;out of the box&quot; in practical applications, the ideas and insights behind the design of such algorithms can often be incorporated in other ways in practical algorithms. In this way, the study of even very expensive algorithms is not a completely theoretical pursuit as they can yield valuable insights.

In other cases, even if the initial results are of purely theoretical interest, over time, with an improved understanding, the algorithms may be refined to become more practical. One such example is the initial PTAS for Euclidean TSP by Sanjeev Arora (and independently by Joseph Mitchell) which had a prohibitive running time of formula_3 for a formula_4 approximation. Yet, within a year these ideas were incorporated into a near-linear time formula_5 algorithm for any constant formula_2.

== Structure of approximation algorithms ==
Given an optimization problem:

formula_7

where formula_8 is an approximation problem, formula_9 the set of inputs and formula_10 the set of solutions, we can define the cost function:

formula_11

and the set of feasible solutions:

formula_12

finding the best solution formula_13 for a maximization or a minimization problem:

formula_14, formula_15

Given a feasible solution formula_16, with formula_17, we would want a guarantee of the quality of the solution, which is a performance to be guaranteed (approximation factor).

Specifically, having formula_18, the algorithm has an approximation factor (or approximation ratio) of formula_19 if formula_20, we have:

* for a &quot;minimization&quot; problem: formula_21, which in turn means the solution taken by the algorithm divided by the optimal solution achieves a ratio of formula_19;
* for a &quot;maximization&quot; problem: formula_23, which in turn means the optimal solution divided by the solution taken by the algorithm achieves a ratio of formula_19;

The approximation can be proven &quot;tight&quot; (&quot;tight approximation&quot;) by demonstrating that there exist instances where the algorithm performs at the approximation limit, indicating the tightness of the bound. In this case, it&#x27;s enough to construct an input instance designed to force the algorithm into a worst-case scenario.

== Performance guarantees ==
For some approximation algorithms it is possible to prove certain properties about the approximation of th.e optimum result. For example, a &quot;ρ&quot;-approximation algorithm &quot;A&quot; is defined to be an algorithm for which it has been proven that the value/cost, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), of the approximate solution &quot;A&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) to an instance &quot;x&quot; will not be more (or less, depending on the situation) than a factor &quot;ρ&quot; times the value, OPT, of an optimum solution.

:formula_25

The factor &quot;ρ&quot; is called the &quot;relative performance guarantee&quot;. An approximation algorithm has an &quot;absolute performance guarantee&quot; or &quot;bounded error&quot; &quot;c&quot;, if it has been proven for every instance &quot;x&quot; that

:formula_26

Similarly, the &quot;performance guarantee&quot;, &quot;R&quot;(&quot;x,y&quot;), of a solution &quot;y&quot; to an instance &quot;x&quot; is defined as

:formula_27

where &quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) is the value/cost of the solution &quot;y&quot; for the instance &quot;x&quot;. Clearly, the performance guarantee is greater than or equal to 1 and equal to 1 if and only if &quot;y&quot; is an optimal solution. If an algorithm &quot;A&quot; guarantees to return solutions with a performance guarantee of at most &quot;r&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), then &quot;A&quot; is said to be an &quot;r&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)-approximation algorithm and has an &quot;approximation ratio&quot; of &quot;r&quot;(&quot;n&quot;). Likewise, a problem with an &quot;r&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)-approximation algorithm is said to be r&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)&quot;-&quot;approximable&quot; or have an approximation ratio of &quot;r&quot;(&quot;n&quot;).

For minimization problems, the two different guarantees provide the same result and that for maximization problems, a relative performance guarantee of ρ is equivalent to a performance guarantee of formula_28. In the literature, both definitions are common but it is clear which definition is used since, for maximization problems, as ρ ≤ 1 while r ≥ 1.

The &quot;absolute performance guarantee&quot; formula_29 of some approximation algorithm &quot;A&quot;, where &quot;x&quot; refers to an instance of a problem, and where formula_30 is the performance guarantee of &quot;A&quot; on &quot;x&quot; (i.e. ρ for problem instance &quot;x&quot;) is:

:formula_31

That is to say that formula_29 is the largest bound on the approximation ratio, &quot;r&quot;, that one sees over all possible instances of the problem. Likewise, the &quot;asymptotic performance ratio&quot; formula_33 is:

:formula_34

That is to say that it is the same as the &quot;absolute performance ratio&quot;, with a lower bound &quot;n&quot; on the size of problem instances. These two types of ratios are used because there exist algorithms where the difference between these two is significant.

== Epsilon terms ==
In the literature, an approximation ratio for a maximization (minimization) problem of &quot;c&quot; - ϵ (min: &quot;c&quot; + ϵ) means that the algorithm has an approximation ratio of &quot;c&quot; ∓ ϵ for arbitrary ϵ &gt; 0 but that the ratio has not (or cannot) be shown for ϵ = 0. An example of this is the optimal inapproximability — inexistence of approximation — ratio of 7 / 8 + ϵ for satisfiable MAX-3SAT instances due to Johan Håstad. As mentioned previously, when &quot;c&quot; = 1, the problem is said to have a polynomial-time approximation scheme.

An ϵ-term may appear when an approximation algorithm introduces a multiplicative error and a constant error while the minimum optimum of instances of size &quot;n&quot; goes to infinity as &quot;n&quot; does. In this case, the approximation ratio is &quot;c&quot; ∓ &quot;k&quot; / OPT = &quot;c&quot; ∓ o(1) for some constants &quot;c&quot; and &quot;k&quot;. Given arbitrary ϵ &gt; 0, one can choose a large enough &quot;N&quot; such that the term &quot;k&quot; / OPT &lt; ϵ for every &quot;n ≥ N&quot;. For every fixed ϵ, instances of size &quot;n &lt; N&quot; can be solved by brute force, thereby showing an approximation ratio — existence of approximation algorithms with a guarantee — of &quot;c&quot; ∓ ϵ for every ϵ &gt; 0.

==Early life==
The Sabri brothers learned music from their father, Inayat Hussain Sabri. He trained his sons in qawwali and Indian classical music. Their family came from a musical background, and claimed direct descent from Mian Tansen, who had played at the court of the 16th-century Mughal emperor Akbar. Mehboob Baksh Ranji Ali Rang, their paternal grandfather, was a master musician of his time; Baqar Hussein Khan, their maternal grandfather, was a unique sitarist. Ghulam Farid Sabri, Kamal Ahmed Sabri, Maqbool Ahmed Sabri and Mehmood Ghaznavi Sabri furthered their knowledge of music under Ustad Fatehdin Khan, Ustad Ramzan Khan, and Ustad Latafat Hussein Khan Rampuri. They also furthered their knowledge of poetry under Hazrat Hairat Ali Shah Warsi, who was their mother&#x27;s spiritual master.

Ghulam Farid Sabri&#x27;s first public performance was at the annual Urs festival of Mubarak Shah in Kalyana (now in Haryana, India) in 1946. He had joined Ustad Kallan Khan&#x27;s qawwali party in India. The family moved from Kalyana to Karachi, Pakistan following the Partition of India in 1947. In Pakistan, a wealthy businessman approached him and offered him a partnership in a nightclub, yet Ghulam Farid&#x27;s reply was that he only wanted to sing qawwali, and he rejected the offer.

Maqbool Ahmed Sabri also showed musical talent from a young age, which was noticed by his school teacher who later asked Maqbool&#x27;s father to further instruct him and guide him in the field of music. In 1955, when Maqbool was eleven years old, his brother-in-law got him a job singing at a theater in Karachi where he gave his first public performance. Later, with the help of his father, Maqbool formed a qawwali group at the age of eleven and named it Bacha Qawwal Party. The group&#x27;s first public performance was in 1956 at an Urs ceremony held at the home of Jameel Amrohi, where he sang &quot;Do Alam Ba Kakul Giraftar Daari&quot; in the presence of many qawwals.

Soon afterwards, after insistence by their father, Ghulam Farid Sabri joined him and became the leader of the ensemble, which was initially known as Ghulam Farid Sabri Qawwal &amp; Party. Afterwards, the name of the party was changed to Ghulam Farid Sabri – Maqbool Ahmed Sabri Qawwal &amp; Party. During their 1975 American tour, their promoter Beate Gordon suggested the band name was too long, so they changed it to The Sabri Brothers.

<text>The Manuscript Found in Saragossa (; also known in English as &quot;The Saragossa Manuscript&quot;) is a frame-tale novel written in French at the turn of 18th and 19th centuries by the Polish author Count Jan Potocki (1761–1815). It is narrated from the time of the Napoleonic Wars, and depicts events several decades earlier, during the reign of King Philip V (r. 1700–46).

The novel was adapted into a 1965 Polish-language film, &quot;The Saragossa Manuscript&quot; (), by director Wojciech Has, with Zbigniew Cybulski as Alfonse van Worden.

From May 2024, a manuscript covering Days 41–51 of the novel is presented at a permanent exhibition in the Palace of the Commonwealth in Warsaw.

== Plot summary ==
&quot;The Manuscript Found in Saragossa&quot; collects intertwining stories, all of them set in whole or in part in Spain, with a large and colorful cast of Romani, thieves, inquisitors, a cabbalist, a geometer, the cabbalist&#x27;s beautiful sister, two Moorish princesses (Emina and Zubeida) and others that the brave, perhaps foolhardy, Walloon Guard Alphonse van Worden meets, imagines or reads about in the Sierra Morena mountains of 18th-century Spain while en route to Madrid. Recounted to the narrator over the course of sixty-six days, the novel&#x27;s stories quickly overshadow van Worden&#x27;s frame story. The bulk of the stories revolve around the Romani chief Avadoro, whose story becomes a frame story itself. Eventually the narrative focus moves again toward van Worden&#x27;s frame story and a conspiracy involving an underground Muslim society, revealing the connections and correspondences between the hundred or so stories told over the novel&#x27;s sixty-six days.

== Analysis ==
The stories cover a wide range of genres and subjects, including the gothic, the picaresque, the erotic, the historical, the moral and the philosophic; and as a whole, the novel reflects Potocki&#x27;s far-ranging interests, especially his deep fascination with secret societies, the supernatural and &quot;Oriental&quot; cultures. The novel&#x27;s stories-within-stories sometimes reach several levels of depth, and characters and themes — a few prominent themes being honor, disguise, metamorphosis and conspiracy — recur and change shape throughout. Because of its rich and varied interlocking structure, the novel has been favorably compared to many celebrated literary antecedents such as the ancient BCE &quot;Jatakas&quot; and &quot;Panchatantra&quot; as well as the medieval &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; and &quot;Decameron&quot;.

== Textual history ==
The first &quot;days&quot; of &quot;The Manuscript Found in Saragossa&quot; were initially published apart from the rest of the novel in 1805, while the stories comprising the Gypsy chief&#x27;s tale were added later. The novel was written incrementally and was left in its final form—though never exactly completed—at the time of the author&#x27;s suicide in 1815.

Potocki composed the book entirely in French. Sections of the original French-language manuscripts were later lost, but have been back-translated into French from a Polish translation that had been made in 1847 by Edmund Chojecki from a complete French-language copy, now lost.

The first integral French-language version of the work, based on several French-language manuscripts and on Chojecki&#x27;s 1847 Polish translation, was edited by René Radrizzani and published in 1989 by the renowned French publishing house of José Corti.

Translations of the novel from the French rely, for the missing sections, on Chojecki&#x27;s Polish translation. The most recent English-language edition, published by Penguin Books in 1995, was translated by Ian Maclean.

The most recent and complete French-language version to date was edited by François Rosset and Dominique Triaire and published in 2006 in Leuven, Belgium, as part of a critical scholarly edition of the Complete Works of Potocki. Unlike Radrizzani&#x27;s 1989 edition of the &quot;Manuscript Found in Saragossa&quot;, Rosset and Triaire&#x27;s edition is based solely on Potocki&#x27;s French-language manuscripts found in libraries in France, Poland (in particular, previously unknown autograph pieces that they discovered in Poznań), Spain and Russia, as well as in the private collection of Potocki&#x27;s heirs.

Rosset and Triaire identified two versions of the novel: one unfinished, of 1804, published in 1805; and the full version of 1810, which appears to have been completely reconceived in comparison to the 1804 version. Whereas the first version has a lighter, more sceptical tone, the second one tends toward a darker, more religious mood. In view of the differences between the two versions, the 1804 and 1810 versions have been published as two separate books; paperback editions were issued in early 2008 by Flammarion.

== Film, television and theatre ==
In 1965, director Wojciech Has adapted the novel into a Polish-language black-and-white film &quot;The Saragossa Manuscript&quot; (Polish title: &quot;Rękopis znaleziony w Saragossie&quot;), starring Zbigniew Cybulski. The film was released in a full-length Polish version (180 minutes) and in shortened versions in other countries (152 minutes in the United States, and 125 in the United Kingdom).

The film was admired by many 1960s counterculture artists, notably Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia, who financed a complete print, as well as mainstream figures such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and Luis Buñuel. Neil Gaiman has referenced the book and film, in passing, in at least three different works. The film was shot near Częstochowa and in Wrocław, Poland. A detailed outline of the movie&#x27;s plot is available online.

In 1973, the novel was adapted into a television mini-series in France, under the title &quot;La Duchesse d&#x27;Avila&quot;, with Jean Blaise as Van Worden.

The late Vi Marriott adapted the book for The Cherub Theatre Company, which was performed by them under the title &#x27;Ten Days A-Maze&#x27; and won several awards at the 1997 Edinburgh Fringe.*

In 1984, the Mexican writer Juan Tovar made the first theatrical adaptation of the novel in Spanish, which was edited by the theater and film director Ludwik Margules.

A later adaption is the Romanian-language play &quot;Saragosa, 66 de Zile&quot; (&quot;Saragossa, 66 Days&quot;), written and directed by Alexandru Dabija in 1999 at the Odeon Theatre Bucharest, and first represented at The Theater der Welt festival in Berlin.

Christine Mary Dunford adapted an English-language stage version from Ian Maclean&#x27;s translation of the novel.

Subsequently, the novel (and film) acted themselves as a frame-story for an episode of the Italian TV series &quot;Inspector Montalbano&quot;.

In 2001, composer José Evangelista premiered the opera &quot;Manuscrit trouvé à Saragosse&quot; on a libretto by Alexis Nouss based on the novel.

In 2017, the Italian filmmaker Alberto Rondalli adapted the book in a movie titled &quot;Agadah&quot;.

<text>Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin or Yeshivas Rabbeinu Chaim Berlin () is an American Haredi Lithuanian-type boys&#x27; and men&#x27;s yeshiva in Brooklyn, New York. The school&#x27;s divisions include a preschool, a &quot;yeshiva ketana&quot; (elementary school), a &quot;mesivta&quot; (high school), a college-level beth midrash, and Kollel Gur Aryeh, its post-graduate kollel.

==History==
Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin was established in 1904 as &quot;Yeshiva Tiferes Bachurim&quot; in Brownsville, Brooklyn, by Jews who moved there from the Lower East Side of New York City, thus making it the oldest yeshiva in Kings County. At the suggestion of Meir Berlin (Bar-Ilan), it was renamed in 1914 for his brother, Chaim Berlin, Chief Rabbi of Moscow and later Jerusalem, and who had also served in Valozhyn, from where several of the yeshiva&#x27;s founders came. Through the help of philanthropist Jacob Rutstein, in 1940 the yeshiva purchased the seven-story former Municipal Bank Building at Pitkin and Stone Avenues (now Mother Gaston Boulevard) in Brownsville.

==Leadership==

The founding rosh yeshiva, Yaakov Moshe Shurkin, served from 1936 until his death in 1963. Yitzchok Hutner joined the faculty during 1936–1937, and gave monthly lectures as rosh yeshiva from 1943 to 1980. In the late 1970s, a branch was opened in Jerusalem called Yeshiva Pachad Yitzchok (Fear of Isaac).

After Hutner&#x27;s death, the New York yeshiva was headed by his disciple Aaron Schechter, and the Jerusalem branch was headed by his son-in-law Yonason David, who also serves nominally as co-head of the New York branch. When Schechter died in 2023, the leadership of the yeshiva passed to his son-in-law Shlomo Halioua. Halioua died on 27 October 2024 after leading the yeshiva for only a year and a half. The leadership then passed jointly to Halioua&#x27;s son Yosef and son-in-law Tzvi Fink.

The position of &quot;mashgiach ruchani&quot; (spiritual supervisor) has been held by (among others) Avigdor Miller, Shlomo Freifeld, Shlomo Carlebach, Shimon Groner, and Mordechai Zelig &quot;Mottel&quot; Shechter (a son of Aaron). It has been vacant since the latter&#x27;s passing in September 2023.

==Divisions==
Chaim Berlin consists of a preschool, a &quot;yeshiva ketana&quot; (elementary school), a &quot;mesivta&quot; (high school), a college-level beth midrash, and Kollel Gur Aryeh, its post-graduate kollel division. Total enrollment for all divisions approaches 2,000 students. The &quot;mesivta&quot; acts as a feeder school for the beth midrash. For a time, while located in Far Rockaway, the &quot;mesivta&quot; was headed by Shlomo Freifeld.

The yeshiva maintains a summer location, Camp Morris, in Sullivan County, New York. The Yeshiva also runs a summer youth program with the name Chaim Day Camp.

<text>Shraga Feivel Mendlowitz (1886 – 7 September 1948) was a leader of American Orthodox Judaism and founder of institutions including Torah U&#x27;Mesorah, an outreach and educational organization. In 1921 he became principal of Yeshiva Torah Vodaath, an early Brooklyn-based yeshiva founded in 1918. He subsequently added a high school and postgraduate program to the yeshiva. His policies were often informed by the Orthodox philosophical movement Torah im Derech Eretz.

==Biography==
Mendlowitz was born in Világ (today Svetlice, Slovakia), in the Austria-Hungarian Empire, a small town near the border of Poland, to a Hasidic family: Moshe and Bas-Sheva Mendlowitz. Shraga Feivel pronounced his family name &quot;Mendelovich&quot;. 

His mother died when he was ten. He was twelve when the family relocated to Mezőlaborc (now ), where he studied &quot;with Reb Aaron, &quot;dayyan&quot; of Mezo-Laboretz, who considered him his top pupil.&quot; Having received &quot;semicha&quot; at age 17, he continued his studies under Rabbi Simcha Bunim Schreiber (the &quot;Shevet Sofer&quot;, grandson of the Chatam Sofer). Throughout his life, however, he refused to use the title of Rabbi and insisted on being referred to as &quot;Mr. Mendlowitz.&quot;

At age 22, he &quot;married his step-mother&#x27;s younger sister, Bluma Rachel&quot; in the town of Humenné, Slovakia, and began to study several not well known Jewish writings, including the works of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch. This briefly led to controversy until he could prove the relevance of Hirsch&#x27;s work in defending the Orthodox viewpoint against attempts at reforming Jewish practice.

== Activities ==
Mendlowitz actively sought positions in Germany and the United States, with the intention of disseminating knowledge of Judaism to Jews previously unexposed to their heritage, and in September 1913, he arrived alone in Philadelphia. He lived in Scranton, Pennsylvania, for seven years, teaching in the local &quot;Talmud Torah&quot; (afternoon program in Jewish studies). In 1920 he was able to bring his family from Hungary, and settled in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

Mendlowitz joined forces with Chazan Yossele Rosenblatt in 1923, to produce &quot;Dos Yiddishe Licht&quot;, a short-lived English and Yiddish language weekly that included articles of comment and inspiration. It eventually became a daily but was forced to discontinue publication in 1927, because of financial difficulties. In fact, Rosenblatt went on a year-long concert tour to pay back the monies owed to creditors. 

The founding members of Yeshiva Torah Vodaath soon offered him the principalship of the institution. Originally starting off as an elementary school, Mendlowitz soon added the second Yeshiva high school in America. (The first being the Talmudical Academy, associated with Yeshiva College, founded in 1916.) The yeshiva opened its &quot;mesivta&quot; in 1926 and then under Mendlowitz&#x27;s direction, another early development in America (but also in competition with Yeshiva College), a post-graduate program. Mendlowitz first appointed Rabbi Gedalia Schorr to the faculty of the Yeshiva, later to become its principal and Rosh Yeshiva.

Despite his devotion to Torah Vodaath he assisted in the founding (both personally and financially) of several similar institutions, such as Mesivta Chaim Berlin (to which he relinquished a number of his top pupils), Telshe Cleveland and Beis Medrash Gevoha. All grew to occupy important places in 20th century American Orthodoxy.

His work in Jewish education extended to several other organisations he founded. Aish Dos was a specialized institution that focused on teaching outreach skills, Torah U&#x27;mesora was a nationwide umbrella organization for Jewish day schools, and Beis Medrash Elyon was one of America&#x27;s first post-graduate yeshivas (which also included a kollel). In 1931 he founded Camp Mesivta, the first yeshiva day camp.

Mendlowitz renounced eating meat after the Holocaust, saying: &quot;There has been enough killing in the world.&quot;

<doc id="563120" wikidata="Q3848483" url="?curid=563120" title="Biological rhythm">
<text>Biological rhythms are repetitive biological processes. Some types of biological rhythms have been described as biological clocks. They can range in frequency from microseconds to less than one repetitive event per decade. Biological rhythms are studied by chronobiology. In the biochemical context biological rhythms are called biochemical oscillations.

The variations of the timing and duration of biological activity in living organisms occur for many essential biological processes. These occur (a) in animals (eating, sleeping, mating, hibernating, migration, cellular regeneration, etc.), (b) in plants (leaf movements, photosynthetic reactions, etc.), and in microbial organisms such as fungi and protozoa. They have even been found in bacteria, especially among the cyanobacteria (aka blue-green algae, see bacterial circadian rhythms).

==Circadian rhythm==
The best studied rhythm in chronobiology is the circadian rhythm, a roughly 24-hour cycle shown by physiological processes in all these organisms. The term &quot;circadian&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;circa&quot;, meaning &quot;around&quot; and &quot;dies&quot;, &quot;day&quot;, meaning &quot;approximately a day.&quot; It is regulated by circadian clocks.

The circadian rhythm can further be broken down into routine cycles during the 24-hour day:
* Diurnal, which describes organisms active during daytime
* Nocturnal, which describes organisms active in the night
* Crepuscular, which describes animals primarily active during the dawn and dusk hours (ex: white-tailed deer, some bats)

While circadian rhythms are defined as regulated by endogenous processes, other biological cycles may be regulated by exogenous signals. In some cases, multi-trophic systems may exhibit rhythms driven by the circadian clock of one of the members (which may also be influenced or reset by external factors). The endogenous plant cycles may regulate the activity of the bacterium by controlling availability of plant-produced photosynthate.

==Other cycles==
Many other important cycles are also studied, including:
* Infradian rhythms, which are cycles longer than a day. Examples include circannual or annual cycles that govern migration or reproduction cycles in many plants and animals, or the human menstrual cycle.
* Ultradian rhythms, which are cycles shorter than 24 hours, such as the 90-minute REM cycle, the 4-hour nasal cycle, or the 3-hour cycle of growth hormone production.
* Tidal rhythms, commonly observed in marine life, which follow the roughly 12.4-hour transition from high to low tide and back.
* Lunar rhythms, which follow the lunar month (29.5 days). They are relevant e.g. for marine life, as the level of the tides is modulated across the lunar cycle. 
* Gene oscillations – some genes are expressed more during certain hours of the day than during other hours.

Within each cycle, the time period during which the process is more active is called the &quot;&quot;. When the process is less active, the cycle is in its &quot;&quot; or &quot;trough&quot; phase. The particular moment of highest activity is the &quot;peak&quot; or &quot;maximum&quot;; the lowest point is the &quot;nadir&quot;. How high (or low) the process gets is measured by the &quot;amplitude&quot;.

==Biochemical basis of biological rhythms==
Goldbeter&#x27;s book provides a thorough analysis of the biochemical mechanisms and their kinetic properties that underlie biological rhythms.

<doc id="563133" wikidata="Q1991326" url="?curid=563133" title="Wallacea">
<text>Wallacea is a biogeographical designation for a group of mainly Indonesian islands separated by deep-water straits from the Asian and Australian continental shelves. Wallacea includes Sulawesi, the largest island in the group, as well as Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores, Sumba, Timor, Halmahera, Buru, Seram, and many smaller islands. The islands of Wallacea lie between the Sunda Shelf (the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo, Java, and Bali) to the west, and the Sahul Shelf including Australia and New Guinea to the south and east. The total land area of Wallacea is .

==Geography==
Wallacea is defined as the series of islands stretching between the two continental shelves of Sunda and Sahul, but excluding the Philippines. Its eastern border (separating Wallacea from Sahul) is represented by a zoogeographical boundary known as Lydekker&#x27;s Line, while the Wallace Line (separating Wallacea from Sunda) defines its western border. 

The Weber Line is the midpoint, at which Asian and Australian fauna and flora are approximately equally represented. It follows the deepest straits traversing the Indonesian Archipelago.

The Wallace Line is named after the Welsh naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, who recorded the differences between mammal and bird fauna between the islands on either side of the line. The islands of Sundaland to the west of the line, including Sumatra, Java, Bali, and Borneo, share a mammal fauna similar to that of East Asia, which includes tigers, rhinoceros, and apes; whereas the mammal fauna of Lombok and areas extending eastwards are mostly populated by marsupials and birds similar to those in Australasia. Sulawesi shows signs of both.

During the ice ages, sea levels were lower, exposing the Sunda shelf that links the islands of Sundaland to one another and to Asia and allowing Asian land animals to inhabit these islands. 

The islands of Wallacea have few land mammals, land birds, or freshwater fish of continental origin, which find it difficult to cross open ocean. Many species of birds, reptiles, and insects were better able to cross the straits, and many such species of Australian and Asian origin are found there. Wallacea&#x27;s plants are predominantly of Asian origin, and botanists include Sundaland, Wallacea, and New Guinea as the floristic province of Malesia.

Similarly, Australia and New Guinea to the east are linked by a shallow continental shelf, and were linked by a land bridge during the ice ages, forming a single continent that scientists variously call Australia-New Guinea, Meganesia, Papualand, or Sahul. Consequently, Australia, New Guinea, and the Aru Islands share many marsupial mammals, land birds, and freshwater fish that are not found in Wallacea.

==Biota and conservation issues==
Although the distant ancestors of Wallacea&#x27;s flora and fauna may have been from Asia or Australia-New Guinea, Wallacea is home to many endemic species. There is extensive speciation and proportionately large numbers of endemics; the area is an important contributor to the overall mega-biodiversity of the Indonesian Archipelago.

Fauna includes the lowland and mountain anoa, or dwarf buffalo (&quot;Bubalus&quot; sp.), and the babirusa, or &quot;deer-pig&quot; (&quot;Babyrousa&quot; sp.), both found on Sulawesi, among other islands. Maluku shares a number of similar species with Sulawesi, albeit with fewer total, given the differences in size between the two islands—Sulawesi has at least 4,000 recorded terrestrial plant and animal species, while Maluku has just over 1,000, by comparison. Sulawesi is home to over 2,000 invertebrate species (with over 1,000 known species of arthropod, not including nearly 900 lepidopterans), 100 species of reptiles and amphibians, and 288 bird species. Maluku has around 70 reptile and amphibian, 250 avian, and over 550 invertebrate species. Seram Island is particularly noted for its butterflies and birds, including the Moluccan king parrot. Smaller mammals, including some carnivorans (such as civets), marsupials (such as the cuscus), primates and rodents are common throughout the region. 

A large portion of the waters surrounding Wallacea are part of the Coral Triangle, considered to be the richest coral reef and marine ecosystems on earth, with the highest number of species, adding to the total biodiversity of the region. 

Wallacea was originally almost completely forested, mostly tropical moist broadleaf forests, with some areas of tropical dry broadleaf forest. The higher mountains are home to montane and subalpine forests, and mangroves are common in coastal areas. According to Conservation International, Wallacea is home to over 10,000 plant species, of which approximately 1,500 (15%) are endemic.

Endemism is higher among terrestrial vertebrate species; out of 1,142 species described there, almost half (529) were endemic. 45% of the region retains some sort of forest cover, though only 52,017 km2 (15%) is in a pristine state. Of Wallacea&#x27;s total 347,000 km2-area, about 20,000 km2 are protected.

==Ecoregions==
Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests:

* Banda Sea Islands moist deciduous forests (Kai Islands, Tanimbar Islands, Babar Islands, Leti Islands, eastern Barat Daya Islands)
* Buru rain forests (Buru)
* Halmahera rain forests (Halmahera, Morotai, Obi Islands, Bacan Island)
* Seram rain forests (Seram, Banda Islands, Ambon Island, Saparua, Gorong archipelago)
* Sulawesi lowland rain forests (Sulawesi, Banggai Islands, Sula Islands, Sangihe Islands, Talaud Islands)
* Sulawesi montane rain forests (Sulawesi)

Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests:

* Lesser Sundas deciduous forests (Lombok, Sumbawa, Komodo, Flores, Alor)
* Sumba deciduous forests (Sumba)
* Timor and Wetar deciduous forests (Timor, Wetar)

==Distribution between Asia and Australia==
Australia may be isolated by sea, but technically through Wallacea, it can be zoologically extended. Australian Early-Middle Pliocene rodent fossils have been found in Chinchilla Sands and Bluffs Down in Queensland, but a mix of ancestral and derived traits suggest murid rodents made it to Australia earlier, maybe in the Miocene, over a forested archipelago, i.e. Wallacea, and evolved in Australia in isolation. 

Australia&#x27;s rodents make up much of the continent&#x27;s placental mammal fauna and include various species from stick-nest rats to hopping mice. Other mammals invaded from the east. Two species of cuscus, the Sulawesi bear cuscus and the Sulawesi dwarf cuscus, are the westernmost representatives of the Australasian marsupials.

The tectonic uplift of Wallacea during the collision between Australia and Asia 23 million years ago allowed the global dispersal of passerine birds from Australia across the Indonesian islands. Bustards and megapodes must have somehow colonized Australia. Cockatiels similar to those from Australia inhabit Komodo Island in Wallacea.

A few species of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;, a predominant genus of trees in Australia, are found in Wallacea: &quot;Eucalyptus deglupta&quot; on Sulawesi, and &quot;E. urophylla&quot; and &quot;E. alba&quot; in East Nusa Tenggara. For land snails Wallacea and Wallace&#x27;s Line do not form a barrier for dispersal.

<text>Walkley is an electoral ward in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England.

Walkley ward—which includes the districts of Netherthorpe, Upperthorpe, Walkley and parts of Neepsend—is one of the 28 electoral wards in City of Sheffield, England. It is located in the northwestern part of the city and covers an area of 3.8 km2. The population of this ward in 2011 was 21,793 people in 9,654 households. The ward is in Sheffield Central Parliamentary Constituency.

==Districts of Walkley ward==
===Walkley===

Walkley () is a suburb in the north west of Sheffield in England. It lies north-east of Crookes and south of Hillsborough.

===Netherthorpe===

Netherthorpe () is a council estate lying south-east of the Ponderosa open space. Originally an area of working-class Victorian terraces, it was reconstructed in the 1960s as an area of tower blocks and medium-rise flats with a few houses. In the late 1990s the tower blocks were reclad and many of the other flats demolished and replaced by modern housing.

===Upperthorpe===

Upperthorpe () lies north-west of the Ponderosa open space and south east of Walkley. Building in the area began in the late Georgian period, from which the former infirmary (now offices) and a few houses survive. Construction continued, with many large Victorian houses and a car-free late-20th-century housing estate surviving. The Kelvin Flats were a landmark in the area, of similar design to now listed Park Hill, but were demolished in the early 1990s. The area is served by the Infirmary Road Sheffield Supertram stop.

<doc id="563137" wikidata="Q144923" url="?curid=563137" title="Sun bear">
<text>The sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) is a bear species in the family Ursidae found in the tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is the only species in the genus Helarctos and the smallest bear species, standing nearly at the shoulder and weighing . It is stockily built, with large paws, strongly curved claws, small, rounded ears and a short snout. The fur is generally short and jet black, but can vary from grey to red. The sun bear gets its name from its characteristic orange to cream-coloured chest patch. Its unique morphology—inward-turned front feet, flattened chest, powerful forelimbs with large claws—suggests adaptations for climbing.

The most arboreal (tree-living) of all bears, the sun bear is an excellent climber and sunbathes or sleeps in trees above the ground. It is mainly active during the day, though nocturnality might be more common in areas frequented by humans. Sun bears tend to remain solitary, but sometimes occur in twos (such as a mother and her cub). They do not seem to hibernate, possibly because food resources are available the whole year throughout the range. Being omnivores, sun bears&#x27; diet includes ants, bees, beetles, honey, termites, and plant material such as seeds and several kinds of fruits; vertebrates such as birds and deer are also eaten occasionally. They breed throughout the year; individuals become sexually mature at two to four years of age. Litters comprise one or two cubs that remain with their mother for around three years.

The range of the sun bear is bounded by northeastern India to the north then south to southeast through Bangladesh, Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam in mainland Asia to Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia to the south. These bears are threatened by heavy deforestation and illegal hunting for food and the wildlife trade; they are also harmed in conflicts with humans when they enter farmlands, plantations, and orchards. The global population is estimated to have declined by 35% since the 1990s. The IUCN has listed this species as vulnerable.

==Etymology==
The generic name &quot;Helarctos&quot; comes from two Greek words: (, related to the sun) and (, bear). Another name is &quot;honey bear&quot;, in Malay and Indonesian, in reference to its habit of feeding on honey from honeycombs.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The scientific name &quot;Ursus malayanus&quot; was proposed by Stamford Raffles in 1821 when he first described a sun bear from Sumatra. In 1825, Thomas Horsfield placed the species in a genus of its own, &quot;Helarctos&quot;, when describing a sun bear from Borneo.

=== Subspecies and distribution ===
&quot;H. annamiticus&quot;, described by Pierre Marie Heude in 1901 from Annam, is not considered a distinct species, but is subordinated as a junior synonym to &quot;H. m. malayanus&quot;. In 1906, Richard Lydekker proposed another subspecies by the name &quot;H. m. wardii&quot; for a sun bear skull, noting its similarities to a skull from Tibet with a thicker coat, but the Tibetan specimen was later found to be an Asian black bear (&quot;Ursus thibetanus&quot;). Genetic differences between the two subspecies are obscure and some authorities consider the species monotypic.

=== Phylogeny ===
The phylogenetic relationships among ursid species have remained ambiguous over the years. Noting the production of fertile hybrids between sun bears and sloth bears (&quot;Melursus ursinus&quot;), it was proposed that &quot;Helarctos&quot; be treated as a synonym of &quot;Melursus&quot;. However, studies differed on whether the two species were closely related. The brown bear/polar bear genetic lineage was estimated to have genetically diverged from the two black bears/sun bear lineage around (mya); the sun bear appears to have diverged from the two black bears between 6.26 and 5.09 mya. and 5.89–3.51 mya.
Nuclear gene sequencing of bear species revealed that the sloth bear and the sun bear were the first Ursinae bears that radiated and are not included in the monophyletic &quot;Ursus&quot; group; moreover, all relationships between the bears were well resolved.

==Characteristics==

The sun bear is named so for its characteristic orange- to cream-coloured, crescent-like chest patch.
It is the smallest of all bear species. It is stockily built, with large paws, strongly curved claws, small rounded ears and a short snout. The head-and-body length is between , and the shoulder height is nearly . Adults weigh . The snout is grey, silver, or orange. The fur is generally jet black, but can vary from grey to red. The hair is silky and fine, and is the shortest of all bear species, suiting its hot tropical habitat. The characteristic chest patch, typically U-shaped, but sometimes circular or spotlike, varies from orange or ochre-yellow to buff or cream, or even white. Some individuals may even lack the patch. Sun bears can expose the patch while standing on their hind feet as a threat display against enemies. Infants are greyish black with a pale brown or white snout and the chest patch is dirty white; the coat of older juveniles may be dark brown. The underfur is particularly thick and black in adults, while the guard hairs are lighter. Two whorls occur on the shoulders, from whence the hair radiates in all directions. A crest is seen on the sides of the neck and a whorl occurs in the centre of the breast patch. The edges of the paws are tan or brown, and the soles are fur-less, which possibly is an adaptation for climbing trees. The claws are sickle-shaped; the front claws are long and heavy. The tail is long. The sympatric Asian black bear has cream-coloured chest markings of a similar shape as those of sun bears and different claw markings.

During feeding, the sun bear can extend its exceptionally long tongue to extract insects and honey. The teeth are very large, especially the canines, and the bite force quotient is high relative to its body size for reasons not well understood; a possible explanation could be its frequent opening of tropical hardwood trees with its powerful jaws and claws in pursuit of insects, larvae, or honey. The bite force is high for its size: a 50 Kg sun bear bites with a maximum force of 1907.3–2020.6 Newtons on the rear molar. The head is large, broad and heavy in proportion to the body, but the ears are proportionately smaller; the palate is wide in proportion to the skull. The overall unique morphology of this bear, such as its inward-turned front feet, flattened chest, and powerful fore limbs with large claws, indicates adaptations for extensive climbing.

==Ecology and behaviour==

Sun bears lead the most arboreal (tree-living) lifestyle among all bears. They are mainly active during the day, although nocturnality might be more common in areas frequented by humans. The sun bear is an excellent climber; it sunbathes or sleeps in trees above the ground. Bedding sites consist mainly of fallen hollow logs, but they also rest in standing trees with cavities, in cavities underneath fallen logs or tree roots, and in tree branches high above the ground. It is also an efficient swimmer. Sun bears are noted for their intelligence; a captive bear observed sugar being stored in a cupboard locked by a key, and later used its claw to open the lock. A study published in 2019 described skillful mimicry of facial expressions by sun bears, with precision comparable to that seen in gorillas and humans.

Sun bears are shy and reclusive animals, and usually do not attack humans unless provoked to do so, or if they are injured or with their cubs; their timid nature led these bears to be often tamed and kept as pets in the past. Other sources, though, state that sun bears are known as very fierce animals when surprised in the forest. They are typically solitary but are sometimes seen in pairs (such as mothers and cubs). Sun bears stand on their hind feet for a broader view of their surroundings or smell far-off objects; they try to intimidate their enemies by displaying their chest patch if threatened. Vocalisations include grunts and snuffles while foraging for insects, and roars similar to those of a male orangutan during the breeding season; less commonly, they may give out short barks (like a rhinoceros) when they are surprised. Sun bears do not seem to hibernate, possibly because food resources are available the whole year throughout the range. They occupy home ranges of varying sizes in different areas, ranging from in Borneo and peninsular Malaysia; and in Ulu Segama Forest Reserve in Sabah. Tigers are their major predators; dholes and leopards have also been recorded preying on sun bears, but cases are relatively few. In one incident, a tiger-sun bear interaction resulted in a prolonged altercation and in the death of both animals. In another incident, a wild female sun bear was swallowed by a large reticulated python in East Kalimantan.

===Diet===

Sun bears are omnivores and feed on a broad variety of items, such as ants, bees, beetles, honey, termites, and plant material such as seeds and several kinds of fruits. Vertebrates such as birds, deer, eggs, and reptiles may be eaten occasionally. They forage mostly at night. Sun bears tear open hollow trees with their long, sharp claws and teeth in search of wild bees and honey. They also break termite mounds and quickly lick and suck the contents, holding pieces of the broken mound with their front paws. They consume figs in large amounts and eat them whole. In a study in the forests of Kalimantan, the fruits of Moraceae, Burseraceae, and Myrtaceae species made up more than 50% of the fruit diet; in times of fruit scarcity, sun bears switched to a more insectivorous diet. A study in Central Borneo revealed that sun bears play an important role in the seed dispersal of &quot;Canarium pilosum&quot; (a tree in the family Burseraceae). Sun bears eat the centre of coconut palms, and crush oil-rich seeds such as acorns. Oil palms are nutritious but not enough for subsistence.

===Reproduction===
Sun bears are polyoestrous; births occur throughout the year. Oestrus lasts five to seven days. Sun bears become sexually mature at two to four years of age. Reported lengths for pregnancies vary from 95 to 240 days; pregnancy tends to be longer in zoos in temperate climate possibly due to delay in implantation or fertilisation. Births occur inside hollow tree cavities. A litter typically comprises one or two cubs weighing around each. Cubs are born deaf with eyes closed. The eyes open at nearly 25 days, but they remain blind till 50 days after birth; the sense of hearing improves over the first 50 days. Cubs younger than two months are dependent on external stimulation for defecation. Cubs are kept on buttress roots at the base of trees until they learn how to walk and climb properly. Mothers protect their cubs aggressively. Offspring remain with their mother for nearly the first three years of their lives. Lifespan in captivity is generally over 20 years; one individual has lived for 34 years.

==Distribution and habitat==

The sun bear is native to the tropical forests of Southeast Asia; its range is bound by northeastern India to the north and extends south to Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam to Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia to the south. Its presence in China was confirmed in 2017 when it was sighted in Yingjiang County of Yunnan Province. It is extinct in Singapore.

These bears dwell primarily in two main types of forests throughout their range - deciduous and seasonally evergreen forests to the north of the Isthmus of Kra, and non-seasonal evergreen forests in Indonesia and Malaysia. They are typically found at low altitudes, such as below in western Thailand and peninsular Malaysia, but this varies widely throughout the range; in India, larger numbers have been recorded at elevations up to than in low-lying areas, probably due to habitat loss at ground level. They occur in montane areas in northeast India, but may not extend farther north into the unfavourable and colder Himalayan region; their distribution might be restricted to the northwest due to competition with sloth bears. The sun bear is sympatric with the Asian black bear throughout the remaining areas in the mainland range featuring a mix of seasonal forest types, with monthly rainfall below for a long spell of 3–7 months. In mountainous areas, Asian black bears are more common than sun bears, probably due to scarcity of invertebrates on which to feed. The major habitats in southern Thailand and peninsular Malaysia are moist evergreen forests, with more or less unvarying climate and heavy rainfall throughout the year, and low-lying or montane dipterocarp forests. Mangroves may be inhabited, but usually only when they are close to preferred habitat types.

The sun bear tends to avoid heavily logged forests and areas close to human settlement. However, sun bears have been seen in farmlands, plantations and orchards, where they may be considered vermin. A survey in Lower Kinabatangan Segama Wetlands showed that sun bears were feared but were not common in oil palm plantations; Bornean bearded pigs, elephants and macaques were far more damaging to crops. Sun bears have been reported preying on poultry and livestock.

Fossil remains suggest its occurrence farther north during the Pleistocene; it may have occurred as far south as Java in the middle to Late Pleistocene. Fossils also known from the Middle Pleistocene of Thailand along with &quot;Stegodon&quot;, gaur, wild water buffalo, and other living and extinct mammals. Today, it has been eliminated from the majority of its erstwhile range, especially in Thailand; populations are declining in most of the range countries. It disappeared from Singapore during the 1800s and 1900s, possibly due to extensive deforestation. Sun bear populations appear to decrease in size northward from Sundaland, and numbers are especially low in the northern and western extremes of the range. This has possibly been the case since prehistoric times, and is not a result of human interference. The population density varies from in Khao Yai National Park to in the Harapan Rainforest in southern Sumatra.

==Threats==

According to the IUCN Bear Specialist Group, sun bear populations have fallen by an estimated 35% since the 1990s. Numbers are especially low in Bangladesh and China, and populations in Vietnam are feared to decline severely by 50–80% in the next 30 years. Habitat fragmentation is on the rise, particularly in Borneo, Sumatra, and some areas of the mainland range. Heavy deforestation (due to agriculture, logging, and forest fires) and hunting for wildlife trade are severe threats throughout the range; human-bear conflicts are a relatively minor threat. Compared to other continents, Southeast Asia has undergone severe depletion in forest cover over the past few decades (by almost 12% between 1990 and 2010); this has resulted in substantial habitat loss for forest-dependent species such as sun bears. A 2007 study in East Borneo recorded severe loss of habitat and food resources due to droughts and forest fires brought about by the El Niño. With lack of research in predation, sources have documented very few predation events. In the island of Borneo sun bears were found to be hunted by python in their most vulnerable state. Pythons are successfully able to attack by taking advantage of the nighttime when the sun bears are sleep or nursing their cub. In Southeast Asia, a male leopard (&quot;Panthera pardus&quot;) has been photographed with a sun bear cub being held by the throat. This reported case has been reported to be the second confirmed predator as of 2019.
During surveys in Kalimantan between 1994 and 1997, interviewees admitted to hunting sun bears and indicated that sun bear meat is eaten by indigenous people in several areas there. Studies have found evidence of pet trade and sale of sun bear parts such as gall bladders in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) shops in Sabah and Sarawak. In 2018 and 2019, 128 TCM outlets in 24 locations across Sabah and Sarawak were surveyed and bear parts and derivatives were recorded for sale in 25% of the outlets surveyed, many of which would have been derived from locally sourced sun bears. Sun bears were killed by shooting or administering poison to protect coconut and snakefruit plantations in east Kalimantan. A report published by TRAFFIC in 2011 showed that sun bears, along with Asian black bears and brown bears, are specifically targeted for the bear bile trade in Southeast Asia, and are kept in bear farms in Laos, Vietnam, and Myanmar. Poaching is common in several countries in the region. Hunting pressure is rising even in some protected areas; in the Nam Ha National Protected Area in Laos, hunter snares have been found that specifically target bears. A study in Nagaland (northeastern India) recorded a sparse distribution of sun bears in the Fakim and Ntangki National Parks, and reported extensive illegal hunting for food and trade in bear parts. Protective laws have shown little success in controlling these threats, especially due to poor execution and high potential for gains by the trade.

==Conservation measures==

The sun bear is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, and is included in CITES Appendix I. With the exception of Sarawak (Malaysia) and Cambodia, the sun bear is legally protected from hunting in its whole range. A 2014 report documented rampant poaching and trade in sun bear parts in Sarawak, more than anywhere else in Malaysia; the researchers recommended stricter legislations in the state to protect local sun bears.

The Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre, founded by Wong Siew Te in Sabah (Malaysia) in 2008, aims to work for the welfare of sun bears rescued from poor conditions in captivity and spread awareness about their conservation. The Malayan sun bears are part of an international captive-breeding program and a species survival plan under the Association of Zoos and Aquariums since late 1994. Since that same year, the European breed registry for sun bears is kept in the Cologne Zoological Garden, Germany.

<text>&quot;Kill the Poor&quot; is a song by Dead Kennedys, released in October 1980 on Cherry Red Records as the band&#x27;s third single, with &quot;In-sight&quot; as its B-side. The song is a satire of the elite, saying how if given the chance, they would use neutron bombs to wipe out the impoverished whilst preserving property. The title track was re-recorded for the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables&quot; (1980), although the single and album versions show little difference in comparison. The B-side of this single is also additionally on the compilation album &quot;Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death&quot; (1987). A special &quot;disco version&quot; was played and recorded on March 3, 1979, and released on their live album &quot;Live at the Deaf Club.&quot;

&quot;Kill the Poor&quot; reached #49 in the UK Singles Chart, spending three weeks on the chart.

<text>Reference Re Secession of Quebec, [1998] 2 SCR 217 is a landmark judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada regarding the legality, under both Canadian and international law, of a unilateral secession of Quebec from Canada.

Both the Quebec government and the Canadian government stated they were pleased with the Supreme Court&#x27;s opinion, pointing to different sections of the ruling.

==Background==
Following the election of a majority of Parti Québécois (PQ) Members of the National Assembly (MNAs) in the 1976 Quebec provincial election, the party formed a government and, in 1980, held an independence referendum. The government of the Province of Quebec asked the province&#x27;s population if it should seek a mandate to negotiate sovereignty for Quebec coupled with the establishment of a new political and economic union with Canada. The referendum resulted in the defeat of the sovereignty option, with 59.6% voting no on sovereignty. The PQ was nevertheless re-elected in 1981, this time promising not to hold a referendum.

In 1982, the federal government petitioned the Parliament of the United Kingdom in London to amend Canada&#x27;s constitution so that, in the future, all further amendments would take place by means of a process of consent involving only the Parliament of Canada and the legislatures of the provinces. Up until this point, all amendments had taken place by means of Acts of the British Parliament, since the Canadian constitution was, strictly speaking, a simple statute of that Parliament. 
Colloquially, the switch to a domestic amendment procedure was known as patriation. The particular amending formula adopted in 1982 was opposed by the then-government of Quebec. Other concomitant constitutional changes such as the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; were also opposed by Quebec, although not necessarily based on rejection of their content but to the manner of their adoption and lack of amendments specific to Quebec in the package. (Also, at that time, Quebec had a more complete &quot;Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms&quot;, which had been adopted in 1975.)

Subsequently, two attempts were made at amending the Canadian constitution (the Meech Lake Accord in 1987–1990 and the Charlottetown Accord in 1992) that, it was hoped, would have caused the Quebec legislature to adopt a motion supporting the revised constitution. Following the failure of both of these to pass, there was a widespread sense in the mid-1990s that the Constitution of Canada was not fully legitimate because it had not yet received the formal approval of Quebec.

In 1994, the Parti Québécois was re-elected and announced that it would be initiating a second referendum to take place in 1995. This time, the question was on sovereignty with an optional partnership with Canada. The &quot;no&quot; side won by only a narrow margin. Prior to this referendum, the National Assembly of Quebec had adopted a bill relating to the future of Quebec that laid out a plan if secession was approved in a referendum.

In response to the bill and the referendum result, several legal actions were initiated by opponents to the independence of Quebec questioning the legality of secession. In 1996, Parti Québécois leader Lucien Bouchard announced his government would make plans to hold another referendum when he was confident that the &quot;winning conditions&quot; were there, pointing to the political cost of losing a third referendum. In reaction to Bouchard&#x27;s stated plans, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien initiated a reference on the legality of a unilateral declaration of independence by a Canadian province.

==Questions addressed==
On September 30, 1996, the Cabinet of Jean Chrétien (i.e., the Governor in Council) approved Order in Council PC 1996–1497 under Section 53 of the &quot;Supreme Court Act&quot;, referring three questions to the Supreme Court of Canada regarding secession.
== Submissions ==
There were an unprecedented 15 interveners. However, the Quebec government refused to take part and was not represented. In its place the Court appointed André Jolicoeur as an to present the argument Quebec may have made, had they participated.

The federal government’s submission argued that the only way a province could secede from Canada would be through a constitutional amendment. Only an amendment through section 45 (on the right of provincial legislatures to make laws amending their own constitutions) would allow for unilateral constitutional amendments, they argued, but that section would not apply to the question of secession. To attempt to secede unilaterally (that is, without negotiations) would violate the constitution on two grounds. First, it would violate the rule of law by ignoring the authority of the constitution as supreme law of the country, and second, it would violate Canadian federalism by acting with powers allocated only to the federal government.

The &#x27;s submission argued several points. First, it argued that the reference was invalid; the question is purely a political one and thus is outside the authority of the Court to answer under section 53 of the Supreme Court Act. It attempted to analogize the use of the US political question doctrine to the Canadian constitution. Furthermore, the question is speculative and premature as there are no substantive facts at question. Second, it focused on the second question, claiming that the Supreme Court of Canada had no jurisdiction over interpreting international law. The submission said that though Quebec could be considered a “peoples” under the Charter of the United Nations, the right to self-determination under that Charter applies to colonized, oppressed, etc. peoples and therefore does not apply to Quebec. It further claimed that since there is no international law barring separation then there must be an implied right to do so. The primary argument was that the doctrine of effectivity gave them authority to secede. That is, recognition of a new state by other countries would validate the separation. It further claimed that the doctrine of effectivity is part of constitutional conventions through its practice in other parts of the commonwealth.

Several aboriginal interveners submitted on their right to stay in Canada based on treaties and their right to self-determination, further noting that they have already held two referendums, which decided against the separation of the aboriginal peoples from Canada. Their attacked the attorney general&#x27;s on the basis that it completely ignored the role of aboriginal people within the constitution.

==Opinion==
===Right to secede under Canadian law===
The court addressed the three questions in order. First, they stated that, under the Canadian Constitution (and with Quebec being a party to it since its inception), unilateral secession was not legal. However, should a referendum decide in favour of independence, the rest of Canada &quot;would have no basis to deny the right of the government of Quebec to pursue secession.&quot; Negotiations would have to follow to define the terms under which Quebec would gain independence, should it maintain that goal. In this section of the judgement they stated that the Constitution is made up of written and unwritten principles (based on text, historical context, and previous constitutional jurisprudence) and that there are four fundamental tenets of the Canadian constitution. Those four interrelated and equally important principles or values are:

# Federalism – the principle that seeks to “reconcile diversity with unity” by giving federal authority over only those issues of common interest amongst culturally diverse and politically independent provinces. The purpose of Canada&#x27;s federalism is not only to create a loose association amongst provinces, but a true national unity.
# Democracy – the principle that seeks to promote participation in effective representative self-government, which respects and responds to all voices in a marketplace of ideas.
# Constitutionalism and the Rule of Law – the principles that protect citizens from state actions by forcing governments to act under the rule of law, the constitution of Canada being the supreme law. The constitution&#x27;s entrenched protections of minorities ensure that the country does not operate simply on majority rule and enable a true democracy in which minority voices are fairly considered.
# Protection of Minorities – the principle that guides the other principles, but one which is also independent and fundamental because of its uniqueness to Canada relative to other federal, constitutional democracies.

They held that these pieces cannot be viewed independently but all interact as part of the Constitutional framework of Canada.

===Rights to secede under international law and self-determination===
The answer to the second question, which concerned Quebec&#x27;s right under international law to secede, gave the opinion that the international law on secession was not applicable to the situation of Quebec. The court pointed out that international law &quot;does not specifically grant component parts of sovereign states the legal right to secede unilaterally from their &#x27;parent&#x27; state.&quot;

The Supreme Court of Canada&#x27;s opinion stated that the right of a people to self-determination was expected to be exercised within the framework of existing states, by negotiation, for example. Such a right could only be exercised unilaterally under certain circumstances, under current international law. The court held that:
and that
The court stated in its opinion that, under international law, the right to secede was meant for peoples under a colonial rule or foreign occupation. Otherwise, so long as a people has the meaningful exercise of its right to self-determination &quot;within&quot; an existing nation state, there is no right to secede unilaterally.
The Supreme Court further stated that: Quebec could not, despite a clear referendum result, purport to invoke a right of self-determination to dictate the terms of a proposed secession to the other parties to the federation. The democratic vote, by however strong a majority, would have no legal effect on its own and could not push aside the principles of federalism and the rule of law, the rights of individuals and minorities, or the operation of democracy in the other provinces or in Canada as a whole.

===Which law applies in Canada?===
Since the court saw no conflict between Canadian law and international law on the question (neither would allow Quebec to secede unilaterally), it considered it unnecessary to answer the question.

==Significance==
The decision has been regarded as a model discussion in international law for questions of separation between national political entities, particularly in relation to the results of a referendum.

The Quebec government of Lucien Bouchard stated that it was very pleased with the opinion of the Supreme Court. Premier Bouchard stated publicly that the court had validated the referendum strategy that the sovereigntists had adopted with René Lévesque. Quebec was most satisfied when the court made it clear that the question of Quebec&#x27;s political status was above all a political question, not a legal one. It also liked the fact that the Supreme Court made it clear that the government of Canada and that of the other provinces would have to negotiate after a winning referendum on secession. This would make a unilateral declaration of independence unnecessary.

The Canadian government of Jean Chrétien stated that it was pleased with the court&#x27;s opinion. The Supreme Court had made it clear that Quebec could not declare independence unilaterally. Any obligation of Canada to negotiate with Quebec was conditional on the sovereigntists&#x27; asking a clear question within the context of a referendum. The government of Canada subsequently drafted the Clarity Act, which Parliament then enacted.

<doc id="563141" wikidata="Q2724968" url="?curid=563141" title="Holiday in Cambodia">
<text>&quot;Holiday in Cambodia&quot; is a song by American punk rock band Dead Kennedys. The record was released as the group&#x27;s second single in May 1980 by Optional Music with &quot;Police Truck&quot; as the B-side. The photograph on the front cover of the single was taken from the Thammasat University massacre in Thailand, depicting a crowd member beating the hanged corpse of a student protester with a metal chair.

The song was re-recorded for the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables&quot; (1980); the original recording of the song, as well as the single&#x27;s B-side, are available on the compilation album &quot;Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death&quot; (1987).

==Composition==
The song was written shortly after the genocidal dictatorship of the Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot, which is estimated to have been responsible for the deaths of roughly a quarter of the Cambodian population between 1975 and 1979. The lyrics are critical of disingenuous college-aged students in the Western world, contrasting their lifestyle with that of those under the Cambodian regime. The official video-clip shows American soldiers in helicopter, some chased by crowd, bombings including U.S. Air Force napalm bombing, and people burned by napalm, in reference to Operation Menu.

The re-recording of this song that appears on &quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables&quot; is different from the single version, being fifty-five seconds longer, at a higher tempo and featuring an extended, surf-influenced intro, as well as an extended bridge and guitar solo.

==Lawsuit==
In October 1998, Jello Biafra was sued by three former members of Dead Kennedys, who claimed that they had been defrauded of royalties owed to them. &quot;The record industry has been skimming royalties owed artists since the beginning,&quot; according to Dead Kennedys&#x27; guitarist East Bay Ray. &quot;This case is no different from blues musicians being taken advantage of in the twenties and thirties... [T]here is no denying we were the victims here.&quot; According to Biafra, the suit was the result of his refusal to allow &quot;Holiday in Cambodia&quot; to be used in a commercial for Levi&#x27;s Dockers; Biafra opposes Levi&#x27;s due to what he believes are their unfair business practices and sweatshop labor. Biafra lost the lawsuit and, as the owner of Alternative Tentacles, was ordered to pay $200,000 in damages to the other band members.

<doc id="563144" wikidata="Q949389" url="?curid=563144" title="Regulation 17">
<text>Regulation 17 () was a regulation of the Government of Ontario, Canada, designed to limit instruction in French-language Catholic separate schools. The regulation was written by the Ministry of Education and was issued in July 1912 by the Progressive Conservative government of premier Sir James P. Whitney. It forbade teaching French beyond grade two in all separate schools.

In 1913, the Jesuits opened Collège Sacré-Coeur in Sudbury. It was bilingual up until 1914, at which time the Government of Ontario granted it a Charter and made no mention of language or religion. The College did not come under authority of the Department of Education for its programs or any subsidies. In 1916, the College became a free institution that was exclusively French.

Regulation 17 was amended in 1913, and it is that version that was applied throughout Ontario. As a result, French Canadians distanced themselves from the subsequent World War I effort, as its young men refused to enlist. The regulation was later repealed in 1927.

==Reaction==

French Canadians reacted with outrage. Quebec journalist Henri Bourassa in November 1914 denounced the &quot;Prussians of Ontario.&quot; With the World War raging, this was a stinging insult. The policy was strongly opposed by Franco-Ontarians, particularly in the national capital of Ottawa where the École Guigues was at the centre of the Battle of the Hatpins. The newspaper &quot;Le Droit&quot;, which is still published today as the province&#x27;s only francophone daily newspaper, was established by the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate in 1913 to oppose the ban. Faced with separate school boards&#x27; resistance and defiance of the new regulation, the Ministry of Education issued Regulation 18 in August 1913 to coerce the school boards&#x27; employees into compliance.

Ontario&#x27;s Catholics were led by the Irish Bishop Fallon, who united with the Protestants in opposing French schools. 

In 1915, the provincial government of Sir William Hearst replaced Ottawa&#x27;s elected separate school board with a government-appointed commission. After years of litigation from ACFÉO, however, the directive was never fully implemented.

==Repeal and legacy==
The regulation was eventually repealed in 1927 by the government of Howard Ferguson following the recommendations of the Merchant-Scott-Côté report. Ferguson was an opponent of bilingualism, but repealed the law because he needed to form a political alliance with Quebec premier Louis-Alexandre Taschereau against the federal government. The Conservative government reluctantly recognized bilingual schools, but the directive worsened relations between Ontario and Quebec for many years and is still keenly remembered by the French-speaking minority of Ontario.

Despite the repeal of Regulation 17, however, French-language schools in Ontario were not officially recognized under the provincial &quot;Education Act&quot; until 1969, with the first French-language high schools in the province officially opening in late 1969 and 1970. Students were allowed to be taught in French, while still under the English school board system. Francophones were finally allowed to have their own school boards by the province under &quot;Act 121&quot; and &quot;Act 122&quot;, which allowed them to elect trustees to these public (non-denominational) school boards; Catholic French-language school boards would follow a few years after. 

The Ontario Heritage Trust erected a plaque for L’École Guigues and Regulation 17 in front of the former school building, 159 Murray Street, Ottawa. &quot;L’École Guigues became the centre of minority-rights agitation in Ontario when in 1912 the provincial government issued a directive, commonly called Regulation 17, restricting French-language education. Mounting protests forced the government to moderate its policy and in 1927 bilingual schools were officially recognized.&quot;

<text>&quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; is a song by American singer Madonna from her third studio album, &quot;True Blue&quot; (1986). Written by Brian Elliot, it was produced by the singer and her collaborator Stephen Bray. In the United States, the song was released as the album&#x27;s second single on June 11, 1986, whereas in most European countries, the release was five days later. A dance-pop track with that mixes elements of baroque, post-disco and classical music, its lyrics deal with teenage pregnancy. Elliot wrote it inspired by teen gossip he&#x27;d hear outside his recording studio. Originally intended for a singer named Christina Dent, Warner Bros. Records A&amp;R executive Michael Ostin convinced Elliot he let Madonna record it instead. The singer then added and altered a few of the lyrics, and got a songwriting credit.

Upon release, the song was lauded by critics, with praise being given to Madonna&#x27;s vocals. Additionally, it became her fourth number one single in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; also topped the charts in Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia, and peaked within the top-five of multiple European countries. The accompanying music video, directed by James Foley, shows the singer in her first &quot;head-to-toe&quot; image makeover, with a leaner, more muscular body. In it, Madonna plays a teenager who confesses her pregnancy to her father, played by actor Danny Aiello. The scenes are juxtaposed with shots of her dancing and singing in a small, darkened studio.

The song caused controversy because of its lyrical content and video. Women&#x27;s organizations and others in the family planning field accused Madonna of promoting teenage pregnancy, while groups opposed to abortion saw the song as having a positive pro-life message. Madonna has performed &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; in five of her concert tours, the last being 2019―2020&#x27;s Madame X Tour. The single&#x27;s performance at the Who&#x27;s That Girl World Tour (1987) caused Madonna&#x27;s first conflict with the Vatican, as she dedicated it to Pope John Paul II, who urged Italian fans to boycott her concerts. In 2002, British personality Kelly Osbourne released a cover of the song, which received mixed reviews but achieved commercial success.

== Background and recording ==
Brian Elliot wrote &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot;. Based on teen gossip he would hear outside his recording studio, which had a large front window that was used as mirror by schoolgirls from the Los Angeles&#x27; North Hollywood High School, Elliot described the track as a &quot;love song, maybe framed a little bit differently [...] about a young girl who found herself at a crossroads in life and didn’t know where to turn&quot;. In 1986, Elliot ―who&#x27;d previously attempted a singing career to no avail― was working and writing songs for Christina Dent, an upcoming singer signed up to Warner Bros. Records. Elliot then played the demos he&#x27;d created for Dent, among them &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot;, to Warner Bros. A&amp;R executive Michael Ostin. Ostin had discovered &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, and asked Elliot if he could play &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; to Madonna, who at the time was working on &quot;True Blue&quot;, her third studio album, alongside Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray. Madonna heard and liked the song, so Ostin talked Elliot into letting her record it. Elliot had been working with Dent for six months and was reluctant to let the song go to another artist, but he eventually gave in, finding the idea of Madonna recording one of his songs &quot;hard to resist&quot;. Madonna&#x27;s contribution was limited to a few altered and added-on lyrics, making &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; the only song on the album that she did not have a strong hand in writing; nonetheless, she managed to get a songwriting credit.

&quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot;, along with the rest of the &quot;True Blue&quot; album, was recorded at Los Angeles&#x27; Channel Recording studios. When they met at the studio, Madonna allegedly asked Elliot if she had &quot;wrecked his song&quot;, and the two got into a brief discussion that was eventually resolved. Personnel working on the song included Bray on keyboards and percussions, alongside Fred Zarr and Jonathan Moffett; David Williams, Bruce Gaitsch and John Putnam played guitars, while background vocals were provided by Siedah Garrett and Edie Lehmann. Zarr had worked on Madonna&#x27;s 1983 debut, and she called him back to work on &quot;True Blue&quot;. When working on the song, Zarr came up with a string sequence while &quot;doodling around&quot; on an Emulator II synthesizer. After Madonna heard it, she liked it and decided to use it as introduction, putting it at the beginning of the song; Zarr, however, remained uncredited.

== Composition and release ==

&quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; is a dance-pop song with elements of baroque, post-disco, classical music and &quot;Beatles-style psychedelia&quot;. According to the sheet music published by Alfred Publishing Inc., it is set in the time signature of common time, with a moderate tempo of 116 beats per minute. Written in the key of F minor, Madonna&#x27;s vocal range spans from F3 to C5. She uses a &quot;mature, centered&quot; lower range, a contrast to her previous works. Lyrically, it&#x27;s about a teenage girl who reveals to her father that she is pregnant, and refuses to have an abortion or give the child up for adoption. It is constructed in a verse-chorus form, with a bridge before the third and final chorus.

The song begins with a &quot;Vivaldian&quot; orchestral string introduction that &quot;sets the mood&quot; before the drums kick in: Fm–E–D–Cm–D–E–Fm–D–E–Fm. The strings then give way to &quot;jittery, propulsive synth-bass and big, mechanized drums&quot;. In the opening verse, the singer addresses her father directly, asking him to treat her as an adult, not a child; &quot;Papa, I know you&#x27;re going to be upset/Cause I was always your little girl/But you should know by now, I&#x27;m not a baby&quot;. Madonna&#x27;s vocals in the pre-chorus are &quot;more dramatic, almost pained&quot;: &quot;The one you warned me all about&quot;, she sings, ending nearly in cries when she pronounces the word &quot;please&quot;. In the chorus she states that she&#x27;s decided to keep the child; &quot;Papa, don&#x27;t preach, I&#x27;m in trouble deep/Papa, don&#x27;t preach, I&#x27;ve been losing sleep/But I&#x27;ve made up my mind, I&#x27;m gonna keep my baby&quot;. As the song goes on, the singer&#x27;s vocals become &quot;stronger&quot;, gaining a sense of &quot;anguish an desperation&quot;.

The second verse has a doubtful Madonna imagining a possible future with the father of her child: &quot;He says that he’s going to marry me/We can raise a little family/Maybe we’ll be all right/It’s a sacrifice&quot;. She also feels pressure from her friends, who encourage her to not become a teen parent; &quot;My friends keep telling me to give it up/Saying I&#x27;m too young, I ought to live it up&quot;. Also present in the song is an acoustic guitar, Spanish-inspired bridge, which was noted for being one of the earliest examples of the influence that Hispanic music had on Madonna&#x27;s musical style. The song ends with Madonna singing &quot;Don&#x27;t you stop loving me, daddy&quot;, as it fades out. In &quot;Madonna&#x27;s Drowned Worlds&quot;, Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens perceived queer subtexts on the lyrics, as members of the LGBT community could relate to them when coming out to their parents. In the United States, &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; was released as &quot;True Blue&quot;″s second single on June 11, 1986. In most European countries, it was issued five days later. It was then added to Madonna&#x27;s compilation albums &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; (1990) and &quot;Celebration&quot; (2009).

== Critical reception ==

Since its release, &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; has been acclaimed by critics. On his review of &quot;True Blue&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Davitt Sigerson wrote that, &quot;only the magnificent &#x27;Papa Don’t Preach&#x27; has the high-profile hook to match &#x27;Like a Virgin&#x27;, &#x27;Dress You Up&#x27; and &#x27;Material Girl&#x27;&quot;, and compared it to Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Billie Jean&quot; (1983). It was deemed &quot;stunning&quot; and a &quot;masterstroke&quot; by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Daniel Brogan and AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine, respectively. For &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s David Browne, &quot;a 30-ish urban sophisticate singing in the voice of a pregnant teen [...] ought to sound ridiculous. With the help of collaborators like Stephen Bray and Patrick Leonard, though [...] [it] turns into a perfectly conceived pop record&quot;.

Adam Sexton, author of &quot;Desperately Seeking Madonna: In Search of the Meaning of the World&#x27;s Most Famous Woman&quot;, named it &quot;True Blue&quot;″s &quot;boldest&quot; track, comparing it to &quot;Bodies&quot; (1977) by Sex Pistols, and Graham Parker&#x27;s &quot;You Can&#x27;t Be Too Strong&quot; (1979). Sexton further pointed out that the melody was just as &quot;insistently chugging&quot; as the singer&#x27;s previous singles &quot;Into the Groove&quot; and &quot;Dress You Up&quot; (1985), but the mood is &quot;tense and claustrophobic&quot;. On this note, John Quayle from the &quot;Observer–Reporter&quot; noted a departure from the &quot;sugar-coatedness&quot; of Madonna&#x27;s past songs. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Sal Cinquemani said it was &quot;undeniably more mature&quot; than Madonna&#x27;s previous works, further adding that, with songs like &quot;Papa Don’t Preach&quot;, &quot;[she] made the transition from pop tart to consummate artist, joining the ranks of the decade&#x27;s icons like Michael Jackson and Prince.

Caroline Sullivan from &quot;The Guardian&quot; opined it was the artist&#x27;s &quot;first socially controversial single, and one of her best tunes to boot [...] it wasn&#x27;t her first attempt at a teenage persona (see &#x27;Dress You Up&#x27;), but it was the most endearing&quot;. Tom Breihan added that, &quot;[&#x27;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&#x27;] signaled that Madonna had enough juice to make a social-issue song that was &quot;also&quot; a stylistic left-turn&quot;. He also said it proved &quot;how Madonna, a technically limited singer, could always capture the feeling of a song&quot;, and referred to &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; as a &quot;masterful piece of pop craftsmanship&quot;. From &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden praised the singer&#x27;s vocals; &quot;[she] sings it in a passionate, bratty sob that makes the plea immediate and believable&quot;. Robert Hilburn, writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, expressed that the &quot;most obvious growth is in the control and character in Madonna&#x27;s singing&quot;, and considered the lyrics to be &quot;tailor-made for video. &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; boasts &quot;some of the strongest vocals Madonna ever recorded&quot;, according to author Matthew Rettenmund.

Writing for &quot;PopMatters&quot;, Peter Piatkowski said it was an &quot;idiosyncratic tune&quot;, that shared the &quot;maturity and ambition&quot; of previous single &quot;Live to Tell&quot;. Santiago Fouz-Hernández concluded the track was a &quot;significant milestone in [Madonna]&#x27;s artistic career&quot;. This sentiment was echoed by &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot;″s Ed Masley, who perceived &quot;more soul than was expected at the time&quot; in Madonna&#x27;s vocals, and referred to the song as a &quot;richly orchestrated dance track&quot;. From website Albumism, Justin Chadwick said that &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; was, &quot;arguably the most unforgettable of &quot;True Blue&quot;″s many memorable moments&quot;. In &quot;The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna&quot;, Rikky Rooksby gave a mixed review: &quot;The chorus is punchy enough, and there&#x27;s a pleasant acoustic guitar solo, but as a whole, [the song] seems musically a trifle under-powered&quot;. Negative criticism came from &quot;The Daily Iowan&quot;″s Jeff Hamilton: &quot;[Madonna] had a good year at the stores, but can anyone take her music seriously? [...] In terms of scrutable ideology [&#x27;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&#x27;] doesn&#x27;t represent a change from &#x27;Like A Virgin&#x27;&quot;. The &quot;Record-Journal&quot;″s Jim Zebora was also negative, referring to the song as &quot;perfectly annoying&quot;.

=== Recognition ===
At the 29th Grammy Awards, &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, but lost to Barbra Streisand&#x27;s &quot;The Broadway Album&quot;. Furthermore, it&#x27;s often referred to as one of Madonna&#x27;s finest singles. The staff of &quot;Billboard&quot; placed it on the 28th spot of the magazine&#x27;s ranking of the singer&#x27;s songs. On &quot;Parade&quot;″s ranking, where it came in at number 25, Samuel R. Murrian praised it for treating a &quot;complicated subject with the humanity and gravity it merits&quot;, and having an &quot;ace pop hook driving it&quot;. Chuck Arnold, writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, named it her 21st greatest song. &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; also came in at number 21 on &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s ranking, where Paul Schrodt wrote: &quot;[It] may well be the only song about choosing &quot;not&quot; to have an abortion that also feels rebellious, even dangerous&quot;.

For the &quot;HuffPost&quot; Matthew Jacobs, &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; is Madonna&#x27;s 14th best song, and its &quot;sweeping string arrangement&quot; one of &quot;pop music&#x27;s most engaging openings&quot;. On the ranking of Madonna songs created by &quot;Gay Star News&quot;, &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; was allocated the tenth spot. From &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Jude Rogers named it Madonna&#x27;s fifth greatest song, praising her vocals and the &quot;glorious string arrangement&quot;. Finally, Nayer Missim from &quot;PinkNews&quot; named it the third best song of the singer&#x27;s discography: &quot;A rare example of Madonna-as-storyteller [...] Unfairly dismissed (or claimed) as a pro-life anthem, its lyrics are much more personal, open and interesting than that&quot;.

== Chart performance ==
On June 18, 1986, &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; was added to 174 of 226 pop reporting radio stations, which caused it to debut on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 42. One month later, the song reached the sixth place of the chart, becoming Madonna&#x27;s ninth consecutive top-ten single. This made her the fourth female artist in the rock era to earn this amount of consecutive top-ten singles, behind only Brenda Lee, Aretha Franklin and Donna Summer. &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; reached the Hot 100&#x27;s first position on August 16, and spent two weeks there. It was Madonna&#x27;s fourth number-one, and her eighth consecutive top-five hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The single also reached the 16th and fourth position of the Dance Club Songs and Adult Contemporary charts, respectively. By the end of 1986, it ranked 29th on the Hot 100. In October 1998, it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of 500,000 copies. In Canada, &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; debuted at number 53 of the &quot;RPM&quot; singles chart on July 5; one month later, it reached the top spot and remained there for two weeks. On &quot;RPM&quot;″s 1986 year-end chart, it came in at number 13.

In the United Kingdom, the song debuted at the 13th position of the singles chart on June 28, and peaked at number one two weeks later. It held the first spot for three consecutive weeks, and was present on the chart a total of 15 weeks. &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in August 1986 for shipment of 500,000 copies. According to &quot;Music Week&quot; magazine, over 629,386 copies of the single have been sold in the United Kingdom as of 2008. The song was commercially successful across Europe as well, reaching the first spot of the charts in Belgium, Ireland, and Norway. It also peaked within the top-five in Austria, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland. &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; reached the first position of the Eurochart Hot 100, where it remained for 11 weeks. It also topped the charts in Australia, and reached the top-five in South Africa and New Zealand.

== Music video ==
=== Background ===

The music video for &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; was directed by James Foley, with whom the singer had previously worked on &quot;Live to Tell&quot;. Crew included David Naylor and Sharon Oreck on production, while Michael Ballhaus was in charge of cinematography. Having just done the &quot;glamorous and stylized&quot; videos for &quot;Material Girl&quot; and &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, for &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot;, Madonna wanted to &quot;tap into a working-class environment&quot;, and do something &quot;a bit more grounded and &#x27;drama&#x27;&quot;, thus Foley suggested filming on Staten Island. Shooting took three days, with the ferry being used for one; the director recalled that, &quot;there were thousands of people and paparazzi and everything&quot;. The singer chose actor Danny Aiello to portray her father in the visual. Aiello recalled that he did not think of Madonna as a &quot;music star or tabloid gossip queen. We were shooting a drama, so I viewed both of us through our characters&quot;. He also revealed that he agreed to star in the video as a favor to actor Sean Penn ―Madonna&#x27;s husband at the time― and because his daughter was a fan of the singer&#x27;s. Alex McArthur ―whom Madonna had spotted in the 1985 film &quot;Desert Hearts&quot;― was cast as her romantic interest. &quot;I was out in the garage working on my Harley [...] I answered the phone and a voice said, &#x27;Hi, this is Madonna. I would like you to be in my next video&#x27;&quot;, McArthur recalled. The singer&#x27;s friends, actresses Debi Mazar, Bianca Hunter and dancer Erika Belle, also participated.

According to Samuel R. Murrian, the video marked Madonna&#x27;s first &quot;head-to-toe image makeover&quot;. No longer wearing heavy jewelry and make-up, she instead adopted a gamine look, similar to the one donned by Shirley MacLaine and Audrey Hepburn in the 1950s. Her body was also leaner and muscular. The video&#x27;s main storyline revolves around an Italian American teenager (Madonna) with an unexpected pregnancy who seeks the approval of her father. Author David James noted that Madonna wanted to &quot;make sure the world could see she&#x27;d been working out heavily, [and] no longer was a streetwise &#x27;tramp&#x27;&quot;, thus additional footage of her singing was shot. Foley explained how this idea came to be:

We took the script literally from the lyrics of the song, and I remember having a moment&#x27;s hesitation about doing that because most videos are not literal interpretations. But I just felt like it was something that tied into her desire to dip into the working-class world. [We] did have the idea that there should be a segment of the video where she was Madonna —not the character in the story— and that&#x27;s where it cuts to the black and white stuff of her dancing around for the chorus.
=== Synopsis ===
The video begins with shots of the New York City skyline, the Statue of Liberty, and Staten Island Ferry. Madonna, as a sixteen-year-old tomboyish teenager in her first months of pregnancy, walks down the sidewalk with a &quot;determined&quot; gaze. She wears tight jeans, a striped boatneck sweater, and carries a leather jacket to her back; her blonde hair is done in a pixie style. When she gets home, the story of her life as an only child raised by a single father (Aiello) is told through flashbacks. The main story is intercut with footage of Madonna singing and dancing against a black background. In these sequences, her appearance is more &quot;glamorous&quot;: She wears a black bustier and pedal pushers, her hair is slightly curled, her lips red, and her eyes &quot;colorfully glossed and outlined&quot;.

Another flashback shows the teenager, dressed in a black T-shirt with the caption &quot;Italians do it better&quot;, meeting and being smitten by an attractive mechanic (McArthur). In the next scene, she ditches her girlfriends to be with him. They spend a romantic evening together on the ferry, where they reflect upon their lives after spotting an elderly couple. As the clip goes on, the teenager ―now aware of her pregnancy― is determined to keep the baby, but is worried about the situation and having to break the news to her father. She walks up a huge outdoor stone staircase from which the camera springs outward to pan the neighborhood. At home, she finally comes clean with her father, who is shocked and leaves the room to think about the situation. When he comes back, he breaks down, and the final scene is of a reconciliatory hug between father and daughter.

=== Reception ===
Critical feedback towards the video was generally positive. Stephen Holden called Madonna&#x27;s performance in the video &quot;virtuoso [...] like Michael Jackson&#x27;s &#x27;Billie Jean&#x27;, the song and its video have an iconographic resonace that could push [her] career to an even higher plateau&quot;. Author Mary Gabriel added that it shared the song&#x27;s &quot;dramatic tension&quot; and themes: &quot;Love, longing, excitement, confusion, isolation, fear ―but never shame. And &quot;that&quot; was a breakthrough. In real teen pregnancies, the girls are the &#x27;sinners&#x27; who carry their shame. Madonna&#x27;s pregnant main character has none&quot;. Gabriel also added that Madonna began to be compared to fellow singer Bruce Springsteen for allegedly &quot;speaking to working-class women and girls the way [Springsteen] spoke to working-class men and boys&quot;.

To the staff of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, it marked the moment the singer began &quot;treating the music video concept as more of a short film than promotional clip&quot;. They also applauded Madonna&#x27;s &quot;rather unglamorous&quot; new look. For Hal Marcovitz, author of &quot;The History of Music Videos&quot; (2012), it marked a &quot;sharp departure&quot; from what the public was used to seeing in Madonna&#x27;s videos. Mark Bego added that, &quot;not everyone could do such an about-face with their looks and not lose their audience. However, [Madonna] pulled it off ―as she would time and time again&quot;. This opinion was shared by &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Eric Mason, who pointed out the sharp contrast with the &quot;glamorous extradiegetic Madonna of &#x27;Material Girl&#x27;&quot;. The singer&#x27;s look with the leather jacket and &quot;Italians do it better&quot; T-shirt is considered to be one of her most &quot;iconic&quot; and &quot;unforgettable&quot;. Mason concluded that, &quot;in addition to igniting controversy over freedom of choice and teen pregnancy, Madonna continued to revolutionize the music video form by expanding its capacity for narrative&quot;. At the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards, &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; won Best Female Video, and was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Overall Performance.

Retrospective reviews have named it one of Madonna&#x27;s best music videos. On the rankings created by The Backlot and &quot;Parade&quot;, it was named her sixteenth and fifteenth greatest video, respectively. Louis Virtel, writing for the former, highlighted the singer&#x27;s &quot;serious Ciccone angst&quot;, and felt it was the &quot;urgency in [her] performance [that] makes this video&quot;. In the ranking of Madonna videos created by &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; came in at number 12. Rocco Papa from The Odyssey highlighted its views of New York City, and named it the singer&#x27;s fourth best music video. It also came in at number four on &quot;Idolator&quot;″s ranking; Mike Neid praised it for &quot;showing off a more serious side of her artistry&quot;. &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; is considered one of the singer&#x27;s most controversial music videos by &quot;HuffPost&quot;″s Daniel Welsh, and Sal Cinquemani. It can be found on Madonna&#x27;s video compilations &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; (1990) and &quot;&quot; (2009).

=== Analysis ===
Journalist Ellen Goodman referred to the video as a &quot;commercial for teen-age pregnancy&quot;, and chastised Madonna for &quot;glamorizing&quot; said subject; &quot;[her] boyfriend is a hunky dreamboat with a conscience and moral compass, while her father is loving, supportive and even-tempered&quot;. Goodman argued that few pregnant teenagers would find a similar support from their boyfriends and families. &quot;This happily-ever-after image has about as much to do with the reality of adolescent motherhood as Madonna&#x27;s (shapely) figure has to do with pregnancy&quot;, the journalist concluded, and asked Madonna to &quot;call off the propaganda&quot;. Fellow singer Cyndi Lauper added: &quot;If you&#x27;re a teen mother who wants to keep her baby [...] you&#x27;re not going to look like Madonna [...] it ain&#x27;t gonna be that easy. Fathers don&#x27;t always come around to give you their blessing. The guy who knocked you up doesn&#x27;t always hang around&quot;. In a 1993 study of Madonna&#x27;s early music videos, &quot;race and gender&quot; were found to be factors in how teenagers interpreted the visual. 50% of African American females and 43% of African American males saw &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; as being about a father-daughter relationship, as opposed to the 25% of white females and 22% of white males who saw it that way. Most white viewers perceived it to be about pregnancy.

Susanne Hamscha, one of the authors of &quot;The Fiction of America: Performance and the Cultural Imaginary in Literature and Film&quot;, argued that the clip oscillates between liberal and conservative ideology, private and public, feminism and patriarchy, and &quot;female independence and the need for paternal approval&quot;. Amy Robinson added that the topic of abortion is &quot;explicitly&quot; addressed in terms of the &quot;private/public dive&quot;, and noted how Madonna&#x27;s character &quot;glorifies parental consent&quot;. In her book &quot;Experiencing Music Video: Aesthetics and Cultural Context&quot;, Carol Vernallis compared the video of &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; to that of No Doubt&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot; (1995), as in both cases, the songs&#x27; music and lyrics offer &quot;imprecise evocations of time&quot;, and allow the viewer to &quot;fill the gaps&quot; regarding the videos&#x27; plots. &quot;&#x27;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&#x27; does not say for how long or how often Madonna dated, or when she became fully committed to her boyfriend [...] In &#x27;Don&#x27;t Speak&#x27;, how long Gwen Stefani had a relationship with a member of the band and when she developed troubles is also uncertain&quot;, Vernallis wrote.

== Controversy ==

As the popularity of the song and video increased in the United States, so did the criticism and support it received from groups concerned with pregnancy and abortion. Conservatives saw Madonna advocating a pro-life stance; others, including woman&#x27;s organizations and parents, criticized her for &quot;promoting&quot; teenage pregnancy. Feminist lawyer Gloria Allred, spokeswoman of the National Organization for Women (NOW), angrily called for the singer to make a public statement or another record supporting the track&#x27;s opposite point of view. Alfred Moran, executive director of New York City&#x27;s Planned Parenthood, went as far as to send out a &quot;critical demo&quot; to radio and TV stations, advising them to &quot;think carefully&quot; before playing the song or airing the video. According to Moran, the song&#x27;s message is that &quot;getting pregnant is cool [a]nd having the baby is the right thing and a good thing and don&#x27;t listen to your parents, the school, anybody who tells you otherwise —don&#x27;t preach to me, Papa&quot;. He further told &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Everybody I&#x27;ve talked to believes [Madonna] has more impact on young teen-agers than any other single entertainer since the Beatles, that&#x27;s what makes this particular song so destructive&quot;. Conservative social worker Kathie Peters added that, &quot;too many kids are getting pregnant. They don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re getting into. I don&#x27;t like the [song&#x27;s] message&quot;. Prior to its release, the singer herself discussed the song with Stephen Holden:

&quot;&#x27;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&#x27; is a message song that everyone is going to take the wrong way. Immediately they&#x27;re going to say I am advising every young girl to go out and get pregnant. When I first heard the song, I thought it was silly. But then I thought, wait a minute, this song is really about a girl who is making a decision in her life. She has a very close relationship with her father and wants to maintain that closeness. To me it&#x27;s a celebration of life. It says, &#x27;I love you, father, and I love this man and this child that is growing inside me&#x27;. Of course, who knows how it will end? But at least it starts off positive&quot;.

In contrast, groups opposed to abortion applauded &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot;. Susan Carpenter-McMillan, president of the California chapter of Feminists for Life (FFL), said that, &quot;[abortion] is readily available on every street corner for young women. Now what Madonna is telling them is, &#x27;hey, there&#x27;s an alternative&#x27;&quot;. Brian Elliot himself allegedly said that, &quot;if [Madonna] has influenced [pregnant] young girls to keep their babies, I don’t think that’s such a bad deal&quot;. Mary Elizabeth &quot;Tipper&quot; Gore, co-founder of the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), and who two years earlier had condemned Madonna&#x27;s single &quot;Dress You Up&quot;, deemed &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; an &quot;important song, and a good one, which discusses, with urgency, a real predicament which thousands of unwed teenagers face in our country [...] It also speaks to the fact that there&#x27;s got to be more support and more communication in familiies about this problem&quot;. In this vein, Joyce Millman wrote in the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot;: &quot;[&#x27;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&#x27;] is Madonna&#x27;s finest three minutes, not merely because it addresses teen pregnancy, but because it suggests that a portion of the blame rests on parents&#x27; reluctance to discuss, not lecture, about sex&quot;. Mary Gabriel noted how in the 1980s, &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and the subject of abortion were still &quot;overwhelmed by the religious right, which shifted the focus to the &quot;fetus&quot;. The woman carrying it became a troublesome bit player&quot;. With &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot;, Madonna &quot;returned the woman to the center stage ―it became about what &quot;she&quot; wanted&quot;.

Madonna herself did not comment on the song&#x27;s use as a pro-life statement. Her publicist Liz Rosenberg released a statement saying that, &quot;[she&#x27;s] singing a song, not taking a stand [...] her philosophy is people can think what they want to think&quot;. The song&#x27;s performance on 1987&#x27;s Who&#x27;s That Girl World Tour also caused controversy, as Madonna dedicated it to Pope John Paul II. The Vatican publicly denounced the singer and John Paul II urged fans to boycott the concerts in Italy. Georges-Claude Guilbert found it hard to believe that, &quot;[Madonna] did not know that she was going to cause a huge controversy [...] With such a song and video, she was throwing in America&#x27;s face the image of a country ravaged by the abortion debate, which is far from being resolved&quot;. In 2016, &quot;Spin&quot; magazine listed &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; among the most controversial songs of all time.

== Live performances ==

&quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; has been included on five of Madonna&#x27;s concert tours: Who&#x27;s That Girl (1987), Blond Ambition (1990), Re-Invention (2004), MDNA (2012), and Madame X (2019―2020). On the first one, she performed the song wearing a 1950s blue dress and a leather jacket. The screen in the background projected images of Pope John Paul II, then-president of the United States Ronald Reagan, the White House, and the phrase &quot;Safe sex&quot;. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Jon Pareles pointed out that, at certain point in the performance, Madonna tilted her chin up to resemble the cover photograph for &quot;True Blue&quot;. Two different performances can be found on the videos &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl: Live in Japan&quot;, filmed in Tokyo on June, and &quot;Ciao Italia: Live from Italy&quot;, filmed in Turin on September.

On the Blond Ambition World Tour, &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; was given a Catholic theme. The stage was set up to resemble a candlelit cathedral, while Madonna wore black vestments. The number featured seven dancers, and the choreography mixed modern and classical ballet, as noted by Mary Gabriel. Carlton Wilborn, one of the dancers, played a priest Madonna interacted with. While reviewing the Houston concert, the staff of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; highlighted the number&#x27;s &quot;joyous gospel and heavy gothic organ scorings&quot;. Performances of the song can be found in &quot;Blond Ambition Japan Tour 90&quot;, taped in Yokohama, and in &quot;Blond Ambition World Tour Live&quot;, taped in Nice.

For the song&#x27;s performance on the Re-Invention World Tour, Madonna donned a plaid kilt and a black T-shirt that read &quot;Kabbalists Do It Better&quot; ―a nod to the music video. The number, which included a Ring a Ring o&#x27; Roses circle dance, was praised for its &quot;playfulness and innocence&quot; by &quot;Newsday&quot;″s Glenn Gamboa. On the MDNA Tour, the &quot;dark and apocalyptic&quot; performance of &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; sees Madonna &quot;manhandled and bound by military thugs&quot;. Timothy Finn, for &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot;, noted that it was the number that caused the &quot;first big eruption&quot; from the crowd. The performances of the song at the November 19–20 shows in Miami were recorded and released in the &quot;MDNA World Tour&quot; live album (2013). &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; was one of the songs performed during Madonna&#x27;s visit to &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot; in December 2016.

On the Madame X Tour, Madonna sang the first verse and chorus of &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; against a backdrop of &quot;Susanna and the Elders&quot; by Artemisia Gentileschi, following an &quot;impassioned tirade about abortion&quot;. She additionally changed the lyric &quot;I&#x27;m keeping my baby&quot; to &quot;I&#x27;m not keeping my baby&quot;. Selena Fragassi, from the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, applauded the singer for turning the song into a &quot;platform for pro-choice beliefs&quot;.

The song&#x27;s string introduction was used as a coda during the performance of &quot;Erotica&quot; (1992) on the Celebration Tour (2023―2024). In the sequence, Madonna simulates being masturbated by a dancer wearing the Jean-Paul Gaultier-designed corset from Blond Ambition, and recreates &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot;″s choreography from that tour. Reviewing one of the Seattle concerts, Michael Rietmulder from &quot;The Times&quot; lamented the absence of the full song.

== Covers ==
=== Kelly Osbourne ===

A pop-metal cover of &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; was recorded by Kelly Osbourne in 2002. In April of that year, MTV reported that Osbourne had recorded a &quot;rough&quot; demo of the song per her mother Sharon&#x27;s suggestion. Produced by her brother Jack, it featured Incubus members Mike Einziger and Jose Pasillas on guitar and drums, respectively. Executives for &quot;The Osbournes&quot; were impressed with the demo and requested a studio version, which would be included on a planned soundtrack to the series. According to Osbourne, series executives originally wanted her sister Aimee to record the song, but she declined and suggested Kelly do it instead. Osbourne then re-recorded the song without the involvement of her brother or the Incubus members. The rendition was included on &quot;The Osbourne Family Album&quot; soundtrack, and released as a single on August 13. The following year, it was added as a hidden bonus track to Osbourne&#x27;s debut album &quot;Shut Up&quot;. Explaining the cover, Osbourne said, &quot;I love Madonna. Who doesn&#x27;t?&quot;.

To promote the release, Osbourne shot a music video in Los Angeles, under the direction of Marcos Siega. She also appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, and sang the single live at the MTV Movie Awards, where her father introduced her to the audience. Critical reviews were generally mixed: For &quot;Billboard&quot;, Chuck Arnold considered it an &quot;aggressive post-punk anthem&quot; that&#x27;s &quot;certainly good for three minutes of steering-wheel banging on the way to the market&quot; and &quot;could just make Ozzy one proud daddy&quot;. &quot;NME&quot;″s Peter Robinson, on the other hand, said it made &quot;precisely zero sense&quot;, and panned it as a &quot;sorry mess [that&#x27;s] barely distinguishable&quot;. From &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Rob Brunner was also negative on his review, dismissing the cover as &quot;unnecessary&quot;.

Despite lukewarm reviews from critics, the cover was commercially successful: It peaked at number three in the United Kingdom and Australia, where it was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for having sold over 70,000 units. Furthermore, Osbourne&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; reached the top 40 in Austria, Germany, Italy, and New Zealand, the top 20 in Sweden, and the top 10 in Ireland and Finland.

=== Other artists and versions ===
In 1986, American singer &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic incorporated &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; into &quot;Polka Party!&quot;, one of the polka medleys taken from his album of the same name. Danny Aiello, who played Madonna&#x27;s father in the music video, released &quot;Papa Wants The Best For You&quot;, an answer song written by Artie Schroeck, told from a father&#x27;s point of view. According to the actor, the father and daughter from &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; seemed &quot;unable to talk to one another about something that is going to change their lives forever&quot;, thus he decided to make his own statement. Aiello recorded a video for the song, and even asked Madonna to participate, but she turned the offer down. In 1987, Dutch heavy metal band Angus released a rendition of the song under the title &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Freak!&quot;. That same year, Canadian singer Céline Dion sang the track on a Canadian sketch show, wearing a blonde wig and a black strapless getup like the one Madonna wore on the video.

In 2002, French–Dutch group Mad&#x27;House did a Eurodance take on the song for their album &quot;Absolutely Mad&quot;. One Year later, Irish band Picturehouse sang it for the first &quot;Even Better Than the Real Thing&quot; covers album. &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; was sampled at the beginning of American singer Mario Winans&#x27; song &quot;Never Really Was&quot; (2004). Renditions of the song for tribute albums include one by Brook Barros on &quot;The Music of Madonna&quot; (2005), and a jazz version on Bo.Da&#x27;s &quot; Plays Madonna in Jazz&quot; (2007). In 2009, Dianna Agron sang the track on &quot;Hairography&quot;, the eleventh episode of American television series &quot;Glee&quot;. Ten years later, Palestinian artist and activist Shahd Abusalama released &quot;Madonna Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, a parody that addressed the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and urged the singer to pull out of performing at the Eurovision Song Contest.

<text>The sergeant major of the Army (SMA) is a unique noncommissioned rank and position of office in the United States Army. The holder of this rank and position is the most senior enlisted soldier in the Army, unless an enlisted soldier is serving as the senior enlisted advisor to the chairman. The SMA is appointed to serve as a spokesman to address the issues of enlisted soldiers to all officers, from warrant officers and lieutenants to the Army&#x27;s highest positions. As such, they are the senior enlisted advisor to the chief of staff of the Army. The exact duties vary depending on the chief of staff, though much of the SMA&#x27;s time is spent traveling throughout the Army, observing training and talking with soldiers and their families.

Kenneth O. Preston held the rank from 15 January 2004 through 28 February 2011, the only incumbent to serve longer than five years. SMA Michael R. Weimer has held the office since 4 August 2023.

The SMA is designated a special paygrade above E-9. While the SMA is a non-commissioned officer, protocol places the SMA higher than all lieutenant generals (except for the Director of the Army Staff) and equivalent to a general for formal courtesies in addition to seating, billeting, transportation, and parking.

==History==
The rank and position were based on those of the sergeant major of the Marine Corps (established in its current incarnation on 23 May 1957). The Chief of Staff of the Army created the position in 1966 after asking leaders of the major commands for a personal recommendation. He asked that it not be considered a near-retirement type assignment. He listed seven duties and functions he expected the Sergeant Major to perform, including service as a personal adviser and assistant on matters pertaining to enlisted soldiers. From 4,700 proposed candidates, 21 nominees were selected. Finally chosen was the only one then serving in Vietnam, Sergeant Major William O. Wooldridge of the 1st Infantry Division.
The other services later followed, creating the positions of master chief petty officer of the Navy and chief master sergeant of the Air Force in 1967, master chief petty officer of the Coast Guard in 1969, senior enlisted advisor to the chairman in 2005, and chief master sergeant of the Space Force in 2020. These seven positions are collectively referred to as &quot;senior enlisted advisors&quot; (&quot;SEAs&quot;).

==Insignia==
The sergeant major of the Army, like counterparts in the other branches, wears a unique rank insignia, including a unique collar insignia (&quot;brass&quot;).
The collar insignia of the SMA is the shield portion of the collar insignia of an aide-de-camp to the Army Chief of Staff (less the surmounting eagle), placed upon an enlisted collar disk of gold color, one inch in diameter. The insignia worn by the first Sergeant Major of the Army William O. Wooldridge was hand-soldered by Colonel Jasper J. Wilson from the cannibalized insignia and enlisted collar brass of an aide. The insignia was approved on 4 July 1966. Originally, the SMA would wear the device on each collar, but he now wears the standard &quot;U.S.&quot; disk on his right collar as do all enlisted soldiers. This insignia is also worn in place of a unit insignia on the SMA&#x27;s beret, garrison cap, and pull-over sweater. The collar insignia of the senior enlisted advisor to the chairman (&quot;SEAC&quot;) of the JCS, approved 2 February 2006, is based directly upon that of the SMA, and features the shield of an aide de camp to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff (without the surmounting eagle), on a gold-colored disk.
The SMA&#x27;s cap device, worn on the front of the blue service cap (and, formerly, the white service cap; and, until 2011 the green service cap) is a gold-colored rendering of the United States&#x27; coat of arms, surrounded by a wreath. The cap device for all other U.S. Army enlisted soldiers is a gold-colored rendering of the United States&#x27; coat of arms on a gold-colored disk (males) or surrounded by a gold colored ring (females). The chief master sergeant of the Air Force has the same cap device as the SMA, but in silver-colored metal.

==Positional color==

The sergeant major of the Army, chief master sergeant of the Air Force, chief master sergeant of the Space Force, and the senior enlisted advisor to the chairman are the only members of the United States armed forces below the rank of brigadier general/rear admiral, lower half to be authorized a positional color (flag). First considered in 1992, the SMA&#x27;s color has been authorized since 22 March 1999. It is based on the design of his collar insignia and the positional flag of the Chief of Staff, Army. Like the SEAC&#x27;s collar brass, the SEAC&#x27;s positional color was patterned after the SMA&#x27;s color.

<doc id="563160" wikidata="Q1188724" url="?curid=563160" title="The Lexicon of Love">
<text>The Lexicon of Love is the debut studio album by the English pop band ABC. Released by Neutron Records on 21 June 1982, it entered the UK Albums Chart at number one, also topping the New Zealand and Finnish charts. Certified gold in the US, it went platinum in the UK where four singles reached the top 20; &quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot;, &quot;Poison Arrow&quot;, &quot;The Look of Love&quot; and &quot;All of My Heart&quot;, which &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked number one on their &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call New Pop!&quot; list.

The album has frequently been ranked as one of the greatest albums of the 1980s, and was included in the 2018 edition of Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Background, recording and release==
ABC was formed by Stephen Singleton and Mark White as electronic band Vice Versa. Joined by Martin Fry, the band eventually morphed into ABC. A debut single, &quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot;, followed in 1981; it was remixed by producer Trevor Horn for inclusion in &quot;The Lexicon of Love&quot;.

The album&#x27;s title originated in the headline of an &quot;NME&quot; review of an ABC gig. Songs were written collectively by the band, with arranger Anne Dudley also given a credit on some tracks. Lead vocalist Martin Fry said that they had wanted to fuse the attitude of punk and the sophistication of disco. While he has denied that it is a concept album, &quot;The Lexicon of Love&quot; features recurrent themes, including heartache and the struggle to make meaningful connections. &quot;Most of the other people were writing about electric pylons. We wanted to hark back to Cole Porter and his ilk, but in a very modern way,&quot; Fry said. 

The majority of the album was recorded at Sarm East Studios in London, with additional work done at Abbey Road, Townhouse, RAK and Good Earth studios. Produced by Horn and engineered by Gary Langan, it features orchestrations by Dudley and programming of the recently developed Fairlight CMI by J. J. Jeczalik. Horn says that he convinced the band to replace their bass player, Mark Lickley, with Brad Lang. &quot;I talked them into getting a better bass player, which maybe wasn&#x27;t a kind thing to do&quot;, he said, &quot;[but] Brad Lang was quite brilliant&quot;.

A year after its release, Horn, Langan, Dudley and Jeczalik formed the Art of Noise, and most of the production team and session musicians on the album formed the basis for the ZTT label. The cover photograph is by Gered Mankowitz. Distribution in the US and Japan was handled by Mercury Records; Vertigo Records released it in Canada and Europe.

==Performance, tours and further releases==
&quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot; (in its initial release produced by Steve Brown), &quot;All of My Heart&quot;, &quot;Poison Arrow&quot; and &quot;The Look of Love&quot; were all top-20 entries in the UK; the latter two also charted in the US, peaking at No. 25 and No. 18 respectively. The album reached No. 1 on the UK charts and peaked at No. 24 in the US charts.

The band was augmented by session musicians, and the 11-piece ensemble toured Europe, the US and Japan. The shows at Hammersmith Odeon in November 1982 were recorded for inclusion in the band&#x27;s film &quot;Mantrap&quot; which was released the following year. In 2004, a two-disc deluxe reissue including previously unreleased outtakes and early demos and a live performance of the album from 1982 was released by Neutron Records.

In 2009, ABC (with Fry as its sole member) performed the entire album at the Royal Albert Hall in London, accompanied by the BBC Concert Orchestra and conducted by Dudley. They were joined onstage by Horn. &quot;The Lexicon of Love&quot; was again performed live in its entirety on 18 December 2012 at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane to mark its 30th anniversary. Dudley reprised her role as conductor, performing with the Southbank Sinfonia Orchestra, and they concluded a four-date mini-tour at the same venue on 30 March 2014. Between 4 and 9 November 2015, the band and orchestra also performed at Liverpool&#x27;s Philharmonic Hall, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, Sheffield City Hall, the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London and Symphony Hall, Birmingham.

A sequel studio album &quot;The Lexicon of Love II&quot; was released on 27 May 2016. A Blu-ray audio disc with new Dolby Atmos and 5.1 surround sound Blu-ray remixes by Steven Wilson, as well as a remastered vinyl edition of the original mix, was released in August 2023.

==Critical reception==

The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number 1 and remained on the charts for 50 weeks. It was the fourth biggest selling album in the UK in 1982. Mitchell Cohen of &quot;Creem&quot; contemporaneously declared it to be a &quot;piece of sumptuous kitsch&quot;, adding that &quot;the whole shebang is so florid, so exaggerated, so damned catchy – you want to hear &quot;The Look of Love&quot; a second time before it&#x27;s even half over; it&#x27;s a casserole of about forty different pop hits and advertising jingles – that you may feel guilty for falling for it.&quot; Robert Christgau gave the album an &quot;A–&quot; rating, writing that &quot;Martin Fry&#x27;s candid camp and ad-man phrasing don&#x27;t fully justify his histrionic flights, but they do give him room to be clever, which is clearly his calling--some of these synthetic funk rhythms make me laugh out loud, and he&#x27;s an ace jingle writer&quot;. Don Waller of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the album, stating that Horn &quot;deserves a share of the applause, but the songs – credited to all four ABC members – are the real deal: apocalyptic, widescreen romances with more hooks than a meat-packing plant.&quot; Waller proclaimed that &quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot;, &quot;Poison Arrow&quot; and &quot;The Look of Love (Part I)&quot; call out for &quot;any one of a dozen contemporary black vocalists&quot;. &quot;ABC&#x27;s biggest drawback is Martin Fry&#x27;s singing, which borders on the effete,&quot; he wrote. 

Ken Tucker of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; was less enthusiastic, dismissing the album as &quot;prissy dance music, light on the beat and heavy on the sort of maundering crooning that the effete English rock musicians frequently mistake for passion.&quot;

Retrospectively, AllMusic found Horn&#x27;s production to be &quot;dense and noisy, but frequently beautiful&quot;, while &quot;the group&#x27;s emotional songs gave it a depth and coherence later Horn works (...) would lack.&quot; The site praised the band for &quot;[using] the sound to create moving dance-floor epics like &quot;Many Happy Returns&quot; which, like most of the album&#x27;s tracks, deserved to be a hit single.&quot; In a BBC review of the 2004 Deluxe Edition, Rob Webb stated that &quot;&quot;The Lexicon of Love&quot; stands as a landmark album in British pop&quot;, and &quot;underpins just what a sharp band ABC were: witty, lyrical and very, very funky&quot;. He found each song to be &quot;a love affair in miniature: some are touching (&quot;All of My Heart&quot;, &quot;Show Me&quot;), others a bitter invective at misplaced passion (&quot;Many Happy Returns&quot;)&quot;, and concluded that &quot;[dance] music had rarely been so literate.&quot; 

In &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot;, Colin Larkin awarded the &quot;superb&quot; album 5 stars (outstanding). Lauding the &quot;pristine pop songs&quot;, he declared that it &quot;remains a benchmark of 80s pop, and a formidable collection of melodramatic love songs assembled in one neat package.&quot; In a review of a 2005 retrospective of Trevor Horn&#x27;s work, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; concluded: &quot;If you don&#x27;t already own the original records, all can be found cheap and all (especially ABC&#x27;s &quot;Lexicon of Love&quot;) are essential documents of their era&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;The Lexicon of Love&quot; was ranked as the 4th best album of the 1980s by &quot;Record Mirror&quot; in December 1989. &quot;NME&quot; ranked it at number 15 on their &quot;Greatest Albums: The 1980&#x27;s&quot; in 1993, and at number 117 on their &quot;The Greatest albums of all time&quot; in 2013. &quot;Record Collector&quot; included it on their list &quot;70 Landmark Albums&quot; in 2019. &quot;Observer Music Monthly&quot; ranked it at number 42 on their &quot;Greatest British Albums&quot; in 2004. In 2024, &quot;Uncut&quot; placed it at number 26 on their list &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of the 1980&#x27;s&quot;.

<doc id="563161" wikidata="Q389844" url="?curid=563161" title="Membrane potential">
<text>Membrane potential (also transmembrane potential or membrane voltage) is the difference in electric potential between the interior and the exterior of a biological cell. It equals the interior potential minus the exterior potential. This is the energy (i.e. work) per charge which is required to move a (very small) positive charge at constant velocity across the cell membrane from the exterior to the interior. (If the charge is allowed to change velocity, the change of kinetic energy and production of radiation must be taken into account.)

Typical values of membrane potential, normally given in units of milli volts and denoted as mV, range from –80 mV to –40 mV. For such typical negative membrane potentials, positive work is required to move a positive charge from the interior to the exterior. However, thermal kinetic energy allows ions to overcome the potential difference. For a selectively permeable membrane, this permits a net flow against the gradient. This is a kind of osmosis.

==Description==

All animal cells are surrounded by a membrane composed of a lipid bilayer with proteins embedded in it. The membrane serves as both an insulator and a diffusion barrier to the movement of ions. Transmembrane proteins, also known as ion transporter or ion pump proteins, actively push ions across the membrane and establish concentration gradients across the membrane, and ion channels allow ions to move across the membrane down those concentration gradients. Ion pumps and ion channels are electrically analogous to a set of capacitors and resistors inserted in the membrane, and therefore create a voltage between the two sides of the membrane; acting somewhat like a memristor.

All plasma membranes have an electrical potential across them, with the inside usually negative with respect to the outside. The membrane potential has two basic functions. First, it allows a cell to function as a battery, providing power to operate a variety of &quot;molecular devices&quot; embedded in the membrane. Second, in electrically excitable cells such as neurons and muscle cells, it is used for transmitting signals between different parts of a cell.

===Signals in neurons and muscle cells===

Signals are generated in excitable cells by opening or closing of ion channels at one point in the membrane, producing a local change in the membrane potential. This change in the electric field can be quickly sensed by either adjacent or more distant ion channels in the membrane. Those ion channels can then open or close as a result of the potential change, reproducing the signal.

In non-excitable cells, and in excitable cells in their baseline states, the membrane potential is held at a relatively stable value, called the resting potential. For neurons, resting potential is defined as ranging from –80 to –70 millivolts; that is, the interior of a cell has a negative baseline voltage of a bit less than one-tenth of a volt. The opening and closing of ion channels can induce a departure from the resting potential. This is called a depolarization if the interior voltage becomes less negative (say from –70 mV to –60 mV), or a hyperpolarization if the interior voltage becomes more negative (say from –70 mV to –80 mV). In excitable cells, a sufficiently large depolarization can evoke an action potential, in which the membrane potential changes rapidly and significantly for a short time (on the order of 1 to 100 milliseconds), often reversing its polarity. Action potentials are generated by the activation of certain voltage-gated ion channels.

In neurons, the factors that influence the membrane potential are diverse. They include numerous types of ion channels, some of which are chemically gated and some of which are voltage-gated. Because voltage-gated ion channels are controlled by the membrane potential, while the membrane potential itself is influenced by these same ion channels, feedback loops that allow for complex temporal dynamics arise, including oscillations and regenerative events such as action potentials.

===Ion concentration gradients===

Differences in the concentrations of ions on opposite sides of a cellular membrane lead to a voltage called the membrane potential.

Many ions have a concentration gradient across the membrane, including potassium (K+), which is at a high concentration inside and a low concentration outside the membrane. Sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions are at high concentrations in the extracellular region, and low concentrations in the intracellular regions. These concentration gradients provide the potential energy to drive the formation of the membrane potential. This voltage is established when the membrane has permeability to one or more ions.

In the simplest case, illustrated in the top diagram (&quot;Ion concentration gradients&quot;), if the membrane is selectively permeable to potassium, these positively charged ions can diffuse down the concentration gradient to the outside of the cell, leaving behind uncompensated negative charges. This separation of charges is what causes the membrane potential.

The system as a whole is electro-neutral. The uncompensated positive charges outside the cell, and the uncompensated negative charges inside the cell, physically line up on the membrane surface and attract each other across the lipid bilayer. Thus, the membrane potential is physically located only in the immediate vicinity of the membrane. It is the separation of these charges across the membrane that is the basis of the membrane voltage.

The top diagram is only an approximation of the ionic contributions to the membrane potential. Other ions including sodium, chloride, calcium, and others play a more minor role, even though they have strong concentration gradients, because they have more limited permeability than potassium.

==Physical basis==
The membrane potential in a cell derives ultimately from two factors: electrical force and diffusion. Electrical force arises from the mutual attraction between particles with opposite electrical charges (positive and negative) and the mutual repulsion between particles with the same type of charge (both positive or both negative). Diffusion arises from the statistical tendency of particles to redistribute from regions where they are highly concentrated to regions where the concentration is low.

===Voltage===

Voltage, which is synonymous with &quot;difference in electrical potential&quot;, is the ability to drive an electric current across a resistance. Indeed, the simplest definition of a voltage is given by Ohm&#x27;s law: V=IR, where V is voltage, I is current and R is resistance. If a voltage source such as a battery is placed in an electrical circuit, the higher the voltage of the source the greater the amount of current that it will drive across the available resistance. The functional significance of voltage lies only in potential &quot;differences&quot; between two points in a circuit. The idea of a voltage at a single point is meaningless. It is conventional in electronics to assign a voltage of zero to some arbitrarily chosen element of the circuit, and then assign voltages for other elements measured relative to that zero point. There is no significance in which element is chosen as the zero point—the function of a circuit depends only on the differences not on voltages &quot;per se&quot;. However, in most cases and by convention, the zero level is most often assigned to the portion of a circuit that is in contact with ground.

The same principle applies to voltage in cell biology. In electrically active tissue, the potential difference between any two points can be measured by inserting an electrode at each point, for example one inside and one outside the cell, and connecting both electrodes to the leads of what is in essence a specialized voltmeter. By convention, the zero potential value is assigned to the outside of the cell and the sign of the potential difference between the outside and the inside is determined by the potential of the inside relative to the outside zero.

In mathematical terms, the definition of voltage begins with the concept of an electric field , a vector field assigning a magnitude and direction to each point in space. In many situations, the electric field is a conservative field, which means that it can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar function , that is, . This scalar field is referred to as the voltage distribution. The definition allows for an arbitrary constant of integration—this is why absolute values of voltage are not meaningful. In general, electric fields can be treated as conservative only if magnetic fields do not significantly influence them, but this condition usually applies well to biological tissue.

Because the electric field is the gradient of the voltage distribution, rapid changes in voltage within a small region imply a strong electric field; on the converse, if the voltage remains approximately the same over a large region, the electric fields in that region must be weak. A strong electric field, equivalent to a strong voltage gradient, implies that a strong force is exerted on any charged particles that lie within the region.

===Ions and the forces driving their motion===


Electrical signals within biological organisms are, in general, driven by ions. The most important cations for the action potential are sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+). Both of these are &quot;monovalent&quot; cations that carry a single positive charge. Action potentials can also involve calcium (Ca2+), which is a &quot;divalent&quot; cation that carries a double positive charge. The chloride anion (Cl−) plays a major role in the action potentials of some algae, but plays a negligible role in the action potentials of most animals.

Ions cross the cell membrane under two influences: diffusion and electric fields. A simple example wherein two solutions—A and B—are separated by a porous barrier illustrates that diffusion will ensure that they will eventually mix into equal solutions. This mixing occurs because of the difference in their concentrations. The region with high concentration will diffuse out toward the region with low concentration. To extend the example, let solution A have 30 sodium ions and 30 chloride ions. Also, let solution B have only 20 sodium ions and 20 chloride ions. Assuming the barrier allows both types of ions to travel through it, then a steady state will be reached whereby both solutions have 25 sodium ions and 25 chloride ions. If, however, the porous barrier is selective to which ions are let through, then diffusion alone will not determine the resulting solution. Returning to the previous example, let&#x27;s now construct a barrier that is permeable only to sodium ions. Now, only sodium is allowed to diffuse cross the barrier from its higher concentration in solution A to the lower concentration in solution B. This will result in a greater accumulation of sodium ions than chloride ions in solution B and a lesser number of sodium ions than chloride ions in solution A.

This means that there is a net positive charge in solution B from the higher concentration of positively charged sodium ions than negatively charged chloride ions. Likewise, there is a net negative charge in solution A from the greater concentration of negative chloride ions than positive sodium ions. Since opposite charges attract and like charges repel, the ions are now also influenced by electrical fields as well as forces of diffusion. Therefore, positive sodium ions will be less likely to travel to the now-more-positive B solution and remain in the now-more-negative A solution. The point at which the forces of the electric fields completely counteract the force due to diffusion is called the equilibrium potential. At this point, the net flow of the specific ion (in this case sodium) is zero.

===Plasma membranes===
Every cell is enclosed in a plasma membrane, which has the structure of a lipid bilayer with many types of large molecules embedded in it. Because it is made of lipid molecules, the plasma membrane intrinsically has a high electrical resistivity, in other words a low intrinsic permeability to ions. However, some of the molecules embedded in the membrane are capable either of actively transporting ions from one side of the membrane to the other or of providing channels through which they can move.

In electrical terminology, the plasma membrane functions as a combined resistor and capacitor. Resistance arises from the fact that the membrane impedes the movement of charges across it. Capacitance arises from the fact that the lipid bilayer is so thin that an accumulation of charged particles on one side gives rise to an electrical force that pulls oppositely charged particles toward the other side. The capacitance of the membrane is relatively unaffected by the molecules that are embedded in it, so it has a more or less invariant value estimated at 2 μF/cm2 (the total capacitance of a patch of membrane is proportional to its area). The conductance of a pure lipid bilayer is so low, on the other hand, that in biological situations it is always dominated by the conductance of alternative pathways provided by embedded molecules. Thus, the capacitance of the membrane is more or less fixed, but the resistance is highly variable.

The thickness of a plasma membrane is estimated to be about 7-8 nanometers. Because the membrane is so thin, it does not take a very large transmembrane voltage to create a strong electric field within it. Typical membrane potentials in animal cells are on the order of 100 millivolts (that is, one tenth of a volt), but calculations show that this generates an electric field close to the maximum that the membrane can sustain—it has been calculated that a voltage difference much larger than 200 millivolts could cause dielectric breakdown, that is, arcing across the membrane.

===Facilitated diffusion and transport===
The resistance of a pure lipid bilayer to the passage of ions across it is very high, but structures embedded in the membrane can greatly enhance ion movement, either actively or passively, via mechanisms called facilitated transport and facilitated diffusion. The two types of structure that play the largest roles are ion channels and ion pumps, both usually formed from assemblages of protein molecules. Ion channels provide passageways through which ions can move. In most cases, an ion channel is permeable only to specific types of ions (for example, sodium and potassium but not chloride or calcium), and sometimes the permeability varies depending on the direction of ion movement. Ion pumps, also known as ion transporters or carrier proteins, actively transport specific types of ions from one side of the membrane to the other, sometimes using energy derived from metabolic processes to do so.

===Ion pumps===

Ion pumps are integral membrane proteins that carry out active transport, i.e., use cellular energy (ATP) to &quot;pump&quot; the ions against their concentration gradient. Such ion pumps take in ions from one side of the membrane (decreasing its concentration there) and release them on the other side (increasing its concentration there).

The ion pump most relevant to the action potential is the sodium–potassium pump, which transports three sodium ions out of the cell and two potassium ions in. As a consequence, the concentration of potassium ions K+ inside the neuron is roughly 30-fold larger than the outside concentration, whereas the sodium concentration outside is roughly five-fold larger than inside. In a similar manner, other ions have different concentrations inside and outside the neuron, such as calcium, chloride and magnesium.

If the numbers of each type of ion were equal, the sodium–potassium pump would be electrically neutral, but, because of the three-for-two exchange, it gives a net movement of one positive charge from intracellular to extracellular for each cycle, thereby contributing to a positive voltage difference. The pump has three effects: (1) it makes the sodium concentration high in the extracellular space and low in the intracellular space; (2) it makes the potassium concentration high in the intracellular space and low in the extracellular space; (3) it gives the intracellular space a negative voltage with respect to the extracellular space.

The sodium-potassium pump is relatively slow in operation. If a cell were initialized with equal concentrations of sodium and potassium everywhere, it would take hours for the pump to establish equilibrium. The pump operates constantly, but becomes progressively less efficient as the concentrations of sodium and potassium available for pumping are reduced.

Ion pumps influence the action potential only by establishing the relative ratio of intracellular and extracellular ion concentrations. The action potential involves mainly the opening and closing of ion channels not ion pumps. If the ion pumps are turned off by removing their energy source, or by adding an inhibitor such as ouabain, the axon can still fire hundreds of thousands of action potentials before their amplitudes begin to decay significantly. In particular, ion pumps play no significant role in the repolarization of the membrane after an action potential.

Another functionally important ion pump is the sodium-calcium exchanger. This pump operates in a conceptually similar way to the sodium-potassium pump, except that in each cycle it exchanges three Na+ from the extracellular space for one Ca++ from the intracellular space. Because the net flow of charge is inward, this pump runs &quot;downhill&quot;, in effect, and therefore does not require any energy source except the membrane voltage. Its most important effect is to pump calcium outward—it also allows an inward flow of sodium, thereby counteracting the sodium-potassium pump, but, because overall sodium and potassium concentrations are much higher than calcium concentrations, this effect is relatively unimportant. The net result of the sodium-calcium exchanger is that in the resting state, intracellular calcium concentrations become very low.

===Ion channels===

Ion channels are integral membrane proteins with a pore through which ions can travel between extracellular space and cell interior. Most channels are specific (selective) for one ion; for example, most potassium channels are characterized by 1000:1 selectivity ratio for potassium over sodium, though potassium and sodium ions have the same charge and differ only slightly in their radius. The channel pore is typically so small that ions must pass through it in single-file order. Channel pores can be either open or closed for ion passage, although a number of channels demonstrate various sub-conductance levels. When a channel is open, ions permeate through the channel pore down the transmembrane concentration gradient for that particular ion. Rate of ionic flow through the channel, i.e. single-channel current amplitude, is determined by the maximum channel conductance and electrochemical driving force for that ion, which is the difference between the instantaneous value of the membrane potential and the value of the reversal potential.

A channel may have several different states (corresponding to different conformations of the protein), but each such state is either open or closed. In general, closed states correspond either to a contraction of the pore—making it impassable to the ion—or to a separate part of the protein, stoppering the pore. For example, the voltage-dependent sodium channel undergoes &quot;inactivation&quot;, in which a portion of the protein swings into the pore, sealing it. This inactivation shuts off the sodium current and plays a critical role in the action potential.

Ion channels can be classified by how they respond to their environment. For example, the ion channels involved in the action potential are &quot;voltage-sensitive channels&quot;; they open and close in response to the voltage across the membrane. &quot;Ligand-gated channels&quot; form another important class; these ion channels open and close in response to the binding of a ligand molecule, such as a neurotransmitter. Other ion channels open and close with mechanical forces. Still other ion channels—such as those of sensory neurons—open and close in response to other stimuli, such as light, temperature or pressure.

====Leakage channels====
Leakage channels are the simplest type of ion channel, in that their permeability is more or less constant. The types of leakage channels that have the greatest significance in neurons are potassium and chloride channels. Even these are not perfectly constant in their properties: First, most of them are voltage-dependent in the sense that they conduct better in one direction than the other (in other words, they are rectifiers); second, some of them are capable of being shut off by chemical ligands even though they do not require ligands in order to operate.

====Ligand-gated channels====
Ligand-gated ion channels are channels whose permeability is greatly increased when some type of chemical ligand binds to the protein structure. Animal cells contain hundreds, if not thousands, of types of these. A large subset function as neurotransmitter receptors—they occur at postsynaptic sites, and the chemical ligand that gates them is released by the presynaptic axon terminal. One example of this type is the AMPA receptor, a receptor for the neurotransmitter glutamate that when activated allows passage of sodium and potassium ions. Another example is the GABAA receptor, a receptor for the neurotransmitter GABA that when activated allows passage of chloride ions.

Neurotransmitter receptors are activated by ligands that appear in the extracellular area, but there are other types of ligand-gated channels that are controlled by interactions on the intracellular side.

====Voltage-dependent channels====
Voltage-gated ion channels, also known as &quot;voltage dependent ion channels&quot;, are channels whose permeability is influenced by the membrane potential. They form another very large group, with each member having a particular ion selectivity and a particular voltage dependence. Many are also time-dependent—in other words, they do not respond immediately to a voltage change but only after a delay.

One of the most important members of this group is a type of voltage-gated sodium channel that underlies action potentials—these are sometimes called &quot;Hodgkin-Huxley sodium channels&quot; because they were initially characterized by Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley in their Nobel Prize-winning studies of the physiology of the action potential. The channel is closed at the resting voltage level, but opens abruptly when the voltage exceeds a certain threshold, allowing a large influx of sodium ions that produces a very rapid change in the membrane potential. Recovery from an action potential is partly dependent on a type of voltage-gated potassium channel that is closed at the resting voltage level but opens as a consequence of the large voltage change produced during the action potential.

===Reversal potential===
The reversal potential (or &quot;equilibrium potential&quot;) of an ion is the value of transmembrane voltage at which diffusive and electrical forces counterbalance, so that there is no net ion flow across the membrane. This means that the transmembrane voltage exactly opposes the force of diffusion of the ion, such that the net current of the ion across the membrane is zero and unchanging. The reversal potential is important because it gives the voltage that acts on channels permeable to that ion—in other words, it gives the voltage that the ion concentration gradient generates when it acts as a battery.

The equilibrium potential of a particular ion is usually designated by the notation &quot;E&quot;ion.The equilibrium potential for any ion can be calculated using the Nernst equation. For example, reversal potential for potassium ions will be as follows:

:formula_1

where
* &quot;E&quot;eq,K+= equilibrium potential for potassium, measured in volts
* &quot;R&quot; = universal gas constant, equal to 8.314 joules·K−1·mol−1
* &quot;T&quot; = absolute temperature, measured in kelvins (= K = degrees Celsius + 273.15)
* &quot;z&quot; = number of elementary charges of the ion in question involved in the reaction
* &quot;F&quot; = Faraday constant, equal to 96,485 coulombs·mol−1 or J·V−1·mol−1
* [K+]o= extracellular concentration of potassium, measured in mol·m−3 or mmol·l−1
* [K+]i= intracellular concentration of potassium

Even if two different ions have the same charge (i.e., K+ and Na+), they can still have very different equilibrium potentials, provided their outside and/or inside concentrations differ. Take, for example, the equilibrium potentials of potassium and sodium in neurons. The potassium equilibrium potential &quot;E&quot;K is −84 mV with 5 mM potassium outside and 140 mM inside. On the other hand, the sodium equilibrium potential, &quot;E&quot;Na, is approximately +66 mV with approximately 12 mM sodium inside and 140 mM outside.

=== Changes to membrane potential during development ===
A neuron&#x27;s resting membrane potential actually changes during the development of an organism. In order for a neuron to eventually adopt its full adult function, its potential must be tightly regulated during development. As an organism progresses through development the resting membrane potential becomes more negative. Glial cells are also differentiating and proliferating as development progresses in the brain. The addition of these glial cells increases the organism&#x27;s ability to regulate extracellular potassium. The drop in extracellular potassium can lead to a decrease in membrane potential of 35 mV.

===Cell excitability===

Cell excitability is the change in membrane potential that is necessary for cellular responses in various tissues. Cell excitability is a property that is induced during early embriogenesis. Excitability of a cell has also been defined as the ease with which a response may be triggered. The resting and threshold potentials forms the basis of cell excitability and these processes are fundamental for the generation of graded and action potentials.

The most important regulators of cell excitability are the extracellular electrolyte concentrations (i.e. Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl−, Mg2+) and associated proteins. Important proteins that regulate cell excitability are voltage-gated ion channels, ion transporters (e.g. Na+/K+-ATPase, magnesium transporters, acid–base transporters), membrane receptors and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels. For example, potassium channels and calcium-sensing receptors are important regulators of excitability in neurons, cardiac myocytes and many other excitable cells like astrocytes. Calcium ion is also the most important second messenger in excitable cell signaling. Activation of synaptic receptors initiates long-lasting changes in neuronal excitability. Thyroid, adrenal and other hormones also regulate cell excitability, for example, progesterone and estrogen modulate myometrial smooth muscle cell excitability.

Many cell types are considered to have an excitable membrane. Excitable cells are neurons, muscle (cardiac, skeletal, smooth), vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, juxtaglomerular cells, interstitial cells of Cajal, many types of epithelial cells (e.g. beta cells, alpha cells, delta cells, enteroendocrine cells, pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, pinealocytes), glial cells (e.g. astrocytes), mechanoreceptor cells (e.g. hair cells and Merkel cells), chemoreceptor cells (e.g. glomus cells, taste receptors), some plant cells and possibly immune cells. Astrocytes display a form of non-electrical excitability based on intracellular calcium variations related to the expression of several receptors through which they can detect the synaptic signal. In neurons, there are different membrane properties in some portions of the cell, for example, dendritic excitability endows neurons with the capacity for coincidence detection of spatially separated inputs.

===Equivalent circuit===

Electrophysiologists model the effects of ionic concentration differences, ion channels, and membrane capacitance in terms of an equivalent circuit, which is intended to represent the electrical properties of a small patch of membrane. The equivalent circuit consists of a capacitor in parallel with four pathways each consisting of a battery in series with a variable conductance. The capacitance is determined by the properties of the lipid bilayer, and is taken to be fixed. Each of the four parallel pathways comes from one of the principal ions, sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium. The voltage of each ionic pathway is determined by the concentrations of the ion on each side of the membrane; see the Reversal potential section above. The conductance of each ionic pathway at any point in time is determined by the states of all the ion channels that are potentially permeable to that ion, including leakage channels, ligand-gated channels, and voltage-gated ion channels.
For fixed ion concentrations and fixed values of ion channel conductance, the equivalent circuit can be further reduced, using the Goldman equation as described below, to a circuit containing a capacitance in parallel with a battery and conductance. In electrical terms, this is a type of RC circuit (resistance-capacitance circuit), and its electrical properties are very simple. Starting from any initial state, the current flowing across either the conductance or the capacitance decays with an exponential time course, with a time constant of , where is the capacitance of the membrane patch, and is the net resistance. For realistic situations, the time constant usually lies in the 1—100 millisecond range. In most cases, changes in the conductance of ion channels occur on a faster time scale, so an RC circuit is not a good approximation; however, the differential equation used to model a membrane patch is commonly a modified version of the RC circuit equation.

==Resting potential==
When the membrane potential of a cell goes for a long period of time without changing significantly, it is referred to as a resting potential or resting voltage. This term is used for the membrane potential of non-excitable cells, but also for the membrane potential of excitable cells in the absence of excitation. In excitable cells, the other possible states are graded membrane potentials (of variable amplitude), and action potentials, which are large, all-or-nothing rises in membrane potential that usually follow a fixed time course. Excitable cells include neurons, muscle cells, and some secretory cells in glands. Even in other types of cells, however, the membrane voltage can undergo changes in response to environmental or intracellular stimuli. For example, depolarization of the plasma membrane appears to be an important step in programmed cell death.

The interactions that generate the resting potential are modeled by the Goldman equation. This is similar in form to the Nernst equation shown above, in that it is based on the charges of the ions in question, as well as the difference between their inside and outside concentrations. However, it also takes into consideration the relative permeability of the plasma membrane to each ion in question.

:formula_2

The three ions that appear in this equation are potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), and chloride (Cl−). Calcium is omitted, but can be added to deal with situations in which it plays a significant role. Being an anion, the chloride terms are treated differently from the cation terms; the intracellular concentration is in the numerator, and the extracellular concentration in the denominator, which is reversed from the cation terms. &quot;P&quot;i stands for the relative permeability of the ion type i.

In essence, the Goldman formula expresses the membrane potential as a weighted average of the reversal potentials for the individual ion types, weighted by permeability. (Although the membrane potential changes about 100 mV during an action potential, the concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell do not change significantly. They remain close to their respective concentrations when then membrane is at resting potential.) In most animal cells, the permeability to potassium is much higher in the resting state than the permeability to sodium. As a consequence, the resting potential is usually close to the potassium reversal potential. The permeability to chloride can be high enough to be significant, but, unlike the other ions, chloride is not actively pumped, and therefore equilibrates at a reversal potential very close to the resting potential determined by the other ions.

Values of resting membrane potential in most animal cells usually vary between the potassium reversal potential (usually around -80 mV) and around -40 mV. The resting potential in excitable cells (capable of producing action potentials) is usually near -60 mV—more depolarized voltages would lead to spontaneous generation of action potentials. Immature or undifferentiated cells show highly variable values of resting voltage, usually significantly more positive than in differentiated cells. In such cells, the resting potential value correlates with the degree of differentiation: undifferentiated cells in some cases may not show any transmembrane voltage difference at all.

Maintenance of the resting potential can be metabolically costly for a cell because of its requirement for active pumping of ions to counteract losses due to leakage channels. The cost is highest when the cell function requires an especially depolarized value of membrane voltage. For example, the resting potential in daylight-adapted blowfly (&quot;Calliphora vicina&quot;) photoreceptors can be as high as -30 mV. This elevated membrane potential allows the cells to respond very rapidly to visual inputs; the cost is that maintenance of the resting potential may consume more than 20% of overall cellular ATP.

On the other hand, the high resting potential in undifferentiated cells does not necessarily incur a high metabolic cost. This apparent paradox is resolved by examination of the origin of that resting potential. Little-differentiated cells are characterized by extremely high input resistance, which implies that few leakage channels are present at this stage of cell life. As an apparent result, potassium permeability becomes similar to that for sodium ions, which places resting potential in-between the reversal potentials for sodium and potassium as discussed above. The reduced leakage currents also mean there is little need for active pumping in order to compensate, therefore low metabolic cost.

==Graded potentials==
As explained above, the potential at any point in a cell&#x27;s membrane is determined by the ion concentration differences between the intracellular and extracellular areas, and by the permeability of the membrane to each type of ion. The ion concentrations do not normally change very quickly (with the exception of Ca2+, where the baseline intracellular concentration is so low that even a small influx may increase it by orders of magnitude), but the permeabilities of the ions can change in a fraction of a millisecond, as a result of activation of ligand-gated ion channels. The change in membrane potential can be either large or small, depending on how many ion channels are activated and what type they are, and can be either long or short, depending on the lengths of time that the channels remain open. Changes of this type are referred to as graded potentials, in contrast to action potentials, which have a fixed amplitude and time course.

As can be derived from the Goldman equation shown above, the effect of increasing the permeability of a membrane to a particular type of ion shifts the membrane potential toward the reversal potential for that ion. Thus, opening Na+ channels shifts the membrane potential toward the Na+ reversal potential, which is usually around +100 mV. Likewise, opening K+ channels shifts the membrane potential toward about –90 mV, and opening Cl− channels shifts it toward about –70 mV (resting potential of most membranes). Thus, Na+ channels shift the membrane potential in a positive direction, K+ channels shift it in a negative direction (except when the membrane is hyperpolarized to a value more negative than the K+ reversal potential), and Cl− channels tend to shift it towards the resting potential.
Graded membrane potentials are particularly important in neurons, where they are produced by synapses—a temporary change in membrane potential produced by activation of a synapse by a single graded or action potential is called a postsynaptic potential. Neurotransmitters that act to open Na+ channels typically cause the membrane potential to become more positive, while neurotransmitters that activate K+ channels typically cause it to become more negative; those that inhibit these channels tend to have the opposite effect.

Whether a postsynaptic potential is considered excitatory or inhibitory depends on the reversal potential for the ions of that current, and the threshold for the cell to fire an action potential (around –50mV). A postsynaptic current with a reversal potential above threshold, such as a typical Na+ current, is considered excitatory. A current with a reversal potential below threshold, such as a typical K+ current, is considered inhibitory. A current with a reversal potential above the resting potential, but below threshold, will not by itself elicit action potentials, but will produce subthreshold membrane potential oscillations. Thus, neurotransmitters that act to open Na+ channels produce excitatory postsynaptic potentials, or EPSPs, whereas neurotransmitters that act to open K+ or Cl− channels typically produce inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, or IPSPs. When multiple types of channels are open within the same time period, their postsynaptic potentials summate (are added together).

==Other values==
From the viewpoint of biophysics, the &quot;resting&quot; membrane potential is merely the membrane potential that results from the membrane permeabilities that predominate when the cell is resting. The above equation of weighted averages always applies, but the following approach may be more easily visualized.
At any given moment, there are two factors for an ion that determine how much influence that ion will have over the membrane potential of a cell:
# That ion&#x27;s driving force
# That ion&#x27;s permeability

If the driving force is high, then the ion is being &quot;pushed&quot; across the membrane. If the permeability is high, it will be easier for the ion to diffuse across the membrane.
* Driving force is the net electrical force available to move that ion across the membrane. It is calculated as the difference between the voltage that the ion &quot;wants&quot; to be at (its equilibrium potential) and the actual membrane potential (&quot;E&quot;m). So, in formal terms, the driving force for an ion = &quot;E&quot;m - &quot;E&quot;ion
* For example, at our earlier calculated resting potential of −73 mV, the driving force on potassium is 7 mV : (−73 mV) − (−80 mV) = 7 mV. The driving force on sodium would be (−73 mV) − (60 mV) = −133 mV.
* Permeability is a measure of how easily an ion can cross the membrane. It is normally measured as the (electrical) conductance and the unit, siemens, corresponds to 1 C·s−1·V−1, that is one coulomb per second per volt of potential.

So, in a resting membrane, while the driving force for potassium is low, its permeability is very high. Sodium has a huge driving force but almost no resting permeability. In this case, potassium carries about 20 times more current than sodium, and thus has 20 times more influence over &quot;E&quot;m than does sodium.

However, consider another case—the peak of the action potential. Here, permeability to Na is high and K permeability is relatively low. Thus, the membrane moves to near &quot;E&quot;Na and far from &quot;E&quot;K.

The more ions are permeant the more complicated it becomes to predict the membrane potential. However, this can be done using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation or the weighted means equation. By plugging in the concentration gradients and the permeabilities of the ions at any instant in time, one can determine the membrane potential at that moment. What the GHK equations means is that, at any time, the value of the membrane potential will be a weighted average of the equilibrium potentials of all permeant ions. The &quot;weighting&quot; is the ions relative permeability across the membrane.

==Effects and implications==
While cells expend energy to transport ions and establish a transmembrane potential, they use this potential in turn to transport other ions and metabolites such as sugar. The transmembrane potential of the mitochondria drives the production of ATP, which is the common currency of biological energy.

Cells may draw on the energy they store in the resting potential to drive action potentials or other forms of excitation. These changes in the membrane potential enable communication with other cells (as with action potentials) or initiate changes inside the cell, which happens in an egg when it is fertilized by a sperm.

Changes in the dielectric properties of plasma membrane may act as hallmark of underlying conditions such as diabetes and dyslipidemia.

In neuronal cells, an action potential begins with a rush of sodium ions into the cell through sodium channels, resulting in depolarization, while recovery involves an outward rush of potassium through potassium channels. Both of these fluxes occur by passive diffusion.

 A dose of salt may trigger the still-working neurons of a fresh cut of meat into firing, causing muscle spasms.&lt;ref name=&quot;scientificamerican/20110728/instant-zombie&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sciencealert/beef-pulses&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;newshub/meat-pulsate&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nypost/meat-spasming&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>Seán Flanagan (26 January 1922 – 5 February 1993) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician and Gaelic footballer who served as Minister for Health from 1966 to 1969, Minister for Lands from 1969 to 1973 and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1965 to 1966. He served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Connacht–Ulster constituency from 1979 to 1989. He was as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Mayo South constituency from 1951 to 1969 and for the Mayo East constituency from 1969 to 1977.

==Early life==
Flanagan was born in Coolnaha, Aghamore, Ballyhaunis, County Mayo in 1922. He was educated locally, then later at St Jarlath&#x27;s College in Tuam, County Galway, where he showed enthusiasm for sport. He won two Connacht championship medals with the college in 1939 and 1940. He briefly studied at the seminary at Clonliffe College in Dublin and then enrolled in University College Dublin, where he studied law and qualified as a solicitor.

==Football career==
Flanagan also played senior Gaelic football for Mayo. He captained the All-Ireland final-winning sides of 1950 and 1951 and won five Connacht senior championship medals in all. He also won two National Football League titles in 1949 and 1954. While still a footballer, Flanagan entered into a career in politics.

In recognition of his skills and long-running contribution to the sport, Flanagan was awarded the 1992 All-Time All Star Award as no GAA All Stars Awards were being issued at the time of his playing career. In 1984, the Gaelic Athletic Association centenary year he was honoured by being named on their Football Team of the Century. In 1999, he was again honoured by the GAA by being named on their Gaelic Football Team of the Millennium.

==Political career==
Flanagan came from a Fianna Fáil family and was recruited into the party in east Mayo. He was elected a Fianna Fáil TD for Mayo South at the 1951 general election, and won a seat—first there, then from 1969 in Mayo East—at each subsequent election until he lost his seat at the 1977 general election.

Flanagan rose rapidly through the party ranks and was appointed a Parliamentary Secretary under Taoiseach Seán Lemass in 1959. Alongside Charles Haughey and Brian Lenihan, he was part of the &quot;mohair suite&quot; brigade of young moderniser TDs. In the Fianna Fáil leadership election in 1966 Flanagan supported Jack Lynch. When Lynch became Taoiseach, Flanagan was promoted to the Cabinet as Minister for Health. Three years later in 1969, he became Minister for Lands. Flanagan lost his seat at the 1977 general election, and effectively retired from domestic politics; however, he was elected to the European Parliament in the first direct elections in 1979. He was re-elected in 1984, and retired from politics in 1989.

Flanagan died on 5 February 1993, at the age of 71.

<doc id="563164" wikidata="Q5145305" url="?curid=563164" title="Colin MacIntyre">
<text>Colin MacIntyre (born 8 April 1971) is a Scottish musician and novelist. A singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist, he has released five albums under the name Mull Historical Society as well as two albums under his own name. His most successful album, Mull Historical Society&#x27;s &quot;Us&quot; (2003), reached number 19 in the UK Albums Chart. His debut novel, &quot;The Letters of Ivor Punch&quot;, was published in 2015.

==Early life and education==
MacIntyre&#x27;s father Kenny Macintyre was born in Oban then moved to Mull, an island off the west coast of Scotland. He was a bank clerk, a gift-shop operator and then BBC Scotland&#x27;s Political Correspondent for ten years. His paternal grandfather, Angus Macintyre, was a poet and his brother Kenny Macintyre is a radio journalist for BBC Scotland Sport.

MacIntyre was born on 8 April 1971 on Mull. He wanted to be a musician from a young age and grew up listening to his uncle&#x27;s covers band. He formed a covers band of his own called Trax, later renamed Love Sick Zombies, while still at Tobermory Primary School. He was influenced by his art teacher at Tobermory High School, and considered going to art school. He also attended Oban High School. In the late 1980s he and his brother moved to Glasgow, where he attended Glasgow Caledonian University, trained with Queen&#x27;s Park F.C., worked for a stockbroker, and then for telephone company BT&#x27;s 192 directory enquiries service for three years.

==Musical career==
MacIntyre coined the name Mull Historical Society after seeing an advert for an organisation which has since changed its name to the Mull Historical and Archaeological Society. His first album under the name, &quot;Loss&quot; in 2001, was inspired by his upbringing on Mull and the sudden death of his father in 1999. It contains samples from a Caledonian MacBrayne ferry and the waves in Calgary Bay in Mull. &quot;Q&quot; magazine named &quot;Loss&quot; as one of its top 50 albums of 2001. &quot;Public Service Announcer&quot; is about MacIntyre&#x27;s time at BT, and is based on the rhythm of a telephone ring tone. &quot;Barcode Bypass&quot; is about a small shopkeeper threatened by the supermarkets. &quot;Watching Xanadu&quot;, a song about watching the film &quot;Xanadu&quot;, was included on STV&#x27;s &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Greatest Album&quot; as one of the top tracks of the 2000s. In 2000-01 Mull Historical Society played support for Elbow and the Strokes, and in 2002 for R.E.M., the Delgados and The Polyphonic Spree. MacIntyre was named as &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Top Creative Talent&quot; at the Glenfiddich Spirit of Scotland Awards in 2002.

The second album, &quot;Us&quot;, came out in 2003 to generally positive reviews; &quot;NME&quot; called it &quot;a joyous slice of orchestral prozac&quot;. The track &quot;The Supermarket Strikes Back&quot; is a sequel to &quot;Barcode Bypass&quot; from &quot;Loss&quot;. After the album his record label, Warners, dropped him. The third Mull Historical Society album, &quot;This Is Hope&quot;, was released on B-Unique Records in 2004. It was inspired by a two-month visit to the United States, ending in New Orleans. One of its songs is about the death of David Kelly, and the album also includes a recording of MacIntyre&#x27;s grandmother. The covers of &quot;Loss&quot; and &quot;This Is Hope&quot;, and several of the videos and stage sets from this era, feature &#x27;The Giant Dog With The Wig&#x27;, which MacIntyre created using MS Paint. In January 2005, Mull Historical Society was voted the twelfth-greatest Scottish band of all time by &quot;The List&quot; magazine.

MacIntyre released &quot;The Water&quot; under his own name in 2008. He had written the album in New York, his wife&#x27;s home city. It was produced by Nick Franglen from Lemon Jelly; MacIntyre had produced the first three albums himself. The last track, &quot;Pay Attention to the Human&quot;, features a poem written and performed by Tony Benn. In 2009, Irvine Welsh used the track &quot;You&#x27;re a Star&quot; from &quot;The Water&quot; in his comedy &quot;Good Arrows&quot;. MacIntyre&#x27;s fifth album &quot;Island&quot;, the second under his own name, was released in the UK in 2009. It features Kenny Anderson (King Creosote) on backing vocals on &quot;Out Stealing Horses&quot; and was recorded in MacIntyre&#x27;s old primary classroom in Tobermory. In 2012, MacIntyre returned as Mull Historical Society for his sixth album &quot;City Awakenings&quot;, which is about London, New York and Glasgow. In early 2014 MacIntyre gigged as Mull Historical Society again, playing &quot;Loss&quot; in its entirety, to promote the best-of album which was released in 2015. In June 2014 MacIntyre&#x27;s project INK released its first single, &quot;Control&quot;. &quot;Dear Satellite&quot;, a new Mull Historical Society record, was released in April 2016. The latest Mull Historical Society album, &quot;In My Mind There&#x27;s A Room&quot;, was released in July 2023.

==Literary career==
MacIntyre&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Letters of Ivor Punch&quot;, was published in May 2015 by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. It is set on Mull.

<text>Eileen Christine Desmond (; 29 December 1932 – 6 January 2005) was an Irish Labour Party politician who served as Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare from 1981 to 1982. She was a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1965 to 1969 and 1973 to 1987. She also served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Munster constituency from 1979 to 1981 and as a Senator for the Industrial and Commercial Panel from 1969 to 1973. 

==Early life==
She was born in Kinsale, County Cork, her father was a postman and part-time fisherman, who went blind when she was aged eleven, her mother was the local seamstress. She was educated locally at the Convent of Mercy in Kinsale, where she was one of only two girls in her class to sit the Leaving Certificate examination. Before entering politics she worked as a civil servant with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. She married Dan Desmond in 1955, a Labour TD for Cork from 1948 to 1964, and they had two daughters.

==Politics==
Desmond was elected to Dáil Éireann in a by-election on 10 March 1965, caused by the death of her husband Dan Desmond. Her victory in the Cork Mid constituency led Taoiseach Seán Lemass to dissolve the 17th Dáil, before she could assume her seat, and call a general election. She was elected for the second time in a year, but lost her seat at the 1969 general election. However, Desmond was then elected to the 12th Seanad on the Industrial and Commercial Panel, where she served until her re-election to the 20th Dáil following the 1973 general election. She supported the unsuccessful Contraceptives Bill in 1974.

She was elected to the European Parliament at the 1979 European Parliament election for the Munster constituency. However, her time in Europe was short-lived, as she returned to domestic politics when she was offered a position as Minister and the chance to impact national legislation. At the 1981 general election she switched her constituency to Cork South-Central. A Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition came to power and Desmond was appointed Minister for Health and for Social Welfare.

Desmond was the third woman to be appointed to cabinet since the foundation of the state in 1922, the first in a Fine Gael-Labour Party cabinet, and the first female officeholder of the health and social welfare ministries. Desmond was the only woman in that short-lived coalition Cabinet. She created the National Combat Poverty Agency, which addressed inequality. She achieved a 25% increase in social welfare allowance, a level never achieved before. However, the budget was defeated on 27 January 1982, leading to the dissolution of the 22nd Dáil, so the increases never came into effect.

Desmond left politics in 1987 for health reasons but stood unsuccessfully in the 1989 European Parliament election after her health improved. She died in 2005.

<text>John James Boland (30 November 1944 – 14 August 2000) was an Irish Fine Gael politician who served as Minister for Health from January 1987 to March 1987, Minister for the Environment from 1986 to 1987, Minister for the Public Service from 1982 to 1986 and Minister for Education from 1981 to 1982. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1977 to 1989. He also served as a Senator for the Labour Panel from 1969 to 1977.

==Biography==
Boland was born in Dublin in 1944 in Terenure, Dublin, the eldest of two sons and one daughter of Charles Boland and his wife Kathleen Boland (née Whitty), both of whom were civil servants. He was educated at Synge Street CBS school and University College Dublin (UCD), where he received a Bachelor of Commerce degree. While in UCD, he served as editor of the student publication, Awake.

He first held political office in 1967, when he was elected to Dublin County Council at age 23. He served on that authority until 1981. In 1971, he became the council&#x27;s youngest-ever chairperson at age 26. While a councillor, he was associated with several controversial planning decisions. 
In 1974, he married Catherine Kennedy; they had one son and one daughter.

Boland first ran for the Dáil Éireann at the 1969 general election, but was unsuccessful. He did secure election to Seanad Éireann on the Labour Panel, becoming the youngest-ever Senator at the time. He was re-elected to the Seanad in 1973.

Boland was elected to Dáil on his third attempt at the 1977 general election as a Fine Gael TD for the Dublin County North constituency. He retained his seat at each subsequent election until losing it in the 1989 election 

On becoming Fine Gael leader, Garret FitzGerald appointed Boland to the Opposition front bench as spokesperson on Health; he later served as spokesperson on the Environment. 

In 1981, Fine Gael formed a government with the Labour Party, with Boland becoming Minister for Education. In this capacity, he achieved the landmark abolition of corporal punishment in schools.

Boland later served in a range of portfolios in Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald&#x27;s second government. As Minister for the Public Service, Boland introduced several significant reforms including merit-based promotion (instead of promotions being solely seniority-based as before) and open competitions for the most senior civil service jobs. 

Boland changed the law so that civil servants could no longer refuse to provide their names, ensuring greater transparency and accountability.

As Minister for the Public Service, he appointed Ireland&#x27;s first Ombudsman, Michael Mills.

Boland subsequently served as Minister for the Environment. He led the procurement, on behalf of the State, of Malahide Castle, Ardgillan Demesne, Newbridge House and Farm, Skerries Mills and Red Island, Skerries. He also established the first National Parks Strategy. 

After politics, Boland qualified as a barrister and practised on the Dublin and eastern circuits. He also wrote a political column for the Sunday Business Post. 

After a long illness with cancer, Boland died on 14 August 2000. Many people paid tribute upon his death, including former Taoisigh FitzGerald and John Bruton. Fitzgerald stated that Boland had done more than any Minister in the history of the State to reform the public service, while Bruton remarked that Boland was &quot;one of the most courageous, imaginative and innovative politicians&quot; he had known.

<text>Brendan Howlin (born 9 May 1956) is an Irish former Labour Party politician who served as Leader of the Labour Party from 2016 to 2020, Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform from 2011 to 2016, Leas-Cheann Comhairle from 2007 to 2011, deputy leader of the Labour Party from 1997 to 2002, Minister for the Environment from 1994 to 1997 and Minister for Health from 1993 to 1994. He was a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Wexford constituency from 1987 to 2024. He also served as a Senator from 1983 to 1987, after being nominated by the Taoiseach.

==Early life==
Born into a political family in Wexford, Howlin is the son of John and Molly Howlin (née Dunbar), and named after Brendan Corish, the local Labour TD and later leader of the Labour Party. Howlin&#x27;s father was a trade union official who served as secretary of the Irish Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union, in Wexford, for 40 years. He also secured election as a Labour member of Wexford Corporation, where he served for eighteen years, and was also an election agent to Brendan Corish. Howlin&#x27;s mother was also strongly involved in local Labour politics. Howlin&#x27;s brother Ted is a former member of Wexford County Council and Lord Mayor of Wexford. Howlin was raised on William Street in Wexford town with his three siblings.
Howlin grew up in Wexford town and was educated locally in the Faythe and at Wexford CBS. He later attended St Patrick&#x27;s College, Drumcondra, Dublin, and qualified as a primary school teacher. During his career as a teacher he was active in the Irish National Teachers&#x27; Organisation, before embarking on a career in full-time politics.

==Political career==

=== Anti-nuclear movement (1978–1982) ===
Howlin credits his introduction to politics to his involvement in the Irish anti-nuclear movement. The chair of Nuclear Opposition Wexford, Howlin was involved in the organisation of a protest against the building of a nuclear power plant in Carnsore Point, which drew 40,000 protestors. In 1979, Howlin was asked to run for Wexford Corporation and was selected in his absence, but declined to run to continue as chair of NOW.

===Early years (1982–1993)===
Howlin contested his first general election at the November 1982 election. He ran as a Labour candidate in the Wexford constituency, but despite the existence of a large left-wing vote in the area, Howlin was not elected. Despite this setback, a Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition government came to power and he was nominated by the Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald to serve in Seanad Éireann as a Senator. Howlin secured election to Wexford County Council in 1985 and served as Mayor of Wexford in 1986.

In 1987, the Labour Party withdrew from the coalition government and a general election was called. Howlin once again contested a seat in Wexford and was elected to Dáil Éireann. Labour was out of office as a Fianna Fáil government took office. Despite his recent entry to the Dáil, Howlin was subsequently named Chief Whip of the Labour Party, a position he held until 1993.

===Cabinet minister (1993–1997)===

The 1992 general election resulted in a hung Dáil once again; however, the Labour Party enjoyed their best result to date at the time. After negotiations, a Fianna Fáil-Labour Party coalition government came to office. Howlin joined the cabinet of Taoiseach Albert Reynolds, as Minister for Health. During his tenure the development of a four-year health strategy, the identifying of HIV/AIDS prevention as a priority and the securing of a £35 million investment in childcare were advanced. Howlin, however, was also targeted by anti-abortion groups after introducing an act which would allow abortion information.

In 1994, the Labour Party withdrew from the government after a disagreement over the appointment of Attorney General Harry Whelehan as a Judge of the High Court and President of the High Court. However, no general election was called and, while it was hoped that the coalition could be revived under the new Fianna Fáil leader Bertie Ahern, the arithmetic of the Dáil now allowed the Labour Party to open discussions with other opposition parties. After negotiations a Rainbow Coalition came to power involving Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left. In John Bruton&#x27;s cabinet, he became Minister for the Environment.

===Leadership contender (1997)===
Following the 1997 general election, a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition government came to power and the Labour Party returned to the opposition benches. In the announcement of the party&#x27;s new front bench, Howlin retained responsibility for the Environment.

In late 1997, Dick Spring resigned as leader of the Labour Party and Howlin immediately threw his hat into the ring in the subsequent leadership election. In a choice between Howlin and Ruairi Quinn, the former gained some early support; however, the leadership eventually went to Quinn by a significant majority. As a show of unity, Howlin was later named deputy leader of the party and retained his brief as Spokesperson for the Environment and Local Government.

===Leadership contender (2002)===
In 2002, following Quinn&#x27;s resignation as party leader after Labour&#x27;s relatively unsuccessful 2002 general election campaign, Howlin again stood for the party leadership. For the second time in five years Howlin was defeated for the leadership of the party, this time by Pat Rabbitte, who was formerly a leading figure in Democratic Left. Howlin was succeeded as deputy leader by Liz McManus.

While having been publicly supportive of Rabbitte&#x27;s leadership, he was perceived as being the leader of the wing of the party which was sceptical of Rabbitte&#x27;s policy about future coalition with Fianna Fáil. Rabbitte explicitly ruled out any future coalition with Fianna Fáil, instead forming a formal alliance with Fine Gael in the run-up to the 2007 general election (the so-called &quot;Mullingar Accord&quot;).

===Leas-Cheann Comhairle (2007–2011)===
On 26 June 2007, Howlin was appointed the Leas-Cheann Comhairle (deputy chairperson) of Dáil Éireann.

===Cabinet minister (2011–2016)===

After the 2011 general election, Fine Gael and the Labour Party formed a government, Howlin was appointed to the new office of Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. In May 2011, he said that over the next 20 years, the number of people in Ireland over 65 is set to increase by almost half a million, a situation that could see the annual health budget soar – rising by €12.5 billion in the next decade alone. While reform was a major part of government attempts &quot;to regain full sovereignty over economic policy&quot;, Howlin told a meeting of the Association of Chief Executives of State Agencies they would in any event face key &quot;imperatives&quot; in coming years. He said a new public spending review, on which he had briefed the cabinet in recent days, would not be a simple assessment of where to make cuts, but would also consider the way public sector services were delivered. Howlin reiterated the government&#x27;s commitment not to cut public sector pay, &quot;if the &quot;Croke Park Agreement&quot; works&quot;. &quot;These are just some of the challenges that our society is facing in the coming decade – crisis or no crisis. In the good times, tackling them was going to be difficult. Today, in these difficult times, tackling them is going to be imperative.&quot; Howlin said Ireland was facing a profound and complex economic crisis &quot;where we are fighting a battle on three fronts – mass unemployment, a major failure in banking, and a fiscal crisis&quot;.

====Analysis of budgets====
Budgets 2012 to 2016 - introduced in part by Brendan Howlin as Minister for Public Expenditure and supported by Labour - were described by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) as &quot;regressive&quot;.

It found that &quot;Budget 2012 involved greater proportionate losses for those on low incomes: reductions of about 2 to 2½ per cent for those with the lowest incomes, as against losses of about ¾ of a per cent for those on the highest incomes&quot;.

By contrast, the ESRI found earlier budgets in 2008–2010 to be &quot;strongly progressive&quot; because before 2011 &quot;Losses imposed by policy changes in tax and welfare have been greatest for those on the highest incomes, and smaller for those on low incomes&quot;.

However, it concluded &quot;Budget 2014 had its greatest impact – a reduction of 2 per cent – on low-income groups&quot;.
The ESRI described Budget 2015 as having a &quot;pattern of losses in the bottom half of the income distribution, declining as income rises, and gains in the upper reaches&quot;, which &quot;can clearly be described as regressive&quot;.

===Labour Party leadership (2016–2020)===
Howlin retained his seat in the Dáil following the 2016 general election, though only six of his Labour colleagues did likewise and the party returned to the opposition benches. Following the resignation of Joan Burton, Howlin contested the 2016 Labour Party leadership election unopposed and was elected Leader of the Labour Party on 20 May 2016.

In March 2018, Howlin criticised Taoiseach Leo Varadkar for failing to personally invite him to accompany Varadkar as he met ambulance crews in Howlin&#x27;s constituency of Wexford. Varadkar replied that he had been far too busy dealing with the recent weather crisis and Brexit &quot;to organise invitations to Deputies personally in order that they [Howlin] felt included&quot;. It was separately said of Howlin&#x27;s complaint &quot;It appears that the Taoiseach, the chief executive of the State, needs the imprimatur of local politicians when he enters their bailiwick, and needs to be accompanied and monitored by those same politicians while he is in their realm.&quot;

====Leadership challenge====
Alan Kelly challenged Howlin for the party leadership in 2018, stating that he had failed to &#x27;turn the ship around&#x27;. Howlin stated that Kelly&#x27;s comments were a disappointing and unnecessary distraction. Howlin also said that there was not a single parliamentary party member who supported the challenge and that Kelly had the backing of a minority of councillors. Howlin told &quot;The Irish Times&quot; that there was no formal proposition made to the Central Council (which would deal with any formal leadership challenge).

====2020 general election====
In September 2018, Howlin stated that winning 14 seats in the 33rd Dail was a realistic goal. During the campaign in 2020, Howlin stated that his wish to end the U.S.A&#x27;s use of Shannon airport for military related activities. In the 2020 general election party first preference vote dropped to 4.4% of first preference votes and returned 6 seats - a record low. Howlin announced his intention to step down as leader on the 12 February 2020. He also said that the Labour Party should not formally enter government, a view that was backed by the parliamentary party. He also stated that he would not back any candidate in the following contest. On 15 February 2020, Howlin ruled himself out as a candidate for Ceann Comhairle of the 33rd Dail, with the polling day to elect his successor set for 3 April 2020.

=== After leadership (2020–present) ===
In 2020, Howlin&#x27;s legislation (Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill) was passed and signed into law by Michael D. Higgins. This bill made the distribution of intimate images or &quot;revenge porn&quot; a criminal offence, and made other forms of cyber-bullying and harassment punishable.

On 6 October 2023, Howlin announced that he would not contest the next general election.

==Personal life==
Howlin is a single man. He has spoken publicly of receiving hate mail relating to his private life and questioning his sexual orientation. In an interview with &quot;The Star&quot; during the 2002 Labour Party leadership contest, in response to repeated speculation, he announced he was &quot;not gay&quot;.

Momo is fascinated by the elderly Turkish Muslim man, Ibrahim Demirci, who runs a grocery store across the street from his apartment (where Momo often shoplifts). Their relationship develops and soon Momo feels closer to Ibrahim than to his father. Ibrahim affectionately calls Moїse Momo, and adopts him when his father leaves and commits suicide. Momo and Ibrahim go on a journey in their new car to Turkey, Ibrahim&#x27;s native country, where Momo learns about Ibrahim&#x27;s culture.

<doc id="563177" wikidata="Q3175175" url="?curid=563177" title="Jean d'Arras">
<text>Jean d&#x27;Arras ( 1392–1394) was a 14th-century writer from Northern France about whom little is known.

He collaborated with Antoine du Val and Fouquart de Cambrai in putting together a collection of stories entitled &quot;L&#x27;Évangile des quenouilles&quot; (&quot;The spinners&#x27; gospel&quot;). The frame story features a group of ladies at their spinning who relate the current theories on a great variety of subjects. The work is of considerable value for the light it throws on medieval manners, and for its echoes of folklore, sometimes deeply buried under layers of Christian tradition.

There were many editions of this book in the 15th and 16th centuries, one of which was printed by the early printer Wynkyn de Worde in English, as &quot;The Gospelles of Dystaves&quot;. A more modern edition (Collection Jannet) had a preface by Anatole France.

==The Roman de Mélusine==
Jean d&#x27;Arras, perhaps the same, wrote at the request of John, duke of Berry, as he says in his introduction, a long prose romance variously called the &quot;Roman de Mélusine&quot; or the &quot;Chronique de Melusine&quot; part of &quot;Le Noble Hystoire de Lusignan&quot; (&quot;The Noble History of the Lusignans&quot;), in 1392-94. He dedicated the work to Marie of Valois, Duchess of Bar and expressed the hope that it would aid in the political education of her children.

Leaning on perhaps mostly oral tradition surrounding the originally Celtic region of Poitou, it is one of the first literary versions of the tale of Melusine, a fairy cursed by her fairy mother to become a hybrid woman/serpent every Saturday. If she married a mortal man who remained faithful to her and obeyed her request never to seek her out on that day, she would gain the status of a mortal woman and enjoy salvation as a Christian. She guided the spectacular rise and subsequent fall of the House of Lusignan after she met the nobleman Rainmondin by a fountain in the forest, who married her and fathered ten sons on her whose exploits in the Crusades brought them fame, despite the fact that most of them carried some form of physical blemish. Raimondin remains faithful to his promise until he is persuaded to believe that her hiding every Saturday is an excuse for her to entertain a lover, and he spies on her in her bath. He doesn&#x27;t betray her secret until one of their most deformed sons, Geoffrey Big-Tooth, burns down the monastery his brother Fromont has retired to. In despair, Raimondin curses her publicly for her demonic nature that has infected their sons, and she turns into a dragon and flies away, wailing. For more information consult the Wikipedia article on Melusine.

* Donald Maddox and Sara Sturm-Maddox, &quot;Melusine of Lusignan: founding fiction in late medieval France.&quot; A volume of essays on the &quot;Roman de Melusine&quot;. The &quot;Roman&quot; traces the powerful medieval dynasty of Lusignan from its founding in the city by the legendary Melusine, an enigmatic shape-shifting faery figure, through its glorious rise in Europe and in the Crusader kingdoms of the Eastern Mediterranean (see Guy of Lusignan, King of Cyprus), weaving together history and fiction, with elements of myth, folklore, and popular traditions fused with epic, Crusader narrative, knightly romance, and Christian doctrine, all to glorify and uphold the proprietary claims to Lusignan of the work&#x27;s illustrious patron.

<text>The Rock River is a tributary of the Mississippi River, approximately long, in the U.S. states of Wisconsin and Illinois. The river was known as the Sinnissippi to Sauk and Meskwaki peoples; the name means &quot;rocky waters&quot;.

The river, which has a notable higher western bank, begins with three separate branches that flow into the Horicon Marsh. The northernmost branch, the West Branch, begins just to the west of the village of Brandon in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin and flows east and then south to Horicon Marsh. The South Branch rises north of Fox Lake in Dodge County and flows east through Waupun to the marsh. The East Branch rises southeast of Allenton in Washington County just west of the Niagara Escarpment, and flows north and west through Theresa to the marsh.

Leaving the marsh, it meanders southward to the Illinois border, ending about 300 miles later at the Mississippi River at the Quad Cities in Illinois and Iowa. During its course, it passes through Watertown, collects the Crawfish River in Jefferson, and receives the Bark River at Fort Atkinson. Shortly before merging, the Rock and Crawfish rivers cross Interstate 94. Both rivers flood the nearby land regularly, and lanes on I-94 were temporarily closed in 2008 because of this flooding.

In northern Rock County, Wisconsin, it receives the Yahara River, and flows southward through tiny Fulton, Janesville and Beloit into northern Illinois, where it receives the Pecatonica River 5 miles (8 km) south of the state line. It flows south through Rockford, then southwest across northwestern Illinois, picking up the Kishwaukee River, passing Oregon (here, on a high bluff overlooking the river is the &quot;Eternal Indian&quot; sculpture), Dixon, Sterling (which has the Sinnissippi Mounds national historic site and local park) and Rock Falls before joining the Mississippi at Rock Island. It was on the Rock River in Dixon where Ronald Reagan was a lifeguard in his youth. Reagan&#x27;s favorite fishing spot, now called &quot;Dutch Landing&quot; after Reagan&#x27;s nickname, was just southwest of Lowell Park on the Rock River.

There are 25 dams on the Rock River. These are in Theresa (WI, 3 dams), Waupun (WI), Horicon (WI), Mayville (WI, 2 dams), Kekoskee (WI), Hustisford (WI), Watertown (WI, 2 dams), Jefferson (WI, 4 dams), Indianford (WI), Janesville (WI), Beloit (WI), Rockton (IL), Rockford Fordham (IL), Oregon (IL), Dixon (IL), Sterling / Rock Falls (IL, 2 dams), Milan (IL) and Rock Island (IL).

The river is used for various water and paddling sports. The Rock River Water Trail is on the river from its headwaters above the Horicon National Wildlife Refuge in south central Wisconsin to the confluence with the Mississippi River at the Quad Cities of Illinois and Iowa 330 miles downriver. It crosses five counties in Wisconsin, six counties in Illinois and runs through 37 municipalities. The slow moving river passes scenic rural landscapes, wilderness areas and urban areas. The first two trailheads are at Waupun County Park in Waupun, Wisconsin and Rivers Edge Park in Theresa, Wisconsin and there are 32 additional access points in Dodge County, Wisconsin. The trail is part of the National Water Trails System and the first National Water Trail in Wisconsin and Illinois.

Rock River Park is on County Road B about a half mile west of Johnson Creek, Wisconsin in Jefferson County, Wisconsin and offers river access and an artesian spring.
The river is also home to the Rock Aqua Jays, an amateur water ski club that performs at Traxler Park in downtown Janesville, Wisconsin.

<doc id="563184" wikidata="Q1429250" url="?curid=563184" title="Back in the USA (album)">
<text>Back in the USA is the first studio album by the American rock band MC5, released on January 15, 1970. It is their second album overall, following 1969&#x27;s live album &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot;. 

== Background ==

The central focus of the album is the band&#x27;s movement away from the raw, thrashy sound pioneered and captured on their first release, the live album &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot; (1969). This was due in part to producer Jon Landau&#x27;s distaste for the rough psychedelic rock movement, and his adoration for the straightforward rock and roll of the 1950s.

Landau, who originally wrote for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, was looking to get more involved in actual music production. Becoming close with Atlantic Records executive Jerry Wexler was his chance and led Landau to the politically radical MC5, who had just been picked up by Atlantic after being dropped from Elektra Records in 1969 – the Kinney National Company (later known as Time Warner), parent of Atlantic, acquired Elektra in the same year of this album&#x27;s release; both labels are now part of the Warner Music Group (now a separate company from TW), through the Atlantic Records Group.

== Content ==

The opening track is a cover of the classic hit &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot; by Little Richard. &quot;Let Me Try&quot; is a ballad. &quot;The American Ruse&quot; attacks what the Detroit quintet saw as the hypocritical idea of freedom espoused by the US government, and &quot;The Human Being Lawnmower&quot; expresses opposition to the US involvement in the Vietnam War. The last song on the album, which is the title track, is a cover of Chuck Berry&#x27;s 1959 single &quot;Back in the U.S.A.&quot;

== Release and reception ==

Reviewing &quot;Back in the USA&quot; for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1970, Greil Marcus admired the album&#x27;s &quot;attempt to define themes and problems and an offering of political, social, and emotional solutions&quot;, but found that &quot;the music, the sound, and in the end the care with which these themes have been shaped drags it down, save for two or three fine numbers that deserve to be played on every jukebox in the land&quot;. Though the album was viewed as a flop early on by most fans, and lacked the commercial success of their previous release, it would later be considered highly important due to the album&#x27;s absolute projection of MC5&#x27;s core sound and earliest influences.

In his retrospective review, Jason Ankeny of AllMusic wrote, &quot;While lacking the monumental impact of &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot;, the MC5&#x27;s second album is in many regards their best and most influential&quot;.

== Legacy ==

In 2012, &quot;Back in the USA&quot; was ranked number 446 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The following year, &quot;NME&quot; placed the album at number 490 on its own similar list.

Jason Ankeny of AllMusic commented that &quot;[the album&#x27;s] lean, edgy sound anticipat[ed] the emergence of both the punk and power pop movements to follow later in the decade.&quot;

<text>Rodney David Donald (10 October 1957 – 6 November 2005) was a New Zealand politician who co-led the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand, along with Jeanette Fitzsimons.

He lived in Christchurch with his partner Nicola Shirlaw, and their three daughters.

==Early political career==
Donald held Values Party membership from 1974 to 1979 and then Labour Party membership from 1982 to 1988. On becoming national spokesperson of the impartial Electoral Reform Coalition from 1989 to 1993 he had to resign his party membership. After the success of the MMP referendum at the 1993 election he joined the Green Party in February 1994. After he became co-leader of the Greens in 1995, voters first elected him to Parliament in the 1996 election as an Alliance list MP.

The Green Party left the Alliance to stand alone in the 1999 election. He entered the 1999 parliament as number two on the Greens&#x27; party list. He retained his list seat in the 2002 and 2005 elections.

==Member of Parliament==


For many years Donald had a special interest in electoral reform in New Zealand. From 1989 to 1993 he served as spokesperson for the Electoral Reform Coalition during the campaign that led to the introduction of mixed-member proportional (MMP) representation. Subsequently, he played a major part in getting legislation passed to allow STV voting in local body elections in New Zealand. Co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons described MMP as Donald&#x27;s greatest legacy.

He also served as the Green Party spokesperson on Buy Kiwi Made, commerce, electoral reform, finance and revenue, land information, regional development and small business, superannuation, sustainable economics, state services, statistics, tourism, trade, and waste.

==Death==
Shortly after midnight on 6 November 2005, the day before his scheduled swearing-in for his fourth term in Parliament, he died suddenly at his Christchurch home after suffering for a few days from &quot;Campylobacter jejuni&quot; food poisoning from an unknown source. An autopsy initially ruled out a heart attack, but subsequent test-results determined that death resulted from an inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis), which is a very rare consequence of &quot;C. jejuni&quot; infection. He was 48 years old. His funeral, which took place at the Cathedral of ChristChurch, was attended by over 1,000 people. His casket arrived on board an electric bus and his wake took place at the adjacent Warner&#x27;s Hotel. The Parliament showed its respect for Donald by suspending a day of business, and a minute of silence was observed in the House of Representatives.

He was succeeded in the Green Party leadership by Russel Norman.

<doc id="563188" wikidata="Q15623463" url="?curid=563188" title="Graded potential">
<text>Graded potentials are changes in membrane potential that vary according to the size of the stimulus, as opposed to being all-or-none. They include diverse potentials such as receptor potentials, electrotonic potentials, subthreshold membrane potential oscillations, slow-wave potential, pacemaker potentials, and synaptic potentials. The magnitude of a graded potential is determined by the strength of the stimulus. They arise from the summation of the individual actions of ligand-gated ion channel proteins, and decrease over time and space. They do not typically involve voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels, but rather can be produced by neurotransmitters that are released at synapses which activate ligand-gated ion channels. They occur at the postsynaptic dendrite in response to presynaptic neuron firing and release of neurotransmitter, or may occur in skeletal, smooth, or cardiac muscle in response to nerve input. These impulses are incremental and may be excitatory or inhibitory.

== Ligand-gated ion channels ==
Graded potentials are usually produced in the dendrites of a neuron where voltage-gated channels are not present. They are localized changes in the membrane potential in response to a stimuli, like neurotransmitters binding to receptor. This binding causes a change in conformation, which activates the receptor to interact with proteins. This reaction activates the opening of ion channels resulting in movement of Na+, K+, Ca2+, or Cl- ions across the membrane producing graded potentials. Unlike action potentials, graded potentials stay in the area where the stimulation occurred and each synapse will be either excitatory or inhibitory. 

== Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) ==
Graded potentials that make the membrane potential less negative or more positive, thus making the postsynaptic cell more likely to have an action potential, are called excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). Depolarizing local potentials sum together, and if the voltage reaches the threshold potential, an action potential occurs in that cell.

EPSPs are caused by the influx of Na+ or Ca2+ from the extracellular space into the neuron or muscle cell. When the presynaptic neuron has an action potential, Ca2+ enters the axon terminal via voltage-dependent calcium channels and causes exocytosis of synaptic vesicles, causing neurotransmitter to be released. The transmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and activates ligand-gated ion channels that mediate the EPSP. The amplitude of the EPSP is directly proportional to the number of synaptic vesicles that were released.

If the EPSP is not large enough to trigger an action potential, the membrane subsequently repolarizes to its resting membrane potential. This shows the temporary and reversible nature of graded potentials.

== Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) ==
Graded potentials that make the membrane potential more negative, and make the postsynaptic cell less likely to have an action potential, are called inhibitory post synaptic potentials (IPSPs). Hyperpolarization of membranes is caused by influx of Cl− or efflux of K+. As with EPSPs, the amplitude of the IPSP is directly proportional to the number of synaptic vesicles that were released.

==Summation==
The resting membrane potential is usually around –70 mV. The typical neuron has a threshold potential ranging from –40 mV to –55 mV. Temporal summation occurs when graded potentials within the postsynaptic cell occur so rapidly that they build on each other before the previous ones fade. Spatial summation occurs when postsynaptic potentials from adjacent synapses on the cell occur simultaneously and add together. An action potential occurs when the summated EPSPs, minus the summated IPSPs, in an area of membrane reach the cell&#x27;s threshold potential.

<doc id="563193" wikidata="Q2478783" url="?curid=563193" title="In God We Trust, Inc.">
<text>In God We Trust, Inc. is an EP by hardcore punk band Dead Kennedys and the first of the group&#x27;s releases with drummer D. H. Peligro. The record is a screed against topics ranging from organized religion and Neo-Nazis, to the pesticide Kepone and the government indifference that worsened the effects of the Minamata disaster. &quot;In God We Trust, Inc.&quot; is also the first Dead Kennedys album released after the presidential election of Ronald Reagan and features the band&#x27;s first references to Reagan, for which they—and hardcore punk as a genre—would become notorious.

==Background==
During 1980 and 1981 the American punk scene saw an influx of 7-inch EPs from Washington D.C.&#x27;s Dischord Records from bands like Minor Threat and Teen Idles. These short, high-tempo records packed in as many as 10 songs each and helped define the 1980s genre of hardcore punk.

In wanting to pay tribute to this faster form of punk rock, and to showcase the talents of their new drummer D. H. Peligro, Dead Kennedys put together some new material and sped up a few songs that had only been heard on their 1978 demos and in early live shows. These songs became the basis for &quot;In God We Trust, Inc.&quot; Keeping with the rough-hewn style of D.C. hardcore, bits of tape leads announcing the take number and including drumstick clicks and count-offs precede many of the record&#x27;s songs.

==Recording==
Dead Kennedys initially recorded eight songs at Subterranean Studios on June 19, 1981. All tracks were recorded live without overdubs to ½&quot; 8-track reel and with the band determining some of the songs&#x27; arrangements between takes. The session was videotaped by Joe Rees of Target Video with Mike Fox, the session engineer, sending the rough mix to the video feed. When the group took the tracks to be mixed, they discovered that the magnetic tape used for the recording was defective—the oxide surface of the tape began to peel during playback, thereby destroying the recordings. The band then re-recorded all eight songs on August 22 at Mobius Music, and these recordings were released on the EP.

Years later, enhanced restoration techniques allowed for five tracks to be recovered from the master tapes from the earlier Subterranean sessions. These, along with the rough video mixes of the remaining three songs, appear on the DVD &quot;The Lost Tapes&quot;.

==Songs==

Much of the material on the EP was left over from earlier in the Dead Kennedys&#x27; career. Second guitarist 6025, who&#x27;d left the band in 1979, wrote the lead track, &quot;Religious Vomit&quot;. The song &quot;Kepone Factory&quot; is a reworking of &quot;Kepone Kids&quot;, which appeared on the group&#x27;s 1978 demo tape. Alternate versions of &quot;Moral Majority&quot; and &quot;Nazi Punks Fuck Off&quot; were on a single packaged with an anti-fascist armband. &quot;We&#x27;ve Got a Bigger Problem Now&quot; is a rewritten version of the band&#x27;s early single &quot;California Über Alles&quot;. Originally a dig at California governor Jerry Brown, the band reworked the song to be about newly elected president Ronald Reagan and added an element of lounge music in contrast with the fast-tempo hardcore punk music on the rest of the record. The EP closes with a cover of the theme from the 1960s TV show &quot;Rawhide&quot;.

==Artwork and releases==

The album cover depicts a golden Jesus crucified on a cross of dollar bills, with a background of a shiny metal material. The band released the record internationally in 1981 on their own Alternative Tentacles label, in partnership with various other independent record labels in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The original vinyl version&#x27;s A-side comprised tracks 1–5, and Side B tracks 6–8.

The original cassette version compiled all 8 songs on Side A and left Side B intentionally devoid of any sound. Printed on the cassette&#x27;s second side was the explanation, &quot;Home taping is killing record industry profits! We left this side blank so you can help.&quot;

&quot;In God We Trust, Inc.&quot; first appeared on compact disc in 1985 as bonus material added to the Dead Kennedys&#x27; 1982 LP &quot;Plastic Surgery Disasters&quot;.

<text>Plastic Surgery Disasters is the second full-length album released by punk rock band Dead Kennedys. Recorded in San Francisco during June 1982, it was produced by the band and punk record producer Thom Wilson, with Geza X getting a &quot;special thanks&quot; underneath the DK&#x27;s/Wilson credit for additional production. (DK&#x27;s guitarist East Bay Ray redundantly added his own name to the production credits on Manifesto reissues of the album.) The album is darker and more hardcore-influenced than their debut album &quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables&quot; as a result of the band trying to expand on the sound and mood they had achieved with their 1980 single &quot;Holiday in Cambodia&quot;. It was the first full-length album to feature drummer D.H. Peligro, and is frontman Jello Biafra&#x27;s favorite Dead Kennedys album.

According to Jello Biafra, the main musical influences for the album were Bauhaus, Les Baxter and the Groundhogs.

==Artwork==

The album&#x27;s cover features the band&#x27;s name superimposed over the black-and-white photograph &quot;Hands&quot; by photojournalist Michael Wells. Wells&#x27;s photo depicts the emaciated forearm and hand of a malnourished Ugandan child in the palm of a European missionary to highlight the horrors of famine in parts of the African continent during the 1970s and 80s. The same image was used by another San Francisco-based punk band called Society Dog for their 1981 EP &quot;...Off of the Leash.&quot;.

Most pressings of the album include a booklet containing lyrics and pieces of collage artwork by Biafra and Winston Smith that thematically tie in to the lyrics of each song on the album.

==Track listings==

On the album&#x27;s original vinyl and cassette releases, the A-side comprises tracks 1–8, ending with “Winnebago Warrior”, and the B-side tracks 9–13, kicking off with “Riot”. Some reissues parse out Melissa Webber&#x27;s spoken intro to the album from the opening song, &quot;Government Flu&quot;, and list it as a separate track entitled &quot;Advice from Christmas Past&quot;. Similarly, Webber&#x27;s spoken outro after &quot;Moon Over Marin&quot; revisits &quot;Advice from Christmas Past&quot; and is listed as such on some editions of the album.

The compact disc of the album has been reissued to include the EP &quot;In God We Trust, Inc.&quot; as eight tracks added onto its end and also appear on streaming versions of &quot;Plastic Surgery Disasters&quot;.

<text>(Frederic) Stanley Kipping FRS (16 August 1863 – 1 May 1949) was an English chemist. He undertook much of the pioneering work on silicon polymers and coined the term silicone.

==Life==
He was born in Salford, Lancashire, England, the son of James Kipping, a Bank of England official, and Julia Du Val, a daughter of painter Charles Allen Du Val. He was educated at Manchester Grammar School before enrolling in 1879 at Owens College (now Manchester University) for an external degree from the University of London. After working for the local gas company for a short time he went in 1886 to Germany to work under William Henry Perkin, Jr. in the laboratories of Adolf von Baeyer at Munich University.

Back in England, he took a position as demonstrator for Perkin, who had been appointed professor at Heriot-Watt College, Edinburgh. In 1890, Kipping was appointed chief demonstrator in chemistry for the City and Guilds of London Institute, where he worked for the chemist Henry Edward Armstrong. In 1897 he moved to University College, Nottingham as professor of the chemistry department, and became the first newly endowed Sir Jesse Boot professor of chemistry at the university in 1928. He remained there until his retirement in 1936.

==Achievements==
Kipping undertook much of the pioneering work into the development of silicon polymers (silicones) at Nottingham. He pioneered the study of the organic compounds of silicon (organosilicon) and coined the term silicone. His research formed the basis for the worldwide development of the synthetic rubber and silicone-based lubricant industries. He also co-wrote, with Perkin, a standard textbook on organic chemistry (&quot;Organic Chemistry&quot;, Perkin and Kipping, 1894).

He was awarded the Longstaff Medal (now Longstaff Prize) by the Chemistry Society (now Royal Society of Chemistry) in 1909.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June, 1897. He was awarded their Davy Medal in 1918 and delivered their Bakerian Lecture in 1936 and was awarded a Royal Society Bakerian Medal in the same year.

In 2004, he was inducted into the University of Akron&#x27;s International Rubber Science Hall of Fame.

==Family==
He retired in 1936 and died in Criccieth, Wales in 1949. He married Lilian Holland in 1888, one of three sisters, and both his brothers-in-law were eminent scientists themselves: Arthur Lapworth and William Henry Perkin, Jr. He had four children including (Cyril Henry) Stanley, who became a famous chess problem composer and headmaster of Wednesbury Boys School, (Frederick) Barry who was eminent in chemistry and later edited his father&#x27;s Organic Chemistry textbook, and (Kathleen) Esme who made wooden jigsaw puzzles under the name of K.E.K Puzzles.

==Perkin and Kipping&#x27;s Organic Chemistry text book==
First published in 1894, the book went through many reprints and new editions well into the 1950s. From 1949 his son Barry Kipping was the sole editor.
Perkin and Kipping also published a text book on Inorganic Chemistry, first published in 1911.

<doc id="563203" wikidata="Q5419646" url="?curid=563203" title="Excitatory synapse">
<text>An excitatory synapse is a synapse in which an action potential in a presynaptic neuron increases the probability of an action potential occurring in a postsynaptic cell. Neurons form networks through which nerve impulses travels, each neuron often making numerous connections with other cells of neurons. These electrical signals may be excitatory or inhibitory, and, if the total of excitatory influences exceeds that of the inhibitory influences, the neuron will generate a new action potential at its axon hillock, thus transmitting the information to yet another cell.

This phenomenon is known as an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). It may occur via direct contact between cells (i.e., via gap junctions), as in an electrical synapse, but most commonly occurs via the vesicular release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic axon terminal into the synaptic cleft, as in a chemical synapse.

The excitatory neurotransmitters, the most common of which is glutamate, then migrate via diffusion to the dendritic spine of the postsynaptic neuron and bind a specific transmembrane receptor protein that triggers the depolarization of that cell. Depolarization, a deviation from a neuron&#x27;s resting membrane potential towards its threshold potential, increases the likelihood of an action potential and normally occurs with the influx of positively charged sodium (Na+) ions into the postsynaptic cell through ion channels activated by neurotransmitter binding.

==Chemical vs electrical synapses==
:There are two different kinds of synapses present within the human brain: chemical and electrical. Chemical synapses are by far the most prevalent and are the main player involved in excitatory synapses. Electrical synapses, the minority, allow direct, passive flow of electric current through special intercellular connections called gap junctions. These gap junctions allow for virtually instantaneous transmission of electrical signals through direct passive flow of ions between neurons (transmission can be bidirectional). The main goal of electrical synapses is to synchronize electrical activity among populations of neurons. The first electrical synapse was discovered in a crayfish nervous system.

:Chemical synaptic transmission is the transfer of neurotransmitters or neuropeptides from a presynaptic axon to a postsynaptic dendrite. Unlike an electrical synapse, the chemical synapses are separated by a space called the synaptic cleft, typically measured between 15 and 25 nm. Transmission of an excitatory signal involves several steps outlined below.

==Synaptic transmission==
# In neurons that are involved in chemical synaptic transmission, neurotransmitters are synthesized either in the neuronal cell body, or within the presynaptic terminal, depending on the type of neurotransmitter being synthesized and the location of enzymes involved in its synthesis. These neurotransmitters are stored in synaptic vesicles that remain bound near the membrane by calcium-influenced proteins.
# In order to trigger the process of chemical synaptic transmission, upstream activity causes an action potential to invade the presynaptic terminal.
# This depolarizing current reaches the presynaptic terminal, and the membrane depolarization that it causes there initiates the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels present on the presynaptic membrane.
# There is high concentration of calcium in the synaptic cleft between the two participating neurons (presynaptic and postsynaptic). This difference in calcium concentration between the synaptic cleft and the inside of the presynaptic terminal establishes a strong concentration gradient that drives the calcium into the presynaptic terminal upon opening of these voltage-gated calcium channels. This influx of calcium into the presynaptic terminal is necessary for neurotransmitter release.
# After entering the presynaptic terminal, the calcium binds a protein called synaptotagmin, which is located on the membrane of the synaptic vesicles. This protein interacts with other proteins called SNAREs in order to induce vesicle fusion with the presynaptic membrane. As a result of this vesicle fusion, the neurotransmitters that had been packaged into the synaptic vesicle are released into the synapse, where they diffuse across the synaptic cleft.
# These neurotransmitters bind to a variety of receptors on the postsynaptic cell membrane. In response to neurotransmitter binding, these postsynaptic receptors can undergo conformational changes that may open a transmembrane channel subunit either directly, or indirectly via a G-Protein signaling pathway. The selective permeability of these channels allow certain ions to move along their electrochemical gradients, inducing a current across the postsynaptic membrane that determines an excitatory or inhibitory response.
==Responses of the postsynaptic neuron==
:When neurotransmitters reach the postsynaptic neuron of an excitatory synapse, these molecules can bind to two possible types of receptors that are clustered in a protein-rich portion of the postsynaptic cytoskeleton called the Postsynaptic density (PSD). Ionotropic receptors, which are also referred to as ligand-gated ion channels, contain a transmembrane domain that acts as an ion channel and can directly open after binding of a neurotransmitter. Metabotropic receptors, which are also called G-protein-coupled receptors, act on an ion channel through the intracellular signaling of a molecule called a G protein. Each of these channels has a specific reversal potential, Erev, and each receptor is selectively permeable to particular ions that flow either into or out of the cell in order to bring the overall membrane potential to this reversal potential. If a neurotransmitter binds to a receptor with a reversal potential that is higher than the threshold potential for the postsynaptic neuron, the postsynaptic cell will be more likely to generate an action potential and an excitatory postsynaptic potential will occur (EPSP). On the other hand, if the reversal potential of the receptor to which the neurotransmitter binds is lower than the threshold potential, an inhibitory postsynaptic potential will occur (IPSP).

:Although the receptors at an excitatory synapse strive to bring the membrane potential towards their own specific Erev, the probability that the single stimulation of an excitatory synapse will raise the membrane potential past threshold and produce an action potential is not very high. Therefore, in order to achieve threshold and generate an action potential, the postsynaptic neuron has the capacity to add up all of the incoming EPSPs based on the mechanism of summation, which can occur in time and space. Temporal summation occurs when a particular synapse is stimulated at a high frequency, which causes the postsynaptic neuron to sum the incoming EPSPs and thus increases the chance of the neuron firing an action potential. In a similar way, the postsynaptic neuron can sum together EPSPs from multiple synapses with other neurons in a process called spatial summation.

==Types of excitatory neurotransmitters==

===Acetylcholine===
:Acetylcholine (ACh) is an excitatory, small-molecule neurotransmitter involved in synaptic transmission at neuromuscular junctions controlling the vagus nerve and cardiac muscle fibers, as well as in the skeletal and visceral motor systems and various sites within the central nervous system. This neurotransmitter crosses the synaptic cleft and binds to a variety of postsynaptic receptors depending on the species, but all of these receptors depolarize the postsynaptic membrane and thus classify ACh as an excitatory neurotransmitter.

===Glutamate===
:Glutamate is a small, amino acid neurotransmitter, and is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter at almost all synapses in the central nervous system. This molecule binds multiple postsynaptic receptors including the NMDA receptor, AMPA receptor, and kainate receptors. These receptors are all cation channels that allow positively charged ions such as Na+, K+, and sometimes Ca2+ into the postsynaptic cell, causing a depolarization that excites the neuron.

===Catecholamines===
:The catecholamines, which include Epinephrine, Norepinephrine, and Dopamine, are excitatory biogenic amine neuromodulators that are derived from the amino acid tyrosine and serve as excitatory neurotransmitters at various locations in the central nervous system as well as the peripheral nervous system. Epinephrine and norepinephrine, also called adrenaline and noradrenaline, respectively, bind a number of G-protein-coupled receptors that induce their depolarizing effects on the postsynaptic cell in various ways, including activating and inactivating certain K+ channels. Epinephrine is found in the lateral tegmental system, medulla, hypothalamus, and thalamus of the central nervous system, but their function is not fully understood. Norepinephrine is found in the brain stem and is involved in sleep and wakefulness, feeding behavior, and attention. Dopamine binds to G-protein-coupled receptors in many areas of the brain, especially the corpus striatum where it mediates the synaptic transmission that underlies the coordination of body movements.

===Serotonin===
:Serotonin is an excitatory neurotransmitter that regulates sleep and wakefulness and is found in neurons of the raphe region of the pons and upper brain stem, which extend into the forebrain. Serotonin binds a number of receptors, including the 5-HT3 receptors, which are ligand-gated ion channels that allow the passage of cations in order to depolarize the membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron that they reside on. Levels of serotonin activity that are lower than normal have been linked to a variety of symptoms, especially depression, which is why many antidepressant drugs act to increase serotonin activity.

===Histamine===
:Histamine acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter by binding G-protein coupled receptors in neurons of the hypothalamus. These neurons project into many regions of the brain and spinal cord, allowing histamine to mediate attention, arousal, and allergic responses. Of the four types of histamine receptors (H1 - H4), H3 is found in the central nervous system and is responsible for regulating histamine effects on neurotransmission.

==Disease==

:Excitatory synapses have a fundamental role in information processing within the brain and throughout the peripheral nervous system. Usually situated on dendritic spines, or neuronal membrane protrusions on which glutamate receptors and postsynaptic density components are concentrated, excitatory synapses aid in the electrical transmission of neuronal signals. The physical morphology of synapses is crucial in understanding their function, and it is well documented that the inappropriate loss of synaptic stability leads to the disruption of neuronal circuits and the resulting neurological diseases. Although there are innumerable different causes for different neurodegenerative illnesses, such as genetic dispositions or mutations, the normal aging process, parasitic and viral causes, or drug use, many can be traced back to dysfunctional signaling between the neurons themselves, often at the synapse.

===Excitotoxicity===
====Pathophysiology====

:Since glutamate is the most common excitatory neurotransmitter involved in synaptic neuronal transmission, it follows that disruptions in the normal functioning of these pathways can have severe detrimental effects on the nervous system. A major source of cellular stress is related to glutaminergic overstimulation of a postsynaptic neuron via excessive activation of glutamate receptors (i.e., NMDA and AMPA receptors), a process known as excitotoxicity, which was first discovered accidentally by D. R. Lucas and J. P. Newhouse in 1957 during experimentation on sodium-fed lab mice.

:Under normal conditions, extracellular glutamate levels are held under strict control by surrounding neuronal and glial cell membrane transporters, rising to a concentration of about 1 mM and quickly falling to resting levels. These levels are maintained via the recycling of glutamate molecules in the neuronal-glial cell process known as the glutamate–glutamine cycle, in which glutamate is synthesized from its precursor glutamine in a controlled manner in order to maintain an adequate supply of the neurotransmitter. However, when glutamate molecules in the synaptic cleft cannot be degraded or reused, often due to dysfunction of the glutamate–glutamine cycle, the neuron becomes significantly overstimulated, leading to a neuronal cell death pathway known as apoptosis. Apoptosis occurs primarily via the increased intracellular concentrations of calcium ions, which flow into the cytosol through the activated glutamate receptors and lead to the activation of phospholipases, endonucleases, proteases, and thus the apoptotic cascade. Additional sources of neuronal cell death related to excitotoxicity involve energy rundown in the mitochondria and increased concentrations of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species within the cell.

====Treatment====

:Excitotoxic mechanisms are often involved in other conditions leading to neuronal damage, including hypoglycemia, trauma, stroke, seizures, and many neurodegenerative diseases, and thus have important implications in disease treatment. Recent studies have been performed that incorporate glutamate receptor antagonists and excitotoxic cascade disruptors in order to decrease stimulation of postsynaptic neurons, although these treatments are still undergoing active research.

===Related neurodegenerative diseases===

:Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia, or loss of brain function, and was first described by German psychiatrist and neuropathologist Alois Alzheimer in 1907. 9. Diagnosis of the disease often stems from clinical observation as well as analysis of family history and other risk factors, and often includes symptoms such as memory impairment and problems with language, decision-making, judgment, and personality. The primary neurological phenomena that lead to the above symptoms are often related to signaling at excitatory synapses, often due to excitotoxicity, and stem from the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, as well as neuronal cell death and synaptic pruning. The principle drug treatments on the market deal with antagonizing glutamate (NMDA) receptors at neuronal synapses, and inhibiting the activity of acetylcholinesterase. This treatment aims to limit the apoptosis of cerebral neurons caused by various pathways related to excitotoxicity, free radicals, and energy rundown. A number of labs are currently focusing on the prevention of amyloid plaques and other AD symptoms, often via the use of experimental vaccines, although this area of research is yet in its infancy.

:Parkinson&#x27;s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease resulting from the apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system, especially the substantia nigra, as well as heightened response to the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate (i.e., excitotoxicity). While the most obvious symptoms are related to motor skills, prolonged progression of the disease can lead to cognitive and behavioral problems as well as dementia. Although the mechanism of apoptosis in the brain is not entirely clear, speculation associates cell death with abnormal accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in cell occlusions known as Lewy bodies, as well as hyperstimulation of neuronal NMDA receptors with excessive glutamate neurotransmitter via the aforementioned pathway. Like Alzheimer&#x27;s, Parkinson&#x27;s Disease lacks a cure. Therefore, in addition to lifestyle changes and surgery, the goal of pharmaceutical drugs used in the treatment of PD patients is to control symptoms and limit, when possible, the progression of the disease. Levodopa (L-DOPA), the most widely used treatment of PD, is converted to dopamine in the body and helps to relieve the effect of decreased dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system. Other dopamine agonists have been administered to patients in an effort to mimic dopamine’s effect at excitatory synapses, binding its receptors and causing the desired postsynaptic response.

<text>The Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden in St Ives, Cornwall preserves the 20th-century sculptor Barbara Hepworth&#x27;s studio and garden much as they were when she lived and worked there. She purchased the site in 1949 and lived and worked there for 26 years until her death in a fire on the premises in 1975.

==History==

The studio, known as Trewyn Studio, was purchased by Barbara Hepworth in September 1949. Princess Anne visited Hepworth at her studio during her visit to St Ives in 1972.

Her living room is furnished as she left it, while the workshop remains full of her tools and equipment, materials, and part-worked pieces. The museum was opened by her family in 1976, after Barbara had left instructions to this effect in her will. It is the largest collection of her works that are on permanent display.

The sculptures featured at the museum (mainly in the secluded garden) were some of her favourites. Her workshop also includes a queue of uncut stones that one visitor has described as &quot;still waiting for their moment in the shadow of her workshop&quot;. In 1950 she acquired two huge blocks of Galway limestone which she carved into her Festival of Britain commission, the Contrapuntal Forms. A set of photographs in the museum shows the progress of this project. Wood carving was done in an upstairs room, and the bronze statues she started casting in 1956 had their origins in the plaster prototypes she worked on in the upper of the two outside studios.

She was helped in the creation of the garden by her friend, the South African-born composer Priaulx Rainier.

Barbara Hepworth died in a fire at this site in 1975, which was caused by one of her cigarettes making some package burn, when she was aged 72.

The family passed the museum to the Tate gallery in 1980 and they still manage it.

<text>Torus-based cryptography involves using algebraic tori to construct a group for use in ciphers based on the discrete logarithm problem. This idea was first introduced by Alice Silverberg and Karl Rubin in 2003 in the form of a public key algorithm by the name of CEILIDH. It improves on conventional cryptosystems by representing some elements of large finite fields compactly and therefore transmitting fewer bits.

<text>Swiss Re Ltd is a Swiss reinsurance company founded in 1863 and headquartered in Zürich, Switzerland. It is one of the world&#x27;s largest reinsurers, as measured by gross premiums written. Swiss Re operates through around 80 offices in 29 countries and employs over 14,000 people. It was ranked 519th on the Forbes Global 2000 list and ranked 316th on the &quot;Fortune&quot; Global 500 in 2023. Swiss Re is listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange.

==History==
On 10–11 May 1861, more than 500 houses went up in flames in the town of Glarus, Switzerland. Two-thirds of the town was reduced to rubble and ashes and around 3,000 inhabitants were made homeless. The damage to Glarus exceeded the reserves of the cantonal fire insurance, which had underinsured many cantonal buildings: the resulting loss was covered by donations, as well as a bond issue by the cantonal government. Similarly to the fire of Hamburg in 1842, which led to the foundation of the first professional reinsurers in Germany, the fire of Glarus made Swiss insurers demand more reinsurance coverage against catastrophic loss. As a result, Swiss Re was founded in Zürich as the first Swiss reinsurance company in 1863.

Swiss Re was a lead insurer of the World Trade Center at the time of the September 11 attacks, which led to an insurance dispute with the owner, Silverstein Properties. In October 2006, the New York appeals court ruled in favor of Swiss Re, stating that the destruction of the twin towers was a single event rather than two, limiting coverage to $3.5 billion.

Swiss Re acquired the GE Insurance Solutions property/casualty business in 2006, which made it the world&#x27;s largest reinsurer.

In 2009 Warren Buffett invested $2.6 billion when Swiss Re raised more equity capital after it lost 6 billion francs in its financial market operations in the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Berkshire Hathaway already owns a 3% stake, with rights to own more than 20%.

In May 2016, the Fort McMurray Canadian wildfires caused estimated damages of up to CAD10 billion, with Swiss Re having the most exposure among reinsurers.

Swiss Re&#x27;s Admin Re subsidiary began with the acquisition on 1 July 2004 of Life Assurance Holding Corporation in the UK. On 31 October 2008, Swiss Re completed a £762 million acquisition of Barclays PLC&#x27;s subsidiary Barclays Life Assurance Company Ltd. In June 2014, the company, through Admin Re, acquired the UK pensions business of HSBC Life (UK) Limited worth £4.2 billion. The Admin Re business, which was renamed ReAssure, was eventually sold to Phoenix Group Holdings for £3.2bn in July 2020.

In February 2022, it was announced that Swiss Re had acquired Champlain Reinsurance Company (Champlain Re), a Swiss-based run-off reinsurance captive of Alcan Holdings Switzerland AG, a member of Rio Tinto Alcan, in a legacy transaction. Later that month, Swiss Re declared a net profit of US$1.6 billion, in a bounce back from previous losses in 2020. Still, the exposure to COVID-19 in America was excessive; together with increased damages from natural catastrophes, profits were well below the US$1.8 billion estimate. Swiss Re was able to make up for some of its losses due to its increased property business. At the same time, the board of directors assured investors that the company is only minimally exposed to losses during the Ukraine crisis.

In December 2023, Swiss Re announced it had acquired research-led flood risk intelligence firm Fathom, which would retain its brand while working closely with the Reinsurance Solutions division to further develop and distribute its flood maps and models. 

==Business structure==
Swiss Re Group operates through three business units:

* Property &amp; Casualty Reinsurance
* Life &amp; Health Reinsurance
* Corporate Solutions

==Leadership==
Swiss Re&#x27;s leadership consists of the Board of Directors and the Group Executive Committee.

In April 2024, Swiss Re appointed Andreas Berger as Group CEO, effective 1 July 2024 replacing Christian Mumenthaler who has been Group CEO since 2016. 

== Offices ==

=== Zürich headquarters ===
Swiss Re is headquartered in Mythenquai, Zürich. Six buildings form Campus Mythenquai, with its historic headquarters being in the Altbau which was built in 1913. The majority of Swiss Re&#x27;s headquarters staff are located in the adjacent Swiss Re Next building.

===London office===

Its London office is located in the 30 St Mary Axe tower, which opened on 25 May 2004. The landmark London skyscraper, designed by architect Norman Foster and popularly known as &quot;the gherkin&quot;, was sold in February 2007 for over £600 million to IVG Immobilien AG of Germany and the Evans Randall property investment firm.

=== New York offices ===
Swiss Re has two offices in New York, its Manhattan office is located in 1301 Avenue of the Americas. The larger of the two offices is located in Armonk and overlooks the Kensico reservoir.

===Canadian offices===
Swiss Re has two Canadian offices, in Toronto and Vancouver; Swiss Reinsurance Company Canada was named one of Greater Toronto&#x27;s Top Employers by Mediacorp Canada, Inc., in October 2008, as announced by the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;.

<text>The 1984 UEFA European Football Championship final tournament was held in France from 12 to 27 June 1984. It was the seventh UEFA European Championship, a competition held every four years and endorsed by UEFA.

At the time, only eight countries took part in the final stage of the tournament, seven of which had to come through the qualifying stage. France qualified automatically as hosts of the event; in the tournament led by Michel Platini, who scored nine goals in France&#x27;s all five matches, which is still the record for goals scored in a single tournament and until 2020 also the record for goals scored by a single player at all tournaments. &quot;Les Bleus&quot; won the championship – their first major international title.

==Bid process==
The hosting of the event was contested by bids from France and West Germany. The French bid was unanimously selected by the UEFA Executive Committee at a meeting on 10 December 1981.

==Tournament summary==

===Group matches===
The opening game of tournament featured France and Denmark. The sides played out a very close encounter until Michel Platini&#x27;s goal on 78 minutes gave the hosts a 1–0 victory. The opening game also saw a premature end to the tournament for Danish midfielder Allan Simonsen, who suffered a broken leg. Platini then scored hat-tricks against both Belgium and Yugoslavia as the French recorded maximum points in Group 1. Denmark took second place in the group with victories over Belgium and Yugoslavia, while Belgium finished third with two points. Yugoslavia, despite going out with no points, gave the hosts a fright in their last group game when they took a 1–0 lead into half-time and then reduced France&#x27;s 3–1 lead to one goal six minutes from time. The games in Group 1 were unusually high-scoring, and featured 23 goals over the six matches.

Group 2 provided fewer goals, but produced a huge surprise as West Germany failed to qualify for the semi-finals after a 1–0 defeat in their last match to Spain with a late goal by Antonio Maceda, and a late Portugal win by Nené against Romania that sent the holders out.

===Semi-finals and final===
The first semi-final between France and Portugal is often considered one of the best matches in the history of the European Championship. Jean-François Domergue opened the scoring for France but Portugal equalised through Rui Jordão on 74 minutes. The game went to extra time and Jordão scored again in the 98th minute to give the Portuguese a shock lead, but the French rallied and Domergue equalised with six minutes left. Then, in the dying moments of the match and with a penalty shoot-out looming, Platini scored his eighth goal of the championship to give France a memorable 3–2 victory.

The other semi-final between Spain and Denmark saw two evenly matched sides draw 1–1 after extra time, as Søren Lerby&#x27;s goal after only seven minutes was cancelled out by Maceda’s strike an hour later. The match went to a penalty shoot-out, and Spain converted all five of their penalties to win 5–4 and reach the final for the first time since 1964. 
The final was played to a capacity crowd at the Parc des Princes in Paris. Just before the hour mark, Platini scored from a free-kick to put France ahead following a mistake by Spanish goalkeeper Luis Arconada. France were reduced to ten players when Yvon Le Roux was sent off, but Spain were unable to equalise, and Bruno Bellone&#x27;s goal in injury time made the final score 2–0. France had won their first major championship in world football.

==Qualification==

Portugal and Romania made their debuts in the European Championship. France, the hosts and eventual winners, qualified for the first time since inaugural tournament in 1960, which they also hosted. Denmark qualified for the first time since 1964. Yugoslavia qualified after missing the 1980 tournament. Notable absentees were the 1982 FIFA World Cup winners and Euro 1980 hosts Italy, as well as 1966 World Cup winners England, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands (who failed to qualify for the last time until 2016) and Hungary. 
===Qualified teams===


==Organisation==

===Tournament format===
After trying out several formats, UEFA finally developed for the 1984 tournament the format that would serve for all subsequent eight-team European Championships. The eight qualified teams were split into two groups of four that played a round-robin schedule. The top two teams of each group advanced to semi-finals (reintroduced after being absent from the 1980 tournament) and the winners advanced to the final. The third place play-off, widely perceived as an unnecessary chore, was dropped. As usual at the time, a win was credited with two points only, teams on equal points were ranked by goal difference instead of head-to-head results, and the sudden-death rule in extra time did not apply.

Fixtures were scheduled according to an innovative rotation schedule in which each team played its three first-round matches in three different stadia. Host France, for instance, played in Paris, Nantes, and Saint-Étienne. This formula had the advantage of exposing residents of a given city to more teams but implied multiple and sometimes costly trips from town to town for fans who wanted to follow their side. In subsequent championships, the organisers reverted to conventional schedules in which teams played in one or two cities only.

===Overall impressions===
Very few hooligan-related incidents were recorded throughout the tournament. Only one minor instance of fan trouble was recorded, in Strasbourg around the West Germany vs. Portugal match. The small group of German hooligans responsible for the incidents was arrested and deported back to West Germany on the same day using a new law specially passed by the French Parliament ahead of the Euro. Overall, the organisation was flawless, a feat that established France&#x27;s credentials as a host nation and eventually helped it win the right to stage the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

The entire competition was marked by exceptionally fine weather which, along with the high quality of play throughout the tournament (a welcome change from the 1980 European Championship) and the absence of hooligans, contributed to a very positive and enjoyable experience for teams and fans alike.

===Mascot===
The official mascot of this European Championship was Peno, a rooster, representing the emblem of the host nation, France. It has the number 84 on the left side of its chest and its outfit is the same as the France national team, blue shirt, white shorts and red socks.

==Venues==
France&#x27;s winning bid to host the Euro was based on seven stadia. The 48,000-seat Parc des Princes in Paris was the venue for the opening match and the final. Built in 1972, it was still state-of-the-art in 1984 and needed minor improvements only. Marseille&#x27;s Stade Vélodrome was expanded to 55,000 seats to host one semi-final and some group matches, becoming France&#x27;s largest stadium on the occasion. Stade de Gerland in Lyon, the venue for the other semi-final and some group matches as well, was thoroughly renovated and expanded to 40,000. Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in Saint-Étienne and Stade Félix-Bollaert in Lens were the other existing stadia that hosted group matches and were expanded to 53,000 and 49,000, respectively. Lastly, two all-new stadia were built to host group matches (and subsequently provided worthy home grounds for the traditionally strong local club teams): Stade de la Beaujoire in Nantes (53,000) was built on an entirely new site while Stade de la Meinau in Strasbourg was rebuilt from the ground up on the site of the old stadium into a modern 40,000-seat arena.

==Group stage==
The teams finishing in the top two positions in each of the two groups progress to the semi-finals, while the bottom two teams in each group were eliminated from the tournament.

&quot;All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).&quot;

===Tiebreakers===
If two or more teams finished level on points after completion of the group matches, the following tie-breakers were used to determine the final ranking:
# Goal difference in all group matches
# Greater number of goals scored in all group matches
# Drawing of lots

<doc id="563233" wikidata="Q2633161" url="?curid=563233" title="Machiko Soga">
<text>was a Japanese actress and voice actress. She also performed by the stage name Stella Soga.

== Life and career ==

=== Early life and family ===
Machiko was born on March 18, 1938, in Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan. She had a humble upbringing and was raised to be a singer, though her talents were with acting. Her mother died when she was a child; she was raised by her father. She had two brothers and a sister. One of her brothers died during the Second World War; the other is still alive. Her father died of cancer in 1991.

She studied at Tokyo Metropolitan Minamitama High School. During high school, she was best at science and mathematics and made her own lotions. She decided to pursue a career in acting to overcome stage fright after she failed a chemistry presentation at school. She later graduated from Tokyo Announce Academy. In 1973, she went to study in Italy for two years.

=== Career ===
She was &quot;discovered&quot; after doing a play in Tokyo Center. From that night on, her life would forever change as she met many important figures in the world of Japanese television.

She made her debut on NHK&#x27;s children&#x27;s show &quot;Minna issho&quot; in 1956. After taking jazz dance lessons for a number of years, her first roles were mainly radio and voice character roles. After appearing in NHK&#x27;s radio drama &quot;Chorinmura to Kurumi no Ki&quot; (1961), she gained fame as the first voice actress to portray the lovable ghost Q-taro in &quot;Obake no Q-tarō&quot; (TBS, 1965–1968).

She appeared in numerous &quot;tokusatsu&quot; films and series and played many villainous roles in the Super Sentai franchise such as Queen Hedrian in &quot;Denziman&quot; and &quot;Sun Vulcan&quot;. She also appeared in &quot;Maskman&quot; portraying Tube Empire&#x27;s field commander, Baraba&#x27;s mother for one episode, as well as the evil sorceress Bandora in &quot;Zyuranger&quot;, better known to audiences in English speaking countries as Rita Repulsa in the American adaptation of &quot;Zyuranger&quot;, &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;. In an odd twist, she soon found herself re-dubbing her own lines as Rita when &quot;Power Rangers&quot; was broadcast in Japan after the show became a surprise hit in America. Her final tokusatsu role was Magiel, Queen of the Sky Saints in &quot;Magiranger&quot;, which incidentally was one of her few non-villainous roles. In her memory, the producers of &quot;Power Rangers: Mystic Force&quot; used footage of Soga as Magiel to depict a reformed Rita Repulsa in the two-part final episode of &quot;Mystic Force&quot;, &quot;Mystic Fate&quot;.

In 1983, she opened an antiques shop in Harajuku, Tokyo, as a side-business alongside her acting career, inspired by her antique art collection hobby.

Her very final role was in the PlayStation 2 game &quot;Space Sheriff Spirits&quot; as the voice and the &quot;face&quot; of Ankoku Ginga Jyoou (Dark Galaxy Queen), last boss and original character of this game inspired to the 80s Metal Hero series. Soga also played the voices of Cyborg 007 in the 1968 &quot;Cyborg 009&quot; anime series and the sidekick Ball Boy in 1984 series &quot;Machineman&quot;. Machiko also ran her own shop, selling jewellery, antique clothing, and tapestries among other goods.

=== Death ===
In early August 2005, it was revealed that she had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer about two years earlier. On the morning of May 7, 2006, she was found dead by a friend visiting her home. She was 68 years old. Her interment was in Fuchū, Tokyo&#x27;s Tama Cemetery. Juken Sentai Gekiranger vs Boukenger was dedicated to her memory.

&quot;The Raven&quot; features new and very different versions of two songs that Reed had released on earlier albums: &quot;Perfect Day&quot; (originally found on 1972&#x27;s &quot;Transformer&quot;) and &quot;The Bed&quot; (from 1973&#x27;s &quot;Berlin&quot;). In addition to Reed, the album features a number of guest vocalists including Laurie Anderson, David Bowie, Anohni Hegarty, Steve Buscemi and Willem Dafoe. The co-producer of the album, Hal Willner, had previously overseen the Poe tribute album &quot;Closed on Account of Rabies&quot;.

The recording was simultaneously released as a two-disc set of recordings and in an edited single-disc version. Painter and filmmaker Julian Schnabel created the cover. &quot;The Raven&quot; would prove to be the final solo rock album by Reed, as 2007&#x27;s &quot;Hudson River Wind Meditations&quot; consisted entirely of meditational new-age music, and 2011&#x27;s &quot;Lulu&quot; was a collaborative rock album with heavy metal band Metallica.

<doc id="563239" wikidata="Q289472" url="?curid=563239" title="Biogenic substance">
<text>A biogenic substance is a product made by or of life forms. While the term originally was specific to metabolite compounds that had toxic effects on other organisms, it has developed to encompass any constituents, secretions, and metabolites of plants or animals. In context of molecular biology, biogenic substances are referred to as biomolecules. They are generally isolated and measured through the use of chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques. Additionally, the transformation and exchange of biogenic substances can by modelled in the environment, particularly their transport in waterways.

The observation and measurement of biogenic substances is notably important in the fields of geology and biochemistry. A large proportion of isoprenoids and fatty acids in geological sediments are derived from plants and chlorophyll, and can be found in samples extending back to the Precambrian. These biogenic substances are capable of withstanding the diagenesis process in sediment, but may also be transformed into other materials. This makes them useful as biomarkers for geologists to verify the age, origin and degradation processes of different rocks.

Biogenic substances have been studied as part of marine biochemistry since the 1960s, which has involved investigating their production, transport, and transformation in the water, and how they may be used in industrial applications. A large fraction of biogenic compounds in the marine environment are produced by micro and macro algae, including cyanobacteria. Due to their antimicrobial properties they are currently the subject of research in both industrial projects, such as for anti-fouling paints, or in medicine.

== History of discovery and classification ==

During a meeting of the New York Academy of Sciences&#x27; Section of Geology and Mineralogy in 1903, geologist Amadeus William Grabau proposed a new rock classification system in his paper &#x27;Discussion of and Suggestions Regarding a New Classification of Rocks&#x27;. Within the primary subdivision of &quot;Endogenetic rocks&quot; – rocks formed through chemical processes – was a category termed &quot;Biogenic rocks&quot;, which was used synonymously with &quot;Organic rocks&quot;. Other secondary categories were &quot;Igneous&quot; and &quot;Hydrogenic&quot; rocks.

In the 1930s German chemist Alfred E. Treibs first detected biogenic substances in petroleum as part of his studies of porphyrins. Based on this research, there was a later increase in the 1970s in the investigation of biogenic substances in sedimentary rocks as part of the study of geology. This was facilitated by the development of more advanced analytical methods, and led to greater collaboration between geologists and organic chemists in order to research the biogenic compounds in sediments.

Researchers additionally began to investigate the production of compounds by microorganisms in the marine environment during the early 1960s. By 1975, different research areas had developed in the study of marine biochemistry. These were &quot;marine toxins, marine bioproducts and marine chemical ecology&quot;. Following this in 1994, Teuscher and Lindequist defined biogenic substances as &quot;chemical compounds which are synthesised by living organisms and which, if they exceed certain concentrations, cause temporary or permanent damage or even death of other organisms by chemical or physicochemical effects&quot; in their book, Biogene Gifte. This emphasis in research and classification on the toxicity of biogenic substances was partly due to the cytotoxicity-directed screening assays that were used to detect the biologically active compounds. The diversity of biogenic products has since been expanded from cytotoxic substances through the use of alternative pharmaceutical and industrial assays.

== In the environment ==

=== Hydroecology ===

Through studying the transport of biogenic substances in the Tatar Strait in the Sea of Japan, a Russian team noted that biogenic substances can enter the marine environment due to input from either external sources, transport inside the water masses, or development by metabolic processes within the water. They can likewise be expended due to biotransformation processes, or biomass formation by microorganisms. In this study the biogenic substance concentrations, transformation frequency, and turnover were all highest in the upper layer of the water. Additionally, in different regions of the strait the biogenic substances with the highest annual transfer were constant. These were O2, DOC, and DISi, which are normally found in large concentrations in natural water. The biogenic substances that tend to have lower input through the external boundaries of the strait and therefore least transfer were mineral and detrital components of N and P. These same substances take active part in biotransformation processes in the marine environment and have lower annual output as well.

=== Geological sites ===

Organic geochemists also have an interest in studying the diagenesis of biogenic substances in petroleum and how they are transformed in sediment and fossils. While 90% of this organic material is insoluble in common organic solvents – called kerogen – 10% is in a form that is soluble and can be extracted, from where biogenic compounds can then be isolated. Saturated linear fatty acids and pigments have the most stable chemical structures and are therefore suited to withstanding degradation from the diagenesis process and being detected in their original forms. However, macromolecules have also been found in protected geological regions. Typical sedimentation conditions involve enzymatic, microbial and physicochemical processes as well as increased temperature and pressure, which lead to transformations of biogenic substances. For example, pigments that arise from dehydrogenation of chlorophyll or hemin can be found in many sediments as nickel or vanadyl complexes. A large proportion of the isoprenoids in sediments are also derived from chlorophyll. Similarly, linear saturated fatty acids discovered in the Messel oil shale of the Messel Pit in Germany arise from organic material of vascular plants.

Additionally, alkanes and isoprenoids are found in soluble extracts of Precambrian rock, indicating the probable existence of biological material more than three billion years ago. However, there is the potential that these organic compounds are abiogenic in nature, especially in Precambrian sediments. While Studier et al.&#x27;s (1968) simulations of the synthesis of isoprenoids in abiogenic conditions did not produce the long-chain isoprenoids used as biomarkers in fossils and sediments, traces of C9-C14 isoprenoids were detected. It is also possible for polyisoprenoid chains to be stereoselectively synthesised using catalysts such as Al(C2H5)3 – VCl3. However, the probability of these compounds being available in the natural environment is unlikely.

== Measurement ==

The different biomolecules that make up a plant&#x27;s biogenic substances – particularly those in seed exudates - can be identified by using different varieties of chromatography in a lab environment. For metabolite profiling, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry is used to find flavonoids such as quercetin. Compounds can then be further differentiated using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

When it comes to measuring biogenic substances in a natural environment such as a body of water, a hydroecological CNPSi model can be used to calculate the spatial transport of biogenic substances, in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions. This model takes into account the water exchange and flow rate, and yields the values of biogenic substance rates for any area or layer of the water for any month. There are two main evaluation methods involved: measuring per unit water volume (mg/m3 year) and measuring substances per entire water volume of layer (t of element/year). The former is mostly used to observe biogenic substance dynamics and individual pathways for flux and transformations, and is useful when comparing individual regions of the strait or waterway. The second method is used for monthly substance fluxes and must take into account that there are monthly variations in the water volume in the layers.

In the study of geochemistry, biogenic substances can be isolated from fossils and sediments through a process of scraping and crushing the target rock sample, then washing with 40% hydrofluoric acid, water, and benzene/methanol in the ratio 3:1. Following this, the rock pieces are ground and centrifuged to produce a residue. Chemical compounds are then derived through various chromatography and mass spectrometry separations. However, extraction should be accompanied by rigorous precautions to ensure there is no amino acid contaminants from fingerprints, or silicone contaminants from other analytical treatment methods.

== Applications ==
=== Anti-fouling paints ===
Metabolites produced by marine algae have been found to have many antimicrobial properties. This is because they are produced by the marine organisms as chemical deterrents and as such contain bioactive compounds. The principal classes of marine algae that produce these types of secondary metabolites are Cyanophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Rhodophyceae. Observed biogenic products include polyketides, amides, alkaloids, fatty acids, indoles and lipopeptides. For example, over 10% of compounds isolated from &quot;Lyngbya majuscula&quot;, which is one of the most abundant cyanobacteria, have antifungal and antimicrobial properties. Additionally, a study by Ren et al. (2002) tested halogenated furanones produced by &quot;Delisea pulchra&quot; from the Rhodophyceae class against the growth of &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;. When applied at a 40 μg/mL concentration, the furanone inhibited the formation of a biofilm by the bacteria and reduced the biofilm&#x27;s thickness by 25% and the number of live cells by 63%.

These characteristics then have the potential to be utilised in man-made materials, such as making anti-fouling paints without the environment-damaging chemicals. Environmentally safe alternatives are needed to TBT (tin-based antifouling agent) which releases toxic compounds into water and the environment and has been banned in several countries. A class of biogenic compounds that has had a sizeable effect against the bacteria and microalgae that cause fouling are acetylene sesquiterpenoid esters produced by &quot;Caulerpa prolifera&quot; (from the Chlorophyceae class), which Smyrniotopoulos et al. (2003) observed inhibiting bacterial growth with up to 83% of the efficacy of TBT oxide.

Current research also aims to produce these biogenic substances on a commercial level using metabolic engineering techniques. By pairing these techniques with biochemical engineering design, algae and their biogenic substances can be produced on a large scale using photobioreactors. Different system types can be used to yield different biogenic products. 
=== Paleochemotaxonomy ===
In the field of paleochemotaxonomy the presence of biogenic substances in geological sediments is useful for comparing old and modern biological samples and species. These biological markers can be used to verify the biological origin of fossils and serve as paleo-ecological markers. For example, the presence of pristane indicates that the petroleum or sediment is of marine origin, while biogenic material of non-marine origin tends to be in the form of polycyclic compounds or phytane. The biological markers also provide valuable information about the degradation reactions of biological material in geological environments. Comparing the organic material between geologically old and recent rocks shows the conservation of different biochemical processes.

=== Metallic nanoparticle production ===

Another application of biogenic substances is in the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles. The current chemical and physical production methods for nanoparticles used are costly and produce toxic waste and pollutants in the environment. Additionally, the nanoparticles that are produced can be unstable and unfit for use in the body. Using plant-derived biogenic substances aims to create an environmentally-friendly and cost-effective production method. The biogenic phytochemicals used for these reduction reactions can be derived from plants in numerous ways, including a boiled leaf broth, biomass powder, whole plant immersion in solution, or fruit and vegetable juice extracts. &quot;C. annuum&quot; juices have been shown to produce Ag nanoparticles at room temperature when treated with silver ions and additionally deliver essential vitamins and amino acids when consumed, making them a potential nanomaterials agent. Another procedure is through the use of a different biogenic substance: the exudate of germinating seeds. When seeds are soaked, they passively release phytochemicals into the surrounding water, which after reaching equilibrium can be mixed with metal ions to synthesise metallic nanoparticles. &quot;M. sativa&quot; exudate in particular has had success in effectively producing Ag metallic particles, while &quot;L. culinaris&quot; is an effective reactant for manufacturing Au nanoparticles. This process can also be further adjusted by manipulating factors such as pH, temperature, exudate dilution and plant origin to produce different shapes of nanoparticles, including triangles, spheres, rods, and spirals. These biogenic metallic nanoparticles then have applications as catalysts, glass window coatings to insulate heat, in biomedicine, and in biosensor devices.

==Examples==

<text>A biogenic amine is a biogenic substance with one or more amine groups. They are basic nitrogenous compounds formed mainly by decarboxylation of amino acids or by amination and transamination of aldehydes and ketones. Biogenic amines are organic bases with low molecular weight and are synthesized by microbial, vegetable and animal metabolisms. In food and beverages they are formed by the enzymes of raw material or are generated by microbial decarboxylation of amino acids.

== List of notable biogenic amines ==

===Monoamines===

Some prominent examples of biogenic monoamines include:

Monoamine neurotransmitters
* Imidazoleamines
** Histamine – a substance derived from the amino acid histidine that acts as a neurotransmitter mediating arousal and attention, as well as a pro-inflammatory signal released from mast cells in response to allergic reactions or tissue damage. Histamine is also an important stimulant of HCl secretion by the stomach through histamine H2 receptors.
* Indolamines
** Serotonin – a central nervous system neurotransmitter derived from the amino acid tryptophan involved in regulating mood, sleep, appetite, and sexuality.
* The three catecholamine neurotransmitters:
** Norepinephrine (noradrenaline) – a neurotransmitter involved in sleep and wakefulness, attention, and feeding behavior, as well as a stress hormone released by the adrenal glands that regulates the sympathetic nervous system.
** Epinephrine (adrenaline) – an adrenal stress hormone, as well as a neurotransmitter present at lower levels in the brain.
** Dopamine – a neurotransmitter involved in motivation, reward, addiction, behavioral reinforcement, and coordination of bodily movement.

Trace amines (endogenous amines that activate the human TAAR1 receptor)
Tryptamines
* &quot;N&quot;-Methyltryptamine
* &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-Dimethyltryptamine

Other biogenic monoamines
* Trimethylamine
* Trimethylamine &quot;N&quot;-oxide
* Indoleamines
** Melatonin
** 6-Hydroxymelatonin
** N-Acetylserotonin

===Polyamines===
Examples of notable biogenic polyamines include:
* Agmatine
* Cadaverine
* Putrescine
* Spermine
* Spermidine

== Physiological importance ==

There is a distinction between endogenous and exogenous biogenic amines. Endogenous amines are produced in many different tissues (for example: adrenaline in adrenal medulla or histamine in mast cells and liver). Serotonin, an endogenous amine, is a neurotransmitter derived from the amino acid tryptophan. Serotonin is involved in regulating mood, sleep, appetite, and sexuality. The amines are transmitted locally or via the blood system. The exogenous amines are directly absorbed from food in the intestine. Alcohol can increase the absorption rate. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) breaks down biogenic amines and prevents excessive resorption. MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) are also used as medications for the treatment of depression to prevent MAO from breaking down amines important for positive mood.

== Importance in food ==
Biogenic amines can be found in all foods containing proteins or free amino acids and are found in a wide range of food products including fish products, meat products, dairy products, wine, beer, vegetables, fruits, nuts and chocolate. In non-fermented foods the presence of biogenic amines is mostly undesired and can be used as indication for microbial spoilage. In fermented foods, one can expect the presence of many kinds of microorganisms, some of them being capable of producing biogenic amines.
Some lactic acid bacteria isolated from commercial bottled yoghurt have been shown to produce biogenic amines. 
They play an important role as source of nitrogen and precursor for the synthesis of hormones, alkaloids, nucleic acids, proteins, amines and food aroma components. However, food containing high amounts of biogenic amines may have toxicological effects.

=== Determination of biogenic amines in wines ===
Biogenic amines are naturally present in grapes or can occur during the vinification and aging processes, essentially due to the microorganism&#x27;s activity. When present in wines in high amount, biogenic amines may cause not only organoleptic defects but also adverse effects in sensitive human individuals, namely due to the toxicity of histamine, tyramine and putrescine. Even though there are no legal limits for the concentration of biogenic amines in wines, some European countries only recommend maximum limits for histamine. In this sense, biogenic amines in wines have been widely studied. The determination of amines in wines is commonly achieved by liquid chromatography, using derivatization reagents in order to promote its separation and detection. In alternative, other promising methodologies have been developed using capillary electrophoresis or biosensors, revealing lower costs and faster results, without needing a derivatization step. It is still a challenge to develop faster and inexpensive techniques or methodologies to apply in the wine industry.

<text>The Sugar River is a tributary of the Pecatonica River, approximately long, in the U.S. states of Wisconsin and Illinois.

==Geography==
The river rises in the hills of southwest Wisconsin, in southwest Dane County, approximately southwest of Madison. The headwaters are at the southern terminus of the last North American glacier. West of the river, the land elevates from lack of glaciation and joins the Driftless Area, known for its abrupt hills and valleys, covering most of southwest Wisconsin. From its source, the river meanders southeast, past Paoli and Belleville, where it is dammed to form Lake Belle View. From there it meanders east of Monticello where it is joined by the Little Sugar River and flows south through Albany, and Brodhead. It crosses into northern Illinois flowing past an extensive area of the Forest Preserves of Winnebago County system. These preserves are Sugar River Alder, Colored Sands, and Sugar River. The river joins the Pecatonica River in northern Winnebago County near Shirland, approximately south of the state line and approximately north-northwest of Rockford.

The Sugar River State Trail is a abandoned railroad line used for walking, bicycling, snowmobiling, and cross-country skiing.

Five organizations have been established to protect the watershed around the upper and lower stretches of the Sugar River. The Upper Sugar River Watershed Association manages the watershed north of Belleville and the Lower Sugar River Watershed Association manages the watershed south of Albany. The area in between, the Middle Sugar River Watershed, is managed by Lake Winnetka Sugar River Improvement Association and the Green County River Rats from Attica through Albany. The Decatur Lake and Mill Race Association manages Decatur Lake and waters that run through Brodhead from the head waters of the lake to the old power plant spillway.

==Activities==
There is some great fishing on the Sugar River. Species include panfish, catfish, bass, walleye, and northern pike for anglers. Those who bow fish can have great success on lakes in Albany and Brodhead as well as oxbows on the river for carp and other rough fish. The river is a popular destination for kayakers, canoers, and tubers, with multiple companies existing that rent tubes and provide transportation to customers desiring to float the river. Accidents and drowning deaths have occurred on the river; some as the result of excessive drinking, high current, or a combination of both.

<text>David Mathieson Walker (May 20, 1944 – April 23, 2001), (Capt, USN), was an American naval officer and aviator, fighter pilot, test pilot, and a former NASA astronaut. He flew aboard four Space Shuttle missions in the 1980s and 1990s.

==Personal life==
Walker was born May 20, 1944, in Columbus, Georgia. In his youth, he was a Boy Scout with Troop 8 in Eustis, Florida, and earned its highest rank of Eagle Scout. He died on April 23, 2001, from cancer; he was 56 years old and was being treated at University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. His wife, the former Paige Lucas, and two adult sons from a previous marriage survived him. He was interred at Arlington National Cemetery on May 24, 2001.

==Education==
*1962: Graduated from Eustis High School, Eustis, Florida
*1966: Received a Bachelor of Science degree from the United States Naval Academy

==Military career==

Walker graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland and subsequently received flight training from the Naval Air Training Command at bases in Florida, Mississippi, and Texas. He was designated a Naval Aviator in December 1967 and proceeded to Naval Air Station Miramar, California, for assignment to F-4 Phantoms aboard the aircraft carriers USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; and USS &quot;America&quot;. From December 1970 to 1971, he attended the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California, and was subsequently assigned in January 1972 as an experimental and engineering test pilot in the flight test division at the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School, NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. While there, he participated in the Navy&#x27;s preliminary evaluation and Board of Inspection and Survey trials of the F-14 Tomcat and tested a leading edge slat modification to the F-4 Phantom. He then attended the United States Navy Safety Officer School at Monterey, California, and completed replacement pilot training in the F-14 Tomcat at NAS Miramar, California. In 1975, Walker was assigned to Fighter Squadron 142 (VF-142), stationed at NAS Oceana, Virginia, as a fighter pilot and was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea twice aboard the USS &quot;America&quot;.

He logged more than 7,500 hours flying time, with over 6,500 hours in jet aircraft.

==NASA career==
One of 35 candidates selected by NASA in January 1978 for the new Space Shuttle program, Walker became an astronaut in August 1979. Among his technical assignments, he served as Astronaut Office Safety Officer; technical assistant to the Director of Flight Crew Operations in 1981; a chase pilot on STS-1; software verification at the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL); mission support group leader for STS-5 and STS-6; Assistant to the Director, Flight Crew Operations; leader of the astronaut support team at Kennedy Space Center in 1985; Branch Chief, Space Station Design and Development; and Special Manager for Assembly, Space Station Project Office. From July 1993 to June 1994, Walker was Chief of the Station/Exploration Support Office, Flight Crew Operations Directorate, after which he chaired the JSC Safety Review Board.

A veteran of four spaceflights, Walker logged nearly 725 hours in space. He was the pilot on STS-51-A in 1984, and was the commander of STS-30 in 1989, STS-53 in 1992 and STS-69 in 1995.

Walker was in training to command STS-61-G, scheduled for a May 1986 launch when the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster forced NASA to suspend all Shuttle flights. In 1989, while piloting a NASA T-38 Talon to Washington, D.C. for ceremonies honoring the crew of STS-30, Walker came within 100 ft (30 m) of striking a Pan Am jetliner. That encounter and other infractions of NASA flying rules caused him to be grounded from July to September 1990, costing him the command of STS-44.

===Spaceflights===

STS-51-A &quot;Discovery&quot; (November 8–16, 1984) was launched from and returned to land at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. During the mission the crew deployed two satellites, Canada&#x27;s Anik D-2 (Telesat H), and Hughes&#x27; LEASAT-1 (Syncom IV-1). In the first space salvage mission in history, the crew also retrieved for return to Earth the Palapa B-2 and Westar VI satellites. Mission duration was 127 Earth orbits in 7 days, 23 hours, 44 minutes, 56 seconds.
STS-30 &quot;Atlantis&quot; (May 4–8, 1989) was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida. During the 4-day mission, the crew successfully deployed the Magellan Venus-exploration spacecraft, the first U.S. planetary science mission launched since 1978, and the first planetary probe to be deployed from the Shuttle. Magellan arrived at Venus in August 1990, and mapped over 95% of the surface of Venus. In addition, the crew also worked on secondary payloads involving fluid research in general, chemistry, and electrical storm studies. Following 64 orbits of the Earth, the STS-30 mission concluded with the first cross-wind landing test of the Shuttle Orbiter at Edwards Air Force Base, California.
STS-53 &quot;Discovery&quot; (December 2–9, 1992) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and also returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During 115 Earth orbits, the five-man crew deployed a classified Department of Defense payload DOD-1 and then performed several Military-Man-in-Space and NASA experiments. Mission duration was 175 hours, 19 minutes, 17 seconds.
STS-69 &quot;Endeavour&quot; (September 7–18, 1995) was launched from and returned to land at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. During the mission the crew successfully deployed and retrieved a SPARTAN satellite and the Wake Shield Facility. Also on board was the International Extreme Ultraviolet Hitchhiker payload, and numerous secondary payloads and medical experiments. Mission duration was 10 days, 20 hours, 28 minutes.

==Business career==
In April 1996, Walker retired from the Navy and left NASA to become Vice President for sales and marketing for NDC Voice Communications in San Diego, California. He joined Ultrafast, Inc. of Malvern, Pennsylvania in April 1999 as Vice President of aerospace sales. Later he retired to McCall, Idaho, however he sometimes worked as a consultant to the Aerospace Industry. In 1998, Walker served as space technology consultant on the film &quot;Deep Impact&quot;.

<text>The Workers&#x27; Communist Party () was a Canadian Marxist–Leninist political party, founded in 1975 under the name Communist (Marxist–Leninist) League of Canada (&quot;Ligue communiste (marxiste-léniniste) du Canada&quot;). The party followed a Maoist political program and was part of the broader New Left movement. For several years it published a weekly newspaper, &quot;The Forge&quot; (&quot;La Forge&quot;). The party was strongest in Quebec, but alienated many of Quebec&#x27;s young progressives because it declined to support independence for Quebec, although it did support Quebec&#x27;s right to self-determination.

The most prominent former member of the Workers&#x27; Communist Party is Gilles Duceppe, former leader of the Bloc Québécois and former Leader of the Official Opposition in the House of Commons of Canada. Duceppe called his membership &quot;a mistake&quot; based on a search for &quot;absolute answers&quot; during his youth. Judy Darcy was active in the party before joining the New Democratic Party. She later became a trade union leader and a cabinet minister in British Columbia.

The Workers&#x27; Communist Party nominated 30 candidates in the 1980 Canadian federal election and 33 in the 1981 Quebec general election; the party achieved its best result in the latter, receiving 4,956 votes, or 0.14% of the provincial total.

<text>Albert Coates (* 11 jul./23 April 1881greg. &quot;[deviant: 1882]&quot; – 11 December 1953) was an English conductor and composer. Born in Saint Petersburg, where his English father was a successful businessman, he studied in Russia, England and Germany, before beginning his career as a conductor in a series of German opera houses. He was a success in England conducting Wagner at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in 1914, and in 1919 was appointed chief conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra.

His strengths as a conductor lay in opera and the Russian repertory, but he was not thought as impressive in the core Austro-German symphonic repertory. After 1923 he failed to secure a permanent conductorship in the UK, and for much of the rest of his life guest-conducted in continental Europe and the US. In his last years he conducted in South Africa, where he died at 71.

As a composer, Coates is little remembered, but he composed seven operas, one of which, &quot;Pickwick&quot;, was performed at Covent Garden and was the first opera to be televised on the newly launched BBC, in November 1936. He also wrote some concert works for orchestral forces.

==Early years==
Coates was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, the youngest of seven sons of a Yorkshire father, Charles Thomas Coates, who managed the Russian branch of an English company, and Mary Ann Gibson, who was born and raised in Russia to British parents. He learned the violin, cello and piano as a child in Russia, and was raised in England after turning twelve. After attending the Liverpool Institute High School for Boys and the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, he studied science at Liverpool University.

Coates returned to Russia to join his father&#x27;s company, but he also studied composition with Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. In 1900, he entered the Leipzig Conservatory, to study the cello with Julius Klengel and the piano with Robert Teichmüller, but was drawn to conducting in Artur Nikisch&#x27;s conducting classes.

Nikisch appointed Coates répétiteur at the Leipzig opera, and he made his debut as a conductor in 1904 with Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;. He was engaged as the conductor of the Elberfeld opera house in 1906, in succession to Fritz Cassirer. From there he progressed to the post of assistant conductor at the Semperoper, Dresden (1907–08), under Ernst von Schuch and Mannheim in 1909 under Artur Bodanzky. He made his London debut in May 1910, conducting the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) in a programme consisting of a symphony by Maximilian Steinberg, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s First Piano Concerto and Beethoven&#x27;s Seventh Symphony. &quot;The Times&quot; judged him &quot;sound and artistic&quot;, though &quot;not particularly inspiring to watch.&quot; In the same year, he was invited by Eduard Nápravník to conduct in St. Petersburg&#x27;s Mariinsky Theatre.

Coates&#x27;s conducting of &quot;Siegfried&quot; at the Mariinsky led to his appointment as principal conductor of the Russian Imperial Opera, a post he held for five years, during which he became associated with leading Russian musicians, including Alexander Scriabin, for whose music he became a strong advocate. In July 1910, he married Ella Lizzie Holland.

==International career==
Coates first appeared at Covent Garden in 1914 in a Wagner season. He won critical praise for his performance of &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; and particularly for his conducting of &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot;. His conducting of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; later in the same season was also well received, his &quot;Parsifal&quot; less so.

The Russian Revolution in 1917 did not at first adversely affect Coates. The Soviet government appointed him &quot;President of all Opera Houses in Soviet Russia&quot;, based in Moscow. By 1919, however, living conditions in Russia had become desperate. Coates became seriously ill, and with considerable difficulty left Russia with his family by way of Finland in April 1919. After his arrival in England, he was appointed chief conductor of the LSO. Reviewing his first performance in the post, &quot;The Times&quot; praised him warmly, along with the younger Adrian Boult and Geoffrey Toye, in an article on &quot;The Conductor&#x27;s Art&quot;. In September 1919, he was appointed to teach a new class for operatic training at the Royal College of Music. Reporting the appointment, &quot;The Times&quot; wrote, &quot;There can scarcely be a musician in this country with so wide and cosmopolitan an experience of operatic performance.&quot;

The following month, there occurred an incident for which Coates is remembered in many books and articles. The LSO gave the world premiere of Elgar&#x27;s Cello Concerto under the baton of the composer, but Coates, who was conducting the rest of the programme, appropriated most of Elgar&#x27;s allotted rehearsal time. As a result, the orchestra gave a notoriously inadequate performance. Elgar did not complain publicly, but the musical world knew privately of Coates&#x27;s behaviour. With this exception, Coates served English composers well in the post-war years, giving the first performances of large-scale works including Vaughan Williams&#x27;s revised &quot;A London Symphony&quot; (1920), Delius&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; (1922), Bax&#x27;s First Symphony (1922), and Holst&#x27;s Choral Symphony (1925). He conducted many other early performances of music by contemporary English composers, including the second complete performance of Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot; in 1920, two years after its premiere. Among works from continental Europe introduced to England by Coates were Prokofiev&#x27;s Third Piano Concerto and Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Fourth Piano Concerto, each with its composer as soloist. In January 1926, he gave the first stage performance outside Russia of Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s opera &quot;The Invisible City of Kitezh&quot;, at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona.

After his contract with the LSO expired in 1922, Coates held no more permanent conductorships in the UK, although he directed the Leeds music festivals of 1922 and 1925. In 1923, he was appointed joint principal conductor with Eugene Goossens of the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra in the US. He was among the co-founders of Vladimir Rosing&#x27;s pioneering American Opera Company. Coates left Rochester in 1925 as a result of a disagreement with the orchestra&#x27;s sponsor, George Eastman, over artistic policy. The reason for his failure to secure a permanent position in the UK was, according to one commentator, that although he was a fine conductor of opera and of Russian concert music, &quot;his interpretations of the Viennese classics were less acceptable&quot; and as the latter were more important in British musical life, &quot;Coates failed to win for himself the highest reputation among his own countrymen.&quot;

==Later years==
In 1925, Coates was invited to Paris to conduct at the Opéra. He continued to make regular guest appearances in many of the world&#x27;s artistic centres until 1939. He conducted opera in Italy (1927 to 1929) and Germany (Berlin State Opera, 1931), and concerts with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra (1935) and in the Netherlands, Sweden and the USSR, which he visited three times.
On 13 November 1936 the BBC broadcast the world&#x27;s first televised opera: scenes from Coates&#x27;s &quot;Pickwick&quot;, directed by Rosing, were shown in advance of the work&#x27;s premiere. Coates and Rosing launched a season of the British Music Drama Opera Company at Covent Garden the following week. In 1938 he conducted George Lloyd&#x27;s opera &#x27;The Serf&#x27; at Covent Garden with The New English Opera Company, directed by Rosing.

When World War II broke out, Coates moved to the US. There, together with Rosing, he founded the Southern California Opera Association. Productions included Coates&#x27;s opera &quot;Gainsborough&#x27;s Duchess&quot;. He guest conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic and worked briefly in Hollywood, making cameo appearances in two 1944 MGM films, Two Girls and a Sailor and Song of Russia.

In 1946, Coates moved to South Africa, accepting the conductorships of the Johannesburg Symphony Orchestra and, later, the Cape Town Municipal Orchestra. He settled in Milnerton, Cape Town, with his second wife Vera Joanna Nettlefold (a soprano professionally known as Vera de Villiers), and died there in 1953. The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; says of him &quot;Although he was important to the fortunes of the London Symphony Orchestra immediately after the First World War, his contribution to British musical life was ephemeral. As a composer he has lost his place in the repertory, and as an executant he is remembered generally by collectors with an interest in historic recordings.&quot;

==Compositions==
In its obituary of Coates, &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that his compositions &quot;fell between the two stools of national character and international sympathy, with a resulting ambiguity of achievement.&quot; The &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; describes them as &quot;technically proficient rather than imaginative&quot;. His works include the operas &quot;Samuel Pepys&quot; and &quot;Pickwick&quot;; the former was given in German in Munich in 1929, and the latter in English at Covent Garden in 1936. His five other operas included &quot;The Myth Beautiful&quot; (1920). His concert works included a piano concerto and a symphonic poem &quot;The Eagle&quot;, dedicated to the memory of his former teacher Nikisch, which was performed in Leeds in 1925. At a memorial concert held at the Wigmore Hall on 1 July 1959 the Piano Concerto was performed by the Anglo-French pianist Frank Laffitte with a section of the London Symphony Orchestra. &quot;The Guardian&quot; critic described it as &quot;an endless patchwork of remnants from all the music that Coates ever conducted.&quot;

==Recordings==
Coates made early contributions to the representation of orchestral music on record, beginning in 1920 with Scriabin&#x27;s &quot;The Poem of Ecstasy&quot; and afterwards conducting many excerpts from Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; and (in 1923 and 1926) two complete recordings of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony. He conducted the 1929 first recording of Bach&#x27;s Mass in B minor, BWV 232, and the 1930 premiere recording of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 3 in D minor, with Vladimir Horowitz as soloist.

==Personal life==
Albert Coates was married twice. In 1910 he married Ella Holland, with whom he had one daughter, Tamara Sydonie Coates, who became a professional oboist. Coates&#x27; grandchildren include violinist Elizabeth Wallfisch and doublebass player Paul Miller. His great-grandchildren include composer Benjamin Wallfisch, cellist and baritone Simon Wallfisch and singer-songwriter Joanna Wallfisch. Later in life, Coates married South African mezzo soprano Vera de Villiers, née 
Johanna Veronique Waterston Graaf. He also had an affair with Angel Records founder Dorle Soria, uncovered after Soria&#x27;s death.

<text>The North American Labour Party was a Canadian political party that nominated candidates in federal elections in the 1970s. However, because it was not a registered political party under the rules of Elections Canada, its candidates were considered to be independents.

The NALP was the Canadian affiliate of the Lyndon LaRouche movement, and later became the Party for the Commonwealth of Canada/Party for the Commonwealth-Republic.

The North American Labour Party nominated candidates in two provincial elections in British Columbia. In the 11 December 1975 election, the party&#x27;s four candidates collected 141 votes, less than 0.01% of the popular vote. In the 26 April 1979 elections, its four candidates collected 297 votes, 0.02% of the popular vote.

The party also ran candidates in the 1975 and 1977 provincial elections in the province of Ontario. The party was not registered in 1977, and its six candidates appeared on the ballot as independents. NALP candidates also ran in Toronto and Montreal municipal elections of 1978.

The NALP did not have an official leader in Ontario during the 1977 election, although Joe Brewda appears to have been the party&#x27;s spokesman. In an interview with the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, published on June 6, 1977, Brewda argued that his party was rooted in socialism but encompassed other viewpoints as well. He is quoted as saying, &quot;our program is based on economic growth and represents the vital interests of conservative industrialists, workers and some scientific layers&quot;. He also argued in support of a gold-backed monetary system, and alleged that his party would have received 15% of the vote in the previous election had it not been for massive voter fraud.

An article from &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; of January 2, 1980 lists Richard Sanders as the main Toronto organizer of the NALP, and accuses the party of anti-Semitism. Sanders is cited in this article as alleging massive voter fraud against his party.

During the 1978 mayoral contest, Sanders was quoted as making the following statements: &quot;The trouble with Toronto, is its porno press, the &quot;Sun&quot;, &quot;Star&quot; and &quot;Globe and Mail&quot;! I&#x27;m the one to stop banks running drugs into Canada from the Cayman Islands. Smith, O&#x27;Donohue and Sewell are puffballs!&quot; (&quot;Globe and Mail&quot;, 1 November 1978)

<doc id="563258" wikidata="Q17164408" url="?curid=563258" title="Neuroeffector junction">
<text>A neuroeffector junction is a site where a motor neuron releases a neurotransmitter to affect a target—non-neuronal—cell. This junction functions like a synapse. However, unlike most neurons, somatic efferent motor neurons innervate skeletal muscle, and are always excitatory. Visceral efferent neurons innervate smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and glands, and have the ability to be either excitatory or inhibitory in function. Neuroeffector junctions are known as neuromuscular junctions when the target cell is a muscle fiber.

Non-synaptic transmission is characteristic of autonomic neuroeffector junctions. The structure of the autonomic neuromuscular junction consists of several essential features including that: the terminal portions of autonomic nerve fibers are varicose and mobile, transmitters being released &#x27;en passage&#x27; from varying distances from the effector cells; while there is no structural post-junctional specialization on effector cells, receptors for neurotransmitters accumulate on cell membranes at close junctions. Muscle effectors are bundles rather than single smooth muscle cells that are connected by gap junctions which allow electrotonic spread of activity between cells. A multiplicity of transmitters are utilized by autonomic nerves, and co-transmission occurs often involving synergistic actions of the co-transmitters, although pre- and post-junctional neuromodulation of neurotransmitter release also take place. It is suggested that autonomic neural control of immune, epithelial and endothelial cells also involves non-synaptic transmission.

These are tight junctions, but in the autonomic nervous system and enteric nervous system the connecting junctions become much &quot;looser&quot;, allowing for easier diffusion. This looseness allows for a wider signal receiving whereas in tighter junctions, more neurotransmitters get metabolized or broken down. In skeletal muscles, the junctions are mostly of the same distance and size because they innervate such definite structures of muscle fibers. In the Autonomic Nervous System however, these neuromuscular junctions are much less well defined.

Analysis of non-noradrenergic/non-cholinergic (NANC) transmission at single varicosities or swellings indicates that individual synapses possess different probabilities for the secretion of transmitter as well as different complements of autoreceptors and mixtures of post-junctional receptor subunits. There is then a local determination of the quantitative properties of single synapses.

Nerve terminals are the terminal part of the axon filled with neurotransmitters and are the location from which neurotransmitters are released. Nerve terminals may take different forms in different tissues. Nerve terminals appear like a button in the CNS, end plates in striated muscle and varicosities in many tissues including the gut. Buttons, endplates or varicosities all function to store and release neurotransmitters. In many peripheral tissues, the varicose axon branches in its proximal course and carries a covering of Schwann sheath, which is interrupted and finally lost in its most terminal part. The unmyelinated, preterminal axons with very long varicose branches are present in small axon bundles and varicose terminal axons are present as single isolated axons. The small axon bundles run parallel to and between muscle bundles and the &quot;en passage&quot; varicose axons are the main sources of innervations to the gut smooth muscle bundles. 
Nonsynaptic post-junctional receptors are mostly G-protein coupled metabotropic receptors that produce a slower response. They include metabotropic receptors for the classical neurotransmitters, monoamines, norepinephrine, purines and peptide transmitters. Post-junctional receptors also include some ionotropic receptors such as nicotinic receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) as well as the autonomic nervous system (ANS).

Nonsynaptic junctional transmission is the only mode of transmission involving the varicosities that show no synaptic contacts that includes almost all nerve terminals whose target is not a neuron. Most smooth muscles exhibit both fast and slow junction potentials typically mediated by different classes of metabotropic receptors with different kinetics.

The close junctional neurotransmission is characterized by synapse like close contact between the pre-junctional release site and the post-junctional receptors. However, unlike the synapse, the junctional space is open to the extravascular space; the pre-junctional release site lacks the distinguishing features of the presynaptic active zone and release of the soluble transmitters; and the post junctional receptors include metabotropic receptors or slower acting ionotropic receptors.

Almost all tissues that exhibit close junctional neurotransmission also show wide junctional neurotransmission. Thus, wide junctional transmission has been described in many smooth muscles such as vas deferens, urinary bladder, blood vessels, gut as well as the nervous systems including ENS, autonomic ganglia and the CNS.

Control of gastrointestinal (GI) movements by enteric motoneurons is critical for orderly processing of food, absorption of nutrients and elimination of wastes. Neuroeffector junctions in the tunica muscularis might consist of synaptic-like connectivity with specialized cells, and contributions from multiple cell types in integrated post-junctional responses. Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) – non-muscular cells of mesenchymal origin—were proposed as potential mediators in motor neurotransmission. Neuromuscular junctions in GI smooth muscles may reflect innervation of, and post-junctional responses in, all three classes of post-junctional cells. Transduction of neurotransmitter signals by ICC cells and activation of ionic conductances would be conducted electronically via gap junctions to surrounding smooth muscle cells and influence the excitability of tissues. 


== Discovery ==
In the peripheral nervous system, local junctional transmission was recognized in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Until then, all chemical neurotransmission was thought to involve synapses and the innervations of tissue were considered synonymous with the existence of a synapse. Later, it was observed that at smooth muscle neuromuscular junctions in the gut and other peripheral autonomic neuroeffector junctions, neurotransmission takes place in the absence of any synapses and it was suggested that at these sites, neurotransmission involved non-synaptic transmission. Accordingly, nerve endings release their neurotransmitters in extracellular space in a manner similar to paracrine secretion. Target cells affected by a locally released transmitter even though located several hundreds to thousands of nanometers away from the release site are considered as being innervated.

The varicose axons were first visualized for adrenergic terminals using fluorescence histochemistry described by Falck and colleagues.

These varicose axons resemble strings of beads with varicosities 0.5–2.0 μ in diameter and 1 to 3 μ in length and separated by inter-varicosity axon 0.1 to 0.2 μ in diameter. The varicosities occur at 2–10 μm intervals and it has been estimated that a single adrenergic axon may have over 25,000 varicosities on its terminal part. There are also two types of contacts. These contacts are called large and small contacts, respectively. In the large contacts, the bare varicosities and the smooth muscles were separated by ~60 nm and in the small contacts the two were separated by ~400 nm. Overall, non-synaptic junctional space between the neural release site and the post-junctional receptors may show variable degrees of separation between the release site on the pre-junctional nerve terminal and the post-junctional receptors on the target cell.

The discovery of NANC inhibitory and excitatory transmission as well as the fact that such transmission has to be considered as occurring to smooth muscle cells coupled together in an electrical Autonomic postganglionic nerves terminate in systems syncytium and that the excitatory NANC transmission of collateral branches, each of which possesses of the order gives rise to a calcium-dependent action potential.

== Research ==
Neuromuscular junctions in gastrointestinal (GI) smooth muscles may reflect innervation of, and post-junctional responses in, all three classes of post-junctional cells. Transduction of neurotransmitter signals by ICC cells and activation of ionic conductances would be conducted electronically via gap junctions to surrounding smooth muscle cells and influence excitability.

Studies do not exclude the possibility of parallel excitatory neurotransmission to ICC-DMP (deep muscular plexus) and smooth muscle cells. Different cells may utilize different receptors and signaling molecules. ICC are innervated and transmitters reach high enough concentration to activate post-junctional signaling pathways in ICC. If ICC are important intermediaries in motor neurotransmission, then loss of these cells could reduce communication between the enteric nervous system and the smooth muscle syncytium, resulting in reduced neural regulation of motility.

In pioneering studies it was shown unequivocally that the innervation of smooth muscles is by varicose nerve terminals. However, it was not until the advent of the electron microscope that we were able to provide us with a comprehensive view of the relationship between these varicose endings and smooth muscle.

Besides activation of K+ channels by NO, some authors have suggested that Ca2+-activated Cl− channels, which are active under basal conditions, can be suppressed as part of the post-junctional response to NO. These studies do not exclude the possibility of parallel excitatory neurotransmission to ICC-DMP and smooth muscle cells. Different cells may utilize different receptors and signaling molecules. These findings make the point that ICC are innervated and transmitters reach high enough concentration to activate post-junctional signaling pathways in ICC. There is no reason to assume a priori that responses to neurotransmitters released from neurons and exogenous transmitter substances are mediated by the same cells, receptors or post-junctional (transduction) signaling pathways. Neurotransmitters released from varicosities may be spatially limited to specific populations of receptors, whereas transmitters added to organ baths may bind to receptors on a variety of cells.

==Structure and function==
Non-synaptic transmission is characteristic of autonomic neuroeffector junctions. The essential features are that: the terminal portions of autonomic nerve fibers are varicose and mobile; transmitters are released from varicosities at varying distances from the effector cells; and while there is no structural post-junctional specialization on effector cells, receptors for neurotransmitters accumulate on cell membranes at close junctions. Besides smooth muscle, autonomic neural control of immune, epithelial, and endothelial cells also involves nonsynaptic transmission.
Smooth muscle effectors are bundles rather than single cells, that are connected by gap junctions which allow electrotonic spread of activity between cells. Many smooth muscle cells in a transverse section through a muscle bundle show regions of very close apposition to adjacent cells at which connexins form junctions between the cells. Unlike in cardiac muscle, where gap junctions are confined to the ends of cardiac myocytes, smooth muscle gap junctions occur along the length of the muscle cells as well as towards their ends. There are small bundles of three to seven varicose axons, partially or wholly enveloped in Schwann-cell sheath, both on the surface of the muscle as well as in the body of smooth muscle bundles. In addition, single varicose axons can be found on the surface and in the muscle bundles, and become divested of Schwann cells in the region of apposition between the varicosities and smooth muscle cells.

The active zone of individual sympathetic varicosities, delineated by a high concentration of syntaxin, occupies an area on the pre-junctional membrane of about 0.2 μm2; this gives a junctional gap between the pre-junctional active zone and post-junctional membranes that varies between about 50 and 100 nm. The post-junctional membrane beneath the varicosity can possess a patch about 1 μm2 of purinergic P2X1 receptors in high density, although this is not always the case. A nerve impulse gives rise to a transient increase in calcium concentration in every varicosity, primarily due to the opening of N-type calcium channels, as well as to a smaller increase in the intervaricose regions. The probability of secretion from a varicosity may depend on the number of secretosomes that the varicosity possesses, where a secretosome is a complex of syntaxin, synaptotagmin, an N-type calcium channel, and a synaptic vesicle.

A multiplicity of transmitters are utilized by autonomic nerves, and cotransmission occurs, often involving synergistic actions of the cotransmitters, although pre- and post-junctional neuromodulation of neurotransmitter release also take place. Cotransmission without co-storage occurs in parasympathetic nerves, where terminals staining for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter can also contain nitric oxide synthase, suggesting that they release NO as a gaseous neurotransmitter.

Neuroeffector Ca2+ transients (NCT) have been used to detect the packeted release of the neurotransmitter ATP acting on post-junctional P2X receptors to cause the Ca2+ influx. ATP released from varicosities is modulated by the concomitant release of noradrenaline that acts on the varicosities through α2-adrenoceptors to decrease the influx of calcium ions that accompanies the nerve impulse. NCT can also be used to detect the local effects of noradrenaline through its α2-adrenoceptor-mediated pre-junctional autoinhibitory effects on nerve terminal Ca2+ concentration and the probability of exocytosis (measured by counting NCTs). There is evidence that exocytosis from sympathetic varicosities depends on their history, and that the release of a packet of ATP transiently suppresses (or predicts the transient suppression of) subsequent release. The poverty of NCTs occurring within 5s of one another indicates that exocytosis from a varicosity transiently suppresses the probability of release from that varicosity. This could arise by autoinhibition (by the pre-junctional action of noradrenaline or purines) or due to a transient shortage of vesicles readily available for release.

ATP release (hence noradrenaline release, if there is strict corelease) is highly intermittent at these junctions (Brain et al. 2002), with a probability that a given action potential will evoke the release from a given varicosity of only 0.019. If there are n varicosities within the diffusion range of a particular varicosity, we can consider the number of such varicosities that might need to be present in order that, on average (using P =0.5 to give the median value), neurotransmitter will be released locally. During a five-impulse train, assuming that the last impulse in the train cannot autoinhibit the Ca2+ influx during the train, the expectation value of n can be found by solving [(1 − 0.019)4n] =(1 − 0.5), i.e. the probability that there will be no local release, given n varicosities within the diffusion range. This is n = [ln(0.5)/ln(0.981)]/4, or n≈9. If the density of varicosities is around 2.2 per 1000 μm3, this number of varicosities should occur within an average range (radius) of about 10 μm (noting that within such a radius there is a tissue volume of about 4200 μm3). Therefore, even in the presence of highly intermittent noradrenaline release, one would expect the average varicosity in this organ to be within 10 μm of a released packet of noradrenaline at some time during a five-impulse stimulus train (excluding the last impulse).

Junctional transmission is measured in seconds to minutes. The time course of the junctional potential has been divided into two most frequently observed time courses representing &#x27;close&#x27; and &#x27;wide&#x27; junctional transmissions. The &quot;close&quot; junctional transmission is associated with fast junction potential and the &quot;wide&quot; junctional transmission is associated with slow junction potential. The slow electrical potentials reach a peak in about 150 ms and then decline with a time constant between 250 and 500 ms. These responses typically last several seconds to minutes and may be depolarizing and excitatory, or hyperpolarizing and inhibitory, and have been called slow EJP or slow IJP, respectively.

== Interstitial cells of Cajal ==
Over the past 20 years, many studies have given evidence that Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC): (i) serve as pacemaker cells with unique ionic currents that generate electrical slow waves in GI muscles; (ii) provide a pathway for active slow wave propagation in GI organs; (iii) express receptors, transduction mechanisms and ionic conductances allowing them to mediate post-junctional responses to enteric motor neurotransmission; (iv) regulate smooth muscle excitability by contributing to resting potential and affecting syncytial conductance; and (v) manifest stretch-receptor functions regulating excitability and regulating slow wave frequency.

If this channel is open, conductance changes in cell are reflected in smooth muscle; post-junctional integrated responses are triggered by neuroeffector junctions and interstitial cells.

Based on anatomic location and function, two main types of ICC have been described: myenteric ICC (ICC-MY) and intramuscular ICC (ICC-IM). ICC-MY are present around the myenteric plexus and thought to be pacemaker cells for slow waves in the smooth muscle cells. Calcium imaging studies in the colon have shown that ICC-MY is innervated by nitrergic and cholinergic nerve terminals, though the nature of the contacts has not been well defined. ICC-IM is located in between the smooth muscle cells. Enteric nerves have been reported to make synaptic contacts with ICC-IM. These contacts include areas of electron dense lining on the inner aspect of the varicosity membrane without any postsynaptic density on the membrane of ICC. Such contacts were not reported between the nerves and the smooth muscles. If ICC are important intermediaries in motor neurotransmission, then loss of these cells could reduce communication between the enteric nervous system and the smooth muscle syncytium, resulting in reduced neural regulation of motility.

Classical excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters are concentrated and released from neurovesicles located in enteric nerve terminals or varicose regions of motor nerves, whereas nitric oxide is probably synthesized de novo as calcium concentration increases in nerve terminals upon membrane depolarization. Enteric nerve terminals make intimate synapses with ICC-IM, which are situated between the nerve terminals and neighbouring smooth muscle cells. ICC-IM play a critical role in the reception and transduction of cholinergic excitatory and nitrergic inhibitory neurotransmission. ICC-IM form gap junctions with smooth muscle cells and post-junctional electrical responses generated in ICC are conducted to the smooth muscle syncytium. By this contact, ICC can regulate the neuromuscular responses observed throughout the GI tract. Recent morphological evidence using anterograde tracing methods, has shown close apposition between vagal and spinal afferents and ICC-IM within the stomach wall (Fig. 5) and their absence in mutant animals that lack ICC-IM also supports a role for ICC-IM as possible integrators for in-series stretch-dependent changes in this organ.

<doc id="563260" wikidata="Q5109494" url="?curid=563260" title="Christian Democrat Party of Canada">
<text>The Christian Democrat Party of Canada was a Canadian political party that organized briefly in 1981-82, in an attempt to start a right-wing populist party.

The Christian Democrat Party was founded by Sydney Thompson, of Dunnville, Ontario. Thompson served in Korea with the Royal Canadian Navy, and managed the Hotel Plaza II in Toronto.

In a 1982 by-election in Toronto&#x27;s Broadview—Greenwood riding, Thompson, running as an independent, won 38 votes, or 0.14% of the total. He placed eighth in a field of nine candidates, following three other independents and the Rhinoceros Party of Canada candidate, but placing ahead of perennial candidate John Turmel, who collected 19 votes.

==Party program==
The party&#x27;s political platform proposed to:
* Support and encourage law enforcement agencies. Restore capital punishment.
* Increase the National Defence budget. Require compulsory service for young people. Re-divide the Canadian Armed Forces into the Royal Canadian Army, Navy and Air Force.
* Strengthen the economy by implementing political stability. Reduce the federal deficit. Restore full value of the Canadian dollar. Remove employable people from welfare roles by offering them productive jobs.
* Increase immigration with the ultimate goal of increasing population from 25 million to 200 million people. Encourage assimilation of immigrants and end multiculturalism policy.
* Pass legislation to bring inflation under control.
* Discover new energy resources; transport prisoners to northern areas to exploit energy resources.
* Adopt a &quot;Canada first&quot; foreign policy. Halt foreign aid to communist countries and other dictatorships.
* Abolish bilingualism policy.
* Deport to the country of their choice any person advocating the separation of Quebec or another province from Canada.
* Reduce taxes in general, and aim to eliminate the personal income tax over time.
* Review performance of boards of education and pass legislation where warranted to improve education. (Note: in Canada, education is a responsibility of provincial governments.)
* Abolish the metric system, and return to the Imperial system of weights and measures.
* Repeal law permitting homosexual acts.
* Prohibit abortion other than in cases of rape and incest. Create and staff adoption centres.
* Pass laws to oppose the use of narcotics and marijuana.
* Appoint cabinet ministers who have experience in the areas for which they are responsible.

<doc id="563265" wikidata="Q12249012" url="?curid=563265" title="Pecatonica River">
<text>The Pecatonica River is a tributary of the Rock River, long, in southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois in the United States.

The word Pecatonica is an anglicization of two Algonquian language words: &quot;Bekaa&quot; (or &quot;Pekaa&quot; in some dialects), which means &quot;slow&quot;, and &quot;niba&quot;, which means &quot;water&quot;, forming the conjunction &quot;Bekaaniba&quot; or &quot;Slow Water&quot;.

It rises in the hills of southwest Wisconsin, in southwest Iowa County, west of Cobb. It flows south, then southeast, past Calamine and Darlington. In southeast Lafayette County it receives the East Branch Pecatonica River, approximately north of the state line. It flows south-southeast into Illinois, past Freeport, where it turns east, then east-northeast, receiving the Sugar River near Shirland in northern Winnebago County, south of the state line. It joins the Rock at Rockton, approximately north of Rockford.

==Illinois parks and preserves==
The Winnebago County Forest Preserve District owns and operates six preserve along the river in Winnebago County. The river is the chief attraction of the Pecatonica Wetlands Forest Preserve and the Crooked River Forest Preserve off U.S. Highway 20 near Pecatonica, Illinois. These forest preserves contain oxbow, wetlands, and bottomland forest. The river also flows past the Pecatonica River Forest Preserve off Illinois Route 70 near Pecatonica. The forest preserve contains a bottomland forest and has been designated an Illinois Nature Preserve. The Trask Bridge Forest Preserve and the Two Rivers Forest Preserve at the confluence of the Sugar River and Pecatonica River provide public boat launches, picnic areas, and fishing opportunities. At the mouth of the Pecatonica is the Macktown Forest Preserve on Illinois Route 75 near Rockton, the site of the ghost town of Macktown or Pe-Katonic.

The Natural Land Institute of Rockford, Illinois owns and operates two privately owned preserves in Winnebago County. The Pecatonica Woodlands Preserve contains bottomland forest, oxbow pond, wetland, and sedge meadow habitats. The Nygren Wetland Preserve, located at the confluence of the Pecatonica River and the Rock River, has been restored from farmland to prairie, oak savanna, wetland, and oxbow pond.

==Wisconsin parks and preserves==
The river is the focus of the Pecatonica River Woods State Natural Area near Mineral Point in Iowa County, owned by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and designated as a natural area in 1992. The Pecatonica River Woods SNA was listed on the basis of possessing a diverse range of forest ecosystems, from southern dry, through mesic, to floodplain. The Weir White Oaks State Natural Area, a privately owned preserve managed by the Wisconsin DNR, contains high-quality old growth upland forest and was designated a state natural area in 2002.

The Blackhawk Memorial Park is owned and operated by Lafayette County.

== Flooding ==
The Pecatonica River has flooded seven times since May 2017. Flood cleanup cost the city of Freeport, Illinois more than $1.5 million. The March 2019 flood crest of 22.4 feet at Martintown, Wisconsin set a new record. The Pecatonica River flooded again in October 2019, along with other Chicago area rivers including the Fox River and the Rock River.

A USGS monitoring station is located at Freeport.

<doc id="563269" wikidata="Q431524" url="?curid=563269" title="The Power and the Glory">
<text>The Power and the Glory is a 1940 novel by British author Graham Greene. The title is an allusion to the doxology often recited at the end of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer: &quot;For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, forever and ever, amen.&quot; It was initially published in the United States under the title The Labyrinthine Ways.

Greene&#x27;s novel tells the story of a renegade Catholic &#x27;whisky priest&#x27; (a term coined by Greene) living in the Mexican state of Tabasco in the 1930s, a time when the Mexican government was attempting to suppress the Catholic Church. That suppression had resulted in the Cristero War (1926–1929), so named for its Catholic combatants&#x27; slogan &quot;&quot;Viva Cristo Rey&quot; (&quot;Long live Christ the King&quot;).

In 1941, the novel received the Hawthornden Prize, a British literary award. In 2005, it was chosen by &quot;TIME&quot; magazine as one of the hundred best English-language novels since 1923.

==Plot==
During the period when Catholicism was outlawed in Mexico, the state of Tabasco enforces the ban rigorously, while many other states follow a don&#x27;t-ask-don&#x27;t-tell policy. But in Radical Socialist Tabasco, priests have been settled by the state with wives (breaking celibacy) and pensions in exchange for their renouncing the faith and being strictly banned from fulfilling pastoral functions. Those who refuse are on the run and liable to be shot.

A scene-setting introduction to some of the characters, who are enduring a barely satisfactory existence in the provincial capital, now gives way to the story of the novel&#x27;s protagonist: a fugitive priest returned after years to the small country town that was formerly his parish. The narrative then follows him on his journey through the state, where he tries to minister to the marginalised people as best he can. In doing so, he is faced by many problems, not least of which is that Tabasco is also prohibitionist, with the unspoken prime objective to hinder celebration of the Sacrifice of the Mass, for which actual wine is an essential. Otherwise it is fairly easy to obtain beer or hard liquor, despite their being forbidden.

The unnamed &quot;traitor to the state&quot; is a &#x27;whisky priest&#x27; who, among his other personal failings, had fathered a child in his parish some years before. Now he meets his daughter during a brief stay, but is unable to feel repentance. Rather, he feels a deep love for the evil-looking and awkward little girl and decides to do everything in his power to save her from damnation. His chief antagonist is the police lieutenant, who is morally irreproachable but unbending in outlook. While he is supposedly &quot;living for the people&quot;, he puts into practice a plan of taking hostages from villages and shooting them if he discovers the priest has sojourned there without being denounced. On account of bad experiences with the church in his youth, there is a personal element in his pursuit.

For his part, the priest has remained on the run in order to serve the religious needs of the poverty-stricken agriculturists he meets, despite his deep sense of unworthiness. In order to save them from harm at the hands of the vengeful lieutenant, he now feels compelled to cross the mountainous border to the less stringent, neighbouring state. During this time, he twice encounters the lieutenant - once during a round-up in his village and then after he is imprisoned as a drunk – but is not recognised and allowed to go on his way. Near death after a perilous journey, he is rescued by the workers of the Lehrs, Protestant land-owners from the US, who nurse the priest back to health and help him make plans to reach the local capital.

As he sets out, the priest meets again a mestizo whom he has earlier learned to mistrust and who eventually reveals himself to be a Judas figure. The mestizo persuades the priest to return to hear the confession of a dying man just over the border, an American gunman who is the lieutenant&#x27;s second target. Though suspecting that it is a trap, the priest feels compelled to fulfil his sacramental duty. Urged by the dying man to escape and save himself, the priest falls into the hands of the waiting lieutenant nevertheless. Though the lieutenant admits that he has nothing against the priest as a man, and rather admires him, the lieutenant persists that he must be shot &quot;as a danger&quot;. On the eve of the execution, the lieutenant shows mercy and attempts to enlist the renegade Padre José to hear the condemned man&#x27;s confession (which &quot;in extremis&quot; the Church would allow), but the effort is thwarted by Padre José&#x27;s domineering wife.

The lieutenant is now convinced that he has &quot;cleared the province of priests&quot;, but in the final chapter another covert priest arrives in the capital. A faithful Catholic woman, who has previously figured as reading pious tracts about the lives of native saints to her children, has added the protagonist to her repertoire of Christian martyrs and now agrees to harbour this new arrival.

==Secondary characters==
* Maria: The mother of Brigitta, the priest&#x27;s daughter.
* Brigitta: Maria&#x27;s illegitimate daughter.
* Padre José: A despised priest who obeyed the government&#x27;s instructions and took a wife.
* Mr. Tench: A dissatisfied English dentist who cannot return home because devaluation of the peso affects his savings.
* Captain Fellows: The English owner of a banana plantation in whose barn the priest takes refuge.
* Mrs. Fellows: The valetudinarian wife of Captain Fellows.
* Coral Fellows: The thirteen-year-old daughter of Captain and Mrs. Fellows.
* The Chief of Police: The lieutenant&#x27;s inefficient superior, mostly concerned with playing billiards and assuaging his toothache.

==Composition==
Greene visited Mexico from January to May 1938 to research and write a nonfiction account of the persecution of the Catholic Church in Mexico, that he had been planning since 1936. The persecution of the Catholic Church was especially severe in the province of Tabasco, under anti-clerical governor Tomás Garrido Canabal. His campaign succeeded in closing all the churches in the state. It forced the priests to marry and give up their soutanes. Greene called it the &quot;fiercest persecution of religion anywhere since the reign of Elizabeth.&quot; He chronicled his travels in Tabasco in &quot;The Lawless Roads&quot;, published in 1939. In that generally hostile account of his visit he wrote &quot;That, I think, was the day I began to hate the Mexicans&quot; and at another point described his &quot;growing depression, almost pathological hatred ... for Mexico.&quot; Pico Iyer has marveled at how Greene&#x27;s responses to what he saw could be &quot;so dyspeptic, so loveless, so savagely self-enclosed and blind&quot; in his nonfiction treatment of his journey, though, as another critic has noted, &quot;nowhere in &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; is there any indication of the testiness and revulsion&quot; in Greene&#x27;s nonfiction report. Many details reported in Greene&#x27;s nonfiction treatment of his Tabasco trip appeared in the novel, from the sound of a revolver in the police chief&#x27;s holster to the vultures in the sky. The principal characters of &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; all have antecedents in &quot;The Lawless Roads&quot;, mostly as people Greene encountered directly or, in the most important instance, a legendary character that people told him about, a certain &quot;whisky priest&quot;, a fugitive who, as Greene writes in &quot;The Lawless Roads&quot;, &quot;existed for ten years in the forest and swamps, venturing out only at night&quot;.

Another of Greene&#x27;s inspirations for his main character was the Jesuit priest Miguel Pro, who performed his priestly functions as an underground priest in Tabasco and was executed without trial in 1927 on false charges.

In 1983, Greene said that he first started to become a Christian in Tabasco, where the fidelity of the peasants &quot;assumed such proportions that I couldn&#x27;t help being profoundly moved.&quot;

Despite having visited Mexico and published an account of his travels, in the novel Greene was not meticulous about Tabasco&#x27;s geography. In &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot;, he identified the region&#x27;s northern border as another Mexican state and its southern border as the sea, when Tabasco&#x27;s northern border is actually the Bay of Campeche and its southern border is Chiapas.

==Adaptations==
In 1947, the novel was freely adapted into a film, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, directed by John Ford and starring Henry Fonda as the priest. It was faithfully dramatized by Denis Cannan for performance at the Phoenix Theatre in London in 1956, the whisky priest acted by Paul Scofield, and in 1958 at the Phoenix Theatre in New York City. The dramatization was &quot;The Play of the Week&quot; on US television in 1959, with James Donald as the priest. A highly acclaimed 1961 US television version, released theatrically overseas, featured Laurence Olivier in the role.

==Criticism==
&quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; was somewhat controversial and, in 1953, Cardinal Bernard Griffin of Westminster summoned Greene and read him a pastoral letter condemning the novel. According to Greene:The Archbishop of Westminster read me a letter from the Holy Office condemning my novel because it was &quot;paradoxical&quot; and &quot;dealt with extraordinary circumstances.&quot; The price of liberty, even within a Church, is eternal vigilance, but I wonder whether any of the totalitarian states ... would have treated me as gently when I refused to revise the book on the casuistical ground that the copyright was in the hands of my publishers. There was no public condemnation, and the affair was allowed to drop into that peaceful oblivion which the Church wisely reserves for unimportant issues.

Evelyn Waugh in Greene&#x27;s defence wrote, &quot;It was as fatuous as unjust – a vile misreading of a noble book.&quot; Greene said that when he met Pope Paul VI in 1965, he assured Greene, &quot;some aspects of your books are certain to offend some Catholics, but you should pay no attention to that.&quot; Many novelists consider the novel to be Greene&#x27;s masterpiece, as John Updike claimed in his introduction to the 1990 reprint of the novel. On its publication, William Golding claimed Greene had &quot;captured the conscience of the twentieth century man like no other.&quot;

<text>The University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD) is a public university in Duluth, Minnesota, United States. It is part of the University of Minnesota system. UMD offers 17 bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 87 majors, graduate programs in 24 different fields, a two-year program at the School of Medicine, and a four-year College of Pharmacy program.

==History==

===Early history and plans for Duluth Normal School===

Although the University of Minnesota Duluth did not officially make its appearance until 1947, plans for a college in the Duluth area were first made in the 1890s. The state legislature planned for a teaching school for women (then referred to as a normal school) and in 1895 they passed a bill authorizing the &quot;State Normal School at Duluth&quot;.

In 1896, the City of Duluth donated of land to serve as a foundation for the school, and the state legislature provided additional funds for the construction costs for the main building in 1899, which was built in 1900.

In February 1901, a fire caused extensive damage to the school and the following year, the school was rebuilt.

===Opening of Duluth State Teachers College===

In April 1901, Eugene W. Bohannon was appointed president of the Duluth Normal School. In 1902 the school first opened for enrollment. The first students, all women, came to the school to be trained for a degree in education. By 1903, the first seven women received their diplomas from the State Normal School at Duluth. The institution changed names to the Duluth State Normal School or Duluth Normal School in 1905. In 1906, the first dormitories were opened, costing the school around $35,000 to build. Room and board were offered at cost, between fourteen and fifteen dollars a month. Throughout the next few years, more dormitories, two new wings, and an auditorium were added to the school. Requirements, such as having a high school diploma, were instituted. Students who signed a pledge to teach after graduation attended for free; others were required to pay $30 per year.

The 1906 &quot;Bulletin of the State Normal School&quot; describes the school at that time:

The building is thoroughly modern in construction and equipment. It is located in one of the most attractive parts of the city, overlooking the waters of Lake Superior from a height of more than three hundred feet. The laboratories are large and well arranged. The furniture and apparatus are new and excellent in every way. The present equipment of the several laboratories represents an expenditure of not less than $7,500, and is entirely adequate for the needs of the school. A large and well-lighted room has been equipped for manual training. It is supplied with twenty benches of the most approved make and all of the necessary tools and instruments.

Enrollment for 1903 was 127 and by 1906 it had increased to 202. A Model School with kindergarten through grade eight was maintained for &quot;practice teaching&quot;. The 1906 bulletin reports, &quot;At the opening of the school four years ago it was somewhat doubtful whether the number of children to attend would be sufficient to constitute a model school in any proper sense. Only three teachers were needed to take charge of the pupils at that time, while five are required now and the number of children seeking admission is greatly in excess of the limit fixed for the several grades.

Since many of the normal school graduates would be the sole instructor in rural areas with one-room schools for children through the eighth grade, they needed a well-rounded education. The 1906 Bulletin lists the subjects the students were expected to complete in the two-year course: 
School Bionomy, Social Science , Psychology and Pedagogy, History and Civics, Physics, Chemistry, Algebra, Geometry, Zoology, Biology, Geography, Domestic Science, Music, English, Latin, Drawing, Manual Training, and others. The subjects were very detailed, for example English included Reviews in Grammar, Rhetoric, Theme Writing, Literary Interpretation, English Composition, Cicero, Caesar, and other subjects. Manuel training included simple basketry with the suggestion that the baskets that the children were taught to make could be used as sewing baskets in the sewing classes of Home Economics training. Weaving was taught using simple looms that the children had been taught to make. The use of both hand and electric carpentry tools was taught with the children completing a simple wooden project. 

In 1921, the State Normal School at Duluth was renamed &quot;Duluth State Teachers College&quot; or DSTC. The change in status allowed bachelor&#x27;s degrees and four-year degree programs to be added to the school. The college published a yearbook, &quot;The Chronicle&quot;, and looking through the publication the many pages devoted to extracurricular events and student&#x27;s photos of campus life suggests that the students enjoyed many activities outside of their everyday classroom work. The 1926–1927 &quot;Chronicle&quot; features a photo of the Spring 1927 graduates. The school was celebrating its 25th year anniversary and the yearbook lists 102 graduates. The class photo is taken with the women sitting on the steps of the Main Building; at present the steps and a small portion of the facade are the only portion of the building left standing following a fire in 1993.

In 1929 the school became co-ed, and the first sports teams were instituted, including hockey, football, and basketball. By 1937, the community supported elevating DSTC to a branch campus of the University of Minnesota.

In 1985 the four surviving buildings of the State Normal School at Duluth, consisting of the Main Building, Washburn Hall, Torrance Hall, and the Model School, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The &quot;Duluth State Normal School Historic District&quot; was listed for its state-level significance in the themes of architecture and education. It was nominated as Minnesota&#x27;s most intact state normal school campus, and for the Beaux-Arts architecture of the Main Building. However a fire in 1993 reduced the Main Building to freestanding remnants.

===Founding of University of Minnesota Duluth===
As enrollment increased on the University of Minnesota campus in the Twin Cities in the 1940s, higher education leaders began to debate how to address overcrowding on the state&#x27;s land grant university campus. During this time City leaders and area state legislators formed a plan to advocate for establishing a branch campus of the University of Minnesota in the City of Duluth. After significant lobbying efforts a bill was drafted and submitted to the legislature that would instead take the Duluth State Teachers College, remove it from the Minnesota State Teachers College system and establish a branch of the University of Minnesota in 1947. The Legislature narrowly passed the bill and the marriage of the University of Minnesota to Duluth State Teachers College began. It is at this time that the University of Minnesota Duluth was established.

These events were significant statewide as the Duluth State Teachers College was given preference above all of the other state teachers college in 6 other regions of the state to be upgraded to &quot;university&quot; status. These events later led to discord, with Southern Minnesota organizing to request its own university in 1963-1967 as part of efforts to make Mankato State Teachers College into a research university called the University of Southern Minnesota or Minnesota State University. It wouldn&#x27;t be until 1975-1976 that the others would be allowed to develop comprehensive curriculum and expand as full universities. During these initial years the University of Minnesota Duluth was considered directly a part of the University of Minnesota, not an independent institution.

===Modern history===
The University of Minnesota Duluth has established itself in a number of research areas including ocean, sea and freshwater sciences. It is the primary sea-grant university for the state of Minnesota and operates the Minnesota Sea Grant Program offices on campus. In addition, in 1972 a two-year school of medicine was founded at the university to provide the first two years of medical education in a small urban and rural setting. The medical school was reorganized in 2000 to be a direct component of the University of Minnesota Medical School from the Twin Cities campus and now operates semi-independently from the University of Minnesota Duluth.

Today, the university now educates around 9,500 students each year.

==Campus==
The UMD campus consists of more than 50 buildings on overlooking Lake Superior. Most UMD buildings are connected by concourses or hallways. UMD is also home to the Tweed Museum of Art, the Marshall W. Alworth Planetarium, Weber Music Hall, and the Marshall Performing Arts Center. Other UMD facilities include Glensheen Historic Estate, Chester Park School which houses Minnesota Sea Grant and the Speech-Language-Hearing Clinic, the Natural Resources Research Institute, the Research and Field Studies Center, and the Lower Campus which houses the Large Lakes Observatory.

UMD has substantially expanded its facilities beginning in 2000 with the completion of the Kathryn A. Martin library. Additional recent buildings include the Weber Music Hall (2002), Kirby Plaza (2004), James I. Swenson Science Building (2005), Sports and Health Center addition (2006), Life Science Renovation (2006), Labovitz School of Business &amp; Economics (2008), Bagley Environmental Classroom (2009), the Civil Engineering Building (2010), and the Heikkila Chemistry and Advanced Materials Science (HCAMS) building (2019).

New art on campus came along with the construction of the new buildings. All new public building projects in Minnesota must comply with the state&#x27;s “One Percent for Art” law, passed by the State Legislature in 1984, which mandates that all such projects in Minnesota costing over $500,000 must devote at least 1% of their total construction budget towards incorporating public art into these building&#x27;s public spaces. A little over 1% of the library&#x27;s $28 million construction costs went toward the purchase and installation of a glass sculpture by Dale Chihuly that hangs from the ceiling of the two-story library lobby. An outdoor sculpture adjacent to the Swenson Science Building makes reference to elements of Duluth&#x27;s surrounding Native American Ojibwe culture. The sculpture, &quot;Wild Ricing Moon,&quot; was designed by John David Mooney and represents the traditional wild rice harvest.
The colleges and schools at the University of Minnesota Duluth are:
* College of Education &amp; Human Service Professions
* College of Arts, Humanities, &amp; Social Sciences
* Labovitz School of Business and Economics
* Swenson College of Science and Engineering
* Graduate School
* Medical School
* College of Pharmacy

===Buildings===

====Heikkila Chemistry and Advanced Materials Science Building====

The three-story, 56,000 sq. ft. Heikkila Chemistry and Advanced Materials Science (HCAMS) building opened in 2019. It is named for benefactors Kurt and Beth Heikkila. The HCAMS building is the home of the Advanced Materials Center.

====James I Swenson Civil Engineering Building====

Completed in 2010, the 35,300 square foot, $12,100,000 building was designed by Ross Barney Architects of Chicago, Illinois. The new building for the Civil Engineering program is designed to teach students about materials, how they go together, how they age, and how they express the forces inherent in any structure. The exterior expresses the traits of a place where students design, construct, and test structures to withstand stresses and strains. The facade is distinguished by cor-ten steel, precast and poured in place concrete, concrete block, and scuppers clad in reclaimed wood. On a rainy day, the building is a demonstration of hydraulics and kinetic energy, as water pours from the scuppers and splashes into the cor-ten steel catch basins. The design has received many accolades, including the 2013 American Institute of Architects Cote Top Ten Green Project Award.

The jury stated &quot;This is an example of wedding together buildings that perform well but also are aesthetically rich, and culturally useful, beneficial, and beautiful in their own way. The project has a very honest expression of the materials—it&#x27;s very clear what this building is made of. It&#x27;s creative in its architectural expression in a way that&#x27;s sculptural and sort of bold and solid like the sciences that are studied within. Seventy-seven percent energy reduction below the baseline in Duluth’s severe climate also is impressive.&quot;

====Marshall Performing Arts Center====

Marshall Performing Arts Center was built in the 1970s and is a 715-seat flexible thrust/proscenium theatre presenting an array of theatre and dance events. It was named after the parents of Julia and Caroline Marshall and Jessica Marshall Spencer (Albert and Julia N. Marshall) who were donors to the university. The Dudley Experimental Theatre (a black-box theatre within MPAC) was named for another donor, Marjorie Congdon Dudley.

====Marshall W. Alworth Planetarium====

The construction of the Marshall W. Alworth Planetarium was supported by Marshall W. Alworth. Alworth grew up in Duluth and attended Duluth Central High School and later Dartmouth College. He also donated funds towards scholarships which today are valued at over $35 million.

The Marshall W. Alworth Planetarium has a dome, which seats 65. Astronomical programs are delivered with an optomechanical Spitz A3P star machine, a full-dome digital projection system running UniView® software, surround sound, and programmable LRGB LED lighting. The planetarium is home to the Darling telescope, a 9-inch refracting telescope that belonged to John H. Darling.

====Swenson Science Building====

Completed in 2006, the building is situated on the main corridor into the 244 acre campus and contains 108,000 gross square feet of inter disciplinary research and teaching laboratories for Chemistry, Fresh Water Ecology and Biology and creates a link between the academic and residential areas of the campus. Designed by Ross Barney Architects of Chicago, Illinois, the new building provides 16 undergraduate instructional laboratories for 2100 students, 16 research laboratories for faculty and postdoctoral researchers, offices for faculty, graduate and postgraduate students, and the Biology departments administration. One unique feature is the wild rice research laboratory built into the watershed creating a front yard and an outdoor learning space.

The outdoor area of the Swenson Science Building was designed by landscape architecture firm oslund.and.assoc. with the concept of &quot;Science on Display&quot;, playing upon the idea that seeing is the ideal way to understand scientific concepts. The landscape features an experimental stormwater wetland garden, outdoor classrooms, experimental garden pool, and outdoor laboratories. The native plantings pay homage to the native peoples of Minnesota, with the water garden showcasing the cultivation of wild rice, a cultural staple of some of the Native Americans of the area. In 2007, this landscape won a 2007 ASLA General Design Honor Award.

====Tweed Museum of Art====

The Tweed Museum of Art&#x27;s history began in the 1920s when George and Alice Tweed first began collecting pieces of 19th and 20th American and European art including examples of the French Barbizon School and Impressionist influenced American Landscape painting. After the death of Mr. Tweed in 1946, Mrs. Tweed saw the potential of the Tweed collection as a resource for the community. She generously developed the funding for the present building which was dedicated in 1958.

Today the museum holds over 10,000 works of art. The collection features artists including David Ericson, Gilbert Munger, Eastman Johnson, William Hart, John Twachtman, Homer Dodge Martin, and Childe Hassam. The Hudson River Valley School collection, the Potlatch Company Royal Canadian Mounted Police painting collection, the Glenn C. Nelson pottery collection and an extensive American Indian artifacts and artworks collection are especially noteworthy. Besides the museum&#x27;s permanent collection the Tweed hosts exhibitions that feature both international and local artists.

====Weber Music Hall====

The Weber Music Hall, built in 2002 and designed by architect César Pelli, is considered the &quot;gem&quot; of UMD. The hall has state-of-the-art acoustics and can seat 350 people.

==Centers, institutes, and research labs==

==Academics==
The University of Minnesota Duluth has 17 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs with 89 majors and 76 minors and graduate programs in 24 fields.

==Athletics==

Minnesota–Duluth (UMD) athletic teams are the Bulldogs (which they have been named since 1933). Their colors are maroon and gold. The university is a member of the Division II level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference (NSIC) in all sports except ice hockey since the 2008–09 academic year; which they were a member on two previous stint from 1932–33 to 1950–51, and from 1975–76 to 2003–04. For their ice hockey programs, men&#x27;s ice hockey competes in the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC), while women&#x27;s ice hockey still competes in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA; which the men&#x27;s team previously competed in). The Bulldogs previously competed in the D-II North Central Conference (NCC) from 2004–05 to 2007–08; and in the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC) at the NCAA Division III ranks from 1951–52 to 1974–75.

Minnesota–Duluth competes in 16 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, ice hockey, and indoor and outdoor track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, ice hockey, soccer, softball, tennis, indoor and outdoor track &amp; field, and volleyball.

===Accomplishments===
In 2008, the undefeated Bulldogs won the NCAA Division II National Football Championship—the first Division II championship in any sport at the school. In 2010, the Bulldogs won their second NCAA Division II National Football Championship in a 3-year span and their second in school history beating Delta State University.

In 2011, the Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs men&#x27;s ice hockey team defeated the University of Michigan 3–2 in overtime for the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s hockey national title, their first. In 2018, after the Bulldogs were the last team to receive an at-large bid in the tournament, the Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs men&#x27;s ice hockey team defeated Notre Dame 2-1 for their second NCAA Division I men&#x27;s hockey national championship. The team won its second consecutive championship (and third overall) the following year.

The Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs women&#x27;s ice hockey team has won five NCAA Division I national titles: 2001, 2002, 2003, 2008, and 2010.

===Facilities===
UMD&#x27;s Football, Soccer and Track and Field teams compete at Griggs Field in James S. Malosky Stadium. Hockey is played off campus at Amsoil Arena in the DECC. Basketball and Volleyball teams play in Romano Gymnasium on campus. Baseball is played in Bulldog Park and softball is played in Junction Avenue Field

==Student life==
===Fraternities and sororities===
There are several fraternities and sororities that UMD students can join.
Sororities include Gamma Sigma Sigma, Beta Lambda Psi (a local sorority), Phi Sigma Sigma, and Alpha Sigma Tau. Fraternities include Phi Kappa Psi, Alpha Delta, Tau Kappa Epsilon, Phi Kappa Tau, and Alpha Nu Omega (a local fraternity, not to be confused with the national Alpha Nu Omega organization). Students must be an active member of a fraternity or sorority in good standing before serving on Greek Council. The UMD Greek system is run like a senate body where all organizations are represented by two delegates. Although the council had financial disagreements involving the membership fee which led to the departure of Alpha Phi Omega in the fall of 2009, they have since rejoined. In April 2013 Alpha Phi Omega transferred to Alpha Delta due to conflicts at a national level.

Manila Luzon, a drag queen, comedian, recording artist, and television personality, competed on the third season of RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race and the first and fourth seasons of RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race All Stars.

==Notable donations==

===Joel Labovitz===
Joel Labovitz is founder of Labovitz Enterprises, a diversified investment firm based in Duluth with a focus on the hospitality industry. Previously, Joel Labovitz was president and CEO of Maurices, the retail clothing company that was founded in 1931 in Duluth by his father, Maurice Labovitz.

===James Swenson===

James Swenson, a University of Minnesota Duluth Alumnus, donated more than $21 million to the school, with his most recent donation of $10.7 million toward the College of Science and Engineering. $3 million of this was dedicated to the new civil engineering building and the remaining $7.7 million was given as scholarships for students in science and research programs. This donation helps to continue to support the scholarship programs the Swenson family started in 1994. Since the program began, UMD has awarded scholarships to over 200 students.
Because of his generous donations over the years, the school renamed the College of Science and Engineering to be the Swenson College of Science and Engineering. &quot;It&#x27;s nice to have our names on buildings, but there&#x27;s a lot of gratification in helping these young people,&quot; said Swenson. 
The Swensons are natives of Superior, Wisconsin, and have since relocated to California. James completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemistry in 1959 at UMD. He then worked in the computer industry with his circuit shop, Details Inc., which he sold in 1997. James died in October 2018.

<doc id="563290" wikidata="Q157991" url="?curid=563290" title="Adansonia">
<text>Adansonia is a genus made up of eight species of medium-to-large deciduous trees known as baobabs ( or ) or adansonias. They are placed in the family Malvaceae, subfamily Bombacoideae. They are native to Madagascar, mainland Africa, and Australia. The trees have also been introduced to other regions such as Asia. A genomic and ecological analysis has suggested that the genus is Madagascan in origin.

The generic name honours Michel Adanson, the French naturalist and explorer who described &quot;Adansonia digitata&quot;. The baobab is also known as the &quot;upside down tree&quot;, a name that originates from its appearance and several myths. They are among the most long-lived of vascular plants and have large flowers that are reproductive for a maximum of 15 hours. The flowers open around dusk, opening so quickly that movement can be detected by the naked eye, and are faded by the next morning. The fruits are large, oval to round and berry-like and hold kidney-shaped seeds in a dry, pulpy matrix.

In the early 21st century, baobabs in southern Africa began to die off rapidly from a cause yet to be determined. It is unlikely that disease or pests would be able to kill many trees so rapidly, and some have speculated that the die-off is a result of dehydration.

==Description==

Baobabs are long-lived deciduous, small to large trees from tall with broad trunks and compact crowns. Young trees usually have slender, tapering trunks, often with a swollen base. Mature trees have massive trunks that are bottle-shaped or cylindrical and tapered from bottom to top. The trunk is made of fibrous wood arranged in concentric rings, although rings are not always formed annually and so cannot be used to determine the age of individual trees. Tree diameter fluctuates with rainfall so it is thought that water may be stored in the trunk. Baobab trees have two types of shoots—long, green vegetative ones, and stout, woody reproductive ones. Branches can be massive and spread out horizontally from the trunk or are ascending. 

&quot;Adansonia gregorii&quot; is generally the smallest of the baobabs, rarely getting to over tall and often with multiple trunks. Both &quot;A. rubrostipa&quot; and &quot;A. madagascariensis&quot; are small to large trees, from tall. The other baobabs grow from tall, with diameter trunks. &quot;A. digitata&quot;, however, often has massive single or multiple trunks of up to diameter.

===Leaves===
Leaves are palmately compound in mature trees, but seedlings and regenerating shoots may have simple leaves. The transition to compound leaves comes with age and may be gradual. Leaves have 5–11 leaflets, with the largest ones in the middle and may be stalkless or with short petioles. Leaflets may have toothed or smooth edges, and may be hairless or have simple-to-clumped hairs. Baobabs have stipules at the base of the leaves, but the stipules are soon shed in most species. Baobabs are deciduous, shedding leaves during the dry season.

===Flowers===
In most &quot;Adansonia&quot; species, the flowers are borne on short erect or spreading stalks in the axils of the leaves near the tips of reproductive shoots. Only &quot;A. digitata&quot; has flowers and fruits set on long, hanging stalks. There is usually only a single flower in an axil, but sometimes flowers occur in pairs. They are large, showy and strongly scented. They only open near dusk. Opening is rapid and movement of the flower parts is fast enough to be visible. Most &quot;Adansonia&quot; species are pollinated by bats. 

Flowers may remain attached to the trees for several days, but the reproductive phase is very short, with pollen shed during the first night and stigmas shriveled by the morning. The flower is made up of an outer 5-lobed calyx, and an inner ring of petals set around a fused tube of stamens. The outer lobes of the calyx are usually green (brown in &quot;A. grandidieri&quot;) and in bud are joined almost to the tip. As the flower opens, the calyx lobes split apart and become coiled or bent back (reflexed) at the base of the flower. The inner surface of the lobes are silky-hairy and cream, pink, or red. Sometimes the lobes do not separate cleanly, distorting the shape of the flower as they bend back. The calyx lobes remain fused at the base, leaving a feature (calyx tube) that has nectar-producing tissue and that is cup-shaped, flat or tubular; the form of the calyx tube varies with species. The flowers have a central tube (staminal tube) made up of fused stalks of stamens (filaments), with unfused filaments above. A densely hairy ovary is enclosed in the staminal tube, and a long style tipped with a stigma emerges from the filaments. Petals are set near the base of the staminal tube and are variable in shape and colour. The flowers, when fresh, may be white, cream, bright yellow or dark red, but fade quickly, often turning reddish when dried.

===Fruit===
The fruit of the baobabs is one of their distinguishing features. It is large, oval-to-round, and berry-like in most species (usually less than long in &quot;A. madagascariensis&quot;.). It has a dry, hard outer shell of variable thickness. In most species, the shell is indehiscent (does not break open easily). &quot;A. gibbosa&quot; is the only species with fruits that crack while still on the tree, which then tend to break open upon landing on the ground. Inside the outer shell, kidney-shaped seeds 10–15(−20) mm long are set in a dry pulp.

==Taxonomy==
The earliest written reports of baobab are from a 14th-century travelogue by the Arab traveler Ibn Battuta. The first botanical description was in the &quot;De medicina Aegyptiorum&quot; by Prospero Alpini (1592), looking at fruits that he observed in Egypt from an unknown source. They were called &quot;Bahobab&quot;, possibly from the Arabic &quot;abū ḥibāb&quot; meaning &quot;many-seeded fruit&quot;. The French explorer and botanist Michel Adanson (1727–1806) observed a baobab tree in 1749 on the island of Sor in Senegal, and wrote the first detailed botanical description of the full tree, accompanied with illustrations. Recognizing the connection to the fruit described by Alpini he called the genus Baobab. Linnaeus later renamed the genus &quot;Adansonia&quot;, to honour Adanson, but use of baobab as one of the common names has persisted.

The genus &quot;Adansonia&quot; is in the subfamily Bombacoideae, within the family Malvaceae in the order Malvales. The subfamily Bombacoideae was previously treated as the Bombacaceae family but it is no longer recognized at the rank of family by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group I 1998, II 2003 or the Kubitzki system 2003. There are eight accepted species of &quot;Adansonia&quot;. A new species (&quot;Adansonia kilima&quot; Pettigrew, et al.), was described in 2012, found in high-elevation sites in eastern and southern Africa. This, however, is no longer recognized as a distinct species but considered a synonym of &quot;A. digitata&quot;. Some high-elevation trees in Tanzania show different genetics and morphology, but further study is needed to determine if recognition of them as a separate species is warranted. The genus &quot;Adansonia&quot; is further divided into three sections. Section Adansonia includes only &quot;A. digitata&quot;. This species has hanging flowers and fruit, set on long flowering stalks. This is the type species for the genus &quot;Adansonia&quot;. All species of &quot;Adansonia&quot; except &quot;A. digitata&quot; are diploid; &quot;A. digitata&quot; is tetraploid. Section Brevitubae includes &quot;A. grandidieri&quot; and &quot;A. suarexensis&quot;. These are species with flower buds that set on short pedicles and that are approximately twice as long as wide. The other species are all classified within the section Longitubae. They also have flowers/fruits set on short pedicels, but the flower buds are five or more times as long as wide.

==Species==

, there are eight recognized species of Adansonia, with six endemic to Madagascar, one native to mainland Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and one native to Australia. The mainland African species (&quot;Adansonia digitata&quot;) also occurs on Madagascar, but it is not a native of that island. Baobabs were introduced in ancient times to south Asia and during the colonial era to the Caribbean. They are also present in the island nation of Cape Verde. A ninth species was described in 2012 (&quot;Adansonia kilima&quot; ) but is no longer recognized as a distinct species. The African and Australian baobabs are similar in appearance, and the oldest splits within &quot;Adansonia&quot; are likely no older than 15 million years; thus, the Australian species represents a long-distance trans-oceanic dispersal event from Africa. The lineage leading to &quot;Adansonia&quot; was found to have diverged from its closest relatives in Bombacoideae like &quot;Ceiba&quot; /&quot;Chorisia&quot; at the end of the Eocene, during a time of abrupt global climate cooling and drying, while a divergence of this &quot;Adansonia&quot;+&quot;Ceiba&quot; /&quot;Chorisia&quot; clade from &quot;Pachira&quot; was found to be more ancient, dating to the middle Eocene. 

==Habitat==
The Malagasy species are important components of the Madagascar dry deciduous forests. Within that biome, &quot;Adansonia madagascariensis&quot; and &quot;A. rubrostipa&quot; occur specifically in the Anjajavy Forest, sometimes growing out of the tsingy limestone itself. &quot;A. digitata&quot; has been called &quot;a defining icon of African bushland&quot;. The tree also grows wild in Sudan in the regions of Darfur and the state of Kordofan. The locals call it &quot;Gongolaze&quot; and use its fruits as food and medicine and use the tree trunks as reservoirs to save water.

==Ecology==
Baobabs store water in the trunk (up to ) to endure harsh drought conditions. All occur in seasonally arid areas, and are deciduous, shedding their leaves during the dry season. Across Africa, the oldest and largest baobabs began to die in the early 21st century, likely from a combination of drought and rising temperatures. The trees appear to become parched, then become dehydrated and unable to support their massive trunks.

Baobabs are important as nest sites for birds, in particular the mottled spinetail and four species of weaver.

==Notable trees==

Radiocarbon dating has provided data on a few individuals of &quot;A. digitata&quot;. The Panke baobab in Zimbabwe was some 2,450 years old when it died in 2011, making it the oldest angiosperm ever documented, and two other trees—&quot;Dorslandboom&quot; in Namibia and &quot;Glencoe&quot; in South Africa—were estimated to be approximately 2,000 years old. Another specimen known as &quot;Grootboom&quot; was dated and found to be at least 1,275 years old. The Glencoe Baobab, a specimen of &quot;A. digitata&quot; in Limpopo Province, South Africa, was considered to be the largest living individual, with a maximum circumference of and a diameter of about . The tree has since split into two parts, so the widest individual trunk may now be that of the Sunland Baobab, or Platland tree, also in South Africa. The diameter of this tree at ground level is and its circumference at breast height is .

Two large baobabs growing in Tsimanampetsotse National Park were also studied using radiocarbon dating. One called &quot;Grandmother&quot; is made up of three fused trunks of different ages, with the oldest part of the tree an estimated 1,600 years old. The second, &quot;polygamous baobab&quot;, has six fused stems, and is an estimated 1,000 years old.

==Culinary uses==
===Leaves===
The tree&#x27;s leaves may be eaten as a leaf vegetable.

===Fruit===

The white pith in the fruit of the Australian baobab (&quot;A. gregorii&quot;) tastes like sherbet. It has an acidic, tart, citrus flavor. It is a good source of vitamin C, potassium, carbohydrates, and phosphorus. The dried fruit powder of &quot;A. digitata&quot;, baobab powder, contains about 11% water, 80% carbohydrates (50% fiber), and modest levels of various nutrients, including riboflavin, calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, and phytosterols, with low levels of protein and fats. Vitamin C content, described as variable in different samples, was in a range of per of dried powder. In 2008, baobab dried fruit pulp was authorized in the EU as a &quot;safe food ingredient&quot;, and later in the year was granted GRAS (&quot;generally recognized as safe&quot;) status in the United States. 

In Angola, the dry fruit of &quot;A. digitata&quot; is usually boiled, and the broth is used for juices or as the base for a type of ice cream known as &quot;gelado de múcua&quot;. In Zimbabwe, the fruit of &quot;A. digitata&quot; is eaten fresh or the crushed crumbly pulp is stirred into porridge and drinks. In Tanzania, the dry pulp of &quot;A. digitata&quot; is added to sugarcane to aid fermentation in brewing (beermaking).

===Seed===
The seeds of some species are a source of vegetable oil. The fruit pulp and seeds of &quot;A. grandidieri&quot; and &quot;A. za&quot; are eaten fresh.

==Other uses==
Some baobab species are sources of fiber, dye, and fuel. Indigenous Australians used the native species &quot;A. gregorii&quot; for several products, making string from the root fibers and decorative crafts from the fruits. Baobab oil from the seed is also used in cosmetics, particularly in moisturizers.

==In culture==
Baobab trees hold cultural and spiritual significance in many African societies. They are often the sites of communal gatherings, storytelling, and rituals. An unusual baobab was the namesake of Kukawa, formerly the capital of the Bornu Empire southwest of Lake Chad in Central Africa.

In the novel &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, the titular character takes care to root out baobabs that try to grow on his tiny planet home. The fearsome, grasping baobab trees, researchers have contended, were meant to represent Nazism attempting to destroy the planet.

<text>Sede vacante ( in Latin) refers, in the Canon Law of the Catholic Church, to the state during which a diocese or archdiocese is without a prelate installed in office, with the prelate&#x27;s office being the cathedral (some are also used as a place of residence if the prelate lives within the cathedral compound). The term is used frequently in reference to papal vacancies occurring upon the Pope&#x27;s death or resignation.

== History ==
Early in church history, the archpriest, archdeacon, and &quot; of the notaries&quot; in the papal court made a regency council which governed the period.

It was the obligation of the Camerarius (papal chamberlain), the head of the Camera Apostolica, to formally establish the death of the pope. Gradually, this led to the theory that the Camerarius, as the chief of the curia, should conduct normal business even after the death of the pope, and also conduct the burial and the preparation for the new election. This process was evident with Camerarius Boso Breakspeare. During the long of 1268 to 1271, the importance of the Camerarius was so clear that the Cardinals prepared to elect a new one if he died.

==Vacancy of the Holy See==

After the death or resignation of a pope, the Holy See enters a period of . In this case the particular church is the Diocese of Rome and the &quot;vacant seat&quot; is the of Saint John Lateran, the cathedral church of the Bishop of Rome. During this period, the Holy See is administered by a regency of the College of Cardinals.

According to , the government of the Holy See and the administration of the Catholic Church during sede vacante falls to the College of Cardinals, but in a very limited capacity. At the same time, all the heads of the departments of the Roman Curia &quot;cease to exercise&quot; their offices. The exceptions are the Cardinal Camerlengo, who is charged with managing the property of the Holy See, and the Major Penitentiary, who continues to exercise his normal role. If either has to do something which normally requires the assent of the Pope, he has to submit it to the College of Cardinals. Papal legates continue to exercise their diplomatic roles overseas, and both the Vicar General of Rome and the Vicar General for the Vatican City State continue to exercise their pastoral role during this period. The postal administration of the Vatican City State prepares and issues special postage stamps for use during this particular period, known as &quot; stamps&quot;.

The coat of arms of the Holy See also changes during this period. The papal tiara over the keys is replaced with the , or in Italian. This symbolizes both the lack of a Pope and the governance of the Camerlengo over the temporalities of the Holy See. As further indication, the Camerlengo ornaments his arms with this symbol during this period, which he subsequently removes once a pope is elected. Previously during this period the arms of the Camerlengo appeared on commemorative Vatican lira coinage. It now makes its appearance on Vatican euro coins, which are legal tender in all Eurozone states.

The interregnum is usually highlighted by the funeral Mass of the deceased pope, the general congregations of the College of Cardinals for determining the particulars of the election, and finally culminates in the papal conclave to elect a successor. Once a new pope has been elected (and ordained bishop if necessary) the period officially ends, even before the papal inauguration.

Cardinals present in Rome are required to wait at least fifteen days after the start of the vacancy before they hold the conclave to elect the new Pope. After twenty days have elapsed, they must hold the conclave, even if some cardinals are missing. The period from the death of the Pope to the start of the conclave was often shorter but, after William Henry Cardinal O&#x27;Connell had arrived just too late for two conclaves in a row, Pius XI extended the time limit. With the next conclave in 1939, cardinals began to travel by air. Days before his resignation in February 2013, Benedict XVI amended the rules to allow the cardinals to begin the conclave sooner, if all voting cardinals are present. Historically, periods have often been quite lengthy, lasting many months, or even years, due to lengthy deadlocked conclaves.

The most recent period of of the Holy See began on 28 February 2013, after the resignation of Benedict XVI, and ended on 13 March 2013 with the election of Pope Francis, a period of 13 days.

The longest period without a Pope in the last 250 years was the approximately half year from the death in prison of Pius VI in 1799 and the election of Pius VII in Venice in 1800.

===Extended periods===
Whilst conclaves and papal elections are generally completed in short order, there have been several periods when the papal chair has been vacant for months or even years.

The following table details periods in excess of a year:

=== periods since 1799===
==Catholic dioceses and archdioceses==
The term can be applied to Catholic dioceses, archdioceses, and eparchies outside of Rome. In such cases, this means that the particular diocesan bishop or archbishop has either died, resigned, been transferred to a different diocese or archdiocese, or lost his office and a successor has not yet been installed or assumed office. If there is a coadjutor bishop for the (arch)diocese, then this period does not take place, as the coadjutor bishop or archbishop immediately succeeds to the episcopal see.

Within eight days after the episcopal see is known to be vacant, the college of consultors (or the cathedral chapter in some countries) is obliged to elect a diocesan or archdiocesan administrator. The administrator they choose must be a/an priest or (arch)bishop who is at least 35 years old.

If the college of consultors fails to elect a qualifying person within the time allotted, the choice of an administrator passes to the metropolitan archbishop or, if the metropolitan see is vacant, to the senior-most by appointment of the suffragan bishops. The pope can also decide to name an administrator himself to a diocese or archdiocese instead of waiting for the college of consultors of a particular (arch)diocese, metropolitan archbishop or the senior-most by appointment of the bishops within the ecclesiastical province to appoint a/an (arch)diocesan administrator where it is then called as apostolic administrator. Usually, the emeritus (arch)bishop will be appointed in such a case. If the appointed apostolic administrator is a diocesan bishop or archbishop of a diocese or archdiocese, then he governs two (arch)dioceses which are his own and the vacant one, with the latter being temporarily while a successor of a vacant (arch)diocese is not yet installed or assumed office.

Before the election of the administrator of a vacant see, the governance of the see is entrusted, with the powers of a vicar general, to the auxiliary bishop, if there is one, or to the senior among them, if there are several, otherwise to the college of consultors as a whole. The administrator has greater powers, essentially those of a bishop or archbishop except for matters excepted by the nature of the matter or expressly by law. Canon law subjects his activity to various legal restrictions and to special supervision by the college of consultors (as for example canons 272 and 485).

Vicars general and episcopal vicars lose their powers if they are not bishops or archbishops; the vicars that are themselves having both positions retain the powers they had before the see fell vacant, which they are to exercise under the authority of the administrator. However, vicar generals retain their duties and responsibilities of the office—specifically during sede vacante serving as right-hand to the (arch)diocesan or apostolic administrator to establish continuity—until the succeeding (arch)bishop is installed or assumes office on a/an (arch)diocese.

A coat of arms of the last bishop or archbishop of a diocese or archdiocese, either the arms of a transferred, retired or died previous (arch)bishop or the one as (arch)bishop of a transferred (arch)diocese, may also be used during sede vacante period to indicate and establish continuity while awaiting for the installation of a successor. Once a successor is installed or assumed office which ends the sede vacante period, the coat of arms of a new (arch)bishop will then be used by the (arch)diocese and discontinuing the usage of the predecessor&#x27;s arms.

The name of a bishop or an archbishop is not mentioned in the Eucharistic Prayer while a successor is not yet installed or assumed office where after mentioning the Pope, the celebrant will either immediately mention the statement &quot;and all the clergy&quot; skipping the name of a/an (arch)bishop or generally stating all the (arch)bishops as &quot;the Order of Bishops&quot;. If a locally-appointed (arch)diocesan administrator or an apostolic administrator is a/an (arch)bishop, however, the name of an administrator is mentioned (&quot;our Administrator&quot;, or simply as &quot;our (Arch)bishop&quot;) as if a/an (arch)diocese have a prelate installed in office.

Additionally, the administrator cannot use the cathedra even if he is a bishop or an archbishop as it symbolizes the office of a full-time or mainstay prelate and the former only serves as the temporary head of a/an (arch)diocese while a successor is not yet installed into office therefore he can only use the chair reserved for the main celebrant of a mass.

==Other uses==
The term has been adopted in sedevacantism, an extreme strand of the Catholic traditionalist movement. Sedevacantists believe that all popes since the Second Vatican Council have been heretics, and that therefore the see of Rome is vacant.

<text>Human behavior is the potential and expressed capacity (mentally, physically, and socially) of human individuals or groups to respond to internal and external stimuli throughout their life. Behavior is driven by genetic and environmental factors that affect an individual. Behavior is also driven, in part, by thoughts and feelings, which provide insight into individual psyche, revealing such things as attitudes and values. Human behavior is shaped by psychological traits, as personality types vary from person to person, producing different actions and behavior.

Social behavior accounts for actions directed at others. It is concerned with the considerable influence of social interaction and culture, as well as ethics, interpersonal relationships, politics, and conflict. Some behaviors are common while others are unusual. The acceptability of behavior depends upon social norms and is regulated by various means of social control. Social norms also condition behavior, whereby humans are pressured into following certain rules and displaying certain behaviors that are deemed acceptable or unacceptable depending on the given society or culture.

Cognitive behavior accounts for actions of obtaining and using knowledge. It is concerned with how information is learned and passed on, as well as creative application of knowledge and personal beliefs such as religion. Physiological behavior accounts for actions to maintain the body. It is concerned with basic bodily functions as well as measures taken to maintain health. Economic behavior accounts for actions regarding the development, organization, and use of materials as well as other forms of work. Ecological behavior accounts for actions involving the ecosystem. It is concerned with how humans interact with other organisms and how the environment shapes human behavior.

== Study ==

Human behavior is studied by the social sciences, which include psychology, sociology, ethology, and their various branches and schools of thought. There are many different facets of human behavior, and no one definition or field study encompasses it in its entirety. The nature versus nurture debate is one of the fundamental divisions in the study of human behavior; this debate considers whether behavior is predominantly affected by genetic or environmental factors. The study of human behavior sometimes receives public attention due to its intersection with cultural issues, including crime, sexuality, and social inequality.

Some natural sciences also place emphasis on human behavior. Neurology and evolutionary biology, study how behavior is controlled by the nervous system and how the human mind evolved, respectively. In other fields, human behavior may be a secondary subject of study when considering how it affects another subject. Outside of formal scientific inquiry, human behavior and the human condition is also a major focus of philosophy and literature. Philosophy of mind considers aspects such as free will, the mind–body problem, and malleability of human behavior.

Human behavior may be evaluated through questionnaires, interviews, and experimental methods. Animal testing may also be used to test behaviors that can then be compared to human behavior. Twin studies are a common method by which human behavior is studied. Twins with identical genomes can be compared to isolate genetic and environmental factors in behavior. Lifestyle, susceptibility to disease, and unhealthy behaviors have been identified to have both genetic and environmental indicators through twin studies.

== Social behavior ==
Human social behavior is the behavior that considers other humans, including communication and cooperation. It is highly complex and structured, based on advanced theory of mind that allows humans to attribute thoughts and actions to one another. Through social behavior, humans have developed society and culture distinct from other animals. Human social behavior is governed by a combination of biological factors that affect all humans and cultural factors that change depending on upbringing and societal norms. Human communication is based heavily on language, typically through speech or writing. Nonverbal communication and paralanguage can modify the meaning of communications by demonstrating ideas and intent through physical and vocal behaviors.

=== Social norms ===
Human behavior in a society is governed by social norms. Social norms are unwritten expectations that members of society have for one another. These norms are ingrained in the particular culture that they emerge from, and humans often follow them unconsciously or without deliberation. These norms affect every aspect of life in human society, including decorum, social responsibility, property rights, contractual agreement, morality, and justice. Many norms facilitate coordination between members of society and prove mutually beneficial, such as norms regarding communication and agreements. Norms are enforced by social pressure, and individuals that violate social norms risk social exclusion.

Systems of ethics are used to guide human behavior to determine what is moral. Humans are distinct from other animals in the use of ethical systems to determine behavior. Ethical behavior is human behavior that takes into consideration how actions will affect others and whether behaviors will be optimal for others. What constitutes ethical behavior is determined by the individual value judgments of the person and the collective social norms regarding right and wrong. Value judgments are intrinsic to people of all cultures, though the specific systems used to evaluate them may vary. These systems may be derived from divine law, natural law, civil authority, reason, or a combination of these and other principles. Altruism is an associated behavior in which humans consider the welfare of others equally or preferentially to their own. While other animals engage in biological altruism, ethical altruism is unique to humans.

Deviance is behavior that violates social norms. As social norms vary between individuals and cultures, the nature and severity of a deviant act is subjective. What is considered deviant by a society may also change over time as new social norms are developed. Deviance is punished by other individuals through social stigma, censure, or violence. Many deviant actions are recognized as crimes and punished through a system of criminal justice. Deviant actions may be punished to prevent harm to others, to maintain a particular worldview and way of life, or to enforce principles of morality and decency. Cultures also attribute positive or negative value to certain physical traits, causing individuals that do not have desirable traits to be seen as deviant.

=== Interpersonal relationships ===
Interpersonal relationships can be evaluated by the specific choices and emotions between two individuals, or they can be evaluated by the broader societal context of how such a relationship is expected to function. Relationships are developed through communication, which creates intimacy, expresses emotions, and develops identity. An individual&#x27;s interpersonal relationships form a social group in which individuals all communicate and socialize with one another, and these social groups are connected by additional relationships. Human social behavior is affected not only by individual relationships, but also by how behaviors in one relationship may affect others. Individuals that actively seek out social interactions are extraverts, and those that do not are introverts.

Romantic love is a significant interpersonal attraction toward another. Its nature varies by culture, but it is often contingent on gender, occurring in conjunction with sexual attraction and being either heterosexual or homosexual. It takes different forms and is associated with many individual emotions. Many cultures place a higher emphasis on romantic love than other forms of interpersonal attraction. Marriage is a union between two people, though whether it is associated with romantic love is dependent on the culture. Individuals that are closely related by consanguinity form a family. There are many variations on family structures that may include parents and children as well as stepchildren or extended relatives. Family units with children emphasize parenting, in which parents engage in a high level of parental investment to protect and instruct children as they develop over a period of time longer than that of most other mammals.

=== Politics and conflict ===
When humans make decisions as a group, they engage in politics. Humans have evolved to engage in behaviors of self-interest, but this also includes behaviors that facilitate cooperation rather than conflict in collective settings. Individuals will often form in-group and out-group perceptions, through which individuals cooperate with the in-group and compete with the out-group. This causes behaviors such as unconsciously conforming, passively obeying authority, taking pleasure in the misfortune of opponents, initiating hostility toward out-group members, artificially creating out-groups when none exist, and punishing those that do not comply with the standards of the in-group. These behaviors lead to the creation of political systems that enforce in-group standards and norms.

When humans oppose one another, it creates conflict. It may occur when the involved parties have a disagreement of opinion, when one party obstructs the goals of another, or when parties experience negative emotions such as anger toward one another. Conflicts purely of disagreement are often resolved through communication or negotiation, but incorporation of emotional or obstructive aspects can escalate conflict. Interpersonal conflict is that between specific individuals or groups of individuals. Social conflict is that between different social groups or demographics. This form of conflict often takes place when groups in society are marginalized, do not have the resources they desire, wish to instigate social change, or wish to resist social change. Significant social conflict can cause civil disorder. International conflict is that between nations or governments. It may be solved through diplomacy or war.

== Cognitive behavior ==
Human cognition is distinct from that of other animals. This is derived from biological traits of human cognition, but also from shared knowledge and development passed down culturally. Humans are able to learn from one another due to advanced theory of mind that allows knowledge to be obtained through education. The use of language allows humans to directly pass knowledge to one another. The human brain has neuroplasticity, allowing it to modify its features in response to new experiences. This facilitates learning in humans and leads to behaviors of practice, allowing the development of new skills in individual humans. Behavior carried out over time can be ingrained as a habit, where humans will continue to regularly engage in the behavior without consciously deciding to do so.

Humans engage in reason to make inferences with a limited amount of information. Most human reasoning is done automatically without conscious effort on the part of the individual. Reasoning is carried out by making generalizations from past experiences and applying them to new circumstances. Learned knowledge is acquired to make more accurate inferences about the subject. Deductive reasoning infers conclusions that are true based on logical premises, while inductive reasoning infers what conclusions are likely to be true based on context.

Emotion is a cognitive experience innate to humans. Basic emotions such as joy, distress, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust are common to all cultures, though social norms regarding the expression of emotion may vary. Other emotions come from higher cognition, such as love, guilt, shame, embarrassment, pride, envy, and jealousy. These emotions develop over time rather than instantly and are more strongly influenced by cultural factors. Emotions are influenced by sensory information, such as color and music, and moods of happiness and sadness. Humans typically maintain a standard level of happiness or sadness determined by health and social relationships, though positive and negative events have short-term influences on mood. Humans often seek to improve the moods of one another through consolation, entertainment, and venting. Humans can also self-regulate mood through exercise and meditation.

Creativity is the use of previous ideas or resources to produce something original. It allows for innovation, adaptation to change, learning new information, and novel problem solving. Expression of creativity also supports quality of life. Creativity includes personal creativity, in which a person presents new ideas authentically, but it can also be expanded to social creativity, in which a community or society produces and recognizes ideas collectively. Creativity is applied in typical human life to solve problems as they occur. It also leads humans to carry out art and science. Individuals engaging in advanced creative work typically have specialized knowledge in that field, and humans draw on this knowledge to develop novel ideas. In art, creativity is used to develop new artistic works, such as visual art or music. In science, those with knowledge in a particular scientific field can use trial and error to develop theories that more accurately explain phenomena.

Religious behavior is a set of traditions that are followed based on the teachings of a religious belief system. The nature of religious behavior varies depending on the specific religious traditions. Most religious traditions involve variations of telling myths, practicing rituals, making certain things taboo, adopting symbolism, determining morality, experiencing altered states of consciousness, and believing in supernatural beings. Religious behavior is often demanding and has high time, energy, and material costs, and it conflicts with rational choice models of human behavior, though it does provide community-related benefits. Anthropologists offer competing theories as to why humans adopted religious behavior. Religious behavior is heavily influenced by social factors, and group involvement is significant in the development of an individual&#x27;s religious behavior. Social structures such as religious organizations or family units allow the sharing and coordination of religious behavior. These social connections reinforce the cognitive behaviors associated with religion, encouraging orthodoxy and commitment. According to a Pew Research Center report, 54% of adults around the world state that religion is very important in their lives as of 2018.

== Physiological behavior ==
Humans undergo many behaviors common to animals to support the processes of the human body. Humans eat food to obtain nutrition. These foods may be chosen for their nutritional value, but they may also be eaten for pleasure. Eating often follows a food preparation process to make it more enjoyable. Humans dispose of waste through urination and defecation. Excrement is often treated as taboo, particularly in developed and urban communities where sanitation is more widely available and excrement has no value as fertilizer. Humans also regularly engage in sleep, based on homeostatic and circadian factors. The circadian rhythm causes humans to require sleep at a regular pattern and is typically calibrated to the day-night cycle and sleep-wake habits. Homeostasis is also maintained, causing longer sleep longer after periods of sleep deprivation. The human sleep cycle takes place over 90 minutes, and it repeats 3–5 times during normal sleep.

There are also unique behaviors that humans undergo to maintain physical health. Humans have developed medicine to prevent and treat illnesses. In industrialized nations, eating habits that favor better nutrition, hygienic behaviors that promote sanitation, medical treatment to eradicate diseases, and the use of birth control significantly improve human health. Humans can also engage in exercise beyond that required for survival to maintain health. Humans engage in hygiene to limit exposure to dirt and pathogens. Some of these behaviors are adaptive while others are learned. Basic behaviors of disgust evolved as an adaptation to prevent contact with sources of pathogens, resulting in a biological aversion to feces, body fluids, rotten food, and animals that are commonly disease vectors. Personal grooming, disposal of human corpses, use of sewerage, and use of cleaning agents are hygienic behaviors common to most human societies.

Humans reproduce sexually, engaging in sexual intercourse for both reproduction and sexual pleasure. Human reproduction is closely associated with human sexuality and an instinctive desire to procreate, though humans are unique in that they intentionally control the number of offspring that they produce. Humans engage in a large variety of reproductive behaviors relative to other animals, with various mating structures that include forms of monogamy, polygyny, and polyandry. How humans engage in mating behavior is heavily influenced by cultural norms and customs. Unlike most mammals, human women ovulate spontaneously rather than seasonally, with a menstrual cycle that typically lasts 25–35 days.

Humans are bipedal and move by walking. Human walking corresponds to the bipedal gait cycle, which involves alternating heel contact and toe off with the ground and slight elevation and rotation of the pelvis. Balance while walking is learned during the first 7–9 years of life, and individual humans develop unique gaits while learning to displace weight, adjust center of mass, and coordinate neural control with movement. Humans can achieve higher speed by running. The endurance running hypothesis proposes that humans can outpace most other animals over long distances through running, though human running causes a higher rate of energy exertion. The human body self-regulates through perspiration during periods of exertion, allowing humans more endurance than other animals. The human hand is prehensile and capable of grasping objects and applying force with control over the hand&#x27;s dexterity and grip strength. This allows the use of complex tools by humans.

== Economic behavior ==

Humans engage in predictable behaviors when considering economic decisions, and these behaviors may or may not be rational. Humans make basic decisions through cost–benefit analysis and the acceptable rate of return at the minimum risk. Human economic decision making is often reference dependent, in which options are weighed in reference to the status quo rather than absolute gains and losses. Humans are also loss averse, fearing loss rather than seeking gain. Advanced economic behavior developed in humans after the Neolithic Revolution and the development of agriculture. These developments led to a sustainable supply of resources that allowed specialization in more complex societies.

=== Work ===
The nature of human work is defined by the complexity of society. The simplest societies are tribes that work primarily for sustenance as hunter-gatherers. In this sense, work is not a distinct activity but a constant that makes up all parts of life, as all members of the society must work consistently to stay alive.

More advanced societies developed after the Neolithic Revolution, emphasizing work in agricultural and pastoral settings. In these societies, production is increased, ending the need for constant work and allowing some individuals to specialize and work in areas outside of food-production. This also created non-laborious work, as increasing occupational complexity required some individuals to specialize in technical knowledge and administration. Laborious work in these societies has variously been carried out by slaves, serfs, peasants, and guild craftsmen.

The nature of work changed significantly during the Industrial Revolution in which the factory system was developed for use by industrializing nations. In addition to further increasing general quality of life, this development changed the dynamic of work. Under the factory system, workers increasingly collaborate with others, employers serve as authority figures during work hours, and forced labor is largely eradicated. Further changes occur in post-industrial societies where technological advance makes industries obsolete, replacing them with mass production and service industries.

Humans approach work differently based on both physical and personal attributes, and some work with more effectiveness and commitment than others. Some find work to contribute to personal fulfillment, while others work only out of necessity. Work can also serve as an identity, with individuals identifying themselves based on their occupation. Work motivation is complex, both contributing to and subtracting from various human needs. The primary motivation for work is for material gain, which takes the form of money in modern societies. It may also serve to create self-esteem and personal worth, provide activity, gain respect, and express creativity. Modern work is typically categorized as laborious or blue-collar work and non-laborious or white-collar work.

=== Leisure ===
Leisure is activity or lack of activity that takes place outside of work. It provides relaxation, entertainment, and improved quality of life for individuals. Engaging in leisure can be beneficial for physical and mental health. It may be used to seek temporary relief from psychological stress, to produce positive emotions, or to facilitate social interaction. However, leisure can also facilitate health risks and negative emotions caused by boredom, substance abuse, or high-risk behavior.

Leisure may be defined as serious or casual. Serious leisure behaviors involve non-professional pursuit of arts and sciences, the development of hobbies, or career volunteering in an area of expertise. Casual leisure behaviors provide short-term gratification, but they do not provide long-term gratification or personal identity. These include play, relaxation, casual social interaction, volunteering, passive entertainment, active entertainment, and sensory stimulation. Passive entertainment is typically derived from mass media, which may include written works or digital media. Active entertainment involves games in which individuals participate. Sensory stimulation is immediate gratification from behaviors such as eating or sexual intercourse.

=== Consumption ===

Humans operate as consumers that obtain and use goods. All production is ultimately designed for consumption, and consumers adapt their behavior based on the availability of production. Mass consumption began during the Industrial Revolution, caused by the development of new technologies that allowed for increased production. Many factors affect a consumer&#x27;s decision to purchase goods through trade. They may consider the nature of the product, its associated cost, the convenience of purchase, and the nature of advertising around the product. Cultural factors may influence this decision, as different cultures value different things, and subcultures may have different priorities when it comes to purchasing decisions. Social class, including wealth, education, and occupation may affect one&#x27;s purchasing behavior. A consumer&#x27;s interpersonal relationships and reference groups may also influence purchasing behavior.

== Ecological behavior ==
Like all living things, humans live in ecosystems and interact with other organisms. Human behavior is affected by the environment in which a human lives, and environments are affected by human habitation. Humans have also developed man-made ecosystems such as urban areas and agricultural land. Geography and landscape ecology determine how humans are distributed within an ecosystem, both naturally and through planned urban morphology.

Humans exercise control over the animals that live within their environment. Domesticated animals are trained and cared for by humans. Humans can develop social and emotional bonds with animals in their care. Pets are kept for companionship within human homes, including dogs and cats that have been bred for domestication over many centuries. Livestock animals, such as cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry, are kept on agricultural land to produce animal products. Domesticated animals are also kept in laboratories for animal testing. Non-domesticated animals are sometimes kept in nature reserves and zoos for tourism and conservation.

==Causes and factors==
Human behavior is influenced by biological and cultural elements. The structure and agency debate considers whether human behavior is predominantly led by individual human impulses or by external structural forces. Behavioral genetics considers how human behavior is affected by inherited traits. Though genes do not guarantee certain behaviors, certain traits can be inherited that make individuals more likely to engage in certain behaviors or express certain personalities. An individual&#x27;s environment can also affect behavior, often in conjunction with genetic factors. An individual&#x27;s personality and attitudes affect how behaviors are expressed, formed in conjunction by genetic and environmental factors.

=== Age ===
;Infants
Infants are limited in their ability to interpret their surroundings shortly after birth. Object permanence and understanding of motion typically develop within the first six months of an infant&#x27;s life, though the specific cognitive processes are not understood. The ability to mentally categorize different concepts and objects that they perceive also develops within the first year. Infants are quickly able to discern their body from their surroundings and often take interest in their own limbs or actions they cause by two months of age.

Infants practice imitation of other individuals to engage socially and learn new behaviors. In young infants, this involves imitating facial expressions, and imitation of tool use takes place within the first year. Communication develops over the first year, and infants begin using gestures to communicate intention around nine to ten months of age. Verbal communication develops more gradually, taking form during the second year of age.

;Children
Children develop fine motor skills shortly after infancy, in the range of three to six years of age, allowing them to engage in behaviors using the hands and eye–hand coordination and perform basic activities of self sufficiency. Children begin expressing more complex emotions in the three- to six-year-old range, including humor, empathy, and altruism, as well engaging in creativity and inquiry. Aggressive behaviors also become varied at this age as children engage in increased physical aggression before learning to favor diplomacy over aggression. Children at this age can express themselves using language with basic grammar.

As children grow older, they develop emotional intelligence. Young children engage in basic social behaviors with peers, typically forming friendships centered on play with individuals of the same age and gender. Behaviors of young children are centered around play, which allows them to practice physical, cognitive, and social behaviors. Basic self-concept first develops as children grow, particularly centered around traits such as gender and ethnicity, and behavior is heavily affected by peers for the first time.

;Adolescents
Adolescents undergo changes in behavior caused by puberty and the associated changes in hormone production. Production of testosterone increases sensation seeking and sensitivity to rewards in adolescents as well as aggression and risk-taking in adolescent boys. Production of estradiol causes similar risk-taking behavior among adolescent girls. The new hormones cause changes in emotional processing that allow for close friendships, stronger motivations and intentions, and adolescent sexuality.

Adolescents undergo social changes on a large scale, developing a full self-concept and making autonomous decisions independently of adults. They typically become more aware of social norms and social cues than children, causing an increase in self-consciousness and adolescent egocentrism that guides behavior in social settings throughout adolescence.

=== Culture and environment ===
Human brains, as with those of all mammals, are neuroplastic. This means that the structure of the brain changes over time as neural pathways are altered in response to the environment. Many behaviors are learned through interaction with others during early development of the brain. Human behavior is distinct from the behavior of other animals in that it is heavily influenced by culture and language. Social learning allows humans to develop new behaviors by following the example of others. Culture is also the guiding influence that defines social norms.

=== Physiology ===
Neurotransmitters, hormones, and metabolism are all recognized as biological factors in human behavior.

Physical disabilities can prevent individuals from engaging in typical human behavior or necessitate alternative behaviors. Accommodations and accessibility are often made available for individuals with physical disabilities in developed nations, including health care, assistive technology, and vocational services. Severe disabilities are associated with increased leisure time but also with a lower satisfaction in the quality of leisure time.

<text>Louise is a “musical novel,” or “,” in four acts and five scenes by Gustave Charpentier. It can be considered an opera. The composer himself penned the French libretto with contributions from Saint-Pol-Roux, a symbolist poet and the inspiration of the surrealists. It is an atmospheric story of working-class life in Paris, with the city itself invoked along the way: young Louise, a seamstress living with her parents, loves Julien, an artist; she desires freedom, associated in her mind with him and the city. (Charpentier would later write a sequel, the opera &quot;Julien&quot;, describing the artist&#x27;s aspirations.) Musically the work is considered an example of &quot;verismo&quot;, and marks the beginning of naturalism in French opera.

==Performance history==

&quot;Louise&quot; was premiered on 2 February 1900 at the Salle Favart by the Opéra-Comique conducted by André Messager in a production by Albert Carré. It was successful, reaching its 100th performance just over a year later; the 500th performance at the Opéra-Comique took place on 17 January 1921, and by the early 1950s it had reached over 950 performances. The opera helped launch the career of the soprano Mary Garden, who sang Louise in Act 3 at the eighth performance. On 30 April 1900 the Opéra-Comique director Albert Carré gave away 400 seats to Paris dressmakers.

The success in Paris led to productions in Algiers, Brussels, Budapest and Milan in 1901 and in Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Geneva and Stockholm in 1902, followed by other cities.
First seen in New York City at the Manhattan Opera House in 1908, &quot;Louise&quot; was premiered by the Metropolitan Opera on January 15, 1921 (with Geraldine Farrar in the title role and Flora Perini as Gertrude). It was revived at the Met in a new production in 1930, broadcast twice (in 1939 and 1948), after 1949 it disappeared from the Met repertoire.

The revival of &quot;Louise&quot; at the Opéra-Comique on 28 February 1950, with scenery after maquettes by Utrillo and Géori Boué in the title role, celebrated the 50th anniversary of its creation and the 90th birthday of its composer. Although it was hoped that Charpentier might conduct the performance, in the end André Cluytens did so, but with the composer conducting the &#x27;Chant de l’apothéose&#x27; after the 3rd act.

&quot;Louise&quot; was staged by English National Opera in 1981, and more recently, at the Paris Opera (2008), Duisburg (2008), the Spoleto Festival (2009), the Opéra National du Rhin in Strasbourg and Mulhouse (2009), and Düsseldorf (2010). There are several recordings, and the opera is still performed today. The third-act aria &#x27;Depuis le jour&#x27; is a popular concert piece that has often been recorded.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==
===Act 1===
&quot;The Parisian home of Louise&#x27;s parents&quot;

Louise has fallen in love with her neighbor, Julien. At the opening of the opera, they recall how they met. Louise&#x27;s mother interrupts them and vocally expresses her disapproval of Julien. The exhausted father comes home from work and his wife and daughter implore him to quit the taxing job. However, he feels that it is his responsibility to provide for his family. At supper, he reads a letter that Julien left in which he proposed marriage to Louise. He is indifferent, but the mother is livid and, when Louise stands up for Julien, she slaps Louise across the face. The peaceful father asks his daughter to sit with him and read the paper. As she reads about springtime in Paris, she breaks down and cries.

===Act 2===
&quot;Scene 1: A street in Paris&quot;

It begins with a prelude that suggests dawn in Paris. The curtain rises to a bustling scene where people go about their daily routines and comment about life in general. The Noctambulist enters and calls himself the spirit of the Pleasure of Paris, and then leaves with the daughter of a ragman. Julien appears with a group of fellow bohemians to show them where Louise works. He tells them that if her parents do not consent to marriage, he will carry the girl off. Julien and his companions go off and he sings that the medley of sounds around him is the voice of Paris itself. Louise and her Mother arrive at the dressmaking store where Louise works (her mother brings her to work everyday). When the mother leaves, Julien returns. Louise tells him she loves him, but she loves her parents too much to leave them. He tries to persuade her to run off with him and she finally agrees to do so soon.

&quot;Scene 2: Inside Louise&#x27;s place of work&quot;

Louise is being teased by the other seamstresses for being in love. A band is heard outside and Julien sings a serenade. The girls admire him for his looks and voice. Louise quietly slips away – to run off with Julien.

===Act 3===
&quot;A cottage overlooking Paris&quot;

The act opens with the opera&#x27;s most well known aria, &quot;Depuis le jour&quot;; the lovers have moved into a cottage overlooking Paris and in the aria she sings of her happiness with her new existence and with her lover. A long love duet ensues in which they sing of their love for each other and Paris. Many Bohemians enter and crown Louise Queen of Montmartre. The Noctambulist presides as the King of the Fools. Louise&#x27;s mother appears and the festivities end. She tells Louise of her father&#x27;s illness and that her father creeps into Louise&#x27;s room in the middle of the night, even though they agreed to regard her as dead. Even Julien is moved, and he lets Louise leave on the promise she will return whenever she wishes.

===Act 4===
&quot;The Parisian home of Louise&#x27;s parents&quot;

The father has regained his health and spirits. He is working again, but has come to accept poverty in a philosophical way. His recovery can be attributed to the return of Louise, whom he takes into his arms and sings a lullaby. She is not comforted and longs to be with Julien again. A merry waltz is heard outside and Louise takes it up, singing madly of love and freedom. Her parents are shocked and her father becomes increasingly angry. He shouts at Louise and demands that she leave; if that is what she wants, let her go and dance and laugh! He begins to attack her, but the mother stands in the way. Louise runs from the room to go back to Julien. Only then does the father realise what he did. &quot;Louise, Louise!&quot; he calls. She is gone and in despair he shakes his fist at the city that stole his daughter, &quot;Paris!&quot; he moans and the opera closes.

==Film==

An abridged version of &quot;Louise&quot; was made into a film in 1939, under the supervision of the composer. This included spoken dialogue. The director was Abel Gance. Louise was played by Grace Moore, Julien by Georges Thill, and the father by André Pernet.

<text>The University of St. Thomas (UST or St. Thomas) is a private Catholic university in Houston, Texas. It was founded by the Basilian Fathers in 1947 and is the only Catholic university in the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston.

==History==
On June 24, 1944, the bishop of the Diocese of Galveston, Christopher E. Byrne, entered into an agreement with the Houston-based members of the Congregation of St. Basil to found a co-educational Roman Catholic university in Houston &quot;as soon as practicable after World War II, if possible by 1947.&quot; The Basilian Fathers had previously started several other secondary schools, as well as institutions of higher learning, throughout Texas in the early 20th century, including St. Thomas High School, also located in Houston. The first classes at UST began on September 22, 1947, with 57 freshmen and 8 faculty members. UST graduated its first class on May 31, 1951. In addition to the Basilian Fathers on staff, there were for some time also several Franciscan Sisters of the Eucharist who reside in the convent on campus. The order no longer has a presence there, but the Houston Vietnamese Dominican Sisters and the Sisters of Mary Mother of the Eucharist serve in some teaching capacities.

The university is named after St. Thomas Aquinas. Originally consisting solely of the Link–Lee House on the corner of Montrose and West Alabama, the university has expanded towards the South and West over the last 60 years. The current expansion plan includes the acquisition and development of the majority of the land comprising 25 city blocks.

Former university president J. Michael Miller, C.S.B. was appointed on November 25, 2003, by the pope to preside as Secretary of the Congregation for Catholic Education. By virtue of this office, Miller was elevated to archbishop by Pope John Paul II on January 12, 2004.

==Campuses==
===Main===
The University of St. Thomas&#x27;s main campus is located in the Montrose neighborhood of Neartown. The campus borders Houston&#x27;s Museum District and is adjacent to the Menil Collection and the Rothko Chapel.

Many of the university&#x27;s offices are in houses built in 1930s that are scattered throughout campus. Some of the buildings are historic including the Link–Lee House. It contains the university&#x27;s executive office. 
The Theology department is located in the childhood home of Howard Hughes. The campus is arranged in a square format, with the main focus of buildings on the north side of the campus which is called the Academic Mall. Composed of rectangular buildings, the Academic Mall is the symbolic architecture of Philip Johnson. On the south end of the Academic Mall is the Doherty Library. The Chapel of St. Basil is located at the opposite end. Four structures flank these two buildings on each side in a rectangular formation surrounding a courtyard. The setup is designed to display the methods of human knowledge (faith, represented by the chapel, and reason, represented by the library) in dialogue regarding the various subject matters.

The Chapel of St. Basil is the main location of Catholic worship on campus. The Chapel of St. Basil is a unique work of art that has won many awards for its architecture. Basil was a fourth-century bishop who was a proponent of both education and the monastic life. The Chapel sits at the north end of the Academic Mall, representing faith in the Academic Mall&#x27;s artistic depiction of faith and reason balanced in dialogue.

There is no artificial light inside the main section of the building during the daytime. There is sufficient sunlight to fully light the worship space, as a combination of smooth textures and reflective surfaces maximize all light shone in the building. At night, the lights from outside combined with candles inside the chapel are more than enough to illuminate the worship area.

The entry to the outdoor narthex of the chapel is created with a tent-like flap extending over the entry, creating an enclosed space that is still outdoors. The architecture also shifts the focus the building: the entrances to the Chapel face away from the center of the building and towards the tabernacle to remind all who enter that the central point of the chapel is not the altar or the crucifix, but the location of the Eucharist.
During the 2005–2006 school year, the Gueymard Meditation Garden was built on the west side of the chapel. The garden features three fountains, representing the persons of the Trinity, and benches for reflection. It also includes a replica of the labyrinth in the Cathedral of Chartres in France. Seen from above, the four arms of the pattern stand out as a clear image of the cross of Jesus Christ.
Completed in September 1972, The Robert Pace and Ada Mary Doherty Library (located at the southern end of the Academic Mall) is one of the premier research libraries in Houston. It houses over 250,000 books, 80,000 periodicals, and 150 databases.

In 2019 the university unveiled a mural created by Mario Figueroa Jr. (Gonzo247), the first such mural on this campus.

The University of St. Thomas owns a shopping center which formerly had the Black Labrador, which served British cuisine and alcohol. After the restaurant closed in 2021, St. Thomas repurposed the space as a university-managed alumni center using the same decorations.

===St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary===
The school of theology is in St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary.

===Conroe===
The first phase of the Conroe campus is to open in fall 2020, with the Old Conroe Police building as a temporary site for up to three years. The permanent campus is proposed to be at Deison Technology Park. Class of 1952 alumnus Vincent D’Amico offered the university of land in east Montgomery County for the project.

===Saint John Paul II Institute===
The Saint John Paul II Institute at University of St. Thomas offers comprehensive study of the thought of John Paul II, including travel to Poland.

==Students and alumni==

The university currently maintains a population of 1,609 traditional undergraduate students and 1,973 graduate students. Adding to this number are non-traditional, off-campus, study-abroad, special program, and seminary students that bring the grand total to 3,582 students.

UST enrolls a diverse group of students with 61% of the total number of students African-American, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian. UST also maintains a student body that is at least 25% Hispanic. The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities rates UST as an Hispanic-serving institution; it is the only private institution of higher education in Houston to earn this rating. 58% of the total enrollment is Catholic. In 2019, the university was designated by the Department of Education as an Asian-Serving Institution
University students come from 40 states throughout the U.S. as well as 54 countries around the world.

==Athletics==
The St. Thomas (UST) athletic teams called are the Celts. The university is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference (SCAC) as a provisional member since the 2019–20 academic year. The Celts previously competed in the Red River Athletic Conference (RRAC) at the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 2011–12 to 2018–19; as well as an NAIA Independent within the Association of Independent Institutions (AII) from 2007–08 to 2010–11.

UST competes in 16 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball; and co-ed sports include cheerleading.

==Student life==

===Residential housing===

The university has three types of campus housing, both under the direction of Residence Life.

Guinan Residence Hall is a three-story, 306-bed facility with private double-occupancy rooms. It is located near the Moran Parking Center and Crooker Center and provides a residential experience focused on community living.

Apartment-style housing, located on the south side of campus, offers apartments to upper-class students and graduate or adult students who want to benefit from a Residence Life community.

Households are intentional Catholic communities of students that live, study, and pray together. They are housed in the local townhomes on campus or in Young Hall.

===Neewollah===
An annual tradition dating back more than 50 years is the &quot;Neewollah&quot; Party (Halloween spelled backwards), held every year in October. Hundreds of students dress up in costume and party on campus as various local bands and DJs provide music. Students compete for prizes in costume and dance contests. The event draws about 600 people and is held on Crooker Patio, a large area in front of the university&#x27;s dining hall.

===Other campus events===
* Cinco de Mayo Celebration
* Houston Italian Festival
* International Festival
* Spring Formal
* Salsa Night
* Texas Independence Day Celebration

==Student organizations==
The Executive Student Organization (ESO) is a collective of student leaders from seven major organizations that oversee many areas of student life. The ESO is presided over by the Student Body President. All ESO members have an administrative or faculty adviser. The ESO holds jurisdiction and management over all funds that are accumulated through the Student Activity Fee.

The university acknowledges 82 student organizations. Honor Societies and Academic Clubs are often overseen by their departments, but some seek student government approval for financial purposes. Other organizations are under the directorship of administrative offices such as Campus Ministry. Others include the Knights of Columbus, Catholic Daughters of the Americas Court of St. Macrina, Legion of Mary, and over 20 department-run honor societies.

===Publications===
*&quot;Laurels&quot; literary magazine publishes poems, short fiction, and other creative writing submitted by enrolled students. It is led by three appointed editors. During the fall, the three editors are responsible for the administration and editing of the issue. However, a curriculum-approved Literary magazine class, in cooperation with the editors, is responsible for the spring issue.
*&quot;Thoroughfare&quot; magazine is the newest publication on campus. Modeled after The New Yorker as a &quot;features&quot; magazine, it highlights students, organizations, events, places, and local occurrences in Houston. It is led by an appointed student editor-in-chief with the help of a student staff.

<doc id="563307" wikidata="Q7504672" url="?curid=563307" title="Floppy disk drive interface">
<text>Each generation of floppy disk drive (FDD) began with a variety of incompatible interfaces but soon evolved into one de facto standard interface for the generations of 8-inch FDDs, 5.25-inch FDDs and 3.5-inch FDDs. For example, before adopting 3.5-inch FDD standards for interface, media and form factor there were drives and media proposed by Hitachi, Tabor, Sony, Tandon, Shugart and Canon.

== Sizes ==

=== 8 inch ===
The de facto standard 8 inch FDD interface is based upon the Shugart Associates models SA800/801 FDDs and models SA850/851 FDDs. The signal interface uses a 50-pin PCB edge connector which mates to a flat ribbon cable connector. Separate connectors are provided for both AC and DC power, as many 8 inch drives used AC spindle motors.

=== 5.25 inch ===
The de facto standard 5.25 inch FDD interface is based upon the Shugart Associates SA400 FDD. The signal interface uses a 34-pin PCB edge connector which mates to a flat ribbon cable connector. DC power is provided on a separate connector. The 34-pin connector is similar in pinout to the standard 50-pin connector for 8 inch FDDs.

=== 3.5 inch ===
The de facto standard for 3.5 inch drives uses a 34-pin header mating to an IDC Berg connector, collectively slightly smaller than the PCB edge pin connector and mating socket used for the 5¼ inch standard but with the same 34 pin definitions as the 5¼ inch standard. A separate connector is provided for DC power. A &#x27;universal&#x27; cable would have four drive connectors, two for each size of FDD, although cables which have only two drive connectors are common. The cable is normally a ribbon cable. For IBM-compatible floppy controllers, a twist in the cable reverses the order of conductors 10 through 16 for the second connector. This allows two drives connected to the same cable to be addressed by the host controller without having to select drive assignments with jumpers on the drives themselves. Only two drives may be connected to such a cable. If there are four drive connectors at least two must remain unused. 

== Signal and control interface ==
3.5-inch and 5.25-inch drives connect to the floppy controller using a 34-conductor flat ribbon cable for signal and control. Most controllers support two floppy drives, although the Shugart standard supports up to four drives attached to a single controller. A cable could have 5.25-inch style connectors, 3.5-inch style connectors, or a combination. After IBM introduced the &quot;twist&quot; to floppy cables, and when both 5.25-inch and 3.5-inch drives were in common use, many cables had four connectors: one of each type before the twist, and one of each type after the twist. These cables still only supported two drives, one before and one after the twist, but they allowed using one cable for any combination of drives with differing connectors. This type of cable is called a universal cable.

When multiple floppy disks are connected, many pins are shared, including the read and write data pins. As a result, early floppy drives required jumpers to be set on the drive to tell it which controller commands it should receive. When introducing the PC, IBM sliced the cable between the first and second drive, and twisted seven of the conductors, effectively flipping the four conductors which specifically addressed the first or second drive. (The remaining three were ground only, so were not affected by the twist.) As a result, all drives could have their jumpers set to be drive &quot;B&quot;, but if they were connected after the twist, they would appear to the controller as drive &quot;A&quot;. This eliminated the need to change selection jumpers in the drive, and eventually many floppy drives were manufactured without jumpers at all, instead being hardwired as drive &quot;B&quot;. As the IBM PC created a market for clones and compatibles, many manufacturers adopted the same cable twist system, although jumpers may still be required on systems that are older, or not based on the IBM PC.

The drive that is at furthest end of the cable additionally would have a terminating resistor installed to maintain signal quality.

The following explanation of pinout is for reference only.


&quot;#&quot; indicates that the low electric level is effective (aka &quot;active low&quot;).

Motor A,B is also known as Motor 0,1.

Since floppy disks are rarely used nowadays, &quot;MOTEB#&quot; and &quot;DRVSB&quot; pins are not connected in motherboards designed with floppy disk data interfaces, and only one floppy disk drive can be connected.

<text>Anti-Machiavel is an 18th-century essay by Frederick the Great, King of Prussia and patron of Voltaire, consisting of a chapter-by-chapter rebuttal of &quot;The Prince&quot;, the 16th-century book by Niccolò Machiavelli. It was first published in September 1740, a few months after Frederick became king.

==Composition and publication==

The work, written in French, was produced at a turning point in Frederick&#x27;s life, after his turbulent and rebellious youth, and immediately before his assumption of the throne of Prussia. Frederick had, of course, read Machiavelli long before; it is not exactly clear what drew his attention to this subject in the late 1730s, although his affiliation with Voltaire and his impending change in rank most certainly contributed to the project. It is known from letters to Voltaire that Frederick began to ruminate on the project early in 1738; his draft of the brief work was completed by the end of 1739.

Voltaire took over in Summer 1740. Living in Huis Honselaarsdijk, the Prussian residence near The Hague, and working with a dubious printer named Jan van Duren, Voltaire revised the text extensively on purpose and in order to get the manuscript back. There was also a combined edition, with Voltaire&#x27;s emendations as footnotes.

Frederick sent Francesco Algarotti to London to take care of the publication of Anti-Machiavel in English. In the meantime, Frederick had become king, and his authorship — which was a very open secret — made the book an instant success and bestseller. Not surprisingly, Frederick had other matters to occupy his attention, and he did not return to the work in an appreciable way.

==Argument==
Frederick&#x27;s argument is essentially moral in nature: he asserts that Machiavelli offered a partial and biased view of statecraft. His own views appear to reflect a largely Enlightenment ideal of rational and benevolent statesmanship: the king, Frederick contends, is charged with maintaining the health and prosperity of his subjects. On the one hand, then, Machiavelli erred by assigning too great a value on princely machinations that, Frederick claims, ended in disaster, as the king&#x27;s evil actions are taken up by his subjects. On the other hand, and in support of the first idea, Frederick points out the numerous cases in which Machiavelli had ignored or slighted the bad ends of the numerous malefactors he describes and praises.

<doc id="563320" wikidata="Q1385694" url="?curid=563320" title="EyeTap">
<text>An EyeTap is a concept for a wearable computing device that is worn in front of the eye that acts as a camera to record the scene available to the eye as well as a display to superimpose computer-generated imagery on the original scene available to the eye. This structure allows the user&#x27;s eye to operate as both a monitor and a camera as the EyeTap intakes the world around it and augments the image the user sees allowing it to overlay computer-generated data over top of the normal world the user would perceive.

In order to capture what the eye is seeing as accurately as possible, an EyeTap uses a beam splitter to send the same scene (with reduced intensity) to both the eye and a camera. The camera then digitizes the reflected image of the scene and sends it to a computer. The computer processes the image and then sends it to a projector. The projector sends the image to the other side of the beam splitter so that this computer-generated image is reflected into the eye to be superimposed on the original scene. Stereo EyeTaps modify light passing through both eyes, but many research prototypes (mainly for reasons of ease of construction) only tap one eye.

&quot;EyeTap&quot; is also the name of an organization founded by inventor Steve Mann to develop and promote EyeTap-related technologies such as wearable computers.

== Possible uses ==
An EyeTap is somewhat like a head-up display (HUD). The important difference is that the scene available to the eye is also available to the computer that projects the head-up display. This enables the EyeTap to modify the computer generated scene in response to the natural scene. One use, for instance, would be a sports EyeTap: here the wearer, while in a stadium, would be able to follow a particular player in a field and have the EyeTap display statistics relevant to that player as a floating box above the player. Another practical use for the EyeTap would be in a construction yard as it would allow the user to reference the blueprints, especially in a 3D manner, to the current state of the building, display a list of current materials and their current locations as well perform basic measurements. Or, even in the business world, the EyeTap has great potential, for it would be capable of delivering to the user constant up to date information on the stock market, the user&#x27;s corporation, and meeting statuses. On a more day-to-day basis some of Steve Mann&#x27;s first uses for the technology was using it to keep track of names of people and places, his to-do lists, and keeping track of his other daily ordeals. The EyeTap Criteria are an attempt to define how close a real, practical device comes to such an ideal. EyeTaps could have great use in any field where the user would benefit from real-time interactive information that is largely visual in nature. This is sometimes referred to as &quot;computer-mediated reality&quot;, commonly known as &quot;augmented reality&quot;.

Eyetap has been explored as a potential tool for individuals with visual disabilities due to its abilities to direct visual information to parts of the retina that function well. As well, Eyetap&#x27;s role in sousveillance has been explored by Mann, Jason Nolan and Barry Wellman.

== Possible side effects ==

Users may find that they experience side effects such as headaches and difficulty sleeping if usage occurs shortly before sleep. Mann finds that due to his extensive use of the device that going without it can cause him to feel &quot;nauseous, unsteady, naked&quot; when he removes it.

== Cyborglogs &amp; EyeTaps ==

The EyeTap has applications in the world of cyborg logging, as it allows the user the ability to perform real-time visual capture of their daily lives from their own point of view. In this way, the EyeTap could be used to create a lifelong cyborg log or “glog” of the user&#x27;s life and the events they participate in, potentially recording enough media to allow producers centuries in the future to present the user&#x27;s life as interactive entertainment (or historical education) to consumers of that era.

== History ==
Steve Mann created the first version of the EyeTap, which consisted of a computer in a backpack wired up to a camera and its viewfinder which in turn was rigged to a helmet. Ever since this first version, it has gone through multiple models as wearable computing evolves, allowing the EyeTap to shrink down to a smaller and less weighty version.

Currently the EyeTap consists of the eyepiece used to display the images, the keypad which the user can use to interface with the EyeTap and have it perform the desired tasks, a CPU which can be attached to most articles of clothing and in some cases even a Wi-Fi device so the user can access the Internet and online data.

== Principle of operation ==

The EyeTap is essentially a half-silvered mirror in front of the user&#x27;s eye, reflecting some of the light into a sensor. The sensor then sends the image to the aremac, a display device capable of displaying data at any fitting depth. The output rays from the aremac are reflected off the half-silvered mirror back into the eye of the user along with the original light rays.

In these cases, the EyeTap views infrared light, as well as the overall design schematic of how the EyeTap manipulates lightrays.

<doc id="563328" wikidata="Q905112" url="?curid=563328" title="The End of the Affair">
<text>The End of the Affair is a 1951 novel by British author Graham Greene, as well as the title of two feature films (released in 1955 and 1999) that were adapted from the novel. Set in London during and just after the Second World War, the novel examines the obsessions, jealousy and discernments within the relationships between three central characters: writer Maurice Bendrix; Sarah Miles; and her husband, civil servant Henry Miles.

Graham Greene&#x27;s own affair with Catherine Walston formed the basis for &quot;The End of the Affair&quot;. The British edition of the novel is dedicated to &quot;C&quot; while the American version is made out to &quot;Catherine&quot;. Greene&#x27;s own house at 14 Clapham Common Northside was bombed during the Blitz.

&quot;The End of the Affair&quot; is the fourth and final of Greene&#x27;s &quot;Catholic novels&quot; tetralogy, following &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; (1938), &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; (1940), and &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; (1948).

==Synopsis==
The novel focuses on Maurice Bendrix, a rising writer during the Second World War in London, and Sarah Miles, the wife of an impotent civil servant. Bendrix is based on Greene himself, and he reflects often on the act of writing a novel. Sarah is based on Greene&#x27;s lover at the time, Catherine Walston, to whom the book is dedicated.

Bendrix and Sarah fall in love quickly, but he soon realises that the affair will end as quickly as it began. The relationship suffers from his overt and admitted jealousy. He is frustrated by her refusal to divorce Henry, her amiable but boring husband. When a V-2 rocket blasts Bendrix&#x27;s flat as he is with Sarah, he is nearly killed. After this, Sarah breaks off the affair with no apparent explanation.

Later, Bendrix is still wracked with jealousy when he sees Henry crossing the Common that separates their flats. Henry has finally started to suspect something, and Bendrix decides to go to a private detective to discover Sarah&#x27;s new lover. Through her diary, he learns that, when she thought he was dead after the bombing, she made a promise to God not to see Bendrix again if He allowed him to live. Greene describes Sarah&#x27;s struggles. After her sudden death from a lung infection brought to a climax by walking on the Common in the rain, several miraculous events occur, advocating for some kind of meaningfulness to Sarah&#x27;s faith. By the last page of the novel, Bendrix comes to believe in a God as well.

==Critical response==

&quot;The End of the Affair&quot; is often considered among Greene&#x27;s best novels. Writer Evelyn Waugh favorably reviewed the novel in a 6 September 1951 piece for &quot;The Month&quot; magazine. Waugh would later write, &quot;Mr Greene has chosen another contemporary form, domestic, romantic drama of the type of &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;, and has transformed that in his own inimitable way.&quot; Waugh also noted that the story was “a singularly beautiful and moving one&quot;. Alex Preston writing for The Independent had similar praise for Greene&#x27;s book: &quot;&#x27;The End of the Affair&#x27; is his masterpiece: an astonishing, painfully moving interrogation of the contradictions in a Catholicism he couldn&#x27;t live without but struggled to live with.&quot;

The novel was chosen by Robert McCrum for his list of the &#x27;100 Greatest Novels in English&#x27;.

Writer Jonathan Franzen said that he considered E. M. Forster and Graham Greene overrated, in particular highlighting &quot;The End of the Affair&quot;. However, he did also comment that he believed that part of the reason for this was his being American, as he said that many authors&#x27; brilliance is lost when it crosses the Atlantic. He said that he believed that the effect may have occurred with David Foster Wallace.

==Adaptations==

In 1955, the book was made into a film, directed by Edward Dmytryk, with the screenplay adaptation by Lenore J. Coffee. David Lewis was the producer and David E. Rose executive producer. It starred Deborah Kerr as Sarah Miles, Van Johnson as Maurice Bendrix, John Mills as Albert Parkis, and Peter Cushing as Henry Miles.

In 1997, the novel was adapted into a play of the same name by Rupert Goold and Caroline Butler. It was first produced at the Salisbury Playhouse on 9 October 1997, directed by Goold. The first production included music played by a pianist at the side of the stage, underscoring the text with some period songs sung by the cast. Goold and Butler removed the music from later productions and the play was published without musical interpolation in 2001.

In 1999, the novel was made into another film, &quot;The End of the Affair&quot;, directed by Neil Jordan. Jordan also wrote the screenplay and produced the film with Stephen Woolley. It starred American actress Julianne Moore as Sarah Miles, English actor Ralph Fiennes as Maurice Bendrix, and Irish actor Stephen Rea as Henry Miles. Julianne Moore was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance.

In 2004, Jake Heggie composed an opera based on the novel. It premiered at the Houston Grand Opera in March of that year, and was subsequently revised into its final form.

In 2011, the novel was adapted into a play by Karla Boos and had its world premiere at Quantum Theatre.

In 2012, an audio edition performed by Colin Firth and produced by Audible.com was released; the recording was recognized as Audiobook of the Year at the Audies Gala in May 2013.

==Cultural influence==
Various websites have suggested that the 2012 Bollywood film &quot;Jab Tak Hai Jaan&quot; might have drawn inspiration from the novel.

The Italian band Daisy Chains has released an album titled &quot;A Story Has No Beginning or End&quot;, which is the first line of the novel, and the album&#x27;s second track is titled &quot;The End of the Affair&quot;. The book also inspired the 2014 song &quot;End of the Affair&quot; by English singer-songwriter Ben Howard, from his album &quot;I Forget Where We Were&quot;. The book was the inspiration for the 2020 song &quot;The End of the Affair&quot; by Laura Marling on her album &quot;Song for Our Daughter&quot;.

<text>The DISCiPLE is a floppy disk interface for the ZX Spectrum home computer. Designed by Miles Gordon Technology, it was marketed by Rockfort Products and launched in 1986.

Like Sinclair&#x27;s own ZX Interface 1, the DISCiPLE was a wedge-shaped unit fitting underneath the Spectrum. It was designed as a super-interface, providing all the facilities a Spectrum owner could need. In addition to floppy-disk, parallel port printer interface and a &quot;magic button&quot; (see Non-maskable interrupt), it also offered twin joystick ports, Sinclair ZX Net-compatible network ports and an inhibit button for disabling the device.

At the rear of the unit was a pass-through port for connecting further devices, although the complexity of the DISCiPLE meant that many would not work, or only if the DISCiPLE was &quot;turned off&quot; using the inhibit button.

The DISCiPLE was a considerable success but its sophistication (the device included 8kB of ROM) meant that it was expensive and the plastic casing, located beneath the computer itself, was sometimes prone to overheating. These factors led to the development of MGT&#x27;s later +D interface.

The DISCiPLE&#x27;s DOS was named GDOS. MGT&#x27;s later DOSs (&quot;G+DOS&quot; for the +D, and &quot;SAM DOS&quot; for the SAM Coupé) were backwards-compatible with GDOS. In later years a complete new system called UNI-DOS was developed by SD Software for the DISCiPLE and +D interfaces. In October 1993 &quot;The Complete DISCiPLE Disassembly&quot; was published in book form, documenting the &quot;GDOS system 3d&quot; version.

The popularity of the DISCiPLE led to the formation of a user group and magazine, INDUG, which later became Format Publications. Usergroups like INDUG/Format in the UK or DISCiPLE-Nieuwsbrief in the Netherlands produced enhancements such as extended printer support.
