<text>Radek Bonk (born 9 January 1976) is a Czech former professional ice hockey player who most recently played for Oceláři Třinec of the Czech Extraliga.

==Playing career==
Bonk was born in Czechoslovakia and began his hockey career playing for Slezan Opava in the Junior Czech league and Zlín in the Czech Extraliga. He moved to North America in 1993 with a goal of playing in the National Hockey League (NHL) and was signed by the International Hockey League (IHL)&#x27;s Las Vegas Thunder, with whom he spent the 1993–94 season as a 17-year-old because he refused to play for the Owen Sound Platers of the OHL. Bonk was an immediate sensation in the IHL and by the end of his first season of the North American brand of hockey he had registered 42 goals and 45 assists for 87 points in 76 games. NHL scouts took notice, and Bonk found himself at or near the top of all the top prospects lists for the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. Given his young age (17), size, and ability to quickly adapt to the more physical style of hockey in North America, Bonk became a &quot;can&#x27;t miss&quot; prospect.

Bonk was drafted third overall by the Ottawa Senators in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft, the first forward selected. He returned to Las Vegas for the first half of the 1994–95 season while the NHL was shut down by the owners&#x27; lockout and registered 20 points in 33 games. His debut NHL season of 1994–95 was somewhat disappointing, and Bonk scored only 3 goals and 11 points in 42 games. His progress took some seasoning in his first five years of NHL hockey before he emerged as one of the league&#x27;s most complete forwards by 1999–2000. He went on to play for the Senators for 10 seasons, eventually becoming the team’s #1 center under the tutelage of head coach Jacques Martin.

Bonk originally wore number 76 as a member of the Thunder and in his first two seasons in Ottawa, but switched to number 14 after new general manager Pierre Gauthier implemented a team rule prohibiting players from wearing &quot;vanity numbers&quot; (that is, numbers higher than the goaltenders). Thus, teammate Alexandre Daigle also switched to number 9 from his traditional 91.

A skilled player, Bonk was often criticized in the Ottawa media for his lack of aggression, despite his size. On the day of the 2004 NHL Entry Draft, he was traded to the Los Angeles Kings for a third round draft pick. The same day, he was traded to the Montreal Canadiens along with Cristobal Huet for Mathieu Garon and a third round selection in the 2004 draft. His most productive season points-wise was the 2001–02 NHL season when he produced 70 points for the Ottawa Senators.

On 2 July 2007, Bonk signed as a free agent with the Nashville Predators to a two-year contract.

On 22 July 2009, after 969 games in the NHL it was announced that Bonk agreed to a one-year contract with Lokomotiv Yaroslavl to continue his career in the Russian Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). After only seven games into the 2009–10 season, Bonk left Yaroslavl to return the Czech Republic with Oceláři Třinec in the Czech Extraliga on 8 October 2009. Radek posted 17 points in 39 games for the season with Oceláři to earn a two-year contract extension on 2 May 2010.

Bonk announced his retirement on 19 May 2014.

==Personal life==
Bonk is married to a Canadian, Jill Sarcen, whom he met in Ottawa while a member of the Senators. They have sons — Oliver and Cameron, and daughters Kennedy and Maya. He relocated with his family to Ottawa in 2015, where he plays in a recreational men&#x27;s hockey league and coaches a youth hockey team on which one of his daughters plays. His son Oliver, was drafted in the first round, 22nd overall, by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 2023 NHL Entry Draft.

Bonk is an uncle of Patrik Bartošák, who was drafted 146th overall by the Los Angeles Kings in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft.

<doc id="569470" wikidata="Q1112049" url="?curid=569470" title="Hassan Hanafi">
<text>Hassan Hanafi (; 23 February 1935 – 21 October 2021) was a professor and chaired the philosophy department at Cairo University. He was a leading authority on modern Islam. 

As a young man motivated by a revolutionary political activism, Hanafi associated with the Muslim Brotherhood. Later Hanafi studied at the Sorbonne in Paris. From 1967, he was a professor of philosophy in Cairo, as well as a visiting professor at universities in France, the United States, Belgium, Kuwait and Germany. He has been categorized as among &quot;the big names&quot; of the post-1967 Arab intellectual tradition.

==Early life==
Hanafi was born into an artistic family in Cairo, Egypt. In his youth he studied the violin, which he continued to play later in his life.

==Philosophy==
Hanafi was a disciple of the phenomenologist Osman Amin, and published a trilogy in which he used Husserl&#x27;s methods to reconstruct classic Islamic philosophy and to critique the sources and development of European consciousness.

Hanafi&#x27;s interpretation of Islam has been described as socialist and he elaborated on the concept of an &quot;Islamic Left&quot;, interpreting Islam in a socialist manner, or else a &quot;third way.&quot; He promoted an interpretation of Islam supporting the development of a global ethics. In his later works Hanafi argued that Islam needed to be understood in way that facilitates human freedom and progress. As summarized by scholar Mohammed Hashas: &quot;...some of the renowned defenders of socialism for Arab nationhood would become leading scholars of what has come to be known as the &#x27;Islamic left&#x27;, a concept that first appeared in the first issue of the Islamic Left Magazine, 1981, by the philosopher Hassan Hanafi (b. 1935), as part of his project &#x27;the third way&#x27; of reading the tradition and modernity, a way that is neither fully Euro-modern nor fully Islamico-traditionalist; it is implicitly secular-mundane, since it reads the sacred in the light of the sociopolitical needs of people; it is creed revolutionized to be lived (mina-lʻaqīda ilā thawra), as one of the volumes of the project is entitled&quot; (2018, 271). Hanafi acted as an adviser to the InterAction Council, a coalition of 26 former prime ministers and presidents. He was also a member of the Association for Intercultural Philosophy, which encourages a dialogue among philosophers from all over the world. He was one of the original signatories of A Common Word Between Us and You, an open letter by Islamic scholars to Christian leaders, calling for peace and understanding.

Hanafi is also remembered for his published scholarly debates with contemporary philosopher Mohammed Abed al-Jabri.

He won a number of academic awards during his lifetime. 

==Controversy over his apostasy==
Hanafi&#x27;s book &quot;An Invitation for Dialogue&quot; was accused by conservative Islamic scholars as heresy and apostasy.

His liberal opinions about Islam infuriated conservative Islamic scholars and Azhar. For example, he stated that the name of the God should be changed to &quot;Transcendence&quot;. Conservative scholars from al-Azhar refuted that Hanafi was distorting Islam. There was a fatwa, an Islamic opinion issued by Islamic scholars, that condemned Hanafi as an apostate. This raised controversy in Egypt, as many liberals disagreed with the charge that Hanafi was an apostate.

==Legacy==
In an Egyptian magazine he declared that his main disciples in Egypt are Nasr Abu Zayd, Ali Mabrouk, and Kareem Essayyad. 

The scholar Carool Kersten notes that Hanafi&#x27;s intellectual influence extends beyond majority Arabic-speaking countries and includes Indonesia, where among the local intelligentsia, Hanafi represented &quot;a particular brand of Arab intellectuals known as &quot;turāthiyyūn&quot;—‘heritage thinkers’.&quot; 

==Death==
Hannafi died on 21 October 2021, aged 86.

<text>BBC Radio Solent is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving Hampshire, Dorset and the Isle of Wight, broadcasting on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios on Havelock Road in Southampton.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 204,000 listeners and a 4.2% share as of September 2023.

==History==
The station began broadcasting on 31 December 1970. It is named after the Solent, the area of sea between Southampton, Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight.

In 1996, Radio Solent expanded its coverage into West Dorset and South Dorset by taking over neighbouring BBC Dorset FM, which was formerly an opt-out of BBC Radio Devon.

In 2013, a new programme specifically for Dorset listeners on 103.8 FM was launched under the name &quot;Breakfast in Dorset&quot;, after campaigns for a more locally focused service. The programme is presented by Steve Harris from a studio complex in Dorchester and also broadcasts county-wide on DAB.

==Technical==
The service is broadcast on 96.1 FM for Hampshire, the Isle of Wight and eastern Dorset from Rowridge transmitting station on the Isle of Wight; and on 103.8 FM for western Dorset from Bincombe Hill transmitter. Since 2003, the station has also been broadcast on DAB Digital Radio from the NOW South Hampshire and NOW Bournemouth networks from thirteen transmitters between them.

The station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channels 714 (Hampshire / Isle of Wight) and 715 (Dorset) in the BBC South region, and streams online via BBC Sounds. Freeview TV channel 715 (Dorset) is also broadcast in the BBC South West and BBC West regions. 

From launch until 2020, BBC Radio Solent broadcast on medium wave, with the main AM transmitter on 999 kHz from Fareham covering most of the coverage area and a secondary transmitter covering Bournemouth and Poole on 1359 kHz from Fern Barrow, Bournemouth.

===North and north-east Hampshire===
The signal for Hampshire on 96.1 FM from Rowridge on the Isle of Wight is weaker north of Winchester than the transmissions from other BBC Local Radio stations, so that the north Hampshire towns of Basingstoke and Andover are officially served by BBC Radio Berkshire, while towns such as Aldershot, Farnborough and Fleet in the north-east of the county are served by BBC Radio Surrey.

==Programming==
As of 2023, local programming was produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Southampton studios from 6 am to 6 pm each Monday to Friday and for sports coverage. Full speech content is required during the breakfast peak of 7 am to 8.30 am. The station must also provide at least 95 hours of locally-made programming per week, that provides news, information and content relevant to the areas and communities it serves.

On weekdays, the station&#x27;s 6 am to 10 am breakfast show, 10 am to 2 pm morning show and 2 pm to 6 pm afternoon show are broadcast solely to the station&#x27;s broadcast area.

The station&#x27;s Saturday and Sunday afternoon show is occupied by sports coverage under the &quot;BBC Radio Solent Sport&quot; banner. The Saturday evening 8 pm to 10 pm slot is occupied by the BBC Music Introducing programme which features music from new and up and coming artists from the local area. The show helped discover and launch the careers of Wet Leg and has featured artists such as Natives and Echotape.

During the station&#x27;s downtime, BBC Radio Solent simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live between 1 am and 6am

<text>BBC Radio Devon is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the county of Devon.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios in the Mannamead area of Plymouth.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 136,000 listeners and a 4.8% share as of December 2023.

==History==
Until 1983, local radio services for Devon had amounted to a regional weekday breakfast show &quot;Morning Sou&#x27;West&quot;, aired on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s frequencies in Devon and Cornwall, plus five-minute regional bulletins on Saturday mornings and Mondays to Saturdays at lunchtime and teatime. There was no regional output of any kind on Sundays. The regional programming ended on 31 December 1982.

BBC Radio Devon started broadcasting on 17 January 1983, replacing the BBC Radio 4 regional breakfast show &quot;Morning Sou&#x27;West&quot;. On the same day, BBC Radio Cornwall started broadcasting, with whom it shared early afternoon programming, and the BBC began launched the UK&#x27;s first regular breakfast television programme &quot;Breakfast Time&quot;.

When broadcasting started, the new studios in Exeter had not yet been finished, so BBC Radio Devon was broadcast from portable cabins for the first few weeks. The Exeter studios were officially opened by Alastair Milne, then Director-General of the BBC, on 30 September 1983.

The then new Exeter studio centre at Walnut Gardens on St Davids Hill had the latest in BBC broadcasting technology. The studios were made up of Mark III desks, which were built in-house by BBC engineers and first designed in the 1970s.
The studio complex in Exeter consisted of the traditional BBC Local Radio Mark III set up, which saw three studios in a row - two broadcast ‘cubicles’ as they were known, either side of a centre talk-show style studio, which was home to the news programmes Good Morning Devon and Good Evening Devon. The desks were in use from 1983 until August 2015, when the original Exeter studios were closed and relocated to smaller premises on the outskirts of the city at Pynes Hill.

Since 2021, the Exeter studio and office is now located within the Exeter College building on Queen Street.

BBC Radio Devon has reporters based in Exeter, Plymouth, Paignton and Barnstaple and the Plymouth newsroom is shared with the BBC&#x27;s regional TV news programme &quot;Spotlight&quot;. The station has won several Sony Awards for its programming.

==Technical==
Radio Devon is broadcast on the following radio frequencies (transmitter location in brackets):

*FM:
**94.8 MHz in Barnstaple (Huntshaw Cross)
**95.7 MHz in Plymouth (Plympton)
**95.8 MHz in Exeter (St. Thomas)
**96.0 MHz in Okehampton
**103.4 MHz in Devon and East Cornwall (North Hessary Tor)
**104.3 MHz in Torbay, Torquay and the South Hams (Beacon Hill)
*DAB:
**10C in Central and North Devon
**11C in East Devon, Exeter and Torbay
**12D in Plymouth and South Devon

The station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 712 in the BBC South West region and streams online via BBC Sounds.

Radio Devon previously broadcast on 855 kHz in Plymouth; these transmissions ceased in 2007 and the frequency was used for a trial of Digital Radio Mondiale services, though these trials ultimately did not lead to DRM going into permanent service in the UK.

The station was broadcast on 1458 kHz in the Torbay area until the transmitter closed on 15 January 2018.

The station&#x27;s other AM transmissions, 801 kHz in North Devon (Barnstaple) and 990 kHz in Exeter, ceased after the 11 am news bulletin on 3 August 2021. They were originally slated to cease in June 2021, but this was postponed.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Plymouth studios from 6am to 2pm on weekdays and from 6am to 6pm on Saturdays and 6am to 2pm on Sundays. At all other times until 10pm (6pm on Sundays), programming is simulcast with sister stations in the BBC South West and BBC West regions. Each night from 10pm, BBC Radio Devon broadcasts the England-wide late show and from 1am, BBC Radio Devon simulcasts BBC Radio 5 Live

<text>Trinidad () is a town in the province of Sancti Spíritus, central Cuba. Together with the nearby Valle de los Ingenios, it has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1988, because of its historical importance as a center of the sugar trade in the 18th and 19th centuries. Trinidad is one of the best-preserved cities in the Caribbean from the time when the sugar trade was the main industry in the region.

==History==
Trinidad was founded on December 23, 1514, by Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar under the name Villa de la Santísima Trinidad.

Hernán Cortés recruited men for his expedition from Juan de Grijalva&#x27;s home in Trinidad, and Sancti Spíritus, at the start of his 1518 expedition. This included Pedro de Alvarado and his five brothers. After ten days, Cortes sailed, the alcayde Francisco Verdugo failing to prevent Cortes from leaving, despite orders from Diego Velázquez.

The Narvaez Expedition landed at Trinidad in 1527 en route to Florida. Caught in a hurricane, the expedition lost two ships, twenty horses and sixty men to the violent storm.

==Geography==
The town proper is divided into the &quot;barrios&quot; (quarters) of Primero, Segundo and Tercero. The whole municipality counts the &quot;consejos populares&quot; (wards) of Centro, Zona Monumento, Armando Mestre, La Purísima, Casilda, Federación Nacional de Trabajadores Azucareros (FNTA), Condado, Topes de Collante, San Pedro, Manacas - Iznaga, Algarrobo, Pitajones, and Caracusey.

==Economy==
Nowadays, Trinidad&#x27;s main industry is tobacco processing. The older parts of town are well preserved, as the Cuban tourism industry sees benefit from tour groups. In contrast, some parts of town outside the tourist areas are very run down and in disrepair, especially in the centre. Tourism from Western nations is a major source of income in the city.

===Tourism===
The city is located on the Caribbean coast near the Escambray Mountains.

==Culture==
===Town===
;Plaza Mayor

The Plaza Mayor of Trinidad is a plaza and an open-air museum of Spanish Colonial architecture. Only a few square blocks in size, the historic plaza area has cobblestone streets, houses in pastel colors with wrought-iron grilles, and colonial-era edifices such as the &quot;Santísima Trinidad Cathedral&quot; and &quot;Convento de San Francisco&quot;. The Municipal History Museum is in town also.

;Music
There are several &quot;casas de musica&quot;, including one next to the cathedral in Plaza Major. There are also discothèques, including one in the ruins of a church; another is in a large cave formerly used as a war time hospital.

===Region===
;Sugar mills
The Valley of the Sugar Mills—&quot;Valle de los Ingenios&quot;, also a World Heritage Site, has around 70 historic sugar cane mills. They represent the importance of sugar to the Cuban economy since the 18th century.

The valley has &quot;la Torre Iznaga&quot;, a tower built by Alejo Iznaga Borrell in 1816.

;Coasts and beaches
 from the city is Topes de Collantes, one of Cuba&#x27;s premier ecotourism centres. Another attraction is the Casilda Bay, which attracts both snorkelers and divers.

A nearby islet has pristine beaches. Ancón Beach—&quot;Playa Ancón&quot;, is a white sand beach and was one of the first new resorts to be developed in Cuba following the 1959 revolution. Along the Ancón Peninsula are three hotels: Hotel Costa Sur (South Coast Hotel), Hotel Ancón, and Brisas Trinidad del Mar.

==Demographics==
In 2022, the municipality of Trinidad had a population of 76,500. With a total area of , it has a population density of .

<text>BBC Radio Cornwall is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the county of Cornwall.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios at Phoenix Wharf in Truro.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 80,000 listeners and a 10.0% share as of December 2023.

==Overview==
Until 31 December 1982, local radio services for Cornwall had amounted to a regional weekday breakfast show &quot;Morning Sou&#x27;West&quot;, aired on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s frequencies in Devon and Cornwall, plus five-minute regional bulletins on Saturday mornings and Mondays to Saturdays at lunchtime and teatime. There was no regional output on Sundays.

On 17 January 1983, BBC Radio Cornwall (and BBC Radio Devon) launched, although for its first few years on air, both stations shared an afternoon programme.

==Technical==
BBC Radio Cornwall is broadcasts on 95.2 MHz for East Cornwall from the Caradon Hill transmitting station located on Bodmin Moor, 96.0 MHz on the Isles of Scilly and 103.9 MHz from Redruth transmitting station located on Lanner Hill for West Cornwall, as well as on DAB. It was also broadcast on 630 kHz and 657 kHz AM until 2 March 2020, when those transmitters were closed for cost savings.

The station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 713 in the BBC South West region and streams online via BBC Sounds.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Truro studios from 6 am to 10 pm on weekdays, from 6 am to 6 pm on Saturdays and from 6 am to 2 pm on Sundays.

Daniel Pascoe&#x27;s show (Saturdays 6 pm to 8 pm) and his BBC Introducing show (Saturdays 8 pm to 10 pm) are both broadcast to BBC Radio Devon and BBC Radio Somerset.

David White&#x27;s Boogie Wonderland show used to be broadcast on Saturdays between 10 pm to 1 am and was also broadcast to stations in the BBC South West and BBC West regions. This programme, along with all other late night regional programming, ended on 7 October 2023 due to BBC cutbacks, and was replaced with a networked England-wide late show which broadcasts every night of the week.

During the station&#x27;s overnight downtime, BBC Radio Cornwall simulcasts BBC Radio 5 Live 

===Cornish language output===
Radio Cornwall is one of two radio stations to have broadcast programmes in the Cornish language. A five-minute weekly news bulletin, &quot;An Nowodhow&quot;, is broadcast every Sunday at 1.55pm.

When Radio Cornwall was first set up Cornish language content was limited to around 2 minutes per week. In 1987, a new weekly 15-minute-long bilingual show, Kroeder Kroghan, detailing Celtic cultural events taking place in Cornwall, was introduced.

<doc id="569480" wikidata="Q208467" url="?curid=569480" title="Receptor (biochemistry)">
<text>In biochemistry and pharmacology, receptors are chemical structures, composed of protein, that receive and transduce signals that may be integrated into biological systems. These signals are typically chemical messengers which bind to a receptor and produce physiological responses such as change in the electrical activity of a cell. For example, GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, inhibits electrical activity of neurons by binding to GABA receptors. There are three main ways the action of the receptor can be classified: relay of signal, amplification, or integration. Relaying sends the signal onward, amplification increases the effect of a single ligand, and integration allows the signal to be incorporated into another biochemical pathway.

Receptor proteins can be classified by their location. Cell surface receptors, also known as transmembrane receptors, include ligand-gated ion channels, G protein-coupled receptors, and enzyme-linked hormone receptors. Intracellular receptors are those found inside the cell, and include cytoplasmic receptors and nuclear receptors. A molecule that binds to a receptor is called a ligand and can be a protein, peptide (short protein), or another small molecule, such as a neurotransmitter, hormone, pharmaceutical drug, toxin, calcium ion or parts of the outside of a virus or microbe. An endogenously produced substance that binds to a particular receptor is referred to as its endogenous ligand. E.g. the endogenous ligand for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is acetylcholine, but it can also be activated by nicotine and blocked by curare. Receptors of a particular type are linked to specific cellular biochemical pathways that correspond to the signal. While numerous receptors are found in most cells, each receptor will only bind with ligands of a particular structure. This has been analogously compared to how locks will only accept specifically shaped keys. When a ligand binds to a corresponding receptor, it activates or inhibits the receptor&#x27;s associated biochemical pathway, which may also be highly specialised.

Receptor proteins can be also classified by the property of the ligands. Such classifications include chemoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, gravitropic receptors, photoreceptors, magnetoreceptors and gasoreceptors.

== Structure ==

The structures of receptors are very diverse and include the following major categories, among others: 
* Type 1: Ligand-gated ion channels (ionotropic receptors) – These receptors are typically the targets of fast neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine (nicotinic) and GABA; activation of these receptors results in changes in ion movement across a membrane. They have a heteromeric structure in that each subunit consists of the extracellular ligand-binding domain and a transmembrane domain which includes four transmembrane alpha helices. The ligand-binding cavities are located at the interface between the subunits.
* Type 2: G protein-coupled receptors (metabotropic receptors) – This is the largest family of receptors and includes the receptors for several hormones and slow transmitters e.g. dopamine, metabotropic glutamate. They are composed of seven transmembrane alpha helices. The loops connecting the alpha helices form extracellular and intracellular domains. The binding-site for larger peptide ligands is usually located in the extracellular domain whereas the binding site for smaller non-peptide ligands is often located between the seven alpha helices and one extracellular loop. The aforementioned receptors are coupled to different intracellular effector systems via G proteins. G proteins are heterotrimers made up of 3 subunits: α (alpha), β (beta), and γ (gamma). In the inactive state, the three subunits associate together and the α-subunit binds GDP. G protein activation causes a conformational change, which leads to the exchange of GDP for GTP. GTP-binding to the α-subunit causes dissociation of the β- and γ-subunits. Furthermore, the three subunits, α, β, and γ have additional four main classes based on their primary sequence. These include Gs, Gi, Gq and G12.
* Type 3: Kinase-linked and related receptors (see &quot;Receptor tyrosine kinase&quot; and &quot;Enzyme-linked receptor&quot;) – They are composed of an extracellular domain containing the ligand binding site and an intracellular domain, often with enzymatic-function, linked by a single transmembrane alpha helix. The insulin receptor is an example. 
* Type 4: Nuclear receptors – While they are called nuclear receptors, they are actually located in the cytoplasm and migrate to the nucleus after binding with their ligands. They are composed of a C-terminal ligand-binding region, a core DNA-binding domain (DBD) and an N-terminal domain that contains the &quot;AF1&quot;(activation function 1) region. The core region has two zinc fingers that are responsible for recognizing the DNA sequences specific to this receptor. The N terminus interacts with other cellular transcription factors in a ligand-independent manner; and, depending on these interactions, it can modify the binding/activity of the receptor. Steroid and thyroid-hormone receptors are examples of such receptors.

Membrane receptors may be isolated from cell membranes by complex extraction procedures using solvents, detergents, and/or affinity purification.

The structures and actions of receptors may be studied by using biophysical methods such as X-ray crystallography, NMR, circular dichroism, and dual polarisation interferometry. Computer simulations of the dynamic behavior of receptors have been used to gain understanding of their mechanisms of action.

== Binding and activation ==
Ligand binding is an equilibrium process. Ligands bind to receptors and dissociate from them according to the law of mass action in the following equation, for a ligand L and receptor, R. The brackets around chemical species denote their concentrations.

:formula_1

One measure of how well a molecule fits a receptor is its binding affinity, which is inversely related to the dissociation constant &quot;K&quot;&quot;d&quot;. A good fit corresponds with high affinity and low &quot;K&quot;&quot;d&quot;. The final biological response (e.g. second messenger cascade, muscle-contraction), is only achieved after a significant number of receptors are activated.

Affinity is a measure of the tendency of a ligand to bind to its receptor. Efficacy is the measure of the bound ligand to activate its receptor.

=== Agonists versus antagonists ===

Not every ligand that binds to a receptor also activates that receptor. The following classes of ligands exist:

* &quot;(Full) agonists&quot; are able to activate the receptor and result in a strong biological response. The natural endogenous ligand with the greatest efficacy for a given receptor is by definition a full agonist (100% efficacy).
* &quot;Partial agonists&quot; do not activate receptors with maximal efficacy, even with maximal binding, causing partial responses compared to those of full agonists (efficacy between 0 and 100%).
* &quot;Antagonists&quot; bind to receptors but do not activate them. This results in a receptor blockade, inhibiting the binding of agonists and inverse agonists. Receptor antagonists can be competitive (or reversible), and compete with the agonist for the receptor, or they can be irreversible antagonists that form covalent bonds (or extremely high affinity non-covalent bonds) with the receptor and completely block it. The proton pump inhibitor omeprazole is an example of an irreversible antagonist. The effects of irreversible antagonism can only be reversed by synthesis of new receptors. 
* &quot;Inverse agonists&quot; reduce the activity of receptors by inhibiting their constitutive activity (negative efficacy).
* &quot;Allosteric modulators&quot;: They do not bind to the agonist-binding site of the receptor but instead on specific allosteric binding sites, through which they modify the effect of the agonist. For example, benzodiazepines (BZDs) bind to the BZD site on the GABAA receptor and potentiate the effect of endogenous GABA.

Note that the idea of receptor agonism and antagonism only refers to the interaction between receptors and ligands and not to their biological effects.

=== Constitutive activity ===
A receptor which is capable of producing a biological response in the absence of a bound ligand is said to display &quot;constitutive activity&quot;. The constitutive activity of a receptor may be blocked by an inverse agonist. The anti-obesity drugs rimonabant and taranabant are inverse agonists at the cannabinoid CB1 receptor and though they produced significant weight loss, both were withdrawn owing to a high incidence of depression and anxiety, which are believed to relate to the inhibition of the constitutive activity of the cannabinoid receptor.

The GABAA receptor has constitutive activity and conducts some basal current in the absence of an agonist. This allows beta carboline to act as an inverse agonist and reduce the current &quot;below&quot; basal levels.

Mutations in receptors that result in increased constitutive activity underlie some inherited diseases, such as precocious puberty (due to mutations in luteinizing hormone receptors) and hyperthyroidism (due to mutations in thyroid-stimulating hormone receptors).

== Theories of drug-receptor interaction ==

=== Occupation ===

Early forms of the receptor theory of pharmacology stated that a drug&#x27;s effect is directly proportional to the number of receptors that are occupied. Furthermore, a drug effect ceases as a drug-receptor complex dissociates.

Ariëns &amp; Stephenson introduced the terms &quot;affinity&quot; &amp; &quot;efficacy&quot; to describe the action of ligands bound to receptors.

* Affinity: The ability of a drug to combine with a receptor to create a drug-receptor complex.
* Efficacy: The ability of drug to initiate a response after the formation of drug-receptor complex.

=== Rate ===

In contrast to the accepted &quot;Occupation Theory&quot;, Rate Theory proposes that the activation of receptors is directly proportional to the total number of encounters of a drug with its receptors per unit time. Pharmacological activity is directly proportional to the rates of dissociation and association, not the number of receptors occupied:

* Agonist: A drug with a fast association and a fast dissociation.
* Partial-agonist: A drug with an intermediate association and an intermediate dissociation.
* Antagonist: A drug with a fast association &amp; slow dissociation

=== Induced-fit ===

As a drug approaches a receptor, the receptor alters the conformation of its binding site to produce drug—receptor complex.

=== Spare Receptors ===

In some receptor systems (e.g. acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction in smooth muscle), agonists are able to elicit maximal response at very low levels of receptor occupancy (&lt;1%). Thus, that system has spare receptors or a receptor reserve. This arrangement produces an economy of neurotransmitter production and release.

== Receptor regulation ==
Cells can increase (upregulate) or decrease (downregulate) the number of receptors to a given hormone or neurotransmitter to alter their sensitivity to different molecules. This is a locally acting feedback mechanism.

* Change in the receptor conformation such that binding of the agonist does not activate the receptor. This is seen with ion channel receptors.
* Uncoupling of the receptor effector molecules is seen with G protein-coupled receptors.
* Receptor sequestration (internalization), e.g. in the case of hormone receptors.

== Examples and ligands ==

The ligands for receptors are as diverse as their receptors. GPCRs (7TMs) are a particularly vast family, with at least 810 members. There are also LGICs for at least a dozen endogenous ligands, and many more receptors possible through different subunit compositions. Some common examples of ligands and receptors include:

=== Ion channels and G protein coupled receptors ===
Some example ionotropic (LGIC) and metabotropic (specifically, GPCRs) receptors are shown in the table below. The chief neurotransmitters are glutamate and GABA; other neurotransmitters are neuromodulatory. This list is by no means exhaustive.

=== Enzyme linked receptors===
Enzyme linked receptors include Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), serine/threonine-specific protein kinase, as in bone morphogenetic protein and guanylate cyclase, as in atrial natriuretic factor receptor. Of the RTKs, 20 classes have been identified, with 58 different RTKs as members. Some examples are shown below:

=== Intracellular Receptors ===
Receptors may be classed based on their mechanism or on their position in the cell. 4 examples of intracellular LGIC are shown below:

== Role in health and disease==
=== In genetic disorders ===
Many genetic disorders involve hereditary defects in receptor genes. Often, it is hard to determine whether the receptor is nonfunctional or the hormone is produced at decreased level; this gives rise to the &quot;pseudo-hypo-&quot; group of endocrine disorders, where there appears to be a decreased hormonal level while in fact it is the receptor that is not responding sufficiently to the hormone.

=== In the immune system ===

The main receptors in the immune system are pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), toll-like receptors (TLRs), killer activated and killer inhibitor receptors (KARs and KIRs), complement receptors, Fc receptors, B cell receptors and T cell receptors.

<doc id="569484" wikidata="Q159051" url="?curid=569484" title="Alfred Pennyworth">
<text>Alfred Thaddeus Crane Pennyworth, originally Alfred Beagle and commonly known simply as Alfred, is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, most commonly in association with the superhero Batman.

Alfred is depicted as Batman&#x27;s loyal and tireless butler, legal guardian, best friend, aide-de-camp, and surrogate father figure following the murders of his parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne. As a British noble who is a classically trained butler and a retired actor operative of honor and ethics with connections within the intelligence community, he has been called &quot;Batman&#x27;s batman&quot;. He serves as Bruce&#x27;s moral anchor while providing comic relief with his sardonic and cynical attitude; as an amnesiac, he has also served as the supervillainous [[Alfred Pennyworth|Outsider]]. A vital part of the Batman mythos, Alfred was nominated for the &quot;Wizard&quot; Fan Award for Favorite Supporting Male Character in 1994. Bane killed Alfred in 2019 during the &quot;City of Bane&quot; storyline, and he remains dead in the primary continuity of the DC Universe as of 2025.

In non-comics media, the character has been portrayed in live-action and voiced by actors William Austin, Eric Wilton, Michael Gough, Michael Caine, Jeremy Irons, Douglas Hodge, and Andy Serkis on film, and by Alan Napier, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Ian Abercrombie, David McCallum, and Sean Pertwee on television, among others. Ralph Fiennes provided the voice of Alfred in the animated &quot;Lego Movie&quot; franchise, and Martin Jarvis voiced the character in the &quot;&quot; video game series. A young version of Pertwee&#x27;s Alfred, played by Jack Bannon, is depicted before he became the butler to the Wayne family in the television series &quot;Pennyworth&quot;.

==Publication history==
The character first appeared in &quot;Batman&quot; #16 (April 1944), by writer Don Cameron and artist Bob Kane. Evidence suggests that Alfred was created by the writers of the 1943 Batman serial—Victor McLeod, Leslie Swabacker, and Harry Fraser—and that DC Comics asked Don Cameron to write the first Alfred story, which was published prior to the serial&#x27;s release.

==Fictional character biography==
In Alfred&#x27;s first appearance, he was overweight and clean-shaven; however, when the 1943 &quot;Batman&quot; serial was released, William Austin, the actor who played Alfred, was trim and sported a thin moustache. DC editors wanted the comic Alfred to resemble his cinematic counterpart, so in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #83 (January 1944), Alfred vacationed at a health resort, where he slimmed down and grew a mustache. This look has remained with the character ever since, even surviving his apparent &quot;death&quot; and resurrection.
Alfred was originally conceived as a comedic foil for Batman and Robin; he spoke with a Cockney accent, and simply arrived on Wayne Manor&#x27;s doorstep to announce that he was beginning his duties. In most early tales, he made bungling attempts to be a detective on a par with the young masters. He was given a four-page feature of his own, &quot;The Adventures of Alfred&quot;, in &quot;Batman&quot; #22 (April–May 1944) and the feature lasted 13 issues, skipping &quot;Batman&quot; #35, with the last story in &quot;Batman&quot; #36. The stories followed a simple formula, with Alfred solving a crime and catching the culprits entirely by accident. In later years, the comedic aspects of the character were downplayed.

===Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot;===
The Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; comics (the comics that were published by DC Comics between 1938 and 1984) established Alfred as a retired actor and intelligence agent who followed the deathbed wish of his dying father (identified only as &quot;Jarvis&quot;) to carry on the tradition of serving the Wayne family. To that end, Alfred introduced himself to Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson at Wayne Manor and insisted on becoming their butler. Although the pair did not want one, especially since they did not want to jeopardize their secret identities with a servant in the house, they did not have the heart to reject Alfred. (The name &quot;Pennyworth&quot; was first used for Alfred in 1969, and thereafter it has been assumed that his father was named Jarvis Pennyworth; as it is customary for British domestic servants to be called by surname it might have been implied on Alfred&#x27;s introduction that Jarvis was the surname he shared with his father. The surname &quot;Beagle&quot; was explicitly used for Alfred starting in 1945 and on the introduction of &quot;Pennyworth&quot; this is treated as having always been their name by retcon.)

Initially, Alfred discovered their identities by accident; while fighting a burglar in &quot;Batman&quot; #16 (Alfred&#x27;s first appearance), he accidentally hit a switch and opened a sliding panel leading to the Batcave. He is helpful to the duo, following them to a theater where they had been captured, bound, and gagged by a criminal gang, and rescues them after Batman attracts his attention by knocking a rope down before the crooks return. This was revised in &quot;Batman&quot; #110 (September 1957); during his first night at Wayne Manor, Alfred awoke to moaning and followed the sound to the secret passage to the staircase leading to the Batcave and met his would-be employers in their superhero identities with Batman wounded in the field. As it turned out, the wounds were actually insignificant, but Alfred&#x27;s care convinced the residents that their butler could be trusted. Since then, Alfred cheerfully included the support staff duties of the Dynamic Duo on top of his regular tasks.

Ironically, Alfred&#x27;s loyalty would lead him to become a member of Batman&#x27;s rogue&#x27;s gallery: While pushing Batman and Robin out of the way of a falling boulder, Alfred was seemingly killed in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #328 (June 1964). It was revealed in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #356 (October 1966) that he had been revived by a scientist named Brandon Crawford. His attempt at regeneration resulted in a dramatic change: Alfred awoke from his apparent death with pasty white skin with circular markings, superhuman powers, including telekinesis, and a desire to destroy Batman and Robin. Calling himself the Outsider, he indirectly battled the Dynamic Duo on a number of occasions, using others as his puppets—the Grasshopper Gang in &quot;Detective&quot; #334, Zatanna in &quot;Detective&quot; #336, and even the Batmobile itself in &quot;Detective&quot; #340—and generally only appeared as a mocking voice over the radio. He did not physically appear in the comics until &quot;Detective&quot; #356, when he is bathed again in the rays of the regeneration machine during a struggle with Batman, and returns to normal, with no memory of his time as a supervillain. His time as the Outsider is collected in &quot;Showcase Presents: Batman Volume&quot;s &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;.

Alfred was later reunited with his long-lost daughter, Julia Remarque, though this element was not included in Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; comics. Her mother was the war heroine Mademoiselle Marie, whom Alfred had met while working as an intelligence agent in occupied France during World War II.

===Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; and Zero Hour===
In the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; comics continuity, Alfred has been the Wayne family butler all of Bruce&#x27;s life and had helped his master establish his superhero career from the beginning. In addition, he was Bruce&#x27;s legal guardian and father figure following the murder of the boy&#x27;s parents. Alfred&#x27;s history has been modified several times over the years, creating assorted versions. In one such version, Alfred was hired away from the British Royal Family by Bruce&#x27;s parents, and he virtually raised Bruce after they were murdered.

Meanwhile, another version of Alfred&#x27;s Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; life was slightly more closely linked to his Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; counterpart. In this version, Alfred is an actor on the English stage who agrees to become the Waynes&#x27; butler to honor his father&#x27;s dying wish that he continue the &quot;family business&quot; of serving the Waynes, his father having been butler for Bruce&#x27;s grandparents. At the time he begins working for the Waynes, Bruce is a young child. After several months, Alfred voices the desire to quit and return home to continue his life as an actor. However, these plans are momentarily forgotten when young Bruce returns home after getting into a fight with a school bully. Alfred teaches Bruce to outsmart the bully, rather than use brute force. When Alfred&#x27;s advice works, Bruce asks him to stay, and he agrees without a second thought. Shortly afterward, Bruce&#x27;s parents are murdered, and Alfred steps in as the boy&#x27;s legal guardian.

Alfred later helps Bruce raise his adopted wards Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, and Tim Drake, all of whom also become his crimefighting partner, Robin. He also has close friendships with other members of the Batman family, including Barbara Gordon and Cassandra Cain. Alfred often acts as a father figure to Bruce, and a grandfather to Dick, Jason, and Tim. He is also highly respected by Batman&#x27;s fellow superheroes, including Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, and the original Teen Titans.

Alfred has also been romantically linked to Dr. Leslie Thompkins, a Wayne family friend who is also aware of Bruce&#x27;s secret identity. He ends the relationship after she apparently allows Stephanie Brown to die from neglect. He also develops feelings for Tim Drake&#x27;s stepmother, but again, nothing comes of it.

In the &quot;&quot; story arc, Alfred watches helplessly as Batman slowly crumbles under the pressure of fighting every escaped criminal in Arkham Asylum, who were set free by Bane. When Bane breaks Batman&#x27;s back, Alfred tries to treat the injury, but Batman remains paraplegic and a wheelchair user. During the events of &quot;&quot;, Alfred accompanies Bruce to England and becomes enraged when he insists on endangering his own health. This is the culmination of several weeks of Bruce&#x27;s self-destructive behavior, and when Bruce returns to Gotham City, Alfred remains in England, tendering his resignation. He spends some time vacationing in Antarctica and the Bahamas before returning to England. Dick Grayson tracks him down several months later and convinces him to return to Wayne Manor. In that story, it is revealed he had walked out of his own wedding years earlier.

His resourcefulness comes to the fore in the &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; storyline, especially in &quot;&quot; #118. Batman goes missing for weeks, leaving Alfred alone to watch his city for him. He uses his skills as an actor, storyteller, medic, and spy to survive and collect information on the recently destroyed Gotham City. Alfred even uses hand-to-hand combat in a rare one-panel fight sequence between him and a pair of slavers that ends with his rescue by Batman.

In &quot;Batman&quot; #677, agents of Batman&#x27;s mysterious enemy Black Glove attack and beat Alfred in front of Bruce and Jezebel Jet, severely injuring him. In the same issue, a reporter from &quot;The Gotham Gazette&quot; suggests to Commissioner Jim Gordon that Alfred may be Bruce&#x27;s biological father and that this may be a reason for the murder of Bruce&#x27;s mother Martha. Alfred later denies the entire story, agreeing with Bruce that it was a fabrication. 

After the event of &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, when Batman is apparently killed in action, Alfred finds himself with the task of raising Bruce&#x27;s biological son Damian with Grayson. &quot;&quot; sees Alfred allowing Damian to take on his first mission as Robin, giving Damian a Robin tunic and calling on the Squire to assist the new Boy Wonder in finding Tim Drake, who had gone missing while hunting down Jason Todd. Alfred also assists Grayson in his role as Gotham&#x27;s new Dark Knight. 

Alfred is left emotionally shattered by Bruce&#x27;s death, commenting more than once that, even if his biological fatherhood is a fabrication, in a deeper sense he actually was Bruce Wayne&#x27;s father, having watched over him for years and feeling he failed him in the last moments. In the &quot;Batman and the Outsiders Special&quot;, Alfred is seen apologizing at the graves of Thomas and Martha Wayne for Bruce&#x27;s death, commenting that he grieves as a parent, regarding Bruce as his son. Later, a secret panel in Alfred&#x27;s room opens, the result of a fail-safe planted by Bruce in the event of his death. Bruce leaves him one final task and also bids him an emotional goodbye, telling Alfred he considered him as a father.

After discovering that the original Batman was actually lost in time after his battle with Darkseid, Alfred immediately seeks clues to his whereabouts. Eventually, Bruce finds his way to the present. After Batman successfully expands his mission globally with Batman Inc., Bruce assumes full responsibility as a father, and Alfred assists him in raising Damian.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In &quot;The New 52&quot;, it is revealed that Alfred&#x27;s father Jarvis Pennyworth was the butler of the Wayne family before Alfred when Bruce was a child. Jarvis was blackmailed by the Court of Owls to set a trap for the pregnant Martha Wayne. Despite declining, the Court managed to cause a car accident that caused the child to be born prematurely and eventually to have died. Jarvis attempted to resign from his service and write a letter to his son in which he describes the manor as a cursed place, and tells Alfred that he should not begin his service under the Wayne family. However, Jarvis was unable to send the letter as he was murdered that night.

During &quot;&quot;, Alfred is reunited with his long-absent daughter, Julia Pennyworth, an agent of the Special Reconnaissance Regiment, when Batman finds her in Hong Kong and takes her back to Wayne Manor for medical treatment after she is stabbed with a samurai sword through the chest by a Chinese gang boss she was hunting. Julia is initially hostile to Alfred, feeling that he has wasted his life going from a soldier to tending to a &quot;fop&quot; like Bruce Wayne. However, after Alfred is attacked by Hush and infected with a fear toxin, she discovers the Batcave and takes on her father&#x27;s role to coordinate the Bat-Family&#x27;s efforts against their foes. Alfred is briefly transferred to Arkham Asylum before it is attacked as part of the conspiracy, but he manages to survive the explosion and trick Bane into helping him reach an emergency cave Batman had installed under Arkham, the cave&#x27;s defenses knocking Bane out and allowing Alfred to call for help.

When Hush was briefly kept prisoner in the Batcave, he managed to break out of his cell and lock Alfred in it before sabotaging the Batman Family&#x27;s equipment via the Batcomputer as they fought various villains, including crashing the Batwing with Batman still in it. However, he was swiftly returned to captivity when Alfred escaped the cell and knocked Hush out, Alfred harshly informing Tommy that he was hardly going to be locked up in his own home.

During the &quot;&quot; arc, the Joker broke into the Batcave, and during a confrontation with Alfred, cut off Alfred&#x27;s right hand. Julia confirms to Bruce later in the issue that Alfred survived the encounter and is in a stable condition. Following the death of Bruce Wayne, Julia says that with current medical technology, they can have Alfred&#x27;s hand reattached without any complications. However Alfred refuses, stating that with Bruce dead, he no longer has need of it as he has no one left to serve.

Even with the loss of Bruce as Batman, Alfred still assists the Batman Family in the Batcave along with Julia. After Bruce is discovered to be alive but with no memory of who he is or of his life as Batman, Alfred tells Bruce everything that had happened in his life up to the point of the creation of Batman, but accepts Bruce&#x27;s request not to learn any more. Alfred did this so that, after years of service to the people of Gotham and the world, Bruce could finally accept his reward of a life without pain and the burning desire to be Batman, allowing his life as Bruce Wayne to finally begin. However, when the new villain Mr. Bloom launches a mass attack that apparently kills Jim Gordon—the new Batman—the amnesic Bruce pieces together enough information to deduce that he was once Batman, and convinces Alfred to subject him to a machine that will theoretically download all of his memories as Batman into his mind.

Bruce&#x27;s original plan was for the machine to be used to create a series of clones of himself that could be programmed to continue his mission, but although the process failed because simulations confirmed that the human mind could not handle Batman&#x27;s trauma, Bruce comes through the process by having Alfred take him to the point of brain-death and then download his memories onto his blank brain. With his master restored, Alfred&#x27;s hand is subsequently reattached, Bruce joking that they used a random hand from the reserves rather than keeping Alfred&#x27;s hand on ice all this time.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===

Following the 2016 &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; continuity reboot, Alfred appears in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; and the third volume of &quot;Batman&quot;, as well as in &quot;All-Star Batman&quot;. In the latter, Alfred is among the many Gotham citizens blackmailed by Two-Face into stopping Batman from providing Two-Face&#x27;s former self, Harvey Dent, a cure for his split personality; Alfred in particular reluctantly shoots down the Batwing as Batman is flying it. When asked, Alfred reveals his secret; years earlier, he had hired a hitman to kill the Joker after the villain murdered Jason Todd and disabled Barbara Gordon. Alfred soon cancelled the hit, however, after realizing that committing cold-blooded murder would betray Batman&#x27;s ideals.

In Batman #77 (part of the &quot;City of Bane&quot; storyline), an evil version of Thomas Wayne from an alternate dimension invades Gotham City and defeats Batman, and uses Alfred as a hostage to keep the rest of the Bat-Family out. At Thomas&#x27; behest, Bane breaks Alfred&#x27;s neck, killing him after Robin sneaks into Gotham City to rescue him and defeat Bane. When Bruce comes back to Gotham, he is captured and shown Alfred&#x27;s body, but a recorded message reveals that he arranged for his own death so that Bruce could come back and stop Thomas, the message reaffirming Alfred&#x27;s faith in Bruce as the true Batman. In &quot;Nightwing&quot; #78, Barbara visits Dick Grayson and reveals that Alfred was a billionaire, due to stock from Wayne Industries after Alfred became Bruce&#x27;s legal guardian. Barbara then tells Dick that Alfred has left his fortune to Dick in his will.

As part of Joker&#x27;s mass assault on Gotham, he managed to temporarily reanimate Alfred&#x27;s corpse to taunt Batman, but a hallucination of Alfred Batman was experiencing due to exposure to a new form of Joker toxin reminded Bruce that this body wasn&#x27;t him. 

When the demon Nezha used Damian Wayne to attack Lazarus Island, he reanimated Alfred&#x27;s corpse to spy on Batman, using a portion of Alfred&#x27;s real soul to make the impersonation convincing. However, Batman soon realised that this version of Alfred wasn&#x27;t his true self, keeping &quot;Alfred&quot; in play so that he could feed Nezha false information. When &quot;Alfred&quot; is killed as Batman uses him as a body shield against an attack by a possessed Nightwing, enough of Alfred&#x27;s real self manifests to assure Batman that he didn&#x27;t kill Alfred again as he wasn&#x27;t actually alive now anyway.

After Penguin&#x27;s faked death activated Failsafe, a robot created by the Batman of Zur-En-Arh personality to go after Batman if he broke his rule, it was revealed that Failsafe could only be deactivated if Alfred confirmed that Batman had not crossed the line, but there was no protocol in place for what might happen if Alfred died before Failsafe was activated.

==Characterization==
===Name===
In 1945, Alfred&#x27;s name was given officially as Alfred Beagle. This name was subsequently given to an alternative version of the character from the world of Earth-Two, and Pennyworth became Alfred&#x27;s accepted surname in the mainstream continuity. Alfred has also used the alias &quot;Thaddeus Crane&quot;, which is derived from his middle names. His full name of Alfred Thaddeus Crane Pennyworth was depicted on his tombstone in &quot;Superman/Batman: Generations&quot;. Grant Morrison&#x27;s run has referred to the Beagle surname as a possible stage name.

===Family===
* Jarvis Pennyworth: Alfred&#x27;s father in both Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; and &quot;New 52&quot; continuity. In the TV series, &quot;Pennyworth&quot; he is named Arthur instead.
* Mary Pennyworth: Alfred&#x27;s mother in the TV series, &quot;Pennyworth&quot;.
* Wilfred Pennyworth: Alfred&#x27;s brother, Wilfred is referenced in the late 1960s and early 1970s and is mentioned in the 1997 film &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;.
* Daphne Pennyworth: Alfred Pennyworth&#x27;s niece, daughter of Wilfred Pennyworth, Daphne briefly appeared in the late 1960s/early 1970s.
* Mademoiselle Marie: A war heroine with whom Alfred (while working as an intelligence agent in France) has a daughter in Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity.
* Julia Remarque: Alfred&#x27;s daughter by Mademoiselle Marie. Appears as Julia Pennyworth in &quot;New 52&quot; continuity as well as on &quot;Batwoman&quot;.
* Margaret Wilson née Pennyworth: Alfred and Wilfred Pennyworth&#x27;s sister in the 1997 film &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;.
* Barbara Wilson: Alfred&#x27;s niece, daughter of Margaret Wilson née Pennyworth in the 1997 film &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;. In traditional comics, her name is Barbara Gordon and is the daughter of James Gordon, with no relation to Alfred other than her place as Batgirl.
* Theobald: Alfred&#x27;s second cousin in Earth-One continuity.

===Skills, resources, and abilities===
A highly intelligent and resourceful man, Alfred runs the day-to-day operations of Wayne Manor and maintains much of the equipment of the Batcave beneath it. A former actor, he can use his acting and disguise skills to help Batman in the field when necessary, and is even capable of impersonating Bruce Wayne on the telephone convincingly, as well as giving Bruce various lessons that help him maintain his covers. He has also provided first aid up to and including suturing wounds and removing bullets, as well as occasional tactical support. He is also able to perform arthroscopy and other advanced medical procedures, thus limiting, if not eliminating, the need for hospital medical treatment even in the face of grievous injuries, helping to maintain Batman&#x27;s secret identity by ensuring that Bruce Wayne has no need to visit hospitals for wounds inflicted on Batman. Nevertheless, Batman still requires professional medical treatment when Bane breaks his back (&quot;&quot;) and Hush&#x27;s machinations result in him sustaining a skull fracture (&quot;&quot;). On these occasions, Alfred admits that his own skills are inadequate for such medical procedures.

While not as skilled at martial arts as Bruce Wayne, Alfred is still nearly as resourceful. In one story in which he is kidnapped, he readily escapes and overcomes his captors without disturbing the cut of his suit. It was later mentioned that he had been kidnapped unsuccessfully 380 times (these events take place in the &quot;Gotham Adventures&quot; comics, based on the animated adventures of Batman, and not within the standard DCU continuity). During &quot;&quot;, Ubu, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s musclebound bodyguard, attempts to use Alfred as a hostage, only to be disabled by a well timed sucker punch from Alfred.

Presumably due to his lack of superpowers, the advanced combat training Bruce&#x27;s other associates have, and Alfred&#x27;s age, Alfred is the only member of the &quot;Batman Family&quot; that Bruce does not mind using a firearm, in his case favoring a shotgun when dealing with direct attacks on his person.

Current issues of the various &quot;Batman&quot; comics seem to indicate that Alfred is a pioneer in and has also mastered several fields of rose breeding (even creating his own, the &quot;Pennyworth Blue&quot;), computer programming, electrical engineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, nanotechnology, and biotechnology as he singlehandedly builds, programs, and maintains much of Batman&#x27;s next-generational technology such as the Batcomputer.

==Other versions==
===All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder===

In Frank Miller and Jim Lee&#x27;s &quot;All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder&quot;, Alfred is a tougher individual with a different backstory. Following Batman&#x27;s assault on the corrupt Gotham City police, Alfred and Vicki Vale are caught in the devastating car wreckage Batman creates (not aware of their presence) and Vale is badly hurt. Alfred is seen, shirtless and muscled, applying a tourniquet and generally taking control of the situation. He is described as having been a Royal Air Force combat medic and as ex-British Secret Service.

===Batman: The Dark Knight Returns===

In &quot;Batman: The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, an elderly Alfred still acts as Bruce&#x27;s butler, mourning Bruce&#x27;s diminished social contacts while continuing to loyally serve his master even after Bruce becomes Batman once again after a ten-year retirement. At the story&#x27;s conclusion, having set Wayne Manor to self-destruct to protect Bruce Wayne&#x27;s full secrets after his faked death during his fight with Superman, Alfred dies of a stroke, his last thoughts being to consider how utterly proper it is that he should die as Wayne Manor ceases to exist.

In the sequel, &quot;&quot;, the Batcave computer has been programmed with an artificial intelligence named and apparently patterned after Alfred, to the point that it refers to Bruce as &quot;Sir&quot;.

===DCeased===
In &quot;DCeased&quot;, Alfred became the newest host for The Spectre as he was the last survivor of the Bat Family after a plague claimed most of the heroes. The Spectre himself was defeated in battle with Mxyzptlk and Corrigan was killed, thus possessing a rage-filled Alfred to battle the corrupted New Gods.

===Earth One===

Alfred appears as a main character in Geoff Johns&#x27; and Gary Frank&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. This version is a former member of the Royal Marines who lost his right leg while saving Thomas Wayne during a battle in the Middle East and was given a prosthetic replacement by him.

===Elseworlds===
* Alfred appears in the &quot;Elseworlds&quot; series &quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations&quot;. He serves the Wayne family before dying in 1967, but his spirit remains around to give Bruce advice, although Bruce admits he&#x27;s unsure if this is actually Alfred&#x27;s ghost or just Bruce hallucinating. In &quot;Generations 2&quot;, he makes his final appearance in 1975, when he convinces the ghost of Dick Grayson not to kill the Joker; Joker had killed Grayson while he was acting as Batman in 1969, but the public were told that Joker only killed Robin as Dick&#x27;s Robin Bruce Junior (Bruce Wayne&#x27;s son) switched costumes with his mentor. Grayson&#x27;s enraged ghost sought revenge, but Alfred managed to convince Dick to pass over, affirming that the Joker was an old man in no state to harm anyone but killing him would cross the line and compromise Batman&#x27;s dedication to justice. However, when Grayson crosses over, Alfred&#x27;s own soul does so as well, meaning he cannot come back to see Bruce and the others any more.
* In &quot;&quot;, Alfred is reimagined as the hunchbacked Alfredo, the &quot;Igor&quot; to Doctor Bruce Wayne, whose experiments see him reviving his father&#x27;s brain in the body of the giant &quot;Bat-Man&quot;. In keeping with his role as &quot;Igor&quot;, Alfredo is often forced to bear the brunt of his master&#x27;s frustrations with the situation as the revived Thomas Wayne escapes to stalk highwaymen as the monstrous &quot;Bat-Man&quot;.
* In &quot;Batman/Demon: A Tragedy&quot;, Alfred Pennyworth is the alter ego of Merlin, who bound Bruce Wayne to Etrigan centuries prior and chose to serve him to make up for his actions.
* In &quot;Batman: Dark Allegiances&quot;, Alfred is still Bruce Wayne&#x27;s butler as Bruce faces various fascist-themed versions of his rogues gallery, but after the government asks Bruce to become an official American agent during World War II, Alfred joins Bruce and Selina Kyle in the field as the new Robin. 
* In &quot;&quot;, in a timeline where Thomas and Martha Wayne were not killed in Crime Alley, Alfred assists the adult Bruce in investigating his parents&#x27; deaths when they apparently fall out of their penthouse (revealed to have been done due to the influence of Vandal Savage&#x27;s henchwoman the Scarecrone when the Waynes threatened his plan to acquire the meteor that gave him his immortality). While studying available information on the meteor, Alfred discovers a record of the unusual energy reading it emits, but triggers a booby-trap that destroys Wayne Manor and kills him. Five centuries later, Bruce&#x27;s descendant Brenda Wayne discovers a fragmented recording of Alfred and the energy reading that assists her in her own investigations into Savage&#x27;s activities.
* In &quot;League of Justice&quot;, where the Justice League exists in a world where magic is prominent, Alfred is reinvented as a zombie-like figure, reinforcing Bruce&#x27;s idea that science is more reliable than magic despite its greater potential power.
* Alfred plays a prominent role in the &quot;Vampire Batman&quot; trilogy, in which Batman is turned into a vampire to fight Count Dracula, forging Batman&#x27;s weapons to use against the remaining members of Dracula&#x27;s &quot;family&quot; and subsequently working with Commissioner Gordon after Batman succumbs to his vampiric instincts and begins to kill his old enemies. At the conclusion of the trilogy, with Gordon being hunted by Two-Face and Killer Croc in the remains of the Batcave, Alfred sacrifices his life to allow the currently weakened Batman to drink his blood, giving his old master the strength to save Gordon and the people of Gotham one last time before he allows himself to die to end the threat that he has become.

===Earth-3===

An alternate universe version of Alfred Pennyworth from Earth-3 who is the leader of the Secret Society appears in the &quot;Trinity War&quot; event.

===Tangent Comics===
Alfred makes a brief appearance in the 1997 Tangent Comics one-shot issue &quot;Green Lantern&quot; in a story revolving around the Tangent versions of King Faraday and Roy Raymond. In this version, Alfred Pennyworth is the head of a publishing empire that owned &quot;the House Of Mystery&quot;.

===Batman: The Murder Machine===
In an alternate reality depicted in the &quot;Metals&quot; crossover, Alfred is killed by Bane, prompting Bruce to request Cyborg&#x27;s help in completing &#x27;the Alfred Protocol&#x27;, an artificial intelligence version of Alfred, created to allow Batman to keep some aspect of his &#x27;father&#x27; with him. Once the Alfred Protocol is completed, its fixation on protecting its &#x27;son&#x27; results in the A.I. version of Alfred murdering all of Batman&#x27;s rogues gallery before merging with Bruce.

===The Batman Who Laughs===
The Batman Who Laughs – a monstrous version of Batman contaminated by the same chemicals that drove the Joker insane – claims that Alfred is the only member of his old family he left alive back on his world. The villain claims that he drove his own version of Alfred insane by implying that his original self is still &quot;alive&quot; within him until Alfred chose to serve the Batman Who Laughs on his own, but the &quot;prime&quot; Alfred denies that any version of him could do this.

===Nightwing: The New Order===
In this alternate reality, Nightwing ends an ongoing feud between superpowered beings by activating a device that de-powers 90 percent of the super powered population. This builds to a future where superpowers are outlawed and any superpowered being must take inhibitor medications or be imprisoned. When Bruce is killed during the feud, Alfred inherits his estate and moves to Arizona, while allowing Dick Grayson and his son Jake to stay in Wayne Manor. Though Alfred does not approve of Grayson&#x27;s crusade against superhumans after Bruce&#x27;s death, he still occasionally visits him. When Grayson discovered that Jake is beginning to develop powers, his house is invaded by his own police force, the Crusaders, to take Jake away. Alfred attempts to strike one of the Crusaders, who kills him.

<text>BBC Radio Guernsey is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the Bailiwick of Guernsey.

It broadcasts on FM, AM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios on Bulwer Avenue in St Sampson.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 12,000 listeners and a 10.2% share as of December 2023.

==Overview==

BBC Radio Guernsey has grown from a small part-time radio operation in the early 1980s into a full tri-media broadcaster, providing locally produced radio, online and TV services. Each week, the station broadcasts 40 hours of local programming ranging from news and current affairs to music and conversation.

Like other BBC enterprises in Guernsey, funding comes primarily from television licence fees collected in Guernsey itself.

In recent years, local output has been reduced to eight hours on weekdays, coinciding with an increase in regional programming shared with sister station BBC Radio Jersey.

In addition to its FM and AM frequencies, the station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 713 and streams online via BBC Sounds. Transmissions on DAB began on 1 August 2021 with the launch of the Channel Islands DAB multiplex, on which BBC Radio Jersey also broadcasts, alongside &quot;BBC Radio Guernsey Xtra&quot;, a part-time stream carrying the station&#x27;s AM opt-out content (chiefly parliamentary coverage), and a similar opt-out for Radio Jersey. The stations are the first BBC stations to use the DAB+ standard – at the time of launch, all stations on the BBC National DAB multiplex, and all other BBC Local Radio stations on the UK mainland, used the earlier DAB format.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Saint Sampson studios from 6 am to 2 pm on weekdays.

Regional programming for the Channel Islands, shared with BBC Radio Jersey, airs from:
2pm to 10pm on Mondays/Fridays, 
2pm to 6pm on Tuesdays/Wednesdays,
2pm to 8pm on Thursdays,
6am to 8pm on Saturdays and
6am to 6pm on Sundays.
Off-peak programming originates from BBC Radio Cornwall in Truro, BBC Radio Manchester and BBC Radio London.

During the station&#x27;s downtime, BBC Radio Guernsey simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live.

<text>BBC Radio Jersey is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the Bailiwick of Jersey.

It broadcasts on FM, AM, DAB+, Freeview and via BBC Sounds from studios on Parade Road in St Helier.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 21,000 listeners and a 12.9% share as of December 2023.

==Overview==

The station first aired on 15 March 1982, when it was opened by George Howard, the then chairman of the BBC. The first voice to be heard was that of Peter Gore who was one of the four-person start-up team headed by Mike Warr. It launched from Broadcasting House, just off Rouge Bouillon in St Helier, and moved to its present premises in Parade Road in March 1994.

Roger Bara, a long-standing breakfast show presenter, retired in 2012.

In recent years, local output has been reduced to eight hours on weekdays, coinciding with an increase in regional programming shared with sister station BBC Radio Guernsey.

Like other BBC enterprises in Jersey, funding comes primarily from television licence fees collected in Jersey.

In addition to its FM and AM frequencies, the station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 711 and streams online via BBC Sounds. Transmissions on DAB began on 1 August 2021 with the launch of the Channel Islands DAB multiplex, on which BBC Radio Guernsey also broadcasts, alongside &quot;BBC Radio Jersey Xtra&quot;, a part-time stream carrying the station&#x27;s AM opt-out content (chiefly parliamentary coverage), and a similar opt-out for Radio Guernsey. The stations are the first BBC stations to use the DAB+ standard - at the time of launch, all stations on the BBC National DAB multiplex, and all other BBC Local Radio stations on the UK mainland, used the earlier DAB format.

==Location==
The radio station shares premises at 18–21 Parade Road in St Helier with BBC Channel Islands television news, and BBC Jersey&#x27;s online services.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s St Helier studios from 6 am to 2 pm on weekdays.

Regional programming for the Channel Islands, shared with BBC Radio Guernsey, airs from 2 pm to 10 pm on Mondays/Fridays, from 2pm-6pm Tuesdays/Wednesdays, 2pm to 8pm on Thursdays, also from 6 am to 8 pm on Saturdays and from 6 am to 6 pm on Sundays.

Off-peak programming originates from BBC Radio Cornwall in Truro, BBC Radio Manchester and BBC Radio London 

During the station&#x27;s downtime, BBC Radio Jersey simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live and until recently, the station&#x27;s AM frequencies used to simulcast Radio 5 Live on weekday evenings to provide better coverage of the station on AM during the hours of darkness.

<doc id="569500" wikidata="Q7139410" url="?curid=569500" title="Parole board">
<text>A parole board is a panel of people who decide whether an offender should be released from prison on parole after serving at least a minimum portion of their sentence as prescribed by the sentencing judge. Parole boards are used in many jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, the United States, and New Zealand. A related concept is the board of pardons and paroles, which may deal with pardons and commutations as well as paroles.

A parole board consists of people qualified to make judgements about the suitability of a prisoner for return to free society. Members may be judges, psychiatrists, or criminologists, although some jurisdictions do not have written qualifications for parole board members and allow community members to serve as them. A universal requirement is that board candidates be of good moral fiber.

==Canada==
== New Zealand ==
==United Kingdom ==
In the United Kingdom parole board members are also drawn from a wider circle of professions. The boards typically make a judgement about whether a prisoner will affect public safety if released, but do not form an opinion about whether the initial sentencing was appropriate. The boards are non-departmental public bodies respectively of the UK government (Parole Board for England and Wales), the Scottish Government (Parole Board for Scotland), and the Northern Ireland Executive (Parole Commissioners for Northern Ireland).

==United States==

There are 52 parole boards in operation in the United States. Some states require all members to possess a four year degree, while others do not. Additionally, some states require at least one member to be an ex-convict, and some require corrections experience, but there are no nation-wide parole board qualifications. Each state has a different requirement for parole board appointment.

On the federal level, there is no longer parole except for certain military and foreign crimes. The United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines (enacted in 1987) discontinued parole for those convicted of federal crimes for offenses committed after November 1, 1987. Instead of parole the legislation provided that judges may specify as part of sentencing, a period of supervised release to be served after the prison sentence. Prisoners may also receive time off their sentences for &quot;good behavior&quot;. However, this truth in sentencing legislation also requires federal prisoners to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences. The United States Parole Commission remains the parole board for those who committed a federal offense before November 1, 1987, as well as those who committed a District of Columbia Code offense before August 5, 2000, a Uniform Code of Military Justice offense and are parole-eligible, and persons who are serving prison terms imposed by foreign countries and have been transferred to the United States to serve their sentence.

Every U.S. state also has a parole board. The autonomy of the board from the state governor also varies; in some states the boards are more powerful than in others. In some states the board is an independent agency while in others it is a body of the department of corrections. In 44 states, the parole members are chosen by the governor. Parole boards throughout the states often act on the governor&#x27;s influence and reportedly feel the need to do so to ensure job security. However, fourteen states have eliminated or severely restricted access to parole, turning instead to &quot;determinate sentencing&quot; which specifies the exact length of sentence, subject still, in most cases, to time off the sentence for good behaviour.

Nine states in the United States have boards of pardons and paroles that exclusively grants all state pardons. Alabama (Board of Pardons and Paroles), Arizona (Board of Executive Clemency) Connecticut (Board of Pardons and Paroles), Georgia (Board of Pardons and Paroles), Idaho (Commission of Pardons and Paroles), Minnesota (Board of Pardons), Nebraska (Board of Pardons), Nevada (Board of Pardon commissioners, South Carolina (Board of Probation, Parole and Pardon), and Utah (Board of Pardons and Paroles) are the states in the United States with such boards. (Arizona&#x27;s Board of Executive Clemency conducts parole hearings only for inmates who have committed offenses prior to January 1994, parole having been abolished by statute in 1993).

Mississippi&#x27;s state constitution includes a unique provision that any inmate seeking a pardon from that state&#x27;s governor must, at least thirty days before making the request, publish a legal notice of their request for a pardon in a newspaper located in or near the county where the inmate seeking the pardon was convicted and sentenced. In addition Mississippi courts have held that a pardon when given does not erase the criminal record.

Determinate sentencing has also severely reduced the power of many parole boards. Often, consideration of the opinion of the victim or victims or their family is taken into account in the board&#x27;s final determination (see victims&#x27; rights). Compared to the states still using indeterminate sentencing and relying more heavily on parole, those using determinate sentencing contributed less to the higher incarceration rates from 1980-2009.

Parole boards have often been looked at as a contributor towards mass incarceration and as an area needing great reform. Significant research has not yet been made into the interconnection of parole and other sectors such as media and politics, but many call for a separation between the sectors and a sweeping de-politicization of the appointment process. Additionally, many have looked towards increasing qualifications for parole board members to be comparable with those of judges. Alongside the heightening of standards, a general call of an increase in comprehensive training, transparency, and accountability of parole boards has been widely called for, as many current parole board members have never set foot in a prison, and an increase of training often results in a rise of fair and just hearings.

<text>Andre Brandon deWilde (April 9, 1942 – July 6, 1972) was an American theater, film, and television actor. Born into a theatrical family in Brooklyn, he debuted on Broadway at the age of seven and became a national phenomenon by the time he completed his 492 performances for &quot;The Member of the Wedding&quot;. He won a Donaldson Award for his performance, becoming the youngest actor to win one, and starred in the subsequent film adaptation for which he won a Golden Globe Award.

DeWilde is best known for his performance as Joey Starrett in the film &quot;Shane&quot; (1953) for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He also starred in his own sitcom &quot;Jamie&quot; on ABC and became a household name making numerous radio and TV appearances before being featured on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine on March 10, 1952, for his second Broadway outing, &quot;Mrs. McThing&quot;.

He continued acting in stage, film and television roles into adulthood before his death at age 30 in a car crash in Colorado on July 6, 1972.

==Early life==
Andre Brandon deWilde was the son of Frederic A. &quot;Fritz&quot; deWilde and Eugenia (née Wilson) deWilde. Fritz deWilde was the only son of Dutch immigrants, who changed their surname from Neitzel-de Wilde to deWilde when they emigrated to the United States. He was a descendant of the Dutch merchant and seigneur Andries de Wilde, who was married to Cornelia Henrica Neitzel.
Fritz deWilde became an actor and Broadway production stage manager. Eugenia was a part-time stage actress.

After deWilde&#x27;s birth, the family moved from Brooklyn to Baldwin, Long Island.

==Career==

===Acting===
DeWilde made his much-acclaimed Broadway debut at the age of seven in &quot;The Member of the Wedding&quot;. He was the first child actor to win the Donaldson Award, and his talent was praised by John Gielgud the following year. He also starred in the 1952 film version of the play, which was directed by Fred Zinnemann.

In 1952, he acted in &quot;Shane&quot; as Joey Starrett and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance, becoming the youngest nominee at the time in a competitive category. He starred in his own television series, &quot;Jamie,&quot; which aired in 1953 and 1954. Although the series was popular, it was canceled because of a contract dispute. In 1956, he was featured with Walter Brennan, Phil Harris and Sidney Poitier in the coming-of-age Batjac film production of &quot;Good-bye, My Lady&quot;, adapted from James Street&#x27;s book.

DeWilde&#x27;s soft-spoken manner of speech in his early roles was more akin to a Southern drawl. In 1956, at the age of 14, deWilde narrated the classical music works &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; by Sergei Prokofiev and &quot;The Young Person&#x27;s Guide to the Orchestra&quot; by Benjamin Britten. He also recorded a reading of Huckleberry Finn on the album &quot;The Stories of Mark Twain&quot; along with his &quot;Good-bye, My Lady&quot; costar Brennan.

DeWilde shared an onscreen camaraderie with both James Stewart and Audie Murphy in the 1957 Western &quot;Night Passage&quot;. In 1958, deWilde starred in &quot;The Missouri Traveler&quot;, sharing lead billing with Lee Marvin in another coming-of-age film, this one set in the early 1900s. At the age of 17, he played an adolescent father in the 1959 drama &quot;Blue Denim&quot;. He guest-starred on many TV series, including &quot;Alcoa Theatre&quot; and the popular Western series &quot;Wagon Train&quot;.
In 1961, deWilde appeared in the &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; episode &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; as Hugo, a mentally impaired youth who cannot separate fact from fantasy. After seeing a magician saw a woman in half at a carnival, Hugo emulates the trick and kills a woman by sawing her in half. The episode never aired on NBC because the finale was deemed too gruesome by 1960s television standards.

The following year, deWilde appeared in &quot;All Fall Down&quot;, opposite Warren Beatty and Eva Marie Saint, and in Martin Ritt&#x27;s &quot;Hud&quot; (1963), co-starring with Paul Newman, Patricia Neal and Melvyn Douglas. Although the only lead actor not to be Oscar-nominated for &quot;Hud&quot;, deWilde accepted the Best Supporting Actor trophy on behalf of costar Melvyn Douglas (who was in Spain at the time). That same year, he appeared in Jack Palance&#x27;s ABC circus drama &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;.

DeWilde signed a two-picture deal with Disney in 1964. He first starred in &quot;The Tenderfoot&quot;, a three-part comedy Western for Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Wonderful World of Color&quot; TV show with Brian Keith. The following year, he and Keith starred in &quot;Those Calloways&quot;, reuniting deWilde with his &quot;Good-bye, My Lady&quot; star Walter Brennan. Also in 1965, deWilde played PT boat officer Jere Torry, serving under his admiral father played by John Wayne, in the Pacific theater World War II drama &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot; (1965).
After 1965, many of his roles were limited to television guest appearances. &quot;Being small for his age and a bit too pretty ... in his favour as a child ... worked against him as an adult,&quot; wrote author Linda Ashcroft after talking with deWilde at a party, &quot;He spoke of giving up movies until he could come back as a forty-year-old character actor.&quot; DeWilde&#x27;s final western role was in Dino De Laurentiis&#x27; 1971 Spaghetti Western &quot;The Deserter&quot;, one year before his death. He made his last screen appearance in &quot;Wild in the Sky&quot; (1972).

===Music===
DeWilde had hoped to embark on a music career. He asked his friend Gram Parsons (later of the Byrds and founder of the seminal country rock band the Flying Burrito Brothers) and his International Submarine Band to back him in a recording session. ISB guitarist John Nuese claimed that deWilde sang harmony with Parsons better than anyone except Emmylou Harris. Bassist Ian Dunlop wrote, &quot;The lure of getting a record out was tugging hard at Brandon.&quot;

Parsons and Harris later co-wrote a song titled &quot;In My Hour of Darkness&quot;, the first verse of which refers to the car crash that killed deWilde.

==Personal life==
DeWilde was married twice and had one son. His first marriage was to writer Susan M. Maw, whom he wed in 1963. The couple had a son, Jesse, before divorcing in 1969. He married Janice Gero in April 1972, three months before his death.

==Death==
On July 6, 1972, while in Colorado for a Denver stage production of &quot;Butterflies Are Free,&quot; at the Elitch Theatre, deWilde was killed in a traffic accident in the Denver suburb of Lakewood. He was driving in a camper van that left the roadway before striking a guardrail and a parked truck. The van rolled onto its side, and he was pinned in the wreckage. He was taken to St. Anthony Hospital, where he died at 7:20 p.m. of multiple injuries that included a broken back, neck and leg. He was 30 years old.

DeWilde was originally buried in Hollywood, but his parents later moved his remains to Pinelawn Memorial Park in Farmingdale, New York, to be closer to their home on Long Island.

<text>Cormelles-le-Royal () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France.

== History ==
The territory of La Guérinière was formerly part of Cormelles, the northern limit of the town following the road to the oxen between the Falaise road and the path of Sente-de-Mondeville (currently boulevard de l&#x27;Avenir). The family of Guérinière owned a castle, located between the current streets of Charity, Clos-du-Monastère and the Champ-de-Foire. The castle was destroyed during the Battle of Caen. In 1875, the city of Caen bought the 27 hectares of land of the Caen riding academy, located on the grounds of the castle of Guérinière, to develop a field of maneuver for the garrisons of the city. In 1951, this territory was officially attached to the municipality of Caen.

During the Battle of Normandy, the village was fortified by the Germans, shortly before the start of operations Goodwood and Atlantic by the British and Canadians. The village was liberated on 19 July 1944 by Canadian-Scottish battalions and North Nova Scotia Highlanders belonging to the 3rd Canadian infantry division after fighting against the soldiers of the 272nd German infantry division. Three weeks later, Canadian and Polish troops gather there to launch Operation Totalize. On August 8, US aircraft bombed by mistake causing losses. Cormelles-le-Royal is decorated with the Croix de Guerre 1939–1945.

== Toponymy ==
The name of the locality is attested in Cormellis forms around 1070 and Cormellae in 1195. The origin of the toponym is not clearly established, but Albert Dauzat and Charles Rostaing put forward the hypothesis of the old French corme, &quot;sorbe&quot; with diminutive -ella. Royal is an allusion to the privileges granted to the inhabitants of this town by Philip VI by letters patent of 22 June 1347.

During the revolutionary period of the National Convention (1792-1795), the commune, created from the parish of Cormelles-le-Royal took the name of Cormelles-le-Libre which was then cut short in Cormelles. The determinant &quot;the Royal&quot; was added again in 1969.

== Geography ==
Cormelles-le-Royal is located in the plain of Caen, in the southern suburbs of Caen . Its center is 4.5 km from the center of the regional capital. Located in the basin of the Orne, the territory covers an area of 348 hectares and has a population of 4829 inhabitants, a density of 1387 inhabitants / km 2. The highest point (37 m ) is at the southern limit, near the southern ring road interchange. The lowest point (13 m) corresponds to the exit of the only watercourse of the municipality of the territory, to the northeast.

<doc id="569522" wikidata="Q4682347" url="?curid=569522" title="Adequate stimulus">
<text>The adequate stimulus is a property of a sensory receptor that determines the type of energy to which a sensory receptor responds with the initiation of sensory transduction. Sensory receptor are specialized to respond to certain types of stimuli. The adequate stimulus is the amount and type of energy required to stimulate a specific sensory organ.

Many of the sensory stimuli are categorized by the mechanics by which they are able to function and their purpose. Sensory receptors that are present within the body typically are made to respond to a single stimulus. Sensory receptors are present all throughout the body, and they take a certain amount of a stimulus to trigger these receptors. The use of these sensory receptors allows the brain to interpret the signals to the body which allow a person to respond to the stimulus if the stimulus reaches a minimum threshold to signal the brain. The sensory receptors will activate the sensory transduction system which will in turn send an electrical or chemical stimulus to a cell, and the cell will then respond with electrical signals to the brain which were produced from action potentials. The minuscule signals, which result from the stimuli, enter the cells must be amplified and turned into an sufficient signal that will be sent to the brain.
A sensory receptor&#x27;s adequate stimulus is determined by the signal transduction mechanisms and ion channels incorporated in the sensory receptor&#x27;s plasma membrane. Adequate stimulus are often used in relation with sensory thresholds and absolute thresholds to describe the smallest amount of a stimulus needed to activate a feeling within the sensory organ.

== Categorizations of receptors ==
They are categorized through the stimuli to which they respond. Adequate stimulus are also often categorized based on their purpose and locations within the body. The following are the categorizations of receptors within the body:

*Visual – These are found in the visual organs of species and are responsive to stimuli such as light and often consist of light sensitive molecules that enable certain species to have the ability to see the world in which they live.
*Olfaction – These types of receptor sense are activated in order to sense the external molecules that enter the nasal organ and attach to the receptors which will interpret the stimuli and send the signal containing information about the stimuli to the brain.
*Auditory – These types of receptors are often found within the organs used to hear and are responsive to vibrations within the surrounding areas, and they often allow their owners to understand information about sound waves traveling through the aid.
*Vestibular – These types of receptors are usually found within organs used to hear, and they aid in the detection of movement that surrounds the creature using it.
*Gustatory – These sensory receptors are present within the mouth and are responsive to the molecular stimuli that enter the mouth. The receptors in the mouth typically fall into two of the following categories: receptors that are responsive to specific chemicals and receptors that are responsive to particles such as hydrogen ions, which are charged.
*Tactile – These types of receptors are normally present within the skin and are able to respond to stimulation such as heat, pressure, and movement 

==Classes==
There are several different types of stimuli to which adequate stimuli respond. The following are examples of stimuli to which receptors may:
* Light – When the adequate stimulus of a sensory receptor is light, the sensory receptors contain pigment molecules whose shape is transformed by light, and the changes in these molecules activate ion channels which initiate sensory transduction.
* Sound – When the adequate stimulus of a sensory receptor is sound, the sensory receptors are hair cells (mechanoreceptors). These hair cells contain stereocilia, which when bent, trigger the opening of ion channels. Thus hair cells transform the pressure waves of the sound into receptor potentials to initiate sensory transduction.

==Sensory receptors==

Sensory receptors are the ends of nerves within the body that respond to stimuli. There are many different types of sensory receptors that each respond to stimuli that they are uniquely fitted to res Types of sensory receptors include the following: 
*Nociceptor – These are stimulus that are responsive to the stimuli that signal potential damage to the body. 
*Photoreceptors – These are receptors that are responsive to light that enters the eye and produces the visual stimuli that many animals use to function.
*Mechanoreceptors – These are receptors that are responsive to physical stimulation such as movement, vibration, and stress.
*Thermoreceptors – These are types of receptors that are present within the skin and monitor any changes in the skins temperature

==Classic examples of absolute threshold==

In 1962, Eugene Galanter, a psychologist, tested stimuli till people were able to feel them approximately 50% of the time, then used the following as examples of absolute threshold:

*Visual – On a clear, dark night a candle can be seen from approximately 30 miles away.
*Olfactory – A person can smell a single drop of perfume after it has diffused into 3 rooms.
*Auditory – In a silent area, a person can hear a watch tick from approximately 20 feet.
*Vestibular – A person is able to tell of a tilt that when on a clock face is seen to be less than half a minute.
*Gustatory – A person can taste a single teaspoon of sugar which is diluted in 2 gallons of water.
*Tactile – A person can feel a fly&#x27;s wing dropped from 3 feet above them falling onto their cheek.

Through these conditions, Galanter was able to show that human&#x27;s sensory organs are often more sensitive than originally thought.

<doc id="569528" wikidata="Q1237155" url="?curid=569528" title="Sanok Land">
<text>Sanok Land (, ) was a historical administrative division unit (&quot;ziemia&quot;) of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from the 14th-18th centuries. It consisted of land that now belongs to the powiats (counties) of: Sanok, Brzozów, Lesko and partially Krosno and Rzeszów. Ziemia Sanocka was a part of the Ruthenian Voivodeship (Red Ruthenia of Lesser Poland) with the capital at Lwów (now Lviv, Ukraine).

Little is known about the area of Sanok in the early years of Polish history. According to archaeological findings, a number of gords already existed here when the region was under possible control of Great Moravia. Following several Polish - Ruthenian conflicts, Sanok became part of Red Ruthenia, and in 1150, the town was ransacked in a Hungarian raid. Until 1340, Sanok was part of various Ruthenian duchies, and later the Kingdom of Galicia-Volhynia. In 1340, the Land of Sanok, together with whole Red Ruthenia, was annexed by King Kazimierz Wielki. The King introduced Polish administrative structure here, dividing Red Ruthenia into four lands (see ziemia), one of which was the Land of Sanok, consisting of the County powiat of Sanok. The existence of Sanok County is confirmed by sources from 1423, and by that time, Sanok also was the seat of a starosta, who resided in a castle. 

The term Sanok Land, used to describe a separate administrative unit, appears for the first time in the mid-14th century, after the annexation of Red Ruthenia by the Kingdom of Poland. In 1359, the Latin language term &quot;castellania Sanocensi&quot; was used, while in 1363, the village of Radoszyce was mentioned as the one which belonged to “districtu Sanocensi”. In 1369, the term &quot;terra Sanocensi&quot; was used in documents. In 1384, several local villages were described as being under jurisdiction of &quot;castrum Sanocense&quot;.

The Land of Sanok remained a separate administrative unit within the Ruthenian Voivodeship until the Partitions of Poland, when it became part of Austrian Galicia. It had its own starosta, and its borders changed several times. Historians argue whether Krosno was at first part of Lesser Poland, or Red Ruthenia. Furthermore, the area of Tyczyn belonged to the Land of Sanok, but some time in the 15th century, it was transferred to the Przemyśl Land. Another example is the town of Bircza.

Since Sanok Land was sparsely populated, it was not divided into powiats. Most of its territory was covered by forests of the Carpathian Mountains, and the population was a mix of Poles, Ruthenians, Germans, Hungarians, Slovaks and Wallachians.

<doc id="569530" wikidata="Q4118709" url="?curid=569530" title="BBC Radio Derby">
<text>BBC Radio Derby is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving Derbyshire and East Staffordshire.

It broadcasts on FM, AM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios on St Helens Street in Derby.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 127,000 listeners and a 8.3% share as of December 2023.

==Overview==

BBC Radio Derby began broadcasting officially on 29 April 1971, though it went on air two months earlier than planned to cover the bankruptcy of the local aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce. The station&#x27;s logo was a Rams head in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Much of the station&#x27;s output is speech based, featuring news, sport, weather, travel, interviews, and discussions, mixed in with music and competitions. The station&#x27;s primary audience is aimed at listeners aged over 45, though the sports and weekend shows attract a greater age range.

BBC Radio Derby Sport broadcasts live match commentaries from local football teams, especially Derby County and Burton Albion. There is also extensive coverage of Derbyshire cricket during the summer.

The station won the prestigious &quot;Station of the Year&quot; award in the category for radio stations that serve between 300,000 and 1 million listeners at the Sony Radio Academy Awards in 2007, 2010 and 2011, becoming the first BBC local radio station to win it three times. Also, in both 2017 and 2009, Radio Derby was named Station of the Year in the BBC local radio station Gillard awards.

==Technical==

104.5 MHz FM is the primary frequency for BBC Radio Derby, and comes from a 200 ft FM transmitting mast on Drum Hill, four miles north of the Derby City Centre, the other side of the A38 from Little Eaton, next to a Scout camp. This service used to come from the Sutton Coldfield transmitter. There is a second FM transmitter for the Bakewell and Matlock areas based at Stanton Moor on 95.3 MHz FM, and a third FM transmitter, which is relay of that frequency for the Buxton area on 96.0 MHz FM.

Chesterfield, although located in Derbyshire, is served by BBC Radio Sheffield which has a dedicated relay transmitter in the town. Likewise, the north-western portion of the county taking in Glossop, Chapel-en-le-Frith, and Whaley Bridge, is served by BBC Radio Manchester.

In addition, all of BBC Radio Derby&#x27;s area is served via its medium wave service on 1116 kHz (269 metres), which comes from its single 500W AM transmitter site at Burnaston, just south of the city, close to the Toyota car plant.

The station broadcasts on DAB via the multiplex known as NOW Derbyshire. A local Derbyshire DAB licence was advertised by OFCOM in January 2007, and was awarded to &quot;Now Digital&quot; with an &quot;on air&quot; date originally planned for July 2008, which was delayed until July 2014. The multiplex is transmitted from five transmitter sites; Drum Hill, Tibshelf, Stanton Moor, and Lichfield. There are also long-term plans for further transmitters at Buxton, Ashbourne, and Glossop. 

The station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 717 in the BBC East Midlands, BBC West Midlands and BBC Yorkshire regions.

===Other output===
BBC Radio Derby also streams online, to internet radios and via BBC Sounds where programmes from the past 28 days are available to listen.

A short news bulletin is available on smart speakers.

The football focused evening programme is available as a podcast called &#x27;Rams Daily&#x27;.

News items, videos, audio clips and photos are posted on Twitter to the general @BBCDerby account, and on the Facebook page with the same handle. Sports related updates are posted on Twitter to the @BBCDerbySport account.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Derby studios from 6 am to 2 pm on Mondays to Fridays with all other programming since 2023, apart from sports coverage, being regional or national, and during the overnight downtime, BBC Radio Derby simulcasts BBC Radio 5 Live.

==Presenters==
In 2025 it was reported that BBC Radio Derby and Sabras Radio presenter Pam Sidhu and her husband were recruiters for the Educo Cult and that the BBC had ignored safeguarding reports about her.

===Notable former presenters===

*Colin Bloomfield
*Mike Carey
*Terry Christian
*Ross Fletcher
*James Whale (now at Talkradio)
*Alastair Yates
==Branding==
The station&#x27;s jingles have varied greatly over the years as trends in music and technology have changed; indeed, the jingle that plays prior to every hourly news bulletin (one of a new batch of tunes introduced in January 2017), features the slogan, On Radio, TV and Mobile - this is BBC Radio Derby; a reflection of the different ways in which the station&#x27;s output can be heard these days. In the mid-1980s, the station&#x27;s slogan was &quot;Rise and shine on 269!&quot;; the &#x27;269&#x27; referring to the 269 metres wavelength of the 1116 kHz medium wave frequency. This slogan formed the basis of many jingles in this era, but was phased out in the 1990s as FM listening increased. Nowadays, only the actual frequency of the medium wave signal (1116 MW) is mentioned on the station.

From the commencement of the 96 FM frequency for the Buxton area until April 2007, the jingles were provided by Bespoke Music of Penryn, Cornwall (being exactly the same as BBC Radio Wiltshire). From 2007 to 2011, jingles were provided by Wise Buddah Productions of London. Then there were Mcasso jingles from 2011 until 2020. Currently, jingles are provided by Reelworld.

==Colin Bloomfield Sun Meter==

On 3 June 2016, Radio Derby unveiled the UK&#x27;s first public UV meter in Markeaton Park. It was a joint venture with the charity Skcin and was paid for with proceeds from the Colin Bloomfield Melanoma Appeal. Later in the year, a second meter was unveiled in Long Eaton&#x27;s West Park.

==Money Mountain appeals==
From 1983 until 2008, BBC Radio Derby held its annual &#x27;Money Mountain&#x27; event. In later years this took place on the second Sunday of October; however it was originally held over the course of the entire weekend, and was presented from a marquee in the station&#x27;s car park. This idea was abandoned a few years prior to the event&#x27;s demise and all presenting took place inside the station building itself.

The idea of the event was to support local charities with donations from listeners. The day commenced with &#x27;Dial a Hymn&#x27;; where listeners dedicated hymns to loved ones in exchange for a donation. This was followed at 9 am by an on-air auction which lasted until late in the evening. Lots typically consisted services by local companies (such as car valeting) and unique items (such as signed celebrity photographs, behind-the-scenes tours and home-made products).

In 2004, the amount of money raised over the years passed the one million pound mark. The person who pledged the bid to surpass this figure was rewarded with a cut glass trophy.

The 2008 auction was to be the last. Twenty-five years had passed since the first auction, and it was decided for the event to &quot;go out on a high&quot; in the anniversary year. The final lot was to win the actual gavel used during the auction over the years. This raised £350; the final total for the 2008 auction was £20,951.31, bringing the grand total over the twenty-five years to £1,121,010.31.

<doc id="569543" wikidata="Q795592" url="?curid=569543" title="BBC Radio Leicester">
<text>BBC Radio Leicester is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the counties of Leicestershire and Rutland.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios at St Nicholas Place in Leicester.

According to RAJAR, the station had a weekly audience of 119,000 listeners and a 4.4% share as of June 2024.

==History==
BBC Radio Leicester was the first BBC Local Radio station, launching at 12:45 on 8 November 1967 on 95.05 VHF from a transmitter located on Gorse Hill above the city centre.

In 2007, the station celebrated its 40th anniversary by launching a Ruby Rainbow Appeal in aid of the Rainbows Hospice based in Loughborough, within its TSA (total survey area). Special events took place throughout the year culminating in a final fundraising appeal around the time of the anniversary in November 2007.

==Studios==
In 2005, the station moved to new premises at 9 St Nicholas Place. This new centre is adjacent to the medieval Guildhall and Cathedral and includes many aspects of Leicester&#x27;s history, such as Victorian tiles and an undercroft (first revealed in 1841), with remains dating to Roman times. The Centre houses the BBC College of Journalism&#x27;s base for the Midlands, an IT Centre that is used in partnership with local organisations, and a BBC Shop selling a wide range of BBC-branded merchandise.

==Technical==

Although the station&#x27;s FM transmitter mast is only 70 m (230 ft) tall, it is set 235 m (770 ft) above sea level on top of the Jurassic limestone ridge at Copt Oak, next to the M1. This is a high point in Charnwood Forest, part of the National Forest.

Since 6 December 2002, the station&#x27;s DAB signal has come from the NOW Digital East Midlands (NDEM) Leicester 11B multiplex, which comes from the Copt Oak, Leicester Cardinal, Waltham, and Houghton on the Hill transmitters.

The station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 713 in the BBC East Midlands region and streams online via BBC Sounds.

The station also used to broadcast on 837 kHz medium wave frequency from the Freeman&#x27;s Common transmitter, near the University of Leicester. On 30 October 1989, the BBC Asian Network launched on the 837 MW frequency, as well as launching on the MW frequency of BBC WM. Initially launched as a part-time service across the Midlands, it became a full-time service in 1996, resulting in BBC Radio Leicester no longer broadcasting on medium wave.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Leicester studios from 06:00 to 14:00 on Mondays to Fridays.

All other programming apart from sport became regional or national in 2023 although the 14:0018:00 weekday regional show is broadcast from the Radio Leicester studios.

During the station&#x27;s downtime, BBC Radio Leicester simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live.

<text>BBC Radio Lincolnshire is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the county of Lincolnshire.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios near Newport Arch in Lincoln.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 66,000 listeners and a 3.1% share as of December 2023.

==History==
A BBC national broadcasting site covering the area had opened at the Corporation&#x27;s Stamp End Depot on Thursday 8 March 1951. and carried an opt-out programme &#x27;News from the North&#x27;.
Almost three decades later, on 11 November 1980 at 7 am, the county got its own station when BBC Radio Lincolnshire opened with a commissioned peal of bells from Lincoln Cathedral with the first words spoken coming from Nick Brunger: &quot;And it&#x27;s a warm welcome for the first time to the programmes of BBC Radio Lincolnshire.&quot;

In 1988, the station commissioned UK jingle producer Alfasound to compose a jingle package based on the traditional English folk song The Lincolnshire Poacher, continuing on this theme until 2006.

For most of its first decade on air, BBC Radio Lincolnshire did not broadcast during the evening and simulcast BBC Radio 2 from around 7 pm on weekdays and 5 pm at the weekend. However, the end of the 1980s saw BBC Local Radio beginning weeknight programmes with stations broadcasting a mostly regional, rather than local, service, networked on all the stations in that area. BBC Radio Lincolnshire broadcast its own programmes until 9 pm before joining with the other East Midlands stations to air a late show which broadcast from 9 pm until midnight. However evening programming at the weekend didn&#x27;t begin until many years later and the station still handed over to BBC Radio 5 Live mid-evening at the weekend until well into the 2000s.

In 2006, BBC Radio Lincolnshire conducted a six-month trial of XDA pocket-PCs for the BBC, using Technica Del Arte&#x27;s Luci mobile (on the hoof) interviewing application.

The station used to have a BBC Bus, until cutbacks in early 2008 forced budget priorities to be streamlined.

On 15 January 2018, BBC Radio Lincolnshire stopped broadcasting on medium wave.

===Management===
Under its first manager, Roy Corlett, the station achieved record audience figures as its programming of news, music and chat became very popular. Corlett left to found BBC Radio Devon and was replaced briefly by Laurie Bloomfield, who also left to launch a new BBC local station, BBC Radio Shropshire.

After Bloomfield&#x27;s brief stay, the station was managed for 14 years by David Wilkinson, one of the founding team, and a local radio pioneer from his days at BBC Radio Nottingham in 1968. Upon Wilkinson&#x27;s retirement in 1999, the station was taken over by BBC Radio Leicester managing editor, Charlie Partridge. In 2004, the station recorded record audience figures – according to RAJAR, listeners were tuned into BBC Radio Lincolnshire for longer (&quot;hours&quot;) than any other radio station in the country.
===Lincolnshire flag===
In October 2005, it presided over the creation of a new flag for Lincolnshire.

===Name change===
The station changed its name from BBC Radio Lincolnshire to BBC Lincolnshire on 30 November 2009. The name reverted to BBC Radio Lincolnshire in May 2012.

==Technical==
The main signal on 94.9FM comes from the Belmont transmitting station near Donington on Bain in the north of the county, which, until the height reduction carried out in September/October 2009, was the tallest mast in Europe.

Radio Lincolnshire covers most, but not all of, Lincolnshire on FM as the signal does not fully cover the southern edge of the county, including Bourne, Holbeach, Stamford, Market Deeping and Spalding although the low-powered Grantham transmitter, from just south of the town, does go some way to providing FM coverage across southern Lincolnshire. However, those areas receive BBC Radio Cambridgeshire through DAB. Also, areas in Northern Lincolnshire, including Barton upon Humber and Immingham, cannot receive the station. Instead, North Lincolnshire is served by BBC Radio Humberside. DAB provides wider, but not complete, coverage; however, BBC Radio Lincolnshire is available across all of the county via Freeview TV as below.

Until early 1992, Radio Lincolnshire was the only local radio station in Lincolnshire. This changed when Lincs FM began broadcasting.

Monks&#x27; Dyke Technology College in Louth is used for the East Lindsey reports. District outposts are important due to the time taken on Lincolnshire&#x27;s ill-equipped roads.

The station broadcasts on DAB from the Belmont transmitter. For Lincolnshire, a DAB multiplex could have only been realistically established by financial investment from the Lincs FM Group, and other transmitter positions could theoretically be used. The DAB licence, was advertised in October 2007, which will not cover Stamford or South Holland, but will cover North Lincolnshire (Scunthorpe) and North East Lincolnshire (Grimsby). On 24 January 2008, the company MuxCo Lincolnshire was the only company to bid for the Lincolnshire DAB licence. It is 51% owned by the Lincs FM Group, and will have transmitters at Belmont, High Hunsley (in East Yorkshire), Grantham and Lincoln County Hospital. They were awarded the DAB licence on 19 February 2008. Transmissions were expected to begin by July 2009, but funding for the project delayed the roll-out and the multiplex went on air in September 2015.

The station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 714 in the BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, BBC Yorkshire and BBC East Midlands regions and streams online via BBC Sounds.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Lincoln studios from 6 am to 10 pm on Mondays to Saturdays and from 6 am to 6 pm on Sundays.

Off-peak programming, including the late show from 10 pm to 1 am originates from BBC Radio Leeds (weekdays), BBC Radio WM (Saturdays), BBC Radio York (Sunday evenings) and BBC Radio Norfolk (Sunday nights).

During the station&#x27;s downtime, BBC Radio Lincolnshire simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio London.

===Specialist programming===

The station&#x27;s sports strand, &quot;Hope and Glory&quot;, broadcasts full commentary on all Lincoln City football matches with additional commentary of Boston United and Gainsborough Trinity matches online.

Radio Lincolnshire also has a dedicated farming programme on Sundays at 7 am, which the station has broadcast since it began broadcasting.

===Former programming===
A weekly news bulletin in Portuguese was broadcast for migrant workers until July 2008. It was read by Rui Silva, who worked for Boston Borough Council.

==Events==
Since the early 1980s, a race had been held at the Market Rasen Racecourse, the &quot;BBC Radio Lincolnshire Novice&#x27;s Hurdle&quot;. In recent years, this has become the &quot;Mike Molloy Memorial Handicap Chase&quot;, named after a former sports presenter who died of Myeloma.

In 1983, it formed a charity trust, thought to be the first in the UK for a radio station. This became known as &quot;Going for Gold&quot;. Originally &quot;GOLD&quot; stood for &quot;Give Our Lincolnshire Defibrillators&quot;. Since then, money has been raised for a number of other local causes.

It holds an annual folk song competition called &quot;Song For Lincolnshire&quot;.

==Notable former staff==

<doc id="569553" wikidata="Q309123" url="?curid=569553" title="Courseulles-sur-Mer">
<text>Courseulles-sur-Mer (, ), commonly known as &quot;Courseulles&quot;, is a commune in the Calvados department, Normandy, northwestern France. Until 1957, the town&#x27;s name was simply &quot;Courseulles&quot;. It lies 3 km west of Bernières-sur-Mer and 18 km north of Caen.

It is a popular tourist destination not only with locals but also with international visitors who come to tour the Normandy landing beaches. The population of the town can reach 15,000 people in the summer months owing to the numerous summer homes, owned for the most part by Parisians. The town is split in two by the river Seulles.

==World War Two==
More than 14,000 Canadians stormed the stretch of a Lower Normandy Beach between Courseulles-sur-Mer and St. Aubin-sur-Mer on 6 June 1944. They were followed by 150,000 additional Canadian troops over the next few months, and throughout the summer of 1944 the Canadian military used the town’s port to unload upwards of 1,000 tons of material a day, for the first two weeks following D-Day on 6 June 1944.

Canadians of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division and 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade, suffered 1,074 casualties, including 369 killed on the beach and in the Calvados countryside on the first day of the invasion, reaching almost inland on the first day of fighting, the farthest advance of any of the Allied landing forces.

The Canadian military cemetery of Bény-Reviers is the resting place of 2,043 Canadians and 1 Frenchman. The land for this cemetery was donated by France to Canada after the Second World War and lies inland from Courseulles-sur-Mer, just off Route 79.

The Juno Beach Centre is a museum located in Courseulles-sur-Mer, at the head of the River Seulles, in the port&#x27;s estuary, where Canadian troops landed and fought, on D-Day 6 June 1944. The museum opened on 6 June 2003, the 59th anniversary of the D-Day landings.

===D-Day: La Cité===

The strongest German defence position in the Juno assault area was concentrated at Courseulles-sur-Mer, on the estuary of the River Seulles. Delaying H-Hour for a higher tide, to clear offshore reefs, the Canadian landing at Courseulles-sur-Mer began slightly later than those to the west, giving the German defender a warning they would need.

Stützpuntkte (StP) (Strong-Point) Courseulles-sur-Mer, was a complex of three fortified ‘resistance nests’, two strengthened by numerous standard concrete fortifications, protecting anti-tank and artillery field guns. The layout followed no particular design; being established based on weapons available, its terrain features, and troops available to occupy. The concrete fortification casements at two resistance nests further disposed numerous entrenchments, in which mortars and heavy machine guns were emplaced. They were each manned by about 30-50 men, intended to fight under independent command. In command of the fight, across the Stützpuntkte (StP) Courseulles was Hauptmann Grote, Kdr. &quot;Kompanie&quot; 6. / Grenadier-Regiment 736./ Bataillon II., who perhaps had more ground to fight than men.

====Widerstandnesten WN 29====
StP.Courseulles (Osten) was located at North 49.3358 Deg / West 00.45136 Deg and in June 1944, for targeting purposes, at: LZ1 vT MR Grid 972856 (Ref. GSGS 4250 1:50K: Creully Sheet 7E/5). The (WN) Resistance Nest at Courseulles (East) was a very large ‘platoon-sized’ position, attempting to protect entry into the town port and to deny exits off the beach, into the town. East of the river, its strength was dominated by an 88mm gun, protected to its front (to fire in enfilade), and a 50 mm gun, supported by machine gun and Tobruks. Opposite the harbour was a second 50mm gun (with Tobruk) and towards the centre a 75mm field gun, and 37mm tank turret, they supported by machine gun and Tobruks. The right front (NE) sea approach was protected by the large K.V. Gruppe Courseulles Beach Minefield: Mf 58. On its right was a 75mm field gun, protected by a substantial anti-tank ditch inland, and its right flank (SE approach) by the K.V. Gruppe Courseulles tactical minefield: Mf 43. The position&#x27;s &quot;Züg Führer&quot; (acting commander) defence was enabled by an &#x27;underground&#x27; network of tunnels and covered trenches, permitting unobserved movement.

Courseulles (Osten) was fronted by an area of coastal erosion with various works to prevent, control or delay its effects. There were groynes built out into the sea to try and stop the movement of sand. On D-Day the presence of the groynes together with the strong current along the beach and the beach obstacles made landings and lateral movement along the beach, tricky. To test an attacker, most of the buildings of Courseulles were further protected by sea walls. Here it was shelled for effect by the embarked 105 mm guns of 13th Field Regiment, RCA from H-30 to H+5 and began taking direct fire from the DD Tanks of &#x27;B&#x27; Squadron, 1st Hussars towards 07h55 (BST), who landed correctly and on time as planned. Fourteen DD tanks of the 1st Hussars made it ashore, and quickly came to engage the strongpoint’s guns. An 88 mm gun, beside the harbour exit, a 50 mm behind it, and a 75 mm on the right flank, fired continuously until their protective shields could be pierced. No tanks were lost in the spirited duel.

Landing to its centre at 08h05, in a gap between its two 75mm guns, making a left flanking approach, came ‘A’ Company, The Regina Rifle Regiment, (OC Major F. E. Hodge). Successful in getting off the beach, engaged in heavy fighting, working in tandem, with ‘B’ Squadron, it ‘neutralized’ the strong-point. Pushing into Courseulles, &#x27;A&#x27; Company, as set out in the plan, cleared Town Blocks 5, 6, and 7 but had to return to the beachfront (Block No.1) where the Germans had returned, by tunnels and trenches, to reoccupy their guns. The Regina’s began the disheartening task of clearing the beachfront again, it only came to be ‘captured’ after this second fight.

‘B’ Company landed at 08h15, further to the east; and quickly engaged the crew served weapon pillboxes positioned along the strong-point beachfront. The seawall offering little cover, but with good support from ‘B’ Squadron, they got off the beach and dashed into the strongpoint’s fortifications.

German Crew Served Weapons at StP.Courseulles (Osten) 

====Widerstandnesten WN 30====
StP.Courseulles (Süden) was located at North 49.3303 Deg / West 00. 4593 Deg and in June 1944, for targeting purposes, at: LZ1 vT MR Grid 969848 (Ref. GSGS 4250 1:50K: Creully Sheet 7E/5). The (WN) Resistance Nest at Courseulles (South) was a small ‘platoon-sized’ position, attempting to control the southeast exit, from Courseulles. Here, Hauptmann Grote had his Zug-Gruppen, Kompanie 6. / Batl II 736, establish a supporting depth position, opposite the Châteaux, reinforcing a group of houses, above the town centre. WN 30 was a crew served weapon position, with only light machine guns (MG) and a least one light 50mm mortar (in Granatwerfer Schutzenloch), undercover, in a Type 1 Fa position. With no PaK guns, tasked to &#x27;defend&#x27; the south exit from town, it did cause some delay. Providing mortar and machine gun covering fire, into WN 29, with its height advantage it made the task of clearing the beachfront extremely difficult. Attacked by &#x27;A&#x27; Company, The Regina Rifle Regiment, it took until late afternoon for Courseulles (Süden) to be taken.

===D-Day: L’île===
====Widerstandnesten WN31====
StP.Courseulles (West) was located at North 49.3367 Deg / West W 00.4602 and in June 1944, for targeting purposes, at: LZ1 vT MR Grid 965858 (Ref. GSGS 4250 1:50K: Creully Sheet 7E/5). The (WN) Resistance Nest at Courseulles (West) was a very large ‘platoon-sized’ position, attempting to protect entry into the town port, deny exits off the beach, and prevent an out-flanking entry into the town. West of the River Seulles, still being &#x27;developed&#x27;, it sat on a small peninsula of land, water defending three of its approaches, its land based left front (NW) approach protected by the very large K.V.Gruppe Courseulles Beach Minefield: Mf 72. At its western end was a 50mm gun, in an open pit emplacement, supported by a Heavy MG. Towards its center, facing west down the beach, was a 75mm field gun and a 50mm gun, both in casemates. Overlooking the harbour was a 50mm gun, in a casemate (protecting its front), that could fire east or west. Additionally thirteen crew served, machine gun and mortar, weapon emplacements, had their rear was protected by the river.

With half of his Kompanie 6. / Batl II. / Gren.Regt 736., on the position, Hauptmann Grote commanded the fight for Stützpuntkte (StP) Courseulles, from a Type Regelbau Command Post Shelter / Bunker. Fighting WN 31, its Züg Führer (Acting Commander), having no &#x27;urban&#x27; structures to observe &#x27;over&#x27; the dunes, had to rely on a Type Regelbau R666 - Infantry Observation Bunker (with Panzerkuppel - 89P6 Small Turret) to adjust to the Canadian assault. Courseulles (West) was fronted by an area of coastal erosion, where sand deposits had blocked the River Seulles access to the sea and forced it into a loop. The strong-point was not fronted by beach villas, which were a feature of much of the JUNO Sector, and there were few landmarks, making it difficult to identifying the correct point on which to that land. After the Assault Force J1 Beach Bombardment Programme, which did not seem to have much actual effect, WN 31 began to take indirect 105mm artillery fire from the guns of 12th Field Regiment, RCA from H-30 to H+5 and direct fire from the DD Tanks of &#x27;A&#x27; Squadron, 1st Hussars near 07h45. Landing just a little &#x27;late&#x27;, seven &#x27;A&#x27; squadron immediately fired on the 50 mm anti-tank gun emplacement, it destroyed, ‘A’ Squadron began to ‘cruise up and down the beach’ engaging the machine gun crews, permitting the infantry to sweep over the dunes to begin their fight for the position.

Landing on its strong left flank, ‘B’ Company, Royal Winnipeg Rifles, (OC Captain P. E. Gower), was immediately pinned down by its heavy machine gun, and the 50mm, in a concrete pillbox, while taking accurate sniper fire. Skirting left away from the position, ‘B’ Company forced a crossing of the river, on a small bridge at MR 964857, and got in to clear ‘four’ defensible positions, on the ‘island’. The Coy Comd and twenty-six other ranks ‘survived’ the assault of the three casements and its twelve MG emplacements. It took until the early afternoon for WN 31 to be secured.

<text>Ludovico Maria Enrico Einaudi OMRI (; born 23 November 1955) is an Italian pianist and composer. Trained at the Conservatorio Verdi in Milan, Einaudi began his career as a classical composer, later incorporating other styles and genres such as pop, rock, folk, and world music.

Einaudi has composed the scores for a number of films and television productions, including &quot;This Is England&quot;, &quot;The Intouchables&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot;, the TV miniseries &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, and &quot;Acquario&quot; (1996), for which he won the Grolla d&#x27;oro. His music was used as the score for the Golden Globe and Academy Award-winning films &quot;Nomadland&quot; and &quot;The Father&quot;.

He has also released a number of solo albums for piano and other instruments, notably &quot;I Giorni&quot; in 2001, &quot;Nightbook&quot; in 2009, and &quot;In a Time Lapse&quot; in 2013. On 1 March 2019, Einaudi announced a seven-part project named &quot;Seven Days Walking&quot;, which was released over the course of seven months in 2019.

In 2005, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.

==Early life and education==
Einaudi was born in Turin, Piedmont. His father, Giulio Einaudi, was a publisher working with authors including Italo Calvino and Primo Levi, and founder of Giulio Einaudi Editore. His paternal grandfather, Luigi Einaudi, was President of Italy between 1948 and 1955. His mother, Renata Aldrovandi, played the piano to him as a child. Her father, Waldo Aldrovandi, was a pianist, opera conductor, and composer who emigrated to Australia after World War II.

Einaudi started composing music as a teenager, first writing by playing a folk guitar. He began his musical training at the Conservatorio Verdi in Milan, obtaining a diploma in composition in 1982. That same year he took an orchestration class taught by Luciano Berio and was awarded a scholarship to the Tanglewood Music Festival. According to Einaudi, &quot;[Luciano Berio] did some interesting work with African vocal music and did some arrangements of Beatles songs, and he taught me that there is a sort of dignity inside music. I learnt orchestration from him and a very open way of thinking about music.&quot; He also learned by collaborating with musicians such as Ballaké Sissoko from Mali and Djivan Gasparyan from Armenia. His music is ambient, meditative, and often introspective, drawing on minimalism and contemporary pop.

==Music career==
===1980s===
After studying at the conservatory in Milan and subsequently with Berio, Einaudi spent several years composing in traditional forms, including several chamber and orchestral pieces. He soon garnered international attention and his music was performed at venues such as the Teatro alla Scala, the Tanglewood Music Festival, Lincoln Center, and the UCLA Center for Performing Arts.

In the mid-1980s, he began to search for more personal expression in a series of works for dance and multimedia, and later for piano.

Some of his collaborations in theatre, video, and dance included compositions for the Sul filo d&#x27;Orfeo in 1984, &quot;Time Out&quot; in 1988, a dance-theatre piece created with writer Andrea De Carlo, &quot;The Wild Man&quot; in 1990, and the&quot; Emperor&quot; in 1991. Later collaborations include &quot;Salgari&quot; (&quot;Per terra e per mare&quot;) (1995), an opera/ballet commissioned by the Arena di Verona with texts by Emilio Salgari, Rabindranath Tagore, and Charles Duke Jr, and &quot;E.A. Poe&quot; (1997), which was conceived as a soundtrack for silent films.

===Soundtracks===
Einaudi began using his style to compose film soundtracks in the mid-1990s. He started with two films by Michele Sordillo, &quot;Da qualche parte in città&quot; in 1994 and &quot;Acquario&quot; in 1996, for which he won the Grolla d&#x27;oro for best soundtrack. In 1998, he composed the soundtrack for &quot;Treno di panna&quot; and the score for &quot;Giorni dispari&quot; by Dominick Tambasco.

In 2000, he collaborated with Antonello Grimaldi on &quot;Un delitto impossibile&quot;, and he also composed the soundtrack for &quot;Fuori del mondo&quot;, for which he won the Echo Klassik award in Germany in 2002. After the release of his debut album, some excerpts were included in the film &quot;Aprile&quot; by Nanni Moretti. In 2002, his soundtrack for &quot;Luce dei miei occhi&quot; was named best soundtrack at the 2002 Italian Music Awards.

In 2002, Einaudi won an Italian award for Best Film Score for &quot;Luce dei miei occhi&quot;. AllMusic gave his score for the 2002 TV serial &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; 4.5/5 stars and published a glowing review, comparing it in skill to Maurice Jarre&#x27;s score of the previous film adaptation.

In 2004, his soundtrack for &quot;Sotto falso nome&quot; received the prize for the best film music at the Avignon Film Festival.

In 2010, Einaudi wrote the music for the trailer of &quot;Black Swan&quot;. His &quot;Due Tramonti&quot; was featured in the film &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; (2010), directed by Casey Affleck. His composition &quot;Nuvole Bianche&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Insidious&quot; (2010), directed by James Wan, the British TV drama &quot;This Is England 86&quot;, and in the TV series &quot;Derek&quot; (2012), directed by and starring Ricky Gervais. To &quot;The Intouchables&quot; (2011), the biggest box office movie in French history, he contributed the tracks &quot;Fly&quot;, &quot;Writing Poems&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;origine nascosta&quot;, &quot;Cache-cache&quot;, &quot;Una Mattina&quot;, and &quot;Primavera.&quot; The film &quot;This Is England&quot; featured &quot;Fuori dal mondo&quot; and &quot;Dietro casa&quot;. The British TV drama series &quot;This Is England &#x27;88&quot; also contained the tracks &quot;Fuori Dalla Notte&quot;, &quot;Solo&quot; (a bonus track from &quot;Nightbook&quot;), &quot;Berlin Song&quot;, and &quot;Distacco&quot;.

===Solo releases===
Einaudi is signed to Decca Records and is published by Chester Music Limited, part of the Music Sales Group of Companies.
After the multi-media-inspired &quot;Time Out&quot; in 1988, in 1992 he released &quot;Stanze&quot;, which he had composed for harp. The album was performed by Cecilia Chailly, one of the first musicians to use an electric harp. Einaudi released his first solo piano album, &quot;Le Onde&quot;, in 1996, under BMG. The album is based on the novel &quot;The Waves&quot; by British writer Virginia Woolf, and enjoyed mainstream success, particularly in Italy and the UK. His 1999 followup, &quot;Eden Roc&quot;, was also released on BMG, with shorter pieces. For the project he collaborated with the Armenian duduk musician Djivan Gasparyan.

His next solo piano release, &quot;I Giorni&quot; (2001), was inspired by his travels in Africa. The solo piano track &quot;I Giorni&quot; was featured in a BBC promotion for arts and culture programs, and attracted much interest due to Greg James&#x27; airing of the piece on BBC Radio 1 in June 2011. James mentioned that he found the piece therapeutic when he was studying at university. Due to repeated airings that month, the track entered the UK Singles Chart at #32 on 12 June 2011.

In 2003, Einaudi released the live album &quot;La Scala Concert 03.03.03&quot;, which was recorded at the famous La Scala opera house in Milan. His 2003 album &quot;Diario Mali&quot; is another collaboration, with Einaudi on piano and Malian musician Ballaké Sissoko on kora. In 2004, Einaudi released the album &quot;Una Mattina&quot; on Decca Records. The 2006 album &quot;Divenire&quot; consists of piano accompanied by orchestra. The album also includes the artist&#x27;s critically acclaimed track &quot;Primavera.&quot; It was recorded by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, with Einaudi as the piano master. Shortly after its release, Einaudi went on tour to various places in the UK, playing both the music on &quot;Divenire&quot; and orchestral arrangements of his other works. The album topped the iTunes classical chart.

In October 2009, &quot;Nightbook&quot; was released. The album saw Einaudi take a new direction with his music as he incorporated synthesized sounds alongside his piano. The album was conceived and recorded in response to the German painter and sculptor Anselm Kiefer, as well as an exhibit space where Einaudi performed for a gallery opening for Kiefer. It was also inspired by the drums and electronics of the Whitetree Project, a performing trio Einaudi formed with Robert and Ronald Lippok of To Rococo Rot, a German electronic group. In Italy, the album went Gold with more than 35,000 copies sold.

Einaudi&#x27;s album &quot;In a Time Lapse&quot; was released on 21 January 2013, with US and Canadian supporting tours. He also appeared on KCRW in Los Angeles. On 17 September 2013, Einaudi performed various songs from &quot;In a Time Lapse&quot;, together with a new ensemble, at the annual iTunes Festival held at the Roundhouse in London. The group intimately rehearsed this performance in the barn of Einaudi&#x27;s house. In March 2016, the world premiere of a new piano concerto, &quot;Domino&quot;, took place at the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra.

==Style==
In a review of &quot;Elements&quot;, Classicalite&#x27;s Steve Nagel writes that &quot;because Einaudi errs so much on the side of minimalism and pop that it might be more appropriate to label his music as a product of the New Age movement, which—although seemingly less ambitious than broader classical structures—concentrates more on relaxation, cohesion, elements of nature and an air of optimism&quot;. Ben Beaumont-Thomas of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, in a negative review of a 2016 live performance, critiques Einaudi the performer with &quot;[he] casts himself as the antithesis to the stuffy conservatoire—but then plays music that is less adventurous than your average indie band&#x27;s&quot;, complaining that &quot;Einaudi compounds this by being a mediocre pianist. He can finesse a phrase, but is proudly anti-virtuosic, playing only simple arpeggios and limpid four-note melodies&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 2016, Einaudi participated in the Greenpeace campaign to save the Arctic.

<doc id="569567" wikidata="Q275106" url="?curid=569567" title="Yuri Dolgorukiy">
<text>Yuri I Vladimirovich (; ; c. 1099 – 15 May 1157), commonly known as Yuri Dolgorukiy (, ) or the Long Arm, was a Monomakhovichi prince of Rostov and Suzdal, acquiring the name &quot;Suzdalia&quot; during his reign. Noted for successfully curbing the privileges of the landowning &quot;boyar&quot; class in Rostov-Suzdal and his ambitious building programme, Yuri transformed this principality into the independent power that would evolve into early modern Muscovy. Yuri Dolgorukiy was the progenitor of the Yurievichi ( ), a branch of the Monomakhovichi.

Yuri spent much of his life in internecine strife with the other Rus&#x27; princes for suzerainty over the Kievan Rus, which had been held by his father (Vladimir Monomakh) and his elder brother before him. Although he twice managed to briefly hold Kiev (in September 1149 – April 1151, again in March 1155 – May 1157) and rule as Grand Prince of Kiev, his autocratic rule and perceived foreigner status made him unpopular with the powerful Kievan &quot;boyars&quot;, leading to his presumed poisoning and the expulsion of his son (later Andrei Bogoliubsky of Vladimir-Suzdal) in 1157. His rule marked the effective end of the Rus&#x27; as a unified entity until the Mongol invasions, with powerful provincial territories like Vladimir-Suzdal and Galicia-Volhynia now competing for the throne of Kiev.

== Biography ==
=== Birth ===

Yuri was the sixth son of Vladimir Monomakh. It is unclear when Yuri was born. Some chronicles report that Yuri&#x27;s elder brother, Viacheslav, said to him: &quot;I am much older than you; I was already bearded when you were born.&quot; Since Viacheslav was born in 1083, this supposedly pushes Yuri&#x27;s birth to c. 1099/1100. However, the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; records the first marriage of Yuri – on 12 January 1108. It means that Yuri was born before c. 1099/1100 (as he could not have been 6–9 years old at the time of marriage).

=== Activities in Rostov and Suzdal ===
In 1108 Vladimir Monomakh sent his young son Yuri to govern in his name the vast Vladimir-Suzdal principality in the north-east of Kievan Rus&#x27;. In 1121 Yuri quarreled with the boyars of Rostov and moved the capital of his lands from that city to Suzdal. As the area was sparsely populated, Yuri founded many fortresses there. He established the towns of Ksniatin (in 1134), Pereslavl-Zalesski and Yuriev-Polski (in 1152), and Dmitrov (in 1154). The establishment of Tver, Kostroma, and Vologda is also popularly assigned to Yuri.

In 1147 Yuri Dolgorukiy had a meeting with Sviatoslav Olgovich (then prince of Belgorod Kievsky) in a place called Moscow. In 1156 Yuri fortified Moscow with wooden walls and a moat. Although the settlement probably existed later or earlier, Dolgorukiy is often called &quot;the Founder of Moscow&quot;.

=== Struggle for Kiev ===
For all the interest he took in fortifying his Northern lands, Yuri still coveted the throne of Kiev. It is his active participation in the Southern affairs that earned him the epithet of &quot;Dolgorukiy&quot;, &quot;the far-reaching&quot;. His elder brother Mstislav of Kiev died in 1132, and &quot;the Rus lands fell apart&quot;, as one chronicle put it. Yuri instantaneously declared war on the princes of Chernigov, the reigning Grand Prince and his brother Yaropolk II of Kiev, enthroned his son in Novgorod, and captured his father&#x27;s hereditary principality at Pereyaslav of the South. The Novgorodians, however, betrayed him, and Yuri avenged by seizing their key eastern fortress, Torzhok.

In 1147, Dolgorukiy resumed his struggle for Kiev and in 1149 he captured it, but in 1151 he was driven from the capital of Rus by his nephew Iziaslav. In 1155, Yuri regained Kiev once again. After presumably being poisoned at the feast of a Kievan nobleman, Yuri unexpectedly died in 1157 which sparked anti-Suzdalian uprising in Kiev. Yuri Dolgoruki was interred at the Saviour Church in Berestovo, Kiev, but his tomb is empty.

== Marriages and children ==
The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; records the first marriage of Yuri on 12 January 1108. His first wife was a daughter of Ayyub Khan (in Slavic sources: Аепа Осенев, Aepa son of ), Khan of the Cumans. Her paternal grandfather was Osen. Her people belonged to the Cumans, a confederation of pastoralists and warriors of Turkic origin.

His second wife Helena survived him and moved to Constantinople. Her paternity is not known for certain, but Nikolay Karamzin was the first to theorise that Helena was returning to her native city. She has since been theorised to be a member of the Komnenos dynasty which ruled the Byzantine Empire throughout the life of Yuri.

Yuri had at least fifteen children. The identities of the mothers are not known for certain.
* The following are considered elder children and usually attributed to the first wife.
** Rostislav, Prince of Pereyaslavl (d. 6 April 1151).
** Ivan, Prince of Kursk (d. 24 February 1147).
** Olga (d. 1189). Married Yaroslav Osmomysl.
** Andrei I Bogolyubsky (c. 1111 – 28 June 1174).
** Maria. Married Oleg II Svyatoslavich, Prince of Novhorod-Siverskyi.
** Sviatoslav (d. 11 January 1174).
** Yaroslav (d. 12 April 1166).
** Gleb of Kiev (d. 1171).
** Boris, Prince of Belgorod and Turov (d. 12 May 1159).
** Mstislav, Prince of Novgorod (d. 1166).
** Vasilko, Prince of Suzdal (deposed in 1161).
* The following are considered youngest and typically attributed to the second wife
** Mikhail of Vladimir (d. 20 June 1176).
** Vsevolod the Big Nest (1154 – 12 April 1212).
** Yaropolk.

==Memorials==

Yuri&#x27;s memory is cherished as the legendary founder of Moscow. His patron saint, Saint George appears on the coat of arms of Moscow slaying a dragon. In 1954, a monument to him designed by sculptor Sergei Orlov was erected on Moscow&#x27;s Tverskaya Street, the city&#x27;s principal avenue, in front of the Moscow municipality.

Dolgoruki&#x27;s image was stamped on the Medal &quot;In Commemoration of the 800th Anniversary of Moscow&quot;, introduced in 1947.

There are monuments of Yuri Dolgorukiy in Dmitrov and Kostroma.

The nuclear submarine &quot;RFS Yury Dolgoruky&quot; is named after him.

<doc id="569572" wikidata="Q1547791" url="?curid=569572" title="Pueblo Revolt">
<text>The Pueblo Revolt of 1680, also known as [[Popé|Popé&#x27;s]] Rebellion or Po&#x27;pay&#x27;s Rebellion, was an uprising of most of the indigenous Pueblo people against the Spanish colonizers in the province of Santa Fe de Nuevo México, larger than present-day New Mexico. Incidents of brutality and cruelty, coupled with persistent Spanish policies such as those that occurred in 1599 and resulted in the Ácoma Massacre, stoked animosity, gave rise to the eventual Revolt of 1680. The persecution and mistreatment of Pueblo people who adhered to traditional religious practices was the most despised of these. Scholars consider it the first Native American religious traditionalist revitalization movement. The Spaniards were resolved to abolish &quot;pagan&quot; forms of worship and replace them with Christianity. The Pueblo Revolt killed 400 Spaniards and drove the remaining 2,000 settlers out of the province. The Spaniards returned to New Mexico twelve years later.

==Background==
For more than 100 years beginning in 1540, the Pueblo people of present-day New Mexico were subjected to successive waves of soldiers, missionaries, and settlers. These encounters, referred to as &quot;entradas&quot; (incursions), were characterized by violent confrontations between Spanish colonists and Pueblo peoples. The Tiguex War, fought in the winter of 1540–41 by the expedition of Francisco Vázquez de Coronado against the twelve or thirteen pueblos of Tiwa Native Americans, was particularly destructive to Pueblo and Spanish relations.

In 1598, Juan de Oñate led 129 soldiers and 10 Franciscan priests, plus a large number of women, children, servants, slaves, and livestock, into the Rio Grande valley of New Mexico. There were at the time approximately 40,000 Pueblo Native Americans inhabiting the region. Oñate put down a revolt at Acoma Pueblo by killing and enslaving hundreds of the Native Americans and sentencing all men 25 or older to have a foot cut off. A troop of seventy soldiers was dispatched to the cliff-top Pueblo of Acoma in 1599 to punish the Pueblo for the killing of twelve Spanish soldiers by a band of warriors. After two days of warfare, almost 600 Acoma men, women, and children were seized and enslaved, with many being legally convicted and disfigured as punishment for crimes against the Spanish Crown. The survivors fled as the Pueblo was destroyed by fire. The harshness with which the Acomas were punished left an unforgettable sense of Spanish cruelty. The Ácoma Massacre would instill fear of and anger at the Spanish in the region for years to come. Franciscan missionaries were assigned to several of the Pueblo towns to Christianize the natives.

Spanish colonial policies in the 1500s regarding the humane treatment of native citizens were often ignored on the northern frontier. With the establishment of the first permanent colonial settlement in 1598, the Pueblos were forced to provide tribute to the colonists in the form of labor, ground corn, and textiles. Encomiendas were soon established by colonists along the Rio Grande, restricting Pueblo access to fertile farmlands and water supplies and placing a heavy burden upon Pueblo labor. Especially egregious to the Pueblo was the assault on their traditional religion. Franciscan priests established theocracies in many of the Pueblo villages. In 1608, when it looked as though Spain might abandon the province, the Franciscans baptized seven thousand Pueblos to try to convince the Crown otherwise. Although the Franciscans initially tolerated manifestations of the old religion as long as the Puebloans attended mass and maintained a public veneer of Catholicism, Fray Alonso de Posada (in New Mexico 1656–1665) outlawed Kachina dances by the Pueblo people and ordered the missionaries to seize and burn their masks, prayer sticks, and effigies. The Franciscan missionaries also forbade the use of entheogenic substances in the traditional religious ceremonies of the Pueblo. Some Spanish officials, such as Nicolás de Aguilar, who attempted to curb the power of the Franciscans were charged with heresy and tried before the Inquisition. The Pueblos by and large resented the missionaries, with the Hopis in particular referring to Spanish priests as &quot;tūtáachi&quot;, &quot;dictator and demanding person.&quot;

In the 1670s drought swept the region, causing a famine among the Pueblo and increased raids by the Apache, which Spanish and Pueblo soldiers were unable to prevent. Fray Alonso de Benavides wrote multiple letters to the King, describing the conditions, noting &quot;the Spanish inhabitants and Indians alike eat hides and straps of carts&quot;. The unrest among the Pueblos came to a head in 1675. Governor Juan Francisco Treviño ordered the arrest of forty-seven Pueblo medicine men and accused them of practicing &quot;sorcery&quot;. Four medicine men were sentenced to death by hanging; three of those sentences were carried out, while the fourth prisoner committed suicide. The remaining men were publicly whipped and sentenced to prison. When this news reached the Pueblo leaders, they moved in force to Santa Fe, where the prisoners were held. Because a large number of Spanish soldiers were away fighting the Apache, Governor Treviño was forced to accede to the Pueblo demand for the release of the prisoners. Among those released was a San Juan (&quot;Ohkay Owingeh&quot; in the Tewa Language) native named &quot;Popé&quot;. However, the incident provides a look, five years before the Revolt, into how Po&#x27;pay came to play such an important role in planning and orchestrating the events of 1680. It becomes clearer to us why Po&#x27;pay was such a credible provocateur and why, over all of two dozen communities speaking six different languages and spread over a nearly 400-mile radius from Taos at one end to the Hopi villages at the other, he was eventually believed and respected if the information presented here about his likely identity as a revered Tewa is accurate. 

==Rebellion==

Following his release, Popé, along with a number of other Pueblo leaders (see list below), planned and orchestrated the Pueblo Revolt. Popé took up residence in Taos Pueblo, about 70 miles north of the capital of Santa Fe, and spent the next five years seeking support for a revolt among the 46 Pueblo towns. He gained the support of the Northern Tiwa, Tewa, Towa, Tano, and Keres-speaking Pueblos of the Rio Grande Valley. Because of the language barrier separating the six tribes, the revolt utilized Spanish as the unofficial &quot;lingua franca.&quot;The Pecos Pueblo, 50 miles east of the Rio Grande pledged its participation in the revolt as did the Zuni and Hopi, 120 and 200 miles respectively west of the Rio Grande. The Pueblos not joining the revolt were the four southern Tiwa (Tiguex) towns near Santa Fe and the Piro Pueblos south of the principal Pueblo population centers near the present day city of Socorro. The southern Tiwa and the Piro were more thoroughly integrated into Spanish culture than the other groups. The Spanish population of about 2,400, of which a plurality were mixed-blood mestizos, along with native servants and retainers, were scattered thinly throughout the region. Santa Fe was the only place that approximated being a town. The Spanish could only muster 170 men with arms. The Pueblos joining the revolt probably had 2,000 or more adult men capable of using native weapons such as the bow and arrow. It is possible that some Apache and Navajo participated in the revolt.
The Pueblo revolt was typical of millenarian movements in colonial societies. Popé promised that, once the Spanish were killed or expelled, the ancient Pueblo gods would reward them with health and prosperity. Popé&#x27;s plan was that the inhabitants of each Pueblo would rise up and kill the Spanish in their area and then all would advance on Santa Fe to kill or expel all the remaining Spanish. The date set for the uprising was August 11, 1680. Popé dispatched runners to all the Pueblos carrying knotted cords. Pedro Omtua and Nicolas Catua were the two young men. On August 8, 1680, two young men from Tesuque set out for Tanogeh (Tano villages) early in the morning. Their first contact occurred in Pecos. Unfortunately, Fray Fernandao De Velasco was informed right away by Christian Indians that two Tewa young men had visited the war chief&#x27;s house. After leaving Pecos, the two Tesuque runners continued on to Galisteo, San Cristobal, and San Marcos.

Each morning the Pueblo leadership was to untie one knot from the cord, and when the last knot was untied, that would be the signal for them to rise against the Spaniards in unison. On August 9, however, the Spaniards were warned of the impending revolt by southern Tiwa leaders and they captured two Tesuque Pueblo youths entrusted with carrying the message to the pueblos. They were tortured to make them reveal the significance of the knotted cord.

Popé then ordered the revolt to begin a day early. The Hopi pueblos located on the remote Hopi Mesas of Arizona did not receive the advanced notice for the beginning of the revolt and followed the schedule for the revolt. On August 10, the Puebloans rose up, stole the Spaniards&#x27; horses to prevent them from fleeing, sealed off roads leading to Santa Fe, and pillaged Spanish settlements. A total of 400 people were killed, including men, women, children, and 21 of the 33 Franciscan missionaries in New Mexico. In the rebellion at &quot;Tusayan&quot; (Hopi) churches at Awatovi, Shungopavi, and Oraibi were destroyed and the attending priests were killed. Survivors fled to Santa Fe and Isleta Pueblo, 10 miles south of Albuquerque and one of the Pueblos that did not participate in the rebellion. By August 13, all the Spanish settlements in New Mexico had been destroyed and Santa Fe was besieged. The Puebloans surrounded the city and cut off its water supply. In desperation, on August 21, New Mexico Governor Antonio de Otermín, barricaded in the Palace of the Governors, sallied outside the palace with all of his available men and forced the Puebloans to retreat with heavy losses. He then led the Spaniards out of the city and retreated southward along the Rio Grande, headed for El Paso del Norte. The Puebloans shadowed the Spaniards but did not attack. The Spaniards who had taken refuge in Isleta had also retreated southward on August 15, and on September 6 the two groups of survivors, numbering 1,946, met at Socorro. About 500 of the survivors were Native American slaves. They were escorted to El Paso by a Spanish supply train. The Puebloans did not block their passage out of New Mexico.

==Popé&#x27;s land ==
The retreat of the Spaniards left New Mexico in the power of the Puebloans. Popé was a mysterious figure in the history of the southwest as there are many tales among the Puebloans of what happened to him after the revolt.

Apparently, Popé and his two lieutenants, Alonso Catiti from Santo Domingo and Luis Tupatu from Picuris, traveled from town to town ordering a return &quot;to the state of their antiquity.&quot; All crosses, churches, and Christian images were to be destroyed. The people were ordered to cleanse themselves in ritual baths, to use their Puebloan names, and to destroy all vestiges of the Roman Catholic religion and Spanish culture, including Spanish livestock and fruit trees. Popé, it was said, forbade the planting of wheat and barley and commanded those natives who had been married according to the rites of the Catholic Church to dismiss their wives and to take others after the old native tradition.

The Puebloans had no tradition of political unity. Popé was a man of trust and strict policy. Therefore, each pueblo was self-governing, and some, or all, apparently resisted Popé&#x27;s demands for a return to a pre-Spanish existence. The paradise Popé had promised when the Spanish were expelled did not materialize. A drought continued, destroying Puebloan crops, and the raids by Apache and Navajo increased. Initially, however, the Puebloans were united in their objective of preventing a return of the Spanish.

Popé was deposed as the leader of the Puebloans about a year after the revolt and disappears from history. He is believed to have died shortly before the Spanish reconquest in 1692.

==Spanish attempt to return==
In November 1681, Antonio de Otermin attempted to return to New Mexico. He assembled a force of 146 Spanish and an equal number of native soldiers in Paso del Norte (now known as Ciudad Juarez) and marched north along the Rio Grande. He first encountered the Piro pueblos, which had been abandoned and their churches destroyed. At Isleta pueblo he fought a brief battle with the inhabitants and then accepted their surrender. Staying in Isleta, he dispatched a company of soldiers and natives to establish Spanish authority. The following year, 1681, Otermin traveled quickly over Pueblo country in an effort to ascertain the reasons behind the uprising and identify its commanders. Some of the captives he had taken responded. Their reply is still regarded as a joke of legend. When questioning several of the Pueblo men who had been taken prisoner, the Spanish governor said, &quot;Tell me, who was the leader of the revolt?&quot; A Keresan captive responded, &quot;Oh, it was Payastiamo.&quot; The governor followed up with, &quot;Where does he live?&quot; &quot;Over that way,&quot; the Keresan remarked, gesturing to the mountains. In response to the same query, a Tewa or Tano man said, &quot;Poheyemo is the leader&#x27;s name. He lives up that way,&quot; pointing in the direction of the mountains to the north. A Towa man responded, &quot;His name is Payastiabo, and he lives up that way,&quot; pointing toward the mountains. The joke is that these are the names of deities to whom the Pueblos pray to intercede for them with the One above, beyond the clouds. The Puebloans feigned surrender while gathering a large force to oppose Otermin. With the threat of a Puebloan attack growing, on January 1, 1682, Otermin decided to return to Paso del Norte, burning pueblos and taking the people of Isleta with him. The first Spanish attempt to regain control of New Mexico had failed.

Some of the Isleta later returned to New Mexico, but others remained in Paso del Norte, living in the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo. The Piro also moved to Paso del Norte to live among the Spaniards, eventually forming part of the Piro, Manso, and Tiwa tribe.

The Spanish were never able to re-convince some Puebloans to join Santa Fe de Nuevo México, and the Spanish often returned seeking peace instead of reconquest. For example, the Hopi remained free of any Spanish attempt at reconquest; though they did, at several non-violent attempts, try for unsuccessful peace treaties and unsuccessful trade agreements. For some Puebloans, the Revolt was a success in its objective to drive away Spanish influence. However, the Pueblos did not mourn the Spaniards&#x27; departure. Food grew scarce; starvation was unavoidable, and raids became increasingly common. Extra care was used to safeguard the food supply of the Pueblos along with their women and children. In 1691 or 1692, a delegation of Pueblo men from Jemez, Zia, Santa Ana, San Felipe, Pecos, and several Tanos traveled to Guadalupe del Paso to negotiate with the expelled Spaniards. According to tribal history, the Pueblo men invited the Spaniards to return.

==Reconquest==

The Spanish return to New Mexico was prompted by their fears of French advances into the Mississippi valley and their desire to create a defensive frontier against the increasingly aggressive nomadic tribes on their northern borders. In August 1692, Diego de Vargas marched to Santa Fe unopposed along with a converted Zia war captain, Bartolomé de Ojeda. De Vargas, with only sixty soldiers, one hundred Indian auxiliaries or native soldiers, seven cannons (which he used as leverage against the Pueblo inside Santa Fe), and one Franciscan priest, arrived at Santa Fe on September 13. He promised the 1,000 Pueblo people assembled there clemency and protection if they would swear allegiance to the King of Spain and return to the Christian faith. After a while the Pueblo rejected the Spaniards. After much persuading, the Spanish finally made the Pueblo agree to peace. On September 14, 1692, de Vargas proclaimed a formal act of repossession. It was the thirteenth town he had reconquered for God and King in this manner, he wrote jubilantly to the Conde de Galve, viceroy of New Spain. During the next month de Vargas visited other Pueblos and accepted their acquiescence to Spanish rule.

Though the 1692 agreement to peace was bloodless, in the years that followed de Vargas maintained increasingly severe control over the increasingly defiant Pueblo. De Vargas returned to Mexico and gathered together about 800 people, including 100 soldiers, and returned to Santa Fe on December 16, 1693. This time, however, 70 Pueblo warriors and 400 family members within the town opposed his entry. De Vargas and his forces staged a quick and bloody recapture that concluded with the surrender and execution of the 70 Pueblo warriors on December 30, and their surviving families (about 400 women and children) were sentenced to ten years&#x27; servitude and distributed to the Spanish colonists as slaves.

In 1696 the residents of fourteen pueblos attempted a second organized revolt, launched with the murders of five missionaries and thirty-four settlers and using weapons the Spanish themselves had traded to the natives over the years; de Vargas&#x27;s retribution was unmerciful, thorough and prolonged. By the end of the century the last resisting Pueblo town had surrendered and the Spanish reconquest was essentially complete. Many of the Pueblos, however, fled New Mexico to join the Apache or Navajo or to attempt to re-settle on the Great Plains. After the Pueblos were defeated, the Picuris—under the leadership of Luis Tupatu—joined their longtime allies, the Jicarilla Apaches, in &quot;El Cuartolejo&quot;, which is now in western Kansas and lies east of Pueblo, Colorado.

While the independence of many pueblos from the Spaniards was short-lived, the Pueblo Revolt gained the Pueblo people a measure of freedom from future Spanish efforts to eradicate their culture and religion following the reconquest. Moreover, the Spanish issued substantial land grants to each Pueblo and appointed a public defender to protect the rights of the Native Americans and argue their legal cases in the Spanish courts. The Franciscan priests returning to New Mexico did not again attempt to impose a theocracy on the Pueblo who continued to practice their traditional religion.

==Rise of Great Plains horse cultures==
The revolt may have increased the spread of horses onto the Great Plains when the Pueblos seized the livestock abandoned by the fleeing Spaniards, although genetic and archaeological studies indicate that a native horse culture was already widely established by the first half of the 17th century.

==In popular culture ==

The 1994 &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; references the Pueblo Revolt, in the context of ancestors of different characters having been involved in the revolt.

In 1995, in Albuquerque, La Compañía de Teatro de Albuquerque produced the bilingual play &quot;Casi Hermanos&quot;, written by Ramon Flores and James Lujan. It depicted events leading up to the Pueblo Revolt, inspired by accounts of two half-brothers who met on opposite sides of the battlefield.

A statue of Po&#x27;Pay by sculptor Cliff Fragua was added to the National Statuary Hall Collection in the United States Capitol Building in 2005 as one of New Mexico&#x27;s two statues. The knotted cord in his left hand was used to time the start of the revolt. Although the exact number of knots utilized is up for debate, (sculptor Cliff Fragua) believes that planning and informing the majority of the Pueblos must have taken many days. The bear fetish in his right hand represents the Pueblo religion, which is the center of the Pueblo universe. The pot behind him represents Pueblo culture, and the deer hide he wears is a humble representation of his role as a provider. The necklace he wears serves as a continual reminder of where life began, and he dresses in Pueblo style, with a loin cloth and moccasins. His hair is cut in the Pueblo style and wrapped in a &quot;chongo&quot;. The scars left over from the whipping he endured for his involvement in and devotion to Pueblo customs and religion are on his back.

In 2005, in Los Angeles, Native Voices at the Autry produced &quot;Kino and Teresa&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; written by Taos Pueblo playwright James Lujan. Set five years after the Spanish Reconquest of 1692, the play links actual historical figures with their literary counterparts to dramatize how both sides learned to live together and form the culture that is present-day New Mexico.

In 2011, Taos Pueblo singer Robert Mirabal&#x27;s new one-man show, &quot;Po&#x27;pay Speaks,&quot; was advertised as &quot;a dramatic presentation of the history and continuing influence of the great leader of the 1680 Pueblo revolt.&quot; According to the original script, which Mirabal, Steve Parks, and Nelson Zink of Taos wrote, Po&#x27;pay never died. He has been living in seclusion in the mountains for the entire time, observing the oddities of history as it has been shaped by the individuals he assisted in rescuing 331 years ago.

In 2016, Jason Garcia (Okuu Pin-Turtle Mountain) created artwork to capture the ever-changing cultural landscape of Santa Clara Pueblo, New Mexico. Garcia&#x27;s art is influenced by Tewa traditional rites, customs, and storytelling, as well as 21st-century popular culture, comic books and technology. Garcia uses comic books as a medium for expression in his clay tile &quot;Tewa Tales of Suspense!&quot; A muscled Po&#x27;Pay towers over the helmeted conquistadors as a mission chapel burns. A close examination of his &quot;Corn Dance Girls&quot; jar reveals a satellite TV antenna emerging from the Pueblo behind the figures.

In 2018, Virgil Ortiz of (Cochiti Pueblo), began making ceramic work about the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 within a science fiction narrative that proposes that in the year 2180, a second Pueblo Revolt takes place that is led by a female warrior. The project later developed to include video, performance, costume design, and photography and augmented reality. The work has been described as hyper-fiction, involving &quot;shape-shifting, time-jumping, sci-fi fantasy&quot; re-telling of the Revolt. 

In 2023, in Berkeley, Alter Theater Ensemble produced the world premiere of, &quot;Pueblo Revolt&quot;, a Rella Lossy Award winning play written by Mississippi Choctaw, Laguna Pueblo, and Isleta Pueblo playwright Dillon Chitto. A comedy about two Indigenous brothers living in Isleta Pueblo before, during, and after the revolt, the play asks, &quot;When history is in the making, what do ordinary people do?&quot;.

<text>BBC Radio Nottingham is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the county of Nottinghamshire.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios on London Road in Nottingham city centre.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 124,000 listeners and a 4.4% share as of December 2023.

==Technical==
Radio Nottingham is broadcast on three FM frequencies:

* 103.8 to Nottingham and south Nottinghamshire, from Mapperley Ridge in north Nottingham
* 95.5 to Mansfield and Ashfield, from Fishponds Hill
* 95.1 to Newark from Beacon Hill (since January 2004)

The Mansfield signal is strong enough to be heard as far north as Scunthorpe, far outside Nottinghamshire. The Nottingham signal may be heard as far south as Leicester.

Since 30 April 2004, the station has been available on DAB from the NDEM (NOW Digital East Midlands) Nottingham 12C multiplex from Waltham (main signal and in Leicestershire), Mapperley Ridge and Fishponds Hill (since July 2006).

The station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 712 in both the BBC East Midlands region and the BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire region and streams online via BBC Sounds.

The station used to broadcast an AM medium wave signal on 1584 kHz, from Clipstone, near Mansfield, until 25 January 2018 when the transmitter was turned off. This followed a trial, to determine if listeners would miss or complain about the loss of services on medium wave, from 17 August to 24 September 2012 when BBC Radio Nottingham stopped broadcasting its programmes on medium wave, instead directing listeners to FM or DAB.

North Nottinghamshire, covering the district of Bassetlaw including the towns of Retford and Worksop, is officially covered by BBC Radio Sheffield on 104.1 FM from the Holme Moss transmitter. Although editorially, news for this area is covered by BBC Radio Nottingham, and FM reception (and to a lesser extent, DAB and Freeview) is possible in these areas.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Nottingham studios from 6 am to 2 pm on Mondays to Fridays and for sports coverage.
The 10 pm to 1 am late show originates from BBC Radio Manchester or BBC Radio London. At weekends and on weekdays afternoons, much of the station&#x27;s output is simulcast with BBC Radio Derby and BBC Radio Leicester.

During the station&#x27;s downtime, BBC Radio Nottingham simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live.

<text>Ram Janmabhoomi () is the site that, according to Hindu religious beliefs, is the birthplace of Rama, the seventh avatar of the Hindu deity Vishnu. The Ramayana states that the location of Rama&#x27;s birthplace is on the banks of the Sarayu river in a city called &quot;Ayodhya&quot;. Modern-day Ayodhya is in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is contested whether the Ayodhya mentioned in the Ramayana is the same as the modern city.

Some Hindus claim that the exact site of Rama&#x27;s birthplace is within the grounds where the Babri Masjid once stood in the present-day Ayodhya, with this belief extending back to at least 1822. It has been suggested that a temple to Rama formerly existed at the same site as the Babri Masjid until it was replaced by the mosque, an idea supported by a court-ordered report of the Archaeological Survey of India following archaeological excavations around the ruins of the mosque, though the existence of this temple and the conclusions of the report are disputed.

Idols of Rama and Sita were placed in the mosque in 1949 and devotees began to gather from the next day. In 1992, the demolition of the Babri Masjid by Hindu nationalists triggered widespread Hindu-Muslim violence. The legal dispute over the property reached the Indian Supreme Court, which ruled in November 2019 that the property be handed to a trust to construct a Hindu temple.

== Historical significance ==
The &quot;Ramayana&quot;, a Hindu epic whose earliest portions date back to 1st millennium BCE, states that the capital of Rama was &quot;Ayodhya&quot;, which may not be the same as modern Ayodhya According to the local Hindu belief, the site of the now-demolished Babri Mosque in Ayodhya is the exact birthplace of Rama. The Babri mosque is believed to have been constructed during 1528–29 by a certain &#x27;Mir Baqi&#x27; (possibly Baqi Tashqandi), who was a commander of the Mughal emperor Babur (1526–1530).

In 1611, an English traveller William Finch visited Ayodhya and recorded the &quot;ruins of the Ranichand [Ramachand] castle and houses&quot;. He made no mention of a mosque. In 1634, Thomas Herbert described a &quot;pretty old castle of Ranichand [Ramachand]&quot; which he described as an antique monument that was &quot;especially memorable&quot;. However, by 1672, the appearance of a mosque at the site can be inferred because Lal Das&#x27;s &quot;Awadh-Vilasa&quot; describes the location without mentioning a castle, house or temple. In 1717, the Moghul Rajput noble Jai Singh II purchased land surrounding the site and his documents show a mosque.
The Jesuit missionary Joseph Tiefenthaler, who visited the site between 1766 and 1771, wrote that either Aurangazeb (1658–1707) or Babur had demolished the Ramkot fortress, including the house that was considered as the birthplace of Rama by Hindus. He further stated that a mosque was constructed in its place, but the Hindus continued to offer prayers at a mud platform that marked the birthplace of Rama. In 1810, Francis Buchanan visited the site, and stated that the structure destroyed was a temple dedicated to Rama, not a house. Many subsequent sources state that the mosque was constructed after demolishing a temple. Buchanan also recorded that there was an inscription on the wall of the mosque stating it to have been built by Babur.

Police officer and writer Kishore Kunal, who examined Buchanan&#x27;s documents, states that all the claimed inscriptions on the Babri mosque were fake. According to him they were affixed sometime around 1813 (almost 285 years after the supposed construction of the mosque in 1528 CE), and later repeatedly replaced.

Before the 1940s, the Babri Masjid was called &quot;Masjid-i-Janmasthan&quot; (&quot;mosque of the birthplace&quot;) in common parlance as well as official documents such as revenue records. Shykh Muhammad Azamat Ali Kakorawi Nami (1811–1893) wrote: &quot;the Babari mosque was built up in 923(?) A.H. under the patronage of Sayyid Musa Ashiqan in the Janmasthan temple in Faizabad-Avadh, which was a great place of (worship) and capital of Rama&#x27;s father.&quot;

H.R. Neville, the editor of the &quot;Faizabad District Gazetteer&quot; (1870), wrote that the Janmasthan temple &quot;was destroyed by Babur and replaced by a mosque.&quot; He also wrote &quot;The Janmasthan was in Ramkot and marked the birthplace of Rama. In 1528 A.D. Babur came to Ayodhya and halted here for a week. He destroyed the ancient temple and on its site built a mosque, still known as Babur&#x27;s mosque. The materials of the old structure [i.e., the temple] were largely employed, and many of the columns were in good preservation.&quot;

Al-Hind-u fi al – ‘Ahd al-Isami, by Maulana Shams Tabriz Khan describes &quot;And among them is the great mosque that was built by the Timurid king Babar in the sacred city of Ajodhya. It is believed that Rama Chandra, considered to be the manifestation of God, was born here. There is a long story about his wife Sita. There was a big temple for them in this city. At a certain place Sita used to sit and cook food for her consort. Well, the said king Babar demolished it and built a mosque at that very place with chiseled stone in 923 A.H.&quot;

=== Opposition to the claim ===
A section of historians, such as R. S. Sharma, state that such claims of Babri Masjid site being the birthplace of Rama sprang up only after the 18th century and Janmabhoomi&#x27;s location given in the various &quot;Ayodhya-mahatmyas&quot; does not tally with the Babri Masjid location. Sharma states that Ayodhya emerged as a place of Hindu pilgrimage only in medieval times, since ancient texts do not mention it as a pilgrim centre. For example, chapter 85 of the &quot;Vishnu Smriti&quot; (contains the earliest list of tirthas) lists 52 places of pilgrimage, which do not include Ayodhya.

Many critics also claim that the present-day Ayodhya was originally a Buddhist site, based on its identification with Saketa described in Buddhist texts. According to historian Romila Thapar, ignoring the Hindu mythological accounts, the first historic mention of the city dates back to the 7th century, when the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang described it as a Buddhist site.

=== Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir ===

In 1853, a group of armed Hindu ascetics belonging to the Nirmohi Akhara occupied the Babri Masjid site, and claimed ownership of the structure. Subsequently, the civil administration stepped in, and in 1855, divided the mosque premises into two parts: one for Hindus, and the other for Muslims.

In 1883, the Hindus launched an effort to construct a temple on the platform. When the administration denied them the permission to do this, they took the matter to court. In 1885, the Sub Judge Pandit Hari Kishan Singh dismissed the lawsuit. Subsequently, the higher courts also dismissed the lawsuit in 1886, in favour of status quo. The lawsuit was dismissed on the grounds that creating a Hindu temple in close proximity to mosque would create a serious law and order issue. The District Judge held that it was ―most unfortunate that the Masjid should have been built on the land especially held sacred by the Hindus but since the construction had been made 358 years earlier, it was too late in the day to reverse the process.

In December 1949, some Hindus placed idols of Rama and Sita in the mosque, and claimed that they had miraculously appeared there. Home Minister Vallabhbhai Patel and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru directed the state&#x27;s Chief Minister Govind Ballabh Pant to remove the idols, however Pant was not willing to remove the idols and added that &quot;there is a reasonable chance of success, but things are still in a fluid state and it will be hazardous to say more at this stage&quot;. By 1950, the state took control of the structure under section 145 CrPC and allowed Hindus, not Muslims, to perform their worship at the site.

In the 1980s, the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) and other Hindu nationalist groups and political parties launched a campaign to construct the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir (&quot;Rama birthplace temple&quot;) at the site. In 1985, the Rajiv Gandhi government allowed Hindus to access the site for prayers. On 6 December 1992, Hindu nationalists demolished the mosque, resulting in communal riots leading to over 2,000 deaths.

In 2003, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) conducted excavations of the site on court orders. The ASI report indicated the presence of a 10th-century north Indian style temple under the mosque. Muslim groups and the historians supporting them disputed these findings, and dismissed them as politically motivated. The Allahabad High Court, however, upheld the ASI&#x27;s findings. The excavations by the ASI were heavily used as evidence by the court that the predating structure was a massive Hindu religious building.

In 2009, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) released its election manifesto, repeating its promise to construct a temple to Rama at the site.

In 2010, the Allahabad High Court ruled that the of disputed land be divided into 3 parts, with going to the Ram Lalla or Infant Lord Rama represented by the Hindu Mahasabha for the construction of the Ram temple, going to the Muslim Sunni Waqf Board and the remaining going to a Hindu religious denomination Nirmohi Akhara. All the three parties appealed against the division of disputed land to the Supreme Court.

The five judges Supreme Court bench heard the title dispute cases from August to October 2019. The court inferred that the foundation of the mosque was based on the walls of a large pre existing structure dating back to the 12th century whose architectural features are suggestive of Hindu religious origin. The Supreme Court however concluded that there is time gap between the existence of the pre existing structure in 12th century and the construction of mosque in 16th century and no archaeological evidence on the cause of destruction of the underlying structure from this era is available. On 9 November 2019, the Supreme Court ordered the land to be handed over to a trust to build the Hindu temple. It also ordered to the government to give alternate 5 acre land to Sunni Waqf Board to build the mosque. On 5 February 2020, the trust known as Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra was created by the government of India.

== Other places ==

Those who believe that Rama was a historic figure, place his birth around 1800 BCE. However, the archaeological excavations at Ayodhya have not revealed any significant settlement before 500 BCE. Consequently, a number of other places have been suggested as the birthplace of Rama.

In November 1990, the newly appointed Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar made an attempt to resolve the Ayodhya dispute amicably. Towards this objective, he asked Hindu and Muslim groups to exchange evidence on their claims over Ayodhya. The panel representing the Muslim organization Babri Masjid Action Committee (BMAC) included R. S. Sharma, D. N. Jha, M. Athar Ali and Suraj Bhan. The evidence presented by them included scholarly articles discussing alternative theories about the birthplace of Rama. These sources mentioned 8 different possible birthplaces, including a site other than Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, Nepal and Afghanistan. One author – M. V. Ratnam – claimed that Rama was Ramses II, a pharaoh of ancient Egypt.

In his 1992 book &quot;Ancient geography of Ayodhya&quot;, historian Shyam Narain Pande argued that Rama was born around present-day Herat in Afghanistan. In 1997, Pande presented his theory in the paper &quot;Historical Rama distinguished from God Rama&quot; at the 58th session of the Indian History Congress in Bangalore. In 2000, Rajesh Kochhar similarly traced the birthplace of Rama to Afghanistan, in his book &quot;The Vedic People: Their History and Geography&quot;. According to him, the Harriud river of Afghanistan is the original &quot;Sarayu&quot;, and Ayodhya was located on its banks.

In 1998, archaeologist Krishna Rao put forward his hypothesis about Banawali being Rama&#x27;s birthplace. Banawali is an Harappan site located in the Haryana state of India. Rao identified Rama with the Sumerian king Rim-Sin I and his rival Ravana with the Babylonian king Hammurabi. He claimed to have deciphered Indus seals found along the Sarasvati rivers, and found the words &quot;Rama Sena&quot; (Rim-Sin) and &quot;Ravani dama&quot; on those seals. He rejected Ayodhya as the birthplace of Rama, on the grounds that Ayodhya and other Ramayana sites excavated by B. B. Lal do not show evidence of settlements before 1000 BCE. He also claimed that the writers of the later epics and the Puranas got confused because the ancient Indo-Aryans applied their ancient place names to the new place names as they migrated eastwards.

==Archaeological Survey of India - Evidences==

=== First Excavation ===
A team from the Archaeological Survey of India under B. B. Lal conducted a survey of the land in 1976–77. They found 12 pillars of the mosque that were made from the remains of a Hindu temple. The base of the pillars had a Purna Kalasha which was a &#x27;ghada&#x27; (water pitcher) from which foliage would be coming out. These symbols were found in almost all the temples of the 12th and 13th Century. For Hindus, it is one of the eight auspicious symbols of prosperity also known as Ashtamangala Chinha. The excavation team found many terracotta sculptures that depicted human beings and animals, a characteristic of a temple, not a mosque.

=== Second excavation ===
In 2003, A 50 plus member team of Archeological Survey of India did the second excavation. They found over 50 pillars, hinting that below the mosque stood a Hindu temple that could be dated back to the 12th Century AD.

==== Temple Pranali ====
The excavators further found a temple system that depicted a crocodile (a symbol of the Holy Ganga) to signify a symbolic bath in the holy rivers of the Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati to wash off one&#x27;s sins. They also got the temple &#x27;pranali&#x27; (system). We have to bathe the deity and the &#x27;abhisheka jal&#x27; flows through &#x27;pranali&#x27;. This &#x27;makara pranali&#x27; was also excavated.

==== Kalasha, Amalkam Grivaha and Shikhara ====
The ASI team unearthed several remains of a temple&#x27;s &#x27;shikhara&#x27; (tower) from the mosque&#x27;s premises, adding to the evidences of a Hindu structure underneath ASI team also found another architectural member known as &#x27;amalka&#x27;. Below the &#x27;amalka&#x27; there is the &#x27;grivah&#x27; and also the &#x27;shikhara&#x27; portion of the temple in North India.

==== Terracotta remains ====
The ASI archaeologists found 263 pieces of terracotta objects of gods, goddesses, human figures, female figurines that consolidated the theory that it was the site of a temple.

==== Vishnu Hari Shila Phalak ====
An inscription of &#x27;Vishnu Hari Shila Phalak&#x27; was found on two remains found at the site that proved to be an important circumstantial evidence that stated the existence of a Hindu temple there.
2023 excavations to construct new Rama Temple

In 2023, during excavation to make Rama temple after Supreme Court order, remains of ancient temple, idols, and pillars were found.

In 2024, BR Mani, the archaeologist who led the 2003 excavations urged the central government to release the ASI report to put all the doubts regarding the report to rest. He also interprets the evidence from excavations to claim that there was human force involved in the destruction of the found structure and the structure was not destroyed because of any natural calamity. He claims the destruction took place at about the same time when mosque was being built. Further, he says the court didn&#x27;t comment on whether the destruction took place because ASI report was only meant to report findings and not interpret those findings. He said that excavations show that the history of the site can be traced back to 17th century BCE which contradicts the earlier scholarly claim that history of Ayodhya started at 7th century BCE 

== Construction of Ram Mandir ==


The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust began the first phase of construction of the Ram Mandir in March 2020. Prime Minister Narendra Modi performed Bhoomi Pujan and laid the foundation stone of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya on 5 August 2020.

<doc id="569584" wikidata="Q5454218" url="?curid=569584" title="List of claimed first novels in English">
<text>A number of works of literature have been claimed to be the first novel in English.

==List of candidates==
* Thomas Malory, &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Le Morte Darthur&quot;), (written c. 1470, published 1485)
* William Baldwin, &quot;Beware the Cat&quot;, (written 1553, published 1570, 1584)
* John Lyly, &quot;Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit&quot; (1578) and &quot;Euphues and his England&quot; (1580) 
* Philip Sidney, &quot;The Countess of Pembroke&#x27;s Arcadia&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Arcadia&quot;) (1581)
* Margaret Cavendish, &quot;The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World,&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Blazing World&quot;) (1666)
* John Bunyan, &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress from This World, to That Which Is to Come&quot; (1678)
* Aphra Behn, &quot;Oroonoko: or, the Royal Slave&quot; (1688)
*Anonymous, &quot;Vertue Rewarded&quot; (1693)
* Daniel Defoe, &quot;The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;) (1719) and &quot;The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe&quot; (also 1719)
* Samuel Richardson, &quot;Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded&quot; (1740)

==Other relevant works== 
The following are other early long works of prose fiction in English not generally considered novels:

* William Caxton&#x27;s 1483 translation of Geoffroy de la Tour Landry, &quot;The Book of the Knight of the Tower&quot; (originally in French)
* Martin Marprelate, an anonymous pseudonym authoring a collection of eight illegal, serialized narratives: “Epistle,” “Epitome,” “Hay Any Work,” “Metaphysical School-points,” “Theses Martinianae,” “Just Censure,” “More Work for Cooper,” and “The Protestation” (1588-1589)
* Thomas Nashe, &quot;The Unfortunate Traveller, or The Life of Jack Wilton&quot; (1594)
* Jonathan Swift, &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot; (1704)
* Daniel Defoe, &quot;The Consolidator&quot; (1705)
* Jonathan Swift, &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1726)

==Differing definitions of novel==
There are multiple candidates for first novel in English partly because of ignorance of earlier works, but largely because the term novel can be defined so as to exclude earlier candidates. (The article for novel contains detailed information on the history of the terms &quot;novel&quot; and &quot;romance&quot; and the bodies of texts they defined in a historical perspective.)

===Length===
* Critics typically require a novel to have a certain length. This would exclude &quot;Oroonoko&quot;, arguably a novella.

===Content and intent===
* Critics typically require a novel to be &quot;wholly original&quot; and so exclude retellings such as &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;.
* Critics typically make a distinction between collections of short stories, even those sharing common themes and settings, and novels per se, which typically has a single protagonist and narrative throughout. This might also lead to the exclusion of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;.
* Critics typically distinguish between the romance, which has a heroic protagonist and fantastic elements, and the novel, which attempts to present a realistic story. This would, yet again, exclude &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;.
* Critics typically distinguish between the allegory (in which characters and events have political, religious or other meanings) and the novel, in which characters and events stand only for themselves, and so exclude &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; and &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot;.
* Critics typically distinguish between the picaresque, made up of a connected sequence of episodes, and the novel, which has unity of structure, and so exclude &quot;The Unfortunate Traveller&quot;.

Owing to the influence of Ian Watt&#x27;s seminal study in literary sociology, &quot;The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding&quot; (1957), Watt&#x27;s candidate, Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; (1719), gained wide acceptance.

<text>Cricqueville-en-Bessin (, literally &quot;Cricqueville in Bessin&quot;) is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France.

The municipality takes its name from its deep-water creek that forms a natural harbor, from Crycavilla.

==History==
===World War II===
Just outside Cricqueville, the United States Army Air Forces established an airfield shortly after D-Day on 9 June 1944, just three days after the Allied landings in France. The airfield was one of the first established in the liberated area of Normandy. Known as Advanced Landing Ground &quot;A-2&quot; (Cricqueville), it was used from early June though September 1944. After the Americans moved east into Central France, the airfield was dismantled and the land returned to agricultural use.

<doc id="569595" wikidata="Q392703" url="?curid=569595" title="The National Archives (United Kingdom)">
<text>The National Archives (TNA; ) is a non-ministerial department of the Government of the United Kingdom. Its parent department is the Department for Culture, Media and Sport of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It is the official national archive of the UK Government and for England and Wales; and &quot;guardian of some of the nation&#x27;s most iconic documents, dating back more than 1,000 years.&quot; There are separate national archives for Scotland (the National Records of Scotland) and Northern Ireland (the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland).

TNA was formerly four separate organisations: the Public Record Office (PRO), the Historical Manuscripts Commission, the Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) and His Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office (HMSO). The Public Record Office still exists as a legal entity, as the enabling legislation has not been modified, and documents held by the institution thus continue to be cited by many scholars as part of the PRO. Since 2008, TNA has also hosted the former UK Statute Law Database, now known as legislation.gov.uk, and since 2022 has hosted a case law database for decisions from superior courts of record since 2003, called Find Case Law.

The department is the responsibility of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Sport, Media, Civil Society and Youth; a minister in His Majesty&#x27;s Government.

==Location==
The National Archives is based in Kew in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames in south-west London. The building was opened in 1977 as an additional home for the public records, which were held in a building on Chancery Lane. The site was originally a World War I hospital, which was later used by several government departments. It is near to Kew Gardens Underground station.

Until its closure in March 2008, the Family Records Centre in Islington was run jointly by The National Archives and the General Register Office. The National Archives has an additional office in Norwich, which is primarily for former OPSI staff. There is also an additional record storage facility (DeepStore) in the worked-out parts of Winsford Rock Salt Mine, Winsford, Cheshire.

==History==
The National Archives was created in 2003 by combining the Public Record Office and the Historical Manuscripts Commission and is a non-ministerial department reporting to the Minister of State for digital policy.

On 31 October 2006, The National Archives merged with the Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI), which itself also contained His Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office (HMSO) which was previously a part of the Cabinet Office. The name remained &quot;The National Archives&quot;.

==Chief Executive and Keeper==
*1991–2005: Sarah Tyacke
*2005–2010: Natalie Ceeney
*2010–2013: Oliver Morley
*2013–2014: Clem Brohier &quot;(acting)&quot;
*2014–2024: Jeff James
*2024–present: Saul Nassé

==Key roles==

TNA claims it is &quot;at the heart of information policy—setting standards and supporting innovation in information and records management across the UK, and providing a practical framework of best practice for opening up and encouraging the re-use of public sector information. This work helps inform today&#x27;s decisions and ensure that they become tomorrow&#x27;s permanent record.&quot;
It has a number of key roles in information policy:
* Policy – advising government on information practice and policy, on issues from record creation through to its reuse
* Selection – selecting which documents to store
* Preservation – ensuring the documents remain in as good a condition as possible
* Access – providing the public with the opportunity to view the documents
* Advice – advising the public and other archives and archivists around the world on how to care for documents
* Intellectual property management – TNA (via OPSI and HMSO) manages crown copyright for the UK
* Regulation – ensuring that other public sector organisations adhere to both the public records act and the PSI reuse regulations.

==Sector leadership==
The National Archives (and before it the Public Record Office) has long had a role of oversight and leadership for the entire archives sector and archives profession in the UK, including local government and non-governmental archives. Under the Public Records Act 1958 it is responsible for overseeing the appropriate custody of certain non-governmental public records in England and Wales. Under the 2003 Historical Manuscripts Commission Warrant it has responsibility for investigating and reporting on non-governmental records and archives of all kinds throughout the United Kingdom. In October 2011, when the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council was wound up, TNA took over its responsibilities in respect of archives in England, including providing information and advice to ministers on archives policy. The National Archives now sees this part of its role as being &quot;to enhance the &#x27;archival health of the nation&#x27;&quot;.

==Collections==

===Types of records===
The National Archives is His Majesty&#x27;s Government&#x27;s official archive, &quot;containing 1000 years of history from Domesday Book to the present&quot;, with records from parchment and paper scrolls through to digital files and archived websites. The material held at Kew includes the following:

*Documents from the central courts of law from the twelfth century onwards, including the Court of King&#x27;s Bench, the Court of Common Pleas, the Court of Chancery, the Court of Exchequer, the Supreme Court of Judicature, the Central Criminal Court, Assizes, and many other courts

===Access to documents===
The collections held by the National Archives can be searched using Discovery, the name given to the online catalogue of the holdings of TNA.

Entrance to The National Archives is free. The Research and Enquiries Room on the first floor contains a large number of desktop computer terminals. In addition, it is possible to bring your own device and to access wi-fi. Close by are the shelves of the reference library. Elsewhere on the first floor and the second floor are the reading room and map room, for conventional and oversized documents respectively. Access to these reading rooms is restricted to those persons with reader tickets, and there are rules on what can be taken in.

Anybody aged 16 or over can access the original documents at the Kew site, after producing two acceptable proofs of identity and being issued a free reader&#x27;s ticket. The reading rooms have terminals from which documents can be ordered up from secure storage areas by their reference number. The reference number is composed of three sections: the department code of up to four letters, such as WO for the War Office; a series or class number, for the &quot;subcategory&quot; or collection that the document comes from; and an individual document number. Documents can also be ordered several days in advance of a visit.

Once a same-day document order has been placed, The National Archives aims to get it to the reader within 45 minutes (assuming it is kept at Kew rather than at their second repository, &quot;Deep Store&quot; – a former salt mine in Cheshire: it can take 2–3 days for files to be retrieved from the latter). Special arrangements are in place for readers wishing to retrieve large groups of files as bulk orders placed in advance.

As of 2011, some of the most popular documents had been digitised and were available to download from Discovery, for a fee of £3.50 per file, or through co-branded services called licensed Internet associates (LIA) as pay per view or part of their subscription service. On 22 April 2020, it was announced that a monthly quota of free downloads from Discovery would be made available to registered users, instead of £3.50 per downloaded file. As at August 2023 there are three licensing partners with Licensing Internet Associate agreements still in place: Ancestry.com, Findmypast and TheGenealogist.

A reader&#x27;s ticket is not needed to access digitised records. Whilst a visitor is on the premises, they can be accessed for free on a terminal, or via a wi-fi connection, where the paywall on the network has been disabled. Frequently accessed documents such as the Abdication Papers had originally been captured on microfilm, as were the aggregated service records for two million First World War soldiers. (See section further down.) As part of its digitisation programme, microfilm was eliminated, and replaced by digital files, some of which were free to download.

Researchers are encouraged to check Discovery first, to see if they can get what they want online, via the portal or a third party provider. If a document is available online, The National Archives&#x27;s policy is to encourage people to use the digital copy (surrogate) and not the original, even if they come to Kew, in order to protect the original from damage. In extreme circumstances, such as where the black and white image of the original was on microfilm, then was transferred to a digital file, and resultant image decay has rendered the finer points illegible, an original document can be retrieved.

It will be clearly stated in the catalogue entry if the record has not been digitised.

====British Army &quot;Burnt records&quot; 1914 to 1919====
Over six million sets of these papers were stored in a War Office warehouse in London, along with a multitude of other record sets, but incendiary bombs dropped on the warehouse in the Second World War started a fire in which most were destroyed. The surviving quartile were largely water or fire-damaged and thus acquired the colloquial name of the &quot;Burnt Documents.&quot; As they were mostly too fragile for public access, they were put on microfilm with the aid of the Heritage Lottery Fund. This activity commenced in 1996 and concluded in 2003. They were converted to digital image files and were made available on the Ancestry website from 2008 onwards. These are archive series WO 363.

====British Army &quot;Unburnt records&quot; 1914 to 1919====
Some service record papers were held elsewhere by the Ministry of Pensions, and were unaffected by the warehouse fire. These records were also microfilmed, and duly converted to digital files and were made available on the Ancestry website from 2008 onwards. These are archive series WO 364.

====British Army service records 1920 to 1963====
For several years beforehand, the future transfer of the records was being talked about. In February 2021 the Ministry of Defence commenced transferring 9.7 million military records for individuals with a discharge date before 31 December 1963 to The National Archives UK, its largest record transfer in the history of the organization. The first batch of records were added to the Discovery catalogue in April 2022. Since then, these records can be physically consulted in the invigilation room. A minimum of four business days advance notice is currently required when ordering these records, which are currently held offsite.

In March 2023, Ancestry announced that it had won a contract to digitize over 3 million British Army service records, which it would release from 2024 through 2029.

===Storage===
The documents are stored on mobile shelving – double-sided shelves, which are pushed together so that there is no aisle between them. A large handle on the end of each shelf allows them to be moved along tracks in the floor to create an aisle when needed.

They are generally stored in acid-free folders or boxes.

In the event of a fire The National Archives would be clearly unable to use sprinklers for fear of ruining its holdings, and so when the building is evacuated, argon gas is released into the air-tight repositories.

==Other services==
The National Archives also provides services to help users in their research and also find collections beyond those it holds.

===Education===

The National Archives&#x27;s education web page is a free online resource for teaching and learning history, aimed at teachers and students. Users can select time periods they are interested in, from the medieval era to the present day. Each time period contains sub-topics with various materials that can be used as teaching tools for teachers. Resources for students focus primarily on tips for research and writing using archival materials.

===&quot;Access to Archives&quot;===
Access to Archives (also known as A2A) is a database containing details of archival collections held in many different archive repositories in England and Wales. As of March 2008, there are no more plans to add additional collections to A2A due to lack of funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the changing financial priorities of The National Archives, but existing entries can still be updated. The A2A database was transferred to The National Archives with a new platform with a simpler interface to ensure its availability.

===National Register of Archives===

The National Register of Archives (NRA) is the central point for the collection and circulation of information about the content and nature of archival manuscripts relating to British history. It contains published and unpublished lists and catalogues describing archival collections in the UK and overseas: currently over 44,000 such catalogues are included. The register can be consulted in the National Archives reading room and the index used to be searchable as an online database on the National Archives web site.

The information is collected in a variety of ways. TNA is sent hard-copy catalogues from archive repositories holding records relating to British history. These are kept in the reading room at The National Archives and indexed in the online database. TNA conducts an annual survey of archive repositories and records all new accessions, and the accession lists are also available on TNA&#x27;s website. Information is also obtained from surveys and guides to archival collections, and other publications.

The Register includes name indexes to its contents (covering corporate names, personal names, family names, and place names); but not subject or thematic indexes. Where the catalogues are themselves available online the indexes provide direct electronic links; but many still exist in hard copy only (often as unpublished &quot;grey literature&quot;), and it remains necessary for the researcher to visit either TNA or the specific repository in order to consult them.

A separate National Register of Archives for Scotland is maintained at the National Archives of Scotland, but its contents are duplicated within the NRA at Kew.

===ARCHON directory===
ARCHON Directory is a database of contact details for archive repositories in the UK and institutions elsewhere in the world which have substantial collections of manuscripts relating to British history.

===&quot;Your Archives&quot;===
Your Archives was a wiki for the National Archives on-line community which was launched in May 2007; it was closed for editing on 30 September 2012 in preparation of archiving on the Government web archive. The contributions were made by users to give additional information to that which is available on the other services provided by the National Archives, including the catalogue, research guides, documentonline and National Register of Archive. Your Archives encouraged users to create articles not only about historical records held by the National Archives, but those held in other archive repositories.

Instead, since 2014, it has been possible for users of Discovery to add metadata tags to catalogue items. This has become the new means by which members of the user community can contribute via crowdsourcing.

===Databases===
The National Archives also hosts several databases on types of records including hospital records; migration records; and manorial records.

Working with the Wellcome Library, TNA has made hospital records available via the Hospital Records Database. The Hospital Records Database has not been updated since 2012, and there are no current updates occurring as of 2018.

The Manorial Documents Register includes records relating to manors located in England and Wales. Digitization of the records is on-going as of 2018.

===Civil Pages===
The National Archives operates the Civil Pages project on behalf of the Cabinet Office, operating as an online directory for the civil service, facilitating working together and providing a means of sharing knowledge securely between government departments.

===Smartphone applications===

In January 2011 The National Archives, in conjunction with historian Nick Barratt and smartphone applications development studio RevelMob, developed its first Old Money iPhone app, which uses historic price data from documents held at The National Archives to see what a sum of money from the past (from 1270) would be worth today and the spending power it would have commanded at the time.

In September 2011, TNA&#x27;s museum began using QRpedia codes, which can be scanned by smartphone users in order to retrieve information about exhibits from Wikipedia.

=== Blogs and podcasts ===
TNA regularly posts blogs to its website. Posts cover a wide range of topics, from specific events and time periods to features on holdings in TNA, as well as information on the archive&#x27;s operations.

The &quot;Archives Media Player&quot; section holds videos and podcasts created and posted by TNA. Videos and audio are not posted as regularly as TNA&#x27;s blog.

===Strategic plans for the future===
====Archives Inspire 2015–19====

Archives Inspire was a strategy document that set out the goals and priorities of the organisation over four years, from 2015 onwards.

====Archives for Everyone====
Our plans 2019–23

Our plans 2023–27

== Lost and misplaced records ==
Between 2005 and 2011, over 1500 files had been reported missing from the archives. Notable items reported missing during this period included correspondence from Winston Churchill and documents from the courts of several monarchies. Around 800 of these records have since been recovered, and the archives has reported that they believe most are misplaced rather than permanently lost. In 2017, the archives again received attention when it was reported that around 1000 files had been removed – in part or whole – by government officials and reported as missing when not returned. In response to concerns stated by politicians and historians about management of the collection, the archives stressed that the number of missing files is quite small in proportion to the entire holdings of the repository – about 0.01% – and that, as of 2017, its loss rate was only around 100 documents, annually.

===Forgeries discovered in 2005===

In June 2005, journalist Ben Fenton of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; received an email from a colleague asking him to investigate documents held at TNA that alleged that a British intelligence agent had, on the orders of Winston Churchill, murdered Heinrich Himmler, the head of the Nazi SS, in 1945. The three documents had come to prominence after being revealed by author Martin Allen in his book &quot;Himmler&#x27;s Secret War&quot;.

On viewing photographs of the documents, Fenton&#x27;s suspicions were immediately aroused by the fact that such a controversial policy was casually committed to paper, even to the extent of naming the assassin, and by the use of colourful language. Viewing the original documents the next day, Fenton spotted what looked like pencil marks beneath the signature on one of them. This confirmed his suspicions and, along with his experience of analysing historic documents, it enabled him to persuade &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; to pay for forensic analysis.

TNA staff took four files, along with authenticated copies of the authors&#x27; handwriting, to Audrey Giles, a former head of Scotland Yard&#x27;s Questioned Documents Unit, who confirmed that the documents were forgeries. One letter head had been printed on a laser printer and all had tear marks where they had been threaded on to the security tags. Further investigations by TNA staff revealed that the counterfeit documents contained errors, breaches of protocol and etiquette which their supposed authors would not have committed.

After his account of the deception appeared in the newspaper, Fenton was contacted by a German academic, Ernst Haiger, who informed him of his own suspicions over other TNA documents cited in an earlier Allen book. Examination by TNA experts led to more than a dozen documents being identified as suspicious and submitted to Home Office specialists for examination. When they, too, were declared forgeries, the TNA called in the police.

In the addendum to the later American edition of the book (which acknowledged that the papers were forged), Allen theorised that, some time after he saw the documents, they had been removed and replaced with clumsily forged replicas, to cast doubt upon his discoveries.

In all, twenty-nine forged documents were discovered, each typed on one of only four typewriters. They were placed in twelve separate files, and cited at least once in one or more of Allen&#x27;s three books. According to the experts at TNA, documents now shown to be forgeries supported controversial arguments central to each of Allen&#x27;s books: in &quot;Hidden Agenda&quot;, five documents now known to be forged helped justify his claim that the Duke of Windsor betrayed military secrets to Hitler; in &quot;The Hitler/Hess Deception&quot;, thirteen forged papers supported Allen&#x27;s contention that, in 1941, British intelligence used members of the Royal family to fool the Nazis into thinking Britain was on the verge of a pro-German putsch; in &quot;Himmler&#x27;s Secret War&quot;, twenty-two counterfeit papers also underpinned the book&#x27;s core claims that British intelligence played mind games with Himmler to encourage him to betray Hitler from 1943 onwards, and that ultimately they murdered the SS chief.

In 2007 the Crown Prosecution Service announced that it was &quot;not in the public interest&quot; to prosecute the only suspect questioned by police. Allen&#x27;s health problems had prevented the police questioning him for nine months, after which he told them he was wholly innocent. In a December 2007 response to questions from Norman Baker MP, the Solicitor-General said that the police investigation, guided by the opinion of a senior barrister, had produced &quot;sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction&quot; on charges of forgery, using a forged document and criminal damage but it had been decided that it was not in the public interest to proceed. In reaching that decision, &quot;matters relating to Mr Allen&#x27;s health and the surrounding circumstances were significant in deciding that a prosecution was not in the public interest&quot;.

== MI5 records at TNA ==
TNA receives records from MI5 around twice a year. Some information in records, or records themselves, are withheld at the discretion of MI5.

=== MI5 records in the news ===
MI5 records relating to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s time in office have caused some questions and controversy regarding the transparency of the British government. In 2017, journalist Richard Norton-Taylor argued that MI5, and the British government by extension, was purposely withholding some information that the public deserves to know. Norton-Taylor specifically refers to Thatcher&#x27;s reluctance to allow the publication of two books looking into the impact that intelligence organizations of Britain had on World War II, as well as her worries about British activities in Northern Ireland becoming known to the general public.

Additional MI5 records relating to the blacklisting of government workers during Thatcher&#x27;s time in office have also prompted questions after their release. In addition to government workers, the blacklists also targeted other groups, such as unions and minorities, that may not fall in line with Conservative policies. Debates on the roles of MI5, Whitehall, and Thatcher&#x27;s administration, have come up in light of these records at TNA and prompted questions of transparency as well as whether or not these blacklists had an effect on the careers of any individuals included. Questions also remain, as of 2018, whether or not there are still blacklists currently in effect and if these could affect government workers, unions, and other individuals possibly included in the blacklists.

<text>Criminal Justice Act (with its many variations) is a stock short title used for legislation in Canada, Malaysia, Ireland and the United Kingdom relating to the criminal law (including both substantive and procedural aspects of that law). It tends to be used for Acts that do not have a single cohesive subject matter.

The Bill for an Act with this short title will have been known as a Criminal Justice Bill during its passage through Parliament.

Criminal Justice Acts may be a generic name either for legislation bearing that short title or for all legislation which relates to the criminal law. It is not a term of art.

<text>The Cistaceae are a small family of plants (rock-rose or rock rose family) known for their beautiful shrubs, which are profusely covered by flowers at the time of blossom. This family consists of about 170(-200) species in eight genera that are not very distinct, distributed primarily in the temperate areas of Europe and the Mediterranean basin, but also found in North America; a limited number of species are found in South America. Most Cistaceae are subshrubs and low shrubs, and some are herbaceous. They prefer dry and sunny habitats. Cistaceae grow well on poor soils, and many of them are cultivated in gardens.

They often have showy yellow, pink or white flowers, which are generally short-lived. The flowers are bisexual, regular, solitary or borne in cymes; they usually have five, sometimes three, petals (&quot;Lechea&quot;). The petals are free, usually crumpled in the bud, and sometimes in the open flower (e. g. &quot;Cistus incanus&quot;). It has five sepals, the inner three of which are distinctly wider, and the outer two are narrow and sometimes regarded as bracteoles. The sepal arrangement is a characteristic property of the family.

The stamens are numerous, of variable length, and sit on a disc; filaments are free. The ovary is superior, usually with three carpels; placentation is parietal, with two or more ovules on each placenta. The fruit is a capsule, usually with five or ten valves (three in &quot;Helianthemum&quot;). The seeds are small, with a hard, water-impermeable coating, weighing around 1 mg.

Recently the neotropical tree &quot;Pakaraimaea dipterocarpacea&quot; is placed here, following APG IV (2016)

==Ecology==

The ability of Cistaceae to thrive in many Mediterranean habitats follows from two important ecological properties: mycorrhizal ability and fast renewal after wildfire.
Most Cistaceae have the ability to create symbiotic relationship with root fungi of the genus &quot;Tuber&quot;. In this relationship, the fungus complements the root system in its task of absorbing water and minerals from the soil, and thus allows the host plant to dwell on particularly poor soils. In addition, an interesting quality of &quot;T. melanosporum&quot; is its ability to kill all vegetation except the host plant within the reach of its mycelium, and thus to give its host some sort of &quot;exclusiveness&quot; for the adjacent land area.

Cistaceae have also optimally adapted to the wildfires that frequently eradicate large areas of forest. The plants cast their seeds in the soil during the growth period, but they do not germinate in the next season. Their hard coating is impermeable to the water, and thus the seeds remain dormant for a long period of time. This coating together with their small size allows these plants to establish a large seed bank rather deep in the soil. Once the fire comes and kills the vegetation in the area, the seed coating softens or cracks as a result of the heating, and the surviving seeds germinate shortly after the fire. This mechanism allows the Cistaceae to produce a large number of young shoots simultaneously and at the right time, and thus to obtain an important advantage over other plants in the process of repopulating the area.

==Systematics==
Molecular analyses of angiosperms have placed Cistaceae within the Malvales, forming a clade with two families of tropical trees, Dipterocarpaceae and Sarcolaenaceae. Recent phylogenetic studies confirm the monophyly of Cistaceae on the basis of plastid sequences and morphological synapomorphies.

Within Cistaceae, eight genera are recognized, including five in the Mediterranean (&quot;Cistus&quot;, &quot;Fumana&quot;, &quot;Halimium&quot;, &quot;Helianthemum&quot;, &quot;Tuberaria&quot;) and three in the temperate regions of North America (&quot;Crocanthemum&quot;, &quot;Hudsonia&quot;, &quot;Lechea&quot;). These eight genera can be grouped into five major lineages within Cistaceae:
*a basal clade of the genus &quot;Fumana&quot;
*the New World clade of &quot;Lechea&quot;
*the &quot;Helianthemum&quot; s. l. clade, consisting of the sister groups &quot;Crocanthemum&quot; and &quot;Hudsonia&quot; from the New World, and &quot;Helianthemum&quot; s. s. from the Old World
*the &quot;Tuberaria&quot; clade
*a cohesive complex of &quot;Halimium&quot; and &quot;Cistus&quot; species

==Cultivation and uses==

&quot;Cistus&quot;, &quot;Halimium&quot; and &quot;Helianthemum&quot; are widely cultivated ornamental plants. Their soil requirements are modest, and their hardiness allows them to survive well even the snowy winters of Northern Europe.

Some &quot;Cistus&quot; species, mostly &quot;C. ladanifer&quot;, are used to produce an aromatic resin, used in the perfume industry.

The ability of Cistaceae to create mycorrhizal relation with truffle mushroom (&quot;Tuber&quot;) prompted several studies about using them as host plants for truffle cultivation. The small size of &quot;Cistus&quot; shrubs could prove favorable, as they take up less space than traditional hosts, such as oak (&quot;Quercus&quot;) or pine (&quot;Pinus&quot;), and could thus lead to larger yield per field unit.

Cistaceae has been listed as one of the 38 plants used to prepare Bach flower remedies, a kind of alternative medicine promoted for its effect on health. However, according to Cancer Research UK, &quot;there is no scientific evidence to prove that flower remedies can control, cure or prevent any type of disease, including cancer&quot;.

==Symbolism==
In the Victorian language of flowers, the gum cistus of the Cistaceae plant family symbolized imminent death. 

==Synonymous genera==
These generic names inside Cistaceae were defined in various publications, but their members were synonymised with the eight accepted genera by later research.

* &quot;Anthelis&quot;
* &quot;Aphananthemum&quot;
* &quot;Atlanthemum&quot;
* &quot;Fumanopsis&quot;

<text>An ice shanty (also called an ice shack, ice house, fishing shanty, fish house, fish coop, bobhouse, ice hut, or darkhouse; ) is a portable shed placed on a frozen lake to provide shelter during ice fishing. They can be as small and cheap as a plastic tarpaulin draped over a simple wooden frame, or as expensive as a small cabin with heating, bunks, electricity, and cooking facilities.

More durable ice houses are generally left on a lake for the duration of the ice fishing season, although this can cause problems, such as thaws and re-freezing causing houses to be immoveably frozen onto the lake. Lighter, cheaper versions can collapse into a package to be moved from lake to lake during the season.

Many northern communities have developed bodies of laws about the operation of ice shanties - frequently including dates by which they must be removed, even if the ice can still hold them.

== Culture ==
In northern climates, ice shanties are the center of ice fishing culture, customs and traditions. Fishermen often decorate their ice shanties in humorous ways (toilets are a popular joke addition), while others studiously work on ways to make their ice shanties more comfortable and efficient. Much of the culture reflects on the inherent danger of erecting a structure atop a frozen pond. The mayor of Hudson, Ohio claimed ice shanties could lead to increases in prostitution, although WJW (TV) could find no evidence of this.

Active since 2006, his first release, &quot;Warning&quot;, was in 2007. He released an annual &quot;Shambhala&quot; mix album in the third quarter of each year until 2016. He started his own music festival (Lost Lands) the following year and releases annual mixes. He is known for his tours with immense sound systems and huge visual productions.

The majority of tracks on the album were produced by Excision, with collaborations with other artists such as Downlink, Space Laces, Far Too Loud, Bassnectar and Ajapai. Destroid is a dubstep supergroup and Ableton Live band consisting of Excision, Downlink and KJ Sawka. Destroid is well known for their futuristic robot suits, heavy apocalyptic sounds, and visual productions and MIDI instrument use.

==Career==
Abel released his first mix in 2006 titled &quot;Darkside Dubstep&quot;, and his second mix &quot;Ruttun Dubstep&quot; in 2007, both consisting of various dubstep songs. Abel released his first Shambhala Mix in 2008, also compilation of dubstep songs. In 2009, Abel released his first EP titled &quot;Boom&quot; on his own label &quot;Rottun Recordings.&quot;

In 2010, Abel released the single with DJ/Producer Downlink titled &quot;Heavy Artillery&quot; with rapper Messinian, which also followed up to another song which was &quot;Reploid&quot; featuring Downlink.

In May 2011, Abel released a Downlink collaboration EP titled &quot;Existence&quot;. In November of the same year, Abel released his debut studio album &quot;X Rated&quot; on deadmau5&#x27;s record label mau5trap. The album&#x27;s release was supported by the North American &quot;X Tour&quot; with Liquid Stranger and Lucky Date, in early 2012, and around that time, the debut remix version of the album, &quot;X Rated&quot; titled, &quot;X Rated: The Remixes&quot; was released on September in 2012. He also formed the dubstep super group, Destroid, consisting of members Downlink and KJ Sawka. The group released their debut album, &quot;The Invasion&quot; which was released in May 2013. They also released their first single, &quot;Destroid 11. Get Stupid&quot; featuring Space Laces.

In January 2013, Excision unveiled the &quot;Executioner&quot; stage. It was a 28 ft wide, 15 ft tall, stage structure with video projection mapping and 40 lasers. He took this production on a 4 month tour of North America, with support from Vaski and Paper Diamond. 

On 15 November 2013, Excision unveiled a 100,000-watt sound system at the 1st Bank Center in Broomfield Colorado for the Boomfest event. The event included a back-to-back set from Funtcase and Cookie Monsta along with Deltron 3030, Brillz, ill.Gates and Colorado locals, Robotic Pirate Monkey.

Starting in January 2014, Excision began a new tour covering North America with support from Dirtyphonics and ill.Gates. This new tour featured his &quot;Executioner&quot; video and light production. This time, he brought a 150,000-watt sound system from PK Sound.

In 2015, Excision released his second studio album &quot;Codename X&quot; on his own label Rottun Recordings.

2016 saw the debut of a new tour and production system, &quot;The Paradox&quot;. The new production system made its way across North America selling out venues with the support of Bear Grillz and Figure on most dates.

On 25 October 2016, Excision released his third studio album, &quot;Virus&quot;, on Rottun Records. Virus contained 16 songs and collaborations with artists including Dion Timmer, Space Laces, Protohype, and others.

On 14 August 2018, Excision released his fourth studio album, &quot;Apex&quot;. The album took two years to make and it contains 14 songs and collaborations with artists including Dion Timmer, Sullivan King, Space Laces, Illenium and others. Excision stated that the album is a celebration of all he&#x27;s accomplished in his career.

In June 2019, he announced an upcoming EP with Dutch producer Dion Timmer. This collab EP, named &quot;Breaking Through&quot;, was released on the 22nd of June.

In September, he announced another EP with American dubstep producer Wooli. It was named &quot;Evolution EP&quot; and released on 13 September with Seven Lions&#x27;s single &quot;Another Me.&quot;

In November, after more than three years of The Paradox, Abel announced his new audio/visual concept show titled &quot;The Evolution&quot; along with a double-header show he called &quot;The Thunderdome.&quot; The new production debuted on January 31 and lasted until February 1, 2020 in Tacoma Dome, Washington. The production was inevitably cut short due to the Coronavirus.

In 2020, Abel released his second collaboration with Illenium, titled &quot;Feel Something&quot;. The song featured the American metalcore band I Prevail. He also followed up by another single with Downlink, his first collaboration with him after 3 years, titled &quot;Resistance&quot;.

In September 2020, Excision announced his new record label, Subsidia Records, and launched three compilations consisting of 118 bass songs, ranging from Experimental Bass, Melodic Bass and Heavy Bass. He also released a one-and-a-half-hour long mix from his Lost Lands: Couch Lands livestream, titled &quot;Excision Subsidia Mix 2020&quot;, along with three new singles, &quot;Necromancer&quot; with Dion Timmer, &quot;Demise&quot; with PhaseOne, and &quot;Erase You&quot; with Wooli and HALIENE.

==Festivals==
In 2017, Excision announced the inaugural year of his own dinosaur-themed music festival, Lost Lands. Lost Lands took place at Legend Valley, Ohio 29 September through 1 October 2017.

On 15 March 2018, following the success of the inaugural Lost Lands, Excision announced a west coast version of the festival, Bass Canyon, to be held 24–26 August 2018 at The Gorge Amphitheatre in George, Washington.

<text>The Grantland Rice Trophy was an annual award presented in the United States from 1954 to 2013 to the college football team recognized by the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) as the national champions.

Named for the legendary sportswriter Grantland Rice, the trophy was presented annually after the college football bowl games. A committee of five writers from different areas was appointed each season to select a champion by secret ballot. Voting was conducted initially by a positional voting system but after 1994 by a single-team vote. Beginning in 2002, the FWAA also began issuing a national poll to go along with the Grantland Rice Trophy. The top team in the final poll was awarded the trophy. The trophy itself consisted of a bronze football atop a four-sided pedestal.

On August 26, 2010, the FWAA announced that the 2004 award presented to the USC Trojans had been rescinded, the first time in the award&#x27;s history that a winner has vacated the honor. The FWAA declined to name a replacement for that year&#x27;s award.

With the advent of the College Football Playoff (CFP) for the 2014 season, the FWAA quietly retired the Grantland Rice Trophy, joining with the National Football Foundation (NFF) to instead publish the FWAA-NFF Grantland Rice Super 16 Poll during the regular season, with the CFP champion automatically receiving the NFF&#x27;s MacArthur Bowl Trophy.

<text>Attachment parenting (AP) is a parenting philosophy that proposes methods aiming to promote the attachment of mother and infant not only by maximal parental empathy and responsiveness but also by continuous bodily closeness and touch. The term &quot;attachment parenting&quot; was coined by the American pediatrician William Sears. There is no conclusive body of research that shows Sears&#x27; approach to be superior to &quot;mainstream parenting&quot;.

==History==

=== Context ===
Although the term &quot;attachment parenting&quot; was first used only in the late 1990s, the concept is much older. In the United States, it became popular in the mid-1900s, when several responsiveness and love-oriented parenting philosophies entered the pedagogical mainstream, as a contrast to the more disciplinarian philosophies prevalent at the time. Attachment parenting owes many of its ideas to older teachings, such as Benjamin Spock&#x27;s influential handbook &quot;The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care&quot; (1946). Spock had advised mothers to raise their infants according to their own common sense and with plenty of physical contact – a guideline that radically broke with the preceding doctrines of L. Emmett Holt and John B. Watson, which recommended discipline and emotional distance. Spock&#x27;s book became a bestseller, and his new child-rearing concept greatly influenced the upbringing of the post-war generations.

Thirty years later, Jean Liedloff caused a stir by a &quot;continuum concept&quot; that she presented to the public in a book of the same title (1975). In Venezuela, Liedhoff had studied Ye&#x27;kuana people, and later she recommended to Western mothers to nurse and to wear their infants and to share their bed with them. She argued that infants, speaking in terms of evolution, have not arrived in the modernity yet, so that today&#x27;s way of child care – with bottle feeding, use of cribs and baby carriages, etc. – does not meet their needs. Later, authors such as Sharon Heller and Meredith Small contributed further ethnopediatric insights.

In 1984, developmental psychologist Aletha Solter published her book &quot;The Aware Baby&quot; about a parenting philosophy that advocates attachment, extended breastfeeding, and abstinence from punishment, similarly to what William Sears later wrote; however, the point that Solter stressed most was an encouragement of the child&#x27;s emotional expression to heal stress and trauma.

In the 1990s, T. Berry Brazelton invigorated the discussion. He contributed new research about the capacity of newborn infants to express themselves and their emotions, sensitized parents for these signals, and encouraged them – just like Spock – to follow their own judgment.

==Controversy ==
Since 2012, there has been a controversy about Sears&#x27; positions which has been mostly carried out in the English-speaking world.

It began in 2012 with a cover picture on &quot;Time&quot; magazine that showed a Californian mother breastfeeding her almost 4-year-old. In the accompanying article &quot;The Man Who Remade Motherhood&quot;, journalist Kate Pickert tried to argue that even if William Sears&#x27; positions are much less radical than those of his followers, they are ‘misogynistic’ and give mothers a chronically guilty conscience, and that they frequently disagree with relevant research results. The cover picture and article became the starting point of disputes in many media, criticizing Pickert.

At the same time, attachment parenting attracted attention of sociologists like Ellie Lee, Charlotte Faircloth, Jan Macvarish, and Frank Furedi who described the phenomenon an example of 21st century &quot;Parental Determinism&quot;. As early as in 1996, sociologist Sharon Hays had described the sociocultural phenomenon of an &quot;Intensive Mothering&quot;; with attachment parenting, this phenomenon finally became tangible and recognizable. In 2004, media critic Susan J. Douglas and philosopher Meredith W. Michaels followed with their account of a &quot;New Momism&quot;.

=== &quot;Time&quot; cover picture and article ===
The &quot;Time&quot; magazine cover picture and article were published May 21, 2012.

=== Origin ===
William Sears, a pediatrician, came upon the term &quot;attachment parenting&quot; in 1982 by reading Liedloff. Initially, he referred to his new philosophy as &quot;the new continuum concept&quot; and &quot;immersion mothering&quot;. When he published his book &quot;Creative Parenting&quot; in 1982, the concept was largely elaborate already. The &quot;7 Baby-Bs&quot; were not explicitly presented as a canon yet, but as basic elements of a new parenting philosophy, they were distinctly clear even at that early point. In 1985, William Sears and his wife Martha Sears began to link the concept – ex post – with attachment theory which they had begun to recognize at that time. From then on, they used the term &quot;attachment parenting&quot;.

In 1993, William Sears and Martha Sears published &quot;The Baby Book&quot; which became the first comprehensive manual for AP-parents and which was occasionally dubbed &quot;the attachment parenting bible&quot;. The first attachment parenting organization, Attachment Parenting International, formed in 1994 in Alpharetta, Georgia, and was founded by Lysa Parker and Barbara Nicholson. The first book that carried the term &quot;attachment parenting&quot; in the title was written by Tammy Frissell-Deppe, a mother who gave an account of her personal experiences and of those of her friends and acquaintances. In 1999, blogger Katie Allison Granju followed with another book, to which William Sears contributed a foreword, before he, together with Martha Sears, published his own work, &quot;The Attachment Parenting Book&quot; in 2001. All three books stood – with their opposition against a crude behavioristic infant anthropology – in the tradition of Spock, but radicalized the concept of a contingency-oriented parenting on the one hand, and incorporated Liedloff&#x27;s idea of an instinct-guided resp. &quot;natural&quot; childrearing on the other hand.

In the same year as Sears and Sears&#x27; &quot;Attachment Parenting Book&quot;, Jan Hunt published her essay collection &quot;The Natural Child. Parenting from the Heart&quot;. Hunt who sees herself as a child advocate, campaigned in this book not only for attachment parenting, but also for unschooling. A more recent AP proponent is parenting advisor Naomi Aldort, who published her book &quot;Raising Our Children, Raising Ourselves&quot; in 2006.

==In practice==

=== Baby Reading ===
Consistent with the founders of attachment theory, especially Mary Ainsworth, William Sears teaches that a strong mother-child-attachment emerges from contingency, that is, when mother and child are attuned to each other, which in turn is based on the mother&#x27;s sensitivity. Since the mother &quot;reads&quot; the signals of her infant, Sears speaks in this context of &quot;baby reading&quot;. Another metaphor that he uses is &quot;to be in the groove&quot;.

=== The Seven B&#x27;s ===
William Sears strongly believes in the existence of child rearing practices that support &quot;baby reading&quot; and that augment maternal sensitivity. The methods of attachment parenting include seven practices/principles that according to Sears form a &quot;synergetic&quot; ensemble and that are based on the child&#x27;s &quot;biological needs&quot;. 
*Birth bonding
*Breastfeeding
*Baby wearing
*Bedding close to baby
*Belief in the language value of your baby&#x27;s cry
*Beware of baby trainers
*Balance

Until 1999, Sears named only five Baby Bs. The last two were only added in 2001 with the publication of the &quot;Attachment Parenting Book&quot;.

==== Birth bonding ====

William Sears postulates the existence of a brief time slot immediately after birth during which the newborn is in a &quot;quiet alert state&quot; and particularly accessible for bonding. He refers to this birth bonding as &quot;imprinting&quot; and bases himself on a study by Drs. Marshall Klaus and John Kennell from 1967; however, Klaus and Kennell later modified their original assumptions, including the one cited by Sears. Sears advises women to abstain from analgesics during childbirth, since those drug the child, too, and according to Sears interfere with the birth bonding.

==== Breastfeeding ====
William Sears argues that breastfeeding greatly accommodates mother-child-attachment because it triggers the release of oxytocin in the mother which supports her emotional bonding with the child, notably in the first ten days after childbirth. In opposition to bottle feeding which tends to be done in three to four hour intervals. Breastfeeding enables the mother to perceive the child&#x27;s moods and needs exactly. Since the half-life period of the hormones prolactin and oxytocin (which promote bonding) are very short, Sears recommends to breastfeed very frequently, newborns in particular (8 to 12 times a day). He claims that the hours between 1 am and 6 am are the most beneficial for breastfeeding. In general, Sears argues that breastfeeding is beneficial for the health of both child and mother. He claims that infants up to six months should be exclusively fed with breast milk, since he believes that, at that age, children are allergic to all other foods.

William and Martha Sears advise mothers to breastfeed every child for 1–4 years:

William Sears advocates extended breastfeeding, since he is convinced that breastfeeding supports attachment even of older children and that it is a valid instrument to comfort older children or to bring mother and child together on turbulent days. Neither does he object nighttime breastfeeding of toddlers. As early as in 1992, Norma Jane Bumgarner had campaigned for extended breastfeeding.

Sears&#x27; recommendations are in accordance with the WHO guidelines on breastfeeding, which recommend exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months and complementary breastfeeding in the first two years for all countries.

Since breastfeeding studies are, for ethical reasons, never conducted as randomized controlled trials, critics have repeatedly suspected that studies may have produced the superiority of breastfeeding as an artifact. Both the physical, emotional and mental development of children and the preferences of women for a feeding method are strongly determined by socioeconomical factors such as the mother&#x27;s ethnicity, social class, and education. If researchers go without randomization and turn a blind eye to those possible alternative factors, they fundamentally run a risk to falsely credit the feeding method for effects of socioeconomic factors. A loophole from this problem was first presented by Cynthia G. Colen (Ohio State University), who successfully factored out socioeconomical determinants by comparing siblings only; her study demonstrated that formula fed children showed only minimal differences to their breastfed siblings, insofar as their physical, emotional and mental thriving was concerned.

William Sears&#x27; assumptions about the benefit of breastfeeding for the attachment have been studied. In 2006, John R. Britton and a research team (Kaiser Permanente) found that highly sensitive mothers are more likely than less sensitive mothers to breastfeed and to breastfeed over a long time period. However, the study showed no effect of the feeding method on the attachment quality.

==== Baby wearing ====

Sears advises mothers to wear infants on the body as many hours during the day as possible, for example in a sling. He argues that this practice makes the child happy and allows the mother to involve the child into everything she does and never to lose sight of the child. He advises working mothers to wear the child at least 4–5 hours every night in order to make good for her absence during the day.

In 1990, a research team from New York revealed in a randomized study that children of lower class mothers who to the age of 13 months spent a lot of time in a child carrier on their mother&#x27;s body showed significantly more frequently a secure attachment as defined by Ainsworth than the control group children, who spend more time in an infant seat. For middle-class families, an equivalent study doesn&#x27;t exist yet.

Sears argues furthermore that baby wearing exercises the child&#x27;s sense of balance; since a child who is worn on the mother&#x27;s experiences more of her conversations, he believes that baby wearing is also beneficial for the child&#x27;s language acquisition. However, there are not studies that confirm such effects.

It is undisputed that baby wearing can calm children down. Infants cry the most at the age of six weeks; in 1986, a research team at McGill University showed in a randomized study that infants of that age cried significantly less if their parents wore them a lot on the body during the day. Sears recommends babywearing for the purpose of settling a baby to sleep, too. He approves on the use of a sling up to the age of three, since child wearing can also be used to calm a misbehaving toddler down. Other pediatricians find it disputable to wear children beyond the age of nine months permanently on the body, arguing that this is against the child&#x27;s natural desire for autonomy.

==== Co-sleeping ====

William Sears states that any sleeping arrangement that a family practices is acceptable as long as it works; but he advises mother to sleep close to the child. He thinks of co-sleeping as the ideal arrangement and refers to it as the nighttime equivalent of baby wearing: co-sleeping supports, in his opinion, the mother-child-attachment, makes breastfeeding more convenient, and prevents not only separation anxiety, but also SIDS Sears is convinced that mother and child, in spite of frequent nighttime breastfeeding, have the best sleep when they sleep close together. He is also convinced that due to the extra nighttime feedings, a child that sleeps close to the mother thrives better than a child &quot;crying, alone, behind bars&quot;. Moreover, Katie Allison Granju argued that co-sleeping is beneficial for children, too, because it gives children a vivid notion of the concept of bedtime.

The idea of co-sleeping was not new in modern Western societies; as early as in 1976, Tine Thevenin had campaigned for the &quot;family bed&quot;. Sears doesn&#x27;t see a problem when a three-year-old still shares their mother&#x27;s bed every night. He doesn&#x27;t even object if a child is in the habit of spending the whole night with her mother&#x27;s nipple in her mouth, except when the mother really feels uncomfortable. Sears advises working mothers to co-sleep on all accounts in order to compensate the child for her daytime absence.

Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) occurs with an incidence of roughly 33 per 100,000 live births. James J. McKenna studied five pairs of co-sleeping mothers and infants and found them to synchronize nighttime arousals. With the study, he raised the questions of 1) whether there&#x27;s a relationship between these synchronized nighttime waking and breathing stability and 2) whether this could be related to some forms of SIDS. Studies that investigate SIDS directly have shown that co-sleeping raises the SIDS risk instead of lowering it. Things that increase the risk of SIDS include: 1) when the infant is younger than four months, 2) the parents were especially tired, 3) the parents consumed alcohol, 4) parents were smokers, 5) slept on a sofa, or 6) the baby was in a duvet. Even in the absence of these risk factors, studies have still shown there to be an increased risk of SIDS when bed sharing. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission also warns against co-sleeping. Attachment Parenting International issued a response which stated that the data referenced in the Consumer Product Safety Commission statement were unreliable, and that co-sponsors of the campaign had created a conflict of interest. The American Academy of Pediatrics&#x27; policy on SIDS prevention opposes bed-sharing with infants, although room-sharing is encouraged.

In general, research doesn&#x27;t confirm an advantage of co-sleeping over separate beds. A meta study from Israel has pointed out in 2000 that sleeping aids such as pacifiers and teddy bears significantly improve the child&#x27;s sleep, while co-sleeping and frequent nighttime breastfeeding if anything hinder the formation of wholesome sleeping patterns. Co-sleeping mothers breastfeed three times as frequently during the night as mothers who have their bed for themselves. The most important factor for a child to get a good sleep proved to be the mother&#x27;s emotional accessibility, not her permanent physical closeness.

==== &quot;Crying is an attachment tool&quot; ====

William Sears determines crying as the child&#x27;s pivotal mean of self-expression. Parents are challenged to &quot;read&quot; the crying – which is initially generalized – and to provide the child with empathic feedback in order to help them to differentiate and elaborate the repertoire of their signals gradually. Furthermore, he recommends &quot;prevention&quot; of crying: parents are advised not only to practice breastfeeding, baby wearing and co-sleeping as much as possible, but also to get into the habit of properly responding to the early warning signals so that crying doesn&#x27;t happen in the first place. Likewise, parents must teach their child that some trivial occasions are no cause for alarm at all.

In general, Sears argues that infants should never be left crying because this would harm them. But as early as in 1962, T. Berry Brazelton had shown in a study that a certain amount of crying in young infants does not indicate emotional or physical problems, but is to be considered normal and harmless.

==== No sleep training ====
William Sears names two reasons why infants should not undergo sleep training: he believes that infant training hardens the mother emotionally and that children who underwent such training don&#x27;t sleep better but merely resign and become apathetic, a state that he refers to as &quot;shut down syndrome&quot;, although a condition of this name doesn&#x27;t exist in DSM or ICD. Frissell-Deppe and Granju believe that sleep training is traumatic for children.

Sears argues that advocates of sleep training are professionally incompetent and merely business oriented, and that there is no scientific proof that sleep training is beneficial for children.

==== Balance ====
For parents and particularly for mothers, attachment parenting is more strenuous and demanding 
than most other present-day ways of parenting, placing high responsibility on them without allowing for a support network of helpful friends or family. William Sears is fully aware of the arduousness of the methods. He suggests a whole package of measures that aim to prevent an emotional burnout of the mother, like the prioritization and delegation of duties and responsibilities, streamlining of daily routines, and collaboration between both parents. Sears advises mothers to turn to a psychotherapist if necessary, but to stick to attachment parenting at all costs.

Sears finds the burden of attachment parenting just and reasonable, and describes the opponents of this philosophy as &quot;authoritarian males ... caught up in their role of advice giver&quot;. Granju, too, takes a swipe at &quot;the male dominated &#x27;scientific&#x27; childcare guidance&quot;. She argues that the low reputation that breastfeeding, namely extended breastfeeding in the Western world has, arises from a sexualization of the female breast: from the perspective of a sexist society, the breast &quot;belongs&quot; to men, not to children. Mayim Bialik, too, considers attachment a feminist option, since it constitutes an alternative to the – male dominated – superiority of physicians who traditionally shaped the spheres of pregnancy, childbirth, and motherhood.

Since attachment parenting poses a considerable challenge to the reconcilability of motherhood and female career, the philosophy has been greatly criticized, most notably in the context of the attachment parenting controversy from 2012.

=== Parental authority ===
Sears states that in attachment families, parents and children practice a highly developed and sophisticated type of communication that makes it unnecessary for parents to use practices such as scolding; often, all it takes is a mere frown. He is convinced that children who trust their parents are cooperative and don&#x27;t resist parental guidance. He therefore recommends positive discipline. But in contrast to many AP parents, he isn&#x27;t fundamentally opposed to confrontative methods (firm, corrective response), and he gives high significance to child obedience and conscience. Sears is a decided advocate for authoritative parenting.

As studies have shown, it is indeed possible to use discipline strategies that are sensitive and, therefore, one should not equate discipline and insensitive caregiving.

== In theory ==

=== Claim ===
Like Benjamin Spock before them, William and Martha Sears consider their parenting philosophy as a common sense and instinct-guided ad hoc way of parenting. In contrast to Spock who derived his ideas in a straight line from Freud&#x27;s psychoanalysis, the Searses in fact didn&#x27;t start out from a theory; even the tie to attachment theory was only engineered ex post, when the philosophy was already largely complete. Apart from Liedloff&#x27;s rather eclectic thoughts, they came to their ideas mainly from their own personal impressions:

Despite the lack of a consistent theory, William and Martha Sears consider attachment parenting scientifically proven:

Their belief in such scientific proof doesn&#x27;t hinder the Searses to advise AP parents not to engage in discussions with AP critics. They also favor some science while they refuse other:

=== Fundamental terms and criticism ===
Critics consider a lack of a consistent theoretical foundation – notably the lack of precise definitions of the fundamental terms – a shortcoming of the attachment parenting concept.

==== Sensitivity ====

The concept of mutual emotional fine-tuning has been known in psychology since Franz Mesmer, who introduced it under the term &quot;rapport&quot;, before Freud adopted it for psychoanalysis. In relation to the mother-child-tie, behaviorists and developmental psychologists rather speak of &quot;contingency&quot; today; Daniel Stern coined the term &quot;attunement&quot;, too.

For Williams Sears, attachment parenting is a kind of parenting that is radically characterized by maternal responsivity. For that, he adopted Mary Ainsworth&#x27;s term of &quot;maternal sensitivity&quot;: The woman directs her attention completely on the child (&quot;babyreading&quot;) and responds continuously to every signal that the child sends; the result is a state of harmony between mother and child that leads to mutual attachment. Sears believes that the maternal &quot;tuning-in&quot; begins during pregnancy already.

==== Attachment ====
Within the framework of infant cognitive development studies, the child&#x27;s attachment to the parents has been well researched. Back in 1958, Harry Harlow demonstrated that baby monkeys would choose comfort and affection over food. As early as in the late 1940s, Donald Winnicott gave a detailed account of the development of the child&#x27;s attachment; at the latest after the sixth month, healthy children begin to disengage from the mother-child symbiosis quite normally. However, it was Margaret Mahler who gave the most accurate description of the attachment development during the first three years. William Sears&#x27; publications reveal no knowledge of this relevant literature.

Sears&#x27; use of the term &quot;attachment&quot; is merely colloquial. He applies it synonymously with terms like trust, harmony, closeness, bonding, love bonds, and connection: &quot;Attachment describes the whole caregiving relationship between mother or father and baby.&quot; He mentions that attachment emerges from contingency, but in his further accounts, he never differentiates between attachment and contingency. The readers must therefore assume that attachment is a deeply vulnerable state that never stabilizes and that requires constant reestablishment through incessant sensitivity.

Later in the book, in contradiction to his own preceding statements, Sears reassures adoptive parents: &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about the attachment your child may have &#x27;missed&#x27; in foster care. Infants are extremely resilient.&quot;

==== Insecure attachment ====
The establishment of a secure mother-child attachment is the declared and pivotal goal of attachment parenting.

In numerous scientific studies, the normal development of attachment has been well documented. The same applies for deviant or pathological developments. Problematic or disturbed attachment has been described in three contexts: 
*In extreme and rare conditions, the child may not form an attachment at all and may suffer from reactive attachment disorder. Children who suffer from reactive attachment disorder have often experienced extremely traumatic childhoods with a lot of neglect and abuse. An example of such a case is for children in orphanages in Romania where babies have been known to be left for 18–20 hours by themselves in their cribs. As adults, people with reactive attachment disorder show severe emotional abnormalities and a severely impaired social behavior.
*Mary Ainsworth described a type of disorganized attachment that appears, too, mostly in children who suffered child abuse; boys are more frequently affected than girls. Those children show distress, and their mothers reveal an obvious lack of empathy. Disorganized attachment is no mental disturbance in terms of ICD, but a type of behavior that can be observed in the strange situation test only. In &quot;normal&quot; middle-class families, about 15% of all children show a disorganized attachment. In social problem groups, the percentage can be significantly higher.

*A third group of problematic attachment is constituted by the types of insecure-avoidant and insecure-ambivalent attachment, both described by Mary Ainsworth, too. Children who are insecurely attached behave in the strange situation test either aloof towards their mothers, or they fluctuate between clinginess and rejection. As Beatrice Beebe (Columbia University) has substantiated in a study in 2010, these children experience from their mothers constantly behavior like under- or overstimulation, intrusiveness, or volatility. Nonetheless, their mothers displayed empathy and were fully able to respond to their children&#x27;s emotional expressions appropriately; the children showed no signs of emotional distress. Insecure attachment as defined by Ainsworth is very common and applies for example in the U. S. to about one out of three children.

William Sears uses the terms &quot;lesser quality of attachment&quot;, &quot;insecure attachment&quot;, and &quot;non-attachment&quot; synonymously. His formulations don&#x27;t reveal which kind of problematic attachment is meant: reactive attachment disorder (ICD), disorganized attachment (Ainsworth) or the two forms of insecure attachment (Ainsworth). Still in 1982, he mentioned &quot;diseases of non-attachment&quot; not referring to the attachment theorists Bowlby and Ainsworth, but to Selma Fraiberg, a psychoanalyst who studied blindly born children in the 1970s. Due to the vague description of problematic attachment, Sears and AP organizations who use his criteria have been reproached to produce a high rate of false positives. The same applies to definitions of attachment therapy, a concept that frequently appears to be partially overlapping with attachment parenting. Attachment parenting supporters have distanced themselves from attachment therapy, notably from its methods, but not from its diagnostic criteria.

Sears offers a discrimination between (good) attachment and (bad) enmeshment, but again without explaining to his readers how exactly they can identify the difference.

There is no conclusive body of research that shows Sears&#x27; approach to be superior to &quot;mainstream parenting&quot;. In field studies in Uganda, Ainsworth has observed that sometimes even children who spend plenty of time with their mothers and who were breastfed on cue, developed signs of insecure attachment; she concluded that it is not the quantity of mother-child interaction that determines the attachment type, but the quality. It is, therefore, not practices like co-sleeping, babywearing or feeding on cue that Ainsworth identifies as the crucial determinant for a secure attachment, but the &quot;maternal sensitivity&quot;.

==== Need ====

The theoretical starting point of attachment parenting – the idea of contingency – would suggest a concept of the infant as a creature who is essentially defined by their feelings and communication. William Sears, though, defines infants even more essentially by their needs. Need is therefore another basic term; attachment parenting means quintessentially to attend to the child&#x27;s needs.

As early as in the 1940s, psychologists such as Abraham Maslow shaped detailed models of the human needs; ever since, scientists have made a clear distinction between needs on the one hand and desires on the other hand. In 2000, T. Berry Brazelton, a pioneer in the field of newborn psychology, and child psychiatrist Stanley Greenspan published their book &quot;The Irreducible Needs of Children&quot;, in which they re-assessed the term for pediatrics. When the Searses published their &quot;Attachment Parenting Book&quot; one year later, they responded neither to Maslow nor to Brazelton and Greenspan, but used the word &quot;need&quot; merely in a colloquial sense. Although they stressed that parents must distinguish between needs and desires of children, in particular of older children, they denied their readers a guideline of how to tell needs and desires apart. With a view to infants, they believe that needs and desires are plainly identical. In general, they use both terms synonymously. With a view to toddlers, they often phrase it: a child is not ready yet (to do without breastfeeding, without co-sleeping, etc.); but even in contexts like these, they speak of needs, too.

Opponents of attachment parenting have questioned that the behavior of a 3½ year old who still demands to nurse can actually be classified as a &quot;need&quot;. Most likely the child is seeking consolation. To give a child comfort is an important parental responsibility; but parents are just as well liable to teach their child to take heart by their own power.

==== Stress ====

Stress has been surveyed and documented in many studies. The theoretical foundation was created in the 1960s by Richard Lazarus. In 1974, Hans Selye introduced the differentiation between distress and eustress, and in 1984, psychoanalyst Heinz Kohut proposed the concept of &quot;optimal frustration&quot;; Kohut postulated that the harmony between parents and child needs some well allotted disruption in order to empower the child to develop a healthy personality. In resilience psychology, too, there is broad agreement today that it harms children if their parents keep any stress away from them indiscriminately; by doing so, they suggest to the child that everyday problems are painful and overall to be avoided.

Even though stress is one of the fundamental terms of attachment parenting, William Sears&#x27; publications don&#x27;t reveal acquaintance with pertinent literature about this topic. Sears links stress and distress with the release of cortisol, but uses both terms synonymously and in a purely colloquial sense. He refers the term to any uncomfortable or frustrating state which makes the child cry – a signal which AP mothers are supposed to carefully attend to since stress sickens the child. On the other hand, Sears advises mothers not to overreact and to teach the child imperturbation (&quot;Caribbean approach&quot;). He leaves it up to the parents to decide which type of response individual situations ask for.

For parenting, any fuzziness of the term stress as well as of the term need have far-reaching consequences. If it is assumed that any crying of the child indicates harmful stress and that any of his demands indicate a true need, parents are bound to confuse rapport, sensitivity, responsivity, emotional availability, and wise protection with behaviors that, from an educational standpoint, are highly dysfunctional and that William Sears mostly wouldn&#x27;t agree with himself:

*with anxious continuous monitoring of the child
*with over-parenting, that is the continuous removal of such problems which the child could actually cope with herself
*with continuous micromanagement of the child&#x27;s moods, aimed to keep the child happy around the clock; indeed, William Sears considers happiness &quot;the end result and the bottom line of child-rearing&quot;.

==== Instinct and nature ====

Instinct is another basic term of attachment parenting. The Searses describe attachment parenting as the natural, biological, intuitive and spontaneous behavior of mothers who rely on their instincts, sixth sense, inner wisdom or common sense. They attribute even motherliness itself to instincts, whereas they attest men a reduced instinct for children&#x27;s needs.

Instinct theory developed in the 1930s within the framework of ethology. It owes its basic ideas to William McDougall among others, and its elaboration mainly to Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen. Lorenz believed that instincts are physiological processes and assumed they could be described as neuronal circuitry in the brain. But already Arnold Gehlen had disputed that humans still have much instinct at their disposal; for him, plasticity and learning aptitude outranked instinct. In today&#x27;s research, the term instinct is regarded as obsolete. Recent studies have demonstrated that motherly behavior is not inbred but biologically and socially determined. It is partly triggered by oxytocin, partly learned.

William Sears&#x27; writings show no knowledge of this current state of research. The Searses use the word instinct in a purely colloquial sense and synonymous with terms like hormonal and natural; as an antipole of instinct and nature, they identify the things that &quot;childcare advisors&quot; say.

William Sears, who owes his formative impressions to Jean Liefloff, points to mammals, primates, &quot;other&quot;, &quot;primitive&quot;, and &quot;traditional cultures&quot;, namely on Bali and in Zambia. Developmental psychologist Heidi Keller who comparatively researched the mother-child relationship in a large bandwidth of cultures, disputes that attachment parenting can be described as a return to a &quot;natural motherliness&quot;, like many supporters advertise it. Keller doesn&#x27;t rank attachment parenting as a counteragent to the high-tech world but asserts that it &quot;paradoxically fits optimally into a society of individualists and lone warriors how we experience it in the Western world&quot;. Many of the methods that the representatives of attachment parenting attribute to the evolutionary history of life don&#x27;t actually play the major role in non-western cultures that is attributed to them. In Cameroon for example, children are actually carried in a sling initially, but then have to learn to sit and to walk much earlier than European and North American children; rather than to cultivate affectionate eye contact, mothers blow into their children&#x27;s face in order to get them out of the habit of making eye contact.
Even in the United States, there are minority groups which can be classified as highly &quot;traditional&quot;, none of them practicing attachment parenting. Amish mothers for example co-sleep with their infants, but only for the first several months; they never let their infants and toddlers out of view, but they don&#x27;t wear them while they are working. From very early on, Amish children are raised to serve God, family, and community rather than to express their own needs. The infants of orthodox Jews traditionally sleep in cradles. In communities where there is no &quot;eruv&quot;, Jewish parents are not allowed to carry their children about on Shabbat. Native Americans traditionally used cradleboards which could be worn, but which involved minimal physical touch of mother and child.

=== Optimal development of the child ===
As Suzanne M. Cox (Northwestern University) has pointed out, neither attachment theory nor attachment parenting offer a general outline of the optimal development of the child, which could be used to empirically measure the efficacy of attachment parenting. The Searses promise parenting results such as increased independence, confidence, health, physical growth, improved development of the motor and language skills, good manners, conscientiousness, social competence, sense of justice, altruism, sensitivity, empathy, concentration, self-control, and intelligence. However, there is no conclusive evidence from empirical research that supports such claims.

The ultimate target of child rearing is, according to Sears, happiness. Similar to the German catholic Albert Wunsch, Sears therefore ranks among those parenting advisors whose philosophies reflect stray aspects of their religious beliefs, but result in a purely worldly target. In the year of the publication of the &quot;Attachment Parenting Book&quot;, Wendy Mogel, by contrast, suggested her own very influential concept of character education that was straightforwardly based on her Jewish faith (&quot;The Blessings of a Skinned Knee&quot;, 2001).

== Distribution and acceptance ==

Attachment parenting is particularly popular among educated urban women in Western countries, who are interested in ecological and social issues.

In the United States, parenting tips of well-known people like the actresses Mayim Bialik and Alicia Silverstone contributed to the popularity of the philosophy. Many North American Women are organized in support groups of Attachment Parenting International (API), the movement&#x27;s umbrella organization, in which Martha Sears serves as a board member. In Canada, there are further AP organizations such as the Attachment Parenting Canada Association (Calgary); even some public health organizations promote attachment parenting. William Sears has close ties to the international La Leche League (LLL) which feature him as a conference speaker and published several of his books. In LLL groups, many mothers get in touch with attachment parenting for the first time. There are also attachment parenting organizations in Australia and in New Zealand.

In Europe, Attachment Parenting Europe (APEU, in Lelystad, Netherlands) campaigns for attachment parenting; in the Dutch language the philosophy is referred to as &quot;natuurlijk ouderschap&quot; (&quot;natural parenthood&quot;). This organization keeps liaisons to representatives in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. In 2012, there were 30 AP groups in England and Wales.

In Germany, there are independent AP institutions in several cities. Hamburg, the movement&#x27;s central point in Germany, hosted a first Attachment Parenting Congress in 2014, under the patronage of Federal Minister of Family Affairs, Manuela Schwesig. A second one has been announced for 2016.

In Austria and Switzerland there exist a small number of AP institutions, too. In Sweden, fantasy and science fiction writer Jorun Modén solicits attachment parenting, which she refers to as &quot;nära föräldraskap&quot; (&quot;proximal parenthood&quot;). In France where the philosophy is dubbed as &quot;maternage intensif&quot; or &quot;maternage proximal&quot;, the movement has virtually no followers; due to the success of the Napoleonic education reforms, the French traditionally have a deeply rooted belief that educated child care specialists educate children at least as well as mothers do.

=== &quot;Parental tribalism&quot; ===
Katha Pollitt referred to attachment parenting as a fad. Parents who follow the philosophy have been reproached as acting according to their own helplessness and unsatisfied emotional neediness which may be the true reasons for their decision to incessantly pacify their child by breastfeeding and babywearing even into toddlerhood, as the belief that the child actually needs all that permanent intimacy for their healthy development is only a subterfuge. Emma Jenner argued that parents who are in the habit of stereotypically attending to each of the child&#x27;s signals with physical proximity will not learn to perceive the child&#x27;s needs in the full extent of their bandwidth and complexity.

Katie Allison Granju, who advocates attachment parenting and who published comprehensive guidelines for AP parents, offers a different perspective. She characterizes attachment parenting as not just a parenting style, but &quot;a completely fulfilling way of life&quot;.

Sociologist Jan Macvarish (University of Kent), a pioneer in the recent field of parenting culture study, described how AP parents utilize their parenting philosophy as a strategy of individualization, as a way to find personal identity and to join a group of congenial adults. Macvarish even speaks of &quot;parental tribalism&quot;. According to Macvarish, it is characteristic for such choices that they are much more angled towards the parents&#x27; self-perception than towards the child&#x27;s needs. Sociologist Charlotte Faircloth, too, considers attachment parenting a strategy that women pursue in order to gain and to express personal identity.

=== Child-rearing and lifestyle preferences of AP parents ===
Multiple authors have stated that many parents choose attachment parenting as part of an individualization strategy and as a statement of personal identity and of social affiliation. This assumption is supported by the observation that most AP parents show further distinctive parenting and life style preferences that are based on a particular set of attitudes (notably: a striving for naturalness), which, however, are mostly not directly tied to the declared goal of attachment parenting:
*&quot;gentle&quot; childbirth, &quot;natural&quot; childbirth, home birth;
*use of homemade toddler food from organic ingredients, veganism, paleolithic diet;
* use of washable cloth diapers, elimination communication;
* &quot;gentle discipline&quot;, &quot;positive discipline&quot;, non-confrontative parenting;
* naturopathy, holistic health, homeopathy, and decline of vaccination. William Sears&#x27; son Robert Sears published a &quot;Vaccine Book&quot; in 2007 which fueled the vaccine skepticism among parents, and in some AP groups, parents are explicitly asked not to have their children vaccinated. Vaccine skepticism is not universal among AP groups, however.

Some practices and preferences of AP parents are prevalent only in North America:
* decline of infant circumcision (in Europe, infant circumcision is relatively rare).
* naturism.
* homeschooling or unschooling (in Europe, the legality of homeschooling depends on the specific country).

The Sears encourage some of these practices explicitly, for example non-smoking, healthy and home-prepared food, no circumcision, but don&#x27;t comment on how they are supposed to be linked to the core ideas of attachment parenting. Only in the case of positive discipline, the link is quite obvious.

=== Feminist perspective ===
In his &quot;Complete Book of Christian Parenting and Child Care&quot; (1997), William Sears opposes maternal occupation, because he is convinced that it harms the child:

Any form of intensive, obsessive mothering has, as Katha Pollitt stated, devastating consequences for the equality of treatment of women in the society. In France, Élisabeth Badinter argued that over-parenting, obsession with washable diapers and organic, home made infant food, and parenting practices as the ones recommended by Sears, with breastfeeding into toddlerhood, bring women inevitably back into outdated patterns of gender role. In the United States, Badinter&#x27;s book &quot;The Conflict: How Modern Motherhood Undermines the Status of Women&quot; (2010) had a partially critical reception, because there is no publicly paid childcare leave in this country, and many women consider it a luxury to be able to be a stay-at-home-mom during the child&#x27;s first years. Still, gynecologist Amy Tuteur (formerly Harvard Medical School) stated that attachment parenting amounts to a new subjection of the woman&#x27;s body under social control – a trend that is more than questionable in the face to the hard-fought achievements of women&#x27;s movement.

As Erica Jong observed, the rise of attachment parenting followed a surge of glamourized motherhood of popular stars (Angelina Jolie, Madonna, Gisele Bündchen) in the mass media. She stated that the effort to model exceptional children under sacrifice of the parent&#x27;s own well-being transformed motherhood into a &quot;highly competitive race&quot;; all attempts of women to radically monopolize their parental responsibilities very much accommodate right-wing politics.

=== A &quot;culture of total motherhood&quot; ===
In her 2005 book &quot;Perfect Madness. Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety&quot;, Judith Warner, too, described how attachment parenting has taken a strong influence on mainstream parenting and how it has established a &quot;culture of total motherhood&quot;; due to these cultural changes, mothers are convinced today that they have to instantly attend to every need of their children in order to protect them from the risk of lifelong abandonment issues. As early as in 1996, sociologist Sharon Hays wrote about a newly formed &quot;ideology of intensive mothering&quot;. Characteristic of this ideology is the tendency to impose parenting responsibility primarily on &quot;mothers&quot; and to favor a kind of parenting that is child-centered, expert-guided, emotionally absorbing, labor, and financially intensive. Hays saw the motives for the overloading of motherhood in the idealistic endeavor to cure an overly egoistical and competitive society through a counterbalancing principle of altruistic motherliness. But according to Hays, any kind of &quot;intensive motherhood&quot; that systematically privileges children&#x27;s needs over mothers&#x27; needs happens without fail to the economical and personal disadvantage of mothers.

In 2014, a team of researchers at the University of Mary Washington showed in a study that mothers endorsing the belief that parenting is challenging (e.g. &quot;It is harder to be a good mother than to be a corporate executive&quot;), which is associated with &quot;intensive motherhood&quot;, have statistically more signs of depression

=== Fathers in attachment parenting ===
Sears has taken an adamant stance against fathers being primary caregivers in attachment parenting. On his website, he claims that fathers should &quot;help&quot; by supporting mothers and creating an environment which allows the mother to devote herself to the baby. Sears has claimed infants have a natural preference for a mother in the early years; although, little scientific literature actually supports this conjecture since these studies are typically done in situations where the mother is the primary caregiver and not the father. It is biased to say that infants have a &quot;natural&quot; preference for the mother when their mother is the one who is their primary caregiver; a more correct statement would be that infants have an attachment preference for the parent who is their primary caregiver. Studies have found that between 5 and 20% of children actually have a primary attachment with their father.

One specific caregiving activity in which Sears claims fathers should be supportive rather than primary is feeding. Breastfeeding includes nutritional benefits which are undeniable, but the main reason breastfeeding is promoted in attachment parenting is for the mother-child bonding through skin to skin contact and intimacy; however, the benefits of skin to skin contact and intimacy are still present for fathers. Dr. Sigmund Freud theorized that infants tend to prefer mothers since it is the mother who fulfills the infant&#x27;s oral needs; however, if the father is fulfilling this need, it would be reasonable to assume that attachment would form with the father. Through what is called &quot;bottle nursing&quot;, fathers and other caregivers who cannot breastfeed hold the infant touching their bare torso and feed gently and intimately, focusing their attention on the baby.

Other common mother-child AP practices, such as bonding after birth and co-sleeping, may also be equally beneficial for fathers.

<doc id="569646" wikidata="Q3290037" url="?curid=569646" title="Free nerve ending">
<text>A free nerve ending (FNE) or bare nerve ending, is an unspecialized, afferent nerve fiber sending its signal to a sensory neuron. &quot;Afferent&quot; in this case means bringing information from the body&#x27;s periphery toward the brain. They function as cutaneous nociceptors and are essentially used by vertebrates to detect noxious stimuli that often result in pain.

==Structure==
Free nerve endings are unencapsulated and have no complex sensory structures. They are the most common type of nerve ending, and are most frequently found in the skin. They penetrate the dermis and end in the stratum granulosum. FNEs infiltrate the middle layers of the dermis and surround hair follicles.

==Types==
Free nerve endings have different rates of adaptation, stimulus modalities, and fiber types.

===Rate of adaptation===
Different types of FNE can be rapidly adapting, intermediate adapting, or slowly adapting. A delta type II fibers are fast-adapting while A delta type I and C fibers are slowly adapting.

===Modality===
Free nerve endings can detect temperature, mechanical stimuli (touch, pressure, stretch) or danger (nociception). Thus, different free nerve endings work as thermoreceptors, cutaneous mechanoreceptors and nociceptors. In other words, they express polymodality.

===Fiber types===

The majority of Aδ (A delta) fibers (group III) and C (group IV) fibers end as free nerve endings.

=== Classification ===
The term &quot;free nerve endings&quot; dates back to the 1890s, originally characterized by the absence of other cellular structures at their terminals. Observations that led to this characterization were limited by the relatively low resolution of light microscopes. Advances in non-optical imaging such as electron microscopy allowed for higher resolution examination of free nerve endings, enabling the finding that they are most often bundles of axons surrounded by a Remak bundle rather than truly unenclosed. Such discoveries have led to the proposal of more accurate terminology such as &quot;fine nerve endings&quot; or &quot;non-corpuscular afferent nerve endings.&quot;

<text>The Manticore is the second novel in Robertson Davies&#x27; Deptford Trilogy.

Published in 1972 by Macmillan of Canada, it deals with the aftermath of the mysterious death of Percy Boyd &quot;Boy&quot; Staunton retold during a series of conversations between Staunton&#x27;s son and a Jungian psychoanalyst.

The title refers to elements of the subconscious which unfold through the story and are eventually manifested as a fantastic mythical creature: a manticore.

&quot;The Manticore&quot; won the Governor-General&#x27;s Literary Award in the English-language fiction category in 1972.

==Principal characters==
* David Staunton – Son of the super-rich industrialist Boy Staunton, he is the narrator of the novel. After a psychotic episode in Toronto he seeks out the help of Jungian psychoanalysts in Zurich. He is a famous barrister, an alcoholic, and a keen patron of the arts, with a heightened sense of morality and a hero worship for his father mixed with filial defiance.
* Johanna Von Haller – David Staunton&#x27;s Jungian analyst in Zurich. More clever than Staunton in debate, she guides him through the multiple phases of Jungian analysis, being the subject of his projections of the shadow, the friend, and the anima. She warns Staunton that theirs is only the first phase of analysis. She has helped him discover &quot;who&quot; he is. The next phase would help him discover &quot;what&quot; he is (an allusion to the quest to discover the collective unconscious in oneself).
* Dunstan Ramsay – The narrator of the novel &quot;Fifth Business&quot;. Born at the turn of the twentieth century he is maimed in World War I, wins a Victoria Cross, and devotes his life to the study of saints and myth. He watched over David Staunton during his youth while his father was absent. David is fixated on him, believing him to possibly be his father through an alleged affair with his mother.
* Boy Staunton – David Staunton&#x27;s father. Through his immense business skills he becomes fabulously wealthy in the sugar processing business in Canada. He has almost no insight into himself, but is a charming man with an immense need for sexual gratification. David Staunton idealizes his father at the start of the novel, and his narrative can be seen as an extended effort to know who his father really was.
* Leola Staunton – David Staunton&#x27;s mother and the ravishing wife of Boy Staunton and first love of Dunstan Ramsay. A sometimes weak, sometimes strong woman who cannot live up to her ambitious husband&#x27;s expectations.
* Liselotte (Liesl) Naegeli – Daughter of a millionaire Swiss watchmaker who assists Magnus Eisengrim in his travelling magic show. She is bisexual, and the victim of an early adolescent affliction (never specified but possibly acromegaly) which leaves her unusually tall and with large features. After David&#x27;s analysis, she tries to shock him into understanding the nature of the collective unconscious.
* Magnus Eisengrim – Master magician and illusionist, he is a permanent guest at the Swiss mountain retreat of Liselotte Naegeli and much despised initially by David Staunton for his presumed role in his father&#x27;s death. During an extended Christmas holiday at the Naegeli mansion, Staunton comes to a grudging acceptance and perhaps even admiration of Eisengrim. His ability to accept Eisengrim symbolizes the last step in Staunton&#x27;s evolution towards a &quot;whole&quot; human who can take or leave others without upset.

<text>Stimulus modality, also called sensory modality, is one aspect of a stimulus or what is perceived after a stimulus. For example, the temperature modality is registered after heat or cold stimulate a receptor. Some sensory modalities include: light, sound, temperature, taste, pressure, and smell. The type and location of the sensory receptor activated by the stimulus plays the primary role in coding the sensation. All sensory modalities work together to heighten stimuli sensation when necessary.

== Multimodal perception ==
Multimodal perception is the ability of the mammalian nervous system to combine all of the different inputs of the sensory nervous system to result in an enhanced detection or identification of a particular stimulus. Combinations of all sensory modalities are done in cases where a single sensory modality results in an ambiguous and incomplete result.

Integration of all sensory modalities occurs when multimodal neurons receive sensory information which overlaps with different modalities. Multimodal neurons are found in the superior colliculus; they respond to the versatility of various sensory inputs. The multimodal neurons lead to change of behavior and assist in analyzing behavior responses to certain stimulus. Information from two or more senses is encountered. Multimodal perception is not limited to one area of the brain: many brain regions are activated when sensory information is perceived from the environment. In fact, the hypothesis of having a centralized multisensory region is receiving continually more speculation, as several regions previously uninvestigated are now considered multimodal. The reasons behind this are currently being investigated by several research groups, but it is now understood to approach these issues from a decentralized theoretical perspective. Moreover, several labs using invertebrate model organisms will provide invaluable information to the community as these are more easily studied and are considered to have decentralized nervous systems.

===Lip reading===
Lip reading is a multimodal process for humans. By watching movements of lips and face, humans get conditioned and practice lip reading. Silent lip reading activates the auditory cortex. When sounds are matched or mismatched with the movements of the lips, temporal sulcus of the left hemisphere becomes more active.

===Integration effect===
Multimodal perception comes into effect when a unimodal stimulus fails to produce a response. Integration effect is applied when the brain detects weak unimodal signals and combines them to create a multimodal perception for the mammal. Integration effect is plausible when different stimuli are coincidental. This integration is depressed when multisensory information is not coincidentally presented.

===Polymodality===
&quot;Polymodality&quot; is the feature of a single receptor of responding to multiple modalities, such as free nerve endings which can respond to temperature, mechanical stimuli (touch, pressure, stretch) or pain (nociception).

==Light modality==

===Description===
The stimulus modality for vision is light; the human eye is able to access only a limited section of the electromagnetic spectrum, between 380 and 760 nanometres. Specific inhibitory responses that take place in the visual cortex help create a visual focus on a specific point rather than the entire surrounding.

===Perception===
To perceive a light stimulus, the eye must first refract the light so that it directly hits the retina. Refraction in the eye is completed through the combined efforts of the cornea, lens and iris. The transduction of light into neural activity occurs via the photoreceptor cells in the retina. When there is no light, Vitamin A in the body attaches itself to another molecule and becomes a protein. The entire structure consisting of the two molecules becomes a photopigment. When a particle of light hits the photoreceptors of the eye, the two molecules come apart from each other and a chain of chemical reactions occurs. The chemical reaction begins with the photoreceptor sending a message to a neuron called the bipolar cell through the use of an action potential, or nerve impulse. Finally, a message is sent to the ganglion cell and then finally the brain.

===Adaptation===
The eye is able to detect a visual stimulus when the photons (light packets) cause a photopigment molecule, primarily rhodopsin, to come apart. Rhodopsin, which is usually pink, becomes bleached in the process. At high levels of light, photopigments are broken apart faster than can be regenerated. Because a low number of photopigments have been regenerated, the eyes are not sensitive to light. When entering a dark room after being in a well lit area, the eyes require time for a good quantity of rhodopsin to regenerate. As more time passes, there is a higher chance that the photons will split an unbleached photopigment because the rate of regeneration will have surpassed the rate of bleaching. This is called adaptation.

===Colour stimuli===
Humans are able to see an array of colours because light in the visible spectrum is made up of different wavelengths (from 380 to 760 nm). Our ability to see in colour is due to three different cone cells in the retina, containing three different photopigments. The three cones are each specialized to best pick up a certain wavelength (420, 530 and 560 nm or roughly the colours blue, green and red). The brain is able to distinguish the wavelength and colour in the field of vision by figuring out which cone has been stimulated. The physical dimensions of colour include wavelength, intensity and purity while the related perceptual dimensions include hue, brightness and saturation.

Primates are the only mammals with colour vision.

The Trichromatic theory was proposed in 1802 by Thomas Young. According to Young, the human visual system is able to create any colour through the collection of information from the three cones. The system will put together the information and systematize a new colour based on the amount of each hue that has been detected.

===Subliminal visual stimuli===
Some studies show that subliminal stimuli can affect attitude. In a 1992 study Krosnick, Betz, Jussim and Lynn conducted a study where participants were shown a series of slides in which different people were going through normal every day activities (i.e. going to the car, sitting in a restaurant). These slides were preceded by slides that caused either positive emotional arousal (i.e. bridal couple, a child with a Mickey Mouse doll) or negative emotional arousal (i.e. a bucket of snakes, a face on fire) for a period 13 milliseconds that participants consciously perceived as a sudden flash of light. None of the individuals were told of the subliminal images. The experiment found that during the questionnaire round, participants were more likely to assign positive personality traits to those in the pictures that were preceded by the positive subliminal images and negative personality traits to those in the pictures that were preceded by the negative subliminal images.

===Tests===
Some common tests that measure visual health include visual acuity tests, refraction tests, visual field tests and colour vision tests. Visual acuity tests are the most common tests and they measure the ability to bring details into focus at different distances. Usually this test is conducted by having participants read a map of letters or symbols while one eye is covered. Refraction tests measure the eye&#x27;s need for glasses or corrective lenses. This test is able to detect whether a person may be nearsighted or farsighted. These conditions occur when the light rays entering the eye are unable to converge on a single spot on the retina. Both refractive errors require corrective lenses in order to cure blurriness of vision. Visual field tests detect any gaps in peripheral vision. In healthy normal vision, an individual should be able to partially perceive objects to the left or right of their field of view using both eyes at one time. The center field of vision is seen in most detail. Colour vision tests are used to measure one&#x27;s ability to distinguish colours. It is used to diagnose colour blindness. This test is also used as an important step in some job screening processes as the ability to see colour in such jobs may be crucial. Examples include military work or law enforcement.

==Sound modality==

===Description===
The stimulus modality for hearing is sound. Sound is created through changes in the pressure of the air. As an object vibrates, it compresses the surrounding molecules of air as it moves towards a given point and expands the molecules as it moves away from the point. Periodicity in sound waves is measured in hertz. Humans, on average, are able to detect sounds as pitched when they contain periodic or quasi-periodic variations that fall between the range of 30 to 20000 hertz.

===Perception===
When there are vibrations in the air, the eardrum is stimulated. The eardrum collects these vibrations and sends them to receptor cells. The ossicles which are connected to the eardrum pass the vibrations to the fluid-filled cochlea. Once the vibrations reach the cochlea, the stirrup (part of the ossicles) puts pressure on the oval window. This opening allows the vibrations to move through the liquid in the cochlea where the receptive organ is able to sense it.

===Pitch, loudness and timbre===
There are many different qualities in sound stimuli including loudness, pitch and timbre.

The human ear is able to detect differences in pitch through the movement of auditory hair cells found on the basilar membrane. High frequency sounds will stimulate the auditory hair cells at the base of the basilar membrane while medium frequency sounds cause vibrations of auditory hair cells located at the middle of the basilar membrane. For frequencies that are lower than 200 Hz, the tip of the basilar membrane vibrates in sync with the sound waves. In turn, neurons are fired at the same rate as the vibrations. The brain is able to measure the vibrations and is then aware of any low frequency pitches.

When a louder sound is heard, more hair cells are stimulated and the intensity of firing of axons in the cochlear nerve is increased. However, because the rate of firing also defines low pitch the brain has an alternate way of encoding for loudness of low frequency sounds. The number of hair cells that are stimulated is thought to communicate loudness in low pitch frequencies.

Aside from pitch and loudness, another quality that distinguishes sound stimuli is timbre. Timbre allows us to hear the difference between two instruments that are playing at the same frequency and loudness, for example. When two simple tones are put together they create a complex tone. The simple tones of an instrument are called harmonics or overtones. Timbre is created by putting the harmonics together with the fundamental frequency (a sound&#x27;s basic pitch). When a complex sound is heard, it causes different parts in the basilar membrane to become simultaneously stimulated and flex. In this way, different timbres can be distinguished.

===Sound stimuli and human fetuses===
A number of studies have shown that a human fetus will respond to sound stimuli coming from the outside world. In a series of 214 tests conducted on 7 pregnant women, a reliable increase in fetal movement was detected in the minute directly following the application of a sound stimulus to the abdomen of the mother with a frequency of 120 per second.

===Tests===
Hearing tests are administered to ensure optimal function of the ear and to observe whether or not sound stimuli is entering the ear drum and reaching the brain as should be. The most common hearing tests require the spoken response to words or tones. Some hearing tests include the whispered speech test, pure tone audiometry, the tuning fork test, speech reception and word recognition tests, otoacoustic emissions (OAE) test and auditory brainstem response (ABR) test.

During a whispered speech test, the participant is asked to cover the opening of one ear with a finger. The tester will then step back 1 to 2 feet behind the participant and say a series of words in a soft whisper. The participant is then asked to repeat what is heard. If the participant is unable to distinguish the word, the tester will speak progressively louder until the participant is able to understand what is being said. The other ear is then tested.

In pure tone audiometry, an audiometer is used to play a series of tones using headphones. The participants listen to the tones which will vary in pitch and loudness. The test will play with the volume controls and the participant is asked to signal when he or she can no longer hear the tone being played. The testing is completed after listening to a range of pitches. Each ear is tested individually.

During the tuning fork test, the tester will have the tuning fork vibrate so that it makes a sound. The tuning fork is placed in a specific place around the participant and hearing is observed. In some instances, individuals will show trouble hearing in places such as behind the ear.

Speech recognition and word recognition tests measure how well an individual can hear normal day-to-day conversation. The participant is told to repeat conversation being spoken at different volumes. The spondee threshold test is a related test that detects the loudness at which the participant is able to repeat half of a list of two syllable words or spondees.

Otoacoustic emissions test (OAE) and auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing measures the brain&#x27;s response to sounds. The OAE measures hearing of newborns by placing an emitting sound into the baby&#x27;s ear through a probe. A microphone placed in the baby&#x27;s ear canal will pick up the inner ear&#x27;s response to sound stimulation and allows for observation. The ABR, also known as the brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) test or auditory brainstem evoked potential (ABEP) test measure the brain&#x27;s response to clicking sounds sent through headphones. Electrodes on the scalp and earlobes record a graph of the response.

==Taste modality==

===Description===

==== Taste modality in mammals ====
In mammals, taste stimuli are encountered by axonless receptor cells located in taste buds on the tongue and
pharynx. Receptor cells disseminate onto different neurons and convey the message of a particular taste in a single medullar nucleus. This pheromone detection system deals with taste stimuli. The pheromone detection system is distinct from the normal taste system, and is designed like the olfactory system.

==== Taste modality in flies and mammals ====
In insect and mammalian taste, receptor cells changes into attractive or aversive stimulus. The number of taste receptors in a mammalian tongue and on the tongue of the fly (labellum) is same in amount. Most of the receptors are dedicated to detect repulsive ligand.

=== Perception ===
Perceptions of taste is generated by the following sensory afferents: gustatory, olfactory, and somatosensory fibers. Taste perception is created by combining multiple sensory inputs. Different modalities help determine perception of taste especially when attention is drawn to particular sensory characteristics which is different from taste.

===Integration of taste and smell modality===
Impression of both taste and smell occurs in heteromodal regions of the limbic and paralimbic brain. Taste–odor
integration occurs at earlier stages of processing. By life experience, factors such as the physiological significance of a given stimulus is perceived. Learning and affective processing are the primary functions of limbic and paralimbic brain. Taste perception is a combination of oral somatosensation and retronasal olfaction.

===Pleasure of food===
The sensation of taste come from oral somatosensory stimulation and with retronasal olfaction. The perceived pleasure encountered when eating and drinking is influenced by:
# sensory features, such as taste quality
# experience, such as prior exposure to taste-odor mixtures
# internal state
# cognitive context, such as information about brand

==Temperature modality==

===Description===

Temperature modality excites or elicits a symptom through cold or hot temperature. Different mammalian species have different temperature modality.

===Perception===

The cutaneous somatosensory system detects changes in temperature. The perception begins when thermal stimuli from a homeostatic set-point excite temperature specific sensory nerves in the skin. Then with the help of sensing range, specific thermosensory fibers respond to warmth and to cold. Then specific cutaneous cold and warm receptors conduct units that exhibit a discharge at constant skin temperature.

===Nerve fibers for temperature===

Warm and cold sensitive nerve fibers differ in structure and function. The cold-sensitive and warm-sensitive nerve fibers are underneath the skin surface. Terminals of each temperature-sensitive fiber do not branch away to different organs in the body. They form a small sensitive point which are unique from neighboring fibers. Skin used by the single receptor ending of a temperature-sensitive nerve fiber is small. There are 20 cold points per square centimeter in the lips, 4 in the finger, and less than 1 cold point per square centimeter in trunk areas. There are 5 times as many cold sensitive points as warm sensitive points.

==Pressure modality==

===Description===
The sense of touch, or tactile perception, is what allows organisms to feel the world around them. The environment acts as an external stimulus, and tactile perception is the act of passively exploring the world to simply sense it. To make sense of the stimuli, an organism will undergo active exploration, or haptic perception, by moving their hands or other areas with environment-skin contact. This will give a sense of what is being perceived, and give information about size, shape, weight, temperature, and material. Tactile stimulation can be direct in the form of bodily contact, or indirect through the use of a tool or probe. Direct and indirect send different types messages to the brain, but both provide information regarding roughness, hardness, stickiness, and warmth. The use of a probe elicits a response based on the vibrations in the instrument rather than direct environmental information. Tactual perception gives information regarding cutaneous stimuli (pressure, vibration, and temperature), kinaesthetic stimuli (limb movement), and proprioceptive stimuli (position of the body). There are varying degrees of tactual sensitivity and thresholds, both between individuals and between different time periods in an individual&#x27;s life. It has been observed that individuals have differing levels of tactile sensitivity between each hand. This may be due to callouses forming on the skin of the most used hand, creating a buffer between the stimulus and the receptor. Alternately, the difference in sensitivity may be due to a difference in the cerebral functions or ability of the left and right hemisphere. Tests have also shown that deaf children have a greater degree of tactile sensitivity than that of children with normal hearing ability, and that girls generally have a greater degree of sensitivity than that of boys.

Tactile information is often used as additional stimuli to resolve a sensory ambiguity. For example, a surface can be seen as rough, but this inference can only be proven through touching the material. When sensory information from each modality involved corresponds, the ambiguity is resolved.

===Somatosensory information===
Touch messages, in comparison to other sensory stimuli, have a large distance to travel to get to the brain. Tactile perception is achieved through the response of mechanoreceptors (cutaneous receptors) in the skin that detect physical stimuli. The response from a mechanoreceptor detecting pressure can be experienced as a touch, discomfort, or pain. Mechanoreceptors are situated in highly vascularized skin, and appear in both glabrous and hairy skin. Each mechanoreceptor is tuned to a different sensitivity, and will fire its action potential only when there is enough energy. The axons of these single tactile receptors will converge into a single nerve trunk, and the signal is then sent to the spinal cord where the message makes its way to the somatosensory system in the brain.

====Mechanoreceptors====

There are four types of mechanoreceptors: Meissner corpuscles and merkel cell neurite complexes, located between the epidermis and dermis, and Pacinian corpuscles and Ruffini endings, located deep within the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Mechanoreceptors are classified in terms of their adaptation rate and the size of their receptive field. Specific mechanoreceptors and their functions include:

* Thermoreceptors that detect changes in skin temperature.
* Kinesthetic receptors detect movements of the body, and the position of the limbs.
* Nociceptors that have bare nerve endings that detect tissue damage and give the sensation of pain.

===Tests===
A common test used to measure the sensitivity of a person to tactile stimuli is measuring their two-point touch threshold. This is the smallest separation of two points at which two distinct points of contact can be sensed rather than one. Different parts of the body have different degrees of tactile acuity, with extremities such as the fingers, face, and toes being the most sensitive. When two distinct points are perceived, it means that your brain receives two different signals. The differences of acuity for different parts of the body are the result of differences in the concentration of receptors.

===Use in clinical psychology===
Tactile stimulation is used in clinical psychology through the method of prompting. Prompting is the use of a set of instructions designed to guide a participant through learning a behavior. A physical prompt involves stimulation in the form of physically guided behavior in the appropriate situation and environment. The physical stimulus perceived through prompting is similar to the physical stimulus that would be experienced in a real-world situation, and is makes the target behavior more likely in a real situation.

==Smell modality==

===Sensation===

The sense of smell is called olfaction. All materials constantly shed molecules, which float into the nose or are sucked in through breathing. Inside the nasal chambers is the neuroepithelium, a lining deep within the nostrils that contains the receptors responsible for detecting molecules that are small enough to smell. These receptor neurons then synapse at the olfactory cranial nerve (CN I), which sends the information to the olfactory bulbs in the brain for initial processing. The signal is then sent to the remaining olfactory cortex for more complex processing.

===Odors===
An olfactory sensation is called an odor. For a molecule to trigger olfactory receptor neurons, it must have specific properties. The molecule must be:
# volatile (able to float through the air)
# small (less than 5.8 x 10-22 grams)
# hydrophobic (repellant to water)

However, humans do not detect or process the smell of various common molecules such as nitrogen or water vapor.

Olfactory ability can vary due to different conditions. For example, olfactory detection thresholds can change due to molecules with differing lengths of carbon chains. A molecule with a longer carbon chain is easier to detect, and has a lower detection threshold. Additionally, women generally have lower olfactory thresholds than men, and this effect is magnified during a woman&#x27;s ovulatory period. People can sometimes experience a hallucination of smell, as in the case of phantosmia.

===Interaction with other modalities===
Olfaction interacts with other sensory modalities in significant ways. The strongest interaction is that of olfaction with taste. Studies have shown that an odor coupled with a taste increases the perceived intensity of the taste, and that an absence of a corresponding smell decreases the perceived intensity of a taste. The olfactory stimulation can occur before or during the episode of taste stimulation. The dual perception of the stimulus produces an interaction that facilitates association of the experience through an additive neural response and memorization of the stimulus. This association can also be made between olfactory and tactile stimuli during the act of swallowing. In each case, temporal synchrony is important.

===Tests===
A common psychophysical test of olfactory ability is the triangle test. In this test, the participant is given three odors to smell. Of these three odors, two are the same and one is different, and the participant must choose which odor is the unique one. To test the sensitivity of olfaction, the staircase method is often used. In this method, the odor&#x27;s concentration is increased until the participant is able to sense it, and subsequently decreased until the participant reports no sensation.

<text>Joann Sfar (; born 28 August 1971) is a French comics artist, comic book creator, novelist, and film director.

==Life and career==
Sfar was born in Nice, the son of Lilou, a pop singer, who died when he was three, and André Sfar, a lawyer well known for prosecuting Neo-Nazis. As a result of his mother&#x27;s early death, Sfar was raised by his father and maternal grandfather, a military doctor of Ukrainian origin in the Alsace-Lorraine Independent Brigade (France) during World War II. Sfar&#x27;s grandfather reportedly saved the right hand of the brigade&#x27;s leader, novelist André Malraux, for which he was awarded French citizenship.

Sfar is considered one of the most important artists of the new wave of Franco-Belgian comics, though he has rejected the assertion that he, along with artists such as Christophe Blain, Marjane Satrapi, and Lewis Trondheim, sought to create an alternative scene or a new movement in comics. Many of his comics were published by L&#x27;Association which was founded in 1990 by Jean-Christophe Menu and six other artists. He also worked with many of the group&#x27;s main artists, e.g. David B. and Lewis Trondheim. The &quot;Donjon&quot; series, which he created with Trondheim, has a cult following in many countries.

Some of his comics are inspired by his Jewish heritage. Sfar is the son of Jewish parents (an Ashkenazi mother whose family was from Ukraine and a Sephardic father from Algeria). He himself says that there is Ashkenazi humor in his &quot;Professeur Bell&quot; series (loosely based on Joseph Bell), whereas &quot;Le chat du rabbin&quot; is clearly inspired by his Sephardic side. &quot;Les olives noires&quot; is a series about a Jewish child living in Israel at the time of Jesus. Like &quot;Le chat du rabbin&quot;, the series contains a lot of historical and theological information.

His main influences are Fred and André Franquin, as well as Marc Chagall, Chaïm Soutine, Will Eisner, Hugo Pratt and John Buscema.

From 2009 to 2010, Sfar wrote and directed &quot;Gainsbourg: Vie Héroïque&quot;, a biopic of the illustrious French songwriter and singer, of whom Sfar is a self-confessed fanatic. The film, which draws substantially on Sfar&#x27;s abilities as a comic book artist through its extensive use of fantasy artwork, animation and puppetry, was released in 2010 to general critical acclaim.

Sfar&#x27;s book &quot;L’Eternel&quot; has been adapted for a live-action drama entitled &quot;Monsters’ Shrink&quot; by Canal plus&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="569654" wikidata="Q16932677" url="?curid=569654" title="Rural Electrification Act">
<text>The Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (REA), enacted on May 20, 1936, provided federal loans for the installation of electrical distribution systems to serve isolated rural areas of the United States.

The funding was channeled through cooperative electric power companies, hundreds of which still exist today. These member-owned cooperatives purchased power on a wholesale basis and distributed it using their own network of transmission and distribution lines. The Rural Electrification Act was one of many New Deal proposals by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to remedy high unemployment during the Great Depression.

==History==
On May 11, 1935, President Roosevelt issued , which created the Rural Electrification Administration. In 1936, the Congress endorsed Roosevelt&#x27;s action by passing the Rural Electrification Act. At the time the Rural Electrification Act was passed, electricity was commonplace in cities but largely unavailable in farms, ranches, and other rural places. Representative John E. Rankin and Senator George William Norris were supporters of the Rural Electrification Act, which was signed into law by Roosevelt on May 20, 1936.

Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn was a major proponent of the REA, which he helped pass in 1936 as Chairman of the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. Rayburn stated in 1959 that ninety percent of farm homes in the U.S. were electrified, compared to three percent in the early 1930s.

==Technical issues==
In the 1930s, the provision of power to remote areas was not thought to be economically feasible. A 2300-volt distribution system was then used in cities. This relatively low voltage could be carried only about before the voltage drop became unacceptable. REA cooperatives used a 6900-volt distribution network (soon changed to the present-day 12,470/7200V 4-wire Y system), which could support much longer runs (up to about ). Despite requiring more expensive transformers at each home, the overall system cost was manageable.

==Wiring homes and farms==
REA crews traveled through the American countryside, bringing teams of electricians along with them. The electricians added wiring to houses and barns to utilize the newly available power provided by the line crews. A standard REA installation in a house (post-World War II) consisted of:

* A 60-amp, 230-volt fuse panel, with:
# A 60-amp range circuit
# A 20-amp kitchen circuit
# Two or three 15-amp lighting circuits

A ceiling-mounted light fixture was installed in each room, usually controlled by a single switch mounted near a door. At most, one outlet was installed per room, since plug-connected appliances were expensive and uncommon. Wiring was performed using type NM (nonmetallic sheathed cable), insulated with asbestos-reinforced rubber covered with jute and tar.

Many of these original installations still exist today, though most have been augmented to support a greater number and variety of appliances.

==Later amendments==
Some amendments to the Rural Electrification Act include:

* 1944: loan terms increased to 35 years; the act is made permanent
* 1949: extended the act to allow loans to telephone companies wishing to extend their connections to unconnected rural areas
* 1993: provisions to restructure the direct loan programs for rural electricity, telephone cooperatives, and energy conservation market
* December 8, 1993: North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act—The &quot;Buy American&quot; provision to now include Mexico and Canada.
* 2008: provisions for access to rural broadband telecommunications network and rural internet
* 2014: pilot program for rural gigabit broadband network

<doc id="569669" wikidata="Q287632" url="?curid=569669" title="Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier">
<text>The &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;-class nuclear-powered aircraft carriers are currently being constructed for the United States Navy, which intends to eventually acquire ten of these ships in order to replace current carriers on a one-for-one basis, starting with the lead ship of her class, (CVN-78), replacing , and later the carriers. The new vessels have a hull similar to the &quot;Nimitz&quot; class, but they carry technologies since developed with the CVN(X)/CVN-21 program, such as the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), as well as other design features intended to improve efficiency and reduce operating costs, including sailing with smaller crews. This class of aircraft carriers is named after former U.S. President Gerald R. Ford. CVN-78 was procured in 2008 and commissioned into service in July 2017. The second ship of the class, , is scheduled to enter service in 2025.

==Design features==
Carriers of the &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot; class have:
* Advanced Arresting Gear.
* Automation, allowing a crew of several hundred fewer than the &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class carrier.
* The updated RIM-162 Evolved SeaSparrow Missile.
* An AN/SPY-3 X Band multifunction radar and an AN/SPY-4 S Band volume search radar.&lt;ref name=&quot;AN/SPY-4&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Designated together as Dual Band Radar (DBR), initially developed for the s. Starting with &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; (CVN-79), the AN/SPY-6 will replace the AN/SPY-4 as the volume search component of the system.
* An Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) in place of traditional steam catapults for launching aircraft.
* A new nuclear reactor design (the A1B reactor) for greater power generation.
* Stealth features to reduce radar cross-section.
* The ability to carry up to 90 aircraft, including the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, Boeing EA-18G Growler, Grumman C-2 Greyhound, Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye, Lockheed Martin F-35C Lightning II, Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk helicopters, and unmanned combat aerial vehicles.

The biggest visible difference from earlier supercarriers is the more aft location of the island (superstructure). The &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;-class carriers will have a reduced whole-life cost due in part to reduced crew size. These ships are intended to sustain 160 sorties per day for 30-plus days, with a surge capability of 270 sorties per day. Director of Operational Testing Michael Gilmore has criticized the assumptions used in these forecasts as unrealistic and has indicated sortie rates similar to the 120/240 per day of the &quot;Nimitz&quot; class would be acceptable.

==Development==
The current in US naval service have been part of United States power projection strategy since &quot;Nimitz&quot; was commissioned in 1975. Displacing about 100,000 tons when fully loaded, a &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class carrier can steam in excess of , cruise without resupply for 90 days, and launch aircraft to strike targets hundreds of miles away. The endurance of the &quot;Nimitz&quot; class is exemplified by , which spent 159 days underway during Operation Enduring Freedom without visiting a port or being refueled.

The&quot; Nimitz&quot; design has accommodated many new technologies over the decades, but it has limited ability to support the most recent technical advances. As a 2005 Rand report said, &quot;The biggest problems facing the &quot;Nimitz&quot; class are the limited electrical power generation capability and the upgrade-driven increase in ship weight and erosion of the center-of-gravity margin needed to maintain ship stability.&quot;

With these constraints in mind, the US Navy developed what was initially known as the CVN-21 program, which evolved into CVN-78, &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;. Improvements were made through developing technologies and more efficient design. Major design changes include a larger flight deck, improvements in weapons and material handling, a new propulsion plant design that requires fewer people to operate and maintain, and a new, smaller island that has been pushed aft. Technological advances in electromagnetics have led to the development of an Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) and an Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG). An integrated warfare system, the Ship Self-Defense System (SSDS), has been developed to allow the ship to more easily take on new missions. The new Dual Band Radar (DBR) combines S-band and X-band radar.

These advances will allow the new &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;-class carriers to launch 25% more sorties, generate triple the electrical power with improved efficiency, and offer crew quality-of-life improvements.

===Flight deck===
Catapult No. 4 on the &quot;Nimitz&quot; class cannot launch fully loaded aircraft because of low wing clearance along the edge of the flight deck.

The movement of weapons from storage and assembly to the aircraft on the flight deck has also been streamlined and accelerated. Ordnance will be lifted to the centralized rearming location via higher-capacity weapons elevators that use linear motors. These elevators are located so that ordnance need not cross any areas of aircraft movement, thereby reducing traffic problems in the hangars and on the flight deck. In 2008, Rear Admiral Dennis M. Dwyer said these changes will make it hypothetically possible to rearm the airplanes in &quot;minutes instead of hours&quot;.

===Power generation===
The new Bechtel A1B reactor for the &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot; class is smaller and simpler, requires fewer crew, and yet is far more powerful than the &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class A4W reactor. Two reactors will be installed on each &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;-class carrier, providing a power generation capacity at least 25% greater than the 550 MW (thermal) of the two A4W reactors in a &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class carrier. The portion of thermal power allotted to electrical generation will be tripled.

The propulsion and power plant of the &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class carriers were designed in the 1960s, when onboard technologies required less electrical power. &quot;New technologies added to the &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class ships have generated increased demands for electricity; the current base load leaves little margin to meet expanding demands for power.&quot;

The &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;-class ships convert steam into power by piping it to four main turbine generators (MTG) to generate electricity for major ship systems, and the new electromagnetic catapults. The &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;-class ships use steam turbines for propulsion.

A larger power output is a major component of the integrated warfare system. Engineers took extra steps to ensure that integrating unforeseen technological advances onto a &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;-class aircraft carrier would be possible. The Navy expects the &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot; class will be part of the fleet for 90 years, until the year 2105, which means that the class must successfully accept new technology over the decades. Only half of the electric power generation capacity is used by currently planned systems, with half remaining available for future technologies.

===Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System===
The Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) launches aircraft by means of a catapult employing a linear induction motor rather than the steam piston used on the &quot;Nimitz&quot; class. The EMALS accelerates aircraft more smoothly, putting less stress on their airframes. The EMALS also weighs less, is expected to cost less and require less maintenance, and can launch both heavier and lighter aircraft than a steam piston-driven system. It also reduces the carrier&#x27;s requirement for fresh water, thus reducing the demand for energy-intensive desalination.

===Advanced Arresting Gear landing system===
Electromagnets are also being used in the new Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) system. The current system relies on hydraulics to slow and stop a landing aircraft. While the hydraulic system is effective, as demonstrated by more than fifty years of implementation, the AAG system offers a number of improvements. The current system is unable to capture unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) without damaging them due to extreme stresses on the airframe. UAVs do not have the necessary mass to drive the large hydraulic piston used to trap heavier, manned airplanes. By using electromagnetics, the energy absorption is controlled by a turbo-electric engine. This makes the trap smoother and reduces shock on airframes. Even though the system will look the same from the flight deck as its predecessor, it will be more flexible, safe, and reliable, and will require less maintenance and manning.

===Sensors and self-defense systems===

Another addition to the &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot; class is an integrated active electronically scanned array search and tracking radar system. The dual-band radar (DBR) was being developed by Raytheon, for both the &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class guided missile destroyers and the &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;-class aircraft carriers. The island can be kept smaller by replacing six to ten radar antennas with a single six-faced radar. The DBR works by combining the X band AN/SPY-3 multifunction radar with the S band AN/SPY-4 Volume Search Radar (VSR) emitters, distributed into three phased arrays. The S-band radar was later deleted from the &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class destroyers to save money.

The three faces dedicated to the X-band radar handle low-altitude tracking and radar illumination, while the three S-band faces handle target search and tracking regardless of weather. &quot;Operating simultaneously over two electromagnetic frequency ranges, the DBR marks the first time this functionality has been achieved using two frequencies coordinated by a single resource manager.&quot;

This new system has no moving parts, therefore minimizing maintenance and manning requirements for operation. The AN/SPY-3 consists of three active arrays and the Receiver/Exciter (REX) cabinets above-decks and the Signal and Data Processor (SDP) subsystem below-decks. The VSR has a similar architecture, with the beamforming and narrowband down-conversion functionality occurring in two additional cabinets per array. A central controller (the resource manager) resides in the Data Processor (DP). The DBR is the first radar system that uses a central controller and two active-array radars operating at different frequencies. The DBR gets its power from the Common Array Power System (CAPS), which comprises Power Conversion Units (PCUs) and Power Distribution Units (PDUs). The DBR is cooled via a closed-loop cooling system called the Common Array Cooling System (CACS).

The Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR) is a new design surveillance radar that is to be installed in the second &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;-class aircraft carrier, , in lieu of the Dual Band radar. The s starting with LHA-8 and the planned LX(R) will also have this radar. The EASR suite&#x27;s initial per-unit cost will be about $180 million less than the DBR, for which the estimate is about $500 million.

===Possible upgrades===
Future defense systems, such as free-electron laser directed-energy weapons, electric armor, and tracking systems will require more power. &quot;Only half of the electrical power-generation capability on CVN-78 is needed to run currently planned systems, including EMALS. CVN-78 will thus have the power reserves that the &quot;Nimitz&quot; class lacks to run lasers and electric armor.&quot; The addition of new technologies, power systems, design layout, and better control systems results in an increased sortie rate of 25% over the &quot;Nimitz&quot; class and a 25% reduction in manpower required to operate.

Waste management technology will be deployed on &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;. Co-developed with the Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, PyroGenesis Canada Inc. - was in 2008 awarded the contract to outfit the ship with a Plasma Arc Waste Destruction System (PAWDS). This compact system will treat all combustible solid waste generated on board the ship. After having completed factory acceptance testing in Montreal, the system was scheduled to be shipped to the Huntington Ingalls shipyard in late 2011 for installation on the carrier.

The Navy is developing a free-electron laser (FEL) to defend against cruise missiles and small-boat swarms.

===3D computer-aided design===
Newport News Shipbuilding used a full-scale three-dimensional product model developed in Dassault Systèmes CATIA V5 to design and plan the construction of the &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot; class of aircraft carriers.

The CVN 78 class was designed to have better weapons movement paths, largely eliminating horizontal movements within the ship. Current plans call for advanced weapons elevators to move from storage areas to dedicated weapons handling areas. Sailors would use motorized carts to move the weapons from storage to the elevators at different levels of the weapons magazines. Linear motors are being considered for the advanced weapons elevators. The elevators will also be relocated such that they will not impede aircraft operations on the flight deck. The redesign of the weapons movement paths and the location of the weapons elevators on the flight deck will reduce manpower and contribute to a much higher sortie generation rate.

===Crew accommodations===
Systems that reduce crew workload have allowed the ship&#x27;s company on &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;-class carriers to total only 2,600 sailors, about 700 fewer than a &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class carrier. The massive, 180-man berthing areas on the &quot;Nimitz&quot; class are replaced by 40-rack berthing areas on &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;-class carriers. The smaller berthings are quieter and the layout requires less foot traffic through other spaces. Typically the racks are stacked three high, with locker space per person. The berthings do not feature modern &quot;sit-up&quot; racks with more headroom; bottom and middle racks only accommodate a sailor lying down. Each berthing has an associated head, including showers, vacuum-powered septic-system toilets (no urinals since the berthings are built gender-neutral) and sinks to reduce travel and traffic to access those facilities. WiFi-enabled lounges are located across the passageway in separate spaces from the berthing&#x27;s racks.

Since deployment, the first two carriers of the class have run into problems with the plumbing of the waste system. The pipes were too narrow to handle the load of users, resulting in the vacuum failing and repeatedly clogged toilets. To alleviate the problem, specialized acidic cleaning solutions have been used to flush out the sewage system. These cleaning treatments cost about $400,000 each time, resulting in a substantial unplanned increase in the lifetime expense of operating these ships according to the GAO. These cleanings will have to be performed for the lifetime of the ship.

===Medical facilities===
&quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;, first in the class, has an on-board hospital that includes a full laboratory, pharmacy, operating room, 3-bed intensive care unit, 2-bed emergency room, and 41-bed hospital ward, staffed by 11 medical officers and 30 hospital corpsmen.

==Construction==
Construction of the first vessel in the class, CVN-78 &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;, officially began on 11 August 2005, when Northrop Grumman held a ceremonial steel cut for a 15-ton plate that would form part of a side shell unit of the carrier, but construction began in earnest in early 2007. The carrier was assembled at Newport News Shipbuilding, a division of Huntington Ingalls Industries (formerly Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding) in Newport News, Virginia. This is the only shipyard in the United States that can build nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.

In 2005, &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot; was estimated to cost at least $13 billion: $5 billion for research and development plus $8 billion to build. A 2009 report raised the estimate to $14 billion, including $9 billion for construction. In 2013, the life-cycle cost per operating day of a carrier strike group (including aircraft) was estimated at $6.5 million by the Center for New American Security.

Originally, a total of three carriers were authorized for construction, but if the &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class carriers and were to be replaced one-for-one, 11 carriers would be required over the life of the program. The last &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class aircraft carrier is to be decommissioned in 2058.

In a speech on 6 April 2009, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced that each &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;-class carrier would be built over five years, yielding a &quot;more fiscally sustainable path&quot; and a 10-carrier fleet after 2040. That changed in December 2016, when Navy Secretary Ray Mabus signed a Force Structure Assessment calling for a 355-ship fleet with 12 aircraft carriers. If enacted, this policy would require each &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;-class carrier to be built in three to four years.

===First-of-class type design changes===
As construction of CVN-78 progressed, the shipbuilder made first-of-class type design changes, which it will use to update the model before the construction of the remaining vessels of its class. Several of these design changes related to EMALS configuration changes, which required electrical, wiring, and other changes within the ship. The Navy anticipates additional design changes stemming from remaining advanced arresting gear development and testing. According to the Navy, many of these 19,000 changes were programmed into the construction schedule early on—a result of the government&#x27;s decision, at contract award, to introduce improvements to the ship&#x27;s warfare systems during construction, which are heavily dependent on evolving commercial technologies.

==Naming==
There was a movement by the Carrier Veterans&#x27; Association to have CVN-78 named after &quot;America&quot; rather than after President Ford. Eventually, the amphibious assault ship LHA-6 was named .

On 27 May 2011, the U.S. Department of Defense announced the name of CVN-79 would be .

On 1 December 2012, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus announced that CVN-80 would be named USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The information was delivered during a prerecorded speech as part of the deactivation ceremony for the previous . The future will be the ninth U.S. Navy ship to bear this name.

On 20 January 2020, during a ceremony in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas B. Modly named a future &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;-class aircraft carrier in honor of World War II hero Doris Miller. This will be the first aircraft carrier named for an African American, and the first aircraft carrier to be named for a sailor in the enlisted ranks. It is the second ship named in honor of Miller, who was the first African American to be awarded the Navy Cross.

On 13 January 2025, President Joe Biden announced that CVN-82 and CVN-83 would be named after former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush respectively.

==Ships in class==
There are expected to be ten ships of this class. To date, six have been announced:

<text>BBC Radio Humberside is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the former county of Humberside which includes the unitary authorities of East Riding of Yorkshire, Kingston upon Hull, North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire in England.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios at Queen&#x27;s Gardens in Hull.

According to RAJAR, the station had a weekly audience of 101,000 listeners and a 5.0% share as of December 2023.

==History==
BBC Radio Humberside began broadcasting in 1971 from studios above a post office on Chapel Street in Hull, three years before the county of Humberside was created. It has retained its name despite Humberside being abolished as a county in 1996. The station was initially only broadcast on VHF, with Medium wave broadcasts beginning in late 1971.

On the first night of broadcasting, many West Yorkshire rugby league fans were disappointed when the relatively powerful High Hunsley transmitter signal was broadcast instead of BBC Radio Leeds, so they heard a commentary of Hull KR v Widnes. 

In 1979, Radio Humberside stopped broadcasting dedicated agricultural programmes despite serving agricultural areas.

For many years, the station sponsored a horse race at Beverley Racecourse. Originally, the race was called the &quot;Radio Humberside Handicap&quot;, which became the &quot;BBC Radio Humberside Stakes&quot; in the 1980s. By the 1990s, this included the &quot;Martin Plenderleith Conditions Stakes&quot;, the &quot;Steve Massam Selling Stakes&quot;, the &quot;Peter Adamson Maiden Auction Stakes&quot;, the &quot;Charlie Partridge Selling Stakes&quot; and the &quot;Chris Langmore Handicap&quot; that all took place on the same day in early July.
In line with the other BBC local stations in the region, BBC Radio Humberside was part of the BBC Night Network when it was formed in May 1989, providing the station with regular all-evening programming, albeit regional rather than local although prior to this, regional specialist music programming had been aired. Initially, this was a single Saturday evening 45-minute programme consisting of organ music which aired during the winter sports period at 6:45 pm on BBC Radios Leeds, York and Humberside. Then in August 1986 Radio Humberside joined with the other BBC local stations in Yorkshire in broadcasting an early evening service of specialist music programmes. The launch of the BBC Night Network saw regional programmes broadcast nightly from 6.05 pm (6 pm at the weekend) until midnight. In May 1991, local programming was expanded by an hour, continuing until 7 pm. This coincided with the &quot;Night Network&quot;&#x27;s expansion to include the BBC&#x27;s north-west stations, The following year, Night Network programming was extended on weeknights until 12:30 am, and to 1 am by the end of that decade. Prior to the start of regional programming, the station usually stopped broadcasting at around 6 pm and carried BBC Radio 2 at other times.

In 2004, the station moved to a new digital broadcast centre located at Queen&#x27;s Gardens in Hull, where it was joined by a full TV operation, supporting &quot;BBC Look North&quot;.

==Awards==
In May 2012, presenters Beryl Renwick and Betty Smith were awarded the &quot;Sony Radio Academy&quot; Award for best entertainment programme. Renwick and Smith had presented alongside David Reeves from 2006 to December 2012, after they had been &quot;talent spotted during a tour of the BBC studios in Hull&quot;. The pair, aged 86 and 90 respectively, had been the oldest winners of the award. Smith died in November 2014 and Renwick died in September 2015.

In May 2013, the station was named &quot;Station of The Year&quot; at the Sony Radio Academy Awards.

==Studio facilities==

BBC Radio Humberside has studios at Queen&#x27;s Court, Queen&#x27;s Gardens in Hull. The station also has a second studio, in the Grimsby Institute for Higher Education.

In 2016, BBC Radio Humberside&#x27;s studios were refurbished as part of the ViLoR programme.

==Technical==

BBC Radio Humberside broadcasts to East Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire on 95.9 FM (High Hunsley), DAB, Freeview TV channel 713, and online via BBC Sounds.

The FM transmitter, between Beverley and South Cave 500 ft up on the Yorkshire Wolds is quite powerful over the relatively flat surrounding area, also being heard clearly in most of South Yorkshire. The signal reaches right across to the highest point of the M62 motorway near junction 22 with the A672 road, the highest point of the A66, much of Lincolnshire, and as far south as Nottingham on the M1, near the Trowell service station and Newark.

The DAB signals come from the Bauer Humberside 10D multiplex from three transmitters at Cave Wold (most powerful, three miles south of High Hunsley, and a BT microwave transmitter, Buckton Barn, near Bridlington, and Bevan Flats in Grimsby. There is no FM transmitter on the south bank, but there is a DAB transmitter in Grimsby. AM broadcasts ended in January 2018.

==Jingles==
In the past, BBC Radio Humberside have used music by David Arnold for their jingles. The first package was written by Paul Hart and performed by Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. In August 2005, the station began using a custom-made package with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra, produced by S2Blue in Staffordshire. BBC Radio Humberside were responsible for its artistic commissioning and for the eventual shape and construction of the jingles. In 2010, the package was completely refreshed by S2Blue, introducing new rhythm tracks to the 2005 package and new instrumentation across the whole set.
David Reeves was the station sound producer with Katy Noone and Neil Rudd providing many of the voice-overs.

==Travel news==
BBC Radio Humberside carries travel bulletins every 30 minutes (every 15 minutes during Breakfast and Drive) from INRIX Travel Media. Regular traffic presenters include Wayne Foy, Nick Robbins and Ed Sheppard.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Hull studios from 6 am to 2 pm on Mondays to Fridays and for sports coverage.

Off-peak programming originates from around the country including the 10pm-1am late show from London or Manchester.

During the station&#x27;s downtime, BBC Radio Humberside simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio London.

<text>BBC Radio London is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving Greater London. 

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios at Broadcasting House in Langham Place, London.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 548,000 listeners and a 0.9% share as of December 2023.

==History==
===1970–1988: Radio London===
Local radio arrived in London as part of the second wave of BBC local stations, following a successful pilot project headed by Frank Gillard, who on visiting the United States, discovered local radio stations of varying formats and brought the concept to Britain.

Test transmissions for the new local radio station were carried out from Wrotham, Kent, on 95.3 MHz in FM mono, relaying BBC Radio 1 (at the time broadcast only on medium wave), with several announcements informing listeners of the new service. On 6 October 1970, Radio London was launched, three years before commercial radio for Greater London in the guise of LBC. An additional medium wave frequency was allocated on 1457 kHz (206 metres) from Brookmans Park. 95.3 soon changed to 94.9.

BBC Radio London was the local station for the capital, although, in its early days, it relied heavily on news reports from other stations in the BBC network and often shared programming with BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 2. For several months after launch, the station was not able to play commercial records as no agreement had been reached over so-called needle time, which led to London listeners becoming acquainted with broadcast library music from outside the UK (including the Canadian Talent Library) and music from film soundtracks. A phone-in programme, &quot;Sounding Brass&quot;, was first presented by Owen Spencer-Thomas in 1977. Listeners were invited to choose a Christmas carol or hymn while a Salvation Army brass band stood by in the studio to play their request live. It later moved to BBC Radio 2 and was presented by Gloria Hunniford.

As soon as Independent Local Radio stations LBC and Capital London went on air, public attention to Radio London declined.

Radio London started regular broadcasts from Harewood House, 13 Hanover Square, near Oxford Circus, later moving to 35 Marylebone High Street – the former &quot;Radio Times&quot; warehouse.

Tests for FM stereo began in 1981 with &quot;Music on the Move&quot;, a programme featuring non-stop music, before its full launch on 11th February. The FM transmitter was shortly moved to Crystal Palace. This coincided with the planned relaunch in 1981, which saw the station take on a style that was softer than BBC Radio 2 – a station predominantly playing &quot;easy listening&quot; music. The music ranged from softer contemporary pop, such as The Carpenters, to light classical music. The relaunch led to improved audience figures and a string of awards and accolades.

One of its programmes on the schedule was &quot;Black Londoners&quot;, devised by Ray Criushank, a community relations officer for the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, and presented by Alex Pascall. The programme helped to develop on-air talent from London&#x27;s Afro-Caribbean community, namely Juliet Alexander, Syd Burke and Mike Phillips and was the pioneering programme on television or radio to regularly speak to Black Londoners. The programme&#x27;s title was changed to &quot;Black London&quot; shortly before Radio London closed. It was revived for a short time in 2003, with Pascall returning as a presenter. The forerunner to the BBC Asian Network was an Asian programme, &quot;London Sounds Eastern&quot;, presented by Vernon Corea who was appointed the BBC&#x27;s Ethnic Minorities Adviser in the 1970s.

A programming relaunch in 1984 saw Radio London adopt the tagline &quot;The Heart and Soul of London&quot;, with more soul music being played during the day. Tony Blackburn from BBC Radio 1 moved up the schedule to host a morning show. Regular Soul Night Outs were held initially in Kilburn but later in other venues, such as Ilford. This was where Dave Pearce (who later went to BBC Radio 1) made his first regular appearances as a BBC DJ on a Monday night programme.

&quot;Radio London&quot; closed on 7 October 1988. The final programme, just before its 18th birthday, was presented by Mike Sparrow and Susie Barnes. Immediately after closedown at 7 pm, test transmissions began in preparation for the launch of its replacement, Greater London Radio (GLR).

===1988–2000: Greater London Radio (GLR)===

Test transmissions for the new &quot;Greater London Radio&quot; GLR began as soon as Radio London closed. Its pre-launch announcements stated in no uncertain terms that GLR was to be radically different in style. GLR was to be the first new radio station in London for 15 years.
Heading the new station were Managing Editor Matthew Bannister and Programme Organiser Trevor Dann. Bannister came from Capital London, while Dann came from Radio 1, via BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Whistle Test&quot;, and developed an album-oriented music policy. GLR was aimed at &quot;people who hate pop but love music, hate prattle&quot; (excessive on-air talk) &quot;but want to know what&#x27;s what where in the world&quot;. The station was aimed at 25 to 45-year-olds. Early promotions used the phrase &quot;rock &#x27;n&#x27; rolling news&quot;. Much of the daytime speech output covered London events and nightlife, with comedians and other artists being interviewed. The music mix was best described as Adult album alternative, though indie bands were also played.

Chris Evans took on a variety of roles on GLR, often presenting a weekend show, ending in 1993. Danny Baker presented Weekend Breakfast from 1989 to 1990 and then returned to present a Sunday morning show from 1996 to 1998. Janice Long presented the Breakfast show on the station from 1989 to 1991, and Kevin Greening started as a producer in 1989, before becoming a presenter of the Breakfast show with Jeremy Nicholas in 1991. Bob Harris also presented shows for the station from 1994 to 1998 after leaving BBC Radio 1. Early afternoon programming previewed London&#x27;s entertainment scene, interviewing comedians and other performers. Richard Cook had a Saturday night jazz show.

Specialist speech programmes in the evening were aimed at London&#x27;s communities: Asian, Afro-Caribbean, Jewish, Gay, and Irish. &quot;Black London&quot; was replaced with Margaret Jones (aka The Ranking Miss P). Later, a programme for the gay community, &quot;Lavender Lounge&quot;, was launched. It was presented by comedian Amy Lamé. Weekends featured extensive sports coverage, centring on football and London&#x27;s numerous clubs such as Arsenal, Tottenham, and West Ham United.

In 1989, GLR set up a youth-based radio training facility at Vauxhall College, SW8, which was followed by a second course based at White City, W12. This was allocated funds from the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham and the British parliament.

GLR had the ability to directly access Scotland Yard&#x27;s network of traffic cameras across London&#x27;s busiest streets. This enabled its reporters, most commonly &quot;Bob at the Yard&quot;, to give accurate traffic and travel news to its listeners. The reports were known as &quot;20/20 Travel&quot;, named because its travel reports were read out every 20 minutes during peak times. No other radio station had this access for a while, even managing to outdo Capital Radio&#x27;s traffic plane, known as the &quot;Flying Eye&quot;.

====Criticism and closure====
Three years into the new relaunch, the station was given an additional three years to prove itself to its audience by senior BBC management or close for good; this threat was also applied to its other metropolitan BBC local radio stations BBC WM in Birmingham and BBC GMR in Manchester. The threat was lifted after the BBC deemed it sufficiently patronised to remain on-air; however, criticism of the station grew from its Radio London days, causing David Mellor, then Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to remark: &quot;The BBC must think hard whether it is occupying radio frequencies without making much use of them.&quot; This claim was rejected by senior management.

In 1991, Matthew Bannister left to spearhead the BBC&#x27;s charter-renewal strategy called Extending Choice. He was replaced as Managing Editor by Trevor Dann. Kate Marsh was appointed News Editor. In 1993, GLR was forced to relinquish its 1458 kHz medium wave frequency, for a new commercial radio station, which was eventually won by Sunrise Radio. Previously it had been simulcasting with 94.9 MHz FM, with a few programmes which occasionally opted from FM. In 1993, Nigel Chapman, Head of BBC South &amp; East, drove through a policy of &quot;speech shoulders&quot;, forcing GLR to drop its music / speech mix at breakfast and drive times. Dann resigned in protest and left the BBC.

Steve Panton, formerly Managing Editor of BBC Radio Solent, took over at GLR in 1993. One of its noted DJs on-air at the time was Gary Crowley, who had a weekend show which regularly showcased new and unsigned bands. Kaleem Sheikh presented the A to Z of Indian Film and Classical music to a mainstream and specialist audience.

In 1999, following a consultation exercise on local broadcasting in the South East, the BBC decided to rebrand GLR and substantially change the programming. A campaign to &quot;Save GLR&quot; was organised and a petition was delivered to the BBC. The argument became acrimonious. In particular, those opposed to the changes argued that the BBC never organised a public meeting in London as part of the consultation exercise and, when one was organised by supporters of the station, no one involved in the consultation exercise attended. Although the campaign was unsuccessful in saving GLR and the rebranding went ahead the next year, it demonstrated the existence of a loyal audience for its format. GLR&#x27;s music format and several of its presenters returned to the BBC with the launch of the national digital station BBC Radio 6 Music in 2002.

===2000–2001: BBC London Live 94.9===
Facing even more public criticism over GLR&#x27;s position in the London radio market and its very low listening reach, the station was relaunched on 27 March 2000 as BBC London Live 94.9. Promising even more speech and less music, London Live — originally the title for GLR&#x27;s lunch-time news show (presented by Charles Carroll, now on BBC Radio 4) — was launched with new on-air personalities and new shows, including a speech-heavy breakfast show and a mid-morning phone-in and debate. Only &quot;Drivetime&quot; and the specialist shows would remain, albeit refreshed. The re-launch at the time was promoted by huge billboards and television spots on BBC &quot;Newsroom South East&quot; depicting London&#x27;s famous landmarks as radio paraphernalia (a woman seen raising Big Ben as a radio aerial, for example). It cost the BBC in excess of £20 million, an amount seen by critics as an &quot;obscene amount of money&quot; and added to calls for the licence fee to be scrapped.

Leading the relaunch was Station Director David Robey, who hired such personalities as Lisa I&#x27;Anson, Vanessa Feltz, Tom Watt, and various black presenters including Eddie Nestor and Dotun Adebayo.

===2001–2015: BBC London 94.9===

In October 2001, the name was changed to BBC London 94.9. Newly updated jingles were added with its new slogan &quot;On TV, On Radio, Online&quot;, voiced by BBC London News host Emily Maitlis. The overall branding for this was BBC LDN.

New recruits to BBC London 94.9 included Jon Gaunt from BBC Three Counties Radio, former GLR presenter Danny Baker, and Sean Rowley (hosting the &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot; show). Danny Baker hosted a breakfast show, which was co-hosted with American comedian Amy Lamé. Jon Gaunt then hosted the mid-morning phone-in show. Robert Elms was kept at lunchtime. Vanessa Feltz took over Lisa I&#x27;Anson&#x27;s afternoon slot with a phone-in. Then there was &quot;Drivetime with Eddie Nestor and Kath Melandri&quot;, with news updates, sport, travel and debates with the public. Specialist programmes for the Black community emerged at the weekends along with sports coverage and alternative music shows in the evening. BBC London also saw the return of Tony Blackburn on Saturdays, more than 20 years since he first appeared on the station. His show was as before, playing classic soul music and chat.

Although having joined at the end of the station&#x27;s time as GLR, Norman Jay&#x27;s &quot;Giant 45&quot; show attracted a large and loyal following until Jay&#x27;s eventual departure in February 2008 having been moved to a &quot;digital only slot&quot;. This was by no means the first change to specialist music programming by Robey to have attracted a negative reaction. In 2003, a campaign called &quot;Londumb Live&quot; was briefly launched as a response to the axing of a number of specialist shows including Coldcut and Ross Allen. Another presenter, Henry Bonsu, was controversially sacked for reportedly being &quot;too intellectual&quot;.

BBC London 94.9 was the first BBC local radio station to air a 24-hour live-stream online, which coincided with the 2001 re-launch. It also aired on DAB Digital Radio (from July 2000) and on Sky channel 0152 (from 2005) in the London area, but it can be accessed within the UK and Ireland by manual tuning.

Additional coverage for football was made possible through a combination of its DAB platform, on Sky channel 0152, and via a BBC Essex transmitter on 765 kHz medium wave (for West Ham commentaries).

===2015–present: BBC Radio London===
On 6 October 2015, BBC London 94.9 was re-branded as BBC Radio London.

On 23 March 2020, to prioritise resources during the Coronavirus pandemic, BBC Radio 5 Live suspended overnight programmes between 01:00 and 05:00 and carried the output of BBC Radio London. This continued until early July, when 5 Live resumed its overnight programming. In 2022, presenter Salma El-Wardany took over the Breakfast Show, after Vanessa Feltz left the station after almost twenty years.
Following the departure of Salma El-Wardany, 5 Live Broadcaster Aaron Paul launched a new breakfast show on January 6th 2025.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s London studios.

During the station&#x27;s overnight downtime, BBC Radio London simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live.

While previous incarnations of the station offered a more diverse range of programmes for London&#x27;s various ethnic, religious, social and cultural communities, specialist community programmes no longer feature on the station due to BBC local radio stations now targeting a broad, mainstream audience.

<text>Utahraptor (meaning &quot;Utah&#x27;s predator&quot;) is a genus of large dromaeosaurid (a group of feathered carnivorous theropods) dinosaur that lived during the Early Cretaceous period from around 135 to 130 million years ago in what is now the United States. The genus was described in 1993 by American paleontologist James Kirkland and colleagues with the type species Utahraptor ostrommaysi, based on fossils that had been unearthed earlier from the Cedar Mountain Formation of Utah. Later, many additional specimens were described including those from the skull and postcranium in addition to those of younger individuals.

The genus contains a single species, Utahraptor ostrommaysi. It is the largest-known member of the family Dromaeosauridae, measuring about long and typically weighing up to . As a heavily built, ground-dwelling, bipedal carnivore, its large size and variety of unique features have earned it attention in both pop culture and the scientific community. The jaws of &quot;Utahraptor&quot; were lined with small, serrated teeth that were used in conjunction with a large &quot;killing claw&quot; on its second toe to dispatch its prey. Its skull was boxy and elongated, akin to other dromaeosaurids like &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; and &quot;Velociraptor&quot;.

Being a carnivore, &quot;Utahraptor&quot; was adapted to hunt the other animals of the Cedar Mountain Formation ecosystem such as ankylosaurs and iguanodonts. Evidence from the leg physiology supports the idea of &quot;Utahraptor&quot; being an ambush predator, in contrast to other dromaeosaurs that were pursuit predators. Fossil remains of several individuals of various ages have been found together, suggesting that &quot;Utahraptor&quot; was gregarious (social) and practiced degrees of post nestling care.

==Discovery and naming==

The first specimens of &quot;Utahraptor&quot; were found in 1975 by Jim Jensen in the Dalton Wells Quarry of Utah, near the town of Moab, but did not receive much attention. After a find of a large claw by Carl Limone in October 1991, James Kirkland, Robert Gaston and Donald Burge uncovered further remains of &quot;Utahraptor&quot; in 1991 in the Gaston Quarry in Grand County, Utah, within the Yellow Cat and Poison Strip members of the Cedar Mountain Formation. The holotype of &quot;Utahraptor&quot;, CEUM 184v.86, consists of a second pedal ungual, with potentially assigned elements from other specimens: pedal ungual CEUM 184v.294, tibia CEUM 184v.260 and premaxilla CEUM 184v.400. The holotype is housed in the paleontology collections of the Prehistoric Museum at Utah State University Eastern. Brigham Young University, the depository of Jensen&#x27;s finds, currently houses the largest collection of &quot;Utahraptor&quot; fossils.

The type species, &quot;Utahraptor ostrommaysi&quot;, was named by Kirkland, Gaston and Burge in June 1993. The genus name &quot;Utahraptor&quot; is in reference to Utah, where the remains were found. The specific name, &quot;ostrommaysi&quot;, is in honor to John Ostrom for his investigations on &quot;Deinonychus&quot; and its relationships to birds, as well as Chris Mays, who helped in the research of &quot;Utahraptor&quot; by founding Dinamation. From his description, Kirkland stated the meaning of genus name to be &quot;Utah&#x27;s predator,&quot; but the Latin word &quot;raptor&quot; translates to &#x27;robber&#x27; or &#x27;plunderer&#x27;, not &#x27;predator&#x27;. Earlier, it had been intended to name the species &quot;U. spielbergi&quot; after film director Steven Spielberg, in exchange for him funding paleontological research, but no agreement could be reached on the amount of financial assistance.

In 2000, the specific name was emended by George Olshevsky to the plural genitive &quot;ostrommaysorum&quot;. However, Thiago Vernaschi V. Costa and Normand David in 2019 criticized the use of the species name &quot;U. ostrommaysorum&quot;, since it has no clear justification or explanation. Although this spelling has been largely used by other authors, the genus &quot;Utahraptor&quot; was originally coined with the type species &quot;U. ostrommaysi&quot; and, given that the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature offers no provision for forming a genitive form from two persons with different names, Costa and David conclude that the original spelling &quot;ostrommaysi&quot; has to be regarded as an arbitrary combination of letters and not a correctly formed genitive form. Under this reasoning, &quot;ostrommaysorum&quot; has no valid use and the original spelling &quot;ostrommaysi&quot; does not need to be emended. Other alternative and also invalid spellings were used in scientific literature, such as &quot;ostromaysi&quot;, &quot;ostromaysorum&quot;, &quot;ostromayssorum&quot;, &quot;ostromayorum&quot; and &quot;ostrommaysori&quot;.

Some elements were wrongly referred to the genus. The lacrimal bone of the specimen CEUM 184v.83 turned out to be a postorbital from the ankylosaur &quot;Gastonia&quot;. Britt &quot;et al.&quot; also suggested that the previously identified manual unguals of the specimens M184v.294, BYU 9438 and BYU 13068 are indeed pedal unguals. This suggestion was confirmed by Senter in 2007.

==Description==

&quot;Utahraptor&quot; was one of, if not the largest and heaviest of all dromaeosaurids, with the largest assigned specimen BYUVP 15465 having a femoral length of .

&quot;Utahraptor&quot; is estimated to have reached in length and somewhat less than , comparable in weight to a polar bear. Some authors estimated that it weighed up to . In 2024, the body mass of BYUVP 2536 and BYUVP 1833 were estimated around respectively, though BYUVP 7510-18078 was estimated to have weighed .

Although feathers have never been found in association with &quot;Utahraptor&quot; specimens, there is strong phylogenetic evidence suggesting that all dromaeosaurids had them. The feathered genus &quot;Microraptor&quot; is one of the oldest-known dromaeosaurids and is phylo­genetically more primitive than &quot;Utahraptor&quot;. Since &quot;Microraptor&quot; and other dromaeosaurids possessed feathers, it is reasonable to assume that this trait was present in all of Dromaeosauridae. Feathers were very unlikely to have evolved more than once, so assuming that any given dromaeosaurid, such as &quot;Utahraptor&quot;, lacked feathers would require positive evidence that they did not have them. So far, there is nothing to suggest that feathers were lost in larger, more derived species of dromaeosaurs. The presence of quill knobs in &quot;Dakotaraptor&quot; evidenced that even larger dromaeosaurids had feathers.

According to Kirkland &quot;et al.&quot; in 1993, &quot;Utahraptor&quot; can be recognized by a few special autapomorphies. The claws on its hand are more specialized as cutting blades than in other dromaeosaurids. It has a lacrimal bone with distinctly parallel mesial and outer sides that gives it an elongate subrectangular appearance in top view and it has a base of the nasal opening on the premaxilla parallel to the premaxillary tooth row. In the revised diagnosis conducted by Turner &quot;et al.&quot; in 2012, &quot;Utahraptor&quot; differs from other dromaeosaurids in having an elongate nasal process of the premaxilla, a distal end of metatarsal III that is smooth, not ginglymoid, an L-shaped quadratojugal without a posterior process, the presence of a well-developed notch between the lesser trochanter and greater trochanter, and dorsal vertebrae that lack pleurocoels. Like other dromaeosaurids, &quot;Utahraptor&quot; had a large curved claw on the second toe of each foot. The second pedal ungual is preserved with a outside curve length and is estimated to reach in restoration.

==Classification==
&quot;Utahraptor&quot; is a member of the family Dromaeosauridae, a clade of theropod dinosaurs commonly known as &quot;raptors&quot;. &quot;Utahraptor&quot; is the largest known genus in the family and belongs to the same clade of other notable dinosaurs such as &quot;Velociraptor&quot;, &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, or &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot;. It is classified in the subfamily Dromaeosaurinae, which is found in the clade Eudromaeosauria.

In 2015, &quot;Utahraptor&quot; was found to be closely related to the smaller &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; and the giant Mongolian and North American dromaeosaurid genera &quot;Achillobator&quot; and &quot;Dakotaraptor&quot;:

The cladogram below is the result of a cladistic analysis conducted by Cau &quot;et al.&quot; in 2017.

==Paleobiology==
===Predatory behavior===
Kirkland &quot;et al.&quot; noted that given the huge size of &quot;Utahraptor&quot;, it was not as fast as &quot;Deinonychus&quot; and &quot;Velociraptor;&quot; instead, it would have had a similar speed to the contemporary iguanodonts, and was faster than sauropods. Additionally, the thickness of the tibia indicates that the animal possessed a significant leg force in order to kill prey. It was also suggested that lighter dromaeosaurids such as &quot;Velociraptor&quot; and &quot;Deinonychus&quot; relied on their hand claws to handle prey and retain balance while kicking it; in contrast to this, the heavily built &quot;Utahraptor&quot; may have been able to deliver kicks without the risk of losing balance, freeing the hands and using them to dispatch prey.

According to Gregory S. Paul, &quot;Utahraptor&quot; was not particularly fast and would have been an ambush hunter that preyed on large dinosaurs such as the contemporary iguanodonts and therizinosaurs. Its robust build and large sickle claw indicate it was well suited to hunting such prey. Like other dromaeosaurine dromaeosaurids, it may have also relied heavily on its jaws to dispatch prey—more so than other types of dromaeosaurids, such as velociraptorines.

===Social behavior===
In 2001, Kirkland &quot;et al.&quot; pursued a graduate student&#x27;s discovery of a bone protruding from a 9-ton fossil block of sandstone in eastern Utah. It was determined to contain the bones of at least seven individuals, including an adult measuring about , four juveniles, and a hatchling about long. Also fossilized with the &quot;Utahraptor&quot; pack are the remains of at least one possible iguanodont. Kirkland speculated that the &quot;Utahraptor&quot; pack attempted to scavenge carrion or attack helpless prey mired in quicksand, and were themselves mired in the attempt to feed on the herbivore. Similar sites such as the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry and California&#x27;s La Brea Tar Pits house such predator traps. Examination of the fossils are ongoing after a decade of excavation, but if Kirkland is correct, it may be one of the best-preserved predator traps ever discovered. The fossils may further reveal aspects into the behavior of &quot;Utahraptor&quot;, such as whether it might have hunted in groups like &quot;Deinonychus&quot; was believed to have done. Whether all the &quot;Utahraptor&quot; individuals were mired simultaneously or were drawn in, one-by-one is unclear. Further examination of the block suggests that the number of &quot;Utahraptor&quot; remains may be double the amount previously assumed.

While dinosaur behavior can only be theorized, it was later discovered in 2020 that &quot;Deinonychus&quot; may not have practiced mammal-like pack hunting, based on differing dietary preferences in adults and juveniles. Despite this, the authors stated that gregariousness was still possible for &quot;Deinonychus&quot; and the discovery of &quot;Utahraptor&quot; in the mud-trap implies it exhibited a degree of post nestling care and gregariousness.

==Paleoenvironment==
&quot;Utahraptor&quot; lived in the lower part of the Cedar Mountain Formation, a bed known as the Yellow Cat Member. According to the authors of its description, &quot;Utahraptor&quot; had an important ecological role as a major carnivore of the paleofauna of the present-day Arches region during the Early Cretaceous, and could probably attack prey larger than itself. Group hunting of individuals of at least and , if proven, could have killed prey of a weight of . Additionally, sauropods ranging around may have been an important part of its diet. The paleontologist Thomas R. Holtz estimated that &quot;Utahraptor&quot; existed between 130 million and 125 million years ago. In multiple occasions, the Yellow Cat Member has been dated to Barremian-Aptian ages. Sames and Schudack (2010) proposed a reassignment of the estimated age, compromising Berriasian to Valanginian stages; however, this interpretation was not followed by most authors. Using advanced methods of radiometric and palynological dating, Joeckel et al. (2019) concluded that the Yellow Cat Member is indeed older than previous estimations. The deposition occurred between 139 ± 1.3 million to 134.6 ± 1.7 million years ago, or, Berriasian to Late Valanginian stages. Based on the presence of new palynoflora, Middle Berriasian–Early Hauterivian ages were provisionally assigned. However, the Yellow Cat Member is divided into distinct &quot;lower&quot; and &quot;upper&quot; layers, and &quot;Utahraptor&quot; fossils are only currently known within the upper Yellow Cat Member.
&quot;Utahraptor&quot; was unearthed from the Yellow Cat Member, which during the Berriasian to Late Valanginian was a semiarid area with floodplain prairies, riverine forests, and open woodlands predominated by conifers (Pinophyta), ferns (Polypodiopsida), hornworts (Anthocerotophyta) and other vascular plants. During the description of &quot;Mierasaurus&quot;, it was interpreted that there was also a waterlogged bog-like environment. There is believed to have been a short wet season. This is supported by the presence of charred spores and other carbonized plant debris in the pollen maceral that indicate the occurrence of ancient wildfires ignited during periods of low precipitation.

Paleofauna that were contemporaneous with the dromaeosaurid in the upper Yellow Cat Member included numerous dinosaurs, such as the medium-sized iguanodonts &quot;Hippodraco&quot; and &quot;Cedrorestes&quot;, the smaller theropods &quot;Martharaptor&quot; and &quot;Nedcolbertia&quot;, the nodosaurid &quot;Gastonia&quot;, and the sauropods &quot;Cedarosaurus&quot; and &quot;Moabosaurus&quot;. The only known mammal from the Upper Yellow Cat Member is &quot;Cifelliodon&quot;.

Other non-dinosaur or avian taxa known from the Member include the fish &quot;Ceratodus&quot; and &quot;Semionotus&quot;, the turtles &quot;Glyptops&quot; and &quot;Trinitichelys&quot;, Aquatilavipes (fossilized bird tracks), the rhynchocephalian &quot;Toxolophosaurus&quot;, and the indeterminate remains of hybodontid and polyacrodontid sharks.

Additional paleofauna was recovered, most of it being unnamed and/or indeterminate, including an isolated mesoeucrocodylian skull that measures in length. A neochoristodere unearthed from the Upper Yellow Cat Member, represented by a partial left femur, shows that aquatic paleofauna was present and diverse during the Early Cretaceous of the Cedar Mountain Formation. A large sail-backed iguanodont represented by large vertebrae and fragmentary remains, and an indeterminate eudromaeosaur known from a caudal vertebra and fragmented tail (UMNH VP 20209) were also present.

==Cultural significance==
&quot;Raptor Red&quot; was published in 1995, and features the fictionalized story of a female &quot;Utahraptor&quot;. Written by paleontologist Robert T. Bakker, it was positively regarded by mainstream reviewers, though updates to the science have rendered some of the story line facts presented untrue and the paleontology community was critical of fossil record inaccuracies. Bakker&#x27;s anthropomorphosis of the titular Red was particularly praised.

In 2018, it was proposed by a 10-year-old elementary school student, Kenyon Roberts, that &quot;Utahraptor&quot; be the Utah state dinosaur, an act that was approved by the Senate. Initially &quot;Utahraptor&quot; would have replaced another dinosaur, &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, as the state&#x27;s official fossil, but it was decided that &quot;Utahraptor&quot; would be another symbol of the state. In 2021, Steve Eliason successfully created a proposal for Utahraptor State Park where the block was discovered, proposed by the same Utah student, Kenyon Roberts. It was approved by the state House.

<text>Captains Regent (; ) are the two heads of state of the Republic of San Marino. They are elected every six months by the Grand and General Council, the country&#x27;s legislative body. Normally the Regents are chosen from parties in coalition and serve a six-month term. The investiture of the Captains Regent takes place on 1 April and 1 October every year. This tradition dates back at least to 1243.

The practice of dual heads of government (diarchy) is derived directly from the customs of the Roman Republic, equivalent to the consuls of ancient Rome, except the Captains Regent hold no executive power.

== History ==

The establishment of the regency took place during the first half of the thirteenth century, when they had the role of managing justice, a task similar to the competence of magistrates. During that period they were called consuls, which derived from ancient Rome. The first two known consuls were elected on 12 December 1243 by the Grand and General Council with a six-month term which is still used today.

At the end of the thirteenth century, the name of the institution started to change, as one took the title of &quot;captain&quot; and the other one of &quot;defender&quot;, then in 1317 they became captain and rector. One usually belonged to the upper class, to guarantee the possession of skills necessary to govern the Republic with competence, and one to the working class.

A 1972 law abolished all the restrictions which prevented women from taking public positions. Maria Lea Pedini-Angelini, was elected the first female Captain Regent on 1 April 1981. On 1 April 2017, for the first time two women, Vanessa D&#x27;Ambrosio and Mimma Zavoli, occupied the posts of Captains Regent, until their term ended on 1 October 2017.
As of 1 April 2020, after electing its eighteenth female Captain Regent, San Marino is the country that has had the most female heads of state in the world (however, many other countries have had a female head of state for longer than the combined 10.5 years of these 18 Captains Regent).

== Election ==

Captains Regent are elected every six months by the Grand and General Council, they usually belong to opposite parties to grant an amount of balance and an equal supervision. The electoral procedure is disciplined by a 1945 law, which is mainly based on the Leges Statutae Republicae Sancti Marini of 1600.

The pair is elected if it achieves an absolute majority; there is a second ballot if no pair gets enough votes.

=== Eligibility ===
To be eligible for election the candidate should have the following requirements:
* Citizenship from birth (&quot;jus sanguinis&quot;)
* Be at least 25 years old
* Be an elected deputy of the Grand and General Council
* Not have been elected Captain Regent in the last three years

=== Investiture ===
Investiture ceremonies take place on 1 April and 1 October every year, and are prescribed by Leges Statutae Republicae Sancti Marini. In the morning, in the Piazza della Libertà, the Sammarinese Armed Forces are assembled for the flag-raising ceremony taking place. As the flag is hoisted to the national anthem, the artillery unit fires a gun salute. The newly elected Captains Regent proceed from the Palazzo Pubblico to the Basilica of San Marino where a High Mass is led by the Bishop of San Marino in celebration of their assumption of office. The &quot;entourage&quot; returns to the palazzo, where the official address is made and the elected Captains Regent are sworn in according to the oath describes in the Statutes of 1600. The outgoing Captains Regent place the collar of the Order of San Marino on the new Captains Regent, finalizing the transfer of power. The swearing in ends as the band plays the national anthem and the outgoing Captains Regent afterward take their leave. The procession then heads to Palazzo Valloni for the assumption of the Captain&#x27;s Throne and the residency.

Finally, the Armed Forces assemble once more for a flag lowering ceremony.

== Power ==
The Regency is considered the supreme office of the Republic. The Captains Regent are the head of state, a function which they carry out as a single body, with a reciprocal right of veto. They have the right to be addressed with the honorific title of Excellency.

The Captains Regent are impartial and their power is mainly symbolic, as their main duty is to represent the country and to guarantee the constitutional order. They supervise the Grand and General Council, the Congress of State and the Council of XII, but without any right to vote or to decide. They dissolve the parliament when the legislature is over or when it is unable to form a stable government. The Captains Regent also have the power to promulgate and order the publication of the laws approved by the Grand and General Council.

== Regency Syndicate ==
The Captains Regent cannot be prosecuted in any way during their mandate, at the end of which they are subject to the Regency Syndicate. This judgement, established by the Statutes of 1499, is now fulfilled by the Guarantors&#x27; Panel on the Constitutionality of Rules, following the revision of the Declaration on the Citizens&#x27; Rights. The procedure provides that, within fifteen days after the conclusion of their mandate, every citizen registered in the electoral lists may submit claims against the Captains Regent &quot;for what they have and have not done&quot; during their mandate.

<doc id="569689" wikidata="Q4164502" url="?curid=569689" title="Brominated vegetable oil">
<text>Brominated vegetable oil (BVO) is a complex mixture of plant-derived triglycerides that have been modified by atoms of the element bromine bonded to the fat molecules. Brominated vegetable oil has been used to help emulsify citrus-flavored beverages, especially soft drinks, preventing them from separating during distribution. Brominated vegetable oil has been used by the soft drink industry since 1931, generally at a level of about 8 ppm. Several countries have banned use of BVO in food and drink products because of the potential for adverse health effects in humans.

== Use ==
Careful control of the type of oil used allows bromination of it to produce BVO with a specific density of 1.33 g/mL, which is 33% greater than water (1 g/mL). As a result, it can be mixed with less-dense flavoring agents such as citrus oil to produce an oil which matches the density of water or other products. The droplets containing BVO remain suspended in the water rather than separating and floating to the surface.

Alternative food additives used for the same purpose include sucrose acetate isobutyrate (SAIB, E444) and glycerol ester of wood rosin (ester gum, E445). 

Similar iodinated oils have been used as contrast agents and for goiter prophylaxis in populations with low dietary iodine intake. 

Brominated vegetable oil has the CAS number 8016-94-2 and the EC number 232-416-5.

== Regulation ==

=== United States ===

In the United States, BVO was designated in 1958 as generally recognized as safe (GRAS), but this was withdrawn by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1970. The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations imposed restrictions on the use of BVO as a food additive in the United States, limiting the concentration to 15 ppm, the amount of free fatty acids to 2.5 percent, and the iodine value to 16.

BVO was one of four substances that the FDA has defined as &quot;interim&quot; food additives; the other three were acrylonitrile copolymers, mannitol, and saccharin.

An online petition at Change.org asking PepsiCo to stop adding BVO to Gatorade and other products collected over 200,000 signatures by January 2013. The petition pointed out that since Gatorade is sold in countries where BVO is not approved, there was already an existing formulation without this ingredient. PepsiCo announced in January 2013 that it would no longer use BVO in Gatorade. On May 5, 2014, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo said they would remove BVO from their products. As of early 2020, both companies have stopped using BVO in all their products.

In October 2023, California Governor Gavin Newsom approved a law that would ban the manufacture, sale, and distribution of brominated vegetable oil, along with three other additives (potassium bromate, propylparaben, and Red 3), becoming the first state to ban food additives that were otherwise approved by the FDA.

In July 2024, the FDA revoked regulations allowing the use of BVO in food, following a proposal made in November 2023. The agency concluded that the intended use of BVO in food is no longer considered safe after the results of studies conducted in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found the potential for adverse health effects in humans, including headaches and nervous system damage. The final rule banning BVO took effect August 2, 2024, and beverage companies have one year to reformulate their products to comply with the final rule.

=== Other countries ===
Canada has banned the use of brominated vegetable oil since August 30, 2024. The decision follows a proposal made in May 2024 citing mounting health concerns. This additive was previously permitted in drinks with a limit of 15 ppm in beverages with citrus or spruce oils. Beverage companies have one year from that date to reformulate and relabel any affected products.

In the European Union, BVO has been banned from use since 2008 (it was originally banned in the UK and several other European countries in 1970). Any BVO-containing products that may slip through the regulations are pulled from shelves upon discovery. In the EU, beverage companies commonly use glycerol ester of wood rosin or locust bean gum as an alternative to BVO.

In India, standards for soft drinks have prohibited the use of BVO since 1990.

In Japan, the use of BVO as a food additive has been banned since 2010.

== Health effects ==
There are case reports of adverse effects associated with excessive consumption of BVO-containing products. One case reported that a man who consumed two to four liters of a soda containing BVO on a daily basis experienced memory loss, tremors, fatigue, loss of muscle coordination, headache, and ptosis of the right eyelid, as well as elevated serum chloride. In the two months it took to correctly diagnose the problem, the patient also lost the ability to walk. Eventually, bromism was diagnosed and hemodialysis was prescribed which resulted in a reversal of the disorder.

<text>Cellular immunity, also known as cell-mediated immunity, is an immune response that does not rely on the production of antibodies. Rather, cell-mediated immunity is the activation of phagocytes, antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, and the release of various cytokines in response to an antigen.

==History==

In the late 19th century Hippocratic tradition medicine system, the immune system was imagined into two branches: humoral immunity, for which the protective function of immunization could be found in the humor (cell-free bodily fluid or serum) and cellular immunity, for which the protective function of immunization was associated with cells. CD4 cells or helper T cells provide protection against different pathogens. Naive T cells, which are immature T cells that have yet to encounter an antigen, are converted into activated effector T cells after encountering antigen-presenting cells (APCs). These APCs, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells in some circumstances, load antigenic peptides onto the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of the cell, in turn presenting the peptide to receptors on T cells. The most important of these APCs are highly specialized dendritic cells; conceivably operating solely to ingest and present antigens. Activated effector T cells can be placed into three functioning classes, detecting peptide antigens originating from various types of pathogen: The first class being 1) Cytotoxic T cells, which kill infected target cells by apoptosis without using cytokines, 2) Th1 cells, which primarily function to activate macrophages, and 3) Th2 cells, which primarily function to stimulate B cells into producing antibodies.

In another ideology, the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system each comprise both humoral and cell-mediated components. Some cell-mediated components of the innate immune system include myeloid phagocytes, innate lymphoid cells (NK cells) and intraepithelial lymphocytes.

==Synopsis==
Cellular immunity protects the body through:
* T-cell mediated immunity or T-cell immunity: activating antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells that are able to induce apoptosis in body cells displaying epitopes of foreign antigen on their surface, such as virus-infected cells, cells with intracellular bacteria, and cancer cells displaying tumor antigens;
* Macrophage and natural killer cell action: enabling the destruction of pathogens via recognition and secretion of cytotoxic granules (for natural killer cells) and phagocytosis (for macrophages); and
* Stimulating cells to secrete a variety of cytokines that influence the function of other cells involved in adaptive immune responses and innate immune responses.

Cell-mediated immunity is directed primarily at microbes that survive in phagocytes and microbes that infect non-phagocytic cells. It is most effective in removing virus-infected cells, but also participates in defending against fungi, protozoans, cancers, and intracellular bacteria. It also plays a major role in transplant rejection.

Type 1 immunity is directed primarily at viruses, bacteria, and protozoa and is responsible for activating macrophages, turning them into potent effector cells. This is achieved by the secretion of interferon gamma and TNF.

==Overview==

CD4+ T-helper cells may be differentiated into two main categories:
# TH1 cells which produce interferon gamma and lymphotoxin alpha,
# TH2 cells which produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13.

A third category called T helper 17 cells (TH17) were also discovered which are named after their secretion of Interleukin 17.

CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells may also be categorized as:
# Tc1 cells,
# Tc2 cells.

Similarly to CD4+ TH cells, a third category called TC17 were discovered that also secrete IL-17.

As for the ILCs, they&quot;[Clarification needed.]&quot; may be classified into three main categories
# ILC1 which secrete type 1 cytokines,
# ILC2 which secrete type 2 cytokines,
# ILC3 which secrete type 17 cytokines.

==Development of cells==
All type 1 cells begin their development from the common lymphoid progenitor (CLp) which then differentiates to become the common innate lymphoid progenitor (CILp) and the t-cell progenitor (Tp) through the process of lymphopoiesis.

Common innate lymphoid progenitors may then be differentiated into a natural killer progenitor (NKp) or a common helper like innate lymphoid progenitor (CHILp). NKp cells may then be induced to differentiate into natural killer cells by IL-15. CHILp cells may be induced to differentiate into ILC1 cells by IL-15, into ILC2 cells by IL-7 or ILC3 cells by IL-7 as well.

T-cell progenitors may differentiate into naïve CD8+ cells or naïve CD4+ cells. Naïve CD8+ cells may then further differentiate into TC1 cells upon IL-12 exposure, [IL-4] can induce the differentiation into TC2 cells and IL-1 or IL-23 can induce the differentiation into TC17 cells. Naïve CD4+ cells may differentiate into TH1 cells upon IL-12 exposure, TH2 upon IL-4 exposure or TH17 upon IL-1 or IL-23 exposure.

==Type 1 immunity==
Type 1 immunity makes use of the type 1 subset for each of these cell types. By secreting interferon gamma and TNF, TH1, TC1, and group 1 ILCS activate macrophages, converting them to potent effector cells. It provides defense against intracellular bacteria, protozoa, and viruses. It is also responsible for inflammation and autoimmunity with diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease all being implicated in type 1 immunity. Type 1 immunity consists of these cells:
* CD4+ TH1 cells
* CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (Tc1)
* T-Bet+ interferon gamma producing group 1 ILCs(ILC1 and Natural killer cells)

CD4+ TH1 Cells

It has been found in both mice and humans that the signature cytokines for these cells are interferon gamma and lymphotoxin alpha. The main cytokine for differentiation into TH1 cells is IL-12 which is produced by dendritic cells in response to the activation of pattern recognition receptors. T-bet is a distinctive transcription factor of TH1 cells. TH1 cells are also characterized by the expression of chemokine receptors which allow their movement to sites of inflammation. The main chemokine receptors on these cells are CXCR3A and CCR5. Epithelial cells and keratinocytes are able to recruit TH1 cells to sites of infection by releasing the chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 in response to interferon gamma. Additionally, interferon gamma secreted by these cells seems to be important in downregulating tight junctions in the epithelial barrier.

CD8+ TC1 Cells

These cells generally produce interferon gamma. Interferon gamma and IL-12 promote differentiation toward TC1 cells. T-bet activation is required for both interferon gamma and cytolytic potential. CCR5 and CXCR3 are the main chemokine receptors for this cell.

Group 1 ILCs

Groups 1 ILCs are defined to include ILCs expressing the transcription factor T-bet and were originally thought to only include natural killer cells. Recently, there have been a large amount of NKp46+ cells that express certain master [transcription factor]s that allow them to be designated as a distinct lineage of natural killer cells termed ILC1s. ILC1s are characterized by the ability to produce interferon gamma, TNF, GM-CSF and IL-2 in response to cytokine stimulation but have low or no cytotoxic ability.

<text>Josiah Strong (April 14, 1847 – June 26, 1916) was an American Protestant clergyman, organizer, editor, and author. He was a leader of the Social Gospel movement, calling for social justice and combating social evils. He supported missionary work so that all races could be improved and uplifted and thereby brought to Christ. He is controversial, however, due to his beliefs about race and methods of converting people to Christianity. In his 1885 book &quot;Our Country&quot;, Strong argued that Anglo-Saxons are a superior race who must &quot;Christianize and civilize&quot; the &quot;savage&quot; races, which he argued would be good for the American economy and the &quot;lesser races&quot;.

==Ministry==
Josiah Strong was one of the founders of the Social Gospel movement that sought to apply Protestant religious principles to solve the social ills brought on by industrialization, urbanization and immigration. He served as General Secretary (1886–1898) of the Evangelical Alliance for the United States, a coalition of Protestant missionary groups. After being forced out he set up his own group, the League for Social Service (1898–1916), and edited its magazine &quot;The Gospel of the Kingdom&quot;. The League was later expanded to become the &quot;American Institute of Social Service&quot;, based on the concept of the Musée social.

Strong, like most other leaders of the Social Gospel movement, added strong evangelical roots, including a belief in sin and redemption. Strong, like Walter Rauschenbusch and George D. Herron had an intense conversion experience and believed that regeneration was necessary to bring social justice by combating social sin. Though they were often critical of evangelicalism, they thought of their mission as an expansion of it. Their primitivist desire for noninstitutional Christianity was influenced by liberal, postmillennial idealism, and their attitudes influenced neo-orthodox theologian Reinhold Niebuhr.

His best-known and most influential work was &quot;Our Country: Its Possible Future and Its Present Crisis&quot; (1885), intended to promote domestic missionary activity in the American West. When the work appeared, Protestants had long been accustomed to meeting the sorts of perils that Strong saw threatening the country&#x27;s survival, Christianization, and world greatness. His work flowed from a tradition habituated to perceive threats to &quot;our country&quot;. It was a tradition that helped ensure the end of slavery in defense of the Union during the Civil War, while also predisposing many northern Protestants to look past, if not entirely forget, the ex-slaves following the war. Historians also suggest it may have encouraged support for imperialistic United States policy among American Protestants. He pleaded as well for more missionary work in the nation&#x27;s cities, and for reconciliation to end racial conflict. He was one of the first to warn that Protestants (most of whom lived in rural areas or small towns) were ignoring the problems of the cities and the working classes

Strong believed that all races could be improved and uplifted and thereby brought to Christ. In the &quot;Possible Future&quot; portion of &quot;Our Country&quot;, Strong focused on the &quot;Anglo-Saxon race&quot;—that is the English language speakers. He said in 1890: &quot;In 1700 this race numbered less than 6,000,000 souls. In 1800, Anglo-Saxons (I use the term somewhat broadly to include all English-speaking peoples) had increased to about 20,500,000, and now, in 1890, they number more than 120,000,000.&quot;) had a responsibility to &quot;civilize and Christianize&quot; the world, sharing their technology and knowledge of Christianity. The &quot;Crisis&quot; portion of the text described the seven &quot;perils&quot; facing the nation: Catholicism, Mormonism, Socialism, Intemperance, Wealth, Urbanization, and Immigration. Conservative Protestants, by contrast, argued that missionaries should spend their time preaching the Gospel; they allowed for charitable activity, but argued that it did not actually save souls.

In 1891 a revised edition was issued based on the census of 1890. The large increase in immigration during this period led him to conclude that the perils he outlined in the first edition had only grown.

The term &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; before 1900 was often used as a synonym for people of English descent throughout the world. Strong said in 1890: &quot;In 1700 this race numbered less than 6,000,000 souls. In 1800, Anglo-Saxons (I use the term somewhat broadly to include all English-speaking peoples) had increased to about 20,500,000, and now, in 1890, they number more than 120,000,000&quot;. In 1893 Strong suggested, &quot;This race is destined to dispossess many weaker ones, assimilated others, and mold of the remainder until ... it has Anglo-Saxonized mankind.&quot;

Strong argued that, &quot;The Anglo-Saxon is the representative of two great ideas, which are closely related. One of them is that of civil liberty. Nearly all of the civil liberty of the world is enjoyed by Anglo-Saxons: the English, the British colonists, and the people of the United States. ... The other great idea of which the Anglo-Saxon is the exponent is that of a pure spiritual Christianity.&quot; He went on, &quot;It follows, then, that the Anglo-Saxon, as the great representative of these two ideas, the depositary of these two greatest blessings, sustains peculiar relations to the world&#x27;s future, is divinely commissioned to be, in a peculiar sense, his brother&#x27;s keeper.&quot;

<text>Harry Segall (April 10, 1892 – November 25, 1975) was an American playwright, screenwriter and television writer.

Segall was born in Chicago.

Harry Segall&#x27;s writing career spans 1933 to 1959. Segall&#x27;s plays, including &quot;Lost Horizons&quot;, appeared on Broadway in the mid-1930s. In 1933, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer brought Segall to Hollywood as a contract writer. In 1936, he moved to RKO Pictures where he wrote and co-wrote screenplays for films such as &quot;The Outcasts of Poker Flat&quot;, based on a story by Bret Harte and &quot;Blind Alibi,&quot; starring Richard Dix. During this time, Paramount Pictures and Universal Studios also produced his screenplays.

In 1941, Segall won an Academy Award for best original story for the film &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot;, starring Robert Montgomery and Evelyn Keyes, based on Segall&#x27;s play &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;. The play was later revived under the title &quot;Wonderful Journey&quot;, but the revival lasted only nine performances.

A Technicolor sequel to &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot;, &quot;Down to Earth&quot; was released in 1947 starring Rita Hayworth and Larry Parks. 

A 1978 film version of &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; starred Warren Beatty and Julie Christie, and the play was then filmed again as &quot;Down to Earth&quot;, a 2001 vehicle for Chris Rock, with Segall credited as the writer of the original story.

With the advent of television, Segall turned his writing talents to this medium, writing plots for TV series and &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;. He retired from screenwriting in 1959 and died November 25, 1975, in Woodland Hills, California. Segall was interred in Roosevelt Cemetery, in Gardena, California.

<text>Michael Hendricks and René LeBoeuf are Canadian–American gay rights advocates. At the height of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and 90s, the couple helped lead ACT-UP activists in a fight with the City of Montreal to create a permanent memorial to Quebecers who died of AIDS. After several years trying to stop the grassroots efforts to create the memorial, city officials abandoned their fight in September 1994 and the &#x27;Parc de l&#x27;Espoir&#x27; was built in the heart of Montreal&#x27;s gay village. 

The couple is also known for their advocacy of marriage equality in Canada and became the first same-sex couple to be legally married in Quebec. 

In October 2019, at the age of 80, Hendricks found himself at the centre of a new battle with the City of Montreal for the Parc de l&#x27;Espoir. Without consulting the gay community or HIV/AIDS service organizations, the city&#x27;s Ville-Marie borough sent a Notice to Residents announcing it had developed plans to demolish the AIDS memorial and rebuild it with an entirely new design. Hendricks and LeBoeuf mobilized the community to attend the borough&#x27;s Dec. 4 public meeting where officials were told repeatedly that they did not have their approval to make any changes to Parc de l&#x27;Espoir. Fearing a scathing editorial in the Montreal Gazette, the borough dropped their plans and went back to the drawing board. 

== Background ==
Hendricks, originally from New Jersey, came to Canada as a draft evader during the Vietnam War; he met LeBoeuf, a native of Quebec City, at a New Year&#x27;s party in the 1970s.

In 1996, the couple began to lead protests and parades seeking the right to marry each other.

== &quot;Hendricks and LeBoeuf v. Quebec&quot; ==

In November 2001, the couple brought suit against the government of Quebec,
asserting that its refusal to perform same-sex marriage violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The case began on November 8.

On December 7 of that year, the Quebec government announced its intention to bring in legislation to create civil unions to which same-sex couples would have access and which would afford a status equivalent to that of marriage. (The definition of marriage is a federal jurisdiction in Canada, but the provinces have authority over civil status, including the registry of marriage.) The bill was introduced on April 25, 2002, and passed on June 7.

&quot;Hendricks and LeBoeuf v. Quebec&quot; continued, and on September 6, 2002, the Quebec Superior Court ruled that the limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples violated the Charter. It declared that the laws preventing same-sex marriage would become inoperative in Quebec in two years&#x27; time, constraining the federal government to act within that time. Hendricks and LeBoeuf were represented in the original Quebec Superior Court case by family lawyers Marie-Hélène Dubé and Anne-France Goldwater.

Although the federal government announced that it would appeal the decision and other legal decisions regarding same-sex marriage, those appeals were later dropped on the recommendation of the House of Commons Justice Committee, which had held travelling hearings on same-sex marriage.

On January 26, 2004, Hendricks and LeBoeuf appealed against the decision of the court in their case, specifically the delay of two years, in view of the rulings that had implemented same-sex marriage immediately in Ontario and British Columbia during the summer of 2003. They were represented in the appeal by lawyers Colin Irving and Martha McCarthy.

On March 19, the Quebec Court of Appeal struck down the delay and ruled that same-sex marriage licences be issued immediately.

== Wedding ==

Hendricks and LeBoeuf immediately sought their licence. The usual 20-day waiting period required between the issuance of a licence and the wedding was waived, and the couple were wed at the Palais de justice de Montréal on April 1, 2004, exactly three years after the first legal same-sex marriage in the Netherlands. At the time of their wedding, they had been together for 31 years.

<doc id="569755" wikidata="Q153799" url="?curid=569755" title="Localhost">
<text>In computer networking, localhost is a hostname that refers to the current computer used to access it. The name &quot;localhost&quot; is reserved for loopback purposes.
It is used to access the network services that are running on the host via the loopback network interface. Using the loopback interface bypasses any local network interface hardware.

==Loopback==

The local loopback mechanism may be used to run a network service on a host without requiring a physical network interface, or without making the service accessible from the networks the computer may be connected to. For example, a locally installed website may be accessed from a Web browser by the URL &quot;http://localhost&quot; to display its home page.

IPv4 network standards reserve the entire address block (more than 16 million addresses) for loopback purposes. That means any packet sent to any of those addresses is looped back. The address is the standard address for IPv4 loopback traffic; the rest are not supported by all operating systems. However, they can be used to set up multiple server applications on the host, all listening on the same port number. In the IPv6 addressing architecture there is only a single address assigned for loopback: . The standard precludes the assignment of that address to any physical interface, as well as its use as the source or destination address in any packet sent to remote hosts.

==Name resolution==
The name &quot;localhost&quot; normally resolves to the IPv4 loopback address , and to the IPv6 loopback address .

This resolution is normally configured by the following lines in the operating system&#x27;s hosts file:

The name may also be resolved by Domain Name System (DNS) servers, but there are special considerations governing the use of this name:

* An IPv4 or IPv6 address query for the name localhost must always resolve to the respective loopback address.
* Applications may resolve the name to a loopback address themselves, or pass it to the local name resolver mechanisms.
* When a name resolver receives an address (A or AAAA) query for &quot;localhost&quot;, it should return the appropriate loopback addresses, and negative responses for any other requested record types. Queries for &quot;localhost&quot; should not be sent to caching name servers.
* To avoid burdening the Domain Name System root servers with traffic, caching name servers should never request name server records for &quot;localhost&quot;, or forward resolution to authoritative name servers.
* When authoritative name servers receive queries for &#x27;localhost&#x27; in spite of the provisions mentioned above, they should resolve them appropriately.
In addition to the mapping of &quot;localhost&quot; to the loopback addresses ( and ), &quot;localhost&quot; may also be mapped to other IPv4 (loopback) addresses and it is also possible to assign other, or additional, names to any loopback address. The mapping of &quot;localhost&quot; to addresses other than the designated loopback address range in the hosts file or in DNS is not guaranteed to have the desired effect, as applications may map the name internally.

In the Domain Name System, the name &quot;.localhost&quot; is reserved as a top-level domain name, originally set aside to avoid confusion with the hostname &quot;localhost&quot;. Domain name registrars are precluded from delegating domain names in the top-level &quot;.localhost&quot; domain.

==Historical notes==
In 1981, the block got a &#x27;reserved&#x27; status, as not to assign it as a general purpose class A IP network.
This block was officially assigned for loopback purposes in 1986.
Its purpose as a &quot;Special Use IPv4 Address&quot; block was confirmed in 1994, 2002, 2010, and last in 2013.

From the outset, in 1995, the single IPv6 loopback address was defined. Its purpose and definition was unchanged in 1998, 2003, and up to the current definition, in 2006.

==Packet processing==
The processing of any packet sent to a loopback address, is implemented in the link layer of the TCP/IP stack. Such packets are never passed to any network interface controller (NIC) or hardware device driver and must not appear outside of a computing system, or be routed by any router. This permits software testing and local services, even in the absence of any hardware network interfaces.

Looped-back packets are distinguished from any other packets traversing the TCP/IP stack only by the special IP address they were addressed to. Thus, the services that ultimately receive them respond according to the specified destination. For example, an HTTP service could route packets addressed to and to different Web servers, or to a single server that returns different web pages. To simplify such testing, the hosts file may be configured to provide appropriate names for each address.

Packets received on a non-loopback interface with a loopback source or destination address must be dropped. Such packets are sometimes referred to as Martian packets. As with any other bogus packets, they may be malicious and any problems they might cause can be avoided by applying bogon filtering.

==Special cases==
The releases of the MySQL database differentiate between the use of the hostname &quot;localhost&quot; and the use of the addresses and . When using &quot;localhost&quot; as the destination in a client connector interface of an application, the MySQL application programming interface connects to the database using a Unix domain socket, while a TCP connection via the loopback interface requires the direct use of the explicit address.

One notable exception to the use of the addresses is their use in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) traceroute error detection, in which their property of not being routable provides a convenient means to avoid delivery of faulty packets to end users.

<text>A link register (LR for short) is a register which holds the address to return to when a subroutine call completes. This is more efficient than the more traditional scheme of storing return addresses on a call stack, sometimes called a machine stack. The link register does not require the writes and reads of the memory containing the stack which can save a considerable percentage of execution time with repeated calls of small subroutines.

The IBM POWER architecture, and its PowerPC and Power ISA successors, have a special-purpose link register, into which subroutine call instructions put the return address.

In some other instruction sets, such as the ARM architectures, SPARC, and OpenRISC, subroutine call instructions put the return address into a specific general-purpose register, so that register is designated by the instruction set architecture as the link register. The ARMv7 architecture uses general-purpose register R14 as the link register, OpenRISC uses register r9, and SPARC uses &quot;output register 7&quot; or &quot;o7&quot;.

In some others, such as PA-RISC, RISC-V, and the IBM System/360 and its successors, including z/Architecture, the subroutine call instruction can store the return address in any general-purpose register; a particular register is usually chosen, by convention, to be used as the link register.

Some architectures have two link registers: a standard &quot;branch link register&quot; for most subroutine calls, and a special &quot;interrupt link register&quot; for interrupts. One of these is ARCv2 (ARC processors using version 2 of the ARCompact architecture), which uses general-purpose-registers r29 for the interrupt link register and r31 for the branch link register. References to &quot;the link register&quot; on such platforms will be referring to the branch link register.

Earlier ARC processors based on the ARCompact and ARCtangent architectures had three link registers: two interrupt link registers (ILINK) and one branch link register (BLINK). The two interrupt link registers were ILINK1 (for level 1 (low priority) maskable interrupts), and ILINK2 (for level 2 (mid priority) maskable interrupts). In these architectures, r29 was used as the level 1 interrupt link register, r30 as the level 2 interrupt link register, and r31 as the branch link register. ILINK1 and ILINK2 were not accessible in user mode on the ARC 700 processors.

The use of a link register, regardless of whether it is a dedicated register or a general-purpose register, allows for faster calls to leaf subroutines. When the subroutine is non-leaf, passing the return address in a register can still result in generation of more efficient code for thunks, e.g. for a subroutine whose sole purpose is to call another subroutine with arguments rearranged in some way. Other subroutines can benefit from the use of the link register because it can be saved in a batch with other callee-used registers—e.g. an ARM subroutine pushes registers 4-7 along with the link register, LR, by the single instruction
codice_1 pipelining all memory writes required.

<doc id="569778" wikidata="Q4776190" url="?curid=569778" title="Antoni Pitxot">
<text>Antoni Pitxot (; Figueres, Girona, January 5, 1934 – June 12, 2015) was a Spanish Catalan painter and a longtime friend and collaborator of Salvador Dalí.

Pitxot was born into a family with many artists in its ranks, among them, his uncle Ramon Pichot. He began studying drawing at the age of thirteen, and he exhibited regularly in Lisbon, Bilbao, Barcelona, and Madrid in his twenties and thirties, winning many prizes, including the Gold Medal painting prize in Barcelona&#x27;s La Punyalada competition in 1965.

At the beginning of the 1960s, he was a close friend of the French painter Maurice Boitel, who painted many pictures on the Pitxot family&#x27;s property in Cadaqués, a small port town on the Mediterranean Sea near the French border, that was also painted by Pablo Picasso and André Derain.

In 1966, Pitxot took up permanent residence in Cadaqués, where his family had owned a summer house since the end of the 19th century. He began to experiment with surrealism: in particular, he became focused on anthropomorphic figures composed of the stones that lined the seashores near his home. Pitxot worked in a unique way: he would build sculptures from stones, and then paint those sculptures in oil.

Much of Pixtot&#x27;s work is concerned with allegory and myth, including the figure of Mnemosyne, the mother of the nine muses who personified memory, and a series of works about The Tempest.

Pitxot&#x27;s association with Salvador Dalí began before his birth, because their families were acquainted. But Dalí became an early supporter of Antonio Pitxot&#x27;s work, and eventually asked him to co-design the Dalí Theatre and Museum (&quot;Teatre-Museu Dalí&quot;) in Figueres, Spain. There is also a permanent exhibition of Pitxot&#x27;s work on one floor of that museum.

Pitxot and Dalí were nearly inseparable in the last years of Dalí&#x27;s life: designing Dalí&#x27;s museum, teaching art and exchanging ideas about their work. Pitxot was a protector of Dalí&#x27;s legacy after his death: He was a member of the board of the Gala Salvador Dalí Foundation, and he has led, and sat on the board, of several other Dalí foundations.

He became the museum&#x27;s director after Dalí&#x27;s death.

Pitxot was a respected international Catalan artist in his own right. In the year 2000, he was appointed corresponding academician for Cadaqués of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Saint George. In the 2004, he received the Gold Medal of Merit in Fine Arts from the King of Spain as a recognition for his work. In 2014 the City hall of Figueres (Girona) grants him the &quot;Fulla de Figuera de Plata&quot; and in 2015 was nominated &quot;The Favorite Son of the Cadaqués city&quot; (Girona) . Works are held in private collections and in various museums.

His brothers grandson is the Spanish actor, singer and comedian Bruno Oro Pichot.

He died on June 12, 2015, at the age of 81.

<doc id="569780" wikidata="Q5196711" url="?curid=569780" title="Cutaneous receptor">
<text>A cutaneous receptor is a sensory receptor found in the skin that provides information about temperature, touch (including vibration and pain), spatial orientation,pressure (stretching or squeezing), and metabolic circumstances (including those induced by external chemical substances). The main four types of cutaneous receptors are tactile corpuscles, bulbous corpuscles, Pacinian corpuscles, and Merkel nerve endings, although the latter do not qualify as sensory corpuscles in the narrow sense.

==Types== 
The sensory receptors in the skin are:
*Mechanoreceptors
**Bulbous corpuscles (skin stretch)
**Bulboid corpuscles (Cold)
**Tactile corpuscles (changes in texture, slow vibrations)
**Pacinian corpuscles (deep pressure, fast vibrations)
**Merkel nerve endings (sustained touch and pressure)
**Free nerve endings
*thermoreceptor
*nociceptors
*chemoreceptors

==Modalities== 
With the above-mentioned receptor types the skin can sense the modalities touch, pressure, vibration, temperature and pain. The modalities and their receptors are partly overlapping, and are innervated by different kinds of fiber types.

==Morphology==
Cutaneous receptors are at the ends of afferent neurons. works within the capsule. Ion channels are situated near these networks.

In sensory transduction, the afferent nerves transmit through a series of synapses in the central nervous system, first in the spinal cord, the ventrobasal portion of the thalamus, and then on to the somatosensory cortex.

<doc id="569790" wikidata="Q2071819" url="?curid=569790" title="Prime Cut">
<text>Prime Cut is a 1972 American action thriller crime film produced by Joe Wizan, directed by Michael Ritchie from a screenplay written by Robert Dillon, and starring Lee Marvin as Nick Devlin, a mob enforcer from the Chicago Irish Mob sent to Kansas to collect a debt from a meatpacker boss played by Gene Hackman. The picture co-stars Sissy Spacek in her first credited on-screen role as a young orphan being sold into prostitution as well as Angel Tompkins and Eddie Egan.

The film was considered highly risqué for its time based on its violence and the hint of a homosexual relationship between two brothers. Its graphic depiction of female slavery includes a scene depicting naked young women (including Sissy Spacek and Janit Baldwin) in pens being auctioned like cattle. It is also noted for its depiction of the beef slaughtering process and for a chase scene involving a combine harvester in an open field.

== Plot ==
A slaughterhouse process follows the unloading of cattle to the making of sausages. A wristwatch and a shoe appear on a conveyor line, making it clear that a human cadaver is processed among the cattle. A woman operating the sausage machine is interrupted by &quot;Weenie&quot;, who has timed the machine using his watch. He wraps up a string of sausages, then marks the package with an address in Chicago.

Weenie is the brother of &quot;Mary Ann&quot;, the crooked operator of the slaughterhouse in Kansas City, Kansas. The particular sausages that Weenie was wrapping were made from the remains of an enforcer from the Chicago Irish Mob sent to Kansas City to collect $500,000 from Mary Ann.

After the head of the Irish Mob in Chicago receives the package, he contacts Nick Devlin, a WWII veteran and enforcer with whom he has worked previously, to go to Kansas City to collect the debt. He tells Devlin about the sausages and that another enforcer sent to Kansas City was found floating in the Missouri River.

Devlin agrees to the fee of $50,000 and asks for some additional muscle. He gets a driver and three other younger members of the Irish Mob as help, including the young O&#x27;Brien, who makes Devlin meet his mother as he leaves Chicago. It is later revealed that Devlin and Mary Ann have a shared history involving Mary Ann&#x27;s wife Clarabelle, who previously had an affair with Devlin. In Kansas City at a flophouse, Devlin finds Weenie in an upstairs room. He beats him up and tells him to inform Mary Ann that he is in town to collect the debt.

The next day, Devlin and his men drive to the prairie and find Mary Ann in a barn, where he is entertaining guests at a white slave (prostitute) auction. Devlin demands the money from Mary Ann, who tells him to come to the county fair the next day to get it and states that Chicago is &quot;an old sow, begging for cream&quot; that should be melted down.

As they are standing by a cattle pen with naked young women offered for auction, one of them, Poppy, begs Devlin for help. Devlin takes her with him &quot;on account.&quot; Back at the hotel, she tells Devlin her history of growing up at an orphanage in Missouri with her close friend, Violet, before they were brought to the slave auction.

At the county fair, in the midst of a livestock judging competition, Mary Ann gives Devlin a box that supposedly contains the money. When Devlin cracks the box open, he finds it contains only beef hearts. Devlin is able to escape with Poppy after Violet distracts Weenie, who claimed her after the auction. Mary Ann&#x27;s men chase Devlin, his men and Poppy through the fair. O&#x27;Brien is killed underneath a viewing stand for a shooting range. Devlin and Poppy run into a nearby wheat field, where they escape detection. When they try to leave the field, they are chased by a combine harvester operator until Devlin&#x27;s men arrive in their car, which they ram into the front of the combine, and shoot the operator.

With the car demolished, the group hitches a ride back into Kansas City on a truck. Devlin jumps off near the river and sends the rest of them with Poppy back into town. He enters a houseboat, the luxurious accommodation of Clarabelle, purchased for her by Mary Ann; she is there alone. He gets information on the whereabouts of Mary Ann while surmising that she was the one pushing Mary Ann to cut out Chicago. Clarabelle attempts to seduce him, but he rebuffs her. Clarabelle tells him she would be perfectly happy being a widow and joining Devlin again. He responds by setting the houseboat adrift on the river, with an angry Clarabelle aboard.

When he returns to the hotel, Devlin finds an ambulance taking one of his men away. He learns that Mary Ann&#x27;s men ambushed them and took Poppy. When he returns to Weenie&#x27;s hotel to look for him, he finds that Violet has been gang-raped, apparently as a warning of what will happen to Poppy.

Devlin and his two remaining men drive out to Mary Ann&#x27;s farm to finally take care of business. They approach the farm through a sunflower field and engage in a gun battle with Mary Ann&#x27;s men. Both of Devlin&#x27;s men are hit, and he tells them to stay behind while he advances with a submachine gun. Unable to get past Mary Ann&#x27;s men, he commandeers a truck hauling livestock and uses it to ram the gate and smash into the greenhouse on the farm, demolishing it.

Devlin kills several of Mary Ann&#x27;s men, then advances into the barn where Mary Ann and his brother are holding Poppy. He hits Mary Ann, who falls down into a pig pen. Enraged at seeing his brother shot, Weenie runs toward Devlin, who kills him; Weenie tries to stab Devlin with a sausage until he dies. As Devlin and Poppy leave the barn, they pass the mortally wounded Mary Ann, who taunts Devlin to finish him off like he would an animal. Devlin refuses and walks away, leaving Mary Ann to die on his back.

In the final scene, Devlin and Poppy go back to the Missouri orphanage and demand the release of the rest of the girls. When the matron resists, Poppy knocks her out, to the approval of Devlin. As they walk away, Devlin tells her they&#x27;re going back to Chicago, and when Poppy asks what it&#x27;s like, he replies it&#x27;s &quot;as peaceful as anyplace anywhere&quot;.
