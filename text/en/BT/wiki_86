<text>The Lancaster House Agreement is an agreement signed on 21 December 1979 in Lancaster House, following the conclusion of a constitutional conference where different parties discussed the future of Zimbabwe Rhodesia, formerly known as Rhodesia. The agreement effectively concluded the Rhodesian Bush War. It also marked the nullification of Rhodesia&#x27;s Unilateral Declaration of Independence, as British colonial authority was to be restored for a transition period, during which free elections under supervision by the British government would take place. Crucially, ZANU and ZAPU, the political wings of ZANLA and ZIPRA (who had been waging an escalating insurgency since 1964), would be permitted to stand candidates in the forthcoming elections. This was however conditional to compliance with the ceasefire and the verified absence of voter intimidation.

==Negotiations==
Following the meeting of Commonwealth heads of government held in Lusaka from 1–7 August 1979, the British government invited bishop Abel Muzorewa, the recently installed prime minister of the (unrecognized) Zimbabwe Rhodesia government, along with the leaders of the Patriotic Front (the name of the ZANU-ZAPU coalition), to participate in a constitutional conference at Lancaster House. The purpose of the conference was to discuss and reach agreement on the terms of an post-independence constitution, to agree on the holding of elections under British authority, and to enable Zimbabwe Rhodesia to proceed to lawful and internationally recognised independence, with the parties settling their differences by political means. The conference formally began on 10 September 1979.

Lord Carrington, foreign and Commonwealth secretary of the United Kingdom, chaired the conference. The conference took place from 10 September to 15 December 1979 with 47 plenary sessions. In late September 1979, president Jimmy Carter, in a letter to senator John Stennis, praised the conference for making &quot;some important first steps,&quot; but argued that &quot;many difficult negotiations lie ahead.&quot;

During the negotiations, the British delegation was headed by Antony Duff. It included over 20 other members, such as Lord Carrington, Ian Gilmour, Michael Havers, David Ormsby-Gore, Richard Luce, Michael Palliser, Derek Day. Other delegates included Robin Renwick, Nicholas Fenn of the Foreign Office, George Walden, and Charles Powell. Andrew Novak wrote that Shridath Ramphal, the head of the Commonwealth of Nations, acted as a &quot;shadow mediator&quot; for the conference, restraining Carrington from hard-line positions, and ensuring Carrington and the Patriotic Front received &quot;private concessions&quot; during the negotiations.

The Patriotic Front delegation was led by Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo. ZAPU leaders Josiah Mushore Chinamano and Joseph Msika, ZANLA general Josiah Tongogara, and ZAPU members Ernest R Kadungure and T George Silundika were also delegates. Additional delegates included Edgar Tekere,
Dzingai Mutumbuka, Josiah Tungamirai, Edson Zvobgo, Simbi Mubako, Walter Kamba, and John Nkomo.

The delegation which represented Zimbabwe Rhodesia was led by bishop Abel Muzorewa. This delegation also included Ian Smith (minister without portfolio), Ndabaningi Sithole, Kayisa Ndiweni, Rowan Cronjé, Harold Hawkins, Kayisa Ndiweni, Simpson Mutambanengwe, and Gordon Chavunduka 

In the course of its proceedings the conference reached agreement on a post-independence constitution, arrangements for the post-independence period, and a cease-fire agreement signed by all the parties. In concluding this agreement and signing its report, the parties agreed to accept the authority of the governor, abide by the independence constitution (later called the &quot;Lancaster Constitution&quot;) and ceasefire agreement, comply with the pre-independence arrangements, campaign peacefully and without intimidation, renounce the use of force for political ends, and accept the outcome of the elections and to instruct any forces under their authority to do the same. Under the constitution, 20 per cent of the seats in the country&#x27;s parliament were to be reserved for whites. This provision remained in the constitution until 1987.

In November 1979, U.S. secretary of state Cyrus Vance recommended that president Jimmy Carter not lift sanctions on Rhodesia, arguing that doing so would &quot;jeopardize the negotiations&quot; and undermine U.S. ability to urge &quot;flexibility on...external parties and...Front Line states.&quot; The next month, Stephen Solarz argued that lifting sanctions before the end of the conference could be &quot;cited as a reason for its collapse&quot;.

The Lancaster House Agreement was signed on 21 December 1979. Lord Carrington and Sir Ian Gilmour signed the agreement on behalf of the United Kingdom, Abel Muzorewa and Silas Mundawarara signed for the government of Zimbabwe Rhodesia, and Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo for the Patriotic Front. According to Robert Matthews, the success of the Lancaster House negotiations can be explained by a &quot;balance of forces on the battlefield that clearly favoured the nationalists&quot; the impact of international sanctions on the Rhodesian economy, &quot;a particular pattern of third party interests&quot; and the resource and skills that Lord Carrington brought to the table as a mediator. The agreement was also described as a &quot;constitutional compromise&quot;.

==Outcome==
Under the terms of the agreement, Zimbabwe Rhodesia temporarily reverted to its former status as the colony of Southern Rhodesia, thereby ending the rebellion caused by Rhodesia&#x27;s Unilateral Declaration of Independence. Lord Soames was appointed governor with full executive and legislative powers. The agreement would lead to the dissolution of the unrecognised state of Zimbabwe Rhodesia, created months earlier by the Internal Settlement.

In terms of the ceasefire, ZAPU and ZANU guerrillas were to gather at designated assembly points under British supervision, following which elections were to be held to elect a new government. These elections were held in February 1980, and resulted in the Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) led by Robert Mugabe winning a majority of seats. Independence in terms of the agreed-upon constitution, during the Lancaster House negotiations, was granted to Zimbabwe on 18 April 1980 with Robert Mugabe as the first prime minister. Mugabe&#x27;s victory reportedly spelled &quot;disaster&quot; for South Africa&#x27;s plan to establish a &quot;neutral constellation of friendly, client states.&quot;

The content of Lancaster House Agreement covered the new constitution, pre-independence arrangements, and the terms of ceasefire. The agreement is named after Lancaster House in London, where the conference on independence from 10 September to 15 December 1979 was held. The agreement was not, however, signed until 21 December.

==Later developments==
In February 1980, the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 463 which called on all parties to comply with the agreement, and the UK to fully implement the agreement, encouraging the UK government to ensure that South African forces would be withdrawn, regular or mercenary, out of the country. It also requested that UK allow the speedy return of Zimbabwean exiles and refugees, release of political prisoners, confinement of the Rhodesian and auxiliary forces to their bases, and rescindment of all emergency measures and laws inconsistent with the conduct of free and fair elections. The resolution also condemned South Africa for its interference in Southern Rhodesia and reaffirmed the &quot;unalienable right&quot; of the Zimbabwean people to self-determination. The council adopted the resolution by 14 votes to none, while the United Kingdom did not participate in the vote.

It was said that the &quot;crucial land question&quot; was excluded from the conference&#x27;s deliberations, with the &quot;key financial backing for land restitution&quot; promised by the Carter Administration, but it actually delayed land reform by ten years. The agreement specified that the new government could buy land owned by white settlers, but only from &quot;willing sellers&quot; with compensation, and without formal stipulations for Britain to &quot;fund land programmes&quot;. It was also said that the British were protective of &quot;white farming interests&quot; in Zimbabwe.

In 1997, war veterans began receiving individual personal payments of ZW$50,000 each for their service in the Rhodesian Bush War. Some months later, Robert Mugabe announced that the forced acquisition of land under section 8 would proceed. Within 24 hours, the local currency had devalued more than 50%. In 2000 and 2001, the U.S. and British governments, and the European Union, would condemn the new land reform program, although African organizations also criticised the international community for their role in the situation, and Britain&#x27;s abrogation of their promises made at the time of Zimbabwean independence from colonial rule.

<text>Eschborn () is a town in the Main-Taunus district, Hesse, Germany. It is part of the Frankfurt Rhein-Main urban area and has a population of 21,488 (2018). Eschborn is home to numerous corporations due to its proximity to Frankfurt and relatively low business tax rate.

==Geography==

===Location===
Most of &quot;old&quot; Eschborn is on the streets Hauptstraße, near the Eschborn S-Bahn station, and Unterortstraße, including the Rathaus (Town Hall) and some old churches.
The village of Niederhöchstadt is part of Eschborn, but with a different phone area code (same as the adjacent community of Kronberg). Between Eschborn and the communities to the north and west are particularly green stretches with some pretty houses, nice walks in the foothills of the Taunus mountains.

=== Landscape ===
Eschborn provides expansive views of the Taunus mountain ranges, especially the &#x27;Altkönig&#x27; and behind it the &#x27;Feldberg&#x27; up to elevations of around 880 m above sealevel. From Eschborn to the north there are numerous hiking and biking trails leading up to these green mountain zones. In winter, along and up those hills you will even find cross country skiing slopes as well as downhill sled runs used by large crowds of people, esp. on weekends.

==History==

Eschborn was first mentioned at the beginning of the reign of Charlemagne as king of the Franks. The reason for this first written mention of Eschborn, spelled ‘&quot;Aschenbrunne&quot;’, was a deed of donation (in the name of the martyr ) to the Benedictine Lorsch Abbey, which is about 60 km south of Eschborn.

The name &quot;Aschenbrunne&quot; means &quot;well at the ash tree&quot;.

==Buildings and architecture ==

Large areas of the town are still undeveloped and green expanses fuse in with several high-rises, with a brook passing by the Rathaus (Town Hall) and running close to the S-Bahn railway line, that joins the river Nidda (which in turn is a tributary of the River Main that flows through Frankfurt am Main). Housing large corporations that have chosen Eschborn, the high-rises of Deutsche Bank, LG (formerly occupied by Vodafone (formerly Arcor)), Deutsche Telekom (T-Systems), Ernst &amp; Young, Deutsche Börse Group (building named &quot;The Cube&quot;) and newly SAP, are unmissable.

The street housing the Deutsche Bank offices is named &quot;Alfred-Herrhausen-Allee&quot;, after Alfred Herrhausen, former chairman of Deutsche Bank who was killed on 30. November 1989 by the RAF (Red Army Faction, the Baader-Meinhof Group) assailants near his home in Bad Homburg.

==Town partnerships==
Eschborn is twinned with 4 towns in Europe:
* Montgeron, France since 1985
* Póvoa de Varzim, Portugal since 2010
* Żabbar, Malta since 2010
* Viernau, Germany

==Public transport==

The S-Bahn train station Eschborn Süd (south) happens to be the last stop on the route still falling under the Zone 50 which covers Frankfurt (excluding suburbs), and hence means a lot to employees who can commute using the same monthly pass. Two S-Bahn lines (S 3 and S4) operate to Eschborn. They both connect to Frankfurt Central Station and end at Frankfurt South station.

==Education==
Eschborn has 4 schools in total:
* Hartmutschule (Elementary)
* Süd-West-Schule (Elementary)
* Westerbach-Schule (Elementary), in Niederhöchstadt
* Heinrich-von-Kleist-Schule (High School)

==Economy and business==
Following Government offices are located in Eschborn:
* Bundesamt für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle (BAFA) - The Federal Office of Economics and Export Control 
* Bundesnetzagentur (vormals RegTP; Außenstelle Hessen) - (The Federal Network Agency)
* Bundesrechnungshof - (Branch of the federal financial management)
* Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) - English
Many common companies have headquarters or branches located in Eschborn. Other Companies with branches in Eschborn are: Deutsche Bank AG, Siemens SE, Deutsche Telekom AG, Ernst &amp; Young, Continental AG, and Vodafone Germany.

Nissin Foods GmbH has its offices in Eschborn.

==Sport==
The FC Eschborn football team was established in 1930.
The chess club &quot;SC Eschborn 1974&quot; was founded in 1974.

==Points of interest==
* Arboretum Main-Taunus

==Notable people==

* Heinrich von Kleist (1777–1811), was quartered on 25 February 1795 as a young lieutenant in Eschborn. He wrote two letters to his sister
* Karl-Heinz Koch (1924–2007), former Hessian minister of justice (CDU), father of Roland Koch
* Roland Koch (born 1958), politician, former Hessian prime minister (CDU), grew up in Eschborn and still lives there today

<doc id="582015" wikidata="Q268604" url="?curid=582015" title="Rita Coolidge">
<text>Rita Coolidge (born May 1, 1945) is an American recording artist. During the 1970s and 1980s, her songs were on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s pop, country, adult contemporary, and jazz charts, and she won two Grammy Awards with fellow musician and then-husband Kris Kristofferson. Her recordings include &quot;(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;re All Alone&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Leave While I&#x27;m in Love&quot; and the theme song for the 1983 James Bond film &quot;Octopussy&quot;: &quot;All Time High&quot;.

==Life and career==

=== Early life ===
Coolidge was born in Lafayette, Tennessee. She is the daughter of Dick and Charlotte Coolidge, a minister and schoolteacher, with sisters Linda and Priscilla, and brother Raymond. Her father was a full-blooded Cherokee, and her mother half-Cherokee and half-Scottish. She attended Nashville&#x27;s Maplewood High School and was graduated from Andrew Jackson Senior High School in Jacksonville, Florida. Coolidge is a graduate of Florida State University, and a member of Alpha Gamma Delta sorority.

=== Early career ===
After singing around Memphis (including a stint singing jingles), Coolidge was discovered by Delaney &amp; Bonnie, who worked with her in Los Angeles. There, she became a backing singer for artists including Leon Russell, Joe Cocker, Harry Chapin, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Dave Mason, Graham Nash, and Stephen Stills. She was featured in Joe Cocker&#x27;s &quot;Mad Dogs and Englishmen&quot; tour and album, singing Russell&#x27;s and Bonnie Bramlett&#x27;s song &quot;Superstar&quot;. Coolidge did not receive songwriting credits for &quot;Superstar&quot; which later became a hit for The Carpenters.

She became known as &quot;The Delta Lady&quot; and inspired Russell to write a song of the same name for her.

===&quot;Layla&quot;===
Coolidge also did not receive songwriting credits for the coda of the 1971 single &quot;Layla&quot; by Eric Clapton&#x27;s band Derek and the Dominos. In 2016, Coolidge stated that she recorded a demo with her boyfriend, the band&#x27;s drummer Jim Gordon, before they went to England to record with Clapton. Once they met with Clapton, Coolidge played the piece she composed for him and she gave him a cassette. Clapton, impressed by the piece, used it as part of the song in the ending section which she found out by hearing the song over a PA system a year later. She tried to contact Clapton, but was told by his manager Robert Stigwood, &quot;What are you gonna do? You&#x27;re a girl. You don&#x27;t have money to fight this. Let it go.&quot; She has not heard from Clapton himself but believes he is aware of the situation.

Though only Gordon has been officially credited with writing the section, the band&#x27;s keyboardist Bobby Whitlock said: Jim took that piano melody from his ex-girlfriend, Rita Coolidge. I know because in the Delaney &amp; Bonnie days, I lived in John Garfield&#x27;s old house in the Hollywood Hills and there was a guest house with an upright piano in it. Rita and Jim were up there in the guest house and invited me to join in on writing this song with them called &quot;Time&quot;. … Her sister Priscilla wound up recording it with her husband, Booker T. Jones. … Jim took the melody from Rita&#x27;s song and didn&#x27;t give her credit for writing it. Her boyfriend ripped her off. I knew but nobody would listen to or believe me. I have told this story for years. 

&quot;Time&quot; ended up on the 1973 album &quot;Chronicles&quot; by Booker T. and Priscilla.

=== Kris Kristofferson ===

In November 1970, she met Kris Kristofferson at the Los Angeles airport when they were both catching the same flight to Tennessee. Instead of continuing to his intended destination in Nashville, he got off in Memphis with her. The two married in 1973, had a child in 1974, and recorded several duet albums, which sold well and earned the duo a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 1974 for &quot;From the Bottle to the Bottom&quot;, and in 1976 for &quot;Lover Please&quot;.

She also had a credited role as Maria in the Sam Peckinpah directed Western film &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot; in 1973, where Kristofferson played the role of Billy the Kid.
Coolidge&#x27;s greatest success on the pop charts came during 1977–1978 with four consecutive top 25 hits, remakes of Jackie Wilson&#x27;s &quot;(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher&quot;, Boz Scaggs&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;re All Alone&quot;, the Temptations&#x27; &quot;The Way You Do The Things You Do&quot;, and Marcia Hines&#x27;s &quot;You&quot;. Coolidge and Kristofferson divorced in June 1980.

=== Later career ===
In 1992, Coolidge sang joint lead vocals with Roger Waters on the title track of his album &quot;Amused to Death&quot;.

She also was among the first hosts on VH1, a US cable network. In 2006, she recorded a standards album, &quot;And So Is Love&quot;, with artwork by Clifford Bailey.

=== Walela ===
In 1997, Coolidge was one of the founding members of Walela, a Native American music trio, that also included her sister Priscilla and Priscilla&#x27;s daughter Laura Satterfield. The trio released studio albums in 1997 (&quot;Walela&quot;) and 2000 (&quot;Unbearable Love&quot;), a live album and DVD (&quot;Live in Concert&quot;) in 2004 and a compilation album (&quot;The Best of Walela&quot;) in 2007.

Walela means hummingbird in Cherokee. Coolidge considered this group important, not only in honoring her ancestors, but also in bringing their culture to others. The trio performed at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.

=== Books ===
Her autobiography, &quot;Delta Lady: A Memoir&quot;, was published in April 2016.

== Personal life ==
=== Relationships ===
Coolidge had romantic liaisons with Stephen Stills and Graham Nash. Coolidge leaving Stills for Nash has been cited as a contributing factor behind the initial 1970 breakup of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. She was the &quot;sweet little Indian girl&quot; named &quot;Raven&quot; in the song &quot;Cowboy Movie&quot; on David Crosby&#x27;s album &quot;If I Could Only Remember My Name&quot;.

Coolidge was also involved with Leon Russell and Joe Cocker. During the &quot;Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen&quot; tour, Coolidge&#x27;s boyfriend at the time, Jim Gordon, assaulted her, resulting in a black eye for the rest of the tour. Coolidge ended the relationship and never spoke to him again. Gordon was later diagnosed with schizophrenia and convicted of murdering his mother.

Coolidge was married to Kris Kristofferson from 1973 to 1980. Their daughter, her only child, was born in 1974. Their marriage deteriorated after she miscarried her second child in 1977. In her memoir, &quot;Delta Lady&quot;, Coolidge described her marriage to Kristofferson as volatile due to his alcoholism and infidelity. She revealed he was also emotionally abusive and would belittle her talent. When they divorced she did not ask him for anything. However, in 2016 Coolidge told &quot;People&quot; that she and Kristofferson still shared a bond.

Coolidge married Tatsuya Suda, a computer architecture researcher, on June 19, 2004, in the Cook Islands. Suda, a Japanese citizen, retired in 2010 after a long tenure as a professor at the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (UC Irvine), when allegations of professional misconduct against him surfaced. Coolidge divorced Suda in 2012. In 2014, he pleaded guilty to a felony charge of receiving illegal payments. Coolidge had lived in Fallbrook, California, where she painted and exhibited her work until 2017.

In 2017 Coolidge rekindled a romantic relationship with Joe Hutto, a former college boyfriend. They married in 2018 and moved back to Tallahassee.

=== Family ===
In October 2014, Coolidge&#x27;s sister, Priscilla, was murdered by her husband, Michael Siebert, in a murder-suicide. The pain of that loss was exacerbated when Siebert&#x27;s ashes were delivered to Rita&#x27;s home and she had to dispose of them.

== Awards and nominations ==
Coolidge was inducted into the Southern Museum of Music Hall of Fame in 2015.

=== Grammy Awards ===
Coolidge has won two Grammy Awards from her three nominations.

<text>Dorchester () is a neighborhood comprising more than in the city of Boston, Massachusetts, United States. Originally, Dorchester was a separate town, founded by Puritans who emigrated in 1630 from Dorchester, Dorset, England, to the Massachusetts Bay Colony. This dissolved municipality, Boston&#x27;s largest neighborhood by far, is often divided by city planners in order to create two planning areas roughly equivalent in size and population to other Boston neighborhoods.

The neighborhood is named after the town of Dorchester in Dorset, from which Puritans emigrated to the New World on the ship &quot;Mary and John&quot;, among others.

Founded in 1630, just a few months before the founding of the city of Boston, Dorchester now covers a geographic area approximately equivalent to nearby Cambridge. When annexed to Boston in 1870, Dorchester was still a primarily rural town and had a population of 12,000. Construction of railroad and commuter streetcar lines brought rapid growth, increasing the population to 150,000 by 1920. In the 2010 United States census, the neighborhood&#x27;s population was 92,115.

The Dorchester neighborhood has a very diverse population, which includes a large concentration of African Americans, European Americans (particularly those of Irish, German, Italian, and Polish origin, reflecting late 19th and early 20th century immigration). More numerous immigrants and their descendants since the later 20th century have come from the Caribbean Caribbean, Central and South America, and East and Southeast Asian Americans.

Dorchester also has a significant LGBT population, with active political groups. It has the largest concentration of same-sex couples in Boston after the neighborhoods of South End and Jamaica Plain. Most of the people over the age of 25 have completed high school or obtained a GED.

== History ==

=== Indigenous peoples ===

Prior to European colonization, the region around Dorchester was inhabited by the indigenous Massachusett. They lived in settlements established alongside the Neponset River estuary, which was a plentiful source of fish, including trout; they also gathered shellfish from the riverbed, and hunted beaver and deer. They established farms in nearby hills. During the initial period of colonization by Puritan settlers, the Massachusett suffered a rapid decline in population due to the introduction of foreign infectious diseases to which they had no acquired immunity and violence related to settler colonialism.

The Massachusett &quot;sachem&quot;, Chickatawbut, negotiated land treaties with the Puritan settlers before dying of smallpox in 1633. His brother, Cutshamekin, who succeeded him, deeded further land to the settlers. The remaining Massachusett in the region, including Cutshamekin, accepted some Christianity as a form of survivance. They eventually resettled in the Praying Town of Natick.

=== European settlement in the 17th century ===

In 1623 a syndicate of Dorsetshire fishermen organized an outport of fishing stages and flakes at Dorchester. In 1626 David Thompson settled his family on Thompson Island in what is now Dorchester before Boston&#x27;s Puritan migration wave began in 1630.

On May 30, 1630, Captain Squib of the ship &quot;Mary and John&quot; entered Boston Harbor. On June 17, 1630, he landed a boat with eight men on the Dorchester shore, at what was then a narrow peninsula known as Mattapan or Mattaponnock. Today it is known as Columbia Point (more popularly since 1984 as Harbor Point). Those aboard the ship who founded the town included William Phelps, Roger Ludlowe, John Mason, John Maverick, Nicholas Upsall, Capt. Roger Fyler, William Gaylord, Henry Wolcott, and other men who would become prominent in the founding of a new nation. The original settlement founded in 1630 was at what is now the intersection of Columbia Road and Massachusetts Avenue. (Even though Dorchester was annexed more than 100 years ago into the city of Boston, residents still annually celebrate the founding on Dorchester Day. This includes festivities and a parade down Dorchester Avenue).

Most of the early Dorchester settlers came from the English West Country, and some from Dorchester, Dorset, where Rev. John White was chief proponent of a Puritan settlement in the Americas. The town developed around the First Parish Church of Dorchester. The building is now operated as the Unitarian-Universalist church on Meeting House Hill and is the oldest religious organization in present-day Boston.

On October 8, 1633, the first Town Meeting in what would become the United States was held in Dorchester. Today, October 8 is annually celebrated as Town Meeting Day in Massachusetts. Dorchester is the birthplace of the first public elementary school in America, the Mather School, established in 1639. The school still stands as the oldest elementary school in the United States. In 1634 Israel Stoughton built one of the earliest grist mills in America on the Neponset River; Richard Callicott founded a trading post nearby. In 1641, Dorcas ye blackmore, an enslaved servant to Israel Stoughton, was the first recorded African American to join a church in New England. She served as an evangelist to Stoughton&#x27;s Native American servants, and the First Parish Church of Dorchester attempted to help Dorcas gain her freedom.

In 1649, Puritan missionaries, including John Eliot, began a campaign to convert the Indigenous people in Dorchester to Christianity with the help of Cockenoe and John Sassamon, two Indian servants in the town. Eliot was given land by the town of Dorchester for his mission, where he established a church and school.

The James Blake House, oldest surviving home in the city of Boston, is located at Edward Everett Square. This is the historic intersection of Columbia Road, Boston Street, and Massachusetts Avenue, a few blocks from the Dorchester Historical Society. The Blake House was constructed in 1661, as was confirmed by dendrochronology in 2007.

In 1695, a party was dispatched to found the town of Dorchester, South Carolina. It lasted a half-century before being abandoned.

=== 18th century ===

In 1765, Irish chocolate maker John Hannon (or alternatively spelled &quot;Hannan&quot; in some sources) imported beans from the West Indies and refined them in Dorchester. He thus introduced chocolate to the North American colonies, and was working with Dr. James Baker, an American physician and investor. They opened America&#x27;s first chocolate mill and factory in the Lower Mills section of Dorchester on the Neponset River. The Walter Baker Chocolate Factory, part of Walter Baker &amp; Company, operated until 1965.

Before the American Revolution, &quot;The Sons of Liberty met in August 1769 at the Lemuel Robinson Tavern, which stood on the east side of the upper road (Washington St.) near the present Fuller Street. Lemuel Robinson was a representative of the town during the Revolution and was appointed a colonel in the Revolutionary army.&quot; Dorchester (in a part of what is now South Boston) was also the site of the Battle of Dorchester Heights in 1776. As a result, the British evacuated Boston, pulling back to a base in New York&#x27;s Manhattan and Long Island.

Originally part of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, the town of Dorchester removed from Suffolk County to Norfolk County when it was created on March 26, 1793. Portions of Dorchester annexed in the 19th century by Hyde Park, Milton or Quincy remained within Norfolk County. Portions annexed by Boston (eventually including Hyde Park) became part of Suffolk County again.

=== 19th century ===

==== Victorian era ====
In Victorian times, Dorchester became a popular country retreat for Boston elite. It developed into a bedroom community, easily accessible to the city by streetcar for commuters. The mother and grandparents of John F. Kennedy lived in the Ashmont Hill neighborhood during the period that his grandfather John F. &quot;Honey Fitz&quot; Fitzgerald was mayor of Boston.

American poet Oliver Wendell Holmes, wrote a poem called &quot;The Dorchester Giant&quot; in 1830. He referred to the special kind of stone, &quot;Roxbury puddingstone&quot;, quarried in Dorchester, which was used to build churches in the Boston area. Most notable of these is the Central Congregational Church (later called the Church of the Covenant) in Boston&#x27;s Back Bay neighborhood.

In 1845, the Old Colony Railroad ran through the area and connected Boston and Plymouth, Massachusetts. The station was originally called Crescent Avenue or Crescent Avenue Depot as an Old Colony Railroad station. The name was changed to Columbia, which lasted until December 1, 1982.

It was then changed again, to JFK/UMASS. It is a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority rail line station for both the Red Line subway and the Plymouth/Kingston, Middleborough/Lakeville and Greenbush commuter rail lines.

In the 1840s and 1850s, a new wave of development took place on a strip of waterfront overlooking Dorchester Bay (Park and Mill streets at the Harrison Square Historic District, later known as Clam Point.) Renowned architects who contributed to one of the most significant and intact collections of Clam Point&#x27;s Italianate mansards include Luther Briggs, John A. Fox, and Mary E. Noyes. By the 1890s, Clam Point gained prominence as a summer resort: the Russell House hotel was its centerpiece and the Dorchester Yacht Club was established on Freeport Street.

In the 1880s, the calf pasture on Columbia Point was developed for a Boston sewer line and pumping station. This large pumping station still stands. In its time it was a model for treating sewage and helping to promote cleaner and healthier urban living conditions. It pumped waste to a remote treatment facility on Moon Island in Boston Harbor, and served as a model for other systems worldwide. This system was operated as the Boston Sewer system&#x27;s headworks, handling all of the city&#x27;s sewage, until 1968.

At that time a new treatment facility was built on Deer Island. The pumping station is architecturally significant as a Richardsonian Romanesque designed by Boston City architect, George Clough.The only remaining 19th-century building on Columbia Point, the headworks is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==== Annexation to Boston ====


Dorchester was annexed by Boston in pieces beginning on March 6, 1804, and ending with complete annexation to the city of Boston after a plebiscite was held in Boston and Dorchester on June 22, 1869. As a result, Dorchester officially became part of Boston on January 3, 1870. This is the historic reason that Dorchester Heights is today considered part of South Boston, not modern-day Dorchester. It was part of the earliest cession of Dorchester to Boston in 1804. Additional parts of Dorchester were ceded to Quincy (in 1792, 1814, 1819, and 1855). Portions of the original town of Dorchester developed as the separate towns of Hyde Park (1868 and later annexed to Boston in 1912), Milton (1662), and Stoughton (1726, itself later subdivided).

In 1895, Frederick Law Olmsted, architect of the Boston Public Garden/Emerald Necklace in Boston and Central Park in New York City, was commissioned to create Dorchester Park. It was intended as an urban forest for the residents of a growing Dorchester.

In 1904, the Dorchester Historical Society incorporated &quot;Dorchester Day&quot;, which commemorated the settlement of Dorchester in 1630. Celebrated annually, Dorchester Day is a tableau of community events, highlighted by such activities as the Landing Day Observance, the Dorchester Day Parade along Dorchester Avenue the first Sunday in June, and the Community Banquet.

=== Turn of the 20th century ===

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Dorchester was a site for community activism related to diverse issues. The first racially integrated neighborhood developed on Jones Hill. One of the residents of that neighborhood, William Monroe Trotter, with W.E.B. Du Bois, helped to found the Niagara Movement, the precursor of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Many leading suffragettes also lived in Dorchester, including Lucy Stone.

In the early 20th century, Dorchester received numerous Catholic immigrants from a variety of nations, such as Ireland, French Canada, Italy, and Poland. In addition, it was a destination for thousands of mostly Protestant African Americans from the South who were making the Great Migration to northern industrial cities for work opportunities and to escape Jim Crow violence. Numerous three-decker apartment buildings were built in Dorchester to house the many industrial workers. 

=== 1950s–present ===

In the early 1950s, Dorchester became a center of civil rights activism by African Americans, who were constrained by de facto segregation in Boston. Martin Luther King Jr. lived there for much of the time he attended Boston University for his PhD. 
&quot;With Boston&#x27;s Baptist community riveted by his preaching and Coretta [Scott King] at his side, King&#x27;s circle grew. The Dorchester apartment drew friends and followers like a magnet, according to [friend and roommate John] Bustamante, with &#x27;untold numbers of visitors coming from the other schools.&#x27; The roommates housed and fed the visitors, who would join in civil rights discussions.&quot;

During the 1960s–1980s, the ethnic landscape of Dorchester changed dramatically. The descendants of early 20th-century Jewish, Italian, and Irish immigrants had become more established and generally moved to newer housing in the suburbs. Newer African, Asian, and Caribbean immigrants and their descendants settled here in the older housing in a succession of ethnicities.

The first community health center in the United States was the Columbia Point Health Center in Dorchester. It was opened in December 1965 and served mostly the massive Columbia Point public housing complex adjoining it. It was founded by two medical doctors, Jack Geiger, who had been on the faculty of Harvard University and later at Tufts University; and Count Gibson from Tufts University.

Geiger had previously studied the first community health centers and the principles of Community Oriented Primary Care with Sidney Kark and colleagues while serving as a medical student in rural Natal, South Africa.

The Columbia Point Health Center is still operating and was rededicated in 1990 as the Geiger-Gibson Community Health Center.

In 1974, the University of Massachusetts Boston moved from Park Square in downtown Boston to Columbia Point in Dorchester. In 1982, Boston State College was incorporated into UMass Boston. Since the 1970s, UMass Boston has expanded substantially, including building a new campus center in 2004 and a new science center in 2015. It has also hosted numerous important social and civic events. In 2000, for example, the university hosted a presidential candidates’ debate between George W. Bush and Al Gore.

In 1977, after an unsuccessful bid by Cambridge to have the John F. Kennedy Library located there, close to the late president&#x27;s alma mater Harvard University, a site was chosen at the tip of Columbia Point and ground was broken. Designed by architect I. M. Pei, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum was dedicated on October 20, 1979.

By the 1980s, the Blue Hill Avenue section of Dorchester had become a predominantly Black community.

During the 1990s, the city administration increased police presence and invested city money into the area for more street lighting.

On March 30, 2015, the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate was dedicated by President Barack Obama. The Institute opened to the public on March 31, 2015.

== Geography ==

Dorchester is located south of downtown Boston and is surrounded by the neighborhoods of South Boston, Roxbury, Jamaica Plain, Hyde Park and South End, the city of Quincy and the town of Milton. The Neponset River separates Dorchester from Quincy and Milton.

=== Neighborhood sections and squares ===
Dorchester is Boston&#x27;s largest and most populous neighborhood. It comprises many smaller sections and squares. Due to its size of about , it is often divided for statistical purposes into North and South Dorchester.

North Dorchester includes the portion north of Quincy, East and Freeport streets. The main business district in this part of Dorchester is Uphams Corner, at the intersection of Dudley Street and Columbia Road.

South Dorchester is bordered to the east by Dorchester Bay and to the south by the Neponset River. The main business districts in this part of Dorchester are Fields Corner, at the intersection of Dorchester Avenue and Adams Street, and Codman Square, at the intersection of Washington Street and Talbot Avenue. Adjacent to Fields Corner is the Harrison Square Historic District, also known as Clam Point. It is notable for its collection of substantial Italianate mansard residences.

Dorchester Avenue is the major neighborhood spine, running in a south–north line through all of Dorchester from Lower Mills to downtown Boston. The southern part of Dorchester is primarily a residential area, with established neighborhoods still defined by parishes, and occupied by families for generations. The northern part of Dorchester is more urban, with a greater amount of apartment housing and industrial parks. South Bay and Newmarket industrial area are major sources of employment.

The Harbor Point area (formerly known as Columbia Point) is home of several large employers, including the Boston campus of the University of Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Archives and Commonwealth Museum, the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, and the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. Distinct commercial districts include Bowdoin/Geneva, Fields Corner, Codman Square, Peabody Square, Adams Village and Lower Mills. Primarily residential areas include Savin Hill, Jones Hill, Four Corners, Franklin Field, Franklin Hill, Ashmont, Meeting House Hill, Neponset, Popes Hill and Port Norfolk.

== Demographics ==

Up until the 1960s, the Blue Hill Avenue part of Dorchester from Roxbury to Mattapan was primarily composed of Jewish Americans whose ancestors had immigrated from eastern Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Neponset neighborhood was primarily Irish-American, most of whom were Catholic.

During the 1920s–1960s, many African Americans moved from the South to the North during the Great Migration and settled on Blue Hill Avenue and nearby sections. While some Jewish-Americans were moving &quot;up and out&quot; to the suburbs, certain Boston banks and real estate companies developed a blockbusting plan for the area. The Blue Hill Avenue area was &quot;redlined&quot; so that only the newly arriving African Americans would receive mortgages for housing in that section. &quot;White flight&quot; was prevalent.

After changes to US immigration law in 1965, Dorchester received new waves of migrants from Puerto Rico, and immigrants from the Caribbean and Central America, such as Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago. Immigrants also came from Cape Verde and Vietnam, as well as other Latin American, Asian, and African nations. Dorchester also continued to receive immigrants from Northern European countries such as Ireland, Germany and Poland. Dorchester became more diverse than at any point in its long history, with many nationalities represented here. These immigrants have helped revive the economy of the neighborhood by opening ethnic stores and restaurants.

The sections of Dorchester have distinct ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic compositions. The eastern areas of Dorchester (especially between Adams Street and Dorchester Bay) are primarily ethnic European and Asian, with a large population of Irish Americans and Vietnamese Americans. Residents of the western, central and parts of the southern sections of the neighborhood are predominantly African American. In Neponset, the southeast corner of the neighborhood, as well as parts of Savin Hill in the north and Cedar Grove in the south, Irish Americans maintain the most visible identity.

In the northern section of Dorchester and southwestern section of South Boston is the Polish Triangle, where recent Polish immigrants are residents. Savin Hill, as well as Fields Corner, have large Vietnamese-American populations. Uphams Corner contains a Cape Verdean-American community, the largest concentration of people of Cape Verdean origin within Boston city limits. Western, central and parts of southern Dorchester have a large Caribbean population (especially people from Haiti, Jamaica, Barbados, and Trinidad and Tobago). They are most strongly represented in the Codman Square, Franklin Field and the Ashmont area, although there are also significant numbers in Four Corners and Fields Corner.

Significant numbers of African Americans live in the Harbor Point, Uphams Corner, Fields Corner, Four Corners and Franklin Field areas. In recent years Dorchester has also seen an influx of young residents, gay men and women, and working artists (in areas such as Lower Mills, Ashmont Hill/Peabody Square, and Savin Hill).

== Transportation ==
The neighborhood is served by five stations on the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Red Line (MBTA) rapid transit service, five stations on the Mattapan Line, five stations on the Fairmount Commuter Rail Line, and various bus routes. Over the last decade, the Dorchester branch of the Red Line had major renovations, including four rapid transit stations being rebuilt at Savin Hill, Fields Corner, Shawmut, and Ashmont. At Ashmont station, the city of Boston and the state of Massachusetts partnered with private investors to create The Carruth, one of the state&#x27;s first Transit-oriented developments (TOD).

Interstate 93 (concurrent with Route 3 and U.S. 1) runs north–south through Dorchester between Quincy, Massachusetts, and downtown Boston, providing access to the eastern edge of Dorchester at Columbia Road, Morrissey Boulevard (northbound only), Neponset Circle (southbound only), and Granite Avenue (with additional southbound on-ramps at Freeport Street and from Morrissey Blvd at Neponset). Several other state routes traverse the neighborhood, e.g., Route 203, Gallivan Boulevard and Morton Street, and Route 28, Blue Hill Avenue (so named because it leads out of the city to the Blue Hills Reservation). The Neponset River separates Dorchester from Quincy and Milton. The &quot;Dorchester Turnpike&quot; (now &quot;Dorchester Avenue&quot;) stretches from Fort Point Channel (now in South Boston) to Lower Mills, and once boasted a horse-drawn streetcar.

A number of the earliest streets in Dorchester have changed names several times through the centuries, meaning that some names have come and gone. Leavitt Place, for instance, named for one of Dorchester&#x27;s earliest settlers, eventually became Brook Court and then Brook Avenue Place. Gallivan Boulevard was once Codman Street and Brookvale Street was once Brook Street. Morrissey Boulevard was once Old Colony Parkway.

== Economy ==
Throughout its history, Dorchester has had periods of economic revival and recession. In the 1960s and 1970s, Dorchester was particularly hard hit by economic recession, high unemployment, and white flight.

In 1953, Carney Hospital moved from South Boston to its current location in Dorchester, serving the local communities of Dorchester, Mattapan, Milton and Quincy.

In 1953, a major public housing project was completed on the Columbia Point peninsula of Dorchester. There were 1,502 units in the development on of land. It later became known for high rates of crime and poor living conditions, and it went through particularly bad times in the 1970s and 1980s. By 1988, there were only 350 families living there. In 1984, the City of Boston gave control of it to a private developer, Corcoran-Mullins-Jennison, who redeveloped the property into a residential mixed-income community called Harbor Point Apartments which was opened in 1988 and completed by 1990. It was the first federal housing project to be converted to private, mixed-income housing in the United States. Harbor Point has won much acclaim for this transformation, including awards from the Urban Land Institute, the FIABCI Award for International Excellence, and the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence.

During the housing crisis of 2008 in the United States, Dorchester&#x27;s Hendry Street became the epicenter in the media In reaction, the city of Boston negotiated to buy several of the houses for as little as $30,000. It is moving to seize other foreclosed properties on which the owners have not paid taxes. The houses were renovated and added to the inventory of subsidized rental housing.

In 2008, plans and proposals were unveiled and presented to public community hearings by the Corcoran-Jennison Company to redevelop the Bayside Exposition Center site on the Columbia Point peninsula into a mixed use village of storefronts and residences, called &quot;Bayside on the Point&quot;. However, in 2009, the Bayside Expo Center property was lost in a foreclosure on Corcoran-Jennison to a Florida-based real estate firm, LNR/CMAT, who bought it. Soon after, the University of Massachusetts Boston bought the property from them to build future campus facilities.

The corporate headquarters of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; was also located in Dorchester, having moved there in 1958 from downtown Boston. In 2009, then-owner The New York Times Company put the paper up for bid, leading to concern from local community members, who had seen other major employers close their doors. After negotiations with their union and cost reduction measures, the owner&#x27;s plans to sell the &quot;Globe&quot; were abandoned in October 2009. In 2013, the paper was bought by John W. Henry, owner of the Boston Red Sox, and in 2017 the &quot;Globe&quot; headquarters returned to downtown Boston.

In the 20th century, many of the labor unions in Boston relocated their headquarters to Dorchester. This includes the Boston Teachers Union, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 103, New England Regional Council of Carpenters, International Association of Fire Fighters Local 718, among others.

== Crime ==
Dorchester, with a population of approximately 130,000, is home to nearly one-fifth of all Boston residents. In the early 1990s, Dorchester, along with Roxbury and Mattapan, had the highest percentage of victims with violence-related injuries. Since the early 2000s, crime rates across Boston have declined. In the first three months of 2013, Boston crime rates reportedly dropped 15% compared to the same time period in 2012.

According to the &quot;Dorchester Reporter&quot; crime maps, the more dangerous areas in Dorchester are west of Columbia Road, with criminal activity centered on the Blue Hill Avenue area. Safer parts of the neighborhood include Savin Hill; the historic neighborhood of Clam Point; Columbia Point, which is populated by mostly UMass Boston students; Ashmont Hill; Saint Mark&#x27;s; Pope&#x27;s Hill; Cedar Grove; Lower Mills, around the Neponset, Gallivan, and Morrissey Boulevard areas; and the Jones Hill neighborhood (with the third-largest percentage of same-sex households in Boston after the South End and Jamaica Plain).

===Statistics===

According to AreaVibes, Dorchester&#x27;s overall crime rate is 30% higher than the national average. For every 100,000 people there are 10.55 daily crimes in the neighborhood. Property crime is much more common than violent crime. Out of 100,000 people, 831 are involved in violent crime, and 3,021 out of 100,000 are involved in property crime.

The chance of being a victim of:

* Property crime = 1 in 34
* Violent crime = 1 in 121
* Crime = 1 in 26

<doc id="582018" wikidata="Q78680" url="?curid=582018" title="Victor Gruen">
<text>Victor David Gruen, born Viktor David Grünbaum (July 18, 1903 – February 14, 1980), was an Austrian-American architect best known as a pioneer in the design of shopping malls in the United States. He is also noted for his urban revitalization proposals, described in his writings and applied in master plans such as for Fort Worth, Texas (1955), Kalamazoo, Michigan (1958) and Fresno, California (1965). An advocate of prioritizing pedestrians over cars in urban cores, he was also the designer of the first outdoor pedestrian mall in the United States, the Kalamazoo Mall.

==Early life==
Victor Gruen was born on July 18, 1903, in a middle-class Jewish family in Vienna, Austria. He studied architecture at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, a/k/a the Vienna Technological Institute and Academy of Fine Arts in Austria. He also worked under Peter Behrens, a leading German architect. A committed socialist, from 1926 until 1934 he ran the &quot;political cabaret at the Naschmarkt&quot;-theatre. At that time he came to know Felix Slavik, the future mayor of Vienna, and they became friends.

==Career==
As an architect he worked for Peter Behrens, and in 1933 opened his own architectural firm in Vienna. His firm specialized in remodeling of shops and apartments.

When Germany annexed Austria in 1938, he emigrated to the United States. Short and stout, he landed &quot;with an architect&#x27;s degree, eight dollars, and no English.&quot; Arriving in New York he changed his name to &quot;Gruen&quot; from Grünbaum and started to work as a draftsman. After the success of his design for the Lederer leather-goods boutique on Fifth Avenue, he received further commissions for the design of shops, including Ciro’s on Fifth Avenue, Steckler’s on Broadway, Paris Decorators on the Bronx Concourse, and eleven branches of the clothing chain Grayson’s.
In 1941 Gruen moved to Los Angeles. He was naturalized as a US citizen in 1943. In 1951, he founded the architectural firm &quot;Victor Gruen Associates&quot;, which was soon to become one of the major planning offices of that time. After the war, he designed the first suburban open-air shopping facility called Northland Mall near Detroit in 1954. After the success of the first project, he designed his best-known work for the owners of Dayton Department stores, the Southdale Mall in Edina, Minnesota, the first enclosed shopping mall in the country. Opening in 1956, Southdale was meant as the kernel of a full-fledged community. The mall was commercially successful, but the original design was never fully realized, as the intended apartment buildings, schools, medical facilities, park and lake were not built. Because he invented the modern mall, Malcolm Gladwell, writing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, suggested that &quot;Victor Gruen may well have been the most influential architect of the twentieth century.&quot;

Until the mid-1970s, his office designed over fifty shopping malls in the United States. Gruen was the principal architect for a luxury housing development built on the site of Boston, Massachusetts&#x27; former West End neighborhood. The first of several Gruen towers and plazas was completed in 1962. This development, known as Charles River Park is regarded by many as a dramatically ruthless re-imagining of a former immigrant tenement neighborhood (Gans, O&#x27;Conner, The Hub). In 1956, Gruen drafted a comprehensive revitalization plan for the central business district of downtown Fort Worth, Texas, but most components of the plan were never realized. Dr. ETH Ing. Walid Jabri, the architect and structural engineer, designed the 55,000 square-meter business complex Centre Gefinor, which was built in the late 1960s on Rue Clémenceau in Beirut, Lebanon for which Victor Gruen designed the complete commercial area on the ground floor and the mezzanine after the completion of the skeleton. Gruen also designed the Greengate Mall in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, which opened in 1965, as well as the Lakehurst Mall in 1971 for Waukegan, Illinois.

In 1968, he returned to Vienna, where he engaged in the gradual transformation of the inner city into a pedestrian zone, of which only some parts have been implemented, including Kärntner Straße and Graben.

In a speech in London in 1978, Gruen disavowed shopping mall developments as having &quot;bastardized&quot; his ideas: &quot;I refuse to pay alimony for those bastard developments. They destroyed our cities.&quot; Gruen died on February 14, 1980.
He was married four times and had two children.

==Influence==
Gruen&#x27;s book &quot;The Heart of our Cities: The Urban Crisis, Diagnosis and Cure&quot; was a major influence on Walt Disney&#x27;s city planning ambitions and his ideas for the original EPCOT.

==&quot;Gruen v. Gruen&quot;==
In 1963, on his 21st birthday, his son New York attorney Michael S. Gruen (then a Harvard undergraduate) was given a painting &quot;Schloss Kammer am Attersee II&quot; by Gustav Klimt. While ownership of the painting was given to his son in 1963, the elder Gruen maintained a life estate on the chattel and continued to hang it in his living room and even paid for insurance and repairs. Upon Gruen&#x27;s death in 1980, his widow, Kemija, refused to surrender the painting to Michael, resulting in a landmark case in the New York Supreme Court and Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals ruled the basis of &quot;inter vivos&quot; gifts, including the plaintiff having the burden of proof to a clear and convincing standard that the chattel was a gift and the required elements of a gift. Kemija Gruen claimed that if the painting was to be given after death, even if such arrangement was made years earlier, then the will, not a letter, would be instructive as to disposition. Michael Gruen was eventually awarded $2.5 million.

<doc id="582022" wikidata="Q4834975" url="?curid=582022" title="BBC Sports Team of the Year Award">
<text>The BBC Sports Team of the Year Award is an award given annually as part of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year ceremony each December. Currently, the award is given &quot;for the team in an individual sport or sporting discipline that has achieved the most notable performance in the calendar year to date. The team should have significant UK interest or involvement&quot;.

==Nomination procedure==
From 2012 the award&#x27;s recipient is decided by an expert panel selected by the BBC. For some years before 2012 a panel of over 30 sporting journalists, each of whom voted for their top two choices and followed a defined set of voting criteria. Before that, the winner of the Team of the Year Award has been chosen by public vote and picked by listeners of Radio 5 Live.

==History==

The Team of the Year Award was first presented in 1960, six years after the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award was introduced. The first recipient of the award was the Cooper Formula One Racing team. The England national rugby union team and the Ryder Cup team have won the award the most times; both teams have won five times and have shared the award on one of those occasions. Liverpool F.C. have won the award four times. The award has been shared on two occasions—by the British women&#x27;s 4 x 400 m relay team and the British Ryder Cup team in 1969, and by the England national rugby union team and the British men&#x27;s 4 x 400 m relay team in 1991. Teams have varied greatly in size. The smallest winning team has been two members; the figure skating duo of Torvill and Dean in 1982 and 1983, and the Olympic men&#x27;s coxless rowing pair of Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent in 1992 and 1996. The largest winning team was in 2012; the British representatives at the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

Six nations have been represented by the award-winning team. Teams representing Great Britain have won the award the most times, having had twenty-three recipients, three of which shared the award. Excluding the 2000 British Olympic and Paralympic teams, which fielded competitors in many Paralympic and Olympic sports, the remainder of the winning teams have represented 15 sporting disciplines. Although dominated by teams from England or representing Great Britain, the award has been won twice by Scottish teams; Celtic in 1967, after they became the first British football club to win the European Cup, and the 1990 Grand Slam winning Scotland rugby union squad.

Football has had the highest representation among the winners, with 15 recipients. The most recent award was presented in 2022 to the England women&#x27;s national football team.

<text>In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a pushout (also called a fibered coproduct or fibered sum or cocartesian square or amalgamated sum) is the colimit of a diagram consisting of two morphisms &quot;f&quot; : &quot;Z&quot; → &quot;X&quot; and &quot;g&quot; : &quot;Z&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; with a common domain. The pushout consists of an object &quot;P&quot; along with two morphisms &quot;X&quot; → &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;P&quot; that complete a commutative square with the two given morphisms &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot;. In fact, the defining universal property of the pushout (given below) essentially says that the pushout is the &quot;most general&quot; way to complete this commutative square. Common notations for the pushout are formula_1 and formula_2.

The pushout is the categorical dual of the pullback.

==Universal property==
Explicitly, the pushout of the morphisms &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; consists of an object &quot;P&quot; and two morphisms &quot;i&quot;1 : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;P&quot; and &quot;i&quot;2 : &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;P&quot; such that the diagram

commutes and such that (&quot;P&quot;, &quot;i&quot;1, &quot;i&quot;2) is universal with respect to this diagram. That is, for any other such triple (&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;j&quot;1, &quot;j&quot;2) for which the following diagram commutes, there must exist a unique &quot;u&quot; : &quot;P&quot; → &quot;Q&quot; also making the diagram commute:

As with all universal constructions, the pushout, if it exists, is unique up to a unique isomorphism.

==Examples of pushouts==
Here are some examples of pushouts in familiar categories. Note that in each case, we are only providing a construction of an object in the isomorphism class of pushouts; as mentioned above, though there may be other ways to construct it, they are all equivalent.

*Suppose that &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot; as above are sets, and that &quot;f&quot; : &quot;Z&quot; → &quot;X&quot; and &quot;g&quot; : &quot;Z&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; are set functions. The pushout of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; is the disjoint union of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, where elements sharing a common preimage (in &quot;Z&quot;) are identified, together with the morphisms &quot;i&quot;1, &quot;i&quot;2 from &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, i.e. formula_3 where &quot;~&quot; is the finest equivalence relation (cf. also this) such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) ~ &quot;g&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) for all &quot;z&quot; in &quot;Z&quot;. In particular, if &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are subsets of some larger set &quot;W&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; is their intersection, with &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; the inclusion maps of &quot;Z&quot; into &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, then the pushout can be canonically identified with the union formula_4.
**A specific case of this is the cograph of a function. If formula_5 is a function, then the cograph of a function is the pushout of along the identity function of . In elementary terms, the cograph is the quotient of formula_6 by the equivalence relation generated by identifying formula_7 with formula_8. A function may be recovered by its cograph because each equivalence class in formula_6 contains precisely one element of . Cographs are dual to graphs of functions since the graph may be defined as the pullback of along the identity of .
*The construction of adjunction spaces is an example of pushouts in the category of topological spaces. More precisely, if &quot;Z&quot; is a subspace of &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;g&quot; : &quot;Z&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is the inclusion map we can &quot;glue&quot; &quot;Y&quot; to another space &quot;X&quot; along &quot;Z&quot; using an &quot;attaching map&quot; &quot;f&quot; : &quot;Z&quot; → &quot;X&quot;. The result is the adjunction space formula_10, which is just the pushout of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot;. More generally, all identification spaces may be regarded as pushouts in this way.
*A special case of the above is the wedge sum or one-point union; here we take &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; to be pointed spaces and &quot;Z&quot; the one-point space. Then the pushout is formula_11, the space obtained by gluing the basepoint of &quot;X&quot; to the basepoint of &quot;Y&quot;.
*In the category of abelian groups, pushouts can be thought of as &quot;direct sum with gluing&quot; in the same way we think of adjunction spaces as &quot;disjoint union with gluing&quot;. The zero group is a subgroup of every group, so for any abelian groups &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, we have homomorphisms formula_12 and formula_13. The pushout of these maps is the direct sum of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. Generalizing to the case where &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are arbitrary homomorphisms from a common domain &quot;Z&quot;, one obtains for the pushout a quotient group of the direct sum; namely, we mod out by the subgroup consisting of pairs (&quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;), −&quot;g&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)). Thus we have &quot;glued&quot; along the images of &quot;Z&quot; under &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot;. A similar approach yields the pushout in the category of &quot;R&quot;-modules for any ring &quot;R&quot;.
*In the category of groups, the pushout is called the free product with amalgamation. It shows up in the Seifert–van Kampen theorem of algebraic topology (see below).
*In CRing, the category of commutative rings (a full subcategory of the category of rings), the pushout is given by the tensor product of rings formula_14 with the morphisms formula_15 and formula_16 that satisfy formula_17. In fact, since the pushout is the colimit of a span and the pullback is the limit of a cospan, we can think of the tensor product of rings and the fibered product of rings (see the examples section) as dual notions to each other. In particular, let &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; be objects (commutative rings with identity) in CRing and let &quot;f&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;A&quot; and &quot;g&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;B&quot; be morphisms (ring homomorphisms) in CRing. Then the tensor product is:
::formula_18
*See Free product of associative algebras for the case of non-commutative rings.
*In the multiplicative monoid of positive integers formula_19, considered as a category with one object, the pushout of two positive integers &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; is just the pair formula_20, where the numerators are both the least common multiple of &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;. Note that the same pair is also the pullback.

==Properties==
*Whenever the pushout &quot;A&quot; ⊔&quot;C&quot; &quot;B&quot; exists, then &quot;B&quot; ⊔&quot;C&quot; &quot;A&quot; exists as well and there is a natural isomorphism &quot;A&quot; ⊔&quot;C&quot; &quot;B&quot; ≅ &quot;B&quot; ⊔&quot;C&quot; &quot;A&quot;.
*In an abelian category all pushouts exist, and they preserve cokernels in the following sense: if (&quot;P&quot;, &quot;i&quot;1, &quot;i&quot;2) is the pushout of &quot;f&quot; : &quot;Z&quot; → &quot;X&quot; and &quot;g&quot; : &quot;Z&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;, then the natural map coker(&quot;f&quot;) → coker(&quot;i&quot;2) is an isomorphism, and so is the natural map coker(&quot;g&quot;) → coker(&quot;i&quot;1).
*There is a natural isomorphism (&quot;A&quot; ⊔&quot;C&quot; &quot;B&quot;) ⊔&quot;B&quot; &quot;D&quot; ≅ &quot;A&quot; ⊔&quot;C&quot; &quot;D&quot;. Explicitly, this means: 
** if maps &quot;f&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;A&quot;, &quot;g&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;B&quot; and &quot;h&quot; : &quot;B&quot; → &quot;D&quot; are given and 
** the pushout of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; is given by &quot;i&quot; : &quot;A&quot; → &quot;P&quot; and &quot;j&quot; : &quot;B&quot; → &quot;P&quot;, and
** the pushout of &quot;j&quot; and &quot;h&quot; is given by &quot;k&quot; : &quot;P&quot; → &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;l&quot; : &quot;D&quot; → &quot;Q&quot;, 
** then the pushout of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;hg&quot; is given by &quot;ki&quot; : &quot;A&quot; → &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;l&quot; : &quot;D&quot; → &quot;Q&quot;. 
:Graphically this means that two pushout squares, placed side by side and sharing one morphism, form a larger pushout square when ignoring the inner shared morphism.

== Construction via coproducts and coequalizers ==
Pushouts are equivalent to coproducts and coequalizers (if there is an initial object) in the sense that:
* Coproducts are a pushout from the initial object, and the coequalizer of &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is the pushout of [&quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;] and [1&quot;X&quot;, 1&quot;X&quot;], so if there are pushouts (and an initial object), then there are coequalizers and coproducts;
* Pushouts can be constructed from coproducts and coequalizers, as described below (the pushout is the coequalizer of the maps to the coproduct).

All of the above examples may be regarded as special cases of the following very general construction, which works in any category &quot;C&quot; satisfying:
* For any objects &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; of &quot;C&quot;, their coproduct exists in &quot;C&quot;;
* For any morphisms &quot;j&quot; and &quot;k&quot; of &quot;C&quot; with the same domain and the same target, the coequalizer of &quot;j&quot; and &quot;k&quot; exists in &quot;C&quot;.

In this setup, we obtain the pushout of morphisms &quot;f&quot; : &quot;Z&quot; → &quot;X&quot; and &quot;g&quot; : &quot;Z&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; by first forming the coproduct of the targets &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;. We then have two morphisms from &quot;Z&quot; to this coproduct. We can either go from &quot;Z&quot; to &quot;X&quot; via &quot;f&quot;, then include into the coproduct, or we can go from &quot;Z&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; via &quot;g&quot;, then include into the coproduct. The pushout of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; is the coequalizer of these new maps.

==Application: the Seifert–van Kampen theorem==

The Seifert–van Kampen theorem answers the following question. Suppose we have a path-connected space formula_21, covered by path-connected open subspaces formula_22 and formula_23 whose intersection formula_24 is also path-connected. (Assume also that the basepoint formula_25 lies in the intersection of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.) If we know the fundamental groups of formula_22, formula_23 and formula_28 can we recover the fundamental group of formula_21? The answer is yes, provided we also know the induced homomorphisms
formula_30
and
formula_31
The theorem then says that the fundamental group of formula_21 is the pushout of these two induced maps. Of course, formula_21 is the pushout of the two inclusion maps of formula_24 into formula_22 and formula_23. Thus we may interpret the theorem as confirming that the fundamental group functor preserves pushouts of inclusions. We might expect this to be simplest when formula_24 is simply connected, since then both homomorphisms above have trivial domain. Indeed, this is the case, since then the pushout (of groups) reduces to the free product, which is the coproduct in the category of groups. In a most general case we will be speaking of a free product with amalgamation.

There is a detailed exposition of this, in a slightly more general setting (covering groupoids) in the book by J. P. May listed in the references.

<text>The Nashville Teens are an English rock band, formed in Surrey in 1962. They are best known for their 1964 hit single &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;, a Top 10 hit in the United Kingdom and Canada, and a Top 20 hit in the United States.

==Career==
While playing in Hamburg, the Teens backed Jerry Lee Lewis for his &quot;Live at the Star Club, Hamburg&quot; album.

The band later backed Carl Perkins on his hit single &quot;Big Bad Blues&quot; (May 1964) and also played with Chuck Berry when he toured Britain. One concert was attended by music producer Mickie Most, who subsequently produced the band&#x27;s June 1964 debut single, an interpretation of the John D. Loudermilk penned song &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;, which reached No. 6 in the UK Singles Chart and No. 14 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The follow-up, another Loudermilk song entitled &quot;Google Eye&quot;, reached number 10 in the UK in October 1964. The Nashville Teens&#x27; record producers also included Andrew Loog Oldham and Shel Talmy. One of their recordings was the mildly controversial Randy Newman number, &quot;The Biggest Night of Her Life,&quot; about a schoolgirl who is &quot;too excited to sleep&quot;, because she has promised to lose her virginity on her sixteenth birthday to a boy whom her parents like &quot;because his hair is always neat&quot;.

A further three top 50 singles, &quot;Find My Way Back Home&quot;, &quot;This Little Bird&quot; and &quot;The Hard Way&quot;, made a brief appearance the following year. Three subsequent records though, &quot;I Know How It Feels to Be Loved,&quot; &quot;Forbidden Fruit&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s My Woman”, all failed to chart. Jenkins left in 1966 to join The Animals and was replaced by his predecessor Roger Groome. Reportedly, Ray Phillips got an offer to join Cream in 1966, but he declined.

Although musically competent, the group&#x27;s lack of distinctive personality contributed to its lack of long-term success, as did Decca&#x27;s poor promotion. (By 1970, Decca&#x27;s only remaining rock acts were The Rolling Stones and The Moody Blues, both of whom handled their own promotion.) In the late Sixties the group returned to its old craft: backing other artists like Carl Perkins, Chuck Berry and Gene Vincent. In 1971 they released a single, &quot;Ella James&quot;, a Roy Wood-penned song originally recorded by The Move, on the Parlophone label, again without success.

==Split and re-form==
Arthur Sharp left in 1972 to join the band&#x27;s one-time manager Don Arden, and Trevor Williams joined. Despite Phillips&#x27;s efforts, the Nashville Teens split in 1975. The band re-formed in 1980, however, with Phillips as the only original member, joined by Peter Agate (guitar), Len Surtees (bass) and Adrian Metcalfe (drums). 

The band is still working. Phillips joined the British Invasion All-Stars in the 1990s and made three albums with the group, consisting of members from The Yardbirds, The Creation, The Pretty Things, Downliners Sect and other groups. The band did a cover of &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; that still receives airplay on XM Satellite Radio. The current line-up is Phillips, Metcalfe, Colin Pattenden (bass and vocals), Simon Spratley (keyboards and vocals) and Ken Osborn (guitar).

A 1993 EMI label compilation, &quot;Best of the Nashville Teens&quot;, contained a re-recording of their &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; hit which is the only version available on iTunes.

Dunford died of a cerebral hemorrhage on 20 November 2012 in Surrey, England.

Arthur Sharp died on 25 December 2023.

==Appearances in films and TV shows==
The Nashville Teens appeared in three 1965 films:
* &quot;Pop Gear&quot;, by Frederic Goode – a long series of pop artists play one or two songs; the Beatles play live for an audience, while the Animals, the Honeycombs, Peter and Gordon and Herman&#x27;s Hermits mime in a studio. The Nashville Teens mime &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; and &quot;Google Eye&quot;. In the United States the film was issued with the title as &quot;Go Go Mania&quot;.
* &quot;Be My Guest&quot;, by Lance Comfort – a family has inherited a hotel in Brighton. Their son works at a local paper and tries to set up a pop group of which one member is played by Steve Marriott. A talent scout scene is a pretext to present a few artists, among them The Nashville Teens who also back Jerry Lee Lewis.
* &quot;Gonks Go Beat&quot;, by Robert Hartford-Davis – set in the distant future. An alien from the planet Gonk comes to Earth to establish peace between the two remaining nations, one of which prefers rock and roll and the other ballads and his task involves listening to the Teens, Lulu and the Graham Bond Organisation.

In 2010 &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; was featured on the 4th-season premiere of &quot;Mad Men&quot;.

<doc id="582030" wikidata="Q5463788" url="?curid=582030" title="Origin (Evanescence demo album)">
<text>Origin is a demo album by American rock band Evanescence. A compilation of home-recorded demos from 1996-1999, the CD was self-released and sold at local shows, and then packaged to showcase to record labels. A total of 2,000 copies were made and sold by the Bigwig Enterprises website from November 4, 2000 to 2003. &quot;Origin&quot; contains demos written and recorded by co-founders Amy Lee and Ben Moody for their earlier independent EPs in the 1990s, including &quot;Whisper&quot;, &quot;Imaginary&quot;, and &quot;My Immortal&quot;, which appear on their debut album &quot;Fallen&quot; (2003).

==Background==
As Evanescence, Lee and Moody had composed and home-recorded demos, including two EPs, &quot;Evanescence&quot; (1998) and &quot;Sound Asleep&quot; (1999), which they sold at their live shows. Their early demos got them airplay on the local modern rock station in Little Rock, which helped them develop a local fanbase, allowing them to play a couple of bigger shows a year and hire other musicians to perform other instruments live. Although they played with guest musicians, Evanescence remained a duo. &quot;It was more because that&#x27;s what we did and how we worked rather than not wanting any other input&quot;, Lee recalled; &quot;The idea of a full band playing these songs was something that only came along later.&quot; Moody said that at the time Lee and he were focused on writing music over playing live shows, and they did not want to have a band join their writing process; &quot;we just wanted it to be the two of us and so we&#x27;d play once or twice a year.&quot; In 2003, Moody stated that he did not remember how many EPs they released, and he viewed their EPs as &quot;really just a means&quot;; CDs &quot;we could sell ourselves at our shows so we could go out and buy pizza. They really weren&#x27;t official releases&quot;.

They sold the home-made demo CD &quot;Origin&quot; at local shows. After driving to Memphis, Tennessee to get it mastered at Ardent Studios, they packaged the CD, wanting to shop it to record labels. It was self-released in 2000, with 500 copies initially pressed. A total of 2000 copies were made, and sold on November 4, 2000 by the Bigwig Enterprises website, which marketed it as Evanescence&#x27;s &quot;debut CD&quot;. According to the Bigwig website, &quot;Whisper&quot; was the lead single from &quot;Origin&quot;, receiving airplay on local radio in Little Rock. Bigwig stated that the CD was out of print by early February 2003, before Evanescence&#x27;s debut single &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; was released on the . Immediately after the release of their debut album &quot;Fallen&quot; (2003), the demo CD was sold for on eBay. In 2003, Lee and Moody encouraged fans who were interested in their demos to download it rather than purchase it for such high prices online.

&quot;Origin&quot; contains tracks from Lee and Moody&#x27;s earlier EPs, including &quot;Whisper&quot;, &quot;Imaginary&quot;, &quot;My Immortal&quot;, and &quot;Where Will You Go&quot;, the first three later appearing on &quot;Fallen&quot; (2003). &quot;Imaginary&quot; and &quot;Where Will You Go&quot; first appeared on the duo&#x27;s 1998 &quot;Evanescence&quot; EP, and &quot;My Immortal&quot; was an outtake from that EP. &quot;Whisper&quot; is originally from their 1999 EP &quot;Sound Asleep&quot;. The track &quot;Even in Death&quot; is from 1996, and is one of the songs Lee wanted on &quot;Fallen&quot;. They recorded the demos with an 8-track recorder at Moody&#x27;s apartment and Lee&#x27;s family&#x27;s attic. They re-recorded &quot;Whisper&quot; and &quot;Imaginary&quot; for &quot;Fallen&quot;, while &quot;My Immortal&quot;&#x27;s demo recording from &quot;Origin&quot; was used by their label Wind-up Records on &quot;Fallen&quot;. As with other releases since the start of Evanescence, Lee was the core writer.

Although initially considered their debut album, &quot;Origin&quot; is a collection of demos. Lee confirmed it was a dressed up demo CD, and stated in 2003: Moody added: &quot;That wasn&#x27;t really an album but our demos. We made it into an album to make it more appealing to the record companies, but it was never an official release ... We also did a lot of songs and demos after that. It was just a stepping stone for us.&quot; He expressed dissatisfaction with their pre-&quot;Fallen&quot; material, stating, &quot;we didn&#x27;t have the technology, so a lot of our early recordings were just shit.&quot;

Lee said in 2007 that they were still finding themselves back then, and &quot;it&#x27;s hard to listen to the really old stuff without laughing at myself a little. But of course those songs will always be special to me, and remind me of a time in my life that was both wonderful and terrible.&quot; She stated that she&#x27;s &quot;always liked the idea of one day putting out a b-sides and rarities CD.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Origin&quot; was released commercially in February 2017 as a part of Evanescence&#x27;s &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot; vinyl box set. Deeming it to be &quot;like an embarrassing old diary&quot; for herself, Lee explained why she included it in the box set: 

In another interview, she stated: 

Lee re-recorded the track &quot;Even in Death&quot; for the 2016 compilation album &quot;Lost Whispers&quot;, which was included in the box set. She stated that re-recording it felt &quot;like that song was truly redeemed because the early recording we have is not an enjoyable recording, but I really love that song.&quot;

==Critical reception==
Sam Law of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; said that &quot;there&#x27;s limited reason for anyone other than die-hards to seek it out&quot;, deeming &quot;Lies&quot; the stand out track for Lee&#x27;s &quot;towering classical soprano delivery – the peak nu-metal synth/guitar interplay and additional death growls courtesy of Living Sacrifice vocalist Bruce Fitzhugh&quot;.

<doc id="582038" wikidata="Q574358" url="?curid=582038" title="Mindon Min">
<text>Mindon Min (, ; 1808 – 1878), born Maung Lwin, was the penultimate king of Burma (Myanmar) from 1853 to 1878. He was one of the most popular and revered kings of Burma because of his role in Fifth Buddhist Council . Under his half brother King Pagan, the Second Anglo-Burmese War in 1852 ended with the annexation of Lower Burma by the British Empire. Mindon and his younger brother Kanaung overthrew their half brother King Pagan. He spent most of his reign trying to defend the upper part of his country from British encroachments, and to modernize his kingdom.

==Early life==
Mindon was born &quot;Maung Lwin&quot; in 1808, a son of Tharrawaddy Min and Chandra Mata Mahay, Queen of the south Royal Chamber. He studied at the Maha Zawtika monastic college in Amarapura until the age of 23, and he held deep respect for religion and religious scholarship throughout his entire life.

Mindon grew up in the shadow of British control – by 1853, the year of his coronation, Burma had gone through radical changes. The British annexations of Arakan, the Himalayan kingdoms of the north of India, and the Irrawaddy Delta and their blockade of Burma caused a tightening of the food supply, the loss of trade through ports, an erosion of Burma as an imperial power, and the incorporation of Burma into the world market as a result. There was an atmosphere of reform due to translated works and better knowledge about the outside world. At the same time, migrations of people from the national core to Lower Burma, controlled by the British, were sapping Burma of its labor and taxes.

==Taking the throne==

Mindon took the throne following a bloody conflict of succession with his half-brother, Pagan Min. Under Pagan, Mindon was the president of the Council of State, and was presiding as the Second Anglo-Burmese War began. He was against the continuation of the war and favored an unpopular program of appeasement. Mindon&#x27;s most loyal ally at this time was his brother Kanaung Mintha.

In a November 1852 plot to implicate Mindon and Kanaung in a series of robberies by the Myowun of Amarapura, Mindon, Kanaung, and their immediate family and retainers fled to Shwebo, the seat of their ancestor, King Alaungpaya. The war with the British had thus become a two-front war, and the court of Pagan quickly collapsed, with the Myozas of Kyaukmaw and Yenangyaung allowing Mindon and Kanaung to walk into the capital, Ava, unopposed. Mindon thus ascended the throne with the regnal name of &quot;Thiri Thudhamma Tilawka Pawara Maha Dhamma Razadiraza&quot; on 18 February 1853.

==Early reign==
The early reign of Mindon was characterized by joint rule with Kanaung, who was allowed a large court and was designated Mindon&#x27;s heir, as well as given control over matters of technology, modernization, and the arts. Behind Mindon&#x27;s throne too was his chief queen and his four chief advisors – the myozas of Magwe, Thalun, Myedaung, and Pahkangyi, the latter being Mindon&#x27;s former tutor who was given the position as Mindon ascended to the throne. This new government was given oaths of allegiance by the Shan princes, as well as gifts from the Chinese.

Immediately following his taking of the throne, Mindon went into a ceasefire with the British, coming into effect on 30 June 1853. Although hostilities with the British had ended, Mindon still faced considerable military difficulties, namely a revolt at Kanpyin and an attack from the neighboring Kingdom of Siam. In late 1853, Mindon won a pyrrhic victory against the Siamese, but when they returned again, he sent 3,000 cavalry supported by artillery, which finally stopped the Siamese encroachment upon Burmese land.

==Achievements==
King Mindon founded the last royal capital of Burma, Mandalay, in 1857. His younger brother Kanaung proved to be a great administrator and modernizer. During Mindon&#x27;s reign, scholars were sent to France, Italy, the United States, and Great Britain, in order to learn about the tremendous progress achieved by the Industrial Revolution.
During Mindon&#x27;s reign, the following reforms were undertaken: centralization of the kingdom&#x27;s internal administration, introduction of a salary system for the bureaucracy (to dampen the authority and income of bureaucrats), fixed judicial fees, comprehensive penal laws, reorganization of the financial system, removal of trade barriers including custom duties, reform of the &quot;thathameda&quot; taxes (to increase direct taxation), and modernization of the kingdom&#x27;s army and introduction of new police forces.

A Burmese manuscript (Or 13681) held by the British Library depicts &quot;seven scenes of King Mindon&#x27;s donations at various places during the first four years of his reign (1853–57)&quot;, including a monastery, rest houses, and gifts for monks.

Mindon introduced the first machine-struck coins to Burma, and in 1871 also held the Fifth Buddhist council in Mandalay. He had already created the world&#x27;s largest book in 1868, the Tipitaka, 729 pages of the Buddhist Pali Canon inscribed in marble and each stone slab housed in a small stupa at the Kuthodaw Pagoda at the foot of Mandalay Hill.

In 1871 Mindon also donated a new &quot;hti&quot; (&#x27;umbrella&#x27; or crown gilded and encrusted with precious diamonds and other gems) to the Shwedagon Pagoda, which is located in then British held Yangon, although he was not allowed to visit this most famous and venerated pagoda in the country.

On 15 August 1873, Mindon also enacted the Seventeen Articles, one of Southeast Asia&#x27;s first indigenous press freedom laws.

In 1875, during a royal consecration ceremony, Mindon took on the title &quot;Siripavaravijayanantayasa Paṇḍita Tribhavanadityadhipati Mahadhammarajadhiraja&quot;.

With the opening of the Suez Canal, Mindon assembled a flotilla of steamers to facilitate trade with the British.

His brother Kanaung is still remembered by the Burmese as an avid modernizer, who would go to the factories early on cold winter mornings with a blanket wrapped around him, just to talk to the mechanics about how the machines ran. He was in charge of the Royal Army, as was customarily required of Burmese crown princes, and he imported and manufactured guns, cannons and shells.

==Religious stance==
Mindon was known for his Buddhist devotion and religious tolerance. He helped build monasteries and missionary schools for Buddhism. The first non-Sangha-run schools in Burma were run by Christians, and Mindon himself sent his son, Thibaw Min, to study in a missionary school.

Mindon also fulfilled his responsibility as a pious Buddhist. He reasserted the king&#x27;s role of being the protector of Buddha Sasana, convened the Fifth Buddhist council in 1871, and supported the work of scholar-monks and their returning to Lower Burma to teach.

==Palace rebellion==
In 1866 two of Mindon&#x27;s sons, Prince Myingun and Prince Myingundaing attempted a palace coup. Myingun claimed that the Crown Prince Kanaung was oppressive, and Kanaung was murdered during the revolt. Mindon escaped alive and the coup was crushed when Myingun fled in a steamer to British Burma. Rumours of British involvement are unsubstantiated, and no evidence exists showing their support for the revolt.

While Mindon was escaping the palace, he ran into a would-be assassin, Maung Paik Gyi, who lost his nerve and grovelled in front of the king. Mindon commanded him to carry him from the palace, which he promptly did.

==Succession crisis==

The rebellion caused Mindon great reluctance in naming a successor to Kanaung for fear of civil war.

One of his queens, Hsinbyumashin, dominated the last days of King Mindon. It was an edict by Hsinbyumashin that ordered almost all possible heirs to the throne be killed, so that her daughter Supayalat and son-in-law Thibaw would become queen and king. Close royals of all ages and both genders were mercilessly executed, after being tricked that the dying king wanted to bid them farewell.

Thibaw, Mindon&#x27;s son from a lesser queen, succeeded him after his death in 1878. King Thibaw was defeated by the British in the Third Anglo-Burmese War in November 1885 resulting in total annexation of Burma.

<doc id="582039" wikidata="Q7821582" url="?curid=582039" title="Tonnage war">
<text>A tonnage war is a military strategy aimed at merchant shipping. The premise is that the enemy has a finite number of ships and a finite capacity to build replacements. The concept was made famous by German Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, who wrote:&quot;The shipping of the enemy powers is one great whole. It is therefore in this connection immaterial where a ship is sunk—it must still in the final analysis be replaced by a new ship&quot;.

Most anti-shipping strategies have had a relatively narrow set of goals. A traditional practice of the Royal Navy during wars between Britain and France was the blockade. By concentrating naval forces near large French ports, the Royal Navy was usually able to impede French trade to the point of creating significant economic difficulties. The opponent may focus on ships carrying strategically vital cargoes such as hemp and timber or, in modern times, oil and iron. The aim might be to attack ships carrying particularly valuable cargoes such as treasure or munitions and ships carrying less important cargoes or steaming in ballast are at first ignored.

These narrow strategies require the attacker to establish substantial control over an area. The British blockades of France were only possible so long as the Royal Navy retained the ability to defeat any French squadron venturing out from port. During the Siege of Malta in World War II, Axis air forces had air superiority and were able to prevent many Allied ships from reaching Malta with supplies, putting the island fortress in grave danger.

A tonnage war is a broad strategy. As a form of attrition warfare, it does not require the attacker to establish control over an area, merely that they sink ships more rapidly than the defender can replace them.

== World War II ==
During World War II, three tonnage wars were fought. The largest and best known of them was Nazi Germany&#x27;s U-boat campaign, aimed mainly against the United Kingdom. Less well-known campaigns were waged by Allied forces in the Mediterranean and Pacific theaters, neither of them deliberately planned as a tonnage war in the way that German U-boat campaign was, but both having that effect— and both were also very successful.

===Atlantic===

The German U-boat campaign, aimed mainly against the United Kingdom, was the largest and longest-running tonnage war of World War II. Although the primary venue for the campaign was the North Atlantic, Hitler sent U-boats and surface raiders to all corners of the globe in search of the most efficient way to sink the maximum number of ships at minimum cost. The U-boats campaign was very successful especially in the two &quot;happy periods&quot;, of 1940 and of 1942, and was able to reduce the total shipping available to the Allies almost to a breaking point in 1943, when the tide of war started turning against Germany. On the other side, an important factor in the British anti-submarine effort was the success of the codebreakers at Bletchley Park in reading U-boat messages encrypted using the German Enigma machine. Even more important was the introduction of shipborne direction finders (known as HF/DF, or &quot;Huff Duff&quot;).

It is maintained by some historians that the U-boat Arm came close to winning the Battle of the Atlantic; that the Allies were almost defeated; and that Britain was brought to the brink of starvation. Others, including Blair and Alan Levin, disagree; Levin states this is &quot;a misperception&quot;, and that &quot;it is doubtful they ever came close&quot; to achieving this.

The focus on U-boat successes, the so-called &quot;aces&quot; and their scores, the convoys attacked, and the ships sunk, serves to camouflage the Kriegsmarine&#x27;s manifold failures. In particular, this was because most of the ships sunk by U-boat were not in convoys, but sailing alone, or having become separated from convoys.

At no time during the campaign were supply lines to Britain interrupted; even during the &quot;Bismarck&quot; crisis, convoys sailed as usual, although with heavier escorts. In all, during the Atlantic Campaign only 10% of transatlantic convoys that sailed were attacked, and of those attacked only an average of 10% of the ships were lost. Overall, more than 99% of all ships sailing to and from the British Isles during World War II did so successfully.

Despite their efforts, the Axis powers were unable to prevent the build-up of Allied invasion forces for the liberation of Europe. In November 1942, at the height of the Atlantic campaign, the US Navy escorted the Operation Torch invasion fleet across the Atlantic without hindrance, or even being detected, in what may be the ultimate example of the Allied practise of evasive routing. In 1943 and 1944 the Allies transported some 3 million American and Allied servicemen across the Atlantic without significant loss.

Unlike the Allies, Germany was never able to mount a comprehensive blockade of Britain. Nor were they able to focus their effort by targeting the most valuable cargoes, the eastbound traffic carrying war materiel. Instead they were reduced to the slow attrition of a tonnage war. To win this, the U-boat arm had to sink per month in order to overwhelm Britain&#x27;s shipbuilding capacity and reduce its merchant marine strength.

In only four out of the first 27 months of the war did Germany achieve this target, while after December 1941, when Britain was joined by the US merchant marine and ship yards the target effectively doubled. As a result, the Axis needed to sink per month; as the massive expansion of the US shipbuilding industry took effect this target increased still further. The 700,000 ton target was achieved in only one month, November 1942, while after May 1943 average sinkings dropped to less than one tenth of that figure.

By the end of the war, although the U-boat arm had sunk 6,000 ships totalling 21 million GRT, the Allies had built over 38 million tons of new shipping.

The reason for the misperception that the German blockade came close to success may be found in post-war writings by both German and British authors. Blair attributes the distortion to &quot;propagandists&quot; who &quot;glorified and exaggerated the successes of German submariners&quot;, while he believes Allied writers &quot;had their own reasons for exaggerating the peril&quot;.

Dan van der Vat suggests that, unlike the US, or Canada and Britain&#x27;s other dominions, which were protected by oceanic distances, Britain was at the end of the transatlantic supply route closest to German bases; for Britain it was a lifeline. It is this which led to Churchill&#x27;s concerns. Coupled with a series of major convoy battles in the space of a month, it undermined confidence in the convoy system in March 1943, to the point Britain considered abandoning it, not realising the U-boat had already effectively been defeated. These were &quot;over-pessimistic threat assessments&quot;, Blair concludes: &quot;At no time did the German U-boat force ever come close to winning the Battle of the Atlantic or bringing on the collapse of Great Britain&quot;.

===Mediterranean===
The second tonnage war was the Allied campaign against Axis shipping, mostly Italian, from Europe to North Africa, in the Mediterranean theatre. British submarines based in Malta and the aircraft of several Allied air forces, in conjunction with British and Commonwealth surface ships, reduced shipments of essential military supplies such as oil to Axis forces under German Field Marshal Rommel to the point where the Germans there were unable to fight effectively. By the close of the campaign, Italy had very few merchant ships left.

There was another tonnage war in the Mediterranean, as Gibraltar convoys battled against Axis submarines and aircraft to deliver supplies and equipment to Malta, which was under siege by air and sea. The deliveries enabled Malta to resist persistent air attacks and take the offensive against Axis convoys.

===Pacific===
In the early years of the Pacific War, the submarines of the US Navy were allocated a great variety of tasks and were unable to achieve many of them effectively, particularly given major technical problems with the Mark 14 torpedoes early in the war as well as lack of aggression on the part of US submarine crews.

Despite an awareness that shipping was vital, the Japanese military seriously underestimated the eventual threat from Allied submarines. This overconfidence was reinforced by the ineffectiveness of the early activities of Allied submarines in the Pacific War. Anti-submarine warfare was accorded a low priority and few warships and aircraft were allocated to protecting merchant shipping. Japanese destroyers formed the bulk of convoy protection throughout the war, while the Allies recognized earlier the need to use the more economical destroyer escorts for convoys, something the Japanese realized too late. The Japanese had impressive night fighting capabilities and heavy torpedo loadouts, but had deficiencies in sonar and radar compared to other navies. Moreover, Japanese Naval doctrine in relation to commerce defense was quite poor. 

During the summer of 1943, substantial numbers of American submarines were tasked with disrupting Japanese trade, in particular the cutting off of the flow of oil and other vital materials from the occupied territories of South-east Asia to Japan. This too, became a tonnage war, with rapidly increasing results, and by mid to late 1944 Allied submarines and aircraft were experiencing difficulty in finding targets large enough to be worth a torpedo. The Japanese merchant navy was all but wiped out, and despite desperate measures to make do without strategic materials, the war economy ground to a virtual standstill.

Japanese submarines, despite their technical prowess and numbers, were used for fleet warfare instead of against the Allied merchant marine in the Pacific theater, thus Allied shipping lanes in the Pacific were not disrupted.

In and around New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, the Japanese resorted to destroyers and submarines, known as the Tokyo Express, to deliver supplies. Particularly in the Guadalcanal Campaign the Japanese Navy was caught in a Catch-22 situation, since American airpower from Henderson Field denied the Japanese the use of merchantmen (slow cargo ships). Compared to destroyers, merchantman were much more economical in fuel usage while having the capacity to carry full loads of troops plus sufficient equipment and supplies. The Japanese Navy was in essence forced to &quot;fight as uneconomical a campaign as could possibly be imagined&quot;, since in using destroyers they had to &quot;expend much larger quantities of fuel than they wanted&quot; considering Japan&#x27;s disadvantage in oil supply, and this &quot;fuel was used to place very valuable, and vulnerable, fleet destroyers in an exposed forward position while delivering an insufficient quantity of men and supplies to the American meatgrinder on the island&quot;. Allied aircraft would prove to be decisive in wiping out Japanese troop convoys, such as the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, despite aircover, and the Battle of Ormoc Bay.

<text>Amtsakhara () is a political party in Abkhazia.

== Foundation ==
On 31 March 1999, Amtsakhara was founded on the initiative of Sergei Dbar, Vladimir Nachach, Aki Ardzinba and Garik Samanba and a number of others as a public organisation uniting veterans of the 1992–1993 war with Georgia. During its founding congress, Dbar was elected its first Chairman, which he remained until 2001. In 2002, Amtsakhara was transformed into a socio-political movement and Nachach and Mirab Kishmaria became its co-Chairmen.

== Prior to 2004 ==
Although originally formed as an association for veterans, Amtsakhara broadened its membership to include the wider community. Before Amtsakhara, the only notable opposition group had been the Aitaira movement. Amtsakhara managed to take over the leadership of the opposition, empowered by its core of veterans. In the years leading up to 2004, Amtsakhara lobbied for reform of the government, including a greater balance of powers between the branches of government, and in particular, an increase in the powers of Abkhazian lawmakers. They were also successful in changing the procedure for amending the Constitution.

Amtsakhara was largely responsible for bringing down the government of Prime Minister Gennady Gagulia in 2003. This was the first time that a government had been forced to resign due to public pressure, rather than being sacked by President Vladislav Ardzinba. Amtsakhara had lashed out at Gagulia for being inefficient and weak on crime , and public anger had boiled over at its congress. They had also threatened to organize a national rally if Gagulia did not step down.

As perhaps the only opposition group with the capability to challenge the Abkhazian government, they were threatened at various times. On April 19, 2003, their office was bombed, although there were no casualties. Two of their activists died in a car bombing, which they accused the authorities of being complicit in. In June 2004, Garri Aiba, one of Amtsakhara&#x27;s leaders was shot dead while driving through the city. As a result, foreign minister and fellow Amtsakhara leader Sergei Shamba resigned in protest.

During 2003 and early 2004, Amtsakhara lobbied for President Ardzinba to step down. In late 2003, they had asked parliament to come up with a means for impeaching him by mid-December, but this did not occur.

==2004 Presidential election==
Amtsakhara intended to challenge the ruling party at the October 2004 Presidential election, when Ardzinba was forced by the Constitution to step down.

Their chances of winning the 2004 elections initially suffered a blow in April 2004, when several other opposition politicians combined to form the United Abkhazia alliance. However, in June 2004, Amtsakhara and United Abkhazia agreed to form a combined front at the elections, after the Aiba assassination. On July 20, 2004, they named former prime minister Sergei Bagapsh as their presidential candidate, ending rumors that they may put up multiple candidates due to their prior lack of a clear leader.

== Since 2013 ==
On 27 June 2013, Amtsakhara held a congress in which it transformed itself into a fully fledged political party, elected as its chairmen Garik Samanba and Otar Lomia, and as its Deputy Chairmen Vitali Tarnava and Ramaz Jopua.

Following the May 2014 Revolution, Amtsakhara held an extraordinary congress on 18 July, in which it condemned the events and nominated Security Service Chairman Aslan Bzhania for President in the August election. It held an extraordinary congress on 7 November to discuss the proposed Treaty on Alliance and Integration with Russia.

On 22 May 2015, Amtsakhara held its fifth congress. Co-Chairman Samanba sharply criticised the government and stated that Amtsakhara was now Abkhazia&#x27;s sole opposition party. The congress unanimously called upon president Raul Khajimba to appoint a member of the opposition to the post of Prime Minister and approved a change to its leadership structure, reducing its number of Chairmen from three to one. On 4 June, the party&#x27;s Political Council decided that Co-Chairman Alkhas Kvitsinia should take over as sole leader and elected him as the council&#x27;s chairman. On 21 October, at Amtsakhara&#x27;s sixth congress, it confirmed this decision by electing Kvitsinia as the party&#x27;s Chairman. It also adopted a resolution calling on President Raul Khajimba to resign.

On 3 March 2016, Amtsakhara expressed its support for the planned referendum to hold an early presidential election. After President Raul Khajimba approved the referendum and set its date to be 10 July, Amtsakhara planned a congress for 5 July. The congress had been planned to be held at the State Philharmonic, but the participants found the building locked, and decided to hold the congress in the adjacent park, with a one-hour delay as the electricity had been switched off. The congress adopted several demands, including the dismissal of Interior Minister Leonid Dzapshba and the postponement of the referendum to the Autumn. Participants then moved to the Interior Ministry to reiterate their demands. Despite pleas by Chairman Alkhas Kvitsinia not to violate the Ministry building, a number of activists tried to break through the security cordon, including by throwing stones, bricks and molotov cocktails. As a result of the violence, nineteen security officers were injured, of which nine had to be hospitalised.

On 30 November 2016, Amtsakhara held its 7th congress, in which it listed a number of complaints against the authorities, among which that it had sabotaged the recall referendum. The congress called upon President Raul Khajimba to resign by 15 December, failing which it would organise a &#x27;People&#x27;s Assembly&#x27; on that date.

<text>For Microsoft Windows, OS/2, and DOS, .exe is the filename extension that denotes a file as being executable a computer program containing an entry point.

In addition to being executable (adjective) such a file is often called an executable (noun) which is sometimes abbreviated as EXE.

== File formats ==

The file format of an EXE file varies by operating system version.

An operating system cannot use an EXE file unless it is formatted for it. Note that some formats support multiple operating systems.

=== DOS ===
;16-bit DOS MZ executable (MZ): The original DOS executable file format. These formats can be identified by the letters &quot;MZ&quot; at the beginning of the file in ASCII. Later formats may contain an MZ DOS stub header.
;16-bit New Executable (NE): Introduced with the multitasking MS-DOS 4.0 and also used by 16-bit OS/2 and Windows, NE can be identified by the &quot;NE&quot; in ASCII.

=== OS/2 ===
;32-bit Linear Executable (LX): Introduced with OS/2 2.0, these can be identified by the &quot;LX&quot; in ASCII. These can only be run by OS/2 2.0 and higher.
;Mixed 16/32-bit Linear Executable (LE): Introduced with OS/2 2.0, these can be identified by the &quot;LE&quot; in ASCII. VxD drivers on Windows 3.x, OS/2, and Windows 9x also use LE format.

=== Windows ===

;32-bit Portable Executable (PE): Introduced with Windows NT, they are fat binaries consisting of a DOS-specific and a Windows-specific part. The DOS-specific part (dubbed DOS stub) is a legitimate 16-bit DOS program. Microsoft C++ linker, by default, uses a minimal DOS stub that prints the following message: &quot;This program cannot be run in DOS mode.&quot; Windows ignores the DOS stub and executes the Windows-specific portion that starts with the &quot;PE\0\0&quot; ASCII sequence (letters &quot;PE&quot; and two null bytes). With some linkers, it is possible to specify a custom DOS stub. Indeed, there are a few dual programs, such as regedit in Windows 95 and old versions of WinZIP self extractors.
;64-bit Portable Executable (PE32+): Introduced by 64-bit versions of Windows, this is a PE file with wider fields. In most cases, code can be written to simply work as either a 32 or 64-bit PE file. This file also includes a DOS stub.

=== Other ===

There are other EXE formats, including but not limited to &quot;W3&quot; (a collection of LE files, only used in WIN386.EXE), &quot;W4&quot; (a compressed collection of LE files, only used in VMM32.VXD), &quot;DL&quot;, &quot;MP&quot;, &quot;P2&quot;, &quot;P3&quot; (last three used by Phar Lap extenders).

<doc id="582061" wikidata="Q7578789" url="?curid=582061" title="Spodomancy">
<text>Spodomancy (also known as tephramancy and tephromancy) is a form of divination by examining cinders, soot, or ashes (), particularly although not exclusively from a ritual sacrifice. Spodomancy has been practiced by numerous cultures, ancient and modern, across the globe. While many practitioners (particularly in Europe) have performed the ritual as part of a formal system of paranormal, religious, or ceremonial magic, many have done so as part of mere folkloric practice or superstition.

==Similar practices==
Spodomancy includes at least two and possibly three other divination practices and rituals involving cinders or ashes. These are:
*Cineromancy/Ceneromancy—Divination involving the ashes of a specifically sacrificial or ritual fire. This ritual calls for the removal of any unburned wood or coals, and interpreting the mounds, ridges, valleys, and other imperfections in the surface. Special attention was paid to intersections of these elements, or where they dead-ended.
*Libanomancy—Divination by studying the burning of incense, or the patterns made by incense smoke or ash.
*Xylomancy—Divination by observing the shape of wood in one&#x27;s path, or the appearance wood takes while burning. Most sources places xylomancy under pyromancy (divination by observing flame, coals, or embers or by burning ritual items such as coal, laurel leaves, or salt). But one source claims that spodomancy includes xylomancy.

Spodomancy is distinguishable from capnomancy, which is divination by observing smoke, and pyromancy (and its many subsidiary rituals), which is divination by observing burning things or coals (but not their ash or cinders).

===Possible differences between tephramancy and tephromancy===
Not all sources agree that tephramancy and tephromancy are synonyms. Some sources claim that tephramancy uses only the ash of tree bark, while tephromancy may use the ashes of any sacrifice. Other sources claim, however, that tephramancy utilized only the ashes of human sacrificial victims.

==The rite, history, and global practice of spodomancy==
Spodomancy is an ancient and globally widespread divination practice. The ancient Greek playwright Aeschylus (525–456 BC) noted that ashes falling from a fireplace could be divined for portents. A word, phrase, name, or question would be written in the ashes with a finger or stick. The individual would wait for a breeze to disturb the ashes, which would form new letters or omens and provide an answer. Not everyone could practice the art. The gift of prophecy was believed to run in some Greek families, and only they were allowed to seek divination from the ashes left by fires on sacrificial altars. In Ancient Thebes, the altar dedicated to Apollo was known as &quot;Apollo of the Ashes&quot; not only because the altar itself was composed of the ashes of human sacrificial victims but because ashes blowing off the altar could be divined for their portents. The Etruscans of the Italian peninsula, whose civilization existed from 1200 BC to 550 BC, also practiced spodomancy in a fashion similar to the Greeks. Romani folklore says ashes can be cast onto the floor. Smooth, uniform ashes are a good omen, while a pile (or piles) of ashes indicate bad fortune. During the Qin (221–206 BC) and Han (206 BC – 220 AD) dynasties in China, a form of spodomancy was used in which the bones of sacrificial animals were raked out of fires and the marks in the ashes and cracks in the bones interpreted for their portents. Several Native American tribes believed that they could divine the future of a newborn or a friend who had left on a journey by looking in the marks and lines left in the ashes of a fire the next morning. From the 16th century to mid 19th century, unmarried English people would draw lines in smooth ashes. The ashes were an indication of a future spouse if two unmarried people sat on the same line. In Kent, this custom was used on Valentine&#x27;s Day to divine who one should court. Peruvians in the late 19th century would spread ashes on the floor the night after a funeral. The next morning, footprints and other marks in the ashes would indicate what kind of animal the dead person&#x27;s soul had migrated into and the direction in which that animal might be found. Among the Loma people of western Africa, spodomancy is still (as of the late 20th century) used to divine the sex of a child before birth. Chinese people in Taiwan still use the ends of sedan chair poles to mark incense ash on altars, and then interpret the marks for divine communication.

The Greco-Etruscan form of the practice seems to be the most common in Europe, historically. But the rites of the practice varied widely even into the early Renaissance. In &quot;The Works of Rabelais, Book III&quot; (published in 1693), Sir Thomas Urquhart claimed that the ashes and soot must be allowed to rise naturally from the fire. The ashes were interpreted as they rose. Ashes which dispersed quickly were a positive sign, but ashes which hung in the air were not. Another tradition indicates that spodomancy may also be practiced by writing a question or message on a piece of paper and then burning it. The burned ashes and soot of the burned message were then examined for omens and interpretation. In Slavonia, only women were permitted to practice spodomancy. A woman would scratch in the ashes. An even number of scratches meant a positive outcome, while an odd number meant bad luck. In Poland, too, only women could practice the art. Ashes would be spread around the bed of a sick person, and the signs which appeared in the ashes were interpreted to indicate whether the person would become healthy again or not. The practice of spodomancy continues to evolve even today. For example, modern Wiccans argue that the fire used by the spodomancer must be a sacred one.

Some spodomantic rituals require the use of a certain writing surface. Most of the rituals outlined above indicate the use of the hearth, floor, or exterior ground as the place to spread ashes. But some examples of spodomancy call for the use of other types of surfaces. Consider the use of bone: Divination techniques closely related to spodomancy include osteomancy (divination using bones, particularly that practice which heats them to produce cracks which are portentious), plastromancy (divination using turtle plastrons), scapulimancy (divination using the shoulder blade; the Scottish term is slinneanachd), and sternomancy (divination using the sternum). However, in these practices, fire is used to cause cracks to appear in the bone. Ash may or may not be used to fill in these cracks, making them more visible. This is not spodomancy, however, as the cracks (not the ash itself) are being read. In Mongolia, however, a divinatory ritual exists in which scapulimancy and spodomancy are combined: A smooth layer of ashes is spread on the shoulder blade of a cow, sheep, or ox, and a lama is divinely inspired to make calculations in the ash which indicate answers to questions or the future. Bone is not the only alternative surface used. Some ancient Greek rituals of spodomancy required that the ashes be spread on a plank of wood rather than the floor.

In the Celtic pagan tradition, spodomancy did not necessarily require the reading of ashes themselves. The filidh were a class of poet-judge-seers who functioned as keepers of mythology and knowledge, historians, lawyers, arbitrators, linguistic experts, and more. One branch of the filidh was expert solely in divination and dreams, and it was commonly believed that simply sleeping next to the ashes of an animal burned in a sacrificial fire could lead to knowledge about the future.

Historical and modern writers consider spodomancy one of the least-familiar methods of divination. Nonetheless, it was common enough in Spain in the late 16th century so that Archbishop of Seville and Grand Inquisitor Alonso Manrique de Lara had to openly ban the practice. It also seems to have been widely practiced in northwestern Germany around the same time.

==Spodomancy and festivals==
According to one account of the Celtic pagan tradition of the festival of Imbolc, cold ashes from the fireplace should be spread on the hearth. In the morning, markings in the ash will indicate that the goddess Brigid has visited the home and has blessed the people living there. If no markings are found, the body of a rooster must be buried at the confluence of three streams and incense burned on the fire the next evening.

An English tradition of the 19th century (&quot;riddling the ashes&quot;) involved spodomancy on St. Mark&#x27;s Eve (April 24). Ashes would be left on the hearth on St. Mark&#x27;s Eve, and examined the next day. Folklore said that the footprint of anyone who was to die in the coming year would be left in the ashes. On the Isle of Man, a similar tradition was observed, although a death would occur only if the footprint pointed inward (an outward-pointing imprint would mean a birth). Another Manx tradition has it that riddling the ashes on St. Mark&#x27;s Eve or Halloween will allow the spirit-imprint of one&#x27;s future husband to appear in the ashes the next morning. Elsewhere in Europe, the riddling of the ashes to learn of births and deaths was observed on Halloween or New Year&#x27;s Eve.

Modern Wiccans advocate practicing spodomancy on Lammas or Lughnasadh (August 1). Ashes from a bonfire or even a simple barbecue grill can be spread on the ground, and any symbols or images in the ashes interpreted. Shapes in the ashes have a wide variety of meaning.

<doc id="582064" wikidata="Q559803" url="?curid=582064" title="Norodom of Cambodia">
<text>Preah Norodom (, ; born Ang Voddey (, ); 3 February 1834 – 24 April 1904) was King of Cambodia from 19 October 1860 to his death on 24 April 1904. He was the eldest son of King Ang Duong and was a half-brother of Prince Si Votha and King Sisowath. He was elected to the throne in 1860 but would not be crowned until 1864 because Siam held the royal regalia (the royal crown and other artifacts). 

In 1863, he signed a treaty with France by giving France control over Cambodia&#x27;s foreign relations in exchange for personal protection against his enemies. The treaty saved Cambodian independence, but French control over Cambodia&#x27;s internal affairs strengthened continually until the end of his reign (full independence was not restored until 1953). His reign of is the longest in Cambodian history in terms of verifiable exact date. Upon his death, he was succeeded by his half-brother, Sisowath.

He is the progenitor of the House of Norodom which has been the ruling royal house of Cambodia since 1860.

== Name ==
Norodom&#x27;s royal name was Norodom Prohmbarirak (), previously, Ang Reacheavoddey (). He is referred to as Ang Voddey in some Western accounts. His posthumous title is Preah Karuna Preah Sovannakot ().

== Rule ==
=== Background: Cambodia from Ang Eng to Ang Duong ===
King Norodom&#x27;s grandfather, King Ang Eng, died in early 1797. He left four sons, of whom the eldest, Ang Chan, became king, but as Chan was a minor on his father&#x27;s death his coronation was delayed until 1806 when he turned 16. Chan quarreled with his overlord the king of Siam (Thailand) and with his brothers, and the remainder of his reign was filled with wars between Chan&#x27;s new overlord, the emperor of Vietnam, and the Thais, fought largely in the territory of Cambodia. Chan died in 1834, but the wars continued until 1847 when they ended with a peace treaty between Siam and Vietnam under which Chan&#x27;s youngest brother, Ang Duong, was recognized as king (the other two brothers were dead by this time). Ang Duong&#x27;s reign, from 1848 (the year of his coronation, although his reign began in 1847 and he had claimed the throne even earlier) until his death in 1860 did much to restore the country, which had suffered much in the previous three decades.

=== Early life and accession ===


Norodom was the eldest son of Ang Duong. In 1850, he and his half-brother Prince Sisowath were sent to study in Bangkok by their father Ang Duong, where they grew up near members of the Siamese royal family. In 1857, Norodom (&quot;Prince Phrom Borirak&quot;) served in the Royal Siamese Army as a military adviser, for which later he was awarded the Order of the White Elephant.

== French protectorate ==
On 17 June 1884, French authorities forced King Norodom to sign a treaty that consolidated their position in Cambodia by forcing him to give up control of public revenue, customs taxes, and public works. Norodom resisted but with French gunboats anchored outside the Royal Palace he had no choice but to sign. The French actions caused widespread anger throughout the country. In 1885, Prince Si Votha, Norodom&#x27;s half-brother, led a revolt against the French rule. The French suspected Norodom secretly supported Si Votha&#x27;s actions and blamed him for inciting the revolts. The revolt ended when King Norodom assured the Cambodians that the French had offered concessions to him. After the restoration of the 1885-1886 revolt, Norodom was temporarily strong. To prevent another revolt, the French were less inclined to force the king to the wall once more.

After the 1897 coup d&#x27;état against his person, he lost confidence in his closest collaborators namely Thiounn and Bernard Col de Monteiro who were appointed as Ministers without his consent.

Following the Sino-French War (1884–1885), French Indochina was formed in October 1887 from Annam, Tonkin, Cochinchina (who together form modern Vietnam) and the Kingdom of Cambodia.

Norodom was a puppet of the French for the remainder of his rule. Before he died in 1904, he appointed his son, Prince Norodom Yukanthor, as heir apparent to the throne. But Yukanthor had a fall-out with the French and did not succeed to the throne. Norodom died in the palace in Phnom Penh in April 1904; his body was cremated in the traditional Buddhist fashion in 1906. His half-brother Sisowath succeeded him.

== Reforms ==
Throughout Norodom&#x27;s reign, several administrative and judicial reforms were improved in the kingdom. The reduction of provinces was imposed to help reduce administrative costs. He also followed King Chulalongkorn and abolished commercial monopolies, slavery, and civil lists for the royal family. During his reign, certain agricultural products such as betel, pepper, and sugar costs were reduced.

== Legacy ==

King Norodom was remembered for his appreciation and fondness of the arts. It was under his supervision that the Silver Pagoda was built in 1892, as well as Wat Oudong consecrated on 6 June 1875. When Norodom assumed the throne in 1860, classical dance recovered some of its ancient prestige. It soon became a great honour for court officials, ministers, and senior dignitaries to have their children admitted to the palace&#x27;s school of dancing.

In 1872, Norodom went on an official visit to Hong Kong, Manila, and Singapore. In Manila, the King was greatly impressed by the musical skills of the Filipinos and decided to take some musicians back to Cambodia to teach modern music. Norodom&#x27;s generosity began drawing artists from many nationalities to Cambodia and they were always given a warm welcome at the royal palace and court. Most of them had a deep interest in the Royal Ballet and thus were given every opportunity to learn Khmer music and dance.

Under King Norodom, the beginnings of the Royal Khmer Navy were established for territorial protection.

<text>Cully () is a former municipality in the Swiss canton of Vaud. It was the capital of the district of Lavaux until 2006 when it became part of the district of Lavaux-Oron. It lies on Lake Geneva.

The municipalities of Cully, Epesses, Grandvaux, Riex and Villette (Lavaux) merged on 1 July 2011 into the new municipality of Bourg-en-Lavaux.

== History ==

The earliest traces of human activity in Cully come from the Neolithic, when Lake Geneva was near the modern port of Moratel. During the Roman Empire, the route from Lausanne to Great Saint Bernard ran through the area. From this time, some walls and coins have been found preserved.

The first written mention of the place took place in 967 under the name &quot;Cusliacum&quot;. Later appeared the names &quot;Cusliaco&quot; (12th century), &quot;Custiacum&quot; (1154), &quot;Cullie&quot; (1226), &quot;Cully&quot; (1275) and &quot;Culyer&quot; (1383). The origin of the name is not clearly understood. It is possibly derived from the Roman family name &quot;Coclius&quot;.

The first document involving Cully, saw it given to the King of Besançon. However, because Cully at the same time was under Villett parishe, which belonged to the bishop of Lausanne, there were constant disputes which led in 1246 to it being given back to the bishop of Lausanne. In the 14th century the inhabitants the acquired the right to hold a weekly market and fortify the village.

With the conquest of Vaud by Bern in 1536, Cully came under the administration of the Bailiwick of Lausanne. After the collapse of the Ancien régime, the village belonged from 1798 to 1803 during the Helvetic Republic to the Canton of Léman. In 1798 Cully Lavaux became the capital of the district, as it was in the central part of the district. It was not until 1824, that Cully attained the status of an independent political community. A project to merge the independent municipalities Cully, Epesses, Riex, Grandvaux, and Villette (Lavaux) failed in a vote on 27 February 2005 due to the resistance of the population of Grandvaux. The project is therefore not being pursued.

Cully was, until the beginning of the 20th century, a predominantly agricultural village. Even today, the vineyards on the slopes of the Lavaux account for some 90 hectares and agriculture and livestock on the plateaus is an important factor in the employment structure of the population. 22% of the workforce are currently employed in agriculture, 6% in secondary industry, and the service sector accounts for 72%.

The area west of the village has evolved in recent decades, a small commercial and industrial area in which businesses in the construction industry and information technology have grown up. The trade of Cully geared towards convenience goods and tourism and there are many wine shops. East of the village there is a small leisure port and a campground. Every year, the Cully Jazz Festival is held. Thanks to good transport links and an attractive location, the village has in recent decades developed into a residential community.

<doc id="582070" wikidata="Q881335" url="?curid=582070" title="Evan Mecham">
<text>Evan Mecham ( ; May 12, 1924 – February 21, 2008) was an American businessman and the 17th governor of Arizona, serving from January 5, 1987, until his impeachment conviction on April 4, 1988. A decorated veteran of World War II, Mecham was an automotive dealership owner and occasional newspaper publisher.

Periodic runs for political office earned him a reputation as a perennial candidate along with the nickname of &quot;The Harold Stassen of Arizona&quot; before he was elected governor, under the Republican banner. As governor, Mecham was plagued by controversy almost immediately after his inauguration and became the first U.S. governor to simultaneously face removal from office through impeachment, a scheduled recall election, and a felony indictment. He was the first and only Arizona governor to be impeached, as well as one of only 15 U.S. governors to be impeached.

Mecham served one term as a state senator before beginning a string of unsuccessful runs for public office. His victory during the 1986 election began with a surprise win of the Republican nomination, followed by a split of the Democratic party during the general election, resulting in a three-way race. While Governor, Mecham made statements and actions that were widely perceived as racially charged or racist. Among these actions were the cancellation of the state&#x27;s paid Martin Luther King Jr. Day and creating an unpaid King holiday on a Sunday, attributing high divorce rates to working women, and his defense of the word &quot;pickaninny&quot; in describing African American children. In reaction to these events, a boycott of Arizona was organized. A rift between the Governor and fellow Republicans in the Arizona Legislature developed after the &quot;Arizona Republic&quot; newspaper made accusations of questionable political appointments and cronyism.

Having served from January 5, 1987, to April 4, 1988, Mecham was removed from office following conviction in his impeachment trial on charges of obstruction of justice and misuse of government funds—funds that Mecham maintained were private. A later criminal trial acquitted Mecham of related charges. Following his removal from office, Mecham remained active in politics for nearly a decade. During this time, he served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention and made his final runs for the Arizona governorship and also for the U.S. Senate, in which he unsuccessfully challenged John McCain as an independent.

==Early life and business career==
Evan Mecham was born to parents who were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Mountain Home, Utah, and raised on his family&#x27;s farm. The youngest of five boys, with one younger sister, he graduated as salutatorian from Altamont High School in 1942 and enrolled in Utah State Agricultural College (now Utah State University) on an agricultural scholarship. Mecham left college and joined the U.S. Army Air Corps in January 1943. He was trained as a P-38 Lightning fighter pilot before being transferred to England, where he flew P-51 Mustangs. Mecham was shot down on March 7, 1945, while flying escort on a photo reconnaissance mission and was held as a prisoner of war for 22 days. Mecham returned to the United States after recovering from injuries sustained in the lead-up to his capture, and received an Air Medal and Purple Heart for his service. Mecham married Florence Lambert in May 1945 and was discharged in December of the same year. Together, the couple raised seven children: Suzanne, Dennis, Christine, Eric, Teresa, Kyle and Lance.

Mecham was an active member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He taught Sunday school and served as a bishop in the LDS church from 1957 to 1961. Part of his faith was that God would guide his actions and provide him the strength needed to endure. These beliefs were in part demonstrated during his time as governor when one staff member reported hearing a conversation in Mecham&#x27;s office before entering the room to find the Governor alone. Another staff member, Donna Carlson, reported that Mecham believed he had obtained office by divine right and was thus not overly concerned about the feelings of others.

Mecham enrolled at Arizona State College (now Arizona State University) in 1947 and majored in management and economics. In 1950, he left school 16 credit hours short of a degree to start Mecham Pontiac and Rambler in Ajo. Mecham relocated to Glendale in 1954 where he acquired and operated a Pontiac dealership until he sold it in March 1988. As a dealer, he appeared regularly in local television commercials and adopted his trademark motto of &quot;If you can&#x27;t deal with Mecham, you just can&#x27;t deal.&quot; The Glendale dealership served as a base for other family-owned businesses, including Mecham Racing, Hauahaupan Mining Company and several auto dealerships in other states.

In addition to his auto dealership, Mecham owned several short-lived newspapers. One of his papers, the &quot;Evening American&quot;, was printed as a Phoenix daily with maximum circulation of 27,000 before becoming a weekly journal. As a newspaper publisher trying to break into the Phoenix and Tucson markets, Mecham testified before the U.S. Senate Antitrust and Monopoly subcommittee on July 13, 1967. This testimony was in response to a bill sponsored by U.S. Senator Carl Hayden that provided partial immunity from the Sherman Antitrust Act, allowing an economically healthy newspaper and one that was failing to form a joint venture combining advertising, printing, and distribution operations while maintaining separate reporting and editorial functions. While supporters of the bill claimed it would prevent newspaper failures, Mecham opposed the bill claiming &quot;The major reason that this bill has been presented is because of the power of the press over the decisions of voters at the polls, and the desire of politicians to court the favor of those who control these monopolistic presses.&quot; He also added that &quot;the tools of monopoly are in the common advertising and the common circulation department.&quot;

==Political career==
Mecham first sought elected office in 1952, while still living in Ajo, with an unsuccessful run for the Arizona House of Representatives. After moving to Glendale, Mecham used the recognition gained from his television appearances to be elected to the Arizona Senate during the 1960 election. After one term as a state senator, in 1962 Mecham attempted to capture the U.S. Senate seat held by Carl Hayden, running on a platform demanding the United States withdraw from the United Nations and critical of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling limiting school prayer. The campaign first saw Mecham win a victory in the Republican primary over Stephen Shadegg, a former campaign manager for Barry Goldwater. Goldwater remained neutral. In the general election, Mecham received only tepid support from his party because of the value of Hayden&#x27;s Senate seniority in passing legislation for the proposed Central Arizona Project. Mecham was defeated in the general election but still polled 45 percent of the vote.
Following his campaign against Hayden, Mecham made an unsuccessful run for state chairman of the Republican party in 1963 and unsuccessful runs for governor of Arizona in 1964, 1974, 1978, and 1982. In these four runs, Mecham gained the Republican nomination only for the 1978 election. He developed a political doctrine supporting Jeffersonian democracy and advocating elimination of income taxes, return of federal lands to state control, removing federal involvement in education, and putting welfare under state control. In 1982, Mecham wrote his first book, &quot;Come Back America&quot;, in which he discusses his earlier life and political views.

In his fifth try for governor, Mecham ran as a political outsider using his standard platform advocating political reform and tax relief. Mecham&#x27;s opponent in the Republican primary, Burton Barr, had served as the Majority Leader of the Arizona House of Representatives. Barr had the support of the state GOP leadership, including Barry Goldwater and John McCain. Mecham&#x27;s core support came from fellow Mormons and the ultraconservative John Birch Society. A sizable portion of the state&#x27;s retired population joined this core support with Mecham&#x27;s promises of tax cuts. Because of Arizona&#x27;s substantial transient population—only about half of the registered voters in 1986 were living in the state in 1980—Mecham&#x27;s record of previous attempts to gain elected office was not widely known by the voters. The primary election also saw the lowest voter turnout in nearly forty years due to unusual rain. Mecham overcame a fifteen-point deficit in the polls to win the Republican nomination with 54% of the vote. Barr failed to spend much of his campaign war chest in the primary, ending his campaign with over a million dollars on hand.

The general election of 1986 saw a three-way race for governor. The Democratic Party had selected the state Superintendent of Public Education, Carolyn Warner, as its candidate. Dissatisfaction among the state&#x27;s business and political leadership with both candidates allowed Bill Schulz, a real estate developer and Democrat who had withdrawn from the Democratic primary because of a family illness, to obtain enough petition signatures to run as an independent candidate. Six years earlier, Schulz had nearly defeated longtime U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater. Goldwater was slow to endorse Mecham in this race, but did so officially at a dinner in Lake Havasu City. During the campaign, the state Automobile Dealers Association&#x27;s ethics committee placed Mecham&#x27;s dealership on probation for being chronically tardy in responding to complaints. The Democratic split caused by Schulz&#x27;s re-entry allowed Mecham&#x27;s campaign to survive.
Mecham won the election with a 40% plurality while Warner and Schulz received 34% and 26% respectively.

==Governorship==
Mecham was inaugurated on January 5, 1987. Among his claimed successes were the opening of a trade office in Taiwan that allowed for a $63 million cotton export contract and strengthening drug abuse prevention efforts through legislation allowing the governor to appoint &quot;pro tempore&quot; judges to deal with drug-related issues. The governor also spearheaded an effort within the National Governors Association to raise the speed limit on rural highways from 55 mph (90 km/h) to 65 mph (105 km/h) and supported a legislative bill to prevent takeover of Arizona businesses. During Mecham&#x27;s term of office, a $157 million budget deficit was eliminated by reductions in state spending.

===Martin Luther King Jr. Day===

Mecham gained national attention several days after his inauguration by fulfilling a campaign promise to cancel a paid Martin Luther King, Jr. Day holiday (MLK Day) for state employees. The holiday had been created in May 1986 by executive order from the previous governor, Bruce Babbitt, after the state legislature had voted not to create the holiday. Following the creation of the holiday, the state Attorney General&#x27;s office issued an opinion that the paid holiday was illegal and threatened to sue the incoming governor over the cost of the paid holiday, as it had not been approved by the legislature. Despite the issues of the legality of how the holiday was created, Mecham replied to comments from civil rights activists and the Black community after the cancellation by saying &quot;King doesn&#x27;t deserve a holiday.&quot; This was followed by him telling a group of Black community leaders, &quot;You folks don&#x27;t need another holiday. What you folks need are jobs.&quot;

In reaction to the cancellation, a protest march to the state capital was held on January 19, 1987, the day the holiday would have occurred. Conventions scheduled to be held in Arizona were canceled, and performer Stevie Wonder and writer Harlan Ellison separately announced that they would boycott the state. The rap group Public Enemy released a song in regard to the cancellation of the MLK holiday titled &quot;By the Time I Get to Arizona&quot;; in the video for the song, the group was seen assassinating Mecham by planting a bomb underneath his limousine and detonating it by remote control. The rock band U2, which performed a concert at Arizona State University (ASU) in Tempe in early April 1987, joined in with the chorus of condemnation of Mecham, publicly announcing that they had donated money to the impeachment campaign, and having him denounced from the stage by a spokesman to their audience and the attending press, television, and radio outlets.

After several months of criticism, Mecham declared a non-paid holiday on the third Sunday in January. Reaction in the state to the non-paid holiday was generally poor.

===Relations with legislature===
Although both houses of the state legislature were controlled by fellow Republicans, Mecham was on poor terms with state lawmakers. He repeatedly asserted that he was under no obligation to cooperate with the legislature, that he was answerable only to the United States Constitution—which, he believed, had been divinely inspired. Several of Mecham&#x27;s appointments to key executive positions—submitted without consultation with legislative leaders—were found to have highly questionable credentials. Examples included his choice to head the Department of Liquor Licenses and Control, who was under investigation for murder; the director of the Department of Revenue, whose company was in arrears by $25,000 on employment compensation payments; the proposed supervisor of prison construction, who had served prison time for armed robbery; and a former Marine, nominated as a state investigator, who had been court-martialled twice. Other political appointees who caused Mecham embarrassment were an education adviser, James Cooper, who told a legislative committee, &quot;If a student wants to say the world is flat, the teacher doesn&#x27;t have the right to prove otherwise&quot;; and Sam Steiger, Mecham&#x27;s special assistant, who was charged with extortion.

Mecham&#x27;s legislative initiatives suffered due to his poor relations with the legislature. His proposal to cut the state&#x27;s sales tax by one percentage point—a key campaign promise—failed, largely because Mecham did not specify which programs would lose funding, thus preventing lawmakers from determining how their constituencies would be affected. His proposed $2.3 billion budget, which cut education funding and froze state employee salaries, was increased by $200 million by the legislature. Mecham lost further support by vetoing bills sponsored by key legislators, such as Senate Majority Leader Bob Usdane. &quot;I&#x27;d say that the cooperation was not great&quot;, Usdane said, &quot;but it&#x27;s his prerogative&quot;. House Majority Leader Jim Ratliff, who had previously been a Mecham supporter, was a veto victim as well. &quot;My only message to the governor is, if he thinks that people advising him to veto [my bill] can help him run the state of Arizona better than I can, then let them&quot;, he said in a statement.

===Other incidents===
Besides the uproar caused by the MLK Day cancellation, claims of prejudice were made against Mecham after he defended the use of the racist word &quot;pickaninny&quot; to describe black children, claimed that high divorce rates were caused by working women, claimed America is a Christian nation to a Jewish audience, and said a group of visiting Japanese businessmen got &quot;round eyes&quot; after being told of the number of golf courses in Arizona. In response to claims that he was a racist, Mecham said, &quot;I&#x27;ve got black friends. I employ black people. I don&#x27;t employ them because they are black; I employ them because they are the best people who applied for the cotton-picking job.&quot; These and other statements only strengthened the allegations of racism made against the governor following the MLK day cancellation.

Mecham made an issue of his relationship with the press. Claiming that many of his problems were caused by media enemies he had made during previous runs for political office, the governor stated, &quot;The Phoenix newspaper monopoly has had my political destruction as its goal for many years.&quot; The governor also claimed, &quot;Every daily newspaper in the state endorsed a different candidate besides me. It&#x27;s taking them a little time to get used to the idea that I was the people&#x27;s choice.&quot; In response to his perceived mistreatment by the press, Mecham attempted to ban a journalist from his press conferences. John Kolbe, a political columnist for the &quot;Phoenix Gazette&quot; and brother of Congressman Jim Kolbe, was declared a &quot;non-person&quot; after a February 25, 1987, column critical of Mecham&#x27;s performance at the National Governors Association. The Governor then refused to acknowledge the presence of the columnist or answer his questions at a press conference. Mecham left the conference after other reporters repeated Kolbe&#x27;s questions. Another incident occurred during a televised event in which a reporter questioned the governor&#x27;s integrity, prompting Mecham to reply, &quot;Don&#x27;t you ever ask me for a true statement again.&quot; Mecham&#x27;s press secretary Ken Smith later argued that the press &quot;largely misunderstood&quot; Mecham&#x27;s retort. &quot;Of course, the governor should not have said that, especially with the TV cameras rolling,&quot; he wrote. &quot;In that heated context, what Mecham was telling Sam Stanton was not to challenge his honesty and integrity. Mecham often said the wrong thing, but he never lied.&quot;

In 1987, a reporter for the &quot;Phoenix Gazette&quot; asked Mecham about the use of the word &quot;pickaninny&quot; in &quot;The Making of America&quot;, a book by Mecham&#x27;s mentor W. Cleon Skousen. Mecham defended the use of the word, saying, &quot;As I was a boy growing up, blacks themselves referred to their children as pickaninnies. That was never intended to be an ethnic slur to anybody.&quot; This quote sparked national attention, in response to which Mecham again defended the use of the term &quot;in a historical sense&quot;. Mecham&#x27;s administration afterward became associated with the term &quot;pickaninny&quot;.
The same year, &quot;Doonesbury&quot; began a six strip series of comics lampooning the governor. The first strip depicted Mecham saying, &quot;My! What a cute little pickaninny!&quot; while patting the head of a black child. Other strips satirized Mecham&#x27;s tolerance of others, political appointments, and the state&#x27;s loss of tourism business. For a short time, Mecham considered suing the strip&#x27;s creator, but later said he had decided to leave the dispute &quot;where it belongs—the funny pages.&quot; In the midst of the scandal, Governor Mecham telephoned &quot;Arizona Republic&quot; political cartoonist Steve Benson, who would later win a Pulitzer Prize in 1993, and told him to stop drawing critical cartoons about him, or his eternal soul would be in jeopardy.

Throughout his administration, Mecham expressed concern about possible eavesdropping on his private communications. A senior member of Mecham&#x27;s staff broke his leg after falling through a false ceiling he had been crawling over, looking for covert listening devices. A private investigator was hired to sweep the governor&#x27;s offices looking for bugs. The Governor was quoted as saying, &quot;Whenever I&#x27;m in my house or my office, I always have a radio on. It keeps the lasers out.&quot; After this was reported, a political cartoon by Benson appeared in the &quot;Arizona Republic&quot; depicting the governor leaving his house outfitted for laser tag. When asked about this by reporters, Attorney General Bob Corbin replied in amusement, &quot;We don&#x27;t have any ray gun pointed at him.&quot;

===Economic impact===
Publicity over Mecham&#x27;s faux pas led to the state experiencing adverse economic effects. Tourism suffered when groups and conventions transferred their meetings out of Arizona. In November 1987, a Phoenix-area convention bureau claimed that Mecham&#x27;s policies on Martin Luther King Day had caused the cancellation of 45 conventions worth over $25 million (~$ in ). One of these cancellations was a National Basketball Association convention in Phoenix. In response to the cancellation, Mecham was quoted to say &quot;Well, the N.B.A. I guess they forget how many white people they get coming to watch them play.&quot;

Public perception of Mecham also slowed down economic development outside the tourism industry. Several corporations looking for locations to build new facilities, including US West and SEMATECH, expressed concern that the governor&#x27;s statements might indicate problems in the local business climate. The executive director of the Phoenix Economic Growth Corporation, Ioanna T. Morfessis, stated &quot;When companies look at a state&#x27;s environment they don&#x27;t want anything that sounds to them like the state isn&#x27;t working right.&quot; As the controversy surrounding the governor built even the business interests within the state abandoned support for him. As the chairman of the state chamber of commerce, William L. Raby, observed &quot;We usually back Republicans, but he&#x27;s a different kind of Republican.&quot;

==Removal efforts==
While criticism plagued Governor Mecham for most of his time in office, it was not until he had been in office for six months that his nominal allies began to break ranks with him. In July 1987, the same month the recall effort officially began, a group of thirteen rank-and-file Republican members of the state legislature met to discuss the governor&#x27;s image problems. Eleven members of the group, dubbed the &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot; by the local press, issued a joint statement critical of many of the governor&#x27;s efforts. Calls for the governor&#x27;s resignation followed several months afterwards, with former U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater leading the way on October 9, 1987. As Mecham&#x27;s problems continued to build, other Arizona political leaders, including Congressman Jon Kyl and Senator John McCain, made appeals for Mecham to step down, but the governor steadfastly refused to leave office.

===Recall drive===
The &quot;Mecham Watchdog Committee&quot; was organized in January 1987 and changed its name to the &quot;Mecham Recall Committee&quot; in May 1987. Pursuant to the Arizona Constitution, a recall petition may not be circulated against an official unless he has been in office for at least six months, except that a legislator may be recalled after he has been in office for five days. These petitions needed a number of signatures equal to 25% of votes cast during the official&#x27;s last election to cause a recall election. On July 6, 1987, the first day that petitions could be circulated, the recall committee began an effort to collect 350,000 signatures, significantly more than the 216,746 signatures required. The recall committee was led by Ed Buck, a registered Republican and gay businessman living in the Phoenix area. In response, Mecham claimed the recall supporters were &quot;a band of homosexuals and dissident Democrats.&quot; Mecham supporters printed bumper stickers reading &quot;Queer Ed Buck&#x27;s Recall&quot; after learning of the recall leader&#x27;s sexual orientation. Mecham also mailed 25,000 letters during September to conservatives nationwide requesting that they move to Arizona and support him in case a recall election were held.

The recall tended to gather signatures in bursts, with most signatures occurring shortly after some action of the governor offended a segment of the state&#x27;s voters. Anger toward the governor grew to the point that on August 15, Mecham&#x27;s appearance at Sun Devil Stadium before an exhibition NFL game resulted in cries of &quot;Recall! Recall!&quot; combined with catcalls. By mid-September, signatures in excess of the minimum required had been collected at roadside locations despite the 115 °F (46 °C) afternoon heat of the Arizona summer. Signature collection continued for the full 120-day period allowed for by state law. On November 2, the recall committee turned in 32,401 petitions containing 388,988 signatures (more than the 343,913 votes Mecham had received during his election). After the Secretary of State&#x27;s office received the petitions, Mecham refused to waive verification of the signatures, forcing the petitions to be sent to the counties for verification. On January 26, 1988, Secretary of State Rose Mofford reported to Mecham that 301,032 signatures had been verified—a quantity sufficient to force a recall election. A recall election was scheduled for May 17, 1988, and former Republican Congressman John Rhodes agreed to run against Mecham.

===Impeachment===
On October 21, 1987, the &quot;Arizona Republic&quot; ran a story claiming that Mecham had failed to report a $350,000 loan from local real-estate developer Barry Wolfson to Mecham&#x27;s election campaign as required by campaign financing laws. These claims were added to a grand jury investigation into allegations that Mecham had loaned $80,000 in public funds to help his auto dealership. Upon learning of the alleged Wolfson loan, the Speaker of the state House of Representatives hired a special counsel to investigate the charges. The third and final impeachment charge involved an alleged death threat to a government official by Horace Lee Watkins, a Mecham appointee, in November 1987. When Mecham was informed of the threat, it was reported that he instructed the head of the Arizona Department of Public Safety (DPS) not to provide information on the incident to the attorney general.

On January 8, 1988, a grand jury issued indictments against Evan Mecham and Willard Mecham, the Governor&#x27;s brother and campaign finance manager, charging three counts of perjury, two counts of fraud, and one count of failing to report a campaign contribution. Mecham and his brother faced 22 years in prison if convicted on all charges. 

The special counsel appointed by the Speaker of the House delivered his report to the House on January 15. Based on this report, the House began hearings into possible impeachment proceedings on January 19. These resulted in the passing of House Resolution 2002 on February 8 by a vote of 46 to 14. Upon Mecham&#x27;s impeachment by the House, his powers as governor were suspended and Mofford became acting governor. Arizona has no lieutenant governor, so the secretary of state stands first in the order of succession if he or she has been popularly elected.

The Arizona State Senate convened as a court of impeachment on February 29. Mecham&#x27;s supporters compared the impeachment trial to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. The charges against Mecham in the impeachment trial were obstruction of justice, filing a false statement, and misuse of government funds. The false filings charge was dropped by the Senate on a vote of 16 to 12. Arguably, the testimony most damaging to Mecham was his own, during which he repeated his assertion that the legislature had no authority over him, and berated individual legislators. On April 4, the Senate convicted Mecham on obstruction of justice by a vote of 21 to 9, and on misusing government funds by a vote of 26 to 4. The Senate then voted 17 to 12 to disqualify Mecham from holding state office again, but that was short of the two-thirds majority required for passage. Upon conviction, Mecham was removed from office and Mofford immediately became governor of Arizona. The recall election was canceled by the Arizona Supreme Court in a 4 to 1 ruling that the constitutionally mandated order of succession took precedence over the state&#x27;s recall provisions.

===Acquittal===
The criminal case against Mecham and his brother went to trial on June 2, 1988. Attorneys who analyzed the proceedings later concluded that the Mechams&#x27; lawyers&#x27; most successful strategy was keeping their clients off the witness stand. The jury found that prosecutors failed to prove that the Mechams knowingly erred on their campaign reports, and acquitted the brothers on all six felony charges on June 10. 1988.

==Later life and legacy==

Following his removal from office and acquittal in his criminal trial, Mecham remained active in politics for several years. He served as an at-large delegate to the 1988 Republican National Convention at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana, in August 1988. Two years later in 1990, he made an unsuccessful attempt to regain the Arizona governor&#x27;s office. In 1992, he received one nomination vote for President of the United States at the Constitution Party National Convention, and ran for the U.S. Senate as an independent against incumbent John McCain, receiving 145,361 votes (10.52%). In 1995, Mecham became chairman of the Constitutionalist Networking Center, a group attempting to create a grassroots organization called the Constitutionally Unified Republic for Everybody (CURE). CURE advocated political candidates supporting a strict interpretation of the United States Constitution.

Mecham spent several years attempting to start a new newspaper, but was unable to secure sufficient financial backing. In 1999, Mecham wrote his third book, &quot;Wrongful Impeachment&quot;. Declining health, including Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and Parkinson&#x27;s disease, first reported in 2004, forced Mecham&#x27;s withdrawal from the public arena and his commitment to the dementia unit of the Arizona State Veterans&#x27; Home in Phoenix. He died on February 21, 2008, in Glendale, Arizona, four years after the diagnosis, and is interred at the National Memorial Cemetery of Arizona in Phoenix. His wife, who died four years later in 2012, was buried alongside him.

The canceled Martin Luther King Day served as a point of controversy for years following Mecham&#x27;s removal from gubernatorial office. In 1989, the Arizona legislature designated a MLK holiday by canceling the state&#x27;s Columbus Day holiday was challenged by two different groups, one a conservative group opposed to the King holiday due to King&#x27;s communist ties and the other composed of Italian-Americans opposed to the removal of the Columbus Day holiday. So the new public holiday was forced to undergo a referendum of voter approval. Neither of the two competing ballot initiatives during the 1990 state election—one removing the Columbus Day holiday to make way for a new MLK day holiday, the other to add an extra paid holiday to the state calendar—obtained a required majority even though 65% of voters supported at least one form of the holiday. In response to the voters&#x27; rejection of a King holiday, the Arizona state tourism officials estimated that concert and convention business worth $190 million dollars were canceled and the National Football League moved Super Bowl XXVII, worth an estimated $150 million that year, from the state, to Pasadena, California. Another initiative in 1992 succeeded in creation of a statewide MLK day holiday (without removing the earlier Columbus Day from the calendar). Afterwards, the NFL awarded the subsequent 1996 Super Bowl XXX to Arizona.

Arizona&#x27;s election laws were also affected by Mecham&#x27;s governorship legacy. In 1988, Arizona voters passed an election initiative that amended the Arizona state constitution to require a subsequent runoff election when no candidate received a majority of the votes cast in a general election. This runoff requirement came into play only two years later in the 1990 election of Fife Symington III, who received more votes than Democratic candidate Terry Goddard but fell just shy of a majority because of a minor independent candidate also on the ballot. The constitutional amendment requiring the runoff was repealed by the voters only two years later in 1992.

Former Governor Mecham&#x27;s earlier press secretary argued, in retrospect, that his overriding legacy was unfair:The tragic fact ... is that Mecham will be remembered as an incompetent, bumbling bigot who got what he deserved. But ... he had some charming personal qualities. He had a genuine interest in helping the disadvantaged. He understood economic development far better than his predecessor, Bruce Babbitt, or his successor, Rose Mofford. He believed in economic equality for all races and minorities, arguing this would be necessary before political and social equality could be achieved. He was deeply troubled by rampant drug abuse. And, his pet project this year [1988] would have been a statewide campaign to help illiterate adults learn to read. This side of Mecham was lost in a fog of controversy that he helped create.

<text>Epesses is a former municipality in the Swiss canton of Vaud, located in the district of Lavaux-Oron on Lake Geneva. It is noted for its wine production.

The municipalities of Cully, Epesses, Grandvaux, Riex and Villette (Lavaux) merged on 1 July 2011 into the new municipality of Bourg-en-Lavaux.

Traces of a Roman road and coins finds indicate an early settlement in the municipality. Epesses is first mentioned in 1453 as &quot;Espesses&quot;. The name comes from the Latin word spissa (meaning dense, thick) probably in reference to the spruce.

With the conquest by Bern of Vaud in 1536, the village came under the administration of the Bailiwick of Lausanne. After the collapse of the ancien régime, between 1798 and 1803 it was part of the Canton of Léman during the Helvetic Republic and then fell under the Canton of Vaud. In 1798 it was assigned to the district of Lavaux.

It was not until 1824, when the community was split from Villette, that Epesses attained the status of an independent political municipality. A project to merge the independent municipalities Cully, Epesses, Riex, Grandvaux, and Villette failed in a vote on 27 February 2005 due to the resistance of the population of Grandvaux.

<text>Forel () is a municipality in the Swiss canton of Vaud, located in the district of Lavaux-Oron.

==History==
The oldest document mentioning the area around Forel (Lavaux) is dated 1140, and mentions Guy de Maligny, the bishop of Lausanne, owning the land with the Lac de Joux Abbey. The document mentioning the forests of Forel (&quot;Fores&quot;) dates to 1274. In 1300 it was mentioned as &quot;Forel&quot;.

In 1298, Pierre and Garnier de Palézieux bought the hamlet of Forel (known today as the &quot;In Forel&quot;) and the surrounding forests from Louis I of Savoy. Two years later, the same Baron of Vaud sold the land to the bishop of Lausanne and it became part of the district of the Grande Paroisse de Villette.

After the departure of Lausanne&#x27;s last prince-bishop in 1536, and the lands came under the administration of Bern, and established the district known as the Place General de Villette. It was not until 1601 that a representative of the farming area of Forel was invited to join the district council in Cully. The Bernese occupation did little to alleviate the feudal taxes and the inhabitants ended up paying more taxes and the tithes (of cereals, wine, vegetables, hemp, flax, cattle and others).

After the collapse of the ancien régime, Forel from 1798 to 1803 under the Helvetic Republic was under the administration of the Canton of Léman and then the Canton of Vaud. In 1798 it became a part of the district of Lavaux. Forel belonged until 1824 to the Greater Municipality of Villette and was also known as &quot;Les Monts de Villette&quot; in reference to its mountains. In 1822 petitions to the State Council from residents of Epesses, the Monts de Villette and Aran, signed by some 145 people, reflected a showing the strong desire for local autonomy.

In 1824, the State Council accepted the division of the municipality of Villette into the areas Cully and Chenaux (capital, Cully) Riex, Epesses, Grandvaux and Curson (capital, Grandvaux) Villette and Aran (capital, Villette) and Forel, which included Les Monts de Villette.

A Provisional Council of six members was appointed and a meeting took place on 2 August 1824. Jean-François Noverraz, who had previously represented Les Monts of Forel in Cully, was chosen as a delegate to represent Forel and was approved on 11 August 1826 by the State Council. The electoral assembly of the municipality was convened between 13 and 14 November 1826 and the first municipal council composed of citizens (all men aged thirty years and more) met on 14 December 1826. From 1827 the council used the Regamey farm until 1974 to hold municipal council meetings.

<doc id="582075" wikidata="Q451319" url="?curid=582075" title="Lev Pontryagin">
<text>Lev Semyonovich Pontryagin (, also written Pontriagin or Pontrjagin, first name sometimes anglicized as Leon) (3 September 1908 – 3 May 1988) was a Soviet mathematician. Completely blind from the age of 14, he made major discoveries in a number of fields of mathematics, including algebraic topology, differential topology and optimal control.

==Early life and career==
He was born in Moscow and lost his eyesight completely due to an unsuccessful eye surgery after a primus stove explosion when he was 14. His mother Tatyana Andreyevna, who did not know mathematical symbols, read mathematical books and papers (notably those of Heinz Hopf, J. H. C. Whitehead, and Hassler Whitney) to him, and later worked as his secretary. His mother used alternative names for math symbols, such as &quot;tails up&quot; for the set-union symbol formula_1.

In 1925 he entered Moscow State University, where he was strongly influenced by the lectures of Pavel Alexandrov who would become his doctoral thesis advisor. After graduating in 1929, he obtained a position at Moscow State University. In 1934 he joined the Steklov Institute in Moscow. In 1970 he became vice president of the International Mathematical Union.

==Work==
Pontryagin worked on duality theory for homology while still a student. He went on to lay foundations for the abstract theory of the Fourier transform, now called Pontryagin duality. Using these tools, he was able to solve the case of Hilbert&#x27;s fifth problem for abelian groups in 1934.

In 1935, he was able to compute the homology groups of the classical compact Lie groups, which he would later call his greatest achievement.

With René Thom, he is regarded as one of the co-founders of cobordism theory, and co-discoverers of the central idea of this theory, that framed cobordism and stable homotopy are equivalent. This led to the introduction around 1940 of a theory of certain characteristic classes, now called Pontryagin classes, designed to vanish on a manifold that is a boundary. 

In 1942 he introduced the cohomology operations now called Pontryagin squares. Moreover, in operator theory there are specific instances of Krein spaces called Pontryagin spaces.

Starting in 1952, he worked in optimal control theory. His maximum principle is fundamental to the modern theory of optimization. He also introduced the idea of a bang–bang principle, to describe situations where the applied control at each moment is either the maximum positive &#x27;steer&#x27;, or the maximum negative &#x27;steer&#x27;.

Pontryagin authored several influential monographs as well as popular textbooks in mathematics.

Pontryagin&#x27;s students include Dmitri Anosov, Vladimir Boltyansky, Revaz Gamkrelidze, Yevgeny Mishchenko, Mikhail Postnikov, Vladimir Rokhlin, and Mikhail Zelikin.

==Controversy and antisemitism allegations==
Pontryagin participated in a few notorious political campaigns in the Soviet Union. In 1930, he and several other young members of the Moscow Mathematical Society publicly denounced as counter-revolutionary the Society&#x27;s head Dmitri Egorov, who openly supported the Russian Orthodox Church and had recently been arrested. They then proceeded to follow their plan of reorganizing the Society. 

Pontryagin was accused of anti-Semitism on several occasions. For example, he attacked Nathan Jacobson for being a &quot;mediocre scientist&quot; representing the &quot;Zionism movement&quot;, while both men were vice-presidents of the International Mathematical Union. When a prominent Soviet Jewish mathematician, Grigory Margulis, was selected by the IMU to receive the Fields Medal at the upcoming 1978 ICM, Pontryagin, who was a member of the executive committee of the IMU at the time, vigorously objected. Although the IMU stood by its decision to award Margulis the Fields Medal, Margulis was denied a Soviet exit visa by the Soviet authorities and was unable to attend the 1978 ICM in person. 

Pontryagin rejected charges of antisemitism in an article published in &quot;Science&quot; in 1979. In his memoirs Pontryagin claims that he struggled with Zionism, which he considered a form of racism.

Of the agricultural land, 22.4% is used for growing crops and 11.9% is pastures, while 19.0% is used for orchards or vine crops.

The municipality was part of the Lavaux District until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and Grandvaux became part of the new district of Lavaux-Oron.

The municipality is located on the shores of Lake Geneva. It stretches from the lake up to the high Signal de Grandvaux. It consists of the village of Grandvaux, several hamlets including Curson as well as woods in the Jorat.

Ignoring immigration and emigration, the population of Swiss citizens increased by six while the foreign population increased by one. There were eight Swiss men and eight Swiss women who emigrated from Switzerland. At the same time, there were thirteen non-Swiss men and twenty non-Swiss women who immigrated from another country to Switzerland. The total Swiss population change in 2008 (from all sources, including moves across municipal borders) was an increase of fifteen and the non-Swiss population increased by thirty people. This represents a population growth rate of 2.3%.

The senior population distribution is 285 people or 14.2% of the population are between 60 and 69 years old, 131 people or 6.5% are between 70 and 79, there are 74 people or 3.7% who are between 80 and 89, and there are 15 people or 0.7% who are 90 and older.

, there were 736 people who were single and never married in the municipality. There were 953 married individuals, 115 widows or widowers and 133 individuals who are divorced.

 the average number of residents per living room was 0.55 which is fewer people per room than the cantonal average of 0.61 per room. In this case, a room is defined as space of a housing unit of at least as normal bedrooms, dining rooms, living rooms, kitchens and habitable cellars and attics. About 59.8% of the total households were owner-occupied, or in other words did not pay rent (though they may have a mortgage or a rent-to-own agreement).

, there were 808 private households in the municipality, and an average of 2.3 persons per household.

There were 110 multi-family buildings (15.9%), along with 97 multi-purpose buildings that were mostly used for housing (14.0%) and 29 other use buildings (commercial or industrial) that also had some housing (4.2%). Of the single-family homes 59 were built before 1919, while 52 were built between 1990 and 2000. The greatest number of single-family homes (122) were built between 1981 and 1990. The most multi-family homes (35) were built before 1919 and the next most (21) were built between 1981 and 1990. There were 7 multi-family houses built between 1996 and 2000.

<text>Lutry () is a municipality in the Swiss canton of Vaud, located in the Lavaux-Oron, which includes the Lavaux region, a UNESCO World Heritage site.

==History==
Lutry is first mentioned in 908 as &quot;in Lustraco villam&quot;. In 1124 it was mentioned as &quot;monasterium Sancti Martini cum villa quae dicitur Lustriacus&quot; and in 1147 it was &quot;Lustriey&quot;.

===Prehistory===

In 1835 and again in 1894, neolithic graves were discovered in Châtelard. The graves contained a total of some thirty stone box graves of the so-called Chamblandes type. They contained three ax blades of worked flint, as well as parts of a shell necklace. In 1895, several graves of the same type were discovered in Montagny. They contained important new items such as antler shafts made for axes, a polished stone ax and stone spindle whorls. While these type of items were often found in the remains of littoral neolithic settlements, they are rarely found in graves, which made the discovery at Montagny especially significant. However, in 1927, archaeologists incorrectly assumed that these findings were assigned to the tombs in error. Without further evidence, they wrote that there was an undiscovered littoral settlement below Montagny.

In August 1984, during the construction of the underground car park in La Possession, an arrangement of 24 standing stones (menhir) were discovered. 18 of the stones were re-erected next to it in the original formation. The thirteen large standing stones ( high) were arranged in a line, while the eleven subsequent smaller stones (from high) described a curve to the south. The standing stones are traditionally assigned to the beginning of the middle neolithic period. However local pottery indicates a later date, to the late Neolithic or early Bronze Age. Menhir No. 14 is a figurative stele, in which geometric ornamentation (x-shaped lines, balanced circles, zigzag line) were carved. Similar symbols can also be found on standing stones in southern France, but their meaning is unknown.

At various places in the municipality, including Curtinaux, Le Châtelard, Savuit and Gantennaz, there are traces of Roman era settlements. These include bricks, walls, parts of buildings and ornaments and the remains of an aqueduct.

===Medieval town===

Lutry was a royal estate of the Burgundian House of Welf. A fortified tower was built in the 11th century in Crêt-Bernard to help govern the estate. After the death of Rudolph III the estate passed to Conrad of Swabia and became an imperial estate. In 1079, Emperor Henry IV donated the estate to the Bishop of Lausanne. The Bishop held the estate until 1536. By 1263, the Abbey of Saint-Maurice possessed some land in Lutry, which they had received in 1017 from the Kings of Burgundy. Between 1025 and 1124, due to the donation of a man named Anselme, a Benedictine priory was founded on the alluvial delta of the Lutrive river. The priory was under the abbey of Savigny-en-Lyonnais (Rhône-Alpes). The priory was the recipient of numerous gifts and church records from the dioceses of Lausanne, Sion and Geneva. Initially it held about fifteen monks, but it quickly expanded and had authority over the villages of Lutry, Villette and Paudex until 1548. At the beginning of the 15th century, the priory freed its serfs. The town of Lutry, which was granted certain freedoms by the bishop, began to develop in the first quarter of the 12th century around the priory. In 1368 the soldiers of Lutry marched under the double banners of the priory and the diocese. Throughout the Middle Ages there were conflicts in the relationship between the mother abbey, the priory, the Bishop and towns.
The village of Corsy (which is now part of the municipality of Lutry) was under the direct rule of Corsier until 1798.

Lutry began to become a town at the beginning of the 13th century when it was encircled by a circular wall created by the Bishop (1212–19). The wall was supported by a square tower, the Tour de l&#x27;Eveque, which was built by William of Ecublens in 1221–29. The hamlets Curtinaux, Savuit, Le Châtelard and Corsy as well as the neighborhoods of Friporte, Voisinand and Bourg Neuf were outside the walls, and soon a second curtain wall was built around the latter. In 1291 there was a hospital in the priory and in 1348 another one was built in the town. With the construction of an inner harbor, market buildings were created in 1408. At the instigation of the monks, a vineyard was placed around the town. An organization known as the Brotherhood of the Holy Spirit, in 1307, marked the beginning of a civic organization. Starting in the 13th century, the town began an effort to deforest the neighboring Monts-de-Lutry, an effort that was completed in the 17th century. The newly available fields, pastures and forests were managed by farmers, who were also citizens of the town.

The parish of Lutry is first mentioned in 1228. The original parish also included Savigny (separated 1598), Belmont-sur-Lausanne (1766–1846) and Villette (1846–63). The Priory Church of Saint-Martin also served as the parish church. The church was built in 1250–60 over a building from the 11th century. It was rebuilt in 1344 following a fire. It was restored and extended in 1569–1591 and renovated from 1889 to 1907.

===Early Modern Lutry===
To manage Lutry, the priory appointed a governor and the Bishop appointed a &quot;Meier&quot; or ecclesiastical bailiff, both of which were based in the castle. The &quot;Meier&quot;&#x27;s office was hereditary in the Mayor de Lutry noble family. The family retained their position even after the conquest of Vaud by the Bernese. The last of the family, Claude Mayor de Lutry died in 1598 and was replaced by a castellan. The castellan ruled over the town as well as the estates of Corsier until 1798.

In 1536 Lutry unsuccessfully opposed the Bernese conquest and the Reformation. The Priory was closed in 1537 and the episcopal properties were secularized. From 1536 until 1798 Lutry was part of the Bailiwick of Lausanne. During this period it was ruled by an eighteen-member council and a twelve-member council, which was led by a knight banneret. There were four judicial courts over the town and the surrounding villages; the courts of Letry and Savigny, the court of the castellan and the court of the Lords of Corsier.

===Modern Lutry===

In 1798, Lutry joined, at the last minute, the Vaud revolution against Bern. Following the French invasion in 1798 and the creation of the Helvetic Republic, it was part of the district of Lavaux. Lutry was administered by an eleven-member council which was led by a Syndic. Between 1803–25 there were 15 municipal councils and officials, which after 1815 met in an upper council. Starting in 1826, Lutry and Savigny separated to form two independent municipalities.

In 1854, the owner of the castle of Lutry was given the town by its owner, Juste Charles Antoine de Crousaz.

The vineyards, which during the Ancien Régime were partly owned by Fribourg, Bern, Lausanne and Yverdon patricians and partly owned by the citizens of Lutry, became the most important source of income in 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century. The construction of a harbor (1836–38), a quay (1863) and a dock (1816, 1912) opened the city to the lake. In 1822 the market building was changed into a school. In 1885, the former school building was demolished to make way for a customs house. The train station of Lutry on the Lausanne–Brig line opened in 1861. Followed in 1862 by the La Conversion station on the Bern rail line, followed in 1920 by the stop at Bossière. Starting in 1896, a tram line connected Lutry with Lausanne.

The period around the turn of the 20th century was characterized both by the influx of many new, non-local families and by phylloxera disease outbreaks in the vineyards. The latter triggered an unprecedented economic crisis. In the 1950s, the decline of viticulture and the parallel urbanization of Lutry encouraged a number of small and medium-sized enterprises. In 2000 there were approximately 400 businesses in the town. Starting in the 1960s Lutry grew into Lausanne agglomeration and became a popular residential area for the wealthy classes.

In 1998, a new port was built.

<text>Harvey Wesley Bolin (July 1, 1909 – March 4, 1978) was an American Democratic Party politician who served as the 15th governor of Arizona between 1977 and 1978. His five months in office mark the shortest term in office for any Arizona governor. Prior to ascending to the Governorship, Bolin was the longest serving Secretary of State of Arizona, serving 28 years from 1949 until he succeeded to the governorship in 1977 following the resignation of his predecessor.

==Life and death==

Harvey Wesley Bolin was born on a farm near Butler, Missouri, a son of Doc Strother Bolin (1878–1946) and Margaret (Combs) Bolin (1885–1966). His family moved to Arizona when he was six, and Bolin was raised and educated in Phoenix. He attended Isaac Elementary School, graduated from Phoenix Union High School, and attended Phoenix College. Bolin became active in the dry cleaning business and completed an LL.B. degree from La Salle Extension University.

Active in politics as a Democrat, Bolin was elected constable of West Phoenix Precinct in 1938. From 1943 until 1948, he was the West Phoenix Precinct&#x27;s justice of the peace. While serving as a justice, Bolin was one of the organizers of the Arizona Justices of the Peace and Constables Association.

Bolin served as Arizona&#x27;s secretary of state for a total of 28 years, 9 months, 17 days (or 10,518 days), and remains the longest-serving secretary of state in Arizona history. He was first elected to the state&#x27;s second highest-post in 1948 and was re-elected every two years between 1950 and 1968, when executive offices had two-year terms, and twice more in 1970 and 1974, when four-year terms began. Only in his last three runs did he encounter significant challenges, culminating in him almost losing his thirteenth campaign in 1974.

He succeeded to the governorship in October 1977 after the previous governor, Raúl H. Castro, was named ambassador to Argentina by President Jimmy Carter. Under the Arizona Constitution, the secretary of state, if he or she was elected to that position, is first in line to fill a vacancy in the governorship. Bolin was the second secretary of state to succeed to the Arizona governorship, after Dan Edward Garvey in 1948. In 1977, the State Bar of Arizona presented Bolin its first Liberty Bell Award in recognition of his responsibility as keeper of the laws.

Bolin died at home of a heart attack on March 4, 1978. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered at multiple sites, one in each of Arizona&#x27;s 14 counties.

After Bolin&#x27;s death, Bruce Babbitt succeeded to the governorship. Rose Mofford had been appointed by Bolin to finish his term as secretary of state, but was ineligible to succeed him as governor because she had not been elected to her office. Babbitt, then serving as state Attorney General, was next in the line of succession and had been elected to his post. He finished the remaining nine months of the term, then was elected to two terms as governor in his own right.

The Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza near the capitol in Phoenix, Arizona, was named after him, and has been designated as a Phoenix Point of Pride.

<text>Josep Caixal i Estradé (1803–1879) was Bishop of Urgell from 1853 until his death in Rome in 1879 and co-prince of Andorra during the New Reform period.

He studied at Tarragona, where he taught the Holy Scriptures, and obtained a canonry (1831). He was professor of philosophy at the University of Cervera. During the First Carlist War, he was exiled to Montauban-de-Luchon.

On 30 November 1851 he was named as the successor of Simó de Guardiola as bishop of Urgell. In 1853 he became the bishop of Urgell and therefore co-prince of Andorra. In that time he was considered a very conservative catholic. In 1855 he had to defend himself against a charge of conspiracy made by the governor of Catalonia. In 1867 he protested in Madrid against the confiscation of goods of the Church and the abusive use of it by the Spanish government.

He attended the First Vatican Council during 1869-1870 (Vaticanum I), where he participated in the drafting of the structure of faith, and in discussions on the infallibility of the Pope, and the composition of the Church, as well as other issues of disciplinary nature.

Ideologically a Carlist, driven by a strong and energetic spirit, he clashed seriously with the liberal authorities. During the reign of Amadeo I, he represented the ecclesiastical province of Tarragona (1870-1872) in the Senate and became well known for his defense of Catholic unity in Spain.

Once the Republic was proclaimed (1873), he moved to Andorra, and from there to Navarre, in order to serve in the field as vicar general to the Carlists who had taken arms. When they later occupied the Seu d&#x27;Urgell (1874), the Bishop Caixal returned to the city to join in its defence until his imprisonment in Alacant (1875), under the victorious occupiers led by Martínez de Campos.

He afterwards travelled to Rome, but thereafter the Spanish government denied him permission to return to Spain. Pope Pius IX gave him the title of honorary Roman, and he became an aide to the Pontifical Throne. He died in Rome and was buried at the Seu d&#x27;Urgell.

<text>The New Jersey Pine Barrens, also known as the Pinelands or simply the Pines, is the largest remaining example of the Atlantic coastal pine barrens ecosystem, stretching across more than seven counties of New Jersey. Two other large, contiguous examples of this ecosystem remain in the northeastern United States: the Long Island Central Pine Barrens and the Massachusetts Coastal Pine Barrens. The name pine barrens refers to the area&#x27;s sandy, acidic, nutrient-poor soil. Although European settlers could not cultivate their familiar crops there, the unique ecology of the Pine Barrens supports a diverse spectrum of plant life, including orchids and carnivorous plants. The area is also notable for its populations of rare pygmy pitch pines and other plant species that depend on the frequent fires of the Pine Barrens to reproduce. The sand that composes much of the area&#x27;s soil is referred to by the locals as sugar sand.

The Pine Barrens remains mostly rural and undisturbed despite its proximity to the sprawling metropolitan cities of Philadelphia and New York City, in the center of the very densely populated Boston-Washington Corridor on the Eastern Seaboard. The heavily traveled Garden State Parkway and Atlantic City Expressway traverse sections of the eastern and southern Pine Barrens, respectively. The Pine Barrens territory helps recharge the Kirkwood–Cohansey aquifer, containing some of the purest water in the United States. 

As a result of all these factors, in 1978, Congress passed legislation to designate of the Pine Barrens as the Pinelands National Reserve (the nation&#x27;s first National Reserve) to preserve its ecology. A decade later, it was designated by the United Nations as an International Biosphere Reserve. Development in the Pinelands National Reserve is strictly controlled by an independent state/federal agency, the New Jersey Pinelands Commission.

The Pinelands Reserve contains the Wharton, Brendan T. Byrne (formerly Lebanon), Penn, and Bass River state forests. The reserve also includes two National Wild and Scenic Rivers: the Maurice and the Great Egg Harbor.

John McPhee&#x27;s 1967 book &quot;The Pine Barrens&quot; focuses on the history and ecology of the region.

==History==
===Prehistoric===

Between 170–200 million years ago, the Atlantic coastal plain began to form.

The Barrens formed in the southernmost and newest land area in New Jersey 1.8 to 65 million years ago, during the Tertiary era.

Over millions of years, the rising and falling of the coastline deposited minerals underground, culminating with the end of the last ice age about 12,000 years ago, when plants and trees began growing in what is now New Jersey.

Forest fires have been a common occurrence since before habitation by humans. Fire has played a major ecological role in the Pinelands, and the ecotypes &quot;suggest that short fire intervals may have been typical in the Pine Plains for many centuries, or millennia.&quot;

===Pre-Columbian===
Around 10,000 years ago, the ancestors of the Lenape people first inhabited the Pine Barrens.

The fire regime before European settlement is poorly understood. Scholars know that the Lenape tribes burned the woods in the spring and fall to reduce underbrush and improve plant yields and hunting conditions. The Pine Barrens, with its sandy soil, did not attract a permanent agriculture population (whose main interest would have been to establish permanent boundaries and clear the forests for fields). The area&#x27;s sparse population encouraged a long-lasting attitude that forest fires should be set for local benefit—even on the lands of others. For instance, it was profitable for charcoal burners to set fires deliberately, in order to make the trees useless for any purpose other than charcoal making, then purchase the trees for a discount.

===European settlement===
During the 17th century, the area that is now New Jersey was explored and settled by the Swedish and Dutch, who developed whaling and fishing settlements mainly along the Delaware River. The English claimed the area as of 1606 under their London Company, and the Dutch abandoned their claim to the English in 1664. The first shipbuilding operations began in the Pine Barrens in 1688, utilizing the cedar, oak, and pitch trees, as well as local tar and turpentine. The first sawmills and gristmills opened around 1700, leading to the first European settlements in the Pinelands.

During the colonial era, the Pine Barrens was the location of various industries. In 1740, charcoal operations began in the Pine Barrens, and the first iron furnace opened in 1765. Bog iron was mined from bogs, streams, and waterways, and was worked in about 35 furnaces including Batsto, Lake Atsion, Hampton Furnace in Shamong, Hanover Furnace in Pemberton, Ferrago in Lacey, and several other locations. Iron from these early furnaces was instrumental in supplying the American military with weapons and camp tools during the American Revolution, the War of 1812, and the Second Barbary War. For example, Commodore Stephen Decatur Jr. sailed to Algiers armed with 24-pound cannons that had been cast at Hanover in 1814.

The first Indian reservation in the Americas was founded Brotherton in 1758, in what is now Indian Mills in Shamong Township. On October 6, 1778 during the American Revolutionary War, 400 British troops under Patrick Ferguson fought an American force under Casimir Pulaski at the Battle of Chestnut Neck before burning several local buildings. In 1799, the first glassworks opened in Port Elizabeth, and by that time, whaling operations had stopped. The first cotton mill in the Pine Barrens opened in 1810 at Retreat. Cultivated cranberry bogs begin in the 1830s, and in 1832, the first paper mill opened in the region. In 1854, the first railroad across the Pinelands opened, connecting Camden and the newly-established Atlantic City. Railroads soon connected the various small towns that existed across the Pine Barrens.

In 1869, the bog iron industry ended in the Pine Barrens, after the discovery that iron ore could be mined more cheaply in Pennsylvania. Other industries such as paper mills, sawmills, and gristmills rose and fell throughout the years, catering chiefly to local markets. Smaller industries such as charcoal-making and glassmaking also were developed, meeting with varying degrees of success. Over time, however, the forest reclaimed almost all traces of the Pine Barrens&#x27; industrial past. Ghost towns—remnants of villages built around these former industries—can still be found at various locations. Batsto Village has been restored to its mid-19th century state as a state historic site.

===The Kallikak study===
The Pine Barrens were home to many rural, backwoods families. For years, residents of the rural area were called &quot;Pineys&quot; by outsiders, as a derogatory term. Today many Pinelands residents are proud of both the name and the land on which they live. In the early 20th century, a family identified in a case study by the pseudonym, the Kallikaks, were presented as an example of genetic inferiority by eugenicists. Today, scholars understand that the facts in the Kallikaks study were misrepresented, including photographs altered to make the family members appear more backward.

===Aviation accidents===
On July 12, 1928, the Mexican aviator and national hero Emilio Carranza crashed and was killed in Tabernacle, New Jersey, while returning from a historic goodwill flight from Mexico City to the United States. Flying back from Long Island, he encountered a thunderstorm and crashed in Burlington County. A 12 ft (3.6 m) monument identifies the location of the crash.

===Efforts to preserve the Pine Barrens===

Despite rapid urbanization of surrounding areas, the Pine Barrens remained largely untouched because its sandy soil was unsuitable for growing most crops. Its iron and charcoal deposits did not compete with more readily accessible deposits elsewhere. In 1969, the Pine Barrens averaged a density of , compared with in the lands bordering it. With rising environmental concerns at the time, people became alerted to the possible destruction of the Pine Barrens and its aquifer by urban sprawl.

State authorities in the region discussed plans to construct a jetport and associated city in the Pine Barrens to alleviate congestion at other major regional airports of the Mid-Atlantic. The low cost of land and lower incidence of fog in the area made the plan appealing.

Congress created the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve, the country&#x27;s first National Reserve, to protect the area under the National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978.

The surviving Medford office of Dr. James Still, the 19th century &quot;Black Doctor of the Pines&quot;, was purchased for preservation by the State of New Jersey in 2006. Today it is the Dr. James Still Historic Office Site and Education Center.

The reserve contains Wharton State Forest, Brendan T. Byrne State Forest, Bass River State Forest, and Penn State Forest. The Pinelands was designated a U.S. Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 1983 and an International Biosphere Reserve in 1988.

Howard P. Boyd was instrumental in working to preserve the Pine Barrens and educate visitors. He died in December 2011, within the Protection Area of the Pinelands National Reserve.

===Jersey Devil and other folklore===

The Pine Barrens gave rise to the legend of the Jersey Devil, said to have been born in 1735 to a local woman named Mrs. Leeds in an area known as Leeds Point. It was said that he was her 13th child and, because of the unlucky number, he was cursed. Another story says that the mother gave birth to a hideous monster that attacked her and her nurses, before flying up and out of the chimney and disappearing into the Barrens. The Devil is said to roam the Pine Barrens, with many sharing stories of encounters with the Devil during dark nights in the Pinelands. 

Pine Barrens folklore also includes the ghost of the &quot;Black Doctor&quot;, the ghost of Captain Kidd, the &quot;Black Dog&quot;, and various other ghosts, as well as folklore associated with the Blue Hole and other so-called &quot;blue holes&quot; in the Pine Barrens.

==Geography==
The New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve contains approximately of land, and occupies 22% of New Jersey&#x27;s land area, including territory of much of seven counties. Counties affected by the act are Atlantic, Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester and Ocean.
The Pine Barrens comprise a major part of the Atlantic coastal pine barrens ecoregion.
Although natural fires have occurred, evidence shows that most fires in the region are of human origin.

==Climate==

The Pine Barrens of New Jersey are in the transition zone between humid subtropical and humid continental climates. The Pine Barrens, however, have a microclimate that allows for a shorter frost-free season, and colder nighttime temperatures compared to most of New Jersey. Because of sandy soil and very little development, clear and calm nights can get much colder in the Pine Barrens than in the surrounding areas. On an average night, a difference is commonly seen, but the change can be as much as .

The Pine Barrens receives annual snowfall, varying from throughout the Pinelands (the northern pinelands receive the most snowfall, on average). Summers are typically hot and humid, and winters are typically cold, and fall/spring are milder transition seasons. Frost can be seen in fall, spring, and winter. In the Pine Barrens, frost occurs earlier in the fall and later in the spring than the surrounding areas due to the sandy soil.

The average annual precipitation in the Pinelands is from , but year-to-year precipitation varies greatly. Thunderstorms are frequent in the warmer months, along with strong winds and heavy rains from these storms.

==Flora==

The Pine Barrens is home to at least 850 species of plants, of which 92 are considered threatened and endangered. Several species of orchids, including the pink lady&#x27;s slipper, are native to the Pine Barrens. The region hosts more than 20 species of wild berries, including wild raisin, red chokeberry, highbush blueberry, huckleberry, bearberry, and cranberry.

The forest communities are strongly influenced by fire, varying from dwarf pine forests less than tall where fires are frequent, to pine forests, to oak forests where fires are rare. Dark swamps of Atlantic white cedar grow along the waterways.

Forest fires play an important role in regulating the growth of plants in the Pine Barrens. Frequent light fires tend to reduce the amount of undergrowth and promote the growth of mature trees. Forest fires have contributed to the dominance of pitch pine in the Pine Barrens. They can resist and recover quickly from fire by resprouting directly through their bark (something very unusual for pines) and frequent killing fires keep an area covered with small sprouts. Their serotinous pine cones open only after having been heated by a fire. 

The prevalence of forest fire allows the pitch pines to dominate over oaks, which by comparison are usually killed outright by a moderate or intense fire. High air temperatures and dry plant undergrowth contribute to the intensity of the fire. While uncommon, severe fires at fairly frequent intervals can eliminate species that do not bear seed at an early age. 

Efforts to battle forest fire attract debate over how to best preserve the Pine Barrens. While fires constitute a danger to property and inhabitants, preservationists argue that eliminating forest fires would cause the Pine Barrens to become dominated by oak trees. A few areas which had previously consisted of scrub and pitch pine have become dominated by oak trees because of intervention after settlement to reduce the frequency of forest fires.

==Fauna==
The Pine Barrens is home to at least 39 species of mammals, over 300 species of birds, 59 reptile and amphibian species, and 91 fish species. At least 43 species are considered threatened and endangered by the NJ Division of Fish and Wildlife, including the rare eastern timber rattlesnakes (&quot;Crotalus horridus&quot;) and bald eagles.

A threatened species of frog, the Pine Barrens tree frog, has a disjunct population there. American black bears are finding their way back into the Pine Barrens after a history of hunting and trapping had driven them out.

Believed to have been extirpated from the state by 1970 due to destruction of its territory and human encroachment, the bobcat gained legal protection in 1972. It is classified as a game species with a closed season; in 1991 it was added to the list of endangered species in New Jersey. Between 1978 and 1982, the state introduced 24 bobcats from Maine into the northern portion of the state. Since 1996, they have been monitored by biologists with the aid of GPS transmitters in order to determine habitat ranges and preferences.

A scent-post survey in 1995 proved bobcat presence in four northern counties. There have been reliable sightings of the bobcat in nine additional (mostly southern) counties, including those encompassing large swathes of the Pine Barrens and others skirting it, namely: Atlantic, Burlington, Cape May, Cumberland, Ocean, and Salem counties.

==Economy==
Industries in the Pine Barrens are primarily related to agriculture and tourism.

===Agriculture===
New Jersey produces the third-highest number of cranberries in the country, mostly cultivated in the areas around Chatsworth, including Whitesbog. The first cultivated blueberries were developed in the Pine Barrens in 1916 through the work of Elizabeth White of Whitesbog, and blueberry farms are nearly as common as cranberry bogs in the area. Most blueberry farms are found in and around the town of Hammonton.

== In popular culture ==
*The Pine Barrens is the setting and title of an episode of the TV program &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. Despite the name, the episode was not filmed in either the New Jersey Pine Barrens nor one of the other, smaller pine barrens in the Northeast. Filming took place within Harriman State Park in New York because the production was denied a permit to film at the South Mountain Reservation in Essex County, though that reserve is also not within the New Jersey Pine Barrens.
*John McPhee&#x27;s book, titled &quot;The Pine Barrens&quot; (1968), explores the history, ecology, and geography of the New Jersey Pine Barrens. His account is also infused with his personal memoirs. His book contributed to a reappraisal of the ecological role of pine barrens; in New Jersey and on eastern Long Island, they contribute to preserving the amount and quality of vital groundwater supplies in underground aquifers. 
*In the &quot;What We Do In The Shadows&quot; episode &quot;Pine Barrens&quot;, the characters go on a hunting trip in the Pine Barrens and encounter the Jersey Devil.
*&quot;The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest&quot; episode &quot;The Spectre of the Pine Barrens&quot; takes place in the New Jersey Pine Barrens, wherein the characters search for the Jersey Devil.
*The Fantastic Four visit the Barrens during a 2004 story arc. The group meets a population of aliens who have been visiting the Barrens for generations, giving rise to the legend of the Jersey Devil.
*The Pine Barrens is also the setting for the 2012 feature &quot;The Barrens&quot;, starring Stephen Moyer, and involving a story of the Jersey Devil.
*The New Jersey Pine Barrens is the setting of Aurelio Voltaire&#x27;s 2013 horror novel &quot;Call of the Jersey Devil&quot;.

<text>Nicolás Remigio Aurelio Avellaneda Silva (3 October 1837 – 24 November 1885) was an Argentine politician and journalist, and President of Argentina from 1874 to 1880. Avellaneda&#x27;s main projects while in office were banking and education reform, leading to Argentina&#x27;s economic growth. The most important events of his government were the Conquest of the Desert and the transformation of the Buenos Aires into a federal district.

His grandson was José Domingo Molina Gómez, who took presidency when Juan Perón was captured.

==Biography==
Born in San Miguel de Tucumán, his mother moved with him to Bolivia after the death of his father, Marco Avellaneda, during a revolt against Juan Manuel de Rosas. He studied law at Córdoba, without graduating. Back at Tucumán he founded &quot;El Eco del Norte&quot;, and moved to Buenos Aires in 1857, becoming director of the &quot;El Nacional&quot; and editor of &quot;El Comercio de la Plata&quot;. He finished his studies at Buenos Aires, meeting Domingo Faustino Sarmiento. Sarmiento helped him to become teacher of economy at the University of Buenos Aires. He wrote &quot;Estudio sobre las leyes de tierras públicas&quot; (), proposing to give the lands to producers that make production from them. This system, similar to the one employed at the United States, suggested to reduce bureaucracy and pointed that this would allow stable populations and population growth.

He was a member of the house of representatives in 1859 and Minister of Government of Adolfo Alsina in the Buenos Aires province in 1866. During Domingo Faustino Sarmiento&#x27;s presidency, he was Minister of Justice and Education. He implemented the educational reform that was defining of his government.

Avellaneda attained the presidency in 1874 but had its legitimacy contested by Bartolomé Mitre and supported by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento. Mitre deployed the army against Avellaneda but was defeated by Julio Argentino Roca. Mitre was held prisoner and judged by military justice, but Avellaneda indulged him in order to promote pacification. He also included Rufino de Elizalde and José María Gutiérrez, supporters of Mitre, as members of his cabinet.

In line with people like Alberdi or Sarmiento, who thought that European immigration was crucial to the Argentine development, he promoted the &quot;Avellaneda law&quot; that allowed European farmers ease to get terrains. The immigration numbers were doubled in a few years.

Having won the revolution and bringing peace to the country, Avellaneda faced a serious economic crisis, centering his efforts on the control of the land with the Conquest of the Desert and expanding the railroads, the cereal and meat exports, and the European immigration, specially to Patagonia. During his presidency, the economy of Argentina was seriously affected by the European crisis putting the country on the edge of debt default. Deciding to take Argentina from its debts, he said that &quot;[...]there are two million Argentines who would economize even to their hunger and thirst to fulfill the promises of our public commitments in the foreign markets&quot;. He reduced the budget and applied a weak protectionism. The crisis was eventually fixed with the growing exports of refrigerated meat to Europe, a new developing industrial method of the time.
A prolific writer, his works have been published in 12 volumes.

Aged 37, he was the youngest Argentine president ever elected. He had served in the Argentine Senate for five months in 1874 and returned to the Senate in 1883 until his death. He died at the age of 48 on a ship returning from medical treatment in France. He is the shortest-lived President of Argentina.

<text>The Jim Henson Hour is an American television series that aired on NBC in 1989. It was developed as a showcase for The Jim Henson Company&#x27;s various puppet creations, including the Muppet characters.

Nine of the twelve episodes produced aired on NBC before the program was canceled due to low ratings. Two episodes later aired on Nickelodeon in 1992 and 1993, and the final episode &quot;Food&quot; never aired in the United States, but was broadcast in the UK. After &quot;The Jim Henson Hour&quot;, the Muppets did not have another prime-time TV show until &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot; (1996–98), six years after Jim Henson&#x27;s death.

==Format==
&quot;The Jim Henson Hour&quot; was modeled after the &quot;Walt Disney Presents&quot; specials, in which every week Disney would show off the latest innovations and creations of his production company. At the beginning of each episode, Jim Henson would enter an abstractly-decorated set (alongside the Thought Lion from his series &quot;The StoryTeller&quot;) and introduce the evening&#x27;s show. Beyond that, the series never had a set structure. The room where Henson and the Thought Lion performed their introduction was a computer-generated environment.

Three of the twelve installments were hour-long mini-movies:

* The faux film noir &quot;Dog City&quot;, narrated by Muppet Rowlf the Dog
* &quot;Monster Maker&quot;, in which an alienated teenager begins secretly working at a special-effects company
* &quot;Living with Dinosaurs&quot;, in which a young boy&#x27;s stuffed Dinosaur comes to life and helps him deal with a troubled family life.

Other shows like &quot;Secrets of the Muppets&quot; went behind the scenes at Henson studios, showing how the Muppets are built and operated.

Ordinarily, however, the hour was split into two thirty-minute segments. These shows would always start with a modernized variation of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, titled &quot;MuppeTelevision&quot;. That would often lead into more serious and sometimes darker content, such as a rerun of &quot;The StoryTeller&quot;. Occasionally, a light-hearted story or more Muppet situations would close out the hour in the second half.

The first episode produced —&quot;Sesame Street… 20 Years &amp; Still Counting&quot;— was aired as a stand-alone special. Henson&#x27;s series officially premiered a week later.

===&quot;MuppeTelevision&quot;===
&quot;MuppeTelevision&quot; regularly occupied the first half of &quot;The Jim Henson Hour&quot;. It was an updated version of the classic series &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, the new twist being that the Muppets were now running an entire cable television network rather than a single variety show. The Muppets broadcast their network&#x27;s programming from a unique control room called &quot;Muppet Central&quot;. Regulars included previous characters Kermit the Frog, Gonzo, and Link Hogthrob in addition to new characters Digit, Leon the Lizard, Lindbergh the Kiwi, Vicki, Clifford, Jacques Roach, and a computer-generated Muppet named Waldo C. Graphic. Waldo was created through a collaboration between Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop and Pacific Data Images. Also appearing as a series regular was Bean Bunny, who had previously starred in the television special &quot;The Tale of the Bunny Picnic&quot; (1986). After &quot;The Jim Henson Hour&quot; ended, Waldo would go on to have a main role in the theme park film &quot;Muppet*Vision 3D&quot; (1991), and Clifford and Bean Bunny would continue to make appearances in various Muppet productions.

Muppet characters Fozzie Bear and Miss Piggy appeared intermittently on the series, due to scheduling conflicts with performer Frank Oz&#x27;s directing career. Miss Piggy received her own thirty-minute special for one episode, in &quot;Miss Piggy&#x27;s Hollywood&quot; she and Gonzo attempt to interview unwilling celebrities.

The house band for MuppeTelevision was called Solid Foam, taking the place of the Electric Mayhem band that had appeared in most previous Muppet projects. The band members included, Digit on keyboard, Flash on saxophone and vocals, Clifford on bass guitar and vocals, Beard on guitar and vocals and an unnamed female drummer.

Electric Mayhem regulars Zoot and Animal eventually made appearances with Solid Foam in the episode &quot;Food.&quot; Dr. Teeth also appeared in the background of a few of Solid Foam&#x27;s music videos.

MuppeTelevision would get interrupted on some occasions by an illegal TV station called &quot;Gorilla Television&quot; run by new characters Ubu, Chip, and Zondra. After &quot;The Jim Henson Hour&quot; ended, Chip would go on to make minor appearances in various Muppet productions.

As with &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; formula, every episode had a celebrity guest star: Louie Anderson, Ted Danson, Smokey Robinson, Buster Poindexter, and k.d. lang appeared on the series.

==Cancellation and &quot;lost&quot; episodes==
The show frequently acknowledged its own low ratings, with segments offering satirical takes on what viewers would rather watch—violent movies, ridiculous stunts, etc. In the end, the show produced twelve episodes, three of which did not make it to air before cancellation.

In 1992, children&#x27;s cable network Nickelodeon aired &quot;Secrets of the Muppets&quot;, one of the lost episodes. They followed with the previously unaired &quot;Living with Dinosaurs&quot; segment, as a standalone special in 1993. The Jim Henson and Muppets segments in that episode have never aired. The final hour, consisting of the MuppeTelevision installment &quot;Food&quot; and &quot;The StoryTeller&quot; episode &quot;The Three Ravens&quot;, has never aired, though &quot;The Three Ravens&quot; segment has aired in the UK as part of &quot;The StoryTeller&quot; series.

In Canada, the &quot;MuppeTelevision&quot; segments have run as a separate series called &quot;The Jim Henson Show&quot;. All of the feature drama segments, except for &quot;Miss Piggy&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;, have been run as standalone specials in the US and other countries, and have been released on home video. &quot;The StoryTeller&quot; segments have run with that series.

===Unused episode ideas===
In addition to the abandoned hour-long episodes of &quot;The StoryTeller&quot;, Lead-Free TV and picture-book specials, Jim Henson had many ideas for potential episodes or features that were never produced. These ideas included: &quot;The Saga of Fraggle Rock&quot; (a &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; origin story), &quot;Inside John&quot; (a variation on Henson&#x27;s Limbo concept in which the various parts of a seventeen-year-old boy&#x27;s brain try to wrest control of him throughout a typical day) and &quot;ASTRO G.N.E.W.T.S.&quot; (a special that would have blended puppets with animation, computer graphics, and video effects). Other stories were proposed by Henson involving enchanted bowling balls, extraterrestrial mailmen, outer-space adventures, and a detective story with Kermit and the other Muppets. Henson also considered adapting Madeleine L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; and the works of A. A. Milne. Also proposed was &quot;an hour-long musical special featuring The Electric Mayhem in Mexico&quot;.

==Ownership==
After the sale of The Muppets and &quot;Bear in the Big Blue House&quot; to The Walt Disney Company in 2004, the rights to various portions of the show have been split between Disney and The Jim Henson Company. The Walt Disney Company owns all of the MuppeTelevision segments (including the 15-minute episode shown with &quot;Dog City&quot;), &quot;Miss Piggy&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;, and &quot;The Secrets of the Muppets&quot;, while The Jim Henson Company retains ownership of the rest of the series.

<text>Thomas Edward Campbell (January 18, 1878 – March 1, 1944) was the second governor of the state of Arizona, United States. He was the first Republican and first native-born governor elected after Arizona achieved statehood in 1912.

In 1917, he was declared the governor of Arizona in a disputed gubernatorial election but the decision was later overturned by the courts, who awarded the election to George W. P. Hunt. Campbell ran for governor again and won two terms, serving 1919–1923. He died in 1944. He played instrumental roles in the drafting of Arizona&#x27;s tax and revenue laws and adoption of the Colorado River Compact that allocated water rights among the western states.

==Early years==
Born in 1878 in Prescott, Arizona, to Daniel E. &quot;Dashing Dan&quot; and Eliza (Flynn) Campbell, who came to Fort Whipple, Arizona Territory, in 1873 where Daniel worked until 1887. Campbell was the first graduate of Prescott High School in 1893. Over six feet tall, he was a star athlete on the Prescott football team. He attended St. Mary&#x27;s College of California in Oakland where he studied geology, but did not receive a degree.

In 1898, he became assistant postmaster of Prescott, attempted to enlist in the Spanish–American War (his mother thought him too young and nixed the plan), and soon moved to Jerome, Arizona becoming its assistant postmaster. President Roosevelt appointed him postmaster of Jerome, serving 1902–1906. In June 1900 he married Eleanor Gayle Allen whose father was co-superintendent of the rich United Verde Copper Company, Jerome.

During the 1890s through the 1910s, Tom Campbell also managed mines in Jerome and south of Prescott, none of them proved to be bonanzas. He became a respected mining engineer and mine manager, and, until dedicating himself to a political career, did consultant work across the desert Southwest. Miner Frank Crampton, in his reminiscence &quot;Deep Enough&quot;, provides a rare glimpse of work in small mining operations of the period, including Campbell&#x27;s Big Stick, Copper Belt, and other mine operations.

In 1900, Campbell was elected to the Arizona Territorial Legislature introducing bills to create the separate county of Verde with Jerome as seat, and another mandating an eight-hour workday. Both failed. Campbell was appointed Yavapai County Tax Assessor in 1907 and held that post until 1914 when he was elected Arizona State Tax Commissioner.

==Governor==
During the 1916 election held on November 7, Campbell ran against incumbent George W. P. Hunt who was seeking election to his third term. Initially, Campbell was declared the winner by 30 votes but Hunt refused to vacate the governor&#x27;s office and both men took the oath of office on December 30, 1916.

Hunt filed suit in the Arizona Superior Court on January 25, 1917, and on January 27, the court declared Campbell &quot;de facto&quot; governor. Hunt agreed to turn over the office on January 29, but appealed and on December 22, 1917, the Arizona Supreme Court overturned the lower court ruling. Campbell vacated the office on December 25, but also filed an appeal with the Arizona Supreme Court on January 8, 1917, that was denied.

The most significant events during Campbell&#x27;s year in office were related to the state-wide copper miner&#x27;s strike of 1917 and the resultant clashes between owners’ representatives and miners. Best known, the Bisbee Deportation, &quot;deputies&quot; kidnapped approximately 1,300 striking mine workers, their supporters from the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), and other residents of the town of Bisbee. The workers were loaded onto trains, taken approximately 200 mi (320 km), dumped on the hands of the troops protecting the border at Columbus, New Mexico.

Campbell earlier interceded in Jerome, Globe, and condemned the actions at Bisbee and elsewhere. He was embarrassed by the excessive actions by the striking IWW workers and the mine company response. He visited Bisbee after the incident and condemned both the IWW and deportation

Also during his 1917 tenure, the flag of Arizona was adopted by the legislature without Campbell&#x27;s consent. Campbell never explained his reasons for not signing the bill.

Because of the State Supreme Court election ruling, Gov. Campbell stepped down in December 1916, and immediately began campaigning. He was elected to the governor&#x27;s office in November 1918 and again in 1920. Major issues included the Colorado River Compact and the reform of state taxation ensuring corporations paid their share. In 1922, he lost reelection against perennial candidate George W. P. Hunt.

==Later life==
Governor Campbell went on to become a member of the Republican National Committee and served as president of the United States Civil Service Commission from 1930 to 1933. He died March 1, 1944, of a cerebral hemorrhage while on the grounds of the state capitol in Phoenix and is buried in Prescott.

<doc id="582115" wikidata="Q375634" url="?curid=582115" title="Sinharaja Forest Reserve">
<text>Sinharaja Forest Reserve is a forest reserve and a biodiversity hotspot in Sri Lanka. It is of international significance and has been designated a Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

According to International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Sinharaja is the country&#x27;s last viable area of primary tropical rainforest. Over 60% of the trees are endemic, many of them considered rare. 50% of Sri Lankan&#x27;s endemics species of animals (especially butterfly, amphibians, birds, snakes and fish species). It is home to 95% endemic birds.

The hilly virgin rainforest, part of the Sri Lanka lowland rain forests ecoregion, was saved from the worst of commercial logging by its inaccessibility, and was designated a World Biosphere Reserve in 1978 and a World Heritage Site in 1988.

Because of the dense vegetation, wildlife is not as easily seen as at dry-zone national parks such as Yala. The most common larger mammal is the endemic purple-faced langur.

Birds tend to move in mixed feeding flocks, invariably led by the fearless Sri Lanka drongo and the noisy orange-billed babbler. Of Sri Lanka&#x27;s 26 endemic birds, the 20 rainforest species all occur here, including the elusive red-faced malkoha, green-billed coucal and Sri Lanka blue magpie.

Reptiles include the endemic green pit viper and hump-nosed viper, and there are a large variety of amphibians, especially tree frogs. Invertebrates include the endemic Sri Lankan birdwing butterfly and leeches.

== Etymology ==
Surrounded in dense fog, the dark and mysterious Sinharaja forest is steeped in deep legend and mystery. The word &quot;Sinharaja&quot; means lion- (සිංහ/சிங்கம் &quot;sinha&quot;) king or kingdom (රාජ/ராஜா &quot;raja&quot;), and a popular folk legend has it that a legendary lion lived in this protected forest.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
Sinharaja Forest Reserve covers most of the Kalu Ganga basin and a small part of the northern Gin Ganga. Most of the forest (60%) is contained within the borders of Rathnapura District. The other parts include Galle District with 20% and Kaluthara District with 20%.

=== Natural ===
The rainforest likely formed during the Jurassic period (from 200 million years to 145 million years ago). This forest encompasses an area of 36,000 hectares (88,960 acres/360 km2). The reserve is only from east to west, and a maximum of from north to south, but it is a treasure trove of endemic species, including trees, insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Sinharaja forest vegetation density has been estimated at 240,000 plants per hectare, the most dense rain forest in Asia.

== Human activity ==
The reserve is well-integrated with the local population who live in some dozens of villages dotted along the border. The villages are more in number along the southern border whilst the presence of some large estates along the northern border has resulted in only a few villages there. The locals collect herbal medicine, edible fruits, nuts, mushrooms, other non-timber forest products including bees honey and a sugary sap collected from a local palm species of the genus Caryota. The sap is converted into jaggery, a local brew and vinegar. Local people walk in the forest to collect the above items when they are not busy with their other agricultural pursuits. In addition, the crystal-clear water coming from dozens of streams is the main water source for all people living around the reserve. For generations, local people trekked through the forest from south to north to make their annual pilgrimage to the Adams Peak.

In 2013, UNESCO requested to halt the widening of the ancient road linking Lankagama area to Deniyaya along a 1-km jungle patch inside the protected area after a complaint from the Centre for Environmental and Nature Studies of Sri Lanka. 
The construction was recommenced on August 10, 2020 after prolonged appeals to the Sri Lankan government by the villagers. A group of environmentalists carried out a big social media campaign and asked the Sri Lanka Forest Department, the President, the Ministry of Environment and the Central Environment authority to stop this but the Government of Sri Lanka has decided to go ahead with it to improve the livelihood of poor villagers of the area as it will clear only 0.006% of the total landmass of the forest.

Mr. Martin Wijesinhe was one of the most significant people in Sri Lanka in connection to the Sinharaja. He was the unofficial guardian of the Sinharaja. He has been the protector and caretaker of it since the 1950s till his death in 2021.

<text>The Aubrey–Maturin series is a sequence of nautical historical novels—20 completed and one unfinished—by English author Patrick O&#x27;Brian, set during the Napoleonic Wars and centring on the friendship between Captain Jack Aubrey of the Royal Navy and his ship&#x27;s surgeon Stephen Maturin, a physician, natural philosopher, and intelligence agent. The first novel, &quot;Master and Commander&quot;, was published in 1969 and the last finished novel in 1999. The 21st novel of the series, left unfinished at O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s death in 2000, appeared in print in late 2004. The series received considerable international acclaim, and most of the novels reached &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. These novels comprise the heart of the canon of an author often compared to Jane Austen, C. S. Forester and other British authors central to English literature.

The 2003 film &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot; drew from three books in the series. Russell Crowe played the role of Jack Aubrey, and Paul Bettany that of Stephen Maturin.

==Development==
Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Ocean&quot; (1956) and &quot;The Unknown Shore&quot; (1959) both depict fictional pairs of young men, loosely based on real seamen, who participate in George Anson&#x27;s voyage around the world. In these two novels, O&#x27;Brian began to develop the models for the characters of Aubrey and Maturin as well as the storytelling techniques used in the series.

===Internal chronology===
O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s books were written and published in the same chronological sequence as the events they describe, beginning with &quot;Master and Commander&quot;, set in 1800, and carrying through to the final novel, set in late 1815 after the Battle of Waterloo.

However, they do not strictly follow history. The first six books quickly move through twelve years of the Napoleonic Wars, as established by frequent reference to historical events, with &quot;The Fortune of War&quot; ending on 1 June 1813 with the battle between HMS &quot;Shannon&quot; and USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot;. The series then enters a kind of fantasy-time in which it takes another dozen novels to progress to November 1813. Much of this period is spent at sea, with little or no connection to real-world years, and the events of the novels take up substantially more time than the few months &#x27;available&#x27;. External historical reference returns with &quot;The Yellow Admiral&quot;, the 18th book in the series. Towards the beginning of this novel, it is stated that the British army under the Duke of Wellington has entered France from Spain, which occurred in November 1813. Time is then paused again for a few chapters, as a narrative apparently lasting several months ensues before a specific arrival at Christmas 1813. Thereafter, the book and the next in the series (&quot;The Hundred Days&quot;) move swiftly through the historical events of Napoleon&#x27;s disastrous invasion of Russia and his defeat in the War of the Sixth Coalition, his exile and escape from Elba, and his final campaign and defeat in June 1815. The last completed book in the series, &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot;, is the only volume which is set entirely after the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars.

In his introduction to &quot;The Far Side of the World&quot;, the 10th book in the series, O&#x27;Brian wrote that if the author &quot;had known how many books were to follow the first, he would certainly have started the sequence much earlier&quot; in real historical time. He goes on to explain that &quot;if his readers will bear with him&quot;, books of the series will be set in &quot;hypothetical years, rather like those hypothetical moons used in the calculation of Easter: an 1812a as it were or even an 1812b&quot;. In effect, the period from June to December 1813 is stretched out to accommodate events that ought to occupy five or six years.

== Characters ==

The series focuses on two main characters, naval officer Jack Aubrey and physician, naturalist, and spy Stephen Maturin, and the ongoing plot is structured around Aubrey&#x27;s ascent from lieutenant to rear admiral in the Royal Navy during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.

Jack Aubrey is a large man (both literally and figuratively) with an energetic, gregarious, cheerful, and relatively simple personality and a deep respect for naval tradition. Remarkable early success earned him the nickname &quot;Lucky Jack Aubrey&quot; and a reputation as a &quot;fighting captain&quot;, a reputation which he sought to retain throughout his career. But while frequently &quot;brilliant&quot; and much respected at sea, he is less competent on land, as indiscreet liaisons, impertinent remarks, and poor financial decisions often bring him trouble. Aubrey&#x27;s professional life of daring exploits and reverses was inspired by the chequered careers of Thomas Cochrane and other notable captains of the Royal Navy from the period.

Irish-Catalan Dr. Stephen Maturin ostensibly serves as an adept ship&#x27;s surgeon on Aubrey&#x27;s various commands. However, unknown to many of his associates, he also serves as a particularly skilled volunteer intelligence agent for the British Admiralty. Maturin is described as a small, quiet, &quot;ugly&quot; man who is known to cast a &quot;dangerous, pale, reptilian eye&quot; towards his enemies. Unlike his action-oriented friend, Maturin is very well-educated with several intellectual pursuits. He is passionately fascinated by the natural world, and takes every opportunity to explore the native wildlife of his ships&#x27; ports of call around the world. He is also deeply introspective, and frequently muses on philosophical concepts of identity and self-understanding in his ciphered personal journal. Another aspect of this complex character is portrayed by his long-lasting and frequently frustrating romantic pursuit of the beautiful but unreliable Diana Villiers. He uses several addictive substances, including laudanum and coca leaves, arising from scientific curiosity, control of his reactions to physical problems, and substance dependence. He has the values of a gentleman of the era, including a strong sense of honour and involvement in duels. The latter led him to develop a strong skill with pistols and duelling by swords.

Maturin&#x27;s various professional roles and personal interests allow the series to leave the sea and explore different aspects of the political and social order during the Napoleonic Era. Eventually, Maturin upstages Aubrey in character development within the series due to the diverse situations in which O&#x27;Brian can place him.

On the surface, the two main characters have little in common. As O&#x27;Brian wrote in &quot;The Ionian Mission&quot;, &quot;Although (they) were almost as unlike as men could be, unlike in nationality, religion, education, size, shape, profession, habit of mind, they were united in a deep love for music, and many and many an evening had they played together, violin answering cello or both singing together far into the night.&quot; This musical connection began in the first paragraph of the first book in the series, when the two characters meet at a concert. They also share a delight in puns and dry witticisms, and particularly memorable wordplay is sometimes repeated in subsequent novels in the series, years later in book-time. One character in the novel, Sir Joseph Blaine, saw the two friends as romantics, in his remarks on Maturin in &quot;HMS Surprise&quot; Chapter 4: &quot;As I was saying, strong; but not without his weaknesses. He was blaming his particular friend for romantic notions the other day – the friend who is to marry the daughter of that woman we saw just now – and if I had not been so shocked by his condition, I should have been tempted to laugh. He is himself a perfect Quixote: an enthusiastic supporter of the Revolution until &#x27;93; a United Irishman until the rising, Lord Edward&#x27;s adviser ... And now Catalan independence. Or perhaps I should say, Catalan independence from the beginning, simultaneously with the others. But always heart and soul, blood and purse in some cause from which he can derive no conceivable personal benefit.&quot;

Despite their many differences, the pair are invaluable and indispensable companions throughout many years of adventure and danger. Reviewers have compared Aubrey and Maturin to other seemingly mismatched yet inseparable fictional duos such as Don Quixote and Sancho Panza in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, Holmes and Watson in the Sherlock Holmes stories, and Kirk and Spock in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; TV series.

==Style==
The stories are primarily told in the third person from the points of view of the two main characters, Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin. The author sometimes employs a form of first-person narrative when his characters write in private journals or letters about events that are not otherwise described. The narrative point of view strays from the two main characters only briefly and seldom over the course of the series. One example is the opening scene of &quot;The Hundred Days&quot;, in which a gossipy conversation between anonymous sailors imparts important news and information about the main characters.

===Period language and naval jargon===
Patrick O&#x27;Brian once wrote, &quot;Obviously, I have lived very much out of the world: I know little of present-day Dublin or London or Paris, even less of post-modernity, post-structuralism, hard rock or rap, and I cannot write with much conviction about the contemporary scene.&quot; This becomes obvious for readers of the Aubrey–Maturin Series, as he adopts a narrative voice contemporary with their setting. Richard Ollard, in examining the general reception to O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s books, suggests that O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s naval officers would be able to talk with and recognise Jane Austen&#x27;s characters.

In addition to the period language, O&#x27;Brian is adept at using naval jargon with little or no translation for the &quot;lubberly&quot; reader. The combination of the historical-voice narration and naval terms may seem daunting at first to some readers; but most note that after a short while a &quot;total immersion&quot; effect results. Occasionally, O&#x27;Brian explains obscure nautical terms by placing Stephen Maturin into the tutelage of seamen, allowing the author to vicariously teach the reader about various parts and functions of a period sailing vessel without breaking from the narrative. This was especially common early in the series, when Maturin was still new to the Royal Navy.

In the first of the series, during a tour of the rigging, Maturin asks his guide if he &quot;could not explain this maze of ropes and wood and canvas without using sea-terms&quot; and receives the reply &quot;No, for it is by those names alone that they are known, in nearly every case&quot;.

Also, O&#x27;Brian often addresses the historical events and themes within his books indirectly, allowing a fuller immersion for his readers without flaunting his historical understanding, unlike other similar nautical authors.

=== Humour ===
O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s bone-dry and cutting wit is present throughout all his novels. Its delivery, whether in the form of narration or dialogue, is often so forthright that the reader may not perceive it at first. At times, however, O&#x27;Brian will spend a considerable portion of a volume setting up comical sequences – for example, Jack&#x27;s use of rum in the &quot;debauchery&quot; of Maturin&#x27;s pet sloth in &quot;HMS Surprise&quot; or Jack&#x27;s assertion to William Babbington, while discussing nautical terminology, that &quot;Sheep ain&#x27;t poetical&quot;, supporting his statement by saying: &quot;Remember that fellow in the play who calls out: &#x27;My Kingdom for a horse&#x27;? Would not have been poetry at all, had he said sheep.&quot; (See &quot;The Ionian Mission&quot;.) Drunk animals are a common motif through the series; for instance the following conversation between Jack and Stephen in &quot;Post Captain&quot;: &quot;&#x27;The carrier has brought you an ape.&#x27; &#x27;What sort of an ape?&#x27; asked Stephen. &#x27;A damned ill-conditioned sort of an ape. It had a can of ale at every pot-house on the road, and is reeling drunk. It has been offering itself to Babbington.&#x27;&quot;

Puns—often &quot;bad&quot; on the part of Jack—are also common throughout the novels, much to the chagrin of Stephen Maturin. Jack takes a special, perhaps overzealous, interest in nautical puns. For example, Jack often repeats one of Stephen&#x27;s spur-of-the-moment puns regarding dog-watches. At a dinner, replying to a lubber&#x27;s question on the term &#x27;dog-watch&#x27; (&quot;Post Captain&quot;, Chapter 12), Stephen suggests it is &quot;because they are curtailed, of course&quot; (&quot;Cur Tailed&quot;, &quot;cur&quot; meaning &quot;dog&quot;), and like other puns, Aubrey repeats the witticism as often as occasion allows. The use of humour contrasts the two central characters. Aubrey is direct and forthright while Stephen is subtle and cunning, mirroring the overall personality of each man, especially regarding warfare tactics (ships, cannons and swords compared to intelligence gathering).

O&#x27;Brian has Aubrey speaking many proverbs, but usually in mangled form, such as &quot;There&#x27;s a great deal to be said for making hay while the iron is hot&quot; (from &quot;Treason&#x27;s Harbour&quot; and similarly in &quot;Desolation Island&quot;). In &quot;HMS Surprise&quot; (Chapter 6), Aubrey says that &quot;A bird in the hand is worth any amount of beating about the bush&quot;. Sometimes Aubrey gets in a muddle and Maturin affectionately mocks him by playing on the mixed metaphor: &#x27;... they have chosen their cake, and must lie in it.&#x27;; Maturin replies, &#x27;You mean, they cannot have their bed and eat it?&#x27; (also from &quot;HMS Surprise&quot;, Chapter 7). Related to proverbs, Aubrey tells Maturin a clever Wellerism, &quot;&#x27;It&#x27;s not a fit night out for man or beast,&#x27; as the centaur observed, ha, ha, ha!&quot; (&quot;Yellow Admiral&quot;).

==Publication history==
&quot;Master and Commander&quot; was first published in 1969, in the US by Lippincott, and in Great Britain and Ireland by Collins in 1970. The series continued to be a modest success in both countries, though publication was only by Collins in the UK after the fourth novel. Publication in the US ceased with &quot;Desolation Island&quot; in 1978. However, in 1989 Starling Lawrence of W. W. Norton discovered the novels on a plane flight between London and New York. W. W. Norton began printing the books, and they were taken more seriously by critics and became a publishing success. O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s series of novels sold over 400,000 copies in the next two years and continued to be a success, selling over 2 million copies by 2000. In its review of the last unfinished novel in 2004, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; reported that the series had sold over 6 million copies. W. W. Norton released the novels in e-book format on 5 December 2011. The full series has been published in German, French and Italian translations, the twenty finished books also in Spanish, and part of the series in Catalan, Chinese, Czech, Finnish, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Swedish and Russian translation.

== Literary significance and criticism ==
O&#x27;Brian is sometimes compared to Jane Austen, C. S. Forester and other British authors central to the English literature canon. Though sometimes compared to Trollope, Melville, Conrad and even Proust, the Aubrey–Maturin series has most often been compared to the works of Jane Austen, one of O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s greatest inspirations in English literature. In a cover story in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; published on 6 January 1991, Richard Snow characterised Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s Aubrey–Maturin naval adventure novels as &quot;the best historical novels ever written. On every page Mr. O&#x27;Brian reminds us with subtle artistry of the most important of all historical lessons: that times change but people don&#x27;t, that the griefs and follies and victories of the men and women who were here before us are in fact the maps of our own lives.&quot; In a &quot;Washington Post&quot; article, Ken Ringle wrote, &quot;... the Aubrey–Maturin series is better thought of as a single multi-volume novel, that, far beyond any episodic chronicle, ebbs and flows with the timeless tide of character and the human heart.&quot;

Frank McNally, writing in honour of the 100th anniversary of the author&#x27;s birth, reflects on the breadth of the appeal of the series of novels, for the quality of the writing and the relationships between the characters, which put them beyond the typical naval adventure, and gain interest from readers who &quot;wouldn&#x27;t touch Horatio Hornblower with a bargepole.&quot; Lucy Eyre wrote to point out the appeal of the series to women readers, mentioning the nautical detail, and how it might be viewed the same as precise medical language on the television program &quot;ER&quot;. She notes that &quot;O&#x27;Brian is never heavy-handed with his research: it&#x27;s simply that the books are set in a perfectly realised world, which happens to be a ship at war.&quot;

When reviewing &quot;The Wine-Dark Sea&quot; in the &quot;Hudson Review&quot;, Gary Krist is very critical of the plot of the books, suggesting that the books are full of elements of &quot;pop fiction&quot; and O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s excessive &quot;delight in the sheer specificity of seafaring mechanics.&quot; However, he did not deny the qualities that &quot;push it close to that great, fuzzy art-entertainment meridian&quot; including character development and at times, &quot;the sense of being in the presence of an active, complex, and compassionate intelligence.&quot;

Numerous authors have admired the Aubrey–Maturin series, including Iris Murdoch, Eudora Welty and Tom Stoppard. Science fiction author David Drake has stated that his Republic of Cinnabar Navy was inspired by the Aubrey–Maturin books.

On 5 November 2019 &quot;BBC News&quot; listed &quot;The Jack Aubrey Novels&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

==Adaptations==
===BBC Radio===
In 1995, &quot;Master and Commander&quot; was dramatised in six parts, with Michael Troughton and Nigel Anthony.

&quot;The Mauritius Command&quot;, &quot;Desolation Island&quot;, &quot;HMS Surprise&quot; and &quot;The Fortune of War&quot; were all subsequently adapted between 2008 and 2018. All starred David Robb as Aubrey and Richard Dillane as Maturin.

===Film===
The Aubrey-Maturin series formed the basis for the 2003 film &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot; directed by Peter Weir and starring Russell Crowe as Aubrey and Paul Bettany as Maturin. The primary plot of the movie is based on that of &quot;The Far Side of the World&quot; (the 10th book of the series) while other events and characters are adapted from other novels in the series.

The film was a critical success and grossed $212 million worldwide but has not yet spawned a sequel despite the sentiments of critics, fans of the movie and the book series, and Crowe himself. However, a prequel was reportedly under development as of 2021.

<text>An antenna tuner, a matchbox, transmatch, antenna tuning unit (ATU), antenna coupler, or feedline coupler is a device connected between a radio transmitter or receiver and its antenna to improve power transfer between them by matching the impedance of the radio to the antenna&#x27;s feedline. Antenna tuners are particularly important for use with transmitters. Transmitters feed power into a resistive load, very often 50 ohms, for which the transmitter is optimally designed for power output, efficiency, and low distortion. If the load seen by the transmitter departs from this design value due to improper tuning of the antenna/feedline combination the power output will change, distortion may occur and the transmitter may overheat. 

ATUs are a standard part of almost all radio transmitters; they may be a circuit included inside the transmitter itself or a separate piece of equipment connected between the transmitter and the antenna. In transmitters in which the antenna is mounted separate from the transmitter and connected to it by a transmission line (feedline), there may be a second ATU (or matching network) at the antenna to match the impedance of the antenna to the transmission line. In low power transmitters with attached antennas, such as cell phones and walkie-talkies, the ATU is fixed to work with the antenna. In high power transmitters like radio stations, the ATU is adjustable to accommodate changes in the antenna or transmitter, and adjusting the ATU to match the transmitter to the antenna is an important procedure done after any changes to these components have been made. This adjustment is done with an instrument called a SWR meter.

In radio receivers ATUs are not so important, because in the low frequency part of the radio spectrum the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is dominated by atmospheric noise. It does not matter if the impedance of the antenna and receiver are mismatched so some of the incoming power from the antenna is reflected and does not reach the receiver, because the signal can be amplified to make up for it. However in high frequency receivers the receiver&#x27;s SNR is dominated by noise in the receiver&#x27;s front end, so it is important that the receiving antenna is impedance-matched to the receiver to give maximum signal amplitude in the front end stages, to overcome noise.

== Overview ==
An antenna&#x27;s impedance is different at different frequencies. An antenna tuner matches a radio with a fixed impedance (typically 50 Ohms for modern transceivers) to the &quot;combination&quot; of the feedline and the antenna; useful when the impedance seen at the input end of the feedline is unknown, complex, or otherwise different from the transceiver. Coupling through an ATU allows the use of one antenna on a broad range of frequencies. However, despite its name, an antenna &quot;&#x27;tuner&quot; &#x27; actually matches the transmitter only to the complex impedance reflected back to the input end of the feedline. If both tuner and transmission line were lossless, tuning at the transmitter end would indeed produce a match at every point in the transmitter-feedline-antenna system. However, in practical systems feedline losses limit the ability of the antenna &#x27;tuner&#x27; to match the antenna or change its resonant frequency.

If the loss of power is very low in the line carrying the transmitter&#x27;s signal into the antenna, a tuner at the transmitter end can produce a worthwhile degree of matching and tuning for the antenna and feedline network as a whole. With lossy feedlines (such as commonly used 50 Ohm coaxial cable) maximum power transfer only occurs if matching is done at both ends of the line.

If there is still a high SWR (multiple reflections) in the feedline beyond the ATU, any loss in the feedline is multiplied several times by the transmitted waves reflecting back and forth between the tuner and the antenna, heating the wire instead of sending out a signal. Even with a matching unit at both ends of the feedline – the near ATU matching the transmitter to the feedline and the remote ATU matching the feedline to the antenna – losses in the circuitry of the two ATUs will reduce power delivered to the antenna. Therefore, operating an antenna far from its design frequency and compensating with a transmatch between the transmitter and the feedline is not as efficient as using a resonant antenna with a matched-impedance feedline, nor as efficient as a matched feedline from the transmitter to a remote antenna tuner attached directly to the antenna.

== Broad band matching methods==
Transformers, autotransformers, and baluns are sometimes incorporated into the design of narrow band antenna tuners and antenna cabling connections. They will all usually have little effect on the resonant frequency of either the antenna or the narrow band transmitter circuits, but can widen the range of impedances that the antenna tuner can match, and/or convert between balanced and unbalanced cabling where needed.

===Ferrite transformers===
Solid-state power amplifiers operating from 1–30 MHz typically use one or more wideband transformers wound on ferrite cores. MOSFETs and bipolar junction transistors are designed to operate into a low impedance, so the transformer primary typically has a single turn, while the 50 Ohm secondary will have 2 to 4 turns. This feedline system design has the advantage of reducing the retuning required when the operating frequency is changed. A similar design can match an antenna to a transmission line; For example, many TV antennas have a 300 Ohm impedance and feed the signal to the TV via a 75 Ohm coaxial line. A small ferrite core transformer makes the broad band impedance transformation. This transformer does not need, nor is it capable of adjustment. For receive-only use in a TV the small SWR variation with frequency is not a major problem.

It should be added that many ferrite based transformers perform a balanced to unbalanced transformation along with the impedance change. When the &quot;bal&quot;anced to &quot;un&quot;balanced function is present these transformers are called a balun (otherwise an unun). The most common baluns have either a 1:1 or a 1:4 &quot;impedance&quot; transformation.

===Autotransformers===
There are several designs for impedance matching using an autotransformer, which is a single-wire transformer with different connection points or &quot;taps&quot; spaced along the windings. They are distinguished mainly by their &quot;impedance&quot; transform ratio (1:1, 1:4, 1:9, etc., the square of the winding ratio), and whether the input and output sides share a common ground, or are matched from a cable that is grounded on one side (unbalanced) to an ungrounded (usually balanced) cable. When autotransformers connect &quot;bal&quot;anced and &quot;un&quot;balanced lines they are called baluns, just as two-winding transformers. When two differently-grounded cables or circuits must be connected but the grounds kept independent, a full, two-winding transformer with the desired ratio is used instead.
The circuit pictured at the right has three identical windings wrapped in the same direction around either an &quot;air&quot; core (for very high frequencies) or ferrite core (for middle, or low frequencies). The three equal windings shown are wired for a common ground shared by two unbalanced lines (so this design is called an unun), and can be used as 1:1, 1:4, or 1:9 impedance match, depending on the tap chosen. (The same windings could be connected differently to make a balun instead.)

For example, if the right-hand side is connected to a resistive load of 10 Ohms, the user can attach a source at any of the three ungrounded terminals on the left side of the autotransformer to get a different impedance. Notice that on the left side, the line with more windings measures greater impedance for the same 10 Ohm load on the right.

==Narrow band design==
The &quot;narrow-band&quot; methods described below cover a very much smaller span of frequencies, by comparison with the broadband methods described above.

Antenna matching methods that use transformers tend to cover a wide range of frequencies. A single, typical, commercially available balun can cover frequencies from 3.5–30.0 MHz, or nearly the entire shortwave radio band. Matching to an antenna using a cut segment of transmission line (described below) is perhaps the most efficient of all matching schemes in terms of electrical power, but typically can only cover a range about 3.5–3.7 MHz wide – a very small range indeed, compared to a broadband balun. Antenna coupling or feedline matching circuits are also narrowband for any single setting, but can be re-tuned more conveniently. However they are perhaps the least efficient in terms of power-loss (aside from having no impedance matching at all!).

===Transmission line antenna tuning methods===

The insertion of a special section of transmission line, whose characteristic impedance differs from that of the main line, can be used to match the main line to the antenna. An inserted line with the proper impedance and connected at the proper location can perform complicated matching effects with very high efficiency, but spans a very limited frequency range.

The simplest example this method is the quarter-wave impedance transformer formed by a section of mismatched transmission line. If a quarter-wavelength of 75 Ohm coaxial cable is linked to a 50 Ohm load, the SWR in the 75 Ohm quarter wavelength of line can be calculated as 75Ω / 50Ω = 1.5; the quarter-wavelength of line transforms the mismatched impedance to 112.5 Ohms (75 Ohms × 1.5 = 112.5 Ohms). Thus this inserted section matches a 112 Ohm antenna to a 50 Ohm main line.

The  wavelength coaxial transformer is a useful way to match 50 to 75 Ohms using the same general method. The theoretical basis is discussion by the inventor, and wider application of the method is found here: Branham, P. (1959). &quot;A Convenient Transformer for matching Co-axial lines&quot;. Geneva: CERN.

A second common method is the use of a stub: A shorted, or open section of line is connected in parallel with the main line. With coax this is done using a &#x27;T&#x27;-connector. The length of the stub and its location can be chosen so as to produce a matched line below the stub, regardless of the complex impedance or SWR of the antenna itself. The J-pole antenna is an example of an antenna with a built-in stub match.

===Basic lumped circuit matching using the L network===

The basic circuit required when lumped capacitances and inductors are used is shown below. This circuit is important in that many automatic antenna tuners use it, and also because more complex circuits can be analyzed as groups of L-networks.

This is called an L network not because it contains an inductor, (in fact some L-networks consist of two capacitors), but because the two components are at right angles to each other, having the shape of a rotated and sometimes reversed English letter &#x27;L&#x27;. The &#x27;T&#x27; (&quot;Tee&quot;) network and the π (&quot;Pi&quot;) network also have a shape similar to the English and Greek letters they are named after.

This basic network is able to act as an impedance transformer. If the output has an impedance consisting of resistance &quot;R&quot;load and reactance &quot;j&quot; &quot;X&quot;load, while the input is to be attached to a source which has an impedance of &quot;R&quot;source resistance and &quot;j&quot; &quot;X&quot;source reactance, then

:formula_1

and

:formula_2.

In this example circuit, &quot;X&quot;L and &quot;X&quot;C can be swapped. All the ATU circuits below create this network, which exists between systems with different impedances.

For instance, if the source has a resistive impedance of 50 Ω and the load has a resistive impedance of 1000 Ω :

:formula_3

:formula_4

If the frequency is 28 MHz,

As, 
:formula_5

then, formula_6

So, formula_7

While as, formula_8

then, formula_9
===Theory and practice===
A parallel network, consisting of a resistive element (1000 Ω) and a reactive element (−&quot;j&quot; 229.415 Ω), will have the same impedance and power factor as a series network consisting of resistive (50 Ω) and reactive elements (−&quot;j&quot; 217.94 Ω).

By adding another element in series (which has a reactive impedance of +&quot;j&quot; 217.94 Ω), the impedance is 50 Ω (resistive).

===Types of L networks and their use===
The L-network can have eight different configurations, six of which are shown here. The two missing configurations are the same as the bottom row, but with the parallel element (wires vertical) on the right side of the series element (wires horizontal), instead of on the left, as shown.

In discussion of the diagrams that follows the in connector comes from the transmitter or &quot;source&quot;; the out connector goes to the antenna or &quot;load&quot;.
The general rule (with some exceptions, described below) is that the series element of an &quot;L&quot;-network goes on the side with the lowest impedance.

So for example, the three circuits in the left column and the two in the bottom row have the series (horizontal) element on the out side are generally used for stepping up from a low-impedance input (transmitter) to a high-impedance output (antenna), similar to the example analyzed in the section above. The top two circuits in the right column, with the series (horizontal) element on the in side, are generally useful for stepping down from a higher input to a lower output impedance.

The general rule only applies to loads that are mainly resistive, with very little reactance. In cases where the load is highly reactive – such as an antenna fed with a signals whose frequency is far away from any resonance – the opposite configuration may be required. If far from resonance, the bottom two step down (high-in to low-out) circuits would instead be used to connect for a step up (low-in to high-out that is mostly reactance).

The low- and high-pass versions of the four circuits shown in the top two rows use only one inductor and one capacitor. Normally, the low-pass would be preferred with a transmitter, in order to attenuate harmonics, but the high-pass configuration may be chosen if the components are more conveniently obtained, or if the radio already contains an internal low-pass filter, or if attenuation of low frequencies is desirable – for example when a local AM station broadcasting on a medium frequency may be overloading a high frequency receiver.

The Low &quot;R&quot;, high &quot;C&quot; circuit is shown feeding a short vertical antenna, such as would be the case for a compact, mobile antenna or otherwise on frequencies below an antenna&#x27;s lowest natural resonant frequency. Here the inherent capacitance of a short, random wire antenna is so high that the L-network is best realized with two inductors, instead of aggravating the problem by using a capacitor.

The Low &quot;R&quot;, high &quot;L&quot; circuit is shown feeding a small loop antenna. Below resonance this type of antenna has so much inductance, that more inductance from adding a coil would make the reactance even worse. Therefore, the L-network is composed of two capacitors.

An L-network is the simplest circuit that will achieve the desired transformation; for any one given antenna and frequency, once a circuit is selected from the eight possible configurations (of which six are shown above) only one set of component values will match the in impedance to the out impedance. In contrast, the circuits described below all have three or more components, and hence have many more choices for inductance and capacitance that will produce an impedance match. The radio operator must experiment, test, and use judgement to choose among the many adjustments that produce the same impedance match.

==Antenna system losses==
===Loss in Antenna tuners===
Every means of impedance match will introduce some power loss. This will vary from a few percent for a transformer with a ferrite core, to 50% or more for a complex ATU that is improperly tuned or working at the limits of its tuning range.

With the narrow band tuners, the L-network has the lowest loss, partly because it has the fewest components, but mainly because it necessarily operates at the lowest formula_10 possible for a given impedance transformation. With the L-network, the loaded formula_10 is not adjustable, but is fixed midway between the source and load impedances. Since most of the loss in practical tuners will be in the coil, choosing either the low-pass or high-pass network may reduce the loss somewhat.

The L-network using only capacitors will have the lowest loss, but this network only works where the load impedance is very inductive, making it a good choice for a small loop antenna. Inductive impedance also occurs with straight-wire antennas used at frequencies slightly above a resonant frequency, where the antenna is too long – for example, between a quarter and a half wave long at the operating frequency. However, problematic straight-wire antennas are typically too short for the frequency in use.

With the high-pass T-network, the loss in the tuner can vary from a few percent – if tuned for lowest loss – to over 50% if the tuner is not properly adjusted. Using the maximum available capacitance will give less loss, than if one simply tunes for a match without regard for the settings. This is because using more capacitance means using fewer inductor turns, and the loss is mainly in the inductor.

With the SPC tuner the losses will be somewhat higher than with the T-network, since the added capacitance across the inductor will shunt some reactive current to ground which must be cancelled by additional current in the inductor. The trade-off is that the effective inductance of the coil is increased, thus allowing operation at lower frequencies than would otherwise be possible.

If additional filtering is desired, the inductor can be deliberately set to larger values, thus providing a partial band pass effect. Either the high-pass T, low-pass π, or the SPC tuner can be adjusted in this manner. The additional attenuation at harmonic frequencies can be increased significantly with only a small percentage of additional loss at the tuned frequency.

When adjusted for minimum loss, the SPC tuner will have better harmonic rejection than the high-pass T due to its internal tank circuit. Either type is capable of good harmonic rejection if a small additional loss is acceptable. The low-pass π has exceptional harmonic attenuation at &quot;any&quot; setting, including the lowest-loss.

===ATU location===
An ATU will be inserted somewhere along the line connecting the radio transmitter or receiver to the antenna. The antenna feedpoint is usually high in the air (for example, a dipole antenna) or far away (for example, an end-fed random wire antenna). A transmission line, or feedline, must carry the signal between the transmitter and the antenna. The ATU can be placed anywhere along the feedline: at the transmitter, at the antenna, or somewhere in between.

Antenna tuning is best done as close to the antenna as possible to minimize loss, increase bandwidth, and reduce voltage and current on the transmission line. Also, when the information being transmitted has frequency components whose wavelength is a significant fraction of the electrical length of the feed line, distortion of the transmitted information will occur if there are standing waves on the line. Analog TV and FM stereo broadcasts are affected in this way. For those modes, matching at the antenna is required.

When possible, an automatic or remotely-controlled tuner in a weather-proof case at or near the antenna is convenient and makes for an efficient system. With such a tuner, it is possible to match a wide range of antennas (including stealth antennas).

When the ATU must be located near the radio for convenient adjustment, any significant SWR will increase the loss in the feedline. For that reason, when using an ATU at the transmitter, low-loss, high-impedance feedline is a great advantage (open-wire line, for example). A short length of low-loss coaxial line is acceptable, but with longer lossy lines the additional loss due to SWR becomes very high.

It is very important to remember that when matching the transmitter to the line, as is done when the ATU is near the transmitter, there is no change in the SWR in the feedline. The backlash currents reflected from the antenna are retro-reflected by the ATU – usually several times between the two – and so are invisible on the transmitter-side of the ATU. The result of the multiple reflections is compounded loss, higher voltage or higher currents, and narrowed bandwidth, none of which can be corrected by the ATU.

=== Standing wave ratio ===

It is a common misconception that a high standing wave ratio (SWR) &quot;per se&quot; causes loss. A well-adjusted ATU feeding an antenna through a low-loss line may have only a small percentage of additional loss compared with an intrinsically matched antenna, even with a high SWR (4:1, for example). An ATU sitting beside the transmitter just re-reflects energy reflected from the antenna (&quot;backlash current&quot;) back yet again along the feedline to the antenna (&quot;retro-reflection&quot;). High losses arise from RF resistance in the feedline and antenna, and those multiple reflections due to high SWR cause feedline losses to be compounded.

Using low-loss, high-impedance feedline with an ATU results in very little loss, even with multiple reflections. However, if the feedline-antenna combination is &#x27;lossy&#x27; then an identical high SWR may lose a considerable fraction of the transmitter&#x27;s power output. High impedance lines – such as most parallel-wire lines – carry power mostly as high voltage rather than high current, and current alone determines the power lost to line resistance. So despite high SWR, very little power is lost in high-impedance line compared low-impedance line – typical coaxial cable, for example. For that reason, radio operators can be more casual about using tuners with high-impedance feedline.

Without an ATU, the SWR from a mismatched antenna and feedline can present an improper load to the transmitter, causing distortion and loss of power or efficiency with heating and/or burning of the output stage components. Modern solid state transmitters will automatically reduce power when high SWR is detected, so some solid-state power stages only produce weak signals if the SWR rises above 1.5 to 1. Were it not for that problem, even the losses from an SWR of 2:1 could be tolerated, since only 11 percent of transmitted power would be reflected and 89 percent sent out through to the antenna. So the main loss of output power with high SWR is due to the transmitter &quot;backing off&quot; its output when challenged with backlash current.

Tube transmitters and amplifiers usually have an adjustable output network that can feed mismatched loads up to perhaps 3:1 SWR without trouble. In effect the built-in π-network of the transmitter output stage acts as an ATU. Further, since tubes are electrically robust (even though mechanically fragile), tube-based circuits can tolerate very high backlash current without damage.

==Broadcast Applications ==

===AM broadcast transmitters ===

One of the oldest applications for antenna tuners is in AM and shortwave broadcasting transmitters. AM transmitters usually use a vertical antenna (tower) which can be from 0.20 to 0.68 wavelengths long. At the base of the tower an ATU is used to match the antenna to the 50 Ohm transmission line from the transmitter. The most commonly used circuit is a T-network, using two series inductors with a shunt capacitor between them. When multiple towers are used the ATU network may also provide for a phase adjustment so that the currents in each tower can be phased relative to the others to produce a desired pattern. These patterns are often required by law to include nulls in directions that could produce interference as well as to increase the signal in the target area. Adjustment of the ATUs in a multitower array is a complex and time consuming process requiring considerable expertise.

=== High-power shortwave transmitters ===
For International Shortwave (50 kW and above), frequent antenna tuning is done as part of frequency changes which may be required on a seasonal or even a daily basis. Modern shortwave transmitters typically include built-in impedance-matching circuitry for SWR up to 2:1 , and can adjust their output impedance within 15 seconds.

The matching networks in transmitters sometimes incorporate a balun or an external one can be installed at the transmitter in order to feed a balanced line. Balanced transmission lines of 300 Ohms or more were more-or-less standard for all shortwave transmitters and antennas in the past, even by amateurs. Most shortwave broadcasters have continued to use high-impedance feeds even before the advent of automatic impedance matching.

The most commonly used shortwave antennas for international broadcasting are the 
HRS antenna (curtain array), which cover a 2 to 1 frequency range and the log-periodic antenna which cover up to 8 to 1 frequency range. Within that range, the SWR will vary, but is usually kept below 1.7 to 1 – within the range of SWR that can be tuned by antenna matching built-into many modern transmitters. Hence, when feeding these antennas, a modern transmitter will be able to tune itself as needed to match at any frequency.

==Automatic antenna tuning==
Automatic antenna tuning is used in flagship mobile phones, transceivers for amateur radio, and in land mobile, marine, and tactical HF radio transceivers.

Each antenna tuning system (AT) shown in the figure has an &quot;antenna port&quot;, which is directly or indirectly coupled to an antenna, and another port, referred to as &quot;radio port&quot; (or as &quot;user port&quot;), for transmitting and / or receiving radio signals through the AT and the antenna. Each AT shown in the figure has a single antenna-port, (SAP) AT, but a multiple antenna-port (MAP) AT may be needed for MIMO radio transmission.

Several control schemes can be used in a radio transceiver or transmitter to automatically adjust an antenna tuner (AT).
The control schemes are based on one of the two configurations, (a) and (b), shown in the diagram. For both configurations, the transmitter comprises:
* antenna
* antenna tuner / matching network (AT)
* sensing unit (SU)
* control unit (CU)
* transmitter and signal processing unit (TSPU)
The TSPU incorporates all the parts of the transmitting not otherwise shown in the diagram.

The TX port of the TSPU delivers a test signal. The SU delivers, to the TSPU, one or more output signals indicating the response to the test signal, one or more electrical variables (such as voltage, current, incident or forward voltage, etc.). The response sensed at the &quot;radio port&quot; in the case of configuration (a) or at the &quot;antenna port&quot; in the case of configuration (b). Note that neither configuration (a) nor (b) is ideal, since the line between the antenna and the AT attenuates SWR; response to a test signal is most accurately tested at or near the antenna feedpoint.

Broydé &amp; Clavelier (2020) distinguish five types of antenna tuner control schemes, as follows:

* Type 0 designates the open-loop AT control schemes that do not use any SU, the adjustment being typically only based on previous knowledge programmed for each operating frequency
* Type 1 and type 2 control schemes use configuration (a)
** type 2 uses extremum-seeking control
** type 1 does not seek an extreme
* Type 3 and type 4 control schemes use configuration (b)
** type 4 uses extremum-seeking control
** type 3 does not seek an extreme

The control schemes may be compared as regards:
* use of closed-loop or open-loop control (or both)
* measurements used
* ability to mitigate the effects of the electromagnetic characteristics of the surroundings
* aim / goal
* accuracy and speed
* dependence on use of a particular model of AT or CU

<text>The BBC World Sport Star of the Year (formerly known as the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year) is an award presented at the annual BBC Sports Personality of the Year award ceremony. The award is presented to a non-British sportsperson considered to have made the most substantial contribution to a sport in that year.

==History==
The Overseas Personality award was first presented in 1960, six years after the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award was introduced. The first recipient of the award was Australian middle distance runner Herb Elliott. Since then, the award has been presented to 53 sportspersons. Swiss tennis player Roger Federer has won the award four times. American boxer Muhammad Ali and Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt have both won the award three times. The award has been shared on three occasions—by Ron Clarke and Gary Player in 1965, Eusébio and Garfield Sobers in 1966, and Evander Holyfield and Michael Johnson in 1996. The husband-and-wife skating duo of Oleg Protopopov and Ludmila Belousova are the only pair to have won the award, doing so in 1968. Belousova was the first woman to become Overseas Personality—she was also the oldest, aged 33. George Moore is the oldest recipient of the award, winning in 1967 aged 44. The youngest recipient of the award is Nadia Comăneci, who won in 1976 at age 15. Boris Becker, who was 18 when he won in 1985, is the youngest male to have won.

Twenty-seven different countries have been represented by the award winners as of 2023. United States sportspersons have won the award the most times, having had nineteen recipients, two of whom shared the award. Three cricketers have received the award -- Garfield Sobers of Barbados, Brian Lara of Trinidad and Tobago (both of whom played for the West Indies cricket team), and Shane Warne of Australia. Fourteen sporting disciplines have been represented; tennis has the highest representation, with fifteen recipients.

Only one winner has ever been stripped of the award – US cyclist Lance Armstrong, whose 2003 award was rescinded following the UCI&#x27;s 2012 decision to strip him of his titles and ban him for life from the sport.

In 2018, the award was renamed BBC World Sport Star of the Year. Along with the change of name, votes could be cast from outside of the UK for the first time.

==Nomination procedure==
The award was decided by a panel of over 30 sporting journalists. Each panellist voted for their top two choices; their first preference was awarded two points, and their second preference was awarded one point. The winning sportsperson had the most total points. In the case of a points tie, the sportsperson chosen as first preference by the most panellists is the winner. If this is also a tie the award is shared. In 2015 the public voted for this award.

<text>Stephen Maturin () is a fictional character in the Aubrey–Maturin series of novels by Patrick O&#x27;Brian. The series portrays his career as a physician, naturalist and spy in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, and the long pursuit of his beloved Diana Villiers.

Maturin was played by Paul Bettany in the 2003 film &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot; and by Nigel Anthony and Richard Dillane in the BBC Radio 4 adaptations of O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s novels. Bettany was nominated for a British Academy Film Award for his performance.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Stephen Maturin, called by his Catalan family Esteban Maturin y Domanova, a Roman Catholic, is the illegitimate son of an Irish officer serving in the Spanish Army and a Catalonian lady. He is cousin to the historical Lord Edward FitzGerald. As a boy he lived in Ireland, fostered by a family of pig-herders in Cahersiveen and County Clare, and spent his teenage years in Catalonia – most notably with his grandmother in Lleida, his uncle in Barcelona and his godfather in Ullastret. He received a largely Benedictine education, focusing on the Classics (he speaks Ancient Greek and Latin fluently, and can recite The Aeneid). He returned to Ireland in his adolescence, and performed premedical studies at Trinity College Dublin, and received further training in Paris, conceding to have &quot;dissected with Dupuytren&quot; while there.

He was in Paris during the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, of which he was at first an ardent supporter. Returning to Ireland he was a member of the United Irishmen. While in Ireland he became engaged to a woman called Mona, who died in unspecified circumstances. He had become disabused of political enthusiasms and was against the 1798 rebellion, in which he refused to take part.

===Naval career===
&quot;Master and Commander&quot;, the first book in the series, opens in 1800. Maturin has travelled to Minorca with a patient who died there, leaving him penniless and stranded. A chance meeting with Jack Aubrey at a musical performance in the governor&#x27;s house at Port Mahon did not go well, as Aubrey was despondent about his seemingly stalled naval career and Maturin was frustrated by his own situation, leading to some harsh words. However, Aubrey received a promotion later that evening and was in a much better mood when he ran across Maturin again the next day, leading to a fast friendship and an offer to be the ship&#x27;s surgeon aboard Aubrey&#x27;s first command, HMS &quot;Sophie&quot;, a fictional brig-rigged sloop-of-war. Being that ships&#x27; surgeons in that era usually received very limited training or advanced education, the officers and crew of the &quot;Sophie&quot; are very pleased to have a true physician on board. Their esteem for Maturin&#x27;s medical skill increases early on when he successfully performs delicate surgery on deck, repairing a crew member&#x27;s serious head injury by removing a damaged portion of his skull and replacing it with a silver coin hammered into a dome by the armourer. The feat is witnessed by most of the crew, and they mention it several times in subsequent books in the series.

As a passionate advocate of Catalan independence and a resolute opponent of Bonaparte&#x27;s tyranny, Maturin had become involved in intelligence gathering, and as he begins his career with the Royal Navy, he becomes a valued volunteer secret agent for the Admiralty. His political and intelligence missions are of such vital importance that Jack Aubrey is often sent to far-flung corners of the world primarily to discreetly allow his apparent ship&#x27;s surgeon to perform a task for the British government. His work put him in some difficult and dangerous situations, particularly when he was captured and tortured in Port Mahon in &quot;HMS Surprise&quot;, the third novel in the series. While being held by French intelligence agents, Maturin was subjected to the rack (among other implements), making him a temporary invalid and permanently damaging his hands. Aubrey leads a cutting-out mission to save his friend, who spends the next few months recuperating. The extent of the torture is revealed slowly across the novels following it.

In 1802, Maturin meets and falls in love with Diana Villiers while he and Aubrey are renting a small estate along with several crewmates during the Peace of Amiens. Diana&#x27;s cousin, Sophia Williams, becomes close friends with Maturin and eventually marries Aubrey. Sophie encourages Diana and (particularly) Stephen to express their feelings towards each other. However, Maturin does not risk a rejection, and Diana leaves on the first of what becomes a series of affairs that take her around the world, leading to a years-long and extremely frustrating pursuit by Maturin. He saves her from her American &quot;protector&quot; in Boston in 1812, killing two French agents in the process. He finally proposes marriage, but Diana is still hesitant. They eventually do marry in 1813 after she trades her most valuable diamond in exchange for his freedom from a French prison. They have a daughter, Brigid, who shows signs of being autistic before seemingly overcoming her issues. Diana dies in a coach accident in 1815 before the opening of &quot;The Hundred Days&quot;. Maturin is despondent, but later strikes up a relationship with fellow naturalist Christine Hatherleigh Wood and proposes marriage relatively quickly. She turns him down because she is disillusioned with marriage due to a poor relationship with her first husband. However, they remain close friends, and she becomes close to the Aubrey family and Maturin&#x27;s daughter Brigid after spending time with them at the Aubrey estate. In the unfinished last novel, their relationship is unresolved.

==Personal characteristics==
Stephen Maturin is described as short, slight, and dark-haired, with &quot;curious&quot; pale blue eyes and pale skin if not exposed to the sun. He does become fairly dark-skinned when he travels to tropical climes, a result of his Hiberno-Spanish heritage and predilection for naked sun-bathing. He weighs &quot;barely 9 stone&quot; (126 pounds, 56 kg). A French spy who saw him in Brazil as a prisoner on the USS &quot;Constitution&quot;, after HMS &quot;Java&quot; rescued them from the tropical seas, wrote that Maturin was &quot;Five foot six, slight build, black hair, pale eyes, muddy complexion, three nails on the right hand torn out, both hands somewhat crippled: speaks perfect French with a southern accent&quot;. (quoted in &quot;The Surgeon&#x27;s Mate&quot; Chapter 11). Maturin is fluent in Catalan, English, French, Irish, Latin and Spanish, and on his travels, he develops a working knowledge of Greek, Malay, Arabic and Urdu. In the 2003 film, he is also briefly shown speaking basic Portuguese. Although a skilled linguist, Maturin never quite grasps naval jargon or the workings of a ship, a narrative ploy which allows the author to provide the reader with technical information by having helpful crewmates explain things to the ship&#x27;s doctor.

Maturin is habitually untidy or even disreputable in appearance; he spends as little as possible on clothes, preferring an &quot;old rusty coat&quot; unless the occasion calls for dressier clothes. As a physician, he often wears an old periwig over his sparse close-cropped hair. His frugal personal habits persist despite a considerable share of prize money earned over the years, and a fortune inherited from his Catalan godfather in &quot;The Reverse of the Medal&quot;. He uses part of his fortune to buy the recently decommissioned HMS &quot;Surprise&quot;, giving its command to Jack Aubrey when he had been framed for stock manipulation and temporarily lost his commission. &quot;Surprise&quot; is employed as a letter of marque, and later as His Majesty&#x27;s Hired Vessel when Aubrey is restored to the Navy List.

As well as his activities as a physician and agent, Maturin is a celebrated natural philosopher in the age of scientific discovery. He is, like Aubrey, a member of the Royal Society. His interests are wide, but he has a particular interest in wildlife, particularly birds and their anatomy. He discovers and names the hitherto unknown species of giant tortoise &quot;Testudo aubreii&quot; on a remote and uninhabited island in the Indian Ocean. An unending frustration for him is to be pulled away from the flora and fauna never before seen by a scientific eye, for the naval mission on which the ship travels. This is most poignant when he and his assistant Martin are promised time to explore and collect samples in the Galapagos Islands, which permission is abruptly rescinded when HMS &quot;Surprise&quot; must sail immediately on information as to where USS &quot;Norfolk&quot; can be found, the target of Aubrey&#x27;s mission in &quot;The Far Side of the World&quot;. He is considered an expert in suprapubic cystostomy (spelled &quot;cystotomy&quot;, without the &quot;s&quot;).

Dr. Maturin is prone to self-medication. While pining over Diana, he becomes addicted to opium in the form of a tincture of laudanum. In &quot;The Letter of Marque&quot; he states his own &quot;moderate dose&quot; is &quot;a thousand drops&quot;, when twenty-five drops is a usual dose for a man in pain; in &quot;Desolation Island&quot; it is implied that he daily takes eighteen thousand drops. Later, he switches to coca leaves, and is a frequent user of khat and tobacco and a devotee of particularly strong coffee with his breakfast.

Maturin is an excellent observer of people, a skill useful in his profession of physician and in his work in naval intelligence. He has a wide network of friends, relatives, fellow students, fellow natural philosophers and, over time, those who work in intelligence. He loves playing and listening to music, and whenever possible, he enjoys duets on cello with Aubrey on violin.

==Film treatment of Maturin==
In reviewing the film made from the series of books, Christopher Hitchens finds &quot;the summa of O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s genius was the invention of Dr. Stephen Maturin. He is the ship&#x27;s gifted surgeon, but he is also a scientist, an espionage agent for the Admiralty, a man of part Irish and part Catalan birth—and a revolutionary. He joins the British side, having earlier fought against it, because of his hatred for Bonaparte&#x27;s betrayal of the principles of 1789—principles that are perfectly obscure to bluff Capt. Jack Aubrey. Any cinematic adaptation of O&#x27;Brian must stand or fall by its success in representing this figure. On this the film doesn&#x27;t even fall, let alone stand. It skips the whole project.&quot; He finds the film&#x27;s action scenes more inspirational: &quot;In one respect the action lives up to its fictional and actual inspiration. This was the age of Bligh and Cook and of voyages of discovery as well as conquest, and when HMS &quot;Surprise&quot; makes landfall in the Galapagos Islands we get a beautifully filmed sequence about how the dawn of scientific enlightenment might have felt.&quot;

<text>Father Hendricks (March 17, 1846, in Venlo – June 22, 1906, in Kashgar) was a Dutch Roman Catholic missionary.
Accompanied by a Polish nobleman called Adam Ignatovich whom he had met in Omsk on his way to Chinese Turkestan, Hendricks arrived in Kashgar in 1885 and remained there until his death. During his stay in Kashgar, Hendricks clashed with Nikolai Petrovsky, the Russian consul-general, and lived for a time with George Macartney at Chini-Bagh. 
Hendricks frequently had to travel to British India, and despite good relations with Macartney, he occasionally had troubles crossing the border. British agent Ralph Cobbold reported that in the late 1890s Hendriks was detained by the British for several weeks at Hunza on the border with Xinjiang. Hendricks ran his church out of a mud hut and was apparently able to only convert one person, a Chinese cobbler, during his time in Kashgar.
Father Hendricks died of throat cancer and was carried to his grave by a Cossack escort.

<doc id="582146" wikidata="Q578685" url="?curid=582146" title="OpenMosix">
<text>openMosix was a free cluster management system that provided single-system image (SSI) capabilities, e.g. automatic work distribution among nodes. It allowed program processes (not threads) to migrate to machines in the node&#x27;s network that would be able to run that process faster (process migration). It was particularly useful for running parallel applications having low to moderate input/output (I/O). It was released as a Linux kernel patch, but was also available on specialized Live CDs. openMosix development has been halted by its developers, but the LinuxPMI project is continuing development of the former openMosix code.

==History==

openMosix was originally forked from MOSIX by Moshe Bar on February 10, 2002 when MOSIX became proprietary software.

openMosix was considered stable on Linux kernel 2.4.x for the x86 architecture, but porting to Linux 2.6 kernel remained in the alpha stage. Support for the 64-bit AMD64 architecture only started with the 2.6 version.

On July 15, 2007, Bar announced that the openMOSIX project would reach its end of life on March 1, 2008, due to the decreasing need for 
single system image (SSI) clustering as low-cost multi-core processors increase in availability.

OpenMosix used to be distributed as a Gentoo Linux kernel choice, but it was removed from Gentoo Linux&#x27;s &quot;Portage tree&quot; in February 2007.

As of March 1, 2008, openMosix read-only source code is still hosted at SourceForge. The OpenPMIx project is continuing development of the former openMosix code.

==ClusterKnoppix==

&quot;ClusterKnoppix&quot; is a specialized Linux distribution based on the Knoppix distribution, but which uses the openMosix kernel.

Traditionally, clustered computing could only be achieved by setting up individual rsh keys, creating NFS shares, editing host files, setting static IPs, and applying kernel patches manually. ClusterKnoppix effectively renders most of this work unnecessary. The distribution contains an autoconfiguration system where new ClusterKnoppix-running computers attached to the network automatically join the cluster.

ClusterKnoppix is a modified Knoppix distro using the OpenMosix kernel.

<doc id="582149" wikidata="Q1940814" url="?curid=582149" title="Hits (Pulp album)">
<text>Hits is a greatest hits collection by the English rock band Pulp, released in November 2002.

==Background==
As a collection, &quot;Hits&quot; only covers Pulp&#x27;s singles from the 1990s when they hit the mainstream, although the band had existed in one form or another since 1978.

&quot;Hits&quot; includes all of Pulp&#x27;s A-sides released from &quot;Babies&quot; in 1992 to &quot;Bad Cover Version&quot; in 2002, with the exception of &quot;Mis-Shapes&quot; from &quot;Different Class&quot;, apparently because, by the time the compilation was released, the band could no longer stand the song. In its place is &quot;Underwear&quot;, an album track from &quot;Different Class&quot;.

The tracklisting is ordered chronologically by release date, with the exception of Pulp&#x27;s last single &quot;Bad Cover Version&quot;, which instead appears between &quot;The Trees&quot; and &quot;Sunrise&quot; (the latter two tracks having originally been released together as a double A-side single).

Two other singles, &quot;Common People&quot; and &quot;Disco 2000&quot;, are presented in their &quot;Different Class&quot; album mixes rather than their more familiar (but since deleted) &quot;hit&quot; single versions.

The first and second singles, &quot;Babies&quot; and &quot;Razzmatazz&quot;, were originally released on Pulp&#x27;s previous record label, Gift Records. The rest of the singles were released after the band signed to Island Records.

The band were contractually obligated to record a new song for inclusion on &quot;Hits&quot;. The resulting song, &quot;Last Day of the Miners&#x27; Strike&quot;, appears as the last track on the album. It contains a sample of &quot;South American Getaway&quot; by Burt Bacharach, and refers to the UK miner&#x27;s strike of 1984–1985.

An accompanying DVD was also released under the same title, featuring the band&#x27;s promotional videos from the same era, a number of live performances, documentaries and short movies.

<text>Salt mining extracts natural salt deposits from underground. The mined salt is usually in the form of halite (commonly known as rock salt), and extracted from evaporite formations.

== History ==

Before the advent of the modern internal combustion engine and earth-moving equipment, mining salt was one of the most expensive and dangerous of operations because of rapid dehydration caused by constant contact with the salt (both in the mine passages and scattered in the air as salt dust) and of other problems caused by accidental excessive sodium intake. Salt is now plentiful, but until the Industrial Revolution, it was difficult to come by, and salt was often mined by slaves or prisoners. Life expectancy for the miners was low.

The earliest found salt mine was in Hallstatt, Austria where salt was mined, starting in 5000BC.

As salt is a necessity of life, pre-industrial governments were usually keen to exercise stringent control over its production, often through direct ownership of the mines. Wheras the collection of most taxes generally required at least the grudging cooperation of the upper classes, ownership of salt mines could provide monarchs with a lucrative source of income for which they did not need to rely on the goodwill of other strata of society such as the nobility to remit to the monarch. For example, Polish king Casimir the Great relied on salt mines for over a third of his revenue in the 14th century.

Ancient China was among the earliest civilizations in the world with cultivation and trade in mined salt. They first discovered natural gas when they excavated rock salt. The Chinese writer, poet, and politician Zhang Hua of the Jin dynasty wrote in his book &quot;Bowuzhi&quot; how people in Zigong, Sichuan, excavated natural gas and used it to boil a rock salt solution. The ancient Chinese gradually mastered and advanced the techniques of producing salt. Salt mining was an arduous task for them, as they faced geographical and technological constraints. Salt was extracted mainly from the sea, and salt works in the coastal areas in late imperial China equated to more than 80 percent of national production. The Chinese made use of natural crystallization of salt lakes and constructed some artificial evaporation basins close to shore. In 1041, during the Song dynasty, a well with a diameter about the size of a bowl and several dozen feet deep was drilled for salt production. In Southwestern China, natural salt deposits were mined with bores that could reach to a depth of more than , but the yields of salt were relatively low. Salt mining played a pivotal role as one of the most important sources of the Imperial Chinese government&#x27;s revenue and state development.

Most modern salt mines are privately operated or operated by large multinational companies such as K+S, AkzoNobel, Cargill, and Compass Minerals. 
== Mining regions around the world ==


Some notable salt mines include:
== Idiomatic use ==
In slang, the term , and especially the phrase , refers ironically to one&#x27;s workplace, or a dull or tedious task. This phrase originates from in reference to the Russian practice of sending prisoners to forced labor in Siberian salt mines.

<doc id="582154" wikidata="Q6431483" url="?curid=582154" title="Korbut flip">
<text>The Korbut flip is a gymnastics skill performed on either of two different apparatus. Both were first performed internationally by the Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut.

The more spectacular version of the skill used to be performed on the uneven bars, where the gymnast, from a stand on the high bar, performs a back flip and regrasps the bar. Korbut performed the move at the 1972 Summer Olympics, where it was the first backward release move performed on the uneven bars in international competition. In 1977, Soviet gymnast Elena Mukhina modified the flip by adding a full twist. The movement was later modified in the 1980s when it was performed towards the low bar; that is, the gymnast&#x27;s flip takes place above the low bar. The Code of Points was later modified to ban standing on the high bar during routines. 

The skill is also performed on the balance beam. The move is performed from a standing position and is landed in a straddled position on the beam. This movement has been modified to include twists and piked or tucked legs and is frequently performed in sequence with other movements. Unlike its counterpart on the uneven bars, the Korbut flip on beam is today considered a relatively simple skill, valued at only a &quot;B&quot; level in the 2017 Code of Points.

Other gymnasts who have performed the skill&#x27;s uneven bars variation include Radka Zemanova (1980), Steffi Kräker (1977), Emily May (1981), Lyubov Bogdanova (1974) and Natalia Shaposhnikova (1976).

<text>Duquesne University of the Holy Spirit ( ; also known as Duquesne University or Duquesne) is a private Catholic research university in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. Founded by members of the Congregation of the Holy Spirit, Duquesne first opened as the Pittsburgh Catholic College of the Holy Ghost in October 1878 with an enrollment of 40 students and a faculty of six. In 1911, the college became the first Catholic university-level institution in Pennsylvania. It is named for an 18th-century governor of New France, Michel-Ange Duquesne de Menneville.

Duquesne has since expanded to over 9,300 graduate and undergraduate students within a self-contained hilltop campus in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Bluff neighborhood. The school maintains an associate campus in Rome and encompasses ten schools of study. The university hosts international students from more than 80 countries although most students—about 80%—are from Pennsylvania or the surrounding region. Duquesne is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;. There are more than 93,000 living alumni of the university ranging from two cardinals and the current bishop of Pittsburgh to a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

The Duquesne Dukes compete in NCAA Division I. Duquesne men&#x27;s basketball appeared twice in national championship games in the 1950s and won the NIT championship in 1955.

== History ==

The Pittsburgh Catholic College of the Holy Ghost was founded on October 1, 1878, by Fr. Joseph Strub and the Holy Ghost Fathers, who had been expelled from Germany during Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; six years earlier. When the college was founded, it had six faculty members and 40 students. The college obtained its state charter in 1882. Students attended classes in a rented space above a bakery on Wylie Avenue in downtown Pittsburgh. Duquesne established itself at its current location on the Bluff and built the original five-story red brick &quot;Old Main&quot; in 1885. At the time, it was the highest point on the Pittsburgh skyline.

On May 27, 1911, under the leadership of Fr. Martin Hehir, the college became the first Catholic institution of higher learning in Pennsylvania to become a university. It was subsequently renamed Duquesne University of the Holy Ghost, after Ange Duquesne de Menneville, Marquis du Quesne, the French governor of New France who first brought Catholic observances to the Pittsburgh area. The year 1913 saw the university record its first woman graduate, Sister M. Fides of the Sisters of Mercy. In 1914, the graduate school was established.

The 1920s were a time of expansion for the developing university. The campus grew to include its first single-purpose academic building, Canevin Hall, as well as a gymnasium and a central heating plant. Institutionally, the school grew to include the School of Pharmacy in 1925, a School of Music in 1926, and a School of Education in 1929. Hard times, however, came with the Wall Street Crash of 1929; plans for expansion had to be shelved.

The beloved Fr. Hehir was succeeded in 1931 by Fr. J. J. Callahan. Though Fr. Callahan was not as able an administrator as Fr. Hehir, his tenure did see the university add numerous new programs, a short-lived School for the Unemployed, and, in 1937, the Nursing School. The university&#x27;s sports programs also thrived during the Depression era, with some of the greatest triumphs of the basketball and football teams occurring in that time period—a 6–0 football defeat of Pitt in 1936 was a high point of student exuberance. A university library was completed in 1940.

Some of the darkest years of the university&#x27;s history passed during World War II, when the university was led by the young Fr. Raymond Kirk. The school&#x27;s enrollment, which had been 3,100 in 1940, dropped to an all-time low in the summer of 1944, with a mere one thousand students enrolled. Fr. Kirk&#x27;s health broke under the strain of leading the school through such struggles, and he was relieved of his duties by Fr. Francis P. Smith in 1946. After the war, the school faced a wave of veterans seeking higher education. In contrast to the lean war-time years, the 1949 enrollment peaked at 5,500, and space became an issue. Fr. Smith took advantage of the Lanham Act, which allowed him to acquire three barracks-type buildings from Army surplus. The science curriculum was expanded, and the School of Business Administration saw its enrollment rise to over two thousand. Also during this time, a campus beautification project was implemented and WDUQ, Pittsburgh&#x27;s first college radio station, was founded.

An ambitious campus expansion plan was proposed by Fr. Vernon F. Gallagher in 1952. Assumption Hall, the first student dormitory, was opened in 1954, and Rockwell Hall was dedicated in November 1958, housing the schools of business and law. It was during the tenure of Fr. Henry J. McAnulty that Fr. Gallagher&#x27;s ambitious plans were put to action. Between 1959 and 1980, the university renovated or constructed various buildings to form the academic infrastructure of the campus. Among these are College Hall, the music school and the library, as well as a new Student Union and Mellon Hall, along with four more dormitories. Although Fr. McAnulty&#x27;s years as president saw tremendous expansion, a financial crisis in 1970 nearly forced the closure of the university. Students rallied to the cause, however, and set a goal of raising one million dollars to &quot;Save Duquesne University&quot;. Students engaged in door-to-door fundraising and gathered nearly $600,000, enough to keep Duquesne afloat until the end of the crisis in 1973. It was also during Fr. McAnulty&#x27;s time as president that Duquesne University played an important role in the shaping of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal, which has its roots in a retreat of several faculty members and students held in February 1967.

McAnulty was succeeded by Fr. Donald S. Nesti. Fr. Nesti&#x27;s tenure in the 1980s saw construction begin on the A. J. Palumbo Center, which was dedicated in 1988, as well as an expansion of the law school. It was under the presidency of John E. Murray Jr., the university&#x27;s first lay president, that the university developed into its modern institutional and physical form. Between 1988 and 2001, the university opened its first new schools in 50 years, including the Rangos School of Health Sciences, the Bayer School of Natural and Environmental Sciences, and the School of Leadership and Professional Advancement. Duquesne University continues to expand with its completion of the Power Center, a mixed-use development project on Forbes Avenue, and a new residence hall, which was completed in 2012.

The university established an osteopathic medical school which admitted its first class in the summer of 2024.

== Campuses ==

=== Main campus ===
Duquesne University has more than tripled in size from its early site on Boyd&#x27;s Hill to its present main campus in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Uptown neighborhood. Of the 31 buildings that make up the Bluff campus, several are recent constructions or renovations, including a health sciences facility (Rangos Hall), two recording studios, two parking garages, a multipurpose recreation center (Power Center), and a theater-classroom complex (Bayer Hall).

The &quot;Old Main&quot; Administration Building was the first structure to be constructed on campus. The Victorian Gothic structure is still used to house the administrative offices of the university. Canevin Hall, named after bishop of Pittsburgh Regis Canevin, was constructed in 1922 and is the oldest classroom building on campus; it was renovated in 1968 and again in 2009. These two buildings, as well Bayer Hall, the Richard King Mellon Hall of Science (designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe), and the Victorian Laval House, are at the west end of Academic Walk, a thoroughfare that provides pedestrian-only access to most of the campus, including the Student Union. The Union, which houses meeting rooms, three dining facilities, a Starbucks, a PNC branch, a recreation center, and an art gallery, is the center of campus life and student activities. Located on the northern side of campus is the Gumberg Library, a five-story structure opened in 1978 and holding extensive print and electronic collections.

==== Forbes and Fifth Avenue expansion ====

The newest campus construction is the Power Center, named in honor of Father William Patrick Power, the university&#x27;s first president. The multipurpose recreation facility on Forbes Avenue between Chatham Square and Magee Street, across from the university&#x27;s Forbes Avenue entrance, adds to the student fitness facilities on campus. Other spaces include a Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore containing a Starbucks café, Freshens, Red Ring Restaurant, and a conference center and ballroom. The building was completed in early January 2008, and is the first stage of a development that aims to serve both the campus community and the surrounding neighborhood. In October 2010 the university announced the purchase of the eight-story, building at 600 Fifth Avenue from Robert Morris University, which had been RMU&#x27;s Pittsburgh Center. This adds an additional 87 classrooms, 1,100 seats and new music facilities. Duquesne plans to utilize this building to allow further expansion of its graduate programs as applications have doubled since 2005. Duquesne also owns four other buildings along Fifth Avenue bordering on the PPG Paints Arena where the university now plays some of its home basketball games. The university announced plans on August 1, 2019, to build an building along Forbes Avenue to house its new osteopathic medical school.
University owned WDUQ, NPR and jazz station, has relocated to offices in the Cooper Building and studios in Clement Hall.

=== Capital Region campus ===
Until 2009, Duquesne University had an extension of the School of Leadership and Professional Advancement in Wormleysburg. Classes were also available at Fort Indiantown Gap.

=== Italian campus ===
Since 2001, Duquesne has offered an Italian campus program. The facility, part of extensive grounds owned and managed by the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth, is west of downtown Rome and just beyond Vatican City. University materials describe the campus as &quot;a walled property enclosing beautiful gardens and walkways, [with] classrooms, computer facilities (including Internet), a small library, dining hall, recreational areas, and modernized living quarters complete with bathrooms in each double room.&quot;

The curriculum at the Italian campus includes history, art history, Italian language, philosophy, theology, sociology and economics, appropriate to the historical and cultural setting of Rome. The faculty of the program, largely constituted by visiting professors and resident scholars, is supplemented by a few distinguished professors from the home campus.

== Academics and rankings ==

Duquesne has a total student enrollment of 9,344 undergraduate and graduate students. The university has grown to comprise ten schools and other institutions, offering degree programs at the baccalaureate, professional, masters and doctoral levels in 189 academic programs. It is the only Spiritan institution of higher education in the world, and hosts international students from more than eighty different countries. The following institutions, along with their dates of founding, comprise Duquesne University:
* McAnulty College and Graduate School of Liberal Arts (1878)
* Thomas R. Kline School of Law of Duquesne University (1911)
* A.J. Palumbo School of Business Administration (1913)
* School of Pharmacy (1925)
* Mary Pappert School of Music (1926)
* School of Education (1929)
* School of Nursing (1937)
* Rangos School of Health Sciences (1990)
* School of Science and Engineering (formally split from College of Arts and Sciences in 1994)
* College of Osteopathic Medicine (2024)

== Student life ==

=== Residential life ===
More than 3,600 students live at Duquesne University in five residence halls and one apartment complex. Assumption Hall, built in the 1950s, was the first residential hall on Duquesne&#x27;s campus, and can accommodate 300 residents. Freshman residence halls include St. Ann&#x27;s Hall and St. Martin&#x27;s Hall, which were opened in the 1960s. The largest facility is Duquesne Towers, which houses 1,200 students, including Greek organizations. Other facilities include Vickroy Hall, built in 1997, and Brottier Hall, which was formerly an apartment complex before its purchase by the university in 2004.

On March 10, 2010, the university announced plans to construct a new residence hall. The need for a new residence hall was explained in a news release as being as the result of &quot;retention rates well above national averages and a desire voiced by students to remain on campus during their junior and senior years&quot;. The new hall was constructed on the former site of Des Places Hall, an academic building named after Claude Poullart des Places, the founder of the Spiritan congregation. The hall retained its name and was opened for the fall 2012 semester.

=== Student groups ===
Duquesne University hosts more than 150 student organizations, including 19 fraternities and sororities. Media organizations include a student radio station, WDSR (Duquesne Student Radio). Founded in 1984, it broadcasts solely through the Internet streaming audio. Other student media organizations include &quot;The Duquesne Duke&quot; campus newspaper and &quot;L&#x27;Esprit Du Duc&quot;, the university&#x27;s yearbook. Duquesne also hosts a Student Government Association, a student-run Program Council, a Commuter Council, a representative Residence Hall Association, an Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Council, the Knights of Columbus, and numerous departmental Honor Societies.

=== Greek life ===
There are several fraternities and sororities on campus. Most Duquesne chapters have suites or wings in the Duquesne Towers on campus, but some chapters are housed off campus.

=== Performance art ===
Duquesne is the home of the Tamburitzans, the longest-running multicultural song and dance company in the United States. Their shows feature an ensemble of talented young folk artists dedicated to the performance and preservation of the music, songs, and dances of Eastern Europe and neighboring folk cultures. The performers are full-time students who receive substantial scholarship awards from the university, with additional financial aid provided by Tamburitzans Scholarship Endowment Funds.

The Mary Pappert School of Music hosts in-house and guest performers on a regular basis.

The university maintains three theater groups: the Red Masquers, Spotlight Musical Theatre Company, and the Medieval and Renaissance Players. In recent years, the Masquers also participated in the Pittsburgh Monologue Project. Spotlight is a musical theatre company that produces two full-length Broadway musicals each year. The Renaissance and Medieval Players perform religious plays, morality plays, and farces from the English Medieval and Early Renaissance periods, sometimes working in conjunction with the Red Masquers.

== Athletics ==
The Duquesne Dukes play varsity football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, women&#x27;s bowling, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, women&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s outdoor track &amp; field, women&#x27;s indoor track &amp; field, women&#x27;s lacrosse, women&#x27;s rowing, and women&#x27;s volleyball at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I level and in either the Atlantic 10 Conference or the Northeast Conference (football and bowling). In recent years, Duquesne football was a member of the NCAA Division I Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference. Duquesne started varsity women&#x27;s triathlon in the 2023-24 academic year and will start varsity women&#x27;s golf and acrobatics and tumbling in 2024-25.

Duquesne has two notable club ice hockey teams that play in the ACHA as members of College Hockey Mid-America (Division 1) and College Hockey East (Division 3).

== Insignia and tradition ==
=== Seal and coat of arms ===
The Duquesne University coat of arms was modified from that of the family of its namesake, the Marquis du Quesne. A red book was added to adapt the arms of a French governor to that of a university. The coat of arms was designed by a Spiritan father and alumnus, Father John F. Malloy. They were then examined and partly revised by Pierre de Chaignon la Rose, a prominent ecclesiastical heraldic artist at the time. The design was adopted early in 1923 and used for the first time carved in high relief above Canevin Hall, then under construction. The first time the arms were incorporated into the seal of the university was for the commencement program of 1926.

The formal heraldic blazon of the arms is as follows: &quot;Argent, a lion sable armed and langued gules holding a book of the same edged or; on a chief party per pale azure and of the third, a dove displayed of the first, areoled of the fourth; motto, &quot;Spiritus est qui vivificat.&quot;&quot;

=== Alma mater ===
Alumnus Joseph Carl Breil, class of 1888, notable as being the first person to compose a score specifically for a motion picture, also composed the music for Duquesne University&#x27;s alma mater. Father John F. Malloy, who also designed the university coat of arms, wrote the lyrics. The first performance of the song was in October 1920.

:&quot;Alma Mater, old Duquesne, guide and friend of our youthful days.&quot;
:&quot;We, thy sons and daughters all, our loyal voices raise.&quot;
:&quot;The hours we spent at thy Mother knee and drank of wisdom&#x27;s store&quot;
:&quot;Shall e&#x27;er in mem&#x27;ry treasured be, tho&#x27; we roam the whole world o&#x27;er.&quot;
:&quot;Then forward ever, dear Alma Mater, o&#x27;er our hearts unrivaled reign.&quot;
:&quot;Onward ever, old Alma Mater! All hail to thee, Duquesne!&quot;

=== Class ring ===
The Duquesne University class ring was first adopted in the 1920s, the same decade as the seal and alma mater. The first incarnation was approved by a 1925 student committee, and was an &quot;octagonal deep blue stone held in place by four corner prongs.&quot; Two years later, another student committee replaced the blue stone with a synthetic ruby. The ring&#x27;s design continued to evolve until 1936, as the prongs were replaced with a continuous metal . The words &quot;Duquesne&quot;, &quot;University&quot;, and &quot;Pittsburgh&quot;, accompanied the graduation year around the four sides of the bezel, and the shank on both sides was decorated with a motif adapted from the university&#x27;s coat of arms. Originally an option, the embossed gold Gothic initial &quot;D&quot; became standard in the late 1930s. The Duquesne alumni website notes, &quot;The golden initial, oversized stone and octagonal shape make the Duquesne ring stand out from those of other colleges and universities.&quot;

== Sustainability ==
Duquesne was the first university in Pennsylvania to receive the EPA&#x27;s Energy Star Combined Heat and Power Award for its natural gas turbine located on campus. Duquesne also uses an innovative ice cooling system that cools buildings and reduces peak energy demand. Duquesne&#x27;s new Power Center facility has also achieved a LEED Silver Rating. Furthermore, Duquesne&#x27;s Center for Environmental Research and Education (CERE) offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in environmental science and management. Duquesne has been evaluated by the 2009 and 2010 College Sustainability Report Card.

===MBA-Sustainable Business Practices===
The Palumbo-Donahue School of Business offers a full-time MBA-Sustainable Business Practices. This Sustainable MBA integrates sustainability-oriented coursework and consulting projects into the curriculum. This program has earned considerable recognition since its launch. In 2008, the program was awarded the Page Prize for excellence in business sustainability education. In 2018, Robert Sroufe received the Aspen Institute &quot;Ideas Worth Teaching&quot; award, which recognizes professors and classes that redefine business education and practice. In 2020, the program was recognized as the top sustainability-focused MBA in the United States and the fourth best program in the world by Corporate Knights magazine.

== Labor practices ==
Like many US universities, Duquesne University has faced criticism for what has been described as hire-and-fire treatment of academics not on tenure track. Adjunct faculty have complained that they are paid approximately $12,000 annually for full-time work without the right to receive or buy into benefits or healthcare, and with the risk of their anticipated work being terminated with as little as two weeks&#x27; notice. Following concern that any complaints to administrators could lead to adjunct professors being dismissed, adjunct faculty have sought to unionize by joining the United Steelworkers union. Particular criticism was applied to the university after the death of Margaret Mary Vojtko, an adjunct who was removed by campus police from her office, where she had been sleeping as she could not afford to heat her house while paying for chemotherapy. On a contract that did not pay for insurance, her pay had recently been cut by approximately a third.

The university has resisted attempts by adjunct faculty to join unions, arguing that its academic staff are exempt from employee rights due to its status as a religious institution. Former university president Charles Dougherty suggested that unionization &quot;could lead to the compromise or loss of our Catholic and Spiritan identity&quot;.

== Notable alumni ==
Duquesne has over 93,000 living alumni, and the School of Law reports that almost 30 percent of the practicing lawyers in western Pennsylvania are graduates of Duquesne.

Duquesne has many alumni in the media and sports fields. These include the late John Clayton, a writer and reporter for ESPN; actor Tom Atkins; and Terry McGovern, the television actor, radio personality, voice-over specialist, and acting instructor. German filmmaker Werner Herzog attended Duquesne, but did not graduate. Sports personalities Leigh Bodden, Chip Ganassi, Mike James, baseball hall-of-famer Cumberland Posey, and Chuck Cooper, the first African-American basketball player to be drafted in the NBA, all graduated from Duquesne, as did both the founder and his principal owner son of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Art and Dan Rooney. Singer Bobby Vinton, MLB pitcher Joe Beimel, and big-band composer Sammy Nestico are also alumni. Norm Nixon, who holds the all-time assist record for the Duquesne Dukes, played for the Los Angeles Lakers. Indiana Pacers point guard T. J. McConnell spent two years playing for the Dukes. WWE Superstar, Roman Macek, ring name Luca Crusifino, graduated from Duquesne University and also attended Thomas R. Kline School of Law of Duquesne University. 

Duquesne has graduated at least three bishops and two cardinals in the Roman Catholic Church, including Bishops David Zubik, who is the current ordinary of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh; former Bishop of Pittsburgh Vincent Leonard; and David Bonnar, the Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Youngstown; and Cardinals Daniel DiNardo and Adam Maida. Figures in politics include Donald A. Bailey, Father James Cox, former retired United States Air Force four-star general and former Director of the National Security Agency, Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence, and Director of the CIA General Michael V. Hayden, former Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania Catherine Baker Knoll, U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania Bud Shuster, and United States ambassadors Thomas Patrick Melady and Dan Rooney. Duquesne has many alumni in the sciences including George Delahunty. Miftah Ismail who is federal Minister of Finance and revenue in Pakistan is also an alumnus.

<text>Nikolay Fyodorovich Petrovsky (; 1837–1908) was the Russian consul-general in Kashgar from 1882 until 1902.

Petrovsky&#x27;s main adversary during his time in Central Asia was George Macartney, his British counterpart. The competition between their two countries for influence in Central Asia is known as the Great Game. Between 1899 and June 1902 the two did not speak to each other, although both were on friendly terms with visiting travellers such as Sven Hedin. 

Petrovsky was very interested in collecting materials on the history of Xinjiang. The Soviet scholar A.F. Usmanov suggested that 
he may have been instrumental in encouraging the veteran of Yaqub Beg&#x27;s regime, Mulla Musa Sayrami, to write his &quot;Tārīkh-i amniyya&quot; (&quot;History of Peace&quot;), which to this day remains one of the best sources on the events in the region in the 19th century.
By the end of the 19th century, Petrovsky&#x27;s personal collection included some texts in the then-unknown Tocharian languages, among other obscure dialects. The bulk of his collection was donated by Petrovsky to the Asiatic Museum in St. Petersburg.

<text>Brian Bolland (; born 26 March 1951) is a British comics artist. Best known in the United Kingdom as one of the Judge Dredd artists for British comics anthology &quot;2000 AD&quot;, he spearheaded the &#x27;British Invasion&#x27; of the American comics industry, and in 1982 produced the artwork alongside author Mike W. Barr on &quot;Camelot 3000&quot;, which was DC Comics&#x27; first 12-issue comicbook maxiseries created for the direct market.

Bolland illustrated the critically acclaimed 1988 graphic novel &quot;&quot;, an origin story for Batman supervillain the Joker, with writer Alan Moore. He gradually shifted to working primarily as a cover artist, producing the majority of his work for DC Comics. Bolland created cover artwork for the &quot;Animal Man&quot;, &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, and &quot;&quot; superhero comic book series. In 1996, he drew and self-penned a &quot;&quot; story, &quot;An Innocent Guy&quot;. For DC&#x27;s Vertigo imprint, Bolland has done covers for &quot;The Invisibles&quot;, &quot;Jack of Fables&quot;, and a number of one-shots and miniseries.

In addition to interior and cover art, Bolland has also produced several comic strips and pin-ups as both writer and artist. His most notable are the semi-autobiographical humour strip &quot;Mr. Mamoulian&quot; and the whimsical rhyming strip &quot;The Actress and the Bishop&quot;. All strips of both projects were included in the &quot;Bolland Strips!&quot; collection book, published in 2005. In 2006, he compiled the art book &quot;The Art of Brian Bolland&quot;, showcasing all of Bolland&#x27;s work to date and also his work as a photographer.

==Early life==

Brian Bolland was born in Butterwick, Lincolnshire, England, to Albert &quot;A.J.&quot; John, a fenland farmer, and Lillie Bolland. He grew up in a small village near Boston, Lincolnshire until he was 18 years old. When American comics began to be imported into England, , Bolland hadn&#x27;t read any comics before the age of ten, but by 1960 he was intrigued by Dell Comics&#x27; &quot;Dinosaurus!&quot;, which developed into a childhood interest in dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes. Comics including &quot;Turok, Son of Stone&quot; and DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Tomahawk&quot; soon followed, and it was this burgeoning comics collection that would help inspire Bolland to draw his own comics around the age of ten with ideas such as &quot;Insect League.&quot; He recalls that &quot;[s]uperheroes crept into my life by stealth,&quot; as he actively sought out covers featuring &quot;any big creature that looked vaguely dinosaur-like, trampling puny humans.&quot; These adolescent criteria led from &quot;Dinosaurus!&quot; and &quot;Turok&quot; via &quot;House of Mystery&quot; to &quot;Batman and Robin [who] were [often] being harassed by big weird things, as were Superman, Aquaman, Wonder Woman [etc],&quot; Bolland recalled. Soon, family outings to Skegness became an excuse for the future artist to &quot;trawl... round some of the more remote backstreet newsagents&quot; for comics to store on an overflowing wooden bookcase he&#x27;d built in school.

As early as 1962, aged 11, Bolland remembers thinking that &quot;Carmine Infantino&#x27;s work on the &quot;Flash&quot; and Gil Kane&#x27;s on &quot;Green Lantern&quot; and the &quot;Atom&quot; had a sophistication about it that I hadn&#x27;t [previously] seen.&quot; He would later cite Kane and Alex Toth as &quot;pinnacle[s] of excellence,&quot; alongside Curt Swan, Murphy Anderson, Sid Greene, Joe Kubert, Ross Andru, Mike Esposito, Nick Cardy, and Bruno Premiani, whose influences showed in his &quot;early crude stabs at drawing comics.&quot; The young Bolland did not rate Marvel Comics as highly as DC, feeling the covers cluttered and the paper quality crude. His appreciation of the artwork of Jack Kirby, he says, only materialised much later. He did however enjoy UK comics, including newspaper strips such as &quot;Jeff Hawke&quot; by Syd Jordan and &quot;Carol Day&quot; by David Wright, and &quot;Valiant&quot; which featured &quot;Mytek the Mighty&quot; by Eric Bradbury and &quot;Steel Claw&quot; by Jesus Blasco. Despite such a variety of inspirations, Bolland credits his eventual pursuance of art as a hobby and then vocation to a primary school art teacher.

Growing up as an only child with parents that had no interest in art, literature, or music, he embraced the late 1960s pop culture explosion of pirate radio stations, experimental music, recreational drugs, psychedelia, &quot;Oz Magazine&quot;, &quot;dropping out&quot; and other aspects of hippy culture epitomised by underground comix such as Robert Crumb&#x27;s &quot;Zap Comix&quot;. Having taken both O-Level and A-Level examinations in art, Bolland spent five years at art school beginning in 1969, learning graphic design and art history. Learning to draw comics, however, was an art he self-taught, with Bolland eventually writing a 15,000-word dissertation in 1973 on Neal Adams – an &quot;artist [his teachers] had never heard of.&quot; He would later recall:
==UK career==

===Fanzines and early work===
Bolland studied graphic design at Norwich University of the Arts. While at art school, Bolland drew and self-published a couple of fanzines and his work was published in British underground magazines &quot;Frendz&quot;, &quot;International Times&quot; and &quot;OZ&quot;. In 1971, his friend Dave Harwood entered printed mass production with his &quot;RDH Comix&quot;, for which Bolland provided a cover (featuring Norwich Cathedral). Also in 1971, &quot;Time Out&quot; – an underground magazine rapidly reinventing itself into &quot;the biggest weekly listings magazine in London&quot; – gave Bolland his first compensated work producing an illustration of blues guitarist Buddy Guy. While in Norwich, Bolland produced the first episodes of an adult &quot;Little Nemo in Slumberland&quot; parody entitled &quot;Little Nympho in Slumberland&quot;, and when he moved to the Central School of Art and Design in London in 1973, he continued to produce (mostly full-page) &quot;Little Nympho&quot; strips for a 50-copy fanzine entitled &quot;Suddenly at 2-o-clock in the Morning.&quot; He also contributed a smaller, strip entitled &quot;The Mixed-Up Kid&quot; to the Central School of Art&#x27;s &quot;Galloping Maggot&quot;, the college newspaper.

===&quot;2000 AD&quot;, &quot;Judge Death&quot; and &quot;Walter the Wobot&quot;===
In 1972, Bolland attended the British Comic Art Convention at the Waverley Hotel in London, and met several influential figures in the current British comics scene, including Dez Skinn, Nick Landau, Richard Burton, Angus McKie and – crucially – Dave Gibbons. Bolland and Gibbons became firm friends. After finishing his college course, Bolland was hit with &quot;the stark reality of unemployment&quot; and on the advice of Gibbons joined art agency Bardon Press Features. He soon found work doing a number of two-page strips for D.C. Thomson resulted, but Bolland would refer to this period as his &quot;lowest time.&quot; Bardon did however produce a client called Pikin which was &quot;planning a bi-weekly comic about an African superhero,&quot; Powerman, which was to be sold in Nigeria. Gibbons and Bolland were to draw alternate issues, with Bolland first drawing &quot;Powerman&quot; No. 2. Bolland recalls that &quot;soon Dave had drawn his entire story and I had produced just a few pages.&quot; This knowledge – &quot;that Dave could produce a page a day... and that I was going to have to do the same&quot; – was a shock, but proved to be &quot;the very best kind of training ground.&quot; With comics purportedly being new to Nigeria, Bolland recalls this work being created specifically to be &quot;really simple; six panels on a page and [all] the panels had to be numbered.&quot; Not only was this work &quot;[t]he best way to learn the simple rules of comic book storytelling,&quot; but &quot;better still, it was going someplace where nobody I knew could see it.&quot; He &quot;drew around 300 pages of that very straightforward, simple-to-follow work, and I guess the storytelling flowed naturally from that.&quot; Even so, he &quot;was always struggling to get the last eight or ten pages finished,&quot; and was occasionally helped by friends, both from his &quot;Norwich School of Art days,&quot; Gibbons and future-&quot;2000 AD&quot; and &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; artist Kevin O&#x27;Neill.

Bolland writes that starting with &quot;Powerman&quot; he &quot;found regular employment drawing comics, one of which, &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;, in 1977–80, turned out to be quite a hit...&quot;

In early 1977, Bardon agent Barry Coker called Gibbons and Bolland to the office and showed them &quot;mock-ups from a new science fiction comic IPC was planning to publish.&quot; Gibbons joined Carlos Ezquerra in &quot;jumping into &quot;2000AD&quot; feet first with issue 1 (or Programme, later Prog 1)... but meanwhile [Bolland] would have to keep drawing &quot;Powerman&quot; on [his] own.&quot; &quot;Powerman&quot; dropped to a monthly schedule, and Coker soon got Bolland &quot;a cover on &quot;2000 AD&quot; in May &#x27;77 with Prog 11&quot; (7 May 1977; signed &quot;Bollo&quot;). Bolland recalls of those early days that:
Other covers followed for nearly a third of the first 30 progs, as well as stand-alone pages and some inking duties on Gibbons&#x27; &quot;Dan Dare&quot;. Already familiar with Nick Landau (acting editor), when another artist dropped out, Bolland was called directly to complete a &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; story in Prog 41 (3 Dec 77) and soon was established as a regular artist on the series. &quot;From that point on,&quot; writes Bolland, &quot;either he [Landau] or his successor Steve MacManus called me direct whenever they wanted me to do a &quot;Dredd&quot; story.&quot; Dredd stories started as traditional UK comic stories, i.e. &quot;six-page one-offs... [Writers] Pat Mills and John Wagner seem[ing] to spurn the American comic idea of continuing stories or, worse, the idea of a &quot;2000 AD&quot; continuity between characters,&quot; Bolland seeing this as a &quot;strength... hav[ing] one great new idea each week.&quot; Soon, though, the writers began to craft serials, and Bolland&#x27;s distinct abilities with subtle facial expressions, dramatic lighting and the dynamic composition of page layout made him the perfect choice to draw the ongoing sagas, starting with &quot;The Lunar Olympics&quot;. Bolland contributed artwork to such &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; story-arcs as &quot;Luna Period&quot;, &quot;The Cursed Earth&quot;, &quot;The Day the Law Died&quot;, &quot;The Judge Child Quest&quot; and &quot;Block Mania&quot;. As the Dredd stories rose in popularity, they &quot;were moved so they started on the middle pages&quot; with a colour double-page spread, which Bolland &quot;always struggled with&quot; finding it &quot;very difficult... [trying] to fill that space most effectively.&quot; Ultimately the weekly deadlines meant that Bolland was unable to produce all episodes of the epic storylines himself, and the art chores on &quot;The Cursed Earth&quot; were split between Bolland and Mike McMahon.

Bolland&#x27;s early work on &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; was much influenced by McMahon, a talented newcomer whose idiosyncratic style was fuelling the interest in the new character. Bolland thought McMahon was &quot;terrific, the real ideas man on Dredd,&quot; but noted that McMahon&#x27;s approach was &quot;very impressionistic,&quot; while the &quot;average comics reader, certainly at the time, does tend to prefer realism.&quot; Bolland therefore states that he &quot;aped Mike&#x27;s genius... and then reinterpreted [Dredd] in a style which actually borrowed a lot from the work of the American artists,&quot; retaining McMahon&#x27;s &quot;granite-jawed&quot; look but bringing a level of realism and fine detail to the character, which Mark Salisbury says &quot;finally cemented the iconic image.&quot;

As well as honing the look of the character and contributing to the highest-profile early storylines, Bolland also created the look of two of the wider Dredd universe&#x27;s most enduring characters: Judge Death (and the other three Dark Judges) and Judge Anderson.

Later, Landau&#x27;s Titan &quot;decided they could repackage the &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; stories in an American comic format with new covers and sell it to America,&quot; and did under the brand &quot;Eagle Comics&quot;. Bolland provided many of the covers for these compendium issues.

Bolland &quot;drew the first three episodes of the &quot;Judge Death&quot; story over the winter of 1979–80,&quot; as &quot;just another villain in just another excellent John Wagner script.&quot; He does not &quot;remember doing any sketches to get him right,&quot; the &quot;outfit was described somewhat in the script... and details of it were heavily inspired by the look of Kevin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Nemesis the Warlock&quot;. Bolland was, he acknowledges, &quot;by far the slowest of the rotating &quot;Judge Death&quot; artists,&quot; opting to &quot;take as long as I needed and do a half-way decent job&quot; rather than rushing. For the sequel, a &quot;massive (for me) 30 pages,&quot; &quot;2000 AD&quot;&#x27;s editorial banked one-off stories to give Bolland long enough to draw it all.

When Nick Landau began (in 1981) Titan Books&#x27; reprints of Judge Dredd material, he &quot;used this story non-chronologically&quot; to begin the series. Landau spent time paginating the book at Bolland&#x27;s flat, and discovered that &quot;[s]ome stories started or ended on the wrong page thereby leaving blank pages,&quot; as it was set to be &quot;in effect, the first book exclusively of my work&quot; the artist &quot;gladly offered to add three full page pictures for the &quot;Cursed Earth&quot; volume and a new back cover for the first &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; volume.

Walter the Wobot was an android with a speech impediment who served as Judge Dredd&#x27;s personal servant robot. Created for comedic relief, Bolland notes that &quot;[t]he great thing about the &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; strip was it&#x27;s [sic] ability to slide seamlessly between gritty sci fi adventure, nasty gothic horror, spoofery, all the way to daft comedy.&quot; Walter&#x27;s solo adventures – &quot;Walter the Wobot, Fwiend of Dwedd&quot; – were the latter style. Bolland drew all bar a couple of Walter&#x27;s adventures, which appeared between Progs #50–61; #67–68 and #84–85 (with Ian Gibson drawing the first two episodes and Brendan McCarthy the last two), and says that he &quot;was usually able to complete one in a day.&quot; He namechecks &quot;the great Don Martin&quot; as an artist he &quot;shamelessly ripped off&quot; for the human supporting characters, drawing most of the pages in Chiswick, 1978.

===Other UK work===
In between &quot;Dredd&quot; assignments Bolland drew horror strips for Dez Skinn&#x27;s &quot;House of Hammer&quot;, having been introduced to the comic through another of the &quot;fanboy in-crowd,&quot; Trevor Goring, who drew &quot;a comic strip version of the movie &quot;Plague of the Zombies&quot;,&quot; and asked Bolland to ink it. Soon, Bolland was asked to draw &quot;Vampire Circus&quot; (dir. Robert Young, 1972; comic version scripted by Steve Parkhouse), and &quot;pile[d] on the gore&quot; for his first Hammer horror adaptation – although he found much of the &quot;blood painted out&quot; in the printed version.
From the 1970s to the present, Bolland has also produced one-off pieces of artwork for use as record (including one for &quot;The Drifters&quot; in 1975), paperback book (including the UK Titan editions of George R. R. Martin&#x27;s &quot;Wild Cards&quot; anthologies) and magazine covers (including &quot;Time Out&quot; and every major comics publication). He continued to produce work for fanzines, including for Nick Landau&#x27;s &quot;Comic Media News&quot;, and &quot;Arkensword&quot; and even &quot;drew the hazard cards&quot; for a board game called &quot;Maneater&quot;. He later &quot;got to know the Games Workshop guys, Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone,&quot; and produced various &quot;games related drawings&quot; including a cover or two for &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; Adventure Game Books, and RPG scenario pamphlets. His cover work for Games Workshop includes the role-playing game &quot;Golden Heroes&quot; and its only adventure &quot;Legacy of Eagles&quot;, and the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; book &quot;Appointment with F.E.A.R.&quot;

In 1977, Bolland was approached by Syd Jordan to ghost some episodes of Jordan&#x27;s newspaper strip &quot;Jeff Hawke&quot;, after fellow fandom-pro artist Paul Neary had already done a fair number of them. Bolland drew 13 episodes, and &quot;Syd touched up some of the faces, a few details here and there, to make them look a bit more like him.&quot; By this point, &quot;although the &quot;Express&quot; owned the rights to the strip, they were not printing it,&quot; but since it had a strong European following, these new episodes (Bolland believes) &quot;got collected in anthologies in French and Spanish,&quot; but not in the UK except briefly in &quot;the fanzine &quot;Eureka&quot;.&quot; In 1985, as a known fan, Bolland was approached by Nick Landau to select stories and draw covers for two Titan collections of the strip, with a third design going unpublished. Bolland also contributed &quot;A Miracle of Elisha&quot; to Knockabout Comics&#x27; &quot;Old Bailey OZ Trial Special&quot;, written because Old Testament history had piqued the interest of Bolland when living near the British Museum. This page was later reprinted in the &quot;Outrageous Tales From the Old Testament&quot; volume, which included works from Moore, Hunt Emerson, Gaiman, Gibbons, and Dave McKean, although Bolland&#x27;s name was left off the cover.

Bolland produced a considerable amount of advertising work, initially because his agent &quot;Barry Coker kept putting advertising jobs my way,&quot; including a number of ads for &quot;Palitoy&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; toys.&quot; He also drew some of the earliest pieces of advertising artwork for the science fiction and comic shop Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed, which ran in various fanzines, convention programmes, and magazines such as &quot;Time Out&quot; and was commissioned by future-Titan Distribution and Forbidden Planet co-founder Mike Lake (who was &quot;working there at the time&quot;) c. 1976. As well as the DTWAGE adverts, Bolland and most of his peers also contributed artwork to advertise, and/or feature in programme booklets for the UK Comicon, starting . In 1978, Nick Landau, Mike Lake and Mike Luckman &quot;took their comic distribution business into the highstreet,&quot; opening the first Forbidden Planet comics shop, for which Lake asked Bolland to produce the now-famous &quot;People like &quot;us&quot; shop at... FORBIDDEN PLANET&quot; adverts. Bolland&#x27;s artwork would also feature on the shop&#x27;s plastic bags, as well as T-Shirts and &quot;covers for their SF, comic and TV &amp; film catalogues,&quot; among other places. Later, when a branch of Forbidden Planet was opened in New York, and at a second location in London, Bolland &quot;did ads for both of them.&quot;

==DC Comics==
Bolland was among the first British comics creators to work in the American comics industry, spearheading the so-called &quot;British Invasion&quot; in 1979/80. Bolland recalls that his big break came when Joe Staton attended the Summer 1979 Comicon, and, needing somewhere to work on &quot;Green Lantern&quot; while in the UK, arranged to stay with the Bollands. Staton called his editor Jack Harris and told him that Bolland, a big &quot;Green Lantern&quot; fan, would like to draw a &quot;Green Lantern&quot; cover; Harris agreed. He drew several covers for DC Comics, starting with &quot;Green Lantern&quot; No. 127 (April 1980), as well as some fill-in stories. These stories included, in 1980-1981, &quot;Certified Safe&quot; in &quot;Mystery in Space&quot; and &quot;Falling Down to Heaven&quot; in &quot;Madame Xanadu&quot;, DC&#x27;s first attempt at marketing comics specifically to the &quot;direct market&quot; of fans and collectors. For editor Julius Schwartz, Bolland drew covers around which writers would craft stories, which included two Starro covers for &quot;Justice League of America&quot; No. 189 and 190 and &quot;Superman&quot; No. 422 (Aug. 1986).

Among his earliest interior work for DC was a chapter in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; No. 200 (March 1982) alongside Joe Kubert, Carmine Infantino, Gil Kane, Jim Aparo, George Pérez, and Dick Giordano. This gave the artist his &quot;first stab at drawing &quot;Batman&quot;.&quot; Bolland felt that &quot;after my cover [&quot;GL&quot; #127] worked out the people at DC turned their gaze on London... and particularly on the group of artists at &quot;2000AD&quot; who had been weaned on the DC characters.&quot; He recalled that, &quot;after I was settled in at DC, scouts from that company came to our &quot;Society of Strip Illustration&quot; meetings to win over a few more of us,&quot; making a &quot;formal invitation&quot; at an SSI meeting, which saw &quot;Dave Gibbons, Kevin O&#x27;Neill... [t]hen Alan Davis and Mark Farmer,&quot; following the artists &quot;Alan Grant &quot;went across&quot; and, at some point, a certain tall hairy writer from the Midlands.&quot;

In 1982, DC editor Len Wein chose Bolland to be the artist on DC&#x27;s &quot;Camelot 3000&quot; 12-issue maxi-series, with writer Mike W. Barr. The story, dealing with the return of King Arthur to save England from an alien invasion in the year 3000, not only the largest body of work in a single series by Bolland – and his only attempt to draw a monthly title – but was also the first maxi-series from DC or any other publisher. Bolland was not familiar with the Arthurian legends, and initially conceived Merlin as a comical character. The series was graced with considerable media hype, and Bolland found himself invited to San Diego Comic-Con and other conventions. Bolland was allowed to pick between two inkers, but opted to ink his covers himself. Bolland was uncomfortable with having a third party ink his pencils, and later admitted that he put a high level of detail into his art for the series to leave as little room as possible for the inker to creatively reinterpret his work. However, he was satisfied with the finished results. Reacting indignantly to being presented with Ross Andru layouts for the first two &quot;Camelot 3000&quot; covers, he
&quot;Camelot 3000&quot; had lengthy delays between its final issues. Bolland recalled that he and DC spoke often about how long the series would take to complete, and because the series was inked by other artists, he started off enthusiastically working on issues. As the series continued, however, Bolland became increasingly meticulous, always trying to improve upon his pages. The added details he introduced into his artwork caused significant delays in the final issues of the limited series, causing issues #8–11 to be released on a quarterly rather than monthly status, and the final issue to be cover dated nine months later than the penultimate issue.

Bolland drew a pinup for &quot;Superman&quot; No. 400 (Oct. 1984) and its companion portfolio. In 1986, Bolland was one of several artists who contributed pages to the anniversary issue &quot;Batman&quot; No. 400 (Oct. 1986), his offering featuring villains Ra&#x27;s al Ghul and Catwoman. Around this time, Titan Books were trying to launch a line of comics written by Alan Moore, including a &quot;Batman Meets Judge Dredd&quot; one-off by Moore and Bolland. 
After watching the 1928 film &quot;The Man Who Laughs&quot;, which features a character named Gwynplaine (played by Conrad Veidt) whose rictus grin inspired the visual design of the Joker, Bolland conceived of the 1988 graphic novel &quot;&quot;. The book was written by Alan Moore to great critical acclaim, winning the Eisner Award for Best Graphic Album, and has been regarded as one of the all-time best Joker stories, and one of the greatest Batman graphic novels ever. Director Tim Burton has named &quot;The Killing Joke&quot; as an influence for his 1989 film adaptation of &quot;Batman&quot;, specifically the origin of the Joker. It would also prove to be highly influential on future Batman and Joker stories, though it has also been met with criticism for the violence inflicted on the character Barbara Gordon.

Speaking circa 2000, Bolland said that since &quot;The Killing Joke&quot; he has only drawn comics that he also wrote. Six years later he clarified that

Bolland had expressed some dissatisfaction with the final book, regretting that its impending schedule for release meant he could not colour the book himself, with John Higgins instead being the colorist. In March 2008, the twentieth anniversary hardcover edition of &quot;The Killing Joke&quot; saw the release of the artwork as Bolland intended it, and is completely recoloured by Bolland himself. The book made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list in May 2009.

In 1996, Bolland wrote and drew the story &quot;An Innocent Guy&quot; for the anthology &quot;&quot;, in which an otherwise normal inhabitant of Gotham City documents his plan to carry out the ultimate perfect crime and assassinate the Dark Knight Detective. Drawing inspiration from a cover by Alex Toth, and intended as an homage to the Silver Age &quot;Batman&quot;, Bolland wrote in 2006 that &quot;If anyone were to ask me what is the thing I&#x27;ve done in my career that I&#x27;m most pleased with, it would be this.&quot;

Approached by Batman-editor Mark Chiarello, Bolland was asked whether he would like to draw Batman covers for a new title, &quot;&quot;. Excited by the opportunity, he remarks that a misunderstanding resulted in his being unaware of the first issue being scheduled, resulting in Dave Johnson drawing No. 1 instead, and Bolland joining at issue No. 2. Bolland&#x27;s first two covers were coloured by editor Chiarello, but from issue No. 5 to No. 47 (his last) they were coloured by the artist himself. As his run progressed, the cover art on &quot;Gotham Knights&quot; was increasingly done by Chiarello and other artists, and Bolland&#x27;s first ideas for covers were rejected more often. Eventually, Bolland was told that he&#x27;d be done on the title within a few issues, but after discovering that upcoming covers featured Bane prominently (and not the Joker or Penguin as he had been hoping for some time), Bolland offered to leave immediately.

===Covers===
Although his forays into interior artwork are almost universally acclaimed, Bolland is now far more commonly seen as &#x27;just&#x27; a cover artist – although he notes that he has never decided to actually solely create covers, having merely explored other jobs from strip work. He admits that he works slowly, and consequently finds covers easier to supply than whole story artwork. He also noted simply that he began to focus on covers simply because they were the assignments he was offered. He adds that for artists like him that are well known for covers, editors will usually ask for pin-ups instead.

Bolland has contributed covers – in many cases to complete runs/arcs – to comics since the 1990s, with his photo-realistic work on the titles for which he works as the primary external reference image.

Bolland now draws on a computer, eschewing pencil and paper. He cites the influence of Dave Gibbons, who was himself enthusiastic about the capabilities of computers. Noting also that some colorists were increasingly using computer effects on a whim, he decided if he did not do the colouring himself, the effects would produce covers that didn&#x27;t resemble his work. Starting in 1997, Bolland bought a lot of software and spent ten frustrated months learning the ropes and ultimately finding the liberating ability to adapt his now-solely-onscreen artwork. He states categorically that, in his opinion, drawing on his Wacom tablet is no different from drawing on a pad of paper. Having fully embraced the technology, Bolland has also produced a number of lessons/tutorials on his official website demonstrating his complex techniques. He states that, while this leap means that he no longer produces any paper-based artwork (a profitable sideline for many artists who sell on their original work to collectors), he was certain on abandoning pen and paper.

Bolland recalls that, in the wake of &quot;The Killing Joke&quot;, he received plenty of work offers, but didn&#x27;t feel ready to make a long commitment. So, instead
====&quot;Animal Man&quot;====

The first 63 issues of &quot;Animal Man&quot; featuring Bolland&#x27;s artwork covered the tenures of writers Grant Morrison, Peter Milligan, Tom Veitch and Jamie Delano, with Bolland&#x27;s images maintaining a continuity of style and imagery while the interior work underwent several changes of style and storyline. Initially, he recalls that his cover images derived directly from the script. He would find a scene from the interior art that appeared to make for a good cover, or use a hook on the cover that outlined the plot of the issue. This included the incorporation of photographs into the later covers of Morrison&#x27;s tale of metafiction and deus ex machina author-input. With the (post-Morrison) move of &quot;Animal Man&quot; to DC&#x27;s new &#x27;Mature Readers&#x27; imprint Vertigo, Bolland notes that the covers moved to full color paintings with issue No. 57. These of his covers were &quot;a mixture of ink linework, color washes, airbrush and then, eventually, areas painted in poster color by my wife, Rachel,&quot; which ultimately saw her have significant input on some covers, with Bolland acknowledging that some of his final &quot;Animal Man&quot; covers were mostly her work.

Describing the art of good covers, Bolland remarks that
Coincidentally, when a time travel story arc saw Bolland&#x27;s work coincide with the plot in such a way that he was able to produce a recreated cover from an alternate angle to shed new light on an initially inconsequential image.

====&quot;The Invisibles&quot;====

Bolland&#x27;s covers adorn the whole second and third volumes of Grant Morrison&#x27;s &quot;The Invisibles&quot; and his depictions of the main characters are widely reprinted as the definitive images, despite them all having been realised by other artists – and often drawn by several before Bolland entered the picture. With this title, the artist remarks the complicated subject matter necessitated his &quot;working a lot of strange symbolism and subliminal messages into the cover designs&quot; to create &quot;an image that puzzles to a degree and is layered with elements of surrealism.&quot; Asked to take over from Sean Hughes on the covers for volume two by editor Shelly Roeberg, Bolland found her to be an ideal editor, effusive with praise and specific in requirements. Generally, Bolland recalls she was excited for his ideas, although Morrison had approval on all designs as the series creator. Finding that he had a rapport with, and the trust of, his editor, Bolland thinks that these factors led to some of his most experimental work. Newly embracing the use of a computer, Bolland cites &quot;The Invisibles&quot; Vol 2 No. 11 as his earliest computer-assisted piece of artwork.

For the third series, 

The covers for the third volume of &quot;The Invisibles&quot; were done using a computer, in part because Vertigo had requested &quot;painted&quot; covers and Bolland felt that line and flat color wouldn&#x27;t suffice. The experimental nature of the twelve covers was assisted by the fact that neither Bolland or Roeberg saw the issue script. For the trade paperback covers, Bolland &quot;was determined to make each one weirder than the last,&quot; and so created a Francis Bacon inspired &quot;fleshy mass [dubbed &quot;The Blobby Man&quot;] with a typewriter&quot; for &quot;Entropy in the UK&quot;. Having convinced Karen Berger (Editor in chief of Vertigo) and Roeberg that it was a good idea, the artist recalls that &quot;Shelly rang up and, rather than telling me how wonderful I was, said that when she saw it she nearly lost her lunch! I was asked to turn his skin color from flesh to blue to tone him down a bit.&quot; For the final &quot;Invisible Kingdom&quot; TPB cover, Bolland produced a cover featuring 12 small alternative &quot;Invisibles&quot; covers, which had been very time consuming. Likening the process to creating &quot;a mini comic strip,&quot; Bolland says that &quot;if any detail made any sense it had to be changed to something that didn&#x27;t.&quot;

Bolland&#x27;s style includes the initial &#x27;rough&#x27; outline stage, making it easy for the publisher (and, in some cases, the writer) to &quot;sign off&quot; on his designs. In the case of &quot;The Invisibles&quot;, however, although Morrison officially had final approval on cover art, Bolland described him as generous to the work Bolland came up with. In selected cases, however, Bolland would ask for ideas, and in one specific case &quot;Shelly [Roeberg], the editor... did once relay that Grant wanted an arm coming out of the water holding a gun on the cover of the last issue.&quot; Bolland admits &quot;I don&#x27;t know exactly why. I just supplied it.&quot;

====&quot;Wonder Woman&quot;====

Bolland also contributed a large number of covers to &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, beginning with William Messner Loebs&#x27;s first issue (#63, June 1992) after that author took over writer (and artist) George Pérez&#x27;s 1987 post-Crisis relaunch. Bolland recalls his time drawing &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; fondly, as one of the few occasions he actually sought work rather than being sought for work. He recalls
Bolland&#x27;s first cover saw Diana next to the headline: &quot;The &quot;Stunning&quot; return of comics&#x27; &quot;greatest&quot; heroine!&quot; speaking directly to the reader the words &quot;... Miss me?&quot; Bolland&#x27;s covers over the next 30-plus issues laid the visual groundwork for the character, and saw Bolland illustrate up to and including the centennial issue No. 100. To prepare for his work, Bolland &quot;clipped pictures of the most beautiful women of the time – Christy Turlington, Stephanie Seymour, etc.&quot; saying that he was predominantly interested in their faces, generally doing the body without reference. Interested particularly in drawing the costume, which he feels &quot;has to be one of the sexiest in comics,&quot; he soon found the character removed from her normal costume in the storyline. For her return to her famous costume, Bolland produced the Britannia-esque pose from &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #72 (Mar 1993). He says that &quot;[i]mages like that... usually arise when you&#x27;re completely stuck for an idea.&quot; The image was so iconic that it was released as a poster and later turned into a statue. Shortly thereafter, Diana underwent another costume change – this time designed by Bolland, and mostly drawn on the interior pages by Mike Deodato. The black costume was roundly disliked, even by its designer, Bolland, who philosophically says only that &quot;it was what was asked for at the time,&quot; and – aside from &quot;Camelot 3000&quot; – is the lone instance he was asked to design a costume. The new costume – black hotpants, halter top, straight hair (which Bolland &quot;did&quot; like) and &quot;WW&quot;-emblazoned jacket – was based, Bolland recalled, on a Versace outfit that Cindy Crawford wore for &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine.

====Other cover work====
 Bolland notes that while he tends not to reuse cover ideas, he does occasionally produce homages to his past covers. Particularly, for the first Eagle &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; comic issue – which repackaged &quot;2000 AD&quot; stories for the American market – on which the positioning of the figures echoed similar covers Bolland had drawn &quot;two or three times for different companies with different characters.&quot;

In addition to his landmark runs on &quot;Animal Man&quot; and &quot;The Invisibles&quot;, Bolland has also produced lengthy runs on covers for Geoff Johns&#x27; &quot;The Flash&quot; (from roughs by series editor Joey Cavalieri) and the Batman anthology series &quot;&quot;, as well as assorted issues of &quot;Tank Girl&quot; (for original UK publication &quot;Deadline&quot; and the two subsequent Vertigo miniseries &quot;Tank Girl: The Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Tank Girl: Apocalypse&quot;), &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot; and many more, including a number of oneshots and miniseries for DC&#x27;s offshoot Vertigo. From 2007 to 2011, Bolland was the cover artist on Vertigo&#x27;s &quot;Fables&quot; spin-off &quot;Jack of Fables&quot;, replacing previous cover artist James Jean. Bolland&#x27;s covers also appear on the DC/Vertigo trade paperback collections of Grant Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Doom Patrol&quot;, although he only produced some of covers for the individual issues. He recalls that he sent a number of rough artwork that was often rejected, much to his disappointment, as previous cover artist Simon Bisley had been &quot;a hard act to follow.&quot;

Long-standing familiarity with DC characters and staff, coupled with high demand have combined with other factors to mean that the vast majority of Bolland&#x27;s work has been for DC Comics. In &quot;The Art of Brian Bolland&quot;, he also mentions in passing that a bad experience with a Marvel UK &quot;Hulk&quot; cover and a later oddity with a She-Hulk cover featuring Howard the Duck have given him a mild &quot;phobia&quot; of Marvel and the company&#x27;s production line method that overrules his art style. He has however, produced odd covers for Marvel, First Comics, Continuity Comics, Eclipse Comics, New Comics and a dozen other companies, large and small, as well as book, magazine and record covers. For Dark Horse Comics, Bolland has produced several diverse covers, including a couple for Michael Chabon&#x27;s &quot;The Amazing Adventures of the Escapist&quot; at the behest of editor Diana Schutz. He recalled that the cover of the tenth issue would&#x27;ve had the style of Hergé&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, but it was cancelled after eight issues.

Bolland is noted by some for his use of bondage imagery, although in a humorous self-referential comment, he quotes this &quot;fact&quot; (cited as from Wikipedia), and states that he is unsure of the sentiment&#x27;s accuracy. He notes that &quot;I can only think off-hand of a few occasions when I&#x27;ve drawn bondage. A few Wonder Woman covers perhaps, a Flash cover, a 2000 AD cover, a Mr. Mamoulian page... but that&#x27;s all that I can remember out of many hundreds of images.&quot; In 2006&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Brian Bolland&quot;, he does suggest that &quot;I trace my mild bondage fetish back to a book of Bible stories that must have been given to my father as a Sunday school gift when he was a child,&quot; wherein &quot;was a picture of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednigo [sic].&quot; Such Biblical imagery was bolstered in 1971 by a book bought in Paris &quot;called &quot;Les Filles de Papier&quot;... [a] large part of [which] was taken up with comic strips about women tied up in fiendish and excruciating positions by mad robots... it was just jaw-droppingly bonkers... and yet... there was something rather appealing about it.&quot; &quot;The Art of Brian Bolland&quot; also features a separate &quot;Nudes&quot; section, mostly created for the purpose of experimenting with different inking techniques or practicing figures from difficult angles. Only three of the nude sketches involve scenes of bondage.

==Other comics work==
In addition to his early forays into full interior strip art, and his later focus on covers, Bolland has also produced a number of short – often single pages – strips, numerous pin-ups and a pair of ongoing irregular humour strips. These latter feature Bolland as writer-artist, his now-preferred method of working. Most notable are Bolland&#x27;s two &quot;personal projects&quot;, &quot;Mr. Mamoulian&quot; and &quot;The Actress and the Bishop&quot;, all appearances of which strips were collected in the book &quot;Bolland Strips!&quot; (Palmano-Bennet/Knockabout Comics, 2005). &quot;Bolland Strips!&quot; stemmed from a suggestion by Josh Palmano (owner of Gosh Comics in London, and also involved in publishing company Knockabout Comics) to collect all instances of Bolland&#x27;s two strips and Steve Moore&#x27;s &quot;Zirk&quot; story. Bolland had other thoughts, and suggested including an undrawn 20-page story called &quot;The Actress &amp; the Bishop and the Thing in the Shed&quot; (written 18 years previously), and two stories written and illustrated by him for Vertigo Comics. After negotiations with DC, the two stories – &quot;Princess &amp; the Frog&quot; (from &quot;Heartthrobs&quot;) and &quot;The Kapas&quot; (from &quot;Strange Adventures&quot;) were included alongside six limited edition Éditions Déesse prints.

===&quot;Mr. Mamoulian&quot;===
Among Bolland&#x27;s other works is the Robert Crumb-esque semi-autobiographical stream of consciousness humour strip &quot;Mr. Mamoulian&quot;, which was first printed in Paul Gravett&#x27;s UK pro-zine &quot;Escape&quot; and later brought to the US in issues of the Dark Horse title &quot;Cheval Noir&quot; and the Caliber Comics anthology &quot;Negative Burn&quot;. Bolland recalled that the origins of the character lay in him contemplating middle age on his 36th birthday, and experimenting with drawing &quot;whatever came into my head&quot;. The name echoes the character&#x27;s mammalian look, resembling a hedgehog, although Bolland acknowledges that Armenian-American film director Rouben Mamoulian likely provided an inspiration on the name front. Noting his enjoyment of Berke Breathed&#x27;s &quot;Bloom County&quot;, Bolland&#x27;s own strip wasn&#x27;t always humorous, reflecting Bolland&#x27;s own mood at times. Thus the strip became an exposé of Bolland&#x27;s inner self drawn out of a personal desire to do so, as a forum to explore and express &quot;various interests of mine, various philosophical notions, personal neuroses.&quot; Designed to be read individually – indeed, early publication in &quot;Escape&quot; was in &quot;no particular order&quot; – gradually it became clear that a mildly self-referential wider chronological narrative had been established. For example, a plot concluded on one page might&#x27;ve continued in a future volume.

Bolland wrote in 2006 that Nick Landau of Titan Books was impressed by &quot;Mr. Mamoulian&quot; and became Bolland&#x27;s unofficial agent. Through Landau, Bolland saw his strip published across Europe in publications including &quot;Linus&quot;, &quot;Cimoc&quot; and (in Sweden) &quot;Pox&quot;. Such widespread exposure had its downside, when the original artwork went missing, meaning that later reprints of &quot;Mamoulian&quot; had to be made from Bolland&#x27;s photocopies. Disenchanted by the loss of (more of) his artwork, and with declining European interest, Bolland ceased drawing the strip. Subsequent to the collection &quot;Bolland Strips!&quot;, however, interest from &quot;Negative Burn&quot; (now published by Desperado Publishing) had persuaded the artist to make more pages.

===&quot;The Actress and the Bishop&quot;===
Bolland&#x27;s other &quot;personal project&quot; is his occasional strip &quot;The Actress and the Bishop&quot;. This strip&#x27;s origins date back to 1985, when Frederick Manzano commissioned Bolland to &quot;draw 6 plates in my own portfolio bearing my name&quot; for Éditions Déesse, a &quot;small Paris based comic-store-cum-publishers&quot;, and Bolland drew in one of the six plates an elderly Bishop (whose face echoed &quot;shamelessly&quot; the work of Alberto Breccia) and a femme fatale Actress. Bolland was subsequently approached by Garry Leach and Dave Elliot, who were publishing a new comic anthology series, &quot;A1&quot;. They asked Bolland to draw – and write – a couple page to include in the first issue, and Bolland recalls that it was his first commission as both a writer and an artist. Actively seeking to write a story that wouldn&#x27;t be classified as any particular genre, Bolland found the description &#x27;Whimsy&#x27; reached by Leach and Elliot to be very apt, and &quot;rooted in the Englishness&quot; of the artists life.

Written in rhyming couplets, the pair &quot;look like the punchline of a smutty joke,&quot; but their creator instead &quot;wanted the reader to see them in a benign and non-judgemental light&quot; – the antithesis of &quot;Benny Hill, Frankie Howerd &quot;Oo er, Mrs!&quot;... [rather] like the owl and the pussycat setting sail in a pea green boat.&quot; Three pages in &quot;A1&quot; No. 1 were followed by another three in &quot;A1&quot; No. 3, while a longer story with 110 verses went unreleased for 17 years until publication in the compendium hardback &quot;Bolland Strips!&quot;.

===&quot;The Art of Brian Bolland&quot;===
In 2006 a comprehensively sizeable retrospective of Bolland&#x27;s work was published by Image/Desperado under the title &quot;The Art of Brian Bolland&quot;, featuring contextualising references and copious text – 33,500 words – written by the artist with Joe Pruett alongside hundreds of pieces of artwork and rare photographs. &quot;The Art of Brian Bolland&quot; covers all of the artist&#x27;s work to date, under an introduction from close friend Dave Gibbons, an autobiographical essay and sections ranging from his &quot;Influences&quot; (featuring near-unseen examples of Bolland&#x27;s childhood art), through each of the decades from the 1960s to the present. The book also showcases several of Bolland&#x27;s own photographs taken in Asia and Russia over twenty years of travelling.

==Non-comics work==
Bolland is also an accomplished photographer, with examples of his work being included in the Image/Desperado book &quot;The Art of Brian Bolland&quot;. In May 2008, Bolland announced on his website that he had begun making a photo book of a week he spent in Burma in 1988. Some photographs taken by Bolland in Burma are reprinted in the Image-published retrospective &quot;The Art of Brian Bolland&quot;.

Much in demand for advertisements, Bolland has produced work down the years for bookshops – including pioneering UK Sci-Fi/Comics sellers such as Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed and Forbidden Planet – and film festivals including a poster for BFI Southbank&#x27;s July/August 2008 Comic-Book Movies series. His work has appeared on the covers of, and inside, numerous publications over the decades, ranging from fanzines to several covers for London-based magazine &quot;Time Out&quot; and other professional, internationally sold magazines.

Bolland has also produced posters for local theatre groups&#x27; amateur stage productions, most notably for his local &quot;village panto&quot; production of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; in 2004.

==Personal life==
Bolland married his girlfriend, illustrator and sometime-collaborator Rachel Birkett in 1981. She later gave up illustration and became a cook for a vegetarian restaurant, although she has since assisted her husband with his work, acting as colourist, inker, co-artist and ghost. The two have a son.

==Awards==
===Wins===
Bolland and his work have received recognition in both the British and American comics industry. He was awarded the &quot;Best Newcomer&quot; award by the Society of Strip Illustration in 1977.

In 1982, he received an Inkpot Award, and the following year, he was named &quot;Favourite Artist&quot; in the British section of the Eagle Awards.

In 1989, Moore and Bolland&#x27;s &quot;The Killing Joke&quot; received an Eisner Award for &quot;Best Graphic Album,&quot; while Bolland was named separately as &quot;Best Artist/Penciller/Inker&quot; for the same work. The same year, Bolland won three Harvey Awards; two in the same categories for the same work – &quot;Best Artist&quot; and &quot;Best Graphic Album&quot; – while the third was also &quot;The Killing Joke&quot; which was separately honoured as the winner of the &quot;Best Single Issue&quot; award.

In 1992, Bolland won an Eisner Award after being named &quot;Best Cover Artist,&quot; an honour he received three years in a row (1992–1994), and twice subsequently (1999, 2001) for various works.

In 2007, Bolland added to his Eisner Award wins when &quot;The Art of Brian Bolland&quot; won the &quot;Best Comics-Related Book&quot; award.

===Nominations===
The &quot;Camelot 3000&quot; limited series, which he created with Mike W. Barr, was nominated for the 1985 Kirby Award for Best Finite Series, narrowly losing to Marv Wolfman and George Pérez&#x27;s &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. In 2002, he placed second behind Jack Kirby for the title of &quot;Best Artist Ever&quot; in the short-lived National Comics Awards.

<text>Barry Stevens (1902–1985) was an American writer and Gestalt therapist. She developed her own form of Gestalt therapy body work, based on the awareness of body processes. For the Human Potential Movement of the 1970s, she became a kind of &quot;star&quot;, but she always refused to accept that role.

She worked with, among others, the psychotherapists Fritz Perls and Carl Rogers. Bertrand Russell and Aldous Huxley were among her friends. Fritz Perls described Barry Stevens as &quot;a natural born therapist.&quot;

==Life==
Stevens was born Mildred Fox. She later changed her name from &quot;Mildred&quot; to &quot;Barry.&quot; She was married to the pediatrician Albert Mason Stevens, who co-discovered Stevens–Johnson syndrome.

Barry Stevens was a self-described &quot;High School drop-out, 1918, because what she wanted to know, she couldn&#x27;t learn in school.&quot; She and her husband moved to Hawai&#x27;i in 1934. Before Albert Mason Stevens&#x27;s death in 1945, Barry moved to the mainland. She worked at Orme Ranch School near Prescott, AZ, and from 1948 to 1951 she was an administrative aide at Deep Springs College, near Big Pine, California. She later worked as an editor in Albuquerque, New Mexico, then relocated to California.

Barry Stevens is the mother of Judith Sande Stevens (1925-2011) and John O. Stevens (1935-2018) who was also a writer, Gestalt therapist and NLP-trainer, known as Steve Andreas.

==Publications==
Her publications include &quot;Don&#x27;t Push the River (It Flows by Itself)&quot;, a first-person account of Stevens&#x27; investigations of Gestalt therapy. It shows the author during a period of several months in association with Fritz Perls at Perls&#x27; Gestalt Institute of Canada at Lake Cowichan, Vancouver Island, in 1969. Barry Stevens describes both Gestalt therapy theory and practice and her relationship with Fritz Perls in a sensitive way, thus creating a vivid image of Perls in the last months of his life.

In addition she explored Zen Buddhism, the philosophy of Jiddu Krishnamurti, and Indian American religious practices in an effort &quot;to deepen and expand personal experience and work through difficulties.&quot; Alternating with episodes from her earlier days, it became a &quot;best-seller&quot; in the circles of humanistic psychology. &quot;We have to turn ourselves upside down and reverse our approach to life.&quot;

Her earliest published work was &quot;Hide-away Island&quot; (1934) a loosely autobiographical novel about a woman on the far end of Long Island.

She met Nakata Yoshimatsu, a former valet of Jack London, in Hawai&#x27;i in the 1930s, and helped him to write down his recollections. She also wrote an article about Nakata that was published posthumously in 2000.

<text>Wakefulness is a daily recurring brain state and state of consciousness in which an individual is conscious and engages in coherent cognitive and behavioral responses to the external world.

Being awake is the opposite of being asleep, in which most external inputs to the brain are excluded from neural processing.

==Effects upon the brain==
The longer the brain has been awake, the greater the synchronous firing rates of cerebral cortex neurons. After sustained periods of sleep, both the speed and synchronicity of the neurons firing are shown to decrease.

Another effect of wakefulness is the reduction of glycogen held in the astrocytes, which supply energy to the neurons. Studies have shown that one of sleep&#x27;s underlying functions is to replenish this glycogen energy source.

==Maintenance by the brain==

Wakefulness is produced by a complex interaction between multiple neurotransmitter systems arising in the brainstem and ascending through the midbrain, hypothalamus, thalamus and basal forebrain. The posterior hypothalamus plays a key role in the maintenance of the cortical activation that underlies wakefulness. Several systems originating in this part of the brain control the shift from wakefulness into sleep and sleep into wakefulness. Histamine neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus and nearby adjacent posterior hypothalamus project to the entire brain and are the most wake-selective system so far identified in the brain. Another key system is that provided by the orexins (also known as hypocretins) projecting neurons. These exist in areas adjacent to histamine neurons and like them project widely to most brain areas and associate with arousal. Orexin deficiency has been identified as responsible for narcolepsy.

Research suggests that orexin and histamine neurons play distinct, but complementary roles in controlling wakefulness with orexin being more involved with wakeful behavior and histamine with cognition and activation of cortical EEG.

It has been suggested the fetus is not awake, with wakefulness occurring in the newborn due to the stress of being born and the associated activation of the locus coeruleus.

<text>Vice Admiral Sir Timothy James Hamilton Laurence (born 1 March 1955) is a retired Royal Navy officer and husband of Anne, Princess Royal, the only sister of King Charles III. Laurence was equerry to Queen Elizabeth II from 1986 to 1989. He married her daughter, Princess Anne, in 1992.

==Early life and education==
Timothy James Hamilton Laurence was born on 1 March 1955 in Camberwell, South London, the son of Commander Guy Stewart Laurence, RN (1896–1982; also salesman for a marine engine manufacturer), and Barbara Alison Laurence (née Symons, c. 1929–2019). He has an older brother, Jonathan Dobree Laurence (born 1952). The Laurences descend from Zaccaria Levy, a Jewish merchant who arrived in England from Venice (and possibly initially from Baghdad) in the late 18th century. The family name was later changed to Laurence.

Laurence was educated at The New Beacon Preparatory School and then at Sevenoaks School, Kent, and University College, University of Durham, on a Naval Scholarship, where he received a Bachelor of Science upper 2nd class honours degree in geography. At university, he edited the student newspaper, &quot;Palatinate&quot;.

==Naval career==
Laurence was commissioned a midshipman in the Royal Navy on 1 January 1973 and made an acting sub-lieutenant on 1 January 1975. Upon leaving Durham he completed his initial training at the Britannia Royal Naval College Dartmouth, and was posted to , a Plymouth-based frigate. He was promoted to lieutenant 10 months early, on 1 March 1977. In 1978, Laurence was attached to the training establishment and in the next year served on the Ton-class minesweeper HMS &quot;Pollington&quot;.

Laurence then served briefly as the second Navigating Officer of the Royal Yacht HMY &quot;Britannia&quot;, and from 1980 to 1982 he was Navigating Officer of the destroyer . He took command of the patrol boat off Northern Ireland in 1982, as part of the patrols for IRA gun-runners. For his services he was mentioned in despatches.

After attending for the Principal Warfare Officer course he was posted to the frigate . Laurence was promoted to lieutenant commander on 1 March 1985. He attended the Royal Australian Navy Tactics Course at HMAS &quot;Watson&quot;, Sydney, in March 1986 during which he was notified of his first staff appointment as Equerry to the Queen, a post he held from 11 October 1986 until 16 September 1989. He was promoted to commander on 31 December 1988.

In October 1989, Laurence was posted to the frigate , and took over as commanding officer on 30 January 1990, at age 34. Between 1992 and 1994, Laurence served on the naval staff in the Ministry of Defence, London. On 16 May 1994, he was appointed the first military assistant to the Secretary of State for Defence, Malcolm Rifkind, to provide military advice in his private office.

Laurence was promoted to captain on 30 June 1995, and until 1996 commanded the frigate . In May 1996, the ship returned from the Adriatic, where HMS &quot;Cumberland&quot; served in the NATO-led IFOR Task Force. On 27 August 1996, Laurence was appointed Commanding Officer of the frigate as well as Captain of the 6th Frigate Squadron. Until October 1996, the ship was deployed to the South Atlantic, on Falkland Islands patrol. In July 1997, Laurence returned to the Ministry of Defence, first on the Naval Staff and then from June 1998, on promotion to commodore, as a member of the Implementation Team for the 1998 Strategic Defence Review.

==Later career==
From January 1999, Laurence was Hudson Visiting Fellow at St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he wrote a paper on the relationship between humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping. He was then posted to the Joint Services Command and Staff College as a commodore, as Assistant Commandant (Navy), effective 15 June 1999. From 2001 to the spring of 2004, Laurence was back at the Ministry of Defence, as Director of Navy Resources and Programmes.

Promoted to rear admiral on 5 July 2004, and appointed Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff with responsibility for Resources and Plans, on 30 April 2007, Laurence was further promoted as vice admiral and appointed chief executive of Defence Estates (later renamed Defence Infrastructure Organisation).

Laurence became Head of Profession for the British Government&#x27;s Property Asset Management community in July 2009. The community includes practitioners in construction procurement, estates and property management, and facilities/contracts management. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) made Laurence an Honorary Member in 2009.

Laurence retired from the Royal Navy in August 2010 and now pursues a portfolio of mainly non-executive and charitable interests, with a particular emphasis on property and regeneration. He was on the board of the project management company Capita Symonds until 2014 and is non-executive chairman of the property developers Dorchester Regeneration. He is non-executive chairman of Purfleet Centre Regeneration, a newly-established company specialising in site reclamation and regeneration. He was a senior military adviser to PA Consulting until 2015.

Chairman of the English Heritage Trust between April 2015 and December 2022, Laurence also served Vice-Chairman of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission until 30 June 2019. A Trustee of the HMS Victory Preservation Company, his transport interests also include membership of the Great Western Advisory Board.

Laurence was elected FSA in 2021 and, in December 2023, he was appointed Chairman of the Science Museum Group. In January 2025 Laurence was forced to pull out of an official visit to South Africa with Princess Anne after suffering from a torn ligament while working on their estate, Gatcombe Park.

==Marriage==

Laurence met Princess Anne when he served as an equerry to Queen Elizabeth II in 1986, at a time when it was much rumoured that her first marriage to Captain Mark Phillips was breaking down. In 1989, the existence of private letters from Laurence to the Princess was revealed by &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper, though it did not name the sender. Buckingham Palace issued a statement: &quot;The stolen letters were addressed to the Princess Royal by Commander Timothy Laurence, the Queen&#x27;s Equerry. We have nothing to say about the contents of personal letters sent to Her Royal Highness by a friend which were stolen and which are the subject of a police investigation.&quot;

Laurence and Princess Anne married on 12 December 1992 in a Church of Scotland ceremony at Crathie Kirk, near Balmoral (the Church of Scotland permits second marriages for divorced people). He received no peerage on marriage, but was made a personal aide-de-camp to the Queen in 2008 and invested in June 2011 as a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order.

Princess Anne kept her country estate, Gatcombe Park in Gloucestershire, after her divorce from Mark Phillips. After her marriage to Laurence, the couple leased, as their London residence, a flat in the Dolphin Square complex in Westminster. They later returned to apartments in Buckingham Palace and now have an apartment at St James&#x27;s Palace.

<doc id="582215" wikidata="Q552019" url="?curid=582215" title="George Christopher Williams">
<text>George Christopher Williams (May 12, 1926 – September 8, 2010) was an American evolutionary biologist.

Williams was a professor of biology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook who was best known for his vigorous critique of group selection. The work of Williams in this area, along with W. D. Hamilton, John Maynard Smith, Richard Dawkins, and others led to the development of the gene-centered view of evolution in the 1960s.

==Academic work==
Williams&#x27; 1957 paper &quot;Pleiotropy, Natural Selection, and the Evolution of Senescence&quot; is one of the most influential in 20th century evolutionary biology, and contains at least 3 foundational ideas. The central hypothesis of antagonistic pleiotropy remains the prevailing evolutionary explanation of senescence. In this paper Williams was also the first to propose that senescence should be generally synchronized by natural selection. According to this original formulation

... if the adverse genic effects appeared earlier in one system than any other, they would be removed by selection from that system more readily than from any other. In other words, natural selection will always be in greatest opposition to the decline of the most senescence-prone system.

This important concept of synchrony of senescence was taken up a short time later by John Maynard Smith, and the origin of the idea is often misattributed to him, including in his obituary in the journal &quot;Nature&quot;. Finally, Williams&#x27; 1957 paper was the first to outline the &quot;grandmother hypothesis&quot;. William&#x27;s formulation stated that natural selection might select for menopause and post-reproductive life in females (though not explicitly mentioning grandchildren or the inclusive fitness contribution of grand-parenting).

In his first book, &quot;Adaptation and Natural Selection&quot; (1966), Williams advocated a &quot;ground rule - or perhaps &quot;doctrine&quot; would be a better term - ... that adaptation is a special and onerous concept that should only be used where it is really necessary&quot;, and that, when it is necessary, selection among genes or individuals would in general be the preferable explanation for it. He elaborated this view in later books and papers, which contributed to the development of a gene-centered view of evolution. Richard Dawkins built upon Williams&#x27; ideas around selection and genes in his book &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; (1976).

Williams was also well known for his work on the evolution of sex, and was an advocate of evolutionary medicine.

In &quot;Sex and Evolution&quot; (1975), he attempted to explain why many species use exclusive sexual reproduction despite its “twofold cost&quot;. He proposed several explanatory models ( “aphid-rotifer model,” the “strawberry-coral model,” and “elm-oyster model&quot;), though found all of them insufficient. He even considered the possibility that sex is a maladaption for some species:When major taxonomic groups all share a certain feature, it is unlikely that the feature has the same adaptive significance throughout the group. It may even be maladaptive for the majority... The fact that parthenogenesis or its equivalent, if found in a vertebrate population, has always replaced sexual reproduction entirely, is decisive evidence of the maladaptive nature of sexuality in these organisms. (Chapter 9)In later books, including &quot;Natural Selection: Domains, Levels and Challenges&quot;, Williams softened his views on group selection, recognizing that clade selection, trait group selection and multilevel selection did sometimes occur in nature, something he had earlier thought to be so unlikely it could be safely ignored.

Williams became convinced that the genic neo-Darwinism of his earlier years, while essentially correct as a theory of microevolutionary change, could not account for evolutionary phenomena over longer time scales, and was thus an &quot;utterly inadequate account of the evolution of the Earth&#x27;s biota&quot; (1992, p. 31). In particular, he became a staunch advocate of clade selection – a generalisation of species selection to monophyletic clades of any rank – which could potentially explain phenomena such as adaptive radiations, long-term phylogenetic trends, and biases in rates of speciation/extinction. In Natural Selection (1992), Williams argued that these phenomena cannot be explained by selectively-driven allele substitutions within populations, the evolutionary mechanism he had originally championed over all others. This book thus represents a substantial departure from the position of Adaptation and Natural Selection.

==Academic career==
Williams received a Ph.D. in biology from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1955. At Stony Brook he taught courses in marine vertebrate zoology, and he often used ichthyological examples in his books.

In 1992, Williams was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. He won the Crafoord Prize for Bioscience jointly with Ernst Mayr and John Maynard Smith in 1999. Richard Dawkins describes Williams as &quot;one of the most respected of American evolutionary biologists&quot;.

==Controversy==
Williams supervised an undergraduate project in 1985 which consisted of a student, Mitchell Behm, tossing live animals into tubs with domesticated ferrets, which Behm subsequently admitted he partly did &quot;for his own amusement.&quot; Dr. Charles Middleton, Director of the Division of Laboratory Animal Resources stated, &quot;If animals are just going to tear each other up, the experiment would not have been approved.&quot; Ferrets were illegal in New York at the time, without a license, which neither individual had.

After police investigation, Williams received a formal reprimand from SUNY Stony Brook for never receiving approval because of not detailing the pain of the animals involved, and for allowing non-campus animals to participate. Because the statute of limitations had expired, Williams narrowly escaped strict disciplinary action, in addition to criminal prosecution. Dr. Mark Lerman, Medical Director of Lifeline for Wildlife said there was no justification and that the experiment was completely useless.

The experiments were in direct violation of the Animal Welfare Act of 1966 and its PHS policy amendment introducing the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee model, to which SUNY and all of its researchers were subject in 1988.

<doc id="582220" wikidata="Q423136" url="?curid=582220" title="Carbofuran">
<text>Carbofuran is a carbamate insecticide, banned in the US, the EU and Canada but still widely used in South America, Australia and Asia. It is a systemic insecticide, which means that the plant absorbs it through the roots, and from there the plant distributes it throughout its organs where insecticidal concentrations are attained. Carbofuran also has contact activity against pests. It is one of the most toxic pesticides still in use.

It is marketed under the trade names Furadan, by FMC Corporation and Curaterr 10 GR, by Bayer among several others.

Carbofuran exhibits toxicity mediated by the same mechanism as that of the notorious V-series nerve agents and presents a risk to human health. It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the United States Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.

==Usage==
Carbofuran is used around the world for a wide variety of crops. It is widely used in Asia, Australia, and South America. It is commonly used in Malaysia for vegetables like eggplant (brinjal) where it is a legally registered pesticide. Carbofuran acts through phloem sap against piercing-sucking pests such as green leafhoppers, brown plant hoppers, stem borers and whorl maggots. Usage has increased in recent years because it is one of the few insecticides effective on soybean aphids, which have expanded their range since 2002 to include most soybean-growing regions of the United States.

== Chemistry ==
The technical or chemical name of carbofuran is 2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-7-benzofuranyl methylcarbamate, and its CAS Number is 1563-66-2. It is manufactured by the reaction of methyl isocyanate with 2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-7-hydroxybenzofuran.

== Toxicity ==

Carbofuran has one of the highest acute toxicities to humans of any insecticide widely used on field crops (only aldicarb and parathion are more toxic). 1 ml (1/4 teaspoon) can be fatal to humans. Most carbofuran is applied by commercial applicators using closed systems with engineered controls so there is no exposure to it in preparation. However, in developing countries, occupational exposure to carbofuran and resultant carbofuran-serum protein labeling has been reported to impact human health and well-being. Since its toxic effects are due to its activity as a cholinesterase inhibitor it is considered a neurotoxic pesticide. A recent study reports that carbofuran is a structural mimic of the neurohormone melatonin and could directly bind to MT2 melatonin receptor (Ki = 1.7 uM). Disruption of melatonin signaling could impact the circadian rhythm balance and is linked to elevated risk of developing diabetes.

Carbofuran is highly toxic to vertebrates with an oral of 8–14 mg/kg in rats and 19 mg/kg in dogs.

Carbofuran is known to be particularly toxic to birds. In its granular form, a single grain will kill a bird. Birds often eat numerous grains of the pesticide, mistaking them for seeds, and then die shortly thereafter. Before the granular form was banned by the EPA in 1991, it was blamed for millions of bird deaths per year. The liquid version of the pesticide is less hazardous to birds since they are not as likely to ingest it directly, but it is still very hazardous.

Carbofuran has been illegally used to intentionally poison wildlife not only in the US, Canada and Great Britain; poisoned wildlife have included coyotes, kites, golden eagles and buzzards. Secondary fatal poisoning of domestic and wild animals has been documented, specifically raptors (bald eagles and golden eagles), domestic dogs, raccoons, vultures and other scavengers. In Kenya, farmers are using carbofuran to kill lions and other predators.

In a number of publicized incidents worldwide, carbofuran has also been used to poison domestic pets.

Illegally smuggled carbofuran is used on 90% of marijuana grown illegally on public land in California. These illegal, carbofuran-contaminated California marijuana grows appear to be the source for the majority of marijuana consumed in states where marijuana hasn&#x27;t been legalized.

Carbofuran is an endocrine disruptor and a probable reproduction/development intoxicant. At low-level exposures, carbofuran may cause transient alterations in the concentration of hormones. These alterations may consequently lead to serious reproductive problems following repeated exposure. When exposed &quot;in utero&quot; or during lactation, a decrease in sperm motility and sperm count along with an increase in percent abnormal sperm was observed in rats at 0.4 mg/kg dose level. In one study, the exposure of rats to sublethal amounts of carbofuran decreased testosterone by 88%, while the levels of progesterone, cortisol, and estradiol were significantly increased (1279%, 202%, and 150%, respectively).

== Bans ==
Carbofuran is banned in Canada, Sri Lanka and the European Union.

In 2008, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that it intended to ban carbofuran. In December of that year, FMC Corp., the sole US manufacturer of carbofuran, announced that it had voluntarily requested that the EPA cancel all but six of the previously allowed uses of that chemical as a pesticide. With this change, carbofuran usage in the United States would be allowed only on corn, potatoes, pumpkins, sunflowers, pine seedlings and spinach grown for seed. However, in May 2009, the EPA canceled all food tolerances, an action which amounts to a &quot;de facto&quot; ban on its use on all crops grown for human consumption.

Kenya is considering banning carbofuran, but it is legal to buy over-the-counter in Kenya.

=== Health scare in Thailand ===
Due to nonregistration of 4 carcinogenic chemicals used on crops not listed in the Dangerous Substances Act of Thailand, vegetables with residues of methomyl, carbofuran, dicrotophos, and EPN were taken off supermarket shelves in July 2012.

=== Death of lions in Kenya ===
In 2009, the CBS television news magazine &quot;60 Minutes&quot; ran an exposé discussing the use of Furadan by Kenyan farmers as a poison to kill African lions. The piece suggested that Furadan was a serious threat to the future of the lion population in Africa. FMC has commented on this issue through the media and their websites including furadanfacts.com. They engaged with government officials, NGOs and others to try and resolve the illegal use of pesticides to kill wildlife. The company took action to stop the sale of this product and instituted a buyback program in East Africa when it was determined that the illegal and intentional misuse of chemicals against wildlife could not be controlled by education or stewardship programs alone. Despite this, however, National Geographic stated in 2018 that carbofuran &quot;is still very much available&quot; in Kenya.

<doc id="582228" wikidata="Q527266" url="?curid=582228" title="Rabi cycle">
<text>In physics, the Rabi cycle (or Rabi flop) is the cyclic behaviour of a two-level quantum system in the presence of an oscillatory driving field. A great variety of physical processes belonging to the areas of quantum computing, condensed matter, atomic and molecular physics, and nuclear and particle physics can be conveniently studied in terms of two-level quantum mechanical systems, and exhibit Rabi flopping when coupled to an optical driving field. The effect is important in quantum optics, magnetic resonance, and quantum computing, and is named after Isidor Isaac Rabi.

A two-level system is one that has two possible energy levels. One level is a ground state with lower energy, and the other is an excited state with higher energy. If the energy levels are not degenerate (i.e. don&#x27;t have equal energies), the system can absorb or emit a quantum of energy and transition from the ground state to the excited state or vice versa. When an atom (or some other two-level system) is illuminated by a coherent beam of photons, it will cyclically absorb photons and emit them by stimulated emission. One such cycle is called a Rabi cycle, and the inverse of its duration is the Rabi frequency of the system. The effect can be modeled using the Jaynes–Cummings model and the Bloch vector formalism.

==Mathematical description of spin flopping==
One example of Rabi flopping is the spin flipping within a quantum system containing a spin-1/2 particle and an oscillating magnetic field. We split the magnetic field into a constant &#x27;environment&#x27; field, and the oscillating part, so that our field looks likeformula_1where formula_2 and formula_3 are the strengths of the environment and the oscillating fields respectively, and formula_4 is the frequency at which the oscillating field oscillates. We can then write a Hamiltonian describing this field, yieldingformula_5where formula_6, formula_7, and formula_8 are the spin operators. The frequency formula_9is known as the Rabi frequency. We can substitute in their matrix forms to find the matrix representing the Hamiltonian:formula_10where we have used formula_11. This Hamiltonian is a function of time, meaning we cannot use the standard prescription of Schrödinger time evolution in quantum mechanics, where the time evolution operator is formula_12, because this formula assume that the Hamiltonian is constant with respect to time.

The main strategy in solving this problem is to transform the Hamiltonian so that the time dependence is gone, solve the problem in this transformed frame, and then transform the results back to normal. This can be done by shifting the reference frame that we work in to match the rotating magnetic field. If we rotate along with the magnetic field, then from our point of view, the magnetic field is not rotating and appears constant. Therefore, in the rotating reference frame, both the magnetic field and the Hamiltonian are constant with respect to time.

We denote our spin-1/2 particle state to be formula_13 in the stationary reference frame, where formula_14 and formula_15 are spin up and spin down states respectively, and formula_16. We can transform this state to the rotating reference frame by using a rotation operatorformula_17which rotates the state counterclockwise around the positive z-axis in state space, which may be visualized as a Bloch sphere. At a time formula_18 and a frequency formula_4, the magnetic field will have precessed around by an angle formula_20. To transform formula_21 into the rotating reference frame, note that the stationary x and y-axes rotate clockwise from the point of view of the rotating reference frame. Because the formula_22 operator rotates counterclockwise, we must negate the angle to produce the correct state in the rotating reference frame. Thus, the state becomesformula_23We may rewrite the amplitudes so thatformula_24The time dependent Schrödinger equation in the stationary reference frame isformula_25Expanding this using the matrix forms of the Hamiltonian and the state yieldsformula_26Applying the matrix and separating the components of the vector allows us to write two coupled differential equations as followsformula_27To transform this into the rotating reference frame, we may use the fact that formula_28 and formula_29 to write the following:formula_30where formula_31. Now defineformula_32We now write these two new coupled differential equations back into the form of the Schrödinger equation:formula_33In some sense, this is a transformed Schrödinger equation in the rotating reference frame. Crucially, the Hamiltonian does not vary with respect to time, meaning in this reference frame, we can use the familiar solution to Schrödinger time evolution:formula_34This transformed problem is equivalent to that of Larmor precession of a spin state, so we have solved the essence of Rabi flopping. The probability that a particle starting in the spin up state flips to the spin down state can be stated asformula_35where formula_36 is the generalized Rabi Frequency. Something important to notice is that formula_37 will not reach 1 unless formula_38. In other words, the frequency of the rotating magnetic field formula_4 must match the environmental field&#x27;s Larmor frequency formula_40 in order for the spin to fully flip; they must achieve resonance. When resonance (i.e. formula_41) is achieved, formula_42.

Within the rotating reference frame, when resonance is achieved, it is as if there is no environmental magnetic field, and the oscillating magnetic field looks constant. Thus both mathematically (as we have derived) and physically, the problem reduces to the precession of a spin state under a constant magnetic field (Larmor precession).

To transform the solved state back to the stationary reference frame, we reuse the rotation operator with the opposite angleformula_43, thus yielding a full solution to the problem.

== Applications ==
The Rabi effect is important in quantum optics, magnetic resonance and quantum computing.

Rabi flopping may be used to describe a two-level atom with an excited state and a ground state in an electromagnetic field with frequency tuned to the excitation energy. Using the spin-flipping formula but applying it to this system yields
: formula_44

where formula_4 is the Rabi frequency.

=== Quantum computing ===
Any two-state quantum system can be used to model a qubit. Rabi flopping provides a physical way to allow for spin flips in a qubit system. At resonance, the transition probability is given by formula_46To go from state formula_47 to state formula_48 it is sufficient to adjust the time formula_49 during which the rotating field acts such that formula_50 or formula_51. This is called a formula_52 pulse. If a time intermediate between 0 and formula_53 is chosen, we obtain a superposition of formula_47 and formula_48. In particular for formula_56, we have a formula_57 pulse, which acts as: formula_58The equations are essentially identical in the case of a two level atom in the field of a laser when the generally well satisfied rotating wave approximation is made, where formula_59 is the energy difference between the two atomic levels, formula_4 is the frequency of laser wave and Rabi frequency formula_9 is proportional to the product of the transition electric dipole moment of atom formula_62 and electric field formula_63 of the laser wave that is formula_64. On a quantum computer, these oscillations are obtained by exposing qubits to periodic electric or magnetic fields during suitably adjusted time intervals.
